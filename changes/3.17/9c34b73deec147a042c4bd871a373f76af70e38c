mmc: mmci: Add Qcom specific rx_fifocnt logic.

MCIFIFOCNT register behaviour on Qcom chips is very different than the other
pl180 integrations. MCIFIFOCNT register contains the number of
words that are still waiting to be transferred through the FIFO. It keeps
decrementing once the host CPU reads the MCIFIFO. With the existing logic and
the MCIFIFOCNT behaviour, mmci_pio_read will loop forever, as the FIFOCNT
register will always return transfer size before reading the FIFO.

Also the data sheet states that "This register is only useful for debug
purposes and should not be used for normal operation since it does not reflect
data which may or may not be in the pipeline".

This patch implements a qcom specific get_rx_fifocnt function which is
implemented based on status register flags. Based on qcom_fifo flag in
variant data structure, the corresponding get_rx_fifocnt function is selected.
