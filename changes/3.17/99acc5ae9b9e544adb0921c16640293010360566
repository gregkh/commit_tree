staging: comedi: addi_apci_1564: driver no longer needs to include addi_common.h

This driver no longer depends on anything in addi_common.h, save for a
few headers that it was including indirectly.  Remove the include of
addi_common.h and add the includes of <linux/interrupt.h>
and <linux/sched.h> directly.
