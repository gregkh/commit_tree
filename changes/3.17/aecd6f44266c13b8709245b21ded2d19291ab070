mm: close race between do_fault_around() and fault_around_bytes_set()

Things can go wrong if fault_around_bytes will be changed under
do_fault_around(): between fault_around_mask() and fault_around_pages().

Let's read fault_around_bytes only once during do_fault_around() and
calculate mask based on the reading.

Note: fault_around_bytes can only be updated via debug interface.  Also
I've tried but was not able to trigger a bad behaviour without the
patch.  So I would not consider this patch as urgent.
