workqueue: move rescuer pool detachment to the end

In 51697d393922 ("workqueue: use generic attach/detach routine for
rescuers"), The rescuer detaches itself from the pool before put_pwq()
so that the put_unbound_pool() will not destroy the rescuer-attached
pool.

It is unnecessary.  worker_detach_from_pool() can be used as the last
statement to access to the pool just like the regular workers,
put_unbound_pool() will wait for it to detach and then free the pool.

So we move the worker_detach_from_pool() down, make it coincide with
the regular workers.
