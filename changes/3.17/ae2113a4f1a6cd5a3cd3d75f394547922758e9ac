KVM: PPC: Book3S: Allow only implemented hcalls to be enabled or disabled

This adds code to check that when the KVM_CAP_PPC_ENABLE_HCALL
capability is used to enable or disable in-kernel handling of an
hcall, that the hcall is actually implemented by the kernel.
If not an EINVAL error is returned.

This also checks the default-enabled list of hcalls and prints a
warning if any hcall there is not actually implemented.
