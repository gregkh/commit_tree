Input: wacom - register the input devices on top of the HID one

Matches the current behavior of the HID subsystem and removes one more
dependency over USB.

The current user space clients which relies on this to fetch the
LEDs path need an update. However, we already break them in the
kernel v3.11 for the Bluetooth Wacom devices. They are going to be fixed
soon.
