ALSA: compress: fix an integer overflow check

I previously added an integer overflow check here but looking at it now,
it's still buggy.

The bug happens in snd_compr_allocate_buffer().  We multiply
".fragments" and ".fragment_size" and that doesn't overflow but then we
save it in an unsigned int so it truncates the high bits away and we
allocate a smaller than expected size.
