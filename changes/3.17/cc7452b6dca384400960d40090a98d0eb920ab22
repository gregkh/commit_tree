mm: export NR_SHMEM via sysinfo(2) / si_meminfo() interfaces

Historically, we exported shared pages to userspace via sysinfo(2)
sharedram and /proc/meminfo's "MemShared" fields.  With the advent of
tmpfs, from kernel v2.4 onward, that old way for accounting shared mem
was deemed inaccurate and we started to export a hard-coded 0 for
sysinfo.sharedram.  Later on, during the 2.6 timeframe, "MemShared" got
re-introduced to /proc/meminfo re-branded as "Shmem", but we're still
reporting sysinfo.sharedmem as that old hard-coded zero, which makes the
"shared memory" report inconsistent across interfaces.

This patch leverages the addition of explicit accounting for pages used
by shmem/tmpfs -- "4b02108 mm: oom analysis: add shmem vmstat" -- in
order to make the users of sysinfo(2) and si_meminfo*() friends aware of
that vmstat entry and make them report it consistently across the
interfaces, as well to make sysinfo(2) returned data consistent with our
current API documentation states.
