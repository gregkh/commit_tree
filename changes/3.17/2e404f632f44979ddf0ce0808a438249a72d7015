inet: frags: use INET_FRAG_EVICTED to prevent icmp messages

Now that we have INET_FRAG_EVICTED we might as well use it to stop
sending icmp messages in the "frag_expire" functions instead of
stripping INET_FRAG_FIRST_IN from their flags when evicting.
Also fix the comment style in ip6_expire_frag_queue().
