powerpc/book3s: handle HMIs for cpus in nap mode.

HMIs are thread specific and can come while thread is in sleep/nap mode.
Hence with SMT=off mode we can receive HMIs on sleeping threads. For
interrupt received in nap mode, cpu wakes up at system reset vector, clears
the interrupt and go back to nap mode again. But HMIs are sticky and they
keep happening until we clear reason bits from HMER. Hence add a special
check for HMI in reset vector (through power7_wakeup_* functions) and
invoke opal call to handle HMI.
