tracing: Move the trace_seq_* functions into its own trace_seq.c file

The trace_seq_*() functions are a nice utility that allows users to manipulate
buffers with printf() like formats. It has its own trace_seq.h header in
include/linux and should be in its own file. Being tied with trace_output.c
is rather awkward.
