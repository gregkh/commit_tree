serial: sirf: transfer more bytes once to decrease interrupts

the current codes send 1 bytes, then after getting TX done interrupt,
send subsequent bytes. it causes redundant interrupts.
for example, if we have 3 bytes in TX buffer, the TX flow is:
1. send 1 byte
2. get TX down interrupt
3. send the left 2 bytes
4. get TX down interrupt

this patch moves to send more bytes and decrease interrupts, the new
flow is:
1. send 3 bytes
2. get TX down interrupt
