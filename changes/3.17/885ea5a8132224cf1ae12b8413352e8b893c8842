drm/i915: Fix DEIER and GTIER collecting for BDW.

BDW has many other Display Engine interrupts and GT interrupts registers.
Collecting it properly on gpu_error_state.

On debugfs all was properly listed already but besides we were also listing old
DEIER and GTIER that doesn't exist on BDW anymore. This was causing
unclaimed register messages

v2: Fix small issues of first version and don't read DEIER regs when pipe's
    power well is disabled
v3: bikeshed accepted: use enum pipe pipe instead of int i for pipe interection
v4: Ben notice previous version was checking for display_power_enabled without
    using propper locks. Using _unlocked version isn't reliable and we cannot
    get this registers when power well is off. So let's avoid getting all DE_IER
    per pipe for now. If someone think this is an useful information it can be
    added later.
v5: Ben: put back debugfs stuff that might be coverred by pm_get and use
    	 gen >= 8 trying to predict future.
