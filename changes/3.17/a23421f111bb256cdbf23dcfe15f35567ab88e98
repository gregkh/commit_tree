x86/mm: Unify remote INVLPG code

There are currently three paths through the remote flush code:

1. full invalidation
2. single page invalidation using invlpg
3. ranged invalidation using invlpg

This takes 2 and 3 and combines them in to a single path by
making the single-page one just be the start and end be start
plus a single page.  This makes placement of our tracepoint easier.
