brcmfmac: Add protocol addressing mode and peer deletion API.

The soon to be added protocol msgbuf requires information about
interface addressing mode and peer deletion. This patch adds the
necessary APIs to proto, implements dummy functions in BCDC and
adds calls to proto wherever necessary by wl_cfg80211.
