drm/i915: Add aspect ratio property for HDMI

Create and attach the drm property to set aspect ratio. If there is no user
specified value, then PAR_NONE/Automatic option is set by default. User can
select aspect ratio 4:3 or 16:9. The aspect ratio selected by user would
come into effect with a mode set.

v2: Modified switch case to include aspect ratio enum changes

v3: Modified the patch according the change in the earlier patch to return
errno in case property creation fails. With this change, property will be
attached only if creation is successful
