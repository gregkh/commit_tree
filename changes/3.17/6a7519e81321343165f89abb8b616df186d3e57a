efi/arm64: Store Runtime Services revision

"efi" global data structure contains "runtime_version" field which must
be assigned in order to use it later in Runtime Services virtual calls
(virt_efi_* functions).

Before this patch "runtime_version" was unassigned (0), so each
Runtime Service virtual call that checks revision would fail.
