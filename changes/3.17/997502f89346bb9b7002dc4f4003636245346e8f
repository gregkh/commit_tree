Input: max7359 - introduce the use of managed interfaces

This patch introduces the use of managed interfaces like devm_kzalloc,
devm_input_allocate_device, devm_request_threaded_irq etc. and does away
with the calls to free the allocated memory. The remove function is no
longer required and is completely done away with. Also, the labels in the
probe function are removed.
