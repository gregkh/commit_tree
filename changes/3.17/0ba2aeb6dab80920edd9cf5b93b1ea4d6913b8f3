[media] v4l2-ctrls: increase internal min/max/step/def to 64 bit

While VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL is limited to 32 bit min/max/step/def values
for controls, the upcoming VIDIOC_QUERY_EXT_CTRL isn't. So increase
the internal representation to 64 bits in preparation.

Because of these changes the msi3101 driver has been modified slightly
to fix a formatting issue (%d becomes %lld), vivi had to be modified
as well to cope with the new 64-bit min/max values and the PIXEL_RATE
control in a few sensor drivers required proper min/max/def values.
