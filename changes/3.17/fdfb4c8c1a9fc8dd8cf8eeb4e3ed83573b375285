dm thin: set minimum_io_size to pool's data block size

Before, if the block layer's limit stacking didn't establish an
optimal_io_size that was compatible with the thin-pool's data block size
we'd set optimal_io_size to the data block size and minimum_io_size to 0
(which the block layer adjusts to be physical_block_size).

Update pool_io_hints() to set both minimum_io_size and optimal_io_size
to the thin-pool's data block size.  This fixes an issue reported where
mkfs.xfs would create more XFS Allocation Groups on thinp volumes than
on a normal linear LV of comparable size, see:
