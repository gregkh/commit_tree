mm, oom: ensure memoryless node zonelist always includes zones

With memoryless node support being worked on, it's possible that for
optimizations that a node may not have a non-NULL zonelist.  When
CONFIG_NUMA is enabled and node 0 is memoryless, this means the zonelist
for first_online_node may become NULL.

The oom killer requires a zonelist that includes all memory zones for
the sysrq trigger and pagefault out of memory handler.

Ensure that a non-NULL zonelist is always passed to the oom killer.
