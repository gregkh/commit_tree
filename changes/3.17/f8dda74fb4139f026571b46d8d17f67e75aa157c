perf timechart: Fix rendering in Firefox

Firefox doesn't correctly handle cases where we specify number in
quotes and have some padding around the number, like the following:
<rect ... height=" 3.1" ...>
In this case, it doesn't draw the figure. This patch removes 'field width'
component from fprintf strings to fix it.
