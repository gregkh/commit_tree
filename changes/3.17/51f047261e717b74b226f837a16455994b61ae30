KVM: PPC: Allow kvmppc_get_last_inst() to fail

On book3e, guest last instruction is read on the exit path using load
external pid (lwepx) dedicated instruction. This load operation may fail
due to TLB eviction and execute-but-not-read entries.

This patch lay down the path for an alternative solution to read the guest
last instruction, by allowing kvmppc_get_lat_inst() function to fail.
Architecture specific implmentations of kvmppc_load_last_inst() may read
last guest instruction and instruct the emulation layer to re-execute the
guest in case of failure.

Make kvmppc_get_last_inst() definition common between architectures.
