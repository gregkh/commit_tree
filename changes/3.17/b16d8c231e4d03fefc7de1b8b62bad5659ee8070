x86/efi: Fix 3DNow optimization build failure in EFI stub

Building a 32-bit kernel with CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW and CONFIG_EFI_STUB
leads to the following build error,

  drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/lib.a(efi-stub-helper.o): In function `efi_relocate_kernel':
  efi-stub-helper.c:(.text+0xda5): undefined reference to `_mmx_memcpy'

This is due to the fact that the EFI boot stub pulls in the 3DNow
optimized versions of the memcpy() prototype from
arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h, even though the _mmx_memcpy()
implementation isn't available in the EFI stub.

For now, predicate CONFIG_EFI_STUB on !CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW. This is
most definitely a temporary fix. A complete solution will involve
selectively including kernel headers/symbols into the early-boot
execution environment of the EFI boot stub, i.e. something analogous to
the way that the _SETUP symbol is used.

Previous attempts have been made to fix this kind of problem, though
none seem to have ever been merged,

Clearly, this problem has been around for a long time.
