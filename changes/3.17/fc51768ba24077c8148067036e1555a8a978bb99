thunderbolt: Correct the size argument to devm_kzalloc

nhi->rx_rings does not have type as struct tb_ring *, as it is a
double pointer so the elements of the array should have pointer type,
not structure type.

The Coccinelle semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:

// <smpl>
@disable sizeof_type_expr@
type T;
T **x;
@@

  x =
  <+...sizeof(
- T
+ *x
  )...+>
// </smpl>
