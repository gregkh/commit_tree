irq_work: Implement remote queueing

irq work currently only supports local callbacks. However its code
is mostly ready to run remote callbacks and we have some potential user.

The full nohz subsystem currently open codes its own remote irq work
on top of the scheduler ipi when it wants a CPU to reevaluate its next
tick. However this ad hoc solution bloats the scheduler IPI.

Lets just extend the irq work subsystem to support remote queuing on top
of the generic SMP IPI to handle this kind of user. This shouldn't add
noticeable overhead.
