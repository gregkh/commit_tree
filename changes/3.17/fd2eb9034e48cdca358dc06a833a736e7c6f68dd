scsi: move the writeable field from struct scsi_device to struct scsi_cd

We currently set the field in common code based on the device type,
but then only use it in the cdrom driver which also overrides the
value previously set in the generic code.

Just leave this entirely to the CDROM driver to make everyones life
simpler.
