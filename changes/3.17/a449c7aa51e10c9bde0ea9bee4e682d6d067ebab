KVM: x86: Hypercall handling does not considers opsize correctly

Currently, the hypercall handling routine only considers LME as an indication
to whether the guest uses 32/64-bit mode. This is incosistent with hyperv
hypercalls handling and against the common sense of considering cs.l as well.
This patch uses is_64_bit_mode instead of is_long_mode for that matter. In
addition, the result is masked in respect to the guest execution mode. Last, it
changes kvm_hv_hypercall to use is_64_bit_mode as well to simplify the code.
