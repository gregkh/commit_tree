kexec: create a new config option CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE for new syscall

Currently new system call kexec_file_load() and all the associated code
compiles if CONFIG_KEXEC=y.  But new syscall also compiles purgatory
code which currently uses gcc option -mcmodel=large.  This option seems
to be available only gcc 4.4 onwards.

Hiding new functionality behind a new config option will not break
existing users of old gcc.  Those who wish to enable new functionality
will require new gcc.  Having said that, I am trying to figure out how
can I move away from using -mcmodel=large but that can take a while.

I think there are other advantages of introducing this new config
option.  As this option will be enabled only on x86_64, other arches
don't have to compile generic kexec code which will never be used.  This
new code selects CRYPTO=y and CRYPTO_SHA256=y.  And all other arches had
to do this for CONFIG_KEXEC.  Now with introduction of new config
option, we can remove crypto dependency from other arches.

Now CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE is available only on x86_64.  So whereever I had
CONFIG_X86_64 defined, I got rid of that.

For CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE, instead of doing select CRYPTO=y, I changed it to
"depends on CRYPTO=y".  This should be safer as "select" is not
recursive.
