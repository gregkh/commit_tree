KVM: x86: smsw emulation is incorrect in 64-bit mode

In 64-bit mode, when the destination is a register, the assignment is done
according to the operand size. Otherwise (memory operand or no 64-bit mode), a
16-bit assignment is performed.

Currently, 16-bit assignment is always done to the destination.
