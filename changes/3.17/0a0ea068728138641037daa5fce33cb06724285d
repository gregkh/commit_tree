net: davinci_mdio: allow to create phys from dt

This patch allows to create PHYs from DT in case
if they are explicitly defined. The of_mdiobus_register() is
used for such purposes.

For backward compatibility, call  of_mdiobus_register() only in case
if at least one PHY's child is defined in DT, otherwise rollback to
mdiobus_register().
