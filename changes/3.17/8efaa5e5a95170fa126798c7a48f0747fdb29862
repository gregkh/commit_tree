Input: atmel_mxt_ts - recover from bootloader on probe

The MXT device may be in bootloader mode on probe, due to:
1) APP CRC failure, either:
  a) flash corruption
  b) bad power or other intermittent problem while checking CRC
2) If the device has been reset 10 or more times without accessing comms
3) Warm probe, device was in bootloader mode already

This code attempts to recover from 1(b) and 3.

There is an additional complexity: we have to try two possible bootloader
addresses because the mapping is not one-to-one and we don't know the exact
model yet.
