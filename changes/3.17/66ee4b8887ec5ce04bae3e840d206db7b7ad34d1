shmem: fix double uncharge in __shmem_file_setup()

If __shmem_file_setup() fails on struct file allocation it uncharges
memory commitment twice: first by shmem_unacct_size() and second time
implicitly in shmem_evict_inode() when it kills the newly created inode.

This patch removes shmem_unacct_size() from error path if the inode was
already there.
