Bluetooth: Fix sending Device Removed when clearing all parameters

When calling Device Remove with BDADDR_ANY we should in a similar way
emit Device Removed events as we do when removing a single device. Since
we have to iterate the list and call device_removed() the dedicated
hci_conn_params_clear_enabled() is not really useful anymore. This patch
removes the helper function and does the event emission and list item
removal in a single loop.
