clk: qcom: Fix MN frequency tables, parent map, and jpegd

Clocks that don't have a pre-divider don't list any pre-divider
in their frequency tables, but their tables are initialized using
aggregate initializers. Use tagged initializers so we properly
assign the m and n values for each frequency. Furthermore, the
mmcc_pxo_pll8_pll2_pll3 array improperly mapped the second
element to pll2 instead of pll8, causing the clock driver to
recalculate the wrong rate for any clocks using this array along
with a rate that uses pll2. Plus the .num_parents field is 3
instead of 4 so you can't even switch the parent to pll3. Finally
I noticed that the jpegd clock improperly indicates that the
pre-divider width is only 2, when it's actually 4 bits wide.
