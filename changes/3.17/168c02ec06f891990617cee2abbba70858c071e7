    drm: add object property typ

I asked for a check to make sure that we never leak an fb from the
generic mode object lookup since those have completely different
lifetime rules. Rob added it, but outside of the idr mutex, which
means that our dereference of obj->type can already chase free'd
memory.

Somehow I didn't spot this, so fix this asap.

v2: Simplify the conditionals as suggested by Chris.
