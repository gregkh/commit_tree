driver core: platform: add device binding path 'driver_override'

Needed by platform device drivers, such as the upcoming
vfio-platform driver, in order to bypass the existing OF, ACPI,
id_table and name string matches, and successfully be able to be
bound to any device, like so:

echo vfio-platform > /sys/bus/platform/devices/fff51000.ethernet/driver_override
echo fff51000.ethernet > /sys/bus/platform/devices/fff51000.ethernet/driver/unbind
echo fff51000.ethernet > /sys/bus/platform/drivers_probe

This mimics "PCI: Introduce new device binding path using
pci_dev.driver_override", which is an interface enhancement
for more deterministic PCI device binding, e.g., when in the
presence of hotplug.
