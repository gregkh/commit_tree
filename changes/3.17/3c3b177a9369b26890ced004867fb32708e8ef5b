reservation: add suppport for read-only access using rcu

This adds some extra functions to deal with rcu.

reservation_object_get_fences_rcu() will obtain the list of shared
and exclusive fences without obtaining the ww_mutex.

reservation_object_wait_timeout_rcu() will wait on all fences of the
reservation_object, without obtaining the ww_mutex.

reservation_object_test_signaled_rcu() will test if all fences of the
reservation_object are signaled without using the ww_mutex.

reservation_object_get_excl and reservation_object_get_list require
the reservation object to be held, updating requires
write_seqcount_begin/end. If only the exclusive fence is needed,
rcu_dereference followed by fence_get_rcu can be used, if the shared
fences are needed it's recommended to use the supplied functions.
