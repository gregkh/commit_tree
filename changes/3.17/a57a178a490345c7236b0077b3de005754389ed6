blk-mq: avoid infinite recursion with the FUA flag

We should not insert requests into the flush state machine from
blk_mq_insert_request.  All incoming flush requests come through
blk_{m,s}q_make_request and are handled there, while blk_execute_rq_nowait
should only be called for BLOCK_PC requests.  All other callers
deal with requests that already went through the flush statemchine
and shouldn't be reinserted into it.
