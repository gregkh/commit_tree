drm/nouveau: Bump version from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2

Linux 3.16 fixed multiple bugs in kms pageflip completion events
and timestamping, which were originally introduced in Linux 3.13.

These fixes have been backported to all stable kernels since 3.13.

However, the userspace nouveau-ddx needs to be aware if it is
running on a kernel on which these bugs are fixed, or not.

Bump the patchlevel of the drm driver version to signal this,
so backporting this patch to stable 3.13+ kernels will give the
ddx the required info.
