resource: provide new functions to walk through resources

I have added two more functions to walk through resources.

Currently walk_system_ram_range() deals with pfn and /proc/iomem can
contain partial pages.  By dealing in pfn, callback function loses the
info that last page of a memory range is a partial page and not the full
page.  So I implemented walk_system_ram_res() which returns u64 values to
callback functions and now it properly return start and end address.

walk_system_ram_range() uses find_next_system_ram() to find the next ram
resource.  This in turn only travels through siblings of top level child
and does not travers through all the nodes of the resoruce tree.  I also
need another function where I can walk through all the resources, for
example figure out where "GART" aperture is.  Figure out where ACPI memory
is.

So I wrote another function walk_iomem_res() which walks through all
/proc/iomem resources and returns matches as asked by caller.  Caller can
specify "name" of resource, start and end and flags.

Got rid of find_next_system_ram_res() and instead implemented more generic
find_next_iomem_res() which can be used to traverse top level children
only based on an argument.
