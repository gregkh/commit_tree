mwifiex: add hscfg to debugfs

Some SDIO controllers do not support MMC_PM_KEEP_POWER properly.
To test host sleep feature without putting the system into sleep
we need to simulate host sleep configuration & handshake between
driver and firmware using customized parameters.
This patch adds hscfg debugfs item, with which user could change
host sleep parameters for debugging.
