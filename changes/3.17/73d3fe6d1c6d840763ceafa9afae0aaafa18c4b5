gro: fix aggregation for skb using frag_list

In commit 8a29111c7ca6 ("net: gro: allow to build full sized skb")
I added a regression for linear skb that traditionally force GRO
to use the frag_list fallback.

Erez Shitrit found that at most two segments were aggregated and
the "if (skb_gro_len(p) != pinfo->gso_size)" test was failing.

This is because pinfo at this spot still points to the last skb in the
chain, instead of the first one, where we find the correct gso_size
information.
