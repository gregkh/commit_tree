KVM: Move irq notifier implementation into eventfd.c

This moves the functions kvm_irq_has_notifier(), kvm_notify_acked_irq(),
kvm_register_irq_ack_notifier() and kvm_unregister_irq_ack_notifier()
from irqchip.c to eventfd.c.  The reason for doing this is that those
functions are used in connection with IRQFDs, which are implemented in
eventfd.c.  In future we will want to use IRQFDs on platforms that
don't implement the GSI routing implemented in irqchip.c, so we won't
be compiling in irqchip.c, but we still need the irq notifiers.  The
implementation is unchanged.
