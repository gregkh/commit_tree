declance: Fix 64-bit compilation warnings

This fixes compiler warnings:

drivers/net/ethernet/amd/declance.c: In function 'lance_init_ring':
drivers/net/ethernet/amd/declance.c:478: warning: format '%8.8x' expects type 'unsigned int', but argument 3 has type 'long unsigned int'
drivers/net/ethernet/amd/declance.c:487: warning: format '%8.8x' expects type 'unsigned int', but argument 3 has type 'long unsigned int'
drivers/net/ethernet/amd/declance.c:503: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
drivers/net/ethernet/amd/declance.c:520: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size

in 64-bit compilation.  Where the value printed is an offset (whose range
will always fit) the cast uses a 32-bit type, otherwise, where it is a
host memory address, the pointer is output directly with %p.  Also the
remaining `0x' prefix is dropped for consistency across these messages.

Tested with both 32-bit and 64-bit compilation, as well as at the run time
(with the debug messages affected enabled).
