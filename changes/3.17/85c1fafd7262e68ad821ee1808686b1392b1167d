powerpc/mm: Use read barrier when creating real_pte

On ppc64 we support 4K hash pte with 64K page size. That requires
us to track the hash pte slot information on a per 4k basis. We do that
by storing the slot details in the second half of pte page. The pte bit
_PAGE_COMBO is used to indicate whether the second half need to be
looked while building real_pte. We need to use read memory barrier while
doing that so that load of hidx is not reordered w.r.t _PAGE_COMBO
check. On the store side we already do a lwsync in __hash_page_4K
