sparc64: Fix pcr_ops initialization and usage bugs.

Christopher reports that perf_event_print_debug() can crash in uniprocessor
builds.  The crash is due to pcr_ops being NULL.

This happens because pcr_arch_init() is only invoked by smp_cpus_done() which
only executes in SMP builds.

init_hw_perf_events() is closely intertwined with pcr_ops being setup properly,
therefore:

1) Call pcr_arch_init() early on from init_hw_perf_events(), instead of
   from smp_cpus_done().

2) Do not hook up a PMU type if pcr_ops is NULL after pcr_arch_init().

3) Move init_hw_perf_events to a later initcall so that it we will be
   sure to invoke pcr_arch_init() after all cpus are brought up.

Finally, guard the one naked sequence of pcr_ops dereferences in
__global_pmu_self() with an appropriate NULL check.
