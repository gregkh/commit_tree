net: filter: simplify socket charging

attaching bpf program to a socket involves multiple socket memory arithmetic,
since size of 'sk_filter' is changing when classic BPF is converted to eBPF.
Also common path of program creation has to deal with two ways of freeing
the memory.

Simplify the code by delaying socket charging until program is ready and
its size is known
