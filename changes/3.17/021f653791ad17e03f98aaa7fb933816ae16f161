irqchip: gic-v3: Initial support for GICv3

The Generic Interrupt Controller (version 3) offers services that are
similar to GICv2, with a number of additional features:
- Affinity routing based on the CPU MPIDR (ARE)
- System register for the CPU interfaces (SRE)
- Support for more that 8 CPUs
- Locality-specific Peripheral Interrupts (LPIs)
- Interrupt Translation Services (ITS)

This patch adds preliminary support for GICv3 with ARE and SRE,
non-secure mode only. It relies on higher exception levels to grant ARE
and SRE access.

Support for LPI and ITS will be added at a later time.
