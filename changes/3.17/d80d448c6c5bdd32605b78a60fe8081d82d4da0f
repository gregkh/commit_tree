ext4: fix same-dir rename when inline data directory overflows

When performing a same-directory rename, it's possible that adding or
setting the new directory entry will cause the directory to overflow
the inline data area, which causes the directory to be converted to an
extent-based directory.  Under this circumstance it is necessary to
re-read the directory when deleting the old dirent because the "old
directory" context still points to i_block in the inode table, which
is now an extent tree root!  The delete fails with an FS error, and
the subsequent fsck complains about incorrect link counts and
hardlinked directories.

Test case (originally found with flat_dir_test in the metadata_csum
test program):

# mkfs.ext4 -O inline_data /dev/sda
# mount /dev/sda /mnt
# mkdir /mnt/x
# touch /mnt/x/changelog.gz /mnt/x/copyright /mnt/x/README.Debian
# sync
# for i in /mnt/x/*; do mv $i $i.longer; done
# ls -la /mnt/x/

(Hey!  Why are there four files now??)
