hwmon: (lm77) Prevent overflow problem when writing large limits

On platforms with sizeof(int) < sizeof(long), writing a temperature
limit larger than MAXINT will result in unpredictable limit values
written to the chip.
Clamp the input values to the supported limits first to fix the problem.

For set_temp_hyst:
As Guenter pointed out that the temperature is read as unsigned and stored in
an unsigned long. This is wrong; nothing in the datasheet suggests that the
value (the absolute temperature) must be positive.
So change it to signed.
