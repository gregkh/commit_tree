usb: dbgp gadget: fix use after free in dbgp_unbind()

After dbgp_bind()-dbgp_unbind() cycle happens, static variable dbgp
contains pointers to already deallocated memory (dbgp.serial and dbgp.req).
If the next dbgp_bind() fails, for example in usb_ep_alloc_request(),
dbgp_bind() calls dbgp_unbind() on failure path,
and dbgp_unbind() frees dbgp.serial that still stores a pointer
to already deallocated memory.

The patch sets pointers to NULL in dbgp_unbind().
