KVM: emulate: do not initialize memopp

rip_relative is only set if decode_modrm runs, and if you have ModRM
you will also have a memopp.  We can then access memopp unconditionally.
Note that rip_relative cannot be hoisted up to decode_modrm, or you
break "mov $0, xyz(%rip)".

Also, move typecast on "out of range value" of mem.ea to decode_modrm.

Together, all these optimizations save about 50 cycles on each emulated
instructions (4-6%).
