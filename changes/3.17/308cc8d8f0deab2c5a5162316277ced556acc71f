checkpatch: fix false positives for --strict "space after cast" test

Commit 89da401f6cff ("checkpatch: improve "no space after cast" test")
in -next improved the cast test for non pointer types, but also
introduced false positives for some types of static inlines.

Add a test for an open brace to the exclusions to avoid these false
positives.
