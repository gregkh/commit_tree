ARM: 8083/1: exynos: activate the CCI on boot CPU/cluster using the MCPM loopback

The Chromebook firmware doesn't enable the CCI for the boot cpu, and
arguably it shouldn't have to either. Let's have the kernel handle the

CCI on its own for the boot CPU the same way it does it for secondary CPUs
by using the MCPM loopback.

This allows to boot all 8 cores on exynos5420-peach-pit,
exynos5800-peach-pi and ARM Chromebook 2.
