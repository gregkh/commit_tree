block: Fix BUG_ON when pi errors occur

When getting a pi error we get to bio_integrity_end_io with
bi_remaining already decremented to 0 where we will eventually
need to call bio_endio with restored original bio completion handler.
Calling bio_endio invokes a BUG_ON(). We should call bio_endio_nodec
instead, like what is done in bio_integrity_verify_fn.
