drm: make minor->index available early

Instead of allocating the minor-index during registration, we now do this
during allocation. This way, debug-messages between minor-allocation and
minor-registration will now use the correct minor instead of 0. Same is
done for unregistration vs. free, so debug-messages between
device-shutdown and device-destruction show proper indices.

Even though minor-indices are allocated early, we don't enable minor
lookup early. Instead, we keep the entry set to NULL and replace it during
registration / unregistration. This way, the index is allocated but lookup
only works if registered.
