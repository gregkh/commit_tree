of: Move CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC code into a separate file

Split the dynamic device tree code into a separate file to make it
really clear what features CONFIF_OF_DYNAMIC add to the kernel. Without
CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC only properties can be changed, and notifiers do not
get sent. Enabling it turns on reference counting, notifiers and the
ability to add and remove nodes.

v2: Moved of_node_release() into dynamic.c
