ftrace: Do no disable function tracing on enabling function tracing

When function tracing is being updated function_trace_stop is set to
keep from tracing the updates. This was fine when function tracing
was done from stop machine. But it is no longer done that way and
this can cause real tracing to be missed.

Remove it.
