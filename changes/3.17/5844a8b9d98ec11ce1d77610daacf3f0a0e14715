regmap: Fix handling of volatile registers for format_write() chips

A previous over-zealous factorisation of code means that we only treat
registers as volatile if they are readable. For most devices this is fine
since normally most registers can be read and volatility implies
readability but for format_write() devices where there is no readback from
the hardware and we use volatility to mean simply uncacheability this means
that we end up treating all registers as cacheble.

A bigger refactoring of the code to clarify this is in order but as a fix
make a minimal change and only check readability when checking volatility
if there is no format_write() operation defined for the device.
