drbd: fix drbd_destroy_device reference count updates

drbd_destroy_device means to give up reference counts
on the connection(s) reachable via the peer_device(s).

It must not do that by iterating via device->resource->connections,
resource and connections may have already been disassociated
by drbd_free_resource, and we'd leak connection refs.

Instead, iterate via device->peer_devices->connection.
