MIPS: smp-cps: Fix entry code cache flush for systems with coherent I/O

The dma_cache_wback_inv function performs exactly as is required here,
unless the system has coherent I/O in which case it's a no-op. Call the
underlying cache writeback functions directly, which is arguably clearer
anyway given that the code doesn't actually have anything to do with
DMA in a strict sense.
