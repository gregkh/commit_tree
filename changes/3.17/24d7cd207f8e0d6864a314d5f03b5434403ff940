mm, hugetlb_cgroup: align hugetlb cgroup limit to hugepage size

Memcg aligns memory.limit_in_bytes to PAGE_SIZE as part of the resource
counter since it makes no sense to allow a partial page to be charged.

As a result of the hugetlb cgroup using the resource counter, it is also
aligned to PAGE_SIZE but makes no sense unless aligned to the size of
the hugepage being limited.

Align hugetlb cgroup limit to hugepage size.
