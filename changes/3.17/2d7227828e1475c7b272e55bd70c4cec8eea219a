percpu-refcount: implement percpu_ref_reinit() and percpu_ref_is_zero()

Now that explicit invocation of percpu_ref_exit() is necessary to free
the percpu counter, we can implement percpu_ref_reinit() which
reinitializes a released percpu_ref.  This can be used implement
scalable gating switch which can be drained and then re-opened without
worrying about memory allocation failures.

percpu_ref_is_zero() is added to be used in a sanity check in
percpu_ref_exit().  As this function will be useful for other purposes
too, make it a public interface.

v2: Use smp_read_barrier_depends() instead of smp_load_acquire().  We
    only need data dep barrier and smp_load_acquire() is stronger and
    heavier on some archs.  Spotted by Lai Jiangshan.
