i40evf: don't leak queue vectors

Fix a memory leak. Driver was allocating memory for queue vectors on
init but not freeing them on shutdown. These need to be freed at two
different times: during module unload, and during reset recovery when
the driver cannot contact the PF driver and needs to give up.
