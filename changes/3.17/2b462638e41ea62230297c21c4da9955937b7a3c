ocfs2: do not write error flag to user structure we cannot copy from/to

If we failed to copy from the structure, writing back the flags leaks 31
bits of kernel memory (the rest of the ir_flags field).

In any case, if we cannot copy from/to the structure, why should we
expect putting just the flags to work?

Also make sure ocfs2_info_handle_freeinode() returns the right error
code if the copy_to_user() fails.
