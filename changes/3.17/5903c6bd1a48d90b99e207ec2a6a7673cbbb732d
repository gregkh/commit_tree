xen/gntalloc: safely delete grefs in add_grefs() undo path

If a gref could not be added (perhaps because the limit has been
reached or there are no more grant references available), the undo
path may crash because __del_gref() frees the gref while it is being
used for a list iteration.

A comment suggests that using list_for_each_entry() is safe since the
gref isn't removed from the list being iterated over, but it is freed
and thus list_for_each_entry_safe() must be used.

Also, explicitly delete the gref from the local per-file list, even
though this is not strictly necessary.
