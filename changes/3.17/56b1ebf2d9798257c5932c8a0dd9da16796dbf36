dm switch: efficiently support repetitive patterns

Add support for quickly loading a repetitive pattern into the
dm-switch target.

In the "set_regions_mappings" message, the user may now use "Rn,m" as
one of the arguments.  "n" and "m" are hexadecimal numbers.  The "Rn,m"
argument repeats the last "n" arguments in the following "m" slots.

For example:
dmsetup message switch 0 set_region_mappings 1000:1 :2 R2,10
is equivalent to
dmsetup message switch 0 set_region_mappings 1000:1 :2 :1 :2 :1 :2 :1 :2 \
:1 :2 :1 :2 :1 :2 :1 :2 :1 :2
