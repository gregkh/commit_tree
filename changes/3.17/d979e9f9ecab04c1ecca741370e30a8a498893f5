USB: serial: fix potential stack buffer overflow

Make sure to verify the maximum number of endpoints per type to avoid
writing beyond the end of a stack-allocated array.

The current usb-serial implementation is limited to eight ports per
interface but failed to verify that the number of endpoints of a certain
type reported by a device did not exceed this limit.
