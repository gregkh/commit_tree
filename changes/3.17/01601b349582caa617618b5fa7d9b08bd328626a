ARM: EXYNOS: Fix suspend/resume sequences

Due to recent consolidation of Exynos suspend and cpuidle code, some
parts of suspend and resume sequences are executed two times, once from
exynos_pm_syscore_ops and then from exynos_cpu_pm_notifier() and thus it
breaks suspend, at least on Exynos4-based boards. In addition, simple
core power down from a cpuidle driver could, in case of CPU 0 could
result in calling functions that are specific to suspend and deeper idle
states.

This patch fixes the issue by moving those operations outside the CPU PM
notifier into suspend and AFTR code paths. This leads to a bit of code
duplication, but allows additional code simplification, so in the end
more code is removed than added.
