efi: Autoload efivars

The original patch is from Ben Hutchings's contribution to debian
kernel. Got Ben's permission to remove the code of efi-pstore.c and
send to linux-efi:
https://github.com/BlankOn/linux-debian/blob/master/debian/patches/features/all/efi-autoload-efivars.patch

efivars is generally useful to have on EFI systems, and in some cases
it may be impossible to load it after a kernel upgrade in order to
complete a boot loader update. At the same time we don't want to waste
memory on non-EFI systems by making them built-in.

Instead, give them module aliases as if they are platform drivers, and
register a corresponding platform device whenever EFI runtime services
are available.  This should trigger udev to load them.
