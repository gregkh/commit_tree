staging/lustre/mgc: replace hard-coded MGC_ENQUEUE_LIMIT value

During client mount, the client will send an LDLM_ENQUEUE request to
MGS with send delay set to MGC_ENQUEUE_LIMIT, which is hard coded to
50 seconds. On the other hand, the interval for pinger is deduced from
obd_timeout. When obd_timeout is configured for a longer period of
time, so does the pinger. We know that connecting to the secondary MGS
node is triggered by the pinger. Now that we have a longer interval,
the pinger will not be able to try the secondary before the
LDLM_ENQUEUE request fails the mount using the same delay limit.

This code change will replace the hard-coded send delay being
mentioned above with a value that is long enough to give the client a
chance to connect to the secondary MGS if exists.
