net: dnet: Use managed interfaces

This patch introduces the use of managed interfaces like
devm_ioremap_resource and does away with the calls to free the
allocated memory in the probe and remove functions. Also, some
labels and variable are done away with. This fixes a bug as there
was a missing release_mem_region in the remove function.
