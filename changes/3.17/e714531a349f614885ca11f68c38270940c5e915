IB/srp: Fix residual handling

From Documentation/scsi/scsi_mid_low_api.txt: "resid - an LLD should
set this signed integer to the requested transfer length (i.e.
'request_bufflen') less the number of bytes that are actually
transferred."  This means that resid > 0 in case of an underrun and
also that resid < 0 in case of an overrun.  Modify the SRP initiator
code such that it matches this requirement.
