xtensa: fix address checks in dma_{alloc,free}_coherent

Virtual address is translated to the XCHAL_KSEG_CACHED region in the
dma_free_coherent, but is checked to be in the 0...XCHAL_KSEG_SIZE
range.

Change check for end of the range from 'addr >= X' to 'addr > X - 1' to
handle the case of X == 0.

Replace 'if (C) BUG();' construct with 'BUG_ON(C);'.
