[media] ati_remote: Generalize KIND_ACCEL to accept diagonals

Rather than having special code cases for diagonal mouse

cardinal directions to handle arbitrary (x,y) deltas.

The deltas themselves are stored in translation table's "code"
field; this is also progress toward the goal of eliminating
the "value" element entirely.
