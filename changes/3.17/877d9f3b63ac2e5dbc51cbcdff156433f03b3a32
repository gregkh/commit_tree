lib: bitmap: make nbits parameter of bitmap_weight unsigned

The compiler can generate slightly smaller and simpler code when it
knows that "nbits" is non-negative.  Since no-one passes a negative
bit-count, this shouldn't affect the semantics.

I didn't change the return type, since that might change the semantics
of some expression containing a call to bitmap_weight(). Certainly an
int is capable of holding the result.
