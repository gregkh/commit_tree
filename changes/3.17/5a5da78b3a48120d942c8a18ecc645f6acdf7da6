kbuild: kselftest - new make target to build and run kernel selftests

Add a new make target "kselftest" to enable kernel testing. This
new target builds and runs kernel selftests. Running as root is
recommended for a complete test run as some tests don't run when
run by non-root user. Build, install, and boot kernel before
running kselftest on it.
