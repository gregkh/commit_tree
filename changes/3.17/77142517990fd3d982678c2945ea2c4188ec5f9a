shmem: update memory reservation on truncate

A shared anonymous mapping created without MAP_NORESERVE holds memory
reservation for whole range of shmem segment.  Usually there is no way
to change its size, but /proc/<pid>/map_files/...  (available if
CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE=y) allows that.

This patch adjusts the memory reservation in shmem_setattr().
