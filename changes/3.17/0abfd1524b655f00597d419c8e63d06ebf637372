cxgb4: Use FW interface to get BAR0 value

Use the firmware interface to get the BAR0 value since we really don't want
to use the PCI-E Configuration Space Backdoor access which is owned by the
firmware.

Set up PCI-E Memory Window registers using the true values programmed into
BAR registers.  When the PF4 "Master Function" is exported to a Virtual
Machine, the values returned by pci_resource_start() will be for the
synthetic PCI-E Configuration Space and not the real addresses. But we need
to program the PCI-E Memory Window address decoders with the real addresses
that we're going to be using in order to have accesses through the Memory
Windows work.
