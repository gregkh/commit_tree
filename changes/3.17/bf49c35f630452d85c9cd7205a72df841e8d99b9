perf tools: Add cpu to struct thread

Tools may wish to track on which cpu a thread is running.  Add 'cpu' to
struct thread for that purpose.

This will be used to determine the cpu when decoding a per-thread
Instruction Trace.

E.g: Intel PT decoding uses sched_switch events to determine which task
is running on which cpu.  The Intel PT data comes straight from the
hardware which doesn't know about linux threads.
