Bluetooth: Remove auth_type parameter from hci_connect_le()

The auth_type value which gets assigned to hci_conn->auth_type is
something that's only used for BR/EDR connections and is of no value for
LE connections. It makes therefore little sense to pass it to the
hci_connect_le() function. This patch removes the parameter from the
function.
