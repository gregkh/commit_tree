staging: comedi: s626: remove 'get_enable' callback from encoder private data

There are two functions used for the 'get_enable' callback, s626_get_enable_a()
function is used for the channel 0-2 encoders and s626_get_enable_b() is used
for the channel 3-5 encoders.

Refactor the two callbacks into a single s626_get_enable() function and use the
encoder channel number to handle the differenced.

Remove the then unnecessary 'get_enable' member and just call s626_set_enable()
directly.

The 'get_enable' callbacks were not being used by the driver. For now block the
s626_get_enable() function with '#ifdef unused' to prevent a compiler warning.
