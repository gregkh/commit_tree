ktime: Kill non-scalar ktime_t implementation for 2038

The non-scalar ktime_t implementation is basically a timespec
which has to be changed to support dates past 2038 on 32bit
systems.

This patch removes the non-scalar ktime_t implementation, forcing
the scalar s64 nanosecond version on all architectures.

This may have additional performance overhead on some 32bit
systems when converting between ktime_t and timespec structures,
however the majority of 32bit systems (arm and i386) were already
using scalar ktime_t, so no performance regressions will be seen
on those platforms.

On affected platforms, I'm open to finding optimizations, including
avoiding converting to timespecs where possible.

[ tglx: We can now cleanup the ktime_t.tv64 mess, but thats a
  different issue and we can throw a coccinelle script at it ]
