drm/i915: respect the VBT minimum backlight brightness

Historically we've exposed the full backlight PWM duty cycle range to
the userspace, in the name of "mechanism, not policy". However, it turns
out there are both panels and board designs where there is a minimum
duty cycle that is required for proper operation. The minimum duty cycle
is available in the VBT.

The backlight class sysfs interface does not make any promises to the
userspace about the physical meaning of the range
0..max_brightness. Specifically there is no guarantee that 0 means off;
indeed for acpi_backlight 0 usually is not off, but the minimum
acceptable value.

Respect the minimum backlight, and expose the range acceptable to the
hardware as 0..max_brightness to the userspace via the backlight class
device; 0 means the minimum acceptable enabled value. To switch off the
backlight, the user must disable the encoder.

As a side effect, make the backlight class device max brightness and
physical PWM modulation frequency (i.e. max duty cycle)
independent. This allows a follow-up patch to virtualize the max value
exposed to the userspace.
