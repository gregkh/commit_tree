timekeeping: Minor fixup for timespec64->timespec assignment

In the GENERIC_TIME_VSYSCALL_OLD update_vsyscall implementation,
we take the tk_xtime() value, which returns a timespec64, and
store it in a timespec.

This luckily is ok, since the only architectures that use
GENERIC_TIME_VSYSCALL_OLD are ia64 and ppc64, which are both
64 bit systems where timespec64 is the same as a timespec.

Even so, for cleanliness reasons, use the conversion function
to assign the proper type.
