drm/i915: Prefault the entire object on first page fault

Inserting additional PTEs has no side-effect for us as the pfn are fixed
for the entire time the object is resident in the global GTT. The
downside is that we pay the entire cost of faulting the object upon the
first hit, for which we in return receive the benefit of removing the
per-page faulting overhead.
