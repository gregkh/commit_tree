ufs: Logical Unit (LU) command queue depth

Some of the UFS devices may support different number of commands
that can be queued per LU. At the current implementation,
SW configure each of the UFS devices LU's according to the
controller capability.

In this patch the queue depth available per LU is read and updated in
the LU's SW structure.
