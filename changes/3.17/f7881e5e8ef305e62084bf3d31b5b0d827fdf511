ALSA: usb-audio: Respond to suspend and resume callbacks for MIDI input

sound/usb/card.c registers USB suspend and resume but did not previously
kill the input URBs. This means that USB MIDI devices left open across
suspend/resume had non-functional input (output still usually worked,
but it looks like that is another issue). Before this change, we would
get ESHUTDOWN for each of the input URBs at suspend time, killing input.
