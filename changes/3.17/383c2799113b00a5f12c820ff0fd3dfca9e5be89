arm64: Add support for 48-bit VA space with 64KB page configuration

This patch allows support for 3 levels of page tables with 64KB page
configuration allowing 48-bit VA space. The pgd is no longer a full
PAGE_SIZE (PTRS_PER_PGD is 64) and (swapper|idmap)_pg_dir are not fully
populated (pgd_alloc falls back to kzalloc).
