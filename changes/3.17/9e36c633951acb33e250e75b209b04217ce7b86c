alpha: io: implement relaxed accessor macros for writes

write{b,w,l,q}_relaxed are implemented by some architectures in order to
permit memory-mapped I/O writes with weaker barrier semantics than the
non-relaxed variants.

This patch implements these write macros for Alpha, in the same vein as
the relaxed read macros, which are already implemented.
