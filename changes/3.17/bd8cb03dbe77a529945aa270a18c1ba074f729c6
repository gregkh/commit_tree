powerpc: implement vmemmap_list_free()

This patch implements vmemmap_list_free() for vmemmap_free().

The freed entries will be removed from vmemmap_list, and form a freed list,
with next as the header. The next position in the last allocated page is kept
at the list tail.

When allocation, if there are freed entries left, get it from the freed list;
if no freed entries left, get it like before from the last allocated pages.

With this change, realmode_pfn_to_page() also needs to be changed to walk
all the entries in the vmemmap_list, as the virt_addr of the entries might not
be stored in order anymore.

It helps to reuse the memory when continuous doing memory hot-plug/remove
operations, but didn't reclaim the pages already allocated, so the memory usage
will only increase, but won't exceed the value for the largest memory
configuration.
