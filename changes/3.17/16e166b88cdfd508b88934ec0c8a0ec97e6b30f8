tipc: make link mtu easily accessible from socket

Message fragmentation is currently performed at link level, inside
the protection of node_lock. This potentially binds up the sending
link structure for a long time, instead of letting it do other tasks,
such as handle reception of new packets.

In this commit, we make the MTUs of each active link become easily
accessible from the socket level, i.e., without taking any spinlock
or dereferencing the target link pointer. This way, we make it possible
to perform fragmentation in the sending socket, before sending the
whole fragment chain to the link for transport.
