Revert "KVM: x86: Increase the number of fixed MTRR regs to 10"

This reverts commit 682367c494869008eb89ef733f196e99415ae862,
which causes 32-bit SMP Windows 7 guests to panic.

SeaBIOS has a limit on the number of MTRRs that it can handle,
and this patch exceeded the limit.  Better revert it.
Thanks to Nadav Amit for debugging the cause.
