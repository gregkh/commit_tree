ARM64: KVM: store kvm_vcpu_fault_info est_el2 as word

esr_el2 field of struct kvm_vcpu_fault_info has u32 type.
It should be stored as word. Current code works in LE case
because existing puts least significant word of x1 into
esr_el2, and it puts most significant work of x1 into next
field, which accidentally is OK because it is updated again
by next instruction. But existing code breaks in BE case.
