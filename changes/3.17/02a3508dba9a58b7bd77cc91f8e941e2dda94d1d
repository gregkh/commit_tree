nfsd: Convert delegation counter to an atomic_long_t type

We want to convert to an atomic type so that we don't need to lock
across the call to alloc_init_deleg(). Then convert to a long type so
that we match the size of 'max_delegations'.

None of this is a problem today, but it will be once we remove
client_mutex protection.
