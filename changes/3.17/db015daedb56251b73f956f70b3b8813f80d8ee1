sched/numa: Rework best node setting in task_numa_migrate()

Fix up the best node setting in task_numa_migrate() to deal with a task
in a pseudo-interleaved NUMA group, which is already running in the
best location.

Set the task's preferred nid to the current nid, so task migration is
not retried at a high rate.
