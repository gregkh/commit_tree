virtio: rng: add derating factor for use by hwrng core

The khwrngd thread is started when a hwrng device of sufficient
quality is registered.  The virtio-rng device is backed by the
hypervisor, and we trust the hypervisor to provide real entropy.

A malicious or badly-implemented hypervisor is a scenario that's
irrelevant -- such a setup is bound to cause all sorts of badness, and a
compromised hwrng is the least of the user's worries.

Given this, we might as well assume that the quality of randomness we
receive is perfectly trustworthy.  Hence, we use 100% for the factor,
indicating maximum confidence in the source.
