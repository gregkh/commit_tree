regulator: palmas: Fix SMPS enable/disable/is_enable for tps65917

We use regmap regulator ops to enable/disable and check if regulator
is enabled for various SMPS. However, these depend on valid
enable_reg, enable_mask and enable_value in regulator descriptor.

So, similar to fix we did in commit 318dbb02b50c
("regulator: palmas: Fix SMPS enable/disable/is_enabled"), populate the
same for TPS65917 SMPS registration. LDO definitions are already in
place.
