Revert "MIPS: Delete unused function add_temporary_entry."

This reverts commit d7a887a73dec6c387b02a966a71aac767bbd9ce6.

Function add_temporary_entry is needed by bcm47xx to support highmem. We
need to add a temporary entry to check for amount of RAM.
The only change made in this revert was replacing (ENTER|EXIT)_CRITICAL.
