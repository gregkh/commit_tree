sched/numa: Change scan period code to match intent

Reading through the scan period code and comment, it appears the
intent was to slow down NUMA scanning when a majority of accesses
are on the local node, specifically a local:remote ratio of 3:1.

However, the code actually tests local / (local + remote), and
the actual cut-off point was around 30% local accesses, well before
a task has actually converged on a node.

Changing the threshold to 7 means scanning slows down when a task
has around 70% of its accesses local, which appears to match the
intent of the code more closely.
