md/raid1: count resync requests in nr_pending.

Both normal IO and resync IO can be retried with reschedule_retry()
and so be counted into ->nr_queued, but only normal IO gets counted in
->nr_pending.

Before the recent improvement to RAID1 resync there could only
possibly have been one or the other on the queue.  When handling a
read failure it could only be normal IO.  So when handle_read_error()
called freeze_array() the fact that freeze_array only compares
->nr_queued against ->nr_pending was safe.

But now that these two types can interleave, we can have both normal
and resync IO requests queued, so we need to count them both in
nr_pending.

This error can lead to freeze_array() hanging if there is a read
error, so it is suitable for -stable.
