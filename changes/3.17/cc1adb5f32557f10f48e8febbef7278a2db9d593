powerpc/pseries: Use jump labels for hcall tracepoints

hcall tracepoints add quite a few instructions to our hcall path:

plpar_hcall:
	mr      r2,r2
	mfcr    r0
	stw     r0,8(r1)
	b       164		<---- start
	ld      r12,0(r2)
	std     r12,32(r1)
	cmpdi   r12,0
	beq     164		<---- end
...

We have an unconditional branch that gets noped out during boot and
a load/compare/branch. We also store the tracepoint value to the
stack for the hcall_exit path to use.

By using jump labels we can simplify this to just a single nop that
gets replaced with a branch when the tracepoint is enabled:

plpar_hcall:
	mr      r2,r2
	mfcr    r0
	stw     r0,8(r1)
	nop			<----
...

If jump labels are not enabled, we fall back to the old method.
