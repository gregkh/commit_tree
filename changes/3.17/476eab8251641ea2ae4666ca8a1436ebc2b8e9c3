net: remove inet6_reqsk_alloc

Since pktops is only used for IPv6 only and opts is used for IPv4
only, we can move these fields into a union and this allows us to drop
the inet6_reqsk_alloc function as after this change it becomes
equivalent with inet_reqsk_alloc.

This patch also fixes a kmemcheck issue in the IPv6 stack: the flags
field was not annotated after a request_sock was allocated.
