nfsd: don't destroy clients that are busy

It's possible that we'll have an in-progress call on some of the clients
while a rogue EXCHANGE_ID or DESTROY_CLIENTID call comes in. Be sure to
try and mark the client expired first, so that the refcount is
respected.

This will only be a problem once the client_mutex is removed.
