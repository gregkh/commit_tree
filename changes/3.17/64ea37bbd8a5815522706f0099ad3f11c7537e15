[media] au0828: Only alt setting logic when needed

It seems that there's a bug at au0828 hardware/firmware
related to alternate setting: when the device is already at
alt 5, a further call causes the URBs to receive -ESHUTDOWN.

I found two different encarnations of this issue:

1) at qv4l2, it fails the second time we try to open the
video screen;
2) at xawtv, when audio underrun occurs, with is very
frequent, at least on my test machine.

The fix is simple: just check if alt=5 before calling
set_usb_interface().
