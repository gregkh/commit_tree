gpio: Add support for GPIOF_ACTIVE_LOW to gpio_request_one functions

The gpio include file and the gpio documentation declare and document
GPIOF_ACTIVE_LOW as one of the flags to be passed to gpio_request_one
and related functions. However, the flag is not evaluated or used.

This can cause problems in at least two areas: First, the same API can
be used to auto-export pins to user space. The missing support for
GPIOF_ACTIVE_LOW results in unexpected behavior for such auto-exported
pins. Second, the requested gpio pin can be convered for use by
gpiod functions with gpio_to_desc(). While gpio API functions do not
support GPIOF_ACTIVE_LOW, gpiod functions do, which again results in
unexpected behavior.

Check the flag in gpio_request_one and set the gpio internal flag
FLAG_ACTIVE_LOW if it is set to address those problems.
