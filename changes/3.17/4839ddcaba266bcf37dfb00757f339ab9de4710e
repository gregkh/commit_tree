crypto: ccp - Remove "select OF" from Kconfig

The addition of the "select OF if ARM64" has led to a Kconfig
recursive dependency error when "make ARCH=sh rsk7269_defconfig"
was run.  Since OF is selected by ARM64 and the of_property_read_bool
is defined no matter what, delete the Kconfig line that selects OF.
