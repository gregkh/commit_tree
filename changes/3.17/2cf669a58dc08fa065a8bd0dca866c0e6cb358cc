cgroup: replace cgroup_add_cftypes() with cgroup_add_legacy_cftypes()

Currently, cftypes added by cgroup_add_cftypes() are used for both the
unified default hierarchy and legacy ones and subsystems can mark each
file with either CFTYPE_ONLY_ON_DFL or CFTYPE_INSANE if it has to
appear only on one of them.  This is quite hairy and error-prone.
Also, we may end up exposing interface files to the default hierarchy
without thinking it through.

cgroup_subsys will grow two separate cftype addition functions and
apply each only on the hierarchies of the matching type.  This will
allow organizing cftypes in a lot clearer way and encourage subsystems
to scrutinize the interface which is being exposed in the new default
hierarchy.

In preparation, this patch adds cgroup_add_legacy_cftypes() which
currently is a simple wrapper around cgroup_add_cftypes() and replaces
all cgroup_add_cftypes() usages with it.

While at it, this patch drops a completely spurious return from
__hugetlb_cgroup_file_init().

This patch doesn't introduce any functional differences.
