usb: phy: phy-gpio-vbus-usb: use devm_ functions

The various devm_ functions allocate memory that is released when a
driver detaches.  This patch uses devm_kzalloc, devm_request_irq,
devm_gpio_request, devm_regulator_get etc. for data that is
allocated in the probe function of a platform device and is only
freed in the remove function. The corresponding free functions are
removed and the labels are done away with.
