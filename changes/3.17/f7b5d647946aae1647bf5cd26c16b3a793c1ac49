mm: page_alloc: abort fair zone allocation policy when remotes nodes are encountered

The purpose of numa_zonelist_order=zone is to preserve lower zones for
use with 32-bit devices.  If locality is preferred then the
numa_zonelist_order=node policy should be used.

Unfortunately, the fair zone allocation policy overrides this by
skipping zones on remote nodes until the lower one is found.  While this
makes sense from a page aging and performance perspective, it breaks the
expected zonelist policy.  This patch restores the expected behaviour
for zone-list ordering.
