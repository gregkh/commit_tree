i40evf: Fixed guest OS panic when removing vf driver

Removing VF driver during device still in reset caused guest OS panic.

in the i40evf_remove(), we're trying to clean mac_filter_list which has
not been initialized since the device is still stuck at the reset.
The change is to initialize the filter_list before setting any task.
