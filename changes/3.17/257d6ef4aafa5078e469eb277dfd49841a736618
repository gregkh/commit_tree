Documentation: i2c: rename variable "register" to "reg"

The example code provided with the i2c device interface documentation
won't compile since it uses the reserved word "register" to name a
variable.

The compiler fails with this error message:

 error: expected identifier or '(' before '=' token
   __u8 register = 0x20; /* Device register to access */
                 ^

Rename the variable "register" to simply "reg" in the example code.

Another couple of typos has been fixed as well.
[Change "! =" to "!=".]
