net: fec: quiesce packet processing before stopping device in fec_set_features()

fec_set_features() calls fec_stop() to stop the transmit ring while the
transmit queue is still active.  This can lead to the transmit ring
being restarted by an intervening packet queued for transmission, or
by the tx quirk timer expiring.

Fix this by disabling NAPI (which ensures that the NAPI handlers are
not running), and then take the transmit lock while we stop and
restart the adapter (which prevents new packets being queued).
