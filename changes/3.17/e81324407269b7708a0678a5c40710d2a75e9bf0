proc: Point /proc/net at /proc/thread-self/net instead of /proc/self/net

In oddball cases where the thread has a different network namespace
than the primary thread group leader or more likely in cases where
the thread remains and the thread group leader has exited this
ensures that /proc/net continues to work.

This should not cause any problems but if it does this patch can just
be reverted.
