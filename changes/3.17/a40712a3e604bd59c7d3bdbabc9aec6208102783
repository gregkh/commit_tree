ASoC: samsung: Add machine driver for Odroid X2/U3

This patch adds the sound subsystem driver for Odroid-X2 and
Odroid-U3 boards. The codec works in I2S master mode; there
are two separate audio routing paths defined, as there are
differences in the signal routing between the X2 and U3 boards,
i.e. U3 uses single jack for headphones and microphone.
