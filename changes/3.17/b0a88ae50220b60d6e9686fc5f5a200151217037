MIPS: GIC: Remove GIC_FLAG_IPI

irq-gic.c:gic_get_int() masks out interrupts from the pending set which
arenâ€™t in the pcpu_mask. Only interrupts marked with GIC_FLAG_IPI were
set in pcpu_mask, meaning that peripheral interrupts also had to be
marked as IPIs. Remove the use of GIC_FLAG_IPI and allow the flags
member of struct gic_intr_map to be zero.
