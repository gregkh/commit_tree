bnx2i/bnx2fc : fix randconfig error in next-20140909

Just like CNIC, tristate of these two modules is also dependent on IPV6.
These need to be handled separately as they select CNIC, which can override
tristate for CNIC from 'm' to 'y', which can cause build failures when ipv6 is
 compiled as a module even if CNIC's Kconfig will only 'm' or 'n' when ipv6 is
compiled as a module.
