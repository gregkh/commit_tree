tracing/uprobes: Kill the dead TRACE_EVENT_FL_USE_CALL_FILTER logic

alloc_trace_uprobe() sets TRACE_EVENT_FL_USE_CALL_FILTER for unknown
reason and this is simply wrong. Fortunately this has no effect because
register_uprobe_event() clears call->flags after that.

Kill both. This trace_uprobe was kzalloc'ed and we rely on this fact
anyway.
