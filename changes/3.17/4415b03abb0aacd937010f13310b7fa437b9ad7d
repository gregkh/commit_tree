dmaengine: shdma: Allocate cyclic sg list dynamically

The sg list used to prepare cyclic DMA descriptors is currently
allocated statically on the stack as an array of 32 elements. This makes
the shdma_prep_dma_cyclic() function consume a lot of stack space, as
reported by the compiler:

drivers/dma/sh/shdma-base.c: In function ‘shdma_prep_dma_cyclic’:
drivers/dma/sh/shdma-base.c:715:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes
is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

Given the limited Linux kernel stack size, this could lead to stack
overflows. Fix the problem by allocating the sg list dynamically.
