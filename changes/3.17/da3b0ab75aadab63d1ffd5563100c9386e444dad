platform/chrome: chromeos_laptop - Add support for Acer C720

Acer C720 has touchpad and light sensor connected to a separate I2C buses.
Since the designware I2C host controller driver has two instances on this
particular machine we need a way to match the correct instance. Add support
for this and then register both C720 touchpad and light sensor.

This code is based on following patch from Benson Leung:
