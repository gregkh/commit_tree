tipc: make name table distributor use new send function

In a previous commit series ("tipc: new unicast transmission code")
we introduced a new message sending function, tipc_link_xmit2(),
and moved the unicast data users over to use that function. We now
let the internal name table distributor do the same.

The interaction between the name distributor and the node/link
layer also becomes significantly simpler, so we can eliminate
the function tipc_link_names_xmit().
