serial: tegra: ack the rx dma desc after transfer terminated

The Rx dma descriptor allocated without the DMA_ACK flags so that
once after tarnsfer done or terminated, client can ack the descriptor
to free it for later use.

If the Rx DMA is terminated for some reason then rx-dma descriptor
is not getting acked which causes the memory leak and list of usage
desc to grow continuously.

Hence, acknowledge the rx-dma descriptor once transfer is terminated
to avoid memory leak and desc list to grow.
