nfsd: silence sparse warning about accessing credentials

sparse says:

    fs/nfsd/auth.c:31:38: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
    fs/nfsd/auth.c:31:38:    expected struct cred const *cred
    fs/nfsd/auth.c:31:38:    got struct cred const [noderef] <asn:4>*real_cred

Add a new accessor for the ->real_cred and use that to fetch the
pointer. Accessing current->real_cred directly is actually quite safe
since we know that they can't go away so this is mostly a cosmetic fixup
to silence sparse.
