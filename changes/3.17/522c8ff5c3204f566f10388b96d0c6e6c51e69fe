ARM: dts: Sort nodes within Peach-pit/Peach-pi dts files

Peach-pit and Peach-pi boards are almost similar, hence the DTS file
is also very similar. Sorting nodes in both these files will allow
us to figure out the difference easily.

All the node aliases are sorted in alphabetically increasing order.
There is no functional change with this patch.
