drm: make sysfs device always available for minors

For each minor we allocate a sysfs device as minor->kdev. Currently, this
is allocated and registered in drm_minor_register(). This makes it
impossible to add sysfs-attributes to the device before it is registered.
Therefore, they are not added atomically, nor can we move device_add()
*after* ->load() is called.

This patch makes minor->kdev available early, but only adds the device
during minor-registration. Note that the registration is still called
before ->load() as debugfs needs to be split, too. This will be fixed in
follow-ups.
