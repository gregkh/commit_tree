bonding: fix bond_option_mode_set warning

During the conversion to "static" functions this one got left out, only its
prototype was converted, thus resulting in:
drivers/net/bonding//bond_options.c:674:5: warning: symbol
'bond_option_mode_set' was not declared. Should it be static?

Fix it by making it static and also break the line in two as it was too
long.
