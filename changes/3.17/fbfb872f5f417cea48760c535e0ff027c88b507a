ARM: 8148/1: flush TLS and thumbee register state during exec

The TPIDRURO and TPIDRURW registers need to be flushed during exec;
otherwise TLS information is potentially leaked.  TPIDRURO in
particular needs careful treatment.  Since flush_thread basically
needs the same code used to set the TLS in arm_syscall, pull that into
a common set_tls helper in tls.h and use it in both places.

Similarly, TEEHBR needs to be cleared during exec as well.  Clearing
its save slot in thread_info isn't right as there is no guarantee
that a thread switch will occur before the new program runs.  Just
setting the register directly is sufficient.
