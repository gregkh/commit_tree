staging: vt6556: Remove typedefs

This patch removes uneeded typedefs reported by chackpatch and removes
one enum that is not in use. As checkpatch complained about the typedef
and the enum is not being used, this patch removes both typedef and enum.
The removed enum from card.h:

typedef enum _CARD_PHY_TYPE {
    PHY_TYPE_AUTO = 0,
    PHY_TYPE_11B,
    PHY_TYPE_11G,
    PHY_TYPE_11A
} CARD_PHY_TYPE, *PCARD_PHY_TYPE;

The following typedefs were removed, but enums were kept at device.h:

 typedef enum __device_msg_level
 typedef enum __DEVICE_NDIS_STATUS

Tested by compilation only.
