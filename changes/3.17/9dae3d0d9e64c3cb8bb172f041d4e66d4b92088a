apei, mce: Factor out APEI architecture specific MCE calls.

This commit abstracts MCE calls and provides weak corresponding default
implementation for those architectures which do not need arch specific
actions. Each platform willing to do additional architectural actions
should provides desired function definition. It allows us to avoid wrap
code into #ifdef in generic code and prevent new platform from introducing
dummy stub function too.

Initially, there are two APEI arch-specific calls:
- arch_apei_enable_cmcff()
- arch_apei_report_mem_error()
Both interact with MCE driver for X86 architecture.
