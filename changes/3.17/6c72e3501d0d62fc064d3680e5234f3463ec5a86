perf: fix perf bug in fork()

Oleg noticed that a cleanup by Sylvain actually uncovered a bug; by
calling perf_event_free_task() when failing sched_fork() we will not yet
have done the memset() on ->perf_event_ctxp[] and will therefore try and
'free' the inherited contexts, which are still in use by the parent
process.  This is bad..
