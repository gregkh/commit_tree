regmap: Fix regcache debugfs initialization

Commit 6cfec04bcc05 ("regmap: Separate regmap dev initialization") moved the
regmap debugfs initialization after regcache initialization. This means
that the regmap debugfs directory is not created yet when the cache
initialization runs and so any debugfs files registered by the regcache are
created in the debugfs root directory rather than the debugfs directory of
the regmap instance. Fix this by adding a separate callback for the
regcache debugfs initialization which will be called after the parent
debugfs entry has been created.
