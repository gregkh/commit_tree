NFS: Fix /proc/fs/nfsfs/servers and /proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes

The usage of pid_ns->child_reaper->nsproxy->net_ns in
nfs_server_list_open and nfs_client_list_open is not safe.

/proc for a pid namespace can remain mounted after the all of the
process in that pid namespace have exited.  There are also times
before the initial process in a pid namespace has started or after the
initial process in a pid namespace has exited where
pid_ns->child_reaper can be NULL or stale.  Making the idiom
pid_ns->child_reaper->nsproxy a double whammy of problems.

Luckily all that needs to happen is to move /proc/fs/nfsfs/servers and
/proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes under /proc/net to /proc/net/nfsfs/servers and
/proc/net/nfsfs/volumes and add a symlink from the original location,
and to use seq_open_net as it has been designed.
