Revert "drm/i915: Enable semaphores on BDW"

This reverts commit 521e62e49a42661a4ee0102644517dbe2f100a23.

Although POST_SYNC brought a bit of stability to Semaphores on BDW
it didn't solved all issues and some hungs can still occour when
semaphores are enabled on BDW. Also some sloweness can be found on some
igt tests, althoguth it apparently doesn't affect real workloads.

Besides that, no real performance gain was found on our tests with different
and even multiple workloads.

Let's disable it again for now. At least until we are sure it is safe
to re-enable it.
