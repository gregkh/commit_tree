netfilter: nf_log: use an array of loggers instead of list

Now that legacy ulog targets are not available anymore in the tree, we
can have up to two possible loggers:

1) The plain text logging via kernel logging ring.
2) The nfnetlink_log infrastructure which delivers log messages
   to userspace.

This patch replaces the list of loggers by an array of two pointers
per family for each possible logger and it also introduces a new field
to the nf_logger structure which indicates the position in the logger
array (based on the logger type).

This prepares a follow up patch that consolidates the nf_log_packet()
interface by allowing to specify the logger as parameter.
