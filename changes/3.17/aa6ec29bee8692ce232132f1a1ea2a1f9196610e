cgroup: remove sane_behavior support on non-default hierarchies

sane_behavior has been used as a development vehicle for the default
unified hierarchy.  Now that the default hierarchy is in place, the
flag became redundant and confusing as its usage is allowed on all
hierarchies.  There are gonna be either the default hierarchy or
legacy ones.  Let's make that clear by removing sane_behavior support
on non-default hierarchies.

This patch replaces cgroup_sane_behavior() with cgroup_on_dfl().  The
comment on top of CGRP_ROOT_SANE_BEHAVIOR is moved to on top of
cgroup_on_dfl() with sane_behavior specific part dropped.

On the default and legacy hierarchies w/o sane_behavior, this
shouldn't cause any behavior differences.
