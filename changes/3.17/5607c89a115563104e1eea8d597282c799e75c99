HID: sony: Default initialize all elements of the LED max_brightness array to 1

Previously only the first element of the array was initialized to 1
leading to potential incorrect max brightness values for the LEDs
on the Dualshock 3 and buzzer controllers.

Use a designated initializer to initialize the whole array to the
correct value.
