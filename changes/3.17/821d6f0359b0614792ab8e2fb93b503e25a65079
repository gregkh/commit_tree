ACPI / sleep: Do not save NVS for new machines to accelerate S3

NVS region is saved and restored unconditionally for machines without
nvs_nosave quirk during S3. Tested some new machines and the operation
is not necessary. Saving NVS region also affects S2RAM speed. The time of
NVS saving and restoring depends on the size of NVS region and it consumes
7~10ms normally.

This patch is to make machines produced from 2012 to now not saving NVS region
to accelerate S3.
