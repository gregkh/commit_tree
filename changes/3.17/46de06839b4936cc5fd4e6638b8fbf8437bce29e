brcmfmac: Do not use strcpy and strcat

Commit "c1b2053 brcmfmac: Make firmware path a module parameter"
introduced use of strcpy and strcat. The strcpy and strcat require
using null terminated strings and can cause out-of-bounds memory
access and subsequent corruption. This patch replaces these by
strncpy and strncat respectively to assure array boundaries are
not crossed.
