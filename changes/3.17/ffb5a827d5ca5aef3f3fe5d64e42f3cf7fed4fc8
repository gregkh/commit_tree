Bluetooth: Introduce "New Connection Parameter" Event

This patch introduces a new Mgmt event called "New Connection Parameter".
This event indicates to userspace the connection parameters values the
remote device requested.

The user may store these values and load them into kernel. This way, next
time a connection is established to that device, the kernel will use those
parameters values instead of the default ones.

This event is sent when the remote device requests new connection
parameters through connection parameter update procedure. This event is
not sent for slave connections.
