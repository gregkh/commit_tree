irqchip: gic: Move some bits of GICv2 to a library-type file

A few GICv2 low-level function are actually very useful to GICv3,
and it makes some sense to share them across the two drivers.
They end-up in their own file, with an additional parameter used
to ensure an optional synchronization (unused on GICv2).
