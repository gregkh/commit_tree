efi: efistub: Refactor stub components

In order to move from the #include "../../../xxxxx.c" anti-pattern used
by both the x86 and arm64 versions of the stub to a static library
linked into either the kernel proper (arm64) or a separate boot
executable (x86), there is some prepatory work required.

This patch does the following:
- move forward declarations of functions shared between the arch
  specific and the generic parts of the stub to include/linux/efi.h
- move forward declarations of functions shared between various .c files
  of the generic stub code to a new local header file called "efistub.h"
- add #includes to all .c files which were formerly relying on the
  #includor to include the correct header files
- remove all static modifiers from functions which will need to be
  externally visible once we move to a static library
