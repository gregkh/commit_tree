KVM: PPC: Book3S: Make magic page properly 4k mappable

The magic page is defined as a 4k page of per-vCPU data that is shared
between the guest and the host to accelerate accesses to privileged
registers.

However, when the host is using 64k page size granularity we weren't quite
as strict about that rule anymore. Instead, we partially treated all of the
upper 64k as magic page and mapped only the uppermost 4k with the actual
magic contents.

This works well enough for Linux which doesn't use any memory in kernel
space in the upper 64k, but Mac OS X got upset. So this patch makes magic
page actually stay in a 4k range even on 64k page size hosts.

This patch fixes magic page usage with Mac OS X (using MOL) on 64k PAGE_SIZE
hosts for me.
