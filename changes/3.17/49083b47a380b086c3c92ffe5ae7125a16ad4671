b43: N-PHY: update generic rev7+ workarounds

Add some missing ops and prepare for new devices support. This patch is
a great stability improvement for BCM43217. Earlier Tenda W322E used to
disconnect every 2 minutes (16 times over 30 minutes). With this fix I
got it running for 4 hours (with iperf) without any disconnection.
