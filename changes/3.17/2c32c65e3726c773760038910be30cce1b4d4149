ARM: 8129/1: errata: work around Cortex-A15 erratum 830321 using dummy strex

On revisions of Cortex-A15 prior to r3p3, a CLREX instruction at PL1 may
falsely trigger a watchpoint exception, leading to potential data aborts
during exception return and/or livelock.

This patch resolves the issue in the following ways:

  - Replacing our uses of CLREX with a dummy STREX sequence instead (as
    we did for v6 CPUs).

  - Removing the clrex code from v7_exit_coherency_flush and derivatives,
    since this only exists as a minor performance improvement when
    non-cached exclusives are in use (Linux doesn't use these).

Benchmarking on a variety of ARM cores revealed no measurable
performance difference with this change applied, so the change is
performed unconditionally and no new Kconfig entry is added.
