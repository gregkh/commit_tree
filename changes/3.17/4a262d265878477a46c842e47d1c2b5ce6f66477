mm tracing: tell mm_migrate_pages event about numa_misplaced

The mm_migrate_pages trace event reports a reason for the migration,
typically as a symbolic string.  The exception is the reason
MR_NUMA_MISPLACED for which it just displays the numeric value:
mm_migrate_pages: nr_succeeded=1 nr_failed=0 mode=MIGRATE_ASYNC
reason=0x5

This patch makes the output consistent by introducing a string value for
MR_NUMA_MISPLACED.  The event is then reported as: mm_migrate_pages:
nr_succeeded=1 nr_failed=0 mode=MIGRATE_ASYNC reason=numa_misplaced
