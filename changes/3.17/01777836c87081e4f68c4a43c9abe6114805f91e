reiserfs: Fix use after free in journal teardown

If do_journal_release() races with do_journal_end() which requeues
delayed works for transaction flushing, we can leave work items for
flushing outstanding transactions queued while freeing them. That
results in use after free and possible crash in run_timers_softirq().

Fix the problem by not requeueing works if superblock is being shut down
(MS_ACTIVE not set) and using cancel_delayed_work_sync() in
do_journal_release().
