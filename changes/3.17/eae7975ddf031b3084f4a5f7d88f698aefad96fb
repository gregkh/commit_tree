percpu-refcount: add helpers for ->percpu_count accesses

* All four percpu_ref_*() operations implemented in the header file
  perform the same operation to determine whether the percpu_ref is
  alive and extract the percpu pointer.  Factor out the common logic
  into __pcpu_ref_alive().  This doesn't change the generated code.

* There are a couple places in percpu-refcount.c which masks out
  PCPU_REF_DEAD to obtain the percpu pointer.  Factor it out into
  pcpu_count_ptr().

* The above changes make the WARN_ON_ONCE() conditional at the top of
  percpu_ref_kill_and_confirm() the only user of REF_STATUS().  Test
  PCPU_REF_DEAD directly and remove REF_STATUS().

This patch doesn't introduce any functional change.
