xfs: fix swapext ilock deadlock

xfs_swap_extents() holds the ilock over a call to
filemap_write_and_wait(), which can then try to write data and take
the ilock. That causes a self-deadlock.

Fix the deadlock and clean up the code by separating the locking
appropriately. Add a lockflags variable to track what locks we are
holding as we gain and drop them and cleanup the error handling to
always use "out_unlock" with the lockflags variable.
