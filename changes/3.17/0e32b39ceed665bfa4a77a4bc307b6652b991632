drm/i915: add DP 1.2 MST support (v0.7)

This adds DP 1.2 MST support on Haswell systems.

Notes:
a) this reworks irq handling for DP MST ports, so that we can
avoid the mode config locking in the current hpd handlers, as
we need to process up/down msgs at a better time.

Changes since v0.1:
use PORT_PCH_HOTPLUG to detect short vs long pulses
add a workqueue to deal with digital events as they can get blocked on the
main workqueue beyong mode_config mutex
fix a bunch of modeset checker warnings
acks irqs in the driver
cleanup the MST encoders

Changes since v0.2:
check irq status again in work handler
move around bring up and tear down to fix DPMS on/off
use path properties.

Changes since v0.3:
updates for mst apis
more state checker fixes
irq handling improvements
fbcon handling support
improved reference counting of link - fixes redocking.

Changes since v0.4:
handle gpu reset hpd reinit without oopsing
check link status on HPD irqs
fix suspend/resume

Changes since v0.5:
use proper functions to get max link/lane counts
fix another checker backtrace - due to connectors disappearing.
set output type in more places fro, unknown->displayport
don't talk to devices if no HPD asserted
check mst on short irqs only
check link status properly
rebase onto prepping irq changes.
drop unsued force_act

Changes since v0.6:
cleanup unused struct entry.
