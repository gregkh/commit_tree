drm/i915: Support pf CRC source on haswell transcoder edp

The always-on power well pixel path on haswell is routed such that it
bypasses the panel fitter when we use is. Which means the pfit CRC
source won't work in that configuration.

Add a new disallow-bypass flags to the pfit pipe config state and set
it when we want to use the pf CRC. Results in a bit of flicker, but
should get the job done. We'll also undo do it afterwards to make sure
other tests arent' negatively affected.

Totally untested due to lack of hsw laptops around here.

v2: s/disallow_bypass/force_power_well_on/ to avoid a double negative
(Damien).

v3: force_thru because roadsigns.

v4: Don't forget the power wells! Also note that until the runtime pm
for DPMS series is fully merged the simple disable/enable trick won't
work since the ->crtc_mode_set callback is still required to do nasty
things. This stuff is tricky, but I think by both fixing up
get_crtc_power_domains and the debugfs wa code we should always
grab/drop the additional power well correctly.

v5: Wrap in () as suggested by Damien to avoid setting reserved values
for the edp transcoder path on bdw+
