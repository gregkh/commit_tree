x86: don't exclude low BIOS area when allocating address space for non-PCI cards

Commit 30919b0bf356 ("x86: avoid low BIOS area when allocating address
space") moved the test for resource allocations that fall within the first
1MB of address space from the PCI-specific path to a generic path, such
that all resource allocations will avoid this area.  However, this breaks
ISA cards which need to allocate a memory region within the first 1MB.  An
example is the i82365 PCMCIA controller and derivatives like the Ricoh
RF5C296/396 which map part of the PCMCIA socket memory address space into
the first 1MB of system memory address space.  They do not work anymore as
no usable memory region exists due to this change:

  Intel ISA PCIC probe: Ricoh RF5C296/396 ISA-to-PCMCIA at port 0x3e0 ofs 0x00, 2 sockets
  host opts [0]: none
  host opts [1]: none
  ISA irqs (scanned) = 3,4,5,9,10 status change on irq 10

If filtering out the first 1MB is reverted, everything works as expected.
