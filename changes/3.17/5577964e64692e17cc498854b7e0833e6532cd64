cgroup: rename cgroup_subsys->base_cftypes to ->legacy_cftypes

Currently, cgroup_subsys->base_cftypes is used for both the unified
default hierarchy and legacy ones and subsystems can mark each file
with either CFTYPE_ONLY_ON_DFL or CFTYPE_INSANE if it has to appear
only on one of them.  This is quite hairy and error-prone.  Also, we
may end up exposing interface files to the default hierarchy without
thinking it through.

cgroup_subsys will grow two separate cftype arrays and apply each only
on the hierarchies of the matching type.  This will allow organizing
cftypes in a lot clearer way and encourage subsystems to scrutinize
the interface which is being exposed in the new default hierarchy.

In preparation, this patch renames cgroup_subsys->base_cftypes to
cgroup_subsys->legacy_cftypes.  This patch is pure rename.
