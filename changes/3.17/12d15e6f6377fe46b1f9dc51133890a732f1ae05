serial/arc: Refactor by referencing to uart_port where possible

The ARC UART MMIO helpers would take arc_uart_port and then reference
generic uart_port->membase member. So change them to difrectly refer to
uart_port and fix call sites accordingly.

This removes the need for to_arc_port() converion almost eveeywhere and
makes code a bit easier to read.
