mm: allow drivers to prevent new writable mappings

This patch (of 6):

The i_mmap_writable field counts existing writable mappings of an
address_space.  To allow drivers to prevent new writable mappings, make
this counter signed and prevent new writable mappings if it is negative.
This is modelled after i_writecount and DENYWRITE.

This will be required by the shmem-sealing infrastructure to prevent any
new writable mappings after the WRITE seal has been set.  In case there
exists a writable mapping, this operation will fail with EBUSY.

Note that we rely on the fact that iff you already own a writable mapping,
you can increase the counter without using the helpers.  This is the same
that we do for i_writecount.
