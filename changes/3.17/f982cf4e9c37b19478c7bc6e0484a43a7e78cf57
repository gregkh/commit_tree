KVM: ARM: vgic: revisit implementation of irqchip_in_kernel

So far, irqchip_in_kernel() was implemented by testing the value of
vctrl_base, which worked fine with GICv2.

With GICv3, this field is useless, as we're using system registers
instead of a emmory mapped interface. To solve this, add a boolean
flag indicating if the we're using a vgic or not.
