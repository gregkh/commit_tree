ASoC: dapm: Remove platform field from widget and dapm context struct

The platform field in the snd_soc_dapm_widget and snd_soc_dapm_context structs
is now unused can be removed. New code that wants to get the platform for a
widget or dapm context should use snd_soc_dapm_to_platform(w->dapm) or
snd_soc_dapm_to_platform(dapm).
