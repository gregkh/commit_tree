MIPS: Add NUMA support for Loongson-3

Multiple Loongson-3A chips can be interconnected with HT0-bus. This is
a CC-NUMA system that every chip (node) has its own local memory and
cache coherency is maintained by hardware. The 64-bit physical memory
address format is as follows:

0x-0000-YZZZ-ZZZZ-ZZZZ

The high 16 bits should be 0, which means the real physical address
supported by Loongson-3 is 48-bit. The "Y" bits is the base address of
each node, which can be also considered as the node-id. The "Z" bits is
the address offset within a node, which means every node has a 44 bits
address space.

Macros XPHYSADDR and MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS are modified unconditionally,
because many other MIPS CPUs have also extended their address spaces.
