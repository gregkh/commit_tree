powerpc: Add POWER8 features to CPU_FTRS_POSSIBLE/ALWAYS

We have been a bit slack about updating the CPU_FTRS_POSSIBLE and
CPU_FTRS_ALWAYS masks. When we added POWER8, and also POWER8E we forgot
to update the ALWAYS mask. And when we added POWER8_DD1 we forgot to
update both the POSSIBLE and ALWAYS masks.

Luckily this hasn't caused any actual bugs AFAICS. Failing to update the
ALWAYS mask just forgoes a potential optimisation opportunity. Failing
to update the POSSIBLE mask for POWER8_DD1 is also OK because it only
removes a bit rather than adding any.

Regardless they should all be in both masks so as to avoid any future
bugs when the set of ALWAYS/POSSIBLE bits changes, or the masks
themselves change.
