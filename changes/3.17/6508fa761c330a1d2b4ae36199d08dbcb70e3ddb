tracing: let user specify tracing_thresh after selecting function_graph

Currently, tracing_thresh works only if we specify it before selecting
function_graph tracer. If we do the opposite, tracing_thresh will change
it's value, but it will not be applied.
To fix it, we add update_thresh callback which is called whenever
tracing_thresh is updated and for function_graph tracer we register
handler which reinitializes tracer depending on tracing_thresh.
