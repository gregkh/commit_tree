tcp: don't require root to read tcp_metrics

commit d23ff7016 (tcp: add generic netlink support for tcp_metrics) introduced
netlink support for the new tcp_metrics, however it restricted getting of
tcp_metrics to root user only. This is a change from how these values could
have been fetched when in the old route cache. Unless there's a legitimate
reason to restrict the reading of these values it would be better if normal
users could fetch them.
