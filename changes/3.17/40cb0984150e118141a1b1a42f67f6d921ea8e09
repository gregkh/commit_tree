Bluetooth: Check for default address of Intel USB controllers

Some Intel Bluetooth controllers come with a default address. If this
address is found, print an error to warn the user about it.

The controller is fully operational, but the danger of duplicate
Bluetooth addresses might causes issues. At least with a clear
error it becomes easier to debug these cases.
