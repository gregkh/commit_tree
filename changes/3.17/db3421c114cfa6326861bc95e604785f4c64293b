net: fec: clear receive interrupts before processing a packet

Clear any pending receive interrupt before we process a pending packet.
This helps to avoid any spurious interrupts being raised after we have
fully cleaned the receive ring, while still allowing an interrupt to be
raised if we receive another packet.

The position of this is critical: we must do this prior to reading the
next packet status to avoid potentially dropping an interrupt when a
packet is still pending.
