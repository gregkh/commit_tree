xfs: fix error handling at xfs_inumbers

From: Jie Liu <jeff.liu@oracle.com>

To fetch the file system number tables, we currently just ignore the
errors and proceed to loop over the next AG or bump agino to the next
chunk in case of btree operations failed, that is not properly because
those errors might hint us potential file system problems.

This patch rework xfs_inumbers() to handle the btree operation errors
as well as the loop conditions.
