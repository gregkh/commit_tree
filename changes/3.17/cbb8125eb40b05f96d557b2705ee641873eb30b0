netfilter: nfnetlink: deliver netlink errors on batch completion

We have to wait until the full batch has been processed to deliver the
netlink error messages to userspace. Otherwise, we may deliver
duplicated errors to userspace in case that we need to abort and replay
the transaction if any of the required modules needs to be autoloaded.

A simple way to reproduce this (assumming nft_meta is not loaded) with
the following test file:

 add table filter
 add chain filter test
 add chain bad test                 # intentional wrong unexistent table
 add rule filter test meta mark 0

Then, when trying to load the batch:

 # nft -f test
 test:4:1-19: Error: Could not process rule: No such file or directory
 add chain bad test
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 test:4:1-19: Error: Could not process rule: No such file or directory
 add chain bad test
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The error is reported twice, once when the batch is aborted due to
missing nft_meta and another when it is fully processed.
