blk-mq: fix WARNING "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!"

Before doing queue release, the queue has been freezed already
by blk_cleanup_queue(), so needn't to freeze queue for deleting
tag set.

This patch fixes the WARNING of "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!"
which is triggered during unloading block driver.
