netfilter: nfnetlink_acct: avoid using NFACCT_F_OVERQUOTA with bit helper functions

Bit helper functions were used for manipulation with NFACCT_F_OVERQUOTA,
but they are accepting pit position, but not a bit mask. As a result
not a third bit for NFACCT_F_OVERQUOTA was set, but forth. Such
behaviour was dangarous and could lead to unexpected overquota report
result.
