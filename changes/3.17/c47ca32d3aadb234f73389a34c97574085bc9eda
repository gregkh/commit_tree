Btrfs: kfree()ing ERR_PTRs

The "inherit" in btrfs_ioctl_snap_create_v2() and "vol_args" in
btrfs_ioctl_rm_dev() are ERR_PTRs so we can't call kfree() on them.

These kind of bugs are "One Err Bugs" where there is just one error
label that does everything.  I could set the "inherit = NULL" and keep
the single out label but it ends up being more complicated that way.  It
makes the code simpler to re-order the unwind so it's in the mirror
order of the allocation and introduce some new error labels.
