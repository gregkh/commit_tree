ACPICA: Utilities: Fix an issue with non-native ACPI_IS_PRINT()

An error was found in the ACPICA provided non-native ACPI_IS_PRINT() causing the
following difference with the native isprint() implementation:
  The GNU libc isprint('\n') test result:
   isprint(0x20) is FALSE
  The Linux kernel isprint('\n') test result:
   ACPI: isprint(0x20) is FALSE
  The _acpi_ctype isprint('\n') test result:
   isprint(0x20) is TRUE

The ACPI_IS_PRINT() macro generated for _acpi_ctype is wrong. It should use
_ACPI_XS instead of _ACPI_SP.  _ACPI_XS is white space only. Other space
characters should be non printable.

This patch fixes this issue. For OSPMs that are using native standard
isprint() implementations, this patch is a no-op. Lv Zheng.
