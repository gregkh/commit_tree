USB: devio: fix issue with log flooding

usbfs allows user space to pass down an URB which sets URB_SHORT_NOT_OK
for output URBs. That causes usbcore to log messages without limit
for a nonsensical disallowed combination. The fix is to silently drop
the attribute in usbfs.
The problem is reported to exist since 3.14
