arm64: KVM: use separate tables for AArch32 32 and 64bit traps

An interesting "feature" of the CP14 encoding is that there is
an overlap between 32 and 64bit registers, meaning they cannot
live in the same table as we did for CP15.

Create separate tables for 64bit CP14 and CP15 registers, and
let the top level handler use the right one.
