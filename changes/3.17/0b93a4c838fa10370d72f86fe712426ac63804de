usb: dwc3: fix TRB completion when multiple TRBs are started

After commit 2ec2a8be (usb: dwc3: gadget:
always enable IOC on bulk/interrupt transfers)
we created a situation where it was possible to
hang a bulk/interrupt endpoint if we had more
than one pending request in our queue and they
were both started with a single Start Transfer
command.

The problems triggers because we had not enabled
Transfer In Progress event for those endpoints
and we were not able to process early giveback
of requests completed without LST bit set.

Fix the problem by finally enabling Xfer In Progress
event for all endpoint types, except control.

Fixes: 2ec2a8be (usb: dwc3: gadget: always
	enable IOC on bulk/interrupt transfers)
