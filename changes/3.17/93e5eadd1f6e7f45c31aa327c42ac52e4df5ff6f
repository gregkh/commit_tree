x86/platform: New Intel Atom SOC power management controller driver

The Power Management Controller (PMC) controls many of the power
management features present in the Atom SoC. This driver provides
a native power off function via PMC PCI IO port.

On some ACPI hardware-reduced platforms(e.g. ASUS-T100), ACPI sleep
registers are not valid so that (*pm_power_off)() is not hooked by
acpi_power_off(). The power off function in this driver is installed
only when pm_power_off is NULL.
