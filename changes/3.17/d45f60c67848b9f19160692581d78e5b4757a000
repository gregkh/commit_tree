nfs: merge nfs_pgio_data into _header

struct nfs_pgio_data only exists as a member of nfs_pgio_header, but is
passed around everywhere, because there used to be multiple _data structs
per _header. Many of these functions then use the _data to find a pointer
to the _header.  This patch cleans this up by merging the nfs_pgio_data
structure into nfs_pgio_header and passing nfs_pgio_header around instead.
