sg: prevent integer overflow when converting from sectors to bytes

This prevents integer overflow when converting the request queue's
max_sectors from sectors to bytes.  However, this is a preparation for
extending the data type of max_sectors in struct Scsi_Host and
scsi_host_template.  So, it is impossible to happen this integer
overflow for now, because SCSI low-level drivers can not specify
max_sectors greater than 0xffff due to the data type limitation.
