MIPS: BCM63xx: Sync MIPS counters during CPU bringup

We are using the mips counters as the clock source, so we need to ensure
they are synced, else e.g. gettimeofday will return different values
depending on which core it was run.

Observed difference was about 8 seconds, causing ~8 seconds ping or time
running backwards for some programs.
