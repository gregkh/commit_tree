i40evf: invite vector 0 to the interrupt party

The i40evf_irq_enable and i40evf_fire_sw_interrupt functions were
unfairly discriminating against MSI-X vector 0, just because it doesn't
handle traffic. That doesn't mean it's not essential to the operation of
the driver. This change allows the watchdog to fire vector 0 via
software, which makes the driver tolerant of dropped interrupts on that
vector.

Buck up, vector 0! You can be part of our gang!
