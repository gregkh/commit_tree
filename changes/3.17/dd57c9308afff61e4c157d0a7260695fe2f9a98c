IB/ipoib: Avoid multicast join attempts with invalid P_key

Currently, the parent interface keeps sending broadcast group join
requests even if p_key index 0 is invalid, which is possible/common in
virtualized environments where a VF has been probed to VM but the
actual P_key configuration has not yet been assigned by the management
software. This creates unnecessary noise on the fabric and in the
kernel logs:

    ib0: multicast join failed for ff12:401b:8000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff, status -22

The original code run the multicast task regardless of the actual
P_key value, which can be avoided. The fix is to re-init resources and
bring interface up only if P_key index 0 is valid either when starting
up or on PKEY_CHANGE event.
