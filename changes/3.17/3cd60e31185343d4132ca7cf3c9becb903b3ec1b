KVM: PPC: BOOK3S: PR: Fix PURR and SPURR emulation

We use time base for PURR and SPURR emulation with PR KVM since we
are emulating a single threaded core. When using time base
we need to make sure that we don't accumulate time spent in the host
in PURR and SPURR value.

Also we don't need to emulate mtspr because both the registers are
hypervisor resource.
