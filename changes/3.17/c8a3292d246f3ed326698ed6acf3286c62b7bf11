pnfs/filelayout: fix race between mark_request_commit and scan_commit_lists

We need to hold cinfo lock while setting bucket->wlseg and adding req to nwritten
list at the same time. Otherwise there might be a window where nwritten list
is empty yet we set bucket->wlseg, in which case ff_layout_scan_ds_commit_list()
may end up clearing bucket->wlseg incorrectly, casuing client to oops later on.

This was found when testing flexfile layout but filelayout has the same problem.
