rbd: show the entire chain of parent images

Make /sys/bus/rbd/devices/<id>/parent show the entire chain of parent
images.  While at it, kernel sprintf() doesn't return negative values,
casting to unsigned long long is no longer necessary and there is no
good reason to split into multiple sprintf() calls.
