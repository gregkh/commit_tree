dm cache: set minimum_io_size to cache's data block size

Before, if the block layer's limit stacking didn't establish an
optimal_io_size that was compatible with the cache's data block size
we'd set optimal_io_size to the data block size and minimum_io_size to 0
(which the block layer adjusts to be physical_block_size).

Update cache_io_hints() to set both minimum_io_size and optimal_io_size
to the cache's data block size.  This fixes an issue where mkfs.xfs
would create more XFS Allocation Groups on cache volumes than on a
normal linear LV of comparable size.
