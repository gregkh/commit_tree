usb-core bInterval quirk

This patch adds a usb quirk to support devices with interupt endpoints
and bInterval values expressed as microframes. The quirk causes the
parse endpoint function to modify the reported bInterval to a standards
conforming value.

There is currently code in the endpoint parser that checks for
bIntervals that are outside of the valid range (1-16 for USB 2+ high
speed and super speed interupt endpoints). In this case, the code assumes
the bInterval is being reported in 1ms frames. As well, the correction
is only applied if the original bInterval value is out of the 1-16 range.

With this quirk applied to the device, the bInterval will be
accurately adjusted from microframes to an exponent.
