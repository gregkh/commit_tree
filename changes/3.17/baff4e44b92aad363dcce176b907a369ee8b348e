xfs: add xlog sysfs kobject and attribute handlers

Embed a kobject into the xfs log data structure (xlog). This creates a
'log' subdirectory for every XFS mount instance in sysfs. The lifecycle
of the log kobject is tied to the lifecycle of the log.

Also define a set of generic attribute handlers associated with the log
kobject in preparation for the addition of attributes.
