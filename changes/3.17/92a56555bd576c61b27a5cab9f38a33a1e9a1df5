nfs: Don't busy-wait on SIGKILL in __nfs_iocounter_wait

If a SIGKILL is sent to a task waiting in __nfs_iocounter_wait,
it will busy-wait or soft lockup in its while loop.
nfs_wait_bit_killable won't sleep, and the loop won't exit on
the error return.

Stop the busy-wait by breaking out of the loop when
nfs_wait_bit_killable returns an error.
