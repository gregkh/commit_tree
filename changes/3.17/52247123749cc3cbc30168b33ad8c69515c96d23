xtensa: fix access to THREAD_RA/THREAD_SP/THREAD_DS

With SMP and a lot of debug options enabled task_struct::thread gets out
of reach of s32i/l32i instructions with base pointing at task_struct,
breaking build with the following messages:

  arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S: Assembler messages:
  arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S:1002: Error: operand 3 of 'l32i.n' has invalid value '1048'
  arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S:1831: Error: operand 3 of 's32i.n' has invalid value '1040'
  arch/xtensa/kernel/entry.S:1832: Error: operand 3 of 's32i.n' has invalid value '1044'

Change base to point to task_struct::thread in such cases.
Don't use a10 in _switch_to to save/restore prev pointer as a2 is not
clobbered.
