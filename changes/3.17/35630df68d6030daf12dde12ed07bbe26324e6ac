NFC: st21nfcb: Add driver for STMicroelectronics ST21NFCB NFC chip

Add driver for STMicroelectronics ST21NFCB NFC controller.
ST21NFCB is using NCI protocol and a proprietary low level transport
protocol called NDLC used on top.

NDLC:
The protocol defines 2 types of frame:
- One type carrying NCI data (referred as DATAFRAME frames).
- One type carrying protocol information used for flow control and error
control mechanisms (referred as SUPERVISOR frames).

After each frame transmission to the NFC controller, the device host
SHALL waitfor  an ACK (SUPERVISOR frame) reception before sending a
new frame.
The NFC controller MAY send a frame at anytime to the device host.
The NFC controller MAY send a specific WAIT supervisor frame to indicate
to device host that a NCI data packet has been received but that it could
take significant time before the NFC controller sends an ACK and thus
allows next data reception.
