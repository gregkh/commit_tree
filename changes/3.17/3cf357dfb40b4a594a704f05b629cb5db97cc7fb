i2c: qup: disable clks and return instead of just returning error

This fixes a error handling scenario where clocks were not being disabled
when QUP_OUTPUT_BLOCK_SIZE returns a size greater than the size of blk_sizes
array. So this patch adds a statement to jump to the fail lable to release the
clocks.
