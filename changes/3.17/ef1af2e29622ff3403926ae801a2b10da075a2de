KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Take SRCU read lock around RTAS kvm_read_guest() call

This does for PR KVM what c9438092cae4 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Take SRCU
read lock around kvm_read_guest() call") did for HV KVM, that is,
eliminate a "suspicious rcu_dereference_check() usage!" warning by
taking the SRCU lock around the call to kvmppc_rtas_hcall().

It also fixes a return of RESUME_HOST to return EMULATE_FAIL instead,
since kvmppc_h_pr() is supposed to return EMULATE_* values.
