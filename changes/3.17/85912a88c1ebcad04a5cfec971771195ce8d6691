spi: rspi: Handle dmaengine_prep_slave_sg() failures gracefully

As typically a shmobile SoC has less DMA channels than devices that can use
DMA, we may want to prioritize access to the DMA channels in the future.
This means that dmaengine_prep_slave_sg() may start failing arbitrarily.

Handle dmaengine_prep_slave_sg() failures gracefully by falling back to
PIO.
