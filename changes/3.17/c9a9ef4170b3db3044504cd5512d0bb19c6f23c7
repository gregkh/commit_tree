i2c: tegra: Move clk_prepare/clk_set_rate to probe

Currently the i2c-tegra bus driver prepares, enables
and set_rates its clocks separately for each transfer.
This causes locking problems when doing I2C transfers
from clock notifiers; see
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2014-July/268653.html

This patch moves clk_prepare/unprepare and clk_set_rate calls to
the probe function, leaving only clk_enable/disable to be
done on each transfer. This solves the locking issue.
