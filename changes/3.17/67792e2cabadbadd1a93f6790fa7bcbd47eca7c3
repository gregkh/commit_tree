rtmutex: Avoid pointless requeueing in the deadlock detection chain walk

In case the dead lock detector is enabled we follow the lock chain to
the end in rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain, even if we could stop earlier
due to the priority/waiter constellation.

But once we are no longer the top priority waiter in a certain step
or the task holding the lock has already the same priority then there
is no point in dequeing and enqueing along the lock chain as there is
no change at all.

So stop the queueing at this point.
