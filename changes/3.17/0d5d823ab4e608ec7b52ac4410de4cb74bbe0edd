mm: move zone->pages_scanned into a vmstat counter

zone->pages_scanned is a write-intensive cache line during page reclaim
and it's also updated during page free.  Move the counter into vmstat to
take advantage of the per-cpu updates and do not update it in the free
paths unless necessary.

On a small UMA machine running tiobench the difference is marginal.  On
a 4-node machine the overhead is more noticable.  Note that automatic
NUMA balancing was disabled for this test as otherwise the system CPU
overhead is unpredictable.

Note that the overhead reduction will vary depending on where exactly
pages are allocated and freed.
