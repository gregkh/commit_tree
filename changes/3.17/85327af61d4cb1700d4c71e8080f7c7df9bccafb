workqueue: stronger test in process_one_work()

When POOL_DISASSOCIATED is cleared, the running worker's local CPU should
be the same as pool->cpu without any exception even during cpu-hotplug.

This patch changes "(proposition_A && proposition_B && proposition_C)"
to "(proposition_B && proposition_C)", so if the old compound
proposition is true, the new one must be true too. so this won't hide
any possible bug which can be hit by old test.

tj: Minor description update and dropped the obvious comment.
