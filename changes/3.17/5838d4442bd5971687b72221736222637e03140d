fanotify: fix double free of pending permission events

Commit 85816794240b ("fanotify: Fix use after free for permission
events") introduced a double free issue for permission events which are
pending in group's notification queue while group is being destroyed.
These events are freed from fanotify_handle_event() but they are not
removed from groups notification queue and thus they get freed again
from fsnotify_flush_notify().

Fix the problem by removing permission events from notification queue
before freeing them if we skip processing access response.  Also expand
comments in fanotify_release() to explain group shutdown in detail.
