KVM: x86: avoid useless set of KVM_REQ_EVENT after emulation

Despite the provisions to emulate up to 130 consecutive instructions, in
practice KVM will emulate just one before exiting handle_invalid_guest_state,
because x86_emulate_instruction always sets KVM_REQ_EVENT.

However, we only need to do this if an interrupt could be injected,
which happens a) if an interrupt shadow bit (STI or MOV SS) has gone
away; b) if the interrupt flag has just been set (other instructions
than STI can set it without enabling an interrupt shadow).

This cuts another 700-900 cycles from the cost of emulating an
instruction (measured on a Sandy Bridge Xeon: 1650-2600 cycles
before the patch on kvm-unit-tests, 925-1700 afterwards).
