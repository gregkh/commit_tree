percpu: disallow archs from overriding SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR()

It has been about half a decade since all archs started using the
dynamic percpu allocator and thus the same SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR()
implementation.  There's no benefit in overriding SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR()
anymore.

Remove #ifndef around it to clarify that this is identical regardless
of the arch.

This patch doesn't cause any functional difference.
