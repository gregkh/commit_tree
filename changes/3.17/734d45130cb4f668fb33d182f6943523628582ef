cpuset: update cs->effective_{cpus, mems} when config changes

We're going to have separate user-configured masks and effective ones.

Eventually configured masks can only be changed by writing cpuset.cpus
and cpuset.mems, and they won't be restricted by parent cpuset. While
effective masks reflect cpu/memory hotplug and hierachical restriction,
and these are the real masks that apply to the tasks in the cpuset.

We calculate effective mask this way:
  - top cpuset's effective_mask == online_mask, otherwise
  - cpuset's effective_mask == configured_mask & parent effective_mask,
    if the result is empty, it inherits parent effective mask.

Those behavior changes are for default hierarchy only. For legacy
hierarchy, effective_mask and configured_mask are the same, so we won't
break old interfaces.

To make cs->effective_{cpus,mems} to be effective masks, we need to
  - update the effective masks at hotplug
  - update the effective masks at config change
  - take on ancestor's mask when the effective mask is empty

The second item is done here. We don't need to treat root_cs specially
in update_cpumasks_hier().

This won't introduce behavior change.

v3:
- add a WARN_ON() to check if effective masks are the same with configured
  masks on legacy hierarchy.
- pass trialcs->cpus_allowed to update_cpumasks_hier() and add a comment for
  it. Similar change for update_nodemasks_hier(). Suggested by Tejun.

v2:
- revise the comment in update_{cpu,node}masks_hier(), suggested by Tejun.
- fix to use @cp instead of @cs in these two functions.
