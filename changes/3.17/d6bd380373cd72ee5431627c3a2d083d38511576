drm/gf100-/gr: implement the proper SetShaderExceptions method

We have another version of it implemented in SW, however, that version
isn't serialised with normal PGRAPH operation and can possibly clobber
the enables for another context.

This is the same method that's implemented by the NVIDIA binary driver.
