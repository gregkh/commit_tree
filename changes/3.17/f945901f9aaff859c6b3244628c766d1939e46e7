mmc: omap_hsmmc: abort runtime suspend if pending sdio irq detected

On multicores, an sdio irq handler could be running in parallel to
runtime suspend. In the worst case it could be waiting for the spinlock
held by the runtime suspend. When runtime suspend is complete and the
functional clock (fclk) turned off, the irq handler will continue and
cause a SIGBUS on the first register access.
