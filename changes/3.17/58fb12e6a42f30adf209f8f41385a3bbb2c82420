nfsd: Add a mutex to protect the NFSv4.0 open owner replay cache

We don't want to rely on the client_mutex for protection in the case of
NFSv4 open owners. Instead, we add a mutex that will only be taken for
NFSv4.0 state mutating operations, and that will be released once the
entire compound is done.

Also, ensure that nfsd4_cstate_assign_replay/nfsd4_cstate_clear_replay
take a reference to the stateowner when they are using it for NFSv4.0
open and lock replay caching.
