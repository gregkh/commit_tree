arm64: Add brackets around user_stack_pointer()

Commit 5f888a1d33 (ARM64: perf: support dwarf unwinding in compat mode)
changes user_stack_pointer() to return the compat SP for 32-bit tasks
but without brackets around the whole definition, with possible issues
on the call sites (noticed with a subsequent fix for KSTK_ESP).
