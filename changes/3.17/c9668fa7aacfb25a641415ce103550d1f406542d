ARM: mvebu: add appended DTB support in mvebu_v5_defconfig

The mvebu_v5_defconfig is currently used for Kirkwood platforms, and
in the future hopefully used for Orion5x platforms. Those platforms
use fairly old bootloaders that don't have Device Tree support, so it
makes sense to enable appended DTB support by default, as well as the
backward compatibility with ATAGS passed by the bootloader for those
platforms. It helps having a defconfig that works fine out of the box
for most Kirkwood platforms.
