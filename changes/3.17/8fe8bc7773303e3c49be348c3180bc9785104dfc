i2c: s6000: remove duplicate driver

It turned out that the s6000 simply has a designware IP core and should
use the designated driver for it which is way more maintained and
feature complete. There are currently no users in tree, and not even a
toolchain for s6000 seems to be available. So, simply remove this
duplicate. If someone needs assistance in converting to the designware
driver, the i2c list will be there to help.
