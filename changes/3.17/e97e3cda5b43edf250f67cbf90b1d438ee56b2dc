be2net: reduce arguments passed to FW-cmd routines

A pointer to adapter struct is passed anyway to all of the FW-cmd routines
in be_cmds.c. For routines which query data from FW, the adapter pointer
is enough to return the queried fields.
There is no need to separately pass pointers to individual members of
the adapter structure. This patch fixes this for be_cmd_get_fw_ver()
and be_cmd_get_fw_cfg() routines.
