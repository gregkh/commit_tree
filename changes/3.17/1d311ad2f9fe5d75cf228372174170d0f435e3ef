sunvnet: Schedule maybe_tx_wakeup() as a tasklet from ldc_rx path

At the tail of vnet_event(), if we hit the maybe_tx_wakeup()
condition, we try to take the netif_tx_lock() in the
recv-interrupt-context and can deadlock with dev_watchdog().
vnet_event() should schedule maybe_tx_wakeup() as a tasklet
to avoid this deadlock
