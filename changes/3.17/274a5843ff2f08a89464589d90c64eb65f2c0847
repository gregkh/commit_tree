blk-mq: don't allow merges if turned off for the queue

blk-mq uses BLK_MQ_F_SHOULD_MERGE, as set by the driver at init time,
to determine whether it should merge IO or not. However, this could
also be disabled by the admin, if merging is switched off through
sysfs. So check the general queue state as well before attempting
to merge IO.
