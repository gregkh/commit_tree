USB: option: reduce interrupt-urb logging verbosity

Do not log normal interrupt-urb shutdowns as errors.

The option driver has always been logging any nonzero interrupt-urb
status as an error, including when the urb is killed during normal
operation.

Commit 9096f1fbba91 ("USB: usb_wwan: fix potential NULL-deref at
resume") moved the interrupt urb submission from port probe and release
to open and close, thus potentially increasing the number of these
false-positive error messages dramatically.
