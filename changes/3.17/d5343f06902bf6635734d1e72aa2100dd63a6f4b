mwifiex: fix corner case system hang issue

Sometimes pending internal scan commands are delayed to give
preference to Tx traffic. 'scan_processing' flag has been
checked at the beginning of delay timer routine to know if in the
meantime scan operation has been cancelled.

There is a corner case where pending scan commands are emptied
after scan_processing flag check is passed. In this case
wrong pointer returned by list_first_entry() is passed to
list_del() which causes system hang.

This patch fixes the issue by adding list_empty() check.
