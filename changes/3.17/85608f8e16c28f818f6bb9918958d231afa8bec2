random: remove unneeded hash of a portion of the entropy pool

We previously extracted a portion of the entropy pool in
mix_pool_bytes() and hashed it in to avoid racing CPU's from returning
duplicate random values.  Now that we are using a spinlock to prevent
this from happening, this is no longer necessary.  So remove it, to
simplify the code a bit.
