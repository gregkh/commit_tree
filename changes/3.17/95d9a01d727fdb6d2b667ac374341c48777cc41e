USB: OHCI: revert the ZF Micro orphan-TD quirk

This patch reverts the important parts of commit 89a0fd18a96e (USB:
OHCI handles more ZFMicro quirks), namely, the parts related to
handling orphan TDs for interrupt endpoints.  A later patch in this
series will introduce a more general mechanism that applies to all
endpoint types and all controllers.
