x86/kvm: Resolve shadow warnings in macro expansion

Resolve shadow warnings that appear in W=2 builds. Instead of
using ret to hold the return pointer, save the length in a new
variable saved_len and compute the pointer on exit. This also
resolves a very technical error, in that ret was declared as
a const char *, when it really was a char * const.
