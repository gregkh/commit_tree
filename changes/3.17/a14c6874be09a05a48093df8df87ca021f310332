cgroup: split cgroup_base_files[] into cgroup_{dfl|legacy}_base_files[]

Currently cgroup_base_files[] contains the cgroup core interface files
for both legacy and default hierarchies with each file tagged with
CFTYPE_INSANE and CFTYPE_ONLY_ON_DFL.  This is difficult to read.

Let's separate it out to two separate tables, cgroup_dfl_base_files[]
and cgroup_legacy_base_files[], and use the appropriate one in
cgroup_mkdir() depending on the hierarchy type.  This makes tagging
each file unnecessary.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior changes.

v2: cgroup_dfl_base_files[] was missing the termination entry
    triggering WARN in cgroup_init_cftypes() for 0day kernel testing
    robot.  Fixed.
