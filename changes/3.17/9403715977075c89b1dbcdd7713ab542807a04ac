tcp: move around a few calls in tcp_v6_conn_request

Make the tcp_v6_conn_request calls flow similar with that of
tcp_v4_conn_request.

Note that want_cookie can be true only if isn is zero and that is why
we can move the if (want_cookie) block out of the if (!isn) block.

Moving security_inet_conn_request() has a couple of side effects:
missing inet_rsk(req)->ecn_ok update and the req->cookie_ts
update. However, neither SELinux nor Smack security hooks seems to
check them. This change should also avoid future different behaviour
for IPv4 and IPv6 in the security hooks.
