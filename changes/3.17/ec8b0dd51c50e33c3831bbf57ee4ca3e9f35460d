drm/i915: Allow overlapping userptr objects

Whilst I strongly advise against doing so for the implicit coherency
issues between the multiple buffer objects accessing the same backing
store, it nevertheless is a valid use case, akin to mmaping the same
file multiple times.

The reason why we forbade it earlier was that our use of the interval
tree for fast invalidation upon vma changes excluded overlapping
objects. So in the case where the user wishes to create such pairs of
overlapping objects, we degrade the range invalidation to walkin the
linear list of objects associated with the mm.

A situation where overlapping objects could arise is the lax implementation
of MIT-SHM Pixmaps in the xserver. A second situation is where the user
wishes to have different access modes to a region of memory (e.g. access
through a read-only userptr buffer and through a normal userptr buffer).

v2: Compile for mmu-notifiers after tweaking
v3: Rename is_linear/has_linear
