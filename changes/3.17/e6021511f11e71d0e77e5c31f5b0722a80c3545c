mfd: arizona: Don't use devres for DCVDD

Currently the Arizona core uses a devm_regulator_get against its own
device node to obtain DCVDD. The Arizona core is an MFD device and DCVDD
is usually supplied by a child node (arizona-ldo1) of the core. As
devres destruction for the MFD device will run after all its children
have been destroyed, the regulator will be destroyed before devres
calls regulator_put. This causes a warning from both the destruction of
the child node, as the regulator is still open, and from the put of the
regulator as the regulator device has already been destroyed.

This patch handles the regulator get and put without devres to avoid
this issue.
