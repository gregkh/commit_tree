KVM: x86: Clear rflags.rf on emulated instructions

When an instruction is emulated RFLAGS.RF should be cleared. KVM previously did
not do so. This patch clears RFLAGS.RF after interception is done.  If a fault
occurs during the instruction, RFLAGS.RF will be set by a previous patch.  This
patch does not handle the case of traps/interrupts during rep-strings. Traps
are only expected to occur on debug watchpoints, and those are anyhow not
handled by the emulator.
