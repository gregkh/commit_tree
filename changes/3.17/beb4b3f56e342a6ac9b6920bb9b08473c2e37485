ARM: dts: add rk3288 ehci usb devices

rk3288 has two kind of usb controller; this adds the ehci variant for
host0 and hsic.

At the moment we don't add any phys for these controllers, but the
default settings seem to work OK.

There is a hardware problem in ohci controller which make it
unavailable and host0 controller can only support high-speed devices.
