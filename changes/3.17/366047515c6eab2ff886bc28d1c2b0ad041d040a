i2c: rework kernel config I2C_ACPI

Commit da3c6647(I2C/ACPI: Clean up I2C ACPI code and Add CONFIG_I2C_ACPI
config) adds a new kernel config I2C_ACPI and make I2C core built in
when the config is selected. This is wrong because distributions
etc generally compile I2C as a module and the commit broken that.
This patch is to rename I2C_ACPI to ACPI_I2C_OPREGION. New config
only controls ACPI I2C operation region code and depends on I2C=y.
