drm/vc4: Move IRQ enable to PM path

We were calling enable_irq on bind, where it was already enabled previously
by the IRQ helper. Additionally, dev->irq is not set correctly until after
postinstall and so was always zero here, triggering a warning in 4.15.
Fix both by moving the enable to the power management resume path, where we
know there was a previous disable invocation during suspend.
