mm: remove cold parameter for release_pages

All callers of release_pages claim the pages being released are cache
hot.  As no one cares about the hotness of pages being released to the
allocator, just ditch the parameter.

No performance impact is expected as the overhead is marginal.  The
parameter is removed simply because it is a bit stupid to have a useless
parameter copied everywhere.
