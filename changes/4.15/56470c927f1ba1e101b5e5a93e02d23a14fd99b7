net: qualcomm: rmnet: Remove duplicate setting of rmnet private info

The end point is set twice in the local_ep as well as the mux_id and
the real_dev in the rmnet private structure. Remove the local_ep.
While these elements are equivalent, rmnet_endpoint will be
used only as part of the rmnet_port for muxed scenarios in VND mode.
