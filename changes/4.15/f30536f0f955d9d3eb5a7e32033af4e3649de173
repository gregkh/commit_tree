ovl: update cache version of impure parent on rename

ovl_rename() updates dir cache version for impure old parent if an entry
with copy up origin is moved into old parent, but it did not update
cache version if the entry moved out of old parent has a copy up origin.

[SzM] Same for new dir: we updated the version if an entry with origin was
moved in, but not if an entry with origin was moved out.
