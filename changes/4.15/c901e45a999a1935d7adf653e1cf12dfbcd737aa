RISC-V: `sfence.vma` orderes the instruction cache

This is just a comment change, but it's one that bit me on the mailing
list.  It turns out that issuing a `sfence.vma` enforces instruction
cache ordering in addition to TLB ordering.  This isn't explicitly
called out in the ISA manual, but Andrew will be making that more clear
in a future revision.
