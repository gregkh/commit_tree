ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_max98090: add support for Baytrail

Distributions such as Fedora, Ubuntu and Gallium don't currently
have a means to support Baytrail Chromebooks and other platforms
with the same build [1][2] due to incompatible platform drivers.

Add MCLK management to reuse this machine driver for Baytrail
platforms and solve this coexistence problem at last. UCM files are
provided at [3] and will eventually be submitted to the new repo.

The legacy byt-max98090 machine driver is still maintained but can
only be used when the other Atom/DPCM driver is not compiled in, or
when users don't want to configure extra mixers required by the
Atom/sst driver.

Tested on Lenovo 100s Baytrail Chromebook w/ Mr. Chromebox BOOT_STUB
firmware and Acer R11 Cherrytrail Chromebook
