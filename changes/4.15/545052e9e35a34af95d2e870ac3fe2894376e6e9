ext4: Switch to iomap for SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA

Switch to the iomap_seek_hole and iomap_seek_data helpers for
implementing lseek SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA, and remove all the code that
isn't needed any more.

Note that with this patch ext4 will now always depend on the iomap code
instead of only when CONFIG_DAX is enabled, and it requires adding a
call into the extent status tree for iomap_begin as well to properly
deal with delalloc extents.
