iommu/iova: Optimise the padding calculation

The mask for calculating the padding size doesn't change, so there's no
need to recalculate it every loop iteration. Furthermore, Once we've
done that, it becomes clear that we don't actually need to calculate a
padding size at all - by flipping the arithmetic around, we can just
combine the upper limit, size, and mask directly to check against the
lower limit.

For an arm64 build, this alone knocks 20% off the object code size of
the entire alloc_iova() function!
