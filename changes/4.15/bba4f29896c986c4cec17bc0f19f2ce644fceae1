btrfs: tree-checker: Enhance btrfs_check_node output

Use inline function to replace macro since we don't need
stringification.
(Macro still exists until all callers get updated)

And add more info about the error, and replace EIO with EUCLEAN.

For nr_items error, report if it's too large or too small, and output
the valid value range.

For node block pointer, added a new alignment checker.

For key order, also output the next key to make the problem more
obvious.
