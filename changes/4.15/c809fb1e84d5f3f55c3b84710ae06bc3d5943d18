ASoC: Intel: atom: use cht_bsw_max98090 for Baytrail Chromebooks

Baytrail Chromebooks used to be managed with legacy driver which
is not compatible with atom/sst drivers. Reuse CHT driver to
handle max98098 codec and allow distributions to support all
Atom platforms with the same build.

The legacy byt-max98090 can still be used but in a build for
Baytrail+max98090 only.
