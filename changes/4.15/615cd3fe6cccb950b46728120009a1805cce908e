[media] media: lirc_dev: make better use of file->private_data

By making better use of file->private_data in lirc_dev we can avoid
digging around in the irctls[] array, thereby simplifying the code.

External drivers need to use lirc_get_pdata() instead of mucking around
in file->private_data.

The newly introduced lirc_init_pdata() function isn't very elegant, but
it's a stopgap measure which can be removed once lirc_zilog is converted
to rc-core.
