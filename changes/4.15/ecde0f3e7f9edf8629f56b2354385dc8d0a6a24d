mm, memory_hotplug: remove timeout from __offline_memory

We have a hardcoded 120s timeout after which the memory offline fails
basically since the hot remove has been introduced.  This is essentially
a policy implemented in the kernel.  Moreover there is no way to adjust
the timeout and so we are sometimes facing memory offline failures if
the system is under a heavy memory pressure or very intensive CPU
workload on large machines.

It is not very clear what purpose the timeout actually serves.  The
offline operation is interruptible by a signal so if userspace wants
some timeout based termination this can be done trivially by sending a
signal.

If there is a strong usecase to do this from the kernel then we should
do it properly and have a it tunable from the userspace with the timeout
disabled by default along with the explanation who uses it and for what
purporse.
