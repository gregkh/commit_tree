btrfs: Refactor transaction handling in received subvolume ioctl

If btrfs_transaction_commit fails it will proceed to call
cleanup_transaction, which in turn already does btrfs_abort_transaction.
So let's remove the unnecessary code duplication. Also let's be explicit
about handling failure of btrfs_uuid_tree_add by calling
btrfs_end_transaction.
