media: dvb-core: always call invoke_release() in fe_free()

Follow-up to: ead666000a5f ("media: dvb_frontend: only use kref after initialized")

The aforementioned commit fixed refcount OOPSes when demod driver attaching
succeeded but tuner driver didn't. However, the use count of the attached
demod drivers don't go back to zero and thus couldn't be cleanly unloaded.
Improve on this by calling dvb_frontend_invoke_release() in
__dvb_frontend_free() regardless of fepriv being NULL, instead of returning
when fepriv is NULL. This is safe to do since _invoke_release() will check
for passed pointers being valid before calling the .release() function.
