drm: Make syncobj import/export functions static

Fix the following sparse warnings by making functions static:
drm_syncobj.c:420:5: warning: symbol 'drm_syncobj_import_sync_file_fence' was not declared. Should it be static?
drm_syncobj.c:441:5: warning: symbol 'drm_syncobj_export_sync_file' was not declared. Should it be static?
