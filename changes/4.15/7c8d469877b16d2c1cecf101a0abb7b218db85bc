debugfs: add support for more elaborate ->d_fsdata

Currently, the user provided fops, "real_fops", are stored directly into
->d_fsdata.

In order to be able to store more per-file state and thus prepare for more
granular file removal protection, wrap the real_fops into a dynamically
allocated container struct, debugfs_fsdata.

A struct debugfs_fsdata gets allocated at file creation and freed from the
newly intoduced ->d_release().

Finally, move the implementation of debugfs_real_fops() out of the public
debugfs header such that struct debugfs_fsdata's declaration can be kept
private.
