coccinelle: orplus: reorganize to improve performance

Adding two #define constants is less common than performing & and |
operations on them, so put the addition first to reduce the set of cases
that have to be considered in detail.  At the same time, add & and |
patterns for both arguments of +, to account for commutativity and obtain
more results.

Running time is divided by 3 when applying this to the whole kernel on my
laptop with an Intel i5-6200U CPU.
