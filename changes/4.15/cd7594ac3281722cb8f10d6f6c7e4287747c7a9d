ARM: dts: logicpd-somlv: Fix wl127x pinmux

The pin assignment for the wl127x interrupt was incorrect.  I am
not sure how this every worked.  This also eliminates a conflict with
the SMC911x ethernet driver and properly moves pinmuxes for the
related gpio to omap3_pmx_wkup from omap3_pmx_core.

DM3730 SOM-LV")
