lightnvm: pblk: remove redundant check on read path

A partial read I/O in pblk is an I/O where some sectors reside in the
write buffer in main memory and some are persisted on the device. Such
an I/O must at least contain 2 lbas, therefore checking for the case
where a single lba is mapped is not necessary.
