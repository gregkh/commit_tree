KVM: arm/arm64: Fix broken GICH_ELRSR big endian conversion

We are incorrectly rearranging 32-bit words inside a 64-bit typed value
for big endian systems, which would result in never marking a virtual
interrupt as inactive on big endian systems (assuming 32 or fewer LRs on
the hardware).  Fix this by not doing any word order manipulation for
the typed values.
