openrisc: add cacheflush support to fix icache aliasing

On OpenRISC the icache does not snoop data stores.  This can cause
aliasing as reported by Jan. This patch fixes the issue to ensure icache
is properly synchronized when code is written to memory.  It supports both
SMP and UP flushing.

This supports dcache flush as well for architectures that do not support
write-through caches; most OpenRISC implementations do implement
write-through cache however. Dcache flushes are done only on a single
core as OpenRISC dcaches all support snooping of bus stores.
