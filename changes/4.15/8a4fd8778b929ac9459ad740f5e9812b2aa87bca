staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Change RX buffer alignment

The WRIOP hardware block v1.0.0 (found on LS2080A board)
requires data in RX buffers to be aligned to 256B, but
newer revisions (e.g. on LS2088A, LS1088A) only require
64B alignment.

Check WRIOP version and decide at runtime which alignment
requirement to configure for ingress buffers.
