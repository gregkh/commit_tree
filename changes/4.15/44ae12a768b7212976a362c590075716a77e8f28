net: sched: move the can_offload check from binding phase to rule insertion phase

This restores the original behaviour before the block callbacks were
introduced. Allow the drivers to do binding of block always, no matter
if the NETIF_F_HW_TC feature is on or off. Move the check to the block
callback which is called for rule insertion.
