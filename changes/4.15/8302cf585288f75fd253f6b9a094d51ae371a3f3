gpio: Introduce struct gpio_irq_chip.first

Some GPIO chips cannot support sparse IRQ numbering and therefore need
to manually allocate their interrupt descriptors statically. For these
cases, a driver can pass the first allocated IRQ via the struct
gpio_irq_chip's "first" field and thereby cause the IRQ domain to map
all IRQs during initialization.
