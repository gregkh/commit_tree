sunxi-rsb: Include OF based modalias in device uevent

Include the OF-based modalias in the uevent sent when registering devices
on the sunxi RSB bus, so that user space has a chance to autoload the
kernel module for the device.

Fixes a regression caused by commit 3f241bfa60bd ("arm64: allwinner: a64:
pine64: Use dcdc1 regulator for mmc0"). When the axp20x-rsb module for
the AXP803 PMIC is built as a module, it is not loaded and the system
ends up with an disfunctional MMC controller.
