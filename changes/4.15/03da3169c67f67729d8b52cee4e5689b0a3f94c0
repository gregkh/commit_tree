nfsd: Fix races with check_stateid_generation()

The various functions that call check_stateid_generation() in order
to compare a client-supplied stateid with the nfs4_stid state, usually
need to atomically check for closed state. Those that perform the
check after locking the st_mutex using nfsd4_lock_ol_stateid()
should now be OK, but we do want to fix up the others.
