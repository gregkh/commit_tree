ACPI / x86: Extend KIOX000A quirk to cover all affected BIOS versions

Recently produced GPD win devices have a new BIOS, research into the
changes in this BIOS has found a ChangeLog which shows that the disabling
of the KIOX000A node has been done starting with the 20170221 version.

Unfortunately the GPD pocket uses the exact same DMI strings as the win
and its BIOS was copy-pasted from the GPD win, so it has a disabled
KIOX000A node which we should not enable, so we need to check for the
exact BIOS date.

This commit adds 2 extra entries to the always_present_ids quirk table
with bios_date matches for the older also affected and the latest BIOS.
