x86/apic: Split local APIC timer setup from the APIC setup

apic_bsp_setup() sets up the local APIC, I/O APIC and APIC timer.

The local APIC and I/O APIC setup belongs to interrupt delivery mode
setup. Setting up the local APIC timer for booting CPU is another job
and has nothing to do with interrupt delivery mode setup.

Split local APIC timer setup from the APIC setup, keep it in the original
position for SMP and UP kernel for now.
