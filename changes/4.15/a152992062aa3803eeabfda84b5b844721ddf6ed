drm/imx: always call wait_for_flip_done in commit_tail

drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks will go away in the future.

The new drm_atomic_helper_setup_commit in 4.15 expects that blocking commits
have completed flipping before the commit_tail returns. This must be ensured
by calling wait_for_vblanks or wait_for_flip_done, where flip_done might do
a less agressive wait, which is fine for imx-drm.

Fixes: 080de2e5be2d (drm/atomic: Check for busy planes/connectors before
                     setting the commit)
