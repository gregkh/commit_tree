MIPS: Use SLL by 0 for 32-bit truncation in `__read_64bit_c0_split'

Optimize `__read_64bit_c0_split' and reduce the instruction count by 1,
observing that a DSLL/DSRA pair by 32, is equivalent to SLL by 0, which
architecturally truncates the value requested to 32 bits on 64-bit MIPS
hardware regardless of whether the input operand is or is not a properly
sign-extended 32-bit value.
