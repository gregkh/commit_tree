Revert "KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: POWER9 does not require secondary thread management"

This reverts commit 94a04bc25a2c6296bd0c5e82c10e8231c2b11f77.

In order to run HPT guests on a radix POWER9 host, we will have to run
the host in single-threaded mode, because POWER9 processors do not
currently support running some threads of a core in HPT mode while
others are in radix mode ("mixed mode").

That means that we will need the same mechanisms that are used on
POWER8 to make the secondary threads available to KVM, which were
disabled on POWER9 by commit 94a04bc25a2c.
