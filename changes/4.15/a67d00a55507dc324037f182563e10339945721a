xfs: pass a struct xfs_bmbt_irec to xfs_bmbt_update

Now that we've massaged the callers into the right form we can always
pass the actual extent record instead of the individual fields.

With that xfs_bmbt_disk_set_allf can go away, and xfs_bmbt_disk_set_all
can be merged into the former implementation of xfs_bmbt_disk_set_allf.
