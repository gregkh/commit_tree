ASoC: wm_adsp: Fix validation of firmware and coeff lengths

The checks for whether another region/block header could be present
are subtracting the size from the current offset.  Obviously we should
instead subtract the offset from the size.

The checks for whether the region/block data fit in the file are
adding the data size to the current offset and header size, without
checking for integer overflow.  Rearrange these so that overflow is
impossible.
