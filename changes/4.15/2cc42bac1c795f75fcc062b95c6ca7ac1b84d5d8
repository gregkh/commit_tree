x86-64/Xen: eliminate W+X mappings

A few thousand such pages are usually left around due to the re-use of
L1 tables having been provided by the hypervisor (Dom0) or tool stack
(DomU). Set NX in the direct map variant, which needs to be done in L2
due to the dual use of the re-used L1s.

For x86_configure_nx() to actually do what it is supposed to do, call
get_cpu_cap() first. This was broken by commit 4763ed4d45 ("x86, mm:
Clean up and simplify NX enablement") when switching away from the
direct EFER read.
