microblaze: make dma_cache_sync a no-op

microblaze does not implement DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT allocations, so it
doesn't make any sense to do any work in dma_cache_sync given that it
must be a no-op when dma_alloc_attrs returns coherent memory.

This also allows moving __dma_sync out of the microblaze asm/dma-mapping.h
and thus greatly reduce the amount of includes there.
