drm/i915: Order two completing nop_submit_request

If two nop's (requests in-flight following a wedged device) complete at
the same time, the global_seqno value written to the HWSP is undefined
as the two threads are not serialized.

v2: Use irqsafe spinlock. We expect the callback may be called from
inside another irq spinlock, so we can't unconditionally restore irqs.
