timekeeping: Consolidate timekeeping_inject_offset code

The code to check the adjtimex() or clock_adjtime() arguments is spread
out across multiple files for presumably only historic reasons. As a
preparatation for a rework to get rid of the use of 'struct timeval'
and 'struct timespec' in there, this moves all the portions into
kernel/time/timekeeping.c and marks them as 'static'.

The warp_clock() function here is not as closely related as the others,
but I feel it still makes sense to move it here in order to consolidate
all callers of timekeeping_inject_offset().
