IB/mlx4: Fix mlx4_ib_alloc_mr error flow

ibmr.device is being set only after ib_alloc_mr() is successfully complete.
Therefore, in case imlx4_mr_enable() returns with error, the error flow
unwinder calls to mlx4_free_priv_pages(), which uses ibmr.device.

Such usage causes to NULL dereference oops and to fix it, the IB device
should be set in the mr struct earlier stage (e.g. prior to calling
mlx4_free_priv_pages()).
