tracing: Remove extra zeroing out of the ring buffer page

The ring_buffer_read_page() takes care of zeroing out any extra data in the
page that it returns. There's no need to zero it out again from the
consumer. It was removed from one consumer of this function, but
read_buffers_splice_read() did not remove it, and worse, it contained a
nasty bug because of it.
