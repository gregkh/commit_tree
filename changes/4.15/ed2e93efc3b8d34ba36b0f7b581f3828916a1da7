s390/qeth: remove duplicated device matching

With commit "s390/ccwgroup: tie a ccwgroup driver to its ccw driver",
the ccwgroup core now ensures that a qeth group device only consists of
ccw devices which are supported by qeth. Therefore remove qeth's
internal device matching, and use .driver_info to determine the card
type.
