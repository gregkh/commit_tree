mm/memory.c: release locked page in do_swap_page()

James reported a bug in swap paging-in from his testing.  It is that
do_swap_page doesn't release locked page so system hang-up happens due
to a deadlock on PG_locked.

It was introduced by 0bcac06f27d7 ("mm, swap: skip swapcache for swapin
of synchronous device") because I missed swap cache hit places to update
swapcache variable to work well with other logics against swapcache in
do_swap_page.

This patch fixes it.
