powerpc/powernv/idle: Round up latency and residency values

On PowerNV platforms, firmware provides exit latency and
target residency for each of the idle states in nano
seconds.  Cpuidle framework expects the values in micro
seconds.  Round up to nearest micro seconds to avoid errors
in cases where the values are defined as fractional micro
seconds.

Default idle state of 'snooze' has exit latency of zero.  If
other states have fractional micro second exit latency, they
would get rounded down to zero micro second and make cpuidle
framework choose deeper idle state when snooze loop is the
right choice.
