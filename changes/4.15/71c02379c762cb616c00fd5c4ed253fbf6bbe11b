tcp: Configure TFO without cookie per socket and/or per route

We already allow to enable TFO without a cookie by using the
fastopen-sysctl and setting it to TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD (or
TFO_CLIENT_NO_COOKIE).
This is safe to do in certain environments where we know that there
isn't a malicous host (aka., data-centers) or when the
application-protocol already provides an authentication mechanism in the
first flight of data.

A server however might be providing multiple services or talking to both
sides (public Internet and data-center). So, this server would want to
enable cookie-less TFO for certain services and/or for connections that
go to the data-center.

This patch exposes a socket-option and a per-route attribute to enable such
fine-grained configurations.
