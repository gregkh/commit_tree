bridge: netlink: make setlink/dellink notifications more accurate

Before this patch we had cases that either sent notifications when there
were in fact no changes (e.g. non-existent vlan delete) or didn't send
notifications when there were changes (e.g. vlan add range with an error in
the middle, port flags change + vlan update error). This patch sends down
a boolean to the functions setlink/dellink use and if there is even a
single configuration change (port flag, vlan add/del, port state) then
we always send a notification. This is all done to keep backwards
compatibility with the opportunistic vlan delete, where one could
specify a vlan range that has missing vlans inside and still everything
in that range will be cleared, this is mostly used to clear the whole
vlan config with a single call, i.e. range 1-4094.
