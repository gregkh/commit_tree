ARC: handle gcc generated __builtin_trap()

gcc toggle -fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference (default at -O2
onwards) isolates faulty code paths such as null pointer access, divide
by zero etc by emitting __builtin_trap()

Newer ARC gcc generates TRAP_S 5 instruction which needs to be handled
and treated like any other unexpected exception
  - user mode  : task terminated with a SEGV
  - kernel mode: die() called after register and stack dump
