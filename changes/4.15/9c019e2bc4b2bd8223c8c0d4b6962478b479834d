bpf: change helper bpf_probe_read arg2 type to ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO

The helper bpf_probe_read arg2 type is changed
from ARG_CONST_SIZE to ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO to permit
size-0 buffer. Together with newer ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO
semantics which allows non-NULL buffer with size 0,
this allows simpler bpf programs with verifier acceptance.
The previous commit which changes ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO semantics
has details on examples.
