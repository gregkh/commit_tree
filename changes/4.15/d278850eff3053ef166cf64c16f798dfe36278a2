btrfs: remove delayed_ref_node from ref_head

This is just excessive information in the ref_head, and makes the code
complicated.  It is a relic from when we had the heads and the refs in
the same tree, which is no longer the case.  With this removal I've
cleaned up a bunch of the cruft around this old assumption as well.
