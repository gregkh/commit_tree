powerpc: Define set_thread_uses_vas()

A CP_ABORT instruction is required in processes that have mapped a VAS
"paste address" with the intention of using COPY/PASTE instructions.
But since CP_ABORT is expensive, we want to restrict it to only
processes that use/intend to use COPY/PASTE.

Define an interface, set_thread_uses_vas(), that VAS can use to
indicate that the current process opened a send window. During context
switch, issue CP_ABORT only for processes that have the flag set.

Thanks for input from Nick Piggin, Michael Ellerman.
