mm/cma.c: change pr_info to pr_err for cma_alloc fail log

It was observed that under cma_alloc fail log, pr_info was used instead
of pr_err.  This will lead to problems if printk debug level is set to
below 7.  In this case the cma_alloc failure log will not be captured in
the log and it will be difficult to debug.

Simply replace the pr_info with pr_err to capture failure log.
