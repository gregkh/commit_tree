ACPI: CPPC: remove initial assignment of pcc_ss_data

The initialization of pcc_ss_data from pcc_data[pcc_ss_id] before
pcc_ss_id is being range checked could lead to an out-of-bounds array
read.  This very same initialization is also being performed after
the range check on pcc_ss_id, so we can just remove this problematic
and also redundant assignment to fix the issue.

Detected by cppcheck:
warning: Value stored to 'pcc_ss_data' during its initialization is never
read
