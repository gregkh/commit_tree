mlxsw: spectrum: Relax sanity checks during enslavement

Since commit 25cc72a33835 ("mlxsw: spectrum: Forbid linking to devices that
have uppers") the driver forbids enslavement to netdevs that already
have uppers of their own, as this can result in various ordering
problems.

This requirement proved to be too strict for some users who need to be
able to enslave ports to a bridge that already has uppers. In this case,
we can allow the enslavement if the bridge is already known to us, as
any configuration performed on top of the bridge was already reflected
to the device.
