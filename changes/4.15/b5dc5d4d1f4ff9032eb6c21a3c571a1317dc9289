block,bfq: Disable writeback throttling

Similarly to CFQ, BFQ has its write-throttling heuristics, and it
is better not to combine them with further write-throttling
heuristics of a different nature.
So this commit disables write-back throttling for a device if BFQ
is used as I/O scheduler for that device.
