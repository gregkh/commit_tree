ASoC: add Component level pcm_new/pcm_free v2

In current ALSA SoC, Platform only has pcm_new/pcm_free feature,
but it should be supported on Component level. This patch adds it.

The v1 was added commit 99b04f4c4051f7 ("ASoC: add Component level
pcm_new/pcm_free") but it called all "card" connected component's
pcm_new/free, it was wrong.
This patch calls "rtd" connected component.
