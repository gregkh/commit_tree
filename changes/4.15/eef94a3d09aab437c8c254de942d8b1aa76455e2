arm64: move TASK_* definitions to <asm/processor.h>

ILP32 series [1] introduces the dependency on <asm/is_compat.h> for
TASK_SIZE macro. Which in turn requires <asm/thread_info.h>, and
<asm/thread_info.h> include <asm/memory.h>, giving a circular dependency,
because TASK_SIZE is currently located in <asm/memory.h>.

In other architectures, TASK_SIZE is defined in <asm/processor.h>, and
moving TASK_SIZE there fixes the problem.
