drm/amdgpu: busywait KIQ register accessing (v4)

Register accessing is performed when IRQ is disabled. Never sleep in
this function.

Known issue: dead sleep in many use cases of index/data registers.

v2:
 - wrap polling fence functions.
 - don't trigger IRQ for polling in case of wrongly fence signal.

v3:
 - handle wrap round gracefully.
 - add comments for polling function

v4:
 - don't return negative timeout confused with error code
