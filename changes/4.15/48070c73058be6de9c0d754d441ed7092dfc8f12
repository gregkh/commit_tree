s390/pci: do not require AIS facility

As of today QEMU does not provide the AIS facility to its guest.  This
prevents Linux guests from using PCI devices as the ais facility is
checked during init. As this is just a performance optimization, we can
move the ais check into the code where we need it (calling the SIC
instruction). This is used at initialization and on interrupt. Both
places do not require any serialization, so we can simply skip the
instruction.

Since we will now get all interrupts, we can also avoid the 2nd scan.
As we can have multiple interrupts in parallel we might trigger spurious
irqs more often for the non-AIS case but the core code can handle that.
