ipv6: remove from fib tree aged out RTF_CACHE dst

The commit 2b760fcf5cfb ("ipv6: hook up exception table to store
dst cache") partially reverted the commit 1e2ea8ad37be ("ipv6: set
dst.obsolete when a cached route has expired").

As a result, RTF_CACHE dst referenced outside the fib tree will
not be removed until the next sernum change; dst_check() does not
fail on aged-out dst, and dst->__refcnt can't decrease: the aged
out dst will stay valid for a potentially unlimited time after the
timeout expiration.

This change explicitly removes RTF_CACHE dst from the fib tree when
aged out. The rt6_remove_exception() logic will then obsolete the
dst and other entities will drop the related reference on next
dst_check().

pMTU exceptions are not aged-out, and are removed from the exception
table only when the - usually considerably longer - ip6_rt_mtu_expires
timeout expires.

v1 -> v2:
  - do not touch dst.obsolete in rt6_remove_exception(), not needed
v2 -> v3:
  - take care of pMTU exceptions, too
