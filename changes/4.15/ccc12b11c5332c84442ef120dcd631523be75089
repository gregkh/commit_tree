ipv6: sr: fix TLVs not being copied using setsockopt

Function ipv6_push_rthdr4 allows to add an IPv6 Segment Routing Header
to a socket through setsockopt, but the current implementation doesn't
copy possible TLVs at the end of the SRH received from userspace.

Therefore, the execution of the following branch if (sr_has_hmac(sr_phdr))
{ ... } will never complete since the len and type fields of a possible
HMAC TLV are not copied, hence seg6_get_tlv_hmac will return an error,
and the HMAC will not be computed.

This commit adds a memcpy in case TLVs have been appended to the SRH.
