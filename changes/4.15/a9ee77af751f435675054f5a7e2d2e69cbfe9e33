Bluetooth: avoid recursive locking in hci_send_to_channel()

Mart reported a deadlock in -RT in the call path:
  hci_send_monitor_ctrl_event() -> hci_send_to_channel()

because both functions acquire the same read lock hci_sk_list.lock. This
is also a mainline issue because the qrwlock implementation is writer
fair (the traditional rwlock implementation is reader biased).

To avoid the deadlock there is now __hci_send_to_channel() which expects
the readlock to be held.
