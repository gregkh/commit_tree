i2c: Allow overriding dev_name through board_info

For devices not instantiated through ACPI the i2c-client's device-name
gets set to <busnr>-<addr> by default, e.g. "0-0022" this means that
the device-name is dependent on the order in which the i2c-busses are
enumerated.

In some cases having a predictable constant device-name is desirable,
for example on non device-tree platforms the link between a regulator
and its consumers is specified by the platform code by setting
regulator_init_data.consumers. This array identifies the regulator's
consumers by dev_name and supply(-name). Which requires a constant
dev_name.

This commit adds a dev_name field to i2c_board_info allowing
platform code to set a contstant dev_name so that the device can
be identified by its dev_name in other platform code.
