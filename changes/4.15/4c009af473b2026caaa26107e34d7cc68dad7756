IB/hfi: Only read capability registers if the capability exists

During driver init, various registers are saved to allow restoration
after an FLR or gen3 bump.  Some of these registers are not available
in some circumstances (i.e. Virtual machines).

This bug makes the driver unusable when the PCI device is passed into
a VM, it fails during probe.

Delete unnecessary register read/write, and only access register if
the capability exists.
