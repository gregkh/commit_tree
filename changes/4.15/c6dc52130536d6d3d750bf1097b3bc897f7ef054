net: hns3: hns3:fix a bug about statistic counter in reset process

All member of Struct hdev->hw_stats is initialized to 0 as hdev is
allocated by devm_kzalloc. But in reset process, hdev will not be
allocated again, so need clear hdev->hw_stats in reset process, otherwise
the statistic will be wrong after reset. This patch set all of the
statistic counters to zero after reset.
