fm10k: avoid needless delay when loading driver

When we load the driver, we set the last_reset to be in the future,
which delays the initial driver reset. Additionally, the service task
isn't scheduled to run automatically until the timer runs out. This
causes a needless delay of the first reset to begin talking to the
switch manager.

We can avoid this by simply not setting last_reset and immediately
scheduling the service task while in probe. This allows the device to
wake up faster, and avoids this delay.
