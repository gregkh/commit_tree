clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: Add support to restore core clocks during resume

On R-Car Gen3 systems, PSCI system suspend powers down the SoC, possibly
losing clock configuration.  Hence add a notifier chain that can be used
by core clocks to save/restore clock state during system suspend/resume.

The implementation of the actual clock state save/restore operations is
clock-specific, and to be registered with the notifier chain in the SoC
or family-specific cpg_mssr_info.cpg_clk_register() callback.
