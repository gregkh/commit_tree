EDAC: Add owner check to the x86 platform drivers

Change x86 EDAC platform drivers to verify the module owner at the
beginning of their module init functions. This allows them to fail their
init immediately when ghes_edac is enabled. Similar change can be made
to other edac drivers if necessary.

Also, remove ".c" from module names of pnp2_edac, sb_edac, and skx_edac.
