KVM: nVMX: Fix EPT switching advertising

I can use vmxcap tool to observe "EPTP Switching   yes" even if EPT is not
exposed to L1.

EPT switching is advertised unconditionally since it is emulated, however,
it can be treated as an extended feature for EPT and it should not be
advertised if EPT itself is not exposed. This patch fixes it.
