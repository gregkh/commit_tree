nvme: use kref_get_unless_zero in nvme_find_get_ns

For kref_get_unless_zero to protect against lookup vs free races we need
to use it in all places where we aren't guaranteed to already hold a
reference.  There is no such guarantee in nvme_find_get_ns, so switch to
kref_get_unless_zero in this function.
