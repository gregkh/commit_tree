net: Add support for networking over Thunderbolt cable

ThunderboltIP is a protocol created by Apple to tunnel IP/ethernet
traffic over a Thunderbolt cable. The protocol consists of configuration
phase where each side sends ThunderboltIP login packets (the protocol is
determined by UUID in the XDomain packet header) over the configuration
channel. Once both sides get positive acknowledgment to their login
packet, they configure high-speed DMA path accordingly. This DMA path is
then used to transmit and receive networking traffic.

This patch creates a virtual ethernet interface the host software can
use in the same way as any other networking interface. Once the
interface is brought up successfully network packets get tunneled over
the Thunderbolt cable to the remote host and back.

The connection is terminated by sending a ThunderboltIP logout packet
over the configuration channel. We do this when the network interface is
brought down by user or the driver is unloaded.
