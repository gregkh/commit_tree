vt6655: Fix a possible sleep-in-atomic bug in vt6655_suspend

The driver may sleep under a spinlock, and the function call path is:
vt6655_suspend (acquire the spinlock)
  pci_set_power_state
    __pci_start_power_transition (drivers/pci/pci.c)
      msleep --> may sleep

To fix it, pci_set_power_state is called without having a spinlock.

This bug is found by my static analysis tool and my code review.
