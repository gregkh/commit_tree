USB: Fix off by one in type-specific length check of BOS SSP capability

USB 3.1 devices are not detected as 3.1 capable since 4.15-rc3 due to a
off by one in commit 81cf4a45360f ("USB: core: Add type-specific length
check of BOS descriptors")

It uses USB_DT_USB_SSP_CAP_SIZE() to get SSP capability size which takes
the zero based SSAC as argument, not the actual count of sublink speed
attributes.

USB3 spec 9.6.2.5 says "The number of Sublink Speed Attributes = SSAC + 1."

The type-specific length check patch was added to stable and needs to be
fixed there as well
