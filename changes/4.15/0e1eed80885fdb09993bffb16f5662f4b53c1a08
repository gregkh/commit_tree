perf tools: Get all of tools/{arch,include}/ in the MANIFEST

Now that I'm switching the container builds from using a local volume
pointing to the kernel repository with the perf sources, instead getting
a detached tarball to be able to use a container cluster, some places
broke because I forgot to put some of the required files in
tools/perf/MANIFEST, namely some bitsperlong.h files.

So, to fix it do the same as for tools/build/ and pack the whole
tools/arch/ directory.
