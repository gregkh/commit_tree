x86/apic: Avoid wrong warning when parsing 'apic=' in X86-32 case

There are two consumers of apic=:
  apic_set_verbosity() for setting the APIC debug level;
  parse_apic() for registering APIC driver by hand.

X86-32 supports both of them, but sometimes, kernel issues a weird warning.
eg: when kernel was booted up with 'apic=bigsmp' in command line,
early_param would warn like that:

...
[    0.000000] APIC Verbosity level bigsmp not recognised use apic=verbose or apic=debug
[    0.000000] Malformed early option 'apic'
...

Wrap the warning code in CONFIG_X86_64 case to avoid this.
