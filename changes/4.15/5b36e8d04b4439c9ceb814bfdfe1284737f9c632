i40evf: Enable VF to request an alternate queue allocation

Currently the VF gets a default number of allocated queues from HW on
init and it could choose to enable or disable those allocated queues.
This makes it such that the VF can request more or less underlying
allocated queues from the PF.

First the VF negotiates the number of queues it wants that can be
supported by the PF and if successful asks for a reset.  During reset
the PF will reallocate the HW queues for the VF and will then remap the
new queues.
