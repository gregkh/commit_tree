ARM: OMAP2+: Fix MMC address space mismatch for am33xx and am43xx

The address space currently set up for the interconnect data
is different compared to the dts data. We have hwmod data with
offset 0x100 to account for the revision, sysc and syss
register offsets. Let's fix the issue by correcting the MMC
register offsets in hwmod data and removing the unnecessary
duplicate IO range data that we get from device tree anyways.
