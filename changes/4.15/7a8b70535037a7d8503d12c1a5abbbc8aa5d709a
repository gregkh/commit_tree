Revert "drm/i915: Display WA #1133 WaFbcSkipSegments:cnl, glk"

This reverts commit 8f067837c4b713ce2e69be95af7b2a5eb3bd7de8.

HSD says "WA withdrawn. It was causing corruption with some images.
WA is not strictly necessary since this bug just causes loss of FBC
compression with some sizes and images, but doesn't break anything."
