openrisc: use shadow registers to save regs on exception

Previously, the area between 0x0-0x100 have been used as a "scratch"
memory area to temporarily store regs during exception entry. In a
multi-core environment, this will not work.

This change is to use shadow registers for nested context.

Currently only the "critical" temp load/stores are covered, the
EMERGENCY_PRINT ones are left as is (when they are used, it's game over
anyway), they need to be handled as well in the future.
