ipv6: fix dereference of rt6_ex before null check error

Currently rt6_ex is being dereferenced before it is null checked
hence there is a possible null dereference bug. Fix this by only
dereferencing rt6_ex after it has been null checked.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1457749 ("Dereference before null check")
