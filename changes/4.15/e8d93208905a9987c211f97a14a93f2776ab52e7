ASoC: samsung: Use 'samsung-i2s' cpu_dai for dai_links

Add specific cpu_dai_name to dai_link because samsung i2s driver registers
two dais and components. Selecting one of them clearly is needed more
information like cpu_dai_name, of_node. The reason why the dai_links have
to use 'samsung-i2s' for cpu_dai is that 'samsung-i2s-sec' doesn't have a
capture functionality.

Without this code, cpu_dai will be selected the first one of the
component_list. For example, if I describe nothing to cpu_dai_name,
'samsung-i2s-sec' might be selected to HiFi Primay.
