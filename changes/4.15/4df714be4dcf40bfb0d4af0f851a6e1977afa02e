locking/atomic: Add atomic_cond_read_acquire()

smp_cond_load_acquire() provides a way to spin on a variable with acquire
semantics until some conditional expression involving the variable is
satisfied. Architectures such as arm64 can potentially enter a low-power
state, waking up only when the value of the variable changes, which
reduces the system impact of tight polling loops.

This patch makes the same interface available to users of atomic_t,
atomic64_t and atomic_long_t, rather than require messy accesses to the
structure internals.
