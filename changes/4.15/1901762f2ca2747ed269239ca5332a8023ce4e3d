scsi: lpfc: fix pci hot plug crash in timer management routines

During pci hot plug, the kernel crashes in timer management code.

The sli4 remove_one handler is not stoping the timers as it starts to
remove the port so that it can be swapped.

Fix: Stop the timers early in the handler routine.

Note: Fix in SLI-4 only. SLI-3 already stopped the timers properly.
