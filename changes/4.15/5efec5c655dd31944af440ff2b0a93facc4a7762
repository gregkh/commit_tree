xfrm: Fix eth_hdr(skb)->h_proto to reflect inner IP version

IPSec tunnel mode supports encapsulation of IPv4 over IPv6 and vice-versa.

The outer IP header is stripped and the inner IP inherits the original
Ethernet header. Tcpdump fails to properly decode the inner packet in
case that h_proto is different than the inner IP version.

Fix h_proto to reflect the inner IP version.
