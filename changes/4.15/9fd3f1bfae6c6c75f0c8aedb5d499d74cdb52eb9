drm/amdkfd: Improve process termination handling

Separate device queue termination from process queue manager
termination. Unmap all queues at once instead of one at a time.
Unmap device queues before the PASID is unbound, in the
kfd_process_iommu_unbind_callback.

When resetting wavefronts in non-HWS mode, do it before the VMID is
released.
