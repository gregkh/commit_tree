iommu/iova: Use raw_cpu_ptr() instead of get_cpu_ptr() for ->fq

get_cpu_ptr() disabled preemption and returns the ->fq object of the
current CPU. raw_cpu_ptr() does the same except that it not disable
preemption which means the scheduler can move it to another CPU after it
obtained the per-CPU object.
In this case this is not bad because the data structure itself is
protected with a spin_lock. This change shouldn't matter however on RT
it does because the sleeping lock can't be accessed with disabled
preemption.
