gpio: Introduce ->get_multiple callback

SPI-attached GPIO controllers typically read out all inputs in one go.
If callers desire the values of multipe inputs, ideally a single readout
should take place to return the desired values.  However the current
driver API only offers a ->get callback but no ->get_multiple (unlike
->set_multiple, which is present).  Thus, to read multiple inputs, a
full readout needs to be performed for every single value (barring
driver-internal caching), which is inefficient.

In fact, the lack of a ->get_multiple callback has been bemoaned
repeatedly by the gpio subsystem maintainer:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-gpio/msg10571.html
http://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg121734.html

Introduce the missing callback.  Add corresponding consumer functions
such as gpiod_get_array_value().  Amend linehandle_ioctl() to take
advantage of the newly added infrastructure.  Update the documentation.
