[media] media: lirc_zilog: add a pointer to the parent device to struct IR

lirc_zilog stashes a pointer to the parent device in struct lirc_dev
and uses it for logging. It makes more sense to let lirc_zilog keep
track of that pointer in its own struct (this is in preparation for
subsequent patches which will remodel struct lirc_dev).
