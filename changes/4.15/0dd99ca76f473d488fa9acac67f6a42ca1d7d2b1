f2fs: validate before set/clear free nat bitmap

In flush_nat_entries, all dirty nats will be flushed and if
their new address isn't NULL_ADDR, their bitmaps will be updated,
the free_nid_count of the bitmaps will be increaced regardless
of whether the nats have already been occupied before.
This could lead to wrong free_nid_count.
So this patch checks the status of the bits beforeactually
set/clear them.
