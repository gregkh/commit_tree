drm/nouveau/bar: prevent BAR2 mapping of objects during destructor

GP100's page table nests a lot more deeply than the GF100-compatible
layout we're currently using, which means our hackish-but-simple way
of dealing with BAR2 VMM teardown won't work anymore.

In order to sanely handle the chicken-and-egg (BAR2's PTs get mapped
into themselves) problem, we need prevent page tables getting mapped
back into BAR2 during the destruction of its VMM.

To do this, we simply key off the state that's now maintained by the
BAR2 init/fini functions.
