powerpc/lib/sstep: Fix fixed-point shift instructions that set CA32

This fixes the emulated behaviour of existing fixed-point shift right
algebraic instructions that are supposed to set both the CA and CA32
bits of XER when running on a system that is compliant with POWER ISA
v3.0 independent of whether the system is executing in 32-bit mode or
64-bit mode. The following instructions are affected:
  * Shift Right Algebraic Word Immediate (srawi[.])
  * Shift Right Algebraic Word (sraw[.])
  * Shift Right Algebraic Doubleword Immediate (sradi[.])
  * Shift Right Algebraic Doubleword (srad[.])
