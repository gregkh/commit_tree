drm/pl111: Replace custom connector with panel bridge

This replaces the custom connector in the PL111 with the
panel bridge helper.

This works nicely for all standard panels, but since there
are several PL11x-based systems that will need to use the dumb
VGA connector bridge we use drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge()
and make some headroom for dealing with bridges that are
not panels as well, and drop a TODO in the code.
