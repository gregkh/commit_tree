clk: Add devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider()/del_provider() APIs

Sometimes we only have one of_clk_del_provider() call in driver
error and remove paths, because we're missing a
devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider() API. Introduce the API so we can
convert drivers to use this and potentially reduce the amount of
code needed to remove providers in drivers.
