kvm: arm64: handle single-step of hyp emulated mmio instructions

There is a fast-path of MMIO emulation inside hyp mode. The handling
of single-step is broadly the same as kvm_arm_handle_step_debug()
except we just setup ESR/HSR so handle_exit() does the correct thing
as we exit.

For the case of an emulated illegal access causing an SError we will
exit via the ARM_EXCEPTION_EL1_SERROR path in handle_exit(). We behave
as we would during a real SError and clear the DBG_SPSR_SS bit for the
emulated instruction.
