serial: sh-sci: suppress warning for ports without dma channels

If a port has no dma channel defined in the device tree, then
don't attempt to allocate a dma channel for the port.
Also suppress the warning message concerning the failure to allocate
a dma channel.  Continue to emit the warning message if a dma
channel is defined but cannot be allocated.
