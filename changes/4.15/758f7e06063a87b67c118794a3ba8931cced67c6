bcma: Use bcma_debug and not pr_cont in MIPS driver

Commit 66cc04424960 ("bcma: use bcma_debug and pr_cont in MIPS driver")
converted a printk(KERN_DEBUG to bcma_debug.

bcma_debug is guarded by a #define DEBUG via pr_debug.

This means that the bcma_debug will generally not be emitted
but any pr_cont following the bcma_debug will be emitted.

Correct this by removing the uses of pr_cont by using a temporary.
