selftests/bpf: fix Makefile for passing LLC to the command line

Makefile has a LLC variable that is initialised to "llc", but can
theoretically be overridden from the command line ("make LLC=llc-6.0").
However, this fails because for LLVM probe check, "llc" is called
directly. Use the $(LLC) variable instead to fix this.
