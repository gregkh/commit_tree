drm/tilcdc: Precalculate total frametime in tilcdc_crtc_set_mode()

We need the total frame refresh time to check if we are too close to
vertical sync when updating the two framebuffer DMA registers and risk
a collision. This new method is more accurate that the previous that
based on mode's vrefresh value, which itself is inaccurate or may not
even be initialized.
