ASoC: codecs: msm8916-wcd-analog: configure micbias in mbhc setup

The very first time a headset is plugged in, detection is unreliable
because bias hasn't been configured yet, it's done once a mechanical
insertion interrupt has been triggered, so following insertions (and
thus detections) are not affected.

To fix the very first detection, the bias must also be configured in the
function that setup the MBHC. Move pm8916_wcd_setup_mbhc after
pm8916_mbhc_configure_bias to avoid a forward declaration.
