mfd: fsl-imx25: Clean up irq settings during removal

When fsl-imx25-tsadc is compiled as a module, loading, unloading and
reloading the module will lead to a crash.

Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address bf005430
[<c004df6c>] (irq_find_matching_fwspec)
   from [<c028d5ec>] (of_irq_get+0x58/0x74)
[<c028d594>] (of_irq_get)
   from [<c01ff970>] (platform_get_irq+0x48/0xc8)

   from [<bf00e33c>] (mx25_tsadc_probe+0x220/0x2f4 [fsl_imx25_tsadc])

irq_find_matching_fwspec() loops over all registered irq domains. The
irq domain is still registered from last time the module was loaded but
the pointer to its operations is invalid after the module was unloaded.

Add a removal function which clears the irq handler and removes the irq
domain. With this cleanup in place, it's possible to unload and reload
the module.
