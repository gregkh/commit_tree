xen: support priv-mapping in an HVM tools domain

If the domain has XENFEAT_auto_translated_physmap then use of the PV-
specific HYPERVISOR_mmu_update hypercall is clearly incorrect.

This patch adds checks in xen_remap_domain_gfn_array() and
xen_unmap_domain_gfn_array() which call through to the approprate
xlate_mmu function if the feature is present. A check is also added
to xen_remap_domain_gfn_range() to fail with -EOPNOTSUPP since this
should not be used in an HVM tools domain.
