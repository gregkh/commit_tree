ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_max98090: remove useless code, align with ChromeOS driver

Remove dead code which was missed in previous changes. This is not
visible with git diff but there is a test+return on the same condition
just above.

Also reuse local variable instead of fetching the jack information twice.

Tested on Acer R11 (cyan)
