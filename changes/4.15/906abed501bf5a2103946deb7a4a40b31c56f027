xfs: iterate over extents in xfs_bmap_extents_to_btree

This actually makes the function very slightly less efficient for now as we
detour through the expanded irect format between the in-core extent format
and the on-disk one instead of just endian swapping them.  But with the
incore extent btree the in-core one will use a different format and the
representation will be entirely hidden.
