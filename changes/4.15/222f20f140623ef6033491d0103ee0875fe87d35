powerpc/64s: Simple RFI macro conversions

This commit does simple conversions of rfi/rfid to the new macros that
include the expected destination context. By simple we mean cases
where there is a single well known destination context, and it's
simply a matter of substituting the instruction for the appropriate
macro.
