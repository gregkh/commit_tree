ovl: re-structure overlay lower layers in-memory

Define new structures to represent overlay instance lower layers and
overlay merge dir lower layers to make room for storing more per layer
information in-memory.

Instead of keeping the fs instance lower layers in an array of struct
vfsmount, keep them in an array of new struct ovl_layer, that has a
pointer to struct vfsmount.

Instead of keeping the dentry lower layers in an array of struct path,
keep them in an array of new struct ovl_path, that has a pointer to
struct dentry and to struct ovl_layer.

Add a small helper to find the fs layer id that correspopnds to a lower
struct ovl_path and use it in ovl_lookup().
