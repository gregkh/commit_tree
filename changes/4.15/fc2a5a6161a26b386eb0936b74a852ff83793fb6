powerpc/64s: ppc_save_regs is now needed for all 64s builds

Commit 78adf6c214f0 ("powerpc/64s: Implement system reset idle wakeup
reason"), added a call to ppc_save_regs() in the book3s code.

ppc_save_regs() is only built if XMON and/or KEXEC_CORE are enabled,
which is usually the case, however if they're not enabled then the
build breaks.

Fix it by making the Makefile check also build ppc_save_regs.o if
CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S is enabled.
