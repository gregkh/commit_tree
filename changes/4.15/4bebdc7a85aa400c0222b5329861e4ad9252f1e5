bpf: add helper bpf_perf_prog_read_value

This patch adds helper bpf_perf_prog_read_cvalue for perf event based bpf
programs, to read event counter and enabled/running time.
The enabled/running time is accumulated since the perf event open.

The typical use case for perf event based bpf program is to attach itself
to a single event. In such cases, if it is desirable to get scaling factor
between two bpf invocations, users can can save the time values in a map,
and use the value from the map and the current value to calculate
the scaling factor.
