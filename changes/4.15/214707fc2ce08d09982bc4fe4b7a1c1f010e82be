drm/i915/selftests: Wrap a timer into a i915_sw_fence

For some selftests, we want to issue requests but delay them going to
hardware. Furthermore, we don't want those requests to block
indefinitely (or else we may hang the driver and block testing) so we
want to employ a timeout. So naturally we want a fence that is
automatically signaled by a timer.

v2: Add kselftests.
v3: Limit the API available to selftests; there isn't an overwhelming
reason to export it universally.
