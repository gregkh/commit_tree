ARM: 8702/1: head-common.S: Clear lr before jumping to start_kernel()

If CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y, the kernel log is spammed with a few
hundred identical messages:

    unwind: Unknown symbol address c0800300
    unwind: Index not found c0800300

c0800300 is the return address from the last subroutine call (to
__memzero()) in __mmap_switched().  Apparently having this address in
the link register confuses the unwinder.

To fix this, reset the link register to zero before jumping to
start_kernel().
