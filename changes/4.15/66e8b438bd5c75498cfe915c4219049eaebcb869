mm/memblock.c: make the index explicit argument of for_each_memblock_type

for_each_memblock_type macro function relies on idx variable defined in
the caller context.  Silent macro arguments are almost always wrong
thing to do.  They make code harder to read and easier to get wrong.
Let's use an explicit iterator parameter for for_each_memblock_type and
make the code more obious.  This patch is a mere cleanup and it
shouldn't introduce any functional change.
