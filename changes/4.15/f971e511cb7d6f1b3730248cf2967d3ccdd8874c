tools/perf: Convert ACCESS_ONCE() to READ_ONCE()

Recently there was a treewide conversion of ACCESS_ONCE() to
{READ,WRITE}_ONCE(), but a new use was introduced concurrently by
commit:

  1695849735752d2a ("perf mmap: Move perf_mmap and methods to separate mmap.[ch] files")

Let's convert this over to READ_ONCE() so that we can remove the
ACCESS_ONCE() definitions in subsequent patches.
