USB: serial: Change DbC debug device binding ID

The product ID for "Linux USB GDB Target device" has been
changed. Change the driver binding table accordingly.

This patch should be back-ported to kernels as old as v4.12,
that contain the commit 57fb47279a04 ("usb/serial: Add DBC
debug device support to usb_debug").
