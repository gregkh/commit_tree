xprtrdma: Clean up SGE accounting in rpcrdma_prepare_msg_sges()

Clean up. rpcrdma_prepare_hdr_sge() sets num_sge to one, then
rpcrdma_prepare_msg_sges() sets num_sge again to the count of SGEs
it added, plus one for the header SGE just mapped in
rpcrdma_prepare_hdr_sge(). This is confusing, and nails in an
assumption about when these functions are called.

Instead, maintain a running count that both functions can update
with just the number of SGEs they have added to the SGE array.
