module: export module signature enforcement status

A static variable sig_enforce is used as status var to indicate the real
value of CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE, once this one is set the var will hold
true, but if the CONFIG is not set the status var will hold whatever
value is present in the module.sig_enforce kernel cmdline param: true
when =1 and false when =0 or not present.

Considering this cmdline param take place over the CONFIG value when
it's not set, other places in the kernel could misbehave since they
would have only the CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE value to rely on. Exporting
this status var allows the kernel to rely in the effective value of
module signature enforcement, being it from CONFIG value or cmdline
param.
