net: mvpp2: allocate zeroed tx descriptors

Reserved and unused fields in the Tx descriptors should be 0. The PPv2
driver doesn't clear them at run-time (for performance reasons) but
these descriptors aren't zeroed when allocated, which can lead to
unpredictable behaviors. This patch fixes this by using
dma_zalloc_coherent instead of dma_alloc_coherent.
