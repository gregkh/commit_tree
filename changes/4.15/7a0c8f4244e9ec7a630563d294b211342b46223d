IB/mlx5: Support padded 128B CQE feature

In some benchmarks and some CPU architectures, writing the CQE on a full
cache line size improves performance by saving memory access operations
(read-modify-write) relative to partial cache line change. This patch
lets the user to configure the device to pad the CQE up to 128B in case
its content is less than 128B. Currently the driver supports only padding
for a CQE size of 128B.
