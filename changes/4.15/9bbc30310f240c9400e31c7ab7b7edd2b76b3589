drm/amd/display: Remove a false-positive error message

To avoid confusion, need to suppress the error message when get
-ERESTARTSYS error code. It is normal when getting interrupted
by signals in the process of a wait for the buffer to become
unreserved. Only propagate to user-mode for further action,
no need to pop up error message.
