rtlwifi: rtl8192ee: Fix memory leak when loading firmware

In routine rtl92ee_set_fw_rsvdpagepkt(), the driver allocates an skb, but
never calls rtl_cmd_send_packet(), which will free the buffer. All other
rtlwifi drivers perform this operation correctly.

This problem has been in the driver since it was included in the kernel.
Fortunately, each firmware load only leaks 4 buffers, which likely
explains why it has not previously been detected.
