net: hns3: fix a bug for phy supported feature initialization

This patch fixes a bug for phy supported feature initialization.
Currently, the value of phydev->supported is initialized by kernel.
So it includes many features that we do not support, such as
SUPPORTED_FIBRE and SUPPORTED_BNC. This patch fixes it.
