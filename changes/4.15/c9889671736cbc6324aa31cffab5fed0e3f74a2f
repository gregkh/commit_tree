qtnfmac: pass all CONNECT cmd params to wireless card for processing

Specifically, following parameters are needed for wireless device
configuration but were not available to it before:
- HT/VHT capabilities and capabilities masks.
- full channel info (not just IEEE number)
- BSSID hint
- previous BSSID for reassoc request

Move Management Frame Protection setting from common encr info
structure into STA-specific .connect command parameters.

Make sure that all new qlink structure definitions are alignment-safe.
