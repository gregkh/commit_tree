powerpc/xmon: Avoid tripping SMP hardlockup watchdog

The SMP hardlockup watchdog cross-checks other CPUs for lockups, which
causes xmon headaches because it's assuming interrupts hard disabled
means no watchdog troubles. Try to improve that by calling
touch_nmi_watchdog() in obvious places where secondaries are spinning.

Also annotate these spin loops with spin_begin/end calls.
