net: fix incorrect comment with regard to VLAN packet handling

The commit bcc6d4790361 ("net: vlan: make non-hw-accel rx path similar
to hw-accel") unified accel and non-accel path for VLAN RX. With that
fix we do not register any packet_type handler for VLANs anymore, so fix
the incorrect comment.
