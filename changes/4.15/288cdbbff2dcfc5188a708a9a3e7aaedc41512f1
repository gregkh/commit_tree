ARM: dts: Add missing hwmod related properties for dra7

On dra7 we're missing two "ti,hwmods" properties that the SoC
interconnect code needs. For hdq 1-wire, we need to add the
node for that.

Note that this will only show up as a bug with "doesn't have
mpu register target base" boot errors when the legacy platform
data is removed.
