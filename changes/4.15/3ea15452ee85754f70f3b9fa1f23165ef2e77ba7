nl80211: Check for the required netlink attribute presence

nl80211_nan_add_func() does not check if the required attribute
NL80211_NAN_FUNC_FOLLOW_UP_DEST is present when processing
NL80211_CMD_ADD_NAN_FUNCTION request. This request can be issued
by users with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege and may result in NULL dereference
and a system crash. Add a check for the required attribute presence.
