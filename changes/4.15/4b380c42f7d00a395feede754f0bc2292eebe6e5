netfilter: nfnetlink_cthelper: Add missing permission checks

The capability check in nfnetlink_rcv() verifies that the caller
has CAP_NET_ADMIN in the namespace that "owns" the netlink socket.
However, nfnl_cthelper_list is shared by all net namespaces on the
system.  An unprivileged user can create user and net namespaces
in which he holds CAP_NET_ADMIN to bypass the netlink_net_capable()
check:

    $ nfct helper list
    nfct v1.4.4: netlink error: Operation not permitted
    $ vpnns -- nfct helper list
    {
            .name = ftp,
            .queuenum = 0,
            .l3protonum = 2,
            .l4protonum = 6,
            .priv_data_len = 24,
            .status = enabled,
    };

Add capable() checks in nfnetlink_cthelper, as this is cleaner than
trying to generalize the solution.
