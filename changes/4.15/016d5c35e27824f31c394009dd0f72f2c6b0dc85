scsi: mpt3sas: SGL to PRP Translation for I/Os to NVMe devices

* Added support for translating the SGLs associated with incoming
commands either to IEE SGL or NVMe PRPs for NVMe devices.

* The hardware translation of IEEE SGL to NVMe PRPs has limitations
and if a command cannot be translated by hardware then it will go to
firmware and the firmware needs to translate it. This will have a
performance impact. To avoid that, the driver proactively checks
whether the translation will be done in hardware or not. If not, then
driver translates.
