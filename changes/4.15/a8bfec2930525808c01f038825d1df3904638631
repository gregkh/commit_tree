KVM: x86: ioapic: Clear Remote IRR when entry is switched to edge-triggered

Some OSes (Linux, Xen) use this behavior to clear the Remote IRR bit for
IOAPICs without an EOI register. They simulate the EOI message manually
by changing the trigger mode to edge and then back to level, with the
entry being masked during this.

QEMU implements this feature in commit ed1263c363c9
("ioapic: clear remote irr bit for edge-triggered interrupts")

As a side effect, this commit removes an incorrect behavior where Remote
IRR was cleared when the redirection table entry was rewritten. This is not
consistent with the manual and also opens an opportunity for a strange
behavior when a redirection table entry is modified from an interrupt
handler that handles the same entry: The modification will clear the
Remote IRR bit even though the interrupt handler is still running.
