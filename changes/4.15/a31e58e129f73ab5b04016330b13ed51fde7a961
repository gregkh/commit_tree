x86/apic: Switch all APICs to Fixed delivery mode

Some of the APIC incarnations are operating in lowest priority delivery
mode. This worked as long as the vector management code allocated the same
vector on all possible CPUs for each interrupt.

Lowest priority delivery mode does not necessarily respect the affinity
setting and may redirect to some other online CPU. This was documented
somewhere in the old code and the conversion to single target delivery
missed to update the delivery mode of the affected APIC drivers which
results in spurious interrupts on some of the affected CPU/Chipset
combinations.

Switch the APIC drivers over to Fixed delivery mode and remove all
leftovers of lowest priority delivery mode.

Switching to Fixed delivery mode is not a problem on these CPUs because the
kernel already uses Fixed delivery mode for IPIs. The reason for this is
that th SDM explicitely forbids lowest prio mode for IPIs. The reason is
obvious: If the irq routing does not honor destination targets in lowest
prio mode then an IPI targeted at CPU1 might end up on CPU0, which would be
a fatal problem in many cases.

As a consequence of this change, the apic::irq_delivery_mode field is now
pointless, but this needs to be cleaned up in a separate patch.
