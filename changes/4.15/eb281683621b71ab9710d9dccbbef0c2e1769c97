serdev: ttyport: add missing receive_buf sanity checks

The receive_buf tty-port callback should return the number of bytes
accepted and must specifically never return a negative errno (or a value
larger than the buffer size) to the tty layer.

A serdev driver not providing a receive_buf callback would currently
cause the flush_to_ldisc() worker to spin in a tight loop when the tty
buffer pointers are incremented with -EINVAL (-22) after data has been
received.

A serdev driver occasionally returning a negative errno (or a too large
byte count) could cause information leaks or crashes when accessing
memory outside the tty buffers in consecutive callbacks.
