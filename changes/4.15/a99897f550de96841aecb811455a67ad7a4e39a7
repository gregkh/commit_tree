ARM: exynos_defconfig: Enable UAS support for Odroid HC1 board

Odroid HC1 board has built-in JMicron USB to SATA bridge, which supports
UAS protocol. Compile-in support for it (instead of enabling it as module)
to make sure that all built-in storage devices are available for rootfs.
The bridge itself also supports fallback to standard USB Mass Storage
protocol, but USB Mass Storage class doesn't bind to it when UAS is
compiled as module and modules are not (yet) available.
