sctp: use right member as the param of list_for_each_entry

Commit d04adf1b3551 ("sctp: reset owner sk for data chunks on out queues
when migrating a sock") made a mistake that using 'list' as the param of
list_for_each_entry to traverse the retransmit, sacked and abandoned
queues, while chunks are using 'transmitted_list' to link into these
queues.

It could cause NULL dereference panic if there are chunks in any of these
queues when peeling off one asoc.

So use the chunk member 'transmitted_list' instead in this patch.
