ACPI/IORT: Look up IORT node through struct fwnode_handle pointer

Current IORT code provides a function (ie iort_get_fwnode())
which looks up a struct fwnode_handle pointer through a
struct acpi_iort_node pointer for SMMU components but it
lacks a function that implements the reverse look-up, namely
struct fwnode_handle* -> struct acpi_iort_node*.

Devices that are not IORT named components cannot be retrieved through
their associated IORT named component scan interface because they just
are not represented in the ACPI namespace; the reverse look-up is
therefore required for all platform devices that represent IORT nodes
(eg SMMUs) so that the struct acpi_iort_node* can be retrieved from the
struct device->fwnode pointer.
