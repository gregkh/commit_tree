PCI: Add for_each_pci_bridge() helper

The following pattern is often used:

  list_for_each_entry(dev, &bus->devices, bus_list) {
    if (pci_is_bridge(dev)) {
      ...
    }
  }

Add a for_each_pci_bridge() helper to make that code easier to write and
read by reducing indentation level.  It also saves one or few lines of code
in each occurrence.

Convert PCI core parts here at the same time.
