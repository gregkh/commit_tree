fscrypt: new helper function - fscrypt_prepare_rename()

Introduce a helper function which prepares to rename a file into a
possibly encrypted directory.  It handles loading the encryption keys
for the source and target directories if needed, and it handles
enforcing that if the target directory (and the source directory for a
cross-rename) is encrypted, then the file being moved into the directory
has the same encryption policy as its containing directory.
