clk: hi3660: fix incorrect uart3 clock freqency

UART3 clock rate is doubled in previous commit.

This error is not detected until recently a mezzanine board which makes
real use of uart3 port (through LS connector of 96boards) was setup
and tested on hi3660-hikey960 board.

This patch changes clock source rate of clk_factor_uart3 to 100000000.
