dm table: fix regression from improper dm_dev_internal.count refcount_t conversion

Multiple refcounts are needed if the device was already added.  The
micro-optimization of setting the refcount to 1 on first added (rather
than fall thru to a common refcount_inc) lost sight of the fact that the
refcount_inc is also needed for the case when the device already exists
and the mode need not be upgraded.
