gianfar: Disable EEE autoneg by default

This controller does not support EEE, but it may connect to a PHY
which supports EEE and advertises EEE by default, while its link
partner also advertises EEE. If this happens, the PHY enters low
power mode when the traffic rate is low and causes packet loss.
This patch disables EEE advertisement by default for any PHY that
gianfar connects to, to prevent the above unwanted outcome.
