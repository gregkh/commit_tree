xfs: add a new xfs_iext_lookup_extent_before helper

This helper looks up the last extent the covers space before the passed
in block number.  This is useful for truncate and similar operations that
operate backwards over the extent list.  For xfs_bunmapi it also is
a slight optimization as we can return early if there are not extents
at or below the end of the to be truncated range.
