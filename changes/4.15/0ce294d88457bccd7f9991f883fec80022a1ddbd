tcp: correctly test congestion state in RACK

RACK does not test the loss recovery state correctly to compute
the reordering window. It assumes if lost_out is zero then TCP is
not in loss recovery. But it can be zero during recovery before
calling tcp_rack_detect_loss(): when an ACK acknowledges all
packets marked lost before receiving this ACK, but has not yet
to discover new ones by tcp_rack_detect_loss(). The fix is to
simply test the congestion state directly.
