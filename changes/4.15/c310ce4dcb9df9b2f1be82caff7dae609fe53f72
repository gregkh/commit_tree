timers: Avoid an unnecessary iteration in __run_timers()

If the base clock is behind jiffies in the soft irq expiry code then the
next timer is retrieved by get_next_timer_interrupt() to avoid incrementing
base clock one by one. If the next timer interrupt is past current jiffies
then the base clock is set to jiffies - 1. At the call site this is
incremented and another iteration through the expiry loop is executed which
checks empty hash buckets.

That's a pointless excercise because it's already known that the next timer
is past jiffies.

Set the base clock in that case to jiffies directly so it gets incremented
to jiffies + 1 at the call site resulting in immediate termination of the
expiry loop.
