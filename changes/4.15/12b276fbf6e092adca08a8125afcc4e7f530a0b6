cxgb4: add support to create hash filters

Add support to create hash (exact-match) filters based on the value
of 'hash' field in ch_filter_specification.

Allocate SMT/L2T entries if DMAC-rewrite/SMAC-rewrite is requested.

Allocate CLIP entry in case of IPv6 filter.

Use cpl_act_open_req[6] to send hash filter create request to hw.
Also, the filter tuple is calculated as part of sending this request.

Hash-filter reply is processed on getting cpl_act_open_rpl.
In case of success, various bits/fields in filter-tcb are set per
filter requirement, such as enabling filter hitcnts, and/or various
header rewrite operations, such as VLAN-rewrite, NAT or
(L3/L4)-rewrite, and SMAC/DMAC-rewrite. In case of failure, clear the
filter entry and release any hw resources occupied by it.

The patch also moves the functions set_tcb_field, set_tcb_tflag and
configure_filter_smac towards beginning of file.
