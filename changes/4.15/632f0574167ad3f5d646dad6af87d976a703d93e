powerpc/tm: Don't check for WARN in TM Bad Thing handling

Currently when we take a TM Bad Thing program check exception, we
search the bug table to see if the program check was generated by a
WARN/WARN_ON etc.

That makes no sense, the WARN macros use trap instructions, which
should never generate a TM Bad Thing exception. If they ever did that
would be a bug and we should oops.

We do have some hand-coded bugs in tm.S, using EMIT_BUG_ENTRY, but
those are all BUGs not WARNs, and they all use trap instructions
anyway. Almost certainly this check was incorrectly copied from the
REASON_TRAP handling in the same function.

Remove it.
