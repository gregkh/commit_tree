MIPS: cmpxchg64() and HAVE_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN don't work for 32-bit SMP

__cmpxchg64_local_generic() is atomic only w.r.t tasks and interrupts
on the same CPU (that's what the 'local' means).  We can't use it to
implement cmpxchg64() in SMP configurations.

So, for 32-bit SMP configurations:

- Don't define cmpxchg64()
- Don't enable HAVE_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN, which requires it
