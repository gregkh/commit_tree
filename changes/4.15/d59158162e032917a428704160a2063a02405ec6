tracing: Add support for preempt and irq enable/disable events

Preempt and irq trace events can be used for tracing the start and
end of an atomic section which can be used by a trace viewer like
systrace to graphically view the start and end of an atomic section and
correlate them with latencies and scheduling issues.

This also serves as a prelude to using synthetic events or probes to
rewrite the preempt and irqsoff tracers, along with numerous benefits of
using trace events features for these events.
