ALSA: hda - Fix missing COEF init for ALC225/295/299

There was a long-standing problem on HP Spectre X360 with Kabylake
where it lacks of the front speaker output in some situations.  Also
there are other products showing the similar behavior.  The culprit
seems to be the missing COEF setup on ALC codecs, ALC225/295/299,
which are all compatible.

This patch adds the proper COEF setup (to initialize idx 0x67 / bits
0x3000) for addressing the issue.
