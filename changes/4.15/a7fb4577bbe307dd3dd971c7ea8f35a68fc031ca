clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Fix DEFINE_PER_CPU expansion

Our ctags mangling script can't handle newlines inside of a
DEFINE_PER_CPU(), leading to an annoying message whenever tags are
built:

  ctags: Warning: drivers/clocksource/arm_arch_timer.c:302: null expansion of name pattern "\1"

This was dealt with elsewhere in commit:

  25528213fe9f75f4 ("tags: Fix DEFINE_PER_CPU expansions")

... by ensuring each DEFINE_PER_CPU() was contained on a single line,
even where this would violate the usual code style (checkpatch warnings
and all).

Let's do the same for the arch timer driver, and get rid of the
distraction.
