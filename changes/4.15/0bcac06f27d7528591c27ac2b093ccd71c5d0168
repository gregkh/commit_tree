mm, swap: skip swapcache for swapin of synchronous device

With fast swap storage, the platforms want to use swap more aggressively
and swap-in is crucial to application latency.

The rw_page() based synchronous devices like zram, pmem and btt are such
fast storage.  When I profile swapin performance with zram lz4
decompress test, S/W overhead is more than 70%.  Maybe, it would be
bigger in nvdimm.

This patch aims to reduce swap-in latency by skipping swapcache if the
swap device is synchronous device like rw_page based device.  It
enhances 45% my swapin test(5G sequential swapin, no readahead, from
2.41sec to 1.64sec).
