Revert "mm, thp: Do not make pmd/pud dirty without a reason"

This reverts commit 152e93af3cfe2d29d8136cc0a02a8612507136ee.

It was a nice cleanup in theory, but as Nicolai Stange points out, we do
need to make the page dirty for the copy-on-write case even when we
didn't end up making it writable, since the dirty bit is what we use to
check that we've gone through a COW cycle.
