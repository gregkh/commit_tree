mmc: block: Delete mmc_access_rpmb()

This function is used by the block layer queue to bail out of
requests if the current request is towards an RPMB
"block device".

This was done to avoid boot time scanning of this "block
device" which was never really a block device, thus duct-taping
over the fact that it was badly engineered.

This problem is now gone as we removed the offending RPMB block
device in another patch and replaced it with a character
device.
