drm/fb_helper: Disable all crtc's when initial setup fails.

Some drivers like i915 start with crtc's enabled, but with deferred
fbcon setup they were no longer disabled as part of fbdev setup.
Headless units could no longer enter pc3 state because the crtc was
still enabled.

Fix this by calling restore_fbdev_mode when we would have called
it otherwise once during initial fbdev setup.
