fs/mbcache.c: make count_objects() more robust

When running ltp stress test for 7*24 hours, vmscan occasionally emits
the following warning continuously:

  mb_cache_scan+0x0/0x3f0 negative objects to delete
  nr=-9232265467809300450
  ...

Tracing shows the freeable(mb_cache_count returns) is -1, which causes
the continuous accumulation and overflow of total_scan.

This patch makes sure that mb_cache_count() cannot return a negative
value, which makes the mbcache shrinker more robust.
