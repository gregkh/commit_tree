mtd: powernv_flash: Don't return -ERESTARTSYS on interrupted token acquisition

Because the MTD core might split up a read() or write() from userspace
into several calls to the driver, we may fail to get a token but already
have done some work, best to return -EINTR back to userspace and have
them decide what to do.
