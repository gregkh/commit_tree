xfs: scrub the shape of a metadata btree

Create a function that can check the shape of a btree -- each block
passes basic inspection and all the pointers look ok.  In the next patch
we'll add the ability to check the actual keys and records stored within
the btree.  Add some helper functions so that we report detailed scrub
errors in a uniform manner in dmesg.  These are helper functions for
subsequent patches.
