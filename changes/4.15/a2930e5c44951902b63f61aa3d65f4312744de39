IB/rdmavt: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly.

setup_timer() was already being called before the open-coded init_timer()
and .data assignment. These are removed as well.
