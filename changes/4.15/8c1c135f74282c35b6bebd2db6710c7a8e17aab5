staging: iio: tsl2x7x: changed #defines to be aligned on the same column

Some of the existing #defines have tabs between the name, and the value,
while others have spaces. The alignment of the values mostly has a
consistent layout, but there are some that don't. Change all of the
defines so that the name and value is separated by tabs and all of the
values start on the same column to increase code readability. This patch
also removes the unnecessary parentheses around the value of
TSL2X7X_MAX_TIMER_CNT.
