act_vlan: VLAN action rewrite to use RCU lock/unlock and update

Using a spinlock in the VLAN action causes performance issues when the VLAN
action is used on multiple cores. Rewrote the VLAN action to use RCU read
locking for reads and updates instead.
All functions now use an RCU dereferenced pointer to access the VLAN action
context. Modified helper functions used by other modules, to use the RCU as
opposed to directly accessing the structure.
