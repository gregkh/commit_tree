tracing, mei: Remove unused trace event mei_pci_cfg_write

Commit a96c548291 ("mei: trace pci configuration space io") added the
trace event mei_pci_cfg_write but never used it. As trace events that
are defined take up space for data structures and functions created for
them, it is a waste of memory to have one defined but not used. Remove
this trace event.
