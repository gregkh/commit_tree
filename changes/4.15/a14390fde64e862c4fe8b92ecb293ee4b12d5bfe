perf script: Allow creating per-event dump files

Introduce a new option to dump trace output to files named by the
monitored events and update perf-script documentation accordingly.

Shown below is output of perf script command with the newly introduced
option.

         $ perf record -e cycles -e cs -ag -- sleep 1
         $ perf script --per-event-dump
         $ ls
         perf.data.cycles.dump perf.data.cs.dump

Without per-event-dump support, drawing flamegraphs for different events
would require post processing to separate events. You can monitor only
one event at a time if you want to get flamegraphs for different events.
Using this option, you can get the trace output files named by the
monitored events, and could draw flamegraphs according to the event's
name.
