ARM: dts: Configure SmartReflex only to idle the interconnect target module

The TRM has marked dra7 SmartReflex as reserved and we should not
touch those registers as pointed out by Nishanth Menon <nm@ti.com>.
We do still want to idle the related interconnect target modules on
init though.

Let's do this by only configuring the generic interconnect target modules
and not add the child SmartReflex devices.
