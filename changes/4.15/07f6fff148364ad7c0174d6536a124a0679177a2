ovl: fix rmdir problem on non-merge dir with origin xattr

An "origin && non-merge" upper dir may have leftover whiteouts that
were created in past mount. overlayfs does no clear this dir when we
delete it, which may lead to rmdir fail or temp file left in workdir.

Simple reproducer:
  mkdir lower upper work merge
  mkdir -p lower/dir
  touch lower/dir/a
  mount -t overlay overlay -olowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper,\
    workdir=work merge
  rm merge/dir/a
  umount merge
  rm -rf lower/*
  touch lower/dir  (*)
  mount -t overlay overlay -olowerdir=lower,upperdir=upper,\
    workdir=work merge
  rm -rf merge/dir

Syslog dump:
  overlayfs: cleanup of 'work/#7' failed (-39)

(*): if we do not create the regular file, the result is different:
  rm: cannot remove "dir/": Directory not empty

This patch adds a check for the case of non-merge dir that may contain
whiteouts, and calls ovl_check_empty_dir() to check and clear whiteouts
from upper dir when an empty dir is being deleted.

[amir: split patch from ovl_check_empty_dir() cleanup
       rename ovl_is_origin() to ovl_may_have_whiteouts()
       check OVL_WHITEOUTS flag instead of checking origin xattr]
