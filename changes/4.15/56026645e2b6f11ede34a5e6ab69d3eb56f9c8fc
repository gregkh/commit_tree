cpufreq: governor: Ensure sufficiently large sampling intervals

After commit aa7519af450d (cpufreq: Use transition_delay_us for legacy
governors as well) the sampling_rate field of struct dbs_data may be
less than the tick period which causes dbs_update() to produce
incorrect results, so make the code ensure that the value of that
field will always be sufficiently large.
