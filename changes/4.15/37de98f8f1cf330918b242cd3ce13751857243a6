iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use CMD_SYNC completion MSI

As an IRQ, the CMD_SYNC interrupt is not particularly useful, not least
because we often need to wait for sync completion within someone else's
IRQ handler anyway. However, when the SMMU is both coherent and supports
MSIs, we can have a lot more fun by not using it as an interrupt at all.
Following the example suggested in the architecture and using a write
targeting normal memory, we can let callers wait on a status variable
outside the lock instead of having to stall the entire queue or even
touch MMIO registers. Since multiple sync commands are guaranteed to
complete in order, a simple incrementing sequence count is all we need
to unambiguously support any realistic number of overlapping waiters.
