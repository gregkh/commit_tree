net/sched: Add select_queue() class_ops for mqprio

When replacing a child qdisc from mqprio, tc_modify_qdisc() must fetch
the netdev_queue pointer that the current child qdisc is associated
with before creating the new qdisc.

Currently, when using mqprio as root qdisc, the kernel will end up
getting the queue #0 pointer from the mqprio (root qdisc), which leaves
any new child qdisc with a possibly wrong netdev_queue pointer.

Implementing the Qdisc_class_ops select_queue() on mqprio fixes this
issue and avoid an inconsistent state when child qdiscs are replaced.
