x86/fpu: Parse clearcpuid= as early XSAVE argument

With a followon patch we want to make clearcpuid affect the XSAVE
configuration. But xsave is currently initialized before arguments
are parsed. Move the clearcpuid= parsing into the special
early xsave argument parsing code.

Since clearcpuid= contains a = we need to keep the old __setup
around as a dummy, otherwise it would end up as a environment
variable in init's environment.
