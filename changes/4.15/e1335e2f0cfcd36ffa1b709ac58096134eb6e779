drm/tegra: sor: Reimplement pad clock

The current implementation of the pad clock isn't quite correct. This
has the side-effect of being incompatible with the implementation for
Tegra186 (provided by the BPMP) and therefore would require a massive
change to the driver to cope with the differences. Instead, simply do
what Tegra186 does and add some code to fallback to the old behaviour
for existing device trees.
