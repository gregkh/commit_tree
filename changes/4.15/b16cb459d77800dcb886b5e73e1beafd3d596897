ipv6: prepare rt6_clean_tohost() for exception table

If we move all cached dst into the exception table under the main route,
current rt6_clean_tohost() will no longer be able to access them.
This commit makes fib6_clean_tohost() to also go through all cached
routes in exception table and removes cached gateway routes to the
passed in gateway.
This is a preparation in order to move all cached routes into the
exception table.
