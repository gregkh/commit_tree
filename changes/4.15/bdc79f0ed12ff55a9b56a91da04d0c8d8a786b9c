target: fix PR state file path truncation

If an LIO backstore is configured with a sufficiently long Unit Serial
string, alongside a similarly long dbroot path, then a truncated
Persistent Reservation APTPL state file path will be used. This
truncation can unintentionally lead to two LUs with differing serial
numbers sharing PR state file.
