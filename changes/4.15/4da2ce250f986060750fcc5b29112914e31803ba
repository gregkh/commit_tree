mm: distinguish CMA and MOVABLE isolation in has_unmovable_pages()

Joonsoo has noticed that "mm: drop migrate type checks from
has_unmovable_pages" would break CMA allocator because it relies on
has_unmovable_pages returning false even for CMA pageblocks which in
fact don't have to be movable:

 alloc_contig_range
   start_isolate_page_range
     set_migratetype_isolate
       has_unmovable_pages

This is a result of the code sharing between CMA and memory hotplug
while each one has a different idea of what has_unmovable_pages should
return.  This is unfortunate but fixing it properly would require a lot
of code duplication.

Fix the issue by introducing the requested migrate type argument and
special case MIGRATE_CMA case where CMA page blocks are handled
properly.  This will work for memory hotplug because it requires
MIGRATE_MOVABLE.
