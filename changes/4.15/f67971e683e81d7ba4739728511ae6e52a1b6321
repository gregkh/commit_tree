tcp: tcp_fragment() should not assume rtx skbs

While stress testing MTU probing, we had crashes in list_del() that we root-caused
to the fact that tcp_fragment() is unconditionally inserting the freshly allocated
skb into tsorted_sent_queue list.

But this list is supposed to contain skbs that were sent.
This was mostly harmless until MTU probing was enabled.

Fortunately we can use the tcp_queue enum added later (but in same linux version)
for rtx-rb-tree to fix the bug.

Fixes: e2080072ed2d ("tcp: new list for sent but unacked skbs for RACK recovery")
