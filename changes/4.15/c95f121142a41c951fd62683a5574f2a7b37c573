m32r: fix endianness constraints

The m32r Kconfig provides both CPU_BIG_ENDIAN and CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
configuration options.  As they are user-selectable and independent,
this allows invalid configurations:

  - All m32r defconfigs build a big endian kernel, but CPU_BIG_ENDIAN is
    not set, causing compiler warnings like:

	include/linux/byteorder/big_endian.h:7:2: warning: #warning inconsistent configuration, needs CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN [-Wcpp]
	 #warning inconsistent configuration, needs CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
	  ^

  - Since commit 5bdfca6435b82944 ("m32r: define CPU_BIG_ENDIAN"),
    building an allmodconfig or allyesconfig enables both
    CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN and CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN.
    While this did get rid of the warning above, both options are
    obviously mutually exclusive.

Fix this by making only CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN configurable by the user, as
before, and by making sure exactly one of CPU_BIG_ENDIAN and
CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN is always enabled.
