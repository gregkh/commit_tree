mtd: spi-nor: cadence-quadspi: Add new binding to enable loop-back circuit

Cadence QSPI IP has a adapted loop-back circuit which can be enabled by
setting BYPASS field to 0 in READCAPTURE register. It enables use of
QSPI return clock to latch the data rather than the internal QSPI
reference clock. For high speed operations, adapted loop-back circuit
using QSPI return clock helps to increase data valid window.

Add DT parameter cdns,rclk-en to help enable adapted loop-back circuit
for boards which do have QSPI return clock provided. Update binding
documentation for the same.
