drm/i915/cnl: Introduce initial Cannonlake Workarounds.

Let's inherit workarounds from previous platforms that
according to wa_database and BSpec are still valid for
Cannonlake.

v2: Add missed workarounds.
v3: Rebase
v4: Remove bad chunk that was added to rc6 disable. (Ander)
    Also remove A0 W/a that are not needed anymore.
v5: Rebase on top of CFL.
v6: Remove empty gen9_init_perctx_bb and gen9_init_indirectctx_bb
    since they don't carry any gen10 related W/a. (by Oscar).
    Also Remove A0 exclusive workaround.
v7: Remove more A0 exclusive workarounds. As pointed out by Oscar
    many workarounds were changed to be A0 only so let's remove
    them.
