drm/nouveau/imem/nv50: embed nvkm_instobj directly into nv04_instobj

This is not as simple as it was for earlier GPUs, due to the need to swap
accessor functions depending on whether BAR2 is usable or not.

We were previously protected by nvkm_instobj's accessor functions keeping
an object mapped permanently, with some unclear magic that managed to hit
the slow-path where needed even if an object was marked as mapped.

That's been replaced here by reference counting maps (some objects, like
page tables can be accessed concurrently), and swapping the functions as
necessary.
