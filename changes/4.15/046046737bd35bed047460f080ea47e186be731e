phy: tegra: fix device-tree node lookups

Fix child-node lookups during probe, which ended up searching the whole
device tree depth-first starting at the parents rather than just
matching on their children.

To make things worse, some parent nodes could end up being being
prematurely freed (by tegra_xusb_pad_register()) as
of_find_node_by_name() drops a reference to its first argument.
