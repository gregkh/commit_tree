HID: add backlight level quirk for Asus ROG laptops

On laptops such as Asus GL553VD, setting keyboard backlight levels
does not work. This change enables F3/F4 keys to set backlight levels
(from 0 to 3, total 4 levels) on such laptops.

It is intended only to the following device: 0x0b05 1854:

	P: Vendor=0b05 ProdID=1854 Rev=03.02
	S: Manufacturer=ITE Tech. Inc.
	S: Product=ITE Device(8910)
