iio: adc: mcp320x: Speed up readout of single-channel ADCs

Single-channel converters such as mcp3001, mcp3201, mcp3301 and the
upcoming mcp3550/1/3 lack a MOSI pin, so there's no need to call
mcp320x_channel_to_tx_data() for them.

Moreover, instead of calling spi_read() for these converters, which
generates an spi_message and spi_transfer on the stack on every readout,
it's more efficient to use the spi_message and spi_transfer[] included
in struct mcp320x (as we do for multi-channel ADCs), but initialize the
spi_message only with the receive transfer.
