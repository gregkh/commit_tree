drm/amd/display: Fix rehook MST display not light back on

Original applied dm_restore_drm_connector_state() has got removed.
Set link status to BAD before hotplug() event could trigger
another modeset from userspace.

The fix "Fix MST daisy chain SST not light up" commit makes so it is trying
to create a stream prior to dc_sink. That makes dc_sink is not present in
create_stream_for_sink().
