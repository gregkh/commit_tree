drm/pl111: Insert delay before powering up PL11x

The old codebase has a delay between enabling and powering up the
PL11x.

According to the manual for PL110, ARM DDI 0161E page 1-5 and
the PL111 manual ARM DDI 0293C page 1-6, the power sequence should
be such that once Vdd is stable (which we assume it is at boot)
LCDEN is enabled first and then CLPOWER should be enabled
"after the signals have stabilized" and this is said to
be display-dependent. The old codebase uses 20ms.
