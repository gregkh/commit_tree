timers: Reinitialize per cpu bases on hotplug

The timer wheel bases are not (re)initialized on CPU hotplug. That leaves
them with a potentially stale clk and next_expiry valuem, which can cause
trouble then the CPU is plugged.

Add a prepare callback which forwards the clock, sets next_expiry to far in
the future and reset the control flags to a known state.

Set base->must_forward_clk so the first timer which is queued will try to
forward the clock to current jiffies.
