of: reserved_mem: Accessor for acquiring reserved_mem

In some cases drivers referencing a reserved-memory region might want to
remap the entire region, but when defining the reserved-memory by "size"
the client driver has no means to know the associated base address of
the reserved memory region.

This patch adds an accessor for such drivers to acquire a handle to
their associated reserved-memory for this purpose.

A complicating factor for the implementation is that the reserved_mem
objects are created from the flattened DeviceTree, as such we can't
use the device_node address for comparison. Fortunately the name of the
node will be used as "name" of the reserved_mem and will be used when
building the full_name, so we can compare the "name" with the basename
of the full_name to find the match.
