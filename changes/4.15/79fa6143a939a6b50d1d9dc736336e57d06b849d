xfs: refactor xfs_bmap_add_extent_unwritten_real

Use xfs_iext_get_extent to find, and xfs_iext_update_extent to update
entries in the in-core extent list.  This isolates the function from
the detailed layout of the extent list, and generally makes the code
a lot more readable.

Also get rid of the oldext and newext variables as using the extent
records is a lot more descriptive.
