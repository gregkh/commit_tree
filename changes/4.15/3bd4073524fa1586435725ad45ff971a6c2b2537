drm/i915: Consolidate get_fence with pin_fence

Following the pattern now used for obj->mm.pages, use just pin_fence and
unpin_fence to control access to the fence registers. I.e. instead of
calling get_fence(); pin_fence(), we now just need to call pin_fence().
This will make it easier to reduce the locking requirements around
fence registers.
