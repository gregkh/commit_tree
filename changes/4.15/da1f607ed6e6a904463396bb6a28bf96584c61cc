platform/x86: dell-smbios-smm: test for WSMT

WSMT is as an attestation to the OS that the platform won't
modify memory outside of pre-defined areas.

If a platform has WSMT enabled in BIOS setup, SMM calls through
dcdbas will fail.  The only way to access platform data in these
instances is through the WMI SMBIOS calling interface.
