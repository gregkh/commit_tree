qed: Add iWARP enablement support

This patch is the last of the initial iWARP patch series. It
adds the possiblity to actually detect iWARP from the device and enable
it in the critical locations which basically make iWARP available.

It wasn't submitted until now as iWARP hadn't been accepted into
the rdma tree.
