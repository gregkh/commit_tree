mac80211_hwsim: validate number of different channels

When creating a new radio on the fly, hwsim allows this
to be done with an arbitrary number of channels, but
cfg80211 only supports a limited number of simultaneous
channels, leading to a warning.

Fix this by validating the number - this requires moving
the define for the maximum out to a visible header file.
