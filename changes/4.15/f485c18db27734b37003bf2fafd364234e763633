scsi: lpfc: Move CQ processing to a soft IRQ

Under heavy target nvme load duration, the lpfc irq handler is
encountering cpu lockup warnings.

Convert the driver to a shortened ISR handler which identifies the
interrupting condition then schedules a workq thread to process the
completion queue the interrupt was for. This moves all the real work
into the workq element.

As nvmet_fc upcalls are no longer in ISR context, don't set the feature
flags
