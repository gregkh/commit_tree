ARM: dts: integratorap: Fix PCI windows

This fixes up several errors and additions in the
PCIv3 ranges:
- The I/O space is 64KB and translates from 61000000 to
  00000000.
- The non-prefetched and prefected memories are 1:1 mapped
  according to ARM DUI 0098A page 5-9 and should be like
  that in the device tree as well.
- We also add the DMA ranges, in the manual these are
  described as "PCI to local bus windows" on page 5-12 ff.
- Set the bus range to 0x00-0xff.
