mm: fix nodemask printing

The cleanup caused build warnings for constant mask pointers:

  mm/mempolicy.c: In function `mpol_to_str':
  ./include/linux/nodemask.h:108:11: warning: the comparison will always evaluate as `true' for the address of `nodes' will never be NULL [-Waddress]

An earlier workaround I suggested was incorporated in the version that
got merged, but that only solved the problem for gcc-7 and higher, while
gcc-4.6 through gcc-6.x still warn.

This changes the printing again to use inline functions that make it
clear to the compiler that the line that does the NULL check has no idea
whether the argument is a constant NULL.
