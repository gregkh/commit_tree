ARM: dts: exynos: add exynos5422 cpu capacity-dmips-mhz information

The following 'capacity-dmips-mhz' dt property values are used:

Cortex-A15: 1024, Cortex-A7: 539

They have been derived form the cpu_efficiency values:

Cortex-A15: 3891, Cortex-A7: 2048

by scaling them so that the Cortex-A15s (big cores) use 1024.

The cpu_efficiency values were originally derived from the "Big.LITTLE
Processing with ARM Cortexâ„¢-A15 & Cortex-A7" white paper
(http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rdm34/big.LITTLE.pdf). Table 1 lists 1.9x
(3891/2048) as the Cortex-A15 vs Cortex-A7 performance ratio for the
Dhrystone benchmark.

The following platforms are affected once cpu-invariant accounting
support is re-connected to the task scheduler:

odroidxu3, odroidxu3-lite, odroidxu4
