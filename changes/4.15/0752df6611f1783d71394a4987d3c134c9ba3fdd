gpio: brcmstb: allow all instances to be wakeup sources

This commit allows a wakeup parent interrupt to be shared between
instances.

It also removes the redundant can_wake member of the private data
structure by using whether the parent_wake_irq has been defined to
indicate that the GPIO device can wake.
