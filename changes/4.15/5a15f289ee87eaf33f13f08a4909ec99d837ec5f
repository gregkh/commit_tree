ALSA: usb-audio: Fix the missing ctl name suffix at parsing SU

The commit 89b89d121ffc ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add check return value for
usb_string()") added the check of the return value from
snd_usb_copy_string_desc(), which is correct per se, but it introduced
a regression.  In the original code, either the "Clock Source",
"Playback Source" or "Capture Source" suffix is added after the
terminal string, while the commit changed it to add the suffix only
when get_term_name() is failing.  It ended up with an incorrect ctl
name like "PCM" instead of "PCM Capture Source".

Also, even the original code has a similar bug: when the ctl name is
generated from snd_usb_copy_string_desc() for the given iSelector, it
also doesn't put the suffix.

This patch addresses these issues: the suffix is added always when no
static mapping is found.  Also the patch tries to put more comments
and cleans up the if/else block for better readability in order to
avoid the same pitfall again.
