drm/bridge: Fix lvds-encoder since the panel_bridge rework.

The panel_bridge bridge attaches to the panel's OF node, not the
lvds-encoder's node.  Put in a little no-op bridge of our own so that
our consumers can still find a bridge where they expect.

This also fixes an unintended unregistration and leak of the
panel-bridge on module remove.
