ALSA: seq: Add sanity check for user-space pointer delivery

The sequencer event may contain a user-space pointer with its
SNDRV_SEQ_EXT_USRPTR bit, and we assure that its delivery is limited
with non-atomic mode.  Otherwise the copy_from_user() may hit the
fault and cause a problem.  Although the core code doesn't set such a
flag (only set at snd_seq_write()), any wild driver may set it
mistakenly and lead to an unexpected crash.

This patch adds a sanity check of such events at the delivery core
code to filter out the invalid invocation in the atomic mode.
