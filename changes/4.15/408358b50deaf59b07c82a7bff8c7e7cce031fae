s390: vfio-ccw: Do not attempt to free no-op, test and tic cda.

Because we do not make use of the cda (channel data address) for test,
no-op ccws no address translation takes place. This means cda could
contain a guest address which we do not want to attempt to free. Let's
check the command type and skip cda free when it is not needed.

For a TIC ccw, ccw->cda points to either a ccw in an existing chain or
it points to a whole new allocated chain. In either case the data will
be freed when the owning chain is freed.
