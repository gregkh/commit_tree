gpio: brcmstb: switch to handle_level_irq flow

Reading and writing the gpio bank status register each time a pending
interrupt bit is serviced could cause new pending bits to be cleared
without servicing the associated interrupts.

By using the handle_level_irq flow instead of the handle_simple_irq
flow we get proper handling of interrupt masking as well as acking
of interrupts.  The irq_ack method is added to support this.
