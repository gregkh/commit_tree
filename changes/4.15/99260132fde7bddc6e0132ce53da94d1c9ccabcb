IB/core: Fix calculation of maximum RoCE MTU

The original code only took into consideration the largest header
possible after the IB_BTH_BYTES.  This was incorrect, as the largest
possible header size is the largest possible combination of headers we
might run into.  The new code accounts for all possible headers in the
largest possible combination and subtracts that from the MTU to make
sure that all packets will fit on the wire.
