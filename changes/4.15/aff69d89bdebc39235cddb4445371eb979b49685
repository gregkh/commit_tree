md/raid5: correct degraded calculation in raid5_error

When disk failure occurs on new disks for reshape, mddev->degraded
is not calculated correctly. Faulty bit of the failure device is not
set before raid5_calc_degraded(conf).

mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/loop[012]
mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/loop3
mdadm /dev/md0 --grow -n4
mdadm /dev/md0 -f /dev/loop3 # simulating disk failure

cat /sys/block/md0/md/degraded # it outputs 0, but it should be 1.

However, mdadm -D /dev/md0 will show that it is degraded. It's a bug.
It can be fixed by moving the resources raid5_calc_degraded() depends
on before it.
