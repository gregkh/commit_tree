s390/ccwgroup: tie a ccwgroup driver to its ccw driver

When grouping devices, the ccwgroup core only checks whether all of the
devices are bound to the same ccw_driver. It has no means of checking
if the requesting ccwgroup driver actually supports this device type.
qeth implements its own device matching in qeth_core_probe_device(),
while ctcm and lcs currently have no sanity-checking at all.

Enable ccwgroup drivers to optionally defer the device type checking to
the ccwgroup core, by specifying their supported ccw_driver.
This allows us drop the device type matching from qeth, and improves
the robustness of ctcm and lcs.
