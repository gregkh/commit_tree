nvme-rdma: don't complete requests before a send work request has completed

In order to guarantee that the HCA will never get an access violation
(either from invalidated rkey or from iommu) when retrying a send
operation we must complete a request only when both send completion and
the nvme cqe has arrived. We need to set the send/recv completions flags
atomically because we might have more than a single context accessing the
request concurrently (one is cq irq-poll context and the other is
user-polling used in IOCB_HIPRI).

Only then we are safe to invalidate the rkey (if needed), unmap the host
buffers, and complete the IO.
