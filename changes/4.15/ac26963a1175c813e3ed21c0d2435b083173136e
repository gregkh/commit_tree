percpu: Introduce DEFINE_PER_CPU_DECRYPTED

KVM guest defines three per-CPU variables (steal-time, apf_reason, and
kvm_pic_eoi) which are shared between a guest and a hypervisor.

When SEV is active, memory is encrypted with a guest-specific key, and if
the guest OS wants to share the memory region with the hypervisor then it
must clear the C-bit (i.e set decrypted) before sharing it.

DEFINE_PER_CPU_DECRYPTED can be used to define the per-CPU variables
which will be shared between a guest and a hypervisor.
