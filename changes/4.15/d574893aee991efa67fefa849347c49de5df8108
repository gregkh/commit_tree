iommu/ipmmu-vmsa: Write IMCTR twice

Write IMCTR both in the root device and the leaf node.

To allow access of IMCTR introduce the following function:
 - ipmmu_ctx_write_all()

While at it also rename context functions:
 - ipmmu_ctx_read() -> ipmmu_ctx_read_root()
 - ipmmu_ctx_write() -> ipmmu_ctx_write_root()
