usb: host: isp1362-hcd: remove a couple of redundant assignments

Variable index is being initialized and the value is never read,
it is being updated a few statements later, so remove the redundant
initialization.  Variable total is being updated but the value is
never read, so this is also redundant and can be removed. Cleans
up two clang warnings:

drivers/usb/host/isp1362-hcd.c:715:6: warning: Value stored to
'index' during its initialization is never read
drivers/usb/host/isp1362-hcd.c:2254:2: warning: Value stored to
'total' is never read
