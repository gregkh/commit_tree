rcu: Suppress RCU CPU stall warnings while dumping trace

Currently, RCU emits Suppress RCU CPU stall warnings during its
automatically initiated ftrace_dump() calls after detecting an error
condition, which can result in excessively excessive console output
and lost trace events.  This commit therefore suppresses RCU CPU stall
warnings across any of these ftrace_dump() calls.
