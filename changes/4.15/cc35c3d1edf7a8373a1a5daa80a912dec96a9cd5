sctp: do not retransmit upon FragNeeded if PMTU discovery is disabled

Currently, if PMTU discovery is disabled on a given transport, but the
configured value is higher than the actual PMTU, it is likely that we
will get some icmp Frag Needed. The issue is, if PMTU discovery is
disabled, we won't update the information and will issue a
retransmission immediately, which may very well trigger another ICMP,
and another retransmission, leading to a loop.

The fix is to simply not trigger immediate retransmissions if PMTU
discovery is disabled on the given transport.
