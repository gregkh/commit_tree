Btrfs: bail out gracefully rather than BUG_ON

If a file's DIR_ITEM key is invalid (due to memory errors) and gets
written to disk, a future lookup_path can end up with kernel panic due
to BUG_ON().

This gets rid of the BUG_ON(), meanwhile output the corrupted key and
return ENOENT if it's invalid.
