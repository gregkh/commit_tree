crypto: pcrypt - fix freeing pcrypt instances

pcrypt is using the old way of freeing instances, where the ->free()
method specified in the 'struct crypto_template' is passed a pointer to
the 'struct crypto_instance'.  But the crypto_instance is being
kfree()'d directly, which is incorrect because the memory was actually
allocated as an aead_instance, which contains the crypto_instance at a
nonzero offset.  Thus, the wrong pointer was being kfree()'d.

Fix it by switching to the new way to free aead_instance's where the
->free() method is specified in the aead_instance itself.
