RDMA/hns: Modify assignment device variable to support both PCI device and platform device

In order to support the scalability of the hardware version, the
features irrelevant to the hardware will be located in the hns-roce.ko,
and the hardware relevant operations will be located in hns_roce_hw_v1.ko
or hns_roce_hw_v2.ko based on the series chips.

The hip08 RoCE engine is a PCI device, hip06 RoCE engine is a platform
device. In order to support both platform device and PCI device, We
replace &hr_dev->pdev->dev with hr_dev->dev in hns-roce.ko as belows:
	Before modification:
		struct device *dev = hr_dev->dev;
	After modification:
		struct device *dev = &hr_dev->pdev->dev;

	The related structure:
	struct hns_roce_dev {
		...
		struct platform_device  *pdev;
		struct pci_dev		*pci_dev;
		struct device		*dev;
		...
	}
