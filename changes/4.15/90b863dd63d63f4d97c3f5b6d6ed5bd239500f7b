hwmon: (sht15) remove redundant check on status and send of status value

A previous commit removed bit or'ing into to the integer status
so now status is now always zero. This means that the non-zero check on
status and the sht15_send_status call will never occur; it is deadcode.
Clean this up by removing the dead code.
