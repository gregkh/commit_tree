drm/amdkfd: Don't dereference kfd_process.mm

The kfd_process doesn't own a reference to the mm_struct, so it can
disappear without warning even while the kfd_process still exists.

Therefore, avoid dereferencing the kfd_process.mm pointer and make
it opaque. Use get_task_mm to get a temporary reference to the mm
when it's needed.

v2: removed unnecessary WARN_ON
