arm64: Define cputype macros for Falkor CPU

Add cputype definition macros for Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies
Falkor CPU in cputype.h. It's unfortunate that the first revision
of the Falkor CPU used the wrong part number 0x800, got fixed in v2
chip with part number 0xC00, and would be used the same value for
future revisions.
