md: always set THREAD_WAKEUP and wake up wqueue if thread existed

Since commit 4ad23a976413 ("MD: use per-cpu counter for writes_pending"),
the wait_queue is only got invoked if THREAD_WAKEUP is not set previously.

With above change, I can see process_metadata_update could always hang on
the wait queue, because mddev->thread could stay on 'D' status and the
THREAD_WAKEUP flag is not cleared since there are lots of place to wake up
mddev->thread. Then deadlock happened as follows:

linux175:~ # ps aux|grep md|grep D
root    20117   0.0 0.0         0   0 ? D   03:45   0:00 [md0_raid1]
root    20125   0.0 0.0         0   0 ? D   03:45   0:00 [md0_cluster_rec]
linux175:~ # cat /proc/20117/stack

[<ffffffffa04d2252>] md_thread+0x122/0x150 [md_mod]
[<ffffffff81091741>] kthread+0x101/0x140

So let's revert the part of code in the commit to resovle the problem since
we can't get lots of benefits of previous change.
