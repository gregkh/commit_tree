media: staging: atomisp: use clock framework for camera clocks

The Atom ISP driver initializes and configures PMC clocks which are
already handled by the clock framework.

Remove all legacy vlv2_platform_clock stuff and move to the clk API to
avoid conflicts, e.g. with audio machine drivers enabling the MCLK for
external codecs
