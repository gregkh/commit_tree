quota: propagate error from __dquot_initialize

In commit 6184fc0b8dd7 ("quota: Propagate error from ->acquire_dquot()"),
we have propagated error from __dquot_initialize to caller, but we forgot
to handle such error in add_dquot_ref(), so, currently, during quota
accounting information initialization flow, if we failed for some of
inodes, we just ignore such error, and do account for others, which is
not a good implementation.

In this patch, we choose to let user be aware of such error, so after
turning on quota successfully, we can make sure all inodes disk usage
can be accounted, which will be more reasonable.
