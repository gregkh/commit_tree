IB/hfi1: Reduce 8051 command timeout

Timeout of 20 seconds is too long for active wait performed
for 8051 command completion. It was required for scenarios
when transition to polling was requested before offline.quiet
state was reached. Currently wait for offline.quiet is
properly implemented and timeout can be reduced to 1 second.
