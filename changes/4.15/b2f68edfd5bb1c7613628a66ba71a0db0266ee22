gpio: Add driver for Maxim MAX3191x industrial serializer

The driver was developed for and tested with the MAX31913 built into
the Revolution Pi by KUNBUS, but should work with all members of the
MAX3191x family:

MAX31910: low power
MAX31911: LED drivers
MAX31912: LED drivers + 2nd voltage monitor + low power
MAX31913: LED drivers + 2nd voltage monitor
MAX31953: LED drivers + 2nd voltage monitor + isolation
MAX31963: LED drivers + 2nd voltage monitor + isolation + buck regulator
