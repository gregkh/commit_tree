mmc: block: Fix bug when removing RPMB chardev

I forgot to account for the fact that the device core holds a
reference to a device added with device_initialize() that need
to be released with a corresponding put_device() to reach a 0
refcount at the end of the lifecycle.

This led to a NULL pointer reference when freeing the device
when e.g. unbidning the host device in sysfs.

Fix this and use the device .release() callback to free the
IDA and free:ing the memory used by the RPMB device.
