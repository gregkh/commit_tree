ext4: prevent data corruption with journaling + DAX

The current code has the potential for data corruption when changing an
inode's journaling mode, as that can result in a subsequent unsafe change
in S_DAX.

I've captured an instance of this data corruption in the following fstest:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9948377/

Prevent this data corruption from happening by disallowing changes to the
journaling mode if the '-o dax' mount option was used.  This means that for
a given filesystem we could have a mix of inodes using either DAX or
data journaling, but whatever state the inodes are in will be held for the
duration of the mount.
