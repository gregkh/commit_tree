net/mlx5e: Don't override netdev features field unless in error flow

Set features function sets dev->features in order to keep track of which
features were successfully changed and which weren't (in case the user
asks for more than one change in a single command).

This breaks the logic in __netdev_update_features which assumes that
dev->features is not changed on success and checks for diffs between
features and dev->features (diffs that might not exist at this point
because of the driver override).

The solution is to keep track of successful/failed feature changes and
assign them to dev->features in case of failure only.
