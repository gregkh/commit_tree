dev: advertise the new nsid when the netns iface changes

x-netns interfaces are bound to two netns: the link netns and the upper
netns. Usually, this kind of interfaces is created in the link netns and
then moved to the upper netns. At the end, the interface is visible only
in the upper netns. The link nsid is advertised via netlink in the upper
netns, thus the user always knows where is the link part.

There is no such mechanism in the link netns. When the interface is moved
to another netns, the user cannot "follow" it.
This patch adds a new netlink attribute which helps to follow an interface
which moves to another netns. When the interface is unregistered, the new
nsid is advertised. If the interface is a x-netns interface (ie
rtnl_link_ops->get_link_net is defined), the nsid is allocated if needed.
