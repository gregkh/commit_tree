x86/vsyscall/64: Explicitly set _PAGE_USER in the pagetable hierarchy

The kernel is very erratic as to which pagetables have _PAGE_USER set.  The
vsyscall page gets lucky: it seems that all of the relevant pagetables are
among the apparently arbitrary ones that set _PAGE_USER.  Rather than
relying on chance, just explicitly set _PAGE_USER.

This will let us clean up pagetable setup to stop setting _PAGE_USER.  The
added code can also be reused by pagetable isolation to manage the
_PAGE_USER bit in the usermode tables.
