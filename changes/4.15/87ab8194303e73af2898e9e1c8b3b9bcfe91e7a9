bpf: add test case for ld_abs and helper changing pkt data

Add a test that i) uses LD_ABS, ii) zeroing R6 before call, iii) calls
a helper that triggers reload of cached skb data, iv) uses LD_ABS again.
It's added for test_bpf in order to do runtime testing after JITing as
well as test_verifier to test that the sequence is allowed.
