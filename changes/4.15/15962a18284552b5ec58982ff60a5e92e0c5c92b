cxgb4: Fix FW flash errors

commit 96ac18f14a5a ("cxgb4: Add support for new flash parts")
removed initialization of adapter->params.sf_fw_start causing issues
while flashing firmware to card. We no longer need sf_fw_start
in adapter->params as we already have macros defined for FW flash
addresses.
