usb: gadget: allow to enable legacy drivers without USB_ETH

Considerable time ago the legacy gadget menu was added inside the
USB_ETH choice. I think this was a mistake and that the legacy
gadget menu should have been added after "endchoice" instead of
before. Hence this patch.

Fixes: commit 8443f2d2b778 ("usb: gadget: Gadget directory cleanup - group legacy gadgets")
