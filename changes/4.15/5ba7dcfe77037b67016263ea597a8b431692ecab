batman-adv: Fix lock for ogm cnt access in batadv_iv_ogm_calc_tq

The originator node object orig_neigh_node is used to when accessing the
bcast_own(_sum) and real_packet_count information. The access to them has
to be protected with the spinlock in orig_neigh_node.

But the function uses the lock in orig_node instead. This is incorrect
because they could be two different originator node objects.
