KVM: arm/arm64: GICv4: Add init/teardown of the per-VM vPE irq domain

In order to control the GICv4 view of virtual CPUs, we rely
on an irqdomain allocated for that purpose. Let's add a couple
of helpers to that effect.

At the same time, the vgic data structures gain new fields to
track all this... erm... wonderful stuff.

The way we hook into the vgic init is slightly convoluted. We
need the vgic to be initialized (in order to guarantee that
the number of vcpus is now fixed), and we must have a vITS
(otherwise this is all very pointless). So we end-up calling
the init from both vgic_init and vgic_its_create.
