scsi: mpt3sas: Fix IO error occurs on pulling out a drive from RAID1 volume created on two SATA drive

Whenever an I/O for a RAID volume fails with IOCStatus
MPI2_IOCSTATUS_SCSI_IOC_TERMINATED and SCSIStatus equal to
(MPI2_SCSI_STATE_TERMINATED | MPI2_SCSI_STATE_NO_SCSI_STATUS) then
return the I/O to SCSI midlayer with "DID_RESET" (i.e. retry the IO
infinite times) set in the host byte.

Previously, the driver was completing the I/O with "DID_SOFT_ERROR"
which causes the I/O to be quickly retried. However, firmware needed
more time and hence I/Os were failing.
