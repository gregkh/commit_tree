act_sample: get rid of tcf_sample_cleanup_rcu()

Similar to commit d7fb60b9cafb ("net_sched: get rid of tcfa_rcu"),
TC actions don't need to respect RCU grace period, because it
is either just detached from tc filter (standalone case) or
it is removed together with tc filter (bound case) in which case
RCU grace period is already respected at filter layer.
