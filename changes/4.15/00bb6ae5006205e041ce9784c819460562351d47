KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't call real-mode XICS hypercall handlers if not enabled

When running a guest on a POWER9 system with the in-kernel XICS
emulation disabled (for example by running QEMU with the parameter
"-machine pseries,kernel_irqchip=off"), the kernel does not pass
the XICS-related hypercalls such as H_CPPR up to userspace for
emulation there as it should.

The reason for this is that the real-mode handlers for these
hypercalls don't check whether a XICS device has been instantiated
before calling the xics-on-xive code.  That code doesn't check
either, leading to potential NULL pointer dereferences because
vcpu->arch.xive_vcpu is NULL.  Those dereferences won't cause an
exception in real mode but will lead to kernel memory corruption.

This fixes it by adding kvmppc_xics_enabled() checks before calling
the XICS functions.
