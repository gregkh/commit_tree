macvlan: Fix one possible double free

Because the macvlan_uninit would free the macvlan port, so there is one
double free case in macvlan_common_newlink. When the macvlan port is just
created, then register_netdevice or netdev_upper_dev_link failed and they
would invoke macvlan_uninit. Then it would reach the macvlan_port_destroy
which triggers the double free.
