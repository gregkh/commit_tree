drm/amdgpu: Potential uninitialized variable in amdgpu_vm_update_directories()

After commit ea09729c9302 ("drm/amdgpu: rework page directory filling
v2") then it becomes a lot harder to verify that "r" is initialized.  My
static checker complains and so I've reviewed the code.  It does look
like it might be buggy... Anyway, it doesn't hurt to set "r" to zero
at the start.
