m68k: allow ColdFire m5441x parts to run with MMU enabled

The Freescale ColdFire M5441x system-on-chip parts have full paged MMU
hardware support. So far though we have only allowed them to be
configured for use in non-MMU mode.

All required kernel changes to support operation of the M5441x parts
with MMU enabled have been pushed into the kernel, so now we can allow
it to be configured and used with the MMU enabled.
