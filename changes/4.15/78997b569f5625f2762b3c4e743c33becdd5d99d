f2fs: split discard policy

There are many different scenarios such as fstrim, umount, urgent or
background where we will issue discards, actually, they need use
different policy in aspect of io aware, discard granularity, delay
interval and so on. But now they just share one common discard policy,
so there will be race when changing policy in between these scenarios,
the interference of changing discard policy will be very serious.

This patch changes to split discard policy for different scenarios.
