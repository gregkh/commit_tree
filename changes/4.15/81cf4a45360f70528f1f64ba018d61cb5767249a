USB: core: Add type-specific length check of BOS descriptors

As most of BOS descriptors are longer in length than their header
'struct usb_dev_cap_header', comparing solely with it is not sufficient
to avoid out-of-bounds access to BOS descriptors.

This patch adds descriptor type specific length check in
usb_get_bos_descriptor() to fix the issue.
