md: remove special meaning of ->quiesce(.., 2)

The '2' argument means "wake up anything that is waiting".
This is an inelegant part of the design and was added
to help support management of suspend_lo/suspend_hi setting.
Now that suspend_lo/hi is managed in mddev_suspend/resume,
that need is gone.
These is still a couple of places where we call 'quiesce'
with an argument of '2', but they can safely be changed to
call ->quiesce(.., 1); ->quiesce(.., 0) which
achieve the same result at the small cost of pausing IO
briefly.

This removes a small "optimization" from suspend_{hi,lo}_store,
but it isn't clear that optimization served a useful purpose.
The code now is a lot clearer.
