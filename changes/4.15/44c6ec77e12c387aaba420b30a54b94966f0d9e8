nvme-fc: change ctlr state assignments during reset/reconnect

Clean up some of the controller state checks and add the
RESETTING->RECONNECTING state transition.

Specifically:
- the movement of the RESETTING state change and schedule of reset_work
  to core doesn't work wiht nvme_fc_error_recovery setting state to
  RECONNECTING before attempting to reset.  Remove the state change as
  the reset request does it.
- In the rare cases where an error occurs right as we're transitioning
  to LIVE, defer the controller start actions.
- In error handling on teardown of associations while performing initial
  controller creation - avoid quiesce calls on the admin_q.  They are
  unneeded.
- Add the RESETTING->RECONNECTING transition in the reset handler.
