btrfs: Remove redundant argument of __link_block_group

__link_block_group is called from only 2 places and at each call site the
space_info being passed is the same as the space info assigned to the passed
cache struct. Let's remove the redundant argument and make the function
reference the space_info from the passed block_group_cache. No functional
changes
