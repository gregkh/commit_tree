drm/vc4: Add the DRM_IOCTL_VC4_GEM_MADVISE ioctl

This ioctl will allow us to purge inactive userspace buffers when the
system is running out of contiguous memory.

For now, the purge logic is rather dumb in that it does not try to
release only the amount of BO needed to meet the last CMA alloc request
but instead purges all objects placed in the purgeable pool as soon as
we experience a CMA allocation failure.

Note that the in-kernel BO cache is always purged before the purgeable
cache because those objects are known to be unused while objects marked
as purgeable by a userspace application/library might have to be
restored when they are marked back as unpurgeable, which can be
expensive.
