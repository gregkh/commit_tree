mac80211: recalculate some sta parameters after insertion

Sometimes a station is added already in ASSOC state. For example,
in AP mode, when a client station didn't get assoc resp and sends
an assoc req again. If a station is inserted when its state is ASSOC
or higher, the min chandef and allow_p2p_go_ps should be recalculated
again after the insertion.

Before this patch the recalculation happened only in sta_info_move_state
which occurs before the insertion of the sta and thus even though
it calls ieee80211_recalc_min_chandef/_p2p_go_ps_allowed functions,
since sdata->local->sta_list is still empty at this point, it doesn't do
anything.
