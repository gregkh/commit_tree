drm/i915: introduce vm set_pages/clear_pages

Move the setting/clearing of the vma->pages to a vm operation. Doing so
neatens things up a little, but more importantly gives us a sane place
to also set/clear the vma->pages_sizes, which we introduce later in
preparation for supporting huge-pages.

v2: remove redundant vma->pages check

v3: GEM_BUG_ON(vma->pages) following i915_vma_remove
