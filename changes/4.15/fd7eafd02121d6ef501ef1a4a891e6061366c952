geneve: fix fill_info when link down

geneve->sock4/6 were added with geneve_open and released with geneve_stop.
So when geneve link down, we will not able to show remote address and
checksum info after commit 11387fe4a98 ("geneve: fix fill_info when using
collect_metadata").

Fix this by avoid passing *_REMOTE{,6} for COLLECT_METADATA since they are
mutually exclusive, and always show UDP_ZERO_CSUM6_RX info.
