sched/fair: Implement more accurate async detach

The problem with the overestimate is that it will subtract too big a
value from the load_sum, thereby pushing it down further than it ought
to go. Since runnable_load_avg is not subject to a similar 'force',
this results in the occasional 'runnable_load > load' situation.
