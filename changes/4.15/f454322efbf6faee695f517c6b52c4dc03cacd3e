signal: replace sigset_to_compat() with put_compat_sigset()

There are 4 callers of sigset_to_compat() in the entire kernel.  One is
in sparc compat rt_sigaction(2), the rest are in kernel/signal.c itself.
All are followed by copy_to_user(), and all but the sparc one are under
"if it's big-endian..." ifdefs.

Let's transform sigset_to_compat() into put_compat_sigset() that also
calls copy_to_user().
