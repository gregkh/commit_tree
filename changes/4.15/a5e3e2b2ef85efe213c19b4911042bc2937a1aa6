clk: sunxi-ng: sun8i: h3: Use sigma-delta modulation for audio PLL

The audio blocks require specific clock rates. Until now we were using
the closest clock rate possible with integer N-M factors. This resulted
in audio playback being slightly slower than it should be.

The vendor kernel gets around this (for newer SoCs) by using sigma-delta
modulation to generate a fractional-N factor. This patch copies the
parameters for the H3.
