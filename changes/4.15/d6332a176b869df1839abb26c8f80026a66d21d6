perf callchain: Fix double mapping al->addr for children without self period

Milian Wolff found a problem he described in [1] and that for him would
get fixed:

"Note how most of the large offset values are now gone. Most notably, we
get proper srcline resolution for the random.h and complex headers."

Then Namhyung found the root cause:

"I looked into it and found a bug handling cumulative (children)
entries.  For children entries that have no self period, the al->addr (so
he->ip) ends up having an doubly-mapped address.

It seems to be there from the beginning but only affects entries that
have no srclines - finding srcline itself is done using a different
address but it will show the invalid address if no srcline was found.  I
think we should fix the commit c7405d85d7a3 ("perf tools: Update cpumode
for each cumulative entry")."
