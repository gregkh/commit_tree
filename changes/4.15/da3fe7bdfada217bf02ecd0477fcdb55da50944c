KVM: x86: ioapic: Don't fire level irq when Remote IRR set

Avoid firing a level-triggered interrupt that has the Remote IRR bit set,
because that means that some CPU is already processing it. The Remote
IRR bit will be cleared after an EOI and the interrupt will refire
if the irq line is still asserted.

This behavior is aligned with QEMU's IOAPIC implementation that was
introduced by commit f99b86b94987
("x86: ioapic: ignore level irq during processing") in QEMU.
