staging: fsl-dpaa2/eth: Fix double DMA unmap

In case we fail to allocate a skb for a fragmented ingress
frame, the cleanup function will attempt to unmap again the
first frame fragment, which had already been unmapped during
early Rx processing.

Avoid this by freeing the first buffer immediately in case
we hit an error, leaving the cleanup function to free only
the subsequent buffers.
