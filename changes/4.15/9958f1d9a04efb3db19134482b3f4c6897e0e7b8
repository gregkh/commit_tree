dm cache: remove all obsolete writethrough-specific code

Now that the writethrough code is much simpler there is no need to track
so much state or cascade bio submission (as was done, via
writethrough_endio(), to issue origin then cache IO in series).

As such the obsolete writethrough list and workqueue is also removed.
