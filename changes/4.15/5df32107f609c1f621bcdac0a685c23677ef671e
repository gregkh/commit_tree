timekeeping: Make fast accessors return 0 before timekeeping is initialized

printk timestamps will be extended to include mono and boot time by using
the fast timekeeping accessors ktime_get_mono|boot_fast_ns().  The
functions can return garbage before timekeeping is initialized resulting in
garbage timestamps.

Initialize the fast timekeepers with dummy clocks which guarantee a 0
readout up to timekeeping_init().
