padata: ensure padata_do_serial() runs on the correct CPU

If the algorithm we're parallelizing is asynchronous we might change
CPUs between padata_do_parallel() and padata_do_serial(). However, we
don't expect this to happen as we need to enqueue the padata object into
the per-cpu reorder queue we took it from, i.e. the same-cpu's parallel
queue.

Ensure we're not switching CPUs for a given padata object by tracking
the CPU within the padata object. If the serial callback gets called on
the wrong CPU, defer invoking padata_reorder() via a kernel worker on
the CPU we're expected to run on.
