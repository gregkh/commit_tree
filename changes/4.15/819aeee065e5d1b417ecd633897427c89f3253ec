X86/KVM: Clear encryption attribute when SEV is active

The guest physical memory area holding the struct pvclock_wall_clock and
struct pvclock_vcpu_time_info are shared with the hypervisor. It
periodically updates the contents of the memory.

When SEV is active, the encryption attributes from the shared memory pages
must be cleared so that both hypervisor and guest can access the data.
