powerpc/64s/hash: Allow MAP_FIXED allocations to cross 128TB boundary

While mapping hints with a length that cross 128TB are disallowed,
MAP_FIXED allocations that cross 128TB are allowed. These are failing
on hash (on radix they succeed). Add an additional case for fixed
mappings to expand the addr_limit when crossing 128TB.

Fixes: f4ea6dcb08ea ("powerpc/mm: Enable mappings above 128TB")
