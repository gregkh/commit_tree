x86/pvclock: add setter for pvclock_pvti_cpu0_va

Right now there is only a pvclock_pvti_cpu0_va() which is defined
on kvmclock since:

commit dac16fba6fc5
("x86/vdso: Get pvclock data from the vvar VMA instead of the fixmap")

The only user of this interface so far is kvm. This commit adds a
setter function for the pvti page and moves pvclock_pvti_cpu0_va
to pvclock, which is a more generic place to have it; and would
allow other PV clocksources to use it, such as Xen.

While moving pvclock_pvti_cpu0_va into pvclock, rename also this
function to pvclock_get_pvti_cpu0_va (including its call sites)
to be symmetric with the setter (pvclock_set_pvti_cpu0_va).
