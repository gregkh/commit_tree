powerpc/vas: Export HVWC to debugfs

Export the VAS Window context information to debugfs.

We need to hold a mutex when closing the window to prevent a race
with the debugfs read(). Rather than introduce a per-instance mutex,
we use the global vas_mutex for now, since it is not heavily contended.

The window->cop field is only relevant to a receive window so we were
not setting it for a send window (which is is paired to a receive window
anyway). But to simplify reporting in debugfs, set the 'cop' field for the
send window also.
