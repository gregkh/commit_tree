tipc: refactor tipc_sk_timeout() function

The function tipc_sk_timeout() is more complex than necessary, and
even seems to contain an undetected bug. At one of the occurences
where we renew the timer we just order it with (HZ / 20), instead
of (jiffies + HZ / 20);

In this commit we clean up the function.
