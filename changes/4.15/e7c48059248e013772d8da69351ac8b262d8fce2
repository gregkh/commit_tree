KVM: arm/arm64: GICv4: Add property field and per-VM predicate

Add a new has_gicv4 field in the global VGIC state that indicates
whether the HW is GICv4 capable, as a per-VM predicate indicating
if there is a possibility for a VM to support direct injection
(the above being true and the VM having an ITS).
