drm/i915: Align vswing sequences with old ddi buffer registers.

Vswing sequences on BXT and CNL are equivalent
to the ddi buffer registers setting on other platforms.

For some reason it got aligned with skl_ddi_set_iboost what
is semantically incorrect. This forced us to keep skipping
ddi buffer translation tables on the platforms that has
the vswing sequences.

v2: Don't mess with DP signal levels on this patch.
