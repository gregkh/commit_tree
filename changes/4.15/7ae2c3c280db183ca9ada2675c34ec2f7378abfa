USB: UDC core: fix double-free in usb_add_gadget_udc_release

The error-handling pathways in usb_add_gadget_udc_release() are messed
up.  Aside from the uninformative statement labels, they can deallocate
the udc structure after calling put_device(), which is a double-free.
This was observed by KASAN in automatic testing.

This patch cleans up the routine.  It preserves the requirement that
when any failure occurs, we call put_device(&gadget->dev).
