mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges

This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace.  It is
probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
tested that.

Removing the `walk->hugetlb_entry` condition in walk_hugetlb_range() has
no effect because the caller already checks for that.

This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
a hugetlb_entry callback.

This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.

v2:
 - don't crash on ->pte_hole==NULL (Andrew Morton)
 - add Cc stable (Andrew Morton)
