drm/i915: Reuse normal state readout for LVDS/DVO fixed mode

Reuse the normal state readout code to get the fixed mode for LVDS/DVO
encoders. This removes some partially duplicated state readout code
from LVDS/DVO encoders. The duplicated code wasn't actually even
populating the negative h/vsync flags, leading to possible state checker
complaints. The normal readout code populates that stuff fully.
