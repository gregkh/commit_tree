mm: introduce wrappers to access mm->nr_ptes

Let's add wrappers for ->nr_ptes with the same interface as for nr_pmd
and nr_pud.

The patch also makes nr_ptes accounting dependent onto CONFIG_MMU.  Page
table accounting doesn't make sense if you don't have page tables.

It's preparation for consolidation of page-table counters in mm_struct.
