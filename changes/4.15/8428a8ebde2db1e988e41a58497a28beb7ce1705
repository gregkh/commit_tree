ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential zero-division at parsing FU

parse_audio_feature_unit() contains a code dividing potentially with
zero when a malformed FU descriptor is passed.  Although there is
already a sanity check, it checks only the value zero, hence it can
still lead to a zero-division when a value 1 is passed there.

Fix it by correcting the sanity check (and the error message
thereof).
