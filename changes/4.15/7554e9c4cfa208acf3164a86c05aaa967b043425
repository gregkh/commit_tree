fs/nilfs2: convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer
to all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and
from_timer() to pass the timer pointer explicitly.  This requires adding
a pointer to hold the timer's target task, as the lifetime of sc_task
doesn't appear to match the timer's task.
