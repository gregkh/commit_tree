xen/pvcalls: implement connect command

Send PVCALLS_CONNECT to the backend. Allocate a new ring and evtchn for
the active socket.

Introduce fields in struct sock_mapping to keep track of active sockets.
Introduce a waitqueue to allow the frontend to wait on data coming from
the backend on the active socket (recvmsg command).

Two mutexes (one of reads and one for writes) will be used to protect
the active socket in and out rings from concurrent accesses.
