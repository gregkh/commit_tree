can: peak/pci: fix potential bug when probe() fails

PCI/PCIe drivers for PEAK-System CAN/CAN-FD interfaces do some access to the
PCI config during probing. In case one of these accesses fails, a POSITIVE
PCIBIOS_xxx error code is returned back. This POSITIVE error code MUST be
converted into a NEGATIVE errno for the probe() function to indicate it
failed. Using the pcibios_err_to_errno() function, we make sure that the
return code will always be negative.
