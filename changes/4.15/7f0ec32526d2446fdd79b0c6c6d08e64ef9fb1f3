perf/core: Remove wrong barrier

The barrier and comment make no sense:

 - if what the barrier says is true, it should be wmb() but that
   should then be part of the arch driver, not the generic code.

 - if it is an SMP barrier, there must be a matching barrier, and
   there isn't one.

So kill it.
