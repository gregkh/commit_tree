dmaengine: Add STM32 DMAMUX driver

This patch implements the STM32 DMAMUX driver.

The DMAMUX request multiplexer allows routing a DMA request line between
the peripherals and the DMA controllers of the product. The routing
function is ensured by a programmable multi-channel DMA request line
multiplexer. Each channel selects a unique DMA request line,
unconditionally or synchronously with events from its DMAMUX
synchronization inputs. The DMAMUX may also be used as a DMA request
generator from programmable events on its input trigger signals
