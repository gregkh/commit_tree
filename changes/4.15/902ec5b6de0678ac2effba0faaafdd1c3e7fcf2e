block: make blkcg aware of kthread stored original cgroup info

bio_blkcg is the only API to get cgroup info for a bio right now. If
bio_blkcg finds current task is a kthread and has original blkcg
associated, it will use the css instead of associating the bio to
current task. This makes it possible that kthread dispatches bios on
behalf of other threads.
