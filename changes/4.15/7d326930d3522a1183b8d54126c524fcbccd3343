mmc: sdhci-omap: Add OMAP SDHCI driver

Create a new sdhci-omap driver to configure the eMMC/SD/SDIO controller
in TI's OMAP SoCs making use of the SDHCI core library. For OMAP specific
configurations, populate sdhci_ops with OMAP specific callbacks and use
SDHCI quirks.
Enable only high speed mode for both SD and eMMC here and add other
UHS mode support later.
