staging: ccree: Replace kzalloc with devm_kzalloc

It is recommended to use managed function devm_kzalloc, which
simplifies driver cleanup paths and driver code.
This patch does the following:
(a) replace kzalloc with devm_kzalloc.
(b) drop kfree(), because memory allocated with devm_kzalloc() is
automatically freed on driver detach, otherwise it leads to a double
free.
(c) remove unnecessary blank lines.
