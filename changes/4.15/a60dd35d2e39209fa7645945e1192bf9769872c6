bpf: change bpf_perf_event_output arg5 type to ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO

Commit 9fd29c08e520 ("bpf: improve verifier ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO
semantics") relaxed the treatment of ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO due to the way
the compiler generates optimized BPF code when checking boundaries of an
argument from C code. A typical example of this optimized code can be
generated using the bpf_perf_event_output helper when operating on variable
memory:

/* len is a generic scalar */
if (len > 0 && len <= 0x7fff)
        bpf_perf_event_output(ctx, &perf_map, 0, buf, len);

110: (79) r5 = *(u64 *)(r10 -40)
111: (bf) r1 = r5
112: (07) r1 += -1
113: (25) if r1 > 0x7ffe goto pc+6
114: (bf) r1 = r6
115: (18) r2 = 0xffff94e5f166c200
117: (b7) r3 = 0
118: (bf) r4 = r7
119: (85) call bpf_perf_event_output#25
R5 min value is negative, either use unsigned or 'var &= const'

With this code, the verifier loses track of the variable.

Replacing arg5 with ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO is thus desirable since it
avoids this quite common case which leads to usability issues, and the
compiler generates code that the verifier can more easily test:

if (len <= 0x7fff)
        bpf_perf_event_output(ctx, &perf_map, 0, buf, len);

or

bpf_perf_event_output(ctx, &perf_map, 0, buf, len & 0x7fff);

No changes to the bpf_perf_event_output helper are necessary since it can
handle a case where size is 0, and an empty frame is pushed.
