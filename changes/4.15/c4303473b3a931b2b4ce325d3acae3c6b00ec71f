media: dvb_frontend: dtv_property_process_set() cleanups

Since all properties in the func dtv_property_process_set() use
at most 4 bytes arguments, change the code to pass
u32 cmd and u32 data as function arguments, instead of passing a
pointer to the entire struct dtv_property *tvp.

Instead of having a generic dtv_property_dump(), added its own
properties debug logic in the dtv_property_process_set().
