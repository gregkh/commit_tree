x86/insn-eval: Add utility functions to get segment selector

When computing a linear address and segmentation is used, we need to know
the base address of the segment involved in the computation. In most of
the cases, the segment base address will be zero as in USER_DS/USER32_DS.
However, it may be possible that a user space program defines its own
segments via a local descriptor table. In such a case, the segment base
address may not be zero. Thus, the segment base address is needed to
calculate correctly the linear address.

If running in protected mode, the segment selector to be used when
computing a linear address is determined by either any of segment override
prefixes in the instruction or inferred from the registers involved in the
computation of the effective address; in that order. Also, there are cases
when the segment override prefixes shall be ignored (i.e., code segments
are always selected by the CS segment register; string instructions always
use the ES segment register when using rDI register as operand). In long
mode, segment registers are ignored, except for FS and GS. In these two
cases, base addresses are obtained from the respective MSRs.

For clarity, this process can be split into four steps (and an equal
number of functions): determine if segment prefixes overrides can be used;
parse the segment override prefixes, and use them if found; if not found
or cannot be used, use the default segment registers associated with the
operand registers. Once the segment register to use has been identified,
read its value to obtain the segment selector.

The method to obtain the segment selector depends on several factors. In
32-bit builds, segment selectors are saved into a pt_regs structure
when switching to kernel mode. The same is also true for virtual-8086
mode. In 64-bit builds, segmentation is mostly ignored, except when
running a program in 32-bit legacy mode. In this case, CS and SS can be
obtained from pt_regs. DS, ES, FS and GS can be read directly from
the respective segment registers.

In order to identify the segment registers, a new set of #defines is
introduced. It also includes two special identifiers. One of them
indicates when the default segment register associated with instruction
operands shall be used. Another one indicates that the contents of the
segment register shall be ignored; this identifier is used when in long
mode.
