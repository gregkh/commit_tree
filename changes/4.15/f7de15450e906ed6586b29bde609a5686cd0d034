drm/msm: Add per-instance submit queues

Currently the behavior of a command stream is provided by the user
application during submission and the application is expected to internally
maintain the settings for each 'context' or 'rendering queue' and specify
the correct ones.

This works okay for simple cases but as applications become more
complex we will want to set context specific flags and do various
permission checks to allow certain contexts to enable additional
privileges.

Add kernel-side submit queues to be analogous to 'contexts' or
'rendering queues' on the application side. Each file descriptor
instance will maintain its own list of queues. Queues cannot be
shared between file descriptors.

For backwards compatibility context id '0' is defined as a default
context specifying no priority and no special flags. This is
intended to be the usual configuration for 99% of applications so
that a garden variety application can function correctly without
creating a queue. Only those applications requiring the specific
benefit of different queues need create one.
