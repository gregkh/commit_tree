RDMA/hns: Update the interfaces for MTT/CQE multi hop addressing in hip08

The MTT(SQWQE/SGE/RQWQE) and CQE in hip08 can support multi hop
addressing. The address of MTT/CQE can be retrieved by the BT
(Base Address Table) with multi hop addressing.

This patch is to update the interfaces in HEM to support multi hop
addressing for the MTT/CQE.
