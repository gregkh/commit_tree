arm64: mm: Remove useless and wrong comments from fault.c

Fault.c seems to be a magnet for useless and wrong comments, largely
due to its ancestry in other architectures where the code has since
moved on, but the comments have remained intact.

This patch removes both useless and incorrect comments, leaving only
those that say something correct and relevant.
