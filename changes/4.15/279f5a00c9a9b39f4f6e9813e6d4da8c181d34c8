drm/i915/execlists: Add a comment for the extra MI_ARB_ENABLE

Michel Thierry noticed that we were applying WaDisableCtxRestoreArbitration
even to gen9, which does not require the w/a. The rationale is that we
need to enable MI arbitration for execlists to work, and to be safe we
do that before every batch (in addition to every context switch into the
batch). Since this is not clear from the single line comment suggesting
the MI_ARB_ENABLE is solely for the w/a, add a little more detail.
