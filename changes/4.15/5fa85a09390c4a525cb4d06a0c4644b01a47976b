net: core: rcu-ify rtnl af_ops

rtnl af_ops currently rely on rtnl mutex: unregister (called from module
exit functions) takes the rtnl mutex and all users that do af_ops lookup
also take the rtnl mutex. IOW, parallel rmmod will block until doit()
callback is done.

As none of the af_ops implementation sleep we can use rcu instead.

doit functions that need the af_ops can now use rcu instead of the
rtnl mutex provided the mutex isn't needed for other reasons.
