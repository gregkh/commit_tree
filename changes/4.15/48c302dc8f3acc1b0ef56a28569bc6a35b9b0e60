NTB: switchtec: Add link event notifier callback

In order for the Switchtec NTB code to handle link change events we
create a notifier callback in the switchtec code which gets called
whenever an appropriate event interrupt occurs.

In order to preserve userspace's ability to follow these events,
we compare the event count with a stored copy from last time we
checked.
