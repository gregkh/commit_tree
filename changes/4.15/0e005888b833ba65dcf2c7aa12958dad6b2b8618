drm/i915: avoid division by zero on cnl_calc_wrpll_link

If for some unexpected reason the registers all read zero it's better
to WARN and return instead of dividing by zero and completely freezing
the machine.

I don't expect this to happen in the wild with the current code, but I
accidentally triggered the division by zero while doing some debugging
in an unusual environment.
