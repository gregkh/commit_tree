GFS2: Implement iomap for block_map

This patch implements iomap for block mapping, and switches the
block_map function to use it under the covers.

The additional IOMAP_F_BOUNDARY iomap flag indicates when iomap has
reached a "metadata boundary" and fetching the next mapping is likely to
incur an additional I/O.  This flag is used for setting the bh buffer
boundary flag.
