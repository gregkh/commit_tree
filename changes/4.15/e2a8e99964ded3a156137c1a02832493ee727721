drm/amdkfd: Avoid calling amd_iommu_unbind_pasid() when suspending

When kfd suspending on APU, we do not need to call
amd_iommu_unbind_pasid(), because pasid will be unbound automatically
when power goes off.

On the other hand, calling amd_iommu_unbind_pasid() will trigger
kfd_process_iommu_unbind_callback() if the process is not terminating.
By design, kfd_process_iommu_unbind_callback() should only be called
for process terminating. So we would rather not to call
amd_iommu_unbind_pasid() when suspending.
