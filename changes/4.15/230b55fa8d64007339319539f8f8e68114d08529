md: forbid a RAID5 from having both a bitmap and a journal.

Having both a bitmap and a journal is pointless.
Attempting to do so can corrupt the bitmap if the journal
replay happens before the bitmap is initialized.
Rather than try to avoid this corruption, simply
refuse to allow arrays with both a bitmap and a journal.
So:
 - if raid5_run sees both are present, fail.
 - if adding a bitmap finds a journal is present, fail
 - if adding a journal finds a bitmap is present, fail.
