scsi: mpt3sas: Fix possibility of using invalid Enclosure Handle for SAS device after host reset

Enclosure handles are not updated after host reset.  As a result, driver
device structure is holding previously assigned enclosure handle which
is different from the enclosure handle populated in the corresponding
device page.

Modified the driver to update devices enclosure handles after host reset
to current value by referring the enclosure handles from corresponding
device pages
