module: Add retpoline tag to VERMAGIC

Add a marker for retpoline to the module VERMAGIC. This catches the case
when a non RETPOLINE compiled module gets loaded into a retpoline kernel,
making it insecure.

It doesn't handle the case when retpoline has been runtime disabled.  Even
in this case the match of the retcompile status will be enforced.  This
implies that even with retpoline run time disabled all modules loaded need
to be recompiled.
