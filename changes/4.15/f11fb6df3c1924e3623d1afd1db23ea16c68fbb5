clocksource/drivers/sh_cmt: Remove support for "renesas,cmt-32*"

Remove driver matching support for the unused "renesas,cmt-32" and
"renesas,cmt-32-fast" compatible values, cfr. commit 203bb3479958c48a
("devicetree: bindings: Remove unused 32-bit CMT bindings").

As this removes the last user of SH_CMT_32BIT_FAST, all support for this
variant is removed from the driver.
