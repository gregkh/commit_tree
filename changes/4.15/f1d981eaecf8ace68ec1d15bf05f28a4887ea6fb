PM / devfreq: Use the available min/max frequency

The commit a76caf55e5b35 ("thermal: Add devfreq cooling") is able
to disable OPP as a cooling device. In result, both update_devfreq()
and {min|max}_freq_show() have to consider the 'opp->available'
status of each OPP.

So, this patch adds the 'scaling_{min|max}_freq' to struct devfreq
in order to indicate the available mininum and maximum frequency
by adjusting OPP interface such as dev_pm_opp_{disable|enable}().
The 'scaling_{min|max}_freq' are used for on both update_devfreq()
and {min|max}_freq_show().
