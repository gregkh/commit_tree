acpi, nfit: hide unknown commands from nmemX/commands

For vendor specific commands that do not have a common kernel
translation, hide them from nmemX/commands. For example, the following
results from new enabling to probe for support of the new
NVDIMM_FAMILY_INTEL DSMs specified in v1.6 of the command specification
[1]:

    # cat /sys/bus/nd/devices/nmem0/commands
    smart smart_thresh flags get_size get_data set_data effect_size
    effect_log vendor cmd_call unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown
    unknown unknown unknown
