ARM: vmlinux.lds.S: replace open coded .data sections with generic macros

Our .data section is missing PAGE_ALIGNED_DATA() which contains,
amongst other things, the vdso page. This creates a System.map that
looks like this:

c15769a8 D _edata
c1577000 d vdso_data_store
c1578000 D __start___bug_table
c1580544 D __stop___bug_table
c1580544 B __bss_start

By using RW_DATA_SECTION() we pick whatever generic sections might be
added in the future and have page-aligned data next to other strongly
aligned data. Furthermore we now include the entire thing, including the
bug table, in the data accounting surrounded by _sdata/_edata.

While at it let's also remplace the open coded .init.data by its
equivalent INIT_DATA_SECTION().
