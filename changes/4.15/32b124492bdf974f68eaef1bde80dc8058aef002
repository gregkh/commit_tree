iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Convert to IOMMU API TLB sync

Now that the core API issues its own post-unmap TLB sync call, push that
operation out from the io-pgtable-arm internals into the users. For now,
we leave the invalidation implicit in the unmap operation, since none of
the current users would benefit much from any change to that.
