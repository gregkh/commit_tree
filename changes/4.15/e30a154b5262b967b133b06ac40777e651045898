drm/i915: Read timings from the correct transcoder in intel_crtc_mode_get()

intel_crtc->config->cpu_transcoder isn't yet filled out when
intel_crtc_mode_get() gets called during output probing, so we should
not use it there. Instead intel_crtc_mode_get() figures out the correct
transcoder on its own, and that's what we should use.

If the BIOS boots LVDS on pipe B, intel_crtc_mode_get() would actually
end up reading the timings from pipe A instead (since PIPE_A==0),
which clearly isn't what we want.

It looks to me like this may have been broken by
commit eccb140bca67 ("drm/i915: hw state readout&check support for cpu_transcoder")
as that one removed the early initialization of cpu_transcoder from
intel_crtc_init().
