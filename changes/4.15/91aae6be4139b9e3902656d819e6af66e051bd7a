xfs: track cowblocks separately in i_flags

The EOFBLOCKS/COWBLOCKS tags are totally separate things, so track them
with separate i_flags.  Right now we're abusing IEOFBLOCKS for both,
which is totally bogus because we won't tag the inode with COWBLOCKS if
IEOFBLOCKS was set by a previous tagging of the inode with EOFBLOCKS.
Found by wiring up clonerange to fsstress in xfs/017.
