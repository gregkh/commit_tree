of/fdt: only store the device node basename in full_name

With dependencies on a statically allocated full path name converted to
use %pOF format specifier, we can store just the basename of node, and
the unflattening of the FDT can be simplified.

This commit will affect the remaining users of full_name. After
analyzing these users, the remaining cases should only change some print
messages. The main users of full_name are providing a name for struct
resource. The resource names shouldn't be important other than providing
/proc/iomem names.

We no longer distinguish between pre and post 0x10 dtb formats as either
a full path or basename will work. However, less than 0x10 formats have
been broken since the conversion to use libfdt (and no one has cared).
The conversion of the unflattening code to be non-recursive also broke
pre 0x10 formats as the populate_node function would return 0 in that
case.
