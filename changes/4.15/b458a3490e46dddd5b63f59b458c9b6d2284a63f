spi: rspi: Do not set SPCR_SPE in qspi_set_config_register()

The R-Car Gen2 Hardware User Manual Rev. 2.00 states:

    If the master/slave mode select bit (MSTR) is modified while the SPI
    function enable bit (SPE) is set to 1 (that is, this module is
    enabled), the subsequent operation cannot be guaranteed.

Hence do not set SPCR_SPE when setting SPCR_MSTR, just like the
.set_config_register() implementations for other RSPI variants do.

Note that when booted from QSPI, the boot loader will have set SPCR_MSTR
already, hence usually the bit is never modified by the Linux driver.
