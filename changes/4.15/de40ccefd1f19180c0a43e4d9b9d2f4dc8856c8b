kdump: print a message in case parse_crashkernel_mem resulted in zero bytes

parse_crashkernel_mem() silently returns if we get zero bytes in the
parsing function.  It is useful for debugging to add a message,
especially if the kernel cannot boot correctly.

Add a pr_info instead of pr_warn because it is expected behavior for
size = 0, eg.  crashkernel=2G-4G:128M, size will be 0 in case system
memory is less than 2G.
