net/mlx5e: Prevent possible races in VXLAN control flow

When calling add/remove VXLAN port, a lock must be held in order to
prevent race scenarios when more than one add/remove happens at the
same time.
Fix by holding our state_lock (mutex) as done by all other parts of the
driver.
Note that the spinlock protecting the radix-tree is still needed in
order to synchronize radix-tree access from softirq context.
