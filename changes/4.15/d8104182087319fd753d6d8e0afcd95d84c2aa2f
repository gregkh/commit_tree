powerpc/xmon: Don't print hashed pointers in xmon

Since commit ad67b74d2469 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")
pointers printed with %p are hashed, ie. you don't see the actual
pointer value but rather a cryptographic hash of its value.

In xmon we want to see the actual pointer values, because xmon is a
debugger, so replace %p with %px which prints the actual pointer
value.

We justify doing this in xmon because 1) xmon is a kernel crash
debugger, it's only accessible via the console 2) xmon doesn't print
to dmesg, so the pointers it prints are not able to be leaked that
way.
