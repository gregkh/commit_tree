net/smc: Fix preinitialization of buf_desc in __smc_buf_create()

With gcc-4.1.2:

    net/smc/smc_core.c: In function ‘__smc_buf_create’:
    net/smc/smc_core.c:567: warning: ‘bufsize’ may be used uninitialized in this function

Indeed, if the for-loop is never executed, bufsize is used
uninitialized.  In addition, buf_desc is stored for later use, while it
is still a NULL pointer.

Before, error handling was done by checking if buf_desc is non-NULL.
The cleanup changed this to an error check, but forgot to update the
preinitialization of buf_desc to an error pointer.

Update the preinitializatin of buf_desc to fix this.
