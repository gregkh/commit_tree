drm/amd/display: Avoid full modeset when not required

Fix IGT test case (kms_atomic_transition)
-DRM sets the mode_changed flag, while we don't need to do a full
 modeset.
-We want to override the mode_changed flag in this case

If we don't do this, we will still bypass the modeset in DC. This will
fail to update the new stream_status, causing nullptr at a later stage
when trying to access stream_status"

We now avoid this by discarding the new_stream instead of partially
filling it.
