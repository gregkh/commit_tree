IB/hfi1: Extend input hdr tracing for packet type

The etype field from the rhf can have more values than just
IB and BYPASS.

Extend the current tracing to report a symbolic for the etype
field for non-bypass packets.  Bypass packets will continue to
report the l2.

As part of this fix the etype and the l2 are added to the tracing
struct and are available for trigger and filter operations.
