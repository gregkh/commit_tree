powerpc/64s/slice: Use addr limit when computing slice mask

While computing slice mask for the free area we need make sure we only
search in the addr limit applicable for this mmap. We update the
slb_addr_limit after we request for a mmap above 128TB. But the
following mmap request with hint addr below 128TB should still limit
its search to below 128TB. ie. we should not use slb_addr_limit to
compute slice mask in this case. Instead, we should derive high addr
limit based on the mmap hint addr value.
