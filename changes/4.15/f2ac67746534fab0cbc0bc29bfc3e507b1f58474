crypto: caam - remove unneeded edesc zeroization

Extended descriptor allocation has been changed by
commit dde20ae9d6383 ("crypto: caam - Change kmalloc to kzalloc to avoid residual data")
to provide zeroized memory, meaning we no longer have to sanitize
its members - edesc->src_nents and edesc->dst_dma.
