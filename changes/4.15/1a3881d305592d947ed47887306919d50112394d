apparmor: Fix regression in profile conflict logic

The intended behaviour in apparmor profile matching is to flag a
conflict if two profiles match equally well. However, right now a
conflict is generated if another profile has the same match length even
if that profile doesn't actually match. Fix the logic so we only
generate a conflict if the profiles match.
