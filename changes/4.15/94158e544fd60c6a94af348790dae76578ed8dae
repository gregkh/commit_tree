s390/debug: improve debug_event

debug_event currently truncates the data if used with a size larger than
the buf_size of the debug feature. For lots of callers of this function,
wrappers have been implemented that loop until all data is handled.

Move that functionality into debug_event_common and get rid of the wrappers.
