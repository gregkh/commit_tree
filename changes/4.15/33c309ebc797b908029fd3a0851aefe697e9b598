USB: ulpi: fix bus-node lookup

Fix bus-node lookup during registration, which ended up searching the whole
device tree depth-first starting at the parent (or grand parent) rather
than just matching on its children.

To make things worse, the parent (or grand-parent) node could end being
prematurely freed as well.
