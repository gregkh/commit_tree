qed: Add ll2 ability of opening a secondary queue

When more than one ll2 queue is opened ( that is not an OOO queue )
ll2 code does not have enough information to determine whether
the queue is the main one or not, so a new field is added to the
acquire input data to expose the control of determining whether
the queue is the main queue or a secondary queue.
