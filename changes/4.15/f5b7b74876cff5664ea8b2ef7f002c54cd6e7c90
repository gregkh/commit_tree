dax: Allow tuning whether dax_insert_mapping_entry() dirties entry

Currently we dirty radix tree entry whenever dax_insert_mapping_entry()
gets called for a write fault. With synchronous page faults we would
like to insert clean radix tree entry and dirty it only once we call
fdatasync() and update page tables to save some unnecessary cache
flushing. Add 'dirty' argument to dax_insert_mapping_entry() for that.
