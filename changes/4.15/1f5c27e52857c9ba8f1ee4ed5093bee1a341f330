fm10k: use the MAC/VLAN queue for VF<->PF MAC/VLAN requests

Now that we have a working MAC/VLAN queue for handling MAC/VLAN messages
from the netdev, replace the default handler for the VF<->PF messages.
This new handler is very similar to the default code, but uses the
MAC/VLAN queue instead of sending the message directly. Unfortunately we
can't easily re-use the default code, so we'll just replace the entire
function.

This ensures that a VF requesting a large number of VLANs or MAC
addresses does not start a reset cycle, as explained in the commit which
introduced the message queue.
