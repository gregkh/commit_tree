arm64: entry.S: convert el1_sync

el1_sync unmasks exceptions on a case-by-case basis, debug exceptions
are unmasked, unless this was a debug exception. IRQs are unmasked
for instruction and data aborts only if the interupted context had
irqs unmasked.

Following our 'dai' order, el1_dbg should run with everything masked.
For the other cases we can inherit whatever we interrupted.

Add a macro inherit_daif to set daif based on the interrupted pstate.
