genirq: Document vcpu_info usage for percpu_devid interrupts

It is currently unclear how to set the VCPU affinity for a percpu_devid
interrupt , since the Linux irq_data structure describes the state for
multiple interrupts, one for each physical CPU on the system.  Since
each such interrupt can be associated with different VCPUs or none at
all, associating a single VCPU state with such an interrupt does not
capture the necessary semantics.

The implementers of irq_set_affinity are the Intel and AMD IOMMUs, and
the ARM GIC irqchip.  The Intel and AMD callers do not appear to use
percpu_devid interrupts, and the ARM GIC implementation only checks the
pointer against NULL vs. non-NULL.

Therefore, simply update the function documentation to explain the
expected use in the context of percpu_devid interrupts, allowing future
changes or additions to irqchip implementers to do the right thing.
