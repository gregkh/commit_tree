drm/i915/gvt: Limit read hw reg to active vgpu

mmio_read_from_hw() let vgpu could read hw reg, if vgpu's workload
is running on hw, things is good. Otherwise vgpu will get other
vgpu's reg val, it is unsafe.

This patch limit such hw access to active vgpu. If vgpu isn't
running on hw, the reg read of this vgpu will get the last active
val which saved at schedule_out.

v2: ring timestamp is walking continuously even if the ring is idle.
    so read hw directly. (Zhenyu)
