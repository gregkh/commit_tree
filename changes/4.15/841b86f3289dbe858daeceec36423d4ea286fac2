treewide: Remove TIMER_FUNC_TYPE and TIMER_DATA_TYPE casts

With all callbacks converted, and the timer callback prototype
switched over, the TIMER_FUNC_TYPE cast is no longer needed,
so remove it. Conversion was done with the following scripts:

    perl -pi -e 's|\(TIMER_FUNC_TYPE\)||g' \
        $(git grep TIMER_FUNC_TYPE | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u)

    perl -pi -e 's|\(TIMER_DATA_TYPE\)||g' \
        $(git grep TIMER_DATA_TYPE | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u)

The now unused macros are also dropped from include/linux/timer.h.
