media: davinci: make function arguments const

Make the function arguments of functions vpfe_{register/unregister}_ccdc_device
const as the pointer dev does not modify the fields of the structure
it points to. Also, declare the variable ccdc_dev const as it points to the
same structure as dev but it does not modify the fields as well.
