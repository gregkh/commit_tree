net: thunderx: remove a couple of redundant assignments

The assignment to pointer msg is redundant as it is never read, so
remove msg.  Also remove the first assignment to qset as this is not
read before the next re-assignment of a new value to qset in the
for-loop. Cleans up two clang warnings:

drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/thunder/nic_main.c:589:2: warning: Value
stored to 'msg' is never read
drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/thunder/nic_main.c:611:2: warning: Value
stored to 'qset' is never read
