PCI: Disable MSI for Freescale Layerscape PCIe RC mode

The Freescale PCIe controller advertises the MSI/MSI-X capability in both
RC and Endpoint mode, but in RC mode it doesn't support MSI/MSI-X by
itself; it can only transfer MSI/MSI-X from downstream devices.

Add a quirk to prevent use of MSI/MSI-X in RC mode.
