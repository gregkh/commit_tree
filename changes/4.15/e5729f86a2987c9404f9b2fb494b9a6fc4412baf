ima: Remove redundant conditional operator

A non-zero value is converted to 1 when assigned to a bool variable, so the
conditional operator in is_ima_appraise_enabled is redundant.

The value of a comparison operator is either 1 or 0 so the conditional
operator in ima_inode_setxattr is redundant as well.

Confirmed that the patch is correct by comparing the object file from
before and after the patch. They are identical.
