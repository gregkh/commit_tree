net: dsa: add master helper to look up slaves

The DSA tagging code does not need to know about the DSA architecture,
it only needs to return the slave device corresponding to the source
port index (and eventually the source device index for cascade-capable
switches) parsed from the frame received on the master device.

For this purpose, provide an inline dsa_master_get_slave helper which
validates the device and port indexes and look up the slave device.

This makes the tagging rcv functions more concise and robust, and also
makes dsa_get_cpu_port obsolete.
