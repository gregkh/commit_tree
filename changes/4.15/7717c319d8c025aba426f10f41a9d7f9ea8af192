nfp: make use of MAC reinit

Recent management FW images can perform full reinit of MAC cores
without requiring a reboot.  When loading the driver check if there
are changes pending and if so call NSP MAC reinit.  Full application
FW reload is still required, and all MACs need to be reinited at the
same time (not only the ones which have been reconfigured, and thus
potentially causing disruption to unrelated netdevs) therefore for
now changing MAC config without reloading the driver still remains
future work.
