drm/sun4i: hdmi: Document PAD_CTRL1 output invert bits

While debugging inverted color from the HDMI output on the A10, I
found that the lowest 3 bits were set. These were cleared on A20
boards that had normal display output. By manually toggling these
bits the mapping of the color components to these bits was found.

While these are not used anywhere, it would be nice to document
them somewhere.
