net: dsa: add tagging ops to port

The DSA tagging protocol operations are specific to each CPU port,
thus the dsa_device_ops pointer belongs to the dsa_port structure.

>From now on assign a slave's xmit copy from its CPU port tagging
operations. This will ease the future support for multiple CPU ports.

Also keep the tag_ops at the beginning of the dsa_port structure so that
we ensure copies for hot path are in cacheline 1.
