tun: fix rcu_read_lock imbalance in tun_build_skb

rcu_read_lock in tun_build_skb is used to rcu_dereference tun->xdp_prog
safely, rcu_read_unlock should be done in every return path.

Now I could see one place missing it, where it returns NULL in switch-case
XDP_REDIRECT,  another palce using rcu_read_lock wrongly, where it returns
NULL in if (xdp_xmit) chunk.

So fix both in this patch.
