bnxt_en: Fix a variable scoping in bnxt_hwrm_do_send_msg()

short_input variable is assigned to another data pointer which is
referred out of its scope. Fix it by moving short_input definition
to the beginning of bnxt_hwrm_do_send_msg() function.

No failure has been reported so far due to this issue.
