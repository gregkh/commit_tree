route: also update fnhe_genid when updating a route cache

Now when ip route flush cache and it turn out all fnhe_genid != genid.
If a redirect/pmtu icmp packet comes and the old fnhe is found and all
it's members but fnhe_genid will be updated.

Then next time when it looks up route and tries to rebind this fnhe to
the new dst, the fnhe will be flushed due to fnhe_genid != genid. It
causes this redirect/pmtu icmp packet acutally not to be applied.

This patch is to also reset fnhe_genid when updating a route cache.

Fixes: 5aad1de5ea2c ("ipv4: use separate genid for next hop exceptions")
