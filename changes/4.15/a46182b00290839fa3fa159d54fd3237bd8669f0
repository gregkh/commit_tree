net: igmp: Use correct source address on IGMPv3 reports

Closing a multicast socket after the final IPv4 address is deleted
from an interface can generate a membership report that uses the
source IP from a different interface.  The following test script, run
from an isolated netns, reproduces the issue:

    #!/bin/bash

    ip link add dummy0 type dummy
    ip link add dummy1 type dummy
    ip link set dummy0 up
    ip link set dummy1 up
    ip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
    ip addr add 192.168.99.99/24 dev dummy1

    tcpdump -U -i dummy0 &
    socat EXEC:"sleep 2" \
        UDP4-DATAGRAM:239.101.1.68:8889,ip-add-membership=239.0.1.68:10.1.1.1 &

    sleep 1
    ip addr del 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
    sleep 5
    kill %tcpdump

RFC 3376 specifies that the report must be sent with a valid IP source
address from the destination subnet, or from address 0.0.0.0.  Add an
extra check to make sure this is the case.
