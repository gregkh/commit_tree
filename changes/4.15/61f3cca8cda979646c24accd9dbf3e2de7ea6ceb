powerpc/vas: Define vas_win_id()

Define an interface to return a system-wide unique id for a given VAS
window.

The vas_win_id() will be used in a follow-on patch to generate an unique
handle for a user space receive window. Applications can use this handle
to pair send and receive windows for fast thread-wakeup.

The hardware refers to this system-wide unique id as a Partition Send
Window ID which is expected to be used during fault handling. Hence the
"pswid" in the function names.
