dmaengine: at_hdmac: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in atc_prep_dma_interleaved

_xt_ is being dereferenced before it is null checked, hence there is a
potential null pointer dereference.

Fix this by moving the pointer dereference after _xt_ has been null
checked.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
