xfs: support for synchronous DAX faults

Return IOMAP_F_DIRTY from xfs_file_iomap_begin() when asked to prepare
blocks for writing and the inode is pinned, and has dirty fields other
than the timestamps.  In __xfs_filemap_fault() we then detect this case
and call dax_finish_sync_fault() to make sure all metadata is committed,
and to insert the page table entry.

Note that this will also dirty corresponding radix tree entry which is
what we want - fsync(2) will still provide data integrity guarantees for
applications not using userspace flushing. And applications using
userspace flushing can avoid calling fsync(2) and thus avoid the
performance overhead.

[JK: Added VM_SYNC flag handling]
