ASoC: rt5670: refactor DMI quirks and fix Dell Venue settings

Additional checks exposed a mistake in the quirk for the Dell Venue
Pro 5855 (Dmic2 instead of Dmic1). Rather than adding quirk tables,
merge all quirks in a single table and use flags to differentiate
platforms.  Also add a parameter override to help support additional
platforms using this codec
