dt-bindings: iio: adc: mcp320x: Update for mcp3550/1/3

All chips supported by this driver clock data out on the falling edge
and latch data in on the rising edge, hence SPI mode (0,0) or (1,1)
must be used.

Furthermore, none of the chips has an internal reference voltage
regulator, so an external supply is always required and needs to be
specified in the device tree lest the IIO "scale" in sysfs cannot be
calculated.

Document these requirements in the device tree binding, add compatible
strings for the newly supported mcp3550/1/3 and explain that SPI mode
(0,0) should be preferred for these chips.
