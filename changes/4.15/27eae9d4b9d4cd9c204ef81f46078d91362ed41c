regulator: pbias: Select voltage table based on max-voltage

Reference manuals of OMAP5x and DRA7x have been updated to reflect
the PBIAS regulator max-voltage as 3.3V instead of 3.0V, while OMAP3x
and OMAP4x are still quoting 3.0V. So, as of now, the pbias driver
needs to support both 3.0V and 3.3V IO voltage based on the max-voltage
supported by the PBIAS regulator.
