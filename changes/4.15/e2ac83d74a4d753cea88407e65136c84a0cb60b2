x86/ftrace: Fix ORC unwinding from ftrace handlers

Steven Rostedt discovered that the ftrace stack tracer is broken when
it's used with the ORC unwinder.  The problem is that objtool is
instructed by the Makefile to ignore the ftrace_64.S code, so it doesn't
generate any ORC data for it.

Fix it by making the asm code objtool-friendly:

- Objtool doesn't like the fact that save_mcount_regs pushes RBP at the
  beginning, but it's never restored (directly, at least).  So just skip
  the original RBP push, which is only needed for frame pointers anyway.

- Annotate some functions as normal callable functions with
  ENTRY/ENDPROC.

- Add an empty unwind hint to return_to_handler().  The return address
  isn't on the stack, so there's nothing ORC can do there.  It will just
  punt in the unlikely case it tries to unwind from that code.

With all that fixed, remove the OBJECT_FILES_NON_STANDARD Makefile
annotation so objtool can read the file.
