powerpc: Add support for setting SPRN_TIDR

We need the SPRN_TIDR to be set for use with fast thread-wakeup (core-
to-core wakeup) and also with CAPI.

Each thread in a process needs to have a unique id within the process.
But for now, we assign globally unique thread ids to all threads in
the system.
