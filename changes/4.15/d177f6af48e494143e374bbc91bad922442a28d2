iio:common: drop assign iio_info.driver_module and iio_trigger_ops.owner

The equivalent of both of these are now done via macro magic when
the relevant register calls are made.  The actual structure
elements will shortly go away.

Clearly this set jumps across multiple areas, but inherently it
can't be grouped like the other sets in this series so I've done
all the stuff in the common directory together.
