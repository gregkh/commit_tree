usb: xhci: Handle USB transaction error on address command

Xhci driver handles USB transaction errors on transfer events,
but transaction errors are possible on address device command
completion events as well.

The xHCI specification (section 4.6.5) says: A USB Transaction
Error Completion Code for an Address Device Command may be due
to a Stall response from a device. Software should issue a Disable
Slot Command for the Device Slot then an Enable Slot Command to
recover from this error.

This patch handles USB transaction errors on address command
completion events. The related discussion threads can be found
through below links.
