pinctrl: sh-pfc: Remove matching on plain sh-pfc platform device

As of commit 8682b3c522c639f3 ("sh-pfc: Remove platform device
registration"), plain "sh-pfc" platform devices are no longer created.
Hence remove their match entry, and the now obsolete checks for missing
device IDs and driver data.
