powerpc/64s: Support disabling RFI flush with no_rfi_flush and nopti

Because there may be some performance overhead of the RFI flush, add
kernel command line options to disable it.

We add a sensibly named 'no_rfi_flush' option, but we also hijack the
x86 option 'nopti'. The RFI flush is not the same as KPTI, but if we
see 'nopti' we can guess that the user is trying to avoid any overhead
of Meltdown mitigations, and it means we don't have to educate every
one about a different command line option.
