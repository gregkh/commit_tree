staging: greybus/loopback: use ktime_get() for time intervals

This driver is the only one using the deprecated timeval_to_ns()
helper. Changing it from do_gettimeofday() to ktime_get() makes
the code more efficient, more robust against concurrent
settimeofday(), more accurate and lets us get rid of that helper
in the future.
