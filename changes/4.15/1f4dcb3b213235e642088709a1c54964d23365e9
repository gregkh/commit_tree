KVM: x86: emulator: Return to user-mode on L1 CPL=0 emulation failure

On this case, handle_emulation_failure() fills kvm_run with
internal-error information which it expects to be delivered
to user-mode for further processing.
However, the code reports a wrong return-value which makes KVM to never
return to user-mode on this scenario.

Fixes: 6d77dbfc88e3 ("KVM: inject #UD if instruction emulation fails and exit to
userspace")
