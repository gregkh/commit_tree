staging: greybus: loopback: convert loopback to use generic async operations

Loopback has its own internal method for tracking and timing out
asynchronous operations however previous patches make it possible to use
functionality provided by operation.c to do this instead. Using the code in
operation.c means we can completely subtract the timer, the work-queue, the
kref and the cringe-worthy 'pending' flag. The completion callback
triggered by operation.c will provide an authoritative result code -
including -ETIMEDOUT for asynchronous operations.
