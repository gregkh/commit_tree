powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Fix incorrect comparison in memord

In the hv-24x7 code there is a function memord() which tries to
implement a sort function return -1, 0, 1. However one of the
conditions is incorrect, such that it can never be true, because we
will have already returned.

I don't believe there is a bug in practice though, because the
comparisons are an optimisation prior to calling memcmp().

Fix it by swapping the second comparision, so it can be true.
