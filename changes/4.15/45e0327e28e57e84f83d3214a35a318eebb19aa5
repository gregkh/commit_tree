drm/i915: Plumb crtc_state etc. directly to intel_ddi_pre_enable_{dp,hdmi}()

Rather that plumb the link parameters separately to
intel_ddi_pre_enable_dp() let's just pass the entire crtc state.

intel_ddi_pre_enable_hdmi() already took the crtc state, but for some
reason intel_ddi_pre_enable() still wanted to extract has_infoframe
from therein and pass it in separately. Let's not do that since it's
pointless.

v2: Rebase due to more code getting pulled into the DDI hooks
