qed: Fix initialization of ll2 offload feature

enable_ip_cksum, enable_l4_cksum, calc_ip_len were added in
commit stated below but not passed through to FW. This was OK
until now as it wasn't used, but is required for the iWARP
unaligned flow

Fixes:7c7973b2ae27 ("qed: LL2 to use packed information for tx")
