net: core: drop pointless check in __dev_alloc_name

The only caller passes a stack buffer as buf, so it won't equal the
passed-in name. Moreover, we're already using buf as a scratch buffer
inside the if (p) {} block, so if buf and name were the same, that
snprintf() call would be overwriting its own format string.
