drm/i915/gvt: Add support for PCIe extended configuration space

IGD is PCIe device and has extended configuration space. Checking
the binary dump, we can see we have Caps located out of PCI compatible
Configuration Space range.

Currently, we only emulate the PCI compatible Configuration Space.
This is okay if we attach vGPU to PCI bus. But when we attach to
a PCI Express bus (when Qemu emulates a Intel Q35 chipset which has
PCIe slot), it will not work. Extended Configuration Space is required
for a PCIe device.

This patch extended the virtual configuration space from 256 bytes
to 4KB bytes. So we are to be a *real* PCIe device. And for the
Extended CapList we keep same to physical GPU.
