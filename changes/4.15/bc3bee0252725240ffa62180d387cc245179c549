rtc: pcf8523: add support for trimming the RTC oscillator

Add support for reading and writing the RTC offset register, converting
it to the corresponding parts-per-billion value.

When setting the drift, the PCF8523 has two modes: one applies the
adjustment every two hours, the other applies the adjustment every
minute.  We select between these two modes according to which ever
gives the closest PPB value to the one requested.
