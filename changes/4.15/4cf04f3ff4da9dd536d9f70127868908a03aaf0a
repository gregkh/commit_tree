mlxsw: spectrum: Handle NETDEV_CHANGE on L3 tunnels

Changes to L3 tunnel netdevices (through `ip tunnel change' as well as
`ip link set') lead to NETDEV_CHANGE being generated on the tunnel
device. Because what is relevant for the tunnel in question depends on
the tunnel type, handling of the event is dispatched to the IPIP module
through a newly-added interface mlxsw_sp_ipip_ops.ol_netdev_change().

IPIP tunnels now remember the last set of tunnel parameters in struct
mlxsw_sp_ipip_entry.parms, and use it to figure out what exactly has
changed.
