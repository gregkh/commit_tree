md: raid10: remove VLAIS

The raid10 driver can't be built with clang since it uses a variable
length array in a structure (VLAIS):

drivers/md/raid10.c:4583:17: error: fields must have a constant size:
  'variable length array in structure' extension will never be supported

Allocate the r10bio struct with kmalloc instead of using the VLAIS
construct.

Shaohua: set the MD_RECOVERY_INTR bit
Neil Brown: use GFP_NOIO
