drm/sun4i: call drm_vblank_init with correct number of crtcs

If we want to have vblank on both pipelines at the same time, we need
to call drm_vblank_init with num_crtcs = 2.

Instead, since the crtc init calls correctly set mode_config.num_crtc,
we can move the drm_vblank_init call to after the crtc init code is
called, which is the component bind part. Then we can just pass
mode_config.num_crtc in.
