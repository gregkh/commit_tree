media: dvb_frontend: cleanup ioctl handling logic

Currently, there are two handlers for ioctls:
 - dvb_frontend_ioctl_properties()
 - dvb_frontend_ioctl_legacy()

Despite their names, both handles non-legacy DVB ioctls.

Besides that, there's no reason why to not handle all ioctls
on a single handler function.

So, merge them into a single function (dvb_frontend_handle_ioctl)
and reorganize the ioctl's to indicate what's the current DVB
API and what's deprecated.

Despite the big diff, the handling logic for each ioctl is the
same as before.
