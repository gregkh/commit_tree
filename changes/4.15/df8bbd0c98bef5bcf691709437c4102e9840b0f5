s390/kprobes: remove KPROBE_SWAP_INST state

For an unknown reason the s390 kprobes instruction replacement
function modifies the kprobe_status of the current CPU to
KPROBE_SWAP_INST. This was supposed to catch traps that happened
during instruction patching. Such a fault is not supposed to happen,
and silently discarding such a fault is certainly also not what we
want. In fact s390 is the only architecture which has this odd piece
of code.

Just remove this and behave like all other architectures. This was
pointed out by Jens Remus.
