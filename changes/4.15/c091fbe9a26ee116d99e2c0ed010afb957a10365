block: fix CDROM dependency on BLK_DEV

After the cdrom cleanup, I get randconfig warnings for some configurations:

warning: (BLK_DEV_IDECD && BLK_DEV_SR) selects CDROM which has unmet direct dependencies (BLK_DEV)

This adds an explicit BLK_DEV dependency for both drivers. The other
drivers that select 'CDROM' already have this and don't need a change.
