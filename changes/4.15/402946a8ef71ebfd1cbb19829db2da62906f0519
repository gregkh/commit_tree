HID: i2c-hid: Add no-irq-after-reset quirk for 0911:5288 device

Several cheap Apollo Lake based laptops / 2-in-1s use an i2c-hid mt
touchpad which is advertised by the DSDT with an ACPI HID of "SYNA3602",
this touchpad can be found on e.g. the Cube Thinker and the EZBook 3 Pro.

On my "T-bao Tbook air" the i2c-hid driver fails to bind to this touchpad:
"i2c_hid i2c-SYNA3602:00: failed to reset device.".

After some debuging this it seems that this touchpad simply never sends
an interrupt after a reset as expected by the i2c hid driver. This commit
adds a quirk for this device, making i2c_hid_command sleep 100ms after
a reset instead of waiting for an irq, fixing i2c-hid failing to bind to
this touchpad.
