tracing: Reimplement log2

log2 as currently implemented applies only to u64 trace_event_field
derived fields, and assumes that anything it's applied to is a u64
field.

To prepare for synthetic fields like latencies, log2 should be
applicable to those as well, so take the opportunity now to fix the
current problems as well as expand to more general uses.

log2 should be thought of as a chaining function rather than a field
type.  To enable this as well as possible future function
implementations, add a hist_field operand array into the hist_field
definition for this purpose, and make use of it to implement the log2
'function'.
