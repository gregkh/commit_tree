rcutorture: Dump writer stack if stalled

Right now, rcutorture warns if an rcu_torture_writer() kthread stalls,
but this warning is not always all that helpful.  This commit therefore
makes the first such warning include a stack dump.

This in turn requires that sched_show_task() be exported to GPL modules,
so this commit makes that change as well.
