powerpc/64s/hash: Fix fork() with 512TB process address space

Hash unconditionally resets the addr_limit to default (128TB) when the
mm context is initialised. If a process has > 128TB mappings when it
forks, the child will not get the 512TB addr_limit, so accesses to
valid > 128TB mappings will fail in the child.

Fix this by only resetting the addr_limit to default if it was 0. Non
zero indicates it was duplicated from the parent (0 means exec()).

Fixes: f4ea6dcb08ea ("powerpc/mm: Enable mappings above 128TB")
