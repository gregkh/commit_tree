nvme: track subsystems

This adds a new nvme_subsystem structure so that we can track multiple
controllers that belong to a single subsystem.  For now we only use it
to store the NQN, and to check that we don't have duplicate NQNs unless
the involved subsystems support multiple controllers.

Includes code originally from Hannes Reinecke to expose the subsystems
in sysfs.
