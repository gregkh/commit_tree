Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix a rescind issue

The current rescind processing code will not correctly handle
the case where the host immediately rescinds a channel that has
been offerred. In this case, we could be blocked in the open call and
since the channel is rescinded, the host will not respond and we could
be blocked forever in the vmbus open call.i Fix this problem.
