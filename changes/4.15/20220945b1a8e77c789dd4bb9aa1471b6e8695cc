ASoC: rt5514-spi: only enable wakeup when fully initialized

If an rt5514-spi device is probed but the platform hasn't linked it in,
we might never fully request the SPI IRQ, nor configure the rt5514 DSP,
but we still might try to enable the SPI IRQ (enable_irq_wake()). This
is bad, and among other things, can cause the interrupt to trigger every
time we try to suspend the system (e.g., because the interrupt trigger
setting was never set properly).

Instead of setting our wakeup capabilities in the SPI driver probe
routine, let's wait until we've actually requested the IRQ.

Fixes issues seen on the "kevin" Chromebook (Samsung Chromebook Plus).
