serdev: enable TTY port controller support by default

Amend the Serial device bus Kconfig entries to clarify that you most
likely also want to enable TTY port controller support, and make
SERIAL_DEV_CTRL_TTYPORT default to Y (when bus support is enabled).

Note that the TTY port controller is currently the only in-kernel
serdev controller implementation.
