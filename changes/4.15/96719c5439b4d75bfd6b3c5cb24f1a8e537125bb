drm/amd/display: Explicitly call ->reset for each object

We need to avoid calling reset after detection because the next
commit adds freesync properties on the atomic_state which are set
during detection. Calling reset after this clears them.

The easiest way to accomplish this right now is to call ->reset on
the connector right after creation but before detection. To stay
consistent call ->reset on every other object as well after creation.

v2: Provide better reason for this change in commit msg.
