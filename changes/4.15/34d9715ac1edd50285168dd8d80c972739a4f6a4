block: wake up all tasks blocked in get_request()

Once blk_set_queue_dying() is done in blk_cleanup_queue(), we call
blk_freeze_queue() and wait for q->q_usage_counter becoming zero. But
if there are tasks blocked in get_request(), q->q_usage_counter can
never become zero. So we have to wake up all these tasks in
blk_set_queue_dying() first.
