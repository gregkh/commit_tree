gpio: brcmstb: Do not use gc->pin2mask()

The pin2mask() accessor only shuffles BIT ORDER in big endian systems,
i.e. the bitstuffing is swizzled big endian so "bit 0" is bit 7 or
bit 15 or bit 31 or so.

The brcmstb only uses big endian BYTE ORDER which will be taken car of
by the ->write_reg() callback.

Just use BIT(offset) to assign the bit.
