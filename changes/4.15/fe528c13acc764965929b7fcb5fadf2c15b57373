drm/amdkfd: Fix event destruction with pending waiters

When an event with pending waiters is destroyed, those waiters may
end up sleeping forever unless they are notified and woken up.
Implement the notification by clearing the waiter->event pointer,
which becomes invalid anyway, when the event is freed, and waking
up the waiting tasks.

Waiters on an event that's destroyed return failure.
