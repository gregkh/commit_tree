mmc: core: Introduce host claiming by context

Currently the host can be claimed by a task.  Change this so that the host
can be claimed by a context that may or may not be a task.  This provides
for the host to be claimed by a block driver queue to support blk-mq, while
maintaining compatibility with the existing use of mmc_claim_host().
