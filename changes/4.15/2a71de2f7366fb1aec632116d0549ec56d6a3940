serial: omap: Fix EFR write on RTS deassertion

Commit 348f9bb31c56 ("serial: omap: Fix RTS handling") sought to enable
auto RTS upon manual RTS assertion and disable it on deassertion.
However it seems the latter was done incorrectly, it clears all bits in
the Extended Features Register *except* auto RTS.
