Input: add support for the Samsung S6SY761 touchscreen

The S6SY761 touchscreen is a capicitive multi-touch controller
for mobile use. It's connected with i2c at the address 0x48.

This commit provides a basic version of the driver which can
handle only initialization, touch events and power states.

The controller is controlled by a firmware which, in the version
I currently have, doesn't provide all the possible
functionalities mentioned in the datasheet.
