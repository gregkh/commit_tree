make sock_alloc_file() do sock_release() on failures

This changes calling conventions (and simplifies the hell out
the callers).  New rules: once struct socket had been passed
to sock_alloc_file(), it's been consumed either by struct file
or by sock_release() done by sock_alloc_file().  Either way
the caller should not do sock_release() after that point.
