s390/cpumf: introduce AUX buffer for dump diagnostic sample data

Current implementation uses a private buffer for cpumf to dump samples.
Samples first go to this buffer. Then copy to ring buffer allocated
by perf core. With AUX buffer, this copy is not needed. AUX buffer is
shared and zero-copy mapped to user space. The trailer information at
the end of each SDB(sample data block) is also exported to user space.
AUX buffer is used when diagnostic sampling mode is enabled.

This patch contains functions to setup/free AUX buffer or to begin/end
sampling per-cpu. Also include function called in interrupt to
collect samples.
