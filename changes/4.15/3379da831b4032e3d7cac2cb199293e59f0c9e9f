drm/amd/display: Use dc_update_surfaces_for_stream for flip.

Today we use special interface for flip because of fear of cuncurency issues
over dc->current_ctx. This should be no longer an issue when flipping on
multiple CRTCs concurently since for fast update (as flip is) no new context
is created and the exsisitng is not destroyed. For full updates case when
removing or adding streams on once CRTC while flipping on another
Adding all current active CRTC's states to the atomic commit in
amdgpu_dm_atomic_check will garntee that any such full update commit
will wait for completion of any outstanding flip.
