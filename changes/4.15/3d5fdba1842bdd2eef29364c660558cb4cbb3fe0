net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Fix interrupt masking on removal

When removing the interrupt handling code, we should mask the
generation of interrupts. The code however unmasked all
interrupts. This can then cause a new interrupt. We then get into a
deadlock where the interrupt thread is waiting to run, and the code
continues, trying to remove the interrupt handler, which means waiting
for the thread to complete. On a UP machine this deadlocks.

Fix so we really mask interrupts in the hardware. The same error is
made in the error path when install the interrupt handling code.
