staging: wilc1000: Fix bssid buffer offset in Txq

Commit 46949b48568b ("staging: wilc1000: New cfg packet
format in handle_set_wfi_drv_handler") updated the frame
format sent from host to the firmware. The code to update
the bssid offset in the new frame was part of a second
patch in the series which did not make it in and thus
causes connection problems after associating to an AP.

This fix adds the proper offset of the bssid value in the
Tx queue buffer to fix the connection issues.
