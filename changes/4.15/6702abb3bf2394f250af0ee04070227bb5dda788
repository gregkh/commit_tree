pinctrl: armada-37xx: Fix direction_output() callback behavior

The direction_output callback of the gpio_chip structure is supposed to
set the output direction but also to set the value of the gpio. For the
armada-37xx driver this callback acted as the gpio_set_direction callback
for the pinctrl.

This patch fixes the behavior of the direction_output callback by also
applying the value received as parameter.
