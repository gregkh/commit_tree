ASoC: Intel: boards: use devm_clk_get() unconditionally

The clock framework was only used in Baytrail, on Cherrytrail
the firmware takes care of the MCLK/plt_clk_3.

With the fix in 'commit d31fd43c0f9a
("clk: x86: Do not gate clocks enabled by the firmware")'

the firmware-managed clocks are not impacted by enable/disable
requests make at the driver level, and the rates are identical.

Remove all checks for Baytrail and use devm_clk_get()
unconditionally. Tested on Asus T100HA (CHT) and Asus T100TAF (BYT)

Note that the RT5640 and RT5645 machine drivers need to keep some
checks for Valleyview to check for Baytrail-CR.
