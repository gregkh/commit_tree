arm: dts: fix unit-address leading 0s

Fix dtc warnings for 'simple_bus_reg' due to leading 0s. Converted using
the following command:

perl -p -i -e 's/\@0+([0-9a-f])/\@$1/g' `find arch/arm/boot/dts -type -f -name '*.dts*'

Dropped changes to ARM, Ltd. boards LED nodes and manually fixed up some
occurrences of uppercase hex.
