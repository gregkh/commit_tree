arm64: wire frequency-invariant accounting support up to the task scheduler

Commit dfbca41f3479 ("sched: Optimize freq invariant accounting")
changed the wiring which now has to be done by associating
arch_scale_freq_capacity with the actual implementation provided
by the architecture.

Define arch_scale_freq_capacity to use the arch_topology "driver"
function topology_get_freq_scale() for the task scheduler's
frequency-invariant accounting instead of the default
arch_scale_freq_capacity() in kernel/sched/sched.h.
