net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Unregister MDIO bus on error path

The MDIO busses need to be unregistered before they are freed,
otherwise BUG() is called. Add a call to the unregister code if the
registration fails, since we can have multiple busses, of which some
may correctly register before one fails. This requires moving the code
around a little.
