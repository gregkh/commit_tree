scsi: lpfc: Make ktime sampling more accurate

Need to make ktime samples more accurate

If ktime is turned on in the middle of an IO, the max calculation could
be misleading. Base sampling on the start time of the IO as opposed to
ktime_on.

Make ISR ktime timestamps be from when CQE is read instead of EQE.
Added additional sanity checks when deciding whether to accept an IO
sample or not.
