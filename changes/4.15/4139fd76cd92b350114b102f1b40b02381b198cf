serial: imx: only set dma_is_rxing when DMA starts

The variable dma_is_rxing is currently set to 1 in imx_disable_rx_int().
This is problematic as:

- whilst imx_disable_rx_int() is currently always called before
  start_rx_dma() this dependency isn't obvious.
- start_rx_dma() does error checking and might exit without
  enabling DMA. Currently this will result in dma_is_rxing suggesting
  that DMA is being used for recieving.

To avoid these issues, move the setting of dma_is_rxing to
start_rx_dma() when appropriate.
