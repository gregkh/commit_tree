dmaengine: usb-dmac: Add compatible string for r8a7743/5

This patch adds support for r8a7743/5 SoCs. The Renesas RZ/G1[ME]
(R8A7743/5) usbdmac engine is identical to the R-Car Gen2 family.

No driver change is needed due to the fallback compatible value
"renesas,r8a7743-usb-dmac".
Adding the SoC-specific compatible values here has two purposes:
  1. Document which SoCs have this hardware module,
  2. Allow checkpatch to validate compatible values.
