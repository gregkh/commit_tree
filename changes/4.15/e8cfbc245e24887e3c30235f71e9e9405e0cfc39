pid: remove pidhash

pidhash is no longer required as all the information can be looked up
from idr tree.  nr_hashed represented the number of pids that had been
hashed.  Since, nr_hashed and PIDNS_HASH_ADDING are no longer relevant,
it has been renamed to pid_allocated and PIDNS_ADDING respectively.
