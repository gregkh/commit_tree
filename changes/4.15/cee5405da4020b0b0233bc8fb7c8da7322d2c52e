powerpc/hotplug: Improve responsiveness of hotplug change

powerpc/hotplug: On Power systems with shared configurations of CPUs
and memory, there are some issues with the association of additional
CPUs and memory to nodes when hot-adding resources.  During hotplug
CPU operations, this patch resets the timer on topology update work
function to a small value to better ensure that the CPU topology is
detected and configured sooner.
