mlxsw: spectrum_router: Offload decap only for up tunnels

When a new local route is added, an IPIP entry is looked up to determine
whether the route should be offloaded as a tunnel decap or as a trap.
That decision should take into account whether the tunnel netdevice in
question is actually IFF_UP, and only install a decap offload if it is.
