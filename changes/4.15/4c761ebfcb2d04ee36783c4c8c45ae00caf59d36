ASoC: Intel: kbl: Modify map for Headset Playback to fix pop-noise

Patch fixes wrong path in commit 0b06122fc8d0 ("ASoC: Intel: kbl: Add
map for new DAIs for Multi-Playback & Echo Ref") which resulted in pop
noise.
Current topology for Headset results in unwanted pop noise, while
switching from spk->hs at the start of Headset Playback.
Hence re-introduced mixin-mixout dsp module in topology for headset
playback pipe to fix the regression.
And the corresponding modification for headset route is updated here.
