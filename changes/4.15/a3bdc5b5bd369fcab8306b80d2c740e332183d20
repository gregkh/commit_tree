hwmon: (asc7621) remove redundant assignment to newval

The setting of newval to zero is redundant as the following if/else
stanzas will always update newval to a new value. Remove the
redundant setting, cleans up clang build warning:

drivers/hwmon/asc7621.c:582:2: warning: Value stored to 'newval' is
never read
