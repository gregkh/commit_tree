net: core: improve sanity checking in __dev_alloc_name

__dev_alloc_name is called from the public (and exported)
dev_alloc_name(), so we don't have a guarantee that strlen(name) is at
most IFNAMSIZ. If somebody manages to get __dev_alloc_name called with a
% char beyond the 31st character, we'd be making a snprintf() call that
will very easily crash the kernel (using an appropriate %p extension,
we'll likely dereference some completely bogus pointer).

In the normal case where strlen() is sane, we don't even save anything
by limiting to IFNAMSIZ, so just use strchr().
