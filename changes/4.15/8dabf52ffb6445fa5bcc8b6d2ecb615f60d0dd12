staging: fsl-mc/dpio: Fix incorrect comparison

For some dpio functions, a cpu id parameter value of -1 is
valid and means "any". But when trying to validate this param
value against an upper limit, in this case num_possible_cpus(),
we risk obtaining the wrong result due to an implicit cast.

Avoid an incorrect check result by explicitly comparing the
cpu id with the "any" value before verifying the upper bound.
