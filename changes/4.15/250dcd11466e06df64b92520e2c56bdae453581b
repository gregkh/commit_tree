mmc: sdhci: Avoid swiotlb buffer being full

The commit de3ee99b097d ("mmc: Delete bounce buffer handling") deletes the
bounce buffer handling, but also causes the max_req_size for sdhci to be
increased, in case when max_segs == 1. This causes errors for sdhci-pci
Ricoh variant, about the swiotlb buffer to become full.

Fix the issue, by taking IO_TLB_SEGSIZE and IO_TLB_SHIFT into account when
deciding the max_req_size for sdhci.
