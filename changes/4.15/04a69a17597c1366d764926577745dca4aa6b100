net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: setup random mac address

An Ethernet switch may support having a MAC address, which can be used
as the switch's source address in transmitted full-duplex Pause frames.

If a DSA switch supports the related .set_addr operation, the DSA core
sets the master's MAC address on the switch. This won't make sense
anymore in a multi-CPU ports system, because there won't be a unique
master device assigned to a switch tree.

Instead, setup the switch from within the Marvell driver with a random
MAC address, and remove the .set_addr implementation.
