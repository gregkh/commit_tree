KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Preserve the revious read from the pending table

The current pending table parsing code assumes that we keep the
previous read of the pending bits, but keep that variable in
the current block, making sure it is discarded on each loop.

We end-up using whatever is on the stack. Who knows, it might
just be the right thing...
