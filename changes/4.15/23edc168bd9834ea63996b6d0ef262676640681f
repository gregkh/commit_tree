- microSD slot
- MicroUSB Type-B port for power and connected to usb0
- HDMI output
- MIPI DSI connector
- 4 USB Type-A ports (connected to the usb1 controller via a hub)
- gigabit ethernet with Realtek RTL8211E transceiver
- WiFi/Bluetooth with AP6212 module, with external antenna connector
- SATA and power connectors for native SATA support
- camera sensor connector
- audio out headphone jack
- red and green LEDs
- debug UART pins
- Raspberry Pi B+ compatible GPIO header
- power and reset buttons

This patch adds a dts file that enables UART, MMC and PMIC support.
