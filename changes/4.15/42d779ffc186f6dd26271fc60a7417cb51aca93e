nfp: fix port stats for mac representors

Previously we swapped the tx_packets, tx_bytes and tx_dropped counters
with rx_packets, rx_bytes and rx_dropped counters, respectively. This
behaviour is correct and expected for VF representors but it should not
be swapped for physical port mac representors.
