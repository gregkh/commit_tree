locking/qrwlock: Use 'struct qrwlock' instead of 'struct __qrwlock'

There's no good reason to keep the internal structure of struct qrwlock
hidden from qrwlock.h, particularly as it's actually needed for unlock
and ends up being abstracted independently behind the __qrwlock_write_byte()
function.

Stop pretending we can hide this stuff, and move the __qrwlock definition
into qrwlock, removing the __qrwlock_write_byte() nastiness and using the
same struct definition everywhere instead.
