x86: xen: remove the use of VLAIS

Variable Length Arrays In Structs (VLAIS) is not supported by Clang, and
frowned upon by others.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/23/500

Here, the VLAIS was used because the size of the bitmap returned from
xen_mc_entry() depended on possibly (based on kernel configuration)
runtime sized data. Rather than declaring args as a VLAIS then calling
sizeof on *args, we calculate the appropriate sizeof args manually.
Further, we can get rid of the #ifdef's and rely on num_possible_cpus()
(thanks to a helpful checkpatch warning from an earlier version of this
patch).
