drm: Reorganize drm_pending_event to support future event types [v2]

Place drm_event_vblank in a new union that includes that and a bare
drm_event structure. This will allow new members of that union to be
added in the future without changing code related to the existing vbl
event type.

Assignments to the crtc_id field are now done when the event is
allocated, rather than when delievered. This way, delivery doesn't
need to have the crtc ID available.

v2:
 * Remove 'dev' argument from create_vblank_event

	It wasn't being used anyways, and if we need it in the future,
	we can always get it from crtc->dev.

 * Check for MODESETTING before looking for crtc in queue_vblank_event

	UMS drivers will oops if we try to get a crtc, so make sure
	we're modesetting before we try to find a crtc_id to fill into
	the event.
