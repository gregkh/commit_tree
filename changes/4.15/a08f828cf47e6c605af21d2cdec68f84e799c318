powerpc/64: Convert fast_exception_return to use RFI_TO_USER/KERNEL

Similar to the syscall return path, in fast_exception_return we may be
returning to user or kernel context. We already have a test for that,
because we conditionally restore r13. So use that existing test and
branch, and bifurcate the return based on that.
