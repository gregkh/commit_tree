dm: allocate struct mapped_device with kvzalloc

The structure srcu_struct can be very big, its size is proportional to the
value CONFIG_NR_CPUS. The Fedora kernel has CONFIG_NR_CPUS 8192, the field
io_barrier in the struct mapped_device has 84kB in the debugging kernel
and 50kB in the non-debugging kernel. The large size may result in failure
of the function kzalloc_node.

In order to avoid the allocation failure, we use the function
kvzalloc_node, this function falls back to vmalloc if a large contiguous
chunk of memory is not available. This patch also moves the field
io_barrier to the last position of struct mapped_device - the reason is
that on many processor architectures, short memory offsets result in
smaller code than long memory offsets - on x86-64 it reduces code size by
320 bytes.

Note to stable kernel maintainers - the kernels 4.11 and older don't have
the function kvzalloc_node, you can use the function vzalloc_node instead.
