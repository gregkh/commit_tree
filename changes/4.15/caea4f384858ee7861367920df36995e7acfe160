drm/sun4i: validate modes for HDMI

When I connected my cubieboard running 4.15-rc1 to my 4k display I got no
picture. Some digging found that there is no check against the upper
pixelclock limit of the HDMI output, so X selects a 4kp60 format at 594
MHz, which obviously won't work.

The patch below adds a check for the upper bound of what this hardware can
do, and it checks if the requested tmds clock can be obtained.

It also allows for the +/- 0.5% pixel clock variation that the HDMI spec permits.

That code is based on commit 22d0be2a557e ("drm: arcpgu: Allow some clock
deviation in crtc->mode_valid() callback") from Jose Abreu for drm/arc.
