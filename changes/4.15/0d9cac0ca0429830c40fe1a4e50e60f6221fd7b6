drm/vmwgfx: Potential off by one in vmw_view_add()

The vmw_view_cmd_to_type() function returns vmw_view_max (3) on error.
It's one element beyond the end of the vmw_view_cotables[] table.

My read on this is that it's possible to hit this failure.  header->id
comes from vmw_cmd_check() and it's a user controlled number between
1040 and 1225 so we can hit that error.  But I don't have the hardware
to test this code.
