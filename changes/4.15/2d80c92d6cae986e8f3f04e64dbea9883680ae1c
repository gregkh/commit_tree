selftests/exec: include cwd in long path calculation

When creating a pathname close to PATH_MAX to test execveat, factor in
the current working directory path otherwise we end up with an absolute
path that is longer than PATH_MAX. While execveat() may succeed, subsequent
calls to the kernel from the runtime environment which are required to
successfully execute the test binary/script may fail because of this.

To keep the semantics of the test the same, rework the relative pathname
part of the test to be relative to the root directory so it isn't
decreased by the length of the current working directory path.
