drm/i915: introduce page_size members

In preparation for supporting huge gtt pages for the ppgtt, we introduce
page size members for gem objects.  We fill in the page sizes by
scanning the sg table.

v2: pass the sg_mask to set_pages

v3: calculate the sg_mask inline with populating the sg_table where
possible, and pass to set_pages along with the pages.

v4: bunch of improvements from Joonas

v5: fix num_pages blunder
    introduce i915_sg_page_sizes helper

v6: prefer GEM_BUG_ON(sizes == 0)
