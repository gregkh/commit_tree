scsi: megaraid_sas: reduce size of fusion_context and use kmalloc for allocation

fusion_context structure is very large around 180kB and most of the size
is contributed by log_to_span array. Move log_to_span out of fusion
context and have separate allocation for log_to_span. And use kmalloc to
allocate fusion_context.  Currently kmemleak reports 1000s of false
positives for fusion->cmd_list[]. kmemleak does not track page
allocation for fusion_context. This change will also fix the false
positives reported by kmemleak.
