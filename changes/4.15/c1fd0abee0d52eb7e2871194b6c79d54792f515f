dm mpath: fix bio-based multipath queue_if_no_path handling

Commit ca5beb76 ("dm mpath: micro-optimize the hot path relative to
MPATHF_QUEUE_IF_NO_PATH") caused bio-based DM-multipath to fail mptest's
"test_02_sdev_delete".

Restoring the logic that existed prior to commit ca5beb76 fixes this
bio-based DM-multipath regression.  Also verified all mptest tests pass
with request-based DM-multipath.

This commit effectively reverts commit ca5beb76 -- but it does so
without reintroducing the need to take the m->lock spinlock in
must_push_back_{rq,bio}.
