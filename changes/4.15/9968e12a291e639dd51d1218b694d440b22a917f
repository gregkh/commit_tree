platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix tablet mode detection for convertibles

Commit f9cf3b2880cc ("platform/x86: hp-wmi: Refactor dock and tablet
state fetchers") consolidated the methods for docking and laptop mode
detection, but omitted to apply the correct mask for the laptop mode
(it always uses the constant for docking).
