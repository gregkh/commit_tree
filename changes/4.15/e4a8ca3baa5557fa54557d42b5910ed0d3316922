/proc/module: fix building without kallsyms

As reported by kernelci and other build bots, we now get a link
failure without CONFIG_KALLSYMS:

  module.c:(.text+0xf2c): undefined reference to `kallsyms_show_value'

This adds a dummy helper with the same name that can be used
for compilation. It's not entirely clear to me what this
should return for !CONFIG_KALLSYMS, I picked an unconditional
'false', which leads to the module address being unavailable
to user space.
