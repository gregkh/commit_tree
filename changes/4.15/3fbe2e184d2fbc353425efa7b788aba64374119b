drm: Remove obsolete "This is gross" comment

Remove obsolete comment which was initially added in 2008 to annotate
that idr_find() was used before idr_remove() since idr_remove() didn't
use to return feedback. The comment now is irrelevant with
commit f6cd7daecff5 ("drm: Release driver references to handle before
making it available again").
