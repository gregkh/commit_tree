media: atomisp: fix ident for assert/return

On lots of places, assert/return are starting at the first
column, causing indentation issues, as complained by spatch:

drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/atomisp2/css2400/hive_isp_css_common/host/irq_private.h:32 irq_reg_store() warn: inconsistent indenting

Used this small script to fix such occurrences:

for i in $(git grep -l -E "^(assert|return)" drivers/staging/media/); do perl -ne 's/^(assert|return)\b/\t$1/; print $_' <$i >a && mv a $i; done
