pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7795: Add I2C pin support

Since pinmuxing for I2C is equal on H3 ES1.0 and later versions, copy
the I2C settings from ES1.0. Fixes this error in upstream for
Salvator-XS:

sh-pfc e6060000.pin-controller: function 'i2c2' not supported
sh-pfc e6060000.pin-controller: invalid function i2c2 in map table
i2c-rcar: probe of e6510000.i2c failed with error -22

Now, the bus works the same as with other Salvator boards.
