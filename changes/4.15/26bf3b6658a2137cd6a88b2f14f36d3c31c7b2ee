ata: ceva: Correct the suspend and resume logic for SATA

The present suspend code disables the port interrupts
and stops the HBA. On resume it enables the interrupts and HBA.
This works fine until the FPD power domain is not off.
If FPD is off then the ceva vendor specific configurations like
OOB, AXI settings are lost, they need to be re-programmed and
also since SERDES is also in FPD , SATA lane phy init needs to
be called again (which is not happening in the present sequence)
Because of this incorrect sequence SATA fails to work on resume.

This patch corrects the code to make Suspend & Resume work in normal
and FPD off cases.
