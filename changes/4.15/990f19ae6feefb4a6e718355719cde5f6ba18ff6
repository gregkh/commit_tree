cxl: Dump PSL_FIR register on PSL9 error irq

For PSL9 currently we aren't dumping the PSL FIR register when a
PSL error interrupt is triggered. Contents of this register are useful
in debugging AFU issues.

This patch fixes issue by adding a new service_layer_ops callback
cxl_native_err_irq_dump_regs_psl9() to dump the PSL_FIR registers on a
PSL error interrupt thereby bringing the behavior in line with PSL on
POWER-8. Also the existing service_layer_ops callback
for PSL8 has been renamed to cxl_native_err_irq_dump_regs_psl8().
