i2c-cht-wc: Add device-properties for fusb302 integration

Add device-properties to make the bq24292i charger connected to
the bus get its input-current-limit from the fusb302 Type-C port
controller which is used on boards with the cht-wc PMIC,
as well as regulator_init_data for the 5V boost converter on
the bq24292i.

Since this means we now hook-up the bq24292i to the fusb302 Type-C port
controller add a check for the ACPI device which instantiates the fusb302.
