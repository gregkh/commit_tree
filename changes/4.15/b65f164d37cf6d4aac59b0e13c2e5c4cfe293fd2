ipv6: let trace_fib6_table_lookup() dereference the fib table

The perf traces for ipv6 routing code show a relevant cost around
trace_fib6_table_lookup(), even if no trace is enabled. This is
due to the fib6_table de-referencing currently performed by the
caller.

Let's the tracing code pay this overhead, passing to the trace
helper the table pointer. This gives small but measurable
performance improvement under UDP flood.
