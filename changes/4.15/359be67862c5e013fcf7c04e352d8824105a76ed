dma mapping : export caller to vmallocinfo

For example on arm64 board, this add info to "user" entries in vmallocinfo

Before :
[...]
0xffffff8008997000 0xffffff80089d8000 266240 user
[...]

Afer :
[...]
0xffffff8008997000 0xffffff80089d8000 266240 atomic_pool_init+0x0/0x1d8 user
[...]

This help to debug mapping issues, and is consistent with others entries
(ioremap, vmalloc, ...) that already provide caller.
