powerpc/pseries/vio: Dispose of virq mapping on vdevice unregister

When a vdevice is DLPAR removed from the system the vio subsystem
doesn't bother unmapping the virq from the irq_domain. As a result we
have a virq mapped to a hardware irq that is no longer valid for the
irq_domain. A side effect is that we are left with /proc/irq/<irq#>
affinity entries, and attempts to modify the smp_affinity of the irq
will fail.

In the following observed example the kernel log is spammed by
ics_rtas_set_affinity errors after the removal of a VSCSI adapter.
This is a result of irqbalance trying to adjust the affinity every 10
seconds.

  rpadlpar_io: slot U8408.E8E.10A7ACV-V5-C25 removed
  ics_rtas_set_affinity: ibm,set-xive irq=655385 returns -3
  ics_rtas_set_affinity: ibm,set-xive irq=655385 returns -3

This patch fixes the issue by calling irq_dispose_mapping() on the
virq of the viodev on unregister.
