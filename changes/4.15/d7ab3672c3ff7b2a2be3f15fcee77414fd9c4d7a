mm, page_alloc: fail has_unmovable_pages when seeing reserved pages

Reserved pages should be completely ignored by the core mm because they
have a special meaning for their owners.  has_unmovable_pages doesn't
check those so we rely on other tests (reference count, or PageLRU) to
fail on such pages.  Althought this happens to work it is safer to
simply check for those explicitly and do not rely on the owner of the
page to abuse those fields for special purposes.

Please note that this is more of a further fortification of the code
rahter than a fix of an existing issue.
