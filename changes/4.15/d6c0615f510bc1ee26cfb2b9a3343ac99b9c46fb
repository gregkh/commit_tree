ALSA: hda - Fix yet remaining issue with vmaster 0dB initialization

The previous fix for addressing the breakage in vmaster slave
initialization, commit a91d66129fb9 ("ALSA: hda - Fix incorrect TLV
callback check introduced during set_fs() removal"), introduced a new
helper to process over each slave kctl.  However, this helper passes
only the original kctl, not the virtual slave kctl.  As a result,
HD-audio driver (which is the only user so far) couldn't initialize
the slave correctly because it's trying to update the value directly
with the original kctl, not with the mapped kctl.

This patch fixes the situation again by passing both the mapped slaved
and original slave kctls to the function.  Luckily there is a single
caller as of now, so changing the call signature is no big matter.
