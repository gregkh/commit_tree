adding missing rcu_read_unlock in ipxip6_rcv

commit 8d79266bc48c ("ip6_tunnel: add collect_md mode to IPv6 tunnels")
introduced new exit point in  ipxip6_rcv. however rcu_read_unlock is
missing there. this diff is fixing this

v1->v2:
 instead of doing rcu_read_unlock in place, we are going to "drop"
 section (to prevent skb leakage)
