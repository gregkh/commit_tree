Ib/hfi1: Return actual operational VLs in port info query

__subn_get_opa_portinfo stores value returned by hfi1_get_ib_cfg() as
operational vls. hfi1_get_ib_cfg() returns vls_operational field in
hfi1_pportdata. The problem with this is that the value is always equal
to vls_supported field in hfi1_pportdata.

The logic to calculate operational_vls is to set value passed by FM
(in  __subn_set_opa_portinfo routine). If no value is passed then
default value is stored in operational_vls.

Field actual_vls_operational is calculated on the basis of buffer
control table. Hence, modifying hfi1_get_ib_cfg() to return
actual_operational_vls when used with HFI1_IB_CFG_OP_VLS parameter
