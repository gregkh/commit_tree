ARM: dts: at91: disable the nxp,se97b SMBUS timeout on the TSE-850

The I2C adapter driver is sometimes slow, causing the SCL line to
be stuck low for more than the stipulated SMBUS timeout of 25-35 ms.
This causes the client device to give up which in turn causes silent
corruption of data. So, disable the SMBUS timeout in the client device.
