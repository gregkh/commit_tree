gpiolib: don't allow OPEN_DRAIN & OPEN_SOURCE flags for input

OPEN_DRAIN and OPEN_SOURCE flags only affect the way we drive a GPIO
line, so they only make sense for output mode. Just as we only allow
input mode for event handle requests, don't allow passing open-drain
and open-source flags for any other mode than explicit output.
