thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: fix initialization sequence for H3 ES2.0

The initialization sequence for H3 (r8a7795) ES1.x and ES2.0 is
different. H3 ES2.0 and later uses the same sequence as M3 (r8a7796)
ES1.0. Fix this by not looking at compatible strings and instead
defaulting to the r8a7796 initialization sequence and use
soc_device_match() to check for H3 ES1.x.
