x86/entry/32: Pull the MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_CS update code out of native_load_sp0()

This causes the MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_CS write to move out of the
paravirt callback.  This shouldn't affect Xen PV: Xen already ignores
MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP writes.  In any event, Xen doesn't support
vm86() in a useful way.

Note to any potential backporters: This patch won't break lguest, as
lguest didn't have any SYSENTER support at all.
