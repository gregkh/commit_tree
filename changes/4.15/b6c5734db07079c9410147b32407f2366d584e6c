sctp: fix the handling of ICMP Frag Needed for too small MTUs

syzbot reported a hang involving SCTP, on which it kept flooding dmesg
with the message:
[  246.742374] sctp: sctp_transport_update_pmtu: Reported pmtu 508 too
low, using default minimum of 512

That happened because whenever SCTP hits an ICMP Frag Needed, it tries
to adjust to the new MTU and triggers an immediate retransmission. But
it didn't consider the fact that MTUs smaller than the SCTP minimum MTU
allowed (512) would not cause the PMTU to change, and issued the
retransmission anyway (thus leading to another ICMP Frag Needed, and so
on).

As IPv4 (ip_rt_min_pmtu=556) and IPv6 (IPV6_MIN_MTU=1280) minimum MTU
are higher than that, sctp_transport_update_pmtu() is changed to
re-fetch the PMTU that got set after our request, and with that, detect
if there was an actual change or not.

The fix, thus, skips the immediate retransmission if the received ICMP
resulted in no change, in the hope that SCTP will select another path.

Note: The value being used for the minimum MTU (512,
SCTP_DEFAULT_MINSEGMENT) is not right and instead it should be (576,
SCTP_MIN_PMTU), but such change belongs to another patch.

Changes from v1:
- do not disable PMTU discovery, in the light of commit
06ad391919b2 ("[SCTP] Don't disable PMTU discovery when mtu is small")
and as suggested by Xin Long.
- changed the way to break the rtx loop by detecting if the icmp
  resulted in a change or not
Changes from v2:
none
