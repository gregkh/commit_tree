mm/page-writeback.c: make changes of dirty_writeback_centisecs take effect immediately

This patch is the followup of the prvious patch:
[writeback: schedule periodic writeback with sysctl].

There's another issue to fix.
For example,
- When the tunable was set to one hour and is reset to one second, the
  new setting will not take effect for up to one hour.

Kicking the flusher threads immediately fixes it.
