blk-mq: put the driver tag of nxt rq before first one is requeued

When freeing the driver tag of the next rq with an I/O scheduler
configured, we get the first entry of the list. However, this can
race with requeue of a request, and we end up getting the wrong request
from the head of the list. Free the driver tag of next rq before the
failed one is requeued in the failure branch of queue_rq callback.
