ACPI / PM: Combine device suspend routines

On top of a previous change getting rid of the PM QoS flag
PM_QOS_FLAG_REMOTE_WAKEUP, combine two ACPI device suspend routines,
acpi_dev_runtime_suspend() and acpi_dev_suspend_late(), into one,
acpi_dev_suspend(), to eliminate some code duplication.

It also avoids enabling wakeup for devices handled by the ACPI
LPSS middle layer on driver removal.
