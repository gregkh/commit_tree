writeback: pass in '0' for nr_pages writeback in laptop mode

Laptop mode really wants to writeback the number of dirty
pages and inodes. Instead of calculating this in the caller,
just pass in 0 and let wakeup_flusher_threads() handle it.

Use the new wakeup_flusher_threads_bdi() instead of rolling
our own.
