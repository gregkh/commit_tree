media: fix media Kconfig help syntax issues

The help text should be indented by at least two spaces after the
'help' separator. This is both good practice and the media_build system
for building media drivers makes this assumption.

I went through all Kconfigs under drivers/media and fixed any bad help
sections. This makes it conform to the common practice and should fix
problems with 'make menuconfig' when using media_build. This is due to
a "WARNING" message that media_build can insert in the Kconfig and that
assumes the help text is indented by at least two spaces. If not, then the
Kconfig becomes invalid and 'make menuconfig' fails.
