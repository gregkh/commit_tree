MIPS: Fix odd fp register warnings with MIPS64r2

Building 32-bit MIPS64r2 kernels produces warnings like the following
on certain toolchains (such as GNU assembler 2.24.90, but not GNU
assembler 2.28.51) since commit 22b8ba765a72 ("MIPS: Fix MIPS64 FP
save/restore on 32-bit kernels"), due to the exposure of fpu_save_16odd
from fpu_save_double and fpu_restore_16odd from fpu_restore_double:

arch/mips/kernel/r4k_fpu.S:47: Warning: float register should be even, was 1
...
arch/mips/kernel/r4k_fpu.S:59: Warning: float register should be even, was 1
...

This appears to be because .set mips64r2 does not change the FPU ABI to
64-bit when -march=mips64r2 (or e.g. -march=xlp) is provided on the
command line on that toolchain, from the default FPU ABI of 32-bit due
to the -mabi=32. This makes access to the odd FPU registers invalid.

Fix by explicitly changing the FPU ABI with .set fp=64 directives in
fpu_save_16odd and fpu_restore_16odd, and moving the undefine of fp up
in asmmacro.h so fp doesn't turn into $30.
