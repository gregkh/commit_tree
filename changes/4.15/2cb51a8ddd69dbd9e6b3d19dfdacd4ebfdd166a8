ARM: dts: meson: add the efuse node

Meson6, Meson8 and Meson8b use a similar IP block which has access to
512 bytes of efuse data.
During SoC manufacturing some calibration settings for the CVBS
connector and the internal temperature sensor are written to this efuse.
On some boards it additionally stores for example the MAC addresses.

The efuse is enabled on Meson8 and Meson8b but kept disabled on Meson6
since we do not have a clock driver there (which is required to read
data from the efuse).
