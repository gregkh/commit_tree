MIPS: AR7: ensure the port type's FCR value is used

Since commit aef9a7bd9b67 ("serial/uart/8250: Add tunable RX interrupt
trigger I/F of FIFO buffers"), the port's default FCR value isn't used
in serial8250_do_set_termios anymore, but copied over once in
serial8250_config_port and then modified as needed.

Unfortunately, serial8250_config_port will never be called if the port
is shared between kernel and userspace, and the port's flag doesn't have
UPF_BOOT_AUTOCONF, which would trigger a serial8250_config_port as well.

This causes garbled output from userspace:

[    5.220000] random: procd urandom read with 49 bits of entropy available
ers
   [kee

Fix this by forcing it to be configured on boot, resulting in the
expected output:

[    5.250000] random: procd urandom read with 50 bits of entropy available
Press the [f] key and hit [enter] to enter failsafe mode
Press the [1], [2], [3] or [4] key and hit [enter] to select the debug level
