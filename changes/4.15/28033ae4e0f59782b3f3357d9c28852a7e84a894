net: netlink: Update attr validation to require exact length for some types

Attributes using NLA_U* and NLA_S* (where * is 8, 16,32 and 64) are
expected to be an exact length. Split these data types from
nla_attr_minlen into nla_attr_len and update validate_nla to require
the attribute to have exact length for them.
