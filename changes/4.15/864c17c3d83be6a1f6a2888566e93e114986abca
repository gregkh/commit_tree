s390/qeth: try harder to get packets from RX buffer

Current code bails out when two subsequent buffer elements hold
insufficient data to contain a qeth_hdr packet descriptor.
This seems reasonable, but it would be legal for quirky hardware to
leave a few elements empty and then present packets in a subsequent
element. These packets would currently be dropped.

So make sure to check all buffer elements, until we hit the LAST_ENTRY
indication.
