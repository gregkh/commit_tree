drm/i915: Remove WA_(SET|CLR)_BIT

These macros are of dubious merit when coupled with the per-context w/a
set. Instead of tweaking the value in the context, they tweak the value
based on the mmio at the time of recording; they are almost by
definition not per-context! Having removed the last users, remove the
macros to avoid temptation in the future.

v2: Kill WA_WRITE as well (now also unused).
