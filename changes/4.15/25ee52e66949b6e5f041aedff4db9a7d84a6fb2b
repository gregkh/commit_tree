mtd: powernv_flash: Don't treat OPAL_SUCCESS as an error

While this driver expects to interact asynchronously, OPAL is well
within its rights to return OPAL_SUCCESS to indicate that the operation
completed without the need for a callback. We shouldn't treat
OPAL_SUCCESS as an error rather we should wrap up and return promptly to
the caller.
