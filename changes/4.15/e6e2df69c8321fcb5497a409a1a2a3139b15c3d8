soc/fsl/qbman: Rework portal mapping calls for ARM/PPC

Rework portal mapping for PPC and ARM. The PPC devices require a
cacheable coherent mapping while ARM will work with a non-cachable/write
combine mapping. This also eliminates the need for manual cache
flushes on ARM. This also fixes the code so sparse checking is clean.
