IB/hfi1: Prevent LNI out of sync by resetting host interface version

When the link is disabled and re-enabled, the host version bit is not
set again, so the firmware behaves as though itâ€™s interacting with an
old driver. This causes LNI to get out of sync. The host version bit
needs to be set at load_8051_firmware() and _dc_start(). Currently, it's
only set at load_8051_firmware().

Create a common function to set the bit with the intent to make the code
more maintainable in the future, set the host version bit at _dc_start()
and modify the 8051 command API to prevent a deadlock as _dc_start() is
already holding the dc8051 lock.
