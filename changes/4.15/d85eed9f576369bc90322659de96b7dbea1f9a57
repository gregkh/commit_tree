iio: adc: meson-saradc: initialize the bandgap correctly on older SoCs

Meson8 and Meson8b do not have the MESON_SAR_ADC_REG11 register. The
bandgap setting for these SoCs is configured in the
MESON_SAR_ADC_DELTA_10 register instead.
Make the driver aware of this difference and use the correct bandgap
register depending on the SoC.
This has worked fine on Meson8 and Meson8b because the bootloader is
already initializing the bandgap setting.
