tun: enable NAPI for TUN/TAP driver

Changes TUN driver to use napi_gro_receive() upon receiving packets
rather than netif_rx_ni(). Adds flag IFF_NAPI that enables these
changes and operation is not affected if the flag is disabled.  SKBs
are constructed upon packet arrival and are queued to be processed
later.

The new path was evaluated with a benchmark with the following setup:
Open two tap devices and a receiver thread that reads in a loop for
each device. Start one sender thread and pin all threads to different
CPUs. Send 1M minimum UDP packets to each device and measure sending
time for each of the sending methods:
	napi_gro_receive():	4.90s
	netif_rx_ni():		4.90s
	netif_receive_skb():	7.20s
