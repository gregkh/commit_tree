net_sched: use explicit size of struct tcmsg, remove need to declare tcm

Pointer tcm is being initialized and is never read, it is only being used
to determine the size of struct tcmsg.  Clean this up by removing
variable tcm and explicitly using the sizeof struct tcmsg rather than *tcm.
Cleans up clang warning:

warning: Value stored to 'tcm' during its initialization is never read
