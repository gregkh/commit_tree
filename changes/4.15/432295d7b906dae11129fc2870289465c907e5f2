drm/i915: Assert the context is not closed on object-close

During the context-close, we should be decoupling all the vma from the
object so that upon object-closing we shouldn't see any vma from the
already closed contexts. So include a check upon closing the object that
the context is still open.

v2: Eek, the fpriv check is required for shared objects. Double eek, BAT
passed?
