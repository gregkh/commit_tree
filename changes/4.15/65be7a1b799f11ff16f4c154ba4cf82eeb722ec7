arm64: introduce an order for exceptions

Currently SError is always masked in the kernel. To support RAS exceptions
using SError on hardware with the v8.2 RAS Extensions we need to unmask
SError as much as possible.

Let's define an order for masking and unmasking exceptions. 'dai' is
memorable and effectively what we have today.

Disabling debug exceptions should cause all other exceptions to be masked.
Masking SError should mask irq, but not disable debug exceptions.
Masking irqs has no side effects for other flags. Keeping to this order
makes it easier for entry.S to know which exceptions should be unmasked.

FIQ is never expected, but we mask it when we mask debug exceptions, and
unmask it at all other times.

Given masking debug exceptions masks everything, we don't need macros
to save/restore that bit independently. Remove them and switch the last
caller over to use the daif calls.
