block, bfq: move debug blkio stats behind CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP

BFQ currently creates, and updates, its own instance of the whole
set of blkio statistics that cfq creates. Yet, from the comments
of Tejun Heo in [1], it turned out that most of these statistics
are meant/useful only for debugging. This commit makes BFQ create
the latter, debugging statistics only if the option
CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is set.

By doing so, this commit also enables BFQ to enjoy a high perfomance
boost. The reason is that, if CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is not set, then
BFQ has to update far fewer statistics, and, in particular, not the
heaviest to update.  To give an idea of the benefits, if
CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP is not set, then, on an Intel i7-4850HQ, and
with 8 threads doing random I/O in parallel on null_blk (configured
with 0 latency), the throughput of BFQ grows from 310 to 400 KIOPS
(+30%). We have measured similar or even much higher boosts with other
CPUs: e.g., +45% with an ARM CortexTM-A53 Octa-core. Our results have
been obtained and can be reproduced very easily with the script in [1].
