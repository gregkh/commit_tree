KVM: s390: vsie: use common code functions for pinning

We will not see -ENOMEM (gfn_to_hva() will return KVM_ERR_PTR_BAD_PAGE
for all errors). So we can also get rid of special handling in the
callers of pin_guest_page() and always assume that it is a g2 error.

As also kvm_s390_inject_program_int() should never fail, we can
simplify pin_scb(), too.
