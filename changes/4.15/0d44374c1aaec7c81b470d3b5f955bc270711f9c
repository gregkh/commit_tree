tcmu: fix double se_cmd completion

If cmd_time_out != 0, then tcmu_queue_cmd_ring could end up
sleeping waiting for ring space, timing out and then returning
failure to lio, and tcmu_check_expired_cmd could also detect
the timeout and call target_complete_cmd on the cmd.

This patch just delays setting up the deadline value and adding
the cmd to the udev->commands idr until we have allocated ring
space and are about to send the cmd to userspace.
