mm, page_vma_mapped: Introduce pfn_in_hpage()

The new helper would check if the pfn belongs to the page. For huge
pages it checks if the PFN is within range covered by the huge page.

The helper is used in check_pte(). The original code the helper replaces
had two call to page_to_pfn(). page_to_pfn() is relatively costly.

Although current GCC is able to optimize code to have one call, it's
better to do this explicitly.
