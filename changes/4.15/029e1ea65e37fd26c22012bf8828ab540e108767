samples/pktgen: add script pktgen_sample06_numa_awared_queue_irq_affinity.sh

This script simply does:

* Detect $DEV's NUMA node belonging.

* Bind each thread (processor of NUMA locality) with each $DEV queue's
  irq affinity, 1:1 mapping.

* How many '-t' threads input determines how many queues will be utilized.

If '-f' designates first cpu id, then offset in the NUMA node's cpu list.

(Changes by Jesper: allow changing count from cmdline via '-n')
