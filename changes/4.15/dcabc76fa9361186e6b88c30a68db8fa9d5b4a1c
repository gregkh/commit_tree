usb: xhci: Return error when host is dead in xhci_disable_slot()

xhci_disable_slot() is a helper for disabling a slot when a device
goes away or recovers from error situations. Currently, it returns
success when it sees a dead host. This is not the right way to go.
It should return error and let the invoker know that disable slot
command was failed due to a dead host.
