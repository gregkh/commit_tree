KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Rename hpte_setup_done to mmu_ready

This renames the kvm->arch.hpte_setup_done field to mmu_ready because
we will want to use it for radix guests too -- both for setting things
up before vcpu execution, and for excluding vcpus from executing while
MMU-related things get changed, such as in future switching the MMU
from radix to HPT mode or vice-versa.

This also moves the call to kvmppc_setup_partition_table() that was
done in kvmppc_hv_setup_htab_rma() for HPT guests, and the setting
of mmu_ready, into the caller in kvmppc_vcpu_run_hv().
