xfs: abort dir/attr btree operation if btree is obviously weird

Abort an dir/attr btree operation if the attr btree has obvious problems
like loops back to the root or pointers don't point down the tree.
Found by fuzzing btree[0].before to zero in xfs/402, which livelocks on
the cycle in the attr btree.

Apply the same checks to xfs_da3_node_lookup_int.
