ARM: dts: meson8b: add reserved memory zone to fix silent freezes

So far, the stress-ng tool for instance quickly resulted in a silent
freeze of the system with no prior notice on a serial console when
running its filesystem or memory stressor classes.

Even with a panic-on-OOM and reboot-on-panic (vm.panic_on_oom=1,
kernel.panic=10) configured, the system would neither reboot nor
would the OOM killer get any chance to otherwise do its job.

The Amlogic reference source code uses a 2MB PHYS_OFFSET. With these 2MB
reserved via DT, stress-ng was able to run on an Odroid C1+ just fine for
several hours, the OOM killer was able to kill processes again and if
configured would successfully trigger a reboot of the system.
