IB/mlx4: Increase maximal message size under UD QP

Maximal message should be used as a limit to the max message payload allowed,
without the headers. The ConnectX-3 check is done against this value includes
the headers. When the payload is 4K this will cause the NIC to drop packets.

Increase maximal message to 8K as workaround, this shouldn't change current
behaviour because we continue to set the MTU to 4k.

To reproduce;
set MTU to 4296 on the corresponding interface, for example:
ifconfig eth0 mtu 4296 (both server and client)

On server:
ib_send_bw -c UD -d mlx4_0 -s 4096 -n 1000000 -i1 -m 4096

On client:
ib_send_bw -d mlx4_0 -c UD <server_ip> -s 4096 -n 1000000 -i 1 -m 4096
