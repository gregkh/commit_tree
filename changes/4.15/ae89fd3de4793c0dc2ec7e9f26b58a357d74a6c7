md: use TASK_IDLE instead of blocking signals

Hi - I submit this patch for the next merge window:

Some times ago, I made a patch f9c79bc05a2a that blocks signals around the
schedule() calls in MD. The MD subsystem needs to do an uninterruptible
sleep that is not accounted in load average - so we block signals and use
interruptible sleep.

The kernel has a special TASK_IDLE state for this purpose, so we can use
it instead of blocking signals. This patch doesn't fix any bug, it just
makes the code simpler.
