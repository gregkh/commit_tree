ila: add checksum neutral map auto

Add checksum neutral auto that performs checksum neutral mapping
without using the C-bit. This is enabled by configuration of
a mapping.

The checksum neutral function has been split into
ila_csum_do_neutral_fmt and ila_csum_do_neutral_nofmt. The former
handles the C-bit and includes it in the adjustment value. The latter
just sets the adjustment value on the locator diff only.

Added configuration for checksum neutral map aut in ila_lwt
and ila_xlat.
