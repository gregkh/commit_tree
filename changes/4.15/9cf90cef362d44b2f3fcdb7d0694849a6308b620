fsnotify: Protect bail out path of fsnotify_add_mark_locked() properly

When fsnotify_add_mark_locked() fails it cleans up the mark it was
adding. Since the mark is already visible in group's list, we should
protect update of mark->flags with mark->lock. I'm not aware of any real
issues this could cause (since we also hold group->mark_mutex) but
better be safe and obey locking rules properly.
