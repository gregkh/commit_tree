drm/i915: Disable lazy PPGTT page table optimization for vGPU

When running under virtualization (vGPU active), we must disable
the lazy PPGTT page table initialization optimization introduced by
commit 14826673247e ("drm/i915: Only initialize partially filled
pagetables").

We must do this because GVT-g makes unduly assumptions about guest
behaviour, which this optimization breaks. This results in following
looking errors in the host:

ERROR gvt: guest page write error -22, gfn 0x7ada8, pa 0x7ada89a8, var 0x6, len 1

The real fix is to not to depend on i915 driver behaviour, but instead
either rely on only the contracts that i915 has with the hardware, or
add some paravirtualization. While the real fix is en route, it won't
be finished in time for 4.15, so the best option is to disable the
optimization for now when vGPU is active to avoid breaking 4.15 guests
in existing VM environments.
