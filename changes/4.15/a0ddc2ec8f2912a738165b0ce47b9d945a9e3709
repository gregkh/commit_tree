bnxt_re: Fix incorrect usage of test_bit()

test_bit() takes a bit number while the 'flags' field in
struct bnxt_qplib_rcfw was using actual BIT position converted
values.
Fix this by assigning bit numbers and use consistent APIs
all the flag values.
Also logging a message in case of failure.

Thanks to Dan Carpenter for pointing this out.
