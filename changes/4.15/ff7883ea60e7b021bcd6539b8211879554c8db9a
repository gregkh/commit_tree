net: ipv6: Make inet6addr_validator a blocking notifier

inet6addr_validator chain was added by commit 3ad7d2468f79f ("Ipvlan
should return an error when an address is already in use") to allow
address validation before changes are committed and to be able to
fail the address change with an error back to the user. The address
validation is not done for addresses received from router
advertisements.

Handling RAs in softirq context is the only reason for the notifier
chain to be atomic versus blocking. Since the only current user, ipvlan,
of the validator chain ignores softirq context, the notifier can be made
blocking and simply not invoked for softirq path.

The blocking option is needed by spectrum for example to validate
resources for an adding an address to an interface.
