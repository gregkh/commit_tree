drm/plane: Make framebuffer refcounting the responsibility of setplane_internal callers

lock_all_ctx in setplane_internal may return -EINTR, and
__setplane_internal could return -EDEADLK. Making more
special cases for fb would make the code even harder to
read, so the easiest solution is not taking over the fb
refcount, and making callers responsible for dropping
the ref.
