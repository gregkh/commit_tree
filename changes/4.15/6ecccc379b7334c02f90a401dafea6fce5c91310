[media] media: lirc_dev: introduce lirc_allocate_device and lirc_free_device

Introduce two new functions so that the API for lirc_dev matches that
of the rc-core and input subsystems.

This means that lirc_dev structs are managed using the usual four
functions:

lirc_allocate_device
lirc_free_device
lirc_register_device
lirc_unregister_device

The functions are pretty simplistic at this point, later patches will put
more flesh on the bones of both.
