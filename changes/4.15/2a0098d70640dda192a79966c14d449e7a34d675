objtool: Fix seg fault with gold linker

Objtool segfaults when the gold linker is used with
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y and CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC=y.

With CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y, the .o file gets passed to the linker before
being passed to objtool.  The gold linker seems to strip unused ELF
symbols by default, which confuses objtool and causes the seg fault when
it's trying to generate ORC metadata.

Objtool should really be running immediately after GCC anyway, without a
linker call in between.  Change the makefile ordering so that objtool is
called before the linker.
