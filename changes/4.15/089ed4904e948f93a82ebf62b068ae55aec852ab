usb: xhci: Remove xhci->mutex from xhci_alloc_dev()

xhci->mutex was added in xhci_alloc_dev()  to protect two race sources
(xhci->slot_id and xhci->addr_dev) by commit a00918d0521d ("usb: host:
xhci: add mutex for non-thread-safe data").

While xhci->slot_id has been discarded in commit c2d3d49bba08 ("usb:
xhci: move slot_id from xhci_hcd to xhci_command structure"), and
xhci->addr_dev has been removed in commit 87e44f2aac8d ("usb: xhci:
remove the use of xhci->addr_dev"), it's now safe to remove the use of
xhci->mutex in xhci_alloc_dev().
