fs/9p: Compare qid.path in v9fs_test_inode

Commit fd2421f54423 ("fs/9p: When doing inode lookup compare qid details
and inode mode bits.") transformed v9fs_qid_iget() to use iget5_locked()
instead of iget_locked(). However, the test() callback is not checking
fid.path at all, which means that a lookup in the inode cache can now
accidentally locate a completely wrong inode from the same inode hash
bucket if the other fields (qid.type and qid.version) match.

Fixes: fd2421f54423 ("fs/9p: When doing inode lookup compare qid details and inode mode bits.")
