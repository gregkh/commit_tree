btrfs: Add sanity check for EXTENT_DATA when reading out leaf

Add extra checks for item with EXTENT_DATA type.  This checks the
following thing:

0) Key offset
   All key offsets must be aligned to sectorsize.
   Inline extent must have 0 for key offset.

1) Item size
   Uncompressed inline file extent size must match item size.
   (Compressed inline file extent has no information about its on-disk size.)
   Regular/preallocated file extent size must be a fixed value.

2) Every member of regular file extent item
   Including alignment for bytenr and offset, possible value for
   compression/encryption/type.

3) Type/compression/encode must be one of the valid values.

This should be the most comprehensive and strict check in the context
of btrfs_item for EXTENT_DATA.

  BTRFS_COMPRESS_TYPES does ]
