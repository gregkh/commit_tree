drm/tilcdc: tilcdc_tfp410: make of_device_ids const.

of_device_ids are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with of_device_ids provided by <linux/of.h> work with const
of_device_ids. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size after constify:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   1880	    176	      0	   2056	    808	drivers/gpu/drm/tilcdc/tilcdc_tfp410.o
