kvm: vmx: Scrub hardware GPRs at VM-exit

Guest GPR values are live in the hardware GPRs at VM-exit.  Do not
leave any guest values in hardware GPRs after the guest GPR values are
saved to the vcpu_vmx structure.

This is a partial mitigation for CVE 2017-5715 and CVE 2017-5753.
Specifically, it defeats the Project Zero PoC for CVE 2017-5715.
