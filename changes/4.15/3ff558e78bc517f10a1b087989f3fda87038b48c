drm/stm: fix warning about multiplication in condition

gcc-7 complains about multiplying within a condition being
suspicious:

drivers/gpu/drm/stm/dw_mipi_dsi-stm.c: In function 'dsi_pll_get_clkout_khz':
drivers/gpu/drm/stm/dw_mipi_dsi-stm.c:117:10: error: '*' in boolean context, suggest '&&' instead [-Werror=int-in-bool-context]

The code here is correct, but can be easily rephrased to make
that more obvious. I also swap out the error handling and the normal
code path for clarity.

Fixes: b0f09a3c69d9 ("drm/stm: Add STM32 DSI controller driver")
