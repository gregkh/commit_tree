drm/amd/display: check plane state before validating fbc

While validation fbc, array_mode of the pipe is accessed
without checking plane_state exists for it.
Causing to null pointer dereferencing followed by
reboot when a crtc associated with external display(not
connected) is page flipped.

This patch adds a check for plane_state before using
it to validate fbc.
