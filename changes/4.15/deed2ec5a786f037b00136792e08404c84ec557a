powerpc/configs: Enable I2C_CHARDEV for pseries and powernv

i2c-dev provides an interface for userspace programs to interact with I2C
devices, and is very helpful for I2C-related debugging.

Enable it in pseries_defconfig and powernv_defconfig. It's already enabled
in many other powerpc defconfigs.
