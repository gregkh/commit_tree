ASoC: sun8i-codec: Fix left and right channels inversion

Since its introduction, the codec had an inversion of the left and right
channels. It turned out to be pretty simple as it appears that the codec
doesn't have the same polarity on the LRCK signal than the I2S block.

Fix this by inverting our bit value for the LRCK inversion.
