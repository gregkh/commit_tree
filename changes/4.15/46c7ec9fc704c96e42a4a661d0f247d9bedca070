ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabresd: Use the 'vpcie-supply' property

Since commit c26ebe98a103 ("PCI: imx6: Add regulator support"), it is
possible to pass the 'vpcie-supply' property to describe the PCIE supply.

This way we can remove the 'regulator-always-on' property from the
regulator and have a better device tree description.
