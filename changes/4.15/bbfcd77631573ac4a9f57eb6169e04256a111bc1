ipv6: Do not consider linkdown nexthops during multipath

When the 'ignore_routes_with_linkdown' sysctl is set, we should not
consider linkdown nexthops during route lookup.

While the code correctly verifies that the initially selected route
('match') has a carrier, it does not perform the same check in the
subsequent multipath selection, resulting in a potential packet loss.

In case the chosen route does not have a carrier and the sysctl is set,
choose the initially selected route.
