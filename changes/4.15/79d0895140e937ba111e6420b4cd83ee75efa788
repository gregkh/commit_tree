sctp: fix error path in sctp_stream_init

syzbot noticed a NULL pointer dereference panic in sctp_stream_free()
which was caused by an incomplete error handling in sctp_stream_init().
By not clearing stream->outcnt, it made a for() in sctp_stream_free()
think that it had elements to free, but not, leading to the panic.

As suggested by Xin Long, this patch also simplifies the error path by
moving it to the only if() that uses it.
