[media] media: ov13858: Fix 4224x3136 video flickering at some vblanks

Previously, with crop (0, 0), (4255, 3167), VTS < 0xC9E was resulting in
blank frames sometimes. This appeared as video flickering. But we need VTS
< 0xC9E to get ~30fps.

Omni Vision recommends to use crop (0,8), (4255, 3159) for 4224x3136. With
this crop, VTS 0xC8E is supported and yields ~30fps.
