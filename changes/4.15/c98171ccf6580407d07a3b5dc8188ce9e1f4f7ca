drm/amdgpu: Handle GPUVM fault storms

When many wavefronts cause VM faults at the same time, it can
overwhelm the interrupt handler and cause IH ring overflows before
the driver can notify or kill the faulting application.

As a workaround I'm introducing limited per-VM fault credit. After
that number of VM faults have occurred, further VM faults are
filtered out at the prescreen stage of processing.

This depends on the PASID in the interrupt packet, so it currently
only works for KFD contexts.
