mlxsw: spectrum_router: Don't log an error on missing neighbor

Driver periodically samples all neighbors configured in device
in order to update the kernel regarding their state. When finding
an entry configured in HW that doesn't show in neigh_lookup()
driver logs an error message.
This introduces a race when removing multiple neighbors -
it's possible that a given entry would still be configured in HW
as its removal is still being processed but is already removed
from the kernel's neighbor tables.

Simply remove the error message and gracefully accept such events.

Fixes: 60f040ca11b9 ("mlxsw: spectrum_router: Periodically dump active IPv6 neighbours")
