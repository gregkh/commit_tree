drm/i915/lrc: Skip no-op per-bb buffer on gen9

Since we inherited the context image setup from gen8 which needed a
per-bb workaround (for GPGPU), we are submitting an empty per-bb buffer
on gen9. Now that we can skip adding the buffer to the context image,
remove the dangling per-bb. This slightly improves execution latency,
most notably on an idle engine.
