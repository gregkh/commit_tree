x86/kasan: Use the same shadow offset for 4- and 5-level paging

We are going to support boot-time switching between 4- and 5-level
paging. For KASAN it means we cannot have different KASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET
for different paging modes: the constant is passed to gcc to generate
code and cannot be changed at runtime.

This patch changes KASAN code to use 0xdffffc0000000000 as shadow offset
for both 4- and 5-level paging.

For 5-level paging it means that shadow memory region is not aligned to
PGD boundary anymore and we have to handle unaligned parts of the region
properly.

In addition, we have to exclude paravirt code from KASAN instrumentation
as we now use set_pgd() before KASAN is fully ready.
