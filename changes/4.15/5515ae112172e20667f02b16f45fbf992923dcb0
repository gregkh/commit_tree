i2c: xlp9xx: Handle I2C_M_RECV_LEN in msg->flags

The driver needs to handle the flag I2C_M_RECV_LEN during receive to
support SMBus emulation.

Update receive logic to handle the case where the length is received
as the first byte of a transaction.

Also update the code to handle I2C_CLIENT_PEC, which is set when the
client sends a packet error checking code byte.
