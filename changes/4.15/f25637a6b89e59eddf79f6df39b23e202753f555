regmap: Add a config option for hwspinlock

Unlike other lock types hwspinlocks are optional and can be built
modular so we can't use them unconditionally in regmap so add a config
option that drivers that want to use hwspinlocks with regmap can select
which will ensure that hwspinlock is built in.
