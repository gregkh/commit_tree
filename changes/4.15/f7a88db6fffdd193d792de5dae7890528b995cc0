ASoC: Intel: fix Kconfig dependencies

I ran into multiple problems during randconfig builds of the
recently changed Kconfig logic for Intel ASoC drivers:

- Building without DMADEVICES doesn't work in general
- With that dependency added, we can relax the 'depends
  on X86' again and allow compile-testing, except for
  SND_SST_ATOM_HIFI2_PLATFORM, which depends on X86
  for asm/platform_sst_audio.h
- Skylake requires SND_SOC_INTEL_SST_ACPI, so we
  have to depend on ACPI in turn
- Haswell needs SND_DMA_SGBUF for snd_sgbuf_aligned_pages()

With the new set of dependencies, I no longer get any build
failures.
