drm/i915: Kill off the BXT buf_trans default_index

default_index contained in the BXT buf_trans tables is actually useless.
For DP we should always have a valid level selected (otherwise the link
training logic would be buggy), and for HDMI we can just do what the
other platforms do and pick the correct entry in intel_ddi_hdmi_level().
