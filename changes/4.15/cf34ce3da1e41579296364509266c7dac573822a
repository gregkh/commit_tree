tcp: add tracepoint trace_tcp_retransmit_synack()

This tracepoint can be used to trace synack retransmits. It maintains
pointer to struct request_sock.

We cannot simply reuse trace_tcp_retransmit_skb() here, because the
sk here is the LISTEN socket. The IP addresses and ports should be
extracted from struct request_sock.

Note that, like many other tracepoints, this patch uses IS_ENABLED
in TP_fast_assign macro, which triggers sparse warning like:

./include/trace/events/tcp.h:274:1: error: directive in argument list
./include/trace/events/tcp.h:281:1: error: directive in argument list

However, there is no good solution to avoid these warnings. To the
best of our knowledge, these warnings are harmless.
