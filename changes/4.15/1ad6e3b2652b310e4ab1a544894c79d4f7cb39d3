documentation: Update ide-cd documentation to reflect CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE removal

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE was removed in commit 80aa31cb460d ("ide:
remove CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE config option (take 2)") but the ide-cd
documentation was not updated and still asks users to disable it,
which is misleading and involves a fruitless search.
