ibmvnic: Fix failover error path for non-fatal resets

For all non-fatal reset conditions, the hypervisor will send a failover when
we attempt to initialize the crq and the vnic client is expected to handle
that failover instead of the existing non-fatal reset. To handle this, we
need to return from init with a return code that indicates that we have hit
this case.
