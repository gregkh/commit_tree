ACPI / PM: Combine two identical device resume routines

Notice that acpi_dev_runtime_resume() and acpi_dev_resume_early() are
actually literally identical after some more-or-less recent changes,
so rename acpi_dev_runtime_resume() to acpi_dev_resume(), use it
everywhere instead of acpi_dev_resume_early() and drop the latter.
