tracing: Prevent PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES when FORTIFY_SOURCE=y

I regularly get 50 MB - 60 MB files during kernel randconfig builds.
These large files mostly contain (many repeats of; e.g., 124,594):

In file included from ../include/linux/string.h:6:0,
                 from ../include/linux/uuid.h:20,
                 from ../include/linux/mod_devicetable.h:13,
                 from ../scripts/mod/devicetable-offsets.c:3:
../include/linux/compiler.h:64:4: warning: '______f' is static but declared in inline function 'strcpy' which is not static [enabled by default]
    ______f = {     \
    ^
../include/linux/compiler.h:56:23: note: in expansion of macro '__trace_if'
                       ^
../include/linux/string.h:425:2: note: in expansion of macro 'if'
  if (p_size == (size_t)-1 && q_size == (size_t)-1)
  ^

This only happens when CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y and
CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES=y, so prevent PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES if
FORTIFY_SOURCE=y.
