mm, pagevec: remove cold parameter for pagevecs

Every pagevec_init user claims the pages being released are hot even in
cases where it is unlikely the pages are hot.  As no one cares about the
hotness of pages being released to the allocator, just ditch the
parameter.

No performance impact is expected as the overhead is marginal.  The
parameter is removed simply because it is a bit stupid to have a useless
parameter copied everywhere.
