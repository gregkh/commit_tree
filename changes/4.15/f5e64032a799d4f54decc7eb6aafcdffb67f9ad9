net: phy: fix resume handling

When a PHY has the BMCR_PDOWN bit set, it may decide to ignore writes
to other registers, or reset the registers to power-on defaults.
Micrel PHYs do this for their interrupt registers.

The current structure of phylib tries to enable interrupts before
resuming (and releasing) the BMCR_PDOWN bit.  This fails, causing
Micrel PHYs to stop working after a suspend/resume sequence if they
are using interrupts.

Fix this by ensuring that the PHY driver resume methods do not take
the phydev->lock mutex themselves, but the callers of phy_resume()
take that lock.  This then allows us to move the call to phy_resume()
before we enable interrupts in phy_start().
