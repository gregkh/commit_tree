infiniband: add MMU dependency for user_mem

The infiniband subsystem causes a link failure when the umem
driver is built on MMU-less systems:

mm/mmu_notifier.o: In function `do_mmu_notifier_register':
mmu_notifier.c:(.text+0x32): undefined reference to `mm_take_all_locks'
drivers/infiniband/core/umem.o: In function `ib_umem_get':
umem.c:(.text+0x132): undefined reference to `can_do_mlock'
drivers/infiniband/core/umem_odp.o: In function `ib_umem_odp_map_dma_pages':
umem_odp.c:(.text+0x766): undefined reference to `get_user_pages_remote'

This bug has existed for a while but only become apparent in ARM
randconfig builds when the dependency on PCI was lifted, as none
of the ARM-NOMMU targets support PCI at the moment.

We could probably get the umem driver to build by providing an
alternative implementation 'can_do_mlock()' that returns false
on NOMMU-systems, but then we'd still have a problem with the
mmu-notifiers required by CONFIG_INFINIBAND_ON_DEMAND_PAGING,
so simply forbidding umem with NOMMU seems like the simplest
workaround.
