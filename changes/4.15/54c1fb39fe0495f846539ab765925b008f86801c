X.509: fix comparisons of ->pkey_algo

->pkey_algo used to be an enum, but was changed to a string by commit
4e8ae72a75aa ("X.509: Make algo identifiers text instead of enum").  But
two comparisons were not updated.  Fix them to use strcmp().

This bug broke signature verification in certain configurations,
depending on whether the string constants were deduplicated or not.
