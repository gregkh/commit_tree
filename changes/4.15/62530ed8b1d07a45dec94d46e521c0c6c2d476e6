bio: ensure __bio_clone_fast copies bi_partno

A new field was introduced in 74d46992e0d9, bi_partno, instead of using
bdev->bd_contains and encoding the partition information in the bi_bdev
field.  __bio_clone_fast was changed to copy the disk information, but
not the partition information.  At minimum, this regressed bcache and
caused data corruption.
