ata: pata_artop: remove redundant initialization of pio

pio is initialized and the data is never read, instead it is almost
immediately being updated to a new value. Fix this by removing the
initialization.

Detected by scan-build:
"warning: Value stored to 'pio' during its initialization is never read"
