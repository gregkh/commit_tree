KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Implement KVM_DEV_ARM_ITS_CTRL_RESET

On reset we clear the valid bits of GITS_CBASER and GITS_BASER<n>.
We also clear command queue registers and free the cache (device,
collection, and lpi lists).

As we need to take the same locks as save/restore functions, we
create a vgic_its_ctrl() wrapper that handles KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_CTRL
group functions.
