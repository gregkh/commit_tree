fm10k: avoid divide by zero in rare cases when device is resetting

It is possible that under rare circumstances the device is undergoing
a reset, such as when a PFLR occurs, and the device may be transmitting
simultaneously. In this case, we might attempt to divide by zero when
finding the proper r_idx. Instead, lets read the num_tx_queues once,
and make sure it's non-zero.
