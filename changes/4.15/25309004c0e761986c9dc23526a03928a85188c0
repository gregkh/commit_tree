Input: goodix - support gt1151 touchpanel

Support was added based on Goodix GitHub repo [1]. There are two major
differences between gt1151 and currently supported devices (gt9x):
 * CONFIG_DATA register has 0x8050 address instead of 0x8047,
 * config data checksum has 16-bit width instead of 8-bit.

Also update goodix_i2c_test() function, so it reads ID register (which
has the same address for all devices) instead of CONFIG_DATA (because
its address is known only after reading ID of the device).
