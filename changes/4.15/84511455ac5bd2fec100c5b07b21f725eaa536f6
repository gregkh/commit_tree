RDMA/bnxt_re: report vlan_id and sl in qp1 recv completion

In a real RoCE v2 network it is possible to have two
Sections of network have same IP hence same gid. However
those may have different vlans. During connection resolution
it is important to report the actual vlan on which the
MAD packet was received instead of relying on other means
to resolve vlan-id. ib_find_gid_index should not be used
to resolve the vlan-id using sgid of the local system
where the packet was received.

Our device has the capability to report the actual VLAN-ID
in the GSI qp completions. Since we have the capability our
driver should move away from resolving the vlan-id with the
help of SGID at the destination port.
