net: hns3: remove a couple of redundant assignments

The assignment to kinfo is redundant as this is a duplicate of
the initialiation of kinfo a few lines earlier, so it can be
removed.  The assignment to v_tc_info is never read, so this
variable is redundant and can be removed completely. Cleans
up two clang warnings:

drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns3/hns3pf/hclge_tm.c:433:34:
warning: Value stored to 'kinfo' during its initialization is never read
drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns3/hns3pf/hclge_tm.c:775:3:
warning: Value stored to 'v_tc_info' is never read
