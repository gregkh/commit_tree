ARM: 8705/1: early_printk: use printascii() rather than printch()

With printch() the console messages are sent out one character at a time
which is agonizingly slow especially with semihosting as the whole trap
intercept, remote byte access, and system resume danse is performed for
every single character across a relatively slow remote debug connection.

Let's use printascii() to send a whole string at once. This is also going
to be more efficient, albeit to a quite lesser extent, with serial ports
as well.
