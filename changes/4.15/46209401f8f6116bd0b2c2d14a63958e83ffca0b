net: core: introduce mini_Qdisc and eliminate usage of tp->q for clsact fastpath

In sch_handle_egress and sch_handle_ingress tp->q is used only in order
to update stats. So stats and filter list are the only things that are
needed in clsact qdisc fastpath processing. Introduce new mini_Qdisc
struct to hold those items. Also, introduce a helper to swap the
mini_Qdisc structures in case filter list head changes.

This removes need for tp->q usage without added overhead.
