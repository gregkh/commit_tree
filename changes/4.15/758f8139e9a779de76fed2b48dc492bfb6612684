scsi: mpt3sas: Fix removal and addition of vSES device during host reset

For Dev Handles whose value is less than HBA's phys count number, driver
would return HBA's SAS address value. As a result, for a Virtual SES
device the driver was returning the HBA's SAS address. Updated the
driver to return Virtual SES' SAS address.
