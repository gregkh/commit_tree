bcache: writeback rate shouldn't artifically clamp

The previous code artificially limited writeback rate to 1000000
blocks/second (NSEC_PER_MSEC), which is a rate that can be met on fast
hardware.  The rate limiting code works fine (though with decreased
precision) up to 3 orders of magnitude faster, so use NSEC_PER_SEC.

Additionally, ensure that uint32_t is used as a type for rate throughout
the rate management so that type checking/clamp_t can work properly.

bch_next_delay should be rewritten for increased precision and better
handling of high rates and long sleep periods, but this is adequate for
now.
