ipv6: check fn->leaf before it is used

If rwlock is replaced with rcu and spinlock, it is possible that the
reader thread will see fn->leaf as NULL in the following scenarios:
1. fib6_add() is in progress and we have already inserted a new node but
not yet inserted the route.
2. fib6_del_route() is in progress and we have already set fn->leaf to
NULL but not yet freed the node because of rcu grace period.

This patch makes sure all the reader threads check fn->leaf first before
using it. And together with later patch to grab rcu_read_lock() and
rcu_dereference() fn->leaf, it makes sure reader threads are safe when
accessing fn->leaf.
