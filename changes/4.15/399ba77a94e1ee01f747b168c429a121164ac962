net: dsa: Simplify dsa_slave_phy_setup()

Remove the code that tried to identify if a PHY designated by Device
Tree required diversion through the DSA-created MDIO bus. This was
created mainly for the bcm_sf2.c driver back when it did not have its
own MDIO bus driver, which it now has since 461cd1b03e32 ("net: dsa:
bcm_sf2: Register our slave MDIO bus").
