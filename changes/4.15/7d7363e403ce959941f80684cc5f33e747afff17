documentation: kernel-api: add more info on bitmap functions

There are some good comments about bitmap operations in lib/bitmap.c
and include/linux/bitmap.h, so format them for document generation and
pull them into core-api/kernel-api.rst.

I converted the "tables" of functions from using tabs to using spaces
so that they are more readable in the source file and in the generated
output.
