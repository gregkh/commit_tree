s390/debug: only write data once

debug_event_common memsets the active debug entry with zeros to
prevent stale data leakage. This is overwritten with the actual
debug data in the next step. Only write zeros to that part of the
debug entry that's not used by new debug data.

Micro benchmarks show a 2-10% reduction of cpu cycles with this
approach.
