parisc: Pass endianness info to sparse

parisc is big-endian only but sparse assumes the same endianness as the
building machine.
This is problematic for code which expect __BYTE_ORDER__ being correctly
predefined by the compiler which sparse can then pre-process differently
from what gcc would.

Fix this by letting sparse know about the architecture endianness.
