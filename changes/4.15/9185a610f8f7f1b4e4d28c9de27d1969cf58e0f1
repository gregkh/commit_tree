tracing: bpf: Hide bpf trace events when they are not used

All the trace events defined in include/trace/events/bpf.h are only
used when CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL is defined. But this file gets included by
include/linux/bpf_trace.h which is included by the networking code with
CREATE_TRACE_POINTS defined.

If a trace event is created but not used it still has data structures
and functions created for its use, even though nothing is using them.
To not waste space, do not define the BPF trace events in bpf.h unless
CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL is defined.
