nfit_test: when clearing poison, also remove badrange entries

The injected badrange entries can only be cleared from the kernel's
accounting by writing to the affected blocks, so when such a write sends
the clear errror DSM to nfit_test, also clear the ranges from
nfit_test's badrange list. This lets an 'ARS Inject error status' DSM to
return the correct status, omitting the cleared ranges.
