cxl: Provide debugfs access to PSL_DEBUG/XSL_DEBUG registers

Access to PSL/XSL_DEBUG registers on the adapter provides easy access
to the debug facilities provided by PSL/XSL. So this patch adds two
new files (debug, xsl-debug) to the cxl-adapter specific debugfs
folder located at /sys/kernel/debugfs/cxl/card<n>, which will provide
direct r/w access to corrosponding debug registers in the adapter
config-space.
