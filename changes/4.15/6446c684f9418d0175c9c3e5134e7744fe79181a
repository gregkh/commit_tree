bcache: safeguard a dangerous addressing in closure_queue

The use of the union reduces the size of closure struct by taking advantage
of the current size of its members. The offset of func in work_struct
equals the size of the first three members, so that work.work_func will
just reference the forth member - fn.

This is smart but dangerous. It can be broken if work_struct or the other
structs get changed, and can be a bit difficult to debug.
