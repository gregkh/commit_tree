KVM: x86: introduce ISA specific SMM entry/exit callbacks

Entering and exiting SMM may require ISA specific handling under certain
circumstances. This commit adds two new callbacks with empty implementations.
Actual functionality will be added in following commits.

* pre_enter_smm() is to be called when injecting an SMM, before any
  SMM related vcpu state has been changed
* pre_leave_smm() is to be called when emulating the RSM instruction,
  when the vcpu is in real mode and before any SMM related vcpu state
  has been restored
