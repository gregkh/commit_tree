ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Fix jack initialization

If the ts3a227e audio accessory detection hardware is present and its
driver probed, the jack needs to be created before enabling jack
detection in the ts3a227e driver. With this patch, the jack is
instantiated in the max98090 headset init function if the ts3a227e is
present. This fixes a null pointer dereference as the jack detection
enabling function in the ts3a driver was called before the jack is
created.

[minor correction to keep error handling on jack creation the same
as before by Pierre Bossart]
