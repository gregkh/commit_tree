drm/amd/display: Fixed switching mode half screen gamma incorrect.

	Half screen gamma setting and cursor are incorrect
	when switching mode through win+p due to wrong programming
	gamma sequence (In case of bottom pipe, gamma and cursor are
	programmed before front end programmed, pipe is power gated).

	change:
	1. Cache curor attributes to stream
	2. Move set gamma and cursor inside front end
	   programming.
