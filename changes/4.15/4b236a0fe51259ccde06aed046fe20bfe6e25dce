arm: dts: sunxi: h3/h5: Restore EMAC changes

The original dwmac-sun8i DT bindings have some issue on how to handle
integrated PHY and was reverted in last RC of 4.13.
But now we have a solution so we need to get back that was reverted.

This patch restore sunxi-h3-h5.dtsi
This reverts partially commit fe45174b72ae ("arm: dts: sunxi: Revert EMAC changes")
