nvme: track shared namespaces

Introduce a new struct nvme_ns_head that holds information about an actual
namespace, unlike struct nvme_ns, which only holds the per-controller
namespace information.  For private namespaces there is a 1:1 relation of
the two, but for shared namespaces this lets us discover all the paths to
it.  For now only the identifiers are moved to the new structure, but most
of the information in struct nvme_ns should eventually move over.

To allow lockless path lookup the list of nvme_ns structures per
nvme_ns_head is protected by SRCU, which requires freeing the nvme_ns
structure through call_srcu.
