media: media/saa7146: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly. This requires adding a pointer to
hold the timer's target file, as there won't be a way to pass this in the
future.
