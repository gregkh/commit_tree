autofs: don't fail mount for transient error

Currently if the autofs kernel module gets an error when writing to the
pipe which links to the daemon, then it marks the whole moutpoint as
catatonic, and it will stop working.

It is possible that the error is transient.  This can happen if the
daemon is slow and more than 16 requests queue up.  If a subsequent
process tries to queue a request, and is then signalled, the write to
the pipe will return -ERESTARTSYS and autofs will take that as total
failure.

So change the code to assess -ERESTARTSYS and -ENOMEM as transient
failures which only abort the current request, not the whole mountpoint.

It isn't a crash or a data corruption, but having autofs mountpoints
suddenly stop working is rather inconvenient.

: consuming large amounts of CPU under heavy mount and umount activity this
: could happen more easily than we expect.
