RDMA/bnxt_re: Add memory barriers when processing CQ/EQ entries

The code determines if the next ring entry is valid before proceeding
further to read the rest of the entry. The CPU can re-order and read
the rest of the entry first, possibly reading a stale entry, if DMA
of a new entry happens right after reading it.
