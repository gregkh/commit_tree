drm/amdgpu: revert "fix deadlock of reservation between cs and gpu reset v2"

This reverts commit 10e709cb296c98424c03408d23e3addeddcd4088.

The patch doesn't work at all:
1. The CS can still be blocked because of amdgpu_ctx_add_fence().
2. The order of submission isn't correct any more.
3. We could end up using freed up memory because we now drop the
   ctx reference to early.

This needs to be fixed cleanly by doing the context handling after the BO
handling, but this is a larger task just avoid the obvious crashes for now.
