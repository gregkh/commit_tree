IB/hfi1: Eliminate allocation while atomic

The PIO trailing buffer was being dynamically allocated
but the kcalloc return value was not being checked. Further,
the GFP_KERNEL was being used even though the send engine
might be called with interrupts disabled.

Since the maximum size of the trailing buffer is only 12
bytes (CRC = 4, LT = 1, Pad = 0 to 7 bytes) just statically
allocate the buffer, remove the alloc entirely and share it
with the SDMA engine by making it global.
