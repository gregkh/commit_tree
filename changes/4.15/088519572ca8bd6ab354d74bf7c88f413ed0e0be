ext2: Parse mount options into a dedicated structure

Instead of parsing mount options directly into the superblock (and
restoring options in case of error), parse the options into a dedicated
structure and only copy everything when we know we can safely switch
options. This will allow us to simplify locking and do option parsing
without holding sb->s_lock.
