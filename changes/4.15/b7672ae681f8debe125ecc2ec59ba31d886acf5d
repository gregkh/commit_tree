scsi: lpfc: Fix crash in lpfc_nvme_fcp_io_submit during LIP

The driver is seeing a NULL pointer in lpfc_nvme_fcp_io_submit.  This
was ultimately due to a transport AER being sent on a terminated
controller, thus some of the values were not set. In case we're in a
system without a corrected transport and in case a race condition occurs
where we enter the routine as the teardown is happening in a separate
thread, validate the parameters before starting the io.
