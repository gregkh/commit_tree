irqchip/gic-v3-its: Setup VLPI properties at map time

So far, we require the hypervisor to update the VLPI properties
once the the VLPI mapping has been established. While this
makes it easy for the ITS driver, it creates a window where
an incoming interrupt can be delivered with an unknown set
of properties. Not very nice.

Instead, let's add a "properties" field to the mapping structure,
and use that to configure the VLPI before it actually gets mapped.
