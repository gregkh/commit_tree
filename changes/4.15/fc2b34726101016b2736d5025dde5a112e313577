spi-nor: intel-spi: Use SW sequencer for BYT/LPT

Baytrail/Lynx Point SPI controller's HW sequencer only supports basic
operations. This is determined by the chipset design, however current
codes try to use register values in OPMENU0/OPMENU1 to see whether SW
sequencer should be used, which is wrong. In fact OPMENU0/OPMENU1 can
remain unprogrammed by some bootloaders.
