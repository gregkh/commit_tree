netfilter: conntrack: add and use nf_l4proto_log_invalid

We currently pass down the l4 protocol to the conntrack ->packet()
function, but the only user of this is the debug info decision.

Same information can be derived from struct nf_conn.
As a first step, add and use a new log function for this, similar to
nf_ct_helper_log().

Add __cold annotation -- invalid packets should be infrequent so
gcc can consider all call paths that lead to such a function as
unlikely.
