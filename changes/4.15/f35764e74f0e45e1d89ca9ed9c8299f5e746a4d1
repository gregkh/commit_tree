MIPS: Fix undefined reference to physical_memsize

Since commit d41e6858ba58 ("MIPS: Kconfig: Set default MIPS system type
as generic") switched the default platform to the "generic" platform,
allmodconfig has been failing with the following linker error (among
other errors):

arch/mips/kernel/vpe-mt.o In function `vpe_run':
(.text+0x59c): undefined reference to `physical_memsize'

The Lantiq platform already worked around the same issue in commit
9050d50e2244 ("MIPS: lantiq: Set physical_memsize") by declaring
physical_memsize with the initial value of 0 (on the assumption that the
actual memory size will be hard-coded in the loaded VPE firmware), and
the Malta platform already provided physical_memsize.

Since all other platforms will fail to link with the VPE loader enabled,
only allow Lantiq and Malta platforms to enable it, by way of a
SYS_SUPPORTS_VPE_LOADER which is selected by those two platforms and
which MIPS_VPE_LOADER depends on. SYS_SUPPORTS_MULTITHREADING is now a
dependency of SYS_SUPPORTS_VPE_LOADER so that Kconfig emits a warning if
SYS_SUPPORTS_VPE_LOADER is selected without SYS_SUPPORTS_MULTITHREADING.
