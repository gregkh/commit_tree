sctp: set frag_point in sctp_setsockopt_maxseg correctly

Now in sctp_setsockopt_maxseg user_frag or frag_point can be set with
val >= 8 and val <= SCTP_MAX_CHUNK_LEN. But both checks are incorrect.

val >= 8 means frag_point can even be less than SCTP_DEFAULT_MINSEGMENT.
Then in sctp_datamsg_from_user(), when it's value is greater than cookie
echo len and trying to bundle with cookie echo chunk, the first_len will
overflow.

The worse case is when it's value is equal as cookie echo len, first_len
becomes 0, it will go into a dead loop for fragment later on. In Hangbin
syzkaller testing env, oom was even triggered due to consecutive memory
allocation in that loop.

Besides, SCTP_MAX_CHUNK_LEN is the max size of the whole chunk, it should
deduct the data header for frag_point or user_frag check.

This patch does a proper check with SCTP_DEFAULT_MINSEGMENT subtracting
the sctphdr and datahdr, SCTP_MAX_CHUNK_LEN subtracting datahdr when
setting frag_point via sockopt. It also improves sctp_setsockopt_maxseg
codes.
