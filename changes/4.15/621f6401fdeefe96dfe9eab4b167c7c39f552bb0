scsi: libsas: fix length error in sas_smp_handler()

The return value of smp_execute_task_sg() is the untransferred residual,
but bsg_job_done() requires the length of payload received. This makes
SMP passthrough commands from userland by sg ioctl to libsas get a wrong
response. The userland tools such as smp_utils failed because of these
wrong responses:

~#smp_discover /dev/bsg/expander-2\:13
response too short, len=0
~#smp_discover /dev/bsg/expander-2\:134
response too short, len=0

Fix this by passing the actual received length to bsg_job_done(). And if
smp_execute_task_sg() returns 0, this means received length is exactly
the buffer length.

[mkp: typo]
