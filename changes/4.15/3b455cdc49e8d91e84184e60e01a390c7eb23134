iio: adc: sun4i-gpadc-iio: do not fail probing when no thermal DT node

Before this patch, forgetting to put a thermal-zones DT node would
result in the driver failing to probe.

It should be perfectly acceptable to have the driver probe even if no
thermal-zones DT is found. However, it shouldn't want to fail if the
thermal registering fail for any other reason (waiting for other drivers
for example) so check on ENODEV only.
