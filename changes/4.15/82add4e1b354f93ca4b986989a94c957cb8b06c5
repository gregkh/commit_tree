scsi: megaraid_sas: Incorrect processing of IOCTL frames for SMP/STP commands

cmd->frame->dcmd.opcode will be valid only for MFI_CMD_DCMD
IOCTL frames. Currently driver check for cmd->frame->dcmd.opcode without
checking cmd type. Ensure we check dcmd opcode only for MFI_CMD_DCMD
commands. Separate handling of MFI_CMD_SMP/STP commands from
MFI_CMD_DCMD in completion path.
