padata: ensure the reorder timer callback runs on the correct CPU

The reorder timer function runs on the CPU where the timer interrupt was
handled which is not necessarily one of the CPUs of the 'pcpu' CPU mask
set.

Ensure the padata_reorder() callback runs on the correct CPU, which is
one in the 'pcpu' CPU mask set and, preferrably, the next expected one.
Do so by comparing the current CPU with the expected target CPU. If they
match, call padata_reorder() right away. If they differ, schedule a work
item on the target CPU that does the padata_reorder() call for us.
