openvswitch: meter: fix NULL pointer dereference in ovs_meter_cmd_reply_start

It seems that the intention of the code is to null check the value
returned by function genlmsg_put. But the current code is null
checking the address of the pointer that holds the value returned
by genlmsg_put.

Fix this by properly null checking the value returned by function
genlmsg_put in order to avoid a pontential null pointer dereference.
