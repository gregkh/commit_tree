KVM: arm/arm64: GICv4: Prevent a VM using GICv4 from being saved

The GICv4 architecture doesn't make it easy for save/restore to
work, as it doesn't give any guarantee that the pending state
is written into the pending table.

So let's not take any chance, and let's return an error if
we encounter any LPI that has the HW bit set. In order for
userspace to distinguish this error from other failure modes,
use -EACCES as an error code.
