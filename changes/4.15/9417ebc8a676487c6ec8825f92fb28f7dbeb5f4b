btrfs: Explicitly handle btrfs_update_root failure

btrfs_udpate_root can fail and it aborts the transaction, the correct
way to handle an aborted transaction is to explicitly end with
btrfs_end_transaction.  Even now the code is correct since
btrfs_commit_transaction would handle an aborted transaction but this is
more of an implementation detail. So let's be explicit in handling
failure in btrfs_update_root.

Furthermore btrfs_commit_transaction can also fail and by ignoring it's
return value we could have left the in-memory copy of the root item in
an inconsistent state. So capture the error value which allows us to
correctly revert the RO/RW flags in case of commit failure.
