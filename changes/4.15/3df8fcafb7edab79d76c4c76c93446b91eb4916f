drm/amd/display: Do not set bandwidth on page flips.

Which removes a lockdep warning for a possible deadlock situation:

While holding the drm event mutex (hard irq safe),
dc_post_update_surfaces_to_stream eventually acquires the atom context
lock, which is hard irq unsafe. We should only be calling it on full
updates anyways.

Also remove a redundant call to dc_post_update_surfaces_to_stream,
dc_commit_updates_for_stream already calls it.
