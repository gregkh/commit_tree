blk-mq: introduce .get_budget and .put_budget in blk_mq_ops

For SCSI devices, there is often a per-request-queue depth, which needs
to be respected before queuing one request.

Currently blk-mq always dequeues the request first, then calls
.queue_rq() to dispatch the request to lld. One obvious issue with this
approach is that I/O merging may not be successful, because when the
per-request-queue depth can't be respected, .queue_rq() has to return
BLK_STS_RESOURCE, and then this request has to stay in hctx->dispatch
list. This means it never gets a chance to be merged with other IO.

This patch introduces .get_budget and .put_budget callback in blk_mq_ops,
then we can try to get reserved budget first before dequeuing request.
If the budget for queueing I/O can't be satisfied, we don't need to
dequeue request at all. Hence the request can be left in the IO
scheduler queue, for more merging opportunities.
