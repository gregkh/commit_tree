libnvdimm, dimm: clear 'locked' status on successful DIMM enable

If we successfully enable a DIMM then it must not be locked and we can
clear the label-read failure condition. Otherwise, we need to reload the
entire bus provider driver to achieve the same effect, and that can
disrupt unrelated DIMMs and namespaces.
