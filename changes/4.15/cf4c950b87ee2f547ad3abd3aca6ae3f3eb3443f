once: switch to new jump label API

Switch the DO_ONCE() macro from the deprecated jump label API to the new
one.  The new one is more readable, and for DO_ONCE() it also makes the
generated code more icache-friendly: now the one-time initialization
code is placed out-of-line at the jump target, rather than at the inline
fallthrough case.
