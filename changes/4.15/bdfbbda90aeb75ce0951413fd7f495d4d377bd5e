Revert "cgroup/cpuset: remove circular dependency deadlock"

This reverts commit aa24163b2ee5c92120e32e99b5a93143a0f4258e.

This and the following commit led to another circular locking scenario
and the scenario which is fixed by this commit no longer exists after
e8b3f8db7aad ("workqueue/hotplug: simplify workqueue_offline_cpu()")
which removes work item flushing from hotplug path.

Revert it for now.
