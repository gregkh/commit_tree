{net,ib}/mlx5: Don't disable local loopback multicast traffic when needed

There are systems platform information management interfaces (such as
HOST2BMC) for which we cannot disable local loopback multicast traffic.

Separate disable_local_lb_mc and disable_local_lb_uc capability bits so
driver will not disable multicast loopback traffic if not supported.
(It is expected that Firmware will not set disable_local_lb_mc if
HOST2BMC is running for example.)

Function mlx5_nic_vport_update_local_lb will do best effort to
disable/enable UC/MC loopback traffic and return success only in case it
succeeded to changed all allowed by Firmware.

Adapt mlx5_ib and mlx5e to support the new cap bits.
