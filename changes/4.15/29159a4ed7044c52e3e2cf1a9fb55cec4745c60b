ALSA: pcm: Abort properly at pending signal in OSS read/write loops

The loops for read and write in PCM OSS emulation have no proper check
of pending signals, and they keep processing even after user tries to
break.  This results in a very long delay, often seen as RCU stall
when a huge unprocessed bytes remain queued.  The bug could be easily
triggered by syzkaller.

As a simple workaround, this patch adds the proper check of pending
signals and aborts the loop appropriately.
