ipv6: hook up exception table to store dst cache

This commit makes use of the exception hash table implementation to
store dst caches created by pmtu discovery and ip redirect into the hash
table under the rt_info and no longer inserts these routes into fib6
tree.
This makes the fib6 tree only contain static configured routes and could
now be protected by rcu instead of a rw lock.
With this change, in the route lookup related functions, after finding
the rt6_info with the longest prefix, we also need to search for the
exception table before doing backtracking.
In the route delete function, if the route being deleted is not a dst
cache, deletion of this route also need to flush the whole hash table
under it. If it is a dst cache, then only delete the cached dst in the
hash table.

Note: for fib6_walk_continue() function, w->root now is always pointing
to a root node considering that fib6_prune_clones() is removed from the
code. So we add a WARN_ON() msg to make sure w->root always points to a
root node and also removed the update of w->root in fib6_repair_tree().
This is a prerequisite for later patch because we don't need to make
w->root as rcu protected when replacing rwlock with RCU.
Also, we remove all prune related variables as it is no longer used.
