iio: adc: ti-ads1015: add 10% to conversion wait time

As user's guide "ADS1015EVM, ADS1115EVM, ADS1015EVM-PDK, ADS1115EVM-PDK
User Guide (Rev. B)" (http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/sbau157b/sbau157b.pdf)
states at page 16:
"Note that both the ADS1115 and ADS1015 have internal clocks with a Â±10%
accuracy. If performing FFT tests, frequencies may appear to be incorrect
as a result of this tolerance range.", add those 10% to converion wait
time.
