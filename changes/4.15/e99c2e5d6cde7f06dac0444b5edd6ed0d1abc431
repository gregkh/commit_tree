hwmon: (gpio-fan) Rename GPIO line state variables

The "ctrl" and "num_ctrl" entries in the state container struct is
ambiguously named "ctrl" and "num_ctrl" overlapping with some hwmon
lingo and making it hard to understand. Since this array actually
contains the GPIO line numbers, from the Linux global GPIO numberspace,
used to control the different fan speeds. Rename these fields to
"gpios" (pluralis) and "num_gpios" so as to make it unambiguous.

Convert some instances of "unsigned" to "unsigned int" to keep
checkpatch happy.
