arm64: consistently log boot/secondary CPU IDs

Currently we inconsistently log identifying information for the boot CPU
and secondary CPUs. For the boot CPU, we log the MIDR and MPIDR across
separate messages, whereas for the secondary CPUs we only log the MIDR.

In some cases, it would be useful to know the MPIDR of secondary CPUs,
and it would be nice for these messages to be consistent.

This patch ensures that in the primary and secondary boot paths, we log
both the MPIDR and MIDR in a single message, with a consistent format.
the MPIDR is consistently padded to 10 hex characters to cover Aff3 in
bits 39:32, so that IDs can be compared easily.

The newly redundant message in setup_arch() is removed.
