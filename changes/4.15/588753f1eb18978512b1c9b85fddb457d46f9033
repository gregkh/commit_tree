ipv6: icmp6: Allow icmp messages to be looped back

One example of when an ICMPv6 packet is required to be looped back is
when a host acts as both a Multicast Listener and a Multicast Router.

A Multicast Router will listen on address ff02::16 for MLDv2 messages.

Currently, MLDv2 messages originating from a Multicast Listener running
on the same host as the Multicast Router are not being delivered to the
Multicast Router. This is due to dst.input being assigned the default
value of dst_discard.

This results in the packet being looped back but discarded before being
delivered to the Multicast Router.

This patch sets dst.input to ip6_input to ensure a looped back packet
is delivered to the Multicast Router.
