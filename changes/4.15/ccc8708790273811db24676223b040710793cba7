IB/mlx5: Allow creation of a multi-packet RQ

Allow creation of a multi-packet receive queue.

In order to create a multi-packet RQ, the following fields in
the mlx5_ib_rwq should be set:
- log_num_strides: Log of number of strides per WQE
- single_stride_log_num_of_bytes: Log of a single stride size
- two_byte_shift_en: When enabled, hardware pads 2 bytes of zeros
  before writing the message to memory (e.g. for the IP alignment).
