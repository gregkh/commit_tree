powerpc/64s: Replace CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64 with CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_64

CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64 indicates support for the "standard" powerpc MMU
on 64-bit CPUs. The "standard" MMU refers to the hash page table MMU
found in "server" processors, from IBM mainly.

Currently CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64 is == CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_64. While it's
annoying to have two symbols that always have the same value, it's not
quite annoying enough to bother removing one.

However with the arrival of Power9, we now have the situation where
CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64 is enabled, but the kernel is running using the
Radix MMU - *not* the "standard" MMU. So it is now actively confusing
to use it, because it implies that code is disabled or inactive when
the Radix MMU is in use, however that is not necessarily true.

So s/CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64/CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_64/, and do some minor
formatting updates of some of the affected lines.

This will be a pain for backports, but c'est la vie.
