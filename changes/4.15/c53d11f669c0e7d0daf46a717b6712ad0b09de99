i40e: fix client notify of VF reset

Currently there is a bug in which the PF driver fails to inform clients
of a VF reset which then causes clients to leak resources.  The bug
exists because we were incorrectly checking the I40E_VF_STATE_PRE_ENABLE
bit.

When a VF is first init we go through a reset to initialize variables
and allocate resources but we don't want to inform clients of this first
reset since the client isn't fully enabled yet so we set a state bit
signifying we're in a "pre-enabled" client state.  During the first
reset we should be clearing the bit, allowing all following resets to
notify the client of the reset when the bit is not set.  This patch
fixes the issue by negating the 'test_and_clear_bit' check to accurately
reflect the behavior we want.
