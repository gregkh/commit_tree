nfp: bpf: move translation prepare to offload.c

struct nfp_prog is currently only used internally by the translator.
This means there is a lot of parameter passing going on, between
the translator and different stages of offload.  Simplify things
by allocating nfp_prog in offload.c already.

We will now use kmalloc() to allocate the program area and only
DMA map it for the time of loading (instead of allocating DMA
coherent memory upfront).
