afs: Trace the sending of pages

Add a pair of tracepoints to log the sending of pages for an FS.StoreData
or FS.StoreData64 operation.

Tracepoint afs_send_pages notes each set of pages added to the operation.
There may be several of these per operation as we get up at most 8
contiguous pages in one go because the bvec we're using is on the stack.

Tracepoint afs_sent_pages notes the end of adding data from a whole run of
pages to the operation and the completion of the request phase.
