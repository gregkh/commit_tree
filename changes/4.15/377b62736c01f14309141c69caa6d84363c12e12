e1000e: Be drop monitor friendly

e1000e_put_txbuf() can be called from normal reclamation path as well as
when a DMA mapping failure, so we need to differentiate these two cases
when freeing SKBs to be drop monitor friendly. e1000e_tx_hwtstamp_work()
and e1000_remove() are processing TX timestamped SKBs and those should
not be accounted as drops either.
