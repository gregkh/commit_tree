drm/amd/display: Remove check update type function.

Due to using dc_commit_surface_to_stream instead of build
stream and surface updates any surface commit today is
evlauted to full. Until we fix this and can corretly
evluate type of surface update, anything which is not page
flip or cursor update will be treted as full update chnage
and global lock will be aquired.
