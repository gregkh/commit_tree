locking/atomics, samples/mic/mpssd/mpssd.c: Convert ACCESS_ONCE() to READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE()

For several reasons, it is desirable to use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() in
preference to ACCESS_ONCE(), and new code is expected to use one of the
former. So far, there's been no reason to change most existing uses of
ACCESS_ONCE(), as these aren't currently harmful.

However, for some features it is necessary to instrument reads and
writes separately, which is not possible with ACCESS_ONCE(). This
distinction is critical to correct operation.

The bulk of the kernel code can be transformed via Coccinelle to use
{READ,WRITE}_ONCE(), though this only modifies users of ACCESS_ONCE(),
and not the implementation itself. As such, it has the potential to
break homebrew ACCESS_ONCE() macros seen in some user code in the kernel
tree (e.g. the virtio code, as fixed in commit ea9156fb3b71d9f7).

To avoid fragility if/when that transformation occurs, and to align with
the preferred usage of {READ,WRITE}_ONCE(), this patch updates the MPSSD
sample code to use READ_ONCE() rather than ACCESS_ONCE(). There should
be no functional change as a result of this patch.
