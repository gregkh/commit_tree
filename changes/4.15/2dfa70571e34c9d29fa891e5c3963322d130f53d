ARM: dts: aspeed-palmetto: Add I2C devices

Enable the buses that are in use and the devices that are attached.
Currently that includes the battery backed RTC, temperature measurement
and EEPROM.

Some of these buses are for hotplugged cards, such as PCIe cards.
Others do not yet have upstream drivers, so there are no devices
attached.
