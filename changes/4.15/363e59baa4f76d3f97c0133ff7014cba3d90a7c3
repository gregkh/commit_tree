xfs: don't be so eager to clear the cowblocks tag on truncate

Currently, xfs_itruncate_extents clears the cowblocks tag if i_cnextents
is zero.  This is wrong, since i_cnextents only tracks real extents in
the CoW fork, which means that we could have some delayed CoW
reservations still in there that will now never get cleaned.

Fix a further bug where we /don't/ clear the reflink iflag if there are
any attribute blocks -- really, it's only safe to clear the reflink flag
if there are no data fork extents and no cow fork extents.

Found by adding clonerange to fsstress in xfs/017.
