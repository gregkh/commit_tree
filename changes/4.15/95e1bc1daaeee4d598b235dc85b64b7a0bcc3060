powernv/opal-sensor: remove not needed lock

Parallel sensor reads could run out of async tokens due to
opal_get_sensor_data grabbing tokens but then doing the sensor
read behind a mutex, essentially serializing the (possibly
asynchronous and relatively slow) sensor read.

It turns out that the mutex isn't needed at all, not only
should the OPAL interface allow concurrent reads, the implementation
is certainly safe for that, and if any sensor we were reading
from somewhere isn't, doing the mutual exclusion in the kernel
is the wrong place to do it, OPAL should be doing it for the kernel.

So, remove the mutex.

Additionally, we shouldn't be printing out an error when we don't
get a token as the only way this should happen is if we've been
interrupted in down_interruptible() on the semaphore.
