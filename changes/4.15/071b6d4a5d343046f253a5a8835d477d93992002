arm64: fpsimd: Prevent registers leaking from dead tasks

Currently, loading of a task's fpsimd state into the CPU registers
is skipped if that task's state is already present in the registers
of that CPU.

However, the code relies on the struct fpsimd_state * (and by
extension struct task_struct *) to unambiguously identify a task.

There is a particular case in which this doesn't work reliably:
when a task exits, its task_struct may be recycled to describe a
new task.

Consider the following scenario:

 1) Task P loads its fpsimd state onto cpu C.
        per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, C) := P;
        P->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu := C;

 2) Task X is scheduled onto C and loads its fpsimd state on C.
        per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, C) := X;
        X->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu := C;

 3) X exits, causing X's task_struct to be freed.

 4) P forks a new child T, which obtains X's recycled task_struct.
	T == X.
	T->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu == C (inherited from P).

 5) T is scheduled on C.
	T's fpsimd state is not loaded, because
	per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, C) == T (== X) &&
	T->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu == C.

        (This is the check performed by fpsimd_thread_switch().)

So, T gets X's registers because the last registers loaded onto C
were those of X, in (2).

This patch fixes the problem by ensuring that the sched-in check
fails in (5): fpsimd_flush_task_state(T) is called when T is
forked, so that T->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu == C cannot be true.
This relies on the fact that T is not schedulable until after
copy_thread() completes.

Once T's fpsimd state has been loaded on some CPU C there may still
be other cpus D for which per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, D) ==
&X->thread.fpsimd_state.  But D is necessarily != C in this case,
and the check in (5) must fail.

An alternative fix would be to do refcounting on task_struct.  This
would result in each CPU holding a reference to the last task whose
fpsimd state was loaded there.  It's not clear whether this is
preferable, and it involves higher overhead than the fix proposed
in this patch.  It would also move all the task_struct freeing
work into the context switch critical section, or otherwise some
deferred cleanup mechanism would need to be introduced, neither of
which seems obviously justified.
