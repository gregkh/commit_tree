nvme-loop: check if queue is ready in queue_rq

In case the queue is not LIVE (fully functional and connected at the nvmf
level), we cannot allow any commands other than connect to pass through.

Add a new queue state flag NVME_LOOP_Q_LIVE which is set after nvmf connect
and cleared in queue teardown.
