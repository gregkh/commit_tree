RISC-V: io.h: type fixes for warnings

include <linux/types.h> for __iomem definition. Also, add volatile to
iounmap() like other architectures have it to avoid "discarding
volatile" warnings from some drivers.

Finally, explicitly promote the base address for INB/OUTB functions to
avoid some old legacy drivers complaining about int-to-ptr promotions.
The drivers are unlikely to work but they're included in allmodconfig
so the warnings are noisy.

Fixes, among other warnings, these with allmodconfig:

../arch/riscv/include/asm/io.h:24:21: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before '*' token
 extern void __iomem *ioremap(phys_addr_t offset, unsigned long size);

sound/pci/echoaudio/echoaudio.c: In function 'snd_echo_free':
sound/pci/echoaudio/echoaudio.c:1879:10: warning: passing argument 1 of 'iounmap' discards 'volatile' qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-qualifiers]
