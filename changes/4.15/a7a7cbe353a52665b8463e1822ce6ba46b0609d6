nvme-pci: add SGL support

This adds SGL support for NVMe PCIe driver, based on an earlier patch
from Rajiv Shanmugam Madeswaran <smrajiv15 at gmail.com>. This patch
refactors the original code and adds new module parameter sgl_threshold
to determine whether to use SGL or PRP for IOs.

The usage of SGLs is controlled by the sgl_threshold module parameter,
which allows to conditionally use SGLs if average request segment
size (avg_seg_size) is greater than sgl_threshold. In the original patch,
the decision of using SGLs was dependent only on the IO size,
with the new approach we consider not only IO size but also the
number of physical segments present in the IO.

We calculate avg_seg_size based on request payload bytes and number
of physical segments present in the request.

For e.g.:-

1. blk_rq_nr_phys_segments = 2 blk_rq_payload_bytes = 8k
avg_seg_size = 4K use sgl if avg_seg_size >= sgl_threshold.

2. blk_rq_nr_phys_segments = 2 blk_rq_payload_bytes = 64k
avg_seg_size = 32K use sgl if avg_seg_size >= sgl_threshold.

3. blk_rq_nr_phys_segments = 16 blk_rq_payload_bytes = 64k
avg_seg_size = 4K use sgl if avg_seg_size >= sgl_threshold.
