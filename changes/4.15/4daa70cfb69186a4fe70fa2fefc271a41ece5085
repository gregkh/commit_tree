net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Simplify bcm_sf2_cfp_rule_get_all()

There is no need to do a HW search of the TCAMs which is something slow
and expensive. Since we already maintain a bitmask of active CFP rules,
just iterate over those, starting from bit 1 (after the reserved entry)
to get a count and index position to store the rule later on.

As a result we can remove the code in bcm_sf2_cfp_rule_get() which acted
on the "search" argument, and remove that argument.
