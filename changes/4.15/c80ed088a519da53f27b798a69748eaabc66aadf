arm64: vdso: fix clock_getres for 4GiB-aligned res

The vdso tries to check for a NULL res pointer in __kernel_clock_getres,
but only checks the lower 32 bits as is uses CBZ on the W register the
res pointer is held in.

Thus, if the res pointer happened to be aligned to a 4GiB boundary, we'd
spuriously skip storing the timespec to it, while returning a zero error code
to the caller.

Prevent this by checking the whole pointer, using CBZ on the X register
the res pointer is held in.
