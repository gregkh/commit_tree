drm/i915/glk: IPC linetime watermark workaround for GLK

IF IPC is enabled LINETIME_WM value should be half of calculated value
 line time = ROUNDDOWN(1/2 * Calculated Line Time)

Earlier code was rounding-up the value, But updated Bspec says we should
take the ROUNDDOWN. This patch corrects that as well.
