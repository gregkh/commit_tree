fix kcm_clone()

1) it's fput() or sock_release(), not both
2) don't do fd_install() until the last failure exit.
3) not a bug per se, but... don't attach socket to struct file
   until it's set up.

Take reserving descriptor into the caller, move fd_install() to the
caller, sanitize failure exits and calling conventions.
