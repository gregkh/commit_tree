NTB: Add check and comment for link up to mw_count() and mw_get_align()

Adds a comment and a check to ntb_mw_get_align() so that it always fails
if the function is called before the link is up.

Also adds a comment to ntb_mw_count() to note that it may return 0 if
it is called before the link is up.

This is to prevent accidental mis-use in clients that are testing
on hardware that this doesn't matter for.
