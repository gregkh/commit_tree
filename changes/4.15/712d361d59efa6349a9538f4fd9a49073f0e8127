xfs: calculate correct offset in xfs_scrub_quota_item

It's only used for tracepoints so it's relatively harmless,
but the offset is calculated incorrectly in xfs_scrub_quota_item.

qi_dqperchunk is the nr. of dquots per "chunk" which we have
conveniently *cough* defined to always be 1 FSB.  Therefore
block_offset * qi_dqperchunk == first id in that chunk,
and so offset = id / qi_dqperchunk

id * dqperchunk is ... meaningless.
