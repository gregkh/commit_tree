media: rc: partial revert of "media: rc: per-protocol repeat period"

Since commit d57ea877af38 ("media: rc: per-protocol repeat period"), most
IR protocols have a lower keyup timeout. This causes problems on the
ite-cir, which has default IR timeout of 200ms.

Since the IR decoders read the trailing space, with a IR timeout of 200ms,
the last keydown will have at least a delay of 200ms. This is more than
the protocol timeout of e.g. rc-6 (which is 164ms). As a result the last
IR will be interpreted as a new keydown event, and we get two keypresses.

Revert the protocol timeout to 250ms, except for cec which needs a timeout
of 550ms.

Fixes: d57ea877af38 ("media: rc: per-protocol repeat period")
