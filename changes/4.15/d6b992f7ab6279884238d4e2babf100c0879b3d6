lightnvm: pblk: gc all lines in the pipeline before exit

Finish garbage collect of the lines that are in the gc pipeline
before exiting. Ensure that all lines already in in the pipeline
goes through, from read to write.

Do this by keeping track of how many lines are in the pipeline
and waiting for that number to reach zero before exiting the gc
reader task.

Since we're adding a new gc line counter, change the name of
inflight_gc to read_inflight_gc to make the distinction clear.
