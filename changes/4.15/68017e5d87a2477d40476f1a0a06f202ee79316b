doc, block, bfq: update max IOPS sustainable with BFQ

We have investigated more deeply the performance of BFQ, in terms of
number of IOPS that can be processed by the CPU when BFQ is used as
I/O scheduler. In more detail, using the script [1], we have measured
the number of IOPS reached on top of a null block device configured
with zero latency, as a function of the workload (sequential read,
sequential write, random read, random write) and of the system (we
considered desktops, laptops and embedded systems).

Basing on the resulting figures, with this commit we update the
current, conservative IOPS range reported in BFQ documentation. In
particular, the documentation now reports, for each of three different
systems, the lowest number of IOPS obtained for that system with the
above test (namely, the value obtained with the workload leading to
the lowest IOPS).
