ide: Make ide_cdrom_prep_fs() initialize the sense buffer pointer

The changes introduced through commit 82ed4db499b8 assume that the
sense buffer pointer in struct scsi_request is initialized for all
requests - passthrough and filesystem requests. Hence make sure
that that pointer is initialized for filesystem requests. Remove
the memset() call that clears .cmd because the scsi_req_init()
call in ide_initialize_rq() already initializes the .cmd.

Fixes: commit 82ed4db499b8 ("block: split scsi_request out of struct request")
