dma-mapping: turn dma_cache_sync into a dma_map_ops method

After we removed all the dead wood it turns out only two architectures
actually implement dma_cache_sync as a real op: mips and parisc.  Add
a cache_sync method to struct dma_map_ops and implement it for the
mips defualt DMA ops, and the parisc pa11 ops.

Note that arm, arc and openrisc support DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT, but
never provided a functional dma_cache_sync implementations, which
seems somewhat odd.
