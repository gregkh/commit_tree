serial: atmel: Use common rs485 device tree parsing function

We just got a common helper for parsing the rs485 specific
device tree properties. Use it and drop the open coded parser.

Note that there is a small difference between the removed and the now
used implementation: The former cleared flags to 0 if rs485-rts-delay
was given, the common helper clears SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX and
SER_RS485_ENABLED only but always which makes more sense.
