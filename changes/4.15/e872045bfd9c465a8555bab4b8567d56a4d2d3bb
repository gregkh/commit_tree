x86/entry/64: Simplify reg restore code in the standard IRET paths

The old code restored all the registers with movq instead of pop.

In theory, this was done because some CPUs have higher movq
throughput, but any gain there would be tiny and is almost certainly
outweighed by the higher text size.

This saves 96 bytes of text.
