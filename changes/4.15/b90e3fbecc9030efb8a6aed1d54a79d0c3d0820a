drm/amdkfd: Adjust dequeue latencies and timeouts

Adjust latencies and timeouts for dequeueing with HWS and consolidate
them in one place. Make them longer to allow long running waves to
complete without causing a timeout. The timeout is twice as long as the
latency plus some buffer to make sure we don't detect a timeout
prematurely.

Change timeouts for dequeueing HQDs without HWS. KFD_UNMAP_LATENCY is
more consistent with what the HWS does for user queues.
