mm, arch: remove empty_bad_page*

empty_bad_page() and empty_bad_pte_table() seem to be relics from old
days which is not used by any code for a long time.  I have tried to
find when exactly but this is not really all that straightforward due to
many code movements - traces disappear around 2.4 times.

Anyway no code really references neither empty_bad_page nor
empty_bad_pte_table.  We only allocate the storage which is not used by
anybody so remove them.
