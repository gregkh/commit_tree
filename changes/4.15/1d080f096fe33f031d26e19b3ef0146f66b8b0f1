x86/microcode: Fix again accessing initrd after having been freed

Commit 24c2503255d3 ("x86/microcode: Do not access the initrd after it has
been freed") fixed attempts to access initrd from the microcode loader
after it has been freed. However, a similar KASAN warning was reported
(stack trace edited):

After some investigation, it turned out that a merge was done using the
wrong side to resolve, leading to picking up the previous state, before
the 24c2503255d3 fix. Therefore the Fixes tag below contains a merge
commit.

Revert the mismerge by catching the save_microcode_in_initrd_amd()
retval and thus letting the function exit with the last return statement
so that initrd_gone can be set to true.
