power: Adds support for Smart Battery System Manager

This patch adds support for Smart Battery System Manager.
A SBSM is a device listening at I2C/SMBus address 0x0a and is capable of
communicating up to four I2C smart battery devices. All smart battery
devices are listening at address 0x0b, so the SBSM muliplexes between
them. The driver makes use of the I2C-Mux framework to allow smart
batteries to be bound via device tree, i.e. the sbs-battery driver.

Via sysfs interface the online state and charge type are presented. If
the driver is bound as ltc1760 (an implementation of a Dual Smart Battery
System Manager) the charge type can also be changed from trickle to fast.
