ipv6: prepare fib6_locate() for exception table

fib6_locate() is used to find the fib6_node according to the passed in
prefix address key. It currently tries to find the fib6_node with the
exact match of the passed in key. However, when we move cached routes
into the exception table, fib6_locate() will fail to find the fib6_node
for it as the cached routes will be stored in the exception table under
the fib6_node with the longest prefix match of the cache's dst addr key.
This commit adds a new parameter to let the caller specify if it needs
exact match or longest prefix match.
Right now, all callers still does exact match when calling
fib6_locate(). It will be changed in later commit where exception table
is hooked up to store cached routes.
