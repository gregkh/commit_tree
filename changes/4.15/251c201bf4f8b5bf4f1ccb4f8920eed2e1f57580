spi: a3700: Fix clk prescaling for coefficient over 15

The Armada 3700 SPI controller has 2 ranges of prescaler coefficients.
One ranging from 0 to 15 by steps of 1, and one ranging from 0 to 30 by
steps of 2.

This commit fixes the prescaler coefficients that are over 15 so that it
uses the correct range of values. The prescaling coefficient is rounded
to the upper value if it is odd.

This was tested on Espressobin with spidev and a locigal analyser.
