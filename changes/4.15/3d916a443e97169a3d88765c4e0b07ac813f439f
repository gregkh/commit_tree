documentation: Slow systems can stall RCU grace periods

If a fast system has a worst-case grace-period duration of (say) ten
seconds, then running the same workload on a system ten times as slow
will get you an RCU CPU stall warning given default stall-warning
timeout settings.  This commit therefore adds this possibility to
stallwarn.txt.
