clk: rockchip: add more rk3188 graphics clock ids

Add ids for cif, v{d/e}pu clocks on rk3188. ACLK_CIF does get a needed
1 at it's end but that should be safe because no driver for the camera
interface has surfaced so far and the old vendor kernels for these socs
are based on linux-3.0 and still used board files then, so there really
are no previous users anywhere to be found.
