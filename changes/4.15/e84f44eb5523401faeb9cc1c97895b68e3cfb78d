can: kvaser_usb: Fix comparison bug in kvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback()

The conditon in the while-loop becomes true when actual_length is less than
2 (MSG_HEADER_LEN). In best case we end up with a former, already
dispatched msg, that got msg->len greater than actual_length. This will
result in a "Format error" error printout.

Problem seen when unplugging a Kvaser USB device connected to a vbox guest.
