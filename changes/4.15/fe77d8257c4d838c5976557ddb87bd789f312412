batman-adv: Always initialize fragment header priority

The batman-adv unuicast fragment header contains 3 bits for the priority of
the packet. These bits will be initialized when the skb->priority contains
a value between 256 and 263. But otherwise, the uninitialized bits from the
stack will be used.
