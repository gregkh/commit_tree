arm64/sve: Signal frame and context structure definition

This patch defines the representation that will be used for the SVE
register state in the signal frame, and implements support for
saving and restoring the SVE registers around signals.

The same layout will also be used for the in-kernel task state.

Due to the variability of the SVE vector length, it is not possible
to define a fixed C struct to describe all the registers.  Instead,
Macros are defined in sigcontext.h to facilitate access to the
parts of the structure.
