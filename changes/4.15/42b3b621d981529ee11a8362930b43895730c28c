staging: rtl8723bs: remove implicit int->bool conversions

Implicit type conversions are bad; they hinder readability of code and
have potential to cause bugs. Here the variable wait_ack is always
supplied a bool value while in function declarations it is defined as an
int type. Fix it by defining wait_ack a bool type in all usages.
