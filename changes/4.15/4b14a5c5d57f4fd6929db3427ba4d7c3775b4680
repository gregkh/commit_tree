block: remove unnecessary NULL checks in bioset_integrity_free()

mempool_destroy() already checks for a NULL value being passed in, this
eliminates duplicate checks.

This was caught by running make coccicheck M=block/ on linus' tree on
commit 77ede3a014a32746002f7889211f0cecf4803163 (current head as of this
patch).
