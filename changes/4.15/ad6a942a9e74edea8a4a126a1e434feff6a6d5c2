afs: Update the cache index structure

Update the cache index structure in the following ways:

 (1) Don't use the volume name followed by the volume type as levels in the
     cache index.  Volumes can be renamed.  Use the volume ID instead.

 (2) Don't store the VLDB data for a volume in the tree.  If the volume
     database should be cached locally, then it should be done in a separate
     tree.

 (3) Expand the volume ID stored in the cache to 64 bits.

 (4) Expand the file/vnode ID stored in the cache to 96 bits.

 (5) Increment the cache structure version number to 1.
