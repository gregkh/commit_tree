x86/boot/compressed/64: Print error if 5-level paging is not supported

If the machine does not support the paging mode for which the kernel was
compiled, the boot process cannot continue.

It's not possible to let the kernel detect the mismatch as it does not even
reach the point where cpu features can be evaluted due to a triple fault in
the KASLR setup.

Instead of instantaneous silent reboot, emit an error message which gives
the user the information why the boot fails.
