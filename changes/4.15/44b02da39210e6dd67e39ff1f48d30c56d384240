staging: greybus: loopback: Fix iteration count on async path

Commit 12927835d211 ("greybus: loopback: Add asynchronous bi-directional
support") does what it says on the tin - namely, adds support for
asynchronous bi-directional loopback operations.

What it neglects to do though is increment the per-connection
gb->iteration_count on an asynchronous operation error. This patch fixes
that omission.
