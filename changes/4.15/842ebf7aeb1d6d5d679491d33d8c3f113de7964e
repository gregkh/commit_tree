drm/i915: Don't enable/unmask flip interrupts

commit fd3a40242e87 ("drm/i915: Rip out legacy page_flip completion/irq
handling") removed the code to hande the flip done/pending interrupts,
but it failed to actually disable/mask those interrupts. Let's do that
now.

Also remove a stale comment that was left behind.
