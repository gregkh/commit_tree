kallsyms: take advantage of the new '%px' format

The conditional kallsym hex printing used a special fixed-width '%lx'
output (KALLSYM_FMT) in preparation for the hashing of %p, but that
series ended up adding a %px specifier to help with the conversions.

Use it, and avoid the "print pointer as an unsigned long" code.
