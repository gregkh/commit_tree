arm64/sve: Probe SVE capabilities and usable vector lengths

This patch uses the cpufeatures framework to determine common SVE
capabilities and vector lengths, and configures the runtime SVE
support code appropriately.

ZCR_ELx is not really a feature register, but it is convenient to
use it as a template for recording the maximum vector length
supported by a CPU, using the LEN field.  This field is similar to
a feature field in that it is a contiguous bitfield for which we
want to determine the minimum system-wide value.  This patch adds
ZCR as a pseudo-register in cpuinfo/cpufeatures, with appropriate
custom code to populate it.  Finding the minimum supported value of
the LEN field is left to the cpufeatures framework in the usual
way.

The meaning of ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 is not architecturally defined yet,
so for now we just require it to be zero.

Note that much of this code is dormant and SVE still won't be used
yet, since system_supports_sve() remains hardwired to false.
