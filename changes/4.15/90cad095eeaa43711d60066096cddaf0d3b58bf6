drm/i915: Disable MI_STORE_DATA_IMM for i915g/i915gm

The early gen3 machines (i915g/Grantsdale and i915gm/Alviso) share a lot
of characteristics in their MI/GTT blocks with gen2, and in particular
can only use physical addresses in MI_STORE_DATA_IMM. This makes it
incompatible with our usage, so include those two machines in the
blacklist to prevent usage.

v2: Make it easy for gcc and rewrite it as a switch to save some space.
