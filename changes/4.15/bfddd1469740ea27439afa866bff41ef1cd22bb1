drm/sun4i: hdmi: Move PAD_CTRL1 setting to mode_set function

Initially we configured the PAD_CTRL1 register at probe/bind time.
However it seems the HDMI controller will modify some of the bits
in this register by itself. On the A10 it is particularly annoying
as it toggles the output invert bits, which inverts the colors on
the display output.

The U-boot driver this driver is based on sets this register twice,
though it seems it's only needed for actual display output. Hence
we move it to the mode_set function.
