serial: mvebu-uart: add function to change baudrate

Until now, the first UART port baudrate was set by the bootloader.

Add a function allowing to change the baudrate. Changes may be done
from userspace but also at probe time by the kernel. Use the simplest
method: baudrate divisor.

Works for all UART ports until 230400 baud. To achieve higher baudrates,
software should implement the fractional divisor feature that allows
more accuracy for higher rates.
