mlxsw: spectrum: mr_tcam: Add trap-and-forward multicast route

In addition to the current multicast route actions, which include trap
route action and a forward route action, add the trap-and-forward multicast
route action, and implement it in the multicast routing hardware logic.

To implement that, add a trap-and-forward ACL action as the last action in
the route flexible action set. The used trap is the ACL2 trap, which marks
the packets with offload_mr_forward_mark, to prevent the packet from being
forwarded again by the kernel.

Note: At that stage the offloading logic does not support trap-and-forward
multicast routes. This patch adds the support only in the hardware logic.
