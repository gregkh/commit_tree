x86/virt/xen: Use guest_late_init to detect Xen PVH guest

In case we are booted via the default boot entry by a generic loader
like grub or OVMF it is necessary to distinguish between a HVM guest
with a device model supporting legacy devices and a PVH guest without
device model.

PVH guests will always have x86_platform.legacy.no_vga set and
x86_platform.legacy.rtc cleared, while both won't be true for HVM
guests.

Test for both conditions in the guest_late_init hook and set xen_pvh
to true if they are met.

Move some of the early PVH initializations to the new hook in order
to avoid duplicated code.
