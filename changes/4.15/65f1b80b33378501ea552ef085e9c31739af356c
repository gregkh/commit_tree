Revert "f2fs: handle dirty segments inside refresh_sit_entry"

This reverts commit 5e443818fa0b2a2845561ee25bec181424fb2889

The commit should be reverted because call sequence of below two parts
of code must be kept:
a. update sit information, it needs to be updated before segment
allocation since latter allocation may trigger SSR, and SSR allocation
needs latest valid block information of all segments.
b. update segment status, it needs to be updated after segment allocation
since we can skip updating current opened segment status.
