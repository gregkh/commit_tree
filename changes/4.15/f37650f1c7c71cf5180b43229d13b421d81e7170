fanotify: fix fsnotify_prepare_user_wait() failure

If fsnotify_prepare_user_wait() fails, we leave the event on the
notification list.  Which will result in a warning in
fsnotify_destroy_event() and later use-after-free.

Instead of adding a new helper to remove the event from the list in this
case, I opted to move the prepare/finish up into fanotify_handle_event().

This will allow these to be moved further out into the generic code later,
and perhaps let us move to non-sleeping RCU.
