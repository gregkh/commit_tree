drm/i915: Clear pipestat consistently

We have a lot of different ways of clearing the PIPESTAT registers.
Let's unify it all into one function. There's no magic in PIPESTAT
that would require any of the double clearing and whatnot that
some of the code tries to do. All we can really do is clear the status
bits and disable the enable bits. There is no way to mask anything
so as soon as another event happens the status bit will become set
again, and trying to clear them twice or something can't protect
against that.
