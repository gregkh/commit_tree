ipv4: Fix use-after-free when flushing FIB tables

Since commit 0ddcf43d5d4a ("ipv4: FIB Local/MAIN table collapse") the
local table uses the same trie allocated for the main table when custom
rules are not in use.

When a net namespace is dismantled, the main table is flushed and freed
(via an RCU callback) before the local table. In case the callback is
invoked before the local table is iterated, a use-after-free can occur.

Fix this by iterating over the FIB tables in reverse order, so that the
main table is always freed after the local table.

v3: Reworded comment according to Alex's suggestion.
v2: Add a comment to make the fix more explicit per Dave's and Alex's
feedback.
