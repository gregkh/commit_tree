drm: Add CRTC_GET_SEQUENCE and CRTC_QUEUE_SEQUENCE ioctls [v3]

These provide crtc-id based functions instead of pipe-number, while
also offering higher resolution time (ns) and wider frame count (64)
as required by the Vulkan API.

v2:

 * Check for DRIVER_MODESET in new crtc-based vblank ioctls

	Failing to check this will oops the driver.

 * Ensure vblank interupt is running in crtc_get_sequence ioctl

	The sequence and timing values are not correct while the
	interrupt is off, so make sure it's running before asking for
	them.

 * Short-circuit get_sequence if the counter is enabled and accurate

	Steal the idea from the code in wait_vblank to avoid the
	expense of drm_vblank_get/put

 * Return active state of crtc in crtc_get_sequence ioctl

	Might be useful for applications that aren't in charge of
	modesetting?

 * Use drm_crtc_vblank_get/put in new crtc-based vblank sequence ioctls

	Daniel Vetter prefers these over the old drm_vblank_put/get
	APIs.

 * Return s64 ns instead of u64 in new sequence event

v3:

 * Removed FIRST_PIXEL_OUT_FLAG
 * Document that the timestamp in the query and event are
   that of the first pixel leaving the display engine for
   the display (using the same wording as the Vulkan spec).
