proc: show si_ptr in /proc/<pid>/timers without hashing

It's a user pointer, and while the permissions of the file are pretty
questionable (should it really be readable to everybody), hashing the
pointer isn't going to be the solution.

We should take a closer look at more of the /proc/<pid> file permissions
in general.  Sure, we do want many of them to often be readable (for
'ps' and friends), but I think we should probably do a few conversions
from S_IRUGO to S_IRUSR.
