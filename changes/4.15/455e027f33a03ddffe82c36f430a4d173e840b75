platform/x86: intel_cht_int33fe: Update fusb302 type string, add properties

The fusb302 driver as merged in staging uses "typec_fusb302" as i2c-id
rather then just "fusb302" and needs us to set a number of device-
properties, adjust the intel_cht_int33fe driver accordingly.

One of the properties set is max-snk-mv which makes the fusb302 driver
negotiate up to 12V charging voltage, which is a bad idea on boards
which are not setup to handle this, so this commit also adds 2 extra
sanity checks to make sure that the expected Whiskey Cove PMIC +
TI bq24292i charger combo, which can handle 12V, is present.
