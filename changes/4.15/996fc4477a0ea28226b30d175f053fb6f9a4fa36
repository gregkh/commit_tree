ext4: add missing error check in __ext4_new_inode()

It's possible for ext4_get_acl() to return an ERR_PTR.  So we need to
add a check for this case in __ext4_new_inode().  Otherwise on an
error we can end up oops the kernel.

This was getting triggered by xfstests generic/388, which is a test
which exercises the shutdown code path.
