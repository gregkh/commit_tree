perf stat: Support duration_time for metrics

Some of the metrics formulas (like GFLOPs) need to know how long the
measurement period is. Support an internal event called duration_time,
which reports time in second. It maps to the dummy event, but is special
cased for statistics to report the walltime duration.

So far it is not printed, but only used internally for metrics.
