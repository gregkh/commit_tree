iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use burst-polling for sync completion

While CMD_SYNC is unlikely to complete immediately such that we never go
round the polling loop, with a lightly-loaded queue it may still do so
long before the delay period is up. If we have no better completion
notifier, use similar logic as we have for SMMUv2 to spin a number of
times before each backoff, so that we have more chance of catching syncs
which complete relatively quickly and avoid delaying unnecessarily.
