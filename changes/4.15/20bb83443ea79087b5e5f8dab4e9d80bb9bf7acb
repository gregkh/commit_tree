x86/entry/64: Stop initializing TSS.sp0 at boot

In my quest to get rid of thread_struct::sp0, I want to clean up or
remove all of its readers.  Two of them are in cpu_init() (32-bit and
64-bit), and they aren't needed.  This is because we never enter
userspace at all on the threads that CPUs are initialized in.

Poison the initial TSS.sp0 and stop initializing it on CPU init.

The comment text mostly comes from Dave Hansen.  Thanks!
