char: ipmi: make function ipmi_get_info_from_resources static

The function ipmi_get_info_from_resources is local to the source and
does not need to be in global scope, so make it static.  Add in
newline to function declaration to make it checkpatch warning clean.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
symbol 'ipmi_get_info_from_resources' was not declared. Should it
be static?
