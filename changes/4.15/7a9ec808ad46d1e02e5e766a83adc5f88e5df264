media: v4l: fwnode: Add convenience function for parsing common external refs

Add v4l2_fwnode_parse_reference_sensor_common for parsing common
sensor properties that refer to adjacent devices such as flash or lens
driver chips.

As this is an association only, there's little a regular driver needs to
know about these devices as such.
