eeprom: at24: Add OF device ID table

The driver doesn't have a struct of_device_id table but supported devices
are registered via Device Trees. This is working on the assumption that a
I2C device registered via OF will always match a legacy I2C device ID and
that the MODALIAS reported will always be of the form i2c:<device>.

But this could change in the future so the correct approach is to have an
OF device ID table if the devices are registered via OF.

To maintain backward compatibility with old Device Trees, only use the OF
device ID table .data if the device was registered via OF and the OF node
compatible matches an entry in the OF device ID table.
