kobject: fix suppressing modalias in uevents delivered over netlink

The commit 4a336a23d619 ("kobject: copy env blob in one go") optimized
constructing uevent data for delivery over netlink by using the raw
environment buffer, instead of reconstructing it from individual
environment pointers. Unfortunately in doing so it broke suppressing
MODALIAS attribute for KOBJ_UNBIND events, as the code that suppressed this
attribute only adjusted the environment pointers, but left the buffer
itself alone. Let's fix it by making sure the offending attribute is
obliterated form the buffer as well.
