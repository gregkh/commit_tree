spi: document odd controller reference handling

Document the fact that a reference to the controller is dropped as part
of deregistration.

This is an odd pattern as the reference is typically taken in
__spi_alloc_controller() rather than spi_register_controller(). Most
controller drivers gets it right these days and notably the
device-managed interface relies on this behaviour.
