ext4: fix fdatasync(2) after fallocate(2) operation

Currently, fallocate(2) with KEEP_SIZE followed by a fdatasync(2)
then crash, we'll see wrong allocated block number (stat -c %b), the
blocks allocated beyond EOF are all lost. fstests generic/468
exposes this bug.

Commit 67a7d5f561f4 ("ext4: fix fdatasync(2) after extent
manipulation operations") fixed all the other extent manipulation
operation paths such as hole punch, zero range, collapse range etc.,
but forgot the fallocate case.

So similarly, fix it by recording the correct journal tid in ext4
inode in fallocate(2) path, so that ext4_sync_file() will wait for
the right tid to be committed on fdatasync(2).

This addresses the test failure in xfstests test generic/468.
