scsi: mpt3sas: Reduce memory footprint in kdump kernel

To reduce the memory footprint of the driver in the kdump kernel, we
apply the following settings when reset_devices is set:

1. Use single MSI-x vector.
2. Disable RDPQ mode.
3. Set sg_table_size to 32 by default.
4) Set SCSI IO Queue depth to 200.
