nvme: allow controller RESETTING to RECONNECTING transition

Transport will typically transition from LIVE to RESETTING when initially
performing a reset or recovering from an error.  Adding this transition
allows a transport to transition to RECONNECTING when it checks/waits for
connectivity then creates new transport connections and reinits the
controller.
