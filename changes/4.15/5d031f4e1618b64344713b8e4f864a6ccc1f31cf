drm/i915: Stop asserting on set-wedged vs nop_submit_request ordering

Since the removal of the stop_machine(), it is allowed and expected for
the nop_submit_request() and nop_complete_submit_request() to run in
parallel to the i915_gem_set_wedged() processing. As such we can no
longer assert that i915_gem_set_wedged() has completed inside the
stop_machine prior to the individual nop_submit_request execution.
