drm/vc4: Avoid using vrefresh==0 mode in DSI htotal math.

The incoming mode might have a missing vrefresh field if it came from
drmModeSetCrtc(), which the kernel is supposed to calculate using
drm_mode_vrefresh().  We could either use that or the adjusted_mode's
original vrefresh value.

However, we can maintain a more exact vrefresh value (not just the
integer approximation), by scaling by the ratio of our clocks.

v2: Use math suggested by Andrzej Hajda instead.
v3: Simplify math now that adjusted_mode->clock isn't padded.
v4: Drop some parens.
