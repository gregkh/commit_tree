thermal/drivers/hisi: Simplify the temperature/step computation

The step and the base temperature are fixed values, we can simplify the
computation by converting the base temperature to milli celsius and use a
pre-computed step value. That saves us a lot of mult + div for nothing at
runtime.

Take also the opportunity to change the function names to be consistent with
the rest of the code.
