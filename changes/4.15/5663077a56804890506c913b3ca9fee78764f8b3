drm/vc4: clean up error handling on devm_kzalloc failure

The current error handling when devm_kzalloc fails performs a
non-null check on connector which is redundant because connector
is null at that failure point.  Once this is removed, make the
failure path into a trivial -ENOMEM return to clean up the
error handling. Also remove need to initialize connector to NULL.
