sctp: silence warns on sctp_stream_init allocations

As SCTP supports up to 65535 streams, that can lead to very large
allocations in sctp_stream_init(). As Xin Long noticed, systems with
small amounts of memory are more prone to not have enough memory and
dump warnings on dmesg initiated by user actions. Thus, silence them.

Also, if the reallocation of stream->out is not necessary, skip it and
keep the memory we already have.
