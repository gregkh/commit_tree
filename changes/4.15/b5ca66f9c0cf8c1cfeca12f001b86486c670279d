tracing, thermal: Hide devfreq trace events when not in use

As trace events when defined create data structures and functions to
process them, defining trace events when not using them is a waste of
memory.

The trace events thermal_power_devfreq_get_power and
thermal_power_devfreq_limit are only used when CONFIG_DEVFREQ_THERMAL
is set. Make those events only defined when that is set as well.
