tools/include: Remove ACCESS_ONCE()

There are no longer any usersapce uses of ACCESS_ONCE(), so we can
remove the definition from our userspace <linux/compiler.h>, which is
only used by tools in the kernel directory (i.e. it isn't a uapi
header).

This patch removes the ACCESS_ONCE() definition, and updates comments
which referred to it. At the same time, some inconsistent and redundant
whitespace is removed from comments.
