tcp: Remove use of inet6_sk and add IPv6 checks to tracepoint

386fd5da401d ("tcp: Check daddr_cache before use in tracepoint") was the
second version of the tracepoint fixup patch. This patch is the delta
between v2 and v3.  Specifically, remove the use of inet6_sk and check
sk_family as requested by Eric and add IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6) around
the use of sk_v6_rcv_saddr and sk_v6_daddr as done in sock_common (noted
by Cong).
