drm/i915: Apply the GTT write flush for all !llc machines

We also see the delayed GTT write issue on i915g/i915gm, so let's
presume that it is a universal problem for all !llc machines, and that we
just haven't yet noticed on g33, gen4 and gen5 machines.

v2: Use a register that exists on all platforms

Testcase: igt/gem_mmap_gtt/coherency # i915gm
