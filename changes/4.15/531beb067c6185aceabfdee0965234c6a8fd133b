dma-buf: remove redundant initialization of sg_table

sg_table is being initialized and is never read before it is updated
again later on, hence making the initialization redundant. Remove
the initialization.

Detected by clang scan-build:
"warning: Value stored to 'sg_table' during its initialization is
never read"
