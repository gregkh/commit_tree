dmaengine: dmatest: warn user when dma test times out

Commit adfa543e7314 ("dmatest: don't use set_freezable_with_signal()")
introduced a bug (that is in fact documented by the patch commit text)
that leaves behind a dangling pointer. Since the done_wait structure is
allocated on the stack, future invocations to the DMATEST can produce
undesirable results (e.g., corrupted spinlocks). Ideally, this would be
cleaned up in the thread handler, but at the very least, the kernel
is left in a very precarious scenario that can lead to some long debug
sessions when the crash comes later.
