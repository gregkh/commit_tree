USB: serial: garmin_gps: fix I/O after failed probe and remove

Make sure to stop any submitted interrupt and bulk-out URBs before
returning after failed probe and when the port is being unbound to avoid
later NULL-pointer dereferences in the completion callbacks.

Also fix up the related and broken I/O cancellation on failed open and
on close. (Note that port->write_urb was never submitted.)
