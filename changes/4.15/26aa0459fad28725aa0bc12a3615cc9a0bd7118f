net/sched: Check for null dev_queue on create flow

In qdisc_alloc() the dev_queue pointer was used without any checks
being performed. If qdisc_create() gets a null dev_queue pointer, it
just passes it along to qdisc_alloc(), leading to a crash. That
happens if a root qdisc implements select_queue() and returns a null
dev_queue pointer for an "invalid handle", for example, or if the
dev_queue associated with the parent qdisc is null.

This patch is in preparation for the next in this series, where
select_queue() is being added to mqprio and as it may return a null
dev_queue.
