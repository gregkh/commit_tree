s390: enable CPU alternatives unconditionally

Remove the CPU_ALTERNATIVES config option and enable the code
unconditionally. The config option was only added to avoid a conflict
with the named saved segment support. Since that code is gone there is
no reason to keep the CPU_ALTERNATIVES config option.

Just enable it unconditionally to also reduce the number of config
options and make it less likely that something breaks.
