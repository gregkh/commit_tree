net: dsa: prepare master receive hot path

In preparation to make DSA master devices point to their corresponding
CPU port instead of the whole tree, add copies of dst and rcv in the
dsa_port structure so that we keep fast access in the receive hot path.

Also keep the copies at the beginning of the dsa_port structure in order
to ensure they are available in cacheline 1.
