s390/mm,kvm: improve detection of KVM guest faults

The identification of guest fault currently relies on the PF_VCPU flag.
This is set in guest_entry_irqoff and cleared in guest_exit_irqoff.
Both functions are called by __vcpu_run, the PF_VCPU flag is set for
quite a lot of kernel code outside of the guest execution.

Replace the PF_VCPU scheme with the PIF_GUEST_FAULT in the pt_regs and
make the program check handler code in entry.S set the bit only for
exception that occurred between the .Lsie_gmap and .Lsie_done labels.
