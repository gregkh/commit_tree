drm/i915/lrc: Clarify the format of the context image

Not only the context image consist of two parts (the PPHWSP, and the
logical context state), but we also allocate a header at the start of
for sharing data with GuC. Thus every lrc looks like this:

  | [guc]          | [hwsp] [logical state] |
  |<- our header ->|<- context image      ->|

So far, we have oversimplified whenever we use each of these parts of the
context, just because the GuC header happens to be in page 0, and the
(PP)HWSP is in page 1. But this had led to using the same define for more
than one meaning (as a page index in the lrc and as 1 page).

This patch adds defines for the GuC shared page, the PPHWSP page and the
start of the logical state. It also updated the places where the old
define was being used. Since we are not changing the size (or format) of
the context, there are no functional changes.

v2: Use PPHWSP index for hws again.
