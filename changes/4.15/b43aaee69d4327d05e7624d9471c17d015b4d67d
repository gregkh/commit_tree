drm/amdgpu: move UVD/VCE and VCN structure out from union

With the enablement of VCN Dec and Enc from user space, User space queries
kernel for the IP information, if HW has UVD/VCE, the info comes from these
IP blocks, but this could end up mis-interpret for VCN when they are in the
union, the other way same when HW with VCN block.
