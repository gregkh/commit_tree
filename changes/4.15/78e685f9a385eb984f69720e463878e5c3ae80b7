drm/amd/display: Use TPS4 instead of CP2520_3 for phy pattern 7

[Description]
We originally use TPS4 phy test pattern for test pattern 7.
On RV we switched to a new method to use CP2520.
CP2520 should produce the same result.
However in reality, it fails DP PHY automation test.
We use the original method instead.
