usb: xhci: Disable slot even when virt-dev is null

xhci_disable_slot() is a helper for disabling a slot when a device
goes away or recovers from error situations. Currently, it checks
the corespoding virt-dev pointer and returns directly (w/o issuing
disable slot command) if it's null.

This is unnecessary and will cause problems in case where virt-dev
allocation fails and xhci_disable_slot() is called to roll back the
hardware state. Refer to the implementation of xhci_alloc_dev().

This patch removes lines to check virt-dev in xhci_disable_slot().
