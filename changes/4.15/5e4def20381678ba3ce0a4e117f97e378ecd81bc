Pass mode to wait_on_atomic_t() action funcs and provide default actions

Make wait_on_atomic_t() pass the TASK_* mode onto its action function as an
extra argument and make it 'unsigned int throughout.

Also, consolidate a bunch of identical action functions into a default
function that can do the appropriate thing for the mode.

Also, change the argument name in the bit_wait*() function declarations to
reflect the fact that it's the mode and not the bit number.

[Peter Z gives this a grudging ACK, but thinks that the whole atomic_t wait
should be done differently, though he's not immediately sure as to how]
