crypto: doc - adapt api sample to use async. op wait

The code sample is waiting for an async. crypto op completion.
Adapt sample to use the new generic infrastructure to do the same.

This also fixes a possible data coruption bug created by the
use of wait_for_completion_interruptible() without dealing
correctly with an interrupt aborting the wait prior to the
async op finishing.
