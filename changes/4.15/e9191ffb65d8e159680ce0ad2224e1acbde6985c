ipv6: Fix getsockopt() for sockets with default IPV6_AUTOFLOWLABEL

Commit 513674b5a2c9 ("net: reevalulate autoflowlabel setting after
sysctl setting") removed the initialisation of
ipv6_pinfo::autoflowlabel and added a second flag to indicate
whether this field or the net namespace default should be used.

The getsockopt() handling for this case was not updated, so it
currently returns 0 for all sockets for which IPV6_AUTOFLOWLABEL is
not explicitly enabled.  Fix it to return the effective value, whether
that has been set at the socket or net namespace level.
