tools: bpftool: update documentation for --json and --pretty usage

Update the documentation to provide help about JSON output generation,
and add an example in bpftool-prog manual page.

Also reintroduce an example that was left aside when the tool was moved
from GitHub to the kernel sources, in order to show how to mount the
bpffs file system (to pin programs) inside the bpftool-prog manual page.
