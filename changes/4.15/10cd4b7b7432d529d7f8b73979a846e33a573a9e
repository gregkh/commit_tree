mtd: spi-nor: stm32-quadspi: fix prefetching outside fsize

When memory-mapped mode is used, a prefetching mechanism fully
managed by the hardware allows to optimize the read from external
the QSPI memory. A 32-bytes FIFO is used for prefetching.
When the limit of flash size - fifo size is reached the prefetching
mechanism tries to read outside the fsize.
The stm32 quadspi hardware become busy and should be aborted.
