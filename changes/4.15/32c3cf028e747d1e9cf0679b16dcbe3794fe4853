fscrypt: new helper function - fscrypt_prepare_lookup()

Introduce a helper function which prepares to look up the given dentry
in the given directory.  If the directory is encrypted, it handles
loading the directory's encryption key, setting the dentry's ->d_op to
fscrypt_d_ops, and setting DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_WITH_KEY if the directory's
encryption key is available.

Note: once all filesystems switch over to this, we'll be able to move
fscrypt_d_ops and fscrypt_set_encrypted_dentry() to fscrypt_private.h.
