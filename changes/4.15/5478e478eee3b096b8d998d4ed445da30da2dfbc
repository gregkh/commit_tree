eeprom: at24: correctly set the size for at24mac402

There's an ilog2() expansion in AT24_DEVICE_MAGIC() which rounds down
the actual size of EUI-48 byte array in at24mac402 eeproms to 4 from 6,
making it impossible to read it all.

Fix it by manually adjusting the value in probe().

This patch contains a temporary fix that is suitable for stable
branches. Eventually we'll probably remove the call to ilog2() while
converting the magic values to actual structs.
