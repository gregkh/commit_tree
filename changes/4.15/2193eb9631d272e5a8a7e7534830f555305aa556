ASoC: Intel: boards: remove hard-coded compressed dailinks

The hard-coded compressed dailinks are not supported using
publicly-available firmwares, which creates unnecessary user
confusion [1]. Even if the firmware was available, the mainline
code does not have the required .dynamic=1 and .dpcm_playback=1
fields so probably never worked as is, and last and they conflict
with topology-defined streams.

Remove them and move on. This can be re-enabled with SOF later
in a more flexible manner.
