i40e: Add infrastructure for queue channel support

This patch sets up the infrastructure for offloading TCs and
queue configurations to the hardware by creating HW channels(VSI).
A new channel is created for each of the traffic class
configuration offloaded via mqprio framework except for the first TC
(TC0). TC0 for the main VSI is also reconfigured as per user provided
queue parameters. Queue counts that are not power-of-2 are handled by
reconfiguring RSS by reprogramming LUTs using the queue count value.
This patch also handles configuring the TX rings for the channels,
setting up the RX queue map for channel.

Also, the channels so created are removed and all the queue
configuration is set to default when the qdisc is detached from the
root of the device.
