mlxsw: spectrum_router: Handle encap to demoted tunnels

Some tunnels that are offloadable on their own can nonetheless be
demoted to slow path if their local address is in conflict with that of
another tunnel. When a route is formed for such a tunnel,
mlxsw_sp_nexthop_ipip_init() fails to find the corresponding IPIP entry,
and that triggers a FIB abort.

Resolve the problem by not assuming that a tunnel for which
mlxsw_sp_ipip_ops.can_offload() holds also automatically has an IPIP
entry.
