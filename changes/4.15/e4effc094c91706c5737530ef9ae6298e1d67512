net: vxge: remove redundant assignments and pointers

There are several pointers that are being assigned but never read
so remove these as they are redundant.  Also remove an assignment
to function_mode that is never read. Cleans up several clang
warnings:

vxge-main.c:1139:2: warning: Value stored to 'hldev' is never read
vxge-main.c:1294:2: warning: Value stored to 'hldev' is never read
vxge-main.c:2188:2: warning: Value stored to 'dev' is never read
vxge-main.c:2188:2: warning: Value stored to 'dev' is never read
vxge-main.c:2723:2: warning: Value stored to 'function_mode' is
never read
