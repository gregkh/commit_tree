parisc: Hide Diva-built-in serial aux and graphics card

Diva GSP card has built-in serial AUX port and ATI graphic card which simply
don't work and which both don't have external connectors.  User Guides even
mention that those devices shouldn't be used.
So, prevent that Linux drivers try to enable those devices.
