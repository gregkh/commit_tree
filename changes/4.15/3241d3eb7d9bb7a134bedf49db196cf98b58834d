s390: rework __switch_to() to allow larger task_struct offsets

If GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT is enabled the members of task_struct will be
shuffled around. The offsets of the "pid" and "stack" members within
task_struct may not necessarily fit into 12 bits anymore, which causes
compile errors within __switch_to, since instructions are used, which
only have a 12 bit displacement field.

Therefore rework __switch_to, to allow for larger offsets.
