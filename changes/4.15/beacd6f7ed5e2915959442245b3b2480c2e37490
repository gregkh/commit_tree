x86/mm/pkeys: Fix fill_sig_info_pkey

SEGV_PKUERR is a signal specific si_code which happens to have the same
numeric value as several others: BUS_MCEERR_AR, ILL_ILLTRP, FPE_FLTOVF,
TRAP_HWBKPT, CLD_TRAPPED, POLL_ERR, SEGV_THREAD_ID, as such it is not safe
to just test the si_code the signal number must also be tested to prevent a
false positive in fill_sig_info_pkey.

This error was by inspection, and BUS_MCEERR_AR appears to be a real
candidate for confusion.  So pass in si_signo and check for SIG_SEGV to
verify that it is actually a SEGV_PKUERR
