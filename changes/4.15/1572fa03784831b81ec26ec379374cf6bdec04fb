timekeeping: Use timespec64 in timekeeping_inject_offset

As part of changing all the timekeeping code to use 64-bit
time_t consistently, this removes the uses of timeval
and timespec as much as possible from do_adjtimex() and
timekeeping_inject_offset(). The timeval_inject_offset_valid()
and timespec_inject_offset_valid() just complicate this,
so I'm folding them into the respective callers.

This leaves the actual 'struct timex' definition, which
is part of the user-space ABI and should be dealt with
separately when we have agreed on the ABI change.
