ASoC: pfuze100: Remove leading zero from '@08' notation

which fixes the following build warnings:

Warning (unit_address_format): Node /pfuze100@08 unit name should not have leading 0s
Warning (unit_address_format): Node /pfuze200@08 unit name should not have leading 0s
Warning (unit_address_format): Node /pfuze3000@08 unit name should not have leading 0s
