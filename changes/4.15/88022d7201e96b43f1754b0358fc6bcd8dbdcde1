blk-mq: don't handle failure in .get_budget

It is enough to just check if we can get the budget via .get_budget().
And we don't need to deal with device state change in .get_budget().

For SCSI, one issue to be fixed is that we have to call
scsi_mq_uninit_cmd() to free allocated ressources if SCSI device fails
to handle the request. And it isn't enough to simply call
blk_mq_end_request() to do that if this request is marked as
RQF_DONTPREP.

Fixes: 0df21c86bdbf(scsi: implement .get_budget and .put_budget for blk-mq)
