ipmi: fix unsigned long underflow

When I set the timeout to a specific value such as 500ms, the timeout
event will not happen in time due to the overflow in function
check_msg_timeout:
...
	ent->timeout -= timeout_period;
	if (ent->timeout > 0)
		return;
...

The type of timeout_period is long, but ent->timeout is unsigned long.
This patch makes the type consistent.
