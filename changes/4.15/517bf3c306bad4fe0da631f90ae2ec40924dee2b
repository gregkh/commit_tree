block: don't look at the struct device dev_t in disk_devt

The hidden gendisks introduced in the next patch need to keep the dev
field in their struct device empty so that udev won't try to create
block device nodes for them.  To support that rewrite disk_devt to
look at the major and first_minor fields in the gendisk itself instead
of looking into the struct device.
