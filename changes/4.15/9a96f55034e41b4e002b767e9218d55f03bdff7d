drm: introduce drm_dev_{get/put} functions

Reference counting functions in the kernel typically use get/put suffixes. For
maintaining coding style consistency, introduce drm_dev_{get/put} functions. All
callers of drm_dev_ref() API have been converted in this patch and hence it has
been dropped while the drm_dev_unref() API with non-trivial number of users
remains for compatibility.

The semantic patch scripts/coccinelle/api/drm-get-put.cocci has been updated
with the new helper for conversion of drm_dev_unref() to drm_dev_put()
