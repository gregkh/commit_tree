net/mlx5: Fix get vector affinity helper function

mlx5_get_vector_affinity used to call pci_irq_get_affinity and after
reverting the patch that sets the device affinity via PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY
API, calling pci_irq_get_affinity becomes useless and it breaks RDMA
mlx5 users.  To fix this, this patch provides an alternative way to
retrieve IRQ vector affinity using legacy IRQ API, following
smp_affinity read procfs implementation.
