nvmet: better data length validation

Currently the NVMe target stores the expexted data length in req->data_len
and uses that for data transfer decisions, but that does not take the
actual transfer length in the SGLs into account.  So this adds a new
transfer_len field, into which the transport drivers store the actual
transfer length.  We then check the two match before actually executing
the command.

The FC transport driver already had such a field, which is removed in
favour of the common one.
