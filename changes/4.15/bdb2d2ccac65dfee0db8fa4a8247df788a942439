KVM: arm/arm64: GICv4: Add doorbell interrupt handling

When a vPE is not running, a VLPI being made pending results in a
doorbell interrupt being delivered. Let's handle this interrupt
and update the pending_last flag that indicates that VLPIs are
pending. The corresponding vcpu is also kicked into action.

Special care is taken to prevent the doorbell from being enabled
at request time (this is controlled separately), and to make
the disabling on the interrupt non-lazy.
