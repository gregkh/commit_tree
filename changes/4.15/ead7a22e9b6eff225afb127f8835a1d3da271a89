s390: avoid undefined behaviour

At a couple of places smatch emits warnings like this:

    arch/s390/mm/vmem.c:409 vmem_map_init() warn:
        right shifting more than type allows

In fact shifting a signed type right is undefined. Avoid this and add
an unsigned long cast. The shifted values are always positive.
