xfs: relax is_reflink_inode assert in xfs_reflink_find_cow_mapping

We don't hold the ilock through the entire sequence of xfs_writepage_map
-> xfs_map_cow -> xfs_reflink_find_cow_mapping.  This means that we can
race with another thread that is trying to clear the inode reflink flag,
with the result that the flag is set for the xfs_map_cow check but
cleared before we get to the assert in find_cow_mapping.  When this
happens, we blow the assert even though everything is fine.
