x86,perf: Disable intel_bts when PTI

The intel_bts driver does not use the 'normal' BTS buffer which is exposed
through the cpu_entry_area but instead uses the memory allocated for the
perf AUX buffer.

This obviously comes apart when using PTI because then the kernel mapping;
which includes that AUX buffer memory; disappears. Fixing this requires to
expose a mapping which is visible in all context and that's not trivial.

As a quick fix disable this driver when PTI is enabled to prevent
malfunction.
