batman-adv: Avoid spurious warnings from bat_v neigh_cmp implementation

The neighbor compare API implementation for B.A.T.M.A.N. V checks whether
the neigh_ifinfo for this neighbor on a specific interface exists. A
warning is printed when it isn't found.

But it is not called inside a lock which would prevent that this
information is lost right before batadv_neigh_ifinfo_get. It must therefore
be expected that batadv_v_neigh_(cmp|is_sob) might not be able to get the
requested neigh_ifinfo.

A WARN_ON for such a situation seems not to be appropriate because this
will only flood the kernel logs. The warnings must therefore be removed.
