KVM: x86: fix APIC page invalidation

Implementation of the unpinned APIC page didn't update the VMCS address
cache when invalidation was done through range mmu notifiers.
This became a problem when the page notifier was removed.

Re-introduce the arch-specific helper and call it from ...range_start.
