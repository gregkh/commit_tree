btrfs: Remove unused parameters from various functions

iterate_dir_item:found_key - introduced in 31db9f7c23fb ("Btrfs:
  introduce BTRFS_IOC_SEND for btrfs send/receive"), yet never used.

record_ref:num - ditto

This is a first pass with the low-hanging fruit. There are still quite a
few unsued parameters in some function which have to abide by a callback
interface.
