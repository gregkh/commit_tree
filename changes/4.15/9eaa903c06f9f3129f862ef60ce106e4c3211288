mtd: implement mtd_get_unmapped_area() using the point method

The mtd->_point method is a superset of mtd->_get_unmapped_area.
Especially in the NOR flash case, the point method ensures the flash
memory is in array (data) mode and that it will stay that way which
is precisely what callers of mtd_get_unmapped_area() would expect.

Implement mtd_get_unmapped_area() in terms of mtd->_point now that all
drivers that provided a _get_unmapped_area method also have the _point
method implemented.
