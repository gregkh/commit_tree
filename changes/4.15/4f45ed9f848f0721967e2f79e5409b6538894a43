x86/apic: Mark the apic_intr_mode extern for sanity check cleanup

Calling native_smp_prepare_cpus() to prepare for SMP bootup, does some
sanity checking, enables APIC mode and disables SMP feature.

Now, APIC mode setup has been unified to apic_intr_mode_init(), some sanity
checks are redundant and need to be cleanup.

Mark the apic_intr_mode extern to refine the switch and remove the
redundant sanity check.
