extcon: max77843: Add OTG power control to the MUIC driver

Enabling power on VBUS micro-usb pin is required only when passive OTG
cable is connected. Initially OTG VBUS power control was planned to be
done in charger driver. However such information is not really available
from the extcon notifications, so VBUS power control has to be done
directly in MUIC driver, which has all information about the attached
accessory.

For example SmartDock is externally powered accessory, provides OTG
(USB HOST) functionality and use VBUS pin for charging a device battery,
so the VBUS charging pump should be disabled in such case.
