drm/i915: Skip HW reinitialisation on resume if still wedged

If we fail to recover the HW state upon resume (i.e. our attempt to
clear the wedged bit and reset during i915_gem_sanitize() fails), then
skip the HW restart inside i915_gem_init_hw(). We will ultimately do the
HW restart when successfully unwedging and resetting the HW later,
but attempting to restore a wedged device upon resume is risky as the HW
is in an unknown state.

v2: Suppress the error message when detecting the already wedged HW.
