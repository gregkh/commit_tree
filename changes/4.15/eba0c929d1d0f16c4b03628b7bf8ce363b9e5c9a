bpf: fix out-of-bounds access warning in bpf_check

The bpf_verifer_ops array is generated dynamically and may be
empty depending on configuration, which then causes an out
of bounds access:

kernel/bpf/verifier.c: In function 'bpf_check':
kernel/bpf/verifier.c:4320:29: error: array subscript is above array bounds [-Werror=array-bounds]

This adds a check to the start of the function as a workaround.
I would assume that the function is never called in that configuration,
so the warning is probably harmless.
