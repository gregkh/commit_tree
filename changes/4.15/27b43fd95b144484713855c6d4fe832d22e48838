crypto: marvell - Remove the old mv_cesa driver

All defconfigs selecting the old driver have been patched to select
the new one instead. We can now remove the old driver along with the
allhwsupports module parameter in the new driver that was used to
check whether the new driver was allowed to take control of the CESA
engine or not.
