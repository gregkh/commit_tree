ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_max98090: add gpio-based jack detection

Jacks are created but only enabled when the external TI chip is
present, this probably never worked as well. Forklift the gpio-based
code from the legacy byt-max98090 driver, with however a less strict
error check. It's fine to let users enjoy their device even if
jack detection doesn't work - it almost never does without quirks...

Tested on Lenovo100s
