drm/amdgpu: Fix a bug in amdgpu_fill_buffer()

When max_bytes is not 8 bytes aligned and bo size is larger than
max_bytes, the last 8 bytes in a ttm node may be left unchanged.
For example, on pre SDMA 4.0, max_bytes = 0x1fffff, and the bo size
is 0x200000, the problem will happen.

In order to fix the problem, we separately store the max nums of
PTEs/PDEs a single operation can set in amdgpu_vm_pte_funcs
structure, rather than inferring it from bytes limit of SDMA
constant fill, i.e. fill_max_bytes.

Together with the fix, we replace the hard code value "10" in
amdgpu_vm_bo_update_mapping() with the corresponding values from
structure amdgpu_vm_pte_funcs.
