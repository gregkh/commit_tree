mm, memcg: fix mem_cgroup_swapout() for THPs

Commit d6810d730022 ("memcg, THP, swap: make mem_cgroup_swapout()
support THP") changed mem_cgroup_swapout() to support transparent huge
page (THP).

However the patch missed one location which should be changed for
correctly handling THPs.  The resulting bug will cause the memory
cgroups whose THPs were swapped out to become zombies on deletion.
