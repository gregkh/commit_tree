jump_label: Invoke jump_label_test() via early_initcall()

Fengguang Wu reported that running the rcuperf test during boot can cause
the jump_label_test() to hit a WARN_ON(). The issue is that the core jump
label code relies on kernel_text_address() to detect when it can no longer
update branches that may be contained in __init sections. The
kernel_text_address() in turn assumes that if the system_state variable is
greter than or equal to SYSTEM_RUNNING then __init sections are no longer
valid (since the assumption is that they have been freed). However, when
rcuperf is setup to run in early boot it can call kernel_power_off() which
sets the system_state to SYSTEM_POWER_OFF.

Since rcuperf initialization is invoked via a module_init(), we can make
the dependency of jump_label_test() needing to complete before rcuperf
explicit by calling it via early_initcall().
