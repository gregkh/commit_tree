x86/MCE/AMD: Always give panic severity for UC errors in kernel context

The AMD severity grading function was introduced in kernel 4.1. The
current logic can possibly give MCE_AR_SEVERITY for uncorrectable
errors in kernel context. The system may then get stuck in a loop as
memory_failure() will try to handle the bad kernel memory and find it
busy.

Return MCE_PANIC_SEVERITY for all UC errors IN_KERNEL context on AMD
systems.

After:

  b2f9d678e28c ("x86/mce: Check for faults tagged in EXTABLE_CLASS_FAULT exception table entries")

was accepted in v4.6, this issue was masked because of the tail-end attempt
at kernel mode recovery in the #MC handler.

However, uncorrectable errors IN_KERNEL context should always be considered
unrecoverable and cause a panic.
