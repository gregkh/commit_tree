locking/lockdep: Add a boot parameter allowing unwind in cross-release and disable it by default

Johan Hovold reported a heavy performance regression caused by lockdep
cross-release:

Currently cross-release performs unwind on every acquisition, but that
is very expensive.

This patch makes unwind optional and disables it by default and only
records acquire_ip.

Full stack traces are sometimes required for full analysis, in which
case a boot paramter, crossrelease_fullstack, can be specified.

On my qemu Ubuntu machine (x86_64, 4 cores, 512M), the regression was
fixed. We measure boot times with 'perf stat --null --repeat 10 $QEMU',
where $QEMU launches a kernel with init=/bin/true:

1. No lockdep enabled:

 Performance counter stats for 'qemu_booting_time.sh bzImage' (10 runs):

       2.756558155 seconds time elapsed                    ( +-  0.09% )

2. Lockdep enabled:

 Performance counter stats for 'qemu_booting_time.sh bzImage' (10 runs):

       2.968710420 seconds time elapsed                    ( +-  0.12% )

3. Lockdep enabled + cross-release enabled:

 Performance counter stats for 'qemu_booting_time.sh bzImage' (10 runs):

       3.153839636 seconds time elapsed                    ( +-  0.31% )

4. Lockdep enabled + cross-release enabled + this patch applied:

 Performance counter stats for 'qemu_booting_time.sh bzImage' (10 runs):

       2.963669551 seconds time elapsed                    ( +-  0.11% )

I.e. lockdep cross-release performance is now indistinguishable from
vanilla lockdep.
