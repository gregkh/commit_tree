powerpc/64s/radix: Optimize TLB range flush barriers

Short range flushes issue a sequences of tlbie(l) instructions for
individual effective addresses. These do not all require individual
barrier sequences, only one covering all tlbie(l) instructions.

Commit f7327e0ba3 ("powerpc/mm/radix: Remove unnecessary ptesync")
made a similar optimization for tlbiel for PID flushing.

For tlbie, the ISA says:

    The tlbsync instruction provides an ordering function for the
    effects of all tlbie instructions executed by the thread executing
    the tlbsync instruction, with respect to the memory barrier
    created by a subsequent ptesync instruction executed by the same
    thread.

Time to munmap 30 pages of memory (after mmap, touch):
         local   global
vanilla  10.9us  22.3us
patched   3.4us  14.4us
