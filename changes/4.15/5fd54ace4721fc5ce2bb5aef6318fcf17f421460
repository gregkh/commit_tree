USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/

It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.

Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
instead of the full boiler plate text.

This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.
