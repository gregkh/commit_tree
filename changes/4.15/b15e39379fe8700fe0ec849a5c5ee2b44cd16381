[media] media: lirc_dev: merge struct irctl into struct lirc_dev

The use of two separate structs (lirc_dev aka lirc_driver and irctl) makes
it much harder to follow the proper lifetime of the various structs and
necessitates hacks such as keeping a copy of struct lirc_dev inside
struct irctl.

Merging the two structs means that lirc_dev can properly manage the
lifetime of the resulting struct and simplifies the code at the same time.
