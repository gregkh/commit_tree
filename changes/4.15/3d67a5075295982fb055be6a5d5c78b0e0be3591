net: thunderx: fix double free error

This patch fixes an error in memory allocation/freeing in
ThunderX PF driver.

I moved the allocation to the probe() function and made it managed.

>From the Colin's email:

While running static analysis on linux-next with CoverityScan I found 3
double free errors in the Cavium thunder driver.

The issue occurs on the err_disable_device: label of function nic_probe
when nic_free_lmacmem(nic) is called and a double free occurs on
nic->duplex, nic->link and nic->speed.  This occurs when nic_init_hw()
fails:

        /* Initialize hardware */
        err = nic_init_hw(nic);
        if (err)
                goto err_release_regions;

nic_init_hw() calls nic_get_hw_info() and this calls nic_free_lmacmem()
if any of the allocations fail. This free'ing occurs again by the call
to nic_free_lmacmem() on the err_release_regions exit path in nic_probe().
