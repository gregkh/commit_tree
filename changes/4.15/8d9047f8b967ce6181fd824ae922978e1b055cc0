s390/runtime instrumentation: simplify task exit handling

Free data structures required for runtime instrumentation from
arch_release_task_struct(). This allows to simplify the code a bit,
and also makes the semantics a bit easier: arch_release_task_struct()
is never called from the task that is being removed.

In addition this allows to get rid of exit_thread() in a later patch.
