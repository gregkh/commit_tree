iommu/iova: Add rbtree anchor node

Add a permanent dummy IOVA reservation to the rbtree, such that we can
always access the top of the address space instantly. The immediate
benefit is that we remove the overhead of the rb_last() traversal when
not using the cached node, but it also paves the way for further
simplifications.
