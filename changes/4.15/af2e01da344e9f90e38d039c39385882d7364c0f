docs: fix, intel_guc_loader.c has been moved to intel_guc_fw.c

With commit d9e2e0143c the 'GuC-specific firmware loader' doc
section was removed from intel_guc_loader.c without a
replacement.  So lets remove it from the Kernel-doc::

  .. kernel-doc:: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_guc_loader.c
     :doc: GuC-specific firmware loader

With commit e8668bbcb0 intel_guc_loader.c was renamed to to
intel_guc_fw.c and to name just one, intel_guc_init_hw() was
renamed to intel_guc_fw_upload(). Since we get errors in the
Sphinx build like:

- Error: Cannot open file ./drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_guc_loader.c

Change the kernel-doc directive from intel_guc_loader.c to
intel_guc_fw.c
