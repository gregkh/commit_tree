s390/qeth: build max size GSO skbs on L2 devices

The current GSO skb size limit was copy&pasted over from the L3 path,
where it is needed due to a TSO limitation.
As L2 devices don't offer TSO support (and thus all GSO skbs are
segmented before they reach the driver), there's no reason to restrict
the stack in how large it may build the GSO skbs.
