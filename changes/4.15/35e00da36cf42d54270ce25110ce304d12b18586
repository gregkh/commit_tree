tcp: do not clear again skb->csum in tcp_init_nondata_skb()

tcp_init_nondata_skb() is fed with freshly allocated skbs.
They already have a cleared csum field, no need to clear it again.

This is based on Neal review on commit 3b11775033dc ("tcp: do not mangle
skb->cb[] in tcp_make_synack()"), noticing I did not clear skb->csum.
