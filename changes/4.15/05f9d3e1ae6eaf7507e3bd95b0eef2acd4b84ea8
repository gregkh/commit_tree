igb: Add support for CBS offload

This patch adds support for Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) qdisc offload
from Traffic Control system. This support enable us to leverage the
Forwarding and Queuing for Time-Sensitive Streams (FQTSS) features
from Intel i210 Ethernet Controller. FQTSS is the former 802.1Qav
standard which was merged into 802.1Q in 2014. It enables traffic
prioritization and bandwidth reservation via the Credit-Based Shaper
which is implemented in hardware by i210 controller.

The patch introduces the igb_setup_tc() function which implements the
support for CBS qdisc hardware offload in the IGB driver. CBS offload
is the only traffic control offload supported by the driver at the
moment.

FQTSS transmission mode from i210 controller is automatically enabled
by the IGB driver when the CBS is enabled for the first hardware
queue. Likewise, FQTSS mode is automatically disabled when CBS is
disabled for the last hardware queue. Changing FQTSS mode requires NIC
reset.

FQTSS feature is supported by i210 controller only.
