usb/gadget/snps_udc_core: Convert timers to use timer_setup()

In preparation for unconditionally passing the struct timer_list pointer to
all timer callbacks, switch to using the new timer_setup() and from_timer()
to pass the timer pointer explicitly.

If the probe fails, udc_remove() will not be called, so there is no
reason to make del_timer_sync() calls conditional. As a result, use of
the .data field can be dropped, in support of making removing this field
entirely from struct timer_list.
