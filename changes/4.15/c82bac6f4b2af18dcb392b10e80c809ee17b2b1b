NFSv4: Don't try to CLOSE if the stateid 'other' field has changed

If the stateid is no longer recognised on the server, either due to a
restart, or due to a competing CLOSE call, then we do not have to
retry. Any open contexts that triggered a reopen of the file, will
also act as triggers for any CLOSE for the updated stateids.
