rtc: m41t80: avoid i2c read in m41t80_sqw_is_prepared

This is a little more efficient and avoids the warning

 WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
 4.14.0-rc7-00010 #16 Not tainted
 ------------------------------------------------------
 kworker/2:1/70 is trying to acquire lock:
  (prepare_lock){+.+.}, at: [<c049300c>] clk_prepare_lock+0x80/0xf4

 but task is already holding lock:
  (i2c_register_adapter){+.+.}, at: [<c0690b04>]
		i2c_adapter_lock_bus+0x14/0x18

 which lock already depends on the new lock.

 the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:

 -> #1 (i2c_register_adapter){+.+.}:
        rt_mutex_lock+0x44/0x5c
        i2c_adapter_lock_bus+0x14/0x18
        i2c_transfer+0xa8/0xbc
        i2c_smbus_xfer+0x20c/0x5d8
        i2c_smbus_read_byte_data+0x38/0x48
