fs, mm: account filp cache to kmemcg

The allocations from filp cache can be directly triggered by userspace
applications.  A buggy application can consume a significant amount of
unaccounted system memory.  Though we have not noticed such buggy
applications in our production but upon close inspection, we found that
a lot of machines spend very significant amount of memory on these
caches.

One way to limit allocations from filp cache is to set system level
limit of maximum number of open files.  However this limit is shared
between different users on the system and one user can hog this
resource.  To cater that, we can charge filp to kmemcg and set the
maximum limit very high and let the memory limit of each user limit the
number of files they can open and indirectly limiting their allocations
from filp cache.

One side effect of this change is that it will allow _sysctl() to return
ENOMEM and the man page of _sysctl() does not specify that.  However the
man page also discourages to use _sysctl() at all.
