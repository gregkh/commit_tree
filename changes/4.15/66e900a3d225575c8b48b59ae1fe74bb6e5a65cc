spi: atmel: fixed spin_lock usage inside atmel_spi_remove

The only part of atmel_spi_remove which needs to be atomic is hardware
reset.

atmel_spi_stop_dma calls dma_terminate_all and this needs interrupts
enabled.
atmel_spi_release_dma calls dma_release_channel and dma_release_channel
locks a mutex inside of spin_lock.

So the call of these functions can't be inside a spin_lock.
