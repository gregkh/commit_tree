drm/syncobj: Stop reusing the same struct file for all syncobj -> fd

The vk cts test:
dEQP-VK.api.external.semaphore.opaque_fd.export_multiple_times_temporary

triggers a lot of
VFS: Close: file count is 0

Dave pointed out that clearing the syncobj->file from
drm_syncobj_file_release() was sufficient to silence the test, but that
opens a can of worm since we assumed that the syncobj->file was never
unset. Stop trying to reuse the same struct file for every fd pointing
to the drm_syncobj, and allocate one file for each fd instead.

v2: Fixup return handling of drm_syncobj_fd_to_handle
v2.1: [airlied: fix possible syncobj ref race]
