ftrace/kallsyms: Have /proc/kallsyms show saved mod init functions

If a module is loaded while tracing is enabled, then there's a possibility
that the module init functions were traced. These functions have their name
and address stored by ftrace such that it can translate the function address
that is written into the buffer into a human readable function name.

As userspace tools may be doing the same, they need a way to map function
names to their address as well. This is done through reading /proc/kallsyms.
