irqchip/brcmstb-l2: Remove some processing from the handler

Saving the generic chip pointer in the brcmstb_l2_intc_data prevents
the need to call irq_get_domain_generic_chip().  Also don't need to
save parent_irq and base there since local variables in the
brcmstb_l2_intc_of_init() function are just as good.

The handle_edge_irq flow or chained_irq_enter takes care of the
acknowledgment of the interrupt so it is redundant to clear it in
brcmstb_l2_intc_irq_handle().

irq_linear_revmap() is a fast path equivalent of irq_find_mapping()
that is appropriate to use for domain controllers of this type.

Defining irq_mask_ack is slightly more efficient than just
implementing irq_mask and irq_ack separately.
