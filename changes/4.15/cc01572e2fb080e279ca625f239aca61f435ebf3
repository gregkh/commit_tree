xfrm: Add SA to hardware at the end of xfrm_state_construct()

Current code configures the hardware with a new SA before the state has been
fully initialized. During this time interval, an incoming ESP packet can cause
a crash due to a NULL dereference. More specifically, xfrm_input() considers
the packet as valid, and yet, anti-replay mechanism is not initialized.

Move hardware configuration to the end of xfrm_state_construct(), and mark
the state as valid once the SA is fully initialized.
