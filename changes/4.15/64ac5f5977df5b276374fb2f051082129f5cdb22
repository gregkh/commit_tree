tipc: refactor function filter_rcv()

In the following commits we will need to handle multiple incoming and
rejected/returned buffers in the function socket.c::filter_rcv().
As a preparation for this, we generalize the function by handling
buffer queues instead of individual buffers. We also introduce a
help function tipc_skb_reject(), and rename filter_rcv() to
tipc_sk_filter_rcv() in line with other functions in socket.c.
