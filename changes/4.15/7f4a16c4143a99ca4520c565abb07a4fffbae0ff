ARM: dts: r8a7792: Use R-Car GPIO Gen2 fallback compat string

Use newly added R-Car GPIO Gen2 fallback compat string
in place of now deprecated non-generation specific
R-Car GPIO fallback compat string in the DT of the r8a7792 SoC.

This should have no run-time effect as the driver matches against
the per-SoC compat string before considering the fallback compat string.
