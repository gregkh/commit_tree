sch_sfq: fix null pointer dereference at timer expiration

While converting sch_sfq to use timer_setup(), the commit cdeabbb88134
("net: sched: Convert timers to use timer_setup()") forgot to
initialize the 'sch' field. As a result, the timer callback tries to
dereference a NULL pointer, and the kernel does oops.

Fix it initializing such field at qdisc creation time.
