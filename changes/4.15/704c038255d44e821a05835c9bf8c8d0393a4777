iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Ensure we sync STE when only changing config field

The SMMUv3 architecture permits caching of data structures deemed to be
"reachable" by the SMU, which includes STEs marked as invalid. When
transitioning an STE to a bypass/fault configuration at init or detach
time, we mistakenly elide the CMDQ_OP_CFGI_STE operation in some cases,
therefore potentially leaving the old STE state cached in the SMMU.

This patch fixes the problem by ensuring that we perform the
CMDQ_OP_CFGI_STE operation irrespective of the validity of the previous
STE.
