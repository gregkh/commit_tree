x86/init: Add intr_mode_init to x86_init_ops

X86 and XEN initialize interrupt delivery mode in different way.

To avoid conditionals, add a new x86_init_ops function which defaults to
the standard function and can be overridden by the early XEN platform code.

[ tglx: Folded the XEN part which was a separate patch to preserve
  	bisectability ]
