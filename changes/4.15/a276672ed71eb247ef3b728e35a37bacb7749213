IB/hfi1: Prohibit invalid Init to Armed state transition

It is invalid to change Link state from Init to Armed if
IsSmConfigurationStarted bit is not set in Attribute modifier
for Set subnet management method in case of PortInfo
and PortStateInfo attribute.
Set response MAD status field bits accordingly to react correctly
in such situations and avoid changing Link state.
