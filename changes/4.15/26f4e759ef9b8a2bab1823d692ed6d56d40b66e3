s390/disassembler: correct disassembly lines alignment

176.718956 Krnl Code: 00000000004d38b0: a54c0018        llihh   %r4,24

           ^
Using a tab to align disassembly lines which follow the first line with
"Krnl Code: " doesn't always work, e.g. if there is a prefix (timestamp
or syslog prefix) which is not 8 chars aligned. Go back to alignment
with spaces.
