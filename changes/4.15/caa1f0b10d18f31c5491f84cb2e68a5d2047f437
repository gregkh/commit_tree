s390/qeth: add VNICC enable/disable support

HiperSocket devices allow enabling and disabling so called VNIC
Characteristics (VNICC) that influence how the underlying hardware
handles packets. These VNICCs are:

* Flooding VNICC: Flooding allows specifying if packets to unknown
  destination MAC addresses are received by the qeth device.

* Multicast flooding VNICC: Multicast flooding allows specifying if
  packets to multicast MAC addresses are received by the qeth device.

* Learning VNICC: If learning is enabled on a qeth device, the device
  learns the source MAC addresses of outgoing packets and incoming
  packets to those learned MAC addresses are received.

* Takeover setvmac VNICC: If takeover setvmac is configured on a qeth
  device, the MAC address of this device can be configured on a
  different qeth device with the setvmac IPA command.

* Takeover by learning VNICC: If takeover learning is enabled on a qeth
  device, the MAC address of this device can be learned (learning VNICC)
  on a different qeth device.

* BridgePort invisible VNICC: If BridgePort invisible is enabled on a
  qeth device, (1) packets from this device are not sent to a BridgePort
  enabled qeth device and (2) packets coming from a BridgePort enabled
  qeth device are not received by this device.

* Receive broadcast VNICC: Receive broadcast allows configuring if a
  qeth device receives packets with the broadcast destination MAC
  address.

This patch adds support for the IPA commands that are required to enable
and disable these VNIC characteristics on qeth devices. As a
prerequisite, it also adds the query commands IPA command.

The query commands IPA command allows requesting the supported commands
for each characteristic from the underlying hardware.

Additionally, this patch provides users with a sysfs user interface to
enable/disable the VNICCs mentioned above.
