ata: mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

In cases where a "drop through" comment was already in place, I replaced
it  with a proper "fall through" comment, which is what GCC is expecting
to find.
