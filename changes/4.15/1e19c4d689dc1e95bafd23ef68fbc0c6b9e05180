net: vrf: Add support for sends to local broadcast address

Sukumar reported that sends to the local broadcast address
(255.255.255.255) are broken. Check for the address in vrf driver
and do not redirect to the VRF device - similar to multicast
packets.

With this change sockets can use SO_BINDTODEVICE to specify an
egress interface and receive responses. Note: the egress interface
can not be a VRF device but needs to be the enslaved device.
