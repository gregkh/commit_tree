rcutorture: Add interrupt-disable capability to stall-warning tests

When rcutorture sees the rcutorture.stall_cpu kernel boot parameter,
it loops with preemption disabled, which does in fact normally
generate an RCU CPU stall warning message.  However, there are test
scenarios that need the stalling CPU to have interrupts disabled.
This commit therefore adds an rcutorture.stall_cpu_irqsoff kernel
boot parameter that causes the stalling CPU to disable interrupts.
