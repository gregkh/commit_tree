Drivers: hv: vmbus: Make panic reporting to be more useful

Hyper-V allows the guest to report panic and the guest can pass additional
information. All this is logged on the host. Currently Linux is passing back
information that is not particularly useful. Make the following changes:

1. Windows uses crash MSR P0 to report bugcheck code. Follow the same
convention for Linux as well.
2. It will be useful to know the gust ID of the Linux guest that has
paniced. Pass back this information.

These changes will help in better supporting Linux on Hyper-V
