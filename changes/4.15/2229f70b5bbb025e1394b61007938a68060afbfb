x86/xen/time: setup vcpu 0 time info page

In order to support pvclock vdso on xen we need to setup the time
info page for vcpu 0 and register the page with Xen using the
VCPUOP_register_vcpu_time_memory_area hypercall. This hypercall
will also forcefully update the pvti which will set some of the
necessary flags for vdso. Afterwards we check if it supports the
PVCLOCK_TSC_STABLE_BIT flag which is mandatory for having
vdso/vsyscall support. And if so, it will set the cpu 0 pvti that
will be later on used when mapping the vdso image.

The xen headers are also updated to include the new hypercall for
registering the secondary vcpu_time_info struct.
