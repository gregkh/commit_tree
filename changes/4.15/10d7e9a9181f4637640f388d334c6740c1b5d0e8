thermal/drivers/hisi: Remove costly sensor inspection

The sensor is all setup, bind, resetted, acked, etc... every single second.

That was the way to workaround a problem with the interrupt bouncing again and
again.

With the following changes, we fix all in one:

 - Do the setup, one time, at probe time

 - Add the IRQF_ONESHOT, ack the interrupt in the threaded handler

 - Remove the interrupt handler

 - Set the correct value for the LAG register

 - Remove all the irq_enabled stuff in the code as the interruption
   handling is fixed

 - Remove the 3ms delay

 - Reorder the initialization routine to be in the right order

It ends up to a nicer code and more efficient, the 3-5ms delay is removed from
the get_temp() path.
