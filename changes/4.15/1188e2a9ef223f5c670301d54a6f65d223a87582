cfg80211: don't print log output for building shipped-certs

Building an allmodconfig kernel with 'make -s' now prints a single line:

  GEN     net/wireless/shipped-certs.c

Using '$(kecho)' here will skip the output with 'make -s' but
otherwise keeps printing it, which is consistent with how we
handle all the other output.
