md: fix deadlock error in recent patch.

A recent patch aimed to cause md_write_start() to fail (rather than
block) when the mddev was suspending, so as to avoid deadlocks.
Unfortunately the test in wait_event() was wrong, and it didn't change
behaviour at all.

We wait_event() must wait until the metadata is written OR the array is
suspending.
