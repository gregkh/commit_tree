GFS2: Make height info part of metapath

This patch eliminates height parameters from function gfs2_bmap_alloc.
Function find_metapath determines the metapath's "find height", also
known as the desired height. Function lookup_metapath determines the
metapath's "actual height", previously known as starting height or
sheight. Function gfs2_bmap_alloc now gets both height values from
the metapath. This simplification was done as a step toward switching
the block_map functions to using iomap. The bh_map responsibilities
are also removed from function gfs2_bmap_alloc for the same reason.
