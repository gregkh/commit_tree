Revert "dt-bindings: mtd: add sst25wf040b and en25s64 to sip-nor list"

This reverts commit b07815d4eaf658b683c345d6e643895a20d92f29.

The reverted commit was merged into v4-15-rc1 by mistake: it was taken
from the IMX tree but the patch has never been sent to linux-mtd nor
reviewed by any spi-nor maintainers.

Actually, it would have been rejected since we add new values for the
'compatible' DT property only for SPI NOR memories that don't support
the JEDEC READ ID op code (0x9F).

Both en25s64 and sst25wf040b support the JEDEC READ ID op code, hence
should use the "jedec,spi-nor" string alone as 'compatible' value.
