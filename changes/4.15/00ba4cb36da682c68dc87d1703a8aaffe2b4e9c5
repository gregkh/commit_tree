bridge: also trigger RTM_NEWLINK when interface is released from bridge

Currently, when an interface is released from a bridge via
ioctl(), we get a RTM_DELLINK event through netlink:

Deleted 2: dummy0: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 master bridge0 state UNKNOWN
    link/ether 6e:23:c2:54:3a:b3

Userspace has to interpret that as a removal from the bridge, not as a
complete removal of the interface. When an bridged interface is
completely removed, we get two events:

Deleted 2: dummy0: <BROADCAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 master bridge0 state DOWN
    link/ether 6e:23:c2:54:3a:b3
Deleted 2: dummy0: <BROADCAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default
    link/ether 6e:23:c2:54:3a:b3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

In constrast, when an interface is released from a bond, we get a
RTM_NEWLINK with only the new characteristics (no master):

3: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master bond0 state UNKNOWN group default
    link/ether ae:dc:7a:8c:9a:3c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
    link/ether ae:dc:7a:8c:9a:3c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
4: bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether ae:dc:7a:8c:9a:3c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default
    link/ether ae:dc:7a:8c:9a:3c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default
    link/ether ca:c8:7b:66:f8:25 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
4: bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether ae:dc:7a:8c:9a:3c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Userland may be confused by the fact we say a link is deleted while
its characteristics are only modified. A first solution would have
been to turn the RTM_DELLINK event in del_nbp() into a RTM_NEWLINK
event. However, maybe some piece of userland is relying on this
RTM_DELLINK to detect when a bridged interface is released. Instead,
we also emit a RTM_NEWLINK event once the interface is
released (without master info).

Deleted 2: dummy0: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 master bridge0 state UNKNOWN
    link/ether 8a:bb:e7:94:b1:f8
2: dummy0: <BROADCAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default
    link/ether 8a:bb:e7:94:b1:f8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

This is done only when using ioctl(). When using Netlink, such an
event is already automatically emitted in do_setlink().
