net: sched: fix clsact init error path

Since in qdisc_create, the destroy op is called when init fails, we
don't do cleanup in init and leave it up to destroy.
This fixes use-after-free when trying to put already freed block.

Fixes: 6e40cf2d4dee ("net: sched: use extended variants of block_get/put in ingress and clsact qdiscs")
