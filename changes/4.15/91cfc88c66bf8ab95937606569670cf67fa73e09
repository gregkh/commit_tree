x86: Use __nostackprotect for sme_encrypt_kernel

Commit bacf6b499e11 ("x86/mm: Use a struct to reduce parameters for SME
PGD mapping") moved some parameters into a structure.

The structure was large enough to trigger the stack protection canary in
sme_encrypt_kernel which doesn't work this early, causing reboots.

Mark sme_encrypt_kernel appropriately to not use the canary.
