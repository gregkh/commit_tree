gpio: Automatically add lockdep keys

In order to avoid lockdep boilerplate in individual drivers, turn the
gpiochip_add_data() function into a macro that creates a unique class
key for each driver.

Note that this has the slight disadvantage of adding a key for each
driver registered with the system. However, these keys are 8 bytes in
size, which is negligible and a small price to pay for generic
infrastructure.
