gpio: Implement tighter IRQ chip integration

Currently GPIO drivers are required to add the GPIO chip and its
corresponding IRQ chip separately, which can result in a lot of
boilerplate. Use the newly introduced struct gpio_irq_chip, embedded in
struct gpio_chip, that drivers can fill in if they want the GPIO core
to automatically register the IRQ chip associated with a GPIO chip.
