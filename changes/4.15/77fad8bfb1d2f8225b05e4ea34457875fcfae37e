selftests/powerpc: Check FP/VEC on exception in TM

Add a self test to check if FP/VEC/VSX registers are sane (restored
correctly) after a FP/VEC/VSX unavailable exception is caught during a
transaction.

This test checks all possibilities in a thread regarding the combination
of MSR.[FP|VEC] states in a thread and for each scenario raises a
FP/VEC/VSX unavailable exception in transactional state, verifying if
vs0 and vs32 registers, which are representatives of FP/VEC/VSX reg
sets, are not corrupted.
