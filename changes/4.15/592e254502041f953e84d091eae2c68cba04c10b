mm: Handle 0 flags in _calc_vm_trans() macro

_calc_vm_trans() does not handle the situation when some of the passed
flags are 0 (which can happen if these VM flags do not make sense for
the architecture). Improve the _calc_vm_trans() macro to return 0 in
such situation. Since all passed flags are constant, this does not add
any runtime overhead.
