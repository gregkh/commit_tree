ext4: Support for synchronous DAX faults

We return IOMAP_F_DIRTY flag from ext4_iomap_begin() when asked to
prepare blocks for writing and the inode has some uncommitted metadata
changes. In the fault handler ext4_dax_fault() we then detect this case
(through VM_FAULT_NEEDDSYNC return value) and call helper
dax_finish_sync_fault() to flush metadata changes and insert page table
entry. Note that this will also dirty corresponding radix tree entry
which is what we want - fsync(2) will still provide data integrity
guarantees for applications not using userspace flushing. And
applications using userspace flushing can avoid calling fsync(2) and
thus avoid the performance overhead.
