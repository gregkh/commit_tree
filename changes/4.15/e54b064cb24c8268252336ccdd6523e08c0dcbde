nvme: move the dying queue check from cancel to completion

With multipath we don't want a hard DNR bit on a request that is cancelled
by a controller reset, but instead want to be able to retry it on another
patch.  To archive this don't always set the DNR bit when the queue is
dying in nvme_cancel_request, but defer that decision to
nvme_req_needs_retry.  Note that it applies to any command there and not
just cancelled commands, but one the queue is dying that is the right
thing to do anyway.
