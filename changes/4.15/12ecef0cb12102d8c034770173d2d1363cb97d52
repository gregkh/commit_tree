tracing: Reverse the order of trace_types_lock and event_mutex

In order to make future changes where we need to call
tracing_set_clock() from within an event command, the order of
trace_types_lock and event_mutex must be reversed, as the event command
will hold event_mutex and the trace_types_lock is taken from within
tracing_set_clock().
