ipv4: ipmr: Add the parent ID field to VIF struct

In order to allow the ipmr module to do partial multicast forwarding
according to the device parent ID, add the device parent ID field to the
VIF struct. This way, the forwarding path can use the parent ID field
without invoking switchdev calls, which requires the RTNL lock.

When a new VIF is added, set the device parent ID field in it by invoking
the switchdev_port_attr_get call.
