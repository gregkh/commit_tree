ASoC: rsnd: ssi: fix race condition in rsnd_ssi_pointer_update

Currently there is race condition between set of byte_pos and wrap
it around when new buffer starts. If .pointer is called in-between
it will result in inconsistent pointer position be returned
from .pointer callback.

This patch increments buffer pointer atomically to avoid this issue.
