iwlwifi: fix PCI IDs and configuration mapping for 9000 series

A lot of PCI IDs were missing and there were some problems with the
configuration and firmware selection for devices on the 9000 series.
Fix the firmware selection by adding files for the B-steps; add
configuration for some integrated devices; and add a bunch of PCI IDs
(mostly for integrated devices) that were missing from the driver's
list.

Without this patch, a lot of devices will not be recognized or will
try to load the wrong firmware file.
