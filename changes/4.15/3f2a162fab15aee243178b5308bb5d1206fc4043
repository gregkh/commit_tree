rtlwifi: fix uninitialized rtlhal->last_suspend_sec time

We set rtlhal->last_suspend_sec to an uninitialized stack variable,
but unfortunately gcc never warned about this, I only found it
while working on another patch. I opened a gcc bug for this.

Presumably the value of rtlhal->last_suspend_sec is not all that
important, but it does get used, so we probably want the
patch backported to stable kernels.
