NFS: Avoid RCU usage in tracepoints

There isn't an obvious way to acquire and release the RCU lock during a
tracepoint, so we can't use the rpc_peeraddr2str() function here.
Instead, rely on the client's cl_hostname, which should have similar
enough information without needing an rcu_dereference().
