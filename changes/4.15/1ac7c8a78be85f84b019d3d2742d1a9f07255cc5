usbip: fix usbip attach to find a port that matches the requested speed

usbip attach fails to find a free port when the device on the first port
is a USB_SPEED_SUPER device and non-super speed device is being attached.
It keeps checking the first port and returns without a match getting stuck
in a loop.

Fix it check to find the first port with matching speed.
