net: igmp: fix source address check for IGMPv3 reports

Commit "net: igmp: Use correct source address on IGMPv3 reports"
introduced a check to validate the source address of locally generated
IGMPv3 packets.
Instead of checking the local interface address directly, it uses
inet_ifa_match(fl4->saddr, ifa), which checks if the address is on the
local subnet (or equal to the point-to-point address if used).

This breaks for point-to-point interfaces, so check against
ifa->ifa_local directly.
