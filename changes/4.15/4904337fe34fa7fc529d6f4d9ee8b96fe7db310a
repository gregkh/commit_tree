ARM: dts: sunxi: Restore EMAC changes (boards)

The original dwmac-sun8i DT bindings have some issue on how to handle
integrated PHY and was reverted in last RC of 4.13.
But now we have a solution so we need to get back that was reverted.

This patch restore all boards DT about dwmac-sun8i
This reverts partially commit fe45174b72ae ("arm: dts: sunxi: Revert EMAC changes")
