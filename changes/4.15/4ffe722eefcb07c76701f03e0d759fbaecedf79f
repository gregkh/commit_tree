thunderbolt: Add polling mode for rings

In order to support things like networking over Thunderbolt cable, there
needs to be a way to switch the ring to a mode where it can be polled
with the interrupt masked. We implement such mode so that the caller can
allocate a ring by passing pointer to a function that is then called
when an interrupt is triggered. Completed frames can be fetched using
tb_ring_poll() and the interrupt can be re-enabled when the caller is
finished with polling by using tb_ring_poll_complete().
