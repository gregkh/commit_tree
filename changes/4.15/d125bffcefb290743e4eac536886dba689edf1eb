arm64: Fix static use of function graph

Function graph does not work currently when CONFIG_DYNAMIC_TRACE is not
set. This is because ftrace_function_trace is not always set to ftrace_stub
when function_graph is in use.

Do not skip checking of graph tracer functions when ftrace_function_trace
is set.
