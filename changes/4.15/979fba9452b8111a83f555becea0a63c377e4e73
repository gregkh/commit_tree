ACPICA: acpiexec: Add testability of deferred table verification

ACPICA commit 04c28c7549e694ea85f40bcc816039e5fbb4169c

This patch adds testability of deferred table verification mechanism. As
acpiexec uses dynamically allocated root table list from its very early
stage, a change to acpi_reallocate_root_table() is required to allow deferred
table verification mechanism to be triggered in such an environment. Note
that acpi_gbl_enable_table_validation is still TRUE by default, thus:
1. Developers need to manually set acpi_gbl_enable_table_validation to FALSE
   for acpiexec to enable this test.
2. For all other OSPMs (Linux, BSDs, etc.), this commit is a no-op.
