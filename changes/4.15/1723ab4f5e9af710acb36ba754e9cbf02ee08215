net: dsa: mv88e6060: fix switch MAC address

The 88E6060 Ethernet switch always transmits the multicast bit of the
switch MAC address as a zero. It re-uses the corresponding bit 8 of the
register "Switch MAC Address Register Bytes 0 & 1" for "DiffAddr".

If the "DiffAddr" bit is 0, then all ports transmit the same source
address. If it is set to 1, then bit 2:0 are used for the port number.

The mv88e6060 driver is currently wrongly shifting the MAC address byte
0 by 9. To fix this, shift it by 8 as usual and clear its bit 0.
