vsprintf: don't use 'restricted_pointer()' when not restricting

Instead, just fall back on the new '%p' behavior which hashes the
pointer.

Otherwise, '%pK' - that was intended to mark a pointer as restricted -
just ends up leaking pointers that a normal '%p' wouldn't leak.  Which
just make the whole thing pointless.

I suspect we should actually get rid of '%pK' entirely, and make it just
work as '%p' regardless, but this is the minimal obvious fix.  People
who actually use 'kptr_restrict' should weigh in on which behavior they
want.
