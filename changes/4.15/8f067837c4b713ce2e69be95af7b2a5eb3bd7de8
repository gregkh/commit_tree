drm/i915: Display WA #1133 WaFbcSkipSegments:cnl, glk

Skip compressing 1 segment at the end of the frame,
avoid a pixel count mismatch nuke event when last active
pixel and dummy pixel has same color for Odd Plane
Width / Height.

For both platforms Gemini Lake and Cannon Lake.

v2: Use function-like macro and also use mask to clean
    to make sure bit 11 is 0. (Suggested by Paulo).
v3: Add Display WA notation and also apply for GLK.
    Both Forgotten on v2.
    Using "GLK_" prefix since GLK came before CNL.
v4: Forgot to "|=" when moving directly macro to masked
    val. (Noticed by Paulo.)
v5: Rebased on top of 0a46ddd57c9e ("drm/i915/cnp: Wa 1181:
    Fix Backlight issue")
