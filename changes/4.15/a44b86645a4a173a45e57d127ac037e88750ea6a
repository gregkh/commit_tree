coccinelle: api: detect identical chip data arrays

This semantic patch detects duplicate arrays declared using BQ27XXX_DATA
within a single structure.  It is currently specific to the file
drivers/power/supply/bq27xxx_battery.c.  Nevertheless, having the script in
the kernel will allow others to check their code if the data structures
change in the future.
