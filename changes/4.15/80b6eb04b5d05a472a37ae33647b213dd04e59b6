arm64: Don't walk page table for user faults in do_mem_abort

Commit 42dbf54e8890 ("arm64: consistently log ESR and page table")
dumps page table entries for user faults hitting do_bad entries in the
fault handler table. Whilst this shouldn't really happen in practice,
it's not beyond the realms of possibility if e.g. running an old kernel
on a new CPU.

Generally, we want to avoid exposing physical addresses under the control
of userspace (see commit bf396c09c24 ("arm64: mm: don't print out page
table entries on EL0 faults")), so walk the page tables only on exceptions
from EL1.
