remove task and stack pointer printout from oops dump

Geert Uytterhoeven reported a NFS oops, and pointed out that some of the
numbers were hashed and useless.

We could just turn them from '%p' into '%px', but those numbers are
really just legacy, and useless even when not hashed.

So just remove them entirely.
