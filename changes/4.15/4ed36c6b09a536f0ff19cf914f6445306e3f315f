xfs: inline xfs_shift_file_space into callers

The code is sufficiently different for the insert vs collapse cases both
in xfs_shift_file_space itself and the callers that untangling them will
make life a lot easier down the road.

We still keep a common helper for flushing all data and COW state to get
the inode into the right shape for shifting the extents around.
