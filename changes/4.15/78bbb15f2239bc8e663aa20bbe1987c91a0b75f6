8021q: fix a memory leak for VLAN 0 device

A vlan device with vid 0 is allow to creat by not able to be fully
cleaned up by unregister_vlan_dev() which checks for vlan_id!=0.

Also, VLAN 0 is probably not a valid number and it is kinda
"reserved" for HW accelerating devices, but it is probably too
late to reject it from creation even if makes sense. Instead,
just remove the check in unregister_vlan_dev().
