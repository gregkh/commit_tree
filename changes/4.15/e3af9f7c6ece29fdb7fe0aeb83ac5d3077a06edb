ARM64: dts: marvell: armada-cp110: Fix clock resources for various node

On the CP modules we found on Armada 7K/8K, many IP block actually also
need a "functional" clock (from the bus). This patch add them which allows
to fix some issues hanging the kernel:

If Ethernet and sdhci driver are built as modules and sdhci was loaded
first then the kernel hang.

optional bus clock")
