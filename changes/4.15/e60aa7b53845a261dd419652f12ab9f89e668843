iommu/iova: Extend rbtree node caching

The cached node mechanism provides a significant performance benefit for
allocations using a 32-bit DMA mask, but in the case of non-PCI devices
or where the 32-bit space is full, the loss of this benefit can be
significant - on large systems there can be many thousands of entries in
the tree, such that walking all the way down to find free space every
time becomes increasingly awful.

Maintain a similar cached node for the whole IOVA space as a superset of
the 32-bit space so that performance can remain much more consistent.
