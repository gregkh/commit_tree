net/mlx4_core: Fix wrong calculation of free counters

The field res_free indicates the total number of counters which are
available for allocation (reserved and unreserved). Fixed a bug where
the reserved counters were subtracted from res_free before any
allocation was performed.

Before this fix, free counters which were not reserved could not be
allocated.
