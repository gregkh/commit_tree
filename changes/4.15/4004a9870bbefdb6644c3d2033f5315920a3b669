staging: rtl8188eu: Revert part of "staging: rtl8188eu: fix comments with lines over 80 characters"

Commit 74e1e498e84e ("staging: rtl8188eu: fix comments with lines over 80
characters") not only changed comments but also changed an if check:

-if (pmlmepriv->cur_network.join_res != true) {
+if (!(pmlmepriv->cur_network.join_res)) {

This is not equivalent as join_res is an int and can have values such
as -2 and -3.

Note for the next time, please only make one type of changes in a single
clean-up commit.
