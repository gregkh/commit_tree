x86/PCI: Move and shrink AMD 64-bit window to avoid conflict

Avoid problems with BIOS implementations which don't report all used
resources to the OS by only allocating a 256GB window directly below the
hardware limit (from the BKDG, sec 2.4.6).

Fixes a silent reboot loop reported by Aaro Koskinen <aaro.koskinen@iki.fi>
on an AMD-based MSI MS-7699/760GA-P43(FX) system.  This was apparently
caused by RAM or other unreported hardware that conflicted with the new
window.
