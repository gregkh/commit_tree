MAINTAINERS: xen, kvm: track pvclock-abi.h changes

This file defines an ABI shared between guest and hypervisor(s)
(KVM, Xen) and as such there should be an correspondent entry in
MAINTAINERS file. Notice that there's already a text notice at the
top of the header file, hence this commit simply enforces it more
explicitly and have both peers noticed when such changes happen.
