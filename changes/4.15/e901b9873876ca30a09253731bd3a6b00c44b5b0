usb: core: Add a helper function to check the validity of EP type in URB

This patch adds a new helper function to perform a sanity check of the
given URB to see whether it contains a valid endpoint.  It's a light-
weight version of what usb_submit_urb() does, but without the kernel
warning followed by the stack trace, just returns an error code.

Especially for a driver that doesn't parse the descriptor but fills
the URB with the fixed endpoint (e.g. some quirks for non-compliant
devices), this kind of check is preferable at the probe phase before
actually submitting the urb.
