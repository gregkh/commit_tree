powerpc/powernv/npu: Use flush_all_mm() instead of flush_tlb_mm()

With the optimisations introduced by commit a46cc7a908 ("powerpc/mm/radix:
Improve TLB/PWC flushes"), flush_tlb_mm() no longer flushes the page walk
cache with radix. Switch to using flush_all_mm() to ensure the pwc and tlb
are properly flushed on the nmmu.
