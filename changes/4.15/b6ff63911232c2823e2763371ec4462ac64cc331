bpf: fix and add test cases for ARG_CONST_SIZE_OR_ZERO semantics change

Fix a few test cases to allow non-NULL map/packet/stack pointer
with size = 0. Change a few tests using bpf_probe_read to use
bpf_probe_write_user so ARG_CONST_SIZE arg can still be properly
tested. One existing test case already covers size = 0 with non-NULL
packet pointer, so add additional tests so all cases of
size = 0 and 0 <= size <= legal_upper_bound with non-NULL
map/packet/stack pointer are covered.
