xfs: introduce the xfs_iext_cursor abstraction

Add a new xfs_iext_cursor structure to hide the direct extent map
index manipulations. In addition to the existing lookup/get/insert/
remove and update routines new primitives to get the first and last
extent cursor, as well as moving up and down by one extent are
provided.  Also new are convenience to increment/decrement the
cursor and retreive the new extent, as well as to peek into the
previous/next extent without updating the cursor and last but not
least a macro to iterate over all extents in a fork.
