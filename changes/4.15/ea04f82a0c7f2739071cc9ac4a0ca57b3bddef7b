tty/serial: atmel: Prevent a warning on suspend

The atmel serial port driver reported the following warning on suspend:
atmel_usart f8020000.serial: ttyS1: Unable to drain transmitter

As the ATMEL_US_TXEMPTY status bit in ATMEL_US_CSR is always cleared
when the transmitter is disabled, we need to know the transmitter's
state to return the real fifo state. And as ATMEL_US_CR is write-only,
it is necessary to save the state of the transmitter in a local
variable, and update the variable when TXEN and TXDIS is written in
ATMEL_US_CR.

After those changes, atmel_tx_empty can return "empty" on suspend, the
warning in uart_suspend_port disappears, and suspending is 20ms shorter
for each enabled Atmel serial port.
