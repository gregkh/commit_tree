ipv6: don't release rt->rt6i_pcpu memory during rt6_release()

After rwlock is replaced with rcu and spinlock, route lookup can happen
simultanously with route deletion.
This patch removes the call to free_percpu(rt->rt6i_pcpu) from
rt6_release() to avoid the race condition between rt6_release() and
rt6_get_pcpu_route(). And as free_percpu(rt->rt6i_pcpu) is already
called in ip6_dst_destroy() after the rcu grace period, it is safe to do
this change.
