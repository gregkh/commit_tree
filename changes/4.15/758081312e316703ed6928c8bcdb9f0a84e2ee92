ACPI/IORT: Remove leftover ACPI_IORT_SMMU_V3_PXM_VALID guard

The conditional ACPI_IORT_SMMU_V3_PXM_VALID guard around
arm_smmu_v3_set_proximity() was added to manage a cross tree
ACPICA merge dependency; with ACPICA changes merged in:

commit c944230064eb ("ACPICA: iasl: Update to IORT SMMUv3
disassembling")

the guard has become useless. Remove it.
