powerpc/powernv: Fix kexec crashes caused by tlbie tracing

Rebooting into a new kernel with kexec fails in trace_tlbie() which is
called from native_hpte_clear(). This happens if the running kernel
has CONFIG_LOCKDEP enabled. With lockdep enabled, the tracepoints
always execute few RCU checks regardless of whether tracing is on or
off. We are already in the last phase of kexec sequence in real mode
with HILE_BE set. At this point the RCU check ends up in
RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN and causes kexec to fail.

Fix this by not calling trace_tlbie() from native_hpte_clear().

mpe: It's not safe to call trace points at this point in the kexec
path, even if we could avoid the RCU checks/warnings. The only
solution is to not call them.
