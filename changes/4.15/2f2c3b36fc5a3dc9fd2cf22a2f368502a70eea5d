drm/amd/display: fix memory leaks on error exit return

Currently in the case where some of the allocations fail for dce110_tgv,
dce110_xfmv, dce110_miv or dce110_oppv then the exit return path ends
up leaking allocated objects. Fix this by kfree'ing them before returning.
Also re-work the comparison of the null pointers to use the !ptr idiom.
