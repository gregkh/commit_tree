dm cache: submit writethrough writes in parallel to origin and cache

Discontinue issuing writethrough write IO in series to the origin and
then cache.

Use bio_clone_fast() to create a new origin clone bio that will be
mapped to the origin device and then bio_chain() it to the bio that gets
remapped to the cache device.  The origin clone bio does _not_ have a
copy of the per_bio_data -- as such check_if_tick_bio_needed() will not
be called.

The cache bio (parent bio) will not complete until the origin bio has
completed -- this fulfills bio_clone_fast()'s requirements as well as
the requirement to not complete the original IO until the write IO has
completed to both the origin and cache device.
