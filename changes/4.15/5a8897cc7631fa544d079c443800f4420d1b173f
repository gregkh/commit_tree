locking/atomics/alpha: Add smp_read_barrier_depends() to _release()/_relaxed() atomics

As part of the fight against smp_read_barrier_depends(), we require
dependency ordering to be preserved when a dependency is headed by a load
performed using an atomic operation.

This patch adds smp_read_barrier_depends() to the _release() and _relaxed()
atomics on alpha, which otherwise lack anything to enforce dependency
ordering.
