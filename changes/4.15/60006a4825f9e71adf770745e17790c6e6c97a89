ipv6: prepare fib6_remove_prefsrc() for exception table

After we move cached dst entries into the exception table under its
parent route, current fib6_remove_prefsrc() no longer can access them.
This commit makes fib6_remove_prefsrc() also go through all routes
in the exception table to remove the pref src.
This is a preparation patch in order to move all cached dst into the
exception table.
