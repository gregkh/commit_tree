fs, nilfs: convert nilfs_root.count from atomic_t to refcount_t

atomic_t variables are currently used to implement reference counters
with the following properties:

 - counter is initialized to 1 using atomic_set()
 - a resource is freed upon counter reaching zero
 - once counter reaches zero, its further
   increments aren't allowed
 - counter schema uses basic atomic operations
   (set, inc, inc_not_zero, dec_and_test, etc.)

Such atomic variables should be converted to a newly provided refcount_t
type and API that prevents accidental counter overflows and underflows.
This is important since overflows and underflows can lead to
use-after-free situation and be exploitable.

The variable nilfs_root.count is used as pure reference counter.
Convert it to refcount_t and fix up the operations.
