rsi: sdio: Add WOWLAN support for S4 hibernate state

We are disabling of interrupts from firmware in freeze handler.
Also setting power management capability KEEP_MMC_POWER to make
device wakeup for WoWLAN trigger.
At restore, we observed a device reset on some platforms. Hence
reloading of firmware and device initialization is performed.
