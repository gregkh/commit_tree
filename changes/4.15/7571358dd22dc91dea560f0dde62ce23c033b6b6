media: dt: bindings: media: Document data lane numbering without lane reordering

Most devices do not support lane reordering and in many cases the
documentation of the data-lanes property is incomplete for such devices.
Document that in case the lane reordering isn't supported, monotonically
incremented values from 0 or 1 shall be used.
