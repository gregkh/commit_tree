ARM: OMAP2+: Fix SRAM virt to phys translation for save_secure_ram_context

With the CMA changes from Joonsoo Kim <iamjoonsoo.kim@lge.com>, it
was noticed that n900 stopped booting. After investigating it turned
out that n900 save_secure_ram_context does some whacky virtual to
physical address translation for the SRAM data address.

As we now only have minimal parts of omap3 idle code copied to SRAM,
running save_secure_ram_context() in SRAM is not needed. It only gets
called on PM init. And it seems there's no need to ever call this from
SRAM idle code.

So let's just keep save_secure_ram_context() in DDR, and pass it the
physical address of the parameters. We can do everything else in
omap-secure.c like we already do for other secure code.

And since we don't have any documentation, I still have no clue what
the values for 0, 1 and 1 for the parameters might be. If somebody has
figured it out, please do send a patch to add some comments.
