usbip: fix stub_rx: harden CMD_SUBMIT path to handle malicious input

Harden CMD_SUBMIT path to handle malicious input that could trigger
large memory allocations. Add checks to validate transfer_buffer_length
and number_of_packets to protect against bad input requesting for
unbounded memory allocations. Validate early in get_pipe() and return
failure.
