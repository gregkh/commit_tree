usbnet: fix alignment for frames with no ethernet header

The qmi_wwan minidriver support a 'raw-ip' mode where frames are
received without any ethernet header. This causes alignment issues
because the skbs allocated by usbnet are "IP aligned".

Fix by allowing minidrivers to disable the additional alignment
offset. This is implemented using a per-device flag, since the same
minidriver also supports 'ethernet' mode.
