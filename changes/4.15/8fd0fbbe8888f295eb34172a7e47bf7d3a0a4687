  75e8387685f6 ("perf/ftrace: Fix double traces of perf on ftrace:function")

The reason I instantly stumbled on that patch is that it only addresses the
ftrace situation and doesn't mention the other _5_ places that use this
interface. It doesn't explain why those don't have the problem and if not, why
their solution doesn't work for ftrace.

It doesn't, but this is just putting more duct tape on.
