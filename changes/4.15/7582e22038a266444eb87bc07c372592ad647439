arm64/sve: Backend logic for setting the vector length

This patch implements the core logic for changing a task's vector
length on request from userspace.  This will be used by the ptrace
and prctl frontends that are implemented in later patches.

The SVE architecture permits, but does not require, implementations
to support vector lengths that are not a power of two.  To handle
this, logic is added to check a requested vector length against a
possibly sparse bitmap of available vector lengths at runtime, so
that the best supported value can be chosen.
