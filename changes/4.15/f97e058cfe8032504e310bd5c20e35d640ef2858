platform/x86: wmi: Don't allow drivers to get each other's GUIDs

The only driver using this was dell-wmi, and it really was a hack.
The driver was getting a data attribute from another driver and this
type of action should not be encouraged.

Rather drivers that need to interact with one another should pass
data back and forth via exported functions.
