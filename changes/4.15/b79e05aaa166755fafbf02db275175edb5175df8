ovl: no direct iteration for dir with origin xattr

If a non-merge dir in an overlay mount has an overlay.origin xattr, it
means it was once an upper merge dir, which may contain whiteouts and
then the lower dir was removed under it.

Do not iterate real dir directly in this case to avoid exposing whiteouts.

[SzM] Set OVL_WHITEOUT for all merge directories as well.

[amir] A directory that was just copied up does not have the OVL_WHITEOUTS
flag. We need to set it to fix merge dir iteration.
