IB/uverbs: Fix command checking as part of ib_uverbs_ex_modify_qp()

If the input command length is larger than the kernel supports an error should
be returned in case the unsupported bytes are not cleared, instead of the
other way aroudn. This matches what all other callers of ib_is_udata_cleared
do and will avoid user ABI problems in the future.
