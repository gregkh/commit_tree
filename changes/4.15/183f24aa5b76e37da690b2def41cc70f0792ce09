mm/memory.c: mark wp_huge_pmd() inline to prevent build failure

With gcc 4.1.2:

    mm/memory.o: In function `wp_huge_pmd':
    memory.c:(.text+0x9b4): undefined reference to `do_huge_pmd_wp_page'

Interestingly, wp_huge_pmd() is emitted in the assembler output, but
never called.

Apparently replacing the call to pmd_write() in __handle_mm_fault() by a
call to the more complex pmd_access_permitted() reduced the ability of
the compiler to remove unused code.

Fix this by marking wp_huge_pmd() inline, like was done in commit
91a90140f998 ("mm/memory.c: mark create_huge_pmd() inline to prevent
build failure") for a similar problem.
