scsi: aacraid: use timespec64 instead of timeval

aacraid passes the current time to the firmware in one of two ways,
either as year/month/day/... or as 32-bit unsigned seconds.

The first one is broken on 32-bit architectures as it cannot go past
year 2038. Using timespec64 here makes it behave properly on both 32-bit
and 64-bit architectures, and avoids relying on signed integer overflow
to pass times into the second interface.

The interface used in aac_send_hosttime() however is still problematic
in year 2106 when 32-bit seconds overflow. Hopefully we don't have to
worry about aacraid by that time.
