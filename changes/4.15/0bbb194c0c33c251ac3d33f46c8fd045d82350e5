coresight: Extend the PIDR mask to cover relevant bits in PIDR2

As per coresight standards, PIDR2 register has the following format :

 [2-0]	- JEP106_bits6to4
 [3]	- JEDEC, designer ID is specified by JEDEC.

However some of the drivers only use mask of 0x3 for the PIDR2 leaving
bits [3-2] unchecked, which could potentially match the component for
a different device altogether. This patch fixes the mask and the
corresponding id bits for the existing devices.
