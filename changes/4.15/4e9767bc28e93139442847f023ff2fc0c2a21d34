Cannonlake Slice and Subslice information has changed.

    - Fix on Total slices count by avoiding [1][2] and [2][2].
    - Inclusion of EU Per Subslice.
    - Commit message.
v3: This v3 done by Rodrigo includes:
    - Handle all possible bits and extra fuse register.
    - Use INTEL_GEN macro.
    - Fully assume uniform distribution so remove union
      with eu_per_subslice and add proper the comment.
v4: This v4 done by Rodrigo includes:
    - Consider all bits available: 6 bits for slices [27:22]
      and 4 for subslices [21:18].
