rtnetlink: bring NETDEV_CHANGELOWERSTATE event process back to rtnetlink_event

This patch is to bring NETDEV_CHANGELOWERSTATE event process back
to rtnetlink_event so that bonding could use it instead of calling
rtmsg_ifinfo to send a notification to userspace after netdev lower
state is changed in the later patch.
