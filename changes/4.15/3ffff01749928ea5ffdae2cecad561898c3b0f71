drm/i915: Ignore duplicate VMA stored within the per-object handle LUT

By using drm_gem_flink/drm_gem_open on an object using the same fd, it
is possible for a client to create multiple handles pointing to the same
object (tied to the same contexts and VMA), as exemplified by
igt::gem_handle_to_libdrm_bo(). Since this duplication has been possible
since forever, we cannot assume that the handle:(fpriv, object) is
unique and so must handle the multiple users of a single VMA.

v2: Added commentary noise.

Testcase: igt/gem_close
