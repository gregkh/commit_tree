cpufreq: stats: Handle the case when trans_table goes beyond PAGE_SIZE

On platforms with large number of Pstates, the transition table, which
is a NxN matrix, can overflow beyond the PAGE_SIZE boundary.

This can be seen on POWER9 which has 100+ Pstates.

As a result, each time the trans_table is read for any of the CPUs, we
will get the following error.

---------------------------------------------------
fill_read_buffer: show+0x0/0xa0 returned bad count
---------------------------------------------------

This patch ensures that in case of an overflow, we print a warning
once in the dmesg and return FILE TOO LARGE error for this and all
subsequent accesses of trans_table.
