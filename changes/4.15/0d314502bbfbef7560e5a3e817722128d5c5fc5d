net: bcmgenet: correct bad merge

As noted in the net-next submission for GENETv5 support [1], there
were merge conflicts with an earlier net submission [2] that had not
yet found its way to the net-next repository.

Unfortunately, when the branches were merged the conflicts were not
correctly resolved.  This commit attempts to correct that.
