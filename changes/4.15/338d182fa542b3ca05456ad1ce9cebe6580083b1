ipv6: try not to take rtnl_lock in ip6mr_sk_done

Avoid traversing the list of mr6_tables (which requires the
rtnl_lock) in ip6mr_sk_done(), when we know in advance that
a match will not be found.
This can happen when rawv6_close()/ip6mr_sk_done() is invoked
on non-mroute6 sockets.
This patch helps reduce rtnl_lock contention when destroying
a large number of net namespaces, each having a non-mroute6
raw socket.

v2: same patch, only fixed subject line and expanded comment.
