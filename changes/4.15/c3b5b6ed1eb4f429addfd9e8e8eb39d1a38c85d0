tracing: mark trace_test_buffer as __maybe_unused

After trace_selftest_startup_sched_switch is removed, trace_test_buffer()
is only used sometimes, leading to this warning:

kernel/trace/trace_selftest.c:62:12: error: 'trace_test_buffer' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

There is no simple #ifdef condition that captures well whether the
function is in fact used or not, so marking it as __maybe_unused is
probably the best way to shut up the warning. The function will then
be silently dropped when there is no user.
