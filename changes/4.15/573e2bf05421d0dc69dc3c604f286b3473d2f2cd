rtc: xgene: mark PM functions as __maybe_unused

The new xgene_rtc_alarm_irq_enabled() function is only accessed
from PM code, which is inside of an #ifdef; this causes a harmless
build warning when CONFIG_PM is disabled:

drivers/rtc/rtc-xgene.c:108:12: error: 'xgene_rtc_alarm_irq_enabled' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Just remove the #ifdef and use __maybe_unused annotations instead,
to make the code more robust here.
