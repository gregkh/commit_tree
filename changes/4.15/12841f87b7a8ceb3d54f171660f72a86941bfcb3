cxl: Check if vphb exists before iterating over AFU devices

During an eeh a kernel-oops is reported if no vPHB is allocated to the
AFU. This happens as during AFU init, an error in creation of vPHB is
a non-fatal error. Hence afu->phb should always be checked for NULL
before iterating over it for the virtual AFU pci devices.

This patch fixes the kenel-oops by adding a NULL pointer check for
afu->phb before it is dereferenced.
