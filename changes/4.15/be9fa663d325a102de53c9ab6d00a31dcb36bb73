scripts/decodecode: fix decoding for AArch64 (arm64) instructions

There are a couple of problems with the decodecode script and arm64:

1. AArch64 objdump refuses to disassemble .4byte directives as instructions,
   insisting that they are data values and displaying them as:

	a94153f3	.word	0xa94153f3		<-- trapping instruction

   This is resolved by using the .inst directive instead.

2. Disassembly of branch instructions attempts to provide the target as
   an offset from a symbol, e.g.:

   0:	34000082	cbz	w2, 10 <.text+0x10>

  however this falls foul of the grep -v, which matches lines containing
  ".text" and ends up removing all branch instructions from the dump.

This patch resolves both issues by using the .inst directive for 4-byte
quantities on arm64 and stripping the resulting binaries (as is done on
arm already) to remove the mapping symbols.
