iommu/iova: Make dma_32bit_pfn implicit

Now that the cached node optimisation can apply to all allocations, the
couple of users which were playing tricks with dma_32bit_pfn in order to
benefit from it can stop doing so. Conversely, there is also no need for
all the other users to explicitly calculate a 'real' 32-bit PFN, when
init_iova_domain() can happily do that itself from the page granularity.
