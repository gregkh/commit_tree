mm: simplify nodemask printing

alloc_warn() and dump_header() have to explicitly handle NULL nodemask
which forces both paths to use pr_cont.  We can do better.  printk
already handles NULL pointers properly so all we need is to teach
nodemask_pr_args to handle NULL nodemask carefully.  This allows
simplification of both alloc_warn() and dump_header() and gets rid of
pr_cont altogether.

This patch has been motivated by patch from Joe Perches
