KVM: x86: ioapic: Remove redundant check for Remote IRR in ioapic_set_irq

Remote IRR for level-triggered interrupts was previously checked in
ioapic_set_irq, but since we now have a check in ioapic_service we
can remove the redundant check from ioapic_set_irq.

This commit doesn't change semantics.
