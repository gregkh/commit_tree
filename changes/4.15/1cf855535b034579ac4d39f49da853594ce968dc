power: supply: sbs-battery: move gpio present detect to sbs_get_property

Currently when a gpio is defined for battery presence it is only used in
the sbs_get_battery_presence_and_health function for 2 properties.
All other properties currently try to read data form the battery before
returning an error if not present. We should know in advance that no
data is going to returned.

As the driver tries multiple times to access a property, this prevents
a lot of smbus accesses, which had a significant effect on device boot-up.
As when the device is registered lots of property accesses are attempted
during boot.

If no gpio is used for presence detection no change in behaviour should
occur.
