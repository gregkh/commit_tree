Btrfs: remove nr_async_bios

This was intended to congest higher layers to not send bios, but as

1) the congested bit has been taken by writeback

Async bios come from buffered writes and DIO writes.

For DIO writes, we want to submit them ASAP, while for buffered writes,
writeback uses balance_dirty_pages() to throttle how much dirty pages we
can have.

2) and no one is waiting for %nr_async_bios down to zero,

Historically, it was introduced along with changes which let
checksumming workload spread accross different cpus.  And at that time,
pdflush was used instead of per-bdi flushing, perhaps pdflush did not
have the necessary information for writeback to do throttling.

We can safely remove them now.
