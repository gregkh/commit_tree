x86/cpu/AMD: Make LFENCE a serializing instruction

To aid in speculation control, make LFENCE a serializing instruction
since it has less overhead than MFENCE.  This is done by setting bit 1
of MSR 0xc0011029 (DE_CFG).  Some families that support LFENCE do not
have this MSR.  For these families, the LFENCE instruction is already
serializing.
