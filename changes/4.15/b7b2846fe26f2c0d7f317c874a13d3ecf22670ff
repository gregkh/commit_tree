xfs: add the ability to join a held buffer to a defer_ops

In certain cases, defer_ops callers will lock a buffer and want to hold
the lock across transaction rolls.  Similar to ijoined inodes, we want
to dirty & join the buffer with each transaction roll in defer_finish so
that afterwards the caller still owns the buffer lock and we haven't
inadvertently pinned the log.
