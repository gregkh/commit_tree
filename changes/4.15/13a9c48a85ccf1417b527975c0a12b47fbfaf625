bpf: offload: add comment warning developers about double destroy

Offload state may get destroyed either because the device for which
it was constructed is going away, or because the refcount of bpf
program itself has reached 0.  In both of those cases we will call
__bpf_prog_offload_destroy() to unlink the offload from the device.
We may in fact call it twice, which works just fine, but we should
make clear this is intended and caution others trying to extend the
function.
