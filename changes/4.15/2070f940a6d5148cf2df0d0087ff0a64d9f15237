iommu/iova: Optimise rbtree searching

Checking the IOVA bounds separately before deciding which direction to
continue the search (if necessary) results in redundantly comparing both
pfns twice each. GCC can already determine that the final comparison op
is redundant and optimise it down to 3 in total, but we can go one
further with a little tweak of the ordering (which makes the intent of
the code that much cleaner as a bonus).
