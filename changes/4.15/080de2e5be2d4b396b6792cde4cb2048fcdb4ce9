drm/atomic: Check for busy planes/connectors before setting the commit

We still want to fail with -EBUSY if a plane or connector is part of
a commit, even if it will be assigned to a new commit.

This closes a small hole left open where we should return -EBUSY.
It's not severe, because wait_for_dependencies and swap_state helpers
still block. But it should return -EBUSY and not stall.
