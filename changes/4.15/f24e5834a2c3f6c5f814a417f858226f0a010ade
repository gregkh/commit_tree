arm64: Initialise high_memory global variable earlier

The high_memory global variable is used by
cma_declare_contiguous(.) before it is defined.

We don't notice this as we compute __pa(high_memory - 1), and it looks
like we're processing a VA from the direct linear map.

This problem becomes apparent when we flip the kernel virtual address
space and the linear map is moved to the bottom of the kernel VA space.

This patch moves the initialisation of high_memory before it used.
