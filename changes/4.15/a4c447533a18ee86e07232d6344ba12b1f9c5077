intel_idle: Graceful probe failure when MWAIT is disabled

When MWAIT is disabled, intel_idle refuses to probe.
But it may mis-lead the user by blaming this on the model number:

intel_idle: does not run on family 6 modesl 79

So defer the check for MWAIT until after the model# white-list check succeeds,
and if the MWAIT check fails, tell the user how to fix it:

intel_idle: Please enable MWAIT in BIOS SETUP
