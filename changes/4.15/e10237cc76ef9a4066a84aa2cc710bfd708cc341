kthread: zero the kthread data structure

kthread() could bail out early before we initialize blkcg_css (if the
kthread is killed very early. Please see xchg() statement in kthread()),
which confuses free_kthread_struct. Instead of moving the blkcg_css
initialization early, we simply zero the whole 'self' data structure,
which doesn't sound much overhead.
