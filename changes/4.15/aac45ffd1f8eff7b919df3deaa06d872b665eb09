arm64/sve: KVM: Treat guest SVE use as undefined instruction execution

When trapping forbidden attempts by a guest to use SVE, we want the
guest to see a trap consistent with SVE not being implemented.

This patch injects an undefined instruction exception into the
guest in response to such an exception.
