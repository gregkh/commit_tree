afs: Rename struct afs_call server member to cm_server

Rename the server member of struct afs_call to cm_server as we're only
going to be using it for incoming calls for the Cache Manager service.
This makes it easier to differentiate from the pointer to the target server
for the client, which will point to a different structure to allow for
callback handling.
