perf stat: Support JSON metrics in perf stat

Add generic support for standalone metrics specified in JSON files to
perf stat. A metric is a formula that uses multiple events to compute a
higher level result (e.g. IPC).

Previously metrics were always tied to an event and automatically
enabled with that event. But now change it that we can have standalone
metrics. They are in the same JSON data structure as events, but don't
have an event name.

We also allow to organize the metrics in metric groups, which allows a
short cut to select several related metrics at once.

Add a new -M / --metrics option to perf stat that adds the metrics or
metric groups specified.

Add the core code to manage and parse the metric groups. They are
collected from the JSON data structures into a separate rblist.  When
computing shadow values look for metrics in that list.  Then they are
computed using the existing saved values infrastructure in stat-shadow.c

The actual JSON metrics are in a separate pull request.
