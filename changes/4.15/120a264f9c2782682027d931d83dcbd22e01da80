drm/exynos: gem: Drop NONCONTIG flag for buffers allocated without IOMMU

When no IOMMU is available, all GEM buffers allocated by Exynos DRM driver
are contiguous, because of the underlying dma_alloc_attrs() function
provides only such buffers. In such case it makes no sense to keep
BO_NONCONTIG flag for the allocated GEM buffers. This allows to avoid
failures for buffer contiguity checks in the subsequent operations on GEM
objects.
