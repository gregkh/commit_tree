stop using '%pK' for /proc/kallsyms pointer values

Not only is it annoying to have one single flag for all pointers, as if
that was a global choice and all kernel pointers are the same, but %pK
can't get the 'access' vs 'open' time check right anyway.

So make the /proc/kallsyms pointer value code use logic specific to that
particular file.  We do continue to honor kptr_restrict, but the default
(which is unrestricted) is changed to instead take expected users into
account, and restrict access by default.

Right now the only actual expected user is kernel profiling, which has a
separate sysctl flag for kernel profile access.  There may be others.
