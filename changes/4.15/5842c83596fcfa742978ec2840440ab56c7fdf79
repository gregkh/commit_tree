xen/pvcalls: implement poll command

For active sockets, check the indexes and use the inflight_conn_req
waitqueue to wait.

For passive sockets if an accept is outstanding
(PVCALLS_FLAG_ACCEPT_INFLIGHT), check if it has been answered by looking
at bedata->rsp[req_id]. If so, return POLLIN.  Otherwise use the
inflight_accept_req waitqueue.

If no accepts are inflight, send PVCALLS_POLL to the backend. If we have
outstanding POLL requests awaiting for a response use the inflight_req
waitqueue: inflight_req is awaken when a new response is received; on
wakeup we check whether the POLL response is arrived by looking at the
PVCALLS_FLAG_POLL_RET flag. We set the flag from
pvcalls_front_event_handler, if the response was for a POLL command.

In pvcalls_front_event_handler, get the struct sock_mapping from the
poll id (we previously converted struct sock_mapping* to uintptr_t and
used it as id).
