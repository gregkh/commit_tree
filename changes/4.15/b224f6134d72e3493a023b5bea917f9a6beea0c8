nvme: set discard_alignment to zero

Similar to 7c084289795b ("rbd: set discard_alignment to zero"), NVMe
devices are currently incorrectly initialised with the block queue
discard_alignment set to the NVMe stream alignment.

As per Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-block:
  The discard_alignment parameter indicates how many bytes the beginning
  of the device is offset from the internal allocation unit's natural
  alignment.

Correcting the discard_alignment parameter to zero has no effect on how
discard requests are propagated through the block layer - @alignment in
__blkdev_issue_discard() remains zero. However, it does fix other
consumers, such as LIO's Block Limits VPD response.
