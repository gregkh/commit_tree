Btrfs: add a extent ref verify tool

We were having corruption issues that were tied back to problems with
the extent tree.  In order to track them down I built this tool to try
and find the culprit, which was pretty successful.  If you compile with
this tool on it will live verify every ref update that the fs makes and
make sure it is consistent and valid.  I've run this through with
xfstests and haven't gotten any false positives.  Thanks,
