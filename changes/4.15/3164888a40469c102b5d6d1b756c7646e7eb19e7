drm/i915: Increase poll time for BDW FCLK_DONE

During IGT testing it has been shown that the specification
defined polling time of 1 us for FCLK_DONE, is sometimes not
enough. The issue is still reproducible while disabling
C-states through the PM QoS framework and also while disabling
preemtion. From this the most plausible explanation is that the
issue is due to a firmware flaw.
As a workaround, it is better to wait a little bit longer for
the FCLK_DONE to come around, than to leave with an DRM_ERROR
and having FCLK_DONE at a randome time after.
While spinning a list of igt tests prone to reproduce the issue
the FCLK_DONE poll failed at approximately 2% of the invocations
of the bdw_set_cdclk function. The longest poll time during this
testing was measured to ~7us. So, the suggested new poll time of
100us is on the safe side.

v2: Added more documentation about investigations done.
