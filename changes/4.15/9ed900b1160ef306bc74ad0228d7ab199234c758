afs: Push the net ns pointer to more places

Push the network namespace pointer to more places in AFS, including the
afs_server structure (which doesn't hold a ref on the netns).

In particular, afs_put_cell() now takes requires a net ns parameter so that
it can safely alter the netns after decrementing the cell usage count - the
cell will be deallocated by a background thread after being cached for a
period, which means that it's not safe to access it after reducing its
usage count.
