ARM: net: bpf: avoid 'bx' instruction on non-Thumb capable CPUs

Avoid the 'bx' instruction on CPUs that have no support for Thumb and
thus do not implement this instruction by moving the generation of this
opcode to a separate function that selects between:

	bx	reg

and

	mov	pc, reg

according to the capabilities of the CPU.
