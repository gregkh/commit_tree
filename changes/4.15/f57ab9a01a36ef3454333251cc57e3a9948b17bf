drivers: base: cacheinfo: fix cache type for non-architected system cache

Commit dfea747d2aba ("drivers: base: cacheinfo: support DT overrides for
cache properties") doesn't initialise the cache type if it's present
only in DT and the architecture is not aware of it. They are unified
system level cache which are generally transparent.

This patch check if the cache type is set to NOCACHE but the DT node
indicates that it's unified cache and sets the cache type accordingly.
