kvm: arm64: handle single-stepping trapped instructions

If we are using guest debug to single-step the guest, we need to ensure
that we exit after emulating the instruction. This only affects
instructions completely emulated by the kernel. For instructions
emulated in userspace, we need to exit and return to complete the
emulation.

The kvm_arm_handle_step_debug() helper sets up the necessary exit
state if needed.
