usbip: fix stub_send_ret_submit() vulnerability to null transfer_buffer

stub_send_ret_submit() handles urb with a potential null transfer_buffer,
when it replays a packet with potential malicious data that could contain
a null buffer. Add a check for the condition when actual_length > 0 and
transfer_buffer is null.
