s390: use generic rwsem implementation

We never optimized our rwsem inline assemblies to make use of the new
atomic instructions. The generic rwsem implementation implicitly makes
use of the new instructions, since it implements the required rwsem
primitives with atomic operations, which we did optimize.

However even when compiling for old architectures the generic variant
still generates better code. So it's time to simply remove our old
code and switch to the generic implementation.
