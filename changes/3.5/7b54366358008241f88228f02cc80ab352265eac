PCI: add generic device into pci_host_bridge struct

Use that device for pci_root_bus bridge pointer.

Use pci_release_bus_bridge_dev() to release allocated pci_host_bridge in
remove path.

Use root bus bridge pointer to get host bridge pointer instead of searching
host bridge list.  That leaves the host bridge list unused, so remove it.
