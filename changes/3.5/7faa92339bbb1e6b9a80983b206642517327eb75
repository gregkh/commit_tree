OMAPDSS: DISPC: Handle synclost errors in OMAP3

In OMAP3 DISPC video overlays suffer from some undocumented horizontal position
and timing related limitations leading to SYNCLOST errors. Whenever the image
window is moved towards the right of the screen SYNCLOST errors become
frequent. Checks have been implemented to see that DISPC driver rejects
configuration exceeding above limitations.

This code was successfully tested on OMAP3. This code is written based on code
written by Ville Syrj채l채 <ville.syrjala@nokia.com> in Linux OMAP kernel. Ville
Syrj채l채 <ville.syrjala@nokia.com> had added checks for video overlay horizontal
timing and DISPC horizontal blanking length limitations.
