drm via: initialize object_idr

The field obejct_idr of struct drm_via_private was introduced with the
commit http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commitdiff;h=77ee8f3825054f23b17e9c8f728f061defd86cdc .
In that patch idr_init(&dev->object_name_idr) was called instead of
idr_init(&dev_priv->object_idr) by mistake, leaving the dev_priv->object_idr
uninitialized. To be more exact, the object_idr buffer is filled with zeros
because of kzalloc(), but the dev_priv->object_idr.lock spinlock can cause
system freeze at lib/idr.c:move_to_free_list() when spin_lock_irqsave()
is called on this spinlock.

The patch was tested on Clevo D4J, model D410J laptop, on the following
hardware, without AGP kernel module loaded:

  # lspci -s 01:00.0 -n
  01:00.0 0300: 1106:3108 (rev 01)
