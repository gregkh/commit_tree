regmap: add MMIO bus support

This is a basic memory-mapped-IO bus for regmap. It has the following
features and limitations:

* Registers themselves may be 8, 16, 32, or 64-bit. 64-bit is only
  supported on 64-bit platforms.
* Register offsets are limited to precisely 32-bit.
* IO is performed using readl/writel, with no provision for using the
  __raw_readl or readl_relaxed variants.
