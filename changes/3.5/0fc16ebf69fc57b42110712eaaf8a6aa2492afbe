be2net: Fix VLAN/multicast packet reception

VLAN and multicast hardware filters are limited and can get
exhausted in adapters with many PCI functions. If setting
a VLAN or multicast filter fails due to lack of sufficient
hardware resources, these packets get dropped. Fix this by
switching to VLAN or multicast promiscous mode so that these
packets are not dropped.
