IPoIB: fix skb truesize underestimatiom

Or Gerlitz reported triggering of WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len); in
skb_try_coalesce()
This warning tracks drivers that incorrectly set skb->truesize

IPoIB indeed allocates a full page to store a fragment, but only
accounts in skb->truesize the used part of the page (frame length)

This patch fixes skb truesize underestimation, and
also fixes a performance issue, because RX skbs have not enough tailroom
to allow IP and TCP stacks to pull their header in skb linear part
without an expensive call to pskb_expand_head()
