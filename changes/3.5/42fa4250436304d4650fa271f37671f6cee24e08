x86: Conditionally update time when ack-ing pending irqs

On virtual environments, apic_read could take a long time. As a
result, under certain conditions the ack pending loop may exit
without any queued irqs left, but after more than one second. A
warning will be printed needlessly in this case.

If the loop is about to exit regardless of max_loops, don't
update it.
