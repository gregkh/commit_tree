blkcg: embed struct blkg_policy_data in policy specific data

Currently blkg_policy_data carries policy specific data as char flex
array instead of being embedded in policy specific data.  This was
forced by oddities around blkg allocation which are all gone now.

This patch makes blkg_policy_data embedded in policy specific data -
throtl_grp and cfq_group so that it's more conventional and consistent
with how io_cq is handled.

* blkcg_policy->pdata_size is renamed to ->pd_size.

* Functions which used to take void *pdata now takes struct
  blkg_policy_data *pd.

* blkg_to_pdata/pdata_to_blkg() updated to blkg_to_pd/pd_to_blkg().

* Dummy struct blkg_policy_data definition added.  Dummy
  pdata_to_blkg() definition was unused and inconsistent with the
  non-dummy version - correct dummy pd_to_blkg() added.

* throtl and cfq updated accordingly.

* As dummy blkg_to_pd/pd_to_blkg() are provided,
  blkg_to_cfqg/cfqg_to_blkg() don't need to be ifdef'd.  Moved outside
  ifdef block.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional change.
