blkcg: use @pol instead of @plid in update_root_blkg_pd() and blkcg_print_blkgs()

The two functions were taking "enum blkio_policy_id plid".  Make them
take "const struct blkio_policy_type *pol" instead.

This is to prepare for per-queue policy activation and doesn't cause
any functional difference.
