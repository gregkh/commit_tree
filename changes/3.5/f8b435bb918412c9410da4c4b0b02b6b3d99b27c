ARM: 7440/1: kprobes: only test 'sub pc, pc, #1b-2b+8-2' on ARMv6

'sub pc, pc, #1b-2b+8-2' results in address<1:0> == '10'.

sub pc, pc, #const (== ADR pc, #const) performs an interworking branch
(BXWritePC()) on ARMv7+ and a simple branch (BranchWritePC()) on earlier
versions.

In ARM state, BXWritePC() is UNPREDICTABLE when address<1:0> == '10'.

In ARM state on ARMv6+, BranchWritePC() ignores address<1:0>.  Before
ARMv6, BranchWritePC() is UNPREDICTABLE if address<1:0> != '00'

So the instruction is UNPREDICTABLE both before and after v6.
