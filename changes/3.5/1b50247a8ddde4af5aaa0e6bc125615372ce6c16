drm/i915: Remove the list of pinned inactive objects

Simplify object tracking by removing the inactive but pinned list. The
only place where this was used is for counting the available memory,
which is just as easy performed by checking all objects on the rare
occasions it is required (application startup). For ease of debugging,
we keep the reporting of pinned objects through the error-state and
debugfs.
