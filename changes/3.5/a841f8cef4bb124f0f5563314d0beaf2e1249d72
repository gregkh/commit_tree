sched: Fix the relax_domain_level boot parameter

It does not get processed because sched_domain_level_max is 0 at the
time that setup_relax_domain_level() is run.

Simply accept the value as it is, as we don't know the value of
sched_domain_level_max until sched domain construction is completed.

Fix sched_relax_domain_level in cpuset.  The build_sched_domain() routine calls
the set_domain_attribute() routine prior to setting the sd->level, however,
the set_domain_attribute() routine relies on the sd->level to decide whether
idle load balancing will be off/on.
