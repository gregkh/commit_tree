SELinux: allow default source/target selectors for user/role/range

When new objects are created we have great and flexible rules to
determine the type of the new object.  We aren't quite as flexible or
mature when it comes to determining the user, role, and range.  This
patch adds a new ability to specify the place a new objects user, role,
and range should come from.  For users and roles it can come from either
the source or the target of the operation.  aka for files the user can
either come from the source (the running process and todays default) or
it can come from the target (aka the parent directory of the new file)

examples always are done with
directory context: system_u:object_r:mnt_t:s0-s0:c0.c512
process context: unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
