Revert "sched, perf: Use a single callback into the scheduler"

This reverts commit cb04ff9ac424 ("sched, perf: Use a single
callback into the scheduler").

Before this change was introduced, the process switch worked
like this (wrt. to perf event schedule):

     schedule (prev, next)
       - schedule out all perf events for prev
       - switch to next
       - schedule in all perf events for current (next)

After the commit, the process switch looks like:

     schedule (prev, next)
       - schedule out all perf events for prev
       - schedule in all perf events for (next)
       - switch to next

The problem is, that after we schedule perf events in, the pmu
is enabled and we can receive events even before we make the
switch to next - so "current" still being prev process (event
SAMPLE data are filled based on the value of the "current"
process).

Thats exactly what we see for test__PERF_RECORD test. We receive
SAMPLES with PID of the process that our tracee is scheduled
from.

Discussed with Peter Zijlstra:
