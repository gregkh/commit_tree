IB/core: Fix mismatch between locked and pinned pages

Commit bc3e53f682d9 ("mm: distinguish between mlocked and pinned
pages") introduced a separate counter for pinned pages and used it in
the IB stack.  However, in ib_umem_get() the pinned counter is
incremented, but ib_umem_release() wrongly decrements the locked
counter.  Fix this.
