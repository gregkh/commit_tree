blkcg: make sure blkg_lookup() returns %NULL if @q is bypassing

Currently, blkg_lookup() doesn't check @q bypass state.  This patch
updates blk_queue_bypass_start() to do synchronize_rcu() before
returning and updates blkg_lookup() to check blk_queue_bypass() and
return %NULL if bypassing.  This ensures blkg_lookup() returns %NULL
if @q is bypassing.

This is to guarantee that nobody is accessing policy data while @q is
bypassing, which is necessary to allow replacing blkio_cgroup->pd[] in
place on policy [de]activation.

v2: Added more comments explaining bypass guarantees as suggested by
    Vivek.

v3: Added more comments explaining why there's no synchronize_rcu() in
    blk_cleanup_queue() as suggested by Vivek.
