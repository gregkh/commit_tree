ntp: Fix STA_INS/DEL clearing bug

In commit 6b43ae8a619d17c4935c3320d2ef9e92bdeed05d, I
introduced a bug that kept the STA_INS or STA_DEL bit
from being cleared from time_status via adjtimex()
without forcing STA_PLL first.

Usually once the STA_INS is set, it isn't cleared
until the leap second is applied, so its unlikely this
affected anyone. However during testing I noticed it
took some effort to cancel a leap second once STA_INS
was set.
