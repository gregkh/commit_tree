pipe: return -ENOIOCTLCMD instead of -EINVAL on unknown ioctl command

As described in commit 07d106d0a33d ("vfs: fix up ENOIOCTLCMD error
handling"), drivers should return -ENOIOCTLCMD if they receive an ioctl
command which they don't understand.  Doing so will result in -ENOTTY
being returned to userspace, which matches the behaviour of the compat
layer if it fails to translate an ioctl command.

This patch fixes the pipe ioctl to return -ENOIOCTLCMD instead of -EINVAL
when passed an unknown ioctl command.
