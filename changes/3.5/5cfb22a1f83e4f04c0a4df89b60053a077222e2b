md/raid5: prefer replacing failed devices over want-replacement devices.

If a RAID5 has both a failed device and a device marked as
'WantReplacement', then we should preferentially replace the failed
device.
However the current code replaces whichever is found first.
So split into 2 loops, check fail failed/missing first, and only check
for WantReplacement if nothing is failed or missing.
