ASoC: OMAP: HDMI: Expand capabilities of the HDMI DAI

According to the HDMI specification, a source is permitted to
transmit L-PCM audio in the following sample rates: 32kHz, 44.1kHz,
48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz or 192kHz.

It also supports up to 8 audio channels.

The sink may not necessarily support all these sample rates and
channels. However, as this CPU DAI describes the HDMI source, it
makes sense to include them. The limitation of capabilities as
supported by the sink should be done in the ASoC HDMI codec.
