ARM: OMAP2/3: hwmod data: update old names

Some of the 2xxx and 3xxx hwmod data files use the old naming style
for hwmods, ending in a "_hwmod".  These names are used by the OMAP
integration code to map hwmods to platform_devices, so they need to be
consistent, or the platform_devices won't be created.  Remove the
_hwmod suffix to conform with the rest of the OMAP SoC data.
