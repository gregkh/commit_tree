Bluetooth: Lock the L2CAP channel when sending

The ERTM and streaming mode transmit queue must only be accessed while
the L2CAP channel lock is held.  Locking the channel before calling
l2cap_chan_send ensures that multiple threads cannot simultaneously
manipulate the queue when sending and receiving concurrently.

L2CAP channel locking had previously moved to the l2cap_chan struct
instead of the associated socket, so some of the old socket locking
can also be removed in this patch.
