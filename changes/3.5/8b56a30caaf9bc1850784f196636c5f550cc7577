exofs:  Add SYSFS info for autologin/pNFS export

Introduce sysfs infrastructure for exofs cluster filesystem.

Each OSD target shows up as below in the sysfs hierarchy:
	/sys/fs/exofs/<osdname>_<partition_id>/devX

Where <osdname>_<partition_id> is the unique identification
of a Superblock.

Where devX: 0 <= X < device_table_size. They are ordered
in device-table order as specified to the mkfs.exofs command

Each OSD device  devX has following attributes :
	osdname - ReadOnly
	systemid - ReadOnly
	uri - Read/Write

It is up to user-mode to update devX/uri for support of
autologin.

These sysfs information are used both for autologin as well
as support for exporting exofs via a pNFSD server in user-mode.
