iwlwifi: move queue mapping out of transport

The queue mapping is not only dynamic, it
is also dependent on the uCode, as we can
already see today with the dual-mode and
non-dual-mode being different.

Move the queue mapping out of the transport
layer and let the higher layer manage it.
Part of the transport configuration is how
to set up the queues.
