DM RAID: Use md_error() in place of simply setting Faulty bit

When encountering an error while reading the superblock, call md_error.

We are currently setting the 'Faulty' bit on one of the array devices when an
error is encountered while reading the superblock of a dm-raid array.  We should
be calling md_error(), as it handles the error more completely.
