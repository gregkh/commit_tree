drm/i915: reinstate GM45 TV detection fix

This reverts commmit d4b74bf07873da2e94219a7b67a334fc1c3ce649 which
reverted the origin fix fb8b5a39b6310379d7b54c0c7113703a8eaf4a57.

We have at least 3 different bug reports that this fixes things and no
indication what is exactly wrong with this. So try again.

To make matters slightly more fun, the commit itself was cc: stable
whereas the revert has not been.

According to Peter Clifton he discussed this with Zhao Yakui and this
seems to be in contradiction of the GM45 PRM, but rumours have it that
this is how the BIOS does it ... let's see.
