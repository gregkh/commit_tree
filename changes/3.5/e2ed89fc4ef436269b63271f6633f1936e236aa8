ARM: OMAP: add includes for missing prototypes

Several C files in arch/arm/mach-omap* and arch/arm/plat-omap declare
functions that are used by other files, but don't include the header
file where the prototype is declared.  This results in the following
warnings from sparse:

Fix by including the appropriate header files.
