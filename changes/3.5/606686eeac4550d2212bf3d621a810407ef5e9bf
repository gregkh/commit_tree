Btrfs: use rcu to protect device->name

Al pointed out that we can just toss out the old name on a device and add a
new one arbitrarily, so anybody who uses device->name in printk could
possibly use free'd memory.  Instead of adding locking around all of this he
suggested doing it with RCU, so I've introduced a struct rcu_string that
does just that and have gone through and protected all accesses to
device->name that aren't under the uuid_mutex with rcu_read_lock().  This
protects us and I will use it for dealing with removing the device that we
used to mount the file system in a later patch.  Thanks,
