md/raid10: Introduce 'prev' geometry to support reshape.

When RAID10 supports reshape it will need a 'previous' and a 'current'
geometry, so introduce that here.
Use the 'prev' geometry when before the reshape_position, and the
current 'geo' when beyond it.  At other times, use both as
appropriate.

For now, both are identical (And reshape_position is never set).

When we use the 'prev' geometry, we must use the old data_offset.
When we use the current (And a reshape is happening) we must use
the new_data_offset.
