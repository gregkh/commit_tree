ext4: fix the free blocks calculation for ext3 file systems w/ uninit_bg

Ext3 filesystems that are converted to use as many ext4 file system
features as possible will enable uninit_bg to speed up e2fsck times.
These file systems will have a native ext3 layout of inode tables and
block allocation bitmaps (as opposed to ext4's flex_bg layout).
Unfortunately, in these cases, when first allocating a block in an
uninitialized block group, ext4 would incorrectly calculate the number
of free blocks in that block group, and then errorneously report that
the file system was corrupt:

EXT4-fs error (device vdd): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:741: group 30, 32254 clusters in bitmap, 32258 in gd

This problem can be reproduced via:

    mke2fs -q -t ext4 -O ^flex_bg /dev/vdd 5g
    mount -t ext4 /dev/vdd /mnt
    fallocate -l 4600m /mnt/test

The problem was caused by a bone headed mistake in the check to see if a
particular metadata block was part of the block group.

Many thanks to Kees Cook for finding and bisecting the buggy commit
which introduced this bug (commit fd034a84e1, present since v3.2).
