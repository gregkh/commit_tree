persistent_ram: Fix buffer size clamping during writes

This is a longstanding bug, almost unnoticeable when calling
persistent_ram_write() for small buffers.

But when called for large data buffers, the write routine behaves
incorrectly, as the size may never update: instead of clamping
the size to the maximum buffer size, buffer_size_add_clamp() returns
an error (which is never checked by the write routine, btw).

To fix this, we now use buffer_size_add() that actually clamps the
size to the max value.

Also remove buffer_size_add_clamp(), it is no longer needed.
