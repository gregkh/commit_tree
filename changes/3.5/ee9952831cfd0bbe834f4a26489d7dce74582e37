tcp: Initial repair mode

This includes (according the the previous description):

* TCP_REPAIR sockoption

This one just puts the socket in/out of the repair mode.
Allowed for CAP_NET_ADMIN and for closed/establised sockets only.
When repair mode is turned off and the socket happens to be in
the established state the window probe is sent to the peer to
'unlock' the connection.

* TCP_REPAIR_QUEUE sockoption

This one sets the queue which we're about to repair. The
'no-queue' is set by default.

* TCP_QUEUE_SEQ socoption

Sets the write_seq/rcv_nxt of a selected repaired queue.
Allowed for TCP_CLOSE-d sockets only. When the socket changes
its state the other seq-s are changed by the kernel according
to the protocol rules (most of the existing code is actually
reused).

* Ability to forcibly bind a socket to a port

The sk->sk_reuse is set to SK_FORCE_REUSE.

* Immediate connect modification

The connect syscall initializes the connection, then directly jumps
to the code which finalizes it.

* Silent close modification

The close just aborts the connection (similar to SO_LINGER with 0
time) but without sending any FIN/RST-s to peer.
