mm/memcg: apply add/del_page to lruvec

Take lruvec further: pass it instead of zone to add_page_to_lru_list() and
del_page_from_lru_list(); and pagevec_lru_move_fn() pass lruvec down to
its target functions.

This cleanup eliminates a swathe of cruft in memcontrol.c, including
mem_cgroup_lru_add_list(), mem_cgroup_lru_del_list() and
mem_cgroup_lru_move_lists() - which never actually touched the lists.

In their place, mem_cgroup_page_lruvec() to decide the lruvec, previously
a side-effect of add, and mem_cgroup_update_lru_size() to maintain the
lru_size stats.

Whilst these are simplifications in their own right, the goal is to bring
the evaluation of lruvec next to the spin_locking of the lrus, in
preparation for a future patch.
