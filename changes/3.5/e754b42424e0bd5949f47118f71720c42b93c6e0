[SCSI] hpsa: do not skip disabled devices

There was code to skip "disabled" devices which was intended to
skip devices disabled in the BIOS, but it really just checks to
see if the device can write to host memory, which this is disabled
by pci_disable_device on driver unload, so this check has the effect
of preventing subsequent load of the driver.  And devices disabled in
the BIOS don't show up at all anyway, so this check never made any
sense to begin with, and should be removed.
