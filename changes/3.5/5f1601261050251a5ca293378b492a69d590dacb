acpi_pad: fix power_saving thread deadlock

The acpi_pad driver can get stuck in destroy_power_saving_task()
waiting for kthread_stop() to stop a power_saving thread.  The problem
is that the isolated_cpus_lock mutex is owned when
destroy_power_saving_task() calls kthread_stop(), which waits for a
power_saving thread to end, and the power_saving thread tries to
acquire the isolated_cpus_lock when it calls round_robin_cpu().  This
patch fixes the issue by making round_robin_cpu() use its own mutex.
