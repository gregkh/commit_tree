drm/i915: Introduce for_each_ring() macro

In many places we wish to iterate over the rings associated with the
GPU, so refactor them to use a common macro.

Along the way, there are a few code removals that should be side-effect
free and some rearrangement which should only have a cosmetic impact,
such as error-state.

Note that this slightly changes the semantics in the hangcheck code:
We now always cycle through all enabled rings instead of
short-circuiting the logic.

v2: Pull in a couple of suggestions from Ben and Daniel for
intel_ring_initialized() and not removing the warning (just moving them
to a new home, closer to the error).
