KVM: x86 emulator: add support for vector alignment

x86 defines three classes of vector instructions: explicitly
aligned (#GP(0) if unaligned, explicitly unaligned, and default
(which depends on the encoding: AVX is unaligned, SSE is aligned).

Add support for marking an instruction as explicitly aligned or
unaligned, and mark MOVDQU as unaligned.
