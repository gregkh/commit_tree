ARM: dma-mapping: use PMD size for section unmap

The dma_contiguous_remap() function clears existing section maps using
the wrong size (PGDIR_SIZE instead of PMD_SIZE).  This is a bug which
does not affect non-LPAE systems, where PGDIR_SIZE and PMD_SIZE are the same.
On LPAE systems, however, this bug causes the kernel to hang at this point.

This fix has been tested on both LPAE and non-LPAE kernel builds.
