PM: Rename CAP_EPOLLWAKEUP to CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND

As discussed in
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1249726/focus=1288990,
the capability introduced in 4d7e30d98939a0340022ccd49325a3d70f7e0238
to govern EPOLLWAKEUP seems misnamed: this capability is about governing
the ability to suspend the system, not using a particular API flag
(EPOLLWAKEUP). We should make the name of the capability more general
to encourage reuse in related cases. (Whether or not this capability
should also be used to govern the use of /sys/power/wake_lock is a
question that needs to be separately resolved.)

This patch renames the capability to CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND. In order to ensure
that the old capability name doesn't make it out into the wild, could you
please apply and push up the tree to ensure that it is incorporated
for the 3.5 release.
