stmmac: re-work the internal GMAC DMA platf parameters

This patch re-works the internal GMAC DMA parameters
passed from the platform.
In the past, we only passed the pbl but, with new core,
other parameters can be passed and are mandatory on some
platforms.

New parameters are documented in stmmac.txt because this
patch has an impact for many platforms.
