drm/i915: enable power wells on Haswell init

This attempts to enable all the available power wells during the
initialization.

Those power wells can be enabled in parallel or on-demand, and disabled
when no longer needed, but this is out of scope of this initial
enablement. Proper tracking of who uses which power well will require
a considerable rework of our display handling, so we just leave them all
enabled when the driver is loaded for now.

v2: use more generic and future-proof code
