xhci: Fix invalid loop check in xhci_free_tt_info()

xhci_free_tt_info() may access the invalid memory when it removes the
last entry but the list is not empty.  Then tt_next reaches to the
list head but it still tries to check the tt_info of that entry.

This patch fixes the bug and cleans up the messy code by rewriting
with a simple list_for_each_entry_safe().

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that contain
the commit 839c817ce67178ca3c7c7ad534c571bba1e69ebe "xhci: Store
information about roothubs and TTs."
