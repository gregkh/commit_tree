drm/i915: Only the zap the VMA after updating the tiling parameters

If we fail to unbind and so abort the change in tiling, we will have
removed the VMA for the object for no reason. The likelihood of unbind
failing is slim (other than ERESTARTSYS which will cause userspace to
try again), so the change is mostly for the principle.

Also improve the slightly stale comment.
