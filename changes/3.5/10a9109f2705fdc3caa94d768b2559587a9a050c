mac80211: destroy assoc_data correctly if assoc fails

If association failed due to internal error (e.g. no
supported rates IE), we call ieee80211_destroy_assoc_data()
with assoc=true, while we actually reject the association.

This results in the BSSID not being zeroed out.

After passing assoc=false, we no longer have to call
sta_info_destroy_addr() explicitly. While on it, move
the "associated" message after the assoc_success check.
