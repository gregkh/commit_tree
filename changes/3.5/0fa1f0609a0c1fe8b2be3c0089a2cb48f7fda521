ARM: Orion: Fix Virtual/Physical mixup with watchdog

The orion watchdog is expecting to be passed the physcial address of
the hardware, and will ioremap() it to give a virtual address it will
use as the base address for the hardware. However, when creating the
platform resource record, a virtual address was being used.

Add the necassary #define's so we can pass the physical address as
expected.

Tested on Kirkwood and Orion5x.
