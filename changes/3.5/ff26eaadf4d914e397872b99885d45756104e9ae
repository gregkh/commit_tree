blkcg: tg_stats_alloc_lock is an irq lock

tg_stats_alloc_lock nests inside queue lock and should always be held
with irq disabled.  throtl_pd_{init|exit}() were using non-irqsafe
spinlock ops which triggered inverse lock ordering via irq warning via
RCU freeing of blkg invoking throtl_pd_exit() w/o disabling IRQ.

Update both functions to use irq safe operations.
