regulator: tps65023: Fix mask for LDOs output voltage select control

According to the datasheet:
The LDO_CTRL registers are used to set the output voltage of LDO1 and LDO2.
LDO_CTRL[7] and LDO_CTRL[3] are reserved and should always be written to 0.

Thus the mask for TPS65023_LDO_1 and TPS65023_LDO_2 should be 0x07 and 0x70
respectively.
