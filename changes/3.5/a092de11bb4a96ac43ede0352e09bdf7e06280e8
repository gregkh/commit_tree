i2c: pnx: add device tree support

This patch adds device tree support to the pnx-i2c driver by using platform
resources for memory region and irq and removing dependency on mach includes.

The following platforms are affected:

* PNX
* LPC31xx (WIP)
* LPC32xx

The patch is based on a patch by Jon Smirl, working on lpc31xx integration
