ceph: rename prepare_connect_authorizer()

Change the name of prepare_connect_authorizer().  The next
patch is going to make this function no longer add anything to the
connection's out_kvec, so it will no longer fit the pattern of
the rest of the prepare_connect_*() functions.

In addition, pass the address of a variable that will hold the
authorization protocol to use.  Move the assignment of that to the
connection's out_connect structure into prepare_write_connect().
