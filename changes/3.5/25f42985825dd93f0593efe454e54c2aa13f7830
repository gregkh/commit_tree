perf/x86: Fix broken LBR fixup code

I noticed that the LBR fixups were not working anymore
on programs where they used to. I tracked this down to
a recent change to copy_from_user_nmi():

 db0dc75d640 ("perf/x86: Check user address explicitly in copy_from_user_nmi()")

This commit added a call to __range_not_ok() to the
copy_from_user_nmi() routine. The problem is that the logic
of the test must be reversed. __range_not_ok() returns 0 if the
range is VALID. We want to return early from copy_from_user_nmi()
if the range is NOT valid.
