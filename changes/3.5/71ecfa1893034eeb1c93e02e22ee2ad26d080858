mac80211: clean up remain-on-channel on interface stop

When any interface goes down, it could be the one that we
were doing a remain-on-channel with. We therefore need to
cancel the remain-on-channel and flush the related work
structs so they don't run after the interface has been
removed or even destroyed.

It's also possible in this case that an off-channel SKB
was never transmitted, so free it if this is the case.
Note that this can also happen if the driver finishes
the off-channel period without ever starting it.
