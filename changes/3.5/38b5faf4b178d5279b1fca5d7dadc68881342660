mm: frontswap: core swap subsystem hooks and headers

This patch, 2of4, contains the changes to the core swap subsystem.
This includes:

(1) makes available core swap data structures (swap_lock, swap_list and
swap_info) that are needed by frontswap.c but we don't need to expose them
to the dozens of files that include swap.h so we create a new swapfile.h
just to extern-ify these and modify their declarations to non-static

(2) adds frontswap-related elements to swap_info_struct.  Frontswap_map
points to vzalloc'ed one-bit-per-swap-page metadata that indicates
whether the swap page is in frontswap or in the device and frontswap_pages
counts how many pages are in frontswap.

(3) adds hooks in the swap subsystem and extends try_to_unuse so that
frontswap_shrink can do a "partial swapoff".

Note that a failed frontswap_map allocation is safe... failure is noted
by lack of "FS" in the subsequent printk.
