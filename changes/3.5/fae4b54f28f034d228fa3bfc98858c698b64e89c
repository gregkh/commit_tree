rcu: Introduce rcutorture testing for rcu_barrier()

Although rcutorture does invoke rcu_barrier() and friends, it cannot
really be called a torture test given that it invokes them only once
at the end of the test.  This commit therefore introduces heavy-duty
rcutorture testing for rcu_barrier(), which may be carried out
concurrently with normal rcutorture testing.
