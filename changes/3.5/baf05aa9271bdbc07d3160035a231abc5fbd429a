bug: introduce BUILD_BUG_ON_INVALID() macro

Sometimes we want to check some expressions correctness at compile time.
"(void)(e);" or "if (e);" can be dangerous if the expression has
side-effects, and gcc sometimes generates a lot of code, even if the
expression has no effect.

This patch introduces macro BUILD_BUG_ON_INVALID() for such checks, it
forces a compilation error if expression is invalid without any extra
code.

[Cast to "long" required because sizeof does not work for bit-fields.]
