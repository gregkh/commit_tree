KVM: PPC: Emulator: clean up SPR reads and writes

When reading and writing SPRs, every SPR emulation piece had to read
or write the respective GPR the value was read from or stored in itself.

This approach is pretty prone to failure. What if we accidentally
implement mfspr emulation where we just do "break" and nothing else?
Suddenly we would get a random value in the return register - which is
always a bad idea.

So let's consolidate the generic code paths and only give the core
specific SPR handling code readily made variables to read/write from/to.

Functionally, this patch doesn't change anything, but it increases the
readability of the code and makes is less prone to bugs.
