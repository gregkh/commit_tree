x86, efi: Only close open files in error path

The loop at the 'close_handles' label in handle_ramdisks() should be
using 'i', which represents the number of initrd files that were
successfully opened, not 'nr_initrds' which is the number of initrd=
arguments passed on the command line.

Currently, if we execute the loop to close all file handles and we
failed to open any initrds we'll try to call the close function on a
garbage pointer, causing the machine to hang.
