batman-adv: check incoming packet type for bla

If the gateway functionality is used, some broadcast packets (DHCP
requests) may be transmitted as unicast packets. As the bridge loop
avoidance code now only considers the payload Ethernet destination,
it may drop the DHCP request for clients which are claimed by other
backbone gateways, because it falsely infers from the broadcast address
that the right backbone gateway should havehandled the broadcast.

Fix this by checking and delegating the batman-adv packet type used
for transmission.
