HID: usbhid: fix error handling of not enough bandwidth

In case IO cannot be started because there is a lack of bandwidth
on the bus, it makes no sense to reset the device. If IO is requested
because the device is opened, user space should be notified with
an error right away. If the lack of bandwidth arises later, for
example after resume, there's no other choice but to retry in the
hope that bandwidth will be freed.
