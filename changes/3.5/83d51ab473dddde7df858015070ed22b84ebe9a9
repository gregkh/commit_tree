xen/setup: update VA mapping when releasing memory during setup

In xen_memory_setup(), if a page that is being released has a VA
mapping this must also be updated.  Otherwise, the page will be not
released completely -- it will still be referenced in Xen and won't be
freed util the mapping is removed and this prevents it from being
reallocated at a different PFN.

This was already being done for the ISA memory region in
xen_ident_map_ISA() but on many systems this was omitting a few pages
as many systems marked a few pages below the ISA memory region as
reserved in the e820 map.

This fixes errors such as:

(XEN) page_alloc.c:1148:d0 Over-allocation for domain 0: 2097153 > 2097152
(XEN) memory.c:133:d0 Could not allocate order=0 extent: id=0 memflags=0 (0 of 17)
