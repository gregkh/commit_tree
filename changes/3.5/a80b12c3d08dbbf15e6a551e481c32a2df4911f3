quota: Get rid of nested I_MUTEX_QUOTA locking subclass

So far i_mutex was ranking above dqonoff_mutex and i_mutex on quota files
was special and ranking below dqonoff_mutex (and several other locks).
However there's no real need for i_mutex on quota files to be special.
IO on quota files is serialized by dqio_mutex anyway so we don't need to
take i_mutex when writing to quota files. Other places where we take i_mutex
on quota file can accomodate standard i_mutex lock ranking, we only need
to change the lock ranking to be dqonoff_mutex > i_mutex which is a matter
of changing documentation because there's no place which would enforce
ordering in the other direction.
