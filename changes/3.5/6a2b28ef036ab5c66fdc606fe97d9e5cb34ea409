Revert "niu: Add support for byte queue limits."

This reverts commit efa230f2c68abab817f13473077f8d0cc74f43f3.

BQL doesn't work with how this driver currently only takes TX
interrupts every 1/4 of the TX ring.  That behavior needs to be fixed,
but that's a larger non-trivial task and for now we have to revert
BQL support as this makes the device currently completely unusable.
