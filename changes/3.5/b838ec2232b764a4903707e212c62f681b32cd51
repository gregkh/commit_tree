ext2: Remove s_dirt handling

Places which modify superblock feature / state fields mark the superblock
buffer dirty so it is written out by flusher thread. Thus there's no need to
set s_dirt there.

The only other fields changing in the superblock are the numbers of free
blocks, free inodes and s_wtime. There's no real need to write (or even
compute) these periodically. Free blocks / inodes counters are recomputed on
every mount from group counters anyway and value of s_wtime is only
informational and imprecise anyway. So it should be enough to write these
opportunistically on mount, remount, umount, and sync_fs times.
