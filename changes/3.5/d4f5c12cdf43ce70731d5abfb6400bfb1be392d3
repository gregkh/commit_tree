tipc: Ensure network address change doesn't impact name table updates

Revises routines that add and remove an entry from a node's name table
so that the publication scope lists are updated properly even if the
node's network address is changed in mid-operation. The routines now
recognize the default node address of <0.0.0> as an alias for "this node"
even after a new network address has been assigned.
