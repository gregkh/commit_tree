gpiolib: Implement devm_gpio_request_one()

Allow drivers to use the modern request and configure idiom together
with devres.

As with plain gpio_request() and gpio_request_one() we can't implement
the old school version in terms of _one() as this would force the
explicit selection of a direction in gpio_request() which could break
systems if we pick the wrong one.  Implementing devm_gpio_request_one()
in terms of devm_gpio_request() would needlessly complicate things or
lead to duplication from the unmanaged version depending on how it's
done.
