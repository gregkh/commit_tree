mtd: bitflip_threshold added to mtd_info and sysfs

An element 'bitflip_threshold' is added to struct mtd_info, and also exposed as
a read/write variable in sysfs.  This will be used to determine whether or not
mtd_read() returns -EUCLEAN or 0 (absent a hard error).  If the driver leaves it
as zero, mtd will set it to a default value of ecc_strength.

This v2 adds the line that propagates bitflip_threshold from the master to the
partitions - thanks Ivan¹.
