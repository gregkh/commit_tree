mm: bootmem: split out goal-to-node mapping from goal dropping

Matching the desired goal to the right node is one thing, dropping the
goal when it can not be satisfied is another.  Split this into separate
functions so that subsequent patches can use the node-finding but drop and
handle the goal fallback on their own terms.
