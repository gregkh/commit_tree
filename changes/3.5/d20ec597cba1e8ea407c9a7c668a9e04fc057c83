[SCSI] scsi_pm: resume device if suspend failed

For scsi devices which use scsi bus runtime callback, runtime suspend
will call scsi_dev_type_suspend, and if the drv->suspend failed, the
device will still be in active state. But since scsi_device_quiesce is
called, the device will not be able to respond any more commands.
So add a check here to see if err occured, if so, bring the device back
to normal state with scsi_device_resume.
