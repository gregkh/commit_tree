printk: Implement some unlocked kmsg_dump functions

If used from KDB, the locked variants are prone to deadlocks (suppose we
got to the debugger w/ the logbuf lock held).

So, we have to implement a few routines that grab no logbuf lock.

Yet we don't need these functions in modules, so we don't export them.
