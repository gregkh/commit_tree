ALSA: usb-audio: Fix the first PCM interface assignment

In the new PCM streaming logic, the interface number is assigned to
usb stream instance (subs->interface) after the format and rate setups
are succeeded, but some codes are still passing subs->interface as the
reference to helper functions.  This leads to initializing with an
invalid iface number (-1).

This patch replaces the wrong references with the ones from the target
fmt correctly.
