Bluetooth: Fix using uninitialized option in RFCMode

If remote device sends bogus RFC option with invalid length,
undefined options values are used. Fix this by using defaults when
remote misbehaves.

This also fixes the following warning reported by gcc 4.7.0:

net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c: In function 'l2cap_config_rsp':
