sched: Change rq->nr_running to unsigned int

Since there's a PID space limit of 30bits (see
futex.h:FUTEX_TID_MASK) and allocating that many tasks (assuming a
lower bound of 2 pages per task) would still take 8T of memory it
seems reasonable to say that unsigned int is sufficient for
rq->nr_running.

When we do get anywhere near that amount of tasks I suspect other
things would go funny, load-balancer load computations would really
need to be hoisted to 128bit etc.

So save a few bytes and convert rq->nr_running and friends to
unsigned int.
