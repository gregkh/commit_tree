MIPS: Netlogic: Fix TLB size of boot CPU.

Starting other threads in the core will change the number of
TLB entries of a CPU.  Re-calculate current_cpu_data.tlbsize
on the boot cpu after enabling and waking up other threads.

The secondary CPUs do not need this logic because the threads
are enabled on the secondary cores at wakeup and before cpu_probe.
