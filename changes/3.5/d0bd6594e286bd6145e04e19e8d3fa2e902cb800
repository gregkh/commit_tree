userns: Deprecate and rename the user_namespace reference in the user_struct

With a user_ns reference in struct cred the only user of the user namespace
reference in struct user_struct is to keep the uid hash table alive.

The user_namespace reference in struct user_struct will be going away soon, and
I have removed all of the references.  Rename the field from user_ns to _user_ns
so that the compiler can verify nothing follows the user struct to the user
namespace anymore.
