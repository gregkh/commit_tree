virtio-balloon: fix add/get API use

Since ee7cd8981e15bcb365fc762afe3fc47b8242f630 'virtio: expose added
descriptors immediately.', in virtio balloon virtqueue_get_buf might
now run concurrently with virtqueue_kick.  I audited both and this
seems safe in practice but this is not guaranteed by the API.
Additionally, a spurious interrupt might in theory make
virtqueue_get_buf run in parallel with virtqueue_add_buf, which is
racy.

While we might try to protect against spurious callbacks it's
easier to fix the driver: balloon seems to be the only one
(mis)using the API like this, so let's just fix balloon.
