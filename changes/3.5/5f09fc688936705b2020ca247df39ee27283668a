perf/x86: Fix cmpxchg() usage in amd_put_event_constraints()

Now the return value of cmpxchg() is used to match an event. The
change removes the duplicate event comparison and traverses the list
until an event was removed. This also fixes the following warning:

 arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event_amd.c:170: warning: value computed is not used
