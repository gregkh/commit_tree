drm/i915: implement SNB workaround for lazy global gtt

PIPE_CONTROL on snb needs global gtt mappings in place to workaround a
hw gotcha. No other commands need such a workaround. Luckily we can
detect a PIPE_CONTROL commands easily because they have a write_domain
= I915_GEM_DOMAIN_INSTRUCTION (and nothing else has that).

v2: Binding the target of such a reloc into the global gtt actually
works instead of binding the source, which is rather pointless ...

v3: Kill a superflous has_global_gtt_mapping assignement noticed by
Chris Wilson.
