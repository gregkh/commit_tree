linux/irq.h: fix kernel-doc warning

Fix kernel-doc warning.  This struct member was removed in commit
875682648b89 ("irq: Remove irq_chip->release()") so remove its
associated kernel-doc entry also.

  Warning(include/linux/irq.h:338): Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'release' description in 'irq_chip'
