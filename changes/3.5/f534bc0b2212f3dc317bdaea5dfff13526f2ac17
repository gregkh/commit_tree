drm/i915: disallow gem init ioctl on ilk

Ums is already disabled, but on ilk we can additionally disable gem
initialization when using user mode setting. Upstream never support
ilk without kernel modesetting and not even the RHEL ilk ums backport
needs gem - that driver is based on xf86-video-intel version 2.2,
which is pre-gem.
