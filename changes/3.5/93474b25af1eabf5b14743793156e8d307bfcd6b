KVM: Remove unused dirty_bitmap_head and nr_dirty_pages

Now that we do neither double buffering nor heuristic selection of the
write protection method these are not needed anymore.

Note: some drivers have their own implementation of set_bit_le() and
making it generic needs a bit of work; so we use test_and_set_bit_le()
and will later replace it with generic set_bit_le().
