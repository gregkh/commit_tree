xfs: allow assigning the tail lsn with the AIL lock held

Provide a variant of xlog_assign_tail_lsn that has the AIL lock already
held.  By doing so we do an additional atomic_read + atomic_set under
the lock, which comes down to two instructions.

Switch xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk and xfs_trans_ail_delete_bulk to the
new version to reduce the number of lock roundtrips, and prepare for
a new addition that would require a third lock roundtrip in
xfs_trans_ail_delete_bulk.  This addition is also the reason for
slightly rearranging the conditionals and relying on xfs_log_space_wake
for checking that the filesystem has been shut down internally.
