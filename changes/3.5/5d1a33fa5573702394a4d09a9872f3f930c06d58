vt: push the tty_lock down into the map handling

When we do this it becomes clear the lock we should be holding is the vc
lock, and in fact many of our other helpers are properly invoked this way.

We don't at this point guarantee not to race the keyboard code but the results
of that appear harmless and that was true before we started as well.

We now have no users of tty_lock in the console driver...
