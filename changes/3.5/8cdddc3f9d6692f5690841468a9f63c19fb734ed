usb/net: rndis: eliminate first set of duplicate OIDs

The RNDIS protocol contains a vast number of Object ID:s (OIDs).
The current definitions had multiple definitions of these ID:s,
let's use the nicely RNDIS_*-prefixed defines from the HyperV
implementation, rename everywhere they're used, and copy+rename
the few that were missing from this list of objects.
