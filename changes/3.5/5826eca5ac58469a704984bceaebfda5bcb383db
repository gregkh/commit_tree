drm/i915: properly check for pipe count

As suggested by Chris Wilson and Daniel Vetter, this chunk of code can be
simplified with a more simple check.

Also, as noticed by Jesse Barnes, it is worth mentioning that plane is an
enum and num_pipe is an int, so we could be more paranoid here about those
validation checks eventually.
