ipv6: fib: fix fib dump restart

Commit 2bec5a369ee79576a3 (ipv6: fib: fix crash when changing large fib
while dumping it) introduced ability to restart the dump at tree root,
but failed to skip correctly a count of already dumped entries. Code
didn't match Patrick intent.

We must skip exactly the number of already dumped entries.

Note that like other /proc/net files or netlink producers, we could
still dump some duplicates entries.
