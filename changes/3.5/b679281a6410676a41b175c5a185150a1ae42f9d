block: restructure get_request()

get_request() is structured a bit unusually in that failure path is
inlined in the usual flow with goto labels atop and inside it.
Relocate the error path to the end of the function.

This is to prepare for icq handling changes in get_request() and
doesn't introduce any behavior change.
