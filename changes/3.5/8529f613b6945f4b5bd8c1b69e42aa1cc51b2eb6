vfs: don't force a big memset of stat data just to clear padding fields

Admittedly this is something that the compiler should be able to just do
for us, but gcc just isn't that smart.  And trying to use a structure
initializer (which would get us the right semantics) ends up resulting
in gcc allocating stack space for _two_ 'struct stat', and then copying
one into the other.

So do it by hand - just have a per-architecture macro that initializes
the padding fields.  And if the architecture doesn't provide one, fall
back to the old behavior of just doing the whole memset() first.
