mtd: nand: fix incorrect ecc strength values

This fixes a couple of ecc strength values for which I earlier made conservative
guesses, but whose correct values were later determined¹ (thanks Ivan).  Also
sets strength for fsl_ifc_nand, which was merged to mainline after the original
patch that set the strength for all drivers.
