net/mlx4_core: Fixes for VF / Guest startup flow

- pass the following parameters:
  - firmware version (added QUERY_FW paravirtualization for that)

  - disable Blueflame on slaves. KVM disables write combining on guests,
    and we get better performance without BF in this case. (This requires
    QUERY_DEV_CAP paravirtualization, also in this commit)

  - max qp rdma as destination

- get rid of a chunk of "if (0)" dead code
