ARM: OMAP2+: nand: Make board_onenand_init() visible to board code

board_onenand_init() and board_nand_init() initialization functions are
used to initialize OneNAND and NAND memories respectively. But only
board_nand_init() was visible to be used from board code. This patch makes
possible to initialize a OneNAND flash memory within platform code.
