ALSA: hda - Always resume the codec immediately

This is a fix for the problem in commit 785f857d1c, the pop noise
issue on some machines with ALC269.  The problem was the uninitialized
state after the resume due to the delayed resume of the codec chips.
In that commit, we tried to fix by forcibly putting the codec to D3 at
suspend.  But, this still also leaves the uninitialized state after
resume, and it _might_ be still problematic with some BIOS.  Since the
commit turned out to regress another issues, we reverted it in the
end.

Now, in this fix, try to fix by turning on the codec immediately at
the resume path.  We need to take care of the power-saving in this
case.  When the device is woken up at the power-saved state, it should
go power-saving again after the resume.
