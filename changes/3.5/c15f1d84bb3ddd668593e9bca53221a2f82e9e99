ARM: OMAP2+: voltage: ensure voltage used is exact voltage from OPP table

When using the SMPS regulators to scale voltages, the regulator
framework may pass a minimum voltage that is not an exact OPP voltage.
For the VC/VP controlled voltage domains, we must ensure that the
voltage requested is the exact voltage from the OPP table.  This is
especially critical when using SR.

To fix, voltdm_scale() uses the target voltage passed to walk through
the OPP voltages until it finds a voltage that is >= one of the OPP
voltages.
