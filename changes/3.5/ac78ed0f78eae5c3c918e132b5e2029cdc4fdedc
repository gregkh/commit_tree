isci: Handle all suspending TC completions

Add comprehensive decode for all TC completions that generate RNC
suspensions.

Note that this commit also removes unconditional resumptions of ATAPI
devices when in the SCI_STP_DEV_ATAPI_ERROR state, and STP devices
when in the SCI_STP_DEV_IDLE state. This is because the SCI_STP_DEV_IDLE
and SCI_STP_DEV_ATAPI state entry functions manage the RNC resumption.
