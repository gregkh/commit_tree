OMAPDSS: fix registration of DPI and SDI devices

The omapdss arch initialization code registers all the output devices as
omap_devices. However, DPI and SDI are not proper omap_devices, as they
do not have any corresponding HWMOD. This leads to crashes or problems
when the platform code tries to use omap_device functions for DPI and
SDI devices.

One such crash was reported by John Stultz <johnstul@us.ibm.com>:

DPI and SDI can be plain platform_devices. This patch changes the
registration from omap_device_register() to platform_device_add().
