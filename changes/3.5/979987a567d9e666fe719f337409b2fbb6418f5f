perf stat: handle ENXIO error for perf_event_open

perf stat on PPC currently fails to run:

$ perf stat -- sleep 1
  Error: open_counter returned with 6 (No such device or address). /bin/dmesg may provide additional information.

  Fatal: Not all events could be opened.

The problem is that until 2.6.37 (behavior changed with commit b0a873e)
perf on PPC returns ENXIO when hw_perf_event_init() fails. With this
patch we get the expected behavior:

$ perf stat -v -- sleep 1
cycles event is not supported by the kernel.
stalled-cycles-frontend event is not supported by the kernel.
stalled-cycles-backend event is not supported by the kernel.
instructions event is not supported by the kernel.
branches event is not supported by the kernel.
branch-misses event is not supported by the kernel.
