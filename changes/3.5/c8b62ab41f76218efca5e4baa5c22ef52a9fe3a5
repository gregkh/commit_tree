ARM: tegra: Add pllc clock init table

pll_c will be used as a clock source. Fill in tegra_pll_c_freq_table[]
so that it's possible to explicitly initialize the PLL.

NVIDIA's downstream nv-3.1 kernel and the ChromeOS kernel have different
pll_c tables. nv-3.1 contains entries for 522MHz and 598MHz output,
whereas the ChromeOS kernel contains entries for 600MHz output. I chose
to upstream the ChromeOS values for now, since the 600MHz rate appears
to match the default rate of this PLL when the HW boots, and it's not
clear to me why 522 or 598MHz are more useful.
