watchdog, hpwdt: Remove priority option for NMI callback

The NMI_UNKNOWN bucket only allows for one function to register
to it. The reason for that is because only functions which can
not determine if the NMI belongs to them or not should register
and would like to assume/swallow any NMI they see.

As a result it doesn't make sense to let more than one function
like this register.  In fact, letting a second function fail
allows us to know that more than one function is going to
swallow NMIs on the current system. This is better than silently
being ignored.

Therefore hpwdt's priority mechanism doesn't make sense any
more.  They will be always first on the NMI_UNKNOWN queue, if
they register.

Removing this parameter cleans up the code and simplifies things
for the next patch which changes how nmis are registered.
