uprobes/core: Decrement uprobe count before the pages are unmapped

Uprobes has a callback (uprobe_munmap()) in the unmap path to
maintain the uprobes count.

In the exit path this callback gets called in unlink_file_vma().
However by the time unlink_file_vma() is called, the pages would
have been unmapped (in unmap_vmas()) and the task->rss_stat counts
accounted (in zap_pte_range()).

If the exiting process has probepoints, uprobe_munmap() checks if
the breakpoint instruction was around before decrementing the probe
count.

This results in a file backed page being reread by uprobe_munmap()
and hence it does not find the breakpoint.

This patch fixes this problem by moving the callback to
unmap_single_vma(). Since unmap_single_vma() may not unmap the
complete vma, add start and end parameters to uprobe_munmap().

This bug became apparent courtesy of commit c3f0327f8e9d
("mm: add rss counters consistency check").
