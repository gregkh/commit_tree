[SCSI] libsas: fix taskfile corruption in sas_ata_qc_fill_rtf

fill_result_tf() grabs the taskfile flags from the originating qc which
sas_ata_qc_fill_rtf() promptly overwrites.  The presence of an
ata_taskfile in the sata_device makes it tempting to just copy the full
contents in sas_ata_qc_fill_rtf().  However, libata really only wants
the fis contents and expects the other portions of the taskfile to not
be touched by ->qc_fill_rtf.  To that end store a fis buffer in the
sata_device and use ata_tf_from_fis() like every other ->qc_fill_rtf()
implementation.
