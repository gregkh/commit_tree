Btrfs: resolve tree mod log locking issue in btrfs_next_leaf

With the tree mod log, we may end up with two roots (the current root and a
rewinded version of it) both pointing to two leaves, l1 and l2, of which l2
had already been cow-ed in the current transaction. If we don't rewind any
tree blocks, we cannot have two roots both pointing to an already cowed tree
block.

Now there is btrfs_next_leaf, which has a leaf locked and wants a lock on
the next (right) leaf. And there is push_leaf_left, which has a (cowed!)
leaf locked and wants a lock on the previous (left) leaf.

In order to solve this dead lock situation, we use try_lock in
btrfs_next_leaf (only in case it's called with a tree mod log time_seq
paramter) and if we fail to get a lock on the next leaf, we give up our lock
on the current leaf and retry from the very beginning.
