x86, realmode: realmode.bin infrastructure

Create realmode.bin and realmode.relocs files. Piggy
pack them into relocatable object that will be included
into .init.data section of the main kernel image.

The first file includes binary image of the real-mode code.
The latter file includes all relocations. The layout of the
binary image is specified in realmode.lds.S. The makefile
generates pa_ prefixed symbols for each exported global.
These are used in 32-bit code and in realmode header to
define symbols that need to be relocated.
