drm/i915: allow the existing error_state to be destroyed

... by writing (anything) to i915_error_state.

This way we can simulate a bunch of gpu hangs and run the error_state
capture code every time (without the need to reload the module).

To make that happen we need to abandon the simple seq_file wrappers
provided by the drm core. While at it put the new error_state
refcounting to some good use and associated the error_state to the
debugfs when opening the file. Otherwise the error_state could change
while someone is reading it. This should help greatly when we finally
get around to split up the giant single seq_file block that the
error_state file currently is into smaller parts.

v2: Actually squash all the fixes into the patch ...
