dm persistent data: fix allocation failure in space map checker init

If CONFIG_DM_DEBUG_SPACE_MAPS is enabled and memory is fragmented and a
sufficiently-large metadata device is used in a thin pool then the space
map checker will fail to allocate the memory it requires.

Switch from kmalloc to vmalloc to allow larger virtually contiguous
allocations for the space map checker's internal count arrays.
