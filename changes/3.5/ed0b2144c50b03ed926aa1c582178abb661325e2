target: Handle GET_EVENT_STATUS_NOTIFICATION passthrough

The SCSI MMC GET_EVENT_STATUS_NOTIFICATION command can be used to find
out about media change, among other things.  This patch adds it to the
command sequencer so that PSCSI CD-ROM passthrough works with modern
Linux guests that issue this command.
