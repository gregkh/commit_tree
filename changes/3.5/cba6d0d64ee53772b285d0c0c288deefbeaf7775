Revert "rcu: Move PREEMPT_RCU preemption to switch_to() invocation"

This reverts commit 616c310e83b872024271c915c1b9ab505b9efad9.
(Move PREEMPT_RCU preemption to switch_to() invocation).
Testing by Sasha Levin <levinsasha928@gmail.com> showed that this
can result in deadlock due to invoking the scheduler when one of
the runqueue locks is held.  Because this commit was simply a
performance optimization, revert it.
