USB: ehci-fsl: Use usb_put_transceiver instead of put_device

Currently usb_put_transceiver calls put_device so this is a no-op but it
is better to keep API usage consistent as ehci->transceiver is allocated
with usb_get_transceiver.

While at there remove one extra ehci->transceiver test as the code block
has already tested it.
