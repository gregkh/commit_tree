ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: Force HDMI in no-idle while enabled

As per the OMAP4 documentation, audio over HDMI must be transmitted in
no-idle mode. This patch adds the HWMOD_SWSUP_SIDLE so that omap_hwmod uses
no-idle/force-idle settings instead of smart-idle mode.

This is required as the DSS interface clock is used as functional clock
for the HDMI wrapper audio FIFO. If no-idle mode is not used, audio could
be choppy, have bad quality or not be audible at all.
