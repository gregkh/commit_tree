sparc64: Fix several bugs in quad floating point emulation.

UltraSPARC-T2 and later do not use the fp_exception_other trap and do
not set the floating point trap type field in the %fsr at all when you
try to execute an unimplemented FPU operation.

Instead, it uses the illegal_instruction trap and it leaves the
floating point trap type field clear.

So we should not validate the %fsr trap type field when do_mathemu()
is invoked from the illegal instruction handler.

Also, the floating point trap type field is 3 bits, not 4 bits.
