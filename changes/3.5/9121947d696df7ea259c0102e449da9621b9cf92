ALSA: hda - Check the dead HDMI audio controller by vga-switcheroo

When a discrete-GPU is disabled by the VGA switcheroo, the
corresponding HD-audio controller for HDMI output is also disabled.
Such a dead controller still appears in the PCI device list, but you
can't access properly any longer (even calling pci_read_config_*()
triggers Oops!) which leads the stall of the whole communication of
the driver.

This patch adds a check of graphics controller at the probe time to
see whether it's disabled by vga-switcheroo.  If disabled, skip the
whole initialization of this controller.
