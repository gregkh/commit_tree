drm/i915: Avoid a double-read of PCH_IIR during interrupt handling

Currently the code re-reads PCH_IIR during the hotplug interrupt
processing. Not only is this a wasted read, but introduces a potential
for handling a spurious interrupt as we then may not clear all the
interrupts processed (since the re-read IIR may contains more interrupts
asserted than we clear using the result of the original read).
