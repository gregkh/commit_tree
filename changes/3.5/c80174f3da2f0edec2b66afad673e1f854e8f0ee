usb/net: rndis: move and namespace PnP defines

This moves the PnP OID definitions to the RNDIS_* namespace
and puts them in the next falling slot in the list. Oh, the comment
above the PnP defines was referring to some obsolete or out-of-tree
driver so removed it, and removed my own comments telling where each
header segment came from as well, we have moved everything around by
this point anyway.
