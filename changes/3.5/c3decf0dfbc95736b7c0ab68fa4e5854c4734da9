sched: Always initialize cpu-power

Often when we run into mis-shapen topologies the balance iteration
fails to update the cpu power properly and we'll end up in /0 traps.

Always initialize the cpu-power to a semi-sane value so that we can
at least boot the machine, even if the load-balancer might not
function correctly.
