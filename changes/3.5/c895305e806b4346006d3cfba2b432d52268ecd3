video: bfin_adv7393fb: Fix cleanup code

This patch fixes the cleanup code of the bfin_adv7393_fb_probe
function.

1) The resources were not freed in the order that we allocated them
   so we call dma_free_coherent() before it was allocated.
2) The labels weren't in the right place which also meant that we
   freed resources that weren't allocated.
3) We should free gpio_free(P_IDENT(P_PPI0_FS3)) before returning.
4) Lets change the label names into something more meaningful.
