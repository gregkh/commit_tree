netdev/of/phy: New function: of_mdio_find_bus().

Add of_mdio_find_bus() which allows an mii_bus to be located given its
associated the device tree node.

This is needed by the follow-on patch to add a driver for MDIO bus
multiplexers.

The of_mdiobus_register() function is modified so that the device tree
node is recorded in the mii_bus.  Then we can find it again by
iterating over all mdio_bus_class devices.

Because the OF device tree has now become an integral part of the
kernel, this can live in mdio_bus.c (which contains the needed
mdio_bus_class structure) instead of of_mdio.c.
