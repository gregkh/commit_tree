drm/i915: split out dma mapping from global gtt bind/unbind functions

Note that there's a functional change buried in this patch wrt the ilk
dmar workaround: We now only idle the gpu while tearing down the dmar
mappings, not while clearing the gtt. Keeping the current semantics
would have made for some really ugly code and afaik the issue is only
with the dmar unmapping that needs a fully idle gpu.
