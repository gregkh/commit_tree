mtd: block2mtd: fix recursive call of mtd_writev

The 'mtd_writev' interface calls the function assigned
to the '_write' field of a given mtd device if that is
not NULL. The block2mtd driver sets the '_writev' field
to the 'mtd_writev' function itself and thus causes a
endless loop.

This is caused by 1dbebd32562b3c2caeca35960e5cb00bfcc12900
(mtd: harmonize mtd_writev usage).

Remove the assignment from the block2mtd driver to fix the
issue.
