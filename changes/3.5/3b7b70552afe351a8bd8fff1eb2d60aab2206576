ARM: mach-shmobile: sh7372 generic board support via DT V2

Add generic DT board support for the sh7372 SoC V2.

SCIF serial ports and timers are kept as regular
platform devices. Other on-chip and on-board devices
should be configured via the device tree.

Tested on the mackerel board via kexec using a zImage
kernel with an appended dtb.

At this point there is no interrupt controller support
in place but such code will be added over time when
proper IRQ domain support has been added to INTC.
