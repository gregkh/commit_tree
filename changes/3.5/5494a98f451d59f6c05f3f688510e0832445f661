regmap: Fix the size calculation for map->format.buf_size

The word to be transmitted/received via regmap is composed by the following
parts:

config->reg_bits
config->val_bits
config->pad_bits

,so the total size should be calculated by summing up the number of bits of
each element and using a DIV_ROUND_UP to return the number of bytes.
