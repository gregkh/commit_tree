drm/i915: move vbetool invoked ier stuff

This extra bit of interrupt enabling code doesn't belong in the wait
seqno function. If anything we should pull it out to a helper so the
throttle code can also use it. The history is a bit vague, but I am
going to attempt to just dump it, unless someone can argue otherwise.

Removing this allows for a shared lock free wait seqno function. To keep
tabs on this issue though, the IER value is stored on error capture
(recommended by Chris Wilson)

v2: fixed typo EIR->IER (Ben)
Fix some white space (Ben)
Move IER capture to globally instead of per ring (Ben)
