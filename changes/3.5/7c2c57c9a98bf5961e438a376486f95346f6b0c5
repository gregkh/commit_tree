md:Add blk_plug in sync_thread.

Add blk_plug in sync_thread will increase the performance of sync.
Because sync_thread did not blk_plug,so when raid sync, the bio merge
not well.

Testing environment:
SATA controller: Intel Corporation 82801JI (ICH10 Family) SATA AHCI
Controller.
OS:Linux xxx 3.5.0-rc2+ #340 SMP Tue Jun 12 09:00:25 CST 2012
x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux.
RAID5: four ST31000524NS disk.

Without blk_plug:recovery speed about 63M/Sec;
Add blk_plug:recovery speed about 120M/Sec.

Using blktrace:
blktrace -d /dev/sdb -w 60  -o -|blkparse -i -

The ratio of merge will be markedly increased.
