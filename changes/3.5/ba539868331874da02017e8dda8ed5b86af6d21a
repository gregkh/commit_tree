mm: nobootmem: unify allocation policy of (non-)panicking node allocations

While the panicking node-specific allocation function tries to satisfy
node+goal, goal, node, anywhere, the non-panicking function still does
node+goal, goal, anywhere.

Make it simpler: define the panicking version in terms of the non-panicking
one, like the node-agnostic interface, so they always behave the same way
apart from how to deal with allocation failure.
