HID: wacom: Add LED selector control for Wacom Intuos4 WL

Add sysfs attribute to control LED selector on Wacom Intuos4. There are 4
different LEDs on the tablet and they can be turned on by something like:

echo 50 > /sys/class/leds/(device # here)\:selector\:1/brightness

Only one can be lit at a time. The brightness range is 0 to 127. This patch
also contains short ABI description.
