cifs: always update the inode cache with the results from a FIND_*

When we get back a FIND_FIRST/NEXT result, we have some info about the
dentry that we use to instantiate a new inode. We were ignoring and
discarding that info when we had an existing dentry in the cache.

Fix this by updating the inode in place when we find an existing dentry
and the uniqueid is the same.
