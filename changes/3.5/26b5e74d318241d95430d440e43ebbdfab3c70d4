regmap: introduce explicit bus_context for bus callbacks

The only context needed by I2C and SPI bus definitions is the device
itself; this can be converted to an i2c_client or spi_device in order
to perform IO on the device. However, other bus types may need more
context in order to perform IO. Enable this by having regmap_init accept
a bus_context parameter, and pass this to all bus callbacks. The
existing callbacks simply pass the struct device here. Future bus types
may pass something else.
