blkcg: restructure blkio_group configruation setting

As part of userland interface restructuring, this patch updates
per-blkio_group configuration setting.  Instead of funneling
everything through a master function which has hard-coded cases for
each config file it may handle, the common part is factored into
blkg_conf_prep() and blkg_conf_finish() and different configuration
setters are implemented using the helpers.

While this doesn't result in immediate LOC reduction, this enables
further cleanups and more modular implementation.
