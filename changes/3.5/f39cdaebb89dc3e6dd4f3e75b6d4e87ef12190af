fault-inject: avoid call to random32() if fault injection is disabled

After enabling CONFIG_FAILSLAB I noticed random32 in profiles even if slub
fault injection wasn't enabled at runtime.

should_fail forces a comparison against random32() even if probability is
0:

        if (attr->probability <= random32() % 100)
                return false;

Add a check up front for probability == 0 and avoid all of the more
complicated checks.
