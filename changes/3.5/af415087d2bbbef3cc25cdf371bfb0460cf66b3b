KVM: PPC: Book3S: PR: No isync in slbie path

While messing around with the SLBs we're running in real mode. The
entry to guest space goes through rfid, which is context synchronizing,
so there's no need to manually synchronize anything through isync.

With this patch and a simple priviledged SPR access loop guest, I get
a speed bump from 2035607 to 2181301 exits per second.
