shmem: replace_page must flush_dcache and others

Commit bde05d1ccd51 ("shmem: replace page if mapping excludes its zone")
is not at all likely to break for anyone, but it was an earlier version
from before review feedback was incorporated.  Fix that up now.

* shmem_replace_page must flush_dcache_page after copy_highpage [akpm]
* Expand comment on why shmem_unuse_inode needs page_swapcount [akpm]
* Remove excess of VM_BUG_ONs from shmem_replace_page [wangcong]
* Check page_private matches swap before calling shmem_replace_page [hughd]
* shmem_replace_page allow for unexpected race in radix_tree lookup [hughd]
