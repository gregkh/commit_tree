x86, efi: Add EFI boot stub documentation

Since we can't expect every user to read the EFI boot stub code it
seems prudent to have a couple of paragraphs explaining what it is and
how it works.

The "initrd=" option in particular is tricky because it only
understands absolute EFI-style paths (backslashes as directory
separators), and until now this hasn't been documented anywhere. This
has tripped up a couple of users.
