drm/i915: extract copy helpers from shmem_pread|pwrite

While moving around things, this two functions slowly grew out of any
sane bounds. So extract a few lines that do the copying and
clflushing. Also add a few comments to explain what's going on.

v2: Again do s/needs_clflush/needs_clflush_after/ in the write paths
as suggested by Chris Wilson.
