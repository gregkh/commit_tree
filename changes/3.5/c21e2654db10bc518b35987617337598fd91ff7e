TTY: 68328serial, remove unused stuff from m68k_serial

Not everything from struct m68k_serial is really used. So remove
unused or only-set members of that structure. Next step is to move it
to 68328serial.c and remove 68328serial.h completely.

This change also takes status_handle and batten_down_hatches away
since they use break_abort but do nothing.
