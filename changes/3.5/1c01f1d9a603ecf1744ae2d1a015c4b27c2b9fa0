USB: EHCI: fix command register configuration lost problem

The 3d9545cc375d117554a9b35dfddadf9189c62775(EHCI: maintain the
ehci->command value properly) introducs one command register
configuration lost problem by the below line in ehci_reset:

	ehci->command = ehci_readl(ehci, &ehci->regs->command);

After writting RESET into command register, it is restored to
its default value per EHCI spec[1], so the previous configuration
will be lost, and may introduce some problems reported recently:
	- imx51 Babbage board detect usb hub failed[2], reported
	by Richard Zhao.
	- mouse and keyboard hangs in linux-next found by
	Dan Carpenter and Greg-KH.

So this patch just removes the line to fix these problems, and
keep configurating command register consistent as before the commit
3d9545cc(EHCI: maintain the ehci->command value properly).
