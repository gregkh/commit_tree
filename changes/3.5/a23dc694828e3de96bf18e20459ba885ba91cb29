ASoC: imx: merge sound/soc/imx into sound/soc/fsl

Freescale PowerPC and ARM/IMX families share the same SSI IP block.
The patch merges sound/soc/imx into sound/soc/fsl, so that the possible
code sharing and consolidation can happen.

This is a plain merge, except that menuconfig SND_POWERPC_SOC is added
in Kconfig for PowerPC platform as a correspondence to SND_IMX_SOC for
IMX platform.
