kmsg: escape the backslash character while exporting data

Non-printable characters in the log data are hex-escaped to ensure safe
post processing. We need to escape a backslash we find in the data, to be
able to distinguish it from a backslash we add for the escaping.

Also escape the non-printable character 127.

Thanks to Miloslav Trmac for the heads up.
