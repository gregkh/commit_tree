ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Use DMA packet mode for non mono streams on OMAP3+

Take the DMA packet mode into use when the McBSP is configured in element
dma_op_mode if the stream is not mono.
In this way we transfer one sample from/to McBSP FIFO upon DMA request.
This change only affects OMAP3+ versions, where the McBSP ports have FIFO.
