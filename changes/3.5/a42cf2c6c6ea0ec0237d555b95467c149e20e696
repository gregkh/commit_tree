ARM: OMAP3: igep0020: Add support for Micron NAND Flash storage memory

IGEP-based boards can have two different flash memories, a OneNAND or
a NAND device. The boot configuration pins (sys_boot) are used to
specify which memory is available.

Also, this patch removes unnecesary code for registering the OneNAND.
