ARM: OMAP3: cpuidle - use omap3_idle_data directly

We are storing the 'omap3_idle_data' in the private data field
of the cpuidle device. As we are using this variable only in this file,
that does not really make sense. Let's use the global variable directly.

As the table is initialized statically, let's remove the initialization at
startup too.
