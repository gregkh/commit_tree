splice: fix racy pipe->buffers uses

Dave Jones reported a kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:3474! triggered
by splice_shrink_spd() called from vmsplice_to_pipe()

commit 35f3d14dbbc5 (pipe: add support for shrinking and growing pipes)
added capability to adjust pipe->buffers.

Problem is some paths don't hold pipe mutex and assume pipe->buffers
doesn't change for their duration.

Fix this by adding nr_pages_max field in struct splice_pipe_desc, and
use it in place of pipe->buffers where appropriate.

splice_shrink_spd() loses its struct pipe_inode_info argument.
