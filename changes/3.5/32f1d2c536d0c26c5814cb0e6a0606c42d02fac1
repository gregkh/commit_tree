xhci: Don't free endpoints in xhci_mem_cleanup()

This patch fixes a few issues introduced in the recent fix
[f8a9e72d: USB: fix resource leak in xhci power loss path]

- The endpoints listed in bw table are just links and each entry is an
 array member of dev->eps[].  But the commit above adds a kfree() call
 to these instances, and thus it results in memory corruption.

- It clears only the first entry of rh_bw[], but there can be multiple
  ports.

- It'd be safer to clear the list_head of ep as well, not only
  removing from the list, as it's checked in
  xhci_discover_or_reset_device().

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that contain
the commit 839c817ce67178ca3c7c7ad534c571bba1e69ebe "xhci: Store
information about roothubs and TTs."
