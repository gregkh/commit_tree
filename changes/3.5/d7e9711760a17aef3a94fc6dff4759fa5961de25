quota: Fix double lock in add_dquot_ref() with CONFIG_QUOTA_DEBUG

When CONFIG_QUOTA_DEBUG is enabled we call inode_get_rsv_space() from
add_dquot_ref() while holding i_lock. But inode_get_rsv_space() is trying
to get i_lock as well resulting in double lock.

Fix the problem by moving inode_get_rsv_space() call out of i_lock.
