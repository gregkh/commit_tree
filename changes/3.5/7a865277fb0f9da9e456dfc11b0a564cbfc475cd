dt: pinctrl: Document device tree binding

The core pin controller bindings define:
* The fact that pin controllers expose pin configurations as nodes in
  device tree.
* That the bindings for those pin configuration nodes is defined by the
  individual pin controller drivers.
* A standardized set of properties for client devices to define numbered
  or named pin configuration states, each referring to some number of the
  afore-mentioned pin configuration nodes.
* That the bindings for the client devices determines the set of numbered
  or named states that must exist.
