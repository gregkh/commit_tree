NFSv4.1: Handle NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED when confirming the lease

Apparently the patch "NFS: Always use the same SETCLIENTID boot verifier"
is tickling a Linux nfs server bug, and causing a regression: the server
can get into a situation where it keeps replying NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED
to our CREATE_SESSION request even when we are sending the correct
sequence ID.

Fix this by purging the lease and then retrying.
