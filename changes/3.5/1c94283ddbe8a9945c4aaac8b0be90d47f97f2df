IB/qib: Add cache line awareness to qib_qp and qib_devdata structures

This patch reorganizes the QP and devdata files to be more cache line aware.

qib_qp fields in particular are split into read-mostly, send, and receive fields.

qib_devdata fields are split into read-mostly and read/write fields

Testing has show that bidirectional tests improve by as much as 100%
with this patch.
