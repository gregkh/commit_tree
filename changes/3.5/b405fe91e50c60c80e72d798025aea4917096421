md/bitmap: use set_bit, test_bit, etc for operation on bitmap->flags.

We currently use '&' and '|' which isn't the norm in the kernel
and doesn't allow easy atomicity.
So change to bit numbers and {set,clear,test}_bit.
This allows us to remove a spinlock/unlock (which was dubious anyway)
and some other simplifications.
