ARM i.MX imx21ads: Fix overlapping static i/o mappings

The statically defined I/O memory regions for the i.MX21 on chip
peripherals and the on board I/O peripherals of the i.MX21ADS board
overlap. This results in a kernel crash during startup. This is fixed
by reducing the memory range for the on board I/O peripherals to the
actually required range.
