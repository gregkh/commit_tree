staging: comedi: rename addi CamelCase function pointers

Rename the CamelCase variable names for the ADDI subdevice
functions. This makes the code a bit cleaner and easier to
follow.

This will also help with converting the struct addi_board
boardtypes array to C99 style initialization to help with
maintaining the code.
