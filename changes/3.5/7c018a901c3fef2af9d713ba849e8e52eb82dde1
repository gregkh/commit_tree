[SCSI] st: fix memory leak with >1MB tape I/O

There is a memory leak in the st driver when sending large enough reads or
writes using st's direct I/O path.  As part of mapping the application's
memory, a buffer to hold page pointers is allocated and the count of mapped
pages is stored in field do_dio.  A non-zero do_dio marks that direct I/O is
in use.

But do_dio is only 1 byte in size.  Mapping 256 4k pages overflows
do_dio and causes it to be set to 0, like direct I/O option was not
used.  When the I/O completes, the buffer to hold the page pointers is
not freed, and the page counts of the mapped pages are not reduced.
Every I/O of this size then leaks memory.

The size of do_dio needs to be increased to prevent it wrapping around.
