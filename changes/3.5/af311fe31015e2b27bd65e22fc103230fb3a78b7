be2net: Fix traffic stall INTx mode

EQ is getting armed wrongly in INTx mode as INTx interrupt is taking
some time to deassert. This can cause another interrupt while NAPI is
scheduled and scheduling a NAPI in interrupt does not take effect.
This causes interrupt to be missed and traffic stalls. Fixing this by
preventing wrong arming of EQ.
