xilinx_hwicap: reset XHI_MAX_RETRIES

Reset the XHI_MAX_RETRIES value. This allows the hardware enough time to
write configuration frames during partial reconfiguration. In case of 10
the driver returns an error, although it should just have polled the
register longer.

Tested on an ML605 board. The patch is against the latest linus-tree.
