regulator: core: Allow drivers to set simple linear voltage maps as data

A lot of regulator hardware maps selectors on to voltages with a simple
linear mapping function

    selector = base + (selector * step size)

Provide off the shelf list_voltage() and map_voltage() operations which
use new min_uV and uV_step members in the regulator_desc to implement
this function.
