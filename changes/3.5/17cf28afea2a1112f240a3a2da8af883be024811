mm/fs: remove truncate_range

Remove vmtruncate_range(), and remove the truncate_range method from
struct inode_operations: only tmpfs ever supported it, and tmpfs has now
converted over to using the fallocate method of file_operations.

Update Documentation accordingly, adding (setlease and) fallocate lines.
And while we're in mm.h, remove duplicate declarations of shmem_lock() and
shmem_file_setup(): everyone is now using the ones in shmem_fs.h.
