Btrfs: use i_version instead of our own sequence

We've been keeping around the inode sequence number in hopes that somebody
would use it, but nobody uses it and people actually use i_version which
serves the same purpose, so use i_version where we used the incore inode's
sequence number and that way the sequence is updated properly across the
board, and not just in file write.  Thanks,
