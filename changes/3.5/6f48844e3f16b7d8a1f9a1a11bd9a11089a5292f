isci: Manage the link layer hang detect timer for RNC suspensions.

For STP devices under certain protocol conditions, an RNC will not
suspend until the current transfer state is broken with a SYNC/ESC
sequence from the SCU.  The SYNC/ESC driven by expiration of the
SCU link layer hang detect timer, which has too small a dynamic
range to support slow SATA devices, so normally it is disabled.

This change enables the timer with the minimum period at the point
when the suspension is requested.

Note that there is potential collateral damage to other open
connections to slow SATA devices on the same port, since there
is no alternative but to enable the LLHANG timer on every phy in
the port for the current suspension request - there is no way to
tell on which phy the RNC in question is currently active.
