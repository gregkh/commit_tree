usb/net: rndis: remove ambigous status codes

The RNDIS status codes are redefined with much stranged ifdeffery
and only one of these codes was used in the hyperv driver, and
there it is very clearly referring to the RNDIS variant, not some
other status. So clarify this by explictly using the RNDIS_*
prefixed status code in the hyperv drivera and delete the
duplicate defines.
