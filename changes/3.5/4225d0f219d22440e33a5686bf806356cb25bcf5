drm/i915: fixup __iomem mixups in ringbuffer.c

Two things:
- ring->virtual start is an __iomem pointer, treat it accordingly.
- dev_priv->status_page.page_addr is now always a cpu addr, no pointer
  casting needed for that.

Take the opportunity to remove the unnecessary drm indirection when
setting up the ringbuffer iomapping.

v2: Add a compiler barrier before reading the hw status page.
