sched: Fix domain iteration

Weird topologies can lead to asymmetric domain setups. This needs
further consideration since these setups are typically non-minimal
too.

For now, make it work by adding an extra mask selecting which CPUs
are allowed to iterate up.

The topology that triggered it is the one from David Rientjes:

	10 20 20 30
	20 10 20 20
	20 20 10 20
	30 20 20 10

resulting in boxes that wouldn't even boot.
