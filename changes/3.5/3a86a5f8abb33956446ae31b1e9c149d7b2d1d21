pinctrl: pinctrl-imx: free allocated pinctrl_map structure only once and use kernel facilities for IMX_PMX_DUMP

a) as we allocate the pinctrl_map structure at imx_dt_node_to_map at  line 167, anyway
   if its an element, or a num_elements * (sizeof(type)) elements allocated to one single
   pointer must be freed only once.

CASE. A)

as new_map is not moved and allocated like,

for (i = 0; i < MAX_ELEMS; i++) {
    new_map[i] = kmalloc(numelems * size, GFP_KERNEL);
}

its freed as

for (i = 0; i < MAX_ELEMS; i++) {
    kfree(new_map[i]);
}

CASE. B)
and its allocated like
        new_map = kmalloc(numelems * size, GFP_KERNEL);

it just needs kfree not as case A's.

b) use KERN_DEBUG facility for the IMX_PMX_DUMP macro.
