smb347-charger: Clean up battery attributes

CURRENT_NOW and VOLTAGE_NOW should be instantaneous readings
from power supply(ex: battery).

smb347 charger driver reports charge voltage for VOLTAGE_NOW
and charge current for CURRENT_NOW attributes which are not
instantaneous readings.

This patch removes the battery VOLTAGE_NOW and CURRENT_NOW
properties from the driver and also removes hw_to_current()
which is not required anymore.
