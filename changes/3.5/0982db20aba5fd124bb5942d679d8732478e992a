[media] staging: media: go7007: Adlink MPG24 board issues

This issuses applyed only for Adlink MPG24 board with go7007
 & wis2804, all whese changes was tested for continuos
 load&restart mode

This is minimal changes needed for start up go7007&wis2804 to work correctly
  in 3.4 branch

Changes:
  - When go7007 reset device, i2c was not worked (need rewrite GPIO5)
  - As wis2804 has i2c_addr=0x00/*really*/, so Need set I2C_CLIENT_TEN flag for validity
  - some main nonzero initialization, rewrites with kzalloc instead kmalloc
  - STATUS_SHUTDOWN was placed in incorrect place, so if firmware wasn`t loaded, we
    failed v4l2_device_unregister with kernel panic (OOPS)
  - some new v4l2 style features as call_all(...s_stream...) for using subdev calls
  - wis-tw2804.ko module code was incompatible with 3.4 branch in initialization v4l2_subdev parts.
    now i2c_get_clientdata(...) contains v4l2_subdev struct instead non standart wis_tw2804 struct

Adds:
  - Additional chipset tw2804 controls with: gain,auto gain,inputs[0,1],color kill,chroma gain,gain balances,
    for all 4 channels (from tw2804.pdf)
  - Power control for each 4 ADC (tw2804) up when s_stream(...,1), down otherwise
