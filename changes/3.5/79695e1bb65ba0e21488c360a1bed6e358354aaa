perf stat: Initialize default events wrt exclude_{guest,host}

When no event is specified the tools use perf_evlist__add_default(), that will
call event_attr_init to initialize the KVM exclusion bits.

When the change was made to the tools so that by default guest samples would be
excluded, the changes were made just to the parsing routines and to
perf_evlist__add_default(), not to perf_evlist__add_attrs, that is used so far
just by perf stat to add multiple events, according to the level of detail
specified.

Recently the tools were changed to reconstruct the event name from all the
details in perf_event_attr, not just from .type and .config, but taking into
account all the feature bits (.exclude_{guest,host,user,kernel,etc},
.precise_ip, etc).

That is when we noticed that the default for perf stat wasn't the one for the
rest of the tools, i.e. the .exclude_guest bit wasn't being set.

I.e. the default, that doesn't call event_attr_init was showing the :HG
modifier:

  $ perf stat usleep 1

While if one explicitely specifies the same events, which will make the parsing code
to be called and thus event_attr_init is called:

  $ perf stat -e task-clock,context-switches,migrations,page-faults,cycles,stalled-cycles-frontend,stalled-cycles-backend,instructions,branches,branch-misses usleep 1

Fix it by introducing a perf_evlist__add_default_attrs method that will call
evlist_attr_init in all the perf_event_attr entries before adding the events.
