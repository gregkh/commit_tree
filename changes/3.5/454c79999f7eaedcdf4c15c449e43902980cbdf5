sched/rt: Fix SCHED_RR across cgroups

task_tick_rt() has an optimization to only reschedule SCHED_RR tasks
if they were the only element on their rq.  However, with cgroups
a SCHED_RR task could be the only element on its per-cgroup rq but
still be competing with other SCHED_RR tasks in its parent's
cgroup.  In this case, the SCHED_RR task in the child cgroup would
never yield at the end of its timeslice.  If the child cgroup
rt_runtime_us was the same as the parent cgroup rt_runtime_us,
the task in the parent cgroup would starve completely.

Modify task_tick_rt() to check that the task is the only task on its
rq, and that the each of the scheduling entities of its ancestors
is also the only entity on its rq.
