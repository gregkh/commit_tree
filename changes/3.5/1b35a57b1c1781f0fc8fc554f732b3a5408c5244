sparc32: Kill off software 32-bit multiply/divide routines.

For the explicit calls to .udiv/.umul in assembler, I made a
mechanical (read as: safe) transformation.  I didn't attempt
to make any simplifications.

In particular, __ndelay and __udelay can be simplified significantly.
Some of the %y reads are unnecessary and these routines have no need
any longer for allocating a register window, they can be leaf
functions.
