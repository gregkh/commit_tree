drm/i915: hold forcewake around ring hw init

Empirical evidence suggests that we need to: On at least one ivb
machine when running the hangman i-g-t test, the rings don't properly
initialize properly - the RING_START registers seems to be stuck at
all zeros.

Holding forcewake around this register init sequences makes chip reset
reliable again. Note that this is not the first such issue:

    drm/i915: Add wait_for in init_ring_common

added delay loops to make RING_START and RING_CTL initialization
reliable on the blt ring at boot-up. So I guess it won't hurt if we do
this unconditionally for all force_wake needing gpus.

To avoid copy&pasting of the HAS_FORCE_WAKE check I've added a new
intel_info bit for that.

v2: Fixup missing commas in static struct and properly handling the
error case in init_ring_common, both noticed by Jani Nikula.
