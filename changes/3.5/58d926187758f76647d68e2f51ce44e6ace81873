target: Remove obsolete DF_READ_ONLY usage

This was used at one time as a hack by FILEIO backend registration to
allow a struct block_device that was claimed with blkdev_get (by a local
filesystem mount for example) to be exported as read-only (SCSI WP=1).

Since FILEIO backend registration will no longer attempt to obtain
exclusive access to an underlying struct block_device here, this flag is
now obsolete.
