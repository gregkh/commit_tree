PM / Domains: Make it possible to add devices to inactive domains

The generic PM domains core code currently requires domains to be in
the "power on" state for adding devices to them, but this limitation
turns out to be inconvenient in some situations, so remove it.

For this purpose, make __pm_genpd_add_device() set the device's
need_restore flag if the domain is in the "power off" state, so that
the device's "restore state" (usually .runtime_resume()) callback
is executed when it is resumed after the domain has been turned on.
If the domain is in the "power on" state, the device's need_restore
flag will be cleared by __pm_genpd_add_device(), so that its "save
state" (usually .runtime_suspend()) callback is executed when the
domain is about to be turned off.  However, since that default
behavior need not be always desirable, add a helper function
pm_genpd_dev_need_restore() allowing a device's need_restore flag
to be set/unset at any time.
