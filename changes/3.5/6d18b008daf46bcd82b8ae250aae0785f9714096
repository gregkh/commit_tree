blkcg: shoot down blkgs if all policies are deactivated

There's no reason to keep blkgs around if no policy is activated for
the queue.  This patch moves queue locking out of blkg_destroy_all()
and call it from blkg_deactivate_policy() on deactivation of the last
policy on the queue.

This change was suggested by Vivek.
