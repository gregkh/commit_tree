[media] s5p-fimc: Prevent lock-up in multiple sensor systems

The camera clocks managed by the driver were improperly reference counted
and remained disabled when multiple video nodes were opened simultaneously.
It manifested itself with following warning:

Fix this, as well as potential memory leaks due to not calling
v4l2_fh_release() on some error paths.

Also remove some error logs printed for events that aren't critical and
are normal conditions for some system configurations.

Also check if the device have been properly run-time enabled during
video node open.
