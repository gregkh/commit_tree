drm/ttm: Fix buffer object metadata accounting regression v2

A regression was introduced in the 3.3 rc series, commit
"drm/ttm: simplify memory accounting for ttm user v2",
causing the metadata of buffer objects created using the ttm_bo_create()
function to be accounted twice.
That causes massive leaks with the vmwgfx driver running for example
SpecViewperf Catia-03 test 2, eventually killing the app.

Furthermore, the same commit introduces a regression where
metadata accounting is leaked if a buffer object is
initialized with an illegal size. This is also fixed with this commit.

v2: Fixed an error path and removed an unused variable.
