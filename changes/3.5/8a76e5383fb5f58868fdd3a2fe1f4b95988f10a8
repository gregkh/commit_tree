media: mx2_camera: Fix mbus format handling

Do not use MX2_CAMERA_SWAP16 and MX2_CAMERA_PACK_DIR_MSB flags. The driver
must negotiate with the attached sensor whether the mbus format is UYUV or
YUYV and set CSICR1 configuration accordingly.

This is needed for the video function on mach-imx27_visstrim_m10.c to
perform properly, since an earlier version of this patch has been proven
wrong and has been reverted and a commit, depending on it: "[media]
i.MX27: visstrim_m10: Remove use of MX2_CAMERA_SWAP16" is in the mainline.
