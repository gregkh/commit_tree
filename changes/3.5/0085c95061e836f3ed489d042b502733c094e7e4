drm/radeon: use one wait queue for all rings add fence_wait_any v2

Use one wait queue for all rings. When one ring progress, other
likely does to and we are not expecting to have a lot of waiter
anyway.

Also add a fence_wait_any that will wait until the first fence
in the fence array (one fence per ring) is signaled. This allow
to wait on all rings.

v2: some minor cleanups and improvements.
