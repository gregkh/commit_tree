floppy: convert to delayed work and single-thread wq

There are several races in floppy driver between bottom half
(scheduled_work) and timers (fd_timeout, fd_timer). Due to slowness
of the actual floppy devices, those races are never (at least to my
knowledge) triggered on a bare floppy metal. However on virtualized
(emulated) floppy drives, which are of course magnitudes faster
than the real ones, these races trigger reliably. They usually exhibit
themselves as NULL pointer dereferences during DMA setup, such as

	BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000a

but other instances can be easily seen as well. This can be observed at least under
VMWare, VirtualBox and KVM.

This patch converts all the timers and bottom halfs to be processed in a single
workqueue. This aproach has been already discussed back in 2010 if I remember
correctly, and Acked by Linus [1], but it then never made it to the tree.

This all is based on original idea and code of Stephen Hemminger.  I have
ported original Stepen's code to the current state of the floppy driver, and
performed quite some testing (on real hardware), which didn't reveal any issues
(this includes not only writing and reading data, but also formatting
(unfortunately I didn't find any Double-Density disks any more)). Ability to
handle errors properly (supplying known bad floppies) has also been verified.
