x86, realmode: Move not-common bits out of trampoline_common.S

Move the bits that aren't actually common out of trampoline_common.S
and into the arch-specific files.  Furthermore, make sure the page
directory is first in the .bss section for trampoline_64.S in order to
not waste an entire page of memory.
