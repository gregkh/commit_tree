tcp repair: Fix unaligned access when repairing options (v2)

Don't pick __u8/__u16 values directly from raw pointers, but instead use
an array of structures of code:value pairs. This is OK, since the buffer
we take options from is not an skb memory, but a user-to-kernel one.

For those options which don't require any value now, require this to be
zero (for potential future extension of this API).

v2: Changed tcp_repair_opt to use two __u32-s as spotted by David Laight.
