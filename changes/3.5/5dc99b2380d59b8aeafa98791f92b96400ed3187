KVM: Avoid checking huge page mappings in get_dirty_log()

Dropped such mappings when we enabled dirty logging and we will never
create new ones until we stop the logging.

For this we introduce a new function which can be used to write protect
a range of PT level pages: although we do not need to care about a range
of pages at this point, the following patch will need this feature to
optimize the write protection of many pages.
