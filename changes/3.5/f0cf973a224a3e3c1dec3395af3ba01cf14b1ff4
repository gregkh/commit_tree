ftrace: Return record ip addr for ftrace_location()

ftrace_location() is passed an addr, and returns 1 if the addr is
on a ftrace nop (or caller to ftrace_caller), and 0 otherwise.

To let kprobes know if it should move a breakpoint or not, it
must return the actual addr that is the start of the ftrace nop.
This way a kprobe placed on the location of a ftrace nop, can
instead be placed on the instruction after the nop. Even if the
probe addr is on the second or later byte of the nop, it can
simply be moved forward.
