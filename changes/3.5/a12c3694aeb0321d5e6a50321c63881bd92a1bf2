microblaze: no need to reset handler if SA_ONESHOT

get_signal_to_deliver() already resets the signal handler if SA_ONESHOT is
set in ka->sa.sa_flags, there's no need to do it again in handle_signal().
 Furthermore, because we were modifying ka->sa.sa_handler (which is a copy
of sighand->action[]) instead of sighand->action[] the original code
actually had no effect on signal delivery.
