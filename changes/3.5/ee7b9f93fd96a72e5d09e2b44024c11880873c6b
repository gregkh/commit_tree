drm/i915: manage PCH PLLs separately from pipes

PCH PLLs aren't required for outputs on the CPU, so we shouldn't just
treat them as part of the pipe.

So split the code out and manage PCH PLLs separately, allocating them
when needed or trying to re-use existing PCH PLL setups when the timings
match.

v2: add num_pch_pll field to dev_priv (Daniel)
    don't NULL the pch_pll pointer in disable or DPMS will fail (Jesse)
    put register offsets in pll struct (Chris)

v3: Decouple enable/disable of PLLs from get/put.
v4: Track temporary PLL disabling during modeset
v5: Tidy PLL initialisation by only checking for num_pch_pll == 0 (Eugeni)
v6: Avoid mishandling allocation failure by embedding the small array of
    PLLs into the device struct
