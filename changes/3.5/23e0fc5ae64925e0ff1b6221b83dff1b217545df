PM / QoS: Create device constraints objects on notifier registration

The current behavior of dev_pm_qos_add_notifier() makes device PM QoS
notifiers less than useful.  Namely, it silently returns success when
called before any PM QoS constraints are added for the device, so the
caller will assume that the notifier has been registered, but when
someone actually adds some nontrivial constraints for the device
eventually, the previous callers of dev_pm_qos_add_notifier()
will not know about that and their notifier routines will not be
executed (contrary to their expectations).

To address this problem make dev_pm_qos_add_notifier() create the
constraints object for the device if it is not present when the
routine is called.
