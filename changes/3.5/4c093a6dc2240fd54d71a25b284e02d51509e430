staging: comedi: pass 'struct comedi_driver *' to comedi_..._auto_config

The comedi_pci_auto_config() and comedi_usb_auto_config() functions
currently take a board name parameter which is actually a driver name
parameter.  Replace it with a pointer to the struct comedi_driver.  This
will allow comedi_pci_auto_config() and comedi_usb_auto_config() to call
bus-type-specific auto-configuration hooks in the struct comedi_driver
if they exist (they don't yet).  The idea is that these
bus-type-specific auto-configuration hooks won't have to search the bus
for the device being auto-configured like 'attach()' hook has to.
