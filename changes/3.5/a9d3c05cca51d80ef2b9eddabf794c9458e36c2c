mac80211: fix single queue drivers

My queue management rework broke drivers that don't
have multiple AC queues and register a single queue
only, causing a warning:

WARNING: at net/mac80211/iface.c:162 ieee80211_check_queues

This was due to filling the queues wrongly and then
noticing the error when checking later.
