drm/i915: Add wait_for in init_ring_common

I have seen a number of "blt ring initialization failed" messages
where the ctl or start registers are not the correct value. Upon further
inspection, if the code just waited a little bit, it would read the
correct value. Adding the wait_for to these reads should eliminate the
issue.
