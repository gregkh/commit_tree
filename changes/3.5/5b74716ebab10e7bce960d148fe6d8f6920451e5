kvm/powerpc: Add new ioctl to retreive server MMU infos

This is necessary for qemu to be able to pass the right information
to the guest, such as the supported page sizes and corresponding
encodings in the SLB and hash table, which can vary depending
on the processor type, the type of KVM used (PR vs HV) and the
version of KVM
