md/bitmap: add bitmap_resize function to allow bitmap resizing.

This function will allocate the new data structures and copy
bits across from old to new, allowing for the possibility that the
chunksize has changed.

Use the same function for performing the initial allocation
of the structures.  This improves test coverage.

When bitmap_resize is used to resize an existing bitmap, it
only copies '1' bits in, not '0' bits.
So when allocating the bitmap, ensure everything is initialised
to ZERO.
