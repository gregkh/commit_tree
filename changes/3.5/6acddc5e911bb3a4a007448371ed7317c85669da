[SCSI] sg: prevent unwoken sleep

srp->done is protected by sfp->rq_list_lock everywhere, except for this
one case.  Result can be that the wake-up happens before the cacheline
with the changed srp->done has arrived, so the waiter can go back to
sleep and never be woken up again.

The wait_event_interruptible() means that anyone trying to debug this
unlikely race will likely notice everything working fine again, as the
next signal will unwedge things.  Evil.
