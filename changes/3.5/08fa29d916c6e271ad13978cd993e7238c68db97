mm: fix NULL ptr deref when walking hugepages

A missing validation of the value returned by find_vma() could cause a
NULL ptr dereference when walking the pagetable.

This is triggerable from usermode by a simple user by trying to read a
page info out of /proc/pid/pagemap which doesn't exist.

Introduced by commit 025c5b2451e4 ("thp: optimize away unnecessary page
table locking").
