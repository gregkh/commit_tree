xfs: use blocks for counting length of buffers

Now that we pass block counts everywhere, and index buffers by block
number, track the length of the buffer in units of blocks rather
than bytes. Convert the code to use block counts, and those that
need byte counts get converted at the time of use.

Also, remove the XFS_BUF_{SET_}SIZE() macros that are just wrappers
around the buffer length. They only serve to make the code shouty
loud and don't actually add any real value.
