driver-core: extend dev_printk() to pass structured data

Extends dev_printk() to attach a dictionary with a device identifier
and the driver core subsystem name to logged messages, which makes
dev_prink() reliable machine-readable. In addition to the printed
plain text message, it creates these properties:
    SUBSYSTEM=     - the driver-core subsytem name
    DEVICE=
      b12:8        - block dev_t
      c127:3       - char dev_t
      n8           - netdev ifindex
      +sound:card0 - subsystem:devname
