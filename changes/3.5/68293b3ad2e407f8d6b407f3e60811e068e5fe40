ARM: ux500: remove a bunch of internal pull-ups

The default configuration for a number of I2C and keypad pins was
to pull-up. However on most reference designs the electronics
already contain external pull-ups which means the internal
pull-ups will lower the common resistance and increase power
consumption on these lines, and in some reference designs the
keypad inputs are not used so this will just cause problems. So
remove these pull-ups and add them on demand instead if needed.
