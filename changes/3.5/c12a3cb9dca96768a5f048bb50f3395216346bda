ARM: mmp: remove mach/gpio-pxa.h

Commit 157d2644cb0c1e71a18baaffca56d2b1d0ebf10f ("ARM: pxa: change gpio
to platform device") removed all includes of mach/gpio-pxa.h. It kept
this unused header in the tree. Using it can't work, as it itself
includes the non-existent header plat/gpio-pxa.h. This header can safely
be removed.
