skb: Add skb_head_is_locked helper function

This patch adds support for a skb_head_is_locked helper function.  It is
meant to be used any time we are considering transferring the head from
skb->head to a paged frag.  If the head is locked it means we cannot remove
the head from the skb so it must be copied or we must take the skb as a
whole.
