introduce SIZE_MAX

ULONG_MAX is often used to check for integer overflow when calculating
allocation size.  While ULONG_MAX happens to work on most systems, there
is no guarantee that `size_t' must be the same size as `long'.

This patch introduces SIZE_MAX, the maximum value of `size_t', to improve
portability and readability for allocation size validation.
