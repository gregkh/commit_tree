mlx4_en: Moving to Interrupts for TX completions

Moving to interrupts instead of polling fpr TX completions
Avoiding situations where skb can be held in by the driver for
a long time (till timer expires).
The change is also necessary for supporting BQL.

Removing comp_lock that was required because we could handle TX
completions from several contexts: Interrupts, timer, polling.
Now there is only interrupts
