ALSA: snd-usb: move calls to usb_set_interface

The rework of the snd-usb endpoint logic moved the calls to
snd_usb_set_interface() into the snd_usb_endpoint implemenation. This
changed the order in which these calls are issued to the device, and
thereby caused regressions for some webcams.

Fix this by moving the calls back to pcm.c for now to make it work again
and use snd_usb_endpoint_activate() to really tear down all remaining
URBs in the flight, consequently fixing another regression caused by USB
packets on the wire after altsetting 0 has been selected.
