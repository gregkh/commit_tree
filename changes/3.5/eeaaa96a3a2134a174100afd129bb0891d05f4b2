x86/nmi: Fix section mismatch warnings on 32-bit

It was reported that compiling for 32-bit caused a bunch of
section mismatch warnings:

 VDSOSYM arch/x86/vdso/vdso32-syms.lds
  LD      arch/x86/vdso/built-in.o
  LD      arch/x86/built-in.o

 WARNING: arch/x86/built-in.o(.data+0x5af0): Section mismatch in
 reference from the variable test_nmi_ipi_callback_na.10451 to
 the function .init.text:test_nmi_ipi_callback() [...]

 WARNING: arch/x86/built-in.o(.data+0x5b04): Section mismatch in
 reference from the variable nmi_unk_cb_na.10399 to the function
 .init.text:nmi_unk_cb() The variable nmi_unk_cb_na.10399
 references the function __init nmi_unk_cb() [...]

Both of these are attributed to the internal representation of
the nmiaction struct created during register_nmi_handler.  The
reason for this is that those structs are not defined in the
init section whereas the rest of the code in nmi_selftest.c is.

To resolve this, I created a new #define,
register_nmi_handler_initonly, that tags the struct as
__initdata to resolve the mismatch.  This #define should only be
used in rare situations where the register/unregister is called
during init of the kernel.

Big thanks to Jan Beulich for decoding this for me as I didn't
have a clue what was going on.
