x86, efi: Fix issue of overlapping .reloc section for EFI_STUB

Previously the .reloc section was embedded in the .text
section.

No relocations are required during the PE/COFF loading phase
for the kernel using the EFI_STUB UEFI loader. To fix the
issue of overlapping sections, create a .reloc section with a
zero length.

The .reloc section header must exist to make sure the image
will be loaded by the UEFI firmware, but a zero-length
section header seems to be sufficient.
