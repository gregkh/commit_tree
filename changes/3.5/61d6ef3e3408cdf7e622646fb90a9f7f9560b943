Bluetooth: Make better use of l2cap_chan reference counting

L2CAP sockets contain a pointer to l2cap_chan that needs to be
reference counted in order to prevent a possible dangling pointer when
the channel is freed.

There were a few other cases where an l2cap_chan pointer on the stack
was dereferenced after a call to l2cap_chan_del. Those pointers are
also now reference counted.
