atl1c: update PHY reset related routine

Many magic data are re-configured for PHY during its reset operation
based on chip type to get better compability and stability.
REG_PHY_CTRL register may be configured by BIOS before enter OS.
so, the driver can't directly write to it without any Read-Op.
this change also affect suspend and phy_disable routines.
PHY debug ports and extension registers are refined as well.
