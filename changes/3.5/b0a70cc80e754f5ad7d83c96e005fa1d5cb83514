ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: temporarily comment out data for the usb_host_fs and aess IP blocks

The OMAP4 usb_host_fs (OHCI) and AESS IP blocks require some special
programming for them to enter idle.  Without this programming, they
will prevent the rest of the chip from entering full chip idle.

To implement the idle programming cleanly, this will take some
coordination between maintainers.  This is likely to take some time,
so it is probably best to leave this for 3.6 or 3.7.  So, in the
meantime, prevent these IP blocks from being registered.

Later, once the appropriate support is available, this patch can be
reverted.

This second version comments out the IP block data since Benoît didn't
like removing it.
