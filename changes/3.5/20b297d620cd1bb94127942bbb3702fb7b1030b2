Btrfs: tree mod log sanity checks in join_transaction

When a fresh transaction begins, the tree mod log must be clean. Users of
the tree modification log must ensure they never span across transaction
boundaries.

We reset the sequence to 0 in this safe situation to make absolutely sure
overflow can't happen.
