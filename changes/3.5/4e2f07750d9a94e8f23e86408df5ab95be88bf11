mm/memblock: cleanup on duplicate VA/PA conversion

The overall memblock has been organized into the memory regions and
reserved regions.  Initially, the memory regions and reserved regions are
stored in the predetermined arrays of "struct memblock _region".  It's
possible for the arrays to be enlarged when we have newly added regions
for them, but no enough space there.  Under the situation, We will created
double-sized array to meet the requirement.  However, the original
implementation converted the VA (Virtual Address) of the newly allocated
array of regions to PA (Physical Address), then translate back when we
allocates the new array from slab.  That's actually unnecessary.

The patch removes the duplicate VA/PA conversion.
