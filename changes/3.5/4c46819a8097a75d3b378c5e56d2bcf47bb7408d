xfs: do not write the buffer from xfs_iflush

Instead of writing the buffer directly from inside xfs_iflush return it to
the caller and let the caller decide what to do with the buffer.  Also
remove the pincount check in xfs_iflush that all non-blocking callers already
implement and the now unused flags parameter.
