regulator: tps65090: Use generic regmap enable/disable operations

This patch converts tps65090 regulator driver to use generic regmap
enable/disable operations.

Also move struct tps65090 to include/linux/mfd/tps65090.h because
the regulator driver needs to access the rmap field of struct tps65090.
