l2tp: remove unused stats from l2tp_ip socket

The l2tp_ip socket currently maintains packet/byte stats in its
private socket structure. But these counters aren't exposed to
userspace and so serve no purpose. The counters were also
smp-unsafe. So this patch just gets rid of the stats.

While here, change a couple of internal __u32 variables to u32.
