md/bitmap: remove async freeing of bitmap file.

There is no real value in freeing things the moment there is an error.
It is just as good to free the bitmap file and pages when the bitmap
is explicitly removed (and replaced?) or at shutdown.

With this gone, the bitmap will only disappear when the array is
quiescent, so we can remove some locking.

As the 'filemap' doesn't disappear now, include extra checks before
trying to write any of it out.
Also remove the check for "has it disappeared" in
bitmap_daemon_write().
