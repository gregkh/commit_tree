Lockd: pass network namespace to creation and destruction routines

v2: dereference of most probably already released nlm_host removed in
nlmclnt_done() and reclaimer().

These routines are called from locks reclaimer() kernel thread. This thread
works in "init_net" network context and currently relays on persence on lockd
thread and it's per-net resources. Thus lockd_up() and lockd_down() can't relay
on current network context. So let's pass corrent one into them.
