xfs: use shared ilock mode for direct IO writes by default

For the direct IO write path, we only really need the ilock to be taken in
exclusive mode during IO submission if we need to do extent allocation
instead of all the time.

Change the block mapping code to take the ilock in shared mode for the
initial block mapping, and only retake it exclusively when we actually
have to perform extent allocations.  We were already dropping the ilock
for the transaction allocation, so this doesn't introduce new race windows.

Based on an earlier patch from Dave Chinner.
