KVM: Fix device assignment threaded irq handler

The kernel no longer allows us to pass NULL for the hard handler
without also specifying IRQF_ONESHOT.  IRQF_ONESHOT imposes latency
in the exit path that we don't need for MSI interrupts.  Long term
we'd like to inject these interrupts from the hard handler when
possible.  In the short term, we can create dummy hard handlers
that return us to the previous behavior.  Credit to Michael for
original patch.
