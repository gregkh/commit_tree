x86, realmode: Replace open-coded ljmpw with a macro

We cannot code an ljmpw to the real-mode segment directly, because gas
refuses to assemble an ljmp with a symbolic segment.  Instead of
open-coding it everywhere, define a macro and use it for this case.

This is specifically an ljmpw from a 16-bit segment.  This is okay, as
one should never enter real mode from a 32-bit segment: if one do, the
CPU ends up in a bizarre (and useless) mode sometimes called "unreal
mode" where segments behave like real mode but the default address and
operand sizes is 32 bits.
