virtio-net: send gratuitous packets when needed

As hypervior does not have the knowledge of guest network configuration, it's
better to ask guest to send gratuitous packets when needed.

This patch implements VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_ANNOUNCE feature: hypervisor would
notice the guest when it thinks it's time for guest to announce the link
presnece. Guest tests VIRTIO_NET_S_ANNOUNCE bit during config change interrupt
and woule send gratuitous packets through netif_notify_peers() and ack the
notification through ctrl vq.

We need to make sure the atomicy of read and ack in guest otherwise we may ack
more times than being notified. This is done through handling the whole config
change interrupt in an non-reentrant workqueue.
