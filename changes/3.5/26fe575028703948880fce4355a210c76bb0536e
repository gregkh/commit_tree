vfs: make it possible to access the dentry hash/len as one 64-bit entry

This allows comparing hash and len in one operation on 64-bit
architectures.  Right now only __d_lookup_rcu() takes advantage of this,
since that is the case we care most about.

The use of anonymous struct/unions hides the alternate 64-bit approach
from most users, the exception being a few cases where we initialize a
'struct qstr' with a static initializer.  This makes the problematic
cases use a new QSTR_INIT() helper function for that (but initializing
just the name pointer with a "{ .name = xyzzy }" initializer remains
valid, as does just copying another qstr structure).
