Btrfs: look into the extent during find_all_leafs

Before this patch we called find_all_leafs for a data extent, then called
find_all_roots and then looked into the extent to grab the information
we were seeking. This was done without holding the leaves locked to avoid
deadlocks. However, this can obviouly race with concurrent tree
modifications.

Instead, we now look into the extent while we're holding the lock during
find_all_leafs and store this information together with the leaf list.
