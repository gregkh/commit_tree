vfs: split __dentry_open()

Split __dentry_open() into two functions:

  do_dentry_open() - does most of the actual work, doesn't put file on failure
  open_check_o_direct() - after a successful open, checks direct_IO method

This will allow i_op->atomic_open to do just the file initialization and leave
the direct_IO checking to the VFS.
