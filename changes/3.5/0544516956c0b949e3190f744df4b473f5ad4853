s390/Kconfig: add HAVE_MARCH_[ARCH]_FEATURES Kconfig symbols

Add HAVE_MARCH_[ARCH]_FEATURES Kconfig symbols. Whenever there is code that
needs an instruction that is only present beginning with a hardware generation
the #ifdef chain can become quite long.
To avoid this add the new Kconfig symbols which are selected if the kernel
gets compiled for at least the specified symbol.
If for example the kernel gets compiled for z196 this means that also all
symbols for all previous architure features are set.
