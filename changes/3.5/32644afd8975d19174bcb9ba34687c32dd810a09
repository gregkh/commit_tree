md/raid1: fix bug in read_balance introduced by hot-replace

When we added hot_replace we doubled the number of devices
that could be in a RAID1 array.  So we doubled how far read_balance
would search.  Unfortunately we didn't double the point at which
it looped back to the beginning - so it effectively loops over
all non-replacement disks twice.
This doesn't cause bad behaviour, but it pointless and means we
never read from replacement devices.
