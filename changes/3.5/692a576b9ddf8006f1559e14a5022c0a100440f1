drm/i915: don't call shmem_read_mapping unnecessarily

This speeds up pwrite and pread from ~120 µs ro ~100 µs for
reading/writing 1mb on my snb (if the backing storage pages
are already pinned, of course).

v2: Chris Wilson pointed out a glaring page reference bug - I've
unconditionally dropped the reference. With that fixed (and the
associated reduction of dirt in dmesg) it's now even a notch faster.

v3: Unconditionaly grab a page reference when dropping
dev->struct_mutex to simplify the code-flow.
