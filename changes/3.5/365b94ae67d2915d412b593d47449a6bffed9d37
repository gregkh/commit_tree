writeback: Move clearing of I_SYNC into inode_sync_complete()

Move clearing of I_SYNC into inode_sync_complete().  It is more logical to have
clearing of I_SYNC bit and waking of waiters in one place. Also later we will
have two places needing to clear I_SYNC and wake up waiters so this allows them
to use the common helper. Moving of I_SYNC clearing to a later stage of
writeback_single_inode() is safe since we hold i_lock all the time.
