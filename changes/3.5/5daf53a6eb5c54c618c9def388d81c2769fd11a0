[media] snd_tea575x: Make the module using snd_tea575x the fops owner

Before this patch the owner field of the /dev/radio# device fops was set to
the snd-tea575x-tuner module itself. Meaning that the module which was using
it could be rmmod-ed while the device is open, and then BAD things happen.

I know, as I found out the hard way :)

Note that there is no need to also somehow increase the refcount of the
snd-tea575x-tuner module itself, since any drivers using it will have
symbolic references to it.
