KVM: MMU: Make pte_list_desc fit cache lines well

We have PTE_LIST_EXT + 1 pointers in this structure and these 40/20
bytes do not fit cache lines well.  Furthermore, some allocators may
use 64/32-byte objects for the pte_list_desc cache.

This patch solves this problem by changing PTE_LIST_EXT from 4 to 3.

For shadow paging, the new size is still large enough to hold both the
kernel and process mappings for usual anonymous pages.  For file
mappings, there may be a slight change in the cache usage.

Note: with EPT/NPT we almost always have a single spte in each reverse
mapping and we will not see any change by this.
