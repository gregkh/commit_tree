drivers/ide/ide-cs.c: adjust suspicious bit operation

IO_DATA_PATH_WIDTH_8 is 0, so a bit-and with it is always false.  The
value IO_DATA_PATH_WIDTH covers the bits of the IO_DATA_PATH constants, so
first pick those bits and then make the test using !=.

This problem was found using Coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/).
