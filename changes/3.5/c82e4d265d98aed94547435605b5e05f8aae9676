drm/i915: support DDI training in FDI mode

Starting with Haswell, DDI ports can work in FDI mode to support
connectivity with the outputs located on the PCH.

This commit adds support for such connections in the intel_ddi module, and
provides Haswell-specific functionality to make it work.

v2: simplify the commit as per Daniel Vetter suggestion.
