[SCSI] ufs: Fix evaluation of UTP task completion code

While interpreting the result of UTP task completion status,
by using boolean &&, the evaluation would fail when the
UPIU_TASK_MANAGEMENT_FUNC_SUCCEEDED was received.

Either UPIU_TASK_MANAGEMENT_FUNC_COMPL or
UPIU_TASK_MANAGEMENT_FUNC_SUCCEEDED should be
considered as a success result.
