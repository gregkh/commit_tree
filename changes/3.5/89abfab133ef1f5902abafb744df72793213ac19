mm/memcg: move reclaim_stat into lruvec

With mem_cgroup_disabled() now explicit, it becomes clear that the
zone_reclaim_stat structure actually belongs in lruvec, per-zone when
memcg is disabled but per-memcg per-zone when it's enabled.

We can delete mem_cgroup_get_reclaim_stat(), and change
update_page_reclaim_stat() to update just the one set of stats, the one
which get_scan_count() will actually use.
