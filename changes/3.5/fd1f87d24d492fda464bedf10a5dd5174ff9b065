mqueue: don't use kmalloc with KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE

KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is not a good threshold.  It is extremely high and
problematic.  Unfortunately, some silly drivers depend on this and we
can't change it.  But any new code needn't use such extreme ugly high
order allocations.  It brings us awful fragmentation issues and system
slowdown.
