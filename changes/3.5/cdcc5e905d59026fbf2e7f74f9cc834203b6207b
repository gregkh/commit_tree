ipvs: always update some of the flags bits in backup

	As the goal is to mirror the inactconns/activeconns
counters in the backup server, make sure the cp->flags are
updated even if cp is still not bound to dest. If cp->flags
are not updated ip_vs_bind_dest will rely only on the initial
flags when updating the counters. To avoid mistakes and
complicated checks for protocol state rely only on the
IP_VS_CONN_F_INACTIVE bit when updating the counters.
