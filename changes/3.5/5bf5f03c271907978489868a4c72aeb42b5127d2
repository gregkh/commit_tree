mm: fix slab->page flags corruption

Transparent huge pages can change page->flags (PG_compound_lock) without
taking Slab lock.  Since THP can not break slab pages we can safely access
compound page without taking compound lock.

Specifically this patch fixes a race between compound_unlock() and slab
functions which perform page-flags updates.  This can occur when
get_page()/put_page() is called on a page from slab.
