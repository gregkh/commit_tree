spinlock: Indicate that a lockup is only suspected

On an over-committed KVM system we got a:

  "BUG: spinlock lockup on CPU#2, swapper/2/0"

message on the heavily contended virtio blk spinlock.

While we might want to reconsider the locking of virtio-blk
(lock is held while switching to the host) this patch tries to
make the message clearer: the lockup is only suspected.
