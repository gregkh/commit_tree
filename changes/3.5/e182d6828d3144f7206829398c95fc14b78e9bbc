tcm_fc: Remove use of transport_do_task_sg_chain()

With the modern target core, se_cmd->t_data_sg already points to a
sglist that covers the whole command.  So task_sg chaining is needless
overhead and obfuscation -- instead of splicing the split up task
sglists back into one list, we can just use the original list directly.
