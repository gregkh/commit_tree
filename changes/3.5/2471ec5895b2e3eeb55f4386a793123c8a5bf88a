Staging: rts5139: a couple off by one fixes

Inside the array we check ms_start_idx[seg_no + 1] so on the last round
through we end up going past the end of the array.

Also if we don't break out of the loop early then we are beyond the end
of the array there as well.  With this change, if we don't find what we
are looking for, we end on the last element of the array.
