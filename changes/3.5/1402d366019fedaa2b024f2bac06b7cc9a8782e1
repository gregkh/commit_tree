tcp: introduce tcp_try_coalesce

commit c8628155ece3 (tcp: reduce out_of_order memory use) took care of
coalescing tcp segments provided by legacy devices (linear skbs)

We extend this idea to fragged skbs, as their truesize can be heavy.

ixgbe for example uses 256+1024+PAGE_SIZE/2 = 3328 bytes per segment.

Use this coalescing strategy for receive queue too.

This contributes to reduce number of tcp collapses, at minimal cost, and
reduces memory overhead and packets drops.
