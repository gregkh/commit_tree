res_counter: Merge res_counter_charge and res_counter_charge_nofail

These two functions do almost the same thing and duplicate some code.
Merge their implementation into a single common function.
res_counter_charge_locked() takes one more parameter but it doesn't seem
to be used outside res_counter.c yet anyway.

There is no (intended) change in the behaviour.
