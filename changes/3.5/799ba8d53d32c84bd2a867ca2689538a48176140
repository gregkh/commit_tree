NFS4.1: Add lseg to struct nfs4_fl_commit_bucket

Also create a commit_info structure to hold the bucket array and push
it up from the lseg to the layout where it really belongs.

While we are at it, fix a refcounting bug due to an (incorrect)
implicit assumption that filelayout_scan_ds_commit_list always
completely emptied the src list.

This clarifies refcounting, removes the ugly find_only_write_lseg
functions, and pushes the file layout commit code along on the path to
supporting multiple lsegs.
