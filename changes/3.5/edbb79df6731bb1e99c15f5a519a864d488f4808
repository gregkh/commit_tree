md/bitmap: remove bitmap_mask_state

This function isn't really needed.  It sets or clears a flag in both
bitmap->flags and sb->state.
However both times it is called, bitmap_update_sb is called soon
afterwards which copies bitmap->flags to sb->state.
So just make changes to bitmap->flags, and open-code those rather than
hiding in a function.
