blkcg: don't use percpu for merged stats

With recent plug merge updates, merged stats are no longer called for
plug merges and now only updated while holding queue_lock.  As
stats_lock is scheduled to be removed, there's no reason to use percpu
for merged stats.  Don't use percpu for merged stats.
