staging: android-alarm: Switch from wakelocks to wakeup sources

In their current AOSP tree, the Android in-kernel wakelock
infrastructure has been reimplemented in terms of wakeup
sources:
http://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=people/jstultz/android.git;a=commitdiff;h=e9911f4efdc55af703b8b3bb8c839e6f5dd173bb

The Android alarm driver currently has stubbed out calls
to wakelock functionality. So this patch simply converts
the stubbed out wakelock calls to wakeup source calls, and
removes the empty wakelock macros

Greg, would you mind queuing this in staging-next?
