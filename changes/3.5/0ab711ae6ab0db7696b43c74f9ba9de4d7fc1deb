x86/apic: Implement EIO micro-optimization

We know both register and value for eoi beforehand,
so there's no need to check it and no need to do math
to calculate the msr. Saves instructions/branches
on each EOI when using x2apic.

I looked at the objdump output to verify that the
generated code looks right and actually is shorter.

The real improvemements will be on the KVM guest side
though, those come in a later patch.
