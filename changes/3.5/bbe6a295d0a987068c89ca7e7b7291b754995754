tipc: remove redundant memset and stale comment from subscr.c

Eliminate code to zero-out the main topology service structure,
which is already zeroed-out.

Get rid of a comment documenting a field of the main topology
service structure that no longer exists.

Both are cosmetic changes with no impact on runtime behaviour.
