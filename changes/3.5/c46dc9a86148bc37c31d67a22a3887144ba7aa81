KVM: PPC: Emulator: clean up instruction parsing

Instructions on PPC are pretty similarly encoded. So instead of
every instruction emulation code decoding the instruction fields
itself, we can move that code to more generic places and rely on
the compiler to optimize the unused bits away.

This has 2 advantages. It makes the code smaller and it makes the
code less error prone, as the instruction fields are always
available, so accidental misusage is reduced.

Functionally, this patch doesn't change anything.
