ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: add some interconnect-related IP blocks

Add the SL2 interface IP block and interconnect data.  The SL2 is related
to the IVA-HD subsystem.

Add IP block and interconnect data for the C2C ("Chip-to-chip")
interconnect.  This can provide a direct system interconnect link to
other devices stacked on the OMAP package.

Add the ELM IP block and interconnect data.  The ELM can be used
to locate errors in NAND flash connected to the GPMC.
