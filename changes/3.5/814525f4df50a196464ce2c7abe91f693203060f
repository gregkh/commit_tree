ext4: calculate and verify inode checksums

This patch introduces to ext4 the ability to calculate and verify
inode checksums.  This requires the use of a new ro compatibility flag
and some accompanying e2fsprogs patches to provide the relevant
features in tune2fs and e2fsck.  The inode generation changes have
been integrated into this patch.
