xHCI: keep track of ports being resumed and indicate in hub_status_data

This commit adds a bit-array to xhci bus_state for keeping track of
which ports are undergoing a resume transition. If any of the bits
are set when xhci_hub_status_data() is called, the routine will return
a non-zero value even if no ports have any status changes pending.
This will allow usbcore to handle races between root-hub suspend and
port wakeup.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.4, that contain
the commit 879d38e6bc36d73b0ac40ec9b0d839fda9fa8b1a "USB: fix race
between root-hub suspend and remote wakeup".
