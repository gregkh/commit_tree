[media] pwc: poll(): Check that the device has not beem claimed for streaming already

Some apps which use read() start the streaming through a call to poll(),
this means that if another app has already claimed the device for streaming
(through for example a s_fmt, or a reqbufs), that the poll should fail instead
of getting passed through to vb2_poll.

We only check for this when the app is polling for reads, so that ctrl events
still work.
