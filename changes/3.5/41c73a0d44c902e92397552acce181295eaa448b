net: speedup skb_splice_bits()

Commit 35f3d14db (pipe: add support for shrinking and growing pipes)
added a slowdown for splice(socket -> pipe), as we might grow the spd
used in skb_splice_bits() for each skb we process in splice() syscall.

Its not needed since skb lengths are capped. The default on-stack arrays
are more than enough.

Use MAX_SKB_FRAGS instead of PIPE_DEF_BUFFERS to describe the reasonable
limit per skb.

Add coalescing support to help splicing of GRO skbs built from linear
skbs (linked into frag_list)
