c/r: prctl: add ability to get clear_tid_address

Zero is written at clear_tid_address when the process exits.  This
functionality is used by pthread_join().

We already have sys_set_tid_address() to change this address for the
current task but there is no way to obtain it from user space.

Without the ability to find this address and dump it we can't restore
pthread'ed apps which call pthread_join() once they have been restored.

This patch introduces the PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS prctl option which allows
the current process to obtain own clear_tid_address.

This feature is available iif CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE is set.
