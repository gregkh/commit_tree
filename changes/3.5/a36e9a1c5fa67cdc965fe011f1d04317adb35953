GPIO: MIPS: lantiq: convert gpio-mm-lantiq to OF and of_mm_gpio

Implements OF support and convert to of_mm_gpio.

By attaching hardware latches to the External Bus Unit (EBU) on Lantiq SoC, it
is possible to create output only gpios. This driver configures a special
memory address, which when written to, outputs 16 bit to the latches.
