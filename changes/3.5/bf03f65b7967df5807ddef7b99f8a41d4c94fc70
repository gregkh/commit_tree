tegra, serial8250: add ->handle_break() uart_port op

The "KT" serial port has another use case for a "received break" quirk,
so before adding another special case to the 8250 core take this
opportunity to push such quirks out of the core and into a uart_port op.

Stephen says:
"If the callback function is to no longer live in 8250.c itself,
 arch/arm/mach-tegra/devices.c isn't logically a good place to put it,
 and that file will be going away once we get rid of all the board files
 and move solely to device tree."

...so since 8250_pci.c houses all the quirks for pci serial devices this
quirk is similarly housed in of_serial.c.  Once the open firmware
conversion completes the infrastructure details
(include/linux/of_serial.h, and the export) can all be removed to make
this self contained to of_serial.c.
