usb-xhci: Handle COMP_TX_ERR for isoc tds

While testing unplugging an UVC HD webcam with usb-redirection (so through
usbdevfs), my userspace usb-redir code was getting a value of -1 in
iso_frame_desc[n].status, which according to Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt
is not a valid value.

The source of this -1 is the default case in xhci-ring.c:process_isoc_td()
adding a kprintf there showed the value of trb_comp_code to be COMP_TX_ERR
in this case, so this patch adds handling for that completion code to
process_isoc_td().

This was observed and tested with the following xhci controller:
1033:0194 NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller (rev 04)

Note: I also wonder if setting frame->status to -1 (-EPERM) is the best we can
do, but since I cannot come up with anything better I've left that as is.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, which contain the
commit 04e51901dd44f40a5a385ced897f6bca87d5f40a "USB: xHCI: Isochronous
transfer implementation".
