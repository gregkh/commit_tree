isci: Add suspension cases for RNC INVALIDATING, POSTING states.

The RNC can be any of the states in the loop from suspended to
ready when the API "suspend" or "resume" are called.  This change
adds destination states parameters that control the suspension /
resumption action of the RNC statemachine for those transition states.
