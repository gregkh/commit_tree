NFSv4: update_changeattr does not need to set NFS_INO_REVAL_PAGECACHE

We're already invalidating the data cache, and setting the new change
attribute. Since directories don't care about the i_size field, there
is no need to be forcing any extra revalidation of the page cache.

We do keep the NFS_INO_INVALID_ATTR flag, in order to force an
attribute cache revalidation on stat() calls since we do not
update the mtime and ctime fields.
