netem: add limitation to reordered packets

Fix two netem bugs :

1) When a frame was dropped by tfifo_enqueue(), drop counter
   was incremented twice.

2) When reordering is triggered, we enqueue a packet without
   checking queue limit. This can OOM pretty fast when this
   is repeated enough, since skbs are orphaned, no socket limit
   can help in this situation.
