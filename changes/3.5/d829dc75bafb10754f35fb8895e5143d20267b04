charger-manager: Poll battery health in normal state

Charger-Manager needs to check battery health in normal state
as well as suspend-to-RAM state. When the battery is fully charged,
Charger-Manager needs to determine when the chargers restart charging.

This patch allows Charger-Manager to monitor battery health in normal
state and handle operation for chargers after battery is fully charged.
