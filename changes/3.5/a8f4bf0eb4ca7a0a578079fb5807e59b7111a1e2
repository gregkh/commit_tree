Clk:spear6xx:Fix: Rename clk ids within predefined limit

The max limit of con_id is 16 and dev_id is 20. As of now for spear6xx, many clk
ids are exceeding this predefined limit.

This patch is intended to rename clk ids like:
    mux_clk -> _mclk
    gate_clk -> _gclk
    synth_clk -> syn_clk
    ras_gen1_synth_gate_clk -> ras_syn1_gclk
    pll3_48m -> pll3_
