net/hyperv: Add flow control based on hi/low watermark

In the existing code, we only stop queue when the ringbuffer is full,
so the current packet has to be dropped or retried from upper layer.

This patch stops the tx queue when available ringbuffer is below
the low watermark. So the ringbuffer still has small amount of space
available for the current packet. This will reduce the overhead of
retries on sending.
