Extcon (external connector): import Android's switch class and modify.

External connector class (extcon) is based on and an extension of
Android kernel's switch class located at linux/drivers/switch/.

This patch provides the before-extension switch class moved to the
location where the extcon will be located (linux/drivers/extcon/) and
updates to handle class properly.

The before-extension class, switch class of Android kernel, commits
imported are:

switch: switch class and GPIO drivers. (splitted)
Author: Mike Lockwood <lockwood@android.com>

switch: Use device_create instead of device_create_drvdata.
Author: Arve Hjønnevåg <arve@android.com>

In this patch, upon the commits of Android kernel, we have added:
- Relocated and renamed for extcon.
- Comments, module name, and author information are updated
- Code clean for successing patches
- Bugfix: enabling write access without write functions
- Class/device/sysfs create/remove handling
- Added comments about uevents
- Format changes for extcon_dev_register() to have a parent dev.
