mm, thp: allow fallback when pte_alloc_one() fails for huge pmd

The transparent hugepages feature is careful to not invoke the oom
killer when a hugepage cannot be allocated.

pte_alloc_one() failing in __do_huge_pmd_anonymous_page(), however,
currently results in VM_FAULT_OOM which invokes the pagefault oom killer
to kill a memory-hogging task.

This is unnecessary since it's possible to drop the reference to the
hugepage and fallback to allocating a small page.
