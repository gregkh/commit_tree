tmpfs: revert SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE

Revert 4fb5ef089b28 ("tmpfs: support SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE").  I believe
it's correct, and it's been nice to have from rc1 to rc6; but as the
original commit said:

I don't know who actually uses SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE, and whether it
would be of any use to them on tmpfs.  This code adds 92 lines and 752
bytes on x86_64 - is that bloat or worthwhile?

Nobody asked for it, so I conclude that it's bloat: let's revert tmpfs to
the dumb generic support for v3.5.  We can always reinstate it later if
useful, and anyone needing it in a hurry can just get it out of git.
