[SCSI] fcoe, bnx2fc, libfcoe: SW FCoE and bnx2fc use FCoE Syfs

This patch has the SW FCoE driver and the bnx2fc
driver make use of the new fcoe_sysfs API added
earlier in this patch series.

After this patch a fcoe_ctlr_device is allocated with
private data in this order.

+------------------+   +------------------+
| fcoe_ctlr_device |   | fcoe_ctlr_device |
+------------------+   +------------------+
| fcoe_ctlr        |   | fcoe_ctlr        |
+------------------+   +------------------+
| fcoe_interface   |   | bnx2fc_interface |
+------------------+   +------------------+

libfcoe also takes part in this new model since it
discovers and manages fcoe_fcf instances. The memory
allocation is different for FCFs. I didn't want to
impact libfcoe's fcoe_fcf processing, so this patch
creates fcoe_fcf_device instances for each discovered
fcoe_fcf. The two are paired using a (void * priv)
member of the fcoe_ctlr_device. This allows libfcoe
to continue maintaining its list of fcoe_fcf instances
and simply attaches and detaches them from existing
or new fcoe_fcf_device instances.
