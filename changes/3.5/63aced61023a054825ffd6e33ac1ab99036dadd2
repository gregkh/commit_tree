md/raid10: Remove extras after reshape to smaller number of devices.

When a reshape which reduced the number of devices finishes
we must remove the extra devices.

So ensure  that raid10_remove_disk won't try to keep them, and
have raid10_finish_reshape clear the 'in_sync' flag.  Then
remove_and_add_spares will be able to remove them.
