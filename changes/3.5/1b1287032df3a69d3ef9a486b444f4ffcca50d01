gpio/omap: fix missing check in *_runtime_suspend()

We do checking for bank->enabled_non_wakeup_gpios in order
to skip redundant operations. Somehow, the check got missed
while doing the cleanup series.

Just to make sure that we do context restore correctly in
*_runtime_resume(), the bank->workaround_enabled check is
moved after context restore. Otherwise, it would prevent
context restore when bank->enabled_non_wakeup_gpios is 0.
