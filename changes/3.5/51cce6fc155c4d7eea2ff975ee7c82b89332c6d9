usb: gadget: composite: Add usb_remove_config

Add usb_remove_config to unbind a configuration and remove it from
the configs list. This allows implementing composite gadget drivers that
can disconnect themself from the bus and that will later be re-enumerated
with a different configuration.

Gadget drivers must call usb_gadget_disconnect before calling this
function to disable the pullup, disconnect the device from the host,
and prevent the host from enumerating the device while we are changing
the gadget configuration.
