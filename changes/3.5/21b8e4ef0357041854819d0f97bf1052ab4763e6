[SCSI] hpsa: suppress excessively chatty error messages

Default behavior for any CHECK CONDITION excepting a few special cases is to
print out certain parts of the sense buffer and the CDB.  Default behavior
should be to print nothing and let the upper layers or applications decide what
to do about these.  The same information is already available by setting the
appropriate bits of the scsi_logging_level kernel parameter or via
/proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level.
