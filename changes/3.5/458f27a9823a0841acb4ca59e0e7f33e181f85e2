block: Avoid missed wakeup in request waitqueue

After hot-unplug a stressed disk, I found that rl->wait[] is not empty
while rl->count[] is empty and there are theads still sleeping on
get_request after the queue cleanup. With simple debug code, I found
there are exactly nr_sleep - nr_wakeup of theads in D state. So there
are missed wakeup.

  $ dmesg | grep nr_sleep
  [   52.917115] ---> nr_sleep=1046, nr_wakeup=873, delta=173
  $ vmstat 1
  1 173  0 712640  24292  96172 0 0  0  0  419  757  0  0  0 100  0

To quote Tejun:

  Ah, okay, freed_request() wakes up single waiter with the assumption
  that after the wakeup there will at least be one successful allocation
  which in turn will continue the wakeup chain until the wait list is
  empty - ie. waiter wakeup is dependent on successful request
  allocation happening after each wakeup.  With queue marked dead, any
  woken up waiter fails the allocation path, so the wakeup chaining is
  lost and we're left with hung waiters. What we need is wake_up_all()
  after drain completion.

This patch fixes the missed wakeup by waking up all the theads which
are sleeping on wait queue after queue drain.

Changes in v2: Drop waitqueue_active() optimization

Fixed a bug by me, where stacked devices would oops on calling
blk_drain_queue() since ->rq.wait[] do not get initialized unless
it's a full queue setup.
