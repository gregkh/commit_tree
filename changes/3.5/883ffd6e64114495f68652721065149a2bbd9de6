net: stmmac: Fix clock en-/disable calls

clk_{un}prepare is mandatory for platforms using common clock framework.
Since these drivers are used by SPEAr platform, which supports common
clock framework, add clk_{un}prepare() support for them. Otherwise
the clocks are not correctly en-/disabled and ethernet support doesn't
work.
