cgroup: convert all non-memcg controllers to the new cftype interface

Convert debug, freezer, cpuset, cpu_cgroup, cpuacct, net_prio, blkio,
net_cls and device controllers to use the new cftype based interface.
Termination entry is added to cftype arrays and populate callbacks are
replaced with cgroup_subsys->base_cftypes initializations.

This is functionally identical transformation.  There shouldn't be any
visible behavior change.

memcg is rather special and will be converted separately.
