Revert "mm: correctly synchronize rss-counters at exit/exec"

This reverts commit 40af1bbdca47e5c8a2044039bb78ca8fd8b20f94.

It's horribly and utterly broken for at least the following reasons:

 - calling sync_mm_rss() from mmput() is fundamentally wrong, because
   there's absolutely no reason to believe that the task that does the
   mmput() always does it on its own VM.  Example: fork, ptrace, /proc -
   you name it.

 - calling it *after* having done mmdrop() on it is doubly insane, since
   the mm struct may well be gone now.

 - testing mm against NULL before you call it is insane too, since a
NULL mm there would have caused oopses long before.

.. and those are just the three bugs I found before I decided to give up
looking for me and revert it asap.  I should have caught it before I
even took it, but I trusted Andrew too much.
