pinctrl: core device tree mapping table parsing support

During pinctrl_get(), if the client device has a device tree node, look
for the common pinctrl properties there. If found, parse the referenced
device tree nodes, with the help of the pinctrl drivers, and generate
mapping table entries from them.

During pinctrl_put(), free any results of device tree parsing.
