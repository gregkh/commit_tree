ARM: davinci: implement DEBUG_LL port choice

Apart from the necessity to do this change for multi-platform kernels
the previous logic depended on the zImage decompressor to write the
physical and virtual address to a magic memory location.
If the decompressor is unused or not correctly configured for the
current machid, the addruart macro was an infinite loop. Moreover
debugging the early zImage code was not possible either.
