rtl8192de: Recognize 92D E-CUT version.

The chip version constant (0xCC33) was taken from version 0001.0105.2011
of the GPL vendor driver.  Note that this driver version also ships a
firmware update, but I am unsure if it is required for E-CUT chips to
function properly.

A nearby spelling error was also corrected.
