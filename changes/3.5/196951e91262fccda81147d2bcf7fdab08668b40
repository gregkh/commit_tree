hrtimers: Move lock held region in hrtimer_interrupt()

We need to update the base offsets from this code and we need to do
that under base->lock. Move the lock held region around the
ktime_get() calls. The ktime_get() calls are going to be replaced with
a function which gets the time and the offsets atomically.
