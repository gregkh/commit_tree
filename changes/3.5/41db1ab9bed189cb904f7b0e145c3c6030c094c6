GFS2: Add rgrp information to block_alloc trace point

This is a second attempt at a patch that adds rgrp information to the
block allocation trace point for GFS2. As suggested, the patch was
modified to list the rgrp information _after_ the fields that exist today.

Again, the reason for this patch is to allow us to trace and debug
problems with the block reservations patch, which is still in the works.
We can debug problems with reservations if we can see what block allocations
result from the block reservations. It may also be handy in figuring out
if there are problems in rgrp free space accounting. In other words,
we can use it to track the rgrp and its free space along side the allocations
that are taking place.
