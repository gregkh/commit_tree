drm/i915: program WM_LINETIME on Haswell

The line time can be programmed according to the number of horizontal
pixels vs effective pixel rate ratio.

v2: improve comment as per Chris Wilson suggestion

v3: incorporate latest changes in specs.

v4: move into wm update routine, also mention that the same routine can
program IPS watermarks. We do not have their enablement code yet, nor
handle the required clock settings at the moment, so this patch won't
program those values for now.
