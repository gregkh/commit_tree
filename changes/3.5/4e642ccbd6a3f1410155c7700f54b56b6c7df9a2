KVM: PPC: booke: expose good state on irq reinject

When reinjecting an interrupt into the host interrupt handler after we're
back in host kernel land, we need to tell the kernel where the interrupt
happened. We can't tell it that we were in guest state, because that might
lead to random code walking host addresses. So instead, we tell it that
we came from the interrupt reinject code.

This helps getting reasonable numbers out of perf.
