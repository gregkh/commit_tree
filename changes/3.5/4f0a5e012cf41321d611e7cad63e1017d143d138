MD RAID1: Further conditionalize 'fullsync'

A RAID1 device does not necessarily need a fullsync if the bitmap can be used instead.

Similar to commit d6b212f4b19da5301e6b6eca562e5c7a2a6e8c8d in raid5.c, if a raid1
device can be brought back (i.e. from a transient failure) it shouldn't need a
complete resync.  Provided the bitmap is not to old, it will have recorded the areas
of the disk that need recovery.
