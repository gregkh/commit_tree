userns: Disassociate user_struct from the user_namespace.

Modify alloc_uid to take a kuid and make the user hash table global.
Stop holding a reference to the user namespace in struct user_struct.

This simplifies the code and makes the per user accounting not
care about which user namespace a uid happens to appear in.
