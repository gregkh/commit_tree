PM / Sleep: Add user space interface for manipulating wakeup sources, v3

Android allows user space to manipulate wakelocks using two
sysfs file located in /sys/power/, wake_lock and wake_unlock.
Writing a wakelock name and optionally a timeout to the wake_lock
file causes the wakelock whose name was written to be acquired (it
is created before is necessary), optionally with the given timeout.
Writing the name of a wakelock to wake_unlock causes that wakelock
to be released.

Implement an analogous interface for user space using wakeup sources.
Add the /sys/power/wake_lock and /sys/power/wake_unlock files
allowing user space to create, activate and deactivate wakeup
sources, such that writing a name and optionally a timeout to
wake_lock causes the wakeup source of that name to be activated,
optionally with the given timeout.  If that wakeup source doesn't
exist, it will be created and then activated.  Writing a name to
wake_unlock causes the wakeup source of that name, if there is one,
to be deactivated.  Wakeup sources created with the help of
wake_lock that haven't been used for more than 5 minutes are garbage
collected and destroyed.  Moreover, there can be only WL_NUMBER_LIMIT
wakeup sources created with the help of wake_lock present at a time.

The data type used to track wakeup sources created by user space is
called "struct wakelock" to indicate the origins of this feature.

This version of the patch includes an rbtree manipulation fix from John Stultz.
