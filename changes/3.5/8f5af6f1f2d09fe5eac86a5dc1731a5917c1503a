rcu: RCU_FAST_NO_HZ detection of callback adoption

In the present implementations of CPU hotplug, the outgoing CPU is
guaranteed to run its stop-machine process on the way out, which
will guarantee that RCU_FAST_NO_HZ forces the CPU out of dyntick-idle
mode.

However, new versions of CPU hotplug might not work this way.  This
commit therefore removes this design constraint by explicitly notifying
CPUs when they adopt non-lazy RCU callbacks.
