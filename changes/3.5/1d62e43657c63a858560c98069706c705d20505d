cgroup: pass struct mem_cgroup instead of struct cgroup to socket memcg

The only reason cgroup was used, was to be consistent with the populate()
interface. Now that we're getting rid of it, not only we no longer need
it, but we also *can't* call it this way.

Since we will no longer rely on populate(), this will be called from
create(). During create, the association between struct mem_cgroup
and struct cgroup does not yet exist, since cgroup internals hasn't
yet initialized its bookkeeping. This means we would not be able
to draw the memcg pointer from the cgroup pointer in these
functions, which is highly undesirable.
