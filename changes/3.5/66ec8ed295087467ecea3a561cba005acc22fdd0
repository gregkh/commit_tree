usb: gadget: imx_udc: convert to new style start/stop

This patches converts the driver into the new style start/stop interface.
As a result the driver no longer uses the static global controller
variable in start/stop code. I kept the gloval controller variable because
it keeps init simple.
Compile tested only.
