iwlwifi: remove no_sleep_autoadjust

My original idea with this was to adjust the sleep
pattern of the uCode based on the maximum network
latency userspace asked for. Due to nobody wanting
to test it, this logic was disabled by default. It
seems the time has come to remove it, since it's
not only always disabled but there also don't seem
to be any applications that actually request a max
network latency.
