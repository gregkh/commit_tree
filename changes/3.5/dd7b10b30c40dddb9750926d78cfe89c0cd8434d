ASoC: core: Add strobe control

Added support for a control that strobes a bit in
a register to high then back to low (or the inverse).

This is typically useful for hardware that requires
strobing a singe bit to trigger some functionality
and where exposing the bit in a normal single control
would require the user to first manually set then
again unset the bit again for the strobe to trigger.

Added convenience macro.

SOC_SINGLE_STROBE

Added accessor implementations.

snd_soc_get_strobe
snd_soc_put_strobe
