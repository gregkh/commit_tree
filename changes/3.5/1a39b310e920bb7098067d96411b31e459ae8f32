vgaarb: Add support for setting the default video device (v2)

The default VGA device is a somewhat fluid concept on platforms with
multiple GPUs. Add support for setting it so switching code can update
things appropriately, and make sure that the sysfs code returns the right
device if it's changed.

v2: Updated to fix builds when __ARCH_HAS_VGA_DEFAULT_DEVICE is false.
