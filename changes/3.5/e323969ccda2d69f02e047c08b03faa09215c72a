ARM: Remove current_mm per-cpu variable

The current_mm variable was used to store the new mm between the
switch_mm() and switch_to() calls where an IPI to reset the context
could have set the wrong mm. Since the interrupts are disabled during
context switch, there is no need for this variable, current->active_mm
already points to the current mm when interrupts are re-enabled.
