xfs: don't defer metadata allocation to the workqueue

Almost all metadata allocations come from shallow stack usage
situations. Avoid the overhead of switching the allocation to a
workqueue as we are not in danger of running out of stack when
making these allocations. Metadata allocations are already marked
through the args that are passed down, so this is trivial to do.
