drm/i915: account for only one PCH receiver on Haswell

On Haswell, only one pipe can work in FDI mode, so this patch prevents
messing with wrong registers when FDI is being used by non-first pipe. And
to prevent this, we also specify that the VGA can only be used on pipe 0
for now in the crtc_mask value.
