tty: Revert the tty locking series, it needs more work

This reverts the tty layer change to use per-tty locking, because it's
not correct yet, and fixing it will require some more deep surgery.

The main revert is d29f3ef39be4 ("tty_lock: Localise the lock"), but
there are several smaller commits that built upon it, they also get
reverted here. The list of reverted commits is:

  fde86d310886 - tty: add lockdep annotations
  8f6576ad476b - tty: fix ldisc lock inversion trace
  d3ca8b64b97e - pty: Fix lock inversion
  b1d679afd766 - tty: drop the pty lock during hangup
  abcefe5fc357 - tty/amiserial: Add missing argument for tty_unlock()
  fd11b42e3598 - cris: fix missing tty arg in wait_event_interruptible_tty call
  d29f3ef39be4 - tty_lock: Localise the lock

The revert had a trivial conflict in the 68360serial.c staging driver
that got removed in the meantime.
