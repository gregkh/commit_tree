blkcg: skip blkg printing if q isn't associated with disk

blk-cgroup printing code currently assumes that there is a device/disk
associated with every queue in the system, but modules like floppy,
can instantiate request queues without registering disk which can lead
to oops.

Skip the queue/blkg which don't have dev/disk associated with them.

-tj: Factored out backing_dev_info check into blkg_dev_name().
