ACPI, APEI, Avoid too much error reporting in runtime

This patch fixed the following bug.

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43282

This is caused by a firmware bug checking (checking generic address
register provided by firmware) in runtime.  The checking should be
done in address mapping time instead of runtime to avoid too much
error reporting in runtime.
