mm: compaction: export some of the functions

This commit exports some of the functions from compaction.c file
outside of it adding their declaration into internal.h header
file so that other mm related code can use them.

This forced compaction.c to always be compiled (as opposed to being
compiled only if CONFIG_COMPACTION is defined) but as to avoid
introducing code that user did not ask for, part of the compaction.c
is now wrapped in on #ifdef.
