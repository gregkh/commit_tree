drm: make the connector properties code use the object properties code

In the future, we may want to kill the internal functions:
- drm_connector_attach_property
- drm_connector_property_set_value
- drm_connector_property_get_value

It seems the IOCTL drm_mode_connector_property_set_ioctl will have to live, but
we may change libdrm to not use it anymore, if we want.
