perf target: Rename functions to avoid double negation

Rename perf_target__no_{cpu,task} to perf_target__has_{cpu,task} because
it's more intuitive and easy to parse (for human beings) when used with
negation.

The names are came out from David Ahern.  It is intended to be a
mechanical substitution without any functional change.

The perf_target__none remains unchanged since I couldn't find a right
name and it is hardly used with negation.
