x86, realmode: Remove indirect jumps in trampoline_32 and wakeup_asm

Remove indirect jumps in trampoline_32.S and the 32-bit part of
wakeup_asm.S.  There exist systems which are known to do weird
things if an SMI comes in right after a mode switch, and the
safest way to deal with it is to always follow with a simple
absolute far jump.  In the 64-bit code we then to a register
indirect near jump; follow that pattern for the 32-bit code.
