memory: emif: add interrupt and temperature handling

Add an ISR for EMIF that:
	1. reports details of access errors
	2. takes action on thermal events

Also clear all interrupts on shut-down. Pending IRQs
may casue problems during warm-reset.

Temperature handling:
EMIF can be configured to poll the temperature level
of an LPDDR2 device from the MR4 mode register in the
device. EMIF generates an interrupt whenever it identifies
a temperature level change between two consecutive pollings.

Some of the timing parameters need to be de-rated at high
temperatures. The interrupt handler takes care of doing
this and also takes care of going back to nominal settings
when temperature falls back to nominal levels.
