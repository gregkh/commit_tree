af_unix: reduce high order page allocations

unix_dgram_sendmsg() currently builds linear skbs, and this can stress
page allocator with high order page allocations. When memory gets
fragmented, this can eventually fail.

We can try to use order-2 allocations for skb head (SKB_MAX_ALLOC) plus
up to 16 page fragments to lower pressure on buddy allocator.

This patch has no effect on messages of less than 16064 bytes.
(on 64bit arches with PAGE_SIZE=4096)

For bigger messages (from 16065 to 81600 bytes), this patch brings
reliability at the expense of performance penalty because of extra pages
allocations.
