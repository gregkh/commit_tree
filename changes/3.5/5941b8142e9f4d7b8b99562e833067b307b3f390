ARM: OMAP4: TWL6030: ensure sys_nirq1 is mux'd and wakeup enabled

The SYS_NIRQ1 pin is the interupt line for the PMIC part of the TWL6030
and interrupts from the PMIC are needed as wakeup sources.

Ensure this pin is mux'd as input and has wakeup enabled so PMIC
interupts (e.g. RTC) can be used as wakeup sources.

Tested on OMAP4430/Panda.
