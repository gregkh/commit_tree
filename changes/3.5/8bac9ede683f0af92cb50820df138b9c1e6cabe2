net/mlx4_core: Fix init_port mask state for slaves

In function mlx4_INIT_PORT_wrapper, the port state mask for the
slave is only set if we are invoking the INIT_PORT fw command.

However, the reference count for the (initialized) port is
incremented anyway.

This creates a problem in that when we have multiple slaves,
then the CLOSE_PORT command will never be invoked. The
reason is that in the CLOSE_PORT wrapper, if the port-state
mask is zero for the slave (which it is), the wrapper returns
without doing anything. The only slave which will not return
immediately in the CLOSE_PORT wrapper is that slave for which
INIT_PORT was invoked.

The fix is to not have the port-state mask setting depend
on the logic for calling the INIT_PORT fw command.
