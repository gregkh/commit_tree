bridge: Add multicast_querier toggle and disable queries by default

Sending general queries was implemented as an optimisation to speed
up convergence on start-up.  In order to prevent interference with
multicast routers a zero source address has to be used.

Unfortunately these packets appear to cause some multicast-aware
switches to misbehave, e.g., by disrupting multicast packets to us.

Since the multicast snooping feature still functions without sending
our own queries, this patch will change the default to not send
queries.

For those that need queries in order to speed up convergence on start-up,
a toggle is provided to restore the previous behaviour.
