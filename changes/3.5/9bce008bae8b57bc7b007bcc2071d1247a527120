NFS: Fix a commit bug

The new commit code fails to copy the verifier into the wb_verf field
of _all_ the nfs_page structures; it only copies it into the first entry.
The consequence is that most requests end up failing to match in
nfs_commit_release.

Fix is to copy the verifier into the req->wb_verf field in
nfs_write_completion.
