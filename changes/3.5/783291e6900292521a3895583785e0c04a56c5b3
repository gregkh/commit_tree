userns: Simplify the user_namespace by making userns->creator a kuid.

- Transform userns->creator from a user_struct reference to a simple
  kuid_t, kgid_t pair.

  In cap_capable this allows the check to see if we are the creator of
  a namespace to become the classic suser style euid permission check.

  This allows us to remove the need for a struct cred in the mapping
  functions and still be able to dispaly the user namespace creators
  uid and gid as 0.

- Remove the now unnecessary delayed_work in free_user_ns.

  All that is left for free_user_ns to do is to call kmem_cache_free
  and put_user_ns.  Those functions can be called in any context
  so call them directly from free_user_ns removing the need for delayed work.
