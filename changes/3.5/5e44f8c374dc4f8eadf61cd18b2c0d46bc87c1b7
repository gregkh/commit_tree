ext4: hole-punch use truncate_pagecache_range

When truncating a file, we unmap pages from userspace first, as that's
usually more efficient than relying, page by page, on the fallback in
truncate_inode_page() - particularly if the file is mapped many times.

Do the same when punching a hole: 3.4 added truncate_pagecache_range()
to do the unmap and trunc, so use it in ext4_ext_punch_hole(), instead
of calling truncate_inode_pages_range() directly.
