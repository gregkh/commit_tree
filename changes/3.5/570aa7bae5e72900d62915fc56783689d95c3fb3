ASoC: da7210: Add support for PLL and SRM

Current DA7210 driver does support PLL mode fully. It uses fixed
value of input master clock and PLL mode is enabled and disabled based
on the sampling frequency being used for playback or recording. It also
doesn't support Sample Rate Measurement feature of DA7210 hardware.

This patch adds full support for PLL and SRM. Basically following three
modes of operation are possible for DA7210 hardware,

(1) I2S SLAVE mode with PLL bypassed
(2) I2S SLAVE mode with PLL enabled
(3) I2S Master mode with PLL enabled

This patch adds support for all three modes. Also, in case of SLAVE mode
with PLL, it supports SRM (Sample Rate Measurement) feature of the chip.

Actually this patch was submitted earlier and received some review
comments, but after that the driver got update by other patches. Because
of that, I am considering this as new patch and not versioning it based
of previous patches. This version tries to take care of all review
comments received for earlier submissions.
