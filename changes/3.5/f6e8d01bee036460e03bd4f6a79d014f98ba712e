block: add io_context->active_ref

Currently ioc->nr_tasks is used to decide two things - whether an ioc
is done issuing IOs and whether it's shared by multiple tasks.  This
patch separate out the first into ioc->active_ref, which is acquired
and released using {get|put}_io_context_active() respectively.

This will be used to associate bio's with a given task.  This patch
doesn't introduce any visible behavior change.
