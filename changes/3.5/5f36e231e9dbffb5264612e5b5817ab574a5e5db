usb: chipidea: add support for roles

Add some generic code for roles and implement simple role switching
based on ID pin state and/or a sysfs file. At this, we also rename
the device to ci_hdrc, which is what it is.

The "manual" switch is made into a sysfs file and not debugfs, because
it might be useful even in non-debug context. For some boards, like
sheevaplug, it seems to be the only way to switch roles without modifying
the hardware, since the ID pin is always grounded.
