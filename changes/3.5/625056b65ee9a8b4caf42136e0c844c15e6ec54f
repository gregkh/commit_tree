hung task debugging: Inject NMI when hung and going to panic

Send an NMI to all CPUs when a hung task is detected and the hung
task code is configured to panic. This gives us a fairly uptodate
snapshot of all CPUs in the system.

This lets us get stack trace of all CPUs which makes life easier
trying to debug a deadlock, and the NMI doesn't change anything
since the next step is a kernel panic.
