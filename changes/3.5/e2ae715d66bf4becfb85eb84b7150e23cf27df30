kmsg - kmsg_dump() use iterator to receive log buffer content

Provide an iterator to receive the log buffer content, and convert all
kmsg_dump() users to it.

The structured data in the kmsg buffer now contains binary data, which
should no longer be copied verbatim to the kmsg_dump() users.

The iterator should provide reliable access to the buffer data, and also
supports proper log line-aware chunking of data while iterating.
