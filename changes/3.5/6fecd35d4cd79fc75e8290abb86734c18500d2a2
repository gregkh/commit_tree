net: qmi_wwan: add ZTE MF60

Adding a device with limited QMI support. It does not support
normal QMI_WDS commands for connection management. Instead,
sending a QMI_CTL SET_INSTANCE_ID command is required to
enable the network interface:

  01 0f 00 00 00 00 00 00  20 00 04 00 01 01 00 00

A number of QMI_DMS and QMI_NAS commands are also supported
for optional device management.
