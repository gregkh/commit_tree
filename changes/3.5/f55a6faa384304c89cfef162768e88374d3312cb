hrtimer: Provide clock_was_set_delayed()

clock_was_set() cannot be called from hard interrupt context because
it calls on_each_cpu().

For fixing the widely reported leap seconds issue it is necessary to
call it from hard interrupt context, i.e. the timer tick code, which
does the timekeeping updates.

Provide a new function which denotes it in the hrtimer cpu base
structure of the cpu on which it is called and raise the hrtimer
softirq. We then execute the clock_was_set() notificiation from
softirq context in run_hrtimer_softirq(). The hrtimer softirq is
rarely used, so polling the flag there is not a performance issue.

[ tglx: Made it depend on CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS. We really should get
  rid of all this ifdeffery ASAP ]
