cipso: handle CIPSO options correctly when NetLabel is disabled

When NetLabel is not enabled, e.g. CONFIG_NETLABEL=n, and the system
receives a CIPSO tagged packet it is dropped (cipso_v4_validate()
returns non-zero).  In most cases this is the correct and desired
behavior, however, in the case where we are simply forwarding the
traffic, e.g. acting as a network bridge, this becomes a problem.

This patch fixes the forwarding problem by providing the basic CIPSO
validation code directly in ip_options_compile() without the need for
the NetLabel or CIPSO code.  The new validation code can not perform
any of the CIPSO option label/value verification that
cipso_v4_validate() does, but it can verify the basic CIPSO option
format.

The behavior when NetLabel is enabled is unchanged.
