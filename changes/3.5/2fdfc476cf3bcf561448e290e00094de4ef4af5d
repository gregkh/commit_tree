iwlwifi: move ucode error log reporting to op_mode

Error log reporting does not belong to the
transport layer, but to the op_mode loading
the ucode, as it is the entity which knows
about the ucode loaded, and what the error
information means.

Move device logging pointers from the
transport layer to op_mode.

With this change, transport layer only
reports an error to the op_mode, which will
figure out what to do with the error. This
causes the driver to now dump out error logs
when the command queue is stuck as well.

Also, move the debugfs entry for event logs
out of the transport layer and into op_mode.
