drm/i915/intel_i2c: refactor using intel_gmbus_get_adapter

Instead of letting other modules directly access the ->gmbus array,
introduce intel_gmbus_get_adapter() for looking up an i2c_adapter
for a given gmbus port identifier.  This will enable later refactoring
of the gmbus port list.

Note: Before requesting an adapter for a given gmbus port number, the
driver must first check its validity using i2c_intel_gmbus_is_port_valid().
If this check fails, a call to intel_gmbus_get_adapter() will WARN_ON and
return NULL.  This is relevant for parts of the driver that read a port
from VBIOS, which might be improperly initialized and contain an invalid
port.  In these cases, the driver must fall back to using a safer default
port.
