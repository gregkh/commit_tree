md/raid5: In ops_run_io, inc nr_pending before calling md_wait_for_blocked_rdev

In ops_run_io(), the call to md_wait_for_blocked_rdev will decrement
nr_pending so we lose the reference we hold on the rdev.
So atomic_inc it first to maintain the reference.

This bug was introduced by commit  73e92e51b7969ef5477d
    md/raid5.  Don't write to known bad block on doubtful devices.

which appeared in 3.0, so patch is suitable for stable kernels since
then.
