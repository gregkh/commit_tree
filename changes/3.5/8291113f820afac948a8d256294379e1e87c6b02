ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: remove bandgap hwmod

Commit 407a6888f7362cb3dabe69ea6d9dcf3c750dc56a ("OMAP4: hwmod data:
Add AESS, McPDM, bandgap, counter_32k, MMC, KBD, ISS & IPU") adds a
hwmod for the bandgap die temperature sensor IP block.  This IP block
has no interconnect port or firewall region, nor does it have an
independent register space or OCP control registers.  Its registers
are embedded in the System Control Module (SCM) IP block.  So it
appears that the bandgap device should be created by the SCM driver.
