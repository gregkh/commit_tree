Btrfs: always put insert_ptr modifications into the tree mod log

Several callers of insert_ptr set the tree_mod_log parameter to 0 to avoid
addition to the tree mod log. In fact, we need all of those operations. This
commit simply removes the additional parameter and makes addition to the
tree mod log unconditional.
