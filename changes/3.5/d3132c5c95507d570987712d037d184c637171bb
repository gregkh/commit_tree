Input: sentelic - report device's production serial number

Hardware since Cx supports an unique identity (used to identify OEM vendors
and released lot number) which is very helpful for diagnostic purpose.
This revision tries to make it as a part of driver boot up message.

Whilst here, also bumping fsp_drv_ver to acknowledge recent addition of
absolute coordinates output.
