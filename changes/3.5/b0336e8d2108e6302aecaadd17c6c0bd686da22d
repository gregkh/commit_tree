ext4: calculate and verify checksums of directory leaf blocks

Calculate and verify the checksums for directory leaf blocks
(i.e. blocks that only contain actual directory entries).  The
checksum lives in what looks to be an unused directory entry with a 0
name_len at the end of the block.  This scheme is not used for
internal htree nodes because the mechanism in place there only costs
one dx_entry, whereas the "empty" directory entry would cost two
dx_entries.
