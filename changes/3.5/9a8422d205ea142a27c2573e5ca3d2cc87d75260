max17042_battery: Add support for max17047/50 chip

max17047 is improved version of max17042 chip. It has few HW bug
fixes with minor changes in register set.

max17050 is same as max17047 chip except its silicon packging. So from
driver's point of view there is no difference btw max1047 and max1050.

This patch adds the support to dynamically detect the chip type and
adds steps to initialize the max17047 chip.
