fuse: fix stat call on 32 bit platforms

Now we store attr->ino at inode->i_ino, return attr->ino at the
first time and then return inode->i_ino if the attribute timeout
isn't expired. That's wrong on 32 bit platforms because attr->ino
is 64 bit and inode->i_ino is 32 bit in this case.

Fix this by saving 64 bit ino in fuse_inode structure and returning
it every time we call getattr. Also squash attr->ino into inode->i_ino
explicitly.
