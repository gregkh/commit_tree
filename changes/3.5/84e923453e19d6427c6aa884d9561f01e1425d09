md/bitmap: remove single-bit manipulation on sb->state

Just do single-bit manipulations on bitmap->flags and copy whole
value between that and sb->state.

This will allow next patch which changes how bit manipulations are
performed on bitmap->flags.

This does result in BITMAP_STALE not being set in sb by
bitmap_read_sb, however as the setting is determined by other
information in the 'sb' we do not lose information this way.
Normally, bitmap_load will be called shortly which will clear
BITMAP_STALE anyway.
