x86: Fix boot on Twinhead H12Y

Despite lots of investigation into why this is needed we don't
know or have an elegant cure. The only answer found on this
laptop is to mark a problem region as used so that Linux doesn't
put anything there.

Currently all the users add reserve= command lines and anyone
not knowing this needs to find the magic page that documents it.
Automate it instead.
