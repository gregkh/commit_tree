USB: fix resource leak in xhci power loss path

Some more data structures must be freed and counters
reset if an XHCI controller has lost power. The failure
to do so renders some chips inoperative after a certain number
of S4 cycles.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2,
that contain the commits c29eea621900f18287d50519f72cb9113746d75a
"xhci: Implement HS/FS/LS bandwidth checking." and
commit 839c817ce67178ca3c7c7ad534c571bba1e69ebe
"xhci: Implement HS/FS/LS bandwidth checking."
