HID: Allow bus wildcard matching

Most HID drivers do not need to know what bus driver is in use.
A generic group driver can drive any hid device, and the device
list should not need to be duplicated for each new bus.

This patch adds wildcard matching to the HID bus, simplifying device
list handling for group drivers.
