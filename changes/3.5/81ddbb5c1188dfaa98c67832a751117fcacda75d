mac80211: don't always advertise remain-on-channel

Not all devices are really capable of implementing
remain-on-channel, even if it is implemented in SW,
as they can't necessarily deal with channel changes
while associated.

Remove the WIPHY_FLAG_HAS_REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL and add
it only if either the driver has remain_on_channel
implemented in the driver/device.

Also add it to all drivers that advertise P2P right
now since those definitely have to have it working.
