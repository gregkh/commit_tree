rpmsg: fix dependency on initialization order

When rpmsg drivers are built into the kernel, they must not initialize
before the rpmsg bus does, otherwise they'd trigger a BUG() in
drivers/base/driver.c line 169 (driver_register()).

To fix that, and to stop depending on arbitrary linkage ordering of
those built-in rpmsg drivers, we make the rpmsg bus initialize at
subsys_initcall.
