extcon: Add EXTCON_MECHANICAL cable type for physical presence

Some accessory detection mechanisms are able to detect that something is
physically present in the socket separately to identifying what is present
in the socket. This information can be useful to applications, for example
allowing them to indicate that a potentially broken accessory is present,
so provide a standard way to report it to userspace.
