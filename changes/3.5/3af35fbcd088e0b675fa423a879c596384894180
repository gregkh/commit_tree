ARM: OMAP2xxx: hwmod data: start to fix the IVA1, IVA2 and DSP

N800 logs this message on boot:

[    0.182281] omap_hwmod: iva: cannot be enabled for reset (3)

Fix by creating basic IVA1 and DSP hwmods for OMAP2420, and a basic IVA2
hwmod for OMAP2430.  There is still more information to be added, but
this should resolve the immediate issue.
