sparc: Add full proper error handling to strncpy_from_user().

Linus removed the end-of-address-space hackery from
fs/namei.c:do_getname() so we really have to validate these edge
conditions and cannot cheat any more (as x86 used to as well).

Move to a common C implementation like x86 did.  And if both
src and dst are sufficiently aligned we'll do word at a time
copies and checks as well.
