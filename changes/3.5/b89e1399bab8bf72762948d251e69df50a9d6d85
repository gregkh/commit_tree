video: exynos mipi dsi: Avoid races in probe()

Make sure all resources are initialized before interrupt handler is
registered. Pass full platform device name to request_irq() so it
can be distinguished which device has requested an interrupt in cases
there are multiple instances in the system.

Also enable voltage regulators regardless of they have been enabled
by bootloader or not, to make sure other drivers using same regulators
don't disable them unexpectedly.
