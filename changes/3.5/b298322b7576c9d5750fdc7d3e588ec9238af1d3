ARM: pxa: use ioremap to access CPLD

The pcm990 baseboard for the pcm027 module used to setup a static
mapping for accessing the CPLD. It became illegal to call iotable_init
that late. The pcm027 support is broken since then. This patch
switches the cpld support to ioremap and removes all references to
previous static mappings.
