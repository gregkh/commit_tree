[media] s5p-fimc: Don't use platform data for CSI data alignment configuration

The MIPI-CSI2 data alignment parameter can be derived from media bus
pixel code, so it can be now dropped from the platform data structure.
This is a prerequisite for adding the device tree support. Once this
patch is merged the corresponding fields will be removed from the
drivers' public headers and corresponding board files.
