drm/i915: Ironlake shares the same video sprite controls as Sandybridge

Well, almost. Just a couple of differences, Ironlake lacks a few of the
RGB formats, only exposing x8r8g8b8, and lacks a couple of unused
features. Given the similarities, we can then reuse the same routines as
already written for Sandybridge to enable overlay support for Ironlake as
well.
