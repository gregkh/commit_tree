net sysctl: Register an empty /proc/sys/net

Implementation limitations of the sysctl core won't let /proc/sys/net
reside in a network namespace.  /proc/sys/net at least must be registered
as a normal sysctl.  So register /proc/sys/net early as an empty directory
to guarantee we don't violate this constraint and hit bugs in the sysctl
implementation.
