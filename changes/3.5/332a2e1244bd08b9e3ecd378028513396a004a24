vfs: make O_PATH file descriptors usable for 'fchdir()'

We already use them for openat() and friends, but fchdir() also wants to
be able to use O_PATH file descriptors.  This should make it comparable
to the O_SEARCH of Solaris.  In particular, O_PATH allows you to access
(not-quite-open) a directory you don't have read persmission to, only
execute permission.

Noticed during development of multithread support for ksh93.
