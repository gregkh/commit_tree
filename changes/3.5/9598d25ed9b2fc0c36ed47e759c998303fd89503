GFS2: Change variable blk to biblk

In the resource group code, we have no less than three different
kinds of block references: block relative to the file system (u64),
block relative to the rgrp (u32), and block relative to the bitmap.
This is a small step to making the code more readable; it renames
variable blk to biblk to solidify in my mind that it's relative to
the bitmap and nothing else.
