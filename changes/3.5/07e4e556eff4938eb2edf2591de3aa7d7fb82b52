USB: ohci-at91: add a reset function to fix race condition

A possible race condition appears because we are not initializing
the ohci->regs before calling usb_hcd_request_irqs().
We move the call to ohci_init() in hcd->driver->reset() instead of
hcd->driver->start() to fix this.
This was experienced when we share the same IRQ line between OHCI and EHCI
controllers.
