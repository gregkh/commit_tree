vfs: move inode stat information closer together

The comment above it says "Stat data, not accessed from path walking",
but in fact some of inode fields we use for the common stat data was way
down at the end of the inode, causing unnecessary cache misses for the
common stat operations.

The inode structure is pretty big, and this can change padding depending
on field width, but at least on the common 64-bit configurations this
doesn't change the size.  Some of our inode layout has historically been
to tro to avoid unnecessary padding fields, but cache locality is at
least as important for layout, if not more.

Noticed by looking at kernel profiles, and noticing that the "i_blkbits"
access stood out like a sore thumb.
