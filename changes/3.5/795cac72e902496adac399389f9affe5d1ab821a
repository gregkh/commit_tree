xfs: kill xfs_buf_btoc

xfs_buf_btoc and friends are simple macros that do basic block
to page index conversion and vice versa. These aren't widely used,
and we use open coded masking and shifting everywhere else. Hence
remove the macros and open code the work they do.

Also, use of PAGE_CACHE_{SIZE|SHIFT|MASK} for these macros is now
incorrect - we are using pages directly and not the page cache, so
use PAGE_{SIZE|MASK|SHIFT} instead.
