HID: Aureal Remote Control Device Driver

Devices like Aureal Cy se W-01RN USB_V3.1 and some derived hardware
have a bogus HID Report Descriptor. According to that report descriptor,
the maximum logical value for key events is 1 and not 101 (101 keys).

This quirk fixes this wrong Report Descriptor.
