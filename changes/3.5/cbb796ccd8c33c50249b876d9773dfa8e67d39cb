dmaengine: Use sg_dma_address instead of sg_phys

dmaengine drivers should always use sg_dma_address instead of sg_phys to get the
addresses for the transfer from a sg element.

To quote Russel King:
	sg_phys(sg) of course has nothing to do with DMA addresses. It's the
	physical address _to the CPU_ of the memory associated with the scatterlist
	entry. That may, or may not have the same value for the DMA engine,
	particularly if IOMMUs are involved.

	And if these drivers are used on ARM, they must be fixed, sooner rather
	than later.  There's patches in the works which will mean we will end up
	with IOMMU support in the DMA mapping later, which means everything I've
	said above will become reality.

The patch has been generated using the following coccinelle patch:
<smpl>
@@
struct scatterlist *sg;
@@
-sg_phys(sg)
+sg_dma_address(sg)
</smpl>
