cxgb4: DB Drop Recovery for RDMA and LLD queues

recover LLD EQs for DB drop interrupts.  This includes adding a new
db_lock, a spin lock disabling BH too, used by the recovery thread and
the ring_tx_db() paths to allow db drop recovery.

Clean up initial DB avoidance code.

Add read_eq_indices() - this allows the LLD to use the PCIe mw to
efficiently read hw eq contexts.

Add cxgb4_sync_txq_pidx() - called by iw_cxgb4 to sync up the sw/hw
pidx value.

Add flush_eq_cache() and cxgb4_flush_eq_cache().  This allows iw_cxgb4
to flush the sge eq context cache before beginning db drop recovery.

Add module parameter, dbfoifo_int_thresh, to allow tuning the db
interrupt threshold value.

Add dbfifo_int_thresh to cxgb4_lld_info so iw_cxgb4 knows the threshold.

Add module parameter, dbfoifo_drain_delay, to allow tuning the amount
of time delay between DB FULL and EMPTY upcalls to iw_cxgb4.
