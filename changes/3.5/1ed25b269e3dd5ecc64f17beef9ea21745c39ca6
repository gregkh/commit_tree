drbd: fix list corruption by failing but already aborted reads

If a read is aborted due to force-detach of a supposedly unresponsive
local backing device, and retried on the peer, it can happen that the
local request later still completes (hopefully with an error).
As it may already have been completed to upper layers meanwhile,
it must not be retried again now.
