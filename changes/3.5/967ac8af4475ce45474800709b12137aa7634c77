ext4: fix potential integer overflow in alloc_flex_gd()

In alloc_flex_gd(), when flexbg_size is large, kmalloc size would
overflow and flex_gd->groups would point to a buffer smaller than
expected, causing OOB accesses when it is used.

Note that in ext4_resize_fs(), flexbg_size is calculated using
sbi->s_log_groups_per_flex, which is read from the disk and only bounded
to [1, 31]. The patch returns NULL for too large flexbg_size.
