m68k/mm: Port OOM changes to do_page_fault()

Commit d065bd810b6deb67d4897a14bfe21f8eb526ba99
(mm: retry page fault when blocking on disk transfer) and
commit 37b23e0525d393d48a7d59f870b3bc061a30ccdb
(x86,mm: make pagefault killable)

The above commits introduced changes into the x86 pagefault handler
for making the page fault handler retryable as well as killable.

These changes reduce the mmap_sem hold time, which is crucial
during OOM killer invocation.

Port these changes to m68k.
