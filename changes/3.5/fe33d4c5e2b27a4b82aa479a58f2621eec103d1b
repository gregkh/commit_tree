ASoC: don't flip master of DT-instantiated DAI links

Commit 4924082 "ASoC: core: Flip master for CODECs in the CPU slot of a
CODEC<->CODEC link" added code that was conditional on there being no
PCM/DMA driver for the link. However, it failed to cover the case where
the link was instantiated from device tree, and hence was specified by
DT node rather than name.

This prevents the following error on Toshiba AC100:
aplay: pcm_write:1603: write error: Input/output error
