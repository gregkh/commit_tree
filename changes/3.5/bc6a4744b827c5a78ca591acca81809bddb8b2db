net/mlx4_en: num cores tx rings for every UP

Change the TX ring scheme such that the number of rings for untagged packets
and for tagged packets (per each of the vlan priorities) is the same, unlike
the current situation where for tagged traffic there's one ring per priority
and for untagged rings as the number of core.

Queue selection is done as follows:

If the mqprio qdisc is operates on the interface, such that the core networking
code invoked the device setup_tc ndo callback, a mapping of skb->priority =>
queue set is forced - for both, tagged and untagged traffic.

Else, the egress map skb->priority =>  User priority is used for tagged traffic, and
all untagged traffic is sent through tx rings of UP 0.

The patch follows the convergence of discussing that issue with John Fastabend
