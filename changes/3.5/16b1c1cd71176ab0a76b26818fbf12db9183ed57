vfs: retry last component if opening stale dentry

NFS optimizes away d_revalidates for last component of open.  This means that
open itself can find the dentry stale.

This patch allows the filesystem to return EOPENSTALE and the VFS will retry the
lookup on just the last component if possible.

If the lookup was done using RCU mode, including the last component, then this
is not possible since the parent dentry is lost.  In this case fall back to
non-RCU lookup.  Currently this is not used since NFS will always leave RCU
mode.
