blkcg: use q and plid instead of opaque void * for blkio_group association

blkgio_group is association between a block cgroup and a queue for a
given policy.  Using opaque void * for association makes things
confusing and hinders factoring of common code.  Use request_queue *
and, if necessary, policy id instead.

This will help block cgroup API cleanup.
