x86/numa: Set numa_nodes_parsed at acpi_numa_memory_affinity_init()

When hot-adding a CPU, the system outputs following messages
since node_to_cpumask_map[2] was not allocated memory.

Booting Node 2 Processor 32 APIC 0xc0
node_to_cpumask_map[2] NULL
Pid: 0, comm: swapper/32 Tainted: G       A     3.3.5-acd #21

The reason is that the bit of node 2 was not set at
numa_nodes_parsed. numa_nodes_parsed is set by only
acpi_numa_processor_affinity_init /
acpi_numa_x2apic_affinity_init. Thus even if hot-added memory
which is same PXM as hot-added CPU is written in ACPI SRAT
Table, if the hot-added CPU is not written in ACPI SRAT table,
numa_nodes_parsed is not set.

But according to ACPI Spec Rev 5.0, it says about ACPI SRAT
table as follows: This optional table provides information that
allows OSPM to associate processors and memory ranges, including
ranges of memory provided by hot-added memory devices, with
system localities / proximity domains and clock domains.

It means that ACPI SRAT table only provides information for CPUs
present at boot time and for memory including hot-added memory.
So hot-added memory is written in ACPI SRAT table, but hot-added
CPU is not written in it. Thus numa_nodes_parsed should be set
by not only acpi_numa_processor_affinity_init /
acpi_numa_x2apic_affinity_init but also
acpi_numa_memory_affinity_init for the case.

Additionally, if system has cpuless memory node,
acpi_numa_processor_affinity_init /
acpi_numa_x2apic_affinity_init cannot set numa_nodes_parseds
since these functions cannot find cpu description for the node.
In this case, numa_nodes_parsed needs to be set by
acpi_numa_memory_affinity_init.
