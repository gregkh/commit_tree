cfg80211: fix BSS comparison

Since the BSS table is organized in a RB tree, the BSSs need to be
comparable. This means that we must define a < and > operator to
the BSS object.
compare_ethr_addr isn't enough since it returns only a binary value.

Since Felix's

cfg80211: use compare_ether_addr on MAC addresses instead of memcmp

    Because of the constant size and guaranteed 16 bit alignment, the inline
    compare_ether_addr function is much cheaper than calling memcmp.

The BSS table is corrupted: rb_find_bss can't find the bss.
As a result BSSes are duplicated in the BSS table, and we get stuck
while probing an AP before associating (in STA mode).
