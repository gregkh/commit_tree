ARM: Orion: Fix WDT compile for Dove and MV78xx0

Commit 0fa1f0609a0c1fe8b2be3c0089a2cb48f7fda521 (ARM: Orion: Fix
Virtual/Physical mixup with watchdog) broke the Dove & MV78xx0
build. Although these two SoC don't use the watchdog, the shared
platform code still needs to build. Add the necessary defines.
