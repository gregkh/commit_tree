mm: sparse: fix usemap allocation above node descriptor section

After commit f5bf18fa22f8 ("bootmem/sparsemem: remove limit constraint
in alloc_bootmem_section"), usemap allocations may easily be placed
outside the optimal section that holds the node descriptor, even if
there is space available in that section.  This results in unnecessary
hotplug dependencies that need to have the node unplugged before the
section holding the usemap.

The reason is that the bootmem allocator doesn't guarantee a linear
search starting from the passed allocation goal but may start out at a
much higher address absent an upper limit.

Fix this by trying the allocation with the limit at the section end,
then retry without if that fails.  This keeps the fix from f5bf18fa22f8
of not panicking if the allocation does not fit in the section, but
still makes sure to try to stay within the section at first.
