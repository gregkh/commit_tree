mm/memcg: scanning_global_lru means mem_cgroup_disabled

Although one has to admire the skill with which it has been concealed,
scanning_global_lru(mz) is actually just an interesting way to test
mem_cgroup_disabled().  Too many developer hours have been wasted on
confusing it with global_reclaim(): just use mem_cgroup_disabled().
