igb: Disable the BMC-to-OS Watchdog Enable bit for DMAC.

Under certain scenarios, it's possible that bursty manageability traffic
over the BMC-to-OS path may overrun the internal manageability receive
buffer causing dropped manageability packets. Clearing this bit prevents
this situation by interrupting coalescing to allow manageability traffic
through.
