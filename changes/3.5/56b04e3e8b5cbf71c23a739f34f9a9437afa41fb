UBIFS: fix memory leak on error path

UBIFS leaks memory on error path in 'mount_ubifs()'. In case of failure in
'ubifs_fixup_free_space()', it does not call 'ubifs_lpt_free()' whereas LPT
data structures can potentially be allocated. The amount of memory leaked can
be quite high -- see 'ubifs_lpt_init()'.

The bug was introduced when moving the LPT initialisation earlier in the
mount process (commit '781c5717a95a74b294beb38b8276943b0f8b5bb4').
