toshiba_acpi: Add support for transflective LCD

Some Toshiba laptops have the transflective LCD and toshset
can control its backlight state.  I brought this feature to the
mainline.  To support transflective LCD, it's implemented by
adding an extra level to the backlight and having 0 change to
transflective mode.  It was tested on a Toshiba Portege R500.
