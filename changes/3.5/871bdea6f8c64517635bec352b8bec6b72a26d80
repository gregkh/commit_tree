tty/vt: handle bad user buffer in {G,P}IO_CMAP ioctl

set_get_cmap() ignored the result of {get,put}_user(), causing ioctl(vt,
{G,P}IO_CMAP, 0xdeadbeef) to silently fail.

Another side effect of this: calling the PIO_CMAP ioctl with an invalid
buffer would zero the default colormap and the palette for all vts (all
colors set to black).

Leave the default colormap intact and return -EFAULT when
reading/writing to the userspace buffer fails.
