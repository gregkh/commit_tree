Extcon: support mutually exclusive relation between cables.

There could be cables that t recannot be attaches simulatenously. Extcon
device drivers may express such information via mutually_exclusive in
struct extcon_dev.

For example, for an extcon device with 16 cables (bits 0 to 15 are
available), if mutually_exclusive = { 0x7, 0xC0, 0x81, 0 }, then, the
following attachments are prohibitted.
{0, 1}
{0, 2}
{1, 2}
{6, 7}
{0, 7}
and every attachment set that are superset of one of the above.
For the detail, please refer to linux/include/linux/extcon.h.
