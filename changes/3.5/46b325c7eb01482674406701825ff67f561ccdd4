sk_run_filter: add BPF_S_ANC_SECCOMP_LD_W

Introduces a new BPF ancillary instruction that all LD calls will be
mapped through when skb_run_filter() is being used for seccomp BPF.  The
rewriting will be done using a secondary chk_filter function that is run
after skb_chk_filter.

The code change is guarded by CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER which is added,
along with the seccomp_bpf_load() function later in this series.

This is based on http://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/2/141
