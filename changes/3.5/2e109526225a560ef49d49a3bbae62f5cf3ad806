ktest: Add an example config that does cross compiling of several archs

Add the config that I use to test several archs. I downloaded several
cross compilers from:

 http://kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/files/bin/x86_64/

and this config is an example to crosscompile several archs to make sure
that your changes do not break archs that you are not working on.
