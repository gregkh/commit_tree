iwlwifi: move queue watchdog into transport

This removes one of the two sources of device
restarts in the upper layer -- those are a bit
inconvenient because normal restarts originate
in the transport. By moving the watchdog down
it can be treated the same.

Also rewrite the watchdog logic. Timers are
much more efficient when they never fire, so
instead firing a timer every 500ms set up a
timer for each TX queue and fire it only when
the queue is really stuck. This avoids the CPU
waking up when everything is working well.

While at it, remove the wd_disable config item
and replace it by simply setting wd_timeout to
IWL_WATCHHDOG_DISABLED (0).
