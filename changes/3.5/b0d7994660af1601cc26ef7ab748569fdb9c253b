target: add unknown size flag to target_submit_cmd()

The UASP protocol does not inform the target device upfront how much
data it should expect so we have to learn in from the CDB.  So in order
to handle this case, add a TARGET_SCF_UNKNOWN_SIZE to target_submit_cmd()
and perform an explictly assignment for se_cmd->data_length from the
extracted CDB size in transport_generic_cmd_sequencer().
