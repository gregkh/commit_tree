KVM: x86 emulator: convert bsf/bsr instructions to emulate_2op_SrcV_nobyte()

The instruction emulation for bsrw is broken in KVM because
the code always uses bsr with 32 or 64 bit operand size for
emulation. Fix that by using emulate_2op_SrcV_nobyte() macro
to use guest operand size for emulation.
