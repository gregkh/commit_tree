ARM: dma-mapping: remove unconditional dependency on CMA

CMA has been enabled unconditionally on all ARMv6+ systems to solve the
long standing issue of double kernel mappings for all dma coherent
buffers. This however created a dependency on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL for
the whole ARM architecture what should be really avoided. This patch
removes this dependency and lets one use old, well-tested dma-mapping
implementation also on ARMv6+ systems without the need to use
EXPERIMENTAL stuff.
