mfd: Prevent unassigned pointer from being used in ab8500-gpadc driver

Before this patch if probe failed to find the platform IRQ it
would attempt to print a message out using dev_err, which in
turn was being passed an unassigned pointer. This patch
ensures the information passed to dev_err is correct.
