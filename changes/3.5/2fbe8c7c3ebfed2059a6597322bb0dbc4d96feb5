vga-switcheroo: Use vga_default_device()

vga-switcheroo currently changes the default VGA device by fiddling with
the IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW flag on the device. This isn't strictly accurate,
since there's no guarantee that switching also changes the ROM decoding.
Switch over to using the vgaarb functions for this.
