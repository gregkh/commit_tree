usb/net: rndis: break out <linux/rndis.h> defines

As a first step to consolidate the RNDIS implementations, break out
a common file with all the #defines and move it to <linux/rndis.h>.

This also deletes the immediate duplicated defines in the
<linux/rndis.h> file that yields a lot of compilation warnings.
