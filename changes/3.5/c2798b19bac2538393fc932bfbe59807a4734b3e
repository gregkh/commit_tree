drm/i915: i8xx interrupt handler

gen2 hardware has some significant differences from the other interrupt
routines that were glossed over and then forgotten about in the
transition to KMS. Such as

- 16bit IIR
- PendingFlip status bit

This patch reintroduces a handler specifically for gen2 for the purpose
of handling pageflips correctly, simplifying code in the process.

v2: Also fixup ring get/put irq to only access 16bit registers (Daniel)
