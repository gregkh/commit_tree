Revert "cgroup: superblock can't be released with active dentries"

This reverts commit fa980ca87d15bb8a1317853f257a505990f3ffde.  The
commit was an attempt to fix a race condition where a cgroup hierarchy
may be unmounted with positive dentry reference on root cgroup.  While
the commit made the race condition slightly more difficult to trigger,
the race was still there and could be reliably triggered using a
different test case.

Revert the incorrect fix.  The next commit will describe the race and
fix it correctly.
