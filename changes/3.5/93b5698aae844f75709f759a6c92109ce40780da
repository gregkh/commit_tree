ARM: ux500: Use correct format for dynamic IRQ assignment

This patch applies the correct format requested by the irq
domain. For chained IRQs which use GPIO lines as IRQs, we
stipulate that a two cell request is required. The first cell
contains the requested IRQ and the second can contain flags
pertaining to edge detection and level sensitive values. The
zeroth cell specifies the GPIO controller by use of a phandle.
