x86, realmode: Move SMP trampoline to unified realmode code

Migrated SMP trampoline code to the real mode blob.
SMP trampoline code is not yet removed from
.x86_trampoline because it is needed by the wakeup
code.

[ hpa: always enable compiling startup_32_smp in head_32.S... it is
  only a few instructions which go into .init on UP builds, and it makes
  the rest of the code less #ifdef ugly. ]
