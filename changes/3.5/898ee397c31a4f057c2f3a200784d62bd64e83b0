arm/dts: omap4-panda: Add twl6030 and i2c EEPROM

Update pandaboard dts file with required clock frequencies
for the i2c client devices existing on pandaboard.

Add the twl6030 node in i2c1 controller.

This is the minimal support needed to boot OMAP4 boards
without any crash.
The support for all the features included in this MFD will be
added later.

Add a generic i2c EEPROM entry.
