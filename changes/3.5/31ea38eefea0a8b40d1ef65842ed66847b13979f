stmmac: do not fail when probe and there is no csr clk defined

On some platforms, for example where we are doing the bring-up,
the csr clock is not passed from the framework and the Ethernet
device driver is failing when it can work w/o any issues and
using the default values. So this patch just warnings the case
of the csr clock cannot be acquired but w/o failing the probe
step. I have just tested it on ST STiH415 SoC (ARM).
