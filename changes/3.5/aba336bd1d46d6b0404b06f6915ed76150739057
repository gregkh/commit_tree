md: raid1/raid10: fix problem with merge_bvec_fn

The new merge_bvec_fn which calls the corresponding function
in subsidiary devices requires that mddev->merge_check_needed
be set if any child has a merge_bvec_fn.

However were were only setting that when a device was hot-added,
not when a device was present from the start.

This bug was introduced in 3.4 so patch is suitable for 3.4.y
kernels.  However that are conflicts in raid10.c so a separate
patch will be needed for 3.4.y.
