drivers/leds/leds-pca955x.c: fix race condition while setting brightness on several LEDs

When issuing the following command:

  for I in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; do
    echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/pca955x\:${I}/brightness;
  done

It is possible that all the pca955x_read_ls calls are done sequentially
before any pca955x_write_ls call is done.  This updates the LS only to
the last LED update in its set.

Fix this by using a global lock for the pca995x device during
pca955x_led_work.  Also used a struct for shared data betreen all LEDs.
