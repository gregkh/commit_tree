mm: Serialize access to min_free_kbytes

There is a race between the min_free_kbytes sysctl, memory hotplug
and transparent hugepage support enablement.  Memory hotplug uses a
zonelists_mutex to avoid a race when building zonelists. Reuse it to
serialise watermark updates.

[a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl: Older patch fixed the race with spinlock]
