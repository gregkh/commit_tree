Documentation/watchdog: Fix the file descriptor leak when no cmdline arg given

we start a infinite loop when user gives ./watchdog-test, and when user
ctrl + c's the program, we just exit immeadiately with out closing the
filedescriptor of the watchdog device. a signal handler is used to
do the job of closing the filedescriptor and exiting the program.
