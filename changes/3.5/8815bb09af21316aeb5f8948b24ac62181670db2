usbhid: prevent deadlock during timeout

On some HCDs usb_unlink_urb() can directly call the
completion handler. That limits the spinlocks that can
be taken in the handler to locks not held while calling
usb_unlink_urb()
To prevent a race with resubmission, this patch exposes
usbcore's infrastructure for blocking submission, uses it
and so drops the lock without causing a race in usbhid.
