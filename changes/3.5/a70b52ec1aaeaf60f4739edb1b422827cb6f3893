vfs: make AIO use the proper rw_verify_area() area helpers

We had for some reason overlooked the AIO interface, and it didn't use
the proper rw_verify_area() helper function that checks (for example)
mandatory locking on the file, and that the size of the access doesn't
cause us to overflow the provided offset limits etc.

Instead, AIO did just the security_file_permission() thing (that
rw_verify_area() also does) directly.

This fixes it to do all the proper helper functions, which not only
means that now mandatory file locking works with AIO too, we can
actually remove lines of code.
