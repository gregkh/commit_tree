params: add 3rd arg to option handler callback signature

Add a 3rd arg, named "doing", to unknown-options callbacks invoked
from parse_args(). The arg is passed as:

  "Booting kernel" from start_kernel(),
  initcall_level_names[i] from do_initcall_level(),
  mod->name from load_module(), via parse_args(), parse_one()

parse_args() already has the "name" parameter, which is renamed to
"doing" to better reflect current uses 1,2 above.  parse_args() passes
it to an altered parse_one(), which now passes it down into the
unknown option handler callbacks.

The mod->name will be needed to handle dyndbg for loadable modules,
since params passed by modprobe are not qualified (they do not have a
"$modname." prefix), and by the time the unknown-param callback is
called, the module name is not otherwise available.

Minor tweaks:

Add param-name to parse_one's pr_debug(), current message doesnt
identify the param being handled, add it.

Add a pr_info to print current level and level_name of the initcall,
and number of registered initcalls at that level.  This adds 7 lines
to dmesg output, like:

   initlevel:6=device, 172 registered initcalls

Drop "parameters" from initcall_level_names[], its unhelpful in the
pr_info() added above.  This array is passed into parse_args() by
do_initcall_level().
