blkcg: mass rename of blkcg API

During the recent blkcg cleanup, most of blkcg API has changed to such
extent that mass renaming wouldn't cause any noticeable pain.  Take
the chance and cleanup the naming.

* Rename blkio_cgroup to blkcg.

* Drop blkio / blkiocg prefixes and consistently use blkcg.

* Rename blkio_group to blkcg_gq, which is consistent with io_cq but
  keep the blkg prefix / variable name.

* Rename policy method type and field names to signify they're dealing
  with policy data.

* Rename blkio_policy_type to blkcg_policy.

This patch doesn't cause any functional change.
