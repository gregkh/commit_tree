drivers/net/oki-semi: Donot recompute IP header checksum

If I understand correct, NETIF_F_IP_CSUM only means the hardware
will compute the TCP/UDP checksum, IP checksum is always computed
in software

So as a workround of hardware unable to compute small packages
checksum, do not need to compute IP header checksum.
