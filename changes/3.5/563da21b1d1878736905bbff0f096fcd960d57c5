ARM: dt: tegra: pinmux changes for USB ULPI

Ensure that the USB ULPI signals are not tri-stated, and have no pull-
up or pull-down.

Ensure that the pingroup hosting the USB ULPI reset signal (GPIO PV0 or
PV1 depending on the board, so UAC) is not tri-stated, and has no pull-
up or pull-down.

This change appears larger than it is due to the grouping and sorting of
the pin configuration data.
