mtd: nand: read_page() returns max_bitflips

The ecc.read_page() method for nand drivers is changed to return the maximum
number of bitflips that were corrected on any one region covering an ecc step,
This patch doesn't change what the nand code returns to mtd.

This v2 includes the change to the fsl_ifc_nand driver requested by Scott¹.
