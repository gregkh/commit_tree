drm/i915: clear the entire gtt when using gem

We've lost our guard page somewhere in the gtt rewrite, this patch
here will restore it.

Exercised by i-g-t/tests/gem_cs_prefetch.

v2: Substract the guard page from the range we're supposed to manage
with gem. Suggested by Chris Wilson to increase the odds of old ums +
gem userspace not blowing up. To compensate for the loss of a page,
don't substract the guard page in the modeset init code any longer.
