ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod data: convert to link registration

Register interconnect links between IP blocks, rather than the IP
blocks themselves.  (The IP blocks will be registered as a side-effect
of registering the links.)

The objective is to reduce the number of lines of static data and
facilitate the sharing of IP block data between different SoCs.  These
objectives come at the penalty of increased boot time due to increased
computation.

While here, fix a few whitespace problems and inaccurate variable names.
