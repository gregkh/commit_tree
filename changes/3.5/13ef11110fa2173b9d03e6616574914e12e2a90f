dlm: fix waiter recovery

An outstanding remote operation (an lkb on the "waiter"
list) could sometimes miss being resent during recovery.
The decision was based on the lkb_nodeid field, which
could have changed during an earlier aborted recovery,
so it no longer represents the actual remote destination.
The lkb_wait_nodeid is always the actual remote node,
so it is the best value to use.
