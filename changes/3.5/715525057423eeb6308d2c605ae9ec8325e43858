[SCSI] aacraid: add an iounmap call to aac_src_ioremap

The patch 116046127d1a3bad2853d02781ad9fee33f05e5a "[SCSI] aacraid: Added
Sync.mode to support series 7/8/9 controllers" removed an iounmap call from
aac_src_ioremap. Before that, the iounmap has been called twice with the same
value (dev->base and dev->regs.src.bar0) and the iounmap complained about it
(iounmap: bad address ...).

The proper solution is a change the paremeter from bar0 to bar1.
Fix this by adding a an iounmap(dev->regs.src.bar1) call.
