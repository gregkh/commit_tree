    iwlwifi: always monitor for stuck queues

    If we only monitor while associated, the following
    can happen:
     - we're associated, and the queue stuck check
       runs, setting the queue "touch" time to X
     - we disassociate, stopping the monitoring,
       which leaves the time set to X
     - almost 2s later, we associate, and enqueue
       a frame
     - before the frame is transmitted, we monitor
       for stuck queues, and find the time set to
       X, although it is now later than X + 2000ms,
       so we decide that the queue is stuck and
       erroneously restart the device
