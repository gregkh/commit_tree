regmap: allow regmap instances to be named

Some devices have multiple separate register regions. Logically, one
regmap would be created per region. One issue that prevents this is that
each instance will attempt to create the same debugfs files. Avoid this
by allowing regmaps to be named, and use the name to construct the
debugfs directory name.
