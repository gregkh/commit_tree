USB: twl6030-usb: pass IRQF_ONESHOT to request_threaded_irq

The flag of IRQF_ONESHOT should be passed to request_threaded_irq,
otherwise the following failure message will be dumped because
hardware handler is defined as NULL:

[    2.271148] genirq: Threaded irq requested with handler=NULL and
!ONESHOT for irq 356
[    2.279541] twl6030_usb twl6030_usb: can't get IRQ 356, err -22
[    2.285919] twl6030_usb: probe of twl6030_usb failed with error -22

The patch fixes the twl6030-usb probe failure.
