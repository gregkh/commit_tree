KEYS: Use the compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 compat

Use the 32-bit compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 binary
compatibility.

Without this, keyctl(KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV) is liable to malfunction as it
uses an iovec array read from userspace - though the kernel should survive this
as it checks pointers and sizes anyway.

I think all the other keyctl() function should just work, provided (a) the top
32-bits of each 64-bit argument register are cleared prior to invoking the
syscall routine, and the 32-bit address space is right at the 0-end of the
64-bit address space.  Most of the arguments are 32-bit anyway, and so for
those clearing is not required.
