trace: Remove unused workqueue tracer

This tracer was temporarily removed in 6416669 (workqueue:
temporarily remove workqueue tracing, 2010-06-29) but never
reinstated after concurrency managed workqueues were completed.
For almost two years it hasn't been compilable so it seems nobody
is using it. Delete it.
