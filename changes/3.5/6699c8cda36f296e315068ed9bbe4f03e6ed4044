tile: fix bug in get_user() for 4-byte values

The definition of 32-bit values in the 64-bit tilegx architecture is that
they should be sign-extended regardless of whether they are considered
signed or unsigned by the compiler.  Accordingly, we need to use an
"ld4s" rather than "ld4u" to load and sign-extend for get_user().

This fixes glibc bug 14238 (see http://sourceware.org/bugzilla),
introduced during the 3.5 merge window.
