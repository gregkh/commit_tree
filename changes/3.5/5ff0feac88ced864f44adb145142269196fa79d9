sky2: fix checksum bit management on some chips

The newer flavors of Yukon II use a different method for receive
checksum offload. This is indicated in the driver by the SKY2_HW_NEW_LE
flag. On these newer chips, the BMU_ENA_RX_CHKSUM should not be set.

The driver would get incorrectly toggle the bit, enabling the old
checksum logic on these chips and cause a BUG_ON() assertion. If
receive checksum was toggled via ethtool.
