staging: comedi: refactor adl_pci9111 driver to remove forward declarations

Move the module_init/module_exit routines and variables to the
end of the source as is more typically done with other drivers.
Then rearrange the attach/detach and probe/remove functions,
this removes the need for all the forward declarations.
