[SCSI] scsi_dh_alua: Optimize the STPG command

This patch optimizes the set target port group(STPG) command. During our
testing, we found that it is not optimal to send stpg command every time
the path group switch happens. This patch uses PREF (preferred target port)
bit with combination of flags passed by multipath user level tool to
optimize this behaviour. If PREF bit is set then it issues a STPG command,
otherwise it will let implicit transfer take place.

By default there is no change in the behaviour. User tool needs to pass the
parameter to make this change take effect. Patch has been tested on NetApp
E series storage.
