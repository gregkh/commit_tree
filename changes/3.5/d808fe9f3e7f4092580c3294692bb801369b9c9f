ASoC: Add LAPIS Semiconductor ML26124 driver

ML26124-01HB/ML26124-02GD is 16bit monaural audio CODEC which has high
resistance to voltage noise. On chip regulator realizes power supply rejection
ratio be over 90dB so more than 50dB is improved than ever. ML26124-01HB/
ML26124-02GD can deliver stable audio performance without being affected by noise
from the power supply circuit and peripheral components. The chip also includes
a composite video signal output, which can be applied to various portable device
 requirements. The ML26124 is realized these functions into very small package
the size is only 2.56mm x 2.46mm therefore can be construct high quality sound
system easily.
ML26124-01HB is 25pin WCSP package; ML26124-02GD is 32pin WQFN package.
