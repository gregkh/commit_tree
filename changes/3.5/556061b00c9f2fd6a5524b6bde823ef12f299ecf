sched/nohz: Fix rq->cpu_load[] calculations

While investigating why the load-balancer did funny I found that the
rq->cpu_load[] tables were completely screwy.. a bit more digging
revealed that the updates that got through were missing ticks followed
by a catchup of 2 ticks.

The catchup assumes the cpu was idle during that time (since only nohz
can cause missed ticks and the machine is idle etc..) this means that
esp. the higher indices were significantly lower than they ought to
be.

The reason for this is that its not correct to compare against jiffies
on every jiffy on any other cpu than the cpu that updates jiffies.

This patch cludges around it by only doing the catch-up stuff from
nohz_idle_balance() and doing the regular stuff unconditionally from
the tick.
