ARM: mach-shmobile: sh73a0: fixup PINT/IRQ16-IRQ31 irq number conflict

Current IRQ16-IRQ31 irq number are located around 800 from
1ee8299a9ec1ce5137a044c7768293007b9a3267
(ARM: mach-shmobile: Use 0x3400 as INTCS vector offset)

But, the PINT0/1 IRQ number are also located around 800 from
0df1a838d678fc6ab49f983a19e905f6a42297a0
(ARM: mach-shmobile: sh73a0 PINT IRQ base fix)

This patch relocates PINT0/1 IRQ number to around 700 where is not used,
and adds current IRQ location table in comment area.
