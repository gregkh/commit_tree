mm: mmzone: MIGRATE_CMA migration type added

The MIGRATE_CMA migration type has two main characteristics:
(i) only movable pages can be allocated from MIGRATE_CMA
pageblocks and (ii) page allocator will never change migration
type of MIGRATE_CMA pageblocks.

This guarantees (to some degree) that page in a MIGRATE_CMA page
block can always be migrated somewhere else (unless there's no
memory left in the system).

It is designed to be used for allocating big chunks (eg. 10MiB)
of physically contiguous memory.  Once driver requests
contiguous memory, pages from MIGRATE_CMA pageblocks may be
migrated away to create a contiguous block.

To minimise number of migrations, MIGRATE_CMA migration type
is the last type tried when page allocator falls back to other
migration types when requested.
