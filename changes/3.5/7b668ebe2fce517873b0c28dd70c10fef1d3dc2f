drm: edid: Don't add inferred modes with higher resolution

When a monitor EDID doesn't give the preferred bit, driver assumes
that the mode with the higest resolution and rate is the preferred
mode.  Meanwhile the recent changes for allowing more modes in the
GFT/CVT ranges give actually more modes, and some modes may be over
the native size.  Thus such a mode would be picked up as the preferred
mode although it's no native resolution.

For avoiding such a problem, this patch limits the addition of
inferred modes by checking not to be greater than other modes.
Also, it checks the duplicated mode entry at the same time.
