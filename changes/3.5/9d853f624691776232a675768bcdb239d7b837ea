batman-adv: Adding hard_iface specific sysfs wrapper macros for UINT

This allows us to easily add a sysfs parameter for an unsigned int
later, which is not for a batman mesh interface (e.g. bat0), but for a
common interface instead. It allows reading and writing an atomic_t in
hard_iface (instead of bat_priv compared to the mesh variant).

Developed by Linus during a 6 months trainee study period in Ascom
(Switzerland) AG.
