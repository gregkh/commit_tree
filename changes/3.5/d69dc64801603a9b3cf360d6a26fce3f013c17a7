ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: add DSS->L3 interconnect for 3430ES1

The OMAP3 hwmod data was missing a DSS->L3 interconnect link for the
OMAP3430 ES1 DSS hwmod.  Since the hwmod code and data is being modified
to register interfaces rather than hwmods, this would result in the DSS hwmod
not being registered correctly on OMAP3430ES1.
