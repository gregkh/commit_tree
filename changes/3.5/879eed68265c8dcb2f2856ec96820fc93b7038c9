mfd: Remove wm8400 custom cache implementation

Save a useful amount of code by removing the custom cache implementation
for wm8400 and using the regmap cache. Also simplify things by not
separately reseting the CODEC registers, this is a sufficiently infrequent
operation that we can simply invalidate the entire cache when this happens.
