s390/kdump: Use real mode for PSW restart and kexec

Currently the PSW restart handler and kexec are executed in real
mode with DAT=off. For kexec/kdump the function setup_regs() is
called that uses the per-cpu variable "crash_notes". Because
there are situations when the per-cpu implementation uses vmalloc
memory, calling setup_regs() in real mode can cause a program
check interrupt.

To fix that problem this patch changes the following:

* Ensure that diag308_reset() does not change PSW bits to real mode
* Enable DAT in __do_restart() after we switched to an online CPU
* Enable DAT in __machine_kexec() after we switched to the IPL CPU
* Call setup_regs() before we switch to real mode and call purgatory
