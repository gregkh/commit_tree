ring-buffer: Add integrity check at end of iter read

There use to be ring buffer integrity checks after updating the
size of the ring buffer. But now that the ring buffer can modify
the size while the system is running, the integrity checks were
removed, as they require the ring buffer to be disabed to perform
the check.

Move the integrity check to the reading of the ring buffer via the
iterator reads (the "trace" file). As reading via an iterator requires
disabling the ring buffer, it is a perfect place to have it.

If the ring buffer happens to be disabled when updating the size,
we still perform the integrity check.
