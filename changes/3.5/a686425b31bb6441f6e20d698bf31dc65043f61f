s390/hugepages: clear page table for sw large page emulation

The software large page emulation on s390 did not clear the the
pre-allocated page table in arch_release_hugepage() before freeing
it. This could trigger the WARN_ON(!pte_none(*pte) in mm/vmalloc.c:106
and make vmap_pte_range() fail, because the page table could be reused
in page_table_alloc(). This is fixed now by calling clear_table()
before page_table_free().
