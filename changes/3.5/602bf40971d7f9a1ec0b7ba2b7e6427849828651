ARM: imx6: exit coherency when shutting down a cpu

There is a system hang issue on imx6q which can easily be seen with
running a cpu hotplug stress testing (hotplug secondary cores from
user space via sysfs interface for thousands iterations).

It turns out that the issue is caused by coherency of the cpu that
is being shut down.  When shutting down a cpu, we need to have the
cpu exit coherency to prevent it from receiving cache, TLB, or BTB
maintenance operations broadcast by other CPUs in the cluster.

Copy cpu_enter_lowpower() and cpu_leave_lowpower() from mach-vexpress
to have coherency properly handled in platform_cpu_die(), thus fix
the issue.
