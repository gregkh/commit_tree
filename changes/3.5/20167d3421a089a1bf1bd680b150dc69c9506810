x86-64: Fix accounting in kernel_physical_mapping_init()

When finding a present and acceptable 2M/1G mapping, the number
of pages mapped this way shouldn't be incremented (as it was
already incremented when the earlier part of the mapping was
established). Instead, last_map_addr needs to be updated in this
case.

Further, address increments were wrong in one place each in both
phys_pmd_init() and phys_pud_init() (lacking the aligning down
to the respective page boundary).

As we're now doing the same calculation several times, fold it
into a single instance using a local variable (matching how
kernel_physical_mapping_init() itself does it at the PGD level).

Observed during code inspection, not because of an actual
problem.
