vfs: increment iversion when a file is truncated

When a file is truncated with truncate()/ftruncate() and then closed,
iversion is not updated.  This patch uses ATTR_SIZE flag as an indication
to increment iversion.

On fput(), i_version is used to detect and flag files that have changed
and need to be re-measured in the IMA measurement policy.  When a file
is truncated with truncate()/ftruncate() and then closed, i_version is
not updated.  As a result, although the file has changed, it will not be
re-measured and added to the IMA measurement list on subsequent access.
