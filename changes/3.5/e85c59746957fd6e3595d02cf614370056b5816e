[SCSI] hpsa: dial down lockup detection during firmware flash

Dial back the aggressiveness of the controller lockup detection thread.
Currently it will declare the controller to be locked up if it goes
for 10 seconds with no interrupts and no change in the heartbeat
register.  Dial back this to 30 seconds with no heartbeat change, and
also snoop the ioctl path and if a firmware flash command is detected,
dial it back further to 4 minutes until the firmware flash command
completes.  The reason for this is that during the firmware flash
operation, the controller apparently doesn't update the heartbeat
register as frequently as it is supposed to, and we can get a false
positive.
