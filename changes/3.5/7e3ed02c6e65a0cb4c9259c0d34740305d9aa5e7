mac80211: fix num_mcast_sta counting issues

Moving a STA to an AP VLAN prevents num_mcast_sta from being decremented
once the STA leaves, because sta->sdata changes. Fix this by checking
for AP VLANs as well.

Also exclude 4-addr VLAN stations from num_mcast_sta - remote 4-addr
stations ignore 3-address multicast frames anyway. In a typical bridge
configuration they receive the same packets as 4-address unicast.

This patch also fixes clearing the sdata->u.vlan.sta pointer when the
STA is removed from a 4-addr VLAN.
