[media] gspca_pac7311: Set register page at start of init

Our init sequence was not setting the register page to point to bank 1
before setting what should be the control reg. This causes the camera to
sometimes have its LED on after init. First selecting register bank 1,
rather then assuming the current register bank is bank 1, fixes this.
