NFC: Fix possible NULL ptr deref when getting the name of a socket

llcp_sock_getname() might get called before the LLCP socket was created.
This condition isn't checked, and llcp_sock_getname will simply deref a
NULL ptr in that case.

This exists starting with d646960 ("NFC: Initial LLCP support").
