dlm: prevent connections during shutdown

During lowcomms shutdown, a new connection could possibly
be created, and attempt to use a workqueue that's been
destroyed.  Similarly, during startup, a new connection
could attempt to use a workqueue that's not been set up
yet.  Add a global variable to indicate when new connections
are allowed.
