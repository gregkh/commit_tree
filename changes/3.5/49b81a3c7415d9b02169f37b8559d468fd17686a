ramster: switch over to zsmalloc and crypto interface

RAMster does many zcache-like things.  In order to avoid major
merge conflicts at 3.4, ramster used lzo1x directly for compression
and retained a local copy of xvmalloc, while zcache moved to the
new zsmalloc allocator and the crypto API.

This patch moves ramster forward to use zsmalloc and crypto.
