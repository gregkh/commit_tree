ASoC: core: Flip master for CODECs in the CPU slot of a CODEC<->CODEC link

When two CODEC DAIs are linked directly to each other then if we give the
same master mode settings to both devices things won't work as either
neither will drive or they'll drive against each other. Flip the settings
for the DAI in the CPU slot of the DAI link.
