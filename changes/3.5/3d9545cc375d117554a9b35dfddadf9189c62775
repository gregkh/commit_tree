EHCI: maintain the ehci->command value properly

The ehci-hcd driver is a little haphazard about keeping track of the
state of the USBCMD register.  The ehci->command field is supposed to
hold the register's value (apart from a few special bits) at all
times, but it isn't maintained properly.

This patch (as1543) cleans up the situation.  It keeps ehci->command
up-to-date, and uses that value rather than reading the register from
the hardware whenever possible.
