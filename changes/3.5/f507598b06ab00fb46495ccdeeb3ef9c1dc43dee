gma500: Fix lid related crash

We now set up the lid timer before we set up the backlight.  On some
devices that causes a crash as we do a backlight change before or during
the setup.

As this fixes a crash on boot regression on some setups it ought to go
in ASAP, especially as all the user gets is a blank screen.
