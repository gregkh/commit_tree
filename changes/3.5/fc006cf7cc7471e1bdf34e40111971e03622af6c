perf/x86-ibs: Trigger overflow if remaining period is too small

There are cases where the remaining period is smaller than the minimal
possible value. In this case the counter is restarted with the minimal
period. This is of no use as the interrupt handler will trigger
immediately again and most likely hits itself. This biases the
results.

So, if the remaining period is within the min range, we better do not
restart the counter and instead trigger the overflow.
