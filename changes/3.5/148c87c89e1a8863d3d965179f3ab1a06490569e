can: c_can: fix an interrupt thrash issue with c_can driver

This patch fixes an interrupt thrash issue with c_can driver.

In c_can_isr() function interrupts are disabled and enabled only in
c_can_poll() function. c_can_isr() & c_can_poll() both read the
irqstatus flag. However, irqstatus is always read as 0 in c_can_poll()
because all C_CAN interrupts are disabled in c_can_isr(). This causes
all interrupts to be re-enabled in c_can_poll() which in turn causes
another interrupt since the event is not really handled. This keeps
happening causing a flood of interrupts.

To fix this, read the irqstatus register in isr and use the same cached
value in the poll function.
