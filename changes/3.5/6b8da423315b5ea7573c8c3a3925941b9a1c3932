brcm80211: smac: do not use US as fallback regulatory hint

The brcmsmac driver provides the country code from sprom as a regulatory
hint to cfg80211. When brcmsmac does not find a country code entry in
the sprom it passes 'US' as regulatory hint. Better approach is to rely
on the world regulatory domain in cfg80211/crda.
