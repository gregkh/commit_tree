[media] stk-webcam: Don't flip the image by default

Prior to this patch the stk-webcam driver was enabling the vflip and mirror
bits in the sensor by default. Which only is the right thing to do if the
sensor is actually mounted upside down, which it usually is not.

Actually we've received upside down reports for both usb-ids which this
driver supports, one for an "ASUSTeK Computer Inc." "A3H" laptop with
a build in 174f:a311 webcam, and one for an "To Be Filled By O.E.M."
"Z96FM" laptop with a build in 05e1:0501 webcam.
