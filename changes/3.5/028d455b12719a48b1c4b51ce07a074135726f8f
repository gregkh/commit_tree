perf record: Fix fallback to cpu-clock on ppc

perf-record on PPC is not falling back to cpu-clock:

$ perf record -ag -fo /tmp/perf.data -- sleep 1

  Error: sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 6 (No such device or address).  /bin/dmesg may provide additional information.

  Fatal: No CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y kernel support configured?

The problem is that until 2.6.37 (behavior changed with commit b0a873e)
perf on PPC returns ENXIO when hw_perf_event_init() fails. With this
patch we get the expected behavior:

$ perf record -ag -fo /tmp/perf.data -v -- sleep 1
Old kernel, cannot exclude guest or host samples.
The cycles event is not supported, trying to fall back to cpu-clock-ticks
[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.151 MB /tmp/perf.data (~6592 samples) ]
