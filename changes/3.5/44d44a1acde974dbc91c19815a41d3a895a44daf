[media] V4L: Add camera wide dynamic range control

Add V4L2_CID_WIDE_DYNAMIC_RANGE camera class control for the
camera wide dynamic range (WDR, HDR) feature. This control
can be used to enable/disable wide dynamic range. It might
get converted to a menu control in future if more options
are needed.
