tty: fix ldisc lock inversion trace

This is caused by tty_release using tty_lock_pair to lock both sides of
the pty/tty pair, and then tty_ldisc_release dropping and relocking one
side only.  We can drop both fine, so drop both to avoid any lock
ordering concerns.

Rework the release path to fix the new locking model.
