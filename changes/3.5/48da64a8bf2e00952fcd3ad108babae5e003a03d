drm/i915: Convert BUG_ON(!pll->active) and friends to a WARN

Turn a fatal lockup into a merely blank display with lots of shouty
messages.

v2: Whilst in the area, convert the other BUG_ON into less fatal errors.
In particular, note that we may be called on a PCH platform not using
PLLs, such as Haswell, and so we do not always want to BUG_ON(!pll)
