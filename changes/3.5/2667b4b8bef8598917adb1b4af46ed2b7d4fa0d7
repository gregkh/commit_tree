ASoC: jack: Push locking for jacks down to the jack

Currently operations on jack reporting take the CODEC mutex both to protect
the current jack status and also to protect the DAPM run which is triggered
on status updates. Since the addition of a DAPM-specific lock we no longer
need to worry about locking DAPM as it has its own finer grained lock so
create a per jack lock to take care of the jack status.

This is both cleaner where the jack isn't specifically associated with a
CODEC and clearer as it's much more obvious what the lock is protecting.
