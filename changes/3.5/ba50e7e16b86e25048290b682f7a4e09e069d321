[media] cx25840: fix regression in HVR-1800 analog support

The refactoring of the cx25840 driver to support the cx23888 caused breakage
with the existing support for cx23885/cx23887 analog support.  Rework the
routines such that the new code is only used for the 888.

Validated with the following boards:

HVR-1800 retail (0070:7801)
HVR-1800 OEM (0070:7809)
HVR_1850 retail (0070:8541)

Thanks to Steven Toth and Hauppauge for loaning me various boards to
regression test with.
