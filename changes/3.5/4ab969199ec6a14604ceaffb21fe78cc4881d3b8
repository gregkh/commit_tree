KVM: PPC: e500mc: Add doorbell emulation support

When one vcpu wants to kick another, it can issue a special IPI instruction
called msgsnd. This patch emulates this instruction, its clearing counterpart
and the infrastructure required to actually trigger that interrupt inside
a guest vcpu.

With this patch, SMP guests on e500mc work.
