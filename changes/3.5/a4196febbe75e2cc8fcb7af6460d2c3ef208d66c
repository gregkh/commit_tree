video: s3c-fb: move video interface timing out of window setup data

The video interface timing is independent of the window setup data.
The resolution of the window can be smaller than that of the lcd
panel to which the video data is output.

So move the video timing data from the per-window setup data to the
platform specific section in the platform data. This also removes
the restriction that atleast one window should have the same
resolution as that of the panel attached.
