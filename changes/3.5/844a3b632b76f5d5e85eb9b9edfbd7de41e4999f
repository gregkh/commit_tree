ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod data: remove forward declarations, reorganize

Reorganize the hwmod data to declare the IP blocks first and the
interconnects second.  This allows us to remove the forward
declarations, which this patch also does. Saves some lines of source
data.  While here, take the opportunity to synchronize the order of
the OMAP44xx hwmod data with the autogenerator output -- it's slightly
different due to past mismerges -- and fix a few minor typos and
whitespace problems in the files.
