ASoC: wm9705: Fix build due to removal of 'runtime' definition

sound/soc/codecs/wm9705.c: In function 'ac97_prepare':
sound/soc/codecs/wm9705.c:251: error: 'runtime' undeclared (first use in this function)

This was caused by commit e6968a (ASoC: codecs: Remove rtd->codec usage from CODEC drivers),
which removed the 'struct snd_pcm_runtime *runtime = substream->runtime' definition.
