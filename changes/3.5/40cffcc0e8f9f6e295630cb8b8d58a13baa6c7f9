md/bitmap: create a 'struct bitmap_counts' substructure of 'struct bitmap'

The new "struct bitmap_counts" contains all the fields that are
related to counting the number of active writes in each bitmap chunk.

Having this separate will make it easier to change the chunksize
or overall size of a bitmap atomically.
