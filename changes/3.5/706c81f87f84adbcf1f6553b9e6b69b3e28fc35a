ftrace: Remove extra helper functions

The ftrace_record_ip() and ftrace_alloc_dyn_node() were from the
time of the ftrace daemon. Although they were still used, they
still make things a bit more complex than necessary.

Move the code into the one function that uses it, and remove the
helper functions.
