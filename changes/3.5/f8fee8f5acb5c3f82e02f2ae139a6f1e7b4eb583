vga_switcheroo.h: fix pci_dev warning

Fix warnings on some architectures/configs (not on x86):

include/linux/vga_switcheroo.h:28:30: warning: 'struct pci_dev' declared inside parameter list [enabled by default]
include/linux/vga_switcheroo.h:28:30: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want [enabled by default]
