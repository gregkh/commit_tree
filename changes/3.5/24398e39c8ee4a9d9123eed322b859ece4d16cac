mac80211: set HT channel before association

Changing the channel type during operation is
confusing to some drivers and will be hard to
handle in multi-channel scenarios. Instead of
changing the channel, set it to the right HT
channel before authenticating/associating and
don't change it -- just update the 20/40 MHz
restrictions in rate control as needed when
changed by the AP.

This also fixes a problem that Paul missed in
his fix for the "regulatory makes us deaf"
issue -- when we couldn't use 40 MHz we still
associated saying we were using 40 MHz, which
could in similarly broken APs make us never
even connect successfully.
