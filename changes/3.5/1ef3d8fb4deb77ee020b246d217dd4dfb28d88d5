max17042_battery: Fix a couple buffer overflows

There are a couple issues here caused by confusion between sizeof()
and ARRAY_SIZE().  "table_size" should be the number of elements, but we
should allocate it with kcalloc() so that we allocate the correct number
of bytes.

In max17042_init_model() we don't allocate enough space so we go past
the end of the array in max17042_read_model_data() and
max17042_model_data_compare().

In max17042_verify_model_lock() we allocate the right amount of space
but we call max17042_read_model_data() with the wrong number of elements
and also in the for loop we go past the end of the array.
