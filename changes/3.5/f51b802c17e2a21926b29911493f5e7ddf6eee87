blkcg: use the usual get blkg path for root blkio_group

For root blkg, blk_throtl_init() was using throtl_alloc_tg()
explicitly and cfq_init_queue() was manually initializing embedded
cfqd->root_group, adding unnecessarily different code paths to blkg
handling.

Make both use the usual blkio_group get functions - throtl_get_tg()
and cfq_get_cfqg() - for the root blkio_group too.  Note that
blk_throtl_init() callsite is pushed downwards in
blk_alloc_queue_node() so that @q is sufficiently initialized for
throtl_get_tg().

This simplifies root blkg handling noticeably for cfq and will allow
further modularization of blkcg API.

-v2: Vivek pointed out that using cfq_get_cfqg() won't work if
     CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED is disabled.  Fix it by factoring out
     initialization of base part of cfqg into cfq_init_cfqg_base() and
     alloc/init/free explicitly if !CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED.
