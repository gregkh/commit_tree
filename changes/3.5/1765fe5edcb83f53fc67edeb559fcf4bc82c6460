target: Fix range calculation in WRITE SAME emulation when num blocks == 0

When NUMBER OF LOGICAL BLOCKS is 0, WRITE SAME is supposed to write
all the blocks from the specified LBA through the end of the device.
However, dev->transport->get_blocks(dev) (perhaps confusingly) returns
the last valid LBA rather than the number of blocks, so the correct
number of blocks to write starting with lba is

dev->transport->get_blocks(dev) - lba + 1

(nab: Backport roland's for-3.6 patch to for-3.5)
