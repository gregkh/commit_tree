ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: add HDQ/1-wire hwmod

Add the HDQ1W hwmod for OMAP34xx, OMAP36xx, and AM3505/3517 devices.
According to the respective TRMs, it doesn't appear to be available for the
816x/814x or the AM335x.

The OCPIF_SWSUP_IDLE flag is added to work around an apparent hardware
bug: the hardware is not taking the CM_FCLKEN*_CORE.EN_HDQ bit into
account when considering whether to go idle:

This causes HDQ transfers to fail or become corrupt.  Thanks to
NeilBrown for his help diagnosing and testing fixes for this problem.
