perf evlist: Explicititely initialize input_name

It was a global variable, so it was initialized, implicitely, to zero by
being placed in the bss.

Now it is just a local variable that is then passed to the __cmd_evlist
routine, so it must be explicitely set to NULL.

The problem manifested on a Fedora 17 system, using:

 gcc version 4.7.0 20120507 (Red Hat 4.7.0-5) (GCC)

But not on several other systems, by luck.
