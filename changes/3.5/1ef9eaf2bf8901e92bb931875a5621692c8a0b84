params.c: fix Smack complaint about parse_args

In commit 9fb48c744: "params: add 3rd arg to option handler callback
signature", the if-guard added to the pr_debug was overzealous; no
callers pass NULL, and existing code above and below the guard assumes
as much.  Change the if-guard to match, and silence the Smack
complaint.
