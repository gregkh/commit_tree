net ax25: Simplify and cleanup the ax25 sysctl handling.

Don't register/unregister every ax25 table in a batch.  Instead register
and unregister per device ax25 sysctls as ax25 devices come and go.

This moves ax25 to be a completely modern sysctl user.  Registering the
sysctls in just the initial network namespace, removing the use of
.child entries that are no longer natively supported by the sysctl core
and taking advantage of the fact that there are no longer any ordering
constraints between registering and unregistering different sysctl
tables.
