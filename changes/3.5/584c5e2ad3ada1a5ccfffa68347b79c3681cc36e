net: filter: Fix some more small issues in sparc JIT.

Fix mixed space and tabs.

Put bpf_jit_load_*[] externs into bpf_jit.h

"while(0)" --> "while (0)"
"COND (X)" --> "COND(X)"
Document branch offset calculations, and bpf_error's return
sequence.

Document the reason we need to emit three nops between the
%y register write and the divide instruction.

Remove erroneous trailing semicolons from emit_read_y() and
emit_write_y().

Based upon feedback from Sam Ravnborg.
