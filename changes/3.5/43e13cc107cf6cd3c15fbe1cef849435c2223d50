cred: remove task_is_dead() from __task_cred() validation

Commit 8f92054e7ca1 ("CRED: Fix __task_cred()'s lockdep check and banner
comment"):

    add the following validation condition:

        task->exit_state >= 0

    to permit the access if the target task is dead and therefore
    unable to change its own credentials.

OK, but afaics currently this can only help wait_task_zombie() which calls
__task_cred() without rcu lock.

Remove this validation and change wait_task_zombie() to use task_uid()
instead.  This means we do rcu_read_lock() only to shut up the lockdep,
but we already do the same in, say, wait_task_stopped().

task_is_dead() should die, task->exit_state != 0 means that this task has
passed exit_notify(), only do_wait-like code paths should use this.

Unfortunately, we can't kill task_is_dead() right now, it has already
acquired buggy users in drivers/staging.  The fix already exists.
