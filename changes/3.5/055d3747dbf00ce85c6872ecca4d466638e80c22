md/raid10: fix failure when trying to repair a read error.

commit 58c54fcca3bac5bf9290cfed31c76e4c4bfbabaf
     md/raid10: handle further errors during fix_read_error better.

in 3.1 added "r10_sync_page_io" which takes an IO size in sectors.
But we were passing the IO size in bytes!!!
This resulting in bio_add_page failing, and empty request being sent
down, and a consequent BUG_ON in scsi_lib.

[fix missing space in error message at same time]

This fix is suitable for 3.1.y and later.
