mtd: print out the page size and oob size after parsing out the nand

Some not-supported nand chips may pass the current parsing code,
and get the wrong page size and oob size. Sometimes, it's hard to notice
that you get the wrong values, because there is no warning or error.

So it's useful to print out the page size and oob size in the end of
the parsing function. We can check these values with the datasheet of the nand
chip as soon as possible.
