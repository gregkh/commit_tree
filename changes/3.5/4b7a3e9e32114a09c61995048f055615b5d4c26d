rcu: Remove fast check path from __synchronize_srcu()

The fastpath in __synchronize_srcu() is designed to handle cases where
there are a large number of concurrent calls for the same srcu_struct
structure.  However, the Linux kernel currently does not use SRCU in
this manner, so remove the fastpath checks for simplicity.
