mmc: sdio: avoid spurious calls to interrupt handlers

Commit 06e8935feb ("optimized SDIO IRQ handling for single irq")
introduced some spurious calls to SDIO function interrupt handlers,
such as when the SDIO IRQ thread is started, or the safety check
performed upon a system resume.  Let's add a flag to perform the
optimization only when a real interrupt is signaled by the host
driver and we know there is no point confirming it.
