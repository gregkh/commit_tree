Bluetooth: Add the l2cap_seq_list structure for tracking frames

A sequence list is a data structure used to track frames that need to
be retransmitted, and frames that have been requested for
retransmission by the remote device.  It can compactly represent a
list of sequence numbers within the ERTM transmit window.  Memory for
the list is allocated once at connection time, and common operations
in ERTM are O(1).
