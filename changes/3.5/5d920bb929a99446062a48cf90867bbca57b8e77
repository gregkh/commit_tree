sh: initial stack protector support.

This implements basic -fstack-protector support, based on the early ARM
version in c743f38013aeff58ef6252601e397b5ba281c633. The SMP case is
limited to the initial canary value, while the UP case handles per-task
granularity (limited to 32-bit sh until a new enough sh64 compiler
manifests itself).
