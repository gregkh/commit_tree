xen/p2m: An early bootup variant of set_phys_to_machine

During early bootup we can't use alloc_page, so to allocate
leaf pages in the P2M we need to use extend_brk. For that
we are utilizing the early_alloc_p2m and early_alloc_p2m_middle
functions to do the job for us. This function follows the
same logic as set_phys_to_machine.
