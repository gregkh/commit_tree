ipvs: fix oops in ip_vs_dst_event on rmmod

	After commit 39f618b4fd95ae243d940ec64c961009c74e3333 (3.4)
"ipvs: reset ipvs pointer in netns" we can oops in
ip_vs_dst_event on rmmod ip_vs because ip_vs_control_cleanup
is called after the ipvs_core_ops subsys is unregistered and
net->ipvs is NULL. Fix it by exiting early from ip_vs_dst_event
if ipvs is NULL. It is safe because all services and dests
for the net are already freed.
