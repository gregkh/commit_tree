ftrace: Make ftrace_modify_all_code() global for archs to use

Rename __ftrace_modify_code() to ftrace_modify_all_code() and make
it global for all archs to use. This will remove the duplication
of code, as archs that can modify code without stop_machine()
can use it directly outside of the stop_machine() call.
