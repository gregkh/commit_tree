xfs: kill xfs_read_buf()

xfs_read_buf() is effectively the same as xfs_trans_read_buf() when called
outside a transaction context. The error handling is slightly different in that
xfs_read_buf stales the errored buffer it gets back, but there is probably good
reason for xfs_trans_read_buf() for doing this.

Hence update xfs_trans_read_buf() to the same error handling as xfs_read_buf(),
and convert all the callers of xfs_read_buf() to use the former function. We can
then remove xfs_read_buf().
