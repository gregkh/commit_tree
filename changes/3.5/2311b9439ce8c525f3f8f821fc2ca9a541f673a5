NFS: Don't pass mount data to nfs_fscache_get_super_cookie()

I intend on creating a single nfs_fs_mount() function used by all our
mount paths.  To avoid checking between new mounts and clone mounts, I
instead pass both structures to a new function in super.c that finds the
cache key and then looks up the super cookie.
