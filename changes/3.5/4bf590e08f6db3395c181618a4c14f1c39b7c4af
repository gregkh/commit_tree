NFS: Add nfs_client behavior flags

"noresvport" and "discrtry" can be passed to nfs_create_rpc_client()
by setting flags in the passed-in nfs_client.  This change makes it
easy to add new flags.

Note that these settings are now "sticky" over the lifetime of a
struct nfs_client, and may even be copied when an nfs_client is
cloned.
