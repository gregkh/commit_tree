can: c_can: fix race condition in c_can_open()

Fix the issue of C_CAN interrupts getting disabled forever when canconfig
utility is used multiple times. According to NAPI usage we disable all
the hardware interrupts in ISR and re-enable them in poll(). Current
implementation calls napi_enable() after hardware interrupts are enabled.
If we get any interrupts between these two steps then we do not process
those interrupts because napi is not enabled. Mostly these interrupts
come because of STATUS is not 0x7 or ERROR interrupts. If napi_enable()
happens before HW interrupts enabled then c_can_poll() function will be
called eventual re-enabling.

This patch moves the napi_enable() call before interrupts enabled.
