mm: extend prefault helpers to fault in more than PAGE_SIZE

drm/i915 wants to read/write more than one page in its fastpath
and hence needs to prefault more than PAGE_SIZE bytes.

Add new functions in filemap.h to make that possible.

Also kill a copy&pasted spurious space in both functions while at it.

v2: As suggested by Andrew Morton, add a multipage parameter to both
functions to avoid the additional branch for the pagemap.c hotpath.
My gcc 4.6 here seems to dtrt and indeed reap these branches where not
needed.

v3: Becaus I couldn't find a way around adding a uaddr += PAGE_SIZE to
the filemap.c hotpaths (that the compiler couldn't remove again),
let's go with separate new functions for the multipage use-case.

v4: Adjust comment to CodingStlye and fix spelling.
