8139cp/8139too: terminate the eeprom access with the right opmode

Currently, we terminate the eeprom access through clearing the CS by:

RTL_W8 (Cfg9346, ~EE_CS); or writeb (~EE_CS, ee_addr);

This would left the eeprom into "Config. Register Write Enable:"
state which is not expcted as the highest two bits were set to
0x11 ( expected is the "Normal" mode (0x00)). Solving this by write
0x0 instead of ~EE_CS when terminating the eeprom access.
