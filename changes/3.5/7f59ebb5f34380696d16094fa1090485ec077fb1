airo: copying wrong data in airo_get_aplist()

"qual" used to be declared on the stack, but then in 998a5a7d6a ("airo:
reduce stack memory footprint") we made it dynamically allocated.
Unfortunately the memcpy() here was missed and it's still copying stack
memory instead of the data that we want.  In other words, "&qual" should
be "qual".
