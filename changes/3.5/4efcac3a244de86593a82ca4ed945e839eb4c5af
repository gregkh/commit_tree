sparc: Optimize strncpy_from_user() zero byte search.

Compute a mask that will only have 0x80 in the bytes which
had a zero in them.  The formula is:

	~(((x & 0x7f7f7f7f) + 0x7f7f7f7f) | x | 0x7f7f7f7f)

In the inner word iteration, we have to compute the "x | 0x7f7f7f7f"
part, so we can reuse that in the above calculation.

Once we have this mask, we perform divide and conquer to find the
highest 0x80 location.
