timer: Fix mod_timer_pinned() header comment

The mod_timer_pinned() header comment states that it prevents timers
from being migrated to a different CPU.  This is not the case, instead,
it ensures that the timer is posted to the current CPU, but does nothing
to prevent CPU-hotplug operations from migrating the timer.

This commit therefore brings the comment header into alignment with
reality.
