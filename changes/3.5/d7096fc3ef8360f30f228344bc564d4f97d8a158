Btrfs: wake up transaction waiters when aborting a transaction

I was getting lots of hung tasks and a NULL pointer dereference because we
are not cleaning up the transaction properly when it aborts.  First we need
to reset the running_transaction to NULL so we don't get a bad dereference
for any start_transaction callers after this.  Also we cannot rely on
waitqueue_active() since it's just a list_empty(), so just call wake_up()
directly since that will do the barrier for us and such.  Thanks,
