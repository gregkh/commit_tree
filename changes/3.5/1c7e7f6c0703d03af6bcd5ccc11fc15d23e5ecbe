mm: fix lost kswapd wakeup in kswapd_stop()

Offlining memory may block forever, waiting for kswapd() to wake up
because kswapd() does not check the event kthread->should_stop before
sleeping.

The proper pattern, from Documentation/memory-barriers.txt, is:

   ---  waker  ---
   event_indicated = 1;
   wake_up_process(event_daemon);

   ---  sleeper  ---
   for (;;) {
      set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
      if (event_indicated)
         break;
      schedule();
   }

   set_current_state() may be wrapped by:
      prepare_to_wait();

In the kswapd() case, event_indicated is kthread->should_stop.

  === offlining memory (waker) ===
   kswapd_stop()
      kthread_stop()
         kthread->should_stop = 1
         wake_up_process()
         wait_for_completion()

  ===  kswapd_try_to_sleep (sleeper) ===
   kswapd_try_to_sleep()
      prepare_to_wait()
           .
           .
      schedule()
           .
           .
      finish_wait()

The schedule() needs to be protected by a test of kthread->should_stop,
which is wrapped by kthread_should_stop().

Reproducer:
   Do heavy file I/O in background.
   Do a memory offline/online in a tight loop
