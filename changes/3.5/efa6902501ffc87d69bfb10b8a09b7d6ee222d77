PM / Domains: Make device removal more straightforward

The removal of a device from a PM domain doesn't have to browse
the domain's device list, because it can check directly if the
device belongs to the given domain.  Moreover, it should clear
the domain_data pointer in dev->power.subsys_data, because
dev_pm_put_subsys_data(dev) may not remove dev->power.subsys_data
and the stale domain data pointer may cause problems to happen.

Rework pm_genpd_remove_device() taking the above observations into
account.
