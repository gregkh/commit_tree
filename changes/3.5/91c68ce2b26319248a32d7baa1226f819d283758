net: cgroup: fix out of bounds accesses

dev->priomap is allocated by extend_netdev_table() called from
update_netdev_tables().
And this is only called if write_priomap() is called.

But if write_priomap() is not called, it seems we can have out of bounds
accesses in cgrp_destroy(), read_priomap() & skb_update_prio()
