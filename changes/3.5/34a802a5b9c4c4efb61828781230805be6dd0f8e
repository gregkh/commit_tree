tcp: move stats merge to the end of tcp_try_coalesce

This change cleans up the last bits of tcp_try_coalesce so that we only
need one goto which jumps to the end of the function.  The idea is to make
the code more readable by putting things in a linear order so that we start
execution at the top of the function, and end it at the bottom.

I also made a slight tweak to the code for handling frags when we are a
clone.  Instead of making it an if (clone) loop else nr_frags = 0 I changed
the logic so that if (!clone) we just set the number of frags to 0 which
disables the for loop anyway.
