sched/nohz: Rewrite and fix load-avg computation -- again

Thanks to Charles Wang for spotting the defects in the current code:

 - If we go idle during the sample window -- after sampling, we get a
   negative bias because we can negate our own sample.

 - If we wake up during the sample window we get a positive bias
   because we push the sample to a known active period.

So rewrite the entire nohz load-avg muck once again, now adding
copious documentation to the code.
