x86, relocs: Workaround for binutils 2.22.52.0.1 section bug

GNU ld 2.22.52.0.1 has a bug that it blindly changes symbols from
section-relative to absolute if they are in a section of zero length.
This turns the symbols __init_begin and __init_end into absolute
symbols.  Let the relocs program know that those should be treated as
relative symbols.
