ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: remove pseudo-hwmods associated with hardreset lines

Remove the pseudo-hwmods associated with hardreset lines from the
OMAP4 data file.  Future patches will convert this data to register
hwmods by interfaces, rather than registering hwmods directly.  The
pseudo-hwmods aren't associated with any interfaces, so this will
create a problem.

After this change, the hwmod code will reset processor IPs at the
hwmod level, rather than by individual hardreset lines.  So, for
example, if the IVA device driver code wishes to place one of the
sequencer cores into reset, while leaving the other active, it must do
so itself by calling the appropriate PRM functions.

This patch will cause a change in the initialization behavior of the
DSP, IVA, and IPU.
