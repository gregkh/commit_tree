drm/i915: Refactor put_fence() to use the common fence writing routine

One clarification that we make is to the existing semantics of
obj->tiling_changed to only mean that we need to update an associated
fence register (including the NO_FENCE when executing an untiled but
fenced GPU command). If we do not have a fence register or pending
fenced GPU access for the object (after put_fence() for example), then
we can clear the tiling_changed flag as any fence will necessarily be
rewritten upon acquisition.
