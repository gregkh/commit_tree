perf record: Fix branch_stack type in perf_record_opts

The attr.branch_sample_type field is defined as u64 by the API.  As
such, we need to ensure the variable holding the value of the branch
stack filters is also u64 otherwise we may lose bits in the future.

Note also that the bogus definition of the field in perf_record_opts
caused problems on big-endian PPC systems.  Thanks to Anshuman Khandual
for tracking the problem on PPC.
