Btrfs: use delayed ref sequence numbers for all fs-tree updates

The sequence number for delayed refs is needed to postpone certain delayed
refs for a very short period while walking backrefs. Before the tree
modification log, we thought we'd only have to hold back those references
that don't have a counter operation.

While now we've the tree mod log, we're rewinding fs tree blocks to a
defined consistent state. We cannot know in advance for which tree block
we'll be doing rewind operations later. Therefore, we must postpone all the
delayed refs for fs-tree blocks, even those having a counter operation.
