ARM: SAMSUNG: Fix for S3C2412 EBI memory mapping

While upgrading the kernel on a S3C2412 based board I've noted
that it was impossible to boot the board with a 2.6.32 or upper
kernel. I've tracked down the problem to the EBI virtual memory
mapping that is in conflict with the IO mapping definition in
arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/s3c2412.c.
