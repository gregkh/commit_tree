netfilter: xt_HMARK: fix endianness and provide consistent hashing

This patch addresses two issues:

a) Fix usage of u32 and __be32 that causes endianess warnings via sparse.
b) Ensure consistent hashing in a cluster that is composed of big and
   little endian systems. Thus, we obtain the same hash mark in an
   heterogeneous cluster.
