KEYS: Don't check for NULL key pointer in key_validate()

Don't bother checking for NULL key pointer in key_validate() as all of the
places that call it will crash anyway if the relevant key pointer is NULL by
the time they call key_validate().  Therefore, the checking must be done prior
to calling here.

Whilst we're at it, simplify the key_validate() function a bit and mark its
argument const.
