x86, realmode: Move end signature into header.S

The end signature was defined in wakeup_asm.S as it originally came
from the ACPI wakeup code.  However, we rely on the existence of the
.signature section to expand .bss, otherwise we would have to include
code to explicitly zero the .bss depending on the configuration.
Since the expanded .bss is just in .init.data anyway, it's easier to
always have it expanded.

This fixes failures when compiled without CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP.
