md: dm-raid should call helper function to clear rdev.

dm-raid currently open-codes the freeing of some members of
and rdev.  It is more maintainable to have it call common code
from md.c which does this for all call-sites.

So remove free_disk_sb to md_rdev_clear, export it, and use it in
dm-raid.c
