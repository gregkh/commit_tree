apparmor: fix long path failure due to disconnected path

BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/955892

All failures from __d_path where being treated as disconnected paths,
however __d_path can also fail when the generated pathname is too long.

The initial ENAMETOOLONG error was being lost, and ENAMETOOLONG was only
returned if the subsequent dentry_path call resulted in that error.  Other
wise if the path was split across a mount point such that the dentry_path
fit within the buffer when the __d_path did not the failure was treated
as a disconnected path.
