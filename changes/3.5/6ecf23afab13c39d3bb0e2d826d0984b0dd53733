block: extend queue bypassing to cover blkcg policies

Extend queue bypassing such that dying queue is always bypassing and
blk-throttle is drained on bypass.  With blkcg policies updated to
test blk_queue_bypass() instead of blk_queue_dead(), this ensures that
no bio or request is held by or going through blkcg policies on a
bypassing queue.

This will be used to implement blkg cleanup on elevator switches and
policy changes.
