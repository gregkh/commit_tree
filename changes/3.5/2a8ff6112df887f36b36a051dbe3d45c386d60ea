Bluetooth: btmrvl: configure default host sleep parameters

Currently debugfs commands "hscfgcmd" and "gpiogap" are provided
for host sleep configuration. But if user doesn't configure host
sleep parameters using these commands, host sleep activation is
failed during suspend (support for suspend and resume handlers is
added in next patch).

Default host sleep configuration is done during driver initialisation
in this patch.
