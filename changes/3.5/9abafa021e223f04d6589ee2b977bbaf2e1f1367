ARM: tegra: change pll_p_out4's rate to 24MHz

pll_p_out4 is used on all/most Tegra boards to drive the cdev2 output pin
to provide a reference clock to a ULPI USB PHY. This reference clock must
run at 24MHz, and the cdev2 output has no additional dividers.

Remove board-paz00.c's now-duplicate initialization of this clock.
