usb: [MIPS] fix unresolved err() reference in host/ohci-pnx8550.c

Commit af4e1ee04026908086d7ed252db2619a8ceaa333 (usb-next)

    "USB: remove err() macro"

was preceeded by a tree-wide cleanup of users, however this
one squeaked through the cracks because it had whitespace
between the function name and the bracket for the args.

Map it onto dev_err, just like all the "pre-commits" made
in advance of af4e1ee04026, such as the example seen in
the commit d57b177208b6ec20cacd7321ee32ef02f9f9e7fa:

    "USB: ohci-xls.c: remove err() usage"

Build tested with the MIPS pnx8550-jbs_defconfig settings.
