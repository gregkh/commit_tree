sched/numa: Load balance between remote nodes

Commit cb83b629b ("sched/numa: Rewrite the CONFIG_NUMA sched
domain support") removed the NODE sched domain and started checking
if the node distance in SLIT table is farther than REMOTE_DISTANCE,
if so, it will lose the load balance chance at exec/fork/wake_affine
points.

But actually, even the node distance is farther than REMOTE_DISTANCE.

Modern CPUs also has QPI like connections, which ensures that memory
access is not too slow between nodes. So the above change in behavior
on NUMA machine causes a performance regression on various benchmarks:
hackbench, tbench, netperf, oltp, etc.

This patch will recover the scheduler behavior to old mode on all my
Intel platforms: NHM EP/EX, WSM EP, SNB EP/EP4S, and thus fixes the
perfromance regressions. (all of them just have 2 kinds distance, 10, 21)
