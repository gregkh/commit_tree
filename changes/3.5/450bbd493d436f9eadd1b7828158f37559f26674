perf/x86-ibs: Precise event sampling with IBS for AMD CPUs

This patch adds support for precise event sampling with IBS. There are
two counting modes to count either cycles or micro-ops. If the
corresponding performance counter events (hw events) are setup with
the precise flag set, the request is redirected to the ibs pmu:

 perf record -a -e cpu-cycles:p ...    # use ibs op counting cycle count
 perf record -a -e r076:p ...          # same as -e cpu-cycles:p
 perf record -a -e r0C1:p ...          # use ibs op counting micro-ops

Each ibs sample contains a linear address that points to the
instruction that was causing the sample to trigger. With ibs we have
skid 0. Thus, ibs supports precise levels 1 and 2. Samples are marked
with the PERF_EFLAGS_EXACT flag set. In rare cases the rip is invalid
when IBS was not able to record the rip correctly. Then the
PERF_EFLAGS_EXACT flag is cleared and the rip is taken from pt_regs.

V2:
* don't drop samples in precise level 2 if rip is invalid, instead
  support the PERF_EFLAGS_EXACT flag
