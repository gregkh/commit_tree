xen/acpi/sleep: Enable ACPI sleep via the __acpi_os_prepare_sleep

Provide the registration callback to call in the Xen's
ACPI sleep functionality. This means that during S3/S5
we make a hypercall XENPF_enter_acpi_sleep with the
proper PM1A/PM1B registers.

Based of Ke Yu's <ke.yu@intel.com> initial idea.

[v1: Added Copyright and license]
[v2: Added check if PM1A/B the 16-bits MSB contain something. The spec
     only uses 16-bits but might have more in future]
