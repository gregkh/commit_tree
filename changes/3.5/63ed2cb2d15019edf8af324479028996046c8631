drm/i915: rip out GEM drm feature checks

We always set it so there's no point in checking. We could
instead add a bit that tells us whether gem is actually
initialized (i.e. either kms or gem_init_ioctl called), but
that's imho not worth it.

So just rip it out.

There's a little change in the wait_ring timeout, but we've never
run with anything else than the 60 second timeout, even on dri1
userspace.
