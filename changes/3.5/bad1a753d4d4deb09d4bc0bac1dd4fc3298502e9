x86, x32, ptrace: Remove PTRACE_ARCH_PRCTL for x32

When I added x32 ptrace to 3.4 kernel, I also include PTRACE_ARCH_PRCTL
support for x32 GDB  For ARCH_GET_FS/GS, it takes a pointer to int64.  But
at user level, ARCH_GET_FS/GS takes a pointer to int32.  So I have to add
x32 ptrace to glibc to handle it with a temporary int64 passed to kernel and
copy it back to GDB as int32.  Roland suggested that PTRACE_ARCH_PRCTL
is obsolete and x32 GDB should use fs_base and gs_base fields of
user_regs_struct instead.

Accordingly, remove PTRACE_ARCH_PRCTL completely from the x32 code to
avoid possible memory overrun when pointer to int32 is passed to
kernel.
