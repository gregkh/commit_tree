res_counter: Account max_usage when calling res_counter_charge_nofail()

Updating max_usage is something one would expect when we reach
a new maximum usage value even when we do this by forcing through
the limit with res_counter_charge_nofail().

(Whether we want to account failcnt when we force through the limit
is another debate).
