ARM: ux500: New DT:ed u8500_init_devices for one-by-one device enablement

During Device Tree enablement it is necessary to remove
<hw_component>_add_<device> calls one at at time, as and when particular
devices are DT enabled. This patch provides a temporary solution. Once
the new *of_init_devices function has been fully unpopulated it will be
removed again.
