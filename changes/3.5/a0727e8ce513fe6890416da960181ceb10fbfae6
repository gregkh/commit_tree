signal, x86: add SIGSYS info and make it synchronous.

This change enables SIGSYS, defines _sigfields._sigsys, and adds
x86 (compat) arch support.  _sigsys defines fields which allow
a signal handler to receive the triggering system call number,
the relevant AUDIT_ARCH_* value for that number, and the address
of the callsite.

SIGSYS is added to the SYNCHRONOUS_MASK because it is desirable for it
to have setup_frame() called for it. The goal is to ensure that
ucontext_t reflects the machine state from the time-of-syscall and not
from another signal handler.

The first consumer of SIGSYS would be seccomp filter.  In particular,
a filter program could specify a new return value, SECCOMP_RET_TRAP,
which would result in the system call being denied and the calling
thread signaled.  This also means that implementing arch-specific
support can be dependent upon HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER.
