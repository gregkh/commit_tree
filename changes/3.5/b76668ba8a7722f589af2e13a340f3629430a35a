function in struct max8997_muic_platform_data to notify cable state
of notifee which want to know always newly cable state when external
connector(e.g., USB, TA, JIG) is attached or detached.

- Use Extcon interface to notify cable state of notifee instead of

- Bug fix of getting platform_data for irq_base value.
