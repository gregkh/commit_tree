igb: Fix incorrect RAR address entries for i210/i211 device.

i210/i211 device has only 16 RAR address filters like 82575, instead of
32 like i350.  This patch removes the entries for i210/i211 in the
get_invariants function which was setting them for 32. This ensures that
they will get the default value which is the correct one.
