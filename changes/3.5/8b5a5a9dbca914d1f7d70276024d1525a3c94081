cgroup: deprecate remount option changes

This patch marks the following features for deprecation.

* Rebinding subsys by remount: Never reached useful state - only works
  on empty hierarchies.

* release_agent update by remount: release_agent itself will be
  replaced with conventional fsnotify notification.

v2: Lennart pointed out that "name=" is necessary for mounts w/o any
    controller attached.  Drop "name=" deprecation.
