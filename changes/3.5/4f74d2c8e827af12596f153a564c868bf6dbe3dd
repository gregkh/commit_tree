vm: remove 'nr_accounted' calculations from the unmap_vmas() interfaces

The VM accounting makes no sense at this level, and half of the callers
didn't ever actually use the end result.  The only time we want to
unaccount the memory is when we actually remove the vma, so do the
accounting at that point instead.

This simplifies the interfaces (no need to pass down that silly page
counter to functions that really don't care), and also makes it much
more obvious what is actually going on: we do vm_[un]acct_memory() when
adding or removing the vma, not on random page walking.
