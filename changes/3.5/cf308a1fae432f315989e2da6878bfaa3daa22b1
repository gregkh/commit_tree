netfilter: add xt_hmark target for hash-based skb marking

The target allows you to create rules in the "raw" and "mangle" tables
which set the skbuff mark by means of hash calculation within a given
range. The nfmark can influence the routing method (see "Use netfilter
MARK value as routing key") and can also be used by other subsystems to
change their behaviour.
