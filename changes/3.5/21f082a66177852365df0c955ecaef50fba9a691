mfd: ab8500-core should depend on MFD_DB8500_PRCMU

A recent move to eliminate excess historical baggage from ab8500 core
code resulting in errors when building with x86_64 allmodconfig:

include/linux/mfd/db8500-prcmu.h:685:20: note: previous definition of 'prcmu_ac_sleep_req' was here

Problem:
When CONFIG_AB8500_CORE is set, building ab8500-core.c and
!(CONFIG_UX500_SOC_DB8500 | CONFIG_MFD_DB8500_PRCMU), both db8500-prcmu.h
and dbx500-prcmu.h take it upon themselves to _both_ create 'return 0'
inline functions for the following:

prcmu_abb_read()
prcmu_abb_write()
prcmu_config_clkout()
prcmu_ac_wake_req()
prcmu_ac_sleep_req()

Solution:
Depend on MFD_DB8500_PRCMU, which in turn depends on UX500_SOC_DB8500.
