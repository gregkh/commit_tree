printk: fix regression in SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR

Commit 7ff9554bb578ba02166071d2d487b7fc7d860d62 (printk: convert
byte-buffer to variable-length record buffer) introduced a regression
by accidentally removing a "break" statement from inside the big
switch in printk's do_syslog().  The symptom of this bug is that the
"dmesg -C" command doesn't only clear the kernel's log buffer; it also
disables console logging.

This patch (as1561) fixes the regression by adding the missing
"break".
