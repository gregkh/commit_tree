sched/x86: Calculate booted cores after construction of sibling_mask

Commit 316ad248307fb ("sched/x86: Rewrite set_cpu_sibling_map()")
broke the booted_cores accounting.

The problem is that the booted_cores accounting needs all the
sibling links set up. So restore the second loop and add a comment as
to why its needed.

On qemu booted with -smp sockets=1,cores=2,threads=2;
Before:
 $ grep cores /proc/cpuinfo
 cpu cores       : 2
 cpu cores       : 1
 cpu cores       : 4
 cpu cores       : 3

With the patch:
 $ grep cores /proc/cpuinfo
 cpu cores       : 2
 cpu cores       : 2
 cpu cores       : 2
 cpu cores       : 2
