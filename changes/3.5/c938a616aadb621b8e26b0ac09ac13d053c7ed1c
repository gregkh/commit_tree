IB/core: Add raw packet QP type

IB_QPT_RAW_PACKET allows applications to build a complete packet,
including L2 headers, when sending; on the receive side, the HW will
not strip any headers.

This QP type is designed for userspace direct access to Ethernet; for
example by applications that do TCP/IP themselves.  Only processes
with the NET_RAW capability are allowed to create raw packet QPs (the
name "raw packet QP" is supposed to suggest an analogy to AF_PACKET /
SOL_RAW sockets).
