mac80211: sanity check for null SSID

While associated we should never have empty SSID, but life can be full
of surprises, and is allways better to print a warning than crash.

Before memcpy() in ieee80211_probereq_get() check ssid_len instead of
ssid pointer, sice pointer it always passed by "ssidie + 2" expression
to send probe functions, so practically never can be NULL.
