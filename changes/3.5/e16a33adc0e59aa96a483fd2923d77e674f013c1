[SCSI] hpsa: refine interrupt handler locking for greater concurrency

Use spinlocks with finer granularity in the submission and
completion paths to allow concurrent execution for multiple
reply queues.  In particular, do not hold a spin lock while
submitting a request to the device, nor during most of the
interrupt handler.
