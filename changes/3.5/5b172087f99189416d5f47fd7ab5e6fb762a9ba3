c/r: procfs: add arg_start/end, env_start/end and exit_code members to /proc/$pid/stat

We would like to have an ability to restore command line arguments and
program environment pointers but first we need to obtain them somehow.
Thus we put these values into /proc/$pid/stat.  The exit_code is needed to
restore zombie tasks.
