net/dcb: Add an optional max rate attribute

Although not specified in 8021Qaz spec, it could be useful to enable drivers
whose HW supports setting a rate limit for an ETS TC. This patch adds this
optional attribute to DCB netlink. To use it, drivers should implement and
register the callbacks ieee_setmaxrate and ieee_getmaxrate. The units are 64
bits long and specified in Kbps to enable usage over both slow and very fast
networks.
