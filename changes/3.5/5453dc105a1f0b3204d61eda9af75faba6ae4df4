wlcore/wl12xx: use a single memory config and reset if using wl127x

Instead of having two memory configuration sets, one for wl127x and
one for wl128x, we can use only one which should be correctly set by
the lower driver.

The wl12xx driver now uses the wl128x memory config by default but
changes it when if it identifies the wl127x chips.
