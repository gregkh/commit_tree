e1000e: Correct link check logic for 82571 serdes

SYNCH bit and IV bit of RXCW register are sticky. Before examining these bits,
RXCW should be read twice to filter out one-time false events and have correct
values for these bits. Incorrect values of these bits in link check logic can
cause weird link stability issues if auto-negotiation fails.
