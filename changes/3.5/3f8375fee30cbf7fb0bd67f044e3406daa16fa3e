tipc: introduce publication lists struct

There is currently a single list that is containing both cluster-scope and
zone-scope publications, and the list count is a separate free floating
variable.  Create a struct to bind the count to the list, and to pave
the way for factoring out the publications into zone/cluster/node scope.

The current "publ_root" most matches what will be the cluster scope
list, so it is named accordingly in this commit.
