netfilter: remove ip_queue support

This patch removes ip_queue support which was marked as obsolete
years ago. The nfnetlink_queue modules provides more advanced
user-space packet queueing mechanism.

This patch also removes capability code included in SELinux that
refers to ip_queue. Otherwise, we break compilation.

Several warning has been sent regarding this to the mailing list
in the past month without anyone rising the hand to stop this
with some strong argument.
