cgroup: make sure that decisions in __css_put are atomic

__css_put is using atomic_dec on the ref count, and then
looking at the ref count to make decisions.  This is prone
to races, as someone else may decrement ref count between
our decrement and our decision.  Instead, we should base our
decisions on the value that we decremented the ref count to.

(This results in an actual race on Google's kernel which I
haven't been able to reproduce on the upstream kernel.  Having
said that, it's still incorrect by inspection).
