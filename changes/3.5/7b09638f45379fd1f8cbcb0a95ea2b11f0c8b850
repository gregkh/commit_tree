drm/i915: Always flush tiling changes before accessing through the GTT

As we defer updating the fence register from set-tiling to the point of
use, we need to declare every access through the GTT as either fenced or
unfenced.

This patches fixes an old bug in the execbuffer relocation processing
which could conceivably be hit by a pathological userspace.
