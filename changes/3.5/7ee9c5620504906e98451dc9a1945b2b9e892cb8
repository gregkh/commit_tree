blkcg: let blkio_group point to blkio_cgroup directly

Currently, blkg points to the associated blkcg via its css_id.  This
unnecessarily complicates dereferencing blkcg.  Let blkg hold a
reference to the associated blkcg and point directly to it and disable
css_id on blkio_subsys.

This change requires splitting blkiocg_destroy() into
blkiocg_pre_destroy() and blkiocg_destroy() so that all blkg's can be
destroyed and all the blkcg references held by them dropped during
cgroup removal.
