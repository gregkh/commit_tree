rcu: Move PREEMPT_RCU preemption to switch_to() invocation

Currently, PREEMPT_RCU readers are enqueued upon entry to the scheduler.
This is inefficient because enqueuing is required only if there is a
context switch, and entry to the scheduler does not guarantee a context
switch.

The commit therefore moves the enqueuing to immediately precede the
call to switch_to() from the scheduler.
