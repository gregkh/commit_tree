ARM: tegra: Add Tegra AHB driver

Tegra AHB Bus conforms to the AMBA Specification (Rev 2.0) Advanced
High-performance Bus (AHB) architecture.

The AHB Arbiter controls AHB bus master arbitration. This effectively
forms a second level of arbitration for access to the memory
controller through the AHB Slave Memory device. The AHB pre-fetch
logic can be configured to enhance performance for devices doing
sequential access. Each AHB master is assigned to either the high or
low priority bin. Both Tegra20/30 have this AHB bus.

Some of configuration params could be passed from DT too if needed.
