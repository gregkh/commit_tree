HID: hid-multitouch: fix wrong protocol detection

The previous implementation introduced a randomness in the splitting
of the different touches reported by the device. This version is more
robust as we don't rely on hi->input->absbit, but on our own structure.

This also prepares hid-multitouch to better support Win8 devices.
