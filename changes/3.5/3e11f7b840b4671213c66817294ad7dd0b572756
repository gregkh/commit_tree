gpio/generic: initialize basic_mmio_gpio shadow variables properly

It fixes the issue in gpio-generic that commit fb14921 (gpio/mxc: add
missing initialization of basic_mmio_gpio shadow variables) manged to
fix in gpio-mxc driver, so that other platform specific drivers do not
suffer from the same problem over and over again.

Changes since v1:
* Turn the last parameter of bgpio_init() "bool big_endian" into
  "unsigned long flags" and give those really quirky hardwares a
  chance to tell that reg_set and reg_dir are unreadable.
