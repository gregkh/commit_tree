HID: Add device group to modalias

HID devices are only partially presented to userland.  Hotplugged
devices emit events containing a modalias based on the basic bus,
vendor and product entities. However, in practise a hid device can
depend on details such as a single usb interface or a particular item
in a report descriptor.

This patch adds a device group to the hid device id, and broadcasts it
using uevent and the device modalias.  The module alias generation is
modified to match. As a consequence, a device with a non-zero group
will be processed by the corresponding group driver instead of by the
generic hid driver.
