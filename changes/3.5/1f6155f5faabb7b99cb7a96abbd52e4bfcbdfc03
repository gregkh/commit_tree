USB: bcma: suspend() only takes one argument now

We changed the API here a couple months ago.  It suspend() only takes
one argument now.  GCC complains about this:

    drivers/usb/host/bcma-hcd.c:320:2: warning: initialization from
        incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
    drivers/usb/host/bcma-hcd.c:320:2: warning: (near initialization
        for ‘bcma_hcd_driver.suspend’) [enabled by default]
