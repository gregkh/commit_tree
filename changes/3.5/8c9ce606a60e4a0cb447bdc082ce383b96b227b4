xen/blkback: Copy id field when doing BLKIF_DISCARD.

We weren't copying the id field so when we sent the response
back to the frontend (especially with a 64-bit host and 32-bit
guest), we ended up using a random value. This lead to the
frontend crashing as it would try to pass to __blk_end_request_all
a NULL 'struct request' (b/c it would use the 'id' to find the
proper 'struct request' in its shadow array) and end up crashing:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 000000e4
IP: [<c0646d4c>] __blk_end_request_all+0xc/0x40
.. snip..
EIP is at __blk_end_request_all+0xc/0x40
.. snip..
 [<ed95db72>] blkif_interrupt+0x172/0x330 [xen_blkfront]

This fixes the bug by passing in the proper id for the response.
