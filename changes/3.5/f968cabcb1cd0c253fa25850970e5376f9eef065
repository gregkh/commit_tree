ARM: OMAP: Fix MMC_OMAP build when only MMC_OMAP_HS is selected

If CONFIG_MMC_OMAP is not set and CONFIG_MMC_OMAP_HS is set,
we can get error: redefinition of `omap242x_init_mmc' error.

Fix it by removing MMC_OMAP_HS from MMC_OMAP ifdefs as they do
not depend on each other.

While at it, also prettify the formatting a bit.
