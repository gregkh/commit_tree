ipv6: ip6_fragment() should check CHECKSUM_PARTIAL

Quoting Tore Anderson from :

If the allfrag feature has been set on a host route (due to an ICMPv6
Packet Too Big received indicating a MTU of less than 1280),
TCP SYN/ACK packets to that destination appears to get an incorrect
TCP checksum. This in turn means they are thrown away as invalid.

In the case of an IPv4 client behind a link with a MTU of less than
1260, accessing an IPv6 server through a stateless translator,
this means that the client can only download a single large file
from the server, because once it is in the server's routing cache
with the allfrag feature set, new TCP connections can no longer
be established.

It appears ip6_fragment() doesn't handle CHECKSUM_PARTIAL properly.

As network drivers are not prepared to fetch correct transport header, a
safe fix is to call skb_checksum_help() before fragmenting packet.
