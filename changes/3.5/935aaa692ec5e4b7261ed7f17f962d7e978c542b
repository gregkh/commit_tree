drm/i915: drop gtt slowpath

With the proper prefault, it's extremely unlikely that we fall back
to the gtt slowpath.

So just kill it and use the shmem_pwrite path as fallback.

To further clean up the code, move the preparatory gem calls into the
respective pwrite functions. This way the gtt_fast->shmem fallback
is much more obvious.
