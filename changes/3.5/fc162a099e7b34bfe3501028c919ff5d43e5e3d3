[media] V4L: Add camera 3A lock control

The V4L2_CID_3A_LOCK bitmask control allows applications to pause
or resume the automatic exposure, focus and wite balance adjustments.
It can be used, for example, to lock the 3A adjustments right before
a still image is captured, for pre-focus, etc.
The applications can control each of the algorithms independently,
through a corresponding control bit, if driver allows that.
