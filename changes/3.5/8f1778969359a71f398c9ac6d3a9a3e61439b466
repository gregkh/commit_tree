tipc: Enhance error checking of published names

Consolidates validation of scope and name sequence range values into
a single routine where it applies both to local name publications
and to name publications issued by other nodes in the network. This
change means that the scope value for non-local publications is now
validated and the name sequence range for local publications is now
validated only once. Additionally, a publication attempt that fails
validation now creates an entry in the system log file only if debugging
capabilities have been enabled; this prevents the system log from being
cluttered up with messages caused by a defective application or network
node.
