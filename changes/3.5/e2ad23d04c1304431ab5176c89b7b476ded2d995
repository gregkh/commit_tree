intel-iommu: Add device info into list before doing context mapping

Add device info into list before doing context mapping, because device
info will be used by iommu_enable_dev_iotlb(). Without it, ATS won't get
enabled as it should be.

ATS, while a dubious decision from a security point of view, can be very
important for performance.
