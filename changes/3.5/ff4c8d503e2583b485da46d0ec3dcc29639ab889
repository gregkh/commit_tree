cgroup: move cgroup_clear_directory() call out of cgroup_populate_dir()

cgroup_populate_dir() currently clears all files and then repopulate
the directory; however, the clearing part is only useful when it's
called from cgroup_remount().  Relocate the invocation to
cgroup_remount().

This is to prepare for further cgroup file handling updates.
