Input: evdev - properly handle read/write with count 0

According to the standard count 0 is special - no IO should happen but we
can check error conditions (device gone away, etc), and return 0 if there
are no errors. We used to return -EINVAL instead and we also could return 0
if an event was "stolen" by another thread.
