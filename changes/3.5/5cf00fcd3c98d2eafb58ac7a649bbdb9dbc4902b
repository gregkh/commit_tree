md/raid10: collect some geometry fields into a dedicated structure.

We will shortly be adding reshape support for RAID10 which will
require it having 2 concurrent geometries (before and after).
To make that easier, collect most geometry fields into 'struct geom'
and access them from there.  Then we will more easily be able to add
a second set of fields.

Note that 'copies' is not in this struct and so cannot be changed.
There is little need to change this number and doing so is a lot
more difficult as it requires reallocating more things.
So leave it out for now.
