UBI: rename si to ai

After re-naming the 'struct ubi_scan_info' we should adjust all variables
named 'si' to something else, because 'si' stands for "scanning info".
Let's rename it to 'ai' which stands for "attaching info" which is
a bit more consistent and has the same length, which makes re-naming easy.
