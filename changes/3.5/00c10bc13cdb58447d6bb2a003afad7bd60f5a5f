pidns: make killed children autoreap

Force SIGCHLD handling to SIG_IGN so that signals are not generated and so
that the children autoreap.  This increases the parallelize and in general
the speed of network namespace shutdown.

Note self reaping childrean can exist past zap_pid_ns_processess but they
will all be reaped before we allow the pid namespace init task with pid ==
1 to be reaped.
