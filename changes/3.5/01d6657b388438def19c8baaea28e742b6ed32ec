macvtap: zerocopy: set SKBTX_DEV_ZEROCOPY only when skb is built successfully

Current the SKBTX_DEV_ZEROCOPY is set unconditionally after
zerocopy_sg_from_iovec(), this would lead NULL pointer when macvtap
fails to build zerocopy skb because destructor_arg was not
initialized. Solve this by set this flag after the skb were built
successfully.
