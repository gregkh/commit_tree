md: support re-add of recovering devices.

We currently only allow a device to be re-added if it appear to be
in-sync.  This is overly restrictive as it may be desirable to re-add
a device that is in the middle of recovery.

So remove the test for "InSync" - the test on rdev->raid_disk is
sufficient to ensure that the re-add will succeed.
