dmaengine i.MX SDMA: do not depend on grouped clocks

the current i.MX clock support groups together unrelated clocks
to a single clock which is then used by the driver. This can't
be accomplished with the generic clock framework so we instead
request the individual clocks in the driver. For i.MX there are
generally three different clocks:

ipg: bus clock (needed to access registers)
ahb: dma relevant clock, sometimes referred to as hclk in the datasheet
per: bit clock, pixel clock

This patch changes the driver to request the individual clocks.
Currently all clk_get will get the same clock until the SoCs
are converted to the generic clock framework
