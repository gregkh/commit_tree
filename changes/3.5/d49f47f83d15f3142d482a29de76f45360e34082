s390/pfault: add sanity check

If the task that was found on an initial interrupt doesn't match the
current task execute a WARN_ON_ONCE() and don't put the task to sleep.

When this happened something went wrong between the interface of the
hypervisor and the kernel. In such a case keep the tasks alive to
avoid a hanging system.
