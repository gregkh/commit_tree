USB: gadget: ci13xx_pci: remove unneeded check in ci13xxx_pci_probe()

As pointed out by Dan Carpenter, the check for NULL for the id variable
is no longer needed, especially as we just dereferenced it a few lines
earlier, causing an oops if it really was NULL.

This was caused by 62bb84ed0e4d: "usb: gadget: ci13xxx: convert to
platform device".
