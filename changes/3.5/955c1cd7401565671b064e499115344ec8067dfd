mm/page_alloc.c: remove pageblock_default_order()

This has always been broken: one version takes an unsigned int and the
other version takes no arguments.  This bug was hidden because one
version of set_pageblock_order() was a macro which doesn't evaluate its
argument.

Simplify it all and remove pageblock_default_order() altogether.
