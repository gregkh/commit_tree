brlocks/lglocks: API cleanups

lglocks and brlocks are currently generated with some complicated macros
in lglock.h.  But there's no reason to not just use common utility
functions and put all the data into a common data structure.

In preparation, this patch changes the API to look more like normal
function calls with pointers, not magic macros.

The patch is rather large because I move over all users in one go to keep
it bisectable.  This impacts the VFS somewhat in terms of lines changed.
But no actual behaviour change.
