target: Handle ATA_16 passthrough for pSCSI backend devices

The cdrecord uses ATA_PASS_THROUGH_16 command while burning CDs
with a SATA CD-ROM. This patch adds support to it so that PSCSI
CD-ROM passthrough works with the cdrecord.

(nab: Add !passthrough check to prevent non pSCSI backends from ATA_16)
