kconfig: Add error handling to KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG

- Only try to read the file specified if KCONFIG_ALL_CONFIG is set to
  something other than the empty string or "1".

- Don't use stat to check the name passed to conf_read_simple so that
  zconf_fopen can find the file in the current directory or in SRCTREE
  removing a extremely source of confusing failure, where KCONFIG_ALL_CONFIG
  was not interpreted with respect to the directory make was called in.

- If conf_read_simple fails complain clearly and stop processing.
  Allowing the simple debugging of typos.

- Clearly document the behavior so it is clear to users which
  values are treated as flags and which values are treated as
  filenames.
