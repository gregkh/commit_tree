pinctrl: add pinctrl_provide_dummies interface for platforms to use

Add a interface pinctrl_provide_dummies for platform to indicate
whether it needs use pinctrl dummy state.

ChangeLog v3->v4:
* remove dummy gpio support in pinctrl subsystem.
  Let gpio driver decide whether it wants to use pinctrl gpio mux
  function.
ChangeLog v2->v3:
* Also changed the missed pinctrl gpio APIs in v1.
ChangeLog v1->v2:
* Based on sascha's suggestion, drop using kconfig since it will hide
  pinctrl errors on all other boards.
  See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/18/282
  It seemed both Linus and Stephen agreed with this way, so i'm ok
  with it too.
* Add dummy gpio support.
  pinctrl gpio in the same situation as state.
* Patch name changed.
  Original is pinctrl: handle dummy state in core.
* Split removing old dt dummy interface into a separate patch
