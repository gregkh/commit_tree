batman-adv: fix skb->data assignment

skb_linearize(skb) possibly rearranges the skb internal data and then changes
the skb->data pointer value. For this reason any other pointer in the code that
was assigned skb->data before invoking skb_linearise(skb) must be re-assigned.

In the current tt_query message handling code this is not done and therefore, in
case of skb linearization, the pointer used to handle the packet header ends up
in pointing to free'd memory.
