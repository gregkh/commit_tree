ASoC: da7210: Minor improvements and a bugfix

This patch improves playback quality for few sample rates like 8000 and
11025 Hz.

This also fixes an issue observed during testing of pll slave mode. Due
to the issue, on some rare occasions there was no sound output for first
time playback after system boot, though all subsequent playbacks were
fine. It was mainly because of the sequence in which SRM bit was
enabled.
