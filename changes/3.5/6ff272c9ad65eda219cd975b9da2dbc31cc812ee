codel: use u16 field instead of 31bits for rec_inv_sqrt

David pointed out gcc might generate poor code with 31bit fields.

Using u16 is more than enough and permits a better code output.

Also make the code intent more readable using constants, fixed point arithmetic
not being trivial for everybody.
