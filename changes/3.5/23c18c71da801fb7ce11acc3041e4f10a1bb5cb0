drm/i915: fixup in-line clflushing on bit17 swizzled bos

The issue is that with inline clflushing the clflushing isn't properly
swizzled. Fix this by
- always clflushing entire 128 byte chunks and
- unconditionally flush before writes when swizzling a given page.
  We could be clever and check whether we pwrite a partial 128 byte
  chunk instead of a partial cacheline, but I've figured that's not
  worth it.

Now the usual approach is to fold this into the original patch series, but
I've opted against this because
- this fixes a corner case only very old userspace relies on and
- I'd like to not invalidate all the testing the pwrite rewrite has gotten.

This fixes the regression notice by tests/gem_tiled_partial_prite_pread
from i-g-t. Unfortunately it doesn't fix the issues with partial pwrites to
tiled buffers on bit17 swizzling machines. But that is also broken without
the pwrite patches, so likely a different issue (or a problem with the
testcase).

v2: Simplify the patch by dropping the overly clever partial write
logic for swizzled pages.
