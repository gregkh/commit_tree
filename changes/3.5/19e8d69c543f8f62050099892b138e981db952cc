net: replace percpu_xxx funcs with this_cpu_xxx or __this_cpu_xxx

percpu_xxx funcs are duplicated with this_cpu_xxx funcs, so replace
them for further code clean up.

And in preempt safe scenario, __this_cpu_xxx funcs may has a bit
better performance since __this_cpu_xxx has no redundant
preempt_enable/preempt_disable on some architectures.
