Btrfs: don't count I/O statistic read errors for missing devices

It is normal behaviour of the low level btrfs function btrfs_map_bio()
to complete a bio with -EIO if the device is missing, instead of just
preventing the bio creation in an earlier step.
This used to cause I/O statistic read error increments and annoying
printk_ratelimited messages. This commit fixes the issue.
