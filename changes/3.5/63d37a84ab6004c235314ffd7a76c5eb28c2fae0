vfs: umount_tree() might be called on subtree that had never made it

__mnt_make_shortterm() in there undoes the effect of __mnt_make_longterm()
we'd done back when we set ->mnt_ns non-NULL; it should not be done to
vfsmounts that had never gone through commit_tree() and friends.  Kudos to
lczerner for catching that one...
