x86/reboot: Reduce to a single DMI table for reboot quirks

This commit reduces the X86_32 reboot_dmi_table and the X86_64
pci_reboot_dmi_table into a single table with a single set of
functions (e.g., only 1 call to core_initcall).

The table entries that use set_bios_reboot are grouped together
inside a #define CONFIG_X86_32 block.

Note that there's a single entry that uses set_kbd_reboot, which
used to be available only on X86_32.  This commit moves that
entry outside the X86_32 block because it seems it never should
have been in there.  There's multiple places in reboot.c that
assume KBD is valid regardless of X86_32/X86_64.
