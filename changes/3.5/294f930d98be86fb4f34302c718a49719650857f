staging: comedi: use module_comedi_driver

Convert the refactored comedi drivers to use the module_comedi_driver()
macro which makes the code smaller and a bit simpler.

In the process, rename the driver variables from driver_* to *_driver,
as is more typical with other subsystems, and make sure they are all
static.
