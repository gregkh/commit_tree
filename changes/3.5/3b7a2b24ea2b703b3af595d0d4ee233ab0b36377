drm/radeon: rework fence handling, drop fence list v7

Using 64bits fence sequence we can directly compare sequence
number to know if a fence is signaled or not. Thus the fence
list became useless, so does the fence lock that mainly
protected the fence list.

Things like ring.ready are no longer behind a lock, this should
be ok as ring.ready is initialized once and will only change
when facing lockup. Worst case is that we return an -EBUSY just
after a successfull GPU reset, or we go into wait state instead
of returning -EBUSY (thus delaying reporting -EBUSY to fence
wait caller).

v2: Remove left over comment, force using writeback on cayman and
    newer, thus not having to suffer from possibly scratch reg
    exhaustion
v3: Rebase on top of change to uint64 fence patch
v4: Change DCE5 test to force write back on cayman and newer but
    also any APU such as PALM or SUMO family
v5: Rebase on top of new uint64 fence patch
v6: Just break if seq doesn't change any more. Use radeon_fence
    prefix for all function names. Even if it's now highly optimized,
    try avoiding polling to often.
v7: We should never poll the last_seq from the hardware without
    waking the sleeping threads, otherwise we might lose events.
