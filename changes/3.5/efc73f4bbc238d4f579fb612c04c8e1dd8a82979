net: Fix memory leak - vlan_info struct

In driver reload test there is a memory leak.
The structure vlan_info was not freed when the driver was removed.
It was not released since the nr_vids var is one after last vlan was removed.
The nr_vids is one, since vlan zero is added to the interface when the interface
is being set, but the vlan zero is not deleted at unregister.
Fix - delete vlan zero when we unregister the device.
