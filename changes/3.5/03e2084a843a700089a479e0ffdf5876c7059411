ath6kl: check for sband existence when creating scan cmd

The patch "ath6kl: support fw reporting phy capabilities" gave the
firmware the ability to disable certain wiphy supported bands. Check if
this is the case in ath6kl_wmi_beginscan_cmd to avoid dereferencing a
NULL pointer.

kvalo: change the patch so that there's no code between declarations
