c/r: prctl: extend PR_SET_MM to set up more mm_struct entries

During checkpoint we dump whole process memory to a file and the dump
includes process stack memory.  But among stack data itself, the stack
carries additional parameters such as command line arguments, environment
data and auxiliary vector.

So when we do restore procedure and once we've restored stack data itself
we need to setup mm_struct::arg_start/end, env_start/end, so restored
process would be able to find command line arguments and environment data
it had at checkpoint time.  The same applies to auxiliary vector.

For this reason additional PR_SET_MM_(ARG_START | ARG_END | ENV_START |
ENV_END | AUXV) codes are introduced.
