dma/amba-pl08x: check for terminal count status only

For some reason I can't figure out we're reading the PL080_INT_STATUS
register instead of PL080_TC_STATUS when checking for the terminal
count. The PL080_INT_STATUS is a logical OR between the error and
terminal count status register and may not report what we want it
to, especially if there is an error and a terminal count at the same
time and the former is not lowered in time for the check in the TC
register. Make sure we read what we're actually interested in.
