ceph: messenger: update "to" in read_partial() caller

read_partial() always increases whatever "to" value is supplied by
adding the requested size to it, and that's the only thing it does
with that pointed-to value.

Do that pointer advance in the caller (and then only when the
updated value will be subsequently used), and change the "to"
parameter to be an in-only and non-pointer value.
