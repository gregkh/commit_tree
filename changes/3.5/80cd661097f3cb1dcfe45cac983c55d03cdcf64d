wlcore/wl12xx: move identify firmware function to a lower driver op

Different chip families have different firmware versions, so we need
to identify the firmware to enable quirks, reject the used version
etc. in the lower drivers.  This commit turns the fw_ver_quirks
function into an identify_fw operation.
