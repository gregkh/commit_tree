GFS2: Remove unused argument from gfs2_internal_read

gfs2_internal_read accepts an unused ra_state argument, left over from
when we did readahead on the rindex. Since there are currently no plans
to add back this readahead, this patch removes the ra_state parameter
and updates the functions which call gfs2_internal_read accordingly.
