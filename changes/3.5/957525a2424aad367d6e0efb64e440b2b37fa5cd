target: Remove transport_do_task_sg_chain() and associated detritus

Now that all fabrics are converted over to using se_cmd->t_data_sg
directly, we can drop the task sg chaining support.  With the modern
memory allocation in target core, task sg chaining is needless
overhead -- we would split up the main cmd sglist into pieces, and
then splice those pieces back together instead of just using the
original list directly.
