target: remove target_get_task_cdb

Now that tasks are always the same size as the command there is no need
to rewrite a CDB in common code.  Notw that we keep the separately allocated
CDB in the pscsi and stgt backends for now, to easy reintroducing any
command splitting local to these backends if nessecary.
