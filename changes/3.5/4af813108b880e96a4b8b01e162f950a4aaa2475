[media] s5p-fimc: Add support for Exynos4x12 FIMC-LITE

This patch adds driver for FIMC-LITE camera host interface. This new IP
differs from the regular FIMC IP in that it doesn't have input DMA,
scaler and color space conversion support. So it just plain camera host
interface for MIPI-CSI2 and ITU-R interfaces. For the serial bus support
it interworks with MIPI-CSIS and the exisiting s5p-csis driver.
The FIMC-LITE and MIPI-CSIS drivers can also be reused in the Exynos5
SoC series.
