sparc: Increase portability of strncpy_from_user() implementation.

Hide details of maximum user address calculation in a new

Provide little-endian implementation in find_zero(), which should work
but can probably be improved.

Abstrace alignment check behind IS_UNALIGNED() macro.

Kill double-semicolon, noticed by David Howells.
