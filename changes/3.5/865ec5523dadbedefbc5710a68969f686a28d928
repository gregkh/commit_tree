fq_codel: should use qdisc backlog as threshold

codel_should_drop() logic allows a packet being not dropped if queue
size is under max packet size.

In fq_codel, we have two possible backlogs : The qdisc global one, and
the flow local one.

The meaningful one for codel_should_drop() should be the global backlog,
not the per flow one, so that thin flows can have a non zero drop/mark
probability.
