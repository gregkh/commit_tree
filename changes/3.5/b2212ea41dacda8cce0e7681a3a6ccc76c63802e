sh64: Kill off unused trap_no/error_code from thread_struct.

While the trap number and error code are passed around for debugging
purposes, this occurs wholly independently of the thread struct values.
These values were never part of the sigcontext ABI and are thus never
passed anywhere, so we can just kill them off across the board.
