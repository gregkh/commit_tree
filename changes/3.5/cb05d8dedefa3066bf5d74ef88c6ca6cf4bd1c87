drm/i915: fix up ivb plane 3 pageflips

Or at least plug another gapping hole. Apparrently hw desingers only
moved the bit field, but did not bother ot re-enumerate the planes
when adding support for a 3rd pipe.

Discovered by i-g-t/flip_test.

This may or may not fix the reference bugzilla, because that one
smells like we have still larger fish to fry.

v2: Fixup the impossible case to catch programming errors, noticed by
Chris Wilson.
