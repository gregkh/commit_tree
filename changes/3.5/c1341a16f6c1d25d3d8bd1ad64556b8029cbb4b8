[media] drivers: media: dvb: ddbridge: ddbridge-code: Remove unneeded include of version.h

The output of "make versioncheck" told us that the file
drivers/media/dvb/ddbridge/ddbridge-code.c has a incorrect include of
version.h:

linux/drivers/media/dvb/ddbridge/ddbridge-core.c: 34 linux/version.h not
needed.

After take a look in the code, we can agree to remove it.
