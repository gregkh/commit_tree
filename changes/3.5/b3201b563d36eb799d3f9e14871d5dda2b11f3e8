staging:iio:adc: Add SPEAr ADC driver

This patch implements the basic single data conversion support for
the SPEAr600 SoC ADC. The register layout of SPEAr600 differs a bit
from other SPEAr SoC variants (e.g. SPEAr3xx). These differences are
handled via DT compatible testing. Resulting in a multi-arch binary.

This driver is currently tested only on SPEAr600. Future patches may add
support for other SoC variants (SPEAr3xx) and features like software
buffer or DMA.
