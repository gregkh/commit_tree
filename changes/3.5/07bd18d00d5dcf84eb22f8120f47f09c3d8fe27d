asm/syscall.h: add syscall_get_arch

Adds a stub for a function that will return the AUDIT_ARCH_* value
appropriate to the supplied task based on the system call convention.

For audit's use, the value can generally be hard-coded at the
audit-site.  However, for other functionality not inlined into syscall
entry/exit, this makes that information available.  seccomp_filter is
the first planned consumer and, as such, the comment indicates a tie to
CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER.
