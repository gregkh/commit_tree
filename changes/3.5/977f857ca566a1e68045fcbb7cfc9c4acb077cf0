PCI: move mutex locking out of pci_dev_reset function

The intent of git commit 6fbf9e7a90862988c278462d85ce9684605a52b2
"PCI: Introduce __pci_reset_function_locked to be used when holding
device_lock." was to have a non-locking function that would call
pci_dev_reset function.

But it fell short of that by just probing and not actually reseting
the device. To make that work we need a way to move the lock
around device_lock to not be in pci_dev_reset (as the caller of
__pci_reset_function_locked already holds said lock). We do this by
renaming pci_dev_reset to __pci_dev_reset and bubbling said mutex out
of __pci_dev_reset to pci_dev_reset (a wrapper around __pci_dev_reset).
The __pci_reset_function_locked  can now call __pci_dev_reset without
having to worry about the dead-lock.
