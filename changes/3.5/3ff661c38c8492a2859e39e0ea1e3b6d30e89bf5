net: rtnetlink notify events for FDB NTF_SELF adds and deletes

It is useful to be able to monitor for FDB events in user space.
This patch adds support to generate netlink events when a change
is made to a device supporting the FDB ops.

This brings embedded switches inline with the SW net/bridge which
triggers events on FDB updates as well.
