ARM: dt: tegra seaboard: add i2c devices

Add the known i2c devices on seaboard to the i2c table.

Also rename the temperature sensor device node, and mark it as a nct1008
instead of an adt7461 (which it is -- the chips are compatible though).

[swarren: Removed isl29018 from patch; it's already there now. Fixed
 interrupts properties now that Tegra GPIO is an interrupt controller.
 Moved smart-battery to the correct I2C bus.]
