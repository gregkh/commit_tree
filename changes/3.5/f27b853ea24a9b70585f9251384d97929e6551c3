[media] rc: Fix invalid free_region and/or free_irq on probe failure

fintek-cir, ite-cir and nuvoton-cir may try to free an I/O region
and/or IRQ handler that was never allocated after a failure in their
respective probe functions.  Add and use separate labels on the
failure path so they will do the right cleanup after each possible
point of failure.

Compile-tested only.
