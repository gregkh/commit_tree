s390/cpu: remove cpu "capabilities" sysfs attribute

It has been a big mistage to add the capabilities attribute to the
cpus in sysfs:
First the attribute only contains the cpu capability of primary cpus,
which however is not necessarily (or better: unlikely) the type of
cpu the kernel runs on, which is typically an IFL.
In addition all information that is necessary is available in
/proc/sysinfo already. So this attribute partially duplicated
informations.
So programs should look into the sysinfo file to retrieve all
informations they are interested in.

Since with this kernel release also the powersavings cpu attributes
are removed this seems to be a good opportunity to remove another
broken interface.
