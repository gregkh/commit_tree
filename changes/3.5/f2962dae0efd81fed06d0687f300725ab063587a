s390/ccwgroup: introduce ccwgroup_create_dev

Add a new interface for drivers to create a group device. Via the old
interface ccwgroup_create_from_string we would create a virtual device
in a way that only the caller of this function would match and bind to.

Via the new ccwgroup_create_dev we stop playing games with the driver
core and directly set the driver of the new group device. For drivers
which have todo additional setup steps (like setting driver_data)
provide a new setup driver callback.
