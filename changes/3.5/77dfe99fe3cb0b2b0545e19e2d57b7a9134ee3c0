rbd: store snapshot id instead of index

When a device was open at a snapshot, and snapshots were deleted or
added, data from the wrong snapshot could be read. Instead of
assuming the snap context is constant, store the actual snap id when
the device is initialized, and rely on the OSDs to signal an error
if we try reading from a snapshot that was deleted.
