x86, cpufeature: Rename X86_FEATURE_DTS to X86_FEATURE_DTHERM

It makes sense to label "Digital Thermal Sensor" as "DTS", but
unfortunately the string "dts" was already used for "Debug Store", and
/proc/cpuinfo is a user space ABI.

Therefore, rename this to "dtherm".

This conflict went into mainline via the hwmon tree without any x86
maintainer ack, and without any kind of hint in the subject.
