mac80211: Take into account TSF adjustment latency in Toffset setpoint

When testing mesh synchronization we observed a global TSF slowdown that
was dependent on the number of synchronized mesh stations.  This seems
to be caused by the TSF adjustment (read/write) latency.

Adding a small margin to the Toffset setpoint solved the problem.
