ARM: OMAP2: Overo: init I2C before MMC to fix MMC suspend/resume failure

In order for suspend/resume dependencies to work correctly, I2C has to
be initialized (more specifically, registered with the driver core)
before MMC.  Without this, the MMC driver fails to adjust the VMMC
regulator (using i2c writes) during the suspend path.

Problem found testing suspend/resume on 3730/OveroSTORM platform.
