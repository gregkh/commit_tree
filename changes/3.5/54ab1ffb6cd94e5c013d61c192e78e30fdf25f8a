mac80211: refactor mesh peer initialization

This patch unifies the previous two paths toward mesh peer creation a
bit. It also fixes a bug where a peer's changing rates or HT mode
wouldn't register on leaving and then returning to the mesh with a sta
entry still present.

Also clean up locking and clear possibly stale ht cap.
