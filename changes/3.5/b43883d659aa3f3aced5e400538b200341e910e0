[media] omap3isp: Fix frame number propagation

When propagating the frame number through the pipeline, the frame number
must be incremented at frame start by the appropriate IRQ handler. This
was properly handled for the CSI2 and CCP2 receivers, but not when the
CCDC parallel interface is used.

ADD frame number incrementation to the HS/VS interrupt handler. As the
HS/VS interrupt is also generated for frames received by the CSI2 and
CCP2 receivers, remove explicit propagation handling from the serial
receivers.
