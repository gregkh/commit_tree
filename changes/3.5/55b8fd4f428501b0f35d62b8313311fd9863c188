SPEAr: clk: Add VCO-PLL Synthesizer clock

All SPEAr SoC's contain PLLs. Their Fout is derived based on following equations

- In normal mode
  vco = (2 * M[15:8] * Fin)/N

- In Dithered mode
  vco = (2 * M[15:0] * Fin)/(256 * N)

pll_rate = vco/2^p

vco and pll are very closely bound to each other,
"vco needs to program: mode, m & n" and "pll needs to program p",
both share common enable/disable logic and registers.

This patch adds in support for this type of clock.
