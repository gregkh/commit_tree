KVM: PPC: Rework wqp conditional code

On PowerPC, we sometimes use a waitqueue per core, not per thread,
so we can't always use the vcpu internal waitqueue.

This code has been generalized by Christoffer Dall recently, but
unfortunately broke compilation for PowerPC. At the time the helper
function is defined, struct kvm_vcpu is not declared yet, so we can't
dereference it.

This patch moves all logic into the generic inline function, at which
time we have all information necessary.
