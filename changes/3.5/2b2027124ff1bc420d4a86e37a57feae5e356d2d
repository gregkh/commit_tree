ixgbe: UTA table incorrectly programmed

The UTA table was being set to the functional equivalent of promiscuous
mode.  This was resulting in traffic from the virtual function being
flooded onto the wire and the PF device. This resulted in additional
overhead for VF traffic sent to the network and in the case of traffic
sent to the PF or another VF resulted in unwanted packets on the wire.

This was actually not the intended behavior. Now that we can program
the embedded switch correctly we can remove this snippit of code. Users
who want to support this should configure the FDB correctly using the
FDB ops.
