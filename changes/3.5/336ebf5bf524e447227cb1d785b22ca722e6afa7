tipc: Add routines for safe checking of node's network address

Introduces routines that test whether a given network address is
equal to a node's own network address or if it lies within the node's
own network cluster, and which work properly regardless of whether
the node is using the default network address <0.0.0> or a non-zero
network address that is assigned later on. In essence, these routines
ensure that address <0.0.0> is treated as an alias for "this node",
regardless of which network address the node is actually using.

Old users of the pre-existing more strict match in_own_cluster()
have been accordingly redirected to what is now called
in_own_cluster_exact() --- which does not extend matching to <0,0,0>.
