gpiolib/arches: Centralise bolierplate asm/gpio.h

Rather than requiring architectures that use gpiolib but don't have any
need to define anything custom to copy an asm/gpio.h provide a Kconfig
symbol which architectures must select in order to include gpio.h and
for other architectures just provide the trivial implementation directly.

This makes it much easier to do gpiolib updates and is also a step towards
making gpiolib APIs available on every architecture.

For architectures with existing boilerplate code leave a stub header in
place which warns on direct inclusion of asm/gpio.h and includes
linux/gpio.h to catch code that's doing this.  Direct inclusion of
asm/gpio.h has long been deprecated.
