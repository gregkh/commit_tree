vhost: use USER_DS in vhost_worker thread

On some architectures address spaces are set up in a way that this is
not necessary to work properly but on some others (like s390) it is.
Make sure we operate on the user address space to allow copy_xxx_user()
from the vhost_worker() thread by setting it explicitly before calling
use_mm() and revert it after unuse_mm().
