VFS: clean up and simplify getname_flags()

This removes a number of silly games around strncpy_from_user() in
do_getname(), and removes that helper function entirely.  We instead
make getname_flags() just use strncpy_from_user() properly directly.

Removing the wrapper function simplifies things noticeably, mostly
because we no longer play the unnecessary games with segments (x86
strncpy_from_user() no longer needs the hack), but also because the
empty path handling is just much more obvious.  The return value of
"strncpy_to_user()" is much more obvious than checking an odd error
return case from do_getname().

[ non-x86 architectures were notified of this change several weeks ago,
  since it is possible that they have copied the old broken x86
  strncpy_from_user. But nobody reacted, so .. See
