ASoC: core: Rework SOC_DOUBLE_R_SX_TLV add SOC_SINGLE_SX_TLV

Some codecs namely Cirrus Logic Codecs have a way of wrapping the dB scale around 0dB without 0dB being in the middle.

Rework of SOC_DOUBLE_R_SX_TLV to be more consistent with other asoc tlv macros.
Add single register macro : SOC_SINGLE_SX_TLV.
Use snd_soc_info_volsw for .info
Use snd_soc_get_volsw_sx, snd_soc_put_volsw_sx for single and double.

kcontrols for CS42L51 and CS42L73 are adjusted to these new TLV Macros.

The max value is determined by: (number of steps) +1 for 0dB +max from codec datasheet.
