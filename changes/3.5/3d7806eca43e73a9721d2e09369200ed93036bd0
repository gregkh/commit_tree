Btrfs: add btrfs_next_old_leaf

To make sense of the tree mod log, the backref walker not only needs
btrfs_search_old_slot, but it also called btrfs_next_leaf, which in turn was
calling btrfs_search_slot. This obviously didn't give the correct result.

This commit adds btrfs_next_old_leaf, a drop-in replacement for
btrfs_next_leaf with a time_seq parameter. If it is zero, it behaves exactly
like btrfs_next_leaf. If it is non-zero, it will use btrfs_search_old_slot
with this time_seq parameter.
