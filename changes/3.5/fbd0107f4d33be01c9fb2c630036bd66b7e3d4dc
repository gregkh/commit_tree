UBI: amend comments after all the renamings

This patch amends commentaries in scan.[ch] to match the new logic. Reminder -
we did the restructuring to prepare the code for adding the fastmap. This patch
also renames a couple of functions - it was too difficult to separate out that
change and I decided that it is not too bad to have it in the same patch with
commentaries changes.
