tracing: Use seq_*_private interface for some seq files

It's appropriate to use __seq_open_private interface to open
some of trace seq files, because it covers all steps we are
duplicating in tracing code - zallocating the iterator and
setting it as seq_file's private.

Using this for following files:
  trace
  available_filter_functions
  enabled_functions
