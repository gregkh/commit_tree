e1000e: Remove special case for 82573/82574 ASPM L1 disablement

For the 82573, ASPM L1 gets disabled wholesale so this special-case code
is not required. For the 82574 the previous patch does the same as for
the 82573, disabling L1 on the adapter. Thus, this code is no longer
required and can be removed.
