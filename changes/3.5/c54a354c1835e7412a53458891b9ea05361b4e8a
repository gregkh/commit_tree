x86, relocs: More relocations which may end up as absolute

GNU ld 2.22.52.0.1 has a bug that it blindly changes symbols from
section-relative to absolute if they are in a section of zero length.
This turns the symbols __init_begin and __init_end into absolute
symbols.  Let the relocs program know that those should be treated as
relative symbols.

This bug is exposed by checkin

433de739bbc2 x86, realmode: 16-bit real-mode code support for relocs tool

only in the sense that that checkin changes the relocs tool to report
an error instead of silently generating a kernel which is broken if
relocated.
