mtd: add read_byte support to plat_nand

Lantiq SoCs have a External Bus Unit (EBU) that is used to attach MTD media.
As we need to co-exist with PCI on the same bus, certain swapping settings must
be applied. Similar to the NOR map driver we need to apply a fix to make NAND
work. The easiest way is to use byte reads.
