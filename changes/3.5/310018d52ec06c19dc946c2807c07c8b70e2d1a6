ARM: OMAP2+: Fix MUSB ifdefs for platform init code

Commit 62285963 (usb: musb: drop a gigantic amount of ifdeferry)
got rid of a bunch of ifdefs in the MUSB code. Looks like the
platform init code is still using these dropped defines though,
which in many cases results the board defaulting always to host
mode.

Currently the situation is that USB_MUSB_HDRC is the main
Kconfig option with additional USB_GADGET_MUSB_HDRC so only
these two should be used to select between host and OTG mode.

Fix the situation for omaps. The following users should fix the
platform init code in a similar way:

Dropped Kconfig option          Current users

USB_MUSB_OTG                    blackfin, davinci, not in Kconfigs
USB_MUSB_PERIPHERAL             davinci, not in Kconfigs
USB_MUSB_HOST                   davinci, not in Kconfigs
USB_MUSB_HDRC_HCD               blackfin, not in Kconfigs
USB_MUSB_OTG                    blackfin, not in Kconfigs
