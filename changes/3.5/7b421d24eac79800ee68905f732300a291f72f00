mtip32xx: Create debugfs entries for troubleshooting

On module load, creates a debugfs parent 'rssd' in debugfs root. Then for each
device, create a new node with corresponding disk name. Under the new node, two
entries 'registers' and 'flags' are created.

NOTE: These entries were removed from sysfs in the previous patch
