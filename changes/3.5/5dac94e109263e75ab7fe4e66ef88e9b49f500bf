l2tp: let iproute2 create L2TPv3 IP tunnels using IPv6

The netlink API lets users create unmanaged L2TPv3 tunnels using
iproute2. Until now, a request to create an unmanaged L2TPv3 IP
encapsulation tunnel over IPv6 would be rejected with
EPROTONOSUPPORT. Now that l2tp_ip6 implements sockets for L2TP IP
encapsulation over IPv6, we can add support for that tunnel type.
