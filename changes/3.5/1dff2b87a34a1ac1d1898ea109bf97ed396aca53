md/bitmap: record the space available for the bitmap in the superblock.

Now that bitmaps can grow and shrink it is best if we record
how much space is available.  This means that when
we reduce the size of the bitmap we won't "lose" the space
for late when we might want to increase the size of the bitmap
again.
