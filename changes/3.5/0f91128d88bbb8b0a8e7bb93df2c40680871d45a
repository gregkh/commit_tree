drm/i915: Wait for all pending operations to the fb before disabling the pipe

During modeset we have to disable the pipe to reconfigure its timings
and maybe its size. Userspace may have queued up command buffers that
depend upon the pipe running in a certain configuration and so the
commands may become confused across the modeset. At the moment, we use a
less than satisfactory kick-scanline-waits should the GPU hang during
the modeset. It should be more reliable to wait for the pending
operations to complete first, even though we still have a window for
userspace to submit a broken command buffer during the modeset.
