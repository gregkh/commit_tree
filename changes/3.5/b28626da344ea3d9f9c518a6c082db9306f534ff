ARM: PCI: integrator: use common PCI swizzle

The Integrator swizzle function is almost the same as the standard PCI
swizzle, except for an initial check for pin = 0.  Make the integrator
swizzle function a wrapper around the standard PCI swizzle function so
we preseve this behaviour while using common code.

[fix to use pci_std_swizzle from Linus Walleij]
