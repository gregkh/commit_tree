mtd: nand: initialize bitflip_threshold prior to BBT scanning

As of edbc454 [mtd: driver _read() returns max_bitflips; mtd_read()
returns -EUCLEAN], 'mtd->bitflip_threshold' must be set for mtd devices
having ECC, prior any 'mtd_read()' call.
Otherwise, 'mtd_read()' will falsely return -EUCLEAN.

Normally, 'mtd->bitflip_threshold' is initialized when the MTD is added.

However, this is too late for NAND MTDs, as 'scan_bbt()' is invoked
prior the existing initialization of 'mtd->bitflip_threshold'.

This is a problem since 'scan_bbt()' calls 'mtd_read()', in the case
of a flash-based bad block table.
It resulted in a falsely reported bitflips indication during BBT read,
which lead to constant scrubbing of the flash BBT blocks.

Initialize 'mtd->bitflip_threshold' to its default value (if not already
set by the driver), prior to invocation of 'scan_bbt()'.
