md/raid5: improve removal of extra devices after reshape.

After a reshape which reduced the number of devices we need
to disconnect the extra devices.
The code for this doesn't currently handle 'replacement' devices.
It is very unlikely that such devices will be present, but it is
safest to handle them anyway.

So simplify the handling.  Just clear In_sync and leave it
to remove_and_add_spaces (which will be called soon) to do
the real works.
