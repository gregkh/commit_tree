ACPI video: Still use ACPI backlight control if _DOS doesn't exist

This fixes a regression in 3.4-rc1 caused by commit
ea9f8856bd6d4ed45885b06a338f7362cd6c60e5
(ACPI video: Harden video bus adding.)

Some platforms don't have _DOS control method, but the ACPI
backlight still works.
We should not invoke _DOS for these platforms.
