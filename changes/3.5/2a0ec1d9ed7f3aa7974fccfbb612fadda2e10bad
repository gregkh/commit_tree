xfs: move xfs_get_extsz_hint() and kill xfs_rw.h

The only thing left in xfs_rw.h is a function prototype for an inode
function.  Move that to xfs_inode.h, and kill xfs_rw.h.

Also move the function implementing the prototype from xfs_rw.c to
xfs_inode.c so we only have one function left in xfs_rw.c
