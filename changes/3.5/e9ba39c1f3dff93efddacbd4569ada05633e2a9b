KVM: PPC: bookehv: disable MAS register updates early

We need to make sure that no MAS updates happen automatically while we
have the guest MAS registers loaded. So move the disabling code a bit
higher up so that it covers the full time we have guest values in MAS
registers.

The race this patch fixes should never occur, but it makes the code a
bit more logical to do it this way around.
