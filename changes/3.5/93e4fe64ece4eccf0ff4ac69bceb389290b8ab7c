edac: rewrite edac_align_ptr()

The edac_align_ptr() function is used to prepare data for a single
memory allocation kzalloc() call. It counts how many bytes are needed
by some data structure.

Using it as-is is not that trivial, as the quantity of memory elements
reserved is not there, but, instead, it is on a next call.

In order to avoid mistakes when using it, move the number of allocated
elements into it, making easier to use it.
