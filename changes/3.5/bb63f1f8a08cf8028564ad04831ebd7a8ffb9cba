bridge: Fix fatal typo in setup of multicast_querier_expired

Unfortunately it seems that I didn't properly test the case of
an expired external querier in the recent multicast bridge series.

The setup of the timer in that case is completely broken and leads
to a NULL-pointer dereference.  This patch fixes it.
