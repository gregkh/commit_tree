epoll: Add a flag, EPOLLWAKEUP, to prevent suspend while epoll events are ready

When an epoll_event, that has the EPOLLWAKEUP flag set, is ready, a
wakeup_source will be active to prevent suspend. This can be used to
handle wakeup events from a driver that support poll, e.g. input, if
that driver wakes up the waitqueue passed to epoll before allowing
suspend.
