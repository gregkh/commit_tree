tipc: handle <0.0.0> as an alias for this node on outgoing msgs

Revises handling of send routines for payload messages to ensure that
they are processed properly even if the node's network address is
changed in mid-operation. The routines now treat the default node
address of <0.0.0> as an alias for "this node" when determining where
to send an outgoing message.
