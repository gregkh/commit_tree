of/irq: add empty irq_of_parse_and_map() for non-dt builds

Add a empty irq_of_parse_and_map() function that returns 0 for non-dt
builds and avoid having #ifdef CONFIG_OF around all calls to
irq_of_parse_and_map(). In addition to that, the irq_of_parse_and_map()
function declaration is made available only if CONFIG_OF_IRQ is defined,
which is the same config option that makes the irq_of_parse_and_map()
function definition available. While at it, fix a typo as well.

Changes since v1:
- Moved irq_of_parse_and_map() function declaration under CONFIG_OF_IRQ.
- Fix a minor typo in comments.
