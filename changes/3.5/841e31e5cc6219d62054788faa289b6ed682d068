mm/mmap.c: find_vma(): remove unnecessary if(mm) check

The "if (mm)" check is not required in find_vma, as the kernel code
calls find_vma only when it is absolutely sure that the mm_struct arg to
it is non-NULL.

Remove the if(mm) check and adding the a WARN_ONCE(!mm) for now.  This
will serve the purpose of mandating that the execution
context(user-mode/kernel-mode) be known before find_vma is called.  Also
fixed 2 checkpatch.pl errors in the declaration of the rb_node and
vma_tmp local variables.

I was browsing through the internet and read a discussion at
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/27/342 which discusses removal of the
validation check within find_vma.  Since no-one responded, I decided to
send this patch with Andrew's suggestions.
