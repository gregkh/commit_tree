userns:  Silence silly gcc warning.

On 32bit builds gcc says:
kernel/user.c:30:4: warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO C90 [enabled by default]
kernel/user.c:38:4: warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO C90 [enabled by default]

Silence gcc by changing the constant 4294967295 to 4294967295U.
