wl12xx: support wowlan wakeup patterns

Use FW RX data filters to support cfg80211 wowlan wakeup patterns.
This enables to wake up the host from suspend following detection
of certain configurable patterns within an incoming packet.
Up to 5 patterns are supported. Once the host is resumed
any configured RX data filter is cleared.
A single pattern can match several bytes sequences with different
offsets within a packet.
