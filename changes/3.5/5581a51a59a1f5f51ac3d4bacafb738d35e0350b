Btrfs: don't set for_cow parameter for tree block functions

Three callers of btrfs_free_tree_block or btrfs_alloc_tree_block passed
parameter for_cow = 1. In fact, these two functions should never mark
their tree modification operations as for_cow, because they can change
the number of blocks referenced by a tree.

Hence, we remove the extra for_cow parameter from these functions and
make them pass a zero down.
