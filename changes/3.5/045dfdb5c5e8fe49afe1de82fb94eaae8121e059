drivers/video/ep93xx-fb.c: clean up error-handling code

There were two problems in this code: failure of the setup function should
free locally allocated resources like other nearby failures, and the test
if (&info->cmap) can never be false.  To generally clean things up, this
patch reorders the error handling code at the failed label and adds labels
so that the conditionals are not necessary.
