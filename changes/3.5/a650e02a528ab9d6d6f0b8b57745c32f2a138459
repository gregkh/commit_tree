ftrace: Consolidate ftrace_location() and ftrace_text_reserved()

Both ftrace_location() and ftrace_text_reserved() do basically the same thing.
They search to see if an address is in the ftace table (contains an address
that may change from nop to call ftrace_caller). The difference is
that ftrace_location() searches a single address, but ftrace_text_reserved()
searches a range.

This also makes the ftrace_text_reserved() faster as it now uses a bsearch()
instead of linearly searching all the addresses within a page.
