ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: fix interfaces for the MMC hwmods

Commit a52e2ab66d4a9305e1ba64d9b9d25754b6c70895 ("ARM: OMAP3: hwmod
data: disable multiblock reads on MMC1/2 on OMAP34xx/35xx <= ES2.1")
didn't link the MMC hwmods to the interconnects correctly.  Future
patches will register hwmods by interface, so if this is not fixed,
the MMC IP blocks won't be registered.  Update the interface data
records to point to the correct IP blocks.
