ARM: pxa: hx4700: Fix basic suspend/resume

Basic suspend/resume is fixed by ensuring that the PGSR registers are
set correctly before sleep mode is entered. In particular four of the
active low resets need to be driven high while in sleep mode, otherwise
the unit resets itself instead of suspending. Another problem was that
the PCFR_GPROD bit is set by the HTC bootloader; this caused GPIO reset
(i.e. the reset button) to fail immediately after returning from sleep
mode.
