cfg80211: warn if db.txt is empty with CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB

It has happened twice now where elaborate troubleshooting has
undergone on systems where CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB [0]
has been set but yet net/wireless/db.txt was not updated.

Despite the documentation on this it seems system integrators could
use some more help with this, so throw out a kernel warning at boot time
when their database is empty.

This does mean that the error-prone system integrator won't likely
realize the issue until they boot the machine but -- it does not seem
to make sense to enable a build bug breaking random build testing.
