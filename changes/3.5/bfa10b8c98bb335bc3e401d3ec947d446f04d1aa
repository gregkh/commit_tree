floppy: remove floppy-specific O_EXCL handling

Block layer now handles O_EXCL in a generic way for block devices.

The semantics is however different for floppy and all other block devices,
as floppy driver contains its own O_EXCL handling.

The semantics for all-but-floppy bdevs is "there can be at most one O_EXCL
open of this file", while for floppy bdev the semantics is "if someone has
the bdev open with O_EXCL, noone else can open it".

There is actual userspace-observable change in behavior because of this
since commit e525fd89d380c ("block: make blkdev_get/put() handle exclusive
access") -- on kernels containing this commit, mount of /dev/fd0 causes
the fd0 block device be claimed with _EXCL, preventing subsequent
open(/dev/fd0).

Bring things back into shape, i.e.  make it possible, analogically to
other block devices, to mount the floppy and open() it afterwards --
remove the floppy-specific handling and let the generic bdev code O_EXCL
handling take over.
