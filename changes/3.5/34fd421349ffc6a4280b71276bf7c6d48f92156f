ARM: 7378/1: mmci: add support for the Nomadik MMCI variant

The Nomadik variant is somewhere inbetween the U300 and the Ux500
variant, its actually expose the same primecell ID as the U300
but had different characteristics so it needs a small revision
bump and hard-coding from the board/device tree. After this it
works just fine.
