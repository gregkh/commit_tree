mmc: sdio: fix setting card data bus width as 4-bit

SDIO_CCCR_IF[1:0] in SDIO card is used for card data bus width
setting as below:

     00b: 1-bit bus
     01b: Reserved
     10b: 4-bit bus
     11b: 8-bit bus (only for embedded SDIO)

And sdio_enable_wide is for setting data bus width as 4-bit.
But currently, it first reads the register, second OR' 1b with
SDIO_CCCR_IF[1], and then writes it back.

As we can see, this is based on such assumption that the
SDIO_CCCR_IF[0] is always 0. Apparently, this is not right.
