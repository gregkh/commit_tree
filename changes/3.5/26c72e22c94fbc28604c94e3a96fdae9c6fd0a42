firewire: sbp2: document the absence of alignment requirements

The SBP-2/3 specifications do not require any alignment of data
buffers; only their own data structures need to be quadlet-aligned
[SR: or octlet-aligned].

Fix the comments to reflect this, but leave the actual alignment at
32 bits to avoid theoretical problems with target implementations
that might handle this incorrectly.
