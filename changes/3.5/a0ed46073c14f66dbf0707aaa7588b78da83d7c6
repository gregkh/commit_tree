KVM: MMU: Split the main body of rmap_write_protect() off from others

We will use this in the following patch to implement another function
which needs to write protect pages using the rmap information.

Note that there is a small change in debug printing for large pages:
we do not differentiate them from others to avoid duplicating code.
