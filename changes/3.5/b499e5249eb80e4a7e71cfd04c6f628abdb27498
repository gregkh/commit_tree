[SCSI] sg: protect sdp->exclude

Changes since v1: set_exclude now returns the new value, which gets
rid of the comma expression and the operator precedence bug.  Thanks
to Douglas for spotting it.

sdp->exclude was previously protected by the BKL.  The sg_mutex, which
replaced the BKL, only semi-protected it, as it was missing from
sg_release() and sg_proc_seq_show_debug().  Take an explicit spinlock
for it.
