KVM: x86: Run PIT work in own kthread

We can't run PIT IRQ injection work in the interrupt context of the host
timer. This would allow the user to influence the handler complexity by
asking for a broadcast to a large number of VCPUs. Therefore, this work
was pushed into workqueue context in 9d244caf2e. However, this prevents
prioritizing the PIT injection over other task as workqueues share
kernel threads.

This replaces the workqueue with a kthread worker and gives that thread
a name in the format "kvm-pit/<owner-process-pid>". That allows to
identify and adjust the kthread priority according to the VM process
parameters.
