Revert "of: match by compatible property first"

This reverts commit 107a84e61cdd3406c842a0e4be7efffd3a05dba6.

Meelis Roos reports a regression since 3.5-rc5 that stops Sun Fire V100
and Sun Netra X1 sparc64 machines from booting, hanging after enabling
serial console.  He bisected it to commit 107a84e61cdd.

Rob Herring explains:
 "The problem is match combinations of compatible plus name and/or type
  fail to match correctly.  I have a fix for this, but given how late it
  is for 3.5 I think it is best to revert this for now.  There could be
  other cases that rely on the current although wrong behavior.  I will
  post an updated version for 3.6."
