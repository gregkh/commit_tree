x86/reboot: Clean up coding style

This commit simply cleans up the style used in this file to fall
in line with what's specified in CodingStyle.  Mostly comment
changes, with a single removal of unneeded braces.

Note that the comments for all the DMI quirks in
reboot_dmi_table now all line up consistently using tabs instead
of spaces.
