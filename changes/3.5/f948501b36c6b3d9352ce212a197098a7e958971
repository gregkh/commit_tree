Make hard_irq_disable() actually hard-disable interrupts

At present, hard_irq_disable() does nothing on powerpc because of
this code in include/linux/interrupt.h:

    #ifndef hard_irq_disable
    #define hard_irq_disable()      do { } while(0)
    #endif

So we need to make our hard_irq_disable be a macro.  It was previously
a macro until commit 7230c56441 ("powerpc: Rework lazy-interrupt
handling") changed it to a static inline function.
