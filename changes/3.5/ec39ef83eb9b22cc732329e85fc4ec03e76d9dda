i2c-s3c2410: Add HDMIPHY quirk for S3C2440

This patch adds support for s3c2440 I2C bus controller dedicated HDMIPHY device on
Exynos4 platform. Some quirks are introduced due to differences between HDMIPHY
and other I2C controllers on Exynos4.  These differences are:
- no GPIOs, HDMIPHY is inside the SoC and the controller is connected
  internally
- due to unknown reason (probably HW bug in HDMIPHY and/or the controller) a
  transfer fails to finish. The controller hangs after sending the last byte,
  the workaround for this bug is resetting the controller after each transfer
