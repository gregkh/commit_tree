drm/i915/intel_i2c: handle zero-length reads

A common method of probing an i2c bus is trying to do a zero-length read.
Handle this case by checking the length first waiting for data to be read.

This is actually important, since attempting a zero-length read is one
of the ways that i2cdetect and i2c_new_probed_device detect whether
there is device present on the bus with a given address.
