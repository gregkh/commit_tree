netfilter: ipset: fix timeout value overflow bug

Large timeout parameters could result wrong timeout values due to
an overflow at msec to jiffies conversion (reported by Andreas Herz)

[ This patch was mangled by Pablo Neira Ayuso since David Laight and
  Eric Dumazet noticed that we were using hardcoded 1000 instead of
  MSEC_PER_SEC to calculate the timeout ]
