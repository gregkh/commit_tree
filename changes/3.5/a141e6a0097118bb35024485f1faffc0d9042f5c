net/wireless: ipw2x00: add supported cipher suites to wiphy initialization

Driver doesn't report its supported cipher suites through cfg80211
interface. It still uses wext interface and probably will not work
through nl80211, but will at least correctly advertise supported
features.

Bug was reported by Omar Siam.
