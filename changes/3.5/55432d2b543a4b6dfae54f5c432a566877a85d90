inetpeer: fix a race in inetpeer_gc_worker()

commit 5faa5df1fa2024 (inetpeer: Invalidate the inetpeer tree along with
the routing cache) added a race :

Before freeing an inetpeer, we must respect a RCU grace period, and make
sure no user will attempt to increase refcnt.

inetpeer_invalidate_tree() waits for a RCU grace period before inserting
inetpeer tree into gc_list and waking the worker. At that time, no
concurrent lookup can find a inetpeer in this tree.
