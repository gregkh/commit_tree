ASoC: dpcm: Add bespoke trigger()

Some on SoC DSP HW is very tightly coupled with DMA and DAI drivers. It's
necessary to allow some flexability wrt to PCM operations here so that we
can define a bespoke DPCM trigger() PCM operation for such HW.

A bespoke DPCM trigger() allows exact ordering and timing of component
triggering by allowing a component driver to manage the final enable
and disable configurations without adding extra complexity to other
component drivers. e.g. The McPDM DAI and ABE are tightly coupled on
OMAP4 so we have a bespoke trigger to manage the trigger to improve
performance and reduce complexity when triggering new McPDM BEs.
