cgroups: disallow attaching kthreadd or PF_THREAD_BOUND threads

Allowing kthreadd to be moved to a non-root group makes no sense, it being
a global resource, and needlessly leads unsuspecting users toward trouble.

1. An RT workqueue worker thread spawned in a task group with no rt_runtime
allocated is not schedulable.  Simple user error, but harmful to the box.

2. A worker thread which acquires PF_THREAD_BOUND can never leave a cpuset,
rendering the cpuset immortal.

Save the user some unexpected trouble, just say no.
