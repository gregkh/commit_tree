Btrfs: add btrfs_search_old_slot

The tree modification log together with the current state of the tree gives
a consistent, old version of the tree. btrfs_search_old_slot is used to
search through this old version and return old (dummy!) extent buffers.
Naturally, this function cannot do any tree modifications.
