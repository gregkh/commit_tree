regulator: max8925: Remove check_range function and max_uV from struct rc5t583_regulator_info

This driver has been converted to use regulator_map_voltage_linear and
set_voltage_sel now. regulator_map_voltage_linear will check the the voltage
falls within specified range. The check_range() function and max_uV field are
not used now, remove them.
