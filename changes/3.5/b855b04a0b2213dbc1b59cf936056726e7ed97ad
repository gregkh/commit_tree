block: blk-throttle should be drained regardless of q->elevator

Currently, blk_cleanup_queue() doesn't call elv_drain_elevator() if
q->elevator doesn't exist; however, bio based drivers don't have
elevator initialized but can still use blk-throttle.  This patch moves
q->elevator test inside blk_drain_queue() such that only
elv_drain_elevator() is skipped if !q->elevator.

-v2: loop can have registered queue which has NULL request_fn.  Make
     sure we don't call into __blk_run_queue() in such cases.
