cifs: fix oops while traversing open file list (try #4)

While traversing the linked list of open file handles, if the identfied
file handle is invalid, a reopen is attempted and if it fails, we
resume traversing where we stopped and cifs can oops while accessing
invalid next element, for list might have changed.

So mark the invalid file handle and attempt reopen if no
valid file handle is found in rest of the list.
If reopen fails, move the invalid file handle to the end of the list
and start traversing the list again from the begining.
Repeat this four times before giving up and returning an error if
file reopen keeps failing.
