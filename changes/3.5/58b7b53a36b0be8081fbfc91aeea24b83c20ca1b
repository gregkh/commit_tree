xen/balloon: Subtract from xen_released_pages the count that is populated.

We did not take into account that xen_released_pages would be
used outside the initial E820 parsing code. As such we would
did not subtract from xen_released_pages the count of pages
that we had populated back (instead we just did a simple
extra_pages = released - populated).

The balloon driver uses xen_released_pages to set the initial
current_pages count.  If this is wrong (too low) then when a new
(higher) target is set, the balloon driver will request too many pages
from Xen."

This fixes errors such as:

(XEN) memory.c:133:d0 Could not allocate order=0 extent: id=0 memflags=0 (51 of 512)
during bootup and
free_memory            : 0

where the free_memory should be 128.
