ARM: 7347/1: SCU: use cpu_logical_map for per-CPU low power mode

scu_power_mode changes the power mode for the current CPU, which it
determines from smp_processor_id(). However, this assumes that the
physical CPU number is equal to Linux's logical CPU number and if this
is not true, we will power off the wrong CPU.

This patch uses cpu_logical_map to translate the logical CPU number
into a physical one in scu_power_mode.
