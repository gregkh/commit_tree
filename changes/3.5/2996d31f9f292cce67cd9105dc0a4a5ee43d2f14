net: Stop decapitating clones that have a head_frag

This change is meant ot prevent stealing the skb->head to use as a page in
the event that the skb->head was cloned.  This allows the other clones to
track each other via shinfo->dataref.

Without this we break down to two methods for tracking the reference count,
one being dataref, the other being the page count.  As a result it becomes
difficult to track how many references there are to skb->head.
