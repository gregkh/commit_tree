regulator: tps62360: make init_data of platform data to pointer.

Convert platform data member regulator_init_data to pointer type.
This will avoid the copy of entire regualator init data into
platform data member when adding dt support and it can be achieve
by simple assignment:
pdata->init_data = of_get_regulator_init_data(dev, dev->of_node);
