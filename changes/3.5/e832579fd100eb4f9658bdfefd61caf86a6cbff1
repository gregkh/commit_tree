jffs2: remove unnecessary GC pass on sync

We do not need to call 'jffs2_write_super()' on sync. This function
causes a GC pass to make sure the current contents is pushed out with
the data which we already have on the media.

But this is not needed on unmount and only slows sync down unnecessarily.
It is enough to just sync the write-buffer.

This call was added by one of the generic VFS rework patch-sets,
see d579ed00aa96a7f7486978540a0d7cecaff742ae.
