x86/nmi: Fix the type of the nmiaction.flags field

This patch changes the type of the struct nmiaction flags field
to unsigned long from unsigned int. All the usages of the flags
field are unsigned long already. There is only one flag used
currently, NMI_FLAG_FIRST, but having the wrong size could cause
a truncation bug in the future on 64 bit architectures.
