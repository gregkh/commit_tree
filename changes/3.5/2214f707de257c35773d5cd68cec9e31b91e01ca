blackfin: a couple of task->mm handling fixes

The patch fixes two problems:

1. Working with task->mm w/o getting mm or grabing the task lock is
   dangerous as ->mm might disappear (exit_mm() assigns NULL under
   task_lock(), so tasklist lock is not enough).

   We can't use get_task_mm()/mmput() pair as mmput() might sleep,
   so we have to take the task lock while handle its mm.

2. Checking for process->mm is not enough because process' main
   thread may exit or detach its mm via use_mm(), but other threads
   may still have a valid mm.

   To catch this we use find_lock_task_mm(), which walks up all
   threads and returns an appropriate task (with task lock held).
