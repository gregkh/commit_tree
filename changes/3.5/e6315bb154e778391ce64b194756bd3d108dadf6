mqueue: revert bump up DFLT_*MAX

Mqueue limitation is slightly naieve parameter likes other ipcs because
unprivileged user can consume kernel memory by using ipcs.

Thus, too aggressive raise bring us security issue.  Example, current
setting allow evil unprivileged user use 256GB (= 256 * 1024 * 1024*1024)
and it's enough large to system will belome unresponsive.  Don't do that.

Instead, every admin should adjust the knobs for their own systems.
