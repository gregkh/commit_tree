PM / Hibernate: Hibernate/thaw fixes/improvements

 1. Do not allocate memory for buffers from emergency pools, unless
    absolutely required. Do not warn about and do not retry non-essential
    failed allocations.

 2. Do not check the amount of free pages left on every single page
    write, but wait until one map is completely populated and then check.

 3. Set maximum number of pages for read buffering consistently, instead
    of inadvertently depending on the size of the sector type.

 4. Fix copyright line, which I missed when I submitted the hibernation
    threading patch.

 5. Dispense with bit shifting arithmetic to improve readability.

 6. Really recalculate the number of pages required to be free after all
    allocations have been done.

 7. Fix calculation of pages required for read buffering. Only count in
    pages that do not belong to high memory.
