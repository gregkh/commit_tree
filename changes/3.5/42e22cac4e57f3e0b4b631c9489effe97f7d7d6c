[SCSI] storvsc: Properly handle errors from the host

Hyper-V cannot process some commands like ATA_12 and ATA_16. It also returns a
very generic error when this happens (SRB_STATUS_ERROR).  Most of the time we
treat SRB_STATUS_ERROR as DID_TARGET_FAILURE which causes error handler retry,
but in the case of pass through commands, they'll never succeed (and the error
handler will offline the device), so put a discriminating block in the command
completion routing and send the SRB_STATUS_ERROR upwards with DID_PASSTHROUGH
for commands we know should not be retried.
