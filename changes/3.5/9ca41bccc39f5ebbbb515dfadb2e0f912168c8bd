ARM i.MX pllv2: make round_rate accurate

in round_rate we made the assumption that we can set arbitrary
frequencies and thus returned the input rate. This is not correct,
for certain frequencies after setting a frequency with set_rate,
recalc_rate will return different values. To fix this, introduce
set_rate/recalc_rate functions which work on variables instead
of registers directly. This way we can call these in round_rate
to get the exact rate which we would get if we call set_rate
with this value.
