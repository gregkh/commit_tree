ARM: OMAP2xxx: hwmod data: share common interface data

Several struct omap_hwmod_ocp_if records can be shared between OMAP2420
and OMAP2430.  Move these shared records out of the chip-specific files
into mach-omap2/omap_hwmod_2xxx_interconnect_data.c.  This should save some
memory and source lines, at the cost of readability.
