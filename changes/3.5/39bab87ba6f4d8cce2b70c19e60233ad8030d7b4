Btrfs: fix btrfs_release_extent_buffer_page with the right usage of num_extent_pages

num_extent_pages returns the number of pages in the specific range, not
the index of the last page in the eb range.

btrfs_release_extent_buffer_page is called with start_idx set 0 in current
codes, so it's not a problem yet. But the logic is indeed wrong.

Fix it here.
