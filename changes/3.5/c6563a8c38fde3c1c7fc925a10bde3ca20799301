md: add possibility to change data-offset for devices.

When reshaping we can avoid costly intermediate backup by
changing the 'start' address of the array on the device
(if there is enough room).

So as a first step, allow such a change to be requested
through sysfs, and recorded in v1.x metadata.

(As we didn't previous check that all 'pad' fields were zero,
 we need a new FEATURE flag for this.
 A (belatedly) check that all remaining 'pad' fields are
 zero to avoid a repeat of this)

The new data offset must be requested separately for each device.
This allows each to have a different change in the data offset.
This is not likely to be used often but as data_offset can be
set per-device, new_data_offset should be too.

This patch also removes the 'acknowledged' arg to rdev_set_badblocks as
it is never used and never will be.  At the same time we add a new
arg ('in_new') which is currently always zero but will be used more
soon.

When a reshape finishes we will need to update the data_offset
and rdev->sectors.  So provide an exported function to do that.
