Bluetooth: Refactor L2CAP ERTM and streaming transmit segmentation

Use more common code for ERTM and streaming mode segmentation and
transmission, and begin using skb control block data for delaying
extended or enhanced header generation until just before the packet is
transmitted.  This code is also better suited for resegmentation,
which is needed when L2CAP links are reconfigured after an AMP channel
move.
