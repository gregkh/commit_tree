mac80211: Implement HT mixed protection mode

Section 9.23.3.5 of IEEE 80211s standard describes the protection rules for
HT mesh STA in a MBSS. Three HT protection modes are supported for now:

non-HT mixed mode - is selected if any non-HT peers are present in our MBSS.
20MHz-protection mode - is selected if all peers in our 20/40MHz MBSS support
			HT and atleast one HT20 peer is present.
no-protection mode - is selected otherwise.

This is a limited implementation of 9.23.3.5, which only considers mesh peers
when determining the HT protection mode. Station's channel_type needs to be
maintained.
