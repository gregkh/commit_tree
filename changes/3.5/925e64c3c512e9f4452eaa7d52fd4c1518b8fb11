    mac80211: do not scan and monitor connection in parallel

add bug, which make possible to start a scan and never finish it, so
make every new scanning request finish with -EBUSY error. This can
happen on code paths where we finish connection monitoring and clear
IEEE80211_STA_*_POLL flags, but do not check if scan was deferred.
This patch fixes those code paths.
