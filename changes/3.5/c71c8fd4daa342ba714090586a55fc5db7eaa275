regulator: palmas: Fix wrong kfree calls

The devm_kzalloc function eliminates the need for manual resource releasing
and simplify error handling. Resources allocated by devm_* are freed
automatically on driver detach.

Thus adding kfree calls here will introduce double free bug.

The memory of desc array and the pointers to the rdev[] are allocated by
devm_kzalloc call for struct palmas_pmic.

struct palmas_pmic {
        struct palmas *palmas;
        struct device *dev;
        struct regulator_desc desc[PALMAS_NUM_REGS];
        struct regulator_dev *rdev[PALMAS_NUM_REGS];
        struct mutex mutex;

        int smps123;
        int smps457;

        int range[PALMAS_REG_SMPS10];
};

Which means we should not call kfree for pmic->rdev and pmic->desc.
