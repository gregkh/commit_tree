writeback: Move requeueing when I_SYNC set to writeback_sb_inodes()

When writeback_single_inode() is called on inode which has I_SYNC already
set while doing WB_SYNC_NONE, inode is moved to b_more_io list. However
this makes sense only if the caller is flusher thread. For other callers of
writeback_single_inode() it doesn't really make sense and may be even wrong
- flusher thread may be doing WB_SYNC_ALL writeback in parallel.

So we move requeueing from writeback_single_inode() to writeback_sb_inodes().
