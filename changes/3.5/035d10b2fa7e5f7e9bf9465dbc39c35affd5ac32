blkcg: add blkio_policy[] array and allow one policy per policy ID

Block cgroup policies are maintained in a linked list and,
theoretically, multiple policies sharing the same policy ID are
allowed.

This patch temporarily restricts one policy per plid and adds
blkio_policy[] array which indexes registered policy types by plid.
Both the restriction and blkio_policy[] array are transitional and
will be removed once API cleanup is complete.
