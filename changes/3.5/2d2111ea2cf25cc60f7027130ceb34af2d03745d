staging: comedi: fix build errors caused by module_init/module_exit refactor

A couple build errors were introduced with the module_init/module_exit
refactor.

The struct comedi_driver variable was being accessed directly in the
attach and detach routines. Instead of doing this, access the variable
indirectly using the driver pointer in struct comedi_device.
