ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: fix 32k sync timer idle modes

The 32k sync timer IP block target idle modes in the hwmod data are
incorrect.  The IP block does not support any smart-idle modes.
Update the data to reflect the correct modes.

This problem was initially identified and a diff fragment posted to
the lists by Benoît Cousson <b-cousson@ti.com>.  A patch description
bug in the first version was also identified by Benoît.
