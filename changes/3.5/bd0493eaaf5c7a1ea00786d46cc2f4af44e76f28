ARM: 7413/1: move read_{boot,persistent}_clock to the architecture level

At the moment, read_persistent_clock is implemented at the
platform level, which makes it impossible to compile these
platforms in a single kernel.

Implement these two functions at the architecture level, and
provide a thin registration interface for both read_boot_clock
and read_persistent_clock. The two affected platforms (OMAP and
Tegra) are converted at the same time.
