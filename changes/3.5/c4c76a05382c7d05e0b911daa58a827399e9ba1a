blkcg: restructure blkio_get_stat()

Restructure blkio_get_stat() to prepare for removal of stats_lock.

* Define BLKIO_STAT_ARR_NR explicitly to denote which stats have
  subtypes instead of using BLKIO_STAT_QUEUED.

* Separate out stat acquisition and printing.  After this, there are
  only two users of blkio_fill_stat().  Just open code it.

* The code was mixing MAX_KEY_LEN and MAX_KEY_LEN - 1.  There's no
  need to subtract one.  Use MAX_KEY_LEN consistently.
