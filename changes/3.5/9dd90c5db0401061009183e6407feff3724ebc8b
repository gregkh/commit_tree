ASoC: max98095: add jack detection

This change adds the logic to support using the jack detect mechanism built
in to the codec to detect both when a jack was inserted and what type of
jack is present.

This change also supports the use of an external mechanism for headphone
detection. If this mechanism exists, when the max98095_jack_detect function
is called, the hp_jack is simply passed NULL.

This change supports both simple headphones, powered headphones, microphones
and headsets with both headphones and a mic.
