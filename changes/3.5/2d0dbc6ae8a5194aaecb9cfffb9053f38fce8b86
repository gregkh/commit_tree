NFSv4: Fix unnecessary delegation returns in nfs4_do_open

While nfs4_do_open() expects the fmode argument to be restricted to
combinations of FMODE_READ and FMODE_WRITE, both nfs4_atomic_open()
and nfs4_proc_create will pass the nfs_open_context->mode,
which contains the full fmode_t.

This patch ensures that nfs4_do_open strips the other fmode_t bits,
fixing a problem in which the nfs4_do_open call would result in an
unnecessary delegation return.
