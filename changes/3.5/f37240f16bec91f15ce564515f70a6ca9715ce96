x86, realmode: header for trampoline code

Added header for trampoline code that can be used to supply
input data to it. This makes interface between real mode code
and kernel cleaner and simpler. Replaced two confusing pointers
to level4 pgt in trampoline_64.S with a single pointer to the
beginning of the page table.
