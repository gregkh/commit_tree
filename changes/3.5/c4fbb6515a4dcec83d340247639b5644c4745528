NFC: The core part should generate the target index

The target index can be used by userspace to uniquely identify a target
and thus should be kept unique, per NFC adapter. Moreover, some protocols
do not provide a logical index when discovering new targets, so we have to
generate one for them.
For NCI or pn533 to fetch their logical index, we added a logical_idx field
to the target structure.
