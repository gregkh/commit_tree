net/mlx4_en: sk_prio <=> UP for untagged traffic

Since vlan egress map is only good for tagged traffic, need to have other
mapping to be used by untagged traffic.
For that, the driver uses sch_mqprio mapping. This mapping could be set by
using tc tool from iproute2 package.
Mapped UP will be used by the HW for QoS purposes, but won't go out on the
wire.
