ext4: force ro mount if ext4_setup_super() fails

If ext4_setup_super() fails i.e. due to a too-high revision,
the error is logged in dmesg but the fs is not mounted RO as
indicated.

Tested by:

# mkfs.ext4 -r 4 /dev/sdb6
# mount /dev/sdb6 /mnt/test
# dmesg | grep "too high"
[164919.759248] EXT4-fs (sdb6): revision level too high, forcing read-only mode
# grep sdb6 /proc/mounts
/dev/sdb6 /mnt/test2 ext4 rw,seclabel,relatime,data=ordered 0 0
