cfq: collapse cfq.h into cfq-iosched.c

block/cfq.h contains some functions which interact with blkcg;
however, this is only part of it and cfq-iosched.c already has quite
some #ifdef CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED.  With conf/stat handling being
moved to specific policies, having these relay functions isolated in
cfq.h doesn't make much sense.  Collapse cfq.h into cfq-iosched.c for
now.  Let's split blkcg support properly later if necessary.
