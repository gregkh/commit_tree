vsprintf: fix %ps on non symbols when using kallsyms

Using %ps in a printk format will sometimes fail silently and print the
empty string if the address passed in does not match a symbol that
kallsyms knows about.  But using %pS will fall back to printing the full
address if kallsyms can't find the symbol.  Make %ps act the same as %pS
by falling back to printing the address.

While we're here also make %ps print the module that a symbol comes from
so that it matches what %pS already does.  Take this simple function for
example (in a module):

	static void test_printk(void)
	{
		int test;
		pr_info("with pS: %pS\n", &test);
		pr_info("with ps: %ps\n", &test);
	}
