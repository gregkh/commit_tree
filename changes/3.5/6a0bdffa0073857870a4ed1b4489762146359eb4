SCSI & usb-storage: add try_rc_10_first flag

Several bug reports have been received recently for USB mass-storage
devices that don't handle READ CAPACITY(16) commands properly.  They
report bogus sizes, in some cases becoming unusable as a result.

The bugs were triggered by commit
09b6b51b0b6c1b9bb61815baf205e4d74c89ff04 (SCSI & usb-storage: add
flags for VPD pages and REPORT LUNS), which caused usb-storage to stop
overriding the SCSI level reported by devices.  By default, the sd
driver will try READ CAPACITY(16) first for any device whose level is
above SCSI_SPC_2.

It seems likely that any device large enough to require the use of
READ CAPACITY(16) (i.e., 2 TB or more) would be able to handle READ
CAPACITY(10) commands properly.  Indeed, I don't know of any devices
that don't handle READ CAPACITY(10) properly.

Therefore this patch (as1559) adds a new flag telling the sd driver
to try READ CAPACITY(10) before READ CAPACITY(16), and sets this flag
for every USB mass-storage device.  If a device really is larger than
2 TB, sd will fall back to READ CAPACITY(16) just as it used to.

This fixes Bugzilla #43391.
