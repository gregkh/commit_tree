Input: wacom - add Intuos5 Touch Ring LED support

The Touch Ring LEDs on Intuos5 tablets use a different report
format which supports only 4 levels of brightness. We remap
the 7-bit value obtained from sysfs to an appropriate value
for the tablet. Control of the crop mark LEDs (new to the I5)
is left for a later patch.
