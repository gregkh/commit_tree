ARM: OMAP2+: declare file-local functions as static

Several function declarations used only in the files in which they're
declared should include the static keyword, but don't:

    arch/arm/mach-omap2/serial.c:248:6: warning: symbol 'cmdline_find_option' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap-wakeupgen.c:259:6: warning: symbol 'irq_sar_clear' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-rx51-peripherals.c:878:27: warning: symbol 'rx51_vibra_data' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-rx51-peripherals.c:882:27: warning: symbol 'rx51_audio_data' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap4panda.c:201:29: warning: symbol 'omap_panda_wlan_data' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap4panda.c:393:24: warning: symbol 'omap4_panda_dvi_device' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap4panda.c:403:12: warning: symbol 'omap4_panda_dvi_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap4panda.c:464:6: warning: symbol 'omap4_panda_display_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/hsmmc.c:434:6: warning: symbol 'omap_init_hsmmc' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap2/hwspinlock.c:31:12: warning: symbol 'hwspinlocks_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap1/timer.c:58:12: warning: symbol 'omap1_dm_timer_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/arm/mach-omap1/fpga.c:90:6: warning: symbol 'innovator_fpga_IRQ_demux' was not declared. Should it be static?

Mark all of these as static.
