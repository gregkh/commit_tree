regmap: add support for non contiguous status to regmap-irq

In some chips the IRQ status registers are not contiguous in the register
map but spaced at even spaces. This is an easy case to handle with minor
changes. It is assume for this purpose that the stride for status is
equal to the stride for mask/ack registers as well.
