ASoC: OMAP: HDMI: Introduce codec

Introduce codec for HDMI. At the moment, this is a dummy codec. In the
future it will parse the EDID to modify the supported parameters, such
as the number of channels and the sample rates. At the moment, it blindly
supports all the sample rates and audio channels described in the HDMI
1.4a specification.
