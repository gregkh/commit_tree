iommu: Rename intr_remapping files to intel_intr_remapping

The files contain code mostly relevant for the Intel
implementation of interrupt remapping. Make that visible in
the file names. Also inline intr_remapping.h into
intr_remapping.c because it is only included there and the
content is very small. So there is no reason for a seperate
header file.
