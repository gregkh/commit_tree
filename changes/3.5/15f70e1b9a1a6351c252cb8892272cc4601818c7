pinctrl: fix signed vs unsigned conditionals inside pinmux_map_to_setting

pinmux_map_to_setting() uses setting->data.mux.func/group to store the return
code of pinmux_func_name_to_selector/pinctrl_get_group_selector(). However,
struct pinctrl_setting_mux defines these elements as unsigned, resulting in all
error codes getting lost. The conditionals following the assignments will always
evaluate to false thus breaking the error paths.

This bug can be triggered by loading a pinmux group map from the devicetree
with an invalid function/group string.
