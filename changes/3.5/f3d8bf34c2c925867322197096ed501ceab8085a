usb: gadget: at91_udc: convert to new style start/stop interface

This patches converts the driver into the new style start/stop interface.
As a result the driver no longer uses the static global controller
variable in start/stop functions. I kept the controller variable since it
makes the init code a little simpler.
Compile tested only.
