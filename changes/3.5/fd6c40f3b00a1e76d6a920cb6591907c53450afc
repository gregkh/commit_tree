powerpc: Better scheduling of CR save code in system call path

At the moment system call entry looks like:

crclr	so
...
mfcr	r9
...
std	r9,_CCR(r1)

commit bd19c8994a82 ([POWERPC] system call micro optimisation) put
some space between the crclr and mfcr in order to avoid a stall.

There is still a stall seen between the mfcr and std. We can avoid
the crclr by doing it in a GPR with rlwinm which gives us more room
to better schedule the sequence.
