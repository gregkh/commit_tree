sparc32: add ucmpdi2

Based on copy from microblaze add ucmpdi2 implementation.
This fixes build of niu driver which failed with:

drivers/built-in.o: In function `niu_get_nfc':
niu.c:(.text+0x91494): undefined reference to `__ucmpdi2'

This driver will never be used on a sparc32 system,
but patch added to fix build breakage with all*config builds.
