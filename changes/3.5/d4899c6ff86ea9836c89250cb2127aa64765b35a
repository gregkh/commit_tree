staging: comedi: Add helper macro for comedi pci driver boilerplate

Introduce the module_comedi_pci_driver macro, and the
associated register/unregister functions, which is a
convenience macro for comedi pci driver modules similar
to module_platform_driver. It is intended to be used by
drivers where the init/exit section does nothing but
register/unregister the comedi driver and associated pci
driver. By using this macro it is possible to eliminate
a few lines of boilerplate code per comedi pci driver.

Add a check to make sure that the pci_driver->name is
set. Once all the comedi pci drivers have been fixed this
will be removed.

Also, when registering the pci driver check for failure
and unregister the comedi driver.
