x86, efi; Add EFI boot stub console support

We need a way of printing useful messages to the user, for example
when we fail to open an initrd file, instead of just hanging the
machine without giving the user any indication of what went wrong. So
sprinkle some error messages throughout the EFI boot stub code to make
it easier for users to diagnose/report problems.
