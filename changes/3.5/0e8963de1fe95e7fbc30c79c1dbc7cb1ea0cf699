serial: sh-sci: Fix for port types without BRI interrupts.

In doing the evt2irq() + muxed vector conversion for various port types
it became apparent that some of the legacy port types will presently
error out due to the irq requesting logic attempting to acquire the
non-existent BRI IRQ. This adds some sanity checks to the request/free
path to ensure that non-existence of a source in itself is not an error.

This should restore functionality for legacy PORT_SCI ports.
