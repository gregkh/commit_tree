ext4: don't trash state flags in EXT4_IOC_SETFLAGS

In commit 353eb83c we removed i_state_flags with 64-bit longs, But
when handling the EXT4_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl, we replace i_flags
directly, which trashes the state flags which are stored in the high
32-bits of i_flags on 64-bit platforms.  So use the the
ext4_{set,clear}_inode_flags() functions which use atomic bit
manipulation functions instead.
