clk: declare clk_ops of basic clks in clk-provider.h

Besides the static initialization, the clk_ops of basic clks could
also be used by particular clk type being subclass of the basic clks.

For example, clk_busy_divider has the same clk_ops as clk_divider,
except it has to wait for a busy bit before return success with
.set_rate.  clk_busy_divider will somehow reuse clk_ops of clk_divider.

Since clk-provider.h is included by clk-private.h, it's safe to move
those clk_ops declaration of basic clks form  clk-private.h into
clk-provider.h, so that implementation of clks like clk_busy_divider
above do not need to include clk-private.h to access those clk_ops.
