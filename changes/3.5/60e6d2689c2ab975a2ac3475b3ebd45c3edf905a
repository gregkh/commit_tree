staging: evict abandoned 68360serial.c driver from the kernel

commit 3a0db7215c88077b61a673215756ec4a0dc0c7a5

    "TTY: serial, move 68360 driver to staging"

did so because the driver had remained broken since 2008.  It also
added this text to the TODO file:

   "If no one steps up to adopt any of these drivers, they will
    be removed in the 3.4 release."

A quick search on the internet doesn't reveal anyone actively
trying to update/fix this driver, so follow through on the above
and remove it from the pending 3.4 release.
