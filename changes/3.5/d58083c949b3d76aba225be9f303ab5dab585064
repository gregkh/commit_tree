[media] V4L: Add camera exposure bias control

The camera may in some conditions incorrectly determine the exposure,
and a manual automatic exposure correction may be needed. This patch
adds V4L2_CID_AUTO_EXPOSURE_BIAS control which allows to add some
offset in the automatic exposure control loop, to compensate for
frame under- or over-exposure.
