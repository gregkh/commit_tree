iommu/amd: Check for the right TLP prefix bit

Unfortunatly the PRI spec changed and moved the
TLP-prefix-required bit to a different location. This patch
makes the necessary change in the AMD IOMMU driver.
Regressions are not expected because all hardware
implementing the PRI capability sets this bit to zero
anyway.
