xfs: limit specualtive delalloc to maxioffset

Speculative delayed allocation beyond EOF near the maximum supported
file offset can result in creating delalloc extents beyond
mp->m_maxioffset (8EB). These can never be trimmed during
xfs_free_eof_blocks() because they are beyond mp->m_maxioffset, and
that results in assert failures in xfs_fs_destroy_inode() due to
delalloc blocks still being present. xfstests 071 exposes this
problem.

Limit speculative delalloc to mp->m_maxioffset to avoid this
problem.
