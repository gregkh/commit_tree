i2c-s3c2410: Rework device type handling

Reorganize driver a bit to better handle device tree-based systems:

 - move machine type to driver's private structure instead of
   quering platform device variants in runtime

 - replace s3c24xx_i2c_type enum with unsigned int that holds
   bitmask with revision-specific quirks
