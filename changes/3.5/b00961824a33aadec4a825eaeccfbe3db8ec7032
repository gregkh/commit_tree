leds: add new field to led_classdev struct to save activation state

Add a new field to led_classdev to save activattion state after activate
routine is successful.  This saved state is used in deactivate routine to
do cleanup such as removing device files, and free memory allocated during
activation.  Currently trigger_data not being null is used for this
purpose.

Existing triggers will need changes to use this new field.
