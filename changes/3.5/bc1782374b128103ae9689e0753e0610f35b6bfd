Btrfs: fix missing inherited flag in rename

When we move a file into a directory with compression flag, we need to
inherite BTRFS_INODE_COMPRESS and clear BTRFS_INODE_NOCOMPRESS as well.
But if we move a file into a directory without compression flag, we need
to clear both of them.

It is the way how our setflags deals with compression flag, so keep
the same behaviour here.
