iwlwifi: move eeprom into priv

The whole code around eeprom is distributed
across whole bunch of different files, most
of which belong to the to-be-DVM code. As a
result, it is currently very hard to split
out the EEPROM code to be generic. However,
it is also quite unlikely that the current
EEPROM code will be needed by the MVM code
as that has different mechanisms to query
the EEPROM (it does so through the uCode.)

So, at least temporarily, move everything
into priv. If it becomes necessary to use
the code from MVM, we will have to split it
out, but then it's also easier since we'll
know what pieces we need.
