snmp: fix OutOctets counter to include forwarded datagrams

RFC 4293 defines ipIfStatsOutOctets (similar definition for
ipSystemStatsOutOctets):

   The total number of octets in IP datagrams delivered to the lower
   layers for transmission.  Octets from datagrams counted in
   ipIfStatsOutTransmits MUST be counted here.

And ipIfStatsOutTransmits:

   The total number of IP datagrams that this entity supplied to the
   lower layers for transmission.  This includes datagrams generated
   locally and those forwarded by this entity.

Therefore, IPSTATS_MIB_OUTOCTETS must be incremented when incrementing
IPSTATS_MIB_OUTFORWDATAGRAMS.

IP_UPD_PO_STATS is not used since ipIfStatsOutRequests must not
include forwarded datagrams:

   The total number of IP datagrams that local IP user-protocols
   (including ICMP) supplied to IP in requests for transmission.  Note
   that this counter does not include any datagrams counted in
   ipIfStatsOutForwDatagrams.
