KVM: VMX: Fix %ds/%es clobber

The vmx exit code unconditionally restores %ds and %es to __USER_DS.  This
can override the user's values, since %ds and %es are not saved and restored
in x86_64 syscalls.  In practice, this isn't dangerous since nobody uses
segment registers in long mode, least of all programs that use KVM.
