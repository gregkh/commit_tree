[media] v4l2-dev/ioctl: determine the valid ioctls upfront

Rather than testing whether an ioctl is implemented in the driver or not
every time the ioctl is called, do it upfront when the device is registered.

This also allows a driver to disable certain ioctls based on the capabilities
of the detected board, something you can't do today without creating separate
v4l2_ioctl_ops structs for each new variation.

For the most part it is pretty straightforward, but for control ioctls a flag
is needed since it is possible that you have per-filehandle controls, and that
can't be determined upfront of course.
