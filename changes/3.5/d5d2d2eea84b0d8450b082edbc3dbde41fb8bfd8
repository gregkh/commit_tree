x86/uv: Fix UV2 BAU legacy mode

The SGI Altix UV2 BAU (Broadcast Assist Unit) as used for
tlb-shootdown (selective broadcast mode) always uses UV2
broadcast descriptor format. There is no need to clear the
'legacy' (UV1) mode, because the hardware always uses UV2 mode
for selective broadcast.

But the BIOS uses general broadcast and legacy mode, and the
hardware pays attention to the legacy mode bit for general
broadcast. So the kernel must not clear that mode bit.
