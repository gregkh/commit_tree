toshiba_acpi: Only register backlight device when interface is read/write

Currently the backlight device is registered unconditionally, but many
(probably most) Toshibas either don't support HCI_LCD_BRIGHTNESS or only
support reading from it. This patch adds a test of HCI_LCD_BRIGHTNESS
during initialization and only registers the backlight device if this
interface supports both reads and writes.
