drm/i915: Clarify the semantics of tiling_changed

Rename obj->tiling_changed to obj->fence_dirty so that it is clear that
it flags when the parameters for an active fence (including the
no-fence) register are changed.

Also, do not set this flag when the object does not have a fence
register allocated currently and the gpu does not depend upon the
unfence. This case works exactly like when a tiled object lost its
fence and hence does not need additional handling for the tiling
change in the code.

v2: Use fence_dirty to better express what the flag tracks and add a few
more details to the comments to serve as a reminder of how the GPU also
uses the unfenced register slot.
