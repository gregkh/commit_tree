blkcg: add request_queue->root_blkg

With per-queue policy activation, root blkg creation will be moved to
blkcg core.  Add q->root_blkg in preparation.  For blk-throtl, this
replaces throtl_data->root_tg; however, cfq needs to keep
cfqd->root_group for !CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED.

This is to prepare for per-queue policy activation and doesn't cause
any functional difference.
