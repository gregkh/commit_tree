tracing: Remove ftrace_disable/enable_cpu()

The ftrace_disable_cpu() and ftrace_enable_cpu() functions were
needed back before the ring buffer was lockless. Now that the
ring buffer is lockless (and has been for some time), these functions
serve no purpose, and unnecessarily slow down operations of the tracer.
