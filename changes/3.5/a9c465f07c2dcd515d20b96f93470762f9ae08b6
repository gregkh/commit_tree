mtd: nand: omap: fix race condition in omap_wait()

If a context switch occurs in function omap_wait() just before the
while loop is entered, then upon return from context switch the
timeout may already have elapsed: in that case, status is never
read from NAND device, and omap_wait() returns an error.
This failure has been experimentally observed during stress tests.

This patch ensures a NAND status read is always performed before
returning, as in the generic nand_wait() function.
