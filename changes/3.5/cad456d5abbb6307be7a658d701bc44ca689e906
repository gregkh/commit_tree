drop_monitor: convert to modular building

When I first wrote drop monitor I wrote it to just build monolithically.  There
is no reason it can't be built modularly as well, so lets give it that
flexibiity.

I've tested this by building it as both a module and monolithically, and it
seems to work quite well

Change notes:

v2)
* fixed for_each_present_cpu loops to be more correct as per Eric D.
* Converted exit path failures to BUG_ON as per Ben H.

v3)
* Converted del_timer to del_timer_sync to close race noted by Ben H.
