x86/mce: Avoid reading every machine check bank register twice.

Reading machine check bank registers is slow. There is a trend of
increasing the number of banks, and the number of cores. The main section
of do_machine_check() is a serialized section where each cpu in turn
checks every bank. Even on a little two socket SandyBridge-EP system
that multiplies out as:

	2 sockets * 8 cores * 2 hyperthreads * 20 banks = 640 MSRs

We already scan the banks in parallel in mce_no_way_out() to see if there
is a fatal error anywhere in the system. If we build a cache of VALID
bits during this scan, we can avoid uselessly re-reading banks that have
no data. Note that this cache is only a hint. If the valid bit is set in a
shared bank, all cpus that share that bank will see it during the parallel
scan, but the first to find it in the sequential scan will (usually) clear
the bank.
