Umm, actually, there is noone taking care of the driver due to lack
of real hardware, and I still have some. The driver exposes bugs on
emulated/virtualized devices (mostly due to timing), but it's essential
to verify the fixes against a real hardware as well (which has been
holding back some of the fixes).
