[media] af9035: fix and enhance I2C adapter

There was a bug I2C adapter writes and reads one byte too much.
As the most I2C clients has auto-increment register addressing
this leads next register from the target register overwritten by
garbage data.

As a change remove whole register address byte usage and write
data directly to the I2C bus without saying what are register
address bytes to firmware.
