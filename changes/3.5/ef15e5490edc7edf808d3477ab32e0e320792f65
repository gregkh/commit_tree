usb: gadget: ci13xxx: don't use "advance" feature when setting address

Newer versions of the chipidea controller support the "advance" setting
of usb address, which means instead of setting it immediately, deferring
it till the status completion. Unfortunately, older versions of the
controller don't have this feature, so in order to support those too, we
simply don't use it. It's about 4 lines of extra code, and isn't in any
way critical to performance. While at it, change the return value of the
hw_usb_set_address() to void, since it can't fail in any measurable way.

With this patch, ci13xxx_udc driver works with the chipidea controller in
kirkwood (feroceon SoC), as found in, for example, sheevaplug.
