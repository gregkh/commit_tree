KVM: PPC: Emulate tw and td instructions

There are 4 conditional trapping instructions: tw, twi, td, tdi. The
ones with an i take an immediate comparison, the others compare two
registers. All of them arrive in the emulator when the condition to
trap was successfully fulfilled.

Unfortunately, we were only implementing the i versions so far, so
let's also add support for the other two.

This fixes kernel booting with recents book3s_32 guest kernels.
