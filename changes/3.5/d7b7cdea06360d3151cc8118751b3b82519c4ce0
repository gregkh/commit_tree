s390/kernel: Remove OS info init function call and diag 308 for kdump

Because of a design change for stand-alone kdump the function that
was done by the OS info init function is moved to the boot loader
code. This has two implications that are implemented by this patch:
a) The OS info init function is no longer called by the kernel
b) The diag 308 subcode 1 reset is no longer done by the kdump boot code.
   This is necessary because otherwise the operation that is done now
   by the boot loader would be reversed. For the normal kexec based
   kdump mechansim the reset is already done by the kdump trigger code
   (e.g. panic or PSW restart).
