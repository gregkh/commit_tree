usb/net: rndis: inline the cpu_to_le32() macro

The header file <linux/usb/rndis_host.h> used a number of #defines
that included the cpu_to_le32() macro to assure the result will be
in LE endianness. Inlining this into the code instead of using it
in the code definitions yields consolidation opportunities later
on as you will see in the following patches. The individual
drivers also used local defines - all are switched over to the
pattern of doing the conversion at the call sites instead.
