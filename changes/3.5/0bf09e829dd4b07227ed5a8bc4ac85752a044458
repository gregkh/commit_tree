i7core: fix ranks information at the per-channel struct

There is a flag at the per-channel struct that indicates if there are
any 4R dimm on it. The way the presence of this flag were reported
is not ok, as it might give the false idea that the channel were filled
with 2R memories:

[  580.588701] EDAC DEBUG: get_dimm_config: Ch1 phy rd1, wr1 (0x063f7431): 2 ranks, UDIMMs
[  580.588704] EDAC DEBUG: get_dimm_config: 	dimm 0 1024 Mb offset: 0, bank: 8, rank: 1, row: 0x4000, col: 0x400

(in this case, just one 1R memory is filled on channel 1)

So, use a better way to represent the per-channel ranks information.
After the patch, it will show:

[ 2002.233978] EDAC DEBUG: get_dimm_config: Ch0 phy rd0, wr0 (0x063f7431): UDIMMs
[ 2002.233982] EDAC DEBUG: get_dimm_config: 	dimm 0 1024 Mb offset: 0, bank: 8, rank: 1, row: 0x4000, col: 0x400
[ 2002.233988] EDAC DEBUG: get_dimm_config: 	dimm 1 1024 Mb offset: 4, bank: 8, rank: 1, row: 0x4000, col: 0x400

(in this case, there isn't any 4R memories)
