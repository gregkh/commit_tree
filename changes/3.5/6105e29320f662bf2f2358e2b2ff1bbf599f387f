net ipv6: Convert addrconf to use register_net_sysctl

Using an ascii path to register_net_sysctl as opposed to the slightly
awkward ctl_path allows for much simpler code.

We no longer need to malloc dev_name to keep it alive the length of our
sysctl register instead we can use a small temporary buffer on the
stack.
