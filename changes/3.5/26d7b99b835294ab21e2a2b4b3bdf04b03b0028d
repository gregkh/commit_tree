lib/test-kstrtox.c: mark const init data with __initconst instead of __initdata

As long as there is no other non-const variable marked __initdata in the
same compilation unit it doesn't hurt.  If there were one however
compilation would fail with

	error: $variablename causes a section type conflict

because a section containing const variables is marked read only and so
cannot contain non-const variables.
