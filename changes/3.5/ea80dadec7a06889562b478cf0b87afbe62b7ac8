[SCSI] Fix sd_probe_domain config problem

With CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD = n and CONFIG_PM = n, you get this compile failure:

(.text+0x4f6c77): undefined reference to `scsi_sd_probe_domain'

This was introduced by

    [SCSI] sd: limit the scope of the async probe domain

And happens because scsi_sd_probe_domain is conditionally defined but
unconditionally used.  Fix this by making the symbol unconditionally defined.
