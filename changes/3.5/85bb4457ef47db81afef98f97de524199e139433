[SCSI] ufs: Assign UTRLBAU = upper_32_ bits(UTRLD base address)

UTP Transfer request list base registers UTRLBA and UTRLBAU
must be assigned, lower-32 and upper-32 bits of UTRLD list
physical base addresses respectively.

Currently UTRLBAU is being assigned lower-32 bits of UTRLD
physical base address. This will cause an issue with
controllers that can support 64-bit addressing.

This patch correctly assigns upper-32 bits of UTRLD physical
base address to UTRLBAU.
