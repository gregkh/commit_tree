drivers: staging: vme: devices: Remove unneeded include version.h

The output of "make versioncheck" told us that:

drivers/staging/vme/devices/vme_pio2_core.c: 13 linux/version.h not needed.
drivers/staging/vme/devices/vme_pio2_gpio.c: 13 linux/version.h not needed.

If we take a look at these files, we will agree to remove it.
