x86, mtrr: Fix a type overflow in range_to_mtrr func

When boot on sun G5+ with 4T mem, see an overflow in mtrr cleanup as below.

*BAD*gran_size: 2G      chunk_size: 2G  num_reg: 10     lose cover RAM:
-18014398505283592M

This is because 1<<31 sign extended. Use an unsigned long constant to
fix it.  Useful for mem larger than or equal to 4T.

-v2: Use 64bit constant instead of explicit type conversion as suggested
by Yinghai. Description updated too.
