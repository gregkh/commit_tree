[SCSI] mpt2sas : While enabling phy, read the current port number from sas iounit page 0 instead of page 1

The port number is changing after disabling/enabling phys using the SysFS
interface This is because the firmware behavour changed where it would read
the the port number then set it to some different value even though Auto Port
Config is turned on.  With this change of behavour in FW, it is possible that
the expanders are moved from one port to another after disabling /enabling
phys. This is occuring because the port number in sas iounit page 1 is not
matching up to the current port in page 0. In order to fix this the driver is
modified to read the current port number from sas iounit page 0 instead of
page 1.  Also copy the port and phy flags over from page 0 to page 1.
