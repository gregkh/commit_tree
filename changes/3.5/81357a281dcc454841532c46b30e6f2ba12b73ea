ath9k: fix a use-after-free-bug when ath_tx_setup_buffer() fails

ath_tx_setup_buffer() can fail if there is no ath_buf left, or if mapping DMA
failed. In this case it frees the skb passed to it.
If ath_tx_setup_buffer is called from ath_tx_form_aggr, the skb is still
linked into the tid buffer list and must be dequeued before being released.
