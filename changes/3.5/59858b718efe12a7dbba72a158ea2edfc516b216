ARM: davinci: da850-evm: fix section mismatch

This fixes:
	WARNING: arch/arm/mach-davinci/built-in.o(.text+0x2d84): Section mismatch in reference from the function da850_evm_ui_expander_setup() to the (unknown reference) .init.data:(unknown)
	The function da850_evm_ui_expander_setup() references
	the (unknown reference) __initdata (unknown).
	This is often because da850_evm_ui_expander_setup lacks a __initdata
	annotation or the annotation of (unknown) is wrong.

Note this is a real issue because if the tca6416 driver only binds when
the init sections are already discarded da850_evm_ui_expander_setup is
called when da850_evm_devices might already be overwritten.
