timers: Fixup the Kconfig consolidation fallout

Sigh, I missed to check which architecture Kconfig files actually
include the core Kconfig file. There are a few which did not. So we
broke them.

Instead of adding the includes to those, we are better off to move the
include to init/Kconfig like we did already with irqs and others.

This does not change anything for the architectures using the old
style periodic timer mode. It just solves the build wreckage there.

For those architectures which use the clock events infrastructure it
moves the include of the core Kconfig file to "General setup" which is
a way more logical place than having it at random locations specified
by the architecture specific Kconfigs.
