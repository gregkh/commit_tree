staging: android: timed_output : disable the timed output device when the device is unregistered

(Life cycle of timed output device driver)

1) register the device as the timed output
2) enable() ops is called via the sysfs
   timeout > 0 : timer is activated and device is turned on
   timeout = 0 : timer is cancelled and device is off
3) unregister the timed output device if not used any more

So the registered device should be disabled explicitly when the module is removed.
('disabled' means the timer is stopped and the device is turned off)

Rather than implementing that code in each driver,
just call enable() with timeout = 0 to clean up the driver.
