i2c: Split I2C_M_NOSTART support out of I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING

Since there are uses for I2C_M_NOSTART which are much more sensible and
standard than most of the protocol mangling functionality (the main one
being gather writes to devices where something like a register address
needs to be inserted before a block of data) create a new I2C_FUNC_NOSTART
for this feature and update all the users to use it.

Also strengthen the disrecommendation of the protocol mangling while we're
at it.

In the case of regmap-i2c we remove the requirement for mangling as
I2C_M_NOSTART is the only mangling feature which is being used.
