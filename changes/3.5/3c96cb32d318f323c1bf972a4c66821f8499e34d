blkcg: drop stuff unused after per-queue policy activation update

* All_q_list is unused.  Drop all_q_{mutex|list}.

* @for_root of blkg_lookup_create() is always %false when called from
  outside blk-cgroup.c proper.  Factor out __blkg_lookup_create() so
  that it doesn't check whether @q is bypassing and use the
  underscored version for the @for_root callsite.

* blkg_destroy_all() is used only from blkcg proper and @destroy_root
  is always %true.  Make it static and drop @destroy_root.
