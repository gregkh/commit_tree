Input: request threaded-only IRQs with IRQF_ONESHOT

Since commit 1c6c69525b ("genirq: Reject bogus threaded irq requests")
threaded IRQs without a primary handler need to be requested with
IRQF_ONESHOT, otherwise the request will fail. This patch adds the
IRQF_ONESHOT to input drivers where it is missing. Not modified by
this patch are those drivers where the requested IRQ will always be a
nested IRQ (e.g. because it's part of an MFD), since for this special
case IRQF_ONESHOT is not required to be specified when requesting the
IRQ.
