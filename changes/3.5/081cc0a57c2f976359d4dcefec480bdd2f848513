ARM: dt: tegra trimslice: add RTC I2C device

According to the device's datasheet, it can support an interrupt too.
However, the existing board file doesn't specify an interrupt, and I
don't have the schematics, so I can't add an interrupts property. The
current Linux driver doesn't support anyway.
