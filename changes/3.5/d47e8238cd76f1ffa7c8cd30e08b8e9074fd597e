perf/x86-ibs: Take instruction pointer from ibs sample

Each IBS sample contains a linear address of the instruction that
caused the sample to trigger. This address is more precise than the
rip that was taken from the interrupt handler's stack. Update the rip
with that address. We use this in the next patch to implement
precise-event sampling on AMD systems using IBS.
