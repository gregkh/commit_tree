Btrfs: add tree modification log functions

The tree mod log will log modifications made fs-tree nodes. Most
modifications are done by autobalance of the tree. Such changes are recorded
as long as a block entry exists. When released, the log is cleaned.

With the tree modification log, it's possible to reconstruct a consistent
old state of the tree. This is required to do backref walking on a busy
file system.
