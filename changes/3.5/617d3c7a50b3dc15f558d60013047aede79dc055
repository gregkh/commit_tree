tipc: compress out gratuitous extra carriage returns

Some of the comment blocks are floating in limbo between two
functions, or between blocks of code.  Delete the extra line
feeds between any comment and its associated following block
of code, to be consistent with the majority of the rest of
the kernel.  Also delete trailing newlines at EOF and fix
a couple trivial typos in existing comments.

This is a 100% cosmetic change with no runtime impact.  We get
rid of over 500 lines of non-code, and being blank line deletes,
they won't even show up as noise in git blame.
