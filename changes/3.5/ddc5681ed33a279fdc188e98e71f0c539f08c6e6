x86/cache_info: Fix setup of l2/l3 ids

On some architectures (such as vSMP), it is possible to have
CPUs with a different number of cores sharing the same cache.

The current implementation implicitly assumes that all CPUs will
have the same number of cores sharing caches, and as a result,
different CPUs can end up with the same l2/l3 ids.

Fix this by masking out the shared cache bits, instead of
shifting the APICID. By doing so, it is guaranteed that the
generated cache ids are always unique.
