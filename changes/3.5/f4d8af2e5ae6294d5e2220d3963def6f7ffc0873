clk: propagate round_rate for CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT case

Need to propagate round_rate call for the clk that has no .round_rate
operation but with flag CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT set.

For example, clk_mux is a clk with no .round_rate operation.  However,
it could likely be in a clk_set_rate propagation path, saying it has
parent clk who has .round_rate and .set_rate operations.
