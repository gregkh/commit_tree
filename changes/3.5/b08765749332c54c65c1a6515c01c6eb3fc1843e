USB: ehci-tegra: remove PORT_RWC_BITS when setting USB_PORT_FEAT_ENABLE

In the SetPortFeature/USB_PORT_FEAT_ENABLE case, ehci_hub_control()
would read from status_reg, modify the value, and write the result back to
status_reg. This would clear any bits in PORT_RWC_BITS that were set in
the register. Fix this by masking these bits off before the write.

This is logically the same change as 6d5f89c "USB: EHCI: remove
PORT_RWC_BITS when clearing USB_PORT_FEAT_ENABLE", but applied to the
Tegra driver rather than the USB core.
