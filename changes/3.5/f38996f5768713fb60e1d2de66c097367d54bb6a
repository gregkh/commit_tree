xfs: reduce ilock hold times in xfs_setattr_size

We do not need the ilock for most checks done in the beginning of
xfs_setattr_size.  Replace the long critical section before starting the
transaction with a smaller one around xfs_zero_eof and an optional one
inside xfs_qm_dqattach that isn't entered unless using quotas.  While
this isn't a big optimization for xfs_setattr_size itself it will allow
pushing the ilock into xfs_zero_eof itself later.
