[media] m5mols: Refactored controls handling

This patch is a prerequisite for the new controls addition. It consolidates
the control handling code, which is moved to m5mols_controls.c and
staticized. The controls initialization is reordered to better reflect
the control clusters and make the diffs smaller when new controls are added.
To make the code easier to follow when more controls is added use separate
set function for each control.

Rewrite the image effect registers handling.
