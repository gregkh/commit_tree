ASoC: OMAP: HDMI: Expand configuration of hw_params

Expand the configuration of the hw_params to include the IEC-60958
channel status word and the CEA-861 audio infoframe. The configuration
of such structures depends on the snd_pcm_hw_params received. A
omap_dss_audio is used to pass the configuration parameters to DSS.
