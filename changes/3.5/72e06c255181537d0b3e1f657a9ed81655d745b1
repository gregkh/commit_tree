blkcg: shoot down blkio_groups on elevator switch

Elevator switch may involve changes to blkcg policies.  Implement
shoot down of blkio_groups.

Combined with the previous bypass updates, the end goal is updating
blkcg core such that it can ensure that blkcg's being affected become
quiescent and don't have any per-blkg data hanging around before
commencing any policy updates.  Until queues are made aware of the
policies that applies to them, as an interim step, all per-policy blkg
data will be shot down.

* blk-throtl doesn't need this change as it can't be disabled for a
  live queue; however, update it anyway as the scheduled blkg
  unification requires this behavior change.  This means that
  blk-throtl configuration will be unnecessarily lost over elevator
  switch.  This oddity will be removed after blkcg learns to associate
  individual policies with request_queues.

* blk-throtl dosen't shoot down root_tg.  This is to ease transition.
  Unified blkg will always have persistent root group and not shooting
  down root_tg for now eases transition to that point by avoiding
  having to update td->root_tg and is safe as blk-throtl can never be
  disabled

-v2: Vivek pointed out that group list is not guaranteed to be empty
     on return from clear function if it raced cgroup removal and
     lost.  Fix it by waiting a bit and retrying.  This kludge will
     soon be removed once locking is updated such that blkg is never
     in limbo state between blkcg and request_queue locks.

     blk-throtl no longer shoots down root_tg to avoid breaking
     td->root_tg.

     Also, Nest queue_lock inside blkio_list_lock not the other way
     around to avoid introduce possible deadlock via blkcg lock.

-v3: blkcg_clear_queue() repositioned and renamed to
     blkg_destroy_all() to increase consistency with later changes.
     cfq_clear_queue() updated to check q->elevator before
     dereferencing it to avoid NULL dereference on not fully
     initialized queues (used by later change).
