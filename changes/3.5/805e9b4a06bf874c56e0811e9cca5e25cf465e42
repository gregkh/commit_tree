[media] uvcvideo: Send control change events for slave ctrls when the master changes

This allows v4l2 control UI-s to update the inactive state (ie grey-ing
out of controls) for slave controls when the master control changes.

[Use __uvc_find_control() to find slave controls, as they're always
located in the same entity as the corresponding master control]
