Btrfs: support root level changes in __resolve_indirect_ref

With the tree mod log, we can have a tree that's two levels high, but
btrfs_search_old_slot may still return a path with the tree root at level
one instead. __resolve_indirect_ref must care for this and accept parents in
a lower level than expected.
