iwlwifi: improve TX cache footprint

Having cmd[], meta[] and skbs[] as separate arrays
in the TX queue structure is cache inefficient as
we need the data for a given entry together.

To improve this, create an array with these three
members (allocate meta as part of that struct) so
we have the data we need together located together
improving cache footprint.

The downside is that we need to allocate a lot of
memory in one chunk, about 10KiB (on 64-bit) which
isn't very efficient.
