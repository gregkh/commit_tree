Btrfs: abort the transaction if the commit fails

If a transaction commit fails we don't abort it so we don't set an error on
the file system.  This patch fixes that by actually calling the abort stuff
and then adding a check for a fs error in the transaction start stuff to
make sure it is caught properly.  Thanks,
