Btrfs: finish ordered extents in their own thread

We noticed that the ordered extent completion doesn't really rely on having
a page and that it could be done independantly of ending the writeback on a
page.  This patch makes us not do the threaded endio stuff for normal
buffered writes and direct writes so we can end page writeback as soon as
possible (in irq context) and only start threads to do the ordered work when
it is actually done.  Compression needs to be reworked some to take
advantage of this as well, but atm it has to do a find_get_page in its endio
handler so it must be done in its own thread.  This makes direct writes
quite a bit faster.  Thanks,
