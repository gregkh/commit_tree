timekeeping: Provide hrtimer update function

To finally fix the infamous leap second issue and other race windows
caused by functions which change the offsets between the various time
bases (CLOCK_MONOTONIC, CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_BOOTTIME) we need a
function which atomically gets the current monotonic time and updates
the offsets of CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_BOOTTIME with minimalistic
overhead. The previous patch which provides ktime_t offsets allows us
to make this function almost as cheap as ktime_get() which is going to
be replaced in hrtimer_interrupt().
