drm/i915: extract __wait_seqno from i915_wait_request

i915_wait_request is actually a fairly large function encapsulating
quite a few different operations. Because being able to wait on seqnos
in various conditions is useful, extracting that bit of code to a helper
function seems useful

v2: pull the irq_get/put as well (Ben)
