PM / Domains: Fix computation of maximum domain off time

The default domain power off governor function for generic PM
domains, default_power_down_ok(), may violate subdomain maximum
off time limit by allowing the master domain to be off for too
long.  Namely, it only finds the minium of all device maximum
off times over the domain's devices and uses that to compute the
domain's maximum off time, but it should do the same for the
subdomains.

Fix this problem by modifying default_power_down_ok() to compute
the given domain's maximum off time as the difference between the
minimum off time over all devices and subdomains in the domain and
its power on latency.
