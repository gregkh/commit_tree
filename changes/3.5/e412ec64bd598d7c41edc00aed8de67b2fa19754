ASoC: OMAP: HDMI: Update the platform device names

In order to utilize the new OMAP HDMI codec and the updated name of
the device of the CPU DAI, update the names at the drivers accordingly.

While there, also update the name of the machine driver to be more
generic and encompass more OMAP processors featuring HDMI and not
only OMAP4.
