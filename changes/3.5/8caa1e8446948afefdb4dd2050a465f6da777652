cxgb4: Common platform specific changes for DB Drop Recovery

Add platform-specific callback functions for interrupts.  This is
needed to do a single read-clear of the CAUSE register and then call
out to platform specific functions for DB threshold interrupts and DB
drop interrupts.

Add t4_mem_win_read_len() - mem-window reads for arbitrary lengths.
This is used to read the CIDX/PIDX values from EC contexts during DB
drop recovery.

Add t4_fwaddrspace_write() - sends addrspace write cmds to the fw.
Needed to flush the sge eq context cache.
