drm/i915: Fix PCH PLL assertions to not assume CRTC:PLL relationship

The existing assertions were written under the assumption that we wanted
to test the related PLL to a CRTC. With the split of PLL into a
separately managed entity which may be shared amongst CRTCs, we need to
pass in both the CRTC and the PLL to the assertion routine.
Occassionally, this means passing NULL for the CRTC as we wish to check
the status of the PLL irrespective of the current CRTC.
