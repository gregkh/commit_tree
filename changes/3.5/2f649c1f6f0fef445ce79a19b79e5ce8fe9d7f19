    [PARISC] fix PA1.1 oops on boot

Didn't quite fix the crash on boot.  It moved it from PA1.1 processors to
PA2.0 narrow kernels.  The final fix is to make sure the [id]tlb_miss_20 paths
also work.  Even on narrow systems, these paths require using the wide
instructions becuase the tlb insertion format is wide.  Fix this by
conditioning the dep[wd],z on whether we're being called from _11 or _20[w]
paths.
