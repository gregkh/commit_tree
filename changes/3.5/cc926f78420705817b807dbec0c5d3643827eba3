memcg: move charges to root cgroup if use_hierarchy=0

Presently, at removal of cgroup, ->pre_destroy() is called and moves
charges to the parent cgroup.  A major reason for returning -EBUSY from
->pre_destroy() is that the 'moving' hits the parent's resource
limitation.  It happens only when use_hierarchy=0.

Considering use_hierarchy=0, all cgroups should be flat.  So, no one
cannot justify moving charges to parent...parent and children are in flat
configuration, not hierarchical.

This patch modifes the code to move charges to the root cgroup at
rmdir/force_empty if use_hierarchy==0.  This will much simplify rmdir()
and reduce error in ->pre_destroy.
