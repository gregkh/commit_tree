drm/i915: detect PCH encoders on Haswell

On Haswell, the recommended PCH-connected output is the one driven by DDI
E in FDI mode, used for VGA connection. All the others are handled by the
CPU.

Note that this does not accounts for Haswell/PPT combination yet, so if we
encounter such combination an error message is thrown to indicate that
things could go wrong.

v2: improve non-LPT detection warning per Daniel Vetter's suggestion.
