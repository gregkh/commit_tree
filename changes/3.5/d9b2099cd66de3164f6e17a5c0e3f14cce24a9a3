USB: Refactor code to set LPM support flag.

Refactor the code that sets the usb_device flag to indicate the device
support link power management (lpm_capable).  The current code sets
lpm_capable unconditionally if the USB devices have a USB 2.0 Extended
Capabilities Descriptor.  USB 3.0 devices can also have that descriptor,
but the xHCI driver code that uses lpm_capable will not run the USB 2.0
LPM test for devices under the USB 3.0 roothub.  Therefore, it's fine
only set lpm_capable for high speed devices in this refactoring.
