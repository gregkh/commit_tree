rcu: Fixes to rcutorture error handling and cleanup

The rcutorture initialization code ignored the error returns from
rcu_torture_onoff_init() and rcu_torture_stall_init().  The rcutorture
cleanup code failed to NULL out a number of pointers.  These bugs will
normally have no effect, but this commit fixes them nevertheless.
