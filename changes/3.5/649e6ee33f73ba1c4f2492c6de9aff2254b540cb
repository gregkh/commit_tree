printk() - restore timestamp printing at console output

The output of the timestamps got lost with the conversion of the
kmsg buffer to records; restore the old behavior.

Document, that CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME now only controls the output of
the timestamps in the syslog() system call and on the console, and
not the recording of the timestamps.
