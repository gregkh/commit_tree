dma-buf: add vmap interface

The main requirement I have for this interface is for scanning out
using the USB gpu devices. Since these devices have to read the
framebuffer on updates and linearly compress it, using kmaps
is a major overhead for every update.

v2: fix warn issues pointed out by Sylwester Nawrocki.

v3: fix compile !CONFIG_DMA_SHARED_BUFFER and add _GPL for now
