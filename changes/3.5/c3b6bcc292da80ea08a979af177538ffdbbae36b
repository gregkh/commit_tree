ALSA: hda - Fix concurrent hash accesses

The amp and caps hashes aren't protected properly for concurrent
accesses.  Protect them via a new mutex now.

But it can't be so simple as originally thought: since the update of a
hash table entry itself might trigger the power-up sequence which
again accesses the hash table, we can't cover the whole function
simply via mutex.  Thus the update part has to be split from the mutex
and revalidated.
