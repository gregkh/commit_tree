ASoC: core: Bind DAIs to CODECs at registration time

We should always have a CODEC already there when registering a CODEC DAI
and for CODEC<->CODEC links a dai_link will have two CODECs so it's much
simpler to do things at registration time.

This results in a slight change in the error handling for failed CODEC
DAI registrations but practically speaking these are never supposed to
fail so there shouldn't be much issue. The change is that we don't fail
the overall CODEC registration if the DAI registration fails; this seems
more robust anyway as we may not need to use a given DAI in a particular
system.
