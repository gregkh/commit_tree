i2c: Dynamically assign adapter id if it wasn't explictly specified

Commit 488bf314b ("i2c: Allow i2c_add_numbered_adapter() to assign a
bus id") reworked i2c_add_numbered_adapter() to call i2c_add_adapter()
if requested bus was -1.

This allows to simplify driver's initialization procedure by using
just one function for static and dynamic adapter id registration.

This patch updates few more drivers (missed out in original patch)
to use this functionality.
