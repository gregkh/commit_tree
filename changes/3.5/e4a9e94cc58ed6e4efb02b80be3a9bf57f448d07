OMAPDSS: DSI: implement generic DSI pin config

In preparation for device tree, this patch changes how the DSI pins are
configured. The current configuration method is only doable with board
files and the configuration data is OMAP specific.

This patch moves the configuration data to the panel's platform data,
and the data can easily be given via DT in the future. The configuration
data format is also changed to a generic one which should be suitable
for all platforms.

The new format is an array of pin numbers, where the array items start
from clock + and -, then data1 + and -, and so on. For example:

{
	0,	// pin num for clock lane +
	1,	// pin num for clock lane -
	2,	// pin num for data1 lane +
	3,	// pin num for data1 lane -
	...
}

The pin numbers are translated by the DSI driver and used to configure
the hardware appropriately.
