drm/i915: reject doubleclocked cea modes on dp

These are ultra-low-res modes used to upscale SDTV content and we
don't know how to support these on dp on intel hw:

- And the pixel repeat setting that work for hdmi/sdvo explicitly
  don't work for dp.

So don't bother and just reject these modes. These modes have been
