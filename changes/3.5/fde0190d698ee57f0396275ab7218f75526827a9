OMAP4: twl-common: Add twl6030 V1V8, V2V1 SMPS common configuration

V1V8 supply from twl6030 commonly used as VIO for the machine.
V2V1 is adviced to supply the twl6040, and also to feed the twl6030's
VCXIO_IN, and VDAC_IN inputs.
Create the common regulator configurations for these regulators:
Make the V2V1 as supply_regulator for VCXIO, VDAC.
Add twl6040 (1-004b) as consumer for V1V8, and V2V1.
