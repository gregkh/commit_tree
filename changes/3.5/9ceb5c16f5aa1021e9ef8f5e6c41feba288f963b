drivers/message/fusion: use pci_dev->revision

This driver uses PCI_CLASS_REVISION instead of PCI_REVISION_ID, so it
wasn't converted by 44c10138fd4bbc ("PCI: Change all drivers to use
pci_device->revision").

In one case, it even reads PCI revision ID without using it -- that code
is now removed...
