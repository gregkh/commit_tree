md/bitmap: add new 'space' attribute for bitmaps.

If we are to allow bitmaps to be resized when the array is resized,
we need to know how much space there is.

So create an attribute to store this information and set appropriate
defaults.

It can be set more precisely via sysfs, or future metadata extensions
may allow it to be recorded.
