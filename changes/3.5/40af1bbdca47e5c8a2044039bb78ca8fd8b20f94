mm: correctly synchronize rss-counters at exit/exec

mm->rss_stat counters have per-task delta: task->rss_stat.  Before
changing task->mm pointer the kernel must flush this delta with
sync_mm_rss().

do_exit() already calls sync_mm_rss() to flush the rss-counters before
committing the rss statistics into task->signal->maxrss, taskstats,
audit and other stuff.  Unfortunately the kernel does this before
calling mm_release(), which can call put_user() for processing
task->clear_child_tid.  So at this point we can trigger page-faults and
task->rss_stat becomes non-zero again.  As a result mm->rss_stat becomes
inconsistent and check_mm() will print something like this:

| BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff88020813c380 idx:1 val:-1
| BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff88020813c380 idx:2 val:1

This patch moves sync_mm_rss() into mm_release(), and moves mm_release()
out of do_exit() and calls it earlier.  After mm_release() there should
be no pagefaults.
