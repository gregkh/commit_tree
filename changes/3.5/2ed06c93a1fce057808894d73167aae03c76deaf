drm/i915/intel_i2c: gmbus disabled and reserved ports are invalid

There is no GMBUS "disabled" port 0, nor "reserved" port 7.
For the other 6 ports there is a fixed 1:1 mapping between pin pairs and
gmbus ports, which means every real gmbus port has a gpio pin.

Given these realizations, clean up gmbus initialization.

Tested on Sandybridge (gen 6, PCH == CougarPoint) hardware.
