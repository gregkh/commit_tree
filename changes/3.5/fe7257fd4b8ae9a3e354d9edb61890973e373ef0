xfs: do not write the buffer from xfs_qm_dqflush

Instead of writing the buffer directly from inside xfs_qm_dqflush return it
to the caller and let the caller decide what to do with the buffer.  Also
remove the pincount check in xfs_qm_dqflush that all non-blocking callers
already implement and the now unused flags parameter and the XFS_DQ_IS_DIRTY
check that all callers already perform.
