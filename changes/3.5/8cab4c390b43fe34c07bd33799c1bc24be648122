NFS: Refactor nfs_get_client(): initialize nfs_client

Clean up: Continue to rationalize the locking in nfs_get_client() by
moving the logic that handles the case where a matching server IP
address is not found.

When we support server trunking detection, client initialization may
return a different nfs_client struct than was passed to it.  Change
the synopsis of the init_client methods to return an nfs_client.

The client initialization logic in nfs_get_client() is not much more
than a wrapper around ->init_client.  It's simpler to keep the little
bits of error handling in the version-specific init_client methods.

No behavior change is expected.
