batman-adv: add broadcast duplicate check

When multiple backbone gateways relay the same broadcast from the
backbone into the mesh, other nodes in the mesh may receive this
broadcast multiple times. To avoid this, the crc checksums of
received broadcasts are recorded and new broadcast packets with
the same content may be dropped if received by another gateway.
