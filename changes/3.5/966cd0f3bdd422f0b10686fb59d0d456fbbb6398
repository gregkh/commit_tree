KVM: PPC: Ignore unhalt request from kvm_vcpu_block

When running kvm_vcpu_block and it realizes that the CPU is actually good
to run, we get a request bit set for KVM_REQ_UNHALT. Right now, there's
nothing we can do with that bit, so let's unset it right after the call
again so we don't get confused in our later checks for pending work.
