KVM: PPC: Use clockevent multiplier and shifter for decrementer

Time for which the hrtimer is started for decrementer emulation is calculated
using tb_ticks_per_usec. While hrtimer uses the clockevent for DEC
reprogramming (if needed) and which calculate timebase ticks using the
multiplier and shifter mechanism implemented within clockevent layer.

It was observed that this conversion (timebase->time->timebase) are not
correct because the mechanism are not consistent.
In our setup it adds 2% jitter.

With this patch clockevent multiplier and shifter mechanism are used when
starting hrtimer for decrementer emulation. Now the jitter is < 0.5%.
