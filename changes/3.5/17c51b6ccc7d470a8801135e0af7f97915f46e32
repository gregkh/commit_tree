usb/net: rndis: merge media type definitions

Let's have a unified table of RNDIS media. We used to have a similar
table with NDIS_* prefix from the gadget driver, but since we're only
using RNDIS in the kernel (IIRC NDIS, non-remote, is for the windows-
internal network drivers so what do we care) let's prefix everything
with RNDIS. Some of the definitions were conflicting, in one of the
defines 0x0B is bearer "CO WAN" and in two others "BPC". Well I took
the majority vote. Two definition of medium 0x09 calls it "wireless
WAN" but one vote for "wireless LAN" but in this case I am sticking
with the minority, "Wide Area Network" does not make much sense in
this case as far as I can tell.

NOTE: latin singular and plural is so screwed up in these defines
that it makes my eyes bleed. But I will not attempt to submit a
patch converting all use of _MEDIA_ to _MEDIUM_ while I can probably
tell from the semantics of the code that RNDIS_MEDIA_STATE_CONNECTED
is most probably (erroneously) referring to a singular, unless it
can return an array of connected media. I suspect these erroneous
plurals are used in documentation and such so I don't want to
mess around with things for no functional change.
