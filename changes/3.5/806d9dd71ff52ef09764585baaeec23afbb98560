Extcon: support multiple states at a device.

One switch device (e.g., MUIC(MAX8997, MAX77686, ...), and some 30-pin
devices) may have multiple cables attached. For example, one
30-pin port may inhabit a USB cable, an HDMI cable, and a mic.
Thus, one switch device requires multiple state bits each representing
a type of cable.

For such purpose, we use the 32bit state variable; thus, up to 32
different type of cables may be defined for a switch device. The list of
possible cables is defined by the array of cable names in the switch_dev
struct given to the class.
