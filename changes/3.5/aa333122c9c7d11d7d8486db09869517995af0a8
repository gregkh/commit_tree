[media] s5p-fimc: Reinitialize the pipeline properly after VIDIOC_STREAMOFF

This patch prevents blocking on DQBUF at a video capture node in some
conditions, after STREAOMOFF/STREAMON sequence. The ST_CAPT_SUSPEND
flag should not be set during normal stream off, otherwise the
capture engine is not properly enabled at stream on.
