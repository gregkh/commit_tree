blkcg: fix blkg_alloc() failure path

When policy data allocation fails in the middle, blkg_alloc() invokes
blkg_free() to destroy the half constructed blkg.  This ends up
calling pd_exit_fn() on policy datas which didn't go through
pd_init_fn().  Fix it by making blkg_alloc() call pd_init_fn()
immediately after each policy data allocation.
