[SCSI] mpt2sas: Fix for hard drive going OFFLINE when hard reset issued and simultaneously another hard drive is hot unplugged

Following the host reset, the firmware discovery is reassigning another hard
drive in the topology to the same device handle as that device is getting hot
removed. Until the driver device removal routine is called, there will be two
hard drive with the matching device handle in the internal device link
list. In the device removal routine, a separate function which moves the
device from BLOCKED into OFFLINE state.  Since this routine is passed with the
device handle passed as input parameter, the routine will be traversing the
internal device link list searching for matching device handle. This results
in two devices with matching device handle, therefore both devices goes
OFFLINE.

To fix this issue,the input parameter is changed from device handle to SAS
address, therefore only the device that is hot unplugged will be placed in
OFFLINE state.
