usb:hsotg:samsung: Rename s3c_hsotg_disconnect function

The s3c_hsotg_disconnect_irq function has been renamed to
reflect, that it can be used not only during the host
disconnect irq.

The s3c_hsotg_disconnect shall be used as a fall back for
scenario when USB cable is unplugged and plugged to the
device.
