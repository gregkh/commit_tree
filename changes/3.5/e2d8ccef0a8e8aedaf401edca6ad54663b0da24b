staging: android-alarm: Convert ALARM_ELAPSED_REALTIME to use CLOCK_BOOTTIME

The ALARM_ELAPSED_REALTIME clock domain in Android pointed
to the need for something similar in linux system-wide
(instead of limited to just the alarm interface).

Thus CLOCK_BOOTTIME was introduced into the upstream kernel
in 2.6.39.

This patch attempts to convert the android alarm timer to utilize
the kernel's CLOCK_BOOTTIME clockid for ALARM_ELAPSED_REALTIME,
instead of managing it itself.
