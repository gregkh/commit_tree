net: delete all instances of special processing for token ring

We are going to delete the Token ring support.  This removes any
special processing in the core networking for token ring, (aside
from net/tr.c itself), leaving the drivers and remaining tokenring
support present but inert.

The mass removal of the drivers and net/tr.c will be in a separate
commit, so that the history of these files that we still care
about won't have the giant deletion tied into their history.
