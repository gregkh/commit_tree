alarmtimer: Provide accessor to alarmtimer rtc device

The Android alarm interface provides a settime call that sets both
the alarmtimer RTC device and CLOCK_REALTIME to the same value.

Since there may be multiple rtc devices, provide a hook to access the
one the alarmtimer infrastructure is using.
