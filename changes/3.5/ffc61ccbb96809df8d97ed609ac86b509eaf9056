Initialise mid_q_entry before putting it on the pending queue

A user reported a crash in cifs_demultiplex_thread() caused by an
incorrectly set mid_q_entry->callback() function. It appears that the
callback assignment made in cifs_call_async() was not flushed back to
memory suggesting that a memory barrier was required here. Changing the
code to make sure that the mid_q_entry structure was completely
initialised before it was added to the pending queue fixes the problem.
