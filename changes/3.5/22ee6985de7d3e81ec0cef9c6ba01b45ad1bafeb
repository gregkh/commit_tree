Btrfs: check to see if the inode is in the log before fsyncing

We have this check down in the actual logging code, but this is after we
start a transaction and all that good stuff.  So move the helper
inode_in_log() out so we can call it in fsync() and avoid starting a
transaction altogether and just exit if we've already fsync()'ed this file
recently.  You would notice this issue if you fsync()'ed a file over and
over again until the transaction committed.  Thanks,
