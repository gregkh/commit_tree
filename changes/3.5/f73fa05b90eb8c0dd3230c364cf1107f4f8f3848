serial8250: Introduce serial8250_register_8250_port()

Introduce yet another 8250 registration function.
This time it is serial8250_register_8250_port() and it
allows us to register 8250 hardware instances using struct
uart_8250_port. The new function makes it possible to
register 8250 hardware that makes use of 8250 specific
callbacks such as ->dl_read() and ->dl_write().
