drm/i915: add rc6 residency times to debugfs

RC6 residency should be in intervals of 1.28us, and the counter wraps.
Here is an example using awk to get the various RC6 and RC6+ residency
times in seconds, since boot.

cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_drpc_info  | grep residency | awk -F':' -F' '  '{print $5 * 1.28 / 1000000}'

This is primarily for QA, but has other applications as well. An
upcoming patch to add interfaces should be more interesting to
application developers.

v2: move comment to the correct place

v3: display with %u instead of %d, for Ouping
