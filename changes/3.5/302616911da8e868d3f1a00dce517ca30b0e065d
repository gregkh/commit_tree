x86: Drop obsolete ARCH_BOOTMEM support

x86 unconditionally uses NO_BOOTMEM so there is no use
of the HAVE_ARCH_BOOTMEM support as mm/bootmem.c is the
only file referencing this symbol.

bootmem_arch_preferred_node() is the function referred
in the mm/bootmem.c code and can thuis be dropped too.

x86 was the sole user of HAVE_ARCH_BOOTMEM - so there is
an opportunity to clean up a little in mm/bootmem.c too
if we do not expect other users to emerge.
