UBI: remove Kconfig debugging option

This patch kills the UBI debugging Kconfig option completely and makes all the
debugging stuff to be always compiled-in. It was pain in the neck to maintain
this useless option because all users I am aware of have debugging enabled
anyway - how else will you diagnose errors otherwise?
