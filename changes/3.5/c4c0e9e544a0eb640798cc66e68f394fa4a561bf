mm, mempolicy: fix mbind() to do synchronous migration

If the range passed to mbind() is not allocated on nodes set in the
nodemask, it migrates the pages to respect the constraint.

The final formal of migrate_pages() is a mode of type enum migrate_mode,
not a boolean.  do_mbind() is currently passing "true" which is the
equivalent of MIGRATE_SYNC_LIGHT.  This should instead be MIGRATE_SYNC
for synchronous page migration.
