ext4: use consistent ssize_t type in ext4_file_write()

The generic_file_aio_write() function returns ssize_t, and
ext4_file_write() returns a ssize_t, so use a ssize_t to collect the
return value from generic_file_aio_write().  It shouldn't matter since
the VFS read/write paths shouldn't allow a read greater than MAX_INT,
but there was previously a bug in the AIO code paths, and it's best if
we use a consistent type so that the return value from
generic_file_aio_write() can't get truncated.
