ASoC: wm_hubs: Enable class W for output mixer paths

Class W can be used for any path where only data from the DAC is routed
to the headphones. Currently we only enable it when the direct DAC to
headphone path is used but it can also be enabled for paths that go via
the output mixer providing the DAC is the only input to the output mixer.
Implement support for this, including updates to the class W status when
the output mixer configuration is changed. This also allows us to enable
the DC servo optimisations for DAC to headphone paths where the output
mixer is used.

In general the direct DAC path is still preferred as this will offer
better performance on most wm_hubs devices but these additional paths
can simplify use case management.
