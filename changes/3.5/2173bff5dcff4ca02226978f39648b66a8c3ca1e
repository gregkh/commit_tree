ipv6: Fix 'inet6_rtm_getroute' to release 'rt->dst' in case of 'alloc_skb' failure

In 72331bc [ipv6: Fix RTM_GETROUTE's interpretation of RTA_IIF to be
consistent with ipv4] the code of 'inet6_rtm_getroute()' was re-ordered
such that the reference to 'rt->dst' is incremented prior skb
allocation.

Hence, if 'alloc_skb()' fails, must drop a reference from 'rt->dst'.
Add the missing 'dst_release()' call.
