Revert "drm/i915: allow PCH PWM override on IVB"

This reverts commit f82cfb6bcda164ef3a66b8c3fc549b1f9bdd09ad.

This breaks the backlight controls on my IVB asus zenbook with an eDP
panel.

I guess the right fix would be to read this bit and use either the pch
or the cpu register to frob the backlight values. But that is stuff
for -next.
