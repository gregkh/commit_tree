atl1c: refine atl1c_pcie_patch

bit PCIE_PHYMISC_FORCE_RCV_DET is only for l1c&l2c to fix WoL issue,
other chips set bit5 of REG_MASTER_CTRL --- this way could save more
power than the former, and the bit should be kept all time.
l2cb 1.x has special setting for L0S/L1
l2cb 1.x & l1d 1.x should clear Vendor Message on some platforms,
otherwise it will cause the root complex hang.
