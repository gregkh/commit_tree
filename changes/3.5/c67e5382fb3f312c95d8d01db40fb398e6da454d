init: disable sparse checking of the mount.o source files

The init/mount.o source files produce a number of sparse warnings of the
type:

warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
   expected char [noderef] <asn:1>*dev_name
   got char *name

This is due to the syscalls expecting some of the arguments to be user
pointers but they are being passed as kernel pointers.  This is harmless
but adds a lot of noise to a sparse build.

To limit the noise just disable the sparse checking in the relevant source
files, but still display a warning so that the user knows this has been
done.

Since the sparse checking has been disabled we can also remove the __user
__force casts that are scattered thru the source.
