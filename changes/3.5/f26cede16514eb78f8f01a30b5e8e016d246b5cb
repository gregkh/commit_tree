[media] tm6000: don't use KERNEL_VERSION

As reported by Marcos:

Now that drivers/media/video/v4l2-ioctl.c fills cap->version:
	case VIDIOC_QUERYCAP:
	{
		struct v4l2_capability *cap = (struct v4l2_capability *)arg;

		if (!ops->vidioc_querycap)
			break;

		cap->version = LINUX_VERSION_CODE;

V4L2 drivers that use video_ioctl2() shouldn't initialize it anymore.
