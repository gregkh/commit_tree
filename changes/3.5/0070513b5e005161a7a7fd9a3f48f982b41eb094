usb-storage: revert commit afff07e61a52 (Add 090c:1000 to unusal-devs)

This patch (as1560) reverts commit
afff07e61a5243e14ee3f0a272a0380cd744a8a3 (usb-storage: Add 090c:1000
to unusal-devs).  It is no longer needed, because usb-storage now
tells the sd driver to try READ CAPACITY(10) before READ CAPACITY(16)
for every USB mass-storage device.
