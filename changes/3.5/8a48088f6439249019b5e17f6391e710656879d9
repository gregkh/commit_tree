xfs: don't flush inodes from background inode reclaim

We already flush dirty inodes throug the AIL regularly, there is no reason
to have second thread compete with it and disturb the I/O pattern.  We still
do write inodes when doing a synchronous reclaim from the shrinker or during
unmount for now.
