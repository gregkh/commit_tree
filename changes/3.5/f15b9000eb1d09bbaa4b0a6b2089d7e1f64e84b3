um: Implement a custom pte_same() function

UML uses the _PAGE_NEWPAGE flag to mark pages which are not jet
installed on the host side using mmap().
pte_same() has to ignore this flag, otherwise unuse_pte_range()
is unable to unuse the page because two identical
page tables entries with different _PAGE_NEWPAGE flags would not
match and swapoff() would never return.
