rtl8192de: Clean up and fix 92D cut version constants and macros.

The previous definitions included both {B,C,D,E}_CUT_VERSION and
CHIP_92D_{C,D}_CUT with conflicting values for the C and D cut versions,
and literal hex values were used in the IS_92D_{C,D,E}_CUT macros.  So
we clean all this up and in doing so enable cut-specific code paths for
cuts C and D, which would not have been executed because the
CHIP_92D_{C,D}_CUT constants were wrong and the cut version was thus
recorded incorrectly.
