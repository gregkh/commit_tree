ASoC: wm8994: Apply volume updates with clocks enabled

Volume updates may not be acted upon if there is no clock applied when
the volume update is written. Ensure this doesn't happen by writing out
registers with volume updates after we enable each of the clocks.

There are more registers updated than before as previously we were
relying on wm_hubs to set those for controls it manages.
