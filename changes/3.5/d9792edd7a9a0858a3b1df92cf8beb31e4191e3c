rcu: Use single value to handle expedited SRCU grace periods

The earlier algorithm used an "expedited" flag combined with a "trycount"
counter to differentiate between normal and expedited SRCU grace periods.
However, the difference can be encoded into a single counter with a cutoff
value and different initial values for expedited and normal SRCU grace
periods.  This commit makes that change.
