qeth: recognize vlan devices in layer3 mode

The qeth layer3 driver is notified about IP address changes.
Changes concerning qeth driven network interfaces have to be
forwarded to the OSA-card. This includes IP addresses of VLAN
interfaces with a qeth device as base device. Function
qeth_l3_verify_vlan_dev() determines if the net_device of the
IP event belongs to a vlan device belonging to a qeth device
as real device. This function is broken starting with commit
7ff0bcf676f7ed224ce21b58c7858c8e527068b2 , which means IP
addresses of VLAN devices are no longer set at the base qeth
device. The patch repairs function qeth_l3_verify_vlan_dev().
