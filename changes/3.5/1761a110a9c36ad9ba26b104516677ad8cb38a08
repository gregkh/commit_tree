[media] Fix regression in ioctl numbering

Yuck. The VIDIOC_(TRY_)DECODER_CMD ioctls already had ioctl numbers 96 and 97,
and after merging the timings API I forgot to continue numbering from 98. So
now we have two ioctls with number 96 and two with 97.

With the new table-driver ioctl handling in v4l2-ioctl.c it is essential that
each ioctl has its own unique number, so let's fix this quickly for 3.5.
