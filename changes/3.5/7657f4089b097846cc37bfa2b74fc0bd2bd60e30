KVM: PPC: Book 3S: Fix compilation for !HV configs

Commits 2f5cdd5487 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make secondary threads more
robust against stray IPIs") and 1c2066b0f7 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make
virtual processor area registration more robust") added fields to
struct kvm_vcpu_arch inside #ifdef CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV regions,
and added lines to arch/powerpc/kernel/asm-offsets.c to generate
assembler constants for their offsets.  Unfortunately this led to
compile errors on Book 3S machines for configs that had KVM enabled
but not CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV.  This fixes the problem by moving
the offending lines inside #ifdef CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV regions.
