ARM: PCI: get rid of pci_std_swizzle()

Most PCI implementations use the standard PCI swizzle function, which
handles the well defined behaviour of PCI-to-PCI bridges which can be
found on cards (eg, four port ethernet cards.)

Rather than having almost every platform specify the standard swizzle
function, make this the default when no swizzle function is supplied.
Therefore, a swizzle function only needs to be provided when there is
something exceptional which needs to be handled.

This gets rid of the swizzle initializer from 47 files, and leaves us
with just two platforms specifying a swizzle function: ARM Integrator
and Chalice CATS.
