pinctrl: include <linux/bug.h> to prevent compile errors

Macros in <linux/pinctrl/machine.h> call ARRAY_SIZE(), the definition of
which eventually calls BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO(), which is defined in
<linux/bug.h>. Include that so that every .c file using the pinctrl macros
doesn't have to do that itself.
