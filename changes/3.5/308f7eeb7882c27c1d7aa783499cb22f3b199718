ring-buffer: Reset head page before running self test

When the ring buffer does its consistency test on itself, it
removes the head page, runs the tests, and then adds it back
to what the "head_page" pointer was. But because the head_page
pointer may lack behind the real head page (held by the link
list pointer). The reset may be incorrect.

Instead, if the head_page exists (it does not on first allocation)
reset it back to the real head page before running the consistency
tests. Then it will be put back to its original location after
the tests are complete.
