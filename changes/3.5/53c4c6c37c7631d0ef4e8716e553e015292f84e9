ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: uncomment some "excluded" hwmods

Some hwmods were commented out from the OMAP4 data, under the theory
that they shouldn't be added until drivers were ready.  But part of
the utility of the hwmod code is that it can reset and properly
initialize IP blocks that have no drivers associated with them.
Rather than commenting the links in the future hwmod data conversion
patches, discussing this with Benoit, it seems best to simply
uncomment them now.
