ALSA: hda - Remove pre_resume and post_suspend ops

Since the recent commit, the resume procedure is always performed at
the resume time.  This makes the pre_resume hack for VREF mute LED on
some HP laptops superfluous.  As this is the only user of pre_resume
(and there is no user of post_suspend) ops, let's kill them again.
