serial8250: Add dl_read()/dl_write() callbacks

Convert serial_dl_read() and serial_dl_write() from macro
to 8250 specific callbacks. This change makes it easier to
support 8250 hardware with non-standard DLL and DLM register
configurations such as Alchemy, RM9K and upcoming Emma Mobile
UART hardware.
