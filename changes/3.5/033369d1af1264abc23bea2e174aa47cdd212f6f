reiserfs: get rid of resierfs_sync_super

This patch stops reiserfs using the VFS 'write_super()' method along with the
s_dirt flag, because they are on their way out.

The whole "superblock write-out" VFS infrastructure is served by the
'sync_supers()' kernel thread, which wakes up every 5 (by default) seconds and
writes out all dirty superblock using the '->write_super()' call-back.  But the
problem with this thread is that it wastes power by waking up the system every
5 seconds, even if there are no diry superblocks, or there are no client
file-systems which would need this (e.g., btrfs does not use
'->write_super()'). So we want to kill it completely and thus, we need to make
file-systems to stop using the '->write_super()' VFS service, and then remove
it together with the kernel thread.
