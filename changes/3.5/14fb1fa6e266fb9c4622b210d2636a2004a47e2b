powerpc: Use WARN instead of dump_stack when printing EEH error backtrace

When we get an EEH error we just print a backtrace with dump_stack
which is rather cryptic. We really should print something before
spewing out the backtrace.

Also switch from dump_stack to WARN so we get more information about
the fail - what modules were loaded, what process was running etc.
This was useful information when debugging a recent EEH subsystem bug.

The standard WARN output should also get picked up by monitoring
tools like kerneloops.

The register dump is of questionable value here but I figured it was
better to use something standard and not roll my own.
