PM / Sleep: Add "prevent autosleep time" statistics to wakeup sources

Android uses one wakelock statistics that is only necessary for
opportunistic sleep.  Namely, the prevent_suspend_time field
accumulates the total time the given wakelock has been locked
while "automatic suspend" was enabled.  Add an analogous field,
prevent_sleep_time, to wakeup sources and make it behave in a similar
way.
