s390/ipl: remove builtin tape ipl code

Remove the builtin tape ipl code. If somebody really wants to create a
tape which can be ipl'ed from, then this can be achieved by using zipl.
zipl can write an ipl record to a tape device and aftwards the kernel
image must be written to tape.
The steps are described in the "Linux on System z - Device Drivers,
Features, and Commands" book (SC33-8411).
