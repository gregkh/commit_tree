genirq: Be more informative on irq type mismatch

We require that shared interrupts agree on a few flag settings. Right
now we silently return with an error code without giving any hint why
we reject it.

Make the printout unconditionally and actually useful by printing the
flags of the new and the already registered action.

Convert all printks to pr_* and use a proper prefix while at it.
