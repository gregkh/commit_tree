shmem: cleanup shmem_add_to_page_cache

shmem_add_to_page_cache() has three callsites, but only one of them wants
the radix_tree_preload() (an exceptional entry guarantees that the radix
tree node is present in the other cases), and only that site can achieve
mem_cgroup_uncharge_cache_page() (PageSwapCache makes it a no-op in the
other cases).  We did it this way originally to reflect
add_to_page_cache_locked(); but it's confusing now, so move the radix_tree
preloading and mem_cgroup uncharging to that one caller.
