[media] ati_remote: add keymap for Medion X10 OR2x remotes

Add another Medion X10 remote keymap. This is for the Medion OR2x
remotes with the Windows MCE button.

The receiver shipped with this remote has the same USB ID as the other
Medion receivers, but the name is different and is therefore used to
detect this variant.
