ipvs: remove check for IP_VS_CONN_F_SYNC from ip_vs_bind_dest

	As the IP_VS_CONN_F_INACTIVE bit is properly set
in cp->flags for all kind of connections we do not need to
add special checks for synced connections when updating
the activeconns/inactconns counters for first time. Now
logic will look just like in ip_vs_unbind_dest.
