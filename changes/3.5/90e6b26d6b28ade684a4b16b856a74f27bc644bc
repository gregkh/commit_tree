drm/i915/intel_i2c: reuse GMBUS2 value read in polling loop

Save the GMBUS2 value read while polling for state changes, and then
reuse this value when determining for which reason the loops were exited.
This is a small optimization which saves a couple of bus accesses for
memory mapped IO registers.

To avoid "assigning in if clause" checkpatch errors", use a ret variable
to store the wait_for macro return value.
