net: sh_eth: fix the condition to fix the cur_tx/dirty_rx

The following commit couldn't work if the RMCR is not set to 1.

"net: sh_eth: fix the rxdesc pointer when rx descriptor empty happens"
commit id 79fba9f51755c704c0a7d7b7f0df10874dc0a744

If RMCR is not set, the controller will clear the EDRRR after it received
a frame. In this case, the driver doesn't need to fix the value of
cur_rx/dirty_rx. The driver only needs it when the controll detects
receive descriptors are empty.
