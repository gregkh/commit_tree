clk: core: copy parent_names & return error codes

This patch cleans up clk_register and solves a few bugs by teaching
clk_register and __clk_init to return error codes (instead of just NULL)
to better align with the existing clk.h api.

Along with that change this patch also introduces a new behavior whereby
clk_register copies the parent_names array, thus allowing platforms to
declare their parent_names arrays as __initdata.
