Revert "mm: compaction: handle incorrect MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE type pageblocks"

This reverts commit 5ceb9ce6fe9462a298bb2cd5c9f1ca6cb80a0199.

That commit seems to be the cause of the mm compation list corruption
issues that Dave Jones reported.  The locking (or rather, absense
there-of) is dubious, as is the use of the 'page' variable once it has
been found to be outside the pageblock range.

So revert it for now, we can re-visit this for 3.6.  If we even need to:
as Minchan Kim says, "The patch wasn't a bug fix and even test workload
was very theoretical".
