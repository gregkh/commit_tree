[SCSI] bnx2i: Removed the reference to the netdev->base_addr

The netdev->base_addr parameter has been deprecated in the L2 bnx2
driver.  This is used by bnx2i for the BARn iomapping.

This patch will directly reference the pci_resource_start instead
of using the deprecated netdev->base_addr.

This patch is actually a critical bug fix as the 1G bnx2 driver no
longer supports the netdev->base_addr in the current kernel of the scsi
tree.  This means that Broadcom's 1G Linux iSCSI offload solution would
not work at all without this patch.
