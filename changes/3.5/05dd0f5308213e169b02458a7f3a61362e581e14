OMAPDSS: DISPC: Update Accumulator configuration for chroma plane

DISPC has two accumulator registers DISPC_VIDp_ACCU_0 and DISPC_VIDp_ACCU_1 each
with horizontal and vertical bit fields. The bit fields can take values in the
range of -1024 to 1023. Based on bit field values DISPC decides on which one out
of 8 phases the filtering starts. DISPC_VIDp_ACCU_0 is used for progressive
output and for interlaced output both DISPC_VIDp_ACCU_0 and DISPC_VIDp_ACCU_1
are used.

The current accumulator values in DISPC scaling logic for chroma plane takes
default values for all color modes and rotation types. So, the horizontal and
vertical up and downsampling accumulator bit field values have been updated for
better performance.
