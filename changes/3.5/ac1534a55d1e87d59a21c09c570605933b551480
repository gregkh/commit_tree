iommu/amd: Initialize dma_ops for hotplug and sriov devices

When a device is added to the system at runtime the AMD
IOMMU driver initializes the necessary data structures to
handle translation for it. But it forgets to change the
per-device dma_ops to point to the AMD IOMMU driver. So
mapping actually never happens and all DMA accesses end in
an IO_PAGE_FAULT. Fix this.
