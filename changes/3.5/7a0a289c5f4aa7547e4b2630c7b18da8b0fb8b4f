ASoC: ac97: Fix build due to removal of 'runtime' definition

Fix the following build error:

sound/soc/codecs/ac97.c: In function 'ac97_prepare':
sound/soc/codecs/ac97.c:33: error: 'runtime' undeclared (first use in this function)

This was caused by commit e6968a (ASoC: codecs: Remove rtd->codec usage from CODEC drivers),
which removed the 'struct snd_pcm_runtime *runtime = substream->runtime' definition.
