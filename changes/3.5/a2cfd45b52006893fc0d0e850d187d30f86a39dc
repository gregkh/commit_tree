tipc: Optimize re-initialization of configuration service

Streamlines the job of re-initializing TIPC's configuration service
when a node's network address is first assigned. Rather than destroying
the configuration server port and then recreating it, TIPC now simply
withdraws the existing {0,<0.0.0>} name publication and creates a new
{0,<Z.C.N>} name publication that identifies the node's network address
to interested subscribers.
