xhci: Add roothub code to set U1/U2 timeouts.

USB 3.0 hubs can be put into a mode where the hub can automatically
request that the link go into a deeper link power state after the link
has been idle for a specified amount of time.  Each of the new USB 3.0
link states (U1 and U2) have their own timeout that can be programmed
per port.

Change the xHCI roothub emulation code to handle the request to set the
U1 and U2 timeouts.
