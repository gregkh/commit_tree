cirrus: cs89x0: Code neatening

Just some stylings.

Use #include <linux... not #include <asm...
Convert a test and print to a printk_once.
Combine an "if (foo) { if (bar) {" to single "if (foo && bar) {"
to save an indent level.
Convert single line "if (foo) bar;" to multiple lines.
Move some braces.
Align some long lines a bit better.

Long lines and printks with KERN_ checkpatch complaints
still exist.
