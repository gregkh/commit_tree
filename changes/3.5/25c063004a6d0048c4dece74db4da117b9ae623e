drm/i915: open code gen6+ ring irqs

We can now open-code the get/put irq functions as they were just
abstracting single register definitions.

It would be nice to merge this in with the IRQ handling code... but that
is too much work for me at present. In addition I could probably
collapse this in to a lot of the Ironlake stuff, but I don't think it's
worth the potential regressions.

This patch itself should not effect functionality.
