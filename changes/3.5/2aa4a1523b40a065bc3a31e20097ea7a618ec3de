blkcg: BLKIO_STAT_CPU_SECTORS doesn't have subcounters

BLKIO_STAT_CPU_SECTORS doesn't need read/write/sync/async subcounters
and is counted by blkio_group_stats_cpu->sectors; however, it still
holds a member in blkio_group_stats_cpu->stat_arr_cpu.

Rearrange stat_type_cpu and define BLKIO_STAT_CPU_ARR_NR and use it
for stat_arr_cpu[] size so that only SERVICE_BYTES and SERVICED have
subcounters.
