cris: Remove old legacy "-traditional" flag from arch-v10/lib/Makefile

Most of these have been purged years ago.  This one silently lived
on until commit 69349c2dc01c489eccaa4c472542c08e370c6d7e

    "kconfig: fix IS_ENABLED to not require all options to be defined"

In the above, we use some macro trickery to create a conditional that
is valid in CPP and in C usage.  However that trickery doesn't sit
well if you have the legacy "-traditional" flag enabled.  You'll get:

  AS      arch/cris/arch-v10/lib/checksum.o
In file included from <command-line>:4:0:
include/linux/kconfig.h:23:0: error: syntax error in macro parameter list
make[2]: *** [arch/cris/arch-v10/lib/checksum.o] Error 1

Everything builds fine w/o "-traditional" so simply drop it from this
location as well.
