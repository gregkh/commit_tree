SUNRPC: move per-net operations from svc_destroy()

The idea is to separate service destruction and per-net operations,
because these are two different things and the mix looks ugly.

Notes:

1) For NFS server this patch looks ugly (sorry for that). But these
place will be rewritten soon during NFSd containerization.

2) LockD per-net counter increase int lockd_up() was moved prior to
make_socks() to make lockd_down_net() call safe in case of error.
