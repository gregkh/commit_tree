samples/seccomp: fix dependencies on arch macros

This change fixes the compilation error triggered here for
i386 allmodconfig in linux-next:
  http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/buildresult/6123842/

Logic attempting to predict the host architecture has been
removed from the Makefile.  Instead, the bpf-direct sample
should now compile on any architecture, but if the architecture
is not supported, it will compile a minimal main() function.

This change also ensures the samples are not compiled when
there is no seccomp filter support.

(Note, I wasn't able to reproduce the error locally, but
 the existing approach was clearly flawed.  This tweak
 should resolve your issue and avoid other future weirdness.)
