net: implement tcp coalescing in tcp_queue_rcv()

Extend tcp coalescing implementing it from tcp_queue_rcv(), the main
receiver function when application is not blocked in recvmsg().

Function tcp_queue_rcv() is moved a bit to allow its call from
tcp_data_queue()

This gives good results especially if GRO could not kick, and if skb
head is a fragment.
