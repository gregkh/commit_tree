fat: use fat_msg_ratelimit() in fat__get_entry()

If an application tries to lookup (opendir/readdir/stat) 5000 files on a
fatfs USB device and the device is unplugged, many message occur, shown
below.  This makes the application slow.  So use the new
fat_msg_ratelimit() decrease the messaging rate.
