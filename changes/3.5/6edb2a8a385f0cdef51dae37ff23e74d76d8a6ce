tracing: Clean up tracing_mark_write()

On gcc 4.5 the function tracing_mark_write() would give a warning
of page2 being uninitialized. This is due to a bug in gcc because
the logic prevents page2 from being used uninitialized, and
gcc 4.6+ does not complain (correctly).

Instead of adding a "unitialized" around page2, which could show
a bug later on, I combined page1 and page2 into an array map_pages[].
This binds the two and the two are modified according to nr_pages
(what gcc 4.5 seems to ignore). This no longer gives a warning with
gcc 4.5 nor with gcc 4.6.
