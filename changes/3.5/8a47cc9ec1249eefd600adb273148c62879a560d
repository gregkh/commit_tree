drm/radeon: rework locking ring emission mutex in fence deadlock detection v2

Some callers illegal called fence_wait_next/empty
while holding the ring emission mutex. So don't
relock the mutex in that cases, and move the actual
locking into the fence code.

v2: Don't try to unlock the mutex if it isn't locked.
