arch/tile: fix hardwall for tilegx and generalize for idn and ipi

The hardwall drain code was not properly implemented for tilegx,
just tilepro, so you couldn't reliably restart an application that
made use of the udn.

In addition, the code was only applicable to the udn (user dynamic
network).  On tilegx there is a second user network that is available
(the "idn"), and there is support for having I/O shims deliver
user-level interrupts to applications ("ipi") which functions in a
very similar way to the inter-core permissions used for udn/idn.
So this change also generalizes the code from supporting just the udn
to supports udn/idn/ipi on tilegx.

By default we now use /dev/hardwall/{udn,idn,ipi} with separate
minor numbers for the three devices.
