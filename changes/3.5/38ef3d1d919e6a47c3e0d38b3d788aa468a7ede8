batman-adv: form groups in the bridge loop avoidance

backbone gateways may be part of the same LAN, but participate
in different meshes. With this patch, backbone gateways form groups by
applying the groupid of another backbone gateway if it is higher. After
forming the group, they only accept messages from backbone gateways of
the same group.
