drm/i915: be more careful when returning -ENXIO in gmbus transfer

... flaky ddc hardware can cause a spurious NAK, resulting in the i2c
core and drm edid functions not trying to retry the edid transfer.

Luckily the gmbus quiescenting also times out for these cases, so we
can get out of this mess by returning -ETIMEDOUT for this specific
case. This way we keep the fast-fail of returning -ENXIO if there is
no device present, speeding up the boot process.

This regression has been introduced in

    drm/i915/intel_i2c: always wait for IDLE before clearing NAK

v2: Return -ETIMEDOUT for this case and keep the -ENXIO for real NAKs,
suggested by Daniel Kurtz.
