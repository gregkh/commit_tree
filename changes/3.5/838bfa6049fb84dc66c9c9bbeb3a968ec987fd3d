i2c-dev: Add support for I2C_M_RECV_LEN

As the bus driver side implementation of I2C_M_RECV_LEN is heavily
tied to SMBus, we can't support received length over 32 bytes, but
let's at least support that.

In practice, the caller will have to setup a buffer large enough to
cover the case where received length byte has value 32, so minimum
32 + 1 = 33 bytes, possibly more if there is a fixed number of bytes
added for the specific slave (for example a checksum.)
