ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: fix IVA interface clock

The OMAP3 hwmod data listed iva2_ck as an interface clock between the
IVA and L3.  This is incorrect.  iva2_ck is not an interface clock.
Since it cannot auto-idle, specifying it here prevents the IVA and at
least one of the CORE clockdomains from going idle, which causes PM
problems such as these upon system suspend:

[   70.626129] Powerdomain (iva2_pwrdm) didn't enter target state 1
[   70.626190] Powerdomain (core_pwrdm) didn't enter target state 1

Fix by specifying the actual interface clock in the hwmod data.
