perf/x86: Implement IBS event configuration

This patch implements perf configuration for AMD IBS. The IBS
pmu is selected using the type attribute in sysfs. There are two
types of ibs pmus, for instruction fetch (IBS_FETCH) and for
instruction execution (IBS_OP):

 /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ibs_fetch/type
 /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ibs_op/type

Except for the sample period IBS can only be set up with raw
config values and raw data samples. The event attributes for the
syscall should be programmed like this (IBS_FETCH):

        type = get_pmu_type("/sys/bus/event_source/devices/ibs_fetch/type");

        memset(&attr, 0, sizeof(attr));
        attr.type        = type;
        attr.sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_CPU | PERF_SAMPLE_RAW;
        attr.config      = IBS_FETCH_CONFIG_DEFAULT;

This implementation does not yet support 64 bit counters. It is
limited to the hardware counter bit width which is 20 bits. 64
bit support can be added later.
