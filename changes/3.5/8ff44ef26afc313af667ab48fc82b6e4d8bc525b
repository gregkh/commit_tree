iwlwifi: don't disable AGG queues that are not enabled

If the BA session is torn down before we had a chance to start it
we shouldn't disable the AGG tx queues that weren't enabled.
This can happen in two cases:

1) We get a delBA before we drained our Tx queues in agg start flow
2) We didn't get the (successfull) addBA response on time
