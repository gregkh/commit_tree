xfs: shutdown xfs_sync_worker before the log

Revert commit 1307bbd, which uses the s_umount semaphore to provide
exclusion between xfs_sync_worker and unmount, in favor of shutting down
the sync worker before freeing the log in xfs_log_unmount.  This is a
cleaner way of resolving the race between xfs_sync_worker and unmount
than using s_umount.
