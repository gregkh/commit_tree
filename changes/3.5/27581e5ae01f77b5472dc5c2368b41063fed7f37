md/bitmap: centralise allocation of bitmap file pages.

Instead of allocating pages in read_sb_page, read_page and
bitmap_read_sb, allocate them all in bitmap_init_from disk.

Also replace the hack of calling "attach_page_buffers(page, NULL)" to
ensure that free_buffer() won't complain, by putting a test for
PagePrivate in free_buffer().
