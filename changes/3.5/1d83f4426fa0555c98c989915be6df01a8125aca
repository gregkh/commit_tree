drm/i915: Batch copy_from_user for relocation processing

Originally the code tried to allocate a large enough array to perform
the copy using vmalloc, performance wasn't great and throughput was
improved by processing each individual relocation entry separately.
This too is not as efficient as one would desire. A compromise would be
to allocate a single page, or to allocate a few entries on the stack,
and process the copy in batches. The latter gives simpler code and more
consistent performance due to a lack of heuristic.

x11perf -copywinwin10:	n450/pnv	i3-330m		i5-2520m (cpu)
               before: 	  249000	 785000		 1280000 (80%)
                 page:	  264000	 896000		 1280000 (65%)
             on-stack:	  264000	 902000		 1280000 (67%)

v2: Use 512-bytes of stack for batching rather than allocate a page.
v3: Tidy the code slightly with more descriptive variable names
