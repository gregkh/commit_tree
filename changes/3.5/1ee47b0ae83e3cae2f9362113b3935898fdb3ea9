ARM: OMAP4: hsmmc: check for null pointer

platform_device pdev can be NULL if CONFIG_MMC_OMAP_HS is not set.
Add check for NULL pointer. while at it move the duplicated functions
to omap4-common.c

Fixes the following boot crash seen with omap4sdp and omap4panda
when MMC is disabled.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000008c
pgd = c0004000
[0000008c] *pgd=00000000
