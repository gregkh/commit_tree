blkcg: kill blkio_list and replace blkio_list_lock with a mutex

With blkio_policy[], blkio_list is redundant and hinders with
per-queue policy activation.  Remove it.  Also, replace
blkio_list_lock with a mutex blkcg_pol_mutex and let it protect the
whole [un]registration.

This is to prepare for per-queue policy activation and doesn't cause
any functional difference.
