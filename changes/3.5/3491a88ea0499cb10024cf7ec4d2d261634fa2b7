[media] [resend] radio-sf16fmr2: add PnP support for SF16-FMD2

Add PnP support to radio-sf16fmr2 driver to support SF16-FMD2 card (SB16 +
TEA5757). The driver can now handle two cards (FMR2 is hardwired to 0x384,
FMD2 can be put at 0x384 or 0x284 by PnP).
Tested with both SF16-FMR2 and SF16-FMD2 (the can work at the same time by
using kernel parameter "pnp_reserve_io=0x384,2" so the FMD2 is put at 0x284).
