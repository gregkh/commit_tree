powerpc/xmon: Use cpumask iterator to avoid warning

We have a bug report where the kernel hits a warning in the cpumask
code:

WARNING: at include/linux/cpumask.h:107

Which is:
        WARN_ON_ONCE(cpu >= nr_cpumask_bits);

The backtrace is:
        cpu_cmd
        cmds
        xmon_core
        xmon
        die

xmon is iterating through 0 to NR_CPUS. I'm not sure why we are still
open coding this but iterating above nr_cpu_ids is definitely a bug.

This patch iterates through all possible cpus, in case we issue a
system reset and CPUs in an offline state call in.

Perhaps the old code was trying to handle CPUs that were in the
partition but were never started (eg kexec into a kernel with an
nr_cpus= boot option). They are going to die way before we get into
xmon since we haven't set any kernel state up for them.
