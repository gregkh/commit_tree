mmc: core: Prevent eMMC VCC supply to be cut from late init

For eMMC cards that has been initialized from a bootloader,
the VCC voltage supply must not be cut in an uncontrolled
manner, without first sending SLEEP or POWEROFF_NOTIFY.

The regulator_init_complete late initcall, may cut the VCC
regulator if it's reference counter is zero. To be able to
prevent the regulator from being cut, mmc_start_host, which
should execute at device init and thus before late init,
calls mmc_power_up. Then the host driver is able to increase
the reference to the regulator.
