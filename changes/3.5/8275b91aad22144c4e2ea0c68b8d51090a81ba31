[PARISC] Fix parisc compile failure after smp: Add task_struct argument to __cpu_up()

commit 8239c25f47d2b318156993b15f33900a86ea5e17 added an argument to our
__cpu_up() function, but didn't notice we have an extra definition for
this in asm/smp.h resulting in a compile failure.

Fix by removing the extraneous parisc definition of __cpu_up().  While
we're at it, remove the duplicated definition of smp_send_reschedule().
