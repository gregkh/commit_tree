[SCSI] qla4xxx: Fix kernel panic during discovery logout.

Update the session and connection parameter before sending
connection logged in event to iscsiadm because in some
scenario logout may come in just after we send the logged
in event to user, which free up session, connection and ddb,
but DPC is still updating session and connect parameter
which can lead to panic.
