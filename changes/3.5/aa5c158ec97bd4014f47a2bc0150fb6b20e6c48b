xfs: kill XBF_DONTBLOCK

Just about all callers of xfs_buf_read() and xfs_buf_get() use XBF_DONTBLOCK.
This is used to make memory allocation use GFP_NOFS rather than GFP_KERNEL to
avoid recursion through memory reclaim back into the filesystem.

All the blocking get calls in growfs occur inside a transaction, even though
they are no part of the transaction, so all allocation will be GFP_NOFS due to
the task flag PF_TRANS being set. The blocking read calls occur during log
recovery, so they will probably be unaffected by converting to GFP_NOFS
allocations.

Hence make XBF_DONTBLOCK behaviour always occur for buffers and kill the flag.
