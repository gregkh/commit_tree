drm/edid: Add packed attribute to new gtf2 and cvt structs

The new structs added in struct detailed_data_monitor_range must be
marked with packed attribute although the outer struct itself is
already marked as packed.  Otherwise these 7-bytes structs may be
aligned, and give the wrong position and size for the data.
