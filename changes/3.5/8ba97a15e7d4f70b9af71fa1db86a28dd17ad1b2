Btrfs: use btrfs_read_lock_root_node in get_old_root

get_old_root could race with root node updates because we weren't locking
the node early enough. Use btrfs_read_lock_root_node to grab the root locked
in the very beginning and release the lock as soon as possible (just like
btrfs_search_slot does).
