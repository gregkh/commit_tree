mm, oom: fix and cleanup oom score calculations

The divide in p->signal->oom_score_adj * totalpages / 1000 within
oom_badness() was causing an overflow of the signed long data type.

This adds both the root bias and p->signal->oom_score_adj before doing the
normalization which fixes the issue and also cleans up the calculation.
