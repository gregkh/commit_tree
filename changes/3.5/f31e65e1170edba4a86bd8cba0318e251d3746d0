kvm/book3s: Make kernel emulated H_PUT_TCE available for "PR" KVM

There is nothing in the code for emulating TCE tables in the kernel
that prevents it from working on "PR" KVM... other than ifdef's and
location of the code.

This and moves the bulk of the code there to a new file called
book3s_64_vio.c.

This speeds things up a bit on my G5.
