staging: comedi: refactor dt3000 driver to remove forward declarations

Move the module_init/module_exit routines and the associated
struct comedi_driver and other variables to the end of the source.
This is more typical of how other drivers are written.

Also, refactor a couple of the pci helper functions used during the
attach. The removes the need for the forward declarations.
