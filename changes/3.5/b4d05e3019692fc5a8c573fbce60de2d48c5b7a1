xfs: avoid taking the ilock unnessecarily in xfs_qm_dqattach

Check if we actually need to attach a dquot before taking the ilock in
xfs_qm_dqattach.  This avoid superflous lock roundtrips for the common cases
of quota support compiled in but not activated on a filesystem and an
inode that already has the dquots attached.
