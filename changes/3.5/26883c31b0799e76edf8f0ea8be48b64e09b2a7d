drm/i915/intel_i2c: handle zero-length writes

A common method of probing an i2c bus is trying to do a zero-length write.
Handle this case by checking the length first before decrementing it.

This is actually important, since attempting a zero-length write is one
of the ways that i2cdetect and i2c_new_probed_device detect whether
there is device present on the bus with a given address.
