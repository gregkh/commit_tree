x86, realmode: fix 64-bit wakeup sequence

There were number of issues in wakeup sequence:

- Wakeup stack was placed in hardcoded address.
- NX bit in EFER was not enabled.
- Initialization incorrectly set physical address
of secondary_startup_64.
- Some alignment issues.

This patch fixes these issues and in addition:

- Unifies coding conventions in .S files.
- Sets alignments of code and data right.
