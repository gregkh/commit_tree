cfg80211: check iface combinations only when iface is running

Don't validate interface combinations on a stopped
interface. Otherwise we might end up being able to
create a new interface with a certain type, but
won't be able to change an existing interface
into that type.

This also skips some other functions when
interface is stopped and changing interface type.
