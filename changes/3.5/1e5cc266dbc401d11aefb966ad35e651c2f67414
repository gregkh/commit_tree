batman-adv: skip the window protection test when the originator has no neighbours

When we receive an OGM from from a node for the first time, the last_real_seqno
field of the orig_node structure has not been initialised yet. The value of this
field is used to compute the current ogm-seqno window and therefore the
protection mechanism will probably drop the packet due to an out-of-window error.
To avoid this situation this patch adds a check to skip the window protection
mechanism if no neighbour nodes have already been added. When the first
neighbour node is added, the last_real_seqno field is initialised too.
