ARM: Remove support for ARMv3 ARM610 and ARM710 CPUs

This patch removes support for ARMv3 CPUs, which haven't worked properly
for quite some time (see the FIXME comment in arch/arm/mm/fault.c).  The
only V3 parts left is the cache model for ARMv3, which is needed for some
odd reason by ARM740T CPUs, and being able to build with -march=armv3,
which is required for the RiscPC platform due to its bus structure.
