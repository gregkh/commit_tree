ARM: s3c64xx: Decouple lcd type from display controller window data

The display controller window data should contain window configuration data
for only one type of lcd panel. So, for real6410 and mini6410 boards, split
the existing display controller window data, which contains window
configuration data for two different types of lcd panels, into two seperate
instances and register one of them depending on the type of the lcd panel
detected at runtime.

This is a prerequisite change for a subsequent commit that reorders the
platform data of display controller by moving video interface timing out
of window setup data.
