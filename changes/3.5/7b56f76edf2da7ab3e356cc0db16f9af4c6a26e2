net: filter: Fix some minor issues in sparc JIT.

Correct conventions comments.  %o4 and %o5 were swapped,
%g3 was not documented.

Use r_TMP instead of r_SKB_DATA + r_OFF where possible in
assembler stubs.

Correct discussion of %o4 and %o5 in one of bpf_jit_compile()'s
comments.

Based upon feedback from Richard Mortimer.
