[SCSI] sg: remove sg_mutex

With the exception of the detached field, sg_mutex no longer adds any
locking.  detached handling has been broken before and is still broken
and this patch does not seem to make things worse than they were to
begin with.

However, I have observed cases of tasks being blocked for >200s waiting
for sg_mutex.  So the removal clearly adds value for very little cost.
