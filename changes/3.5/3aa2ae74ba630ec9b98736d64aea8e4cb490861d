USB: EHCI: OMAP: Finish ehci omap phy reset cycle before adding hcd.

'ARM: OMAP3: USB: Fix the EHCI ULPI PHY reset issue' (1fcb57d0f) created a regression
with Beagleboard xM if booting the kernel after running 'usb start' under u-boot.

Finishing the reset before calling 'usb_add_hcd' fixes the regression. This is most likely due to
usb_add_hcd calling the driver's reset and init functions which expect the hardware to be
up and running.
