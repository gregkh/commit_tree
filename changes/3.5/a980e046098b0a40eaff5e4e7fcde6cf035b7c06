IIO: Move the core files to drivers/iio

Take the core support + the kfifo buffer implentation out of
staging.  Whilst we are far from done in improving this subsystem
it is now at a stage where the userspae interfaces (provided by
the core) can be considered stable.

Drivers will follow over a longer time scale.
