staging/comedi: fix build for USB not enabled

Calls to optional subsystems cannot be made indiscriminately.
Enclose all of the usb helper functions inside
#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_USB)
to fix these build errors.

(The pci helper functions are OK since there are stubs in
linux/pci.h for the called functions when PCI is not enabled.
Possibly the same could be done for the called USB functions.)
