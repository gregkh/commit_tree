ipv6: Prevent access to uninitialized fib_table_hash via /proc/net/ipv6_route

/proc/net/ipv6_route reflects the contents of fib_table_hash. The proc
handler is installed in ip6_route_net_init() whereas fib_table_hash is
allocated in fib6_net_init() _after_ the proc handler has been installed.

This opens up a short time frame to access fib_table_hash with its pants
down.

fib6_init() as a whole can't be moved to an earlier position as it also
registers the rtnetlink message handlers which should be registered at
the end. Therefore split it into fib6_init() which is run early and
fib6_init_late() to register the rtnetlink message handlers.
