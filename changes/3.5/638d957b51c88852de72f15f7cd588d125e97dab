x86, realmode: Change EFER to a single u64 field

Change EFER to be a single u64 field instead of two u32 fields; change
the order to maintain alignment.  Note that on x86-64 cr4 is really
also a 64-bit quantity, although we can only set the low 32 bits from
the trampoline code since it is still executing in 32-bit mode at that
point.
