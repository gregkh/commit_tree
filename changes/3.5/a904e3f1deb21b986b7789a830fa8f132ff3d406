UBI: always dump VID and EC headers in case of errors

UBI (and UBIFS) are a bit over-engineered WRT debugging. The idea was to
link as few as possible when debugging is disabled, but the downside is
that most people produce bug reports which are difficult to understand.

Always dump the VID and EC headers' contents in case of errors when it
is helpful.
