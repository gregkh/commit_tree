KVM: Factor out kvm_vcpu_kick to arch-generic code

The kvm_vcpu_kick function performs roughly the same funcitonality on
most all architectures, so we shouldn't have separate copies.

PowerPC keeps a pointer to interchanging waitqueues on the vcpu_arch
structure and to accomodate this special need a
__KVM_HAVE_ARCH_VCPU_GET_WQ define and accompanying function
kvm_arch_vcpu_wq have been defined. For all other architectures this
is a generic inline that just returns &vcpu->wq;
