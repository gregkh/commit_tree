xfs: add trace points for log forces

To enable easy tracing of the location of log forces and the
frequency of them via perf, add a pair of trace points to the log
force functions.  This will help debug where excessive log forces
are being issued from by simple perf commands like:

# ~/perf/perf top -e xfs:xfs_log_force -G -U

Which gives this sort of output:
