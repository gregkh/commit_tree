MIPS: call set_cpu_online() on cpu being brought up with irq disabled

To prevent a problem as commit 5fbd036b [sched: Cleanup cpu_active madness]
and commit 2baab4e9 [sched: Fix select_fallback_rq() vs cpu_active/cpu_online]
try to resolve, move set_cpu_online() to the brought up CPU and with irq
disabled.
