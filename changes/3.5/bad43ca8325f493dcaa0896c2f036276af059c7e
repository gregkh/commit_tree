net: introduce skb_try_coalesce()

Move tcp_try_coalesce() protocol independent part to
skb_try_coalesce().

skb_try_coalesce() can be used in IPv4 defrag and IPv6 reassembly,
to build optimized skbs (less sk_buff, and possibly less 'headers')

skb_try_coalesce() is zero copy, unless the copy can fit in destination
header (its a rare case)

kfree_skb_partial() is also moved to net/core/skbuff.c and exported,
because IPv6 will need it in patch (ipv6: use skb coalescing in
reassembly).
