x86: replace percpu_xxx funcs with this_cpu_xxx

Since percpu_xxx() serial functions are duplicated with this_cpu_xxx().
Removing percpu_xxx() definition and replacing them by this_cpu_xxx()
in code. There is no function change in this patch, just preparation for
later percpu_xxx serial function removing.

On x86 machine the this_cpu_xxx() serial functions are same as
__this_cpu_xxx() without no unnecessary premmpt enable/disable.

Thanks for Stephen Rothwell, he found and fixed a i386 build error in
the patch.

Also thanks for Andrew Morton, he kept updating the patchset in Linus'
tree.
