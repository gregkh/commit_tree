drm/i915: Bump the inactive LRU on set-to-GTT-domain

Currently, we only bump the inactive LRU of an object when we bind
into the GTT for a page-fault. As the object may be used many times
before its mapping is zapped, we do not mark it as active as
frequently as we should. Userspace should be calling set-to-GTT-domain
before each pointer deference (for synchronous access) and so is a
good place to mark the buffer as active.

Marking the buffer as recently used places it at the end of the
inactive eviction queue, though still before anything with outstanding
rendering. This reduces the likelihood of evicting a buffer that is
going to be used again by the CPU in the near future. This way we can
hopefully avoid to kick out upload buffers right before we use them on
the gpu.

Note that we need to check that the object is not active or pinned,
for otherwise we create havoc on the active/pinned lists, which also
use obj->mm_list.

The active lists are sorted by and evicted in last GPU rendering
order, access by the CPU to a still active buffer therefore does not
affect its eviction ordering. Pinned objects are currently excluded
from eviction, therefore the only list that we need to bump for GTT
access by the CPU is the inactive list.
