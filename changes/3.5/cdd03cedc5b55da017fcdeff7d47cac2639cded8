ALSA: hda - Introduce snd_hda_set_pin_ctl*() helper functions

For setting the pin-control values more safely to match with the
actual pin capability bits, a copule of new helper functions,
snd_hda_set_pin_ctl() and snd_hda_set_pin_ctl_cache(), are
introduced.  These are simple replacement of the codec verb write with
AC_VERB_SET_PIN_WIDGET but do more sanity checks and filter out
superfluous pin-control bits if they don't fit with the corresponding
pin capabilities.

Some codecs are screwed up or ignore the command when such a wrong bit
is set.  These helpers will avoid such secret errors.
