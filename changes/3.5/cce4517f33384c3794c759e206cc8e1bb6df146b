frv: Use correct size for task_struct allocation

alloc_task_struct_node() allocates THREAD_SIZE and maintains some
weird refcount in the allocated memory. This never blew up as
task_struct size on 32bit machines was always less than THREAD_SIZE

Allocate just sizeof(struct task_struct) and get rid of the magic
refcounting.
