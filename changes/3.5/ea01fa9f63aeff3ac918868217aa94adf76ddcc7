tools: Connect to the kernel build system

Now you can do

$ make tools/<toolname>

from the toplevel kernel directory and have the respective tool built.

If you want to build and install it, do

$ make tools/<toolname>_install

$ make tools/<toolname>_clean

should clean the respective tool directories.

If you want to clean all in tools, simply do

$ make tools/clean

Also, if you want to get what the possible targets are, simply calling

$ make tools/

should give you the short help.

$ make tools/install

installs all tools, of course. Doh.
