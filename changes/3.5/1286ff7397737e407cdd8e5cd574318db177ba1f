i915: add dmabuf/prime buffer sharing support.

This adds handle->fd and fd->handle support to i915, this is to allow
for offloading of rendering in one direction and outputs in the other.

v2 from Daniel Vetter:
- fixup conflicts with the prepare/finish gtt prep work.
- implement ppgtt binding support.

Note that we have squat i-g-t testcoverage for any of the lifetime and
access rules dma_buf/prime support brings along. And there are quite a
few intricate situations here.

Also note that the integration with the existing code is a bit
hackish, especially around get_gtt_pages and put_gtt_pages. It imo
would be easier with the prep code from Chris Wilson's unbound series,
but that is for 3.6.

Also note that I didn't bother to put the new prepare/finish gtt hooks
to good use by moving the dma_buf_map/unmap_attachment calls in there
(like we've originally planned for).

Last but not least this patch is only compile-tested, but I've changed
very little compared to Dave Airlie's version. So there's a decent
chance v2 on drm-next works as well as v1 on 3.4-rc.

v3: Right when I've hit sent I've noticed that I've screwed up one
obj->sg_list (for dmar support) and obj->sg_table (for prime support)
disdinction. We should be able to merge these 2 paths, but that's
material for another patch.

v4: fix the error reporting bugs pointed out by ickle.

v5: fix another error, and stop non-gtt mmaps on shared objects
stop pread/pwrite on imported objects, add fake kmap
