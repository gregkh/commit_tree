rcu: Stop rcu_do_batch() from multiplexing the "count" variable

Commit b1420f1c (Make rcu_barrier() less disruptive) rearranged the
code in rcu_do_batch(), moving the ->qlen manipulation to follow
the requeueing of the callbacks.  Unfortunately, this rearrangement
clobbered the value of the "count" local variable before the value
of rdp->qlen was adjusted, resulting in the value of rdp->qlen being
inaccurate.  This commit therefore introduces an index variable "i",
avoiding the inadvertent multiplexing.
