i2c: muxes: rename first set of drivers to a standard pattern

Apply a naming pattern like in the rest of the subsystem to a first set
of mux drivers. Those drivers are the low-hanging fruit; we want to pick
them to motivate upcoming drivers to follow the new pattern. The missing
GPIO driver will be converted in a later patch.
