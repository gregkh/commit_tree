ACPI: Make acpi_skip_timer_override cover all source_irq==0 cases

Currently when acpi_skip_timer_override is set, it only cover the
(source_irq == 0 && global_irq == 2) cases. While there is also
platform which need use this option and its global_irq is not 2.
This patch will extend acpi_skip_timer_override to cover all
timer overriding cases as long as the source irq is 0.

This is the first part of a fix to kernel bug bugzilla 40002:
	"IRQ 0 assigned to VGA"
