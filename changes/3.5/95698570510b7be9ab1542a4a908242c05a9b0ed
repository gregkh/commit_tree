kbuild: refactor final link of sparc32

sparc32 uses an additional final link to support btfix.
Introduce a new set of exported variables in the top-level Makefile
to make the extra linking step simpler.

sparc32 has hardcoded knowledge of kallsyms support. This fix
include support for EXTRA_KALLSYM_PASS=1.
The ugly part is that it is hardcoded in the arch/sparc/boot
Makefile.
