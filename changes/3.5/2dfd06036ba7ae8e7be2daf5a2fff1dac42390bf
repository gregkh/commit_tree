aio: make kiocb->private NUll in init_sync_kiocb()

Ocfs2 uses kiocb.*private as a flag of unsigned long size. In
commit a11f7e6 ocfs2: serialize unaligned aio, the unaligned
io flag is involved in it to serialize the unaligned aio. As
*private is not initialized in init_sync_kiocb() of do_sync_write(),
this unaligned io flag may be unexpectly set in an aligned dio.
And this will cause OCFS2_I(inode)->ip_unaligned_aio decreased
to -1 in ocfs2_dio_end_io(), thus the following unaligned dio
will hang forever at ocfs2_aiodio_wait() in ocfs2_file_aio_write().
