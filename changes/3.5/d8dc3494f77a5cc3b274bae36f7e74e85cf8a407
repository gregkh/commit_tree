HID: logitech: don't use stack based dj_report structures

On a system with a logitech wireless keyboard/mouse and DMA-API debugging
enabled, this warning appears at boot:

kernel: WARNING: at lib/dma-debug.c:929 check_for_stack.part.12+0x70/0xa7()
kernel: Hardware name: MS-7593
kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: DMA-API: device driver maps memory fromstack [addr=ffff8801b0079c29]

Make logi_dj_recv_query_paired_devices and logi_dj_recv_switch_to_dj_mode
use a structure allocated with kzalloc rather than a stack based one.
