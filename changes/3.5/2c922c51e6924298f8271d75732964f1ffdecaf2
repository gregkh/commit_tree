um: properly check all process' threads for a live mm

kill_off_processes() might miss a valid process, this is because checking
for process->mm is not enough.  Process' main thread may exit or detach
its mm via use_mm(), but other threads may still have a valid mm.

To catch this we use find_lock_task_mm(), which walks up all threads and
returns an appropriate task (with task lock held).
