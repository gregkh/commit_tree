target: Return error to initiator if SET TARGET PORT GROUPS emulation fails

The error paths in target_emulate_set_target_port_groups() are all
essentially "rc = -EINVAL; goto out;" but the code at "out:" ignores
rc and always returns success.  This means that even if eg explicit
ALUA is turned off, the initiator will always see a good SCSI status
for SET TARGET PORT GROUPS.

Fix this by returning rc as is intended.  It appears this bug was
added by the following patch:
