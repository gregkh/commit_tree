Btrfs: fix runtime warning in check-integrity check data mode

If a file_extent_item was located at the very end of a leaf and there was
not enough space to hold a full item, but there was enough space to hold
one of type BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_INLINE or PREALLOC, and it was only such a
short item, a warning was printed anyway. This check is now fixed.
