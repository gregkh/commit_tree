x86/mm: Only add extra pages count for the first memory range during pre-allocation early page table space

Robin found this regression:

| I just tried to boot an 8TB system.  It fails very early in boot with:
| Kernel panic - not syncing: Cannot find space for the kernel page tables

git bisect commit 722bc6b16771ed80871e1fd81c86d3627dda2ac8.

A git revert of that commit does boot past that point on the 8TB
configuration.

That commit will add up extra pages for all memory range even
above 4g.

Try to limit that extra page count adding to first entry only.
