stmmac: MDC clock dynamically based on the csr clock input

If a specific clk_csr value is passed from the platform
this means that the CSR Clock Range selection cannot be
changed at run-time and it is fixed (as reported in the driver
documentation). Viceversa the driver will try to set the MDC
clock dynamically according to the actual clock input.
