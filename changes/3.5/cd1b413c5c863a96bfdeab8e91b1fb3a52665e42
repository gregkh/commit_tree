Btrfs: ulist realloc bugfix

ulist_next gets the pointer to the previously returned element to find the
next element from there. However, when we call ulist_add while iteration
with ulist_next is in progress (ulist explicitly supports this), we can
realloc the ulist internal memory, which makes the pointer to the previous
element useless.

Instead, we now use an iterator parameter that's independent from the
internal pointers.
