drm/i915: add HAS_ALIASING_PPGTT parameter for userspace

On Sanybridge a few MI read/write commands only work when ppgtt is
enabled.  Userspace therefore needs to be able to check whether ppgtt
is enabled. For added hilarity, you need to reset the "use global GTT"
bit on snb when ppgtt is enabled, otherwise it won't work.  Despite
what bspec says about automatically using ppgtt ...

Luckily PIPE_CONTROL (the only write cmd current userspace uses) is
not affected by all this, as tested by tests/gem_pipe_control_store_loop.
