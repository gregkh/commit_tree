[media] gspca: Call sd_stop0 on disconnect

This is necessary to ensure that worker-threads accessing the device
are stopped before our disconnect handler returns.

This causes a problem with stream_off calling sd_stop0 a second time
when the device handle is closed. This is fixed by setting
gscpa_dev->streaming to 0 on disconnect.

Note that now stream_off will never be called on a disconnected device,
and the present check can thus be removed from stream_off.
