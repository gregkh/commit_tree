arch/tile: support <asm/cachectl.h> header for cacheflush() syscall

We already had a syscall that did some dcache flushing, but it was
not used in practice.  Make it MIPS compatible instead so it can
do both the DCACHE and ICACHE actions.  We have code that wants to
be able to use the ICACHE flush mode from userspace so this change
enables that.
