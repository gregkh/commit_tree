ipv6: Move ipv6 proc file registration to end of init order

/proc/net/ipv6_route reflects the contents of fib_table_hash. The proc
handler is installed in ip6_route_net_init() whereas fib_table_hash is
allocated in fib6_net_init() _after_ the proc handler has been installed.

This opens up a short time frame to access fib_table_hash with its pants
down.

Move the registration of the proc files to a later point in the init
order to avoid the race.

Tested :-)
