checkpatch: check for whitespace before semicolon at EOL

Requires --strict option during invocation:
	~/linux$ scripts/checkpatch --strict foo.patch

This tests for a bad habits of mine like this:

	return 0 ;

Note that it does allow a special case of a bare semicolon
for empty loops:

	while (foo())
		;
