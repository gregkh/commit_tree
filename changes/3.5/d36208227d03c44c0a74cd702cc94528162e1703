printk: Optimize if statement logic where newline exists

In reviewing Kay's fix up patch: "printk: Have printk() never buffer its
data", I found two if statements that could be combined and optimized.

Put together the two 'cont.len && cont.owner == current' if statements
into a single one, and check if we need to call cont_add(). This also
removes the unneeded double cont_flush() calls.
