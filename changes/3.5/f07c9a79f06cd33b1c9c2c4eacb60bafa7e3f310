Btrfs: avoid buffer overrun in btrfs_printk

The buffer read-overrun would be triggered by a printk format
starting with <N>, where N is a single digit.  NUL-terminate
after strncpy.  Use memcpy, not strncpy, since we know the
string we're copying fits in the destination buffer and
contains no NUL byte.
