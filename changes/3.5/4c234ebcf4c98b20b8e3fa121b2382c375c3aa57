staging: "rtl8192e/r8192u" typo change ContiuneDiffCount.

As mentioned by jesper juhl, we should probably change ContiuneDiffCount
to ContinueDiffCount. Below you will find the changes to do so.  I have
compile tested this and everything builds with the changes, as for
testing on the hardware I am unable to do.
