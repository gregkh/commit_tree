Bluetooth: Update tx_send_head when sending ERTM data

Commit 94122bbe9c8c4ad7ba9f02f9a30bfc95672c404e introduced a problem
where tx_send_head was not set to point to the first skb in the ERTM
transmit queue, which stalled data transmission.  This change sets
that pointer when transmission is not already in progress.
