drm/i915: Avoid using mappable space for relocation processing through the CPU

We try to avoid writing the relocations through the uncached GTT, if the
buffer is currently in the CPU write domain and so will be flushed out to
main memory afterwards anyway. Also on SandyBridge we can safely write
to the pages in cacheable memory, so long as the buffer is LLC mapped.
In either of these cases, we therefore do not need to force the
reallocation of the buffer into the mappable region of the GTT, reducing
the aperture pressure.
