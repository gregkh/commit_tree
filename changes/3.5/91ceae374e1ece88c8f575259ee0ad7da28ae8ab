NET: pc300, move to staging as it is broken

It was marked as BROKEN back in 2008. It is because the tty handling
in the driver is really broken.

There was some activity in January 2012 to fix the driver, but the
patch was commented to be bogus:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/29/160
and we have not heard back from the author since then:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/28/412

So since nobody stepped in and rewrote the driver, it is time to move
it out of line now. And drop it some time later if nobody comes up
with patches to fix the driver in staging.
