btrfs: allow changing 'thread_pool' size at remount time

Changing 'mount -oremount,thread_pool=2 /' didn't make any effect:

maximum amount of worker threads is specified in 2 places:
- in 'strict btrfs_fs_info::thread_pool_size'
- in each worker struct: 'struct btrfs_workers::max_workers'

'mount -oremount' updated only 'btrfs_fs_info::thread_pool_size'.

Fix it by pushing new maximum value to all created worker structures
as well.
