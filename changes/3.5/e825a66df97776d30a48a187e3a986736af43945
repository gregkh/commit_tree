ceph: drop msgr argument from prepare_write_connect()

In all cases, the value passed as the msgr argument to
prepare_write_connect() is just con->msgr.  Just get the msgr
value from the ceph connection and drop the unneeded argument.

The only msgr passed to prepare_write_banner() is also therefore
just the one from con->msgr, so change that function to drop the
msgr argument as well.
