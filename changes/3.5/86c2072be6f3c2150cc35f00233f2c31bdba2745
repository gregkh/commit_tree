mtd: ecc_strength is at ecc step granularity

ecc_strength element of mtd_info will be the strength of one ecc step, not of
the entire writesize, as was previously planned.  This is the appropriate way
because, as was pointed out¹, bit errors in excess of the strength of one
step can cause a hard error if they all occur within the same ecc region.
