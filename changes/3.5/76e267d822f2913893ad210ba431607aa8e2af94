PM / Runtime: Remove device fields related to suspend time, v2

After the previous changes in default_stop_ok() and
default_power_down_ok() for PM domains, there are two fields in
struct dev_pm_info that aren't necessary any more,  suspend_time
and max_time_suspended_ns.

Remove those fields along with all of the code that accesses them,
which simplifies the runtime PM framework quite a bit.
