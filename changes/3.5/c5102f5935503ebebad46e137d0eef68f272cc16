ARM: 7408/1: cacheflush: return error to userspace when flushing syscall fails

The cacheflush syscall can fail for two reasons:

(1) The arguments are invalid (nonsensical address range or no VMA)

(2) The region generates a translation fault on a VIPT or PIPT cache

This patch allows do_cache_op to return an error code to userspace in
the case of the above. The various coherent_user_range implementations
are modified to return 0 in the case of VIVT caches or -EFAULT in the
case of an abort on v6/v7 cores.
