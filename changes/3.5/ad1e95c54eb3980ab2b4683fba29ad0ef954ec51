xfs: clean up xfs_bit.h includes

With the removal of xfs_rw.h and other changes over time, xfs_bit.h
is being included in many files that don't actually need it. Clean
up the includes as necessary.

Also move the only-used-once xfs_ialloc_find_free() static inline
function out of a header file that is widely included to reduce
the number of needless dependencies on xfs_bit.h.
