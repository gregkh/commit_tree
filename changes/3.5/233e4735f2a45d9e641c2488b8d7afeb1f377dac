KEYS: Permit in-place link replacement in keyring list

Make use of the previous patch that makes the garbage collector perform RCU
synchronisation before destroying defunct keys.  Key pointers can now be
replaced in-place without creating a new keyring payload and replacing the
whole thing as the discarded keys will not be destroyed until all currently
held RCU read locks are released.

If the keyring payload space needs to be expanded or contracted, then a
replacement will still need allocating, and the original will still have to be
freed by RCU.
