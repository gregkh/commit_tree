netfilter: bridge: optionally set indev to vlan

if net.bridge.bridge-nf-filter-vlan-tagged sysctl is enabled, bridge
netfilter removes the vlan header temporarily and then feeds the packet
to ip(6)tables.

When the new "bridge-nf-pass-vlan-input-device" sysctl is on
(default off), then bridge netfilter will also set the
in-interface to the vlan interface; if such an interface exists.

This is needed to make iptables REDIRECT target work with
"vlan-on-top-of-bridge" setups and to allow use of "iptables -i" to
match the vlan device name.

Also update Documentation with current brnf default settings.
