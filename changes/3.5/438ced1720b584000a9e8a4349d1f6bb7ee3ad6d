ring-buffer: Add per_cpu ring buffer control files

Add a debugfs entry under per_cpu/ folder for each cpu called
buffer_size_kb to control the ring buffer size for each CPU
independently.

If the global file buffer_size_kb is used to set size, the individual
ring buffers will be adjusted to the given size. The buffer_size_kb will
report the common size to maintain backward compatibility.

If the buffer_size_kb file under the per_cpu/ directory is used to
change buffer size for a specific CPU, only the size of the respective
ring buffer is updated. When tracing/buffer_size_kb is read, it reports
'X' to indicate that sizes of per_cpu ring buffers are not equivalent.
