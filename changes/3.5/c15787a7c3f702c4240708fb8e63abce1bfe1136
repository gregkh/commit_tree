s390: remove dead code from signal handler

The code in entry[64].S calls do_signal only on return to user space.
user_mode(regs) is true for every calls to do_signal, it is unnecessary
to recheck user_mode at the start of do_signal and the legacy signal
stack switching path in get_sigframe is never reached.
