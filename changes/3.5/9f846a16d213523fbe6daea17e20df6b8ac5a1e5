drm/i915: kick any firmware framebuffers before claiming the gtt

Especially vesafb likes to map everything as uc- (yikes), and if that
mapping hangs around still while we try to map the gtt as wc the
kernel will downgrade our request to uc-, resulting in abyssal
performance.

Unfortunately we can't do this as early as readon does (i.e. as the
first thing we do when initializing the hw) because our fb/mmio space
region moves around on a per-gen basis. So I've had to move it below
the gtt initialization, but that seems to work, too. The important
thing is that we do this before we set up the gtt wc mapping.

Now an altogether different question is why people compile their
kernels with vesafb enabled, but I guess making things just work isn't
bad per se ...

v2:
- s/radeondrmfb/inteldrmfb/
- fix up error handling

v3: Kill #ifdef X86, this is Intel after all. Noticed by Ben Widawsky.

v4: Jani Nikula complained about the pointless bool primary
initialization.

v5: Don't oops if we can't allocate, noticed by Chris Wilson.

v6: Resolve conflicts with agp rework and fixup whitespace.

This is commit e188719a2891f01b3100d in drm-next.

Backport to 3.5 -fixes queue requested by Dave Airlie - due to grub
using vesa on fedora their initrd seems to load vesafb before loading
the real kms driver. So tons more people actually experience a
dead-slow gpu. Hence also the Cc: stable.
