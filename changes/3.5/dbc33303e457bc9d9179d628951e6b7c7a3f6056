xhci: Reserve one command for USB3 LPM disable.

We want to do everything we can to ensure that USB 3.0 Link Power
Management (LPM) can be disabled when it is enabled.  If LPM can't be
disabled, we can't suspend USB 3.0 devices, or reset them.  To make sure
we can submit the command to disable LPM, allocate a command in the
xhci_hcd structure, and reserve one TRB on the command ring.

We only need one command per xHCI driver instance, because LPM is only
disabled or enabled while the USB core is holding the bandwidth_mutex
that is shared between the xHCI USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 roothubs.  The
bandwidth_mutex will be held until the command completes, or times out.
