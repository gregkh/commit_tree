[SCSI] be2iscsi: fix dma free size mismatch regression

This patch should go into 3.5 fixes. The bug was added in the
patches for the 3.5 feature window.

As you can see from the patch I made a mistake. During
development I switched from passing a struct to the size of
the struct, but left the sizeof. This results in us allocating
4 bytes (sizeof(int)) but then calling pci_free_consistent
with the size of the struct.
