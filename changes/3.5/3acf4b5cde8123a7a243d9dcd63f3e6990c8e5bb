uli526x: stop using net_device.{base_addr, irq} and convert to __iomem.

The bulk of the patch comes from the __iomem changes.

- the phy read and write operations were carrying the chip id deep
  down the call chain. Let's waste a pointer and contain the flying
  spaghetti monster.
- phy_{read, write}_1bit only need to access the DCR9 register. The loss
  of generality here should not hurt.
- removed a leftover printk of the EISA era. This is a pure PCI device.
