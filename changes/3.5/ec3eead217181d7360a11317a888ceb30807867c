RDMA/cxgb4: Remove kfifo usage

Using kfifos for ID management was limiting the number of QPs and
preventing NP384 MPI jobs.  So replace it with a simple bitmap
allocator.

Remove IDs from the IDR tables before deallocating them.  This bug was
causing the BUG_ON() in insert_handle() to fire because the ID was
getting reused before being removed from the IDR table.
