kmsg: export printk records to the /dev/kmsg interface

Support for multiple concurrent readers of /dev/kmsg, with read(),
seek(), poll() support. Output of message sequence numbers, to allow
userspace log consumers to reliably reconnect and reconstruct their
state at any given time. After open("/dev/kmsg"), read() always
returns *all* buffered records. If only future messages should be
read, SEEK_END can be used. In case records get overwritten while
/dev/kmsg is held open, or records get faster overwritten than they
are read, the next read() will return -EPIPE and the current reading
position gets updated to the next available record. The passed
sequence numbers allow the log consumer to calculate the amount of
lost messages.
