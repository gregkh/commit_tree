ore: Unlock r4w pages in exact reverse order of locking

The read-4-write pages are locked in address ascending order.
But where unlocked in a way easiest for coding. Fix that,
locks should be released in opposite order of locking, .i.e
descending address order.

I have not hit this dead-lock. It was found by inspecting the
dbug print-outs. I suspect there is an higher lock at caller that
protects us, but fix it regardless.
