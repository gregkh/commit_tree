ramoops: Move to fs/pstore/ram.c

Since ramoops was converted to pstore, it has nothing to do with character
devices nowadays. Instead, today it is just a RAM backend for pstore.

The patch just moves things around. There are a few changes were needed
because of the move:

1. Kconfig and Makefiles fixups, of course.

2. In pstore/ram.c we have to play a bit with MODULE_PARAM_PREFIX, this
   is needed to keep user experience the same as with ramoops driver
   (i.e. so that ramoops.foo kernel command line arguments would still
   work).
