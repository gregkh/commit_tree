cgroup: implement cgroup_rm_cftypes()

Implement cgroup_rm_cftypes() which removes an array of cftypes from a
subsystem.  It can be called whether the target subsys is attached or
not.  cgroup core will remove the specified file from all existing
cgroups.

This will be used to improve sub-subsys modularity and will be helpful
for unified hierarchy.
