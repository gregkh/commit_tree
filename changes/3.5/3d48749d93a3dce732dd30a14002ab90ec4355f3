block: ioc_task_link() can't fail

ioc_task_link() is used to share %current's ioc on clone.  If
%current->io_context is set, %current is guaranteed to have refcount
on the ioc and, thus, ioc_task_link() can't fail.

Replace error checking in ioc_task_link() with WARN_ON_ONCE() and make
it just increment refcount and nr_tasks.

-v2: Description typo fix (Vivek).
