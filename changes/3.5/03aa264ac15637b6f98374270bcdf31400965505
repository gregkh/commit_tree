blkcg: let blkcg core manage per-queue blkg list and counter

With the previous patch to move blkg list heads and counters to
request_queue and blkg, logic to manage them in both policies are
almost identical and can be moved to blkcg core.

This patch moves blkg link logic into blkg_lookup_create(), implements
common blkg unlink code in blkg_destroy(), and updates
blkg_destory_all() so that it's policy specific and can skip root
group.  The updated blkg_destroy_all() is now used to both clear queue
for bypassing and elv switching, and release all blkgs on q exit.

This patch introduces a race window where policy [de]registration may
race against queue blkg clearing.  This can only be a problem on cfq
unload and shouldn't be a real problem in practice (and we have many
other places where this race already exists).  Future patches will
remove these unlikely races.
