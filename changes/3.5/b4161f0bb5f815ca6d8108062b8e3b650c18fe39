Support M95040 SPI EEPROM

Updated the generic SPI EEPROM driver AT25 for support of an additional address
bit in the instruction byte. Certain EEPROMS have a size that is larger than the
number of address bytes would allow (e.g. like M95040 from ST that has 512 Byte
size but uses only one address byte (A0 to A7) for addressing.) For the extra
address bit (A8, A16 or A24) bit 3 of the instruction byte is used. This
instruction bit is normally defined as don't care for other AT25 like chips.
