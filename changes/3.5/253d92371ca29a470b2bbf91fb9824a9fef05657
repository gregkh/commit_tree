firewire: Add function to get speed from opaque struct fw_request

Sometimes it's useful to know the FireWire speed of the request that has
just come in to a fw_address_handler callback. As struct fw_request is
opaque we can't peek inside to get the speed out of the struct fw_packet
that's just inside. For example, the SBP-2 spec says:

"The speed at which the block write request to the MANAGEMENT_AGENT
register is received shall determine the speed used by the target for
all subsequent requests to read the initiator’s configuration ROM, fetch
ORB’s from initiator memory or store status at the initiator’s
status_FIFO. Command block ORB’s separately specify the speed for
requests addressed to the data buffer or page table."
