xen: Add selfballoning memory reservation tunable.

Currently, the memory target in the Xen selfballooning driver is mainly
driven by the value of "Committed_AS".  However, there are cases in
which it is desirable to assign additional memory to be available for
the kernel, e.g. for local caches (which are not covered by cleancache),
e.g. dcache and inode caches.

This adds an additional tunable in the selfballooning driver (accessible
via sysfs) which allows the user to specify an additional constant
amount of memory to be reserved by the selfballoning driver for the
local domain.
