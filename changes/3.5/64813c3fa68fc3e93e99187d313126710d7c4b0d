ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: reorganize and document the reset and configuration process

Reorganize the code involved in resetting and configuring an IP block
to make it easier to read and maintain.  This involves improving
documentation, splitting some large functions up into smaller ones to
better conform with Documentation/CodingStyle, and removing some
unnecessary code.
