x86/mm: Fix the size calculation of mapping tables

For machines that enable PSE, the first 2/4M memory region still uses
4K pages, so needs more PTEs in this case, but
find_early_table_space() doesn't count this.

This patch fixes it.

The bug was found via code review, no misbehavior of the kernel
was observed.
