mwifiex: fix 11n rx packet drop issue

Currently we check the sequence number of last packet received
against start_win. If a sequence hole is detected, start_win is
updated to next sequence number.

Since the rx sequence number is initialized to 0, a corner case
exists when BA setup happens immediately after association. As
0 is a valid sequence number, start_win gets increased to 1
incorrectly. This causes the first packet with sequence number 0
being dropped.

Initialize rx sequence number as 0xffff and skip adjusting
start_win if the sequence number remains 0xffff. The sequence
number will be updated once the first packet is received.
