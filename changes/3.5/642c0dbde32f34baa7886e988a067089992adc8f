libceph: flush msgr queue during mon_client shutdown

We need to flush the msgr workqueue during mon_client shutdown to
ensure that any work affecting our embedded ceph_connection is
finished so that we can be safely destroyed.

Previously, we were flushing the work queue after osd_client
shutdown and before mon_client shutdown to ensure that any osd
connection refs to authorizers are flushed.  Remove the redundant
flush, and document in the comment that the mon_client flush is
needed to cover that case as well.
