ASoC: tegra+wm8903: turn of mic detect when card is removed

If mic detect is left enabled and the WM8903 detects a status change,
the WM8903 driver will make a callback against the free()d jack, which
will cause a crash.

This problem can be triggered by fully initializing an audio card, then
removing and re-inserting the machine driver module.
