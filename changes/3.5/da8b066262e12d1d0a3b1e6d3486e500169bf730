blkcg: make blkg_conf_prep() take @pol and return with queue lock held

Add @pol to blkg_conf_prep() and let it return with queue lock held
(to be released by blkg_conf_finish()).  Note that @pol isn't used
yet.

This is to prepare for per-queue policy activation and doesn't cause
any visible difference.
