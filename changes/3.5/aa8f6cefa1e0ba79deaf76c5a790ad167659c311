ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: I2C: add flag for context restore

Restore of context is not done for OMAP4. This patch
adds the OMAP_I2C_FLAG_RESET_REGS_POSTIDLE in the OMAP4
hwmod data which activates the restore for OMAP4.
Currently the OMAP4 does not hit device off still the
driver may have support for it.
