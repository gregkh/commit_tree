ARM: 7404/1: cmpxchg64: use atomic64 and local64 routines for cmpxchg64

The cmpxchg64 routines for ARMv6+ CPUs replicate inline assembly that
already exists for atomic64 operations. Furthermore, the cmpxchg64 code
uses the "memory" constraint in the clobber list rather than identifying
the region of memory that is actually modified.

This patch replaces the ARMv6+ cmpxchg64 code with macros that expand to
the atomic64_ and local64_ variants, casting the pointer parameter to
the appropriate container type.
