ARM: OMAP3: clock data: treat all AM35x devices the same

The init for 3505/3517 specific clocks depends on the ordering of
cpu_is checks, is error prone and confusing (there are 2 separate
checks for cpu_is_omap3505()).

Remove the 3505-specific checking since CK_3505 flag is not used, and
treat all AM35x clocks the same.

This means that the SGX clock (the only AM35x clkdev not currently
flagged for 3505) will now be registered on 3505, but that is
harmless.  That can be cleaned up when the clkdev nodes are removed in
favor of them being registered by hwmod.
