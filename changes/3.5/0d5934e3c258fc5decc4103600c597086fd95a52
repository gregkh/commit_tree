drbd: fix null pointer dereference with on-congestion policy when diskless

We must not look at mdev->actlog, unless we have a get_ldev() reference.
It also does not make much sense to try to disconnect or pull-ahead of
the peer, if we don't have good local data.

Only even consider congestion policies, if our local disk is D_UP_TO_DATE.
