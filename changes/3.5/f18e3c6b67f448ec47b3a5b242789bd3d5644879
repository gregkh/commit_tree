ath9k_hw: avoid possible infinite loop in ar9003_get_pll_sqsum_dvc

"ath9k: Fix softlockup in AR9485" with commit id
64bc1239c790e051ff677e023435d770d2ffa174 fixed the reported
issue, yet its better to avoid the possible infinite loop
in ar9003_get_pll_sqsum_dvc by having a timeout as suggested
by ath9k maintainers.

Based on my testing PLL's locking measurement is done in
~200us (2 iterations).
