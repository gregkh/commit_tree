staging: android: persistent_ram: Introduce persistent_ram_new()

The routine just creates a persistent ram zone at a specified address.

For persistent_ram_init_ringbuffer() we'd need to add a
'struct persistent_ram' to the global list, and associate it with a
device. We don't need all this complexity in pstore_ram, so we introduce
the simple function.
