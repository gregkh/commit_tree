ALSA: Add definitions for CEA-861 Audio InfoFrames

Along with the IEC-60958 channel status word, CEA-861 Audio InfoFrames
are used in HDMI and DisplayPort to describe the parameters of the audio
stream. Hence, drivers for such devices may use these definitions to, for
instance, fill a CEA-861 data structure and pass it to a display driver
to configure an IP.
