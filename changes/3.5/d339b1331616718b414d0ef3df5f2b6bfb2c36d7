igb: add PTP Hardware Clock code

This patch adds a source file implementing a PHC. Only the basic
clock operations have been implemented, although the hardware
would offer some ancillary functions. The code is fairly self
contained and is not yet used in the main igb driver.

Every timestamp and clock read operation must consult the overflow
counter to form a correct time value. Access to the counter is
protected by a spin lock, and the counter is implemented using the
standard cyclecounter/timecounter code.
