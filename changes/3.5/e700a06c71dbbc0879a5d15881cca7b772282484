xfs: make xfs_extent_busy_trim not static

Commit e459df5, 'xfs: move busy extent handling to it's own file'
moved some code from xfs_alloc.c into xfs_extent_busy.c for
convenience in userspace code merges.  One of the functions moved is
xfs_extent_busy_trim (formerly xfs_alloc_busy_trim) which is defined
STATIC.  Unfortunately this function is still used in xfs_alloc.c, and
this results in an undefined symbol in xfs.ko.

Make xfs_extent_busy_trim not static and add its prototype to
xfs_extent_busy.h.
