s390/cmpxchg: fix compile warnings specific to s390

The cmpxchg macros and functions are a bit different than on other
architectures. In particular the macros do not store the return
value of a __cmpxchg function call in a variable before returning the
value.

This causes compile warnings that only occur on s390 like this one:

net/ipv4/af_inet.c: In function 'build_ehash_secret':
net/ipv4/af_inet.c:241:2: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value]

To get rid of these warnings use the same construct that we already use
for the xchg macro, which was introduced for the same reason.
