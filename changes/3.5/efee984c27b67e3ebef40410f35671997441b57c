new helper: signal_delivered()

Does block_sigmask() + tracehook_signal_handler();  called when
sigframe has been successfully built.  All architectures converted
to it; block_sigmask() itself is gone now (merged into this one).

I'm still not too happy with the signature, but that's a separate
story (IMO we need a structure that would contain signal number +
siginfo + k_sigaction, so that get_signal_to_deliver() would fill one,
signal_delivered(), handle_signal() and probably setup...frame() -
take one).
