x86: get rid of calling do_notify_resume() when returning to kernel mode

If we end up calling do_notify_resume() with !user_mode(refs), it
does nothing (do_signal() explicitly bails out and we can't get there
with TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME in such situations).  Then we jump to
resume_userspace_sig, which rechecks the same thing and bails out
to resume_kernel, thus breaking the loop.

It's easier and cheaper to check *before* calling do_notify_resume()
and bail out to resume_kernel immediately.  And kill the check in
do_signal()...

Note that on amd64 we can't get there with !user_mode() at all - asm
glue takes care of that.
