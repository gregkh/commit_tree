ixgbe: Do not pad FCoE frames as this can cause issues with FCoE DDP

FCoE target mode was experiencing issues due to the fact that we were
sending up data frames that were padded to 60 bytes after the DDP logic had
already stripped the frame down to 52 or 56 depending on the use of VLANs.
This was resulting in the FCoE DDP logic having issues since it thought the
frame still had data in it due to the padding.

To resolve this, adding code so that we do not pad FCoE frames prior to
handling them to the stack.
