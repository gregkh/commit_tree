cfq: pass around cfq_io_cq instead of io_context

Now that io_cq is managed by block core and guaranteed to exist for
any in-flight request, it is easier and carries more information to
pass around cfq_io_cq than io_context.

This patch updates cfq_init_prio_data(), cfq_find_alloc_queue() and
cfq_get_queue() to take @cic instead of @ioc.  This change removes a
duplicate cfq_cic_lookup() from cfq_find_alloc_queue().

This change enables the use of cic-cached ioprio in the next patch.
