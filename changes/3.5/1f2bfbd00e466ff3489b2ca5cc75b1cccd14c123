kbuild: link of vmlinux moved to a script

Move the final link of vmlinux to a script to improve
readability and maintainability of the code.

The Makefile fragments used to link vmlinux has over the
years seen far too many changes and the logic had become
hard to follow.

As the process by nature is serialized there was
nothing gained including this in the Makefile.

"um" has special link requirments - and the
only way to handle this was to hard-code the linking
of "um" in the script.
This was better than trying to modularize it only for the
benefit of "um" anyway.

The shell script has been improved after input from:
