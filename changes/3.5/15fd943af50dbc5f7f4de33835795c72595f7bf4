rpmsg: make sure inflight messages don't invoke just-removed callbacks

When inbound messages arrive, rpmsg core looks up their associated
endpoint (by destination address) and then invokes their callback.

We've made sure that endpoints will never be de-allocated after they
were found by rpmsg core, but we also need to protect against the
(rare) scenario where the rpmsg driver was just removed, and its
callback function isn't available anymore.

This is achieved by introducing a callback mutex, which must be taken
before the callback is invoked, and, obviously, before it is removed.
