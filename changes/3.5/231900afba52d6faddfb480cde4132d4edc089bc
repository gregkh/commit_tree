ARM: OMAP3: cpuidle - remove rx51 cpuidle parameters table

As suggested, this table is an optimized version for rx51 and we
remove it in order to consolidate the cpuidle code between omap3
and omap4, we remove this specific data definition which is used
to override the default omap3 latencies but at the cost of extra
code and complexity.

In order to not lose the values which probably took time to be
measured, the table is converted into a comment with an array
description.
