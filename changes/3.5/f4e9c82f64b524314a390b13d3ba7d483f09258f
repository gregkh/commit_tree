watchdog: Add Locking support

This patch fixes some potential multithreading issues, despite only
allowing one process to open the /dev/watchdog device, we can still get
called multiple times at the same time, since a program could be using thread,
or could share the fd after a fork.

This causes 2 potential problems:
1) watchdog_start / open do an unlocked test_n_set / test_n_clear,
   if these 2 race, the watchdog could be stopped while the active
   bit indicates it is running or visa versa.

2) Most watchdog_dev drivers probably assume that only one
   watchdog-op will get called at a time, this is not necessary
   true atm.
