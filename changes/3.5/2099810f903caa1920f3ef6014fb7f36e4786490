drm/radeon: enable pci bus mastering after card is initialised (v2)

This closes a race seen with kexec where we enable PCI bus mastering
but the card has been reinitialised fully yet.

This was previously fixed by a patch from Jerome, but this should
close the race completely.

v2: add SI support as suggested by Alex.
