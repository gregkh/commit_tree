exofs: Fix CRASH on very early IO errors.

If at exofs_fill_super() we had an early termination
do to any error, like an IO error while reading the
super-block. We would crash inside exofs_free_sbi().

This is because sbi->oc.numdevs was set to 1, before
we actually have a device table at all.

Fix it by moving the sbi->oc.numdevs = 1 to after the
allocation of the device table.
