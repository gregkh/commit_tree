drm/i915: move clflushing into shmem_pread

This is obviously gonna slow down pread. But for a half-way realistic
micro-benchmark, it doesn't matter: Non-broken userspace reads back
data from the gpu once before the gpu again dirties it.

So all this ranged clflush tracking is just a waste of time.

No pread performance change (neglecting the dumb benchmark of
constantly reading the same data) measured.

As an added bonus, this avoids clflush on read on coherent objects.
Which means that partial preads on snb are now roughly 4x as fast.
This will be usefull for e.g. the libva encoder - when I finally get
around to fix that up.

v2: Properly sync with the gpu on LLC machines.
