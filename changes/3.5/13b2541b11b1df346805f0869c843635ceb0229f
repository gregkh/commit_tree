batman-adv: avoid temporary routing loops by being strict on forwarded OGMs

batman-adv would forward OGMs from non-besthops while replacing the the TQ
and TTL values with the values from the best hop. In certain corner cases
this leads to a temporary routing loop.
This patch changes this behavior: Only packets from best next hops are
forwarded - TQ and TTL values won't be replaced anymore. However, the protocol
needs to rebroadcast OGMs from single hop neighbors regardless of whether or
not they are the best hop. To handle this case a new flag is introduced to
alert neighboring nodes about the forwarded OGM that is not from my best
next hop. It is to be discarded by all nodes except for the one originating
the OGM.
