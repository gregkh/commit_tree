KVM: PPC: Pass EA to updating emulation ops

When emulating updating load/store instructions (lwzu, stwu, ...) we need to
write the effective address of the load/store into a register.

Currently, we write the physical address in there, which is very wrong. So
instead let's save off where the virtual fault was on MMIO and use that
information as value to put into the register.

While at it, also move the XOP variants of the above instructions to the new
scheme of using the already known vaddr instead of calculating it themselves.
