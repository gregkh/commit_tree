OMAPDSS: TPO-TD03MTEA1: Correct comment for power on delay

Since any power on stabilisation delay for the supply itself should be
taken care of transparently by the regulator API when the regulator is
enabled the additional delay that the TPO-TD03MTEA1 driver adds after
that returned should be due to the requirements of the device itself
rather than the supply (the delay is also suspicously long for one for
a regulator to ramp). Correct the comment to avoid misleading people
taking this code as a reference.
