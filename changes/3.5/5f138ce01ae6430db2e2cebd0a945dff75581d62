DRBD: Fix comparison always false warning due to long/long long compare

Fix warnings of the following nature in the drbd header:

In file included from drivers/block/drbd/drbd_bitmap.c:32:
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_int.h: In function 'drbd_get_syncer_progress':
drivers/block/drbd/drbd_int.h:2234: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data

where mdev->rs_total (an unsigned long) is being compared to 1ULL << 32, which
is always false on a 32-bit machine.
