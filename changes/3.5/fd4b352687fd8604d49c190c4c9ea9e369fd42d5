rcu: Update RCU_FAST_NO_HZ tracing for lazy callbacks

In the current code, a short dyntick-idle interval (where there is
at least one non-lazy callback on the CPU) and a long dyntick-idle
interval (where there are only lazy callbacks on the CPU) are traced
identically, which can be less than helpful.  This commit therefore
emits different event traces in these two cases.
