powerpc: Fix build of some debug irq code

There was a typo, checking for CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAG instead of
CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS causing some useful debug code to not be
built

This in turns causes a build error on BookE 64-bit due to incorrect
semicolons at the end of a couple of macros, so let's fix that too
