writeback: Remove wb->list_lock from writeback_single_inode()

writeback_single_inode() doesn't need wb->list_lock for anything on entry now.
So remove the requirement. This makes locking of writeback_single_inode()
temporarily awkward (entering with i_lock, returning with i_lock and
wb->list_lock) but it will be sanitized in the next patch.

Also inode_wait_for_writeback() doesn't need wb->list_lock for anything. It was
just taking it to make usage convenient for callers but with
writeback_single_inode() changing it's not very convenient anymore. So remove
the lock from that function.
