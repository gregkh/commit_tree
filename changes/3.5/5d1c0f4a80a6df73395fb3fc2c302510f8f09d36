watchdog: add check for suspended vm in softlockup detector

A suspended VM can cause spurious soft lockup warnings.  To avoid these, the
watchdog now checks if the kernel knows it was stopped by the host and skips
the warning if so.  When the watchdog is reset successfully, clear the guest
paused flag.
