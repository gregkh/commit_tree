Btrfs: fix defrag regression

If a file has 3 small extents:

| ext1 | ext2 | ext3 |

Running "btrfs fi defrag" will only defrag the last two extents, if those
extent mappings hasn't been read into memory from disk.

This bug was introduced by commit 17ce6ef8d731af5edac8c39e806db4c7e1f6956f
("Btrfs: add a check to decide if we should defrag the range")

The cause is, that commit looked into previous and next extents using
lookup_extent_mapping() only.

While at it, remove the code that checks the previous extent, since
it's sufficient to check the next extent.
