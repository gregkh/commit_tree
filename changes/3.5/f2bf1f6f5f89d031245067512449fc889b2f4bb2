tracing: Have tracing_off() actually turn tracing off

A recent update to have tracing_on/off() only affect the ftrace ring
buffers instead of all ring buffers had a cut and paste error.
The tracing_off() did the exact same thing as tracing_on() and
would not actually turn off tracing. Unfortunately, tracing_off()
is more important to be working than tracing_on() as this is a key
development tool, as it lets the developer turn off tracing as soon
as a problem is discovered. It is also used by panic and oops code.

This bug also breaks the 'echo func:traceoff > set_ftrace_filter'
