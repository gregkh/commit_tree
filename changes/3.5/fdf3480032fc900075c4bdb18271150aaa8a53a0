Staging: wlags49_h2: reading past the end of array

The original code had some confusion about the dimensions of the array.
It should have been an array of 2 element arrays but it was declared as
an array of 50 element arrays.

The limitter on the outside array should have been
ARRAY_SIZE(chan_freq_list) or 26 but instead 50 was used.  It meant that
we read past the end.  It's probably harmless but it's obviously worth
fixing.
