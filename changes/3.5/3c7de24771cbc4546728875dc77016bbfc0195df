OMAPDSS: HDMI: Fix ti_hdmi_4xxx_core_dump

The function ti_hdmi_4xxx_core_dump has some bugs, the following mention the
bugs and the solutions:

- The macros DUMPCORE and DUMPCOREAV in ti_hdmi_4xxx_core_dump() use
  hdmi_pll_base() for the offsets needed to calculate register addresses, use
  functions hdmi_core_sys_base() amd hdmi_av_base() to calculate the correct
  offsets for CORE_SYS and CORE_AV registers.

- Many of the CORE_AV registers use the DUMPCORE macro, and hence the register
  addresses are calculated incorrectly. Rename the current DUMPCOREAV macro as
  DUMPCOREAV2 as it takes 2 arguments to dump indexed CORE_AV registers, create
  a new macro called DUMPCOREAV which is now used for dumping non-indexed
  CORE_AV registers.

Thanks to Ancy Tom <ancytom@gmail.com> for pointing out the issues.
