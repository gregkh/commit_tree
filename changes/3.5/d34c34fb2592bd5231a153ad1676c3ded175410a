Bluetooth: Initialize the transmit queue for L2CAP streaming mode

Commit 105bdf9ec19e729bacdb33861c74fcf3eb39eb37 introduced a
regression in L2CAP streaming mode due to rearranged initialization
code that is shared between ERTM and streaming mode.  This change
makes sure the transmit queue is initialized in both modes.
