mfd: Enable Device Tree for ab8500-core driver

This patch will allow the ab8500-core driver to be probed and set up
when booting when Device Tree is enabled. This includes platform ID
look-up which identifies the machine it is currently running on. If
we are undergoing a DT enabled boot, we will refuse to setup each of
the other ab8500-* devices, as they will be probed individually by DT.
