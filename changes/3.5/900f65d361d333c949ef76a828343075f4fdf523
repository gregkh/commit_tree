tcp: move duplicate code from tcp_v4_init_sock()/tcp_v6_init_sock()

This commit moves the (substantial) common code shared between
tcp_v4_init_sock() and tcp_v6_init_sock() to a new address-family
independent function, tcp_init_sock().

Centralizing this functionality should help avoid drift issues,
e.g. where the IPv4 side is updated without a corresponding update to
IPv6. There was already some drift: IPv4 initialized snd_cwnd to
TCP_INIT_CWND, while the IPv6 side was still initializing snd_cwnd to
2 (in this case it should not matter, since snd_cwnd is also
initialized in tcp_init_metrics(), but the general risks and
maintenance overhead remain).

When diffing the old and new code, note that new tcp_init_sock()
function uses the order of steps from the tcp_v4_init_sock()
implementation (the order is slightly different in
tcp_v6_init_sock()).
