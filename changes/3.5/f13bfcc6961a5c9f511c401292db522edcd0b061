powerpc/44x: Fix/Initialize PID to kernel PID before the TLB search

Initialize the PID register with kernel pid (0) before we start
setting the TLB mapping for KEXEC. Also set the MMUCR[TID] to kernel
PID.

This was spotted while testing the kexec on ISS for 47x. ISS  doesn't
return a successful tlbsx for a kernel address with PID set to a user PID.
Though the hardware/qemu/simics work fine.

This patch is harmless and initializes the PID to 0 (kernel PID) which
is usually the case during a normal kernel boot. This would fix the kexec
on ISS for 440. I have tested this patch on sequoia board.
