hwspinlock/core: use global ID to register hwspinlocks on multiple devices

Commit 300bab9770 (hwspinlock/core: register a bank of hwspinlocks in a
single API call, 2011-09-06) introduced 'hwspin_lock_register_single()'
to register numerous (a bank of) hwspinlock instances in a single API,
'hwspin_lock_register()'.

At which time, 'hwspin_lock_register()' accidentally passes 'local IDs'
to 'hwspin_lock_register_single()', despite that ..._single() requires
'global IDs' to register hwspinlocks.

We have to convert into global IDs by supplying the missing 'base_id'.
