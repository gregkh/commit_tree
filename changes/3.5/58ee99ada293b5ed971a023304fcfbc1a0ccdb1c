irqdomain: Support removal of IRQ domains.

Now that IRQ domains are being used by modules it's necessary to support
removing them, too. This adds a new irq_domain_remove() routine for doing
the bulk of the heavy lifting. It's left as an exercise to the caller to
ensure all mappings have been appropriatey disposed of before attempting
to remove the domain.
