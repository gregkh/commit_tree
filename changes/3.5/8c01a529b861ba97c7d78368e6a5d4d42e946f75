vfs: remove unnecessary d_unhashed() check from __d_lookup_rcu

The check for d_unhashed() is not strictly incorrect, but at the same
time it is also not sensible.  The actual dentry removal from the dentry
hash chains is totally asynchronous to the __d_lookup_rcu() logic, and
we depend on __d_drop() updating the sequence number to invalidate any
lookup of an unhashed dentry.

So checking d_unhashed() is not incorrect, but it's not useful either:
the code has to work correctly even without it. So just remove it.
