Revert "drm/i915/crt: Do not rely upon the HPD presence pin"

This reverts commit 9e612a008fa7fe493a473454def56aa321479495.

It incorrectly finds VGA connectors where none are attached, apparently
not noticing that nothing replied to the EDID queries, and happily using
the default EDID modes that have nothing to do with actual hardware.

That in turn then causes X to fall down to the lowest common
denominator, which is usually the default 1024x768 mode that is in the
default EDID and pretty much anything supports).

I'd suggest that if not relying on the HDP pin, the code should at least
check whether it gets valid EDID data back, rather than just assume
there's something on the VGA connector.
