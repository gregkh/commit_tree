target: Remove max_sectors device attribute for modern se_task less code

This patch removes the original usage of dev_attr->max_sectors in favor of
dev_attr->hw_max_sectors that is now being enforced by target core from
within transport_generic_cmd_sequencer() for SCF_SCSI_DATA_SG_IO_CDB ops.

After the recent se_task removal patches from hch, this value for IBLOCK
backends being set via configfs by userspace from an saved max_sectors
value that is turning out to be problematic, so it makes sense to go ahead
and remove this now legacy attribute all-together.

This patch also continues to make se_dev_set_default_attribs() do
(sectors / block_size) alignment for what actually get used by
target_core_mod to be safe here, following the same alignment currently
used by fabric_max_sectors.
