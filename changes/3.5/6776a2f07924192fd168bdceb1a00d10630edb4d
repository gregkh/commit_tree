TTY: isdn, remove ISDN_ASYNC_* flags

They are the same as TTY ones. So there is no need to redefine them.
Remove ISDN_ASYNC_* and use only ASYNC_*. Except the MAGIC number, of
course.

While we are there, remove also the SERIAL_TYPE flags which are
unused.

Perhaps we should move the ASYNC flags from serial.h to tty.h given
they are used by the tty layer and tty drivers, not only serial?
