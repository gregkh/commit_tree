xtensa: use "test -e" instead of bashism "test -a"

On Ubuntu, /bin/sh is a symlink to dash, which does not support "test -a".
This causes messages like

    test: 1: -a: unexpected operator
    test: 1: -a: unexpected operator

and link failures like

    (.init.text+0x132): undefined reference to `platform_init'

due to the appropriate platform code not being compiled.
