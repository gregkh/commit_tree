ath6kl_sdio: Fix the EAPOL out of order issue

Send the EAPOL and management frames in the same AC_VO queue. The issue
happens when the AP supports QOS, the management frames are sent to AC_VO
queue and EAP frame goes to AC_BE queue. Even though the EAP frame is
queued before the DEAUTH management frame, as they are queued on different
h/w queues, order of delivery between these frames cannot be controlled.

This fixes the connection failure seen in P2P case.
