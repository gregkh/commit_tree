ath6kl: abort normal scan when scheduled scan is started

If the device disconnects from an AP when it is in suspending state. You will
get the following message from wpa_supplicant after waking the device up and
sending scan request:

"Scan trigger failed: ret=-16 (Device or resource busy)"

Fix the issue by sending a scan complete event before starting scheduled
scan.
