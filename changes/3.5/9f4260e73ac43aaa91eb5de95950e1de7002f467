KVM: x86 emulator: Avoid pushing back ModRM byte fetched for group decoding

Although ModRM byte is fetched for group decoding, it is soon pushed
back to make decode_modrm() fetch it later again.

Now that ModRM flag can be found in the top level opcode tables, fetch
ModRM byte before group decoding to make the code simpler.
