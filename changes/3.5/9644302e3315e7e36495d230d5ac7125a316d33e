ftrace: Speed up search by skipping pages by address

As all records in a page of the ftrace table are sorted, we can
speed up the search algorithm by checking if the address to look for
falls in between the first and last record ip on the page.

This speeds up both the ftrace_location() and ftrace_text_reserved()
algorithms, as it can skip full pages when the search address is
not in them.
