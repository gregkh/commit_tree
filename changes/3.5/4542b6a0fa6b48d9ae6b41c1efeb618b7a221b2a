ARM: 7365/1: drop unused parameter from flush_cache_user_range

vma isn't used and flush_cache_user_range isn't a standard macro that
is used on several archs with the same prototype. In fact only unicore32
has a macro with the same name (with an identical implementation and no
in-tree users).

This is a part of a patch proposed by Dima Zavin (with Message-id:
1272439931-12795-1-git-send-email-dima@android.com) that didn't get
accepted.
