xfs: check for buffer errors before waiting

If we call xfs_buf_iowait() on a buffer that failed dispatch due to
an IO error, it will wait forever for an Io that does not exist.
This is hndled in xfs_buf_read, but there is other code that calls
xfs_buf_iowait directly that doesn't.

Rather than make the call sites have to handle checking for dispatch
errors and then checking for completion errors, make
xfs_buf_iowait() check for dispatch errors on the buffer before
waiting. This means we handle both dispatch and completion errors
with one set of error handling at the caller sites.
