ixgbe: Clean up priority based flow control

This change cleans up the logic in the priority based flow control
configuration routines.  Both the 82599 and 82598 based routines perform
similar functions however they are both arranged completely differently.
This patch goes over both of them to clean up the code.

In addition I am dropping the ixgbe_fc_pfc flow control mode and instead
just replacing it with checks for if priority flow control is enabled.
This allows us to maintain some of the link flow control information which
allows for an easier transition between link and priority flow control.
