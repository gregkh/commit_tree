ath6kl: handle probe response from P2P device in P2P GO mode

When the device is in P2P GO mode and in listen state, the correct behavior is
to see two different probe response frames - one from P2P device and the other
from GO. wpa_supplicant uses the same mechanism to send the frame in both cases
(ath6kl_mgmt_tx). For GO probe response, ath6kl needs to call
ath6kl_send_go_probe_resp (this will add only WSC/P2P IEs and the rest of the
IEs are filled in by the firmware). That was done based on the nw_type ==
AP_NETWORK which would work if P2P Device role were in a separate netdev. When
P2P Device and GO use the same netdev, ath6kl needs to use the special GO probe
response case only if SSID is longer than P2P wildcard SSID.
