Revert "mmc: omap_hsmmc: Enable Auto CMD12"

This patch reverts the commit dba3c29ea4a1d5d544.

After bisecting, this commit dba3c29 is found to ruin micro-SD card data
(writing incorrect file, or fs is corrupt after several times mount)
on the beagle-xm revB, and reverting the commit will fix the problem.

Also from TRM of OMAP3/OMAP4/DM37x, the below is mentioned about
the Auto CMD12 Enable bit.
        - SDIO does not support this feature.
        - SD card only.
Looks it is not suitable to always enable Auto CMD12 in host controller
driver.

Considered that the commit is not mature enough, so ask to revert it
first.
