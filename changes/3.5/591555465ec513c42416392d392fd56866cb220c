NFS: Use proper naming conventions for nfs_client.impl_id field

Clean up:  When naming fields and data types, follow established
conventions to facilitate accurate grep/cscope searches.

Additionally, for consistency, move the impl_id field into the NFSv4-
specific part of the nfs_client, and free that memory in the logic
that shuts down NFSv4 nfs_clients.

Introduced by commit 7d2ed9ac "NFSv4: parse and display server
implementation ids," Fri Feb 17, 2012.
