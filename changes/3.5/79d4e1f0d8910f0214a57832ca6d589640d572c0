NFS: Use proper naming conventions for NFSv4.1 server scope fields

Clean up:  When naming fields and data types, follow established
conventions to facilitate accurate grep/cscope searches.

Additionally, for consistency, move the scope field into the NFSv4-
specific part of the nfs_client, and free that memory in the logic
that shuts down NFSv4 nfs_clients.

Introduced by commit 99fe60d0 "nfs41: exchange_id operation", April
1 2009.
