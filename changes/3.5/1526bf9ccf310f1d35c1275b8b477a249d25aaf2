KVM: s390: add capability indicating COW support

Currently qemu/kvm on s390 uses a guest mapping that does not
allow the guest backing page table to be write-protected to
support older systems. On those older systems a host write
protection fault will be delivered to the guest.

Newer systems allow to write-protect the guest backing memory
and let the fault be delivered to the host, thus allowing COW.

Use a capability bit to tell qemu if that is possible.
