drm/i915: Inline I915_INTERRUPT_ENABLE_FIX

Since there is only one remaining user of I915_INTERRUPT_ENABLE_FIX,
expand it at the callsite. Quoting Jesse Barnes:

"I'd really like to get rid of these defines at the top of i915_irq.c.
Some are unused and the others just make you check for the right bits
everytime your read the code."
