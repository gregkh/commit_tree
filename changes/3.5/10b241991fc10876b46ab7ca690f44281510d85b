staging: android: logger: Allocate logs dynamically at boot (v3)

This changes the log initialization to be dynamic, but still
at boot time.  These changes are a predecessor to implementing
runtime allocation and freeing of logs, to make the Android logger
less hard-coded.

Change from a fixed set of static log structures, to allocation
at init time into a list.  Return proper error numbers on log
allocation failure.
