Btrfs: don't assume to be on the correct extent in add_all_parents

add_all_parents did assume that path is already at a correct extent data
item, which may not be true in case of data extents that were partly
rewritten and splitted.

We need to check if we're on a matching extent for every item and only
for the ones after the first. The loop is changed to do this now.

This patch also fixes a bug introduced with commit 3b127fd8 "Btrfs:
remove obsolete btrfs_next_leaf call from __resolve_indirect_ref".
The removal of next_leaf did sometimes result in slot==nritems when
the above described case happens, and thus resulting in invalid values
(e.g. wanted_obejctid) in add_all_parents (leading to missed backrefs
or even crashes).
