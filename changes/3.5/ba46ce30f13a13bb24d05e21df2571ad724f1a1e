staging: usbip: fix the usage of kthread_stop()

stub_shutdown_connection() and vhci_shutdown_connection() use
task_is_dead() before kthread_stop(). This buys nothing and wrong.
kthread_stop() is fine even if this thread is dead. However, if it
is dead nothing protects this task_struct, we shouldn't touch this
memory.

Change the code to do the necessary get_task_struct/put_task_struct.

This patch assumes that

	- xxx_shutdown_connection() is always called, so we can't
	  leak the task_struct.

	- kthread_stop_put() can't be called twice on the same task.
