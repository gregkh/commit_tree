drm/i915: add new Haswell DIP controls registers

Haswell has different DIP control registers and offsets which we need to
use for infoframes, which this patch adds.

Note that this does not adds full DIP frames support, but only the basic
functionality necessary for HDMI to work in early enablement.

v2: replace infoframe handling with a debug message, proper support will
be added via a patch from Paulo Zanoni later.
