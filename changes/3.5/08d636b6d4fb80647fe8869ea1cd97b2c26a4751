ftrace/x86: Have arch x86_64 use breakpoints instead of stop machine

This method changes x86 to add a breakpoint to the mcount locations
instead of calling stop machine.

Now that iret can be handled by NMIs, we perform the following to
update code:

1) Add a breakpoint to all locations that will be modified

2) Sync all cores

3) Update all locations to be either a nop or call (except breakpoint
   op)

4) Sync all cores

5) Remove the breakpoint with the new code.

6) Sync all cores

[
  Added updates that Masami suggested:
   Use unlikely(modifying_ftrace_code) in int3 trap to keep kprobes efficient.
   Don't use NOTIFY_* in ftrace handler in int3 as it is not a notifier.
