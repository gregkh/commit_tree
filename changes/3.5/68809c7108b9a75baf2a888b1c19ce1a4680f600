writeback: initialize global_dirty_limit

This prevents global_dirty_limit from remaining 0 (the initial value)
for long time, since it's only updated in update_dirty_limit() when
above the dirty freerun area.

It will avoid unexpected consequences when some random code use it as a
convenient approximation of the global dirty threshold.
