drm/i915: bind objects to the global gtt only when needed

And track the existence of such a binding similar to the aliasing
ppgtt case. Speeds up binding/unbinding in the common case where we
only need a ppgtt binding (which is accessed in a cpu coherent fashion
by the gpu) and no gloabl gtt binding (which needs uc writes for the
ptes).

This patch just puts the required tracking in place.

v2: Check that global gtt mappings exist in the error_state capture
code (with Chris Wilson's llc reloc patches batchbuffers are no longer
relocated as mappable in all situations, so this matters). Suggested
by Chris Wilson.

v3: Adapted to Chris' latest llc-reloc patches.

v4: Fix a bug in the i915 error state capture code noticed by Chris
Wilson.
