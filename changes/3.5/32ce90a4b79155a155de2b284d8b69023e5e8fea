xfs: remove log item from AIL in xfs_iflush after a shutdown

If a filesystem has been forced shutdown we are never going to write inodes
to disk, which means the inode items will stay in the AIL until we free
the inode. Currently that is not a problem, but a pending change requires us
to empty the AIL before shutting down the filesystem. In that case leaving
the inode in the AIL is lethal. Make sure to remove the log item from the AIL
to allow emptying the AIL on shutdown filesystems.
