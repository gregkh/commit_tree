Staging: rtl8192u: fix some memory corruption

When we received a command we incremented a stat counter depending on
the type of message.  The problem is there were 8 types of commands but
there were only 4 counters allocated so it corrupted memory past the
end of the rxcmdpkt[] array.

The fix is just to remove the counters because they aren't used.
