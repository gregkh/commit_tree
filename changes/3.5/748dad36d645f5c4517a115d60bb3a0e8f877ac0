memcg: make threshold index in the right position

Index current_threshold may point to threshold that just equal to usage
after last call of __mem_cgroup_threshold.  But after registering a new
event, it will change (pointing to threshold just below usage).  So make
it consistent here.

For example:
now:
	threshold array:  3  [5]  7  9   (usage = 6, [index] = 5)

next turn (after calling __mem_cgroup_threshold):
	threshold array:  3   5  [7]  9   (usage = 7, [index] = 7)

after registering a new event (threshold = 10):
	threshold array:  3  [5]  7  9  10 (usage = 7, [index] = 5)
