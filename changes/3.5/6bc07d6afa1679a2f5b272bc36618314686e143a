ARM: OMAP: PM: Lock clocks list while generating summary

Commit a53025724052b2b1edbc982a4a248784638f563d (OMAP: Add debugfs
node to show the summary of all clocks) introduced clock summary,
however, we are interested in seeing snapshot of the clock state, not
in dynamically changing clock configurations as the data provided by
clock summary will then be useless for debugging configuration
issues. So, hold the common lock when dumping the clock summary.
