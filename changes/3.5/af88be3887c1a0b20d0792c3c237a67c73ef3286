[media] media: Add link_validate() op to check links to the sink pad

The purpose of the link_validate() op is to allow an entity driver to ensure
that the properties of the pads at the both ends of the link are suitable
for starting the pipeline. link_validate is called on sink pads on active
links which belong to the active part of the graph.
