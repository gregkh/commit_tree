printk: replacing the raw_spin_lock/unlock with raw_spin_lock/unlock_irq

In function devkmsg_read/writev/llseek/poll/open()..., the function
raw_spin_lock/unlock is used, there is potential deadlock case happening.
CPU1: thread1 doing the cat /dev/kmsg:
        raw_spin_lock(&logbuf_lock);
        while (user->seq == log_next_seq) {
when thread1 run here, at this time one interrupt is coming on CPU1 and running
based on this thread,if the interrupt handle called the printk which need the
logbuf_lock spin also, it will cause deadlock.

So we should use raw_spin_lock/unlock_irq here.
