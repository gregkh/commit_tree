blkcg: restructure configuration printing

Similarly to the previous stat restructuring, this patch restructures
conf printing code such that,

* Conf printing uses the same helpers as stat.

* Printing function doesn't require hardcoded switching on the config
  being printed.  Note that this isn't complete yet for throttle
  confs.  The next patch will convert setting for these confs and will
  complete the transition.

* Printing uses read_seq_string callback (other methods will be phased
  out).

Note that blkio_group_conf.iops[2] is changed to u64 so that they can
be manipulated with the same functions.  This is transitional and will
go away later.

After this patch, per-device configurations - weight, bps and iops -
use __blkg_prfill_u64() for printing which uses white space as
delimiter instead of tab.
