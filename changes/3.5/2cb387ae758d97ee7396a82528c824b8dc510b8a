powerpc: Fix Section mismatch warnings in prom_init.c

This patches tries to fix a couple of Section mismatch warnings like
following one:

WARNING: arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x2923c): Section mismatch
in reference from the function .prom_query_opal() to the
function .init.text:.call_prom()
The function .prom_query_opal() references
the function __init .call_prom().
This is often because .prom_query_opal lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of .call_prom is wrong.
