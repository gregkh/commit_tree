perf/x86-ibs: Implement workaround for IBS erratum #420

When disabling ibs there might be the case where hardware continuously
generates interrupts. This is described in erratum #420 (Instruction-
Based Sampling Engine May Generate Interrupt that Cannot Be Cleared).
To avoid this we must clear the counter mask first and then clear the
enable bit. This patch implements this.

See Revision Guide for AMD Family 10h Processors, Publication #41322.

Note: We now keep track of the last read ibs config value which is
then used to disable ibs. To update the config value we pass now a
pointer to the functions reading it.
