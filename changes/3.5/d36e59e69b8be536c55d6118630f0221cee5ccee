UBI: add lnum and vol_id to struct ubi_work

This is part of a multipart patch to allow UBI to force the erasure of
particular logical eraseblock numbers. In this patch, the volume id and LEB
number are added to ubi_work data structure, and both are also passed as a
parameter to schedule erase to set it appropriately. Whenever ubi_wl_put_peb
is called, the lnum is also passed to be forwarded to schedule erase. Later,
a new ubi_sync_lnum will be added to execute immediately all work related to
that lnum.

This was tested by outputting the vol_id and lnum during the schedule of
erasure. The ubi thread was disabled and two ubifs drives on separate
partitions repeated changed a small number of LEBs. The ubi module was readded,
and all the erased LEBs, corresponding to the volumes, were added to the
schedule erase queue.
