kdb: Revive dmesg command

The kgdb dmesg command is broken after the printk rework.  The old logic
in kdb code makes no sense in terms of current printk/logging storage
format, and KDB simply hangs forever.

This patch revives the command by switching to kmsg_dumper iterator.

The code is now much more simpler and shorter.
