perf/x86-ibs: Fix frequency profiling

Fixing profiling at a fixed frequency, in this case the freq value and
sample period was setup incorrectly. Since sampling periods are
adjusted we also allow periods that have lower 4 bits set.

Another fix is the setup of the hw counter: If we modify
hwc->sample_period, we also need to update hwc->last_period and
hwc->period_left.
