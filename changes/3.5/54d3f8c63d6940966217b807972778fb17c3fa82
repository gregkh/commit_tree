usb: Set device removable state based on ACPI USB data

ACPI offers two methods that allow us to infer whether or not a USB port
is removable. The _PLD method gives us information on whether the port is
"user visible" or not. If that's not present then we can fall back to the
_UPC method which tells us whether or not a port is connectable.
