x86, tlb: Switch cr3 in leave_mm() only when needed

Currently leave_mm() unconditionally switches the cr3 to swapper_pg_dir.
But there is no need to change the cr3, if we already left that mm.

intel_idle() for example calls leave_mm() on every deep c-state entry where
the CPU flushes the TLB for us. Similarly flush_tlb_all() was also calling
leave_mm() whenever the TLB is in LAZY state. Both these paths will be
improved with this change.
