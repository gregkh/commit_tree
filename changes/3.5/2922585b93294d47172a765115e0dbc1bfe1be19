lib: Sparc's strncpy_from_user is generic enough, move under lib/

To use this, an architecture simply needs to:

1) Provide a user_addr_max() implementation via asm/uaccess.h

2) Add "select GENERIC_STRNCPY_FROM_USER" to their arch Kcnfig

3) Remove the existing strncpy_from_user() implementation and symbol
   exports their architecture had.
