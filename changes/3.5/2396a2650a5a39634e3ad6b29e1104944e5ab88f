isci: fix interrupt disable

There is a (dubious?) lost irq workaround in sci_controller_isr() that
effectively nullifies attempts to disable interrupts.  Until the
workaround can be re-evaluated add some infrastructure to prevent the
interrupt handler from inadvertantly re-enabling interrupts.

The failure mode was interrupts continuing to run after the driver had
been removed and its iomappings torn down.
