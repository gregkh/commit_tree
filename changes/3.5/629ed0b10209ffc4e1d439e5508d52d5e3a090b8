blkcg: move statistics update code to policies

As with conf/stats file handling code, there's no reason for stat
update code to live in blkcg core with policies calling into update
them.  The current organization is both inflexible and complex.

This patch moves stat update code to specific policies.  All
blkiocg_update_*_stats() functions which deal with BLKIO_POLICY_PROP
stats are collapsed into their cfq_blkiocg_update_*_stats()
counterparts.  blkiocg_update_dispatch_stats() is used by both
policies and duplicated as throtl_update_dispatch_stats() and
cfq_blkiocg_update_dispatch_stats().  This will be cleaned up later.
