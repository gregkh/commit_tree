ring-buffer: Fix crash due to uninitialized new_pages list head

The new_pages list head in the cpu_buffer is not initialized. When
adding pages to the ring buffer, if the memory allocation fails in
ring_buffer_resize, the clean up handler tries to free up the allocated
pages from all the cpu buffers. The panic is caused by referencing the
uninitialized new_pages list head.

Initializing the new_pages list head in rb_allocate_cpu_buffer fixes
this.
