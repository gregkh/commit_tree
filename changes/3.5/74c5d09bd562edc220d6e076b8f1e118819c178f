Extcon: support notification based on the state changes.

State changes of extcon devices have been notified via kobjet_uevent.
This patch adds notifier interfaces in order to allow device drivers to
get notified easily. Along with notifier interface,
extcon_get_extcon_dev() function is added so that device drivers may
discover a extcon_dev easily.
