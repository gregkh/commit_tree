staging: comedi: resolve section mismatch in s626

s626_attach is referencing s626_pci_table which is annotated
__devinitconst. Put pci vendor/device ids in the s626_board struct and
use s626_boards instead similar to what is done in gsc_hpdi.

v2: I had moved the PCI id defines to s626.h earlier, but later
decided to leave them in s626.c and forgot to move them up above where
they are being used in s626_boards.
