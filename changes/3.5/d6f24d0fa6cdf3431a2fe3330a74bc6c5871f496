drm/i915: cache the EDID for eDP panels

They aren't going anywhere, and probing on DDC can cause the panel to
blank briefly, so read them up front and cache them for later queries.

v2: fix potential NULL derefs in intel_dp_get_edid_modes and
    intel_dp_get_edid (Jani)
    copy full EDID length, including extension blocks (Takashi)
    free EDID on teardown (Takashi)
v3: malloc a new EDID buffer that's big enough for the memcpy (Chris)
v4: change handling of NULL EDIDs, just preserve the NULL behavior
    across detects and mode list fetches rather than trying to re-fetch
    the EDID (Chris)
v5: be glad that Chris is around to remind me to hit C-x C-s before
    committing.
