ALSA: hda - Fix power-map regression for HP dv6 & co

The recent fix for power-map controls (commit b0791dda813) caused
regressions on some other HP laptops.  They have fixed pins but these
pins are exposed as jack-detectable.  Thus the driver tries to control
the power-map dynamically per jack detection where it never gets on.

This patch adds the check of connection and it assumes the no jack
detection is available for fixed pins no matter what pin capability
says.
