MCA: delete all remaining traces of microchannel bus support.

Hardware with MCA bus is limited to 386 and 486 class machines
that are now 20+ years old and typically with less than 32MB
of memory.  A quick search on the internet, and you see that
even the MCA hobbyist/enthusiast community has lost interest
in the early 2000 era and never really even moved ahead from
the 2.4 kernels to the 2.6 series.

This deletes anything remaining related to CONFIG_MCA from core
kernel code and from the x86 architecture.  There is no point in
carrying this any further into the future.

One complication to watch for is inadvertently scooping up
stuff relating to machine check, since there is overlap in
the TLA name space (e.g. arch/x86/boot/mca.c).
