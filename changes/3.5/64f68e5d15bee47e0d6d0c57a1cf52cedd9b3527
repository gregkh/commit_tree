mac80211: remove channel type argument from rate_update

The channel type argument to the rate_update()
callback isn't really the correct way to give
the rate control algorithm about the desired
RX bandwidth of the peer.

Remove this argument, and instead update the
STA capabilities with 20/40 appropriately. The
SMPS update done by this callback works in the
same way, so this makes the callback cleaner.
