drivers/rtc/rtc-tegra.c: clean up probe/remove routines

Use the devres managed resource functions in the probe routine.  Also
affects the remove routine where the previously used free and release
functions are not needed.

The devm_* functions eliminate the need for manual resource releasing and
simplify error handling.  Resources allocated by devm_* are freed
automatically on driver detach.
