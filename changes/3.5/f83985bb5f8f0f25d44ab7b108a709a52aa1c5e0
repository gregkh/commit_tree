wlcore/wl12xx: turn no-Tx-align quirk into Tx-align

Inverting the quirk flag to indicate Tx-alignment. This aligns it with
the similar Rx-side quirk.

The call to wl1271_set_block_size() decides whether SDIO block size
alignment can be used or not.  In case we're using SPI, we can't use
the block size alignment, so the function returns false.  So we set
the quirk when wl1271_set_block_size() returns true and let the wl12xx
lower driver unset the bit for wl127x (since it doesn't support this
quirk).
