tty: hold lock across tty buffer finding and buffer filling

tty_buffer_request_room is well protected, but while after it returns,
 it releases the port->lock. tty->buf.tail might be modified
by either irq handler or other threads. The patch adds more protection
by holding the lock across tty buffer finding and buffer filling.
