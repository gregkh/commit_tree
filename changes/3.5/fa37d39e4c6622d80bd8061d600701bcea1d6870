drm/i915: Retry reading the PCH FDI receiver ISR

According to the PRM (Vol3P2), the PCH FDI receiver ISR read for bit lock
should be retried at least once. This patch retries the read 5 times
with a small delay in between reads. I've had reports of display corruption
on resume with "FDI train 1 fail!", so I'm hoping that adding this retry
will mitigate the issue.
