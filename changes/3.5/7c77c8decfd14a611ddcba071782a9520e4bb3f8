OMAP2+: UART: Remove cpu checks for populating errata flags

Currently the errata is populated based on cpu checks this can
be removed and replaced with module version check of uart ip block.
MVR reg is provided within the uart reg map use the same
to populate the errata and thus now errata population and handling
can be managed within the driver itself.
