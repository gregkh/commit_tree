ceph: define ceph_auth_handshake type

The definitions for the ceph_mds_session and ceph_osd both contain
five fields related only to "authorizers."  Encapsulate those fields
into their own struct type, allowing for better isolation in some
upcoming patches.

Fix the #includes in "linux/ceph/osd_client.h" to lay out their more
complete canonical path.
