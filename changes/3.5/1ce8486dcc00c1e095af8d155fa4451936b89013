jbd: protect all log tail updates with j_checkpoint_mutex

There are some log tail updates that are not protected by j_checkpoint_mutex.
Some of these are harmless because they happen during startup or shutdown but
updates in journal_commit_transaction() and journal_flush() can really race
with other log tail updates (e.g. someone doing journal_flush() with someone
running cleanup_journal_tail()). So protect all log tail updates with
j_checkpoint_mutex.
