params: replace printk(KERN_<LVL>...) with pr_<lvl>(...)

I left 1 printk which uses __FILE__, __LINE__ explicitly, which should
not be subject to generic preferences expressed via pr_fmt().

+ tweaks suggested by Joe Perches:
- add doing to irq-enabled warning, like others.  It wont happen often..
- change sysfs failure crit, not just err, make it 1 line in logs.
- coalese 2 format fragments into 1 >80 char line
