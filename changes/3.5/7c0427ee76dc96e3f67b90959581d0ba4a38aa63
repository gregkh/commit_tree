e1000e: suggest a possible workaround to a device hang on 82577/8

There is a known issue in the 82577 and 82578 device that can cause a hang
in the device hardware during traffic stress; the current workaround in the
driver is to disable transmit flow control by default.  If the user enables
transmit flow control and the device hang occurs, provide a message in the
syslog suggesting to re-enable the workaround.
