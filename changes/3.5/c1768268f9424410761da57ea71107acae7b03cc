blkcg: don't use blkg->plid in stat related functions

blkg is scheduled to be unified for all policies and thus there won't
be one-to-one mapping from blkg to policy.  Update stat related
functions to take explicit @pol or @plid arguments and not use
blkg->plid.

This is painful for now but most of specific stat interface functions
will be replaced with a handful of generic helpers.
