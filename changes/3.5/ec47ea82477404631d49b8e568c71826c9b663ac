skb: Add inline helper for getting the skb end offset from head

With the recent changes for how we compute the skb truesize it occurs to me
we are probably going to have a lot of calls to skb_end_pointer -
skb->head.  Instead of running all over the place doing that it would make
more sense to just make it a separate inline skb_end_offset(skb) that way
we can return the correct value without having gcc having to do all the
optimization to cancel out skb->head - skb->head.
