ceph: drop support for preferred_osd pgs

This was an ill-conceived feature that has been removed from Ceph.  Do
this gracefully:

 - reject attempts to specify a preferred_osd via the ioctl
 - stop exposing this information via virtual xattrs
 - always fill in -1 for requests, in case we talk to an older server
 - don't calculate preferred_osd placements/pgids
