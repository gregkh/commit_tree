sh: Fix up se7721 GPIOLIB=y build warnings.

Presently the SH7720/21 serial code uses asm/gpio.h to get at the CPU
GPIO port definitions, but in the case of GPIOLIB=y this also includes
references to generic GPIOLIB routines that we don't have any function
declarations for, tripping up on -Werror=implicit-function-declaration
with newer gcc versions:

Switch to using the cpu/ version for the port definitions explicitly.
