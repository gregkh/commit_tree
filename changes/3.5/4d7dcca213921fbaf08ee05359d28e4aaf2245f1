mm/memcg: get_lru_size not get_lruvec_size

Konstantin just introduced mem_cgroup_get_lruvec_size() and
get_lruvec_size(), I'm about to add mem_cgroup_update_lru_size(): but
we're dealing with the same thing, lru_size[lru].  We ought to agree on
the naming, and I do think lru_size is the more correct: so rename his
ones to get_lru_size().
