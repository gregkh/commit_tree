xfs: prevent recursion in xfs_buf_iorequest

If the b_iodone handler is run in calling context in xfs_buf_iorequest we
can run into a recursion where xfs_buf_iodone_callbacks keeps calling back
into xfs_buf_iorequest because an I/O error happened, which keeps calling
back into xfs_buf_iorequest.  This chain will usually not take long
because the filesystem gets shut down because of log I/O errors, but even
over a short time it can cause stack overflows if run on the same context.

As a short term workaround make sure we always call the iodone handler in
workqueue context.
