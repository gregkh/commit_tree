mm/buddy: dump PG_compound_lock page flag

The array pageflag_names[] does conversion from page flags into their
corresponding names so that a meaningful representation of the
corresponding page flag can be printed.  This mechanism is used while
dumping page frames.  However, the array missed PG_compound_lock.  So
the PG_compound_lock page flag would be printed as a digital number
instead of a meaningful string.

The patch fixes that and prints "compound_lock" for the PG_compound_lock
page flag.
