blkcg: move blkio_group_stats to cfq-iosched.c

blkio_group_stats contains only fields used by cfq and has no reason
to be defined in blkcg core.

* Move blkio_group_stats to cfq-iosched.c and rename it to cfqg_stats.

* blkg_policy_data->stats is replaced with cfq_group->stats.
  blkg_prfill_[rw]stat() are updated to use offset against pd->pdata
  instead.

* All related macros / functions are renamed so that they have cfqg_
  prefix and the unnecessary @pol arguments are dropped.

* All stat functions now take cfq_group * instead of blkio_group *.

* lockdep assertion on queue lock dropped.  Elevator runs under queue
  lock by default.  There isn't much to be gained by adding lockdep
  assertions at stat function level.

* cfqg_stats_reset() implemented for blkio_reset_group_stats_fn method
  so that cfqg->stats can be reset.
