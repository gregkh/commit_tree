shmem: replace page if mapping excludes its zone

The GMA500 GPU driver uses GEM shmem objects, but with a new twist: the
backing RAM has to be below 4GB.  Not a problem while the boards
supported only 4GB: but now Intel's D2700MUD boards support 8GB, and
their GMA3600 is managed by the GMA500 driver.

shmem/tmpfs has never pretended to support hardware restrictions on the
backing memory, but it might have appeared to do so before v3.1, and
even now it works fine until a page is swapped out then back in.  When
read_cache_page_gfp() supplied a freshly allocated page for copy, that
compensated for whatever choice might have been made by earlier swapin
readahead; but swapoff was likely to destroy the illusion.

We'd like to continue to support GMA500, so now add a new
shmem_should_replace_page() check on the zone when about to move a page
from swapcache to filecache (in swapin and swapoff cases), with
shmem_replace_page() to allocate and substitute a suitable page (given
gma500/gem.c's mapping_set_gfp_mask GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_DMA32).

This does involve a minor extension to mem_cgroup_replace_page_cache()
(the page may or may not have already been charged); and I've removed a
comment and call to mem_cgroup_uncharge_cache_page(), which in fact is
always a no-op while PageSwapCache.

Also removed optimization of an unlikely path in shmem_getpage_gfp(),
now that we need to check PageSwapCache more carefully (a racing caller
might already have made the copy).  And at one point shmem_unuse_inode()
needs to use the hitherto private page_swapcount(), to guard against
racing with inode eviction.

It would make sense to extend shmem_should_replace_page(), to cover
cpuset and NUMA mempolicy restrictions too, but set that aside for now:
needs a cleanup of shmem mempolicy handling, and more testing, and ought
to handle swap faults in do_swap_page() as well as shmem.
