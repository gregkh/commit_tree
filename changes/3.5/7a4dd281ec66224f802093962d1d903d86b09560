blkcg: kill the mind-bending blkg->dev

blkg->dev is dev_t recording the device number of the block device for
the associated request_queue.  It is used to identify the associated
block device when printing out configuration or stats.

This is redundant to begin with.  A blkg is an association between a
cgroup and a request_queue and it of course is possible to reach
request_queue from blkg and synchronization conventions are in place
for safe q dereferencing, so this shouldn't be necessary from the
beginning.  Furthermore, it's initialized by sscanf()ing the device
name of backing_dev_info.  The mind boggles.

Anyways, if blkg is visible under rcu lock, we *know* that the
associated request_queue hasn't gone away yet and its bdi is
registered and alive - blkg can't be created for request_queue which
hasn't been fully initialized and it can't go away before blkg is
removed.

Let stat and conf read functions get device name from
blkg->q->backing_dev_info.dev and pass it down to printing functions
and remove blkg->dev.
