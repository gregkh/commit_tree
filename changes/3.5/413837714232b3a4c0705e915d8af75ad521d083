KVM: Introduce bitmask for apic attention reasons

The patch introduces a bitmap that will hold reasons apic should be
checked during vmexit. This is in a preparation for vp eoi patch
that will add one more check on vmexit. With the bitmap we can do
if(apic_attention) to check everything simultaneously which will
add zero overhead on the fast path.
