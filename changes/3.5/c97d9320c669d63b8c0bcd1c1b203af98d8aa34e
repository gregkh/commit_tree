ARM: msm: Drop useless teq from DEBUG_LL support

This teq was first introduced in bcc0f6a ([ARM] msm: clean up
iomap and devices, 2008-09-10). It seems that DEBUG_LL support on
MSM at the time had to remove the virtual mapping for the uart
base. Thus when the MMU was enabled the addruart macro returned 0
and the senduart macro would test for 0 and do nothing. It was a
simple way to turn off DEBUG_LL when the MMU was enabled.

The virtual mapping was added back in 6339f66 (msm: make
debugging UART (for DEBUG_LL) configurable, 2009-11-02) but the
patch forgot to remove the teq here. So as it stands the teq has
been useless for two years and DEBUG_LL works fine without it.
