drm/radeon: fixup tiling group size and backendmap on r6xx-r9xx (v4)

Tiling group size is always 256bits on r6xx/r7xx/r8xx/9xx. Also fix and
simplify render backend map. This now properly sets up the backend map
on r6xx-9xx which should improve 3D performance.

Vadim benchmarked also:
Some benchmarks on juniper (5750), fullscreen 1920x1080,
first result - kernel 3.4.0+ (fb21affa), second - with these patches:

Lightsmark:   91 fps => 123 fps    +35%
Doom3:        74 fps => 101 fps    +36%
