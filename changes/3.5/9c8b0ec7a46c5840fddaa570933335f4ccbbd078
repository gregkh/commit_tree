ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: control all hardreset lines attached to a hwmod

Parts of the hwmod code test to see if a module has one and only one
hardreset line before taking an action.  It seems more appropriate
to control all hardreset lines associated with a hwmod, not just one.

It so happens that with the current hwmod data, this patch will not
change any behavior, since hwmods with hardreset lines have only one
hardreset line associated with them, and 'pseudo-hwmods' are used to
handle the other hardreset lines.  But future hwmod data patches to
remove the pseudo-hwmods will change this.
