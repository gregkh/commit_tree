md/raid1: close some possible races on write errors during resync

commit 4367af556133723d0f443e14ca8170d9447317cb
   md/raid1: clear bad-block record when write succeeds.

Added a 'reschedule_retry' call possibility at the end of
end_sync_write, but didn't add matching code at the end of
sync_request_write.  So if the writes complete very quickly, or
scheduling makes it seem that way, then we can miss rescheduling
the request and the resync could hang.

Also commit 73d5c38a9536142e062c35997b044e89166e063b
    md: avoid races when stopping resync.

Fix a race condition in this same code in end_sync_write but didn't
make the change in sync_request_write.

This patch updates sync_request_write to fix both of those.
Patch is suitable for 3.1 and later kernels.
