mac80211: clear ifmgd->bssid only after building DELBA

ieee80211_set_disassoc() clears ifmgd->bssid before
building DELBA frames, resulting in frames with invalid
bssid ("00:00:00:00:00:00").

Fix it by clearing ifmgd->bssid only after building
all the needed frames.

After this change, we no longer need to save the
bssid (before clearing it), so remove the local array.
