KVM: PPC: e500mc: Move r1/r2 restoration very early

If we hit any exception whatsoever in the restore path and r1/r2 aren't the
host registers, we don't get a working oops. So it's always a good idea to
restore them as early as possible.

This time, it actually has practical reasons to do so too, since we need to
have the host page fault handler fix up our guest instruction read code. And
for that to work we need r1/r2 restored.
