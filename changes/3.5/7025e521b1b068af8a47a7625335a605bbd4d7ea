[media] bttv: The Hauppauge 61334 needs the msp3410 to do radio demodulation

The (radio) audio out from the tuner (which can also demod FM radio) does not
seem to be hooked up to the msp3410 on this board in any way, so the only way
to get sound from the radio part is to make the msp3410 do the FM radio demod.

The msp3410 can handle this fine, but it is a bit weird compared to how it
is handled on other boards.
