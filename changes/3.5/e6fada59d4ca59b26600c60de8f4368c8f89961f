ARM: ux500: Re-enable SMSC911x platform code registration during non-DT boots

The patch to disable SMSC911x registration was applied twice in the upstream
kernel by mistake. Git interpreted this as 'take the same entry from a
similar struct' which was close by. This was the wrong thing to do. This patch
rectifies this error and re-enables SMSC911x registration when Device Tree is
not enabled.
