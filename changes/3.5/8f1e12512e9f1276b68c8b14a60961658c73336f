w1: Disable irqs during 1-wire bus operations, extend 1-wire reset pulse

This patch offers the possibility to disables irqs during w1_write_bit()
and w1_reset_bus() operations as timing requirements are very strict for
the 1-wire bus protocol. Per default interrupts are enabled but can be
disabled via the module parameter "w1_disable_irqs".

Extend 1-wire reset pulse length from 480us to 500us as 480us is the
minimum requirement for the 1-wire reset/presence pulse.
