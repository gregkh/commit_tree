ARM: S3C24XX: Correct CAMIF interrupt definitions

Properly define the CAMIF interrupt resources. This device have two
interrupts - corresponding to the "codec" and "preview" data paths.
IRQ_CAM is handled internally by the architecture and demultiplexed
to IRQ_S3C2440_CAM_C and IRQ_S3C2440_CAM_P - these interrupts only
should be handled in the driver.
