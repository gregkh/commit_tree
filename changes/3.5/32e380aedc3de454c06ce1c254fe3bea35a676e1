blkcg: make CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP bool

Block cgroup core can be built as module; however, it isn't too useful
as blk-throttle can only be built-in and cfq-iosched is usually the
default built-in scheduler.  Scheduled blkcg cleanup requires calling
into blkcg from block core.  To simplify that, disallow building blkcg
as module by making CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP bool.

If building blkcg core as module really matters, which I doubt, we can
revisit it after blkcg API cleanup.

-v2: Vivek pointed out that IOSCHED_CFQ was incorrectly updated to
     depend on BLK_CGROUP.  Fixed.
