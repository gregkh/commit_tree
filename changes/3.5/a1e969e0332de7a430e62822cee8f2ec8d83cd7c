drm/i915: [GEN7] Use HW scheduler for fixed function shaders

This originally started as a patch from Bernard as a way of simply
setting the VS scheduler. After submitting the RFC patch, we decided to
also modify the DS scheduler. To be most explicit, I've made the patch
explicitly set all scheduler modes, and included the defines for other
modes (in case someone feels frisky later).

The rest of the story gets a bit weird. The first version of the patch
showed an almost unbelievable performance improvement. Since rebasing my
branch it appears the performance improvement has gone, unfortunately.
But setting these bits seem to be the right thing to do given that the
docs describe corruption that can occur with the default settings.

In summary, I am seeing no more perf improvements (or regressions) in my
limited testing, but we believe this should be set to prevent rendering
corruption, therefore cc stable.

v1: Clear bit 4 also (Ken + Eugeni)
Do a full clear + set of the bits we want (Me).
