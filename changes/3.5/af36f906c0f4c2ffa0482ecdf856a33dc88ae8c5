memcg: always create memsw files if CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP

Instead of conditioning creation of memsw files on do_swap_account,
always create the files if compiled-in and fail read/write attempts
with -EOPNOTSUPP if !do_swap_account.

This is suggested by KAMEZAWA to simplify memcg file creation so that
it can use cgroup->subsys_cftypes.
