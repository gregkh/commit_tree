watchdog: iTCO_wdt: add platform driver module alias

The recent conversion of iTCO_wdt resulted in the driver no longer
getting loaded automatically, since it no longer has a
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() included. As the lpc_ich driver now creates a
platform device, auto-loading can easily be done by having a respective
module alias in place.
