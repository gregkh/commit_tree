ARM: OMAP3: hwmod data: add IVA hard reset lines, main clock, clockdomain

The IVA hwmod data is missing some fields that cause the following
warning on boot:

[    0.118011] omap_hwmod: iva: cannot be enabled for reset (3)

Fix by encoding the IP block's main functional clock, reset lines, and
clockdomain.
