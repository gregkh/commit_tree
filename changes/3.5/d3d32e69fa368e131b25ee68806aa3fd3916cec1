blkcg: restructure statistics printing

blkcg stats handling is a mess.  None of the stats has much to do with
blkcg core but they are all implemented in blkcg core.  Code sharing
is achieved by mixing common code with hard-coded cases for each stat
counter.

This patch restructures statistics printing such that

* Common logic exists as helper functions and specific print functions
  use the helpers to implement specific cases.

* Printing functions serving multiple counters don't require hardcoded
  switching on specific counters.

* Printing uses read_seq_string callback (other methods will be phased
  out).

This change enables further cleanups and relocating stats code to the
policy implementation it belongs to.
