blkcg: move rcu_read_lock() outside of blkio_group get functions

rcu_read_lock() in throtl_get_tb() and cfq_get_cfqg() holds onto
@blkcg while looking up blkg.  For API cleanup, the next patch will
make the caller responsible for determining @blkcg to look blkg from
and let them specify it as a parameter.  Move rcu read locking out to
the callers to prepare for the change.

-v2: Originally this patch was described as a fix for RCU read locking
     bug around @blkg, which Vivek pointed out to be incorrect.  It
     was from misunderstanding the role of rcu locking as protecting
     @blkg not @blkcg.  Patch description updated.
