Btrfs: fix wrong check during log recovery

When we're evicting an inode during log recovery, we need to ensure that the inode
is not in orphan state any more, which means inode's run_time flags has _no_
BTRFS_INODE_HAS_ORPHAN_ITEM.  Thus, the BUG_ON was triggered because of a wrong
check for the flags.
