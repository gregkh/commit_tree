drm/i915: initialize DDI buffer translations

DDI is introduced starting with Haswell GPU generation. So to simplify its
management in the future, we also add intel_ddi.c to hold all the
DDI-related items.

Buffer translations for DDI links must be initialized prior to enablement.
For FDI and DP, first 9 pairs of values are used to select the connection
parameters. HDMI uses the last pair of values and ignores the first 9
pairs. So we program HDMI values in both cases, which allows HDMI to work
over both FDI and DP-friendly buffers.
