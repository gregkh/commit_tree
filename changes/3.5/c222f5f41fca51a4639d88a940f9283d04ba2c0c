m68knommu: switch to GPIO init macros in ColdFire 528x init code

Modify the GPIO setup table to use the mcfgpio.h macros for table init.
Simplifies code and reduces line count significantly.

We also need to rename some of the GPIO registers to be consistent with
all other ColdFire parts (we can't use the new GPIO macros otherwise).
