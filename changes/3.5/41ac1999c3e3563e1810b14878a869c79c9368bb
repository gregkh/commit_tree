mm: vmscan: do not stall on writeback during memory compaction

This patch stops reclaim/compaction entering sync reclaim as this was
only intended for lumpy reclaim and an oversight.  Page migration has
its own logic for stalling on writeback pages if necessary and memory
compaction is already using it.

Waiting on page writeback is bad for a number of reasons but the primary
one is that waiting on writeback to a slow device like USB can take a
considerable length of time.  Page reclaim instead uses
wait_iff_congested() to throttle if too many dirty pages are being
scanned.
