ARM: EXYNOS: register devices in 'need_restore' state for pm_domains

Commit ca1d72f033 ('PM / Domains: Make it possible to add devices to
inactive domains') introduced possibility to add devices to inactive
power domains and added pm_genpd_dev_need_restore() function which lets
platform core to notify power domain core that the specified device must
be restored (with its runtime_resume() callback) before first use.

This patch adds the pm_genpd_dev_need_restore() call what brings back
the suspend/resume behaviour for the client devices known from the
previous power domain driver (removed by commit 91cfbd4ee0 - 'ARM:
EXYNOS: Hook up power domains to generic power domain infrastructure').
Client device drivers relay on that suspend/resume behaviour, thus this
patch fixes runtime pm operation for client devices.
