PCI: work around Stratus ftServer broken PCIe hierarchy

A PCIe downstream port is a P2P bridge.  Its secondary interface is
a link that should lead only to device 0 (unless ARI is enabled)[1], so
we don't probe for non-zero device numbers.

Some Stratus ftServer systems have a PCIe downstream port (02:00.0) that
leads to both an upstream port (03:00.0) and a downstream port (03:01.0),
and 03:01.0 has important devices below it:

  [0000:02]-+-00.0-[03-3c]--+-00.0-[04-09]--...
                            \-01.0-[0a-0d]--+-[USB]
                                            +-[NIC]
                                            +-...

Previously, we didn't enumerate device 03:01.0, so USB and the network
didn't work.  This patch adds a DMI quirk to scan all device numbers,
not just 0, below a downstream port.

Based on a patch by Prarit Bhargava.
