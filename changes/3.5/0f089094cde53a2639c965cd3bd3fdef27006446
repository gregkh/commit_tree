usb: gadget: ci13xxx: replace home-brewed logging with dev_{err,warn,info}

Logging output in the driver is mostly done using custom err/warn/info
macros which rely on the existence of the global variable _udc, which
is a global reference to the udc controller structure. This reference
will have to go in order to allow us to have more than one chipidea udc
in the system.

Thus, replace custom macros with dev_{err,warn,info} using the platform
device where possible. The trace() macro, which is a nop by default is
left for tracing purposes.
