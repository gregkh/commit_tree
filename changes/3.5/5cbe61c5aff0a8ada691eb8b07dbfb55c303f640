usb-serial: ftdi_sio: fix oops during autosuspend

This patch (as1550) fixes a bug in the usb-serial core that affects
the ftdi_sio driver and most likely others as well.  The core
implements suspend and resume routines, but it doesn't store pointers
to those routines in the usb_driver structures that it registers,
even though it does set those drivers' supports_autosuspend flag.  The
end result is that when one of these devices is autosuspended, we try
to call through a NULL pointer.

The patch fixes the problem by setting the suspend and resume method
pointers to the appropriate routines in the USB serial core, along
with the supports_autosuspend field, in each driver as it is
registered.

This should be back-ported to all the stable kernels that have the new
usb_serial_register_drivers() interface.
