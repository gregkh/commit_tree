xen/p2m: Allow alloc_p2m_middle to call reserve_brk depending on argument

For identity cases we want to call reserve_brk only on the boundary
conditions of the middle P2M (so P2M[x][y][0] = extend_brk). This is
to work around identify regions (PCI spaces, gaps in E820) which are not
aligned on 2MB regions.

However for the case were we want to allocate P2M middle leafs at the
early bootup stage, irregardless of this alignment check we need some
means of doing that.  For that we provide the new argument.
