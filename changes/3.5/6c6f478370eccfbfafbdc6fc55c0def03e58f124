drm/radeon: rework recursive gpu reset handling

Instead of all this humpy pumpy with recursive
mutex (which also fixes only halve of the problem)
move the actual gpu reset out of the fence code,
return -EDEADLK and then reset the gpu in the
calling ioctl function.

v2: Split removal of radeon_mutex into separate patch.
    Return -EAGAIN if reset is successful.
