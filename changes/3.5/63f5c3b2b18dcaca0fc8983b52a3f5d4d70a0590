clk: prevent spurious parent rate propagation

Patch 'clk: always pass parent_rate into .round_rate' made a subtle
change to the semantics of .round_rate.  It is now expected for the
parent's rate to always be passed in, simplifying the implemenation of
various .round_rate callback definitions.

However the patch also introduced a bug in clk_calc_new_rates whereby a
clock without the CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag set could still propagate a
rate change up to a parent clock if the the .round_rate callback
modified the &best_parent_rate value in any way.

This patch fixes the issue at the framework level (in
clk_calc_new_rates) by specifically handling the case where the
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag is not set.
