target/file: Use O_DSYNC by default for FILEIO backends

Convert to use O_DSYNC for all cases at FILEIO backend creation time to
avoid the extra syncing of pure timestamp updates with legacy O_SYNC during
default operation as recommended by hch.  Continue to do this independently of
Write Cache Enable (WCE) bit, as WCE=0 is currently the default for all backend
devices and enabled by user on per device basis via attrib/emulate_write_cache.

This patch drops the now unnecessary fd_buffered_io= token usage that was
originally signalling when to explictly disable O_SYNC at backend creation
time for buffered I/O operation.  This can end up being dangerous for a number
of reasons during physical node failure, so go ahead and drop this option
for now when O_DSYNC is used as the default.

Also allow explict FUA WRITEs -> vfs_fsync_range() call to function in
fd_execute_cmd() independently of WCE bit setting.
