[SCSI] bnx2fc: Allocate fcoe_ctlr with bnx2fc_interface, not as a member

    Currently the fcoe_ctlr associated with an interface is allocated
    as a member of struct bnx2fc_interface. This causes problems when
    when later patches attempt to use the new fcoe_sysfs APIs which
    allow us to allocate the bnx2fc_interface as private data to a
    fcoe_ctlr_device instance. The problem is that libfcoe wants to
    be able use pointer math to find a fcoe_ctlr's fcoe_ctlr_device
    as well as finding a fcoe_ctlr_device's assocated fcoe_ctlr. To
    do this we need to allocate the fcoe_ctlr_device, with private
    data for the LLD. The private data will contain the fcoe_ctlr
    and its private data will be the bnx2fc_interface.

    +-------------------+
    | fcoe_ctlr_device  |
    +-------------------+
    | fcoe_ctlr         |
    +-------------------+
    | bnx2fc_interface  |
    +-------------------+

    This prep work will allow us to go from a fcoe_ctlr_device
    instance to its fcoe_ctlr as well as from a fcoe_ctlr to its
    fcoe_ctlr_device once the fcoe_sysfs API is in use (later
    patches in this series).
