staging: comedi: refactor the icp_multi driver to remove forward declarations

Move the setup_channel_list function forward in the souce and the
struct comedi_driver and associated variables to the end of the
source. This is more typical of how other drivers are written and
removes the need for the forward declarations.

Remove the unnecessary comments for the attach/detach functions.

Change the initialization of struct boardtype to c99 syntax and
remove the comments.

Convert the driver to use the module_comedi_driver() macro which
makes the code smaller and a bit simpler.
