netfilter: nf_ct_ecache: fix crash with multiple containers, one shutting down

Hans reports that he's still hitting:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 000000000000027c
IP: [<ffffffff813615db>] netlink_has_listeners+0xb/0x60
PGD 0
Oops: 0000 [#3] PREEMPT SMP
CPU 0

It happens when adding a number of containers with do:

nfct_query(h, NFCT_Q_CREATE, ct);

and most likely one namespace shuts down.

this problem was supposed to be fixed by:
70e9942 netfilter: nf_conntrack: make event callback registration per-netns

Still, it was missing one rcu_access_pointer to check if the callback
is set or not.
