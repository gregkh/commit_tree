[media] snd_tea575x: Report correct frequency range for EU/US versus JA models

My EU/US 5757 cannot tune below approx 86 Mhz, that is below that it
does not even generate the standard not tuned to anything radio noise anymore,
so clearly the 5757 cannot tune to the Japanese frequencies. This patch
assumes that likewise the 5759 cannot tune to the EU/US frequencies.
