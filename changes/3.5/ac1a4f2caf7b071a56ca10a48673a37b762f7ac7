Staging: VME: Ensure TSI148 link list descriptors are written big endian

The DMA functionality fails to work on little endian processors, such as
found on x86 based platforms. The DMA engine copies the link list
descriptors from memory into big endian registers. On little endian systems
this results in the values being byte swapped. This patch uses standard
kernel functionality to ensure that the descriptors are stored in big
endian format.
