drm/i915: IBX+ doesn't have separate vsync/hsync controls on the VGA DAC

When the PCH split occurred, hw dropped support for separate hsync and
vsync disable in the VGA DAC.  So add a PCH specific DPMS function that
just uses the port enable bit for controlling DPMS states.

Before this fix, when anything other than a full DPMS off occurred,
the VGA port would be left enabled and scanning out while all the other
heads would turn off as expected.
