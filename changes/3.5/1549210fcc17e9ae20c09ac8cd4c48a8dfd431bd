NFSv4: Fix an Oops in the open recovery code

The open recovery code does not need to request a new value for the
mdsthreshold, and so does not allocate a struct nfs4_threshold.
The problem is that encode_getfattr_open() will still request an
mdsthreshold, and so we end up Oopsing in decode_attr_mdsthreshold.

This patch fixes encode_getfattr_open so that it doesn't request an
mdsthreshold when the caller isn't asking for one. It also fixes
decode_attr_mdsthreshold so that it errors if the server returns
an mdsthreshold that we didn't ask for (instead of Oopsing).
