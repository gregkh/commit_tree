PM / Domains: Rework default domain power off governor function, v2

The existing default domain power down governor function for PM
domains, default_power_down_ok(), is supposed to check whether or not
the PM QoS latency constraints of the devices in the domain will be
violated if the domain is turned off by pm_genpd_poweroff().
However, the computations carried out by it don't reflect the
definition of the PM QoS latency constrait in
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-devices-power.

Make default_power_down_ok() follow the definition of the PM QoS
latency constrait.  In particular, make it only take latencies into
account, because it doesn't matter how much time has elapsed since
the domain's devices were suspended for the computation.

Remove the break_even_ns and power_off_time fields from
struct generic_pm_domain, because they are not necessary any more.
