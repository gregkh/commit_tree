x86-64: Handle exception table entries during early boot

If we get an exception during early boot, walk the exception table to
see if we should intercept it.  The main use case for this is to allow
rdmsr_safe()/wrmsr_safe() during CPU initialization.

Since the exception table is currently sorted at runtime, and fairly
late in startup, this code walks the exception table linearly.  We
obviously don't need to worry about modules, however: none have been
loaded at this point.

[ v2: Use early_fixup_exception() instead of linear search ]
