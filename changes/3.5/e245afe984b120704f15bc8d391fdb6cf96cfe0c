[media] videodev2.h: Fix VIDIOC_QUERYMENU ioctl regression

Fixes a regression in VIDIOC_QUERYMENU introduced when the __s64 value
field was added to the union. On a 64-bit system this will change the
size of this v4l2_querymenu structure from 44 to 48 bytes, thus
breaking the ABI. By adding the packed attribute it is working again.

Tested on both 64 and 32 bit systems.
