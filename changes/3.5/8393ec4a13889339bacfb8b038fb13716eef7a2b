ALSA: hda - HDMI Audio init all connectors when VGA-switcheroo is off

When VGA_SWITCHEROO support is enabled hda_intel initialises the HDMI
audio device on the current VGA device.  When it's not enabled it only
initialises the HDMI device on the default VGA adaptor, this means
secondary cards get no audio support which is very unhelpful for
multi-seat!

With this patch, when SUPPORT_VGA_SWITCHEROO is disabled hda_intel
initialises all HDMI audio devices, not just the default VGA.
