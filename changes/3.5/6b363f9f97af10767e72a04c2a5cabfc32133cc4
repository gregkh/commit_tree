[media] uvcvideo: Fix V4L2 button controls that share the same UVC control

The Logitech pan/tilt reset UVC control contains two V4L2 button
controls to reset pan and tilt. As the UVC control is not marked as
auto-update, the button bits are set but never reset. A pan reset that
follows a tilt reset would thus reset both pan and tilt.

Fix this by not caching the control value of write-only controls. All
standard UVC controls are either readable or auto-update, so this will
not cause any regression and will not result in extra USB requests.
