m68knommu: introduce macros to simplify ColdFire GPIO table initialization

We have very large tables in the ColdFire CPU GPIO setup code that essentially
boil down to 2 distinct types of GPIO pin initiaization. Using 2 macros we can
reduce these large tables to at most a dozen lines of setup code, and in quite
a few cases a single table entry.

Introduce these 2 macros into the existing mcfgpio.h header.
