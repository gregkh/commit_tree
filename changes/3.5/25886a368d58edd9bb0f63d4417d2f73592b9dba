UBI: always dump the stack on error

UBI (and UBIFS) are a bit over-engineered WRT debugging. The idea was to
link as few as possible when debugging is disabled, but the downside is
that most people produce bug reports which are difficult to understand.

This patch weeds out the 'ubi_dbg_dump_stack()' function and turns it
into 'dump_stack()' - it is always useful to have stack dump in case of
an error.
