cfg80211: add channel switch notify event

The firmware may decide to switch channels while already beaconing, e.g.
in response to a cfg80211 connect request on a different vif. Add this
event to notify userspace when an AP or GO interface has successfully
migrated to a new channel, so it can update its configuration
accordingly.
