openrisc: use scratch regs in atomic syscall

The function sys_or1k_atomic was using call-saved registers without
restoring their value before returning.  This is a faux pas: either
we need to restore their values or use scratch regs; the latter is
less code so that's the route this patch takes.

Thanks to David Hennerström for doing most of the heavy-lifting in
tracking this one down.
