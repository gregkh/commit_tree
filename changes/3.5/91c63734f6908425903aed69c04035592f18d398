kernel: cgroup: push rcu read locking from css_is_ancestor() to callsite

Library functions should not grab locks when the callsites can do it,
even if the lock nests like the rcu read-side lock does.

Push the rcu_read_lock() from css_is_ancestor() to its single user,
mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree() in preparation for another user that may
already hold the rcu read-side lock.
