um: fix possible race on task->mm

Checking for task->mm is dangerous as ->mm might disappear (exit_mm()
assigns NULL under task_lock(), so tasklist lock is not enough).

We can't use get_task_mm()/mmput() pair as mmput() might sleep, so let's
take the task lock while we care about its mm.

Note that we should also use find_lock_task_mm() to check all process'
threads for a valid mm, but for uml we'll do it in a separate patch.
