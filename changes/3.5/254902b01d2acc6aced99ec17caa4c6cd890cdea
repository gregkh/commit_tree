[media] gspca: Fix locking issues related to suspend/resume

There are two bugs here: first the calls to stop0 (in gspca_suspend) and
gspca_init_transfer (in gspca_resume) need to be called with the usb_lock held.
That's true for the other places they are called and it is what subdrivers
expect. Quite a few will unlock the usb_lock in stop0 while waiting for a
worker thread to finish, and if usb_lock isn't held then that can cause a
kernel oops.

The other problem is that a worker thread needs to detect that it has to
halt due to a suspend. Otherwise it will just go on looping. So add tests
against gspca_dev->frozen in the worker threads that need it.

Hdg, 2 minor changes:
1) The finepix device is ok with stopping reading a frame halfway through,
   so add frozen checks in all places where we also check if we're still
   streaming
2) Use gspca_dev->dev instead of gspca_dev->present to check for disconnect
   in all touched drivers. I plan to do this everywhere in the future, and
   most relevant lines in the touched drivers are already modified by this
   patch.
