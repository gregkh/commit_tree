ARM: ux500: New DT:ed snowball_platform_devs for one-by-one device enablement

During Device Tree enablement it is necessary to remove snowball_<device>*
platform_data segments one at at time, as and when particular devices are
DT enabled. This patch provides a temporary solution. Once this new struct
is empty it will be removed again.
