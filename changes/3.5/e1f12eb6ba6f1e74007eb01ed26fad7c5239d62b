USB: Disable hub-initiated LPM for comms devices.

Hub-initiated LPM is not good for USB communications devices.  Comms
devices should be able to tell when their link can go into a lower power
state, because they know when an incoming transmission is finished.
Ideally, these devices would slam their links into a lower power state,
using the device-initiated LPM, after finishing the last packet of their
data transfer.

If we enable the idle timeouts for the parent hubs to enable
hub-initiated LPM, we will get a lot of useless LPM packets on the bus
as the devices reject LPM transitions when they're in the middle of
receiving data.  Worse, some devices might blindly accept the
hub-initiated LPM and power down their radios while they're in the
middle of receiving a transmission.

The Intel Windows folks are disabling hub-initiated LPM for all USB
communications devices under a xHCI USB 3.0 host.  In order to keep
the Linux behavior as close as possible to Windows, we need to do the
same in Linux.

Set the disable_hub_initiated_lpm flag for for all USB communications
drivers.  I know there aren't currently any USB 3.0 devices that
implement these class specifications, but we should be ready if they do.
