OMAPDSS: HDMI: define and dump CORE registers in correct order

The HDMI core register offset macros aren't defined in ascending order of their
values, some of the offset macros are also redefined. The same issues occur when
these core registers are dumped.

Clean up the ordering of HDMI core registers and remove repeated registers in
the definition in ti_hdmi_4xxx_ip.h and in ti_hdmi_4xxx_core_dump().
