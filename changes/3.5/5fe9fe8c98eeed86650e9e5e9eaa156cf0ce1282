    drm/i915: Actually set the reset bit in i965_reset

a little confusion about when wait_for times out has been introduced -
wait for loops _until_ the condition is true.

This fixes gpu reset on my gm45, testing with my hangman code shows
that it's now fairly reliable - it only died after well over 100 reset
