blkcg: move blkio_group_conf->weight to cfq

blkio_group_conf->weight is owned by cfq and has no reason to be
defined in blkcg core.  Replace it with cfq_group->dev_weight and let
conf setting functions directly set it.  If dev_weight is zero, the
cfqg doesn't have device specific weight configured.

Also, rename BLKIO_WEIGHT_* constants to CFQ_WEIGHT_* and rename
blkio_cgroup->weight to blkio_cgroup->cfq_weight.  We eventually want
per-policy storage in blkio_cgroup but just mark the ownership of the
field for now.
