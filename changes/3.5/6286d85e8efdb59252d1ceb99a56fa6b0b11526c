USB: cdc-wdm: remove from device list on disconnect

Prevents dereferencing an invalid struct usb_interface
pointer.

Always delete entry from device list whether or not the
rest of the device state cleanup is postponed. The device
list uses desc->intf as key, and wdm_open will dereference
this key while searching for a matching device.  A device
should not appear in the list unless probe() has succeeded
and disconnect() has not finished.
