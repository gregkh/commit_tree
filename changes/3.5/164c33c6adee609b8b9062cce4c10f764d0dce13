sched: Fix fork() error path to not crash

In dup_task_struct(), if arch_dup_task_struct() fails, the clean up
code fails to clean up correctly.  That's because the clean up
code depends on unininitalized ti->task pointer.  We fix this
by making sure that the task and thread_info know about each other
before we attempt to take the error path.
