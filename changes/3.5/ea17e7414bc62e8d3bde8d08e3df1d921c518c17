x86, relocs: Add jiffies and jiffies_64 to the relative whitelist

The symbol jiffies is created in the linker script as an alias to
jiffies_64.  Unfortunately this is done outside any section, and
apparently GNU ld 2.21 doesn't carry the section with it, so we end up
with an absolute symbol and therefore a broken kernel.

Add jiffies and jiffies_64 to the whitelist.

The most disturbing bit with this discovery is that it shows that we
have had multiple linker bugs in this area crossing multiple
generations, and have been silently building bad kernels for some time.
