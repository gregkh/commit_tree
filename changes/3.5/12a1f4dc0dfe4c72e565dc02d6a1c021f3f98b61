usb:hsotg:samsung: Cable disconnection recovery code

This code allows Samsung SoC's to recover its state when
device is disconnected and connected during transfer.

It is necessary, in such a scenario, to reinitialize the USB core
to assure correct initial state of the driver.
This operation is needed since the disconnect interrupt is only
available at HOST mode, which is not supported by this driver.

A simple mechanism with jiffies has been used to perform core reset
only once.

Tested with:
- DFU gadget (various size of the sent data - also packet = MPS)
- Ethernet gadget (CDC and RNDIS)
- Multi Function Gadget (g_multi)

HW:
- Samsung's C210 Universal rev.0
