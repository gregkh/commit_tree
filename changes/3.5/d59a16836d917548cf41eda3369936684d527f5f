scripts/sortextable: Handle relative entries, and other cleanups

x86 is now using relative rather than absolute addresses in its
exception table, so we add a sorter for these.  If there are
relocations on the __ex_table section, they are redundant and probably
incorrect after the sort, so they are zeroed out leaving them valid
and consistent.

Also use the unaligned safe accessors from tools/{be,le}_byteshift.h
