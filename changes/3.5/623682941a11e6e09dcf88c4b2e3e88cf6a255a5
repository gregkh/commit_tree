ASoC: core: Allow DAIs to specify a base address

Devices with many DAIs are becoming more and more common, and generally
the more modern devices have consistent register layouts between DAIs.
Rather than have drivers open code lookups based on the DAI ID or cause
uglification in UI by having register addresses for IDs provide a base
address field they can use.
