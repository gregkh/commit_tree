mac80211: Support on-channel scan option.

This based on an idea posted by Stanislaw Gruszka,
though I accept full blame for the implementation!

This has been tested with ath9k.

The idea is to let users scan on the current operating
channel without interrupting normal traffic more than
absolutely necessary (changing power level might reset
some hardware, for instance).
