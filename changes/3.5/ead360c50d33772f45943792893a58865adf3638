xfs: fix incorrect b_offset initialisation

Because we no longer use the page cache for buffering, there is no
direct block number to page offset relationship anymore.
xfs_buf_get_pages is still setting up b_offset as if there was some
relationship, and that is leading to incorrectly setting up
*uncached* buffers that don't overwrite b_offset once they've had
pages allocated.

For cached buffers, the first block of the buffer is always at offset
zero into the allocated memory. This is true for sub-page sized
buffers, as well as for multiple-page buffers.

For uncached buffers, b_offset is only non-zero when we are
associating specific memory to the buffers, and that is set
correctly by the code setting up the buffer.

Hence remove the setting of b_offset in xfs_buf_get_pages, because
it is now always the wrong thing to do.
