userns: Add an explicit reference to the parent user namespace

I am about to remove the struct user_namespace reference from struct user_struct.
So keep an explicit track of the parent user namespace.

Take advantage of this new reference and replace instances of user_ns->creator->user_ns
with user_ns->parent.
