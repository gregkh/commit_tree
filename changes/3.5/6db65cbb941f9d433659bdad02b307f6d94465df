drm/i915: Fix eDP blank screen after S3 resume on HP desktops

This patch fixes the problem on some HP desktop machines with eDP
which give blank screens after S3 resume.

It turned out that BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL must be written after
BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL2.  Otherwise it doesn't take effect on these
SNB machines.

Tested with 3.5-rc3 kernel.
