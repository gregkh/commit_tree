memcg: fix use_hierarchy css_is_ancestor oops regression

If use_hierarchy is set, reclaim testing soon oopses in css_is_ancestor()
called from __mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree() called from page_referenced():
when processes are exiting, it's easy for mm_match_cgroup() to pass along
a NULL memcg coming from a NULL mm->owner.

Check for that in __mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree().  Return true or false?
False because we cannot know if it was in the hierarchy, but also false
because it's better not to count a reference from an exiting process.
