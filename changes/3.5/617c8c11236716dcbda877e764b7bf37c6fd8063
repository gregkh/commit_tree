skb: avoid unnecessary reallocations in __skb_cow

At the beginning of __skb_cow, headroom gets set to a minimum of
NET_SKB_PAD. This causes unnecessary reallocations if the buffer was not
cloned and the headroom is just below NET_SKB_PAD, but still more than the
amount requested by the caller.
This was showing up frequently in my tests on VLAN tx, where
vlan_insert_tag calls skb_cow_head(skb, VLAN_HLEN).

Locally generated packets should have enough headroom, and for forward
paths, we already have NET_SKB_PAD bytes of headroom, so we don't need to
add any extra space here.
