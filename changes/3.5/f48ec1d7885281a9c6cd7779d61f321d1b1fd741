cfq: fix build breakage & warnings

* CFQ_WEIGHT_* defined inside CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP causes cfq-iosched.c
  compile failure when the config is disabled.  Move it outside the
  ifdef block.

* Dummy cfqg_stats_*() definitions were lacking inline modifiers
  causing unused functions warning if !CONFIG_CFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED.  Add
  them.
