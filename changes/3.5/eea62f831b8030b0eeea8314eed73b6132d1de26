brlocks/lglocks: turn into functions

lglocks and brlocks are currently generated with some complicated macros
in lglock.h.  But there's no reason to not just use common utility
functions and put all the data into a common data structure.

Since there are at least two users it makes sense to share this code in a
library.  This is also easier maintainable than a macro forest.

This will also make it later possible to dynamically allocate lglocks and
also use them in modules (this would both still need some additional, but
now straightforward, code)
