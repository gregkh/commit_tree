xfs: push the ilock into xfs_zero_eof

Instead of calling xfs_zero_eof with the ilock held only take it internally
for the minimall required critical section around xfs_bmapi_read.  This
also requires changing the calling convention for xfs_zero_last_block
slightly.  The actual zeroing operation is still serialized by the iolock,
which must be taken exclusively over the call to xfs_zero_eof.

We could in fact use a shared lock for the xfs_bmapi_read calls as long as
the extent list has been read in, but given that we already hold the iolock
exclusively there is little reason to micro optimize this further.
