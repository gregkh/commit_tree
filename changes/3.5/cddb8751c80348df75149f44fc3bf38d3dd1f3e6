staging: android: persistent_ram: Move to fs/pstore/ram_core.c

This is a first step for adding ECC support for pstore RAM backend: we
will use the persistent_ram routines, kindly provided by Google.

Basically, persistent_ram is a set of helper routines to deal with the
[optionally] ECC-protected persistent ram regions.

A bit of Makefile, Kconfig and header files adjustments were needed
because of the move.
