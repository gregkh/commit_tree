ipc/mqueue: correct mq_attr_ok test

While working on the other parts of the mqueue stuff, I noticed that the
calculation for overflow in mq_attr_ok didn't actually match reality (this
is especially true since my last patch which changed how we account memory
slightly).

In particular, we used to test for overflow using:
  msgs * msgsize + msgs * sizeof(struct msg_msg *)

That was never really correct because each message we allocate via
load_msg() is actually a struct msg_msg followed by the data for the
message (and if struct msg_msg + data exceeds PAGE_SIZE we end up
allocating struct msg_msgseg structs too, but accounting for them would
get really tedious, so let's ignore those...they're only a pointer in size
anyway).  This patch updates the calculation to be more accurate in
regards to maximum possible memory consumption by the mqueue.
