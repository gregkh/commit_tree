mm/vmscan: store "priority" in struct scan_control

In memory reclaim some function have too many arguments - "priority" is
one of them.  It can be stored in struct scan_control - we construct them
on the same level.  Instead of an open coded loop we set the initial
sc.priority, and do_try_to_free_pages() decreases it down to zero.
