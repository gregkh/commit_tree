PM / Sleep: Use wait queue to signal "no wakeup events in progress"

The current wakeup source deactivation code doesn't do anything when
the counter of wakeup events in progress goes down to zero, which
requires pm_get_wakeup_count() to poll that counter periodically.
Although this reduces the average time it takes to deactivate a
wakeup source, it also may lead to a substantial amount of unnecessary
polling if there are extended periods of wakeup activity.  Thus it
seems reasonable to use a wait queue for signaling the "no wakeup
events in progress" condition and remove the polling.
