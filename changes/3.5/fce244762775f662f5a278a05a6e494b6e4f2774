C6X: add support to build with BINFMT_ELF_FDPIC

C6x userspace supports a shared library mechanism called DSBT for systems with
no MMU. DSBT is similar to FDPIC in allowing shared text segments and private
copies of data segments without an MMU. Both methods access data using a base
register and offset. With FDPIC, the caller of an external function sets up the
base register for the callee. With DSBT, the called function sets up its own
base register. Other details differ but both userspaces need the same thing
from the kernel loader: a map of where each ELF segment was loaded. The FDPIC
loader already provides this, so DSBT just uses it.

This patch enables BINFMT_ELF_FDPIC by default for C6X and provides the
necessary architecture hooks for the generic loader.
