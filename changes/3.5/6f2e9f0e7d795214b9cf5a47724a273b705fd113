ext4: protect group inode free counting with group lock

Now when we set the group inode free count, we don't have a proper
group lock so that multiple threads may decrease the inode free
count at the same time. And e2fsck will complain something like:

Free inodes count wrong for group #1 (1, counted=0).
Fix? no

Free inodes count wrong for group #2 (3, counted=0).
Fix? no

Directories count wrong for group #2 (780, counted=779).
Fix? no

Free inodes count wrong for group #3 (2272, counted=2273).
Fix? no

So this patch try to protect it with the ext4_lock_group.

btw, it is found by xfstests test case 269 and the volume is
mkfsed with the parameter
"-O ^resize_inode,^uninit_bg,extent,meta_bg,flex_bg,ext_attr"
and I have run it 100 times and the error in e2fsck doesn't
show up again.
