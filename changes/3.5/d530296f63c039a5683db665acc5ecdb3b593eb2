USB: serial: opticon: hook up suspend/resume callbacks

With a previous patch, the usb_driver suspend/resume callbacks got
overridden and were never called if a usb_serial driver defined them.
This patch fixes the opticon driver to move the suspend/resume callbacks
into the usb_serial_driver structure where they will be properly called.

It then removes the unused usb_driver structure.
