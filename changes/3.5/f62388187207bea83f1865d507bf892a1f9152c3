mm: fix off-by-one bug in print_nodes_state()

/sys/devices/system/node/{online,possible} outputs a garbage byte
because print_nodes_state() returns content size + 1.  To fix the bug,
the patch changes the use of cpuset_sprintf_cpulist to follow the use at
other places, which is clearer and safer.

This bug was introduced in v2.6.24 (commit bde631a51876: "mm: add node
states sysfs class attributeS").
