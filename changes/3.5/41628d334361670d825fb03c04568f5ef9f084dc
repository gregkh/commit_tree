KVM: s390: Implement the directed yield (diag 9c) hypervisor call for KVM

This patch implements the directed yield hypercall found on other
System z hypervisors. It delegates execution time to the virtual cpu
specified in the instruction's parameter.

Useful to avoid long spinlock waits in the guest.
