nfsd4: exchange_id: check creds before killing confirmed client

We mustn't allow a client to destroy another client with established
state unless it has the right credential.

And some minor cleanup.

(Note: our comparison of credentials is actually pretty bogus currently;
that will need to be fixed in another patch.)
