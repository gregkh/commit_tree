ASoC: twl6040: Remove HS/HF gain ramp feature

None of the machines uses the gain ramp possibility for HS/HF.
This code path is mostly unused and it does not reduces the pop
noise on the output (it alters it to sound a bit different).
The preferred method to reduce pop noise is to use ABE.
Remove the gain ramp, and related features form the driver.
