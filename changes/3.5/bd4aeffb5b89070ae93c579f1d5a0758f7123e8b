NFSv4.1 skip rpc_call_done only on disconnected DS slot_table_waitq tasks

We reset all I/O on a disconnected data server through the pgio layer indicated
by the NFS_IOHDR_REDO flag.

Differentiate between on-the-wire tasks returning with an error which must
call rpc_call_done and tasks woken from the data server slot_table_waitq
waiting for a session slot with a status of zero which call rpc_exit in
rpc_prepare and need to skip rpc_call_done.
