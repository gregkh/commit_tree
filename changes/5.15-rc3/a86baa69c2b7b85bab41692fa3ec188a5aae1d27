rcu: Remove special bit at the bottom of the ->dynticks counter

Commit b8c17e6664c4 ("rcu: Maintain special bits at bottom of ->dynticks
counter") reserved a bit at the bottom of the ->dynticks counter to defer
flushing of TLBs, but this facility never has been used.  This commit
therefore removes this capability along with the rcu_eqs_special_set()
function used to trigger it.
