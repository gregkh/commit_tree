dm ima: measure data on device rename

A given block device is identified by it's name and UUID.  However, both
these parameters can be renamed.  For an external attestation service to
correctly attest a given device, it needs to keep track of these rename
events.

Update the device data with the new values for IMA measurements.  Measure
both old and new device name/UUID parameters in the same IMA measurement
event, so that the old and the new values can be connected later.
