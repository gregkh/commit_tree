crypto: tcrypt - add the asynchronous speed test for SM4

tcrypt supports testing of SM4 cipher algorithms that use avx
instruction set acceleration. The implementation of sm4 instruction
set acceleration supports up to 8 blocks in parallel encryption and
decryption, which is 128 bytes. Therefore, the 128-byte block size
is also added to block_sizes.
