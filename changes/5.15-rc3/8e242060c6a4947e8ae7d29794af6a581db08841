tracing/probes: Reject events which have the same name of existing one

Since kprobe_events and uprobe_events only check whether the
other same-type probe event has the same name or not, if the
user gives the same name of the existing tracepoint event (or
the other type of probe events), it silently fails to create
the tracefs entry (but registered.) as below.

/sys/kernel/tracing # ls events/task/task_rename
enable   filter   format   hist     id       trigger
/sys/kernel/tracing # echo p:task/task_rename vfs_read >> kprobe_events
[  113.048508] Could not create tracefs 'task_rename' directory
/sys/kernel/tracing # cat kprobe_events
p:task/task_rename vfs_read

To fix this issue, check whether the existing events have the
same name or not in trace_probe_register_event_call(). If exists,
it rejects to register the new event.
