mmc: sdhci-msm: Use maximum possible data timeout value

The Qcom SD controller defines the usage of 0xF in data
timeout counter register (0x2E) which is actually a reserved
bit as per specification. This would result in maximum of 21.26 secs
timeout value.

Some SDcard taking more time than 2.67secs (timeout value corresponding
to 0xE) and with that observed data timeout errors.
So increasing the timeout value to max possible timeout.
