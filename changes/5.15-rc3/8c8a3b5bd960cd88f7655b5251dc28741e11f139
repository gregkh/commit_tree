arm64: add MTE supported check to thread switching and syscall entry/exit

This lets us avoid doing unnecessary work on hardware that does not
support MTE, and will allow us to freely use MTE instructions in the
code called by mte_thread_switch().

Since this would mean that we do a redundant check in
mte_check_tfsr_el1(), remove it and add two checks now required in its
callers. This also avoids an unnecessary DSB+ISB sequence on the syscall
exit path for hardware not supporting MTE.
