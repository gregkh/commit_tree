drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Group code in sections

Reorganize the functions in sections, related to connector operations,
bridge operations, AUX adapter, GPIO controller and probe & remove.

This prepares for proper support of DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR that
will add more functions, to ensure that the code will stay readable.

No functional change intended.
