mctp: remove duplicated assignment of pointer hdr

The pointer hdr is being initialized and also re-assigned with the
same value from the call to function mctp_hdr. Static analysis reports
that the initializated value is unused. The second assignment is
duplicated and can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value").
