nvmem: core: Add stubs for nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u32/64 if !CONFIG_NVMEM

When I added nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u32() and
nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u64() I forgot to add the "static inline"
stub functions for when CONFIG_NVMEM wasn't defined. Add them
now. This was causing problems with randconfig builds that compiled
`drivers/soc/qcom/cpr.c`.

Fixes: 6feba6a62c57 ("PM: AVS: qcom-cpr: Use nvmem_cell_read_variable_le_u32()")
Fixes: a28e824fb827 ("nvmem: core: Add functions to make number reading easy")
