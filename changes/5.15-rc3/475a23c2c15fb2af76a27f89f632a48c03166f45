tools: bpftool: Complete metrics list in "bpftool prog profile" doc

Profiling programs with bpftool was extended some time ago to support
two new metrics, namely itlb_misses and dtlb_misses (misses for the
instruction/data translation lookaside buffer). Update the manual page
and bash completion accordingly.
