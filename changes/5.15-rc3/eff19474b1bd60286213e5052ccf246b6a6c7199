iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use command queue batching helpers to improve performance

The obvious key to the performance optimization of commit 587e6c10a7ce
("iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Reduce contention during command-queue insertion") is
to allow multiple cores to insert commands in parallel after a brief mutex
contention.

Obviously, inserting as many commands at a time as possible can reduce the
number of times the mutex contention participates, thereby improving the
overall performance. At least it reduces the number of calls to function
arm_smmu_cmdq_issue_cmdlist().

Therefore, use command queue batching helpers to insert multiple commands
at a time.
