mctp: Add device handling and netlink interface

This change adds the infrastructure for managing MCTP netdevices; we add
a pointer to the AF_MCTP-specific data to struct netdevice, and hook up
the rtnetlink operations for adding and removing addresses.

Includes changes from Matt Johnston <matt@codeconstruct.com.au>.
