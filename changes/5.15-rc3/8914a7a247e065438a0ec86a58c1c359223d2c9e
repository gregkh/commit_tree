selftests: be sure to make khdr before other targets

LKP/0Day reported some building errors about kvm, and errors message
are not always same:
- lib/x86_64/processor.c:1083:31: error: ‘KVM_CAP_NESTED_STATE’ undeclared
(first use in this function); did you mean ‘KVM_CAP_PIT_STATE2’?
- lib/test_util.c:189:30: error: ‘MAP_HUGE_16KB’ undeclared (first use
in this function); did you mean ‘MAP_HUGE_16GB’?

Although kvm relies on the khdr, they still be built in parallel when -j
is specified. In this case, it will cause compiling errors.

Here we mark target khdr as NOTPARALLEL to make it be always built
first.
