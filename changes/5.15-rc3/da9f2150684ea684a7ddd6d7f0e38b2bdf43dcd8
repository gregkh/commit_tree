PCI: PM: Avoid forcing PCI_D0 for wakeup reasons inconsistently

It is inconsistent to return PCI_D0 from pci_target_state() instead
of the original target state if 'wakeup' is true and the device
cannot signal PME from D0.

This only happens when the device cannot signal PME from the original
target state and any shallower power states (including D0) and that
case is effectively equivalent to the one in which PME singaling is
not supported at all.  Since the original target state is returned in
the latter case, make the function do that in the former one too.
