x86/resctrl: Swizzle rdt_resource and resctrl_schema in pseudo_lock_region

struct pseudo_lock_region points to the rdt_resource.

Once the resources are merged, this won't be unique. The resource name
is moving into the schema, so that the filesystem portions of resctrl can
generate it.

Swap pseudo_lock_region's rdt_resource pointer for a schema pointer.
