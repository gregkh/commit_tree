arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for SONY Xperia X Performance / XZ / XZs (msm8996, Tone platform)

Add support for following boards:

- Xperia X Performance (dora)
- Xperia XZ (kagura)
- Xperia XZs (keyaki)

They are all based on the SONY Tone platform and feature largely similar hardware
with the most obvious differences being lack of USB-C and ToF sensor on Dora and
different camera sensor on Keyaki.
