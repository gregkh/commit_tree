scsi: lpfc: Fix CPU to/from endian warnings introduced by ELS processing

The kernel test robot reported the following sparse warning:
".../lpfc_els.c:3984:25: sparse: sparse: cast from restricted __be16"

For the error being flagged, using be32_to_cpu() on a be16 data type, it
was simple enough. But a review of other elements and warnings were also
evaluated.

This patch corrected several items in the original patch:

 - Using be32_to_cpu() on a be16 data type

 - cpu_to_le32() used on a std uint32_t (CPU) data type.

   Note: This is a byte array, but stored in LE layout by hardware at
   32-bit boundaries. So it possibly needed conversion.

 - Using cpu_to_le32() on a std uint16_t and assigned to a char typeA

 - Using le32_to_cpu() on a le16 type

 - Missing cpu_to_le16() on an assignment
