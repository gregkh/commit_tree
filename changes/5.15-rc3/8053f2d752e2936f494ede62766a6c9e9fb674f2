perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add alias PMU name

A perf PMU may have two PMU names. For example, Intel Sapphire Rapids
server supports the discovery mechanism. Without the platform-specific
support, an uncore PMU is named by a type ID plus a box ID, e.g.,
uncore_type_0_0, because the real name of the uncore PMU cannot be
retrieved from the discovery table. With the platform-specific support
later, perf has the mapping information from a type ID to a specific
uncore unit. Just like the previous platforms, the uncore PMU is named
by the real PMU name, e.g., uncore_cha_0. The user scripts which work
well with the old numeric name may not work anymore.

Add a new attribute "alias" to indicate the old numeric name. The
following userspace perf tool patch will handle both names. The user
scripts should work properly with the updated perf tool.
