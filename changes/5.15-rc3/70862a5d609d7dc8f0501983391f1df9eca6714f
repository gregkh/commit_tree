net/mlx5: Support enable_vnet devlink dev param

Enable user to disable VDPA net auxiliary device so that when it is not
required, user can disable it.

For example,

$ devlink dev param set pci/0000:06:00.0 \
              name enable_vnet value false cmode driverinit
$ devlink dev reload pci/0000:06:00.0

At this point devlink instance do not create auxiliary device
mlx5_core.vnet.2 for the VDPA net functionality.
