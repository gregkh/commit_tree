habanalabs/gaudi: use direct MSI in single mode

Due to FLR scenario when running inside a VM, we must not use indirect
MSI because it might cause some issues on VM destroy.
In a VM we use single MSI mode in contrary to multi MSI mode which is
used in bare-metal.
Hence direct MSI should be used in single MSI mode only.
