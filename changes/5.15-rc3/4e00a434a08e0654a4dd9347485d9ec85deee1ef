drm/amd/display: Fix unstable HPCP compliance on Chrome Barcelo

[Why]
Intermittently, there presents two occurrences of 0 stream
commits in a single HPD event. Current HDCP sequence does
not consider such scenerio, and will thus disable HDCP.

[How]
Add condition check to include stream remove and re-enable
case for HDCP enable.
