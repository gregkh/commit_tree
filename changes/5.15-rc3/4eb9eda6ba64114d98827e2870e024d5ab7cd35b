net/af_iucv: clean up a try_then_request_module()

Use IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IUCV) to determine whether the iucv_if symbol
is available, and let depmod deal with the module dependency.

This was introduced back with commit 6fcd61f7bf5d ("af_iucv: use
loadable iucv interface"). And to avoid sprinkling IS_ENABLED() over
all the code, we're keeping the indirection through pr_iucv->...().
