staging: rtl8188eu: remove rtw_wx_set_rate handler function

Remove rtw_wx_set_rate handler function, which currently handles the
SIOCSIWRATE wext ioctl. This function (although containing a lot of
code) set nothing outside its own local variables, and did nothing other
than call a now removed debugging statement repeatedly. Removing it and
leaving its associated entry in rtw_handlers as NULL is therefore the
better option. Removing this function also fixes a kernel test robot
warning.
