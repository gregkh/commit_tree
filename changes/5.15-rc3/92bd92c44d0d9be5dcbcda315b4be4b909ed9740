drm/dp_mst: Fix return code on sideband message failure

Commit 2f015ec6eab6 ("drm/dp_mst: Add sideband down request tracing +
selftests") added some debug code for sideband message tracing. But
it seems to have unintentionally changed the behavior on sideband message
failure. It catches and returns failure only if DRM_UT_DP is enabled.
Otherwise it ignores the error code and returns success. So on an MST
unplug, the caller is unaware that the clear payload message failed and
ends up waiting for 4 seconds for the response. Fixes the issue by
returning the proper error code.
