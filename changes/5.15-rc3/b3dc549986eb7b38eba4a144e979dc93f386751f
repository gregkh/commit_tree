drm/amdgpu: Disable PCIE_DPM on Intel RKL Platform

Due to high latency in PCIE clock switching on RKL platforms,
switching the PCIE clock dynamically at runtime can lead to HDMI/DP
audio problems. On newer asics this is handled in the SMU firmware.
For SMU7-based asics, disable PCIE clock switching to avoid the issue.

AMD provide a parameter to disable PICE_DPM.

modprobe amdgpu ppfeaturemask=0xfff7bffb

It's better to contorl PCIE_DPM in amd gpu driver,
switch PCI_DPM by determining intel RKL platform for SMU7-based asics.
