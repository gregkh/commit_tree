KVM: arm64: Move kern_hyp_va() usage in __load_guest_stage2() into the callers

It is a bit awkward to use kern_hyp_va() in __load_guest_stage2(),
specially as the helper is shared between VHE and nVHE.

Instead, move the use of kern_hyp_va() in the nVHE code, and
pass a pointer to the kvm->arch structure instead. Although
this may look a bit awkward, it allows for some further simplification.
