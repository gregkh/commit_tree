locking/spinlock: Split the lock types header, and move the raw types into <linux/spinlock_types_raw.h>

Move raw_spinlock into its own file. Prepare for RT 'sleeping spinlocks', to
avoid header recursion, as RT locks require rtmutex.h, which in turn requires
the raw spinlock types.

No functional change.
