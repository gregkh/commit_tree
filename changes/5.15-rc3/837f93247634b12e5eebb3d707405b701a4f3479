drm/i915/dpcd_bl: Print return codes for VESA backlight failures

Also, stop printing the DPCD register that failed, and just describe it
instead. Saves us from having to look up each register offset when reading
through kernel logs (plus, DPCD dumping with drm.debug |= 0x100 will give
us that anyway).
