rcu: Do not disable GP stall detection in rcu_cpu_stall_reset()

rcu_cpu_stall_reset() is one of the functions virtual CPUs
execute during VM resume in order to handle jiffies skew
that can trigger false positive stall warnings. Paul has
pointed out that this approach is problematic because
rcu_cpu_stall_reset() disables RCU grace period stall-detection
virtually forever, while in fact it can just restart the
stall-detection timeout.
