drm/vkms: Map output framebuffer BOs with drm_gem_fb_vmap()

Abstract the framebuffer details by mappings its BOs with a call
to drm_gem_fb_vmap(). Unmap with drm_gem_fb_vunamp().

Before, the output address with stored as raw pointer in the priv
field of struct drm_writeback_job. Introduce the new type
struct vkms_writeback_job, which holds the output mappings addresses
while the writeback job is active.

The patchset also cleans up some internal casting an setup of the
output addresses. No functional changes.

v3:
	* free instances of struct vkms_writeback_job on cleanup
	  or errors
