libbpf: Rename btf__get_from_id() as btf__load_from_kernel_by_id()

Rename function btf__get_from_id() as btf__load_from_kernel_by_id() to
better indicate what the function does. Change the new function so that,
instead of requiring a pointer to the pointer to update and returning
with an error code, it takes a single argument (the id of the BTF
object) and returns the corresponding pointer. This is more in line with
the existing constructors.

The other tools calling the (soon-to-be) deprecated btf__get_from_id()
function will be updated in a future commit.
