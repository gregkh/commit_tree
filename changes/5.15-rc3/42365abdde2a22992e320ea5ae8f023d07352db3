sparc64: Add compile-time asserts for siginfo_t offsets

To help catch ABI breaks at compile-time, add compile-time assertions to
verify the siginfo_t layout. Unlike other architectures, sparc64 is
special, because it is one of few architectures requiring si_trapno.
ABI breaks around that field would only be caught here.
