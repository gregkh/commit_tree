block: hold ->invalidate_lock in blkdev_fallocate

When running ->fallocate(), blkdev_fallocate() should hold
mapping->invalidate_lock to prevent page cache from being accessed,
otherwise stale data may be read in page cache.

Without this patch, blktests block/009 fails sometimes. With this patch,
block/009 can pass always.

Also as Jan pointed out, no pages can be created in the discarded area
while you are holding the invalidate_lock, so remove the 2nd
truncate_bdev_range().
