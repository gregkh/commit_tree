PCI: j721e: Add PCIe support for J7200

J7200 has the same PCIe IP as in J721E with minor changes in the
wrapper. J7200 allows byte access of bridge configuration space
registers and the register field for LINK_DOWN interrupt is different.
J7200 also requires "quirk_detect_quiet_flag" to be set. Configure these
changes as part of driver data applicable only to J7200.
