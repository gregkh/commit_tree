s390/pci: Do not mask MSI[-X] entries on teardown

The PCI core already ensures that the MSI[-X] state is correct when MSI[-X]
is disabled. For MSI the reset state is all entries unmasked and for MSI-X
all vectors are masked.

S390 masks all MSI entries and masks the already masked MSI-X entries
again. Remove it and let the device in the correct state.
