net: stmmac: allow CSR clock of 300MHz

The Synopsys Ethernet IP uses the CSR clock as a base clock for MDC.
The divisor used is set in the MAC_MDIO_Address register field CR
(Clock Rate)

The divisor is there to change the CSR clock into a clock that falls
below the IEEE 802.3 specified max frequency of 2.5MHz.

If the CSR clock is 300MHz, the code falls back to using the reset
value in the MAC_MDIO_Address register, as described in the comment
above this code.

However, 300MHz is actually an allowed value and the proper divider
can be estimated quite easily (it's just 1Hz difference!)

A CSR frequency of 300MHz with the maximum clock rate value of 0x5
(STMMAC_CSR_250_300M, a divisor of 124) gives somewhere around
~2.42MHz which is below the IEEE 802.3 specified maximum.

For the ARTPEC-8 SoC, the CSR clock is this problematic 300MHz,
and unfortunately, the reset-value of the MAC_MDIO_Address CR field
is 0x0.

This leads to a clock rate of zero and a divisor of 42, and gives an
MDC frequency of ~7.14MHz.

Allow CSR clock of 300MHz by making the comparison inclusive.
