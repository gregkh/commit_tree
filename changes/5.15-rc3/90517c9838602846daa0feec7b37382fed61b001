drm/amd/display: dsc mst 2 4K displays go dark with 2 lane HBR3

[Why]
call stack of amdgpu dsc mst pbn, slot num calculation is as below:
-compute_bpp_x16_from_target_bandwidth
-decide_dsc_target_bpp_x16
-setup_dsc_config
-dc_dsc_compute_bandwidth_range
-compute_mst_dsc_configs_for_link
-compute_mst_dsc_configs_for_state

from pbn -> dsc target bpp_x16

bpp_x16 is calulated by compute_bpp_x16_from_target_bandwidth.
Beside pixel clock and bpp, num_slices_h and bpp_increment_div
will also affect bpp_x16.

from dsc target bpp_x16 -> pbn

within dm_update_mst_vcpi_slots_for_dsc,
pbn = drm_dp_calc_pbn_mode(clock, bpp_x16, true);

drm_dp_calc_pbn_mode(int clock, int bpp, bool dsc)
{
  return DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL(mul_u32_u32(clock * (bpp / 16), 64 * 1006),
            8 * 54 * 1000 * 1000);
}

bpp / 16 trunc digits after decimal point. This will cause calculation
delta. drm_dp_calc_pbn_mode does not have other informations,
like num_slices_h, bpp_increment_div. therefore, it does not do revese
calcuation properly from bpp_x16 to pbn.

pbn from drm_dp_calc_pbn_mode is less than pbn from
compute_mst_dsc_configs_for_state. This cause not enough mst slot
allocated to display. display could not visually light up.

[How]
pass pbn from compute_mst_dsc_configs_for_state to
dm_update_mst_vcpi_slots_for_dsc
