perf tools: Add flag for tracking warnings of missing DSOs

Auxtrace support may need DSOs for decoding (for example Arm Coresight).
If one of these is missing it would make sense to warn once for each one
that's missing, but not flood the output with every address as there
could be thousands of lookups.

This flag will allow tracking whether a warning was shown for each DSO.
