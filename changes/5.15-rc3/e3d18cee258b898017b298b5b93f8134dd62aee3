locking/atomic: centralize generated headers

The generated atomic headers are only intended to be included directly
by <linux/atomic.h>, but are spread across include/linux/ and
include/asm-generic/, where people mnay be encouraged to include them.

This patch centralizes them under include/linux/atomic/.

Other than the header guards and hashes, there is no change to any of
the generated headers as a result of this patch.
