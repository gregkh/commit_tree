PM: domains: Fix domain attach for CONFIG_PM_OPP=n

If CONFIG_PM_OPP=n, of_get_required_opp_performance_state() always
returns -EOPNOTSUPP, and all drivers for devices that are part of a PM
Domain fail to probe with:

    failed to set required performance state for power-domain foo: -95
    probe of bar failed with error -95

Fix this by treating -EOPNOTSUPP the same as -ENODEV.

Fixes: c016baf7dc58e77a ("PM: domains: Add support for 'required-opps' to set default perf state")
