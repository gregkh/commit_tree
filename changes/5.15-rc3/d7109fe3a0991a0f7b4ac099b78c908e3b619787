x86/platform: Increase maximum GPIO number for X86_64

By default the 512 GPIOs is the maximum on any x86 platform.
With, for example, Intel Tiger Lake-H the SoC based controller
occupies up to 480 pins. This leaves only 32 available for
GPIO expanders or other drivers, like PMIC. Hence, bump the
maximum GPIO number to 1024 for X86_64 and leave 512 for X86_32.
