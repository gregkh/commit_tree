net: hso: fix muxed tty registration

If resource allocation and registration fail for a muxed tty device
(e.g. if there are no more minor numbers) the driver should not try to
deregister the never-registered (or already-deregistered) tty.

Fix up the error handling to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer when
attempting to remove the character device.
