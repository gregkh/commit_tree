scsi: lpfc: Remove REG_LOGIN check requirement to issue an ELS RDF

Since the REG_LOGIN to the fabric controller happens in parallel with SCR,
it may or may not be completed by the time RDF is sent.  RDF and SCR are
sent to the fabric in parallel, so checking for a completed REG_LOGIN in
the RDF submit path is not needed.

Remove the REG_LOGI check from the RDF submission path.
