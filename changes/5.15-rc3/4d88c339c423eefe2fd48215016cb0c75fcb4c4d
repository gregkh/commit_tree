atlantic: Fix issue in the pm resume flow.

After fixing hibernation resume flow, another usecase was found which
should be explicitly handled - resume when device is in "down" state.
Invoke aq_nic_init jointly with aq_nic_start only if ndev was already
up during suspend/hibernate. We still need to perform nic_deinit() if
caller requests for it, to handle the freeze/resume scenarios.
