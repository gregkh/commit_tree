drm/i915/display: check if compressed_llb was allocated

If we hit the error path here we unconditionally call
i915_gem_stolen_remove_node, even though we only allocate the
compressed_llb on older platforms. Therefore we should first check that
we actually allocated the node before trying to remove it.
