certs: Trigger creation of RSA module signing key if it's not an RSA key

Address a kbuild issue where a developer created an ECDSA key for signing
kernel modules and then builds an older version of the kernel, when bi-
secting the kernel for example, that does not support ECDSA keys.

If openssl is installed, trigger the creation of an RSA module signing
key if it is not an RSA key.
