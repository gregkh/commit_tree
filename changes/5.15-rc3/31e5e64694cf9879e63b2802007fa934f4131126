drivers: hv: Decouple Hyper-V clock/timer code from VMbus drivers

Hyper-V clock/timer code in hyperv_timer.c is mostly independent from
other VMbus drivers, but building for ARM64 without hyperv_timer.c
shows some remaining entanglements.  A default implementation of
hv_read_reference_counter can just read a Hyper-V synthetic register
and be independent of hyperv_timer.c, so move this code out and into
hv_common.c. Then it can be used by the timesync driver even if
hyperv_timer.c isn't built on a particular architecture.  If
hyperv_timer.c *is* built, it can override with a faster implementation.

Also provide stubs for stimer functions called by the VMbus driver when
hyperv_timer.c isn't built.

No functional changes.
