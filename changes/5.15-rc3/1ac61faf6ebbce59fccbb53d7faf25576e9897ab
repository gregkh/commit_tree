media: venus: helper: do not set constrained parameters for UBWC

Plane constraints firmware interface is to override the default
alignment for a given color format. By default venus hardware has
alignments as 128x32, but NV12 was defined differently to meet
various usecases. Compressed NV12 has always been aligned as 128x32,
hence not needed to override the default alignment.
