PCI: Introduce domain_nr in pci_host_bridge

Currently we retrieve the PCI domain number of the host bridge from the
bus sysdata (or pci_config_window if PCI_DOMAINS_GENERIC=y). Actually
we have the information at PCI host bridge probing time, and it makes
sense that we store it into pci_host_bridge. One benefit of doing so is
the requirement for supporting PCI on Hyper-V for ARM64, because the
host bridge of Hyper-V doesn't have pci_config_window, whereas ARM64 is
a PCI_DOMAINS_GENERIC=y arch, so we cannot retrieve the PCI domain
number from pci_config_window on ARM64 Hyper-V guest.

As the preparation for ARM64 Hyper-V PCI support, we introduce the
domain_nr in pci_host_bridge and a sentinel value to allow drivers to
set domain numbers properly at probing time. Currently
CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS_GENERIC=y archs are only users of this
newly-introduced field.
