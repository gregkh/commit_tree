writeback: use READ_ONCE for unlocked reads of writeback stats

We do some unlocked reads of writeback statistics like
avg_write_bandwidth, dirty_ratelimit, or bw_time_stamp.  Generally we are
fine with getting somewhat out-of-date values but actually getting
different values in various parts of the functions because the compiler
decided to reload value from original memory location could confuse
calculations.  Use READ_ONCE for these unlocked accesses and WRITE_ONCE
for the updates to be on the safe side.
