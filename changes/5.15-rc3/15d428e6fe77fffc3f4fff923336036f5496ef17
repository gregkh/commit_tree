cgroup/cpuset: Fix a partition bug with hotplug

In cpuset_hotplug_workfn(), the detection of whether the cpu list
has been changed is done by comparing the effective cpus of the top
cpuset with the cpu_active_mask. However, in the rare case that just
all the CPUs in the subparts_cpus are offlined, the detection fails
and the partition states are not updated correctly. Fix it by forcing
the cpus_updated flag to true in this particular case.
