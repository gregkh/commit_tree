platform/x86: amd-pmc: Increase the response register timeout

There have been reports of approximately a 0.9%-1.7% failure rate in SMU
communication timeouts with s0i3 entry on some OEM designs.  Currently
the design in amd-pmc is to try every 100us for up to 20ms.

However the GPU driver which also communicates with the SMU using a
mailbox register which the driver polls every 1us for up to 2000ms.
In the GPU driver this was increased by commit 055162645a40 ("drm/amd/pm:
increase time out value when sending msg to SMU")

Increase the maximum timeout used by amd-pmc to 2000ms to match this
behavior.  This has been shown to improve the stability for machines
that randomly have failures.
