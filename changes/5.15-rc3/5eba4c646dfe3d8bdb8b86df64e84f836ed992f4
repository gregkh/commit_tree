ALSA: cs5535audio: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch converts the resource management in PCI cs5535audio driver
with devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is
converted with the corresponding devres helper, and the card object
release is managed now via card->private_free instead of a lowlevel
snd_device.  A slight uncertain change is the call of
olpc_quirks_cleanup() at removal: formerly this was called
unconditionally at remove, but this should be a conditionally call,
hence the machine_is_olpc() check is added here as well.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
