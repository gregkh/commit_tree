net: hns3: refactor function hclge_parse_capability()

The function hclge_parse_capability() uses too many if statement, and
it may add more in the future. To improve code readability, maintainability
and simplicity, refactor this function by using a bit mapping array of IMP
capabilities and driver capabilities.
