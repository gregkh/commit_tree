video: fbdev: ssd1307fb: Simplify ssd1307fb_update_display()

Simplify the nested loops to handle conversion from linear frame buffer
to ssd1307 page layout:
  1. Move last page handling one level up, as the value of "m" is the
     same inside a page,
  2. array->data[] is filled linearly, so there is no need to
     recalculate array_idx over and over again; a simple increment is
     sufficient.
