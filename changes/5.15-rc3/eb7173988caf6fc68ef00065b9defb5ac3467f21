of: fdt: remove unnecessary codes

While unflattening the device tree, we try to populate dt nodes and
properties into tree-shaped data structure.

In populate_properties function, pprev is initially set to
&np->properties, and then updated to &pp->next.

In both scenarios *pprev is NULL, since the memory area that we are
allocating from is initially zeroed.

I tested the code as below, and it showed that BUG was never called.

-       if (!dryrun)
+       if (!dryrun) {
+               if (*pprev)
+                       BUG();
                *pprev = NULL;
+       }

Let's remove unnecessary code.
