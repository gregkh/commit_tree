arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: remove USB tx-fifo-resize property

tx-fifo-resize is now added by default by the dwc3-qcom driver
to the SNPS DWC3 child node.

So, lets drop the tx-fifo-resize property from dwc3-qcom nodes
as having it there will cause the dwc3-qcom driver to error and
abort probe with:
[    1.362938] dwc3-qcom 8af8800.usb: unable to add property
[    1.368405] dwc3-qcom 8af8800.usb: failed to register DWC3 Core, err=-17
