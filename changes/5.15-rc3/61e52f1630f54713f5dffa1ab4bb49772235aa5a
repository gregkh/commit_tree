KVM: selftests: Add a test for KVM_RUN+rseq to detect task migration bugs

Add a test to verify an rseq's CPU ID is updated correctly if the task is
migrated while the kernel is handling KVM_RUN.  This is a regression test
for a bug introduced by commit 72c3c0fe54a3 ("x86/kvm: Use generic xfer
to guest work function"), where TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME would be cleared by KVM
without updating rseq, leading to a stale CPU ID and other badness.
