scsi: lpfc: Fix compilation errors on kernels with no CONFIG_DEBUG_FS

The Kernel test robot flagged the following warning:

  ".../lpfc_init.c:7788:35: error: 'struct lpfc_sli4_hba' has no member
   named 'c_stat'"

Reviewing this issue highlighted that one of the recent patches caused the
driver to no longer compile cleanly if CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is not set.

Correct the different areas that are failing to compile.
