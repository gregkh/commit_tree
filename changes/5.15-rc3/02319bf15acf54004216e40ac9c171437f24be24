net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix array overrun in bcm_sf2_num_active_ports()

After d12e1c464988 ("net: dsa: b53: Set correct number of ports in the
DSA struct") we stopped setting dsa_switch::num_ports to DSA_MAX_PORTS,
which created an off by one error between the statically allocated
bcm_sf2_priv::port_sts array (of size DSA_MAX_PORTS). When
dsa_is_cpu_port() is used, we end-up accessing an out of bounds member
and causing a NPD.

Fix this by iterating with the appropriate port count using
ds->num_ports.
