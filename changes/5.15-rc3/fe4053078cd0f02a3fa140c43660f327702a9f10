net: dsa: microchip: ksz8863: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown

Since commit 2f1e8ea726e9 ("net: dsa: link interfaces with the DSA
master to get rid of lockdep warnings"), DSA gained a requirement which
it did not fulfill, which is to unlink itself from the DSA master at
shutdown time.

Since the Microchip sub-driver for KSZ8863 was introduced after the bad
commit, it has never worked with DSA masters which decide to unregister
their net_device on shutdown, effectively hanging the reboot process.
To fix that, we need to call dsa_switch_shutdown.

Since this driver expects the MDIO bus to be backed by mdio_bitbang, I
don't think there is currently any MDIO bus driver which implements its
->shutdown by redirecting it to ->remove, but in any case, to be
compatible with that pattern, it is necessary to implement an "if this
then not that" scheme, to avoid ->remove and ->shutdown from being
called both for the same struct device.
