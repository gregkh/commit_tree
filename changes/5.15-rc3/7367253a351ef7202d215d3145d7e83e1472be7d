btrfs: subpage: disable inline extent creation

[BUG]
When running the following fsx command (extracted from generic/127) on
subpage filesystem, it can create inline extent with regular extents:

  fsx -q -l 262144 -o 65536 -S 191110531 -N 9057 -R -W $mnt/file > /tmp/fsx

The offending extent would look like:

  item 9 key (257 INODE_REF 256) itemoff 15703 itemsize 14
    index 2 namelen 4 name: file
  item 10 key (257 EXTENT_DATA 0) itemoff 14975 itemsize 728
    generation 7 type 0 (inline)
    inline extent data size 707 ram_bytes 707 compression 0 (none)
  item 11 key (257 EXTENT_DATA 4096) itemoff 14922 itemsize 53
    generation 7 type 2 (prealloc)
    prealloc data disk byte 102346752 nr 4096
    prealloc data offset 0 nr 4096

[CAUSE]
For subpage filesystem, the writeback is triggered in page units, which
means, even if we just want to writeback range [16K, 20K) for 64K page
system, we will still try to writeback any dirty sector of range [0, 64K).

This is never a problem if sectorsize == PAGE_SIZE, but for subpage,
this can cause unexpected problems.

For above test case, the last several operations from fsx are:

 9055 trunc      from 0x40000 to 0x2c3
 9057 falloc     from 0x164c to 0x19d2 (0x386 bytes)

In operation 9055, we dirtied sector [0, 4096), then in falloc, we call
btrfs_wait_ordered_range(inode, start=4096, len=4096), only expecting to
writeback any dirty data in [4096, 8192), but nothing else.

Unfortunately, in subpage case, above btrfs_wait_ordered_range() will
trigger writeback of the range [0, 64K), which includes the data at
[0, 4096).

And since at the call site, we haven't yet increased i_size, which is
still 707, this means cow_file_range() can insert an inline extent.

Resulting above inline + regular extent.

[WORKAROUND]
I don't really have any good short-term solution yet, as this means all
operations that would trigger writeback need to be reviewed for any
i_size change.

So here I choose to disable inline extent creation for subpage case as a
workaround.  We have done tons of work just to avoid such extent, so I
don't to create an exception just for subpage.

This only affects inline extent creation, subpage has no problem reading
existing inline extents at all.
