spi: spi-zynq-qspi: use wait_for_completion_timeout to make zynq_qspi_exec_mem_op not interruptible

The function wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout will return
-ERESTARTSYS immediately when receiving SIGKILL signal which is sent
by "jffs2_gcd_mtd" during umounting jffs2. This will break the SPI memory
operation because the data transmitting may begin before the command or
address transmitting completes. Use wait_for_completion_timeout to prevent
the process from being interruptible.
