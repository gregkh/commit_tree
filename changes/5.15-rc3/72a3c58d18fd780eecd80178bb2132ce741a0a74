net/mlx4_en: Resolve bad operstate value

Any link state change that's done prior to net device registration
isn't reflected on the state, thus the operational state is left
obsolete, with 'UNKNOWN' status.

To resolve the issue, query link state from FW upon open operations
to ensure operational state is updated.
