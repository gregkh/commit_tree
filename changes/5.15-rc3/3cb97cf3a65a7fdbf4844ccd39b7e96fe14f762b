ASoC: Intel: sof_cs42l42: support arbitrary DAI link sequence

Currently there are two types of DAI Link sequences defined in
topology files, one starts from speaker link and the other starts from
headphone link.

Type 1: SPK - HP - DMIC - HDMI
Type 2: HP - DMIC - HDMI - SPK

Here we add a macro SOF_CS42L42_DAILINK to define the DAI Link
sequence in quirk and refactor the sof_card_dai_links_create()
function to support arbitrary DAI Link sequence.
