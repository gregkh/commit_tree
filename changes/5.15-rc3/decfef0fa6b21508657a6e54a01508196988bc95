net: ipa: use gsi->version for channel suspend/resume

The GSI layer has the IPA version now, so there's no need for
version-specific flags to be passed from IPA.  One instance of
this is in gsi_channel_suspend() and gsi_channel_resume(), which
indicate whether or not the endpoint suspend is implemented by
GSI stopping the channel.  We can make that determination based
on gsi->version, eliminating the need for a Boolean flag in those
functions.
