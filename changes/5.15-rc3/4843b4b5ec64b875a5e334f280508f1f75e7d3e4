xhci: fix even more unsafe memory usage in xhci tracing

Removes static char buffer usage in the following decode functions:
	xhci_decode_ctrl_ctx()
	xhci_decode_slot_context()
	xhci_decode_usbsts()
	xhci_decode_doorbell()
	xhci_decode_ep_context()

Caller must provide a buffer to use.
In tracing use __get_str() as recommended to pass buffer.

Minor changes are needed in other xhci code as these functions are also
used elsewhere
