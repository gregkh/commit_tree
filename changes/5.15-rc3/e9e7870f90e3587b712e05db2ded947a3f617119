s390/dump: introduce boot data 'oldmem_data'

The new boot data struct shall replace global variables OLDMEM_BASE and
OLDMEM_SIZE. It is initialized in the decompressor and passed
to the decompressed kernel. In comparison to the old solution, this one
doesn't access data at fixed physical addresses which will become important
when the decompressor becomes relocatable.
