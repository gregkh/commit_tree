scsi: bsg: Fix device unregistration

device_initialize() is used to take a refcount on the device. However,
put_device() is not called during device teardown. This leads to a
leak of private data of the driver core, dev_name(), etc. This is
reported by kmemleak at boot time if we compile kernel with
DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE.

Fix memory leaks during unregistration and implement a release
function.
