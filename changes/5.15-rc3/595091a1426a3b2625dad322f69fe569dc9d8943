usb: gadget: f_uac2: Add missing companion descriptor for feedback EP

The f_uac2 function fails to enumerate when connected in SuperSpeed
due to the feedback endpoint missing the companion descriptor.
Add a new ss_epin_fback_desc_comp descriptor and append it behind the
ss_epin_fback_desc both in the static definition of the ss_audio_desc
structure as well as its dynamic construction in setup_headers().
