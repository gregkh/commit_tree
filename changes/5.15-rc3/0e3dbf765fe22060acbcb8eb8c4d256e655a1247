kselftest/arm64: signal: Skip tests if required features are missing

During initialization of a signal testcase, features declared as required
are properly checked against the running system but no action is then taken
to effectively skip such a testcase.

Fix core signals test logic to abort initialization and report such a
testcase as skipped to the KSelfTest framework.
