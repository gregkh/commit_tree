serial: core: Report magic multiplier extra baud rates

Report extra baud rates supported above the base rate for ports with the
UPF_MAGIC_MULTIPLIER property, so that people have a way to find out
that they can be used with their system, e.g.:

Serial: 8250/16550 driver, 5 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
printk: console [ttyS0] disabled
serial8250.0: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
serial8250.0: ttyS0 extra baud rates supported: 230400, 460800
printk: console [ttyS0] enabled
printk: bootconsole [uart8250] disabled
serial8250.0: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
serial8250.0: ttyS1 extra baud rates supported: 230400, 460800
serial8250.0: ttyS2 at MMIO 0x1f000900 (irq = 20, base_baud = 230400) is a 16550A

Otherwise there is no clear way to figure this out, as the feature is
only reported as an obscure TTY flag in bit 16:

$ cat /sys/class/tty/ttyS[0-2]/flags
0x10010040
0x10010040
0x90000040
$
