drm/i915: apply WaEnableVGAAccessThroughIOPort as needed

Currently as the workaround is applied the screen flickers. As a result
we do not achieve seamless boot experience.

Avoiding the issue in the common use-case might be hard, although we can
resolve it for dual GPU setups - when the "other" GPU is primary and/or
outputs are connected to it.

With this I was able to get seamless experience on my Intel/Nvidia box,
running systemd-boot and sddm/Xorg. Note that the i915 driver is within
initrd while the Nvidia one is not.

Without this patch, the splash presented by systemd-boot (UEFI BGRT) is
torn down as the code-path kicks in, leaving the monitor blank until the
login manager starts.

Same issue were reported with plymouth/grub, although personally I
wasn't able to get them to behave on my setup.
