s390/boot: move sclp early buffer from fixed address in asm to C

To make the decompressor relocatable, the early SCLP buffer with a fixed
address must be replaced with a relocatable C buffer of the according size
and alignment as required by SCLP.

Introduce a new function sclp_early_set_buffer() into the SCLP driver
which enables the decompressor to change the SCLP early buffer at any time.
This will be useful when the decompressor becomes fully relocatable and
might need to change the SCLP early buffer to one with an address < 2G
as required by SCLP because it was loaded at an address >= 2G.
