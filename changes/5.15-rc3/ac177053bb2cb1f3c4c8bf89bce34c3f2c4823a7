io_uring: inline fixed part of io_file_get()

Optimise io_file_get() with registered files, which is in a hot path,
by inlining parts of the function. Saves a function call, and
inefficiencies of passing arguments, e.g. evaluating
(sqe_flags & IOSQE_FIXED_FILE).

It couldn't have been done before as compilers were refusing to inline
it because of the function size.
