Revert "drm/i915: Skip over MI_NOOP when parsing"

This reverts a6c5e2aea704 ("drm/i915: Skip over MI_NOOP when parsing").
It complicates the batch parsing code a bit and increases indentation
for no reason other than fast-skipping a command that userspace uses
only rarely.  Sure, there may be IGT tests that fill batches with NOOPs
but that's not a case we should optimize for in the kernel.  We should
optimize for code clarity instead.
