fs/ntfs3: Remove fat ioctl's from ntfs3 driver for now

For some reason we have FAT ioctl calls. Even old ntfs driver did not
use these. We should not use these because it his hard to get things out
of kernel when they are upstream. That's why we remove these for now.

More discussion is needed what ioctl should be implemented and what is
important.
