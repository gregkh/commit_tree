xfs: convert xfs_fs_geometry to use mount feature checks

Reporting filesystem features to userspace is currently superblock
based. Now we have a general mount-based feature infrastructure,
switch to using the xfs_mount rather than the superblock directly.

This reduces the size of the function by over 300 bytes.

$ size -t fs/xfs/built-in.a

after	1127535  311352     484 1439371  15f68b (TOTALS)
