wcn36xx: Fix missing frame timestamp for beacon/probe-resp

When receiving a beacon or probe response, we should update the
boottime_ns field which is the timestamp the frame was received at.
(cf mac80211.h)

This fixes a scanning issue with Android since it relies on this
timestamp to determine when the AP has been seen for the last time
(via the nl80211 BSS_LAST_SEEN_BOOTTIME parameter).
