bus: mhi: core: Replace DMA allocation wrappers with original APIs

There is nothing special done within the mhi_alloc_coherent() and
the mhi_free_coherent() wrapper functions. They only directly
call the equivalent DMA allocation functions. Replace them with
the original function calls such that the implementation is clear
and direct.
