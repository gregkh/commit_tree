amiserial: remove serial_* strings

Remove a print of serial_name and serial_version from the probe
function, i.e. show_serial_version() from amiga_serial_probe(). The
value of such a print is minimal.

Aside from that, the version is artificial (copied from the serial core
in 2.3.45pre2 and never increased). So inline the version into
seq_printf's format string in rs_proc_show() and remove both strings
completely.
