drm/panfrost:fix the exception name always "UNKNOWN"

The exception_code in register is only 8 bits,So if
fault_status in panfrost_gpu_irq_handler() don't
(& 0xFF),it can't get correct exception reason.

and it's better to show all of the register value
to custom,so it's better fault_status don't (& 0xFF).
