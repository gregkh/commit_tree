MAINTAINERS: usb, update Peter Korsgaard's entries

Peter's e-mail in MAINTAINERS is defunct:
This is the qmail-send program at a.mx.sunsite.dk.
<jacmet@sunsite.dk>:
      Sorry, no mailbox here by that name. (#5.1.1)

Peter says:
** Ahh yes, it should be changed to peter@korsgaard.com.

However he also says:
** I haven't had access to c67x00 hw for quite some years though, so maybe
** it should be marked Orphan instead?

So change as he wishes.
