net: dsa: sja1105: reset the port pvid when leaving a VLAN-aware bridge

Now that we no longer have the ultra-central sja1105_build_vlan_table(),
we need to be more careful about checking all corner cases manually.

For example, when a port leaves a VLAN-aware bridge, it becomes
standalone so its pvid should become a tag_8021q RX VLAN again. However,
sja1105_commit_pvid() only gets called from sja1105_bridge_vlan_add()
and from sja1105_vlan_filtering(), and no VLAN awareness change takes
place (VLAN filtering is a global setting for sja1105, so the switch
remains VLAN-aware overall).

This means that we need to put another sja1105_commit_pvid() call in
sja1105_bridge_member().
