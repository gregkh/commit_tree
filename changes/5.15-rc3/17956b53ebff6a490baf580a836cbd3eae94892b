usb: gadget: r8a66597: fix a loop in set_feature()

This loop is supposed to loop until if reads something other than
CS_IDST or until it times out after 30,000 attempts.  But because of
the || vs && bug, it will never time out and instead it will loop a
minimum of 30,000 times.

This bug is quite old but the code is only used in USB_DEVICE_TEST_MODE
so it probably doesn't affect regular usage.

Fixes: 96fe53ef5498 ("usb: gadget: r8a66597-udc: add support for TEST_MODE")
