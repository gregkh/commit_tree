xhci: Set HCD flag to defer primary roothub registration

Set "HCD_FLAG_DEFER_RH_REGISTER" to hcd->flags in xhci_run() to defer
registering primary roothub in usb_add_hcd(). This will make sure both
primary roothub and secondary roothub will be registered along with the
second HCD. This is required for cold plugged USB devices to be detected
in certain PCIe USB cards (like Inateck USB card connected to AM64 EVM
or J7200 EVM).
