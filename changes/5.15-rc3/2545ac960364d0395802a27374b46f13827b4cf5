drm/mgag200: Abstract pixel PLL via struct mgag200_pll

Move all PLL compute and update functions into mgag200_pll.c. No
functional changes to the rsp algorithms.

Introduce struct mgag200_pll and mgag200_pll_funcs. The data strutures
abstract the details of each revision's PLL. Perform calls to compute
and update functionality via function pointers. Init the PLL once as
part of the driver initialization.
