ALSA: usb-audio: Introduce quirk_flags field

As more and more device-specific workarounds came up and gathered in
various places, it becomes harder to manage.  Now it's time to clean
up and collect workarounds more consistently and make them more easily
applicable.

This patch is the first step for that: a new field quirk_flags is
introduced in snd_usb_audio struct to contain the bit flags for
various device-specific quirks.  Those are separate one from the
quirks in quirks-table.h; the quirks-table.h entries are for more
intrusive stuff that needs the descriptor override, while the new
quirk_flags is for easier ones that are tied with the vendor:product
IDs.

In this patch, as the first example, we convert the list of devices
and vendors to ignore GET_SAMPLE_RATE, formerly defined in
snb_usb_get_sample_rate_quirk().
