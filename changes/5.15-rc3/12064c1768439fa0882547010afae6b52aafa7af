Revert "ACPI: Add memory semantics to acpi_os_map_memory()"

This reverts commit 437b38c51162f8b87beb28a833c4d5dc85fa864e.

The memory semantics added in commit 437b38c51162 causes SystemMemory
Operation region, whose address range is not described in the EFI memory
map to be mapped as NormalNC memory on arm64 platforms (through
acpi_os_map_memory() in acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler()).

This triggers the following abort on an ARM64 Ampere eMAG machine,
because presumably the physical address range area backing the Opregion
does not support NormalNC memory attributes driven on the bus.

If the Opregion address range is not present in the EFI memory map there
is no way for us to determine the memory attributes to use to map it -
defaulting to NormalNC does not work (and it is not correct on a memory
region that may have read side-effects) and therefore commit
437b38c51162 should be reverted, which means reverting back to the
original behavior whereby address ranges that are mapped using
acpi_os_map_memory() default to the safe devicenGnRnE attributes on
ARM64 if the mapped address range is not defined in the EFI memory map.
