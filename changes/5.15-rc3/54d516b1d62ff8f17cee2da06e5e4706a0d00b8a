mm/gup: small refactoring: simplify try_grab_page()

try_grab_page() does the same thing as try_grab_compound_head(..., refs=1,
...), just with a different API.  So there is a lot of code duplication
there.

Change try_grab_page() to call try_grab_compound_head(), while keeping the
API contract identical for callers.

Also, now that try_grab_compound_head() always has a caller, remove the
__maybe_unused annotation.
