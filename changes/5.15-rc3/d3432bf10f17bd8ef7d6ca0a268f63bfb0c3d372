net: Support filtering interfaces on no master

Currently there's support for filtering neighbours/links for interfaces
which have a specific master device (using the IFLA_MASTER/NDA_MASTER
attributes).

This patch adds support for filtering interfaces/neighbours dump for
interfaces that *don't* have a master.
