KVM: x86: hyper-v: Deactivate APICv only when AutoEOI feature is in use

APICV_INHIBIT_REASON_HYPERV is currently unconditionally forced upon
SynIC activation as SynIC's AutoEOI is incompatible with APICv/AVIC. It is,
however, possible to track whether the feature was actually used by the
guest and only inhibit APICv/AVIC when needed.

TLFS suggests a dedicated 'HV_DEPRECATING_AEOI_RECOMMENDED' flag to let
Windows know that AutoEOI feature should be avoided. While it's up to
KVM userspace to set the flag, KVM can help a bit by exposing global
APICv/AVIC enablement.

Maxim:
   - always set HV_DEPRECATING_AEOI_RECOMMENDED in kvm_get_hv_cpuid,
     since this feature can be used regardless of AVIC

Paolo:
   - use arch.apicv_update_lock to protect the hv->synic_auto_eoi_used
     instead of atomic ops
