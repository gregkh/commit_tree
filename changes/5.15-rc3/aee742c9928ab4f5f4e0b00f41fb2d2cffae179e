fs: dlm: fix return -EINTR on recovery stopped

This patch will return -EINTR instead of 1 if recovery is stopped. In
case of ping_members() the return value will be checked if the error is
-EINTR for signaling another recovery was triggered and the whole
recovery process will come to a clean end to process the next one.
Returning 1 will abort the recovery process and can leave the recovery
in a broken state.

It was reported with the following kernel log message attached and a gfs2
mount stopped working:

"dlm: bobvirt1: dlm_recover_members error 1"

whereas 1 was returned because of a conversion of "dlm_recovery_stopped()"
to an errno was missing which this patch will introduce. While on it all
other possible missing errno conversions at other places were added as
they are done as in other places.

It might be worth to check the error case at this recovery level,
because some of the functionality also returns -ENOBUFS and check why
recovery ends in a broken state. However this will fix the issue if
another recovery was triggered at some points of recovery handling.
