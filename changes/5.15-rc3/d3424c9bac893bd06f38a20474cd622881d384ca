fanotify: minor cosmetic adjustments to fid labels

With the idea to support additional info record types in the future
i.e. fanotify_event_info_pidfd, it's a good idea to rename some of the
labels assigned to some of the existing fid related functions,
parameters, etc which more accurately represent the intent behind
their usage.

For example, copy_info_to_user() was defined with a generic function
label, which arguably reads as being supportive of different info
record types, however the parameter list for this function is
explicitly tailored towards the creation and copying of the
fanotify_event_info_fid records. This same point applies to the macro
defined as FANOTIFY_INFO_HDR_LEN.

With fanotify_event_info_len(), we change the parameter label so that
the function implies that it can be extended to calculate the length
for additional info record types.
