NLM: Fix svcxdr_encode_owner()

Dai Ngo reports that, since the XDR overhaul, the NLM server crashes
when the TEST procedure wants to return NLM_DENIED. There is a bug
in svcxdr_encode_owner() that none of our standard test cases found.

Replace the open-coded function with a call to an appropriate
pre-fabricated XDR helper.
