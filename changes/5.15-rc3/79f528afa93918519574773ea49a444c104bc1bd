nvme-multipath: fix ANA state updates when a namespace is not present

nvme_update_ana_state() has a deficiency that results in a failure to
properly update the ana state for a namespace in the following case:

  NSIDs in ctrl->namespaces:	1, 3,    4
  NSIDs in desc->nsids:		1, 2, 3, 4

Loop iteration 0:
    ns index = 0, n = 0, ns->head->ns_id = 1, nsid = 1, MATCH.
Loop iteration 1:
    ns index = 1, n = 1, ns->head->ns_id = 3, nsid = 2, NO MATCH.
Loop iteration 2:
    ns index = 2, n = 2, ns->head->ns_id = 4, nsid = 4, MATCH.

Where the update to the ANA state of NSID 3 is missed.  To fix this
increment n and retry the update with the same ns when ns->head->ns_id is
higher than nsid,
