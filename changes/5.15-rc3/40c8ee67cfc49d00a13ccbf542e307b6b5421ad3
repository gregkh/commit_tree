init: don't panic if mount_nodev_root failed

Attempt to mount 9p file system as root gives the following kernel panic:

 9pnet_virtio: no channels available for device root
 Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root "root" (9p), err=-2

QEMU command line:
 "qemu-system-x86_64 -append root=/dev/root rw rootfstype=9p rootflags=trans=virtio ..."

This error is because root_device_name is truncated in prepare_namespace() from
being "/dev/root" to be "root" prior to call to mount_nodev_root().

As a solution, don't treat errors in mount_nodev_root() as errors that
require panics and allow failback to the mount flow that existed before
patch citied in Fixes tag.
