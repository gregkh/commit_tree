KVM: selftests: Remove __NR_userfaultfd syscall fallback

Revert the __NR_userfaultfd syscall fallback added for KVM selftests now
that x86's unistd_{32,63}.h overrides are under uapi/ and thus not in
KVM selftests' search path, i.e. now that KVM gets x86 syscall numbers
from the installed kernel headers.

No functional change intended.
