btrfs: replace BUG_ON() in btrfs_csum_one_bio() with proper error handling

There is a BUG_ON() in btrfs_csum_one_bio() to catch code logic error.
It has indeed caught several bugs during subpage development.
But the BUG_ON() itself will bring down the whole system which is
an overkill.

Replace it with a WARN() and exit gracefully, so that it won't crash the
whole system while we can still catch the code logic error.
