btrfs: use the filemap_fdatawrite_wbc helper for delalloc shrinking

sync_inode() has some holes that can cause problems if we're under heavy
ENOSPC pressure.  If there's writeback running on a separate thread
sync_inode() will skip writing the inode altogether.  What we really
want is to make sure writeback has been started on all the pages to make
sure we can see the ordered extents and wait on them if appropriate.
Switch to this new helper which will allow us to accomplish this and
avoid ENOSPC'ing early.
