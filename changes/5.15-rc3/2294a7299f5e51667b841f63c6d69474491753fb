EDAC/i10nm: Fix NVDIMM detection

MCDDRCFG is a per-channel register and uses bit{0,1} to indicate
the NVDIMM presence on DIMM slot{0,1}. Current i10nm_edac driver
wrongly uses MCDDRCFG as per-DIMM register and fails to detect
the NVDIMM.

Fix it by reading MCDDRCFG as per-channel register and using its
bit{0,1} to check whether the NVDIMM is populated on DIMM slot{0,1}.
