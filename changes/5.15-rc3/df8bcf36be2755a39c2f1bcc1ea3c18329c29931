ALSA: es1688: Avoid devres management for es1688 object creation

The recent refactoring of es1688 object creation with the use of
devres caused a problem with the non-PnP probe of GUS driver, as it
tries to probe multiple times with different parameters  That is, this
object needs the immediate resource release and the devres doesn't fit
for it.

This patch reverts partially the commit for restoring the classic
resource management for es1688 object.
