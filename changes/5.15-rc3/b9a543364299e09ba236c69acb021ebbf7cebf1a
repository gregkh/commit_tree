media: Documentation: media: Improve camera sensor documentation

Modernise the documentation to make it more precise and update the use of
pixel rate control and various other changes. In particular:

- Use non-proportional font for file names, properties as well as
  controls.

- The unit of the HBLANK control is pixels, not lines.

- The unit of PIXEL_RATE control is pixels per second, not Hz.

- Merge common requirements for CSI-2 and parallel busses.

- Include all DT properties needed for assigned clocks.

- Fix referencing the link rate control.

- SMIA driver's new name is CCS driver.

- The PIXEL_RATE control denotes pixel rate on the pixel array on camera
  sensors. Do not suggest it is used to tell the maximum pixel rate on the
  bus anymore.

- Improve ReST syntax (plain struct and function names).

- Remove the suggestion to use s_power() in receiver drivers.

- Make MIPI website URL use HTTPS, add Wikipedia links to BT.601 and
  BT.656.
