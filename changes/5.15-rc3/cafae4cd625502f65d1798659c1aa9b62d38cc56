Bluetooth: Fix handling of LE Enhanced Connection Complete

LE Enhanced Connection Complete contains the Local RPA used in the
connection which must be used when set otherwise there could problems
when pairing since the address used by the remote stack could be the
Local RPA:

BLUETOOTH CORE SPECIFICATION Version 5.2 | Vol 4, Part E
page 2396

  'Resolvable Private Address being used by the local device for this
  connection. This is only valid when the Own_Address_Type (from the
  HCI_LE_Create_Connection, HCI_LE_Set_Advertising_Parameters,
  HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Parameters, or
  HCI_LE_Extended_Create_Connection commands) is set to 0x02 or
  0x03, and the Controller generated a resolvable private address for the
  local device using a non-zero local IRK. For other Own_Address_Type
  values, the Controller shall return all zeros.'
