PCI: Add AMD GPU multi-function power dependencies

Some AMD GPUs have built-in USB xHCI and USB Type-C UCSI controllers with
power dependencies between the GPU and the other functions as in
6d2e369f0d4c ("PCI: Add NVIDIA GPU multi-function power dependencies").

Add device link support for the AMD integrated USB xHCI and USB Type-C UCSI
controllers.

Without this, runtime power management, including GPU resume and temp and
fan sensors don't work correctly.
