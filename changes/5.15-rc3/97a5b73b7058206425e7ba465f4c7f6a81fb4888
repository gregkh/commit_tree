arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280-idp: Add device tree files for IDP2

Move all the common device tree bits for both sc7280 IDPs into a
sc7280-idp.dtsi and create 2 different dts files (sc7280-idp.dts
and sc7280-idp2.dts) in order to manage differences across the
IDP SKU1 and SKU2 Boards.
PMR735A is present on IDP board only and is not present on IDP2.
