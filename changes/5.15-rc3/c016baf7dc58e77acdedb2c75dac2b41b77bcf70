PM: domains: Add support for 'required-opps' to set default perf state

Some devices within power domains with performance states do not
support DVFS, but still need to vote on a default/static state
while they are active. They can express this using the 'required-opps'
property in device tree, which points to the phandle of the OPP
supported by the corresponding power-domains.

Add support to parse this information from DT and then set the
specified performance state during attach and drop it on detach.
runtime suspend/resume callbacks already have logic to drop/set
the vote as needed and should take care of dropping the default
perf state vote on runtime suspend and restore it back on runtime
resume.
