cifs: fix incorrect check for null pointer in header_assemble

Although very unlikely that the tlink pointer would be null in this case,
get_next_mid function can in theory return null (but not an error)
so need to check for null (not for IS_ERR, which can not be returned
here).

Address warning:

        fs/smbfs_client/connect.c:2392 cifs_match_super()
        warn: 'tlink' isn't an ERR_PTR
