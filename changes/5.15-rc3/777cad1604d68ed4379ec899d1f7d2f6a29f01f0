ksmbd: remove select FS_POSIX_ACL in Kconfig

ksmbd is forcing to turn on FS_POSIX_ACL in Kconfig to use vfs acl
functions(posix_acl_alloc, get_acl, set_posix_acl). OpenWRT and other
platform doesn't use acl and this config is disable by default in
kernel. This patch use IS_ENABLED() to know acl config is enable and use
acl function if it is enable.
