bpf: Support "%c" in bpf_bprintf_prepare().

/proc/net/unix uses "%c" to print a single-byte character to escape '\0' in
the name of the abstract UNIX domain socket.  The following selftest uses
it, so this patch adds support for "%c".  Note that it does not support
wide character ("%lc" and "%llc") for simplicity.
