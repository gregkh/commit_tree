mwifiex: pcie: add DMI-based quirk implementation for Surface devices

This commit adds the ability to apply device-specific quirks to the
mwifiex driver. It uses DMI matching similar to the quirks brcmfmac uses
with dmi.c. We'll add identifiers to match various MS Surface devices,
which this is primarily meant for, later.

This commit is a slightly modified version of a previous patch sent in
by Tsuchiya Yuto.
