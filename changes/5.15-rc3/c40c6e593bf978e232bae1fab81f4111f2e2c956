kfence: test: fail fast if disabled at boot

Fail kfence_test fast if KFENCE was disabled at boot, instead of each test
case trying several seconds to allocate from KFENCE and failing.  KUnit
will fail all test cases if kunit_suite::init returns an error.

Even if KFENCE was disabled, we still want the test to fail, so that CI
systems that parse KUnit output will alert on KFENCE being disabled
(accidentally or otherwise).
