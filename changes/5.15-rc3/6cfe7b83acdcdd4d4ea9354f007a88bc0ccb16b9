KVM: SVM: Drop redundant writes to vmcb->save.cr4 at RESET/INIT

Drop direct writes to vmcb->save.cr4 during vCPU RESET/INIT, as the
values being written are fully redundant with respect to
svm_set_cr4(vcpu, 0) a few lines earlier.  Note, svm_set_cr4() also
correctly forces X86_CR4_PAE when NPT is disabled.

No functional change intended.
