mcb: fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus()

There are two bugs:
1) If ida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier)
   but we haven't yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that
   leads to a use after free.
2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to
   release the bus.  This will free the internal resources tied to the
   device and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.

Fixes: 5d9e2ab9fea4 ("mcb: Implement bus->dev.release callback")
Fixes: 18d288198099 ("mcb: Correctly initialize the bus's device")
