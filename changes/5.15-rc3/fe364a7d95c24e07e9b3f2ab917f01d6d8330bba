dmaengine: dw: Program xBAR hardware for Elkhart Lake

Intel Elkhart Lake PSE DMA implementation is integrated with crossbar IP
in order to serve more hardware than there are DMA request lines available.

Due to this, program xBAR hardware to make flexible support of PSE peripheral.

The Device-to-Device has not been tested and it's not supported by DMA Engine,
but it's left in the code for the sake of documenting hardware features.
