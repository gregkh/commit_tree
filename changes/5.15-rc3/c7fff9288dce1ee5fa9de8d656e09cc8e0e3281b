signal: Remove the generic __ARCH_SI_TRAPNO support

Now that __ARCH_SI_TRAPNO is no longer set by any architecture remove
all of the code it enabled from the kernel.

On alpha and sparc a more explict approach of using
send_sig_fault_trapno or force_sig_fault_trapno in the very limited
circumstances where si_trapno was set to a non-zero value.

The generic support that is being removed always set si_trapno on all
fault signals.  With only SIGILL ILL_ILLTRAP on sparc and SIGFPE and
SIGTRAP TRAP_UNK on alpla providing si_trapno values asking all senders
of fault signals to provide an si_trapno value does not make sense.

Making si_trapno an ordinary extension of the fault siginfo layout has
enabled the architecture generic implementation of SIGTRAP TRAP_PERF,
and enables other faulting signals to grow architecture generic
senders as well.
