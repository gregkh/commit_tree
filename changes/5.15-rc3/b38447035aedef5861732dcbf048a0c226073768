staging: r8188eu: Remove variables and simplify PHY_SwChnl8188E()

Remove "bResult" and "tmpchannel" and all tests and assignments that
are related to them in the code of PHY_SwChnl8188E().

"bResult" was always true, therefore its test led to a null statement.
"tmpchannel" was used only to restore "pHalData->CurrentChannel" to its
previous value only if _PHY_SwChnl8192C() was not called; therefore
assign "channel" to "pHalData->CurrentChannel" if and only if
_PHY_SwChnl8192C() is to be executed (and get rid of that temporary
storage).
