drm/i915: Drop the CONTEXT_CLONE API (v2)

This API allows one context to grab bits out of another context upon
creation.  It can be used as a short-cut for setparam(getparam()) for
things like I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_VM.  However, it's never been used by any
real userspace.  It's used by a few IGT tests and that's it.  Since it
doesn't add any real value (most of the stuff you can CLONE you can copy
in other ways), drop it.

There is one thing that this API allows you to clone which you cannot
clone via getparam/setparam: timelines.  However, timelines are an
implementation detail of i915 and not really something that needs to be
exposed to userspace.  Also, sharing timelines between contexts isn't
obviously useful and supporting it has the potential to complicate i915
internally.  It also doesn't add any functionality that the client can't
get in other ways.  If a client really wants a shared timeline, they can
use a syncobj and set it as an in and out fence on every submit.
