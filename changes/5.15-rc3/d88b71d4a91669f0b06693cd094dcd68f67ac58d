libbpf: Remove unused bpf_link's destroy operation, but add dealloc

bpf_link->destroy() isn't used by any code, so remove it. Instead, add ability
to override deallocation procedure, with default doing plain free(link). This
is necessary for cases when we want to "subclass" struct bpf_link to keep
extra information, as is the case in the next patch adding struct
bpf_link_perf.
