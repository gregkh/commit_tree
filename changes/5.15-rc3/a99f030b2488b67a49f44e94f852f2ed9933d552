net: switchdev: Simplify 'mlxsw_sp_mc_write_mdb_entry()'

Use 'bitmap_alloc()/bitmap_free()' instead of hand-writing it.
This makes the code less verbose.

Also, use 'bitmap_alloc()' instead of 'bitmap_zalloc()' because the bitmap
is fully overridden by a 'bitmap_copy()' call just after its allocation.

While at it, remove an extra and unneeded space.
