swiotlb-xen: this is PV-only on x86

The code is unreachable for HVM or PVH, and it also makes little sense
in auto-translated environments. On Arm, with
xen_{create,destroy}_contiguous_region() both being stubs, I have a hard
time seeing what good the Xen specific variant does - the generic one
ought to be fine for all purposes there. Still Arm code explicitly
references symbols here, so the code will continue to be included there.

Instead of making PCI_XEN's "select" conditional, simply drop it -
SWIOTLB_XEN will be available unconditionally in the PV case anyway, and
is - as explained above - dead code in non-PV environments.

This in turn allows dropping the stubs for
xen_{create,destroy}_contiguous_region(), the former of which was broken
anyway - it failed to set the DMA handle output.
