x86/insn, tools/x86: Fix undefined behavior due to potential unaligned accesses

Don't perform unaligned loads in __get_next() and __peek_nbyte_next() as
these are forms of undefined behavior:

"A pointer to an object or incomplete type may be converted to a pointer
to a different object or incomplete type. If the resulting pointer
is not correctly aligned for the pointed-to type, the behavior is
undefined."

(from http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf)

These problems were identified using the undefined behavior sanitizer
(ubsan) with the tools version of the code and perf test.
