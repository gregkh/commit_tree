drm/panfrost: Queue jobs on the hardware

The hardware has a set of '_NEXT' registers that can hold a second job
while the first is executing. Make use of these registers to enqueue a
second job per slot.

v5:
* Fix a comment in panfrost_job_init()

v3:
* Fix the done/err job dequeuing logic to get a valid active state
* Only enable the second slot on GPUs supporting jobchain disambiguation
* Split interrupt handling in sub-functions
