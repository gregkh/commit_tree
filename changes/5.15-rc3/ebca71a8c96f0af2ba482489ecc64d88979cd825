cpu/hotplug: Add debug printks for hotplug callback failures

CPU hotplug callbacks can fail and cause a rollback to the previous
state. These failures are silent and therefore hard to debug.

Add pr_debug() to the up and down paths which provide information about the
error code, the CPU and the failed state. The debug printks can be enabled
via kernel command line or sysfs.
