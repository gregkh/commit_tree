drm/i915: Stop storing the ring size in the ring pointer (v3)

Previously, we were storing the ring size in the ring pointer before it
was actually allocated.  We would then guard setting the ring size on
checking for CONTEXT_ALLOC_BIT.  This is error-prone at best and really
only saves us a few bytes on something that already burns at least 4K.
Instead, this patch adds a new ring_size field and makes everything use
that.

v2 (Daniel Vetter):
 - Replace 512 * SZ_4K with SZ_2M

v2 (Jason Ekstrand):
 - Rebase on top of page migration code
