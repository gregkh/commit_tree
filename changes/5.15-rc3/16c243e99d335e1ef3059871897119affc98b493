udmabuf: Add support for mapping hugepages (v4)

If the VMM's (Qemu) memory backend is backed up by memfd + Hugepages
(hugetlbfs and not THP), we have to first find the hugepage(s) where
the Guest allocations are located and then extract the regular 4k
sized subpages from them.

v2: Ensure that the subpage and hugepage offsets are calculated correctly
when the range of subpage allocations cuts across multiple hugepages.

v3: Instead of repeatedly looking up the hugepage for each subpage,
only do it when the subpage allocation crosses over into a different
hugepage. (suggested by Gerd and DW)

v4: Fix the following warning identified by checkpatch:
CHECK:OPEN_ENDED_LINE: Lines should not end with a '('
