usb: musb: musb_dsps: request_irq() after initializing musb

If IRQ occurs between calling  dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq()
and  dsps_create_musb_pdev(), then null pointer dereference occurs
since glue->musb wasn't initialized yet.

The patch puts initializing of neccesery data before registration
of the interrupt handler.
