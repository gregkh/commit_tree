futex: Return error code instead of assigning it without effect

The check on the rt_waiter and top_waiter->pi_state is assigning an error
return code to ret but this later gets re-assigned, hence the check is
ineffective.

Return -EINVAL rather than assigning it to ret which was the original
intent.
