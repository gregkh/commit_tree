net/mlx5e: TC, Remove CONFIG_NET_TC_SKB_EXT dependency when restoring tunnel

CONFIG_NET_TC_SKB_EXT controls the SKB extension support for
restoring chain ids. SKB extension is not required for tunnel
restoration.

Remove the CONFIG_NET_TC_SKB_EXT dependency as a pre-step for
using the tunnel restore methods for sample offload use cases.
