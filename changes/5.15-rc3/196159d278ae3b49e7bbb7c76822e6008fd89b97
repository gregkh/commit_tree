platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Update info for the Chuwi Hi10 Plus (CWI527) tablet

Add info for getting the firmware directly from the UEFI for the Chuwi Hi10
Plus (CWI527), so that the user does not need to manually install the
firmware in /lib/firmware/silead.

This change will make the touchscreen on these devices work OOTB,
without requiring any manual setup.

Also tweak the min and width/height values a bit for more accurate position
reporting.
