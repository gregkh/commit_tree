binder: make sure fd closes complete

During BC_FREE_BUFFER processing, the BINDER_TYPE_FDA object
cleanup may close 1 or more fds. The close operations are
completed using the task work mechanism -- which means the thread
needs to return to userspace or the file object may never be
dereferenced -- which can lead to hung processes.

Force the binder thread back to userspace if an fd is closed during
BC_FREE_BUFFER handling.
