soundwire: add flag to ignore all command/control for mockup devices

SoundWire mockup devices don't take part in the command/control
protocol, so all commands will complete with -ENODATA or
Command_Ignored results. With a flag, we can suppress such errors in
the bus management and make it appear as if all read/writes succeed.
