md: fix a lock order reversal in md_alloc

Commit b0140891a8cea3 ("md: Fix race when creating a new md device.")
not only moved assigning mddev->gendisk before calling add_disk, which
fixes the races described in the commit log, but also added a
mddev->open_mutex critical section over add_disk and creation of the
md kobj.  Adding a kobject after add_disk is racy vs deleting the gendisk
right after adding it, but md already prevents against that by holding
a mddev->active reference.

On the other hand taking this lock added a lock order reversal with what
is not disk->open_mutex (used to be bdev->bd_mutex when the commit was
added) for partition devices, which need that lock for the internal open
for the partition scan, and a recent commit also takes it for
non-partitioned devices, leading to further lockdep splatter.
