mm/shmem.c: fix judgment error in shmem_is_huge()

In the case of SHMEM_HUGE_WITHIN_SIZE, the page index is not rounded up
correctly.  When the page index points to the first page in a huge page,
round_up() cannot bring it to the end of the huge page, but to the end
of the previous one.

An example:

HPAGE_PMD_NR on my machine is 512(2 MB huge page size).  After
allcoating a 3000 KB buffer, I access it at location 2050 KB.  In
shmem_is_huge(), the corresponding index happens to be 512.  After
rounded up by HPAGE_PMD_NR, it will still be 512 which is smaller than
i_size, and shmem_is_huge() will return true.  As a result, my buffer
takes an additional huge page, and that shouldn't happen when
shmem_enabled is set to within_size.
