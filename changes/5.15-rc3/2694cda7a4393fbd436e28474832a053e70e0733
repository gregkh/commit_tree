ASoC: soc-acpi: cnl: add table for SoundWire mockup devices

Add support for two configurations with SoundWire mockup devices that
emulate the two CometLake configurations with one and two amps. This
patch helps test the SOF firmware on an UpExtreme board without any
hardware connected, e.g. by doing a loopback of the playback stream on
capture streams.

The mapping of the partIDs is as follows:

0xAAAA: generic full-duplex codec (not currently used)
0xAA55: headset codec (mock-up of RT711/RT5682) - full-duplex
0x55AA: amplifier (mock-up of RT1308/RT1316/Maxim 98373) - playback
with IV sense feedback
0x5555: mic codec (mock-up of RT715) - capture-only

The tables are added in a separate file to allow for mockup codecs to be
added on other platforms, but the mapping to specific topologies
remains platform-specific.
