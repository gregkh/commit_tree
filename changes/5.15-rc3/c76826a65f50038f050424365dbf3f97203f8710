perf/x86/intel/uncore: Support IMC free-running counters on Sapphire Rapids server

Several free-running counters for IMC uncore blocks are supported on
Sapphire Rapids server.

They are not enumerated in the discovery tables. The number of the
free-running counter boxes is calculated from the number of
corresponding standard boxes.

The snbep_pci2phy_map_init() is invoked to setup the mapping from a PCI
BUS to a Die ID, which is used to locate the corresponding MC device of
a IMC uncore unit in the spr_uncore_imc_freerunning_init_box().
