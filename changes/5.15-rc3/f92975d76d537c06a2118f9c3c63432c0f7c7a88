tools/memory-model: Heuristics using data_race() must handle all values

Data loaded for use by some sorts of heuristics can tolerate the
occasional erroneous value.  In this case the loads may use data_race()
to give the compiler full freedom to optimize while also informing KCSAN
of the intent.  However, for this to work, the heuristic needs to be
able to tolerate any erroneous value that could possibly arise.  This
commit therefore adds a paragraph spelling this out.
