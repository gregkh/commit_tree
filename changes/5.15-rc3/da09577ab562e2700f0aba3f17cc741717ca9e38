clk: qcom: gcc-sdm660: Replace usage of parent_names

Using parent_data and parent_hws, instead of parent_names, does protect
against some cases of incompletely defined clock trees. While it turns
out that the bug being chased this time was totally unrelated, this
patch converts the SDM660 GCC driver to avoid such issues.

The "xo" fixed_factor clock is unused within the gcc driver, but
referenced from the DSI PHY. So it's left in place until the DSI driver
is updated.
