scsi: sd: Make sd_spinup_disk() less noisy

sd_spinup_disk() is a little bit noisy after commit 848ade90ba9c ("scsi:
sd: Do not exit sd_spinup_disk() quietly"):

scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Multiple Card  Reader     1.00 PQ: 0 ANSI: 0
sd 0:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg0 type 0
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Media removed, stopped polling
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Media removed, stopped polling
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Media removed, stopped polling

There's not really a benefit in printing the same message multiple
times. Therefore print it only if media_present was previously set.
