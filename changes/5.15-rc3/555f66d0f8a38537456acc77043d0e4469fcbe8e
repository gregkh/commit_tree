nvme-fc: update hardware queues before using them

In case the number of hardware queues changes, we need to update the
tagset and the mapping of ctx to hctx first.

If we try to create and connect the I/O queues first, this operation
will fail (target will reject the connect call due to the wrong number
of queues) and hence we bail out of the recreate function. Then we
will to try the very same operation again, thus we don't make any
progress.
