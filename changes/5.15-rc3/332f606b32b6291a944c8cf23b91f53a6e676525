ovl: enable RCU'd ->get_acl()

Overlayfs does not cache ACL's (to avoid double caching).  Instead it just
calls the underlying filesystem's i_op->get_acl(), which will return the
cached value, if possible.

In rcu path walk, however, get_cached_acl_rcu() is employed to get the
value from the cache, which will fail on overlayfs resulting in dropping
out of rcu walk mode.  This can result in a big performance hit in certain
situations.

Fix by calling ->get_acl() with rcu=true in case of ACL_DONT_CACHE (which
indicates pass-through)
