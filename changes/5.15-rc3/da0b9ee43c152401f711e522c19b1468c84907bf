ARM: 9110/1: oabi-compat: fix oabi epoll sparse warning

As my patches change the oabi epoll definition, I received a report
from the kernel test robot about a pre-existing issue with a mismatched
__poll_t type.

The OABI code was correct when it was initially added in linux-2.16,
but a later (also correct) change to the generic __poll_t triggered a
type mismatch warning from sparse.

As __poll_t is always 32-bit bits wide and otherwise compatible, using
this instead of __u32 in the oabi_epoll_event definition is a valid
workaround.
