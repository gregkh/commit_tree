perf evsel: Separate open preparation from open itself

This is a preparatory patch for the following patches with the goal to
separate in evlist__open_cpu the actual perf_event_open, which could be
performed in parallel, from the existing fallback mechanisms, which
should be handled sequentially.

This patch separates the first lines of evsel__open_cpu into a new
__evsel__prepare_open function.
