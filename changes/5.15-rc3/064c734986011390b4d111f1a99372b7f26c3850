ubifs: report correct st_size for encrypted symlinks

The stat() family of syscalls report the wrong size for encrypted
symlinks, which has caused breakage in several userspace programs.

Fix this by calling fscrypt_symlink_getattr() after ubifs_getattr() for
encrypted symlinks.  This function computes the correct size by reading
and decrypting the symlink target (if it's not already cached).

For more details, see the commit which added fscrypt_symlink_getattr().
