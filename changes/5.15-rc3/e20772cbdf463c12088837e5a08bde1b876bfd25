NFSv4/pNFS: Fix a layoutget livelock loop

If NFS_LAYOUT_RETURN_REQUESTED is set, but there is no value set for
the layout plh_return_seq, we can end up in a livelock loop in which
every layout segment retrieved by a new call to layoutget is immediately
invalidated by pnfs_layout_need_return().
To get around this, we should just set plh_return_seq to the current
value of the layout stateid's seqid.
