soundwire: bus: filter out more -EDATA errors on clock stop

We've added quite a few filters to avoid throwing errors if a Device
does not respond to commands during the clock stop sequences, but we
missed one.

This will lead to an isolated message
[ 6115.294412] soundwire sdw-master-1: SDW_SCP_STAT bread failed:-61

The callers already filter this error code, so there's no point in
keeping it at the lower level.

Since this is a recoverable error, make this dev_err() conditional and
only log cases with Command Failed.
