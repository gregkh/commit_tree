hwmon: (axi-fan-control) Handle irqs in natural order

The core will now start out of reset at boot as soon as clocking is
available. Hence, by the time we unmask the interrupts we already might
have some of them set. Thus, it's important to handle them in the
natural order the core generates them. Otherwise, we could process
'ADI_IRQ_SRC_PWM_CHANGED' before 'ADI_IRQ_SRC_TEMP_INCREASE' and
erroneously set 'update_tacho_params' to true.
