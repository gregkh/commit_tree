bonding: pair enable_port with slave_arr_updates

When 803.2ad mode enables a participating port, it should update
the slave-array. I have observed that the member links are participating
and are part of the active aggregator while the traffic is egressing via
only one member link (in a case where two links are participating). Via
kprobes I discovered that slave-arr has only one link added while
the other participating link wasn't part of the slave-arr.

I couldn't see what caused that situation but the simple code-walk
through provided me hints that the enable_port wasn't always associated
with the slave-array update.
