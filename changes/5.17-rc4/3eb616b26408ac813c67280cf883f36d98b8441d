x86/PCI: revert "Ignore E820 reservations for bridge windows on newer systems"

Commit 7f7b4236f204 ("x86/PCI: Ignore E820 reservations for bridge windows
on newer systems") fixes the touchpad not working on laptops like
the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15IIL05 and the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14IIL05, as well as
fixing thunderbolt hotplug issues on the Lenovo Yoga C940.

Unfortunately it turns out that this is causing issues with suspend/resume
on Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 2 laptops. So, per the no regressions
policy, rever this. Note I'm looking into another fix for the issues this
fixed.
