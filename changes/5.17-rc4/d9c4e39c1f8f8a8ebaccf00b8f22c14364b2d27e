NFS: Don't overfill uncached readdir pages

If we're doing an uncached read of the directory, then we ideally want
to read only the exact set of entries that will fit in the buffer
supplied by the getdents() system call. So unlike the case where we're
reading into the page cache, let's send only one READDIR call, before
trying to fill up the buffer.
