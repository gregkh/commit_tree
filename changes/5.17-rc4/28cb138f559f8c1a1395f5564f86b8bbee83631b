vt_ioctl: add array_index_nospec to VT_ACTIVATE

in vt_setactivate an almost identical code path has been patched
with array_index_nospec. In the VT_ACTIVATE path the user input
is from a system call argument instead of a usercopy.
For consistency both code paths should have the same mitigations
applied.
