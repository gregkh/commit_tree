MAINTAINERS: Add entry for fbdev core

Ever since Tomi extracted the core code in 2014 it's been defacto me
maintaining this, with help from others from dri-devel and sometimes
Linus (but those are mostly merge conflicts):

$ git shortlog -ns  drivers/video/fbdev/core/ | head -n5
    35  Daniel Vetter
    23  Linus Torvalds
    10  Hans de Goede
     9  Dave Airlie
     6  Peter Rosin

I think ideally we'd also record that the various firmware fb drivers
(efifb, vesafb, ...) are also maintained in drm-misc because for the
past few years the patches have either been to fix handover issues
with drm drivers, or caused handover issues with drm drivers. So any
other tree just doesn't make sense. But also, there's plenty of
outdated MAINTAINER entries for these with people and git trees that
haven't been active in years, so maybe let's just leave them alone.
And furthermore distros are now adopting simpledrm as the firmware fb
driver, so hopefully the need to care about the fbdev firmware drivers
will go down going forward.

Note that drm-misc is group maintained, I expect that to continue like
we've done before, so no new expectations that patches all go through
my hands. That would be silly. This also means I'm happy to put any
other volunteer's name in the M: line, but otherwise git log says I'm
the one who's stuck with this.
