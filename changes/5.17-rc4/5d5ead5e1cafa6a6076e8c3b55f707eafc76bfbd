serial: 8250_pericom: Revert "Re-enable higher baud rates"

UPF_MAGIC_MULTIPLIER is userspace available bit and can be changed
at any time. There is no sense to rely on it to be always present.

This reverts commit b4ccaf5aa2d795ee7f47a6eeb209f3de981e1929.

Note, that code was not reliably worked before, hence it implies
no functional change.
