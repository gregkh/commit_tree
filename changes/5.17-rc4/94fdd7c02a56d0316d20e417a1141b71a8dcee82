net/smc: use GFP_ATOMIC allocation in smc_pnet_add_eth()

My last patch moved the netdev_tracker_alloc() call to a section
protected by a write_lock().

I should have replaced GFP_KERNEL with GFP_ATOMIC to avoid the infamous:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/sched/mm.h:256
