dpaa2-eth: unregister the netdev before disconnecting from the PHY

The netdev should be unregistered before we are disconnecting from the
MAC/PHY so that the dev_close callback is called and the PHY and the
phylink workqueues are actually stopped before we are disconnecting and
destroying the phylink instance.
