drm/i915: Disable DRRS on IVB/HSW port != A

Currently we allow DRRS on IVB PCH ports, but we're missing a
few programming steps meaning it is guaranteed to not work.
And on HSW DRRS is not supported on anything but port A ever
as only transcoder EDP has the M2/N2 registers (though I'm
not sure if HSW ever has eDP on any other port).

Starting from BDW all transcoders have the dynamically
reprogrammable M/N registers so DRRS could work on any
port.

Stop initializing DRRS on ports where it cannot possibly work.
