display/amd: decrease message verbosity about watermarks table failure

A number of BIOS versions have a problem with the watermarks table not
being configured properly.  This manifests as a very scary looking warning
during resume from s0i3.  This should be harmless in most cases and is well
understood, so decrease the assertion to a clearer warning about the problem.
