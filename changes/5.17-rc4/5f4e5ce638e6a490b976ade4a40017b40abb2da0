perf: Fix list corruption in perf_cgroup_switch()

There's list corruption on cgrp_cpuctx_list. This happens on the
following path:

  perf_cgroup_switch: list_for_each_entry(cgrp_cpuctx_list)
      cpu_ctx_sched_in
         ctx_sched_in
            ctx_pinned_sched_in
              merge_sched_in
                  perf_cgroup_event_disable: remove the event from the list

Use list_for_each_entry_safe() to allow removing an entry during
iteration.
