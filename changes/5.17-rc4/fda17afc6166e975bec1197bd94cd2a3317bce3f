ata: libata-core: Fix ata_dev_config_cpr()

The concurrent positioning ranges log page 47h is a general purpose log
page and not a subpage of the indentify device log. Using
ata_identify_page_supported() to test for concurrent positioning ranges
support is thus wrong. ata_log_supported() must be used.

Furthermore, unlike other advanced ATA features (e.g. NCQ priority),
accesses to the concurrent positioning ranges log page are not gated by
a feature bit from the device IDENTIFY data. Since many older drives
react badly to the READ LOG EXT and/or READ LOG DMA EXT commands isued
to read device log pages, avoid problems with older drives by limiting
the concurrent positioning ranges support detection to drives
implementing at least the ACS-4 ATA standard (major version 11). This
additional condition effectively turns ata_dev_config_cpr() into a nop
for older drives, avoiding problems in the field.
