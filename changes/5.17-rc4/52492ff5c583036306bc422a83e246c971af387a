cifs: call helper functions for marking channels for reconnect

cifs_mark_tcp_ses_conns_for_reconnect helper function is now
meant to be used by any of the threads to mark a channel
(or all the channels) for reconnect.

Replace all such manual changes to tcpStatus to use this
helper function, which takes care that the right channels,
smb sessions and tcons are marked for reconnect.

Also includes one line minor change
