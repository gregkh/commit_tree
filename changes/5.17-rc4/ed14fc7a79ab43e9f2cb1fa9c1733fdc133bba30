net: sparx5: Fix get_stat64 crash in tcpdump

This problem was found with Sparx5 when the tcpdump tool requests the
do_get_stats64 (sparx5_get_stats64) statistic.

The portstats pointer was incorrectly incremented when fetching priority
based statistics.

Fixes: af4b11022e2d (net: sparx5: add ethtool configuration and statistics support)
