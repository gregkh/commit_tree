phy: cadence: Sierra: fix error handling bugs in probe()

There are two bugs in the error handling:
1: If devm_of_phy_provider_register() fails then there was no cleanup.
2: The error handling called of_node_put(child) improperly leading to
   a use after free.  We are only holding the reference inside the loop
   so the last two gotos after the loop lead to a use after free bug.
   Fix this by cleaning up the partial allocations (or partial iterations)
   in the loop before doing the goto.
