PM: s2idle: ACPI: Fix wakeup interrupts handling

After commit e3728b50cd9b ("ACPI: PM: s2idle: Avoid possible race
related to the EC GPE") wakeup interrupts occurring immediately after
the one discarded by acpi_s2idle_wake() may be missed.  Moreover, if
the SCI triggers again immediately after the rearming in
acpi_s2idle_wake(), that wakeup may be missed too.

The problem is that pm_system_irq_wakeup() only calls pm_system_wakeup()
when pm_wakeup_irq is 0, but that's not the case any more after the
interrupt causing acpi_s2idle_wake() to run until pm_wakeup_irq is
cleared by the pm_wakeup_clear() call in s2idle_loop().  However,
there may be wakeup interrupts occurring in that time frame and if
that happens, they will be missed.

To address that issue first move the clearing of pm_wakeup_irq to
the point at which it is known that the interrupt causing
acpi_s2idle_wake() to tun will be discarded, before rearming the SCI
for wakeup.  Moreover, because that only reduces the size of the
time window in which the issue may manifest itself, allow
pm_system_irq_wakeup() to register two second wakeup interrupts in
a row and, when discarding the first one, replace it with the second
one.  [Of course, this assumes that only one wakeup interrupt can be
discarded in one go, but currently that is the case and I am not
aware of any plans to change that.]
