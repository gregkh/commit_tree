misc: fastrpc: avoid double fput() on failed usercopy

If the copy back to userland fails for the FASTRPC_IOCTL_ALLOC_DMA_BUFF
ioctl(), we shouldn't assume that 'buf->dmabuf' is still valid. In fact,
dma_buf_fd() called fd_install() before, i.e. "consumed" one reference,
leaving us with none.

Calling dma_buf_put() will therefore put a reference we no longer own,
leading to a valid file descritor table entry for an already released
'file' object which is a straight use-after-free.

Simply avoid calling dma_buf_put() and rely on the process exit code to
do the necessary cleanup, if needed, i.e. if the file descriptor is
still valid.
