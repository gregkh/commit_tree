net: mscc: ocelot: fix mutex lock error during ethtool stats read

An ongoing workqueue populates the stats buffer. At the same time, a user
might query the statistics. While writing to the buffer is mutex-locked,
reading from the buffer wasn't. This could lead to buggy reads by ethtool.

This patch fixes the former blamed commit, but the bug was introduced in
the latter.
