loop: revert "make autoclear operation asynchronous"

The kernel test robot is reporting that xfstest which does

  umount ext2 on xfs
  umount xfs

sequence started failing, for commit 322c4293ecc58110 ("loop: make
autoclear operation asynchronous") removed a guarantee that fput() of
backing file is processed before lo_release() from close() returns to
user mode.

And syzbot is reporting that deferring destroy_workqueue() from
__loop_clr_fd() to a WQ context did not help [1]. Revert that commit.
