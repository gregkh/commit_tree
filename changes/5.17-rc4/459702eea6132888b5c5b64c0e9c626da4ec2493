usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: Fix host to USB_ROLE_NONE transition

The support the external role switch a variety of situations were
addressed, but the transition from USB_ROLE_HOST to USB_ROLE_NONE
leaves the host up which can cause some error messages when
switching from host to none, to gadget, to none, and then back
to host again.

 xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: Abort failed to stop command ring: -110
 xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
 xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: HC died; cleaning up
 usb 4-1: device not accepting address 6, error -108
 usb usb4-port1: couldn't allocate usb_device

After this happens it will not act as a host again.
Fix this by releasing the host mode when transitioning to USB_ROLE_NONE.
