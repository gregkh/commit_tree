NFSD: Fix NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE's handling of large file sizes

iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, so these NFSv3 procedures must be
careful to deal with incoming client size values that are larger
than s64_max without corrupting the value.

Silently capping the value results in storing a different value
than the client passed in which is unexpected behavior, so remove
the min_t() check in decode_sattr3().

Note that RFC 1813 permits only the WRITE procedure to return
NFS3ERR_FBIG. We believe that NFSv3 reference implementations
also return NFS3ERR_FBIG when ia_size is too large.
