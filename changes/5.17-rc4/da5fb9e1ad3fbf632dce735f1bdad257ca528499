ACPI/IORT: Check node revision for PMCG resources

The original version of the IORT PMCG definition had an oversight
wherein there was no way to describe the second register page for an
implementation using the recommended RELOC_CTRS feature. Although the
spec was fixed, and the final patches merged to ACPICA and Linux written
against the new version, it seems that some old firmware based on the
original revision has survived and turned up in the wild.

Add a check for the original PMCG definition, and avoid filling in the
second memory resource with nonsense if so. Otherwise it is likely that
something horrible will happen when the PMCG driver attempts to probe.
