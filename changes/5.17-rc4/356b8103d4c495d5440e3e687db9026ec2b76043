Revert "gfs2: check context in gfs2_glock_put"

It turns out that the might_sleep() call that commit 660a6126f8c3 adds
is triggering occasional data corruption in testing.  We're not sure
about the root cause yet, but since this commit was added as a debugging
aid only, revert it for now.

This reverts commit 660a6126f8c3208f6df8d552039cda078a8426d1.
