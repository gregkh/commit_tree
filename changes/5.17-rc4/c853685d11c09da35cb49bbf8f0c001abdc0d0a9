usb: core: Unregister device on component_add() failure

Commit 8c67d06f3fd9 ("usb: Link the ports to the connectors they are
attached to") creates a link to the USB Type-C connector for every new
port that is added when possible. If component_add() fails,
usb_hub_create_port_device() prints a warning but does not unregister
the device and does not return errors to the callers.

Syzbot reported a "WARNING in component_del()".

Fix this issue in usb_hub_create_port_device by calling device_unregister()
and returning the errors from component_add().
