Fix regression due to "fs: move binfmt_misc sysctl to its own file"

Commit 3ba442d5331f ("fs: move binfmt_misc sysctl to its own file") did
not go unnoticed, binfmt-support stopped to work on my Debian system
since v5.17-rc2 (did not check with -rc1).

The existance of the /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc is a precondition for
attempting to mount the binfmt_misc fs, which in turn triggers the
autoload of the binfmt_misc module.  Without it, no module is loaded and
no binfmt is available at boot.

Building as built-in or manually loading the module and mounting the fs
works fine, it's therefore only a matter of interaction with user-space.
I could try to improve the Debian systemd configuration but I can't say
anything about the other distributions.

This patch restores a working system right after boot.
