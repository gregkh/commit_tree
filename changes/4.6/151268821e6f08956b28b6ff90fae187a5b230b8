drm/i915: Add extra paranoia to ILK watermark calculations

Our low-level watermark calculation functions don't get called when the
CRTC is disabled or the relevant plane is invisible, so they should
never see a zero htotal or zero bpp.  However add some checks to ensure
this is true so that we don't wind up dividing by zero if we make a
mistake elsewhere in the driver (which the atomic watermark series has
revealed we might be).
