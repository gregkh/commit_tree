ip_tunnel: add support for setting flow label via collect metadata

This patch extends udp_tunnel6_xmit_skb() to pass in the IPv6 flow label
from call sites. Currently, there's no such option and it's always set to
zero when writing ip6_flow_hdr(). Add a label member to ip_tunnel_key, so
that flow-based tunnels via collect metadata frontends can make use of it.
vxlan and geneve will be converted to add flow label support separately.
