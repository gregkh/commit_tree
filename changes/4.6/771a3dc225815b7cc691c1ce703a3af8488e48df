mmc: sdhci: further fix for DMA unmapping in sdhci_post_req()

sdhci_post_req() exists to unmap a previously mapped but already
finished request, while the next request is in progress.  However, the
state of the SDHCI_REQ_USE_DMA flag depends on the last submitted
request.

This means we can end up clearing the flag due to a quirk, which then
means that sdhci_post_req() fails to unmap the DMA buffer, potentially
leading to data corruption.

We can safely ignore the SDHCI_REQ_USE_DMA here, as testing
data->host_cookie is entirely sufficient.
