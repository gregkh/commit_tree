powerpc/powernv: don't enable SRIOV when VF BAR has non 64bit-prefetchable BAR

On PHB3, we enable SRIOV devices by mapping IOV BAR with M64 BARs. If a
SRIOV device's IOV BAR is not 64bit-prefetchable, this is not assigned from
64bit prefetchable window, which means M64 BAR can't work on it.

The reason is PCI bridges support only 2 memory windows and the kernel code
programs bridges in the way that one window is 32bit-nonprefetchable and
the other one is 64bit-prefetchable. So if devices' IOV BAR is 64bit and
non-prefetchable, it will be mapped into 32bit space and therefore M64
cannot be used for it.

This patch makes this explicit and truncate IOV resource in this case to
save MMIO space.
