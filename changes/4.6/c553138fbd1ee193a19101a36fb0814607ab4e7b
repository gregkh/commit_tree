ARM: imx: use endian-safe readl/readw/writel/writew

Instead of __raw_*, define imx_* to *_relaxed and use those.

Using imx_* was requested by Arnd because *_relaxed tends to
indicate that the code was carefully reviewed to not require
any synchronisation and otherwise be safe, which isn't the
case here with the automatic conversion.

The conversion itself was done using the following spatch
(since that automatically adjusts the coding style unlike
a simple search&replace).
