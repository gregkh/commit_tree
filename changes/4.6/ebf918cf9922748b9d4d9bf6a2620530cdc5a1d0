isdn: Use ktime_t instead of 'struct timeval'

'struct timeval' uses 32-bit representation for seconds which will
overflow in year 2038 and beyond. mISDN/clock.c needs to compute and
store elapsed time in intervals of 125 microseconds. This patch replaces
the usage of 'struct timeval' with 64-bit ktime_t which is y2038 safe.
The patch also replaces do_gettimeofday() (wall-clock time) with
ktime_get() (monotonic time) since we only care about elapsed time here.
