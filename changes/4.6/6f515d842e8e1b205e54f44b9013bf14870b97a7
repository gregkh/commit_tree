powerpc: Add the ability to save Altivec without giving it up

This patch adds the ability to be able to save the VEC registers to the
thread struct without giving up (disabling the facility) next time the
process returns to userspace.

This patch builds on a previous optimisation for the FPU registers in the
thread copy path to avoid a possibly pointless reload of VEC state.
