IB/rdmavt: Support creating qps with GFP_NOIO flag

The current code is problematic when the QP creation and ipoib is
used to support NFS and NFS desires to do IO for paging purposes.
In that case, the GFP_KERNEL allocation within create_qp causes
a deadlock in tight memory situations.

This fix adds support to create queue pair with GFP_NOIO flag for
connected mode only to cleanly fail the create queue pair in those
situations.

This was previously fixed in qib but needed to get ported to hfi1.
This patch handles that for both hardwares in the new rdmavt common
layer.
