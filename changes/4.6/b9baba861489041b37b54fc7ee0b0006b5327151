KVM, pkeys: expose CPUID/CR4 to guest

X86_FEATURE_PKU is referred to as "PKU" in the hardware documentation:
CPUID.7.0.ECX[3]:PKU. X86_FEATURE_OSPKE is software support for pkeys,
enumerated with CPUID.7.0.ECX[4]:OSPKE, and it reflects the setting of
CR4.PKE(bit 22).

This patch disables CPUID:PKU without ept, because pkeys is not yet
implemented for shadow paging.
