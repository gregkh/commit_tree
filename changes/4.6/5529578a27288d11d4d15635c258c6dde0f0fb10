locking/atomic, sched: Unexport fetch_or()

This patch functionally reverts:

  5fd7a09cfb8c ("atomic: Export fetch_or()")

During the merge Linus observed that the generic version of fetch_or()
was messy:

  " This makes the ugly "fetch_or()" macro that the scheduler used
    internally a new generic helper, and does a bad job at it. "

  e23604edac2a Merge branch 'timers-nohz-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip

Now that we have introduced atomic_fetch_or(), fetch_or() is only used
by the scheduler in order to deal with thread_info flags which type
can vary across architectures.

Lets confine fetch_or() back to the scheduler so that we encourage
future users to use the more robust and well typed atomic_t version
instead.

While at it, fetch_or() gets robustified, pasting improvements from a
previous patch by Ingo Molnar that avoids needless expression
re-evaluations in the loop.
