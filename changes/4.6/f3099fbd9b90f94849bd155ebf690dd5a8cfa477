scsi: ufs: fix leakage during link off state

Currently when we try to put the link in off/disabled state during
suspend, it seems link is not being kept in low power mode.
This patch fixes the issue by putting the link in hibern8 first
(so device also puts the link in low power mode) and then stop the
host controller.
