ext4: move trans handling and completion deferal out of _ext4_get_block

There is no need to handle starting of a transaction and deferal of DIO
completion in _ext4_get_block() function. We can move this out to get
block functions for direct IO that need it. That way we can add stricter
checks verifying things work as we expect.
