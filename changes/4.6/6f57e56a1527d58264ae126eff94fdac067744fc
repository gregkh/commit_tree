Revert "vsock: Fix blocking ops call in prepare_to_wait"

This reverts commit 5988818008257ca42010d6b43a3e0e48afec9898 ("vsock: Fix
blocking ops call in prepare_to_wait")

The commit reverted with this patch caused us to potentially miss wakeups.
Since the condition is not checked between the prepare_to_wait and the
schedule(), if a wakeup happens after the condition is checked but before
the sleep happens, we will miss it. ( A description of the problem can be
found here: http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-6-sect-2 ).

By reverting the patch, the behaviour is still incorrect (since we
shouldn't sleep between the prepare_to_wait and the schedule) but at least
it will not miss wakeups.

The next patch in the series actually fixes the behaviour.
