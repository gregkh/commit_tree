irq: Privatize irq_common_data::state_use_accessors

irq_common_data::state_use_accessors is not designed for public use.
Therefore make it private so that people who write code accessing it
directly will get blamed by sparse. Also #undef the macro
__irqd_to_state after used in header files, so that the macro can't be
misused.
