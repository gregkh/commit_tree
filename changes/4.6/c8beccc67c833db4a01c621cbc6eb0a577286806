tipc: fix connection abort during subscription cancellation

In 'commit 7fe8097cef5f ("tipc: fix nullpointer bug when subscribing
to events")', we terminate the connection if the subscription
creation fails.
In the same commit, the subscription creation result was based on
the value of subscription pointer (set in the function) instead of
the return code.

Unfortunately, the same function also handles subscription
cancellation request. For a subscription cancellation request,
the subscription pointer cannot be set. Thus the connection is
terminated during cancellation request.

In this commit, we move the subcription cancel check outside
of tipc_subscrp_create(). Hence,
- tipc_subscrp_create() will create a subscripton
- tipc_subscrb_rcv_cb() will subscribe or cancel a subscription.
