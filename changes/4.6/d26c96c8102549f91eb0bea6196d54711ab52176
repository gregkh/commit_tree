vring: Introduce vring_use_dma_api()

This is a kludge, but no one has come up with a a better idea yet.
We'll introduce DMA API support guarded by vring_use_dma_api().
Eventually we may be able to return true on more and more systems,
and hopefully we can get rid of vring_use_dma_api() entirely some
day.
