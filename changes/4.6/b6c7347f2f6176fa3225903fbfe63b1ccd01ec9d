powerpc/eeh: Remove duplicated check in eeh_dump_pe_log()

When eeh_dump_pe_log() is only called by eeh_slot_error_detail(),
we already have the check that the PE isn't in PCI config blocked
state in eeh_slot_error_detail(). So we needn't the duplicated
check in eeh_dump_pe_log().

This removes the duplicated check in eeh_dump_pe_log(). No logical
changes introduced.
