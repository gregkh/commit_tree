hpsa: check for a null phys_disk pointer in ioaccel2 path

An oops can occur when submitting ioaccel2 commands when the phys_disk
pointer is NULL in hpsa_scsi_ioaccel_raid_map.  Happens when there are
configuration changes during I/O operations.

If the phys_disk pointer is NULL, send the command down the RAID path.
