staging: lustre: Correct missing newline

Several error messages are missing newline characters
at the end of the message. Newlines are added where
necessary and other minor corrections; no punctuation
at the end of an error message, add a return code to
the end of error messages, device name at the beginning,
etc.

There are just a couple of places where newlines are
removed and this is only in LDLM_DEBUG_NOLOCK. The definition
of LDLM_DEBUG_NOLOCK already has a newline in it and
resulted in double newlines printed.
