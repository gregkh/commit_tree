[media] davinci_vpfe: Revert "staging: media: davinci_vpfe: remove,unnecessary ret variable"

This reverts commit afa5d19a2b5f ("staging: media: davinci_vpfe: remove
unnecessary ret variable").

This patch is completely bogus and messed up the code big time.

I'm not sure what was intended, but this isn't it.
