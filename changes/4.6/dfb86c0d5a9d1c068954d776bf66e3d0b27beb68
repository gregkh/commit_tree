can: sja1000: of: add compatibility with Technologic Systems version

Technologic Systems provides an IP compatible with the SJA1000,
instantiated in an FPGA. Because of some bus widths issue, access to
registers is made through a "window" that works like this:

    base + 0x0: address to read/write
    base + 0x2: 8-bit register value

This commit adds a new compatible device, "technologic,sja1000", with
read and write functions using the window mechanism.
