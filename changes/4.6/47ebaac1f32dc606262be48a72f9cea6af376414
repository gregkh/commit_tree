cpufreq: governor: Relocate definitions of tuners structures

Move the definitions of struct od_dbs_tuners and struct cs_dbs_tuners
from the common governor header to the ondemand and conservative
governor code, respectively, as they don't need to be in the common
header any more.

No functional changes.
