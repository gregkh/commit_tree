usb: dwc2: host: Reorder things in hcd_queue.c

This no-op change just reorders a few functions in hcd_queue.c in order
to prepare for future changes.  Motivations here:

The functions dwc2_hcd_qh_free() and dwc2_hcd_qh_create() are exported
functions.  They are not called within the file.  That means that they
should be near the bottom so that they can easily call static helpers.

The function dwc2_qh_init() is only called by dwc2_hcd_qh_create() and
should move near the bottom with it.

The only reason that the dwc2_unreserve_timer_fn() timer function (and
its subroutine dwc2_do_unreserve()) were so high in the file was that
they needed to be above dwc2_qh_init().  Now that dwc2_qh_init() has
been moved down it can be moved down a bit.  A later patch will split
the reserve code out of dwc2_schedule_periodic() and the reserve
function should be near the unreserve function.  The reserve function
needs to be below dwc2_find_uframe() since it calls that.
