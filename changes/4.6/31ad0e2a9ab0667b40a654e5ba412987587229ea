clk: s2mps11: allocate only one structure for clock init

The driver allocates three structures, s2mpsxx_clk_init, for
three different clock types (s2mps11, s2mps13 and s2mps14). They
are quite similar but they differ only by the name. Only one of
these structures is used, while the others lie unused in the
memory.

The clock's name, though, is not such a meaningful information
and by assigning the same name to the initial data we can avoid
over allocation. The common name chosen will be s2mps11,
coherently with the device driver name, instead of the clock
device.

Therefore, remove the structures associated to s2mps13 and
s2mps14 and use only the one referred to s2mps11 for all kind of
clocks.
