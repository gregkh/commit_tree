sched: Mark __schedule() stack frame as non-standard

objtool reports the following warnings for __schedule():

  kernel/sched/core.o: warning: objtool:__schedule()+0x3c0: duplicate frame pointer save
  kernel/sched/core.o: warning: objtool:__schedule()+0x3fd: sibling call from callable instruction with changed frame pointer
  kernel/sched/core.o: warning: objtool:__schedule()+0x40a: call without frame pointer save/setup
  kernel/sched/core.o: warning: objtool:__schedule()+0x7fd: frame pointer state mismatch
  kernel/sched/core.o: warning: objtool:__schedule()+0x421: frame pointer state mismatch

Basically it's confused by two unusual attributes of the switch_to()
macro:

1. It saves prev's frame pointer to the old stack and restores next's
   frame pointer from the new stack.

2. For new tasks it jumps directly to ret_from_fork.

Eventually it would probably be a good idea to clean up the
ret_from_fork hack so that new tasks are created with a valid initial
stack, as suggested by Andy:

Then __schedule() could return normally into the new code and objtool
hopefully wouldn't have a problem anymore.

In the meantime, mark its stack frame as non-standard so we can have a
baseline with no objtool warnings.  The marker also serves as a reminder
that this code could be improved a bit.
