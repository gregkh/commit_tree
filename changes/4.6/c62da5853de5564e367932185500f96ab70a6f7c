orangefs: Avoid symlink upcall if target is too long.

Previously the client-core detected this condition by sheer luck!

Since we used strncpy, no NUL byte would be included on the name. The
client-core would call strlen, which would read past the end of its
buffer, but return a number large enough that the client-core would
return ENAMETOOLONG.
