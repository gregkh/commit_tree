PCI/IOV: Rename and export virtfn_{add, remove}

During EEH recovery, hotplug is applied to the devices which don't
have drivers or their drivers don't support EEH. However, the hotplug,
which was implemented based on PCI bus, can't be applied to VF directly.
Instead, we unplug and plug individual PCI devices (VFs).

This renames virtn_{add,remove}() and exports them so they can be used
in PCI hotplug during EEH recovery.
