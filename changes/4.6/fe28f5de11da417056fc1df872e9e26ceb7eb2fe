[media] ati_remote: Put timeouts at the accel array

Instead of having the timeouts hardcoded, and getting only the
accel value from the array, put everything in the same place.

That simplifies the logic.

As a side effect, it also cleans several smatch errors:
	include/linux/jiffies.h:359:41: error: strange non-value function or array
	include/linux/jiffies.h:361:42: error: strange non-value function or array
(one per time_after/time_before line)
