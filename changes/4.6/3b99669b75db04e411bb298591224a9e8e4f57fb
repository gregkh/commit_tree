cpuidle: menu: help gcc generate slightly better code

We know that the avg variable actually ends up holding a 32 bit
quantity, since it's an average of such numbers. It is only a u64
because it is temporarily used to hold the sum. Making it an actual
u32 allows gcc to generate slightly better code, e.g. when computing
the square, it can do a 32x32->64 multiply.
