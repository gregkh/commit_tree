drm/i915: PSR simplify port and link standby checks.

Current code not just block link_standby for non DDI platforms but also
block PSR from work on other ports B/C/D/E.

So, besides change any behaviour let's just fix the mess a bit here and
reuse HSW check to block the other ports and reduce the second if only to
link stadnby request.
