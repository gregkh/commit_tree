powerpc/mm: Split hash page table sizing heuristic into a helper

htab_get_table_size() either retrieve the size of the hash page table (HPT)
from the device tree - if the HPT size is determined by firmware - or
uses a heuristic to determine a good size based on RAM size if the kernel
is responsible for allocating the HPT.

To support a PAPR extension allowing resizing of the HPT, we're going to
want the memory size -> HPT size logic elsewhere, so split it out into a
helper function.
