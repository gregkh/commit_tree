coresight: etm3x: splitting struct etm_drvdata

Splitting "etm_drvdata" in two sections, one for the HW specific
data and another for user configuration.

That way it is easier to manipulate and zero out the configuration
data when more than one concurrent tracing session configuration
is active.

Also taking care of up-lifting all the code affected by this new
arrangement.  No loss or gain of functionality (other than what is
mentioned above) is introduced by this patch.
