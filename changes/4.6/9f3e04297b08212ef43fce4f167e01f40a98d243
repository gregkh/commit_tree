mtd: nand: don't select chip in nand_chip's block_bad op

One of the arguments passed to struct nand_chip's block_bad op is
'getchip', which, if true, is supposed to get and select the nand device,
and later unselect and release the device.

This op is intended to be replaceable by drivers. The drivers shouldn't
be responsible for selecting/unselecting chip. Like other ops, the chip
should already be selected before the block_bad op is called.

Remove the getchip argument from the block_bad op and
nand_block_checkbad. Move the chip selection to nand_block_isbad, since it
is the only caller to nand_block_checkbad which requires chip selection.

Modify nand_block_bad (the default function for the op) such that it
doesn't select the chip.

Remove the getchip argument from the bad_block funcs in cafe_nand,
diskonchip and docg4 drivers.
