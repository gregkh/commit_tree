mmc: dw_mmc: add hw_reset support

This patch implement hw_reset function for DesignWare
MMC controller. By adding this feature, mmc blk can
do some basic recovery.

Set the following resets:
software reset â€“ BMOD[0] for IDMAC only
DMA reset - CTRL[2]
FIFO reset - CTRL[1] bits

Program the CARD_RESET register with a value of 0 for the bit
corresponding to the card number; This programming asserts the
RST_n signal and resets the card. After a minimum of 1 ?s, de-asserts the
RST_n signal and takes the card out of reset. The application can program
a new CMD only after a minimum of 200 us

This implementation can be easily tested by cutting off->On vmmc
while doing data accessing in background to simulate that case.
