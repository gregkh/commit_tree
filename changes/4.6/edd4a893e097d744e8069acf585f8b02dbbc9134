Revert "cpufreq: postfix policy directory with the first CPU in related_cpus"

Revert commit 3510fac45492 (cpufreq: postfix policy directory with the
first CPU in related_cpus).

Earlier, the policy->kobj was added to the kobject core, before ->init()
callback was called for the cpufreq drivers. Which allowed those drivers
to add or remove, driver dependent, sysfs files/directories to the same
kobj from their ->init() and ->exit() callbacks.

That isn't possible anymore after commit 3510fac45492.

Now, there is no other clean alternative that people can adopt.

Its better to revert the earlier commit to allow cpufreq drivers to
create/remove sysfs files from ->init() and ->exit() callbacks.
