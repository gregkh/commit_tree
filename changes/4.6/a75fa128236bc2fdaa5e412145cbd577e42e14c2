pch_phub: return -ENODATA if ROM can't be mapped

The error return err is not initialized for the case when pci_map_rom
fails and no ROM can me mapped.  Fix this by setting ret to -ENODATA;
(this is the same error value that is returned if the ROM data is
successfully mapped but does not match the expected ROM signature.).
