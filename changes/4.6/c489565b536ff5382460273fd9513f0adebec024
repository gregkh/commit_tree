net/smscx5xx: use the device tree for mac address

This takes the MAC address for smsc75xx/smsc95xx USB network devices
from a the device tree. This is required to get a usable persistent
address on the popular beagleboard, whose hardware designers
accidentally forgot that an ethernet device really requires an a
MAC address to be functional.

The Raspberry Pi also ships smsc9514 without a serial EEPROM, stores
the MAC address in ROM accessible via VC4 firmware.

The smsc75xx and smsc95xx drivers are just two copies of the
same code, so better fix both.

Arnd, reworded the message and comments a bit]
