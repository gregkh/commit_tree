tcp: do not enqueue skb with SYN flag

If we remove the SYN flag from the skbs that tcp_fastopen_add_skb()
places in socket receive queue, then we can remove the test that
tcp_recvmsg() has to perform in fast path.

All we have to do is to adjust SEQ in the slow path.

For the moment, we place an unlikely() and output a message
if we find an skb having SYN flag set.
Goal would be to get rid of the test completely.
