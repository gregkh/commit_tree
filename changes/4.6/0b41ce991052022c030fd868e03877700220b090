8250: use callbacks to access UART_DLL/UART_DLM

Some UART HW has a single register combining UART_DLL/UART_DLM
(this was probably forgotten in the change that introduced the
callbacks, commit b32b19b8ffc05cbd3bf91c65e205f6a912ca15d9)

Fixes: b32b19b8ffc0 ("[SERIAL] 8250: set divisor register correctly ...")
