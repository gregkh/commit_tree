Drivers: hv: vmbus: Give control over how the ring access is serialized

On the channel send side, many of the VMBUS
device drivers explicity serialize access to the
outgoing ring buffer. Give more control to the
VMBUS device drivers in terms how to serialize
accesss to the outgoing ring buffer.
The default behavior will be to aquire the
ring lock to preserve the current behavior.
