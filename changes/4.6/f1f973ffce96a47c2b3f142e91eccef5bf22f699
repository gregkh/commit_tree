ocfs2: code clean up for direct io

Clean up ocfs2_file_write_iter & ocfs2_prepare_inode_for_write:
 * remove append dio check: it will be checked in ocfs2_direct_IO()
 * remove file hole check: file hole is supported for now
 * remove inline data check: it will be checked in ocfs2_direct_IO()
 * remove the full_coherence check when append dio: we will get the
   inode_lock in ocfs2_dio_get_block, there is no need to fall back to
   buffer io to ensure the coherence semantics.

Now the drop dio procedure is gone.  :)
