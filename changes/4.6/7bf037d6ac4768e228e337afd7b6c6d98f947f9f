mmc: tegra: Disable UHS-I modes for tegra114

SD card support for Tegra114 started failing after commit a8e326a911d3
("mmc: tegra: implement module external clock change") was merged. This
commit was part of a series to enable UHS-I modes for Tegra. To
workaround this problem for now, disable UHS-I modes for Tegra114 by
separating the soc data structures for Tegra114 and Tegra124 so that
UHS-I is still enabled for Tegra124 but not Tegra114.
