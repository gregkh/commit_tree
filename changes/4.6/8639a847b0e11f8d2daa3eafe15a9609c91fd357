kexec: update VMCOREINFO for compound_order/dtor

makedumpfile refers page.lru.next to get the order of compound pages for
page filtering.

However, now the order is stored in page.compound_order, hence
VMCOREINFO should be updated to export the offset of
page.compound_order.

The fact is, page.compound_order was introduced already in kernel 4.0,
but the offset of it was the same as page.lru.next until kernel 4.3, so
this was not actual problem.

The above can be said also for page.lru.prev and page.compound_dtor,
it's necessary to detect hugetlbfs pages.  Further, the content was
changed from direct address to the ID which means dtor.

The problem is that unnecessary hugepages won't be removed from a dump
file in kernels 4.4.x and later.  This means that extra disk space would
be consumed.  It's a problem, but not critical.
