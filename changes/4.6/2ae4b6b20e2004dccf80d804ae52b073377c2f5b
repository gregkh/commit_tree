firewire: nosy: Replace timeval with timespec64

32 bit systems using 'struct timeval' will break in the year 2038, so
we replace the code appropriately. However, this driver is not broken
in 2038 since we are using only the microseconds portion of the
current time.

This patch replaces timeval with timespec64.
