tools lib traceevent: Split pevent_print_event() into specific functionality functions

Currently there's a single function that is used to display a record's
data in human readable format. That's pevent_print_event().
Unfortunately, this gives little room for adding other output within the
line without updating that function call.

I've decided to split that function into 3 parts.

 pevent_print_event_task() which prints the task comm, pid and the CPU
 pevent_print_event_time() which outputs the record's timestamp
 pevent_print_event_data() which outputs the rest of the event data.

pevent_print_event() now simply calls these three functions.

To save time from doing the search for event from the record's type, I
created a new helper function called pevent_find_event_by_record(),
which returns the record's event, and this event has to be passed to the
above functions.
