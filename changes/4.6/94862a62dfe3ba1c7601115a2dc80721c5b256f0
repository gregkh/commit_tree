Revert "cpufreq: governor: Fix negative idle_time when configured with CONFIG_HZ_PERIODIC"

Revert commit 0df35026c6a5 (cpufreq: governor: Fix negative idle_time
when configured with CONFIG_HZ_PERIODIC) that introduced a regression
by causing the ondemand cpufreq governor to misbehave for
CONFIG_TICK_CPU_ACCOUNTING unset (the frequency goes up to the max at
one point and stays there indefinitely).

The revert takes subsequent modifications of the code in question into
account.
