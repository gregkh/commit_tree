drm/i915: Make sure DC writes are coherent on flush.

We need to set the DC FLUSH PIPE_CONTROL bit on Gen7+ to guarantee
that writes performed via the HDC are visible in memory.  Fixes an
intermittent failure in a Piglit test that writes to a BO from a
shader using GL atomic counters (implemented as HDC untyped atomics)
and then expects the memory to read back the same value after mapping
it on the CPU.
