arm64: dts: salvator-x: enable usb2_phy of channel 1 and 2

This board has a MAX3355 chip. However, we cannot use the extcon/max3355
driver because the ID pin doesn't connect to a gpio pin (in other words,
it connects to the SoC specific pin).
And, the phy-rcar-gen3-usb2 driver cannot handle such a chip for now.
So, this patch enables usb2_phy of channel 1 and 2.
