Orangefs: clean up slab allocation.

A couple of caches were no longer needed:

 - iov_iter improvements to orangefs_devreq_write_iter eliminated
   the need for the dev_req_cache.

 - removal (months ago) of the old AIO code eliminated the need
   for the kiocb_cache.

Also, deobfuscation of use of GFP_KERNEL when calling kmem_cache_(z)alloc
for remaining caches.
