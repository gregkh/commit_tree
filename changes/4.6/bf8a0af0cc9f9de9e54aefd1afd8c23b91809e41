drm/i915/skl: Do not allow scaling when crtc is disabled.

This fixes a warning when the crtc is turned off. In that case fb
will be NULL, and crtc_clock will be 0. Because the crtc is no longer
active this is not a bug, and shouldn't trigger the WARN_ON.

Also remove handling a null crtc_state, with all transitional helpers
gone this can no longer happen.
