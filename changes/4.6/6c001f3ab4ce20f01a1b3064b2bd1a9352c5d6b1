ASoC: rsnd: don't update status if rsnd_mod_call() doesn't match

If system uses CTU/MUX, and if probe error happened, it will try to
call rsnd_dai_call(remove, ...). Then, MUX/DVC/SSIU/SSI might be called
without calling rsnd_dai_call(probe, ...). Then, each mod status might
be un-matched. It doesn't call un-matched remove function by this patch.
