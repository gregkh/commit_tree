drm/rockchip: vop: Disable planes when disabling CRTC

When a VOP is re-enabled, it will start scanning right away the
framebuffers that were configured from the last time, even if those have
been destroyed already.

To prevent the VOP from trying to access freed memory, disable all its
windows when the CRTC is being disabled, then each window will get a
valid framebuffer address before it's enabled again.
