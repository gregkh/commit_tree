MIPS: Fix broken malta qemu

Malta defconfig compiles with GIC on. Hence when compiling for SMP it causes
the new IPI code to be activated. But on qemu malta there's no GIC causing a
BUG_ON(!ipidomain) to be hit in mips_smp_ipi_init().

Since in that configuration one can only run a single core SMP (!), skip IPI
initialisation if we detect that this is the case. It is a sensible
behaviour to introduce and should keep such possible configuration to run
rather than die hard unnecessarily.
