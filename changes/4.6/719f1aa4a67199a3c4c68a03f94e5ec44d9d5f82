ptp: Add PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE for driver crosstimestamping

Currently, network /system cross-timestamping is performed in the
PTP_SYS_OFFSET ioctl. The PTP clock driver reads gettimeofday() and
the gettime64() callback provided by the driver. The cross-timestamp
is best effort where the latency between the capture of system time
(getnstimeofday()) and the device time (driver callback) may be
significant.

The getcrosststamp() callback and corresponding PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE
ioctl allows the driver to perform this device/system correlation when
for example cross timestamp hardware is available. Modern Intel
systems can do this for onboard Ethernet controllers using the ART
counter. There is virtually zero latency between captures of the ART
and network device clock.

The capabilities ioctl (PTP_CLOCK_GETCAPS), is augmented allowing
applications to query whether or not drivers implement the
getcrosststamp callback, providing more precise cross timestamping.
