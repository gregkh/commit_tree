net: Add support for filtering link dump by master device and kind

Add support for filtering link dumps by master device and kind, similar
to the filtering implemented for neighbor dumps.

Each net_device that exists adds between 1196 bytes (eth) and 1556 bytes
(bridge) to the link dump. As the number of interfaces increases so does
the amount of data pushed to user space for a link list. If the user
only wants to see a list of specific devices (e.g., interfaces enslaved
to a specific bridge or a list of VRFs) most of that data is thrown away.
Passing the filters to the kernel to have only relevant data returned
makes the dump more efficient.
