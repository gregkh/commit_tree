hp-wmi: fix unregister order in hp_wmi_rfkill_setup() once again

rfkill registration order in hp_wmi_rfkill_setup() is:
1) WiFi,
2) BT,
3) WWAN,
5) GPS.

Unregistration when cleaning up on error return should happen in reverse
order.

This means that: If BT rfkill fails to be allocated we possibly need to
first unregister WiFi rfkill before destroying it.

The same goes with (WWAN, BT) and (GPS, WWAN) pairs.

Also, if WWAN rfkill fails to register we need to (possibly) unregister BT
not the GPS one.  And if GPS rfkill fails to register we need to unregister
WWAN not the BT one.

We never need to unregister GPS rfkill here since if GPS rfkill
registration succeeds this function returns without error so no cleanup is
necessary.
