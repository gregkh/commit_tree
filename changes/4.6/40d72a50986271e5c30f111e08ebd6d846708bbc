i40e/i40evf: don't lose interrupts

While re-enabling interrupts the driver would clear all pending
causes. This meant that if an interrupt was generated while the driver
was cleaning or polling with interrupts disabled, then that interrupt
was lost.  This could cause a queue to become dead, especially for
receive.  Refactored the enable_icr0 function in order to allow
it to be decided by the caller whether the CLEARPBA (clear pending
events) bit will be set while re-enabling the interrupt.

Also update copyright year in file headers.
