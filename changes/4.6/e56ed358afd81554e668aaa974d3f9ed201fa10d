kernfs: make kernfs_walk_ns() use kernfs_pr_cont_buf[]

kernfs_walk_ns() uses a static path_buf[PATH_MAX] to separate out path
components.  Keeping around the 4k buffer just for kernfs_walk_ns() is
wasteful.  This patch makes it piggyback on kernfs_pr_cont_buf[]
instead.  This requires kernfs_walk_ns() to hold kernfs_rename_lock.
