perf test: Remove 'core_id' check in topo test

The topology test case of 'perf test' seems to be broken on my x86
system - due to the comparison of a "core-id" with # of CPUs online.

There are 8 online CPUs:

	$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
	0-7

but core-ids are not sequential and some core-ids exceed the number
of online CPUs.

	$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu?/topology/core_id
	0
	1
	9
	10
	0
	1
	9
	10

Looks like we can safely remove the check.  Output before:

	$ perf --version
	perf version 4.4.rc1.g34258a

	$ perf test -v topo
	36: Test topology in session                                 :
	--- start ---
	test child forked, pid 5906
	templ file: /tmp/perf-test-vCwWG3
	core_id number is too big.You may need to upgrade the perf tool.
	test child interrupted
	---- end ----
	Test topology in session: FAILED!

and after:

	$ perf test -v topo
	36: Test topology in session                                 :
	--- start ---
	test child forked, pid 6532
	templ file: /tmp/perf-test-y10wFJ
	CPU 0, core 0, socket 0
	CPU 1, core 1, socket 0
	CPU 2, core 9, socket 0
	CPU 3, core 10, socket 0
	CPU 4, core 0, socket 1
	CPU 5, core 1, socket 1
	CPU 6, core 9, socket 1
	CPU 7, core 10, socket 1
	test child finished with 0
	---- end ----
	Test topology in session: Ok
