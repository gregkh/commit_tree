mm: wake kcompactd before kswapd's short sleep

When kswapd goes to sleep it checks if the node is balanced and at first
it sleeps only for HZ/10 time, then rechecks if the node is still
balanced and nobody has woken it during the initial sleep.  Only then it
goes fully sleep until an allocation slowpath wakes it up again.

For higher-order allocations, waking up kcompactd is done only before
the full sleep.  This turns out to be an issue in case another
high-order allocation fails during the initial sleep.  It will wake
kswapd up, however kswapd considers the zone balanced from the order-0
perspective, and will just quickly try to sleep again.  So if there's a
longer stream of high-order allocations hitting the slowpath and waking
up kswapd, it might never actually wake up kcompactd, which may be
considered a regression from kswapd-based compaction.  In the worst
case, it might be that a single allocation that cannot direct
reclaim/compact itself is waking kswapd in the retry loop and preventing
kcompactd from being woken up and unblocking it.

This patch makes sure kcompactd is woken up in such situations by simply
moving the wakeup before the short initial sleep.  More efficient
solution would be to wake kcompactd immediately instead of kswapd if the
node is already order-0 balanced, but in that case we should also move
reset_isolation_suitable() call to kcompactd so it's not adding to the
allocator's latency.  Since it's late in the 4.6 cycle, let's go with
the simpler change for now.
