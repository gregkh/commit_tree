ASoC: nau8825: Fix jack detection across suspend

Jack plug status is rechecked at resume to handle plug/unplug
in S3 when the chip has no power.

Suspend/resume callbacks are moved from the i2c dev_pm_ops to
snd_soc_codec_driver. soc_resume_deferred is a delayed work
which may trigger nau8825_set_bias_level. The bias change races
against dev_pm_ops, causing jack detection issues.
soc_resume_deferred ensures bias change and snd_soc_codec_driver
suspend/resume are sequenced correctly.
