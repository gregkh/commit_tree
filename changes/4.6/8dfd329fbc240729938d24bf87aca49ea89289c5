arp: correct return value of arp_rcv

Currently, arp_rcv() always return zero on a packet delivery upcall.

To make its behavior more compliant with the way this API should be
used, this patch changes this to let it return NET_RX_SUCCESS when the
packet is proper handled, and NET_RX_DROP otherwise.

v1->v2:
If sanity check is failed, call kfree_skb() instead of consume_skb(), then
return the correct return value.
