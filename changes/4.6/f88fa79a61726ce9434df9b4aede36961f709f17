aacraid: Fix memory leak in aac_fib_map_free

aac_fib_map_free() calls pci_free_consistent() without checking that
dev->hw_fib_va is not NULL and dev->max_fib_size is not zero.If they are
indeed NULL/0, this will result in a hang as pci_free_consistent() will
attempt to invalidate cache for the entire 64-bit address space
(which would take a very long time).

Fixed by adding a check to make sure that dev->hw_fib_va and
dev->max_fib_size are not NULL and 0 respectively.

Fixes: 9ad5204d6 - "[SCSI]aacraid: incorrect dma mapping mask during blinked recover or user initiated reset"
