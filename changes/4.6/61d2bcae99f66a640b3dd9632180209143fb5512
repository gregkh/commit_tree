tcp: fastopen: accept data/FIN present in SYNACK message

RFC 7413 (TCP Fast Open) 4.2.2 states that the SYNACK message
MAY include data and/or FIN

This patch adds support for the client side :

If we receive a SYNACK with payload or FIN, queue the skb instead
of ignoring it.

Since we already support the same for SYN, we refactor the existing
code and reuse it. Note we need to clone the skb, so this operation
might fail under memory pressure.

Sara Dickinson pointed out FreeBSD server Fast Open implementation
was planned to generate such SYNACK in the future.

The server side might be implemented on linux later.
