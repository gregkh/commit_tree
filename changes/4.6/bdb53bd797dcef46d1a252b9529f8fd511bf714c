cgroup: factor out cgroup_apply_control_enable() from cgroup_subtree_control_write()

Factor out css enabling and showing into cgroup_apply_control_enable().

* Nest subsystem walk inside child walk.  The child walk will later be
  converted to subtree walk which is a bit more expensive.

* Instead of operating on the differential masks @css_enable, simply
  enable or show csses according to the current cgroup_control() and
  cgroup_ss_mask().  This leads to the same result and is simpler and
  more robust.
