usb: gadget: f_midi: fix in_last_port looping logic

In general case, all of midi->in_port pointers may be non-NULL which
implies that the ‘if (\!port)’ condition will never execute thus never
zeroing midi->in_last_port.  Fix by rewriting the loop such that the
field is set to zero if \!port or end of loop has been reached.
