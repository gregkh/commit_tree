lib/stackdepot: avoid to return 0 handle

Recently, we allow to save the stacktrace whose hashed value is 0.  It
causes the problem that stackdepot could return 0 even if in success.
User of stackdepot cannot distinguish whether it is success or not so we
need to solve this problem.  In this patch, 1 bit are added to handle
and make valid handle none 0 by setting this bit.  After that, valid
handle will not be 0 and 0 handle will represent failure correctly.
