block: partition: initialize percpuref before sending out KOBJ_ADD

The initialization of partition's percpu_ref should have been done before
sending out KOBJ_ADD uevent, which may cause userspace to read partition
table. So the uninitialized percpu_ref may be accessed in data path.

This patch fixes this issue reported by Naveen.
