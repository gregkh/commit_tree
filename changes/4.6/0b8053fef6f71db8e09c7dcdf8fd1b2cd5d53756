serial: ifx6x60: avoid uninitialized variable use

gcc warns about a potential use of an uninitialized variable in this driver:

drivers/tty/serial/ifx6x60.c: In function 'ifx_spi_complete':
drivers/tty/serial/ifx6x60.c:713:6: warning: 'more' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   if (more || ifx_dev->spi_more || queue_length > 0 ||

Unlike a lot of other such warnings, this one is correct and describes
an actual problem in the handling of the "IFX_SPI_HEADER_F" result code.

This appears to be a result from a restructuring of the driver that
dates back to before it was merged in the kernel, so it's impossible
to know where it went wrong. I also don't know what that result code
means, so I have no idea if setting 'more' to zero is the correct
solution, but at least it makes the behavior reproducible rather than
depending on whatever happens to be on the kernel stack.

This patch initializes the 'more' variable to zero in each of the
three code paths that could result in undefined behavior before,
which is more explicit than initializing it at the start of the
function.
