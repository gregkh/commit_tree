ARM: dts: sun8i: sina33: Enable hardware reset and HS-DDR for eMMC

mmc2 has a special pin for eMMC hardware reset, which is controllable
from the controller. Add the "mmc-cap-hw-reset" property to denote that
this controller supports this function, and the pins are actually used.

Also increase the signal drive strength for mmc2 pins, for HS-DDR mode
support.
