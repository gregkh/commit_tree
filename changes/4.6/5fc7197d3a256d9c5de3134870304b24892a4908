net/mlx5: Add pci shutdown callback

This patch introduces kexec support for mlx5.
When switching kernels, kexec() calls shutdown, which unloads
the driver and cleans its resources.

In addition, remove unregister netdev from shutdown flow. This will
allow a clean shutdown, even if some netdev clients did not release their
reference from this netdev. Releasing The HW resources only is enough as
the kernel is shutting down
