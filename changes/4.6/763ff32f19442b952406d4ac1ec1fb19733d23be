toshiba_acpi: Add support for cooling method feature

This patch adds support to query and set the "Cooling Method" feature,
which basically changes how the system fan behaves, depending on the
supported cooling methods.

Depending on the laptop model, these are the (so far...) available
cooling methods:
- Maximum Performance
- Performance
- Battery Optimized
