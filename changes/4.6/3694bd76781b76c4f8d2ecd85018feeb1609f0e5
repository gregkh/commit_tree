asm-generic: Fix local variable shadow in __set_fixmap_offset

Currently __set_fixmap_offset is a macro function which has a local
variable called 'addr'. If a caller passes a 'phys' parameter which is
derived from a variable also called 'addr', the local variable will
shadow this, and the compiler will complain about the use of an
uninitialized variable. To avoid the issue with namespace clashes,
'addr' is prefixed with a liberal sprinkling of underscores.

Turning __set_fixmap_offset into a static inline breaks the build for
several architectures. Fixing this properly requires updates to a number
of architectures to make them agree on the prototype of __set_fixmap (it
could be done as a subsequent patch series).
