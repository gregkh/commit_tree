ALSA: hda - Really restrict i915 notifier to HSW+

The commit [b62232d429fa: ALSA: hda - Limit i915 HDMI binding only for
HSW and later] tried to limit the usage of i915 audio notifier to the
recent Intel models and switch to the old method on pre-Haswell
models.  However, it assumed that the i915 component binding hasn't
been done on such models, and the assumption was wrong: namely,
Baytrail had already the i915 component binding due to powerwell
control.  Thus, the workaround wasn't applied to Baytrail.

For fixing this properly, this patch introduces a new flag indicating
the usage of audio notifier and codec_has_acomp() refers to this flag
instead of checking the existence of audio component.
