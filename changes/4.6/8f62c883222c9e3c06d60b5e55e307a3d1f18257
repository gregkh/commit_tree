x86/mm/pkeys: Add arch-specific VMA protection bits

Lots of things seem to do:

        vma->vm_page_prot = vm_get_page_prot(flags);

and the ptes get created right from things we pull out
of ->vm_page_prot.  So it is very convenient if we can
store the protection key in flags and vm_page_prot, just
like the existing permission bits (_PAGE_RW/PRESENT).  It
greatly reduces the amount of plumbing and arch-specific
hacking we have to do in generic code.

This also takes the new PROT_PKEY{0,1,2,3} flags and
turns *those* in to VM_ flags for vma->vm_flags.

The protection key values are stored in 4 places:
	1. "prot" argument to system calls
	2. vma->vm_flags, filled from the mmap "prot"
	3. vma->vm_page prot, filled from vma->vm_flags
	4. the PTE itself.

The pseudocode for these for steps are as follows:

	mmap(PROT_PKEY*)
	vma->vm_flags 	  = ... | arch_calc_vm_prot_bits(mmap_prot);
	vma->vm_page_prot = ... | arch_vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags);
	pte = pfn | vma->vm_page_prot

Note that this provides a new definitions for x86:

	arch_vm_get_page_prot()
