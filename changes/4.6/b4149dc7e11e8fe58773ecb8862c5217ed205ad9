qed: Print additional HW attention info

This patch utilizes the attention infrastructure to log additional
information that relates only to specific HW blocks.
For some of those HW blocks, it also stops automatically disabling the
attention generation as the attention is considered benign and thus
should only be logged; No fear of it flooding the system.
