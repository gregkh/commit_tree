dts: sun8i-h3: Add APB0 related clocks and resets

APB0 is bearly mentioned in H3 User Manual and it is only setup in the
Allwinners kernel dump for CIR. I have verified experimentally that the
gate for R_PIO exists and works, though. There are probably other gates
there but I don't know their order right now and I don't have access to
their peripherals on my board to test them.

After some experiments and reviewing how this is organized on other
sunxi SoCs, I couldn't actually find any way to disable clocks for R_PIO
and they are working properly without doing anything so I assume they
are connected straight to the 24Mhz oscillator for now.
