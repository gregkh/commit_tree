clk: rockchip: add hclk_cpubus to the list of rk3188 critical clocks

hclk_cpubus needs to keep running because it is needed for devices like
the rom, i2s0 or spdif to be accessible via cpu. Without that all
accesses to devices (readl/writel) return wrong data. So add it
to the list of critical clocks.
