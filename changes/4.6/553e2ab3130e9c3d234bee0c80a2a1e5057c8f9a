stmmac: add length field to dma data

Currently, the code pulls out the length field when
unmapping a buffer directly from the descriptor. This will result
in an uncached read to a dma_alloc_coherent() region. There is no
need to do this, so this patch simply puts the value directly into
a data structure which will hit the cache.
