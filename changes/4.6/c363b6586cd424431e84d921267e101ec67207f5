stmmac: optimize tx clean function

This patch "inline" get_tx_owner and get_ls routines. It Results in a
unique read to tdes0, instead of three, to check TX_OWN and LS bits,
and other status bits.

It helps improve driver TX path by removing two uncached read/writes
inside TX clean loop for enhanced descriptors but not for normal ones
because the des1 must be read in any case.
