[media] media: au0828 change to use Managed Media Controller API

Change au0828 to use Managed Media Controller API to share media device
and coordinate creating/deleting the shared media device with the
snd-usb-audio driver. The shared media device is created as device
resource of the parent usb device of the two drivers.

Populate media device model with USB Device product name instead of
au0828 device board name. This change is necessary because, if the media
device is registered by the snd-usb-audio driver first, and it doesn't
know the au0828 board name.
