drm/msm/hdmi: Fix connector detect when there is no HPD gpio

Some platforms may not have a HPD gpio line to detect Hot Plug signal from
the connector. They need to rely only on reading REG_HDMI_HPD_INT_STATUS
for HPD.

Modify hdmi_connector_detect logic such that it checks for HPD only using
the status register if there is no HPD gpio.
