lib/mpi: Endianness fix

The limbs are integers in the host endianness, so we can't simply
iterate over the individual bytes. The current code happens to work on
little-endian, because the order of the limbs in the MPI array is the
same as the order of the bytes in each limb, but it breaks on
big-endian.
