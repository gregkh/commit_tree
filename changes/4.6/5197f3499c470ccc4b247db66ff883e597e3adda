net: Reset encap_level to avoid resetting features on inner IP headers

This patch corrects an oversight in which we were allowing the encap_level
value to pass from the outer headers to the inner headers.  As a result we
were incorrectly identifying UDP or GRE tunnels as also making use of ipip
or sit when the second header actually represented a tunnel encapsulated in
either a UDP or GRE tunnel which already had the features masked.
