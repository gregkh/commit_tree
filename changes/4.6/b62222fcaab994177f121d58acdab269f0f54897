drm/tilcdc: make frame_done interrupt active at all times

The frame_done interrupt was only being enabled when the vsync
interrupts were being enabled by DRM.  However the frame_done is
used to determine if the LCD controller has successfully completed
the raster_enable, raster_disable commands and the vsync interrupts
are not always enabled during these operations.
