drm/i915: Make LRC (un)pinning work on context and engine

Previously intel_lr_context_(un)pin were operating on requests
which is in conflict with their names.

If we make them take a context and an engine, it makes the names
make more sense and it also makes future fixes possible.

v2: Rebase for default_context/kernel_context change.
