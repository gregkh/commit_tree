usb: dwc2: rockchip: Make the max_transfer_size automatic

Previously we needed to set the max_transfer_size to explicitly be 65535
because the old driver would detect that our hardware could support much
bigger transfers and then would try to do them.  This wouldn't work
since the DMA alignment code couldn't support it.

Later in commit e8f8c14d9da7 ("usb: dwc2: clip max_transfer_size to
65535") upstream added support for clipping this automatically.  Since
that commit it has been OK to just use "-1" (default), but nobody
bothered to change it.

Let's change it to default now for two reasons:
- It's nice to use autodetected params.
- If we can remove the 65535 limit, we can transfer more!
