drivers: net: cpsw: use of_phy_connect() in fixed-link case

If a fixed-link DT subnode is used, the phy_device was looked up so
that a PHY ID string could be constructed and passed to phy_connect().
This is not necessary, as the device_node can be passed directly to
of_phy_connect() instead. This reuses the same codepath as if the
phy-handle DT property was used.
