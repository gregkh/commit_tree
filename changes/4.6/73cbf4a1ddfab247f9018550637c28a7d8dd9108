ipmi/watchdog: use nmi_panic() when kernel panics in NMI handler

Commit 1717f2096b54 ("panic, x86: Fix re-entrance problem due to panic
on NMI") introduced nmi_panic() which prevents concurrent and recursive
execution of panic().  It also saves registers for the crash dump on x86
by later commit 58c5661f2144 ("panic, x86: Allow CPUs to save registers
even if looping in NMI context").

ipmi_watchdog driver can call panic() from NMI handler, so replace it
with nmi_panic().
