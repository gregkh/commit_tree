Make CONFIG_FHANDLE default y

Newer Fedora and OpenSUSE didn't boot with my standard configuration.
It took me some time to figure out why, in fact I had to write a script
to try different config options systematically.

The problem is that something (systemd) in dracut depends on
CONFIG_FHANDLE, which adds open by file handle syscalls.

While it is set in defconfigs it is very easy to miss when updating
older configs because it is not default y.

Make it default y and also depend on EXPERT, as dracut use is likely
widespread.
