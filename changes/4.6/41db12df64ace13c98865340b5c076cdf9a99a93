drm: etnaviv: improve readability of command insertion to ring buffer

Improve the readibility of the function which inserts command buffers
and other maintanence commands into the GPUs ring buffer.  We do this
by splitting the ring buffer reservation in two: one chunk for any
commands that need to be issued prior to the command buffer, and a
separate chunk for commands issued after the buffer.

The result is a much more obvious code flow in this function, and
localisation of the conditional maintanence commands prior to the
command buffer.
