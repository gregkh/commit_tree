scsi_dh_alua: Use workqueue for RTPG

The current ALUA device_handler has two drawbacks:
- We're sending a 'SET TARGET PORT GROUP' command to every LUN,
  disregarding the fact that several LUNs might be in a port group
  and will be automatically switched whenever _any_ LUN within
  that port group receives the command.
- Whenever a LUN is in 'transitioning' mode we cannot block I/O
  to that LUN, instead the controller has to abort the command.
  This leads to increased traffic across the wire and heavy load
  on the controller during switchover.

With this patch the RTPG handling is moved to a per-portgroup
workqueue. This reduces the number of 'REPORT TARGET PORT GROUP'
and 'SET TARGET PORT GROUPS' sent to the controller as we're sending
them now per port group, and not per device as previously.
It also allows us to block I/O to any LUN / port group found to be
in 'transitioning' ALUA mode, as the workqueue item will be requeued
until the controller moves out of transitioning.
