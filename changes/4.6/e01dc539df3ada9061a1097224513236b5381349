drivers/xen: make platform-pci.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

arch/x86/xen/Kconfig:config XEN_PVHVM
arch/x86/xen/Kconfig:   def_bool y

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.

In removing "module" from the init fcn name, we observe a namespace
collision with the probe function, so we use "probe" in the name of
the probe function, and "init" in the registration fcn, as per
standard convention, as suggested by Stefano.
