vxlan: introduce vxlan_hdr

Currently, pointer to the vxlan header is kept in a local variable. It has
to be reloaded whenever the pskb pull operations are performed which usually
happens somewhere deep in called functions.

Create a vxlan_hdr function and use it to reference the vxlan header
instead.
