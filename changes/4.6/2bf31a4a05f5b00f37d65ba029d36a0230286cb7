arm64: avoid dynamic relocations in early boot code

Before implementing KASLR for arm64 by building a self-relocating PIE
executable, we have to ensure that values we use before the relocation
routine is executed are not subject to dynamic relocation themselves.
This applies not only to virtual addresses, but also to values that are
supplied by the linker at build time and relocated using R_AARCH64_ABS64
relocations.

So instead, use assemble time constants, or force the use of static
relocations by folding the constants into the instructions.
