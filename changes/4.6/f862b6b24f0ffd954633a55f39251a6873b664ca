mei: fix possible integer overflow issue

There is a possible integer overflow following by a buffer overflow
when accumulating messages coming from the FW to compose a full payload.
Occurrence of wrap around has to be prevented for next message size
calculation.
For unsigned integer the addition overflow has occurred when the
result is smaller than one of the arguments.
To simplify the fix, the types of buf.size and buf_idx are set to the
same width, namely size_t also to be aligned with the type of length
parameter in file read/write ops.
