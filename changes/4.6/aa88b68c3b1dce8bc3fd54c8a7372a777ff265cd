thp: keep huge zero page pinned until tlb flush

Andrea has found[1] a race condition on MMU-gather based TLB flush vs
split_huge_page() or shrinker which frees huge zero under us (patch 1/2
and 2/2 respectively).

With new THP refcounting, we don't need patch 1/2: mmu_gather keeps the
page pinned until flush is complete and the pin prevents the page from
being split under us.

We still need patch 2/2.  This is simplified version of Andrea's patch.
We don't need fancy encoding.
