timers/nohz: Convert tick dependency mask to atomic_t

The tick dependency mask was intially unsigned long because this is the
type on which clear_bit() operates on and fetch_or() accepts it.

But now that we have atomic_fetch_or(), we can instead use
atomic_andnot() to clear the bit. This consolidates the type of our
tick dependency mask, reduce its size on structures and benefit from
possible architecture optimizations on atomic_t operations.
