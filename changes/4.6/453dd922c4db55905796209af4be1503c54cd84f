Staging: fsl-mc: bus: Drop owner assignment from platform_driver

For platform_driver, we don't need to set .owner field as is set by
platform driver core. The semantic patch used here first checks whether
platform_driver struct was actually used in a call to set the .owner
field.
The coccinelle script that generated the patch can be found here:
