parisc: Fix and enable seccomp filter support

The seccomp filter support requires careful handling of task registers.  This
includes reloading of the return value (%r28) and proper syscall exit if
secure_computing() returned -1.

Additionally we need to sign-extend the syscall number from signed 32bit to
signed 64bit in do_syscall_trace_enter() since the ptrace interface only allows
storing 32bit values in compat mode.
