bnx2x: don't wait for Tx completion on recovery

When driver has hit a parity event, HW can no longer write to host memory.
As a result, Tx completions cannot be written to the host SB memory, and
waiting for Tx completions eventually timeout.
As driver is willing to delay as much as 1-2 seconds per Tx queue for its
draining and this delay is sequential, the time to recover might greatly
lengthen needlessly in case the recovery is done under multi-connection
traffic.
