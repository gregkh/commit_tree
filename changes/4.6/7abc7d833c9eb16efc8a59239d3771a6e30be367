arm64: use local label prefixes for __reg_num symbols

The __reg_num_xNN symbols that are used to implement the msr_s and
mrs_s macros are recorded in the ELF metadata of each object file.
This does not affect the size of the final binary, but it does clutter
the output of tools like readelf, i.e.,

  $ readelf -a vmlinux |grep -c __reg_num_x
  50976

So let's use symbols with the .L prefix, these are strictly local,
and don't end up in the object files.

  $ readelf -a vmlinux |grep -c __reg_num_x
  0
