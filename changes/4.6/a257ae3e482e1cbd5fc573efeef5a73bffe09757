cfq-iosched: Allow sync noidle workloads to preempt each other

The original idea with preemption of sync noidle queues (introduced in
commit 718eee0579b8 "cfq-iosched: fairness for sync no-idle queues") was
that we service all sync noidle queues together, we don't idle on any of
the queues individually and we idle only if there is no sync noidle
queue to be served. This intention also matches the original test:

	if (cfqd->serving_type == SYNC_NOIDLE_WORKLOAD
	   && new_cfqq->service_tree == cfqq->service_tree)
		return true;

However since at that time cfqq->service_tree was not set for idling
queues, this test was unreliable and was replaced in commit e4a229196a7c
"cfq-iosched: fix no-idle preemption logic" by:

	if (cfqd->serving_type == SYNC_NOIDLE_WORKLOAD &&
	    cfqq_type(new_cfqq) == SYNC_NOIDLE_WORKLOAD &&
	    new_cfqq->service_tree->count == 1)
		return true;

That was a reliable test but was actually doing something different -
now we preempt sync noidle queue only if the new queue is the only one
busy in the service tree.

These days cfq queue is kept in service tree even if it is idling and
thus the original check would be safe again. But since we actually check
that cfq queues are in the same cgroup, of the same priority class and
workload type (sync noidle), we know that new_cfqq is fine to preempt
cfqq. So just remove the service tree check.
