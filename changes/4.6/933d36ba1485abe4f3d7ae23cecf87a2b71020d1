staging: lustre: set task state before scheduling in lnet_sock_accept

In the original code change when libcfs_sock_accept() was made
into lnet_sock_accept() a call to set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)
got dropped which was restored. For upstream this is an
optimization of calling init_waitqueue_entry() only if
accept() return -EAGAIN. Also we can remove setting the
task to TASK_RUNNING that is not needed.
