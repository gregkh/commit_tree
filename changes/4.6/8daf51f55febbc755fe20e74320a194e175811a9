powerpc/mm/book3s-64: Expand the real page number field of the Linux PTE

Now that other PTE fields have been moved out of the way, we can
expand the RPN field of the PTE on 64-bit Book 3S systems and align
it with the RPN field in the radix PTE format used by PowerISA v3.0
CPUs in radix mode.  For 64k page size, this means we need to move
the _PAGE_COMBO and _PAGE_4K_PFN bits.
