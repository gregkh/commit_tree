net: thunderx: Don't leak phy device references on -EPROBE_DEFER condition.

It is possible, although unlikely, that probing will find the
phy_device for the first LMAC of a thunder BGX device, but then need
to fail with -EPROBE_DEFER on a subsequent LMAC.  In this case, we
need to call put_device() on each of the phy_devices that were
obtained, but will be unused due to returning -EPROBE_DEFER.

Also, since we can break out of the probing loop early, we need to
explicitly call of_node_put() outside of the loop.
