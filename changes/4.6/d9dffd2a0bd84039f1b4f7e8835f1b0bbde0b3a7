ipmi_si: Avoid a wrong long timeout on transaction done

Under some circumstances, the IPMI state machine could return
a call without delay option but the driver would still do a long
delay because the result wasn't checked.  Instead of calling
the state machine after transaction done, just go back to the
top of the processing to start over.
