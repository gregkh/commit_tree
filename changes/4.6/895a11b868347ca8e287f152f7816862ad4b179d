btrfs: reada: simplify dev->reada_in_flight processing

No need to decrease dev->reada_in_flight in __readahead_hook()'s
internal and reada_extent_put().
reada_extent_put() have no chance to decrease dev->reada_in_flight
in free operation, because reada_extent have additional refcnt when
scheduled to a dev.

We can put inc and dec operation for dev->reada_in_flight to one
place instead to make logic simple and safe, and move useless
reada_extent->scheduled_for to a bool flag instead.
