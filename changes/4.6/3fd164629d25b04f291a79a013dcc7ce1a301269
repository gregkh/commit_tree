ext4: shortcut setting of xattr to the same value

When someone tried to set xattr to the same value (i.e., not changing
anything) we did all the work of removing original xattr, possibly
breaking references to shared xattr block, inserting new xattr, and
merging xattr blocks again. Since this is not so rare operation and it
is relatively cheap for us to detect this case, check for this and
shortcut xattr setting in that case.
