ext4: check if in-inode xattr is corrupted in ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea()

We aren't checking to see if the in-inode extended attribute is
corrupted before we try to expand the inode's extra isize fields.

This can lead to potential crashes caused by the BUG_ON() check in
ext4_xattr_shift_entries().
