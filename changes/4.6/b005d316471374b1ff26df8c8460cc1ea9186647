mlx5: Add arbitrary sg list support

Allocate proper context for arbitrary scatterlist registration
If ib_alloc_mr is called with IB_MR_MAP_ARB_SG, the driver
allocate a private klm list instead of a private page list.
Set the UMR wqe correctly when posting the fast registration.

Also, expose device cap IB_DEVICE_MAP_ARB_SG according to the
device id (until we have a FW bit that correctly exposes it).
