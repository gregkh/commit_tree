ALSA: dice: limit stream to current sampling transfer frequency.

In previous commit, ALSA Dice driver limits PCM substreams at current
sampling transfer frequency and current number of Multi bit linear audio
data channel. Thus, the driver has no need to start AMDTP streams at
the other sampling transfer frequency except for current one. This is due
to Dice interface design.

This commit limits AMDTP stream at current sampling transfer frequency,
according to the design.
