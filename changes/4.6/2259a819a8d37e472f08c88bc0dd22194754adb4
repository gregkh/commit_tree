intel_idle: Setup the timer broadcast only on successful driver load.

This driver sets the broadcast tick quite early on during probe and does
not clean up again in cast of failure.  This patch moves the setup call
after the registration, placing the on_each_cpu() calls within the global
CPU lock region.
