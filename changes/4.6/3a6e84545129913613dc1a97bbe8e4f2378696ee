clk: change sizeof(struct clk *) to sizeof(*core->parents)

Now, the clock parent is not "struct clk *", but "struct clk_core *".
Of course, the size of a pointer is always same, but strictly speaking,
sizeof(struct clk *) should be sizeof(struct clk_core *) here.

This mismatch happened when we split the structure into struct clk
and struct clk_core.  For the potential possibility of future renaming,
sizeof(*core->parents) would be better.
