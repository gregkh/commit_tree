cdc_mbim: apply "NDP to end" quirk to all Huawei devices

We now have a positive report of another Huawei device needing
this quirk: The ME906s-158 (12d1:15c1).  This is an m.2 form
factor modem with no obvious relationship to the E3372 (12d1:157d)
we already have a quirk entry for.  This is reason enough to
believe the quirk might be necessary for any number of current
and future Huawei devices.

Applying the quirk to all Huawei devices, since it is crucial
to any device affected by the firmware bug, while the impact
on non-affected devices is negligible.

The quirk can if necessary be disabled per-device by writing
N to /sys/class/net/<iface>/cdc_ncm/ndp_to_end
