ixgbe: call ndo_stop() instead of dev_close() when running offline selftest

Calling dev_close() causes IFF_UP to be cleared which will remove the
interfaces routes and some addresses. That's probably not what the user
intended when running the offline selftest. Besides this does not happen
if the interface is brought down before the test, so the current
behaviour is inconsistent.
Instead call the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly and avoid
touching IFF_UP at all.
