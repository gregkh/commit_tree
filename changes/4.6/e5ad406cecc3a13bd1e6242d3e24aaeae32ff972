scsi: ufs: increase fDeviceInit query response timeout

fDeviceInit query response time for some devices is too long that
default query request timeout of 100ms may not be enough. Experiments
show that fDeviceInit response sometimes takes 500ms so to be on safer
side this change sets the timeout to 600ms. Without this change, we
might unnecessarily have to retry fDeviceInit query requests multiple
times and each query request timeout prints one error message.
