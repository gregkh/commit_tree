audit: log failed attempts to change audit_pid configuration

Failed attempts to change the audit_pid configuration are not presently
logged.  One case is an attempt to starve an old auditd by starting up
a new auditd when the old one is still alive and active.  The other
case is an attempt to orphan a new auditd when an old auditd shuts
down.

Log both as AUDIT_CONFIG_CHANGE messages with failure result.
