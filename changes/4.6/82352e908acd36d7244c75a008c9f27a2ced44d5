drm/i915: Cache LRC state page in the context

LRC lifetime is well defined so we can cache the page pointing
to the object backing store in the context in order to avoid
walking over the object SG page list from the interrupt context
without the big lock held.

v2: Also cache the mapping. (Chris Wilson)
v3: Unmap on the error path.
v4: No need to cache the page. (Chris Wilson)
v5: No need to dirty the page on unpin. (Chris Wilson)
v6: kmap() cannot fail and use kmap_to_page to simplify unpin.
