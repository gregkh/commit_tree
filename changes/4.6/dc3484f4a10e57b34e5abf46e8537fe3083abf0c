drm/exynos: mic: convert to component framework

MIC is SoC component and important part of kms pipeline on Exynos5433,
so convert it to use component framework like other KMS/CRTC drivers.
MIC driver is already listed on KMS component driver list in Exynos DRM
core, so without this conversion, initialization of Exynos DRM core
fails on Exynos 5433 SoC.
