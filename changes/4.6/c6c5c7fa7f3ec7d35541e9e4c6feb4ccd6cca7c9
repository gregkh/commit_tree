drm/atomic-helper: Remove redundant local var old_crtc_state in disable_outputs

One of the two local variables old_crtc_state is redundantly defined in the
function disable_outputs().  It has only a scope partway through the block
for_each_connector_in_state.  So, let's remove it and use the one which
has the scope within the function disable_outputs().
