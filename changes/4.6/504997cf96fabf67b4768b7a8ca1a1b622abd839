ACPI / sleep: move acpi_processor_sleep to sleep.c

acpi_processor_sleep is neither related nor used by CPUIdle framework.
It's used in system suspend/resume path as a syscore operation. It makes
more sense to move it to acpi/sleep.c where all the S-state transition
(a.k.a. Linux system suspend/hiberate) related code are present.

Also make it depend on CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM_POWER_STATES_SUPPORT so that
it's not compiled on architecture like ARM64 where S-states are not
yet defined in ACPI.
