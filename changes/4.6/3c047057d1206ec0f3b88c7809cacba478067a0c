asm-generic: default BUG_ON(x) to if(x)BUG()

When CONFIG_BUG is disabled, BUG_ON() will only evaluate the condition,
but will not actually stop the current thread. GCC warns about a couple
of BUG_ON() users where this actually leads to further undefined
behavior:

include/linux/ceph/osdmap.h: In function 'ceph_can_shift_osds':
include/linux/ceph/osdmap.h:54:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
fs/ext4/inode.c: In function 'ext4_map_blocks':
fs/ext4/inode.c:548:5: warning: 'retval' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c: In function 'prcmu_config_clkout':
drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c:762:10: warning: 'div_mask' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c:769:13: warning: 'mask' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c:757:7: warning: 'bits' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c: In function 'univ8250_release_irq':
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:252:18: warning: 'i' may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:235:19: note: 'i' was declared here

There is an obvious conflict of interest here: on the one hand, someone
who disables CONFIG_BUG() will want the kernel to be as small as possible
and doesn't care about printing error messages to a console that nobody
looks at. On the other hand, running into a BUG_ON() condition means that
something has gone wrong, and we probably want to also stop doing things
that might cause data corruption.

This patch picks the second choice, and changes the NOP to BUG(), which
normally stops the execution of the current thread in some form (endless
loop or a trap). This follows the logic we applied in a4b5d580e078 ("bug:
Make BUG() always stop the machine").

For ARM multi_v7_defconfig, the size slightly increases:

section		CONFIG_BUG=y	CONFIG_BUG=n	CONFIG_BUG=n+patch

  .text            8320248   |     8180944   |     8207688
  .rodata          3633720   |     3567144   |     3570648
  __bug_table        32508   |         ---   |         ---
  __modver             692   |        1584   |        2176
  .init.text        558132   |      548300   |      550088
  .exit.text         12380   |       12256   |       12380
  .data            1016672   |     1016064   |     1016128
  Total           14622556   |    14374510   |    14407326

So instead of saving 1.70% of the total image size, we only save 1.48%
by turning off CONFIG_BUG, but in return we can ensure that we don't run
into cases of uninitialized variable or return code uses when something
bad happens. Aside from that, we significantly reduce the number of
warnings in randconfig builds, which makes it easier to fix the warnings
about other problems.
