i40e: add VEB stat control and remove L2 cloud filter

With the latest firmware, statistics gathering can now be enabled and
disabled in the HW switch, so we need to add a parameter to allow the
driver to set it as desired.  At the same time, the L2 cloud filtering
parameter has been removed as it was never used.

Older drivers working with the newer firmware and newer drivers working
with older firmware will not run into problems with these bits as the
defaults are reasonable and there is no overlap in the bit definitions.
Also, newer drivers will be forced to update because of the change in
function call parameters, a reminder that the functionality exists.

Also update copyright year.
