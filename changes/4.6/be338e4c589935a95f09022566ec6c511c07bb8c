clk: sunxi: add bus gates for A83T

A83T has similar bus gates that of H3, including single gating register has
different clock parent.

As per H3 and A83T datasheet, usbhost is under AHB2.

However,below shows allwinner source code assignment:
bits: 26 (ehci0), 27 (ehci1), 29 (ohci0) => AHB1 for A83T.
bits: 26 (ehci0), 27 (ehci1) => AHB1 for H3
bits  29, 30, 31(ohci0,1,2) => AHB2 for H3.

until, this confusion is cleared keep it H3 way.
