mmc: tegra: properly disable card clock

The new code to do the clock rate setting externally to the SDMMC
module has a shortcut to not propagate changes with a 0 rate to
the CAR by simply bailing out. This breaks proper cutting of the
card clock. Fix it by directly calling the correct sdhci function.
