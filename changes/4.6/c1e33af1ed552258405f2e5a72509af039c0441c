pty: Remove pty_unix98_shutdown()

The tty core invokes the optional driver shutdown() just before
the optional driver remove() (shutdown() has access to the termios
and remove() does not). Because pty drivers must prevent the default
remove() action, the Unix98 pty drivers define a dummy remove() function.

Instead, release the slave index in the remove() method and delete the
optional shutdown() method.
