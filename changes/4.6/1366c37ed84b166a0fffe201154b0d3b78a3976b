radix tree test harness

This code is mostly from Andrew Morton and Nick Piggin; tarball downloaded
from http://ozlabs.org/~akpm/rtth.tar.gz with sha1sum

Some small modifications were necessary to the test harness to fix the
build with the current Linux source code.

I also made minor modifications to automatically test the radix-tree.c
and radix-tree.h files that are in the current source tree, as opposed
to a copied and slightly modified version.  I am sure more could be done
to tidy up the harness, as well as adding more tests.
