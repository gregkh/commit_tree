nvme/host: reference the fabric module for each bdev open callout

We don't want to be able to unload the fabric driver when we have
openened referenced to our namespaces. Thus, for each nvme_open we
take a reference on the fabric driver and put it in nvme_release.
This behavior is consistent with the scsi model.

This resolves the panic when unloading a fabric module with
mpath holders.
