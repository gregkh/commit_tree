KVM: s390: step the VCPU timer while in enabled wait

The cpu timer is a mean to measure task execution time. We want
to account everything for a VCPU for which it is responsible. Therefore,
if the VCPU wants to sleep, it shall be accounted for it.

We can easily get this done by not disabling cpu timer accounting when
scheduled out while sleeping because of enabled wait.
