[media] media: v4l: Dual license v4l2-common.h under GPL v2 and BSD licenses

The v4l2-common.h user space header was split off from videodev2.h, but
the dual licensing of the videodev2.h (as well as other V4L2 headers) was
missed. Change the license of the v4l2-common.h from GNU GPL v2 to both
GNU GPL v2 and BSD.
