i2c: qup: Transfer each i2c_msg in i2c_msgs without a stop bit

The definition of i2c_msg says that

"If this is the last message in a group, it is followed by a STOP.
Otherwise it is followed by the next @i2c_msg transaction segment,
beginning with a (repeated) START"

So the expectation is that there is no 'STOP' bit inbetween individual
i2c_msg segments with repeated 'START'. Adding the support for the same.

This is required for some clients like touchscreen which keeps
incrementing counts across individual transfers and 'STOP' bit inbetween
resets the counter, which is not required.

This patch adds the support in non-dma mode.
