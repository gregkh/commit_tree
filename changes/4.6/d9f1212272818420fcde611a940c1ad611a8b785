spi: core: add spi_split_transfers_maxsize

Add spi_split_transfers_maxsize method that splits
spi_transfers transparently into multiple transfers
that are below the given max-size.

This makes use of the spi_res framework via
spi_replace_transfers to allocate/free the extra
transfers as well as reverting back the changes applied
while processing the spi_message.
