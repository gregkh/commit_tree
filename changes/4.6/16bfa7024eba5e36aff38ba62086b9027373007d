net: dsa: make port_bridge_leave return void

netdev_upper_dev_unlink() which notifies NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER, returns
void, as well as del_nbp(). So there's no advantage to catch an eventual
error from the port_bridge_leave routine at the DSA level.

Make this routine void for the DSA layer and its existing drivers.
