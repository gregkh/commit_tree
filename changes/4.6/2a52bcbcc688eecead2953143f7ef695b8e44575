rmap: extend try_to_unmap() to be usable by split_huge_page()

Add support for two ttu_flags:

  - TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD would split PMD if it's there, before trying to
    unmap page;

  - TTU_RMAP_LOCKED indicates that caller holds relevant rmap lock;

Also, change rwc->done to !page_mapcount() instead of !page_mapped().
try_to_unmap() works on pte level, so we are really interested in the
mappedness of this small page rather than of the compound page it's a
part of.
