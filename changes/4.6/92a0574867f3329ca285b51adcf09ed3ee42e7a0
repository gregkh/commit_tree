serial: sh-sci: Add support for SCIFA/SCIFB variable sampling rates

Add support for sparse variable sampling rates on SCIFA and SCIFB.
According to the datasheet, sampling rate 1/5 needs a small quirk to
avoid corrupting the first byte received.

This increases the range and accuracy of supported baud rates.
E.g. on r8a7791/koelsch:
  - Supports now 134, 150, and standard 500000-4000000 bps,
  - Perfect match for 134, 150, 500000, 1000000, 2000000, and 4000000
    bps,
  - Accuracy has increased for most standard bps values.
