intel_pstate: Update frequencies of policy->cpus only from ->set_policy()

The intel-pstate driver is using intel_pstate_hwp_set() from two
separate paths, i.e. ->set_policy() callback and sysfs update path for
the files present in /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/ directory.

While an update to the sysfs path applies to all the CPUs being managed
by the driver (which essentially means all the online CPUs), the update
via the ->set_policy() callback applies to a smaller group of CPUs
managed by the policy for which ->set_policy() is called.

And so, intel_pstate_hwp_set() should update frequencies of only the
CPUs that are part of policy->cpus mask, while it is called from
->set_policy() callback.

In order to do that, add a parameter (cpumask) to intel_pstate_hwp_set()
and apply the frequency changes only to the concerned CPUs.

For ->set_policy() path, we are only concerned about policy->cpus, and
so policy->rwsem lock taken by the core prior to calling ->set_policy()
is enough to take care of any races. The larger lock acquired by
get_online_cpus() is required only for the updates to sysfs files.

Add another routine, intel_pstate_hwp_set_online_cpus(), and call it
from the sysfs update paths.

This also fixes a lockdep reported recently, where policy->rwsem and
get_online_cpus() could have been acquired in any order causing an ABBA
deadlock. The sequence of events leading to that was:

intel_pstate_init(...)
	...cpufreq_online(...)
		down_write(&policy->rwsem); // Locks policy->rwsem
		...
		cpufreq_init_policy(policy);
			...intel_pstate_hwp_set();
				get_online_cpus(); // Temporarily locks cpu_hotplug.lock
		...
		up_write(&policy->rwsem);

pm_suspend(...)
	...disable_nonboot_cpus()
		_cpu_down()
			cpu_hotplug_begin(); // Locks cpu_hotplug.lock
			__cpu_notify(CPU_DOWN_PREPARE, ...);
				...cpufreq_offline_prepare();
					down_write(&policy->rwsem); // Locks policy->rwsem
