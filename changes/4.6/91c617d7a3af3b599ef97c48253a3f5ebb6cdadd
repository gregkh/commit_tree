ARM: 8536/1: mm: hide __start_rodata_section_aligned for non-debug builds

The __start_rodata_section_aligned is only referenced by the
DEBUG_RODATA code, which is only used when the MMU is enabled,
but the definition fails on !MMU builds:

arch/arm/kernel/vmlinux.lds:702: undefined symbol `SECTION_SHIFT' referenced in expression

This hides the symbol whenever DEBUG_RODATA is disabled.
