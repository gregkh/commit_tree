net: mvneta: fix changing MTU when using per-cpu processing

After enabling per-cpu processing it appeared that under heavy load
changing MTU can result in blocking all port's interrupts and
transmitting data is not possible after the change.

This commit fixes above issue by disabling percpu interrupts for the
time, when TXQs and RXQs are reconfigured.
