net: rework setup_tc ndo op to consume general tc operand

This patch updates setup_tc so we can pass additional parameters into
the ndo op in a generic way. To do this we provide structured union
and type flag.

This lets each classifier and qdisc provide its own set of attributes
without having to add new ndo ops or grow the signature of the
callback.
