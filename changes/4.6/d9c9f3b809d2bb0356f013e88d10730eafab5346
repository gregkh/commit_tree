Revert "soc: mediatek: SCPSYS: Fix double enabling of regulators"

This reverts commit cc8ed76938b5cf6a54ab3d60edabaf808dc960d1
("soc: mediatek: SCPSYS: Fix double enabling of regulators") [1].

This patch fixes mt8173-evb failing boot issue. With commit [1],
genpd state will not sync to real power domain state. So some
resources such as clocks and regulators may stay in a wrong state.

There is no regulator double enabling issue on mainline kernel, so
we can refert commit [1] safely.
