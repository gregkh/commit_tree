stmmac: review RX/TX ring management

This patch is to rework the ring management now optimized.
The indexes into the ring buffer are always incremented, and
the entry is accessed via doing a modulo to find the "real"
position in the ring.
It is inefficient, modulo is an expensive operation.

The formula [(entry + 1) & (size - 1)] is now adopted on
a ring that is power-of-2 in size.
Then, the number of elements cannot be set by command line but
it is fixed.
