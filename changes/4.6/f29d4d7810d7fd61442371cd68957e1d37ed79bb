KVM: page track: introduce kvm_slot_page_track_{add,remove}_page

These two functions are the user APIs:
- kvm_slot_page_track_add_page(): add the page to the tracking pool
  after that later specified access on that page will be tracked

- kvm_slot_page_track_remove_page(): remove the page from the tracking
  pool, the specified access on the page is not tracked after the last
  user is gone

Both of these are called under the protection both of mmu-lock and
kvm->srcu or kvm->slots_lock
