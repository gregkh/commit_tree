inet: refactor inet[6]_lookup functions to take skb

This is a preliminary step to allow fast socket lookup of SO_REUSEPORT
groups.  Doing so with a BPF filter will require access to the
skb in question.  This change plumbs the skb (and offset to payload
data) through the call stack to the listening socket lookup
implementations where it will be used in a following patch.
