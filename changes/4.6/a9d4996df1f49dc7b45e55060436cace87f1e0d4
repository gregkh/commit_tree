powerpc/mm/book3s-64: Move HPTE-related bits in PTE to upper end

This moves the _PAGE_HASHPTE, _PAGE_F_GIX and _PAGE_F_SECOND fields in
the Linux PTE on 64-bit Book 3S systems to the most significant byte.
Of the 5 bits, one is a software-use bit and the other four are
reserved bit positions in the PowerISA v3.0 radix PTE format.
Using these bits is OK because these bits are all to do with tracking
the HPTE(s) associated with the Linux PTE, and therefore won't be
needed in radix mode.  This frees up bit positions in the lower two
bytes.
