MIPS: dts: qca: ar9132_tl_wr1043nd_v1.dts: use "ref" for reference clock name

Current ath79 clock.c code does not read reference clock and
pll setup from devicetree. The ar724x_clocks_init() function
recreates the clocks from scratch so devicetree clock
information is dropped. After adding the code which picked up
reference clock from devicetree I have found
that kernel does not boot anymore. The SPI and UART drivers
can't get clk; here are the bootlog error messages:

    of_serial: probe of 18020000.uart failed with error -22
    ath79-spi: probe of 1f000000.spi failed with error -22

The problem is that clock code assumes that reference clock
name is "ref" but current dts-file uses another name: "oscillator".

This patch fixes the problem by changing external oscillator
dt node name to "ref".

Please note that there is an alternative solution for the problem:
