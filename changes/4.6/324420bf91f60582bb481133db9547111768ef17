arm64: add support for ioremap() block mappings

This wires up the existing generic huge-vmap feature, which allows
ioremap() to use PMD or PUD sized block mappings. It also adds support
to the unmap path for dealing with block mappings, which will allow us
to unmap the __init region using unmap_kernel_range() in a subsequent
patch.
