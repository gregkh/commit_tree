libceph: monc ping rate is 10s

Split ping interval and ping timeout: ping interval is 10s; keepalive
timeout is 30s.

Make monc_ping_timeout a constant while at it - it's not actually
exported as a mount option (and the rest of tick-related settings won't
be either), so it's got no place in ceph_options.
