KVM, pkeys: introduce pkru_mask to cache conditions

PKEYS defines a new status bit in the PFEC. PFEC.PK (bit 5), if some
conditions is true, the fault is considered as a PKU violation.
pkru_mask indicates if we need to check PKRU.ADi and PKRU.WDi, and
does cache some conditions for permission_fault.
