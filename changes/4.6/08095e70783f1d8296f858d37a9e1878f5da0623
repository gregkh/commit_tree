NVMe: Create discard zero quirk white list

The NVMe specification does not require discarded blocks return zeroes on
read, but provides that behavior as a possibility. Some applications more
efficiently use an SSD if reads on discarded blocks were deterministically
zero, based on the "discard_zeroes_data" queue attribute.

There is no specification defined way to determine device behavior on
discarded blocks, so the driver always left the queue setting disabled. We
can only know behavior based on individual device models, so this patch
adds a flag to the NVMe "quirk" list that vendors may set if they know
their controller works that way. The patch also sets the new flag for one
such known device.
