net: sched: do not requeue a NULL skb

A failure in validate_xmit_skb_list() triggered an unconditional call
to dev_requeue_skb with skb=NULL. This slowly grows the queue
discipline's qlen count until all traffic through the queue stops.

We take the optimistic approach and continue running the queue after a
failure since it is unknown if later packets also will fail in the
validate path.
