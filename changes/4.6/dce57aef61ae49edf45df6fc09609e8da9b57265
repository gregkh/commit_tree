staging: most: hdm-usb: Use macro DIV_ROUND_UP

The macro DIV_ROUND_UP performs the computation (((n) + (d) - 1) /(d)).
It clarifies the divisor calculations. This occurence was detected using the
coccinelle script:
@@
expression e1;
expression e2;
@@
(
- ((e1) + e2 - 1) / (e2)
+ DIV_ROUND_UP(e1,e2)
|
- ((e1) + (e2 - 1))/ (e2)
+ DIV_ROUND_UP(e1,e2)
)

The macro CEILING was dropped altogether and has been replaced with
DIV_ROUND_UP.
