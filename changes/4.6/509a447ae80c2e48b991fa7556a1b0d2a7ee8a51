i40evf: enable bus master after reset

If the VF is reset via VFLR, the device will be knocked out of bus
master mode, and the driver will fail to recover from the reset. Fix
this by enabling bus mastering after every reset. In a non-VFLR case,
the bus master bit will not be disabled, and this call will have no effect.
