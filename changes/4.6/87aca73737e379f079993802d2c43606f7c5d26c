NFC: microread: Drop platform data header file

Originally I only wanted to drop the unneeded inclusion of
<linux/i2c.h>, but then noticed that struct
microread_nfc_platform_data isn't actually used, and
MICROREAD_DRIVER_NAME is redefined in the only file where it is used,
so we can get rid of the header file and dead code altogether.
