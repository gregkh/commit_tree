cpu/hotplug: Plug death reporting race

Paul noticed that the conversion of the death reporting introduced a race
where the outgoing cpu might be delayed after waking the controll processor,
so it might not be able to call rcu_report_dead() before being physically
removed, leading to RCU stalls.

We cant call complete after rcu_report_dead(), so instead of going back to
busy polling, simply issue a function call to do the completion.
