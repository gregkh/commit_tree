iwlwifi: support tracing wide commands

Current iwlwifi_trace_dev_rx prints only the cmd without the
group, which might be misleading. Change it to print the wide
id. While at it add the DATA_PATH group and sub commands to the
trace of the command names, sine it is missing due to patches
submitted in parallel.
