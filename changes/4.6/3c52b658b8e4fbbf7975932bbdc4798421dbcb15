perf bench numa: Fix assertion for nodes bitfield

Comparing bits and bytes in numa benchmark assertion

I hit the issue on two socket Power8 machine presenting its numa nodes
as 0,1,16,17 (according to numactl). Therefore I got error (and hang of
parent process):

    perf: bench/numa.c:296: bind_to_memnode: Assertion `!(g->p.nr_nodes > (int)sizeof(nodemask))' failed.

This is obviously false positive. We can fit all the 18 nodes into
bitfield of 8 bytes (long on 64b architecture).
