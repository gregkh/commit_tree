vxlan: Add checksum check to the features check function

We need to perform an additional check on the inner headers to determine if
we can offload the checksum for them.  Previously this check didn't occur
so we would generate an invalid frame in the case of an IPv6 header
encapsulated inside of an IPv4 tunnel.  To fix this I added a secondary
check to vxlan_features_check so that we can verify that we can offload the
inner checksum.
