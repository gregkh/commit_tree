s390/dumpstack: merge all four stack tracers

We have four different stack tracers of which three had bugs. So it's
time to merge them to a single stack tracer which allows to specify a
call back function which will be called for each step.

This patch changes behavior a bit:

- the "nosched" and "in_sched_functions" check within
  save_stack_trace_tsk did work only for the last stack frame within a
  context. Now it considers the check for each stack frame like it
  should.

- both the oprofile variant and the perf_events variant did save a
  return address twice if a zero back chain was detected, which
  indicates an interrupt frame. The new dump_trace function will call
  the oprofile and perf_events backends with the psw address that is
  contained within the corresponding pt_regs structure instead.

- the original show_trace and save_context_stack functions did already
  use the psw address of the pt_regs structure if a zero back chain
  was detected. However now we ignore the psw address if it is a user
  space address. After all we trace the kernel stack and not the user
  space stack. This way we also get rid of the garbage user space
  address in case of warnings and / or panic call traces.

So this should make life easier since now there is only one stack
tracer left which we can break.
