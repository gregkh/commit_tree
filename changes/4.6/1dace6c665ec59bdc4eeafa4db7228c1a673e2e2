powerpc/mm: Clean up memory hotplug failure paths

This makes a number of cleanups to handling of mapping failures during
memory hotplug on Power:

For errors creating the linear mapping for the hot-added region:
  * This is now reported with EFAULT which is more appropriate than the
    previous EINVAL (the failure is unlikely to be related to the
    function's parameters)
  * An error in this path now prints a warning message, rather than just
    silently failing to add the extra memory.
  * Previously a failure here could result in the region being partially
    mapped.  We now clean up any partial mapping before failing.

For errors creating the vmemmap for the hot-added region:
   * This is now reported with EFAULT instead of causing a BUG() - this
     could happen for external reason (e.g. full hash table) so it's better
     to handle this non-fatally
   * An error message is also printed, so the failure won't be silent
   * As above a failure could cause a partially mapped region, we now
     clean this up. [mpe: move htab_remove_mapping() out of #ifdef
     CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG to enable this]
