sched: Account rr tasks

In order to evaluate the scheduler tick dependency without probing
context switches, we need to know how much SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO tasks
are enqueued as those policies don't have the same preemption
requirements.

To prepare for that, let's account SCHED_RR tasks, we'll be able to
deduce SCHED_FIFO tasks as well from it and the total RT tasks in the
runqueue.
