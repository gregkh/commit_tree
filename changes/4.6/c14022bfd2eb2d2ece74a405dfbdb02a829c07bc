HID: usbhid: enable NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk for Semico USB Keykoard2

The device which identifies itself as a "USB Keykoard" (no typo)
with VID:PID 1a2c:0027 does not seem to be handling the reports
initialization very well.

This results in a "usb_submit_urb(ctrl) failed: -1" message from the
kernel when connected, and a delay before its initialization. It can
also cause the hang the system.

This patch adds the  quirk for this device, which causes the delay
to disappear. It is named as "USB Keykoard2" because the "USB Keykoard"
already exists.
