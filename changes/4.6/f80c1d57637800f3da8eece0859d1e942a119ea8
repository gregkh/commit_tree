Staging: rtl8192u: Replace memset with eth_broadcast_addr

Use eth_broadcast_addr to assign the broadcast address to the given
address array instead of memset when the second argument is a broacast
address 0xff. ETH_ALEN is a macro with value 6, so 6 is treated as
ETH_ALEN if it is the third argument of memset.

Done using coccinelle.

+ eth_broadcast_addr(e);
