gpio: ath79: Move to the generic GPIO driver

Drop most of the code in favor of the generic MMIO GPIO driver.
As the driver now depend on CONFIG_GPIO_GENERIC also add a Kconfig
entry to make the driver optional.

We leave the base pointer and lock in the data struct because they are
needed for the IRQ support.
