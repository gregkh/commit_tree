powerpc/eeh: Don't propagate error to guest

When EEH error happened to the parent PE of those PEs that have
been passed through to guest, the error is propagated to guest
domain and the VFIO driver's error handlers are called. It's not
correct as the error in the host domain shouldn't be propagated
to guests and affect them.

This adds one more limitation when calling EEH error handlers.
If the PE has been passed through to guest, the error handlers
won't be called.
