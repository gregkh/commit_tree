parisc: Unbreak handling exceptions from kernel modules

Handling exceptions from modules never worked on parisc.
It was just masked by the fact that exceptions from modules
don't happen during normal use.

When a module triggers an exception in get_user() we need to load the
main kernel dp value before accessing the exception_data structure, and
afterwards restore the original dp value of the module on exit.
