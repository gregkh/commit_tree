ovl: Warn on copy up if a process has a R/O fd open to the lower file

Print a warning when overlayfs copies up a file if the process that
triggered the copy up has a R/O fd open to the lower file being copied up.

This can help catch applications that do things like the following:

	fd1 = open("foo", O_RDONLY);
	fd2 = open("foo", O_RDWR);

where they expect fd1 and fd2 to refer to the same file - which will no
longer be the case post-copy up.

With this patch, the following commands:

	bash 5</mnt/a/foo128
	6<>/mnt/a/foo128

assuming /mnt/a/foo128 to be an un-copied up file on an overlay will
produce the following warning in the kernel log:

	overlayfs: Copying up foo129, but open R/O on fd 5 which will cease
	to be coherent [pid=3818 bash]

This is enabled by setting:

	/sys/module/overlay/parameters/check_copy_up

to 1.

The warnings are ratelimited and are also limited to one warning per file -
assuming the copy up completes in each case.
