drivers/hwtracing: make coresight-etm-perf.c explicitly non-modular

In commit 941943cf519f7cacbbcecee5c4ef4b77b466bd5c ("drivers/hwtracing:
make coresight-* explicitly non-modular") we removed all uses of
modular functions/macros in favour of their built-in equivlents in
this subsystem.

However that commit and commit 0bcbf2e30ff2271b54f54c8697a185f7d86ec6e4
("coresight: etm-perf: new PMU driver for ETM tracers") were in flight
at the same time, and hence one new non-modular user of module_init
crept back in.  Fix it up like we did all the others.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.
