svcrdma: Make RDMA_ERROR messages work

Fix several issues with svc_rdma_send_error():

 - Post a receive buffer to replace the one that was consumed by
   the incoming request
 - Posting a send should use DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE
 - No need to put_page _and_ free pages in svc_rdma_put_context
 - Make sure the sge is set up completely in case the error
   path goes through svc_rdma_unmap_dma()
 - Replace the use of ENOSYS, which has a reserved meaning

Related fixes in svc_rdma_recvfrom():

 - Don't leak the ctxt associated with the incoming request
 - Don't close the connection after sending an error reply
 - Let svc_rdma_send_error() figure out the right header error code

As a last clean up, move svc_rdma_send_error() to svc_rdma_sendto.c
with other similar functions. There is some common logic in these
functions that could someday be combined to reduce code duplication.
