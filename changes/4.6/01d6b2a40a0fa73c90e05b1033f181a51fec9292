mmc: sdhci-pci: Add support and PCI IDs for more Broxton host controllers

Add support and PCI IDs for more Broxton host controllers

Other BXT IDs were added in v4.4 so cc'ing stable. This patch
is dependent on commit 163cbe31e516 ("mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix card
detect race for Intel BXT/APL") but that is already in stable
since v4.4.4.
