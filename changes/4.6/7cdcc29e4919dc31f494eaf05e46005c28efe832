serial-uartlite: add earlycon support

Microblaze currently uses the old earlyprintk system, rather than the
unified earlycon support, to show boot messages on uartlite. Add
earlycon support so that other archs using uartlite can benefit from
it. The new code in uartlite.c is copied almost verbatim from
arch/microblaze/kernel/early_printk.c.
