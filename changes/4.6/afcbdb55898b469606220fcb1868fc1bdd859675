[media] media: Media Controller register/unregister entity_notify API

Add new interfaces to register and unregister entity_notify
hook to media device. These interfaces allow drivers to add
hooks to take appropriate actions when new entities get added
to a shared media device. For example, au0828 bridge driver
registers an entity_notify hook to create links as needed
between media graph nodes.
