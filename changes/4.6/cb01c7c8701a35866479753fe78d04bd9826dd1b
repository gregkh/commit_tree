tipc: fix connection abort when receiving invalid cancel request

Until now, the subscribers endianness for a subscription
create/cancel request is determined as:
    swap = !(s->filter & (TIPC_SUB_PORTS | TIPC_SUB_SERVICE))
The checks are performed only for port/service subscriptions.

The swap calculation is incorrect if the filter in the subscription
cancellation request is set to TIPC_SUB_CANCEL (it's a malformed
cancel request, as the corresponding subscription create filter
is missing).
Thus, the check if the request is for cancellation fails and the
request is treated as a subscription create request. The
subscription creation fails as the request is illegal, which
terminates this connection.

In this commit we determine the endianness by including
TIPC_SUB_CANCEL, which will set swap correctly and the
request is processed as a cancellation request.
