staging/lustre/obdecho: remove userspace LSM handling

In lustre/obdecho/echo_client.c, remove handling of lov_stripe_md
passed from userspace (since userspace never passes it). Remove the
LOV specific code (ed_next_islov) from the echo client (since it
doesn't work).

Remove echo_get_stripe_off_id() and all calls to it since the stripe
count of the passed in lsm is always 0 and the funciton does nothing
in this case. Remove the then unused lsm parameters of
echo_client_page_debug_setup() and echo_client_page_debug_check().

In the OBD_IOC_GETATTR and OBD_IOC_SETATTR cases of
echo_client_iocontrol() do not set the oi_md member of struct obd_info
since only LOV OBD methods access it.
