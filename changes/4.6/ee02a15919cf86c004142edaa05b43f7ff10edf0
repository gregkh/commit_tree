arm64: Introduce cpu_die_early

Or in other words, make fail_incapable_cpu() reusable.

We use fail_incapable_cpu() to kill a secondary CPU early during the
bringup, which doesn't have the system advertised capabilities.
This patch makes the routine more generic, to kill a secondary
booting CPU, getting rid of the dependency on capability struct.
This can be used by checks which are not necessarily attached to
a capability struct (e.g, cpu ASIDBits).

In that process, renames the function to cpu_die_early() to better
match its functionality. This will be moved to arch/arm64/kernel/smp.c
later.
