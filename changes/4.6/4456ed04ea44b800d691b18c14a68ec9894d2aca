ethtool: future-proof interface for speed extensions

Many virtual and not quite virtual devices allow any speed to be set
through ethtool. In particular, this applies to the virtio-net devices.
Document this fact to make sure people don't assume the enum lists all
possible values.  Reserve values greater than INT_MAX for future
extension and to avoid conflict with SPEED_UNKNOWN.
