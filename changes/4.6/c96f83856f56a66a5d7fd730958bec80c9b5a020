powerpc/ftrace: Use generic ftrace_modify_all_code()

Convert powerpc's arch_ftrace_update_code() from its own version to use
the generic default functionality (without stop_machine -- our
instructions are properly aligned and the replacements atomic).

With this we gain error checking and the much-needed function_trace_op
handling.
