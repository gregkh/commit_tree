GFS2: Check if iopen is held when deleting inode

This patch fixes an error condition in which an inode is partially
created in gfs2_create_inode() but then some error is discovered,
which causes it to fail and call iput() before the iopen glock is
created or held. In that case, gfs2_delete_inode would try to
unlock an iopen glock that doesn't yet exist. Therefore, we test
its holder (which must exist) for the HIF_HOLDER bit before trying
to dq it.
