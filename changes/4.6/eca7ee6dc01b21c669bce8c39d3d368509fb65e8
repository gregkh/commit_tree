dm: distinquish old .request_fn (dm-old) vs dm-mq request-based DM

Rename various methods to have either a "dm_old" or "dm_mq" prefix.
Improve code comments to assist with understanding the duality of code
that handles both "dm_old" and "dm_mq" cases.

It is no much easier to quickly look at the code and _know_ that a given
method is either 1) "dm_old" only 2) "dm_mq" only 3) common to both.
