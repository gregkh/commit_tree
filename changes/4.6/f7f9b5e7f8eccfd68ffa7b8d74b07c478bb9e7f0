AF_VSOCK: Shrink the area influenced by prepare_to_wait

When a thread is prepared for waiting by calling prepare_to_wait, sleeping
is not allowed until either the wait has taken place or finish_wait has
been called.  The existing code in af_vsock imposed unnecessary no-sleep
assumptions to a broad list of backend functions.
This patch shrinks the influence of prepare_to_wait to the area where it
is strictly needed, therefore relaxing the no-sleep restriction there.
