drm/atomic: Handle encoder stealing from set_config better.

Instead of failing with -EINVAL when conflicting encoders are found,
the legacy set_config will disable other connectors when encoders
conflict.

With the previous commit this becomes a lot easier to implement.
set_config only adds connectors to the state that are modified,
and because of the previous commit that calls add_affected_connectors
only on set->crtc it means any connector not part of the modeset can
be stolen from. We disable the connector in that case, and possibly
the crtc if required.

Atomic modeset itself still doesn't allow encoder stealing, the results
would be too unpredictable.
