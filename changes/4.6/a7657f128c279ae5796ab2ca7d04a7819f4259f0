stmmac: fix MDIO settings

Initially the phy_bus_name was added to manipulate the
driver name but it was recently just used to manage the
fixed-link and then to take some decision at run-time.
So the patch uses the is_pseudo_fixed_link and removes
the phy_bus_name variable not necessary anymore.

The driver can manage the mdio registration by using phy-handle,
dwmac-mdio and own parameter e.g. snps,phy-addr.
This patch takes care about all these possible configurations
and fixes the mdio registration in case of there is a real
transceiver or a switch (that needs to be managed by using
fixed-link).
