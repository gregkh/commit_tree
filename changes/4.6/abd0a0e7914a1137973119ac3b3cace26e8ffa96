powerpc/mm: Clean up error handling for htab_remove_mapping

Currently, the only error that htab_remove_mapping() can report is -EINVAL,
if removal of bolted HPTEs isn't implemeted for this platform.  We make
a few clean ups to the handling of this:

 * EINVAL isn't really the right code - there's nothing wrong with the
   function's arguments - use ENODEV instead
 * We were also printing a warning message, but that's a decision better
   left up to the callers, so remove it
 * One caller is vmemmap_remove_mapping(), which will just BUG_ON() on
   error, making the warning message redundant, so no change is needed
   there.
 * The other caller is remove_section_mapping().  This is called in the
   memory hot remove path at a point after vmemmap_remove_mapping() so
   if hpte_removebolted isn't implemented, we'd expect to have already
   BUG()ed anyway.  Put a WARN_ON() here, in lieu of a printk() since this
   really shouldn't be happening.
