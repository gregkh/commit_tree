MIPS: traps.c: Verify the ISA for microMIPS RDHWR emulation

Make sure it's the microMIPS rather than MIPS16 ISA before emulating
microMIPS RDHWR.  Mostly needed as an optimisation for configurations
where `cpu_has_mmips' is hardcoded to 0 and also a good measure in case
we add further microMIPS instructions to emulate in the future, as the
corresponding MIPS16 encoding is ADDIUSP, not supposed to trap.
