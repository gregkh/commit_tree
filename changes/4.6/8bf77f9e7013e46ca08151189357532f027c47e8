[media] saa7134: Get rid of struct saa7134_input.tv field

The saa7134_input.tv field was used to indicate if an input had
a RF signal for TV input. This is not needed anymore, as the input
type can be checked directly by the driver.

Also, due to a past bug when setting the TV standard at the
demod, all inputs should have this field set, with is wrong.

This reduces the size of the saa7134_boards by about 8KB,
on i386 (and probably twice on 64 bits), with is a nice
colateral effect:
