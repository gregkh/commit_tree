arm64: KVM: Define PMU data structure for each vcpu

Here we plan to support virtual PMU for guest by full software
emulation, so define some basic structs and functions preparing for
futher steps. Define struct kvm_pmc for performance monitor counter and
struct kvm_pmu for performance monitor unit for each vcpu. According to
ARMv8 spec, the PMU contains at most 32(ARMV8_PMU_MAX_COUNTERS)
counters.

Since this only supports ARM64 (or PMUv3), add a separate config symbol
for it.
