avr32: wire up copy_file_range syscall

This patch wires up the new copy_file_range syscall on AVR32.

On AVR32, all parameters beyond the 5th are passed on the stack. System
calls don't use the stack -- they borrow a callee-saved register
instead. This means that syscalls that take 6 parameters must be called
through a stub that pushes the last parameter on the stack.
