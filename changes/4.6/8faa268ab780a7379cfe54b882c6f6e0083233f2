ASoC: qcom: Don't specify LE device endianness

This reverts commit 18560a4e3 (ASoC: qcom: Specify LE device
endianness).

The commit that caused us to specify LE device endianness here,
29bb45f25ff3 (regmap-mmio: Use native endianness for read/write,
2015-10-29), has been reverted in mainline so now when we specify
LE it actively breaks big endian kernels because the byte
swapping in regmap-mmio is incorrect. Let's revert this change
because it will 1) fix the big endian kernels and 2) be redundant
to specify LE because that will become the default soon.
