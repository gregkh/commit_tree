ARM: zynq: Move early printk virtual address to vmalloc area

The patch
"ARM: 8432/1: move VMALLOC_END from 0xff000000 to 0xff800000"
(sha1: 6ff0966052c46efb53980b8a1add2e7b49c9f560)
has moved also start of VMALLOC area because size didn't change.
That's why origin location of vmalloc was
   vmalloc : 0xf0000000 - 0xff000000   ( 240 MB)
and now is
   vmalloc : 0xf0800000 - 0xff800000   ( 240 MB)

That's why uart virtual addresses need to be changed to reflect this new
memory setup. Starting address should be vmalloc start address.
