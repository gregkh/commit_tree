quota: Fix possible GPF due to uninitialised pointers

When dqget() in __dquot_initialize() fails e.g. due to IO error,
__dquot_initialize() will pass an array of uninitialized pointers to
dqput_all() and thus can lead to deference of random data. Fix the
problem by properly initializing the array.
