mm: memcontrol: let v2 cgroups follow changes in system swappiness

Cgroup2 currently doesn't have a per-cgroup swappiness setting.  We
might want to add one later - that's a different discussion - but until
we do, the cgroups should always follow the system setting.  Otherwise
it will be unchangeably set to whatever the ancestor inherited from the
system setting at the time of cgroup creation.
