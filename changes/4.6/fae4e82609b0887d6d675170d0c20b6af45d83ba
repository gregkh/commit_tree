usb: dwc2: host: Add dwc2_hcd_get_future_frame_number() call

As we start getting more exact about our scheduling it's becoming more
and more important to know exactly how far through the current frame we
are.  This lets us make decisions about whether there's still time left
to start a new transaction in the current frame.

We'll add dwc2_hcd_get_future_frame_number() which will tell you what
the frame number will be a certain number of microseconds (us) from
now.  We can use this information to help decide if there's enough time
left in the frame for a transaction that will take a certain duration.

This is expected to be used by a future change ("usb: dwc2: host:
Properly set even/odd frame").
