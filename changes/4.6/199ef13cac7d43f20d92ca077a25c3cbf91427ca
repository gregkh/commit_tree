scsi: ufs: avoid spurious UFS host controller interrupts

When control reaches to Linux UFS driver during UFS boot mode, UFS host

settings.
In order to avoid any spurious interrupts due to these left overs,
it's important to clear these interrupt status/enable registers before
enabling UFS interrupt handling.
