s390/kvm: simplify set_guest_storage_key

Git commit ab3f285f227fec62868037e9b1b1fd18294a83b8
"KVM: s390/mm: try a cow on read only pages for key ops"
added a fixup_user_fault to set_guest_storage_key force a copy on
write if the page is mapped read-only. This is supposed to fix the
problem of differing storage keys for shared mappings, e.g. the
empty_zero_page.
But if the storage key is set before the pte is mapped the storage
key update is done on the pgste. A later fault will happily map the
shared page with the key from the pgste.

Eventually git commit 2faee8ff9dc6f4bfe46f6d2d110add858140fb20
"s390/mm: prevent and break zero page mappings in case of storage keys"
fixed this problem for the empty_zero_page. The commit makes sure that
guests enabled for storage keys will not use the empty_zero_page at all.

As the call to fixup_user_fault in set_guest_storage_key depends on the
order of the storage key operation vs. the fault that maps the pte
it does not really fix anything. Just remove it.
