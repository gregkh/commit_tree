vfio: Define sparse mmap capability for regions

We can't always support mmap across an entire device region, for
example we deny mmaps covering the MSI-X table of PCI devices, but
we don't really have a way to report it.  We expect the user to
implicitly know this restriction.  We also can't split the region
because vfio-pci defines an API with fixed region index to BAR
number mapping.  We therefore define a new capability which lists
areas within the region that may be mmap'd.  In addition to the
MSI-X case, this potentially enables in-kernel emulation and
extensions to devices.
