mbcache2: Use referenced bit instead of LRU

Currently we maintain perfect LRU list by moving entry to the tail of
the list when it gets used. However these operations on cache-global
list are relatively expensive.

In this patch we switch to lazy updates of LRU list. Whenever entry gets
used, we set a referenced bit in it. When reclaiming entries, we give
referenced entries another round in the LRU. Since the list is not a
real LRU anymore, rename it to just 'list'.

In my testing this logic gives about 30% boost to workloads with mostly
unique xattr blocks (e.g. xattr-bench with 10 files and 10000 unique
xattr values).
