thermal: Add Mediatek thermal controller support

This adds support for the Mediatek thermal controller found on MT8173
and likely other SoCs.
The controller is a bit special. It does not have its own ADC, instead
it controls the on-SoC AUXADC via AHB bus accesses. For this reason
we need the physical address of the AUXADC. Also it controls a mux
using AHB bus accesses, so we need the APMIXEDSYS physical address aswell.
