xhci: fix 10 second timeout on removal of PCI hotpluggable xhci controllers

PCI hotpluggable xhci controllers such as some Alpine Ridge solutions will
remove the xhci controller from the PCI bus when the last USB device is
disconnected.

Add a flag to indicate that the host is being removed to avoid queueing
configure_endpoint commands for the dropped endpoints.
For PCI hotplugged controllers this will prevent 5 second command timeouts
For static xhci controllers the configure_endpoint command is not needed
in the removal case as everything will be returned, freed, and the
controller is reset.

For now the flag is only set for PCI connected host controllers.
