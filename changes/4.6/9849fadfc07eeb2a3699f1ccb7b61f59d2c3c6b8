clk: st: avoid uninitialized variable use

My previous patch fixed some warnings about printing a couple
of variables that are always uninitialized in quadfs_pll_fs660c32_set_rate(),
but I now got a warning that only shows up in some configurations (i.e.
without gcc -Os) about the params.ndiv being used uninitialized in the
error case:

drivers/clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c: In function 'quadfs_pll_fs660c32_set_rate':
drivers/clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c:584:75: warning: 'params.ndiv' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
drivers/clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c:574:16: note: 'params.ndiv' was declared here

This changes the error handling so we bail for invalid arguments rather
than continuing with uninitialized data.
