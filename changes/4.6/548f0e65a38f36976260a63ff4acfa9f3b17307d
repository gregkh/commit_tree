aacraid: add missing curly braces

gcc-6 warns about obviously wrong indentation for newly added code in
aac_slave_configure():

drivers/scsi/aacraid/linit.c: In function 'aac_slave_configure':
drivers/scsi/aacraid/linit.c:458:3: warning: statement is indented as if it were guarded by... [-Wmisleading-indentation]
   sdev->tagged_supported = 1;
   ^~~~
drivers/scsi/aacraid/linit.c:455:4: note: ...this 'else' clause, but it is not

gcc is correct, and evidently this was meant to be within the curly
braces that should have been there to start with. This patch adds them,
which avoids the warning and makes it clear what was intended here.

Nothing changes in behavior because in the 'if' block, the
sdev->tagged_supported flag is known to be set already.
