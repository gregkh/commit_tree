arm64: KVM: unregister notifiers in hyp mode teardown path

Commit 1e947bad0b63 ("arm64: KVM: Skip HYP setup when already running
in HYP") re-organized the hyp init code and ended up leaving the CPU
hotplug and PM notifier even if hyp mode initialization fails.

Since KVM is not yet supported with ACPI, the above mentioned commit
breaks CPU hotplug in ACPI boot.

This patch fixes teardown_hyp_mode to properly unregister both CPU
hotplug and PM notifiers in the teardown path.
