arm64: KVM: VHE: Differenciate host/guest sysreg save/restore

With ARMv8, host and guest share the same system register file,
making the save/restore procedure completely symetrical.
With VHE, host and guest now have different requirements, as they
use different sysregs.

In order to prepare for this, add split sysreg save/restore functions
for both host and guest. No functional changes yet.
