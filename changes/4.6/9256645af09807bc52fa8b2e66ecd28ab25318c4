net/core: relax BUILD_BUG_ON in netdev_stats_to_stats64

The netdev_stats_to_stats64 function copies the deprecated
net_device_stats format stats into rtnl_link_stats64 for legacy support
purposes, but with the BUILD_BUG_ON as it was, it wasn't possible to
extend rtnl_link_stats64 without also extending net_device_stats. Relax
the BUILD_BUG_ON to only require that rtnl_link_stats64 is larger, and
zero out all the stat counters that aren't present in net_device_stats.
