parisc: fix a bug when syscall number of tracee is __NR_Linux_syscalls

Do not load one entry beyond the end of the syscall table when the
syscall number of a traced process equals to __NR_Linux_syscalls.
Similar bug with regular processes was fixed by commit 3bb457af4fa8
("[PARISC] Fix bug when syscall nr is __NR_Linux_syscalls").

This bug was found by strace test suite.
