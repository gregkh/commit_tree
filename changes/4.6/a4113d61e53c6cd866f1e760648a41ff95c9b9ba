staging: lustre: fix lock imbalance

nrs_resource_put_safe() might hold a lock one one struct
while operating on the other.
There are 2 levels of structures.
Use nrs_policy_put(), which has locking baked in.

sparse gives the following warning:
drivers/staging/lustre//lustre/ptlrpc/nrs.c:498:39:
warning: context imbalance in 'nrs_resource_put_safe' -
  different lock contexts for basic block
