drm/i915: Allow use of get_dma_address for stolen backed objects

i915_gem_object_get_dma_address function is used to retrieve the dma address
of a particular page so as to map it in a given GTT entry for CPU access.
This function would be used for stolen backed objects also for tasks like
pwrite,  clearing of the pages etc. So the obj->get_page.sg needs to be
initialized for the stolen objects also.
