amd-xgbe: Disable VLAN filtering when in promiscuous mode

When the hardware is placed in promiscuous mode it will still perform
VLAN filtering and therefore may not pass all packets to the driver.

Disable all VLAN filtering when entering promiscuous mode and restore
VLAN filtering upon exit from promiscuous mode. In order to avoid adding
forward declarations, move the VLAN related functions earlier in the
file.
