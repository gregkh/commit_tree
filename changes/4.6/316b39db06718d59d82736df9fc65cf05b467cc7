arm64: mm: avoid redundant __pa(__va(x))

When we "upgrade" to a section mapping, we free any table we made
redundant by giving it back to memblock. To get the PA, we acquire the
physical address and convert this to a VA, then subsequently convert
this back to a PA.

This works currently, but will not work if the tables are not accessed
via linear map VAs (e.g. is we use fixmap slots).

This patch uses {pmd,pud}_page_paddr to acquire the PA. This avoids the
__pa(__va()) round trip, saving some work and avoiding reliance on the
linear mapping.
