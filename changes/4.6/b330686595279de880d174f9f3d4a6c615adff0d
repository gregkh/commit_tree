staging: wilc1000: wilc_set_wfi_drv_handler: add mac index

Firmware supports sta/ap concurrency so mac index will be passed to wilc.
Remove wilc_set_wfi_drv_handler in scan and connect functions, and call
the function in ndo_open which is wilc_mac_open.
WID_SET_DRV_HANDLER value has been changed as well.
