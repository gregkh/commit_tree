crypto: ccp - Add abstraction for device-specific calls

Support for different generations of the coprocessor
requires that an abstraction layer be implemented for
interacting with the hardware. This patch splits out
version-specific functions to a separate file and populates
the version structure (acting as a driver) with function
pointers.
