leds: core: avoid error message when a USB LED device is unplugged

When a USB LED device is unplugged the remove call chain calls
led_classdev_unregister which tries to switch the LED off.
As the device has been removed already this results in a ENODEV
error message in dmesg.
Avoid this error message by ignoring ENODEV in calls from
led_classdev_unregister if the LED device is flagged as pluggable.

Therefore a new flag LED_HW_PLUGGABLE was introduced which should be set by
all LED drivers handling pluggable LED devices (mainly USB LED devices).
