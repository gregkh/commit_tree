netfilter: don't call hooks unless needed

With the previous patches in place, a netns nf_hook_list might be empty,
even if e.g. init_net performs filtering.

Thus change nf_hook_thresh to check the hook_list as well before
initializing hook_state and calling nf_hook_slow().

We still make use of static keys; if no netfilter modules are loaded
list is guaranteed to be empty.
