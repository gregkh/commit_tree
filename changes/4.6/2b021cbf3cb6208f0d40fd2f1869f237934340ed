cgroup: ignore css_sets associated with dead cgroups during migration

Before 2e91fa7f6d45 ("cgroup: keep zombies associated with their
original cgroups"), all dead tasks were associated with init_css_set.
If a zombie task is requested for migration, while migration prep
operations would still be performed on init_css_set, the actual
migration would ignore zombie tasks.  As init_css_set is always valid,
this worked fine.

However, after 2e91fa7f6d45, zombie tasks stay with the css_set it was
associated with at the time of death.  Let's say a task T associated
with cgroup A on hierarchy H-1 and cgroup B on hiearchy H-2.  After T
becomes a zombie, it would still remain associated with A and B.  If A
only contains zombie tasks, it can be removed.  On removal, A gets
marked offline but stays pinned until all zombies are drained.  At
this point, if migration is initiated on T to a cgroup C on hierarchy
H-2, migration path would try to prepare T's css_set for migration and
trigger the following.

It doesn't make sense to prepare migration for css_sets pointing to
dead cgroups as they are guaranteed to contain only zombies which are
ignored later during migration.  This patch makes cgroup destruction
path mark all affected css_sets as dead and updates the migration path
to ignore them during preparation.
