staging/rdma/hfi1: Avoid using upstream component if it is not accessible

When the hfi1 device is assigned to a VM (eg KVM), the hfi1 driver has
no access to the upstream component and therefore cannot use it to perform
some operations, such as secondary bus reset. As a result, the hfi1 driver
cannot perform the pcie Gen3 transition. Instead, those operation should
be done in the host environment, preferrably done during the Option ROM
initialization. Similarly, the hfi1 driver cannot support ASPM and tune
the pcie capability under this circumstance.
