X.509: Fix leap year handling again

There are still a couple of minor issues in the X.509 leap year handling:

 (1) To avoid doing a modulus-by-400 in addition to a modulus-by-100 when
     determining whether the year is a leap year or not, I divided the year
     by 100 after doing the modulus-by-100, thereby letting the compiler do
     one instruction for both, and then did a modulus-by-4.

     Unfortunately, I then passed the now-modified year value to mktime64()
     to construct a time value.

     Since this isn't a fast path and since mktime64() does a bunch of
     divisions, just condense down to "% 400".  It's also easier to read.

 (2) The default month length for any February where the year doesn't
     divide by four exactly is obtained from the month_length[] array where
     the value is 29, not 28.

     This is fixed by altering the table.
