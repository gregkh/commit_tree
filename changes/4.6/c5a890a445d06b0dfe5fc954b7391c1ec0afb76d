ARM: imx: Add msl code support for imx6qp

The i.MX6QP is a different SOC, but internally we treate it as i.MX6Q
Rev_2.0 to maximum the code reusability. The chip silicon number we
read from the ANADIG_DIGPROG is 0x630100. This patch add code to
identify it as i.MX6QP Rev_1.0 when print out the silicon version.
