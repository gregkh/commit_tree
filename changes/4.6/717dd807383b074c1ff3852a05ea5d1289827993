net: hns: fixes a bug of RSS

If trying to get receive flow hash indirection table by ethtool, it needs
to call .get_rxnfc to get ring number first. So this patch implements the
.get_rxnfc of ethtool. And the data type of rss_indir_table is u32, it has
to be multiply by the width of data type when using memcpy.
