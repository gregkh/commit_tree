x86/platform: Make platform/geode/alix.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

  arch/x86/Kconfig:config ALIX
  arch/x86/Kconfig:       bool "PCEngines ALIX System Support (LED setup)"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We replace module.h with moduleparam.h since the file does declare
some module parameters, and leaving them as such is currently the
easiest way to remain compatible with existing boot arg use cases.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
