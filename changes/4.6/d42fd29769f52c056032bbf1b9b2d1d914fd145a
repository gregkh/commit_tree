[media] media: rc: nuvoton-cir: fix interrupt handling

Only handle an interrupt if at least one combination of event bit
and related interrupt bit is set.
Previously it was just checked that at least one event bit and
at least one interrupt bit are set.

This fixes issues like the following which was caused by
interrupt sharing:
An interrupt intended for nvt_cir_isr was handled by nvt_cir_wake_isr
first and because status bit CIR_WAKE_IRSTS_IR_PENDING was set
the wake fifo was accidently cleared.

This patch also fixes the bug that nvt_cir_wake_isr returned IRQ_HANDLED
even if it detected that the (shared) interrupt was meant for another
handler.
