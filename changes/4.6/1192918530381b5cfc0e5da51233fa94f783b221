stm class: Add heartbeat stm source device

Heartbeat stm source may have multiple instances (for connecting to
different stm devices). Each instance will send a periodic test message
over its stm device when it is linked. This can be used for testing stm
class framework, stm device drivers or as a heartbeat over the stm link.
