[media] media: vb2: Fix regression on poll() for RW mode

When using a device is read/write mode, vb2 does not handle properly the
first select/poll operation.

The reason for this, is that when this code has been refactored, some of
the operations have changed their order, and now fileio emulator is not
started.

The reintroduced check to the core is enabled by a quirk flag, that
avoids this check by other subsystems like DVB.
