byteswap: try to avoid __builtin_constant_p gcc bug

This is another attempt to avoid a regression in wwn_to_u64() after that
started using get_unaligned_be64(), which in turn ran into a bug on
gcc-4.9 through 6.1.

The regression got introduced due to the combination of two separate
workarounds (commits e3bde9568d99: "include/linux/unaligned: force
inlining of byteswap operations" and ef3fb2422ffe: "scsi: fc: use
get/put_unaligned64 for wwn access") that each try to sidestep distinct
problems with gcc behavior (code growth and increased stack usage).

Unfortunately after both have been applied, a more serious gcc bug has
been uncovered, leading to incorrect object code that discards part of a
function and causes undefined behavior.

As part of this problem is how __builtin_constant_p gets evaluated on an
argument passed by reference into an inline function, this avoids the
use of __builtin_constant_p() for all architectures that set
CONFIG_ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP.  Most architectures do not set
ARCH_SUPPORTS_OPTIMIZED_INLINING, which means they probably do not
suffer from the problem in the qla2xxx driver, but they might still run
into it elsewhere.

Both of the original workarounds were only merged in the 4.6 kernel, and
the bug that is fixed by this patch should only appear if both are
there, so we probably don't need to backport the fix.  On the other
hand, it works by simplifying the code path and should not have any
negative effects.
