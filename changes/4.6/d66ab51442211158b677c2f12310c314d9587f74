hv_netvsc: Move subchannel waiting to rndis_filter_device_remove()

During hot add, vmbus_device_register() is called from vmbus_onoffer(), on
the same workqueue as the subchannel offer message work-queue, so
subchannel offer won't be processed until the vmbus_device_register()/...
/netvsc_probe() is done.
Also, vmbus_device_register() is called with channel_mutex locked, which
prevents subchannel processing too. So the "waiting for sub-channel
processing" will not success in hot add case. But, in usual module loading,
the netvsc_probe() is called from different code path, and doesn't fail.

This patch resolves the deadlock during NIC hot-add, and speeds up NIC
loading time.
