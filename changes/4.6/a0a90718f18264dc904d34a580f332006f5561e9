spi: Let drivers translate ACPI DeviceSelection to suitable Linux chip select

In Windows it is up to the SPI host controller driver to handle the ACPI
DeviceSelection as it likes. The SPI core does not take any part in it.
This is different in Linux because we always expect to have chip select in
range of 0 .. master->num_chipselect - 1.

In order to support this in Linux we need a way to allow the driver to
translate between ACPI DeviceSelection field and Linux chip select number
so provide a new optional hook ->fw_translate_cs() that can be used by a
driver to handle translation and call this hook if set during SPI slave
ACPI enumeration.
