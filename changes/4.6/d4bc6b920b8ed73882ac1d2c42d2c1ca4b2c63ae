pinctrl: pinctrl-mt6397 driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this driver is currently:

config PINCTRL_MT6397
        bool "Mediatek MT6397 pin control" if COMPILE_TEST && !MFD_MT6397

...meaning that it is currently not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.
