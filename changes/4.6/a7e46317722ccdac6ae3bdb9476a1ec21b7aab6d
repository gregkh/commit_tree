mfd: db8500: Avoid uninitialized variable reference

The prcmu_config_clkout() function ensures that the 'clkout' argument
can only be '0' or '1' using an appropriate BUG_ON(), so the compiler
should know that the div_mask, mask, and bits variables are always
initialized later on. However, it doesn't understand this in gcc-5.2
and produces a false positive warning instead:

drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c: In function 'prcmu_config_clkout':
drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c:762:10: error: 'div_mask' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
  if (val & div_mask) {
          ^
drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c:769:13: error: 'mask' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    if ((val & mask & ~div_mask) != bits) {
             ^
drivers/mfd/db8500-prcmu.c:757:7: error: 'bits' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Replacing the switch() statement with an equivalent if() lets
gcc figure this out reliably and avoids the warnings.
