ARM: dts: exynos: Don't overheat the Odroid XU3-Lite on high load

After adding cpufreq-dt support to Exynos542x, the Odroid XU3-Lite can
be easily overheated when launching eight CPU-intensive tasks:
	thermal thermal_zone3: critical temperature reached(121 C),shutting down

This seems to be specific to Odroid XU3-Lite board which officially
supports lower frequencies than regular XU3 or XU4. When working at
maximum CPU speed (1800 MHz big and 1300 MHz LITTLE) in warmer place for
longer time, the fan fails to cool down the board and it reaches
critical temperature.

Add CPU cooling to Exynos5422/5800 to fix this issue. When reaching last
interrupt-driven trip-point (70 degrees of Celsius) start passive
cooling in polling mode (slowing CPU by 2 steps). When reaching 85
degrees of Celsius, start slowing even more, down to 600 MHz.
