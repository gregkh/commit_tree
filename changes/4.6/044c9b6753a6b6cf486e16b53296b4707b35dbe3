quota: Fix possible races during quota loading

When loading new quota structure from disk, there is a possibility caller
of dqget() will see uninitialized data due to CPU reordering loads or
stores - loads from dquot can be reordered before test of DQ_ACTIVE_B
bit or setting of this bit could be reordered before filling of the
structure. Fix the issue by adding proper memory barriers.
