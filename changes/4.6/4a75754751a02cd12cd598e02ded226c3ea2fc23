usb: chipidea: otg: add A idle to B disconnect timer

B-device detects that bus is idle for more than TB_AIDL_BDIS min and
begins HNP by turning off pullup on DP, this allows the bus to discharge
to the SE0 state. This timer was missed and failed with PET test:
6.8.5 B-UUT HNP of USB OTG and EH automated compliance plan v1.2,
this patch is to fix this timing issue.
