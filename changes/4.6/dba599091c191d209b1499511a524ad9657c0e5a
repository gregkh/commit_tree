s390/pci: fix use after free in dma_init

After a failure during registration of the dma_table (because of the
function being in error state) we free its memory but don't reset the
associated pointer to zero.

When we then receive a notification from firmware (about the function
being in error state) we'll try to walk and free the dma_table again.

Fix this by resetting the dma_table pointer. In addition to that make
sure that we free the iommu_bitmap when appropriate.
