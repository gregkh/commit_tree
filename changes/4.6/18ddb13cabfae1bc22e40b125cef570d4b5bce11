staging: lustre: reverse LNet and infinband header order

LNet is an abstraction built on top of network APIs such
as infiniband or TCP/IP layer. Since LNet is dependent
on these other layers we should ensure LNet headers
should always come after the infiniband header since the
infiniband headers can influence the LNet header
definitions.
