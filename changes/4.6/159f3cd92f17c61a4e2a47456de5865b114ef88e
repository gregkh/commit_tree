gpiolib: Defer gpio device setup until after gpiolib initialization

Since commit ff2b13592299 ("gpio: make the gpiochip a real device"),
attempts to add a gpio chip prior to gpiolib initialization cause
the system to crash. This happens because gpio_bus_type has not been
registered yet. Defer creating gpio devices until after gpiolib has
been initialized to fix the problem.
