arm64: add support for building vmlinux as a relocatable PIE binary

This implements CONFIG_RELOCATABLE, which links the final vmlinux
image with a dynamic relocation section, allowing the early boot code
to perform a relocation to a different virtual address at runtime.

This is a prerequisite for KASLR (CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE).
