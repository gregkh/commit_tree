PCI: Add pci_set_vpd_size() to set VPD size

After 104daa71b396 ("PCI: Determine actual VPD size on first access"), the
PCI core computes the valid VPD size by parsing the VPD starting at offset
0x0.  We don't attempt to read past that valid size because that causes
some devices to crash.

However, some devices do have data past that valid size.  For example,
Chelsio adapters contain two VPD structures, and the driver needs both of
them.

Add pci_set_vpd_size().  If a driver knows it is safe to read past the end
of the VPD data structure at offset 0, it can use pci_set_vpd_size() to
allow access to as much data as it needs.

[bhelgaas: changelog, split patches, rename to pci_set_vpd_size() and
return int (not ssize_t)]
