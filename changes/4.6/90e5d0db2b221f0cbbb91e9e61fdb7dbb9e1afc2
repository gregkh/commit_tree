soreuseport: Fix TCP listener hash collision

I forgot to include a check for listener port equality when deciding
if two sockets should belong to the same reuseport group.  This was
not caught previously because it's only necessary when two listening
sockets for the same user happen to hash to the same listener bucket.
The same error does not exist in the UDP path.
