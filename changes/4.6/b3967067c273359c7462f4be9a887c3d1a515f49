rtc: Add functions to set and read rtc offset

A number of rtc devices, such as the NXP pcf2123 include a facility
to adjust the clock in order to compensate for temperature or a
crystal, capacitor, etc, that results in the rtc clock not running
at exactly 32.768 kHz.

Data sheets I have seen refer to this as a clock offset, and measure it
in parts per million, however they often reference ppm to 2 digits of
precision, which makes integer ppm less than ideal.

We use parts per billion, which more than covers the precision needed
and works nicely within 32 bits
