livepatch: Fix the error message about unresolvable ambiguity

klp_find_callback() stops the search when sympos is not defined and
a second symbol of the same name is found. It means that the current
error message about the unresolvable ambiguity always prints "(2 matches)".

Let's remove this information. The total number of occurrences is
not much helpful. The author of the patch still must put a non-trivial
effort into searching the right position in the object file.
