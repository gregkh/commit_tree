arm64: KVM: PMU: Add perf event map and introduce perf event creating function

When we use tools like perf on host, perf passes the event type and the
id of this event type category to kernel, then kernel will map them to
hardware event number and write this number to PMU PMEVTYPER<n>_EL0
register. When getting the event number in KVM, directly use raw event
type to create a perf_event for it.
