KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Save maintenance interrupt state only if required

Next on our list of useless accesses is the maintenance interrupt
status registers (GICH_MISR, GICH_EISR{0,1}).

It is pointless to save them if we haven't asked for a maintenance
interrupt the first place, which can only happen for two reasons:
- Underflow: GICH_HCR_UIE will be set,
- EOI: GICH_LR_EOI will be set.

These conditions can be checked on the in-memory copies of the regs.
Should any of these two condition be valid, we must read GICH_MISR.
We can then check for GICH_MISR_EOI, and only when set read
GICH_EISR*.

This means that in most case, we don't have to save them at all.
