powerpc32: optimise csum_partial() loop

On the 8xx, load latency is 2 cycles and taking branches also takes
2 cycles. So let's unroll the loop.

This patch improves csum_partial() speed by around 10% on both:
* 8xx (single issue processor with parallel execution)
* 83xx (superscalar 6xx processor with dual instruction fetch
and parallel execution)
