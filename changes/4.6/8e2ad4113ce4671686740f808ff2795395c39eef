macvtap: always pass ethernet header in linear

The stack expects link layer headers in the skb linear section.
Macvtap can create skbs with llheader in frags in edge cases:
when (IFF_VNET_HDR is off or vnet_hdr.hdr_len < ETH_HLEN) and
prepad + len > PAGE_SIZE and vnet_hdr.flags has no or bad csum.

Add checks to ensure linear is always at least ETH_HLEN.
At this point, len is already ensured to be >= ETH_HLEN.

For backwards compatiblity, rounds up short vnet_hdr.hdr_len.
This differs from tap and packet, which return an error.
