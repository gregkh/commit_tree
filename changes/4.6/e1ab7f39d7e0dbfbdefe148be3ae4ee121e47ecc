atomics: Allow architectures to define their own __atomic_op_* helpers

Some architectures may have their special barriers for acquire, release
and fence semantics, so that general memory barriers(smp_mb__*_atomic())
in the default __atomic_op_*() may be too strong, so allow architectures
to define their own helpers which can overwrite the default helpers.
