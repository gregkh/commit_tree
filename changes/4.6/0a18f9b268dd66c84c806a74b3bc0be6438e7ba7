dmaengine: pl330: fix to support the burst mode

This patch fixes the burst mode that will break DMA uart on SoCFPGA.

In some cases, some SoCS didn't support the multi-burst
even if the devices who use the pl330 claim support the maxburst.

Fixes: commit 848e977
"dmaengine: pl330: support burst mode for dev-to-mem and mem-to-dev transmit"
