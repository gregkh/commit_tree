clocksource/drivers/lpc32xx: Support periodic mode

This commit adds the support for periodic mode. This is done by not
setting the MR0S (Stop on TnMR0) bit on MCR, thus allowing
interrupts to be periodically generated on MR0 matches.

In order to do this, move the initial configuration that is specific to
the one-shot mode to set_state_oneshot().
