ARM: DRA7: hwmod: Add data for eDMA tpcc, tptc0, tptc1

Add hwmod data for the eDMA blocks:
 - TPCC: Third-party channel controller
 - TPTC0: Third-party transfer controller 0
 - TPTC1: Third-party transfer controller 1

The TPCC's clock gating status follows the status of its clock and
power domain. This means that the hwmod code can not directly control
the TPCC enable/disable status.
