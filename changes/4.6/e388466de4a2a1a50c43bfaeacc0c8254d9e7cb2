mm: make remove_migration_ptes() beyond mm/migration.c

Make remove_migration_ptes() available to be used in split_huge_page().

New parameter 'locked' added: as with try_to_umap() we need a way to
indicate that caller holds rmap lock.

We also shouldn't try to mlock() pte-mapped huge pages: pte-mapeed THP
pages are never mlocked.
