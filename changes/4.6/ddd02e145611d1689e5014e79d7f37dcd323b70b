clk: rockchip: don't return NULL when registering inverter fails

Avoid return NULL if rockchip_clk_register_inverter fails, otherwise
rockchip_clk_register_branches print "unknown clock type". The acutal
case is that it's a known clock type but we fail to regiser it, which
may makes user confuse the reason of failure.
