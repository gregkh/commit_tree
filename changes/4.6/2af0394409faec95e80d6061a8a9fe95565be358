drm: rcar-du: Restart the DU group when a plane source changes

Plane sources are configured by the VSPS bit in the PnDDCR4 register.
Although the datasheet states that the bit is updated during vertical
blanking, it seems that updates only occur when the DU group is held in
reset through the DSYSR.DRES bit. Restart the group if the source
changes.
