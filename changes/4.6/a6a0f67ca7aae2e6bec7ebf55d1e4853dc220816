drm/nouveau/devinit/gf100-: detect if BIOS invoked devinit

It is not advisable to perform devinit if it has already been done.
VBIOS will very likely have invoked devinit if the GPU is the primary
graphics device, but there is no accurate way to detect this fact yet.

This patch adds such a method for gf100 and later chips, by means of the
NV_PTOP_SCRATCH1_DEVINIT_COMPLETED bit. This bit is set to 1 by devinit,
and reset to 0 when the GPU is powered.
