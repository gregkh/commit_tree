usb: dwc2: host: Properly set the HFIR

According to the most up to date version of the dwc2 databook, the FRINT
field of the HFIR register should be programmed to:
* 125 us * (PHY clock freq for HS) - 1
* 1000 us * (PHY clock freq for FS/LS) - 1

This is opposed to older versions of the doc that claimed it should be:
* 125 us * (PHY clock freq for HS)
* 1000 us * (PHY clock freq for FS/LS)

In case you didn't spot it, the difference is the "- 1".

Let's add the "- 1" to match the newest user manual.  It's presumed that
the "- 1" should have always been there and that this was always a
documentation error.  If some hardware needs the "- 1" and other
hardware doesn't, we'll have to add a configuration parameter for it in
the future.

I checked things before and after this patch on rk3288 using a Total
Phase Beagle 5000 analyzer.

Before this patch, a low speed mouse shows constant Frame Timing Jitter
errors.  After this patch errors have gone away.

Before this patch SOF packets move forward about 1 us per 4 ms.  After
this patch the SOF packets move backward about 1 us per 255 ms.  Some
specific SOF timestamps from the analyzer are below.
