genirq: Use a common macro to go through the actions list

The irq code browses the list of actions differently to inspect the element
one by one. Even if it is not a problem, for the sake of consistent code,
provide a macro similar to for_each_irq_desc in order to have the same loop to
go through the actions list and use it in the code.

[ tglx: Renamed the macro ]
