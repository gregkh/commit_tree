TTY, devpts: document pty count limiting

Logic has been changed in kernel 3.4 by commit e9aba5158a80
("tty: rework pty count limiting") but still not documented.

Sysctl kernel.pty.max works as global limit, kernel.pty.reserve ptys
are reserved for initial devpts instance (mounted without "newinstance").
Per-instance limit also could be set by mount option "max=%d".
