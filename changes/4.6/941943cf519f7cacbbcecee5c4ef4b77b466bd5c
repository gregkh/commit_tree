drivers/hwtracing: make coresight-* explicitly non-modular

None of the Kconfig currently controlling compilation of any of
the files here are tristate, meaning that none of it currently
is being built as a module by anyone.

We need not be concerned about .remove functions and blocking the
unbind sysfs operations, since that was already done in a recent
commit.

Lets remove any remaining modular references, so that when reading the
drivers there is no doubt they are builtin-only.

All drivers get mostly the same changes, so they are handled in batch.
Changes are (1) convert to builtin_amba_driver, (2) delete module.h
include where unused, and (3) relocate the description into the
comments so we don't need MODULE_DESCRIPTION and associated tags.

The etm3x and etm4x use module_param_named, and have been adjusted
to just include moduleparam.h for that purpose.

In commit f309d4443130bf814e991f836e919dca22df37ae ("platform_device:
better support builtin boilerplate avoidance") we introduced the
builtin_driver macro.

Here we use that support and extend it to amba driver registration,
so where a driver is clearly non-modular and builtin-only, we can
update with the simple mapping of

     module_amba_driver(...)  ---> builtin_amba_driver(...)

Since module_amba_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_amba_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.
