spi: pxa2xx: Do not detect number of enabled chip selects on Intel SPT

Certain Intel Sunrisepoint PCH variants report zero chip selects in SPI
capabilities register even they have one per port. Detection in
pxa2xx_spi_probe() sets master->num_chipselect to 0 leading to -EINVAL
from spi_register_master() where chip select count is validated.

Fix this by not using SPI capabilities register on Sunrisepoint. They don't
have more than one chip select so use the default value 1 instead of
detection.
