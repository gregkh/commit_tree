PM/freezer: y2038, use boottime to compare tstamps

Wall time obtained from do_gettimeofday gives 32 bit timeval which can only
represent time until January 2038. This patch moves to ktime_t, a 64-bit time.

Also, wall time is susceptible to sudden jumps due to user setting the time or
due to NTP.  Boot time is constantly increasing time better suited for
subtracting two timestamps.
