mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: Remove no-hispd and no-cmd23 quirks for sdhci-arasan4.9a

The Arason SD host controller supports set block count command (cmd23)
and high speed mode. This patch re-enable both of these features that
was disabled. For device that doesn't support high speed, it should
configure its capability register accordingly instead disables it
explicitly.
