arm64: kvm: 4.6-rc1: Fix VTCR_EL2 VS setting

When we detect support for 16bit VMID in ID_AA64MMFR1, we set the
VTCR_EL2_VS field to 1 to make use of 16bit vmids. But, with
commit 3a3604bc5eb4 ("arm64: KVM: Switch to C-based stage2 init")
this is broken and we corrupt VTCR_EL2:T0SZ instead of updating the VS
field. VTCR_EL2_VS was actually defined to the field shift (19) and
not the real value for VS. This patch fixes the issue.

Fixes: commit 3a3604bc5eb4 ("arm64: KVM: Switch to C-based stage2 init")
