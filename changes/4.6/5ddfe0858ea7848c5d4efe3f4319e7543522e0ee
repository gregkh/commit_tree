scsi: Do not attach VPD to devices that don't support it

The patch "scsi: rescan VPD attributes" introduced a regression in which
devices that don't support VPD were being scanned for VPD attributes
anyway.  This could cause issues for some devices and should be avoided
so the check for scsi_level has been moved out of scsi_add_lun and into
scsi_attach_vpd so that all callers will not scan VPD for devices that
don't support it.
