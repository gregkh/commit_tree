serial: 8250/ingenic: fix building with SERIAL_8250=m

The Ingenic 8250 driver has a 'bool' Kconfig symbol, but that
breaks when SERIAL_8250 is a loadable module:

drivers/tty/built-in.o: In function `ingenic_uart_probe':
8250_ingenic.c:(.text+0x1c1a0): undefined reference to `serial8250_register_8250_port'

This changes the symbol to a 'tristate', plus a dependency on
SERIAL_8250, which makes it work again. Unlike the other
soc-specific backends, this one has no dependency on an
architecture or a platform. I'm adding a dependency on
MIPS || COMPILE_TEST as well here, to avoid showing the driver
on architectures that are not interested in it.
