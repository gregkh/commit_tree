spi: core: added spi_resource management

SPI resource management framework used while processing a spi_message
via the spi-core.

The basic idea is taken from devres, but as the allocation may happen
fairly frequently, some provisioning (in the form of an unused spi_device
pointer argument to spi_res_alloc) has been made so that at a later stage
we may implement reuse objects allocated earlier avoiding the repeated
allocation by keeping a cache of objects that we can reuse.

This framework can get used for:
* rewriting spi_messages
  * to fullfill alignment requirements of the spi_master HW
  * to fullfill transfer length requirements
    (e.g: transfers need to be less than 64k)
  * consolidate spi_messages with multiple transfers into a single transfer
  when the total transfer length is below a threshold.
* reimplement spi_unmap_buf without explicitly needing to check if it has
  been mapped
