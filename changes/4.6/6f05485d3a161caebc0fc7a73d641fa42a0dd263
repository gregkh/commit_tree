KVM: VMX: Fix guest debugging while in L2

When we take a #DB or #BP vmexit while in guest mode, we first of all
need to check if there is ongoing guest debugging that might be
interested in the event. Currently, we unconditionally leave L2 and
inject the event into L1 if it is intercepting the exceptions. That
breaks things marvelously.
