ARM: dts: sun7i: Add dts file for the lamobo-r1 board

The lamobo-r1 board, sometimes called the BPI-R1 but not labelled as such
on the PCB, is meant as a A20 based router board. As such the board comes
with a built-in switch chip giving it 5 gigabit ethernet ports, and it
has a large empty area on the pcb with mounting holes which will fit a
2.5 inch harddisk. To complete its networking features it has a
Realtek RTL8192CU for WiFi 802.11 b/g/n.
