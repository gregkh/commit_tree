bridge: mcast: add support for more router port information dumping

Allow for more multicast router port information to be dumped such as
timer and type attributes. For that that purpose we need to extend the
MDBA_ROUTER_PORT attribute similar to how it was done for the mdb entries
recently. The new format is thus:
[MDBA_ROUTER_PORT] = { <- nested attribute
    u32 ifindex <- router port ifindex for user-space compatibility
    [MDBA_ROUTER_PATTR attributes]
}
This way it remains compatible with older users (they'll simply retrieve
the u32 in the beginning) and new users can parse the remaining
attributes. It would also allow to add future extensions to the router
port without breaking compatibility.
