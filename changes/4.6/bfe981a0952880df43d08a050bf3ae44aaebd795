drm: prime: Honour O_RDWR during prime-handle-to-fd

Currently DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD rejects all flags except
(DRM|O)_CLOEXEC making it difficult (maybe impossible) for userspace
to mmap() the resulting dma-buf even when this is supported by the
DRM driver.

It is trivial to relax the restriction and permit read/write access.
This is safe because the flags are seldom touched by drm; mostly they
are passed verbatim to dma_buf calls.

v3 (Tiago): removed unused flags variable from drm_prime_handle_to_fd_ioctl.
