stm class: dummy_stm: Add link callback for fault injection

STM device's link callback has the power to abort master/channel
assignment by returning a negative error code. Use this in dummy
stm device to optionally abort assigning certain channel IDs.
This is useful as fault injection into the stm class core, for
testing purposes.
