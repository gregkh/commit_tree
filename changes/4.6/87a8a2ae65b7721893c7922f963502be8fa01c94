igmp: Namespaceify igmp_llm_reports sysctl knob

This was initially introduced in df2cf4a78e488d26 ("IGMP: Inhibit
reports for local multicast groups") by defining the sysctl in the
ipv4_net_table array, however it was never implemented to be
namespace aware. Fix this by changing the code accordingly.
