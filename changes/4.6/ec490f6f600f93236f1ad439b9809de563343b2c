ARM: OMAP: DRA7: Provide proper class to omap2_set_globals_tap

When commit 06c2d368fc36 ("ARM: OMAP: DRA7: Make use of omap_revision
information for soc_is* calls") introduced SoC check using
omap_revision, it missed providing DRA7 as class for initializing
the omap_version variable. Without doing this, soc_is_dra7xx() will
fail and as a result, omap4_pm_init_early never initializes the dra7
erratum for CPU power state. This causes the suspend path to fail
on DRA7 devices.
