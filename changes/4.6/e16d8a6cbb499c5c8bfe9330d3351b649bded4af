Revert "x86/mm/32: Set NX in __supported_pte_mask before enabling paging"

This reverts commit 320d25b6a05f8b73c23fc21025d2906ecdd2d4fc.

This change was problematic for a couple of reasons:

1. It missed a some entry points (Xen things and 64-bit native).

2. The entry it changed can be executed more than once.  This isn't
   really a problem, but it conflated per-cpu state setup and global
   state setup.

3. It broke 64-bit non-NX.  64-bit non-NX worked the other way around from
   32-bit -- __supported_pte_mask had NX set initially and was *cleared*
   in x86_configure_nx.  With the patch applied, it never got cleared.
