scripts/link-vmlinux.sh: force error on kallsyms failure

Since the output of the invocation of scripts/kallsyms is piped directly
into the assembler, error messages it emits are visible on stderr, but
a non-zero return code is ignored, and the build simply proceeds in that
case. However, the resulting kernel is most likely broken, and will crash
at boot.

So instead, capture the output of kallsyms in a separate .S file, and pass
that to the assembler in a separate step.
