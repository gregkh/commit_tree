ALSA: hda - Update BCLK also at hotplug for i915 HSW/BDW

The recent bug report suggests that BCLK setup for i915 HSW/BDW needs
to be updated at each HDMI hotplug, not only at initialization and
resume.  That is, we need to update HSW_EM4 and HSW_EM5 registers at
ELD notification, too.  Otherwise the HDMI audio may be out of sync
and played in a wrong pitch.

However, the HDA codec driver has no access to the controller
registers, and currently the code managing these registers is in
hda_intel.c, i.e. local to the controller driver.  For allowing the
explicit BCLK update from the codec driver, as in this patch, the
former haswell_set_bclk() in hda_intel.c is moved to hdac_i915.c and
exposed as snd_hdac_i915_set_bclk().  This is called from both the HDA
controller driver and intel_pin_eld_notify() in HDMI codec driver.

Along with this change, snd_hdac_get_display_clk() gets dropped as
it's no longer used.
