i40e: Refactor force_wb and WB_ON_ITR functionality code

Now that the Force-WriteBack functionality in X710/XL710 devices
has been moved out of the clean routine and into the service task,
we need to make sure WriteBack-On-ITR is separated out since it
is still called from clean.

In the X722 devices, Force-WriteBack implies WriteBack-On-ITR but
without the interrupt, which put the driver into a missed
interrupt scenario and a potential tx-timeout report.

With this patch, we break the two functions out, and call the
appropriate ones at the right place. This will avoid creating missed
interrupt like scenarios for X722 devices.

Also update copyright year in file headers.
