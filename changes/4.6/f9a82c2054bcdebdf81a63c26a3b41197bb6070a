HID: microsoft: Add ID for MS Wireless Comfort Keyboard

Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard has vendor specific My Favorites
1-5 keys. Linux already supports this buttons on other MS keyboards by
MS_ERGONOMY quirk. So apply MS_ERGONOMY quirk to USB PID 0x00e3
(Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Receiver 3.0A). After this
My Favorites 1..5 keys will be reported as KEY_F14..KEY_F15 events.
