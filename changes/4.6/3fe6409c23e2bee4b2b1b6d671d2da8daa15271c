dmaengine: dw: fix master selection

The commit 895005202987 ("dmaengine: dw: apply both HS interfaces and remove
slave_id usage") cleaned up the code to avoid usage of depricated slave_id
member of generic slave configuration.

Meanwhile it broke the master selection by removing important call to
dwc_set_masters() in ->device_alloc_chan_resources() which copied masters from
custom slave configuration to the internal channel structure.

Everything works until now since there is no customized connection of
DesignWare DMA IP to the bus, i.e. one bus and one or more masters are in use.
The configurations where 2 masters are connected to the different masters are
not working anymore. We are expecting one user of such configuration and need
to select masters properly. Besides that it is obviously a performance
regression since only one master is in use in multi-master configuration.

Select masters in accordance with what user asked for. Keep this patch in a form
more suitable for back porting.

We are safe to take necessary data in ->device_alloc_chan_resources() because
we don't support generic slave configuration embedded into custom one, and thus
the only way to provide such is to use the parameter to a filter function which
is called exactly before channel resource allocation.

While here, replase BUG_ON to less noisy dev_warn() and prevent channel
allocation in case of error.
