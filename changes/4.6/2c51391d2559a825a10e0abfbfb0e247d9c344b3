PCI: xilinx: Don't call pci_fixup_irqs() on Microblaze

The Xilinx AXI PCIe Host Bridge Soft IP driver was previously only
supported on ARM (in particular, on ARCH_ZYNC), and pci_fixup_irqs() is
available there.  But Microblaze will do IRQ fixup in pcibios_add_device(),
so pci_fixup_irqs() is not available on Microblaze.

Don't call pci_fixup_irqs() on Microblaze, so the driver can work on both
Zynq and Microblaze Architectures.
