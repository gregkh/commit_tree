documentation: Remove obsolete reference to RCU-protected indexes

Commit #1ebee8017d84 (rcu: Eliminate array-index-based RCU primitives)
eliminated the primitives supporting RCU-protected array indexes, but
failed to update Documentation/memory-barriers.txt accordingly.  This
commit therefore removes the discussion of RCU-protected array indexes.
