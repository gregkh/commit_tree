arm64: efi: invoke EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL to supply KASLR randomness

Since arm64 does not use a decompressor that supplies an execution
environment where it is feasible to some extent to provide a source of
randomness, the arm64 KASLR kernel depends on the bootloader to supply
some random bits in the /chosen/kaslr-seed DT property upon kernel entry.

On UEFI systems, we can use the EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL, if supplied, to obtain
some random bits. At the same time, use it to randomize the offset of the
kernel Image in physical memory.
