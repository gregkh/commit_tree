drm/dsi: Get DSI host by DT device node

MIPI DSI devices are inherently aware of their host because they share a
parent-child hierarchy in the device tree.

Non-DSI drivers that create DSI device don't have this data. In order to
get this information, they require to a phandle to the DSI host in the
device tree.

Maintain a list of all the DSI hosts that are currently registered. This
list will be used to find the struct mipi_dsi_host corresponding to the
device tree node passed to of_find_mipi_dsi_host_by_node().
