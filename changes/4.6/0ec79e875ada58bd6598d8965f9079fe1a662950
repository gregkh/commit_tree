staging/rdma/hfi1: Put QPs into error state after SL->SC table changes

If an SL->SC mapping table change occurs after an RC/UC QP is created,
there is no mechanism to change the SC nor the VL for that QP. The fix
is to place the QP into error state so that ULP can recreate the QP with
the new SL->SC mapping.
