dm: remove support for stacking dm-mq on .request_fn device(s)

Remove all fiddley code that propped up this support for a blk-mq
request-queue ontop of all .request_fn devices.

Testing has proven this niche request-based dm-mq mode to be buggy, when
testing fault tolerance with DM multipath, and there is no point trying
to preserve it.

Should help improve efficiency of pure dm-mq code and make code
maintenance less delicate.
