powerpc/eeh: Cache normal BARs, not windows or IOV BARs

This restricts the EEH address cache to use only the first 7 BARs. This
makes __eeh_addr_cache_insert_dev() ignore PCI bridge window and IOV BARs.
As the result of this change, eeh_addr_cache_get_dev() will return VFs from
VF's resource addresses instead of parent PFs.

This also removes PCI bridge check as we limit __eeh_addr_cache_insert_dev()
to 7 BARs and this effectively excludes PCI bridges from being cached.
