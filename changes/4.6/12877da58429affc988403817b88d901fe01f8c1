xfs: remove XFS_BUF_ZEROFLAGS macro

The places where we use this macro already clear unnecessary IO
flags (e.g. through xfs_bwrite()) or never have unexpected IO flags
set on them in the first place (e.g. iclog buffers). Remove the
macro from these locations, and where necessary clear only the
specific flags that are conditional in the current buffer context.
