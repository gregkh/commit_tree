hwmon: (vexpress) rename vexpress hwmon implementation

The vexpress hwmon implementation is currently just called vexpress.
This is a problem because it clashes with another module with the same
name in regulators.

This patch renames the vexpress hwmon implementation to vexpress-hwmon
so that there will be no clash in the module namespace.
