IB/hfi1: Add ASIC resource reservation functions

The ASIC block is a shared hardware resource between two devices
on the chip.  Add functions to acquire and release these resources
in a way that is safe for both multiple users on the same OS
and multiple users on different OSes, while holding the hardware
mutex as little as possible.

Reservations are noted in a scratch register in the shared region.
There are two types of reservations: per-HFI dynamic and permanent.
