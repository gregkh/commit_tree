packet: parse tpacket header before skb alloc

GSO packet headers must be stored in the linear skb segment.
Move tpacket header parsing before sock_alloc_send_skb. The GSO
follow-on patch will later increase the skb linear argument to
sock_alloc_send_skb if needed for large packets.

The header parsing code does not require an allocated skb, so is
safe to move. Later pass to tpacket_fill_skb the computed data
start and length.
