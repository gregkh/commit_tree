Thermal: Ignore invalid trip points

In some cases, platform thermal driver may report invalid trip points,
thermal core should not take any action for these trip points.

This fixed a regression that bogus trip point starts to screw up thermal
control on some Lenovo laptops, after

    Thermal: initialize thermal zone device correctly

    After thermal zone device registered, as we have not read any
    temperature before, thus tz->temperature should not be 0,
    which actually means 0C, and thermal trend is not available.
    In this case, we need specially handling for the first
    thermal_zone_device_update().

    Both thermal core framework and step_wise governor is
    enhanced to handle this. And since the step_wise governor
    is the only one that uses trends, so it's the only thermal
    governor that needs to be updated.
