Revert "USB / PM: Allow USB devices to remain runtime-suspended when sleeping"

This reverts commit e3345db85068ddb937fc0ba40dfc39c293dad977, which
broke system resume for a large class of devices.

Devices that after having been reset during resume need to be rebound
due to a missing reset_resume callback, are now left in a suspended
state. This specifically broke resume of common USB-serial devices,
which are now unusable after system suspend (until disconnected and
reconnected) when USB persist is enabled.

During resume, usb_resume_interface will set the needs_binding flag for
such interfaces, but unlike system resume, run-time resume does not
honour it.
