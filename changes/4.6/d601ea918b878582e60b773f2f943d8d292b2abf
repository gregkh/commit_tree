cxl: Support the cxl kernel API from a guest

Like on bare-metal, the cxl driver creates a virtual PHB and a pci
device for the AFU. The configuration space of the device is mapped to
the configuration record of the AFU.

Reuse the code defined in afu_cr_read8|16|32() when reading the
configuration space of the AFU device.

Even though the (virtual) AFU device is a pci device, the adapter is
not. So a driver using the cxl kernel API cannot read the VPD of the
adapter through the usual PCI interface. Therefore, we add a call to
the cxl kernel API:
ssize_t cxl_read_adapter_vpd(struct pci_dev *dev, void *buf, size_t count);
