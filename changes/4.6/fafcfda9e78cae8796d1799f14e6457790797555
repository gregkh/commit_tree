mmc: sdhci: fix data timeout (part 1)

The data timeout gives the minimum amount of time that should be
waited before timing out if no data is received from the card.
Simply dividing the nanosecond part by 1000 does not give this
required guarantee, since such a division rounds down.  Use
DIV_ROUND_UP() to give the desired timeout.
