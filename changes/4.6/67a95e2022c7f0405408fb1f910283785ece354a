bnxt_en: Need memory barrier when processing the completion ring.

The code determines if the next ring entry is valid before proceeding
further to read the rest of the entry.  The CPU can re-order and read
the rest of the entry first, possibly reading a stale entry, if DMA
of a new entry happens right after reading it.  This issue can be
readily seen on a ppc64 system, causing it to crash.
