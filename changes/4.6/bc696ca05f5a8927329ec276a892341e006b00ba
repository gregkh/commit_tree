x86/cpufeature: Replace the old static_cpu_has() with safe variant

So the old one didn't work properly before alternatives had run.
And it was supposed to provide an optimized JMP because the
assumption was that the offset it is jumping to is within a
signed byte and thus a two-byte JMP.

So I did an x86_64 allyesconfig build and dumped all possible
sites where static_cpu_has() was used. The optimization amounted
to all in all 12(!) places where static_cpu_has() had generated
a 2-byte JMP. Which has saved us a whopping 36 bytes!

This clearly is not worth the trouble so we can remove it. The
only place where the optimization might count - in __switch_to()
- we will handle differently. But that's not subject of this
patch.
