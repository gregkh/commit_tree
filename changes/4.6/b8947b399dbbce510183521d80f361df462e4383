drivers/staging/lustre: Silence warning about 'inline'

Low-hanging fruit first:

  CC [M]  drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/fid/fid_request.o
In file included from drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/fid/../include/lustre_net.h:66:0,
                 from drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/fid/../include/lustre_lib.h:64,
                 from drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/fid/../include/obd.h:52,
                 from drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/fid/fid_request.c:48:
drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/fid/../include/lu_object.h:765:1: warning: 'inline' is not at beginning of declaration [-Wold-style-declaration]
 static const inline struct lu_device_operations *
 ^

So we just swap inline and const.  272 warnings gone. :)
