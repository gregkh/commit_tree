intel_th: Update scratchpad bits according to enabled output activity

Intel TH implements a scratchpad register to indicate to the firmware
and external debuggers what trace configuration is enabled so that
everybody plays nicely together. The register is a bit field and the
bit assignment convention is described in the developer's manual.

This patch enables the driver to automatically set scratchpad register
bits according to the output configuration that's enabled.

Based on work by Yann Fouassier.
