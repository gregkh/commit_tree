clk: imx6q: fix typo in CAN clock definition

commit ee36027427c7 ("clk: imx: Add clock support for imx6qp")
introduced a regression due to a subtle typo in the 'can_root' clock
definition. The effect is that trying to configure the bitrate of the
can interfaces fails with -EDOM or produces a division by zero error
due to the clock_freq of the can serial clock being reported as '0'.
