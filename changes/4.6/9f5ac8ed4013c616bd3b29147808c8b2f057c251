agp/intel-gtt: Don't leak the scratch page

Recently discovered by enabling CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG in our CI. By the
looks of it broken since forever.

v2: Don't forget to set the scratch page back to wb (Chris). Reuse
intel_gtt_teardown_scratch_page for that (and fix it up to treat
needs_dmar y/n correctly).
