ath10k: add hw_rev to trace events to support pktlog

pktlog data is different between firmware variants (eg. 10.2 vs 10.4). To
have a unified user space script to decode pktlog trace events generated,
it is desirable to know which firmware variant has provided the events and
thereby decode the pktlogs appropriately. Hardware revision (hw_rev) helps
to determine the firmware variant sending these trace events. So add hw_rev
to trace events.
