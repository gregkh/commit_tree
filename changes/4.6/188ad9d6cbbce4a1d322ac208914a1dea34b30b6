vfio/pci: Include sparse mmap capability for MSI-X table regions

vfio-pci has never allowed the user to directly mmap the MSI-X vector
table, but we've always relied on implicit knowledge of the user that
they cannot do this.  Now that we have capability chains that we can
expose in the region info ioctl and a sparse mmap capability that
represents the sub-areas within the region that can be mmap'd, we can
make the mmap constraints more explicit.
