ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Remove 'edev' NULL check

Commit 4a3478debf36 ("ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Add jack reporting")
leads to the following Smatch complaint:

sound/soc/codecs/hdac_hdmi.c:971 hdac_hdmi_present_sense()
         warn: variable dereferenced before check 'edev' (see line 967)

As explained by Subhransu S. Prusty:

"This NULL check is not required, can be removed.

edev object is expected to be present when the present_sense is
called. This is called from places where this edev object is
already available."

So remove the evdev NULL check.
