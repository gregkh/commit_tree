bridge: allow zero ageing time

This fixes a regression in the bridge ageing time caused by:
commit c62987bbd8a1 ("bridge: push bridge setting ageing_time down to switchdev")

There are users of Linux bridge which use the feature that if ageing time
is set to 0 it causes entries to never expire. See:
  https://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/bridge

For a pure software bridge, it is unnecessary for the code to have
arbitrary restrictions on what values are allowable.
