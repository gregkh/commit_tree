i40evf: Update feature flags to reflect newly enabled features

Recent changes should have enabled support for IPv6 based tunnels and
support for TSO with outer UDP checksums.  As such we can update the
feature flags to reflect that.

In addition we can clean-up the flags that aren't needed such as SCTP and
RXCSUM since having the bits there doesn't add any value.

I also found one spot where we were setting the same flag twice.  It looks
like it was probably a git merge error that resulted in the line being
duplicated.  As such I have dropped it in this patch.
