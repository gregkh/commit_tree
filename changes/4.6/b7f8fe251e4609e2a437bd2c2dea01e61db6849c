gre: do not pull header in ICMP error processing

iptunnel_pull_header expects that IP header was already pulled; with this
expectation, it pulls the tunnel header. This is not true in gre_err.
Furthermore, ipv4_update_pmtu and ipv4_redirect expect that skb->data points
to the IP header.

We cannot pull the tunnel header in this path. It's just a matter of not
calling iptunnel_pull_header - we don't need any of its effects.
