irqchip/gic-v3: Refactor gic_of_init() for GICv3 driver

Isolate hardware abstraction (FDT) code to gic_of_init().
Rest of the logic goes to gic_init_bases() and expects well
defined data to initialize GIC properly. The same solution
is used for GICv2 driver.

This is needed for ACPI initialization later.
