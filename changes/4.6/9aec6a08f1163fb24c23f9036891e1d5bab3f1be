drm/i915/skl+: Use plane size for relative data rate calculation

Use plane size for relative data rate calculation. don't always use
pipe source width & height.
adjust height & width according to rotation.
use plane size for watermark calculations also.

v2: Address Matt's comments.
    Use intel_plane_state->visible to avoid divide-by-zero error.
    Where FB was present but not visible so causing total data rate to
    be zero, hence divide-by-zero.
