perf inject: Hit all DSOs for AUX data in JIT and other cases

Currently, when injecting build ids, if there is AUX data then 'perf
inject' hits all DSOs because it is not known which DSOs the trace data
would hit.

That needs to be done for JIT injection also, and in fact there is no
reason to distinguish what kind of injection is being done.  That is,
any time there is AUX data and the HEADER_BUID_ID feature flag is set,
and the AUX data is not being processed, then hit all DSOs.  This patch
does that.
