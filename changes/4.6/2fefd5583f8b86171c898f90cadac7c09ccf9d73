btrfs: reada: limit max works count

Reada creates 2 works for each level of tree recursively.

In case of a tree having many levels, the number of created works
is 2^level_of_tree.
Actually we don't need so many works in parallel, this patch limits
max works to BTRFS_MAX_MIRRORS * 2.

The per-fs works_counter will be also used for btrfs_reada_wait() to
check is there are background workers.
