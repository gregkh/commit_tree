drm/vblank: Use drm_event_reserve_init

Well we can't use that directly since that code must hold
dev->event_lock already. Extract an _unlocked version.

Embarrassingly I've totally forgotten about this patch and any kind of
event-based vblank wait totally blew up, killing the kernel.

v2: Pick the right base struct, someone didn't noticed that gcc was
unhappy. No bug since the addresses at least matched (Daniel Stone)
