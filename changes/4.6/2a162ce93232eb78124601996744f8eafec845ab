Btrfs: Improve FL_KEEP_SIZE handling in fallocate

- We call inode_size_ok() only if FL_KEEP_SIZE isn't specified.
- As an optimisation we can skip the call if (off + len)
  isn't greater than the current size of the file. This operation
  is called under the lock so the less work we do, the better.
- If we call inode_size_ok() pass to it the correct value rather
  than a more conservative estimation.
