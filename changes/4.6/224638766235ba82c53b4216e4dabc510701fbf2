GSO: Provide software checksum of tunneled UDP fragmentation offload

On reviewing the code I realized that GRE and UDP tunnels could cause a
kernel panic if we used GSO to segment a large UDP frame that was sent
through the tunnel with an outer checksum and hardware offloads were not
available.

In order to correct this we need to update the feature flags that are
passed to the skb_segment function so that in the event of UDP
fragmentation being requested for the inner header the segmentation
function will correctly generate the checksum for the payload if we cannot
segment the outer header.
