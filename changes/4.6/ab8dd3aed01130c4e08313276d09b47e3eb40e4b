ARM: DTS: Add minimal Support for Logic PD DM3730 SOM-LV

The Logic PD DM37xx SOM-LV devkit consists of a base board and a SOM.
While the SOM (System on Module) supports Bluetooth and WiFi, LPD did not
obtain an FCC ID, so anyone who uses it will have to go through certification.

I have only tested the Type 28 Display, SMSC9211 Ethernet, SD/MMC and basic
power management, however the overall current seems high.
