stm class: Fix unbalanced module/device refcounting

STM code takes references to the stm device and its module for the
duration of the character device's existence or the stm_source link.
Dropping these references is not well balanced everywhere, which may
lead to leaks.

This patch balances the acquisition and releasing of these two
references and annotates each site so that it's easier to verify
correctness by reading the code.
