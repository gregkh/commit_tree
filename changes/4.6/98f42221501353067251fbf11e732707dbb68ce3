ARM: OMAP3: Add cpuidle parameters table for omap3430

Based on CPU type choose generic omap3 or omap3430 specific cpuidle
parameters. Parameters for omap3430 were measured on Nokia N900 device and
added by commit 5a1b1d3a9efa ("OMAP3: RX-51: Pass cpu idle parameters")
which were later removed by commit 231900afba52 ("ARM: OMAP3: cpuidle -
remove rx51 cpuidle parameters table") due to huge code complexity.

This patch brings cpuidle parameters for omap3430 devices again, but uses
simple condition based on CPU type.

Fixes: 231900afba52 ("ARM: OMAP3: cpuidle - remove rx51 cpuidle
parameters table")
