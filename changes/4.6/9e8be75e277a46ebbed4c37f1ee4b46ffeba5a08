iio: health/afe4403: mark suspend/resume functions __maybe_unused

The newly added afe4403 driver implements suspend/resume using the
SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() macro, which leaves out references to the actual
functions when CONFIG_PM is disabled, causing a harmless warning:

health/afe4403.c:509:12: error: 'afe4403_suspend' defined but not used
health/afe4403.c:530:12: error: 'afe4403_resume' defined but not used

This marks the functions as __maybe_unused so we don't get those
warnings.
