staging: lustre: remove messages from lazy portal on NI shutdown

When shutting down an NI in a busy system, some messages received
on this NI, might be on the lazy portal.  They would have grabbed
a ref count on the NI.  Therefore NI will not be removed until
messages are processed.

In order to avoid this scenario, when an NI is shutdown go through
all messages queued on the lazy portal and drop messages for the
NI being shutdown
