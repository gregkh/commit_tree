misc: eeprom_93xx46: Fix 16-bit read and write accesses.

Compatible at93xx46 devices from both Microchip and Atmel expect a
word-based address, regardless of whether the device is strapped for 8-
or 16-bit operation.  However, the offset parameter passed in when
reading or writing at a specific location is always specified in terms
of bytes.

This commit fixes 16-bit read and write accesses by shifting the offset
parameter to account for this difference between a byte offset and a
word-based address.
