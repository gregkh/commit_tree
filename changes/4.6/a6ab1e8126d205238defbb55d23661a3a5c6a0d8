sunrpc/cache: drop reference when sunrpc_cache_pipe_upcall() detects a race

sunrpc_cache_pipe_upcall() can detect a race if CACHE_PENDING is no longer
set.  In this case it aborts the queuing of the upcall.
However it has already taken a new counted reference on "h" and
doesn't "put" it, even though it frees the data structure holding the reference.

So let's delay the "cache_get" until we know we need it.
