usb: gadget: f_midi: Fixed a bug when buflen was smaller than wMaxPacketSize

buflen by default (256) is smaller than wMaxPacketSize (512) in high-speed
devices.

That caused the OUT endpoint to freeze if the host send any data packet of
length greater than 256 bytes.

This is an example dump of what happended on that enpoint:
HOST:   [DATA][Length=260][...]
DEVICE: [NAK]
HOST:   [PING]
DEVICE: [NAK]
HOST:   [PING]
DEVICE: [NAK]
...
HOST:   [PING]
DEVICE: [NAK]

This patch fixes this problem by setting the minimum usb_request's buffer size
for the OUT endpoint as its wMaxPacketSize.
