watchdog: mei_wdt: register wd device only if required

For Intel Broadwell and newer platforms, the ME device can inform
the host whether the watchdog functionality is activated or not.
If the watchdog functionality is not activated then the watchdog interface
can be not registered and eliminate unnecessary pings and hence lower the
power consumption by avoiding waking up the device.
The feature can be deactivated also without reboot
in that case the watchdog device should be unregistered at runtime.

The information regarding the deactivation is reported
in the ping response command. In runtime case the unregistration
has to be run from a worker so that the ping initiated by the watchdog
core completes. Otherwise the flow will deadlock on watchdog
core mutex which both ping and unregistration acquire.
