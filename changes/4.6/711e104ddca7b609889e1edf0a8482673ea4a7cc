staging/rdma/hfi1: fix panic in send engine

The send engine wasn't correctly handling
pre-built packets, and worse, the pointer to
a packet state's txreq wasn't initialized correctly.

To fix:
- all waiters need to save any prebuilt packets
  (smda waits already did)
- the progress routine needs to handle a QPs prebuilt packet
  and initialize the txreq pointer properly

To keep SDMA working, the dma send code needs to see if
a packet has been built already. If not the code will build
it.
