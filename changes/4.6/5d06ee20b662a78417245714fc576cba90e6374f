modsign: hide openssl output in silent builds

When a user calls 'make -s', we can assume they don't want to
see any output except for warnings and errors, but instead
they see this for a warning free build:

 ###
 ### Now generating an X.509 key pair to be used for signing modules.
 ###
 ### If this takes a long time, you might wish to run rngd in the
 ### background to keep the supply of entropy topped up.  It
 ### needs to be run as root, and uses a hardware random
 ### number generator if one is available.
 ###
 Generating a 4096 bit RSA private key
 .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................++
 ..............................................................................................................................++
 writing new private key to 'certs/signing_key.pem'
 -----
 ###
 ### Key pair generated.
 ###

The output can confuse simple build testing scripts that just check
for an empty build log.

This patch silences all the output:
 - "echo" is changed to "@$(kecho)", which is dropped when "-s" gets
   passed
 - the openssl command itself is only printed with V=1, using the
   $(Q) macro
 - The output of openssl gets redirected to /dev/null on "-s" builds.
