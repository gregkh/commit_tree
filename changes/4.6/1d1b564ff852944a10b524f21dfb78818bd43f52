hid: thingm: reorder calls in thingm_probe

When reviewing another thingm patch Benjamin Tissoires pointed out
the following: "The problem here is that hid_hw_start() is called
before thingm_version() which allows user space to briefly introduce
races between thingm_version() and any hidraw requests.
The mutex will not help here as it is initialized after hid_hw_start()
and only used for protecting the concurrent access of the rgb."

Avoid this possible issue by calling hid_hw_start() later in the
probe function.
