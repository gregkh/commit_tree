spi: Add cond_resched() in main message processing loop

When a controller has only PIO support it is very likely that we will
run into use cases where we spend a very large amount of time consuming
CPU.  Code that does this should call cond_resched() every once in a
while to give other tasks more of a chance to run so do that in the main
SPI loop, the overhead is negligable if it's not needed.
