mtd: spi-nor: support lock/unlock for a few Winbond chips

These are recent Winbond models that are known to have lock/unlock
support via writing the Status Register, and that also support the TB
(Top/Bottom) protection bit.

Tested on w25q32dw.

[Note on style: these entries are getting pretty long lines, so I picked
a style that seems reasonable for splitting up the flags separate from
the other mostly-similar fields.]
