misc: eeprom_93xx46: Add quirks to support Atmel AT93C46D device.

Atmel devices in this family have some quirks not found in other similar
chips - they do not support a sequential read of the entire EEPROM
contents, and the control word sent at the start of each operation
varies in bit length.

This commit adds quirk support to the driver and modifies the read
implementation to support non-sequential reads for consistency with
other misc/eeprom drivers.

Tested on a custom Freescale VF610-based platform, with an AT93C46D
device attached via dspi2.  The spi-gpio driver was used to allow the
necessary non-byte-sized transfers.
