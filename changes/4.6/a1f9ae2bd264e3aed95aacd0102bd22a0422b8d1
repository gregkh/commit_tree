mei: bus: fix RX event scheduling

In this particular case this more correct and safer to check if the RX
event is set in the event mask rather than query waitqueue_active
Since the check is already performed in the mei_cl_bus_rx_event
function,  it is just required to check for its return value.
Second, since we don't have exclusive waiter wake_up_interruptible_all
is not used correctly here.
