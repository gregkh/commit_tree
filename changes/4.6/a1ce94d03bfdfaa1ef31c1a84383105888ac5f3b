ALSA: seq: Provide card number / PID via sequencer client info

rawmidi devices expose the card number via IOCTLs, which allows to
find the corresponding device in sysfs.

The sequencer provides no identifing data. Chromium works around this
issue by scanning rawmidi as well as sequencer devices and matching
them by using assumtions, how the kernel register sequencer devices.

This changes adds support for exposing the card number for kernel clients
as well as the PID for user client.

The minor of the API version is changed to distinguish between the zero
initialised reserved field and card number 0.
