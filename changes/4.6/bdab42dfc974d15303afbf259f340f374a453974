kcov: don't trace the code coverage code

Kcov causes the compiler to add a call to __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() in
every basic block.  Ftrace patches in a call to _mcount() to each
function it has annotated.

Letting these mechanisms annotate each other is a bad thing.  Break the
loop by adding 'notrace' to __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() so that ftrace
won't try to patch this code.

This patch lets arm64 with KCOV and STACK_TRACER boot.
