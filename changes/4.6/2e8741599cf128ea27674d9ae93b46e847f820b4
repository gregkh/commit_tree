firmware: arm_scpi: add support for 64-bit sensor values

SCPI specification version 1.1 extended the sensor from 32-bit to 64-bit
values in order to accommodate new sensor class with 64-bit requirements

Since the SCPI driver sets the higher 32-bit for older protocol version
to zeros, there's no need to explicitly check the SCPI protocol version
and the backward compatibility is maintainted.
