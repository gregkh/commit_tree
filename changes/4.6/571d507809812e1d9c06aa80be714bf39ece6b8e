ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Add PM support

The codec registers are reset during S3. So need to reconfigure
all pins and DP1.2 feature again after resume from S3. Also
reprogram the required registers if the S3 was triggered during
playback.

In suspended state ELD notify callback is not processed, So add
ELD check for all pins as well.

Also turn the codec power domain OFF which is kept ON during
controller resequencing and codec reenumeration.
