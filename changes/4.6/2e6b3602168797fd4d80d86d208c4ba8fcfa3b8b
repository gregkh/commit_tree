mm/slab: put the freelist at the end of slab page

Currently, the freelist is at the front of slab page.  This requires
extra space to meet object alignment requirement.  If we put the
freelist at the end of a slab page, objects could start at page boundary
and will be at correct alignment.  This is possible because freelist has
no alignment constraint itself.

This gives us two benefits: It removes extra memory space for the
freelist alignment and remove complex calculation at cache
initialization step.  I can't think notable drawback here.

I mentioned that this would reduce extra memory space, but, this benefit
is rather theoretical because it can be applied to very few cases.
Following is the example cache type that can get benefit from this
change.

  size align num before after
    32    8  124  4100  4092
    64    8   63  4103  4095
    88    8   46  4102  4094
   272    8   15  4103  4095
   408    8   10  4098  4090
    32   16  124  4108  4092
    64   16   63  4111  4095
    32   32  124  4124  4092
    64   32   63  4127  4095
    96   32   42  4106  4074

before means whole size for objects and aligned freelist before applying
patch and after shows the result of this patch.

Since before is more than 4096, number of object should decrease and
memory waste happens.

Anyway, this patch removes complex calculation so looks beneficial to
me.
