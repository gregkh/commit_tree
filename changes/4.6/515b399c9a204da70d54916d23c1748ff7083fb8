bcma: claim only 14e4:4365 PCI Dell card with SoftMAC BCM43142

It seems 14e4:4365 pattern is too generic as there are two devices:
1) 14e4:4365 1028:0016 with SoftMAC BCM43142 chipset
2) 14e4:4365 14e4:4365 with FullMAC BCM4366 chipset
The later one was found in D-Link DIR-885L router and we want to let
brcmfmac handle it.
