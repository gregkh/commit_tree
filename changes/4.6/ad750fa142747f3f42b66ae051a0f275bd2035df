Bluetooth: btbcm: Fix handling of firmware not found

If the call to request_firmware() fails in btbcm_setup_patchram(),
the BCM chip will be operating with its default firmware.

In this case, btbcm_setup_patchram() should not return immediately
but instead should skip to btbcm_check_bdaddr() and quirk setup.
