ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Enable DP1.2 and all converters/pins

Skylake supports 3 pin and 3 converter widgets. But by default
only one converter and pin widget are enabled. In skylake
platform the DP port is on a different port which is not enabled
by default. To enable playback on DP port, enable all pin and
converter widget by sending a vendor VERB for a vendor widget to
set required bits.

As we are enabling the DP support enable the DP1.2 feature as well.

Enabling DP1.2 and all widget changes are copied from patch_hdmi.c.
