igmp: net: Move igmp namespace init to correct file

When igmp related sysctl were namespacified their initializatin was
erroneously put into the tcp socket namespace constructor. This
patch moves the relevant code into the igmp namespace constructor to
keep things consistent.

Also sprinkle some #ifdefs to silence warnings
