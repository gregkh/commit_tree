ARC: dma: non-coherent pages need V-P mapping if in HIGHMEM

Previously a non-coherent page (hardware IOC or simply driver needs)
could be handled by cpu with paddr alone (kvaddr used to be needed for
coherent mappings to enforce uncached semantics via a MMU mapping).

Now however such a page might still require a V-P mapping if it was in
physical address space > 32bits due to PAE40, which the CPU can't access
directly with a paddr

So decouple decision of kvaddr allocation from type of alloc request
(coh/non-coh)
