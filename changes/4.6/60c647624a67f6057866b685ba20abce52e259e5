mmc: sdhci: factor out sdhci_pre_dma_transfer() from sdhci_adma_table_pre()

In sdhci_prepare_data(), when SDHCI_REQ_USE_DMA is set, there are two
paths that prepare the data buffers for transfer.  One is when
SDHCI_USE_ADMA is set, and is located inside sdhci_adma_table_pre().
The other is when SDHCI_USE_ADMA is clear, in the else clause of the
above.

Factor out the call to sdhci_pre_dma_transfer() along with its error
checking.
