brcmfmac: increase timeout for tx eapol

When keys get set and updated this has to happen after eapol got
transmitted (without key or old key) before the key can be updated.
To make sure the order of sending eapol and configuring key is done
correctly a timeout for tx of eapol is applied. This timeout is set
to 50 msec, which is not always enough. Especially in AP mode and
key updates the timeout may need to be much longer because client(s)
can be in powersave. Increase the timeout from 50 to 950 msec.
