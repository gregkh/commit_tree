autofs: show pipe inode in mount options

This is required for CRIU (Checkpoint Restart In Userspace) to migrate a
mount point when write end in user space is closed.

Below is a brief description of the problem.

To migrate a non-catatonic autofs mount point, one has to restore the
control pipe between kernel and autofs master process.

One of the autofs masters is systemd, which closes pipe write end after
passing it to the kernel with mount call.

To be able to restore the systemd control pipe one has to know which
read pipe end in systemd corresponds to the write pipe end in the
kernel.  The pipe "fd" in mount options is not enough because it was
closed and probably replaced by some other descriptor.

Thus, some other attribute is required to be able to find the read pipe
end.  The best attribute to use to find the correct pipe end is inode
number becuase it's unique for the whole system and can't be reused
while the autofs mount exists.

This attribute can also be used to recognize a situation where an autofs
mount has no master (no process with specified "pgrp" or no file
descriptor with "pipe_ino", specified in autofs mount options).
