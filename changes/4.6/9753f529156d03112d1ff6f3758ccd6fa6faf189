KVM: Remove redundant smp_mb() in the kvm_mmu_commit_zap_page()

There is already a barrier inside of kvm_flush_remote_tlbs() which can
help to make sure everyone sees our modifications to the page tables and
see changes to vcpu->mode here. So remove the smp_mb in the
kvm_mmu_commit_zap_page() and update the comment.
