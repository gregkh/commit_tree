HID: rmi: Check that the device is a RMI device in suspend and resume callbacks

Commit 092563604217 ("HID: rmi: Disable scanning if the device is not a wake
source") introduced a regression for devices which use hid-rmi to handle
composite USB devices. The suspend or resume callbacks are not checking
that the device is a RMI device before calling rmi_read or rmi_write.
This results in dereferencing uninitialized variables on non RMI devices. This
patch checks that the RMI_DEVICE flag is set before sending RMI commands to the
device.
