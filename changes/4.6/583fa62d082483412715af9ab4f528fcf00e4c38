scsi: ufs: add error recovery after DL NAC error

Some vendor's UFS device sends back to back NACs for the DL data frames
causing the host controller to raise the DFES error status. Sometimes
such UFS devices send back to back NAC without waiting for new
retransmitted DL frame from the host and in such cases it might be
possible the Host UniPro goes into bad state without raising the DFES
error interrupt. If this happens then all the pending commands would
timeout only after respective SW command (which is generally too
large).

This change workarounds such device behaviour like this:
- As soon as SW sees the DL NAC error, it would schedule the error
  handler
- Error handler would sleep for 50ms to see if there any fatal errors
  raised by UFS controller.
   - If there are fatal errors then SW does normal error recovery.
   - If there are no fatal errors then SW sends the NOP command to
     device to check if link is alive.
       - If NOP command times out, SW does normal error recovery
       - If NOP command succeed, skip the error handling.

If DL NAC error is seen multiple times with some vendor's UFS devices
then enable this quirk to initiate quick error recovery and also
silence related error logs to reduce spamming of kernel logs.
