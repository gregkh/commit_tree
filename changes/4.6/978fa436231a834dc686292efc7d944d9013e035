drivers: firmware: psci: unify enable-method binding on ARM {64,32}-bit systems

Currently ARM CPUs DT bindings allows different enable-method value for
PSCI based systems. On ARM 64-bit this property is required and must be
"psci" while on ARM 32-bit systems this property is optional and must
be "arm,psci" if present.

However, "arm,psci" has always been the compatible string for the PSCI
node, and was never intended to be the enable-method. So this is a bug
in the binding and not a deliberate attempt at specifying 32-bit
differently.

This is problematic if 32-bit OS is run on 64-bit system which has
"psci" as enable-method rather than the expected "arm,psci".

So let's unify the value into "psci" and remove support for "arm,psci"
before it finds any users.
