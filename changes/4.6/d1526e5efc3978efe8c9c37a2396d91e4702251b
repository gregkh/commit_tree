arm64: KVM: VHE: Enable minimal sysreg save/restore

We're now in a position where we can introduce VHE's minimal
save/restore, which is limited to the handful of shared sysregs.

Add the required alternative function calls that result in a
"do nothing" call on VHE, and the normal save/restore for non-VHE.
