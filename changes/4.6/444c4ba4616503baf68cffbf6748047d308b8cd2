cxl: New hcalls to support cxl adapters

The hypervisor calls provide an interface with a coherent platform
facility and function. It matches version 0.16 of the 'PAPR changes'
document.

The following hcalls are supported:
H_ATTACH_CA_PROCESS    Attach a process element to a coherent platform
                       function.
H_DETACH_CA_PROCESS    Detach a process element from a coherent
                       platform function.
H_CONTROL_CA_FUNCTION  Allow the partition to manipulate or query
                       certain coherent platform function behaviors.
H_COLLECT_CA_INT_INFO  Collect interrupt info about a coherent.
                       platform function after an interrupt occurred
H_CONTROL_CA_FAULTS    Control the operation of a coherent platform
                       function after a fault occurs.
H_DOWNLOAD_CA_FACILITY Support for downloading a base adapter image to
                       the coherent platform facility, and for
                       validating the entire image after the download.
H_CONTROL_CA_FACILITY  Allow the partition to manipulate or query
                       certain coherent platform facility behaviors.
