staging: wilc1000: move wilc_send_config_pkt to wilc_wlan.c

This patch moves the function wilc_send_config_pkt to wilc_wlan.c which
handles transport since the purpose of the function is sending/getting of
config information. coreconfiguator.[ch] will be rename with frame.[ch] later.
The print codes of the function is removed also and they will be implemented
with netdev_xx print format later.
struct wid need to be moved to wilc_wlan_if.h which defines configure
informations.
