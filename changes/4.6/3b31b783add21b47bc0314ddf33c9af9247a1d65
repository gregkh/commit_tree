iio: chemical: select IRQ_WORK for ATLAS ph sensor

The newly added atlas-ph-sensor driver uses irq_work_queue, which
may not always be enabled:

ERROR: "irq_work_queue" [drivers/iio/chemical/atlas-ph-sensor.ko] undefined!

This adds a 'select' statement to Kconfig to ensure it's there
when we need it.
