video: fbdev: pmag-ba-fb: Optimize Bt455 colormap addressing

Use the address autoincrement feature when accessing successive palette
entries and also skip loading a palette address in overlay register
assesses which do not use that address.  Provide a red/green/blue
register sequencer reset helper for use in overlay register assesses
where the state of the sequencer is not known.
