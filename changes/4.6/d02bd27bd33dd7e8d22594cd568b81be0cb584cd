mm/page_alloc.c: calculate 'available' memory in a separate function

Add a new field, VIRTIO_BALLOON_S_AVAIL, to virtio_balloon memory
statistics protocol, corresponding to 'Available' in /proc/meminfo.

It indicates to the hypervisor how big the balloon can be inflated
without pushing the guest system to swap.  This metric would be very
useful in VM orchestration software to improve memory management of
different VMs under overcommit.

This patch (of 2):

Factor out calculation of the available memory counter into a separate
exportable function, in order to be able to use it in other parts of the
kernel.

In particular, it appears a relevant metric to report to the hypervisor
via virtio-balloon statistics interface (in a followup patch).
