intel_pstate: Fix intel_pstate_get()

After commit 8fa520af5081 "intel_pstate: Remove freq calculation from
intel_pstate_calc_busy()" intel_pstate_get() calls get_avg_frequency()
to compute the average frequency, which is problematic for two reasons.

First, intel_pstate_get() may be invoked before the driver reads the
CPU feedback registers for the first time and if that happens,
get_avg_frequency() will attempt to divide by zero.

Second, the get_avg_frequency() call in intel_pstate_get() is racy
with respect to intel_pstate_sample() and it may end up returning
completely meaningless values for this reason.

Moreover, after commit 7349ec0470b6 "intel_pstate: Move
intel_pstate_calc_busy() into get_target_pstate_use_performance()"
sample.core_pct_busy is never computed on Atom, but it is used in
intel_pstate_adjust_busy_pstate() in that case too.

To address those problems notice that if sample.core_pct_busy
was used in the average frequency computation carried out by
get_avg_frequency(), both the divide by zero problem and the
race with respect to intel_pstate_sample() would be avoided.

Accordingly, move the invocation of intel_pstate_calc_busy() from
get_target_pstate_use_performance() to intel_pstate_update_util(),
which also will take care of the uninitialized sample.core_pct_busy
on Atom, and modify get_avg_frequency() to use sample.core_pct_busy
as per the above.
