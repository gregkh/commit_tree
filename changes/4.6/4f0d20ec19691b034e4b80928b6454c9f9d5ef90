ARM: dts: Make CPU configuration more readable on exynos542x/5800

Exynos5420 and Exynos5800 boards boot from big core (A15) but
Exynos5422 boards choose otherwise: LITTLE core (A7) (on Exynos5422 this
is property of the board - configurable by pulling up/down gpg2-1).
To make user-visible CPU ordering more consistent the 'cpus' node was
overridden by exynos5422-cpus.dtsi.

However this is a little bit ugly and error-prone. Overriding the CPU
child nodes requires to basically reverse what was done initially in
exynos5420.dtsi.

Instead, split CPU configuration entirely to separate files which should
be included by board DTS.
