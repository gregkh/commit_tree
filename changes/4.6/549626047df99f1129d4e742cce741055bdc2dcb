cgroup: update css iteration in cgroup_update_dfl_csses()

The existing sequences of operations ensure that the offlining csses
are drained before cgroup_update_dfl_csses(), so even though
cgroup_update_dfl_csses() uses css_for_each_descendant_pre() to walk
the target cgroups, it doesn't end up operating on dead cgroups.
Also, the function explicitly excludes the subtree root from
operation.

This is fragile and inconsistent with the rest of css update
operations.  This patch updates cgroup_update_dfl_csses() to use
cgroup_for_each_live_descendant_pre() instead and include the subtree
root.
