mm, page_owner: convert page_owner_inited to static key

CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER attempts to impose negligible runtime overhead when
enabled during compilation, but not actually enabled during runtime by
boot param page_owner=on.  This overhead can be further reduced using
the static key mechanism, which this patch does.
