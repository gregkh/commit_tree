cgroup: factor out cgroup_create() out of cgroup_mkdir()

We're in the process of refactoring cgroup and css management paths to
separate them out to eventually allow cgroups which aren't visible
through cgroup fs.  This patch factors out cgroup_create() out of
cgroup_mkdir().  cgroup_create() contains all internal object creation
and initialization.  cgroup_mkdir() uses cgroup_create() to create the
internal cgroup and adds interface directory and file creation.

This patch doesn't cause any behavior differences.
