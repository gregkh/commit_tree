i40evf: set adapter state on reset failure

If a reset fails to complete, the driver gets its affairs in order and
awaits the cold solace of rmmod. Unfortunately, it was not properly
setting the adapter state, which would cause a panic on rmmod, instead
of the desired surcease.

Set the adapter state to DOWN in this case, and avoid a panic.
