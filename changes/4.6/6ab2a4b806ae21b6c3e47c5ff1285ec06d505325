RAID5: revert e9e4c377e2f563 to fix a livelock

Revert commit
e9e4c377e2f563(md/raid5: per hash value and exclusive wait_for_stripe)

The problem is raid5_get_active_stripe waits on
conf->wait_for_stripe[hash]. Assume hash is 0. My test release stripes
in this order:
- release all stripes with hash 0
- raid5_get_active_stripe still sleeps since active_stripes >
  max_nr_stripes * 3 / 4
- release all stripes with hash other than 0. active_stripes becomes 0
- raid5_get_active_stripe still sleeps, since nobody wakes up
  wait_for_stripe[0]
The system live locks. The problem is active_stripes isn't a per-hash
count. Revert the patch makes the live lock go away.
