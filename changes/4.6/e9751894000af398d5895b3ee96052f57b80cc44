cpufreq: governor: Simplify cpufreq_governor_limits()

Use the observation that cpufreq_governor_limits() doesn't have to
get to the policy object it wants to manipulate by walking the
reference chain cdbs->policy_dbs->policy, as the final pointer is
actually equal to its argument, and make it access the policy
object directy via its argument.
