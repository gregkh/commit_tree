x86/platform/intel/quark: Drop IMR lock bit support

Isolated Memory Regions support a lock bit. The lock bit in an IMR prevents
modification of the IMR until the core goes through a warm or cold reset.
The lock bit feature is not useful in the context of the kernel API and is
not really necessary since modification of IMRs is possible only from
ring-zero anyway. This patch drops support for IMR locks bits, it
simplifies the kernel API and removes an unnecessary and needlessly complex
feature.
