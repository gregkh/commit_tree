bpf: introduce percpu_freelist

Introduce simple percpu_freelist to keep single list of elements
spread across per-cpu singly linked lists.

/* push element into the list */
void pcpu_freelist_push(struct pcpu_freelist *, struct pcpu_freelist_node *);

/* pop element from the list */
struct pcpu_freelist_node *pcpu_freelist_pop(struct pcpu_freelist *);

The object is pushed to the current cpu list.
Pop first trying to get the object from the current cpu list,
if it's empty goes to the neigbour cpu list.

For bpf program usage pattern the collision rate is very low,
since programs push and pop the objects typically on the same cpu.
