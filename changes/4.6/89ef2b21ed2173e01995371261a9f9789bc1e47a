ARM: KVM: Add guest entry code

Add the very minimal piece of code that is now required to jump
into the guest (and return from it). This code is only concerned
with save/restoring the USR registers (r0-r12+lr for the guest,
r4-r12+lr for the host), as everything else is dealt with in C
(VFP is another matter though).
