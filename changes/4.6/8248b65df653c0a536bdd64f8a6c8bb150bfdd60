drm/atomic: Handle encoder assignment conflicts in a separate check, v3.

The current check doesn't handle the case where we don't steal an
encoder, but keep it on the current connector. If we repurpose
disable_conflicting_encoders to do the checking, we just have
to reject the ones that conflict.

Changes since v1:
- Return early with empty encoder_mask, drm_for_each_connector
  requires connection_mutex held.
Changes since v2:
- Add comments for the loops.
