lkdtm: mark execute_location as noinline

The kernel sometimes fails to link when lkdrm is built-in and
compiled with clang:

relocation truncated to fit: R_ARM_THM_CALL against `.bss'

The reason here is that a relocation from .text to .bss fails to
generate a trampoline because .bss is not an executable section.

Marking the function 'noinline' turns the relative branch to .bss
into an absolute branch to the function argument, and that works
fine.
