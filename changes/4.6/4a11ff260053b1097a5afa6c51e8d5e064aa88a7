ASoC: davinci-mcasp: dai format runtime reconfiguration

In case when the dai format is set via the dai_link the format
configuration happens once when the links are probed. If the McASP lose
context after this, the information will be lost and McASP will not going
to work correctly.
To overcome this issue, we save the fmt and set it within hw_params as
well.
