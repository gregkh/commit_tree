usb: define USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS speed for SuperSpeedPlus USB3.1 devices

Add a new USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS device speed, and make sure usb core can
handle the new speed.
In most cases the behaviour is the same as with USB_SPEED_SUPER SuperSpeed
devices. In a few places we add a "Plus" string to inform the user of the
new speed.
