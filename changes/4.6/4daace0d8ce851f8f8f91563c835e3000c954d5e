PCI: hv: Add paravirtual PCI front-end for Microsoft Hyper-V VMs

Add a new driver which exposes a root PCI bus whenever a PCI Express device
is passed through to a guest VM under Hyper-V.  The device can be single-
or multi-function.  The interrupts for the devices are managed by an IRQ
domain, implemented within the driver.
