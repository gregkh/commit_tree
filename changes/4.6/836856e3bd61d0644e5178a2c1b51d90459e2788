wireless: cw1200: use __maybe_unused to hide pm functions_

The cw1200 uses #ifdef to check for CONFIG_PM, but then
uses SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS, which leaves the references out when
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not defined, so we get a warning with
PM=y && PM_SLEEP=n:

drivers/net/wireless/st/cw1200/cw1200_spi.c:450:12: error: 'cw1200_spi_suspend' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

This removes the incorrect #ifdef and instead uses a __maybe_unused
annotation to let the compiler know it can silently drop
the function definition.

For the DEV_PM_OPS definition, we can use an IS_ENABLED() check
to avoid defining the structure when CONFIG_PM is not set without
the #ifdef.
