iwlwifi: mvm: Do not switch to D3 image on suspend

Currently when the driver is configured with wowlan parameters, and enters
D3 mode, the driver switches the FW image to D3, and when it exists
suspend, it reloads the D0 image.

If the firmware supports the consolidation of the D0 & D3 images there is
no need to load the D3 image on suspend, and no need to reload the D0
image on resume.

Do not switch images on suspend / resume, for firmwares that support
consolidated images.
