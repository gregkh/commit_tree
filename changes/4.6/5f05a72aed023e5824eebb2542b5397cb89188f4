arm64: KVM: Move most of the fault decoding to C

The fault decoding process (including computing the IPA in the case
of a permission fault) would be much better done in C code, as we
have a reasonable infrastructure to deal with the VHE/non-VHE
differences.

Let's move the whole thing to C, including the workaround for
erratum 834220, and just patch the odd ESR_EL2 access remaining
in hyp-entry.S.
