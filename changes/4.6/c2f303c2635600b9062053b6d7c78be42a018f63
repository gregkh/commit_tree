ARM: dts: imx6q-tbs2910: add SATA PHY configuration

Configure SATA PHY transmit level, boost, attenuation and equalizer
parameters for long wire connections. TBS2910 contains a standard SATA
connector, so devices are typically connected with (longer) SATA cables.
And explicitly configuring these parameters avoids complaints about
"not specified" values in boot messages.
