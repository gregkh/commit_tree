drm/vmwgfx: Nuke preclose hook

Again since the drm core takes care of event unlinking/disarming this
is now just needless code.

v2: I've completely missed eaction->fpriv_head and all the related
code. We need to nuke that too to avoid accidentally deferencing the
freed-up vmwgfx-private fpriv.

v3: Also remove vmw_fpriv->fence_events and unused variables I missed.
