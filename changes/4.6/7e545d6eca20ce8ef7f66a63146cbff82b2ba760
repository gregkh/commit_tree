livepatch/module: remove livepatch module notifier

Remove the livepatch module notifier in favor of directly enabling and
disabling patches to modules in the module loader. Hard-coding the
function calls ensures that ftrace_module_enable() is run before
klp_module_coming() during module load, and that klp_module_going() is
run before ftrace_release_mod() during module unload. This way, ftrace
and livepatch code is run in the correct order during the module
load/unload sequence without dependence on the module notifier call chain.
