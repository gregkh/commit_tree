serial: 8250: Unlink uart console ptr if console setup fails

If console setup fails (eg., there is no valid port at that index),
unlink the console ptr; otherwise, when the driver unloads, the
console will be unregistered (even though setup, and thus registration,
failed) and a console disabled message will be printed.
