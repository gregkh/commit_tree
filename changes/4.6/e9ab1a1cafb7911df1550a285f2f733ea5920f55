powerpc: Make vmalloc_to_phys() public

This makes vmalloc_to_phys() public as there will be another user
(KVM in-kernel VFIO acceleration) for it soon. As this new user
can be compiled as a module, this exports the symbol.

As a little optimization, this changes the helper to call
vmalloc_to_pfn() instead of vmalloc_to_page() as the size of the
struct page may not be power-of-two aligned which will make gcc use
multiply instructions instead of shifts.
