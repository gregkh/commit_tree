tcp: move cwnd reduction after recovery state procesing

Currently the cwnd is reduced and increased in various different
places. The reduction happens in various places in the recovery
state processing (tcp_fastretrans_alert) while the increase
happens afterward.

A better sequence is to identify lost packets and update
the congestion control state (icsk_ca_state) first. Then base
on the new state, up/down the cwnd in one central place. It's
more clear to reason cwnd changes.
