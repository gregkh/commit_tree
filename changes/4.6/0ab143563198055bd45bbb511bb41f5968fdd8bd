f2fs: correct search area in get_new_segment

get_new_segment starts from current segment position, tries to search a
free segment among its right neighbors locate in same section.

But previously our search area was set as [current segment, max segment],
which means we have to search to more bits in free_segmap bitmap for some
worse cases. So here we correct the search area to [current segment, last
segment in section] to avoid unnecessary searching.
