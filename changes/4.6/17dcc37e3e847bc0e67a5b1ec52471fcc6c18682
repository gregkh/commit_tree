ata: ahci-platform: Add ports-implemented DT bindings.

On some SOCs PORTS_IMPL register value is never programmed by the
firmware and left at zero value. Which means that no sata ports are
available for software. AHCI driver used to cope up with this by
fabricating the port_map if the PORTS_IMPL register is read zero,
but recent patch broke this workaround as zero value was valid for
NVMe disks.

This patch adds ports-implemented DT bindings as workaround for this issue
in a way that DT can can override the PORTS_IMPL register in cases where
the firmware did not program it already.

Fixes: 566d1827df2e ("libata: disable forced PORTS_IMPL for >= AHCI 1.3")
