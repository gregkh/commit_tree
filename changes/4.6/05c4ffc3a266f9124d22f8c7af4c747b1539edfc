ARM: dts: LogicPD Torpedo: Add MT9P031 Support

The Logic PD Torpedo standard kits come with a SOM populated to us an
8-bit parallel camera interface.  This patch pin muxes the omap3-isp
pins, sets the MT9P031 clicks, and configures the i2c2 bus to communicate
with the mt9p031 on address 0x48.

I have not done a lot of testing, but when modprobing
mt9p031, then omap3-isp, the board responds with
MT9P031 detected at address 0x48.
