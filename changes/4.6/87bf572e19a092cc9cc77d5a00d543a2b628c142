nfit: disable userspace initiated ars during scrub

While the nfit driver is issuing address range scrub commands and
reaping the results do not permit an ars_start command issued from
userspace.  The scrub thread assumes that all ars completions are for
scrubs initiated by platform firmware at boot, or by the nfit driver.
