ovs: propagate per dp max headroom to all vports

This patch implements bookkeeping support to compute the maximum
headroom for all the devices in each datapath. When said value
changes, the underlying devs are notified via the
ndo_set_rx_headroom method.

This also increases the internal vports xmit performance.
