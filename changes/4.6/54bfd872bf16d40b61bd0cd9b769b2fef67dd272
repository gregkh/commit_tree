vxlan: keep flags and vni in network byte order

Prevent repeated conversions from and to network order in the fast path.

To achieve this, define all flag constants in big endian order and store VNI
as __be32. To prevent confusion between the actual VNI value and the VNI
field from the header (which contains additional reserved byte), strictly
distinguish between "vni" and "vni_field".
