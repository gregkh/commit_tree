PCI: Fold struct pci_vpd_pci22 into struct pci_vpd

We only support one flavor of VPD, so there's no need to complicate things
by having a "generic" struct pci_vpd and a more specific struct
pci_vpd_pci22.

Fold struct pci_vpd_pci22 directly into struct pci_vpd.

[bhelgaas: remove NULL check before kfree of dev->vpd (per kfreeaddr.cocci)]
