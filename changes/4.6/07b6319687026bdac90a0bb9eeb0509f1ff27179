target/iblock: pass WRITE_SAME to device if possible

This patch has iblock pass the WRITE_SAME command to
the device for offloading if possible. It is similar to what is
done for UNMAP/discards, except that we export a large max write same
value to the initiator, and then rely on the block layer to
break it up into multiple requests if it cannot fit into one.

v2.

- Drop file backend changes and move helper function to
iblock backend.
