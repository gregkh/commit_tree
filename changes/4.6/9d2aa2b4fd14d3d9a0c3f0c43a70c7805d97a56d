IB/srpt: Add parentheses around sizeof argument

Although sizeof is an operator and hence in many cases parentheses can
be left out, the recommended kernel coding style is to surround the
sizeof argument with parentheses. This patch does not change any
functionality. It has been generated by running the following shell
command:

sed -i 's/sizeof \([^ );,]*\)/sizeof(\1)/g' drivers/infiniband/ulp/srpt/*.[ch]
