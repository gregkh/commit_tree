usb: host: ehci-dbg: fix up function definitions

This patch indents not empty functions to have the opening brace at the
beginning of the next line and body conforming coding style.

This also makes the function definition consistent with the file coding
style aligning parameters in sequential lines and indenting them with
two tabs.
