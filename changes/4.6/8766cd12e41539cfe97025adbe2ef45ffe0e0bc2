staging: lustre: fix crash due to NULL networks string

If there is an invalid networks or ip2nets lnet_parse_networks()
gets called with a NULL 'network' string parameter

lnet_parse_networks() needs to sanitize its input string now that
it's being called from multiple places.  Instead, check for
a NULL string everytime the function is called, which reduces the
probability of errors with other code modifications.
