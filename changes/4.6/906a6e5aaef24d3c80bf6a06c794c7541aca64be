cpufreq: governor: Rework cpufreq_governor_dbs()

Since it is possible to obtain a pointer to struct dbs_governor
from a pointer to the struct governor embedded in it via
container_of(), the second argument of cpufreq_governor_init()
is not necessary.  Accordingly, cpufreq_governor_dbs() doesn't
need its second argument either and the ->governor callbacks
for both the ondemand and conservative governors may be set
to cpufreq_governor_dbs() directly.  Make that happen.
