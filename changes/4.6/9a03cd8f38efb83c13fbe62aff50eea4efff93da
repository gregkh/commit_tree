ipv6: per netns fib6 walkers

The IPv6 FIB data structures are separated per network namespace but
there is still only one global walkers list and one global walker list
lock. This means changes in one namespace unnecessarily interfere with
walkers in other namespaces.

Replace the global list with per-netns lists (and give each its own
lock).
