i40e: Use the new rx ctl register helpers. Don't use AQ calls from clear_hw.

Use the new AdminQ functions for safely accessing the Rx control
registers that may be affected by heavy small packet traffic.

We can't use AdminQ calls in i40e_clear_hw() because the HW is being
initialized and the AdminQ is not alive.  We recently added an AQ
related replacement for reading PFLAN_QALLOC, and this patch puts
back the original register read.
