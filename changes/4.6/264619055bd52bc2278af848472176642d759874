netfilter: Allow calling into nat helper without skb_dst.

NAT checksum recalculation code assumes existence of skb_dst, which
becomes a problem for a later patch in the series ("openvswitch:
Interface with NAT.").  Simplify this by removing the check on
skb_dst, as the checksum will be dealt with later in the stack.
