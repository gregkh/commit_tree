batman-adv: ELP - compute the metric based on the estimated throughput

In case of wireless interface retrieve the throughput by
querying cfg80211. To perform this call a separate work
must be scheduled because the function may sleep and this
is not allowed within an RCU protected context (RCU in this
case is used to iterate over all the neighbours).

Use ethtool to retrieve information about an Ethernet link
like HALF/FULL_DUPLEX and advertised bandwidth (e.g.
100/10Mbps).

The metric is updated each time a new ELP packet is sent,
this way it is possible to timely react to a metric
variation which can imply (for example) a neighbour
disconnection.
