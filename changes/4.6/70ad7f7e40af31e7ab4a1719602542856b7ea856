mmc: tegra: Disable UHS-I modes for Tegra124

Tegra124 has been randomly hanging during system suspend when entering
the Tegra LP1 low power state. The hang is caused by the Tegra SDHCI
driver and linked to the UHS-I tuning sequence. Disabling the UHS-I
modes for Tegra124 prevents any hangs from occurring when entering
system suspend.

Unfortunately, the tuning sequence described in the public Tegra
documentation is incomplete and on inspection of the current tuning
sequence that has been implemented is also incomplete and may cause
problems. In the short-term it is safer to disable UHS-I modes for now
and fix later because it would be too large of a change to simply patch
now. Therefore, disable UHS-I modes for Tegra124.
