arm64: KVM: vgic-v3: Avoid accessing ICH registers

Just like on GICv2, we're a bit hammer-happy with GICv3, and access
them more often than we should.

Adopt a policy similar to what we do for GICv2, only save/restoring
the minimal set of registers. As we don't access the registers
linearly anymore (we may skip some), the convoluted accessors become
slightly simpler, and we can drop the ugly indexing macro that
tended to confuse the reviewers.
