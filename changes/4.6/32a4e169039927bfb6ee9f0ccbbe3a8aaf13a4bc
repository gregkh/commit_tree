mm/zswap: provide unique zpool name

Instead of using "zswap" as the name for all zpools created, add an
atomic counter and use "zswap%x" with the counter number for each zpool
created, to provide a unique name for each new zpool.

As zsmalloc, one of the zpool implementations, requires/expects a unique
name for each pool created, zswap should provide a unique name.  The
zsmalloc pool creation does not fail if a new pool with a conflicting
name is created, unless CONFIG_ZSMALLOC_STAT is enabled; in that case,
zsmalloc pool creation fails with -ENOMEM.  Then zswap will be unable to
change its compressor parameter if its zpool is zsmalloc; it also will
be unable to change its zpool parameter back to zsmalloc, if it has any
existing old zpool using zsmalloc with page(s) in it.  Attempts to
change the parameters will result in failure to create the zpool.  This
changes zswap to provide a unique name for each zpool creation.
