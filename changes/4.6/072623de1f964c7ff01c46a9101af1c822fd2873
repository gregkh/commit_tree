dm: fix dm_target_io leak if clone_bio() returns an error

Commit c80914e81ec5b08 ("dm: return error if bio_integrity_clone() fails
in clone_bio()") changed clone_bio() such that if it does return error
then the alloc_tio() created resources (both the bio that was allocated
to be a clone and the containing dm_target_io struct) will leak.

Fix this by calling free_tio() in __clone_and_map_data_bio()'s
clone_bio() error path.
