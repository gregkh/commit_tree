irqchip/armada-370-xp: Add Kconfig option for the driver

Instead of building the irq-armada-370-xp driver directly when
CONFIG_ARCH_MVEBU is enabled, this commit introduces an intermediate
CONFIG_ARMADA_370_XP_IRQ hidden Kconfig option.

This allows this option to select other interrupt-related Kconfig
options (which will be needed in follow-up commits) rather than having
such selects done from arch/arm/mach-<foo>/.
