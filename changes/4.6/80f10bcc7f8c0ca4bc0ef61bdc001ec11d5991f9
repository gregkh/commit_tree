staging: rts5208: Replace pci_enable_device with pcim_enable_device

Devm_ functions allocate memory that is automatically freed when
a driver detaches.

Replace pci_enable_device with pcim_enable_device. Remove unnecessary
pci_disable_device and pci_release_regions from probe and remove
functions in rts5208 driver since pcim_enable_device contains a call
to pcim_release which contains calls to both pci_disable_device and
pci_release_regions.
