arm64: Add support for ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC

ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC provides a hook to map and unmap
pages for debugging purposes. This requires memory be mapped
with PAGE_SIZE mappings since breaking down larger mappings
at runtime will lead to TLB conflicts. Check if debug_pagealloc
is enabled at runtime and if so, map everyting with PAGE_SIZE
pages. Implement the functions to actually map/unmap the
pages at runtime.
