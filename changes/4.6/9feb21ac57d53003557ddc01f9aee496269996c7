arm64: KVM: Add access handler for event type register

These kind of registers include PMEVTYPERn, PMCCFILTR and PMXEVTYPER
which is mapped to PMEVTYPERn or PMCCFILTR.

The access handler translates all aarch32 register offsets to aarch64
ones and uses vcpu_sys_reg() to access their values to avoid taking care
of big endian.

When writing to these registers, create a perf_event for the selected
event type.
