USB: iowarrior: fix oops with malicious USB descriptors

The iowarrior driver expects at least one valid endpoint.  If given
malicious descriptors that specify 0 for the number of endpoints,
it will crash in the probe function.  Ensure there is at least
one endpoint on the interface before using it.
