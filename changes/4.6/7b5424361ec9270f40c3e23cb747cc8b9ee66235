iwlwifi: pcie: fine tune number of rxbs

We kick the allocator when we have 2 RBDs that don't have
attached RBs, and the allocator allocates 8 RBs meaning
that it needs another 6 RBDs to attach the RBs to.
The design is that allocator should always have enough RBDs
to fulfill requests, so we give in advance 6 RBDs to the
allocator so that when it is kicked, it gets additional 2 RBDs
and has enough RBDs.
These RBDs were taken from the Rx queue itself, meaning
that each Rx queue didn't have the maximal number of
RBDs, but MAX - 6.
Change initial number of RBDs in the system to include both
queue size and allocator reserves.
Note the multi-queue is always 511 instead of 512 to avoid a
full queue since we cannot detect this state easily enough in
the 9000 arch.
