hvc_xen: fix xenboot for DomUs

The xenboot early console has been partially broken for DomU for a long
time: the output would only go to the hypervisor via hypercall
(HYPERVISOR_console_io), while it wouldn't actually go to the DomU
console. The reason is that domU_write_console would return early as no
xencons structs are configured for it.

Add an appropriate xencons struct for xenboot from the xenboot setup
callback.
