drm/i915: Add an optional selection from i915 of CONFIG_MMU_NOTIFIER

userptr requires mmu-notifier for full unprivileged support. Most
systems have mmu-notifier support already enabled as a requirement for
virtualisation support, but we should make the option for i915 to take
advantage of mmu-notifiers explicit (and enable by default so that
regular userspace can take advantage of passing client memory to the
GPU.)
