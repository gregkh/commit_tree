tracing: Add needs_rec flag to event triggers

Add a new needs_rec flag for triggers that require unconditional
access to trace records in order to function.

Normally a trigger requires access to the contents of a trace record
only if it has a filter associated with it (since filters need the
contents of a record in order to make a filtering decision).  Some
types of triggers, such as 'hist' triggers, require access to trace
record contents independent of the presence of filters, so add a new
flag for those triggers.
