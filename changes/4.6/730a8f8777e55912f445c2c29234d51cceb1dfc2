i40e: Fix for unexpected messaging

This fixes an issue where a previously removed message
has returned.  Changing the message type to dev_dbg
leaves the info, if desired, but takes it out of normal
everyday usage. Also changed call to only provide port
data when its valid and not when its not (delete case).
