perf/core: Fix perf_sched_count derailment

The error path in perf_event_open() is such that asking for a sampling
event on a PMU that doesn't generate interrupts will end up in dropping
the perf_sched_count even though it hasn't been incremented for this
event yet.

Given a sufficient amount of these calls, we'll end up disabling
scheduler's jump label even though we'd still have active events in the
system, thereby facilitating the arrival of the infernal regions upon us.

I'm fixing this by moving account_event() inside perf_event_alloc().
