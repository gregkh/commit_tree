soreuseport: fast reuseport TCP socket selection

This change extends the fast SO_REUSEPORT socket lookup implemented
for UDP to TCP.  Listener sockets with SO_REUSEPORT and the same
receive address are additionally added to an array for faster
random access.  This means that only a single socket from the group
must be found in the listener list before any socket in the group can
be used to receive a packet.  Previously, every socket in the group
needed to be considered before handing off the incoming packet.

This feature also exposes the ability to use a BPF program when
selecting a socket from a reuseport group.
