staging: most: hdm-dim2: Replace request_irq with devm_request_irq

Devm_ functions allocate memory that is released when a driver
detaches. Replace request_irq with devm_request_irq to get the
interrupt for device which is automatically freed on exit. Remove
corresponding free_irq from probe and remove functions of a platform
device.

Also, remove an unnecessary label.
