module: replace copy_module_from_fd with kernel version

Replace copy_module_from_fd() with kernel_read_file_from_fd().

Although none of the upstreamed LSMs define a kernel_module_from_file
hook, IMA is called, based on policy, to prevent unsigned kernel modules
from being loaded by the original kernel module syscall and to
measure/appraise signed kernel modules.

The security function security_kernel_module_from_file() was called prior
to reading a kernel module.  Preventing unsigned kernel modules from being
loaded by the original kernel module syscall remains on the pre-read
kernel_read_file() security hook.  Instead of reading the kernel module
twice, once for measuring/appraising and again for loading the kernel
module, the signature validation is moved to the kernel_post_read_file()
security hook.

This patch removes the security_kernel_module_from_file() hook and security
call.
