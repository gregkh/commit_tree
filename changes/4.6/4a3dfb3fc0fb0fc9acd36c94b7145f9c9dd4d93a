intel_idle: Remove redundant initialization calls.

The function, intel_idle_cpuidle_driver_init, makes calls on each CPU
to auto_demotion_disable() and c1e_promotion_disable().  These calls
are redundant, as intel_idle_cpu_init() does the same calls just a bit
later on.  They are also premature, as the driver registration may yet
fail.

This patch removes the redundant code.
