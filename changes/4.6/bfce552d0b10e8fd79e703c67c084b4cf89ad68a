drivers: soc: Add support for Exynos PMU driver

This patch moves Exynos PMU driver implementation from "arm/mach-exynos"
to "drivers/soc/samsung". This driver is mainly used for setting misc
bits of register from PMU IP of Exynos SoC which will be required to
configure before Suspend/Resume. Currently all these settings are done
in "arch/arm/mach-exynos/pmu.c" but moving ahead for ARM64 based SoC
support, there is a need of this PMU driver in driver/* folder.

This driver uses existing DT binding information and there should
be no functionality change in the supported platforms.
