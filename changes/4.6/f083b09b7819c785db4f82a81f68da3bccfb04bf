dm: set DM_TARGET_WILDCARD feature on "error" target

The DM_TARGET_WILDCARD feature indicates that the "error" target may
replace any target; even immutable targets.  This feature will be useful
to preserve the ability to replace the "multipath" target even once it
is formally converted over to having the DM_TARGET_IMMUTABLE feature.

Also, implicit in the DM_TARGET_WILDCARD feature flag being set is that
.map, .map_rq, .clone_and_map_rq and .release_clone_rq are all defined
in the target_type.
