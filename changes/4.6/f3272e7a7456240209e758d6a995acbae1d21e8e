drm/i915/gen9: Correct max save/restore register count during gpu reset with GuC

In GuC submission mode, driver has to provide a list of registers to be
save/restored during gpu reset, make the max no. of registers value consistent
with that of the value defined in FW. If they are not in sync then register
save/restore during gpu reset won't work as expected.
