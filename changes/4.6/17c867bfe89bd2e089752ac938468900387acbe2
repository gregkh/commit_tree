iwlwifi: add support for getting HW address from CSR

From 9000 family on, we need to get HW address from host
CSR registers.
OEM can override it by fusing the override registers - read
those first, and if those are 0 - read the OTP registers instead.

In addition - bail out if no valid mac address is present. Make
it shared for all NICs.
