powerpc/powernv: boundary the total VF BAR size instead of the individual one

Each VF could have 6 BARs at most. When the total BAR size exceeds the
gate, after expanding it will also exhaust the M64 Window.

This patch limits the boundary by checking the total VF BAR size instead of
the individual BAR.
