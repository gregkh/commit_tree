KVM: fix spin_lock_init order on x86

Moving the initialization earlier is needed in 4.6 because
kvm_arch_init_vm is now using mmu_lock, causing lockdep to
complain:

[  284.440294] INFO: trying to register non-static key.
[  284.445259] the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
[  284.450736] turning off the locking correctness validator.

However, it also helps fixing a preexisting problem, which is why this
patch is also good for stable kernels: kvm_create_vm was incrementing
current->mm->mm_count but not decrementing it at the out_err label (in
case kvm_init_mmu_notifier failed).  The new initialization order makes
it possible to add the required mmdrop without adding a new error label.
