slub: fix/clean free_debug_processing return paths

Since commit 19c7ff9ecd89 ("slub: Take node lock during object free
checks") check_object has been incorrectly returning success as it
follows the out label which just returns the node.

Thanks to refactoring, the out and fail paths are now basically the
same.  Combine the two into one and just use a single label.
