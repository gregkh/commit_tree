staging: rdma: hfi1: Do not use | with a variable with value 0

mr->lkey has a value equal to 0. There is no need to combine it with
other things with | as for any value x, 0|x is always x.
Semantic patch used:
@@
expression x, e, e1;
statement S;
@@

  if (x == 0) {
    ... when != x = e1
        when != while(...) S
	when != for(...;...;...) S
(
* x |= e
|
* x | e
)
  ... when any
}
