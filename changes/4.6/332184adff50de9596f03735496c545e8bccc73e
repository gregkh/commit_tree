phy: rockchip-emmc: should be a child device of the GRF

The emmc-phy is fully enclosed in the general register files (GRF).
Therefore as seen from the device-tree it shouldn't be a separate platform-
device but instead a sub-device of the GRF - using the simply-mfd mechanism.

The driver entered the kernel in the current merge-window, so we can still
adapt the binding without needing a fallback, as the binding hasn't been
released with a full kernel yet.
