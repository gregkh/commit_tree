ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix DSP resource de-allocation

In PRE PMD of widget handler DSP resources are allocated after
the creation of DSP pipe and modules and in POST PMD DSP
resources are destroyed.

If there is any failure in pipe or module creation in PRE PMD,
pcm trigger fails and finally POST PMD gets called and DSP
resources are freed, without getting allocated.

Fixes the DSP resource de-allocation by allocating the resource
before creation of pipe and module in PRE PMD and in POST PMD,
free the resources.
