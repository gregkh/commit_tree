ocfs2/cluster: replace the interrupt safe spinlocks with common ones

There actually no hardware or software interrupts in the context which
using o2hb_live_lock, so we don't need to worry about race conditions
caused by irq/softirq with spinlock held.  Turning off irq is not good
for system performance after all.  Just replace them with a non
interrupt safe function.
