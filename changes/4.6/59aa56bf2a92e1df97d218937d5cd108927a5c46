xen: audit usages of module.h ; remove unnecessary instances

Code that uses no modular facilities whatsoever should not be
sourcing module.h at all, since that header drags in a bunch
of other headers with it.

Similarly, code that is not explicitly using modular facilities
like module_init() but only is declaring module_param setup
variables should be using moduleparam.h and not the larger
module.h file for that.

In making this change, we also uncover an implicit use of BUG()
in inline fcns within arch/arm/include/asm/xen/hypercall.h so
we explicitly source <linux/bug.h> for that file now.
