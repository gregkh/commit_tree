iser-target: Rework connection termination

When we receive an event that triggers connection termination,
we have a a couple of things we may want to do:
1. In case we are already terminating, bailout early
2. In case we are connected but not bound, disconnect and schedule
   a connection cleanup silently (don't reinstate)
3. In case we are connected and bound, disconnect and reinstate the connection

This rework fixes a bug that was detected against a mis-behaved
initiator which rejected our rdma_cm accept, in this stage the
isert_conn is no bound and reinstate caused a bogus dereference.

What's great about this is that we don't need the
post_recv_buf_count anymore, so get rid of it.
