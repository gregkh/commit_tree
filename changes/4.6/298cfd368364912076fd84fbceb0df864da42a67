Btrfs: Use (eb->start, seq) as search key for tree modification log

In subpagesize-blocksize a page can map multiple extent buffers and hence
using (page index, seq) as the search key is incorrect. For example, searching
through tree modification log tree can return an entry associated with the
first extent buffer mapped by the page (if such an entry exists), when we are
actually searching for entries associated with extent buffers that are mapped
at position 2 or more in the page.
