ARM: 8512/1: proc-v7.S: Adjust stack address when XIP_KERNEL

When XIP_KERNEL is enabled, the virt to phys address translation for RAM
is not the same as the virt to phys address translation for .text.
The only way to know where physical RAM is located is to use
PLAT_PHYS_OFFSET.
The MACRO will be useful for other places where there is a similar problem.
