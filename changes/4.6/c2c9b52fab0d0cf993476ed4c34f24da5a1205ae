x86/entry/32: Restore FLAGS on SYSEXIT

We weren't restoring FLAGS at all on SYSEXIT.  Apparently no one cared.

With this patch applied, native kernels should always honor
task_pt_regs()->flags, which opens the door for some sys_iopl()
cleanups.  I'll do those as a separate series, though, since getting
it right will involve tweaking some paravirt ops.

( The short version is that, before this patch, sys_iopl(), invoked via
  SYSENTER, wasn't guaranteed to ever transfer the updated
  regs->flags, so sys_iopl() had to change the hardware flags register
  as well. )
