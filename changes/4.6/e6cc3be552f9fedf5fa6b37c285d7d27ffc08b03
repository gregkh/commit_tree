arm64: dts: vulcan: Update PCI ranges

The PCI memory windows available in vulcan.dtsi are limited to 128MB
for 32-bit BARs, and 4GB for 64-bit BARs. Given the memory mapped IO
space available in arm64, these windows can be increased substantially
to support more use cases.

The change increases the 32-bit window to 256MB and the 64-bit window
to 128 GB. The firmware on vulcan boards will use these ranges as well.

PCI IO windows are not supported on Vulcan, so remove them instead of
keeping an unused value.
