KVM: Hyper-V: do not do hypercall userspace exits if SynIC is disabled

If SynIC is disabled, there is nothing that userspace can do to
handle these exits; on the other hand, userspace probably will
not know about KVM_EXIT_HYPERV_HCALL and complain about it or
even exit.  Just prevent anything bad from happening by handling
the hypercall in KVM and returning an "invalid hypercall" code.
