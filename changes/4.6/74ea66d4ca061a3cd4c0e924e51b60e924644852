tty: xuartps: Improve sysrq handling

Handling magic sysrq included dropping a lock to avoid a deadlock that
happened when cdns_uart_console_write tried to acquire a lock in the
from the sysrq code path. By making the acquisition of the lock in
cdns_uart_console_write depending on port->sysrq, cdns_uart_handle_rx can be
simplified to simply call uart_handle_sysrq.
