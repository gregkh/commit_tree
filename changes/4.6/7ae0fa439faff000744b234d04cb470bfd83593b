nfit, libnvdimm: async region scrub workqueue

Introduce a workqueue that will be used to run address range scrub
asynchronously with the rest of nvdimm device probing.

Userspace still wants notification when probing operations complete, so
introduce a new callback to flush this workqueue when userspace is
awaiting probe completion.
