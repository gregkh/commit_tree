misc: mic: MIC host and card driver changes to enable VOP

This patch modifies the MIC host and card drivers to start using the
VOP driver. The MIC host and card drivers now implement the VOP bus
operations and register a VOP device on the VOP bus. MIC driver stack
documentation is also updated to include the new VOP driver.
