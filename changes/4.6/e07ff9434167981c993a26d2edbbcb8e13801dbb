regulator: s5m8767: fix get_register() error handling

The s5m8767_pmic_probe() function calls s5m8767_get_register() to
read data without checking the return code, which produces a compile-time
warning when that data is accessed:

drivers/regulator/s5m8767.c: In function 's5m8767_pmic_probe':
drivers/regulator/s5m8767.c:924:7: error: 'enable_reg' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
drivers/regulator/s5m8767.c:944:30: error: 'enable_val' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This changes the s5m8767_get_register() function to return a -EINVAL
not just for an invalid register number but also for an invalid
regulator number, as both would result in returning uninitialized
data. The s5m8767_pmic_probe() function is then changed accordingly
to fail on a read error, as all the other callers of s5m8767_get_register()
already do.

In practice this probably cannot happen, as we don't call
s5m8767_get_register() with invalid arguments, but the gcc
warning seems valid in principle, in terms writing safe
error checking.
