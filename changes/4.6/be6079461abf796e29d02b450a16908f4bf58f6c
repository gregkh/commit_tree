xfs: Split default quota limits by quota type

Default quotas are globally set due historical reasons. IRIX only
supported user and project quotas, and default quota was only
applied to user quotas.

In Linux, when a default quota is set, all different quota types
inherits the same default value.

An user with a quota limit larger than the default quota value, will
still be limited to the default value because the group quotas also
inherits the default quotas. Unless the group which the user belongs
to have a custom quota limit set.

This patch aims to split the default quota value by quota type.
Allowing each quota type having different default values.

Default time limits are still set globally. XFS does not set a
per-user/group timer, but a single global timer. For changing this
behavior, some changes should be made in user-space tools another
bugs being fixed.
