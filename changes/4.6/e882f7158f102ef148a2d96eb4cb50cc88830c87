tty: vt: initialize softcursor_original correctly

add_softcursor() stores the contents of the text buffer position in this
variable before drawing the softcursor, whereas hide_softcursor() writes
the value back. A value of -1 means that no cursor has been drawn and
therefore no character is to be restored. softcursor_original, however,
is only implicitly initialized with 0. Therefore, when hide_softcursor
is called for the first time (console_init -> con_init -> redraw_screen
-> hide_cursor), it wrongly writes 0x0000 in the top left corner of
the text buffer. Normally, this is just as black as the rest of the
screen (vc_video_erase_char) and can't be seen, but it appears as a
black cursor rectangle on non-black backgrounds e.g. with boot option
"vt.global_cursor_default=0 vt.color=0xf0". softcursor_original needs
to be initialized with -1.
