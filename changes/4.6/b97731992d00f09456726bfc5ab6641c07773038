rmap: introduce rmap_walk_locked()

This patchset rewrites freeze_page() and unfreeze_page() using
try_to_unmap() and remove_migration_ptes().  Result is much simpler, but
somewhat slower.

Migration 8GiB worth of PMD-mapped THP:

  Baseline	20.21 +/- 0.393
  Patched	20.73 +/- 0.082
  Slowdown	1.03x

It's 3% slower, comparing to 14% in v1.  I don't it should be a stopper.

Splitting of PTE-mapped pages slowed more.  But this is not a common
case.

Migration 8GiB worth of PMD-mapped THP:

  Baseline	20.39 +/- 0.225
  Patched	22.43 +/- 0.496
  Slowdown	1.10x

rmap_walk_locked() is the same as rmap_walk(), but the caller takes care
of the relevant rmap lock.

This is preparation for switching THP splitting from custom rmap walk in
freeze_page()/unfreeze_page() to the generic one.

There is no support for KSM pages for now: not clear which lock is
implied.
