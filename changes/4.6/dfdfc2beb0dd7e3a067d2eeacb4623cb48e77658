mac80211: Parse legacy and HT rate in injected frames

Drivers/devices without their own rate control algorithm can get the
information what rates they should use from either the radiotap header of
injected frames or from the rate control algorithm. But the parsing of the
legacy rate information from the radiotap header was removed in commit
e6a9854b05c1 ("mac80211/drivers: rewrite the rate control API").

The removal of this feature heavily reduced the usefulness of frame
injection when wanting to simulate specific transmission behavior. Having
rate parsing together with MCS rates and retry support allows a fine
grained selection of the tx behavior of injected frames for these kind of
tests.
