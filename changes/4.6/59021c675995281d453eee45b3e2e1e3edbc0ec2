mac80211: TDLS: change BW calculation for WIDER_BW peers

The previous approach simply ignored chandef restrictions when calculating
the appropriate peer BW for a WIDER_BW peer. This could result in a
regulatory violation if both peers indicated 80MHz support, but the
regdomain forbade it.

Change the approach to setting a WIDER_BW peer's BW. Don't exempt it from
the chandef width at first. If during TDLS negotiation the chandef width
is upgraded, update the peer's BW to match.
