i40e: Do not drop support for IPv6 VXLAN or GENEVE tunnels

All of the documentation in the datasheets for the XL710 do not call out
any reason to exclude support for IPv6 based tunnels.  As such I am
dropping the code that was excluding these tunnel types from having their
port numbers recognized.  This way we can take advantage of things such as
checksum offload for inner headers over IPv6 based VXLAN or GENEVE
tunnels.
