i40e: When in promisc mode apply promisc mode to Tx Traffic as well

In MFP mode particularly when we were setting the PF VSI in limited
promiscuous, the HW switch was still mirroring the outgoing packets
from other VSIs (VF/VMdq) onto the PF VSI.

With this new bit set, the mirroring doesn't happen any more and so
we are in limited promiscuous on the PF VSI in MFP which is similar
to defport.

An API check is not required, since this bit is reserved for FW API
version < 1.5

Also update copyright year in file headers.
