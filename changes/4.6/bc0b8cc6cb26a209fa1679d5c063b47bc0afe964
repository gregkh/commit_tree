lkdtm: Add READ_AFTER_FREE test

In a similar manner to WRITE_AFTER_FREE, add a READ_AFTER_FREE
test to test free poisoning features. Sample output when
no sanitization is present:

 # echo READ_AFTER_FREE > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
[   17.542473] lkdtm: Performing direct entry READ_AFTER_FREE
[   17.543866] lkdtm: Value in memory before free: 12345678
[   17.545212] lkdtm: Attempting bad read from freed memory
[   17.546542] lkdtm: Memory was not poisoned

with slub_debug=P:

 # echo READ_AFTER_FREE > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
[   22.415531] lkdtm: Performing direct entry READ_AFTER_FREE
[   22.416366] lkdtm: Value in memory before free: 12345678
[   22.417137] lkdtm: Attempting bad read from freed memory
[   22.417897] lkdtm: Memory correctly poisoned, calling BUG
