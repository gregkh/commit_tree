serial: mvebu-uart: initial support for Armada-3700 serial port

Armada-3700's uart is a simple serial port, which doesn't
support. Configuring the modem control lines. The uart port has a 32
bytes Tx FIFO and a 64 bytes Rx FIFO

The uart driver implements the uart core operations. It also support the
system (early) console based on Armada-3700's serial port.

Known Issue:

The uart driver currently doesn't support clock programming, which means
the baud-rate stays with the default value configured by the bootloader
at boot time
