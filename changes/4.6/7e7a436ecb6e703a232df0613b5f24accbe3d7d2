staging/hfi1: Add TID entry program function body

The previous patch in the series added the free/invalidate
function bodies. Now, it's time for the programming side.

This large function takes the user's buffer, breaks it up
into manageable chunks, allocates enough RcvArray groups
and programs the chunks into the RcvArray entries in the
hardware.

With this function, the TID caching functionality is implemented.
However, it is still unused. The switch will come in a later
patch in the series, which will remove the old functionality and
switch the driver over to TID caching.
