cpufreq: powernv: Hot-plug safe the kworker thread

In the kworker_thread powernv_cpufreq_work_fn(), we can end up
sending an IPI to a cpu going offline. This is a rare corner case
which is fixed using {get/put}_online_cpus(). Along with this fix,
this patch adds changes to do oneshot cpumask_{clear/and} operation.
