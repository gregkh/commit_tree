staging/lustre: Get rid of object update code

Object update was originally planned to be used for cross-server
updates, so nothign to do with the client. The idea was
later significantly reworked anyway so even wire structs should
not be retained.

This gets rid of update_cmd_t, UPDATE and UPDATE_REPLY rpc and
corresponding subcommands, swabbig logic and such.
