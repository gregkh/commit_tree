bpf: don't emit mov A,A on return

While debugging with bpf_jit_disasm I noticed emissions of 'mov %eax,%eax',
and found that this comes from BPF_RET | BPF_A translations from classic
BPF. Emitting this is unnecessary as BPF_REG_A is mapped into BPF_REG_0
already, therefore only emit a mov when immediates are used as return value.
