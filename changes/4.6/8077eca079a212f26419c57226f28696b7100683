perf/x86/pebs: Add workaround for broken OVFL status on HSW+

This patch fixes an issue with the GLOBAL_OVERFLOW_STATUS bits on
Haswell, Broadwell and Skylake processors when using PEBS.

The SDM stipulates that when the PEBS iterrupt threshold is crossed,
an interrupt is posted and the kernel is interrupted. The kernel will
find GLOBAL_OVF_SATUS bit 62 set indicating there are PEBS records to
drain. But the bits corresponding to the actual counters should NOT be
set. The kernel follows the SDM and assumes that all PEBS events are
processed in the drain_pebs() callback. The kernel then checks for
remaining overflows on any other (non-PEBS) events and processes these
in the for_each_bit_set(&status) loop.

As it turns out, under certain conditions on HSW and later processors,
on PEBS buffer interrupt, bit 62 is set but the counter bits may be
set as well. In that case, the kernel drains PEBS and generates
SAMPLES with the EXACT tag, then it processes the counter bits, and
generates normal (non-EXACT) SAMPLES.

I ran into this problem by trying to understand why on HSW sampling on
a PEBS event was sometimes returning SAMPLES without the EXACT tag.
This should not happen on user level code because HSW has the
eventing_ip which always point to the instruction that caused the
event.

The workaround in this patch simply ensures that the bits for the
counters used for PEBS events are cleared after the PEBS buffer has
been drained. With this fix 100% of the PEBS samples on my user code
report the EXACT tag.

Before:
  $ perf record -e cpu/event=0xd0,umask=0x81/upp ./multichase
  $ perf report -D | fgrep SAMPLES
  PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE(IP, 0x2): 11775/11775: 0x406de5 period: 73469 addr: 0 exact=Y
                           \--- EXACT tag is missing

After:
  $ perf record -e cpu/event=0xd0,umask=0x81/upp ./multichase
  $ perf report -D | fgrep SAMPLES
  PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE(IP, 0x4002): 11775/11775: 0x406de5 period: 73469 addr: 0 exact=Y
                           \--- EXACT tag is set

The problem tends to appear more often when multiple PEBS events are used.
