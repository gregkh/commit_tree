ARM: dts: apq8064: add ahci ports-implemented mask

This patch adds new ports-implemented mask, which is required to get
achi working on the mainline. Without this patch value read from
PORTS_IMPL register which is zero would not enable any ports for
software to use.

Fixes: 566d1827df2e ("libata: disable forced PORTS_IMPL for >= AHCI 1.3")
