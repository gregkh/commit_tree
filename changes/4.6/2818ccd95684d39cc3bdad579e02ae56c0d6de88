i40e: move sync_vsi_filters up in service_task

The sync_vsi_filters function is moved up in the service_task because
it may need to request a reset, and we don't want to wait another round
of service task time.

NOTE: Filters will be replayed by sync_vsi_filters including broadcast
and promiscuous settings.

Also, added some error handling in this space in case any of these
fail the driver will retry correctly.

Also update copyright year.
