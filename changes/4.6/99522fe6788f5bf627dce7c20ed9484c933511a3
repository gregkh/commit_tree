cpufreq: Remove cpufreq_governor_lock

We used to drop policy->rwsem just before calling __cpufreq_governor()
in some cases earlier and so it was possible that __cpufreq_governor()
ran concurrently via separate threads for the same policy.

In order to guarantee valid state transitions for governors,
'governor_enabled' was required to be protected using some locking
and cpufreq_governor_lock was added for that.

But now __cpufreq_governor() is always called under policy->rwsem,
and 'governor_enabled' is protected against races even without
cpufreq_governor_lock.

Get rid of the extra lock now.
