ARM: 8538/1: decompressor: drop unneeded assignments to "targets"

The "targets" exists to specify which files need the corresponding
".*_cmd" files to be included during the build.  In other words, it
is used for files that need to detect the change of the command line
by if_changed, if_changed_dep, and if_changed_rule.  While, these
files are just copied by "$(call cmd,shipped)".  Adding them to the
"targets" is meaningless because $(call cmd,...) never creates
".*_cmd" files.  Such files as ".lib1funcs.S.cmd", ".ashldi3.S.cmd"
do not exist in the first place.
