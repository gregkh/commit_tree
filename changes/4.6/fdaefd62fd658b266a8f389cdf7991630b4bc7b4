udp: Clean up the use of flags in UDP segmentation offload

This patch goes though and cleans up the logic related to several of the
control flags used in UDP segmentation.  Specifically the use of dont_encap
isn't really needed as we can just check the skb for CHECKSUM_PARTIAL and
if it isn't set then we don't need to update the internal headers.  As such
we can just drop that value.
