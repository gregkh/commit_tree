i40e: Fix PROMISC mode for Multi-function per port (MFP) devices

This patch falls back to enabling unicast, multicast and
broadcast promiscuous mode when the driver must disable it's use
of "default port" aka defport mode (which is normally used to
provide a promiscuous mode), due to internal incompatibility
with Multiple Function per Port (aka MFP).

The situation that requires this patch is when Physical
Function 0 is the device being used, and it can support SR-IOV
when MFP is enabled, via the driver creating a VEB on an MFP
enabled adapter.
