e1000e: Clear ULP configuration register on ULP exit

There have been bugs caused by HW ULP configuration settings not being
properly cleared after cable connect in V-Pro capable systems.
This caused HW to get out of sync occasionally.
The fix ensures that ULP settings are cleared in HW after
LAN cable re-connect.
