i2c: qup: Fix fifo handling after adding V2 support

After the addition of V2 support, there was a regression observed
when testing it on MSM8996. The reason is driver puts the controller
in to RUN state and writes the data to be 'tx' ed in fifo. But controller
has to be put in to 'PAUSE' state and data has to written to fifo. Then
should be put in to 'RUN' state separately.
