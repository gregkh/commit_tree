brcmfmac: use bar1 window size as provided by pci subsystem

The PCIE bar1 window size is specified by chip. Currently the
ioremap of bar1 was using a define which always matched the size
of bar1, but newer chips can have a different bar1 sizes. With
this patch the ioremap will be called with the by chip provided
window size.
