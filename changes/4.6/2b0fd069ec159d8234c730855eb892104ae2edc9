spi: imx: drop unnecessary read/modify/write

When the MX51_ECSPI_DMA is configured we control every single bit
of the register, so there's no need to read/modify/write it. Instead
just write the value we want to have in the register. Also, drop
unnecessary check if we are actually doing DMA. The values written
to the register have no effect in PIO mode and value written there
during the last DMA transfer is still in the register, so we can
equally well always write a value.
