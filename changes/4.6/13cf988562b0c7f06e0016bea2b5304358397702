mei: prevent queuing new flow control credit.

The MEI  FW can receive only one flow control for read.
Currently the driver only checks if a flow control credit was already
sent and read is pending in the rd_pending queue, but it also has to
check if flow control credit already queued in the write control queue
to prevent sending more than one flow control credits.
