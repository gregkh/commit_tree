arm64: Enable CPU capability verification unconditionally

We verify the capabilities of the secondary CPUs only when
hotplug is enabled. The boot time activated CPUs do not
go through the verification by checking whether the system
wide capabilities were initialised or not.

This patch removes the capability check dependency on CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU,
to make sure that all the secondary CPUs go through the check.
The boot time activated CPUs will still skip the system wide
capability check. The plan is to hook in a check for CPU features
used by the kernel at early boot up, based on the Boot CPU values.
