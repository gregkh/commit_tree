staging: lustre: use sock.h in only acceptor.c

On some platforms having sock.h in lib-types.h would collide with
other included header files being used in the LNet layer. Looking
at what was needed from sock.h only acceptor.c is dependent on it.
To avoid these issues we just use sock.h only in acceptor.c.
