ipv6: replace global gc_args with local variable

Global variable gc_args is only used in fib6_run_gc() and functions
called from it. As fib6_run_gc() makes sure there is at most one
instance of fib6_clean_all() running at any moment, we can replace
gc_args with a local variable which will be needed once multiple
instances (per netns) of garbage collector are allowed.
