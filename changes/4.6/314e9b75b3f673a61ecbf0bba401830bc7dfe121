mailmap: fix Krzysztof Kozlowski's misspelled name

Patchwork introduced a garbled Polish character in commit 1e3012d0fdc5
("crypto: s5p-sss - Use memcpy_toio for iomem annotated memory") so fix
the mail mapping.  Additionally prefer to use kernel.org account for
personal work, instead of my gmail address.
