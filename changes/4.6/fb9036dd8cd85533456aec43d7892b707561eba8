staging/hfi1: check for ARMED->ACTIVE change in recv int

The link state will transition from ARMED to ACTIVE when a non-SC15
packet arrives, but the driver might not notice the change.  With this
fix, if the slowpath receive interrupt handler sees a non-SC15 packet
while in the ARMED state, we queue work to call linkstate_active_work
from process context to promote it to ACTIVE.
