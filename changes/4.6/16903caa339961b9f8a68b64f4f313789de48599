igb: Add support for VLAN promiscuous with SR-IOV and NTUPLE

This change fixes things so that we can fully support SR-IOV or the
recently added NTUPLE filtering while allowing support for VLAN promiscuous
mode.  By making this change we are able to support possible scenarios such
as SR-IOV with the PF connected to a Linux bridge hosting other VMs.
