ext4: ignore quota mount options if the quota feature is enabled

Previously, ext4 would fail the mount if the file system had the quota
feature enabled and quota mount options (used for the older quota
setups) were present.  This broke xfstests, since xfs silently ignores
the usrquote and grpquota mount options if they are specified.  This
commit changes things so that we are consistent with xfs; having the
mount options specified is harmless, so no sense break users by
forbidding them.
