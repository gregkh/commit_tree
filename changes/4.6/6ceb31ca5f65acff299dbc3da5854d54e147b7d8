VXLAN: Support outer IPv4 Tx checksums by default

This change makes it so that if UDP CSUM is not specified we will default
to enabling it.  The main motivation behind this is the fact that with the
use of outer checksum we can greatly improve the performance for VXLAN
tunnels on devices that don't know how to parse tunnel headers.
