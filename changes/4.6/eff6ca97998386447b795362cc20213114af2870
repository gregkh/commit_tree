HID: wacom: add missed stylus_in_proximity line back

Commit 7e12978 ("HID: wacom: break out wacom_intuos_get_tool_type") by accident
removed stylus_in_proximity flag for Intuos series while shuffling the code
around.

Fix that by reintroducing that flag setting in wacom_intuos_inout(), where
it originally was.
