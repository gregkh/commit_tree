ath10k: fix updating peer stats rx duration

We are not updating peer stats rx_duration periodically
unless the user one polls for fw_stats, this is because
we discard the update event since pdev list is empty. Fix
this by updating rx duration periodically irrepective of checks
for pdev list (irrespective of ping-pong response)
