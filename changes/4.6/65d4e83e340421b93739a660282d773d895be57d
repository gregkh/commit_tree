ARM: dts: qcom: Remove size elements from pmic reg properties

The #size-cells for the pmics are 0, but we specify a size in the
reg property so that MPP and GPIO modules can figure out how many
pins there are. Now that we've done that by counting irqs, we can
remove the size elements in the reg properties and be DT
compliant.
