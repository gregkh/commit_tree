[media] Revert "[media] sound/usb: Use Media Controller API to share media resources"

Unfortunately, this patch caused several regressions at au0828 and
snd-usb-audio, like this one:
	https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115561

It also showed several troubles at the MC core that handles pretty
poorly the memory protections and data lifetime management.

So, better to revert it and fix the core before reapplying this
change.

This reverts commit aebb2b89bff0 ("[media] sound/usb: Use Media
Controller API to share media resources")'
