IB/core: Add arbitrary sg_list support

Devices that are capable in registering SG lists
with gaps can now expose it in the core to ULPs
using a new device capability IB_DEVICE_SG_GAPS_REG
(in a new field device_cap_flags_ex in the device attributes
as we ran out of bits), and a new mr_type IB_MR_TYPE_SG_GAPS_REG
which allocates a memory region which is capable of handling
SG lists with gaps.
