stm class: Fix a race in unlinking

There is a window in stm_source_link_drop(), during which the source's
link may change before locks are acquired. When this happens, it throws
a warning, since this is not an expected scenario.

This patch handles the race in such a way that if the link appears to
have changed by the time we took the locks, it will release them and
repeat the whole unlinking procedure from the beginning, unless the
other contender beat us to it.
