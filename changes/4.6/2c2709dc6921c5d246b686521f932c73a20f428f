PM / OPP: Rename structures for clarity

Stephen pointed out recently, that few structures always confuse him as
they aren't named properly. And this patch tries to address that:

Names are updated as:
- device_opp or dev_opp -> opp_table
- dev_opp_list -> opp_tables
- dev_opp_list_lock -> opp_table_lock
- device_list_opp -> opp_device (it was never a list, but a structure)
- list_dev -> opp_dev
- And similar changes in comments and function names as well.

This also fixes checkpatch warnings that were generated with this patch.

No functional changes.
