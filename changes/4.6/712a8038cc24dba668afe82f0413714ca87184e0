ASoC: ssm4567: Reset device before regcache_sync()

When the ssm4567 is powered up the driver calles regcache_sync() to restore
the register map content. regcache_sync() assumes that the device is in its
power-on reset state. Make sure that this is the case by explicitly
resetting the ssm4567 register map before calling regcache_sync() otherwise
we might end up with a incorrect register map which leads to undefined
behaviour.

One such undefined behaviour was observed when returning from system
suspend while a playback stream is active, in that case the ssm4567 was
kept muted after resume.
