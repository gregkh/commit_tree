iommu/io-pgtable: Rationalise quirk handling

As the number of io-pgtable implementations grows beyond 1, it's time
to rationalise the quirks mechanism before things have a chance to
start getting really ugly and out-of-hand.

To that end:
- Indicate exactly which quirks each format can/does support.
- Fail creating a table if a caller wants unsupported quirks.
- Properly document where each quirk applies and why.
