usb: musb: core: added missing const qualifier to musb_hdrc_platform_data::config

The musb_hdrc_platform_data::config was defined as a non-const pointer.
However some drivers (e.g. the ux500) set up this pointer to point to a
static structure, which is potentially dangerous. Since the musb core
uses the pointer in a read-only manner the const qualifier was added to
protect the content of the config.
