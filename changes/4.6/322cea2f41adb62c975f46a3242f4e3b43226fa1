bpf: add missing map_flags to bpf_map_show_fdinfo

Add map_flags attribute to bpf_map_show_fdinfo(), so that tools like
tc can check for them when loading objects from a pinned entry, e.g.
if user intent wrt allocation (BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC) is different to the
pinned object, it can bail out. Follow-up to 6c9059817432 ("bpf:
pre-allocate hash map elements"), so that tc can still support this
with v4.6.
