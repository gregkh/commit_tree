rapidio: move net allocation into core code

Make net allocation/release routines available to all components of
RapidIO subsystem by moving code from rio-scan enumerator.

Make destination ID allocation method private to existing enumerator
because other enumeration methods can use their own algorithm.

Setup net device object as a parent of all RapidIO devices residing in
it and register net as a child of active mport device.
