i40e: Do not disable queues in the Legacy/MSI Interrupt handler

The queues should never be enabled/disabled in the interrupt handler,
ICR0 interrupt enable should be the only thing that needs to be
dynamically changed in the handler.

This patch fixes that. Without this patch X722 platforms were
seeing weird ping timings when in Legacy mode since it takes
a whole lot of time for the HW/FW to re-enable queues.
