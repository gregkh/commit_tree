Drivers: hv: vmbus: Cleanup vmbus_set_event()

Cleanup vmbus_set_event() by inlining the hypercall to post
the event and since the return value of vmbus_set_event() is not checked,
make it void. As part of this cleanup, get rid of the function
hv_signal_event() as it is only callled from vmbus_set_event().
