powerpc/powernv: new function to access OPAL msglog

Currently, the OPAL msglog/console buffer is exposed as a sysfs file, with
the sysfs read handler responsible for retrieving the log from the OPAL
buffer. We'd like to be able to use it in xmon as well.

Refactor the OPAL msglog code to create a new function, opal_msglog_copy(),
that copies to an arbitrary buffer. Separate the initialisation code into
generic memcons init and sysfs file creation.
