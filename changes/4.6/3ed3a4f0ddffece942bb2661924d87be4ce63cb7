mm: cleanup *pte_alloc* interfaces

There are few things about *pte_alloc*() helpers worth cleaning up:

 - 'vma' argument is unused, let's drop it;

 - most __pte_alloc() callers do speculative check for pmd_none(),
   before taking ptl: let's introduce pte_alloc() macro which does
   the check.

   The only direct user of __pte_alloc left is userfaultfd, which has
   different expectation about atomicity wrt pmd.

 - pte_alloc_map() and pte_alloc_map_lock() are redefined using
   pte_alloc().
