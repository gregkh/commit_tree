ARM: shmobile: emev2: Move declaration of emev2_smp_ops to emev2.h

make C=1:

    arch/arm/mach-shmobile/smp-emev2.c:51:29: warning: symbol 'emev2_smp_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?

To fix this, move the forward declaration of emev2_smp_ops to a header
file, and include it where appropriate.
