nfsd: Lower NFSv4.1 callback message size limit

The maximum size of a backchannel message on RPC-over-RDMA depends
on the connection's inline threshold. Today that threshold is
typically 1024 bytes, making the maximum message size 996 bytes.

The Linux server's CREATE_SESSION operation checks that the size
of callback Calls can be as large as 1044 bytes, to accommodate
RPCSEC_GSS. Thus CREATE_SESSION fails if a client advertises the
true message size maximum of 996 bytes.

But the server's backchannel currently does not support RPCSEC_GSS.
The actual maximum size it needs is much smaller. It is safe to
reduce the limit to enable NFSv4.1 on RDMA backchannel operation.
