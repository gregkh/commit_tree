drm/i915: Implement end_cpu_access

This function is meant to be used with dma-buf mmap, when finishing the CPU
access of the mapped pointer.

The error case should be rare to happen though, requiring the buffer become
active during the sync period and for the end_cpu_access to be interrupted. So
we use a uninterruptible mutex_lock to spit out when it ever happens.

v2: disable interruption to make sure errors are reported.
v3: update to the new end_cpu_access API.
v7: use .write = false cause it doesn't need to know whether it's write.
