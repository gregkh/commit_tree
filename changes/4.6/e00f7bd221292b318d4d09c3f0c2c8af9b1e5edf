virtio: Silence uninitialized variable warning

Smatch complains that we might not initialize "queue".  The issue is
callers like setup_vq() from virtio_pci_modern.c where "num" could be
something like 2 and "vring_align" is 64.  In that case, vring_size() is
less than PAGE_SIZE.  It won't happen in real life, but we're getting
the value of "num" from a register so it's not really possible to tell
what value it holds with static analysis.

Let's just silence the warning.
