This exception is being hit because the async_err interrupt path performs
an MMIO to read the interrupt status register. The MMIO region in this
case is not available.

Commit 6ded8b3cbd9a ("cxlflash: Unmap problem state area before detaching
master context") re-ordered the sequence in which term_mc() and stop_afu()
are called. This introduces a window for interrupts to come in with the
problem space area unmapped, that did not exist previously.

The fix is to separate the disabling of all AFU interrupts to a distinct
function, term_intr() so that it is the first thing that is done in the
tear down process.

To keep the initialization process symmetric, separate the AFU interrupt
setup also to a distinct function: init_intr().
