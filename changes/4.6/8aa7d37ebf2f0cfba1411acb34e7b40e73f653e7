xfs: Factor xfs_seek_hole_data into helper

Factor xfs_seek_hole_data into an unlocked helper which takes
an xfs inode rather than a file for internal use.

Also allow specification of "end" - the vfs lseek interface is
defined such that any offset past eof/i_size shall return -ENXIO,
but we will use this for quota code which does not maintain i_size,
and we want to be able to SEEK_DATA past i_size as well.  So the
lseek path can send in i_size, and the quota code can determine
its own ending offset.
