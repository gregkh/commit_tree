drm/i915: Check DDI max lanes after applying BXT workaround

In commit bfb9faab8 we added a workaround for some BXT BIOS that fail to
properly initialize the DDI_A_4_LANES bit of the control register (4
lanes is the only valid configuration on BXT since there is no DDI E to
share with).  A recent patch added some additional checks on this
register bit before the workaround gets applied; this breaks eDP on BXT
in some settings.  Some minor code shuffling is all we need to restore
the workaround.
