i2c: mux: demux-pinctrl: Clean up sysfs attributes

sysfs attributes should use the same format for reads and writes,
rather than pretty-printing on read.

* Make the "cur_master" attribute read back as just the name of the
  master
* Expose the list of all masters as a read-only "available_masters"
  attribute, using space separators as in similar attributes of other
  devices

Also, spell out "cur_master" in full as "current_master".
