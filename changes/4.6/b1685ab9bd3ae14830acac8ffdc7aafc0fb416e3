s390/cpumf: Improve guest detection heuristics

commit e22cf8ca6f75 ("s390/cpumf: rework program parameter setting
to detect guest samples") requires guest changes to get proper
guest/host. We can do better: We can use the primary asn value,
which is set on all Linux variants to compare this with the host
pp value.
We now have the following cases:
1. Guest using PP
host sample:  gpp == 0, asn == hpp --> host
guest sample: gpp != 0 --> guest
2. Guest not using PP
host sample:  gpp == 0, asn == hpp --> host
guest sample: gpp == 0, asn != hpp --> guest

As soon as the host no longer sets CR4, we must back out
this heuristics - let's add a comment in switch_to.
