serial: zs: Fix a transmit lockup in console output

Transmit interrupts are disabled and the transmit buffer drained in the
course of console output so that polled transmission is possible.  That
however causes a lost transmit interrupt as the TxIP bit in RR3 is only
set on a transmit buffer full-to-empty transition and then iff transmit
interrupts are enabled at the same time.  Consequently if console output
disturbs a regular transmission in progress, the TxIP bit is never set
again and the transmission locks up waiting for a transmit interrupt.

Fix the problem by restarting transmission manually rather than waiting
for a transmit interrupt that will never happen.
