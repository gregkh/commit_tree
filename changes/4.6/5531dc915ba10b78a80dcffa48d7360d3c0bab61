cgroup: introduce cgroup_control() and cgroup_ss_mask()

When a controller is enabled and visible on a non-root cgroup is
determined by subtree_control and subtree_ss_mask of the parent
cgroup.  For a root cgroup, by the type of the hierarchy and which
controllers are attached to it.  Deciding the above on each usage is
fragile and unnecessarily complicates the users.

This patch introduces cgroup_control() and cgroup_ss_mask() which
calculate and return the [visibly] enabled subsyste mask for the
specified cgroup and conver the existing usages.

* cgroup_e_css() is restructured for simplicity.

* cgroup_calc_subtree_ss_mask() and cgroup_subtree_control_write() no
  longer need to distinguish root and non-root cases.

* With cgroup_control(), cgroup_controllers_show() can now handle both
  root and non-root cases.  cgroup_root_controllers_show() is removed.

v2: cgroup_control() updated to yield the correct result on v1
    hierarchies too.  cgroup_subtree_control_write() converted.
