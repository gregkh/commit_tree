tcp: fastopen: call tcp_fin() if FIN present in SYNACK

When we acknowledge a FIN, it is not enough to ack the sequence number
and queue the skb into receive queue. We also have to call tcp_fin()
to properly update socket state and send proper poll() notifications.

It seems we also had the problem if we received a SYN packet with the
FIN flag set, but it does not seem an urgent issue, as no known
implementation can do that.
