macb: fix PHY reset

The driver calls gpiod_set_value() with GPIOD_OUT_* instead of 0 and 1, as
a result the PHY isn't really  put back into reset state in macb_remove().
Moreover, the driver assumes that something else has set the GPIO direction
to output, so if  it has not, the PHY may not be taken out of reset in
macb_probe() either...
