powerpc/powernv: simplify the calculation of iov resource alignment

The alignment of IOV BAR on PowerNV platform is the total size of the IOV
BAR. No matter whether the IOV BAR is extended with number of
roundup_pow_of_two(total_vfs) or number of max PE number (256), the total
size could be calculated by (vfs_expanded * VF_BAR_size).

This patch simplifies the pnv_pci_iov_resource_alignment() by removing the
first case.
