drm/i915: Seal busy-ioctl uABI and prevent leaking of internal ids

Tvrtko was looking through the execbuffer-ioctl and noticed that the
uABI was tightly coupled to our internal engine identifiers. Close
inspection also revealed that we leak those internal engine identifiers
through the busy-ioctl, and those internal identifiers already do not
match the user identifiers. Fortuitiously, there is only one user of the
set of busy rings from the busy-ioctl, and they only wish to choose
between the RENDER and the BLT engines.

Let's fix the userspace ABI while we still can.

v2: Update the uAPI documentation to explain the identifiers.
