tcp/dccp: remove obsolete WARN_ON() in icmp handlers

Now SYN_RECV request sockets are installed in ehash table, an ICMP
handler can find a request socket while another cpu handles an incoming
packet transforming this SYN_RECV request socket into an ESTABLISHED
socket.

We need to remove the now obsolete WARN_ON(req->sk), since req->sk
is set when a new child is created and added into listener accept queue.

If this race happens, the ICMP will do nothing special.
