PM / OPP: Parse clock-latency and voltage-tolerance for v1 bindings

V2 bindings have better support for clock-latency and voltage-tolerance
and doesn't need special care. To use callbacks, like
dev_pm_opp_get_max_{transition|volt}_latency(), irrespective of the
bindings, the core needs to know clock-latency/voltage-tolerance for the
earlier bindings.

This patch reads clock-latency/voltage-tolerance from the device node,
irrespective of the bindings (to keep it simple) and use them only for
V1 bindings.
