gpio: Add GPIO support for the WinSystems WS16C48

The WinSystems WS16C48 device provides 48 lines of digital I/O. In
addition, the first 24 lines may be used for interrupt-handled edge
detection; rising edge detection and falling edge detection are
supported.

This driver provides GPIO and IRQ support for these 48 channels of
digital I/O. The base port address for the device may be configured via
the ws16c48_base module parameter. The interrupt line number for the
device may be configured via the ws16c48_irq module parameter.
