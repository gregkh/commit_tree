powerpc: Fix kgdb on little endian ppc64le

I spent some time trying to use kgdb and debugged my inability to
resume from kgdb_handle_breakpoint(). NIP is not incremented
and that leads to a loop in the debugger.

I've tested this lightly on a virtual instance with KDB enabled.
After the patch, I am able to get the "go" command to work as
expected.
