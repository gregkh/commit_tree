tty: Fix ldisc leak in failed tty_init_dev()

release_tty() leaks the ldisc instance when called directly (rather
than when releasing the file descriptor from tty_release()).

Since tty_ldisc_release() clears tty->ldisc, releasing the ldisc
instance at tty teardown if tty->ldisc is non-null is not in danger
of double-releasing the ldisc.

Remove deinitialize_tty_struct() now that free_tty_struct() always
performs the tty_ldisc_deinit().
