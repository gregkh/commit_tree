KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Host side kick VCPU when poked by real-mode KVM

This patch adds the support for the kick VCPU operation for
kvmppc_host_rm_ops. The kvmppc_xics_ipi_action() function
provides the function to be invoked for a host side operation
when poked by the real mode KVM. This is initiated by KVM by
sending an IPI to any free host core.

KVM real mode must set the rm_action to XICS_RM_KICK_VCPU and
rm_data to point to the VCPU to be woken up before sending the IPI.
Note that we have allocated one kvmppc_host_rm_core structure
per core. The above values need to be set in the structure
corresponding to the core to which the IPI will be sent.
