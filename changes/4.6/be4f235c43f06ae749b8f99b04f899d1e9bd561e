drm/omap: verify that fb plane pitches are the same

The DSS hardware uses the same ROW_INC value for both Y and UV planes
for NV12 format. This means that the pitches of the Y and UV planes have
to match. omapdrm doesn't check this at the moment, and this can lead
into a broken NV12 fb on the screen.

This patch adds the check.
