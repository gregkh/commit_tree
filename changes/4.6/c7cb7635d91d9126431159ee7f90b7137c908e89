staging/rdma/hfi1: Fix QSFP memory read/write across 128 byte boundary

The QSFP memory cache reads both lower and upper page 0H in one shot,
which leads to the address counter wrapping around to the beginning of
lower page 00H at byte 128, as defined by SFF-8636.
This patch fixes this by modifying the underlying QSFP read and writes
to avoid this wrap around.
