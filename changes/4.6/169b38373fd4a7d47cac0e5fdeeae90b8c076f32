mailbox: pcc: Don't access an unmapped memory address space

The acpi_pcc_probe() may end up accessing memory outside of the PCCT
table space causing the kernel panic(). Increment the pcct_entry
pointer after parsing 'HW-reduced Communications Subspace' to fix
the problem. This change also enables the parsing of subtable at
index 0.
