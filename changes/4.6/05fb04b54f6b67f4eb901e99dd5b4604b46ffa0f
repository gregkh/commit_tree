ACPICA: Remove unnecessary arguments to ACPI_INFO

ACPICA commit 181f56605a771e0b91e24b0648d2565ca70bea20

This is used as a purely infomation message, without module name
and line number information. Therefore, these arguments are
not needed and they are unnecessary overhead.
Arguments are removed.
ACPICA BZ 872.
