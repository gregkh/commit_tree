be2net: don't report EVB for older chipsets when SR-IOV is disabled

The EVB (virtual bridge) functionality should be disabled on older BE3
and Lancer chips if SR-IOV is disabled in the NIC's BIOS. This setting
is identified by the zero value of total VFs reported by the card.
The GET_HSW_CONFIG command cannot be used as it is not supported by
these older chipset's FW.
