sctp: keep fragmentation point aligned to word size

If the user supply a different fragmentation point or if there is a
network header that cause it to not be aligned, force it to be aligned.

Fragmentation point at a value that is not aligned is not optimal.  It
causes extra padding to be used and has just no pros.

v2:
 - Make use of the new WORD_TRUNC macro
