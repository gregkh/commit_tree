ARM: 8571/1: nommu: fix PMSAv7 setup

Commit 1c2f87c (ARM: 8025/1: Get rid of meminfo) broke the support for
MPU on ARMv7-R. This patch adapts the code inside CONFIG_ARM_MPU to use
memblocks appropriately.

MPU initialisation only uses the first memory region, and removes all
subsequent ones. Because looping over all regions that need removal is
inefficient, and memblock_remove already handles memory ranges, we can
flatten the 'for_each_memblock' part.
