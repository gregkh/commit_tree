bpf: introduce BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE

add new map type to store stack traces and corresponding helper
bpf_get_stackid(ctx, map, flags) - walk user or kernel stack and return id
@ctx: struct pt_regs*
@map: pointer to stack_trace map
@flags: bits 0-7 - numer of stack frames to skip
        bit 8 - collect user stack instead of kernel
        bit 9 - compare stacks by hash only
        bit 10 - if two different stacks hash into the same stackid
                 discard old
        other bits - reserved
Return: >= 0 stackid on success or negative error

stackid is a 32-bit integer handle that can be further combined with
other data (including other stackid) and used as a key into maps.

Userspace will access stackmap using standard lookup/delete syscall commands to
retrieve full stack trace for given stackid.
