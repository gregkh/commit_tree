[media] v4l: Add generic pipeline power management code

When the Media controller framework was merged, it was decided not to add
pipeline power management code for it was not seen generic. As a result, a
number of drivers have copied the same piece of code, with same bugfixes
done to them at different points of time (or not at all).

Add these functions to V4L2. Their use is optional for drivers.
