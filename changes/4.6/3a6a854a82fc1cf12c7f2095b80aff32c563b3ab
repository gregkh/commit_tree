xfs: dynamically switch modes when XFS_DIFLAG2_DAX is set/cleared

When we set or clear the XFS_DIFLAG2_DAX flag, we should also
set/clear the S_DAX flag in the VFS inode. To do this, we need to
ensure that we first flush and remove any cached entries in the
radix tree to ensure the correct data access method is used when we
next try to read or write data. We ahve to be especially careful
here to lock out page faults so they don't race with the flush and
invalidation before we change the access mode.
