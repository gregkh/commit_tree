mm/mprotect.c: don't imply PROT_EXEC on non-exec fs

The mprotect(PROT_READ) fails when called by the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC
binary on a memory mapped file located on non-exec fs.  The mprotect
does not check whether fs is _executable_ or not.  The PROT_EXEC flag is
set automatically even if a memory mapped file is located on non-exec
fs.  Fix it by checking whether a memory mapped file is located on a
non-exec fs.  If so the PROT_EXEC is not implied by the PROT_READ.  The
implementation uses the VM_MAYEXEC flag set properly in mmap.  Now it is
consistent with mmap.

I did the isolated tests (PT_GNU_STACK X/NX, multiple VMAs, X/NX fs).  I
also patched the official 3.19.0-47-generic Ubuntu 14.04 kernel and it
seems to work.
