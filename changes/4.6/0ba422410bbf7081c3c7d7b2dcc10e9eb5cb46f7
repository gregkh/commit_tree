net/mlx5: Fix global UAR mapping

Avoid double mapping of io mapped memory, Device page may be
mapped to non-cached(NC) or to write-combining(WC).
The code before this fix tries to map it both to WC and NC
contrary to what stated in Intel's software developer manual.

Here we remove the global WC mapping of all UARS
"dev->priv.bf_mapping", since UAR mapping should be decided
per UAR (e.g we want different mappings for EQs, CQs vs QPs).

Caller will now have to choose whether to map via
write-combining API or not.

mlx5e SQs will choose write-combining in order to perform
BlueFlame writes.
