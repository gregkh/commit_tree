Drivers: hv: util: Pass the channel information during the init call

Pass the channel information to the util drivers that need to defer
reading the channel while they are processing a request. This would address
the following issue reported by Vitaly:

Commit 3cace4a61610 ("Drivers: hv: utils: run polling callback always in
interrupt context") removed direct *_transaction.state = HVUTIL_READY
assignments from *_handle_handshake() functions introducing the following
race: if a userspace daemon connects before we get first non-negotiation
request from the server hv_poll_channel() won't set transaction state to
HVUTIL_READY as (!channel) condition will fail, we set it to non-NULL on
the first real request from the server.
