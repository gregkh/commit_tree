clk: rockchip: rk3368: fix cpuclk core dividers

Similar to commit 9880d4277f6a ("clk: rockchip: fix rk3288 cpuclk core
dividers") it seems the cpuclk dividers are one to high on the rk3368
as well.

And again similar to the previous fix, we opt to make the divider list
contain the values to be written to use the same paradigm for them on all
supported socs.
