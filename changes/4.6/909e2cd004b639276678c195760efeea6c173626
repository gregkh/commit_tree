IB/hfi1: Notify remove MMU/RB callback of calling context

Tell the remove MMU/RB callback if it's being called as
part of a memory invalidation or not. This can be important
in preventing a deadlock if the remove callback attempts to
take the map_sem semaphore because the kernel's MMU
invalidation functions have already taken it.
