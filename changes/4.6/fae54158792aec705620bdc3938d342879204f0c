coresight: coresight_unregister() function cleanup

In its current form the code never frees csdev->refcnt allocated
in coresight_register().  There is also a problem with csdev->conns
that is freed before device_unregister() rather than in the device
release function.

This patch addresses both issues by moving kfree(csdev->conns) to
coresight_device_release() and freeing csdev->refcnt, also in
the same function.
