drm/i915: Clear shared dpll based on old state, v2.

Atomic resume was preserving the dpll state because it was required
for clearing pll state correctly. If we look at the old_crtc_state
for pll to clear this is not needed and the hack can be removed.

Changes since v1:
- Rename dpll variable to old_dpll. (Ville)
