tipc: remove incorrect check for subscription timeout value

Until now, during subscription creation we set sub->timeout by
converting the timeout request value in milliseconds to jiffies.
This is followed by setting the timeout value in the timer if
sub->timeout != TIPC_WAIT_FOREVER.

For a subscription create request with a timeout value of
TIPC_WAIT_FOREVER, msecs_to_jiffies(TIPC_WAIT_FOREVER)
returns MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET (0xfffffffe). This is not equal to
TIPC_WAIT_FOREVER (0xffffffff).

In this commit, we remove this check.
