zram: revive swap_slot_free_notify

Commit b430e9d1c6d4 ("remove compressed copy from zram in-memory")
applied swap_slot_free_notify call in *end_swap_bio_read* to remove
duplicated memory between zram and memory.

However, with the introduction of rw_page in zram: 8c7f01025f7b ("zram:
implement rw_page operation of zram"), it became void because rw_page
doesn't need bio.

Memory footprint is really important in embedded platforms which have
small memory, for example, 512M) recently because it could start to kill
processes if memory footprint exceeds some threshold by LMK or some
similar memory management modules.

This patch restores the function for rw_page, thereby eliminating this
duplication.
