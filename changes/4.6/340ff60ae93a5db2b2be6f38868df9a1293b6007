crypto: talitos - fix AEAD tcrypt tests

After conversion to new AEAD interface, tcrypt tests fail as follows:

[...]
[    1.145414] alg: aead: Test 1 failed on encryption for authenc-hmac-sha1-cbc-aes-talitos
[    1.153564] 00000000: 53 69 6e 67 6c 65 20 62 6c 6f 63 6b 20 6d 73 67
[    1.160041] 00000010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
[    1.166509] 00000020: 00 00 00 00
[...]

Fix them by providing the correct cipher in & cipher out pointers,
i.e. must skip over associated data in src and dst S/G.

While here, fix a problem with the HW S/G table index usage:
tbl_off must be updated after the pointer to the table entries is set.
