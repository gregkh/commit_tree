mm: memcontrol: make tree_{stat,events} fetch all stats

Currently, tree_{stat,events} helpers can only get one stat index at a
time, so when there are a lot of stats to be reported one has to call it
over and over again (see memory_stat_show).  This is neither effective,
nor does it look good.  Instead, let's make these helpers take a
snapshot of all available counters.
