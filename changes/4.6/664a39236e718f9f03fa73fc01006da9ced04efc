watchdog: Introduce hardware maximum heartbeat in watchdog core

Introduce an optional hardware maximum heartbeat in the watchdog core.
The hardware maximum heartbeat can be lower than the maximum timeout.

Drivers can set the maximum hardware heartbeat value in the watchdog data
structure. If the configured timeout exceeds the maximum hardware heartbeat,
the watchdog core enables a timer function to assist sending keepalive
requests to the watchdog driver.
