usb: ohci-at91: use __maybe_unused to hide pm functions

The ohci-at91 driver uses #ifdef to check for CONFIG_PM, but then
uses SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS, which leaves the references out when
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is not defined, so we get a warning with
PM=y && PM_SLEEP=n:

drivers/usb/host/ohci-at91.c:587:1: error: 'ohci_hcd_at91_drv_suspend' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
drivers/usb/host/ohci-at91.c:631:12: error: 'ohci_hcd_at91_drv_resume' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

This removes the incorrect #ifdef and instead uses a __maybe_unused
annotation to let the compiler know it can silently drop
the function definition.
