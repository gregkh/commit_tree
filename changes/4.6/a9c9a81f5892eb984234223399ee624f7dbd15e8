i40e/i40evf: Drop outer checksum offload that was not requested

The i40e and i40evf drivers contained code for inserting an outer checksum
on UDP tunnels.  The issue however is that the upper levels of the stack
never requested such an offload and it results in possible errors.

In addition the same logic was being applied to the Rx side where it was
attempting to validate the outer checksum, but the logic there was
incorrect in that it was testing for the resultant sum to be equal to the
header checksum instead of being equal to 0.

Since this code is so massively flawed, and doing things that we didn't ask
for it to do I am just dropping it, and will bring it back later to use as
an offload for SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM which can make use of such a
feature.

As far as the Rx feature I am dropping it completely since it would need to
be massively expanded and applied to IPv4 and IPv6 checksums for all parts,
not just the one that supports Tx checksum offload for the outer.
