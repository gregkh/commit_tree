tracing: Don't display trigger file for events that can't be enabled

Currently register functions for events will be called
through the 'reg' field of event class directly without
any check when seting up triggers.

Triggers for events that don't support register through
debug fs (events under events/ftrace are for trace-cmd to
read event format, and most of them don't have a register
function except events/ftrace/functionx) can't be enabled
at all, and an oops will be hit when setting up trigger
for those events, so just not creating them is an easy way
to avoid the oops.
