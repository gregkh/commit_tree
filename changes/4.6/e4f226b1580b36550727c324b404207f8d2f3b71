powerpc/perf/hv-gpci: Increase request buffer size

The GPCI hcall allows for a 4K buffer but we limit the buffer to 1K.
The problem with a 1K buffer is if a request results in returning
more values than can be accomodated in the 1K buffer the request will
fail.

The buffer we are using is currently allocated on the stack and hence
limited in size. Instead use a per-CPU 4K buffer like we do with 24x7
counters (hv-24x7.c).

While here, rename the macro GPCI_MAX_DATA_BYTES to HGPCI_MAX_DATA_BYTES
for consistency with 24x7 counters.
