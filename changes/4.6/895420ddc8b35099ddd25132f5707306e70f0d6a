staging/rdma/hfi1: Remove hfi1 MR and hfi1 specific qp type

This patch does the actual removal of the queue pair from the hfi1 driver
along with a number of dependent data structures. These were moved to rvt.

It also removes the MR functions to use those in rdmavt.

These two pieces can not reasonably be split apart becuase they depend on
each other.
