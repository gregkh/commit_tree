PM / clk: Add support for obtaining clocks from device-tree

The PM clocks framework requires clients to pass either a con-id or a
valid clk pointer in order to add a clock to a device. Add a new
function of_pm_clk_add_clks() to allows device clocks to be retrieved
from device-tree and populated for a given device. Note that it is
not necessary to make the compilation of this new function dependent
upon CONFIG_OF because there are stubs functions for the device-tree
APIs used.

In order to handle errors encountered when adding clocks from
device-tree, add a function pm_clk_remove_clk() to remove any clocks
(using a pointer to the clk structure) that have been added
successfully before the error occurred.
