e1000: Do not overestimate descriptor counts in Tx pre-check

The current code path is capable of grossly overestimating the number of
descriptors needed to transmit a new frame.  This specifically occurs if
the skb contains a number of 4K pages.  The issue is that the logic for
determining the descriptors needed is ((S) >> (X)) + 1.  When X is 12 it
means that we were indicating that we required 2 descriptors for each 4K
page when we only needed one.

This change corrects this by instead adding (1 << (X)) - 1 to the S value
instead of adding 1 after the fact.  This way we get an accurate descriptor
needed count as we are essentially doing a DIV_ROUNDUP().
