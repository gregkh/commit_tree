virtio: Add improved queue allocation API

This leaves vring_new_virtqueue alone for compatbility, but it
adds two new improved APIs:

vring_create_virtqueue: Creates a virtqueue backed by automatically
allocated coherent memory.  (Some day it this could be extended to
support non-coherent memory, too, if there ends up being a platform
on which it's worthwhile.)

__vring_new_virtqueue: Creates a virtqueue with a manually-specified
layout.  This should allow mic_virtio to work much more cleanly.
