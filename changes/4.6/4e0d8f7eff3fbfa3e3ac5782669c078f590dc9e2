resource: Change __request_region to inherit from immediate parent

__request_region() sets 'flags' of a new resource from @parent
as it inherits the parent's attribute.  When a target resource
has a conflict, this function inserts the new resource entry
under the conflicted entry by updating @parent.  In this case,
the new resource entry needs to inherit attribute from the updated
parent.  This conflict is a typical case since __request_region()
is used to allocate a new resource from a specific resource range.

For instance, request_mem_region() calls __request_region() with
@parent set to &iomem_resource, which is the root entry of the
whole iomem range.  When this request results in inserting a new
entry "DEV-A" under "BUS-1", "DEV-A" needs to inherit from the
immediate parent "BUS-1" as it holds specific attribute for the
range.

root (&iomem_resource)
 :
 + "BUS-1"
    + "DEV-A"

Change __request_region() to set 'flags' and 'desc' of a new entry
from the immediate parent.
