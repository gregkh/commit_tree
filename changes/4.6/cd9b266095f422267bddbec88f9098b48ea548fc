tcp: add tcpi_min_rtt and tcpi_notsent_bytes to tcp_info

tcpi_min_rtt reports the minimal rtt observed by TCP stack for the flow,
in usec unit. Might be ~0U if not yet known.

tcpi_notsent_bytes reports the amount of bytes in the write queue that
were not yet sent.

This is done in a single patch to not add a temporary 32bit padding hole
in tcp_info.
