mac80211: fix ibss scan parameters

When joining IBSS a full scan should be initiated in order to search
for existing cell, unless the fixed_channel parameter was set.
A default channel to create the IBSS on if no cell was found is
provided as well.
However - a scan is initiated only on the default channel provided
regardless of whether ifibss->fixed_channel is set or not, with the
obvious result of the cell not joining existing IBSS cell that is
on another channel.
