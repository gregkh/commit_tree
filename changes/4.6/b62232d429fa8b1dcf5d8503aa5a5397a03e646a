ALSA: hda - Limit i915 HDMI binding only for HSW and later

It turned out that the pre-HSW Intel chips are incompatible with the
naive assumption we had -- the fixed mapping between the port and the
HD-audio widget.  This may result in the bad access, as captured by
the recent patch to add a WARN_ON() for the port mapping check.

As a quick workaround, disable the i915 audio component binding for
all pre-Haswell models.
