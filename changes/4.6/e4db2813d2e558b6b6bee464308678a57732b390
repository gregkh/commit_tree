cpufreq: governor: Avoid atomic operations in hot paths

Rework the handling of work items by dbs_update_util_handler() and
dbs_work_handler() so the former (which is executed in scheduler
paths) only uses atomic operations when absolutely necessary.  That
is, when the policy is shared and dbs_update_util_handler() has
already decided that this is the time to queue up a work item.

In particular, this avoids the atomic ops entirely on platforms where
policy objects are never shared.
