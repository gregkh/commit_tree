iio: Add IIO support for the DAC on the Apex Embedded Systems STX104

The Apex Embedded Systems STX104 is a 16-channel 16-bit analog input and
2-channel 16-bit analog output PC/104 card. The STX104 incorporates a
large one mega-sample FIFO.

This driver provides IIO support for the 2-channel DAC on the STX104.
The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the "base"
module parameter array.
