aacraid: Set correct msix count for EEH recovery

During EEH recovery number of online CPU's might change thereby changing
the number of MSIx vectors. Since each fib is allocated to a vector,
changes in the number of vectors causes fib to be sent thru invalid
vectors.In addition the correct number of MSIx vectors is not updated in
the INIT struct sent to the controller, when it is reinitialized.

Fixed by reassigning vectors to fibs based on the updated number of MSIx
vectors and updating the INIT structure before sending to controller.

Fixes: MSI-X vector calculation for suspend/resume
