x86/mm, x86/mce: Add memcpy_mcsafe()

Make use of the EXTABLE_FAULT exception table entries to write
a kernel copy routine that doesn't crash the system if it
encounters a machine check. Prime use case for this is to copy
from large arrays of non-volatile memory used as storage.

We have to use an unrolled copy loop for now because current
hardware implementations treat a machine check in "rep mov"
as fatal. When that is fixed we can simplify.

Return type is a "bool". True means that we copied OK, false means
that it didn't.
