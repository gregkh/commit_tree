Input: touchscreen: Add imx25 TCQ driver

This is a driver for the imx25 ADC/TSC module. It controls the
touchscreen conversion queue and creates a touchscreen input device.
The driver currently only supports 4 wire touchscreens. The driver uses
a simple conversion queue of precharge, touch detection, X measurement,
Y measurement, precharge and another touch detection.

This driver uses the regmap from the parent to setup some touch specific
settings in the core driver and setup a idle configuration with touch
detection.
