HID: i2c-hid: Add hid-over-i2c name to i2c id table

When using the device tree binding OF compatible = "hid-over-i2c" the
i2c id table also needs to have that name in order to auto load this
driver, since i2c core reports module alias as i2c:<string> where
<string> is compatible string of OF binding stripped of manufacturer's
prefix.
