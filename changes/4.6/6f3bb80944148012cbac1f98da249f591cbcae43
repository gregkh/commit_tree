KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: kvmppc_host_rm_ops - handle offlining CPUs

The kvmppc_host_rm_ops structure keeps track of which cores are
are in the host by maintaining a bitmask of active/runnable
online CPUs that have not entered the guest. This patch adds
support to manage the bitmask when a CPU is offlined or onlined
in the host.
