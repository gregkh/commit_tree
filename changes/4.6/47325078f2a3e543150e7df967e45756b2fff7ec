ASoC: dapm: Make sure we have a card when displaying component widgets

The dummy component is reused for all cards so we special case and don't
bind it to any of them.  This means that code like that displaying the
component widgets that tries to look at the card will crash.  In the
future we will fix this by ensuring that the dummy component looks like
other components but that is invasive and so not suitable for a fix.
Instead add a special case check here.
