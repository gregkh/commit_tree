ipv6: per netns FIB garbage collection

One of our customers observed issues with FIB6 garbage collectors
running in different network namespaces blocking each other, resulting
in soft lockups (fib6_run_gc() initiated from timer runs always in
forced mode).

Now that FIB6 walkers are separated per namespace, there is no more need
for instances of fib6_run_gc() in different namespaces blocking each
other. There is still a call to icmp6_dst_gc() which operates on shared
data but this function is protected by its own shared lock.
