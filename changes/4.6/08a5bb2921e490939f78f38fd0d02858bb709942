powerpc/mm: Fixup preempt underflow with huge pages

hugepd_free() used __get_cpu_var() once. Nothing ensured that the code
accessing the variable did not migrate from one CPU to another and soon
this was noticed by Tiejun Chen in 94b09d755462 ("powerpc/hugetlb:
Replace __get_cpu_var with get_cpu_var"). So we had it fixed.

Christoph Lameter was doing his __get_cpu_var() replaces and forgot
PowerPC. Then he noticed this and sent his fixed up batch again which
got applied as 69111bac42f5 ("powerpc: Replace __get_cpu_var uses").

The careful reader will noticed one little detail: get_cpu_var() got
replaced with this_cpu_ptr(). So now we have a put_cpu_var() which does
a preempt_enable() and nothing that does preempt_disable() so we
underflow the preempt counter.
