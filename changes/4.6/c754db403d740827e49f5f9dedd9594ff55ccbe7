Staging: rdma: Use min macro instead of ternary operator

This patch replaces ternary operator with macro min as it shorter and
thus increases code readability. Macro min return the minimum of the
two compared values.
Made a semantic patch for changes:

@@
type T;
T x;
T y;
@@
(
- x < y ? x : y
+ min(x,y)
|
- x > y ? x : y
+ max(x,y)
)
