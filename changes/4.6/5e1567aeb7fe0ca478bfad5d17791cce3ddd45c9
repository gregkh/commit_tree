net sched: skbedit action fix late binding

The process below was broken and is fixed with this patch.

//add a skbedit action and give it an instance id of 1
sudo tc actions add action skbedit mark 10 index 1
//create a filter which binds to skbedit action id 1
sudo tc filter add dev $DEV parent ffff: protocol ip prio 1 u32\
match ip dst 17.0.0.1/32 flowid 1:10 action skbedit index 1

Message before fix was:
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
We have an error talking to the kernel
