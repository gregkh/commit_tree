flow_dissector: Correctly handle parsing FCoE

The flow dissector bits handling FCoE didn't bother to actually validate
that the space there was enough for the FCoE header.  So we need to update
things so that if there is room we add the header and report a good result,
otherwise we do not add the header, and report the bad result.
