staging: lustre: move libcfs to lnet layer

The lustre file system has a layered architecture with
libcfs as the lowest layer and LNet layered on top. Then
on top of LNet we run the lustre client. This patch moves
the libcfs module code out of lustre into the lnet tree.
This fits into the long term goal of eventually merging
libcfs into LNet.
