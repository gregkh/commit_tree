cxl: Adapter failure handling

Check the AFU state whenever an API is called. The hypervisor may
issue a reset of the adapter when it detects a fault. When it happens,
it launches an error recovery which will either move the AFU to a
permanent failure state, or in the disabled state.
If the AFU is found to be disabled, detach all existing contexts from
it before issuing a AFU reset to re-enable it.

Before detaching contexts, notify any kernel driver through the EEH
callbacks of the AFU pci device.
