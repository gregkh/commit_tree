cpufreq: governor: Drop unused governor callback and data fields

After some previous changes, the ->get_cpu_dbs_info_s governor
callback and the "governor" field in struct dbs_governor (whose
value represents the governor type) are not used any more, so
drop them.

Also drop the unused gov_ops field from struct dbs_governor.

No functional changes.
