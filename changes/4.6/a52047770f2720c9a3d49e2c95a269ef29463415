net: hns: fixed the bug about GMACs mac setting

When sending a pause frame out from GMACs, the packets' source MAC address
does not match the GMACs' MAC address. It causes by the condition before
the mac address setting routine for GMACs, the mac address cannot be set
into loacal mac table for service ports. It obviously the condition needs
to be deleted.
