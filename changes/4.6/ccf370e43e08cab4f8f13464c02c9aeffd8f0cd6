quota: Forbid Q_GETQUOTA and Q_GETNEXTQUOTA for frozen filesystem

Commit 7955118eafc4 (quota: Allow Q_GETQUOTA for frozen filesystem)
allowed Q_GETQUOTA call for frozen filesystem. It makes sense on the
first look but zero-day testing has shown that with this change ext4
warns about starting a transaction for frozen filesystem. This happens
because ext4_acquire_dquot() prepares for allocating space for new quota
structure. Although it would be possible to implement Q_GETQUOTA for
ext4 without allocating space for non-existent structures, the matter
further complicates because OCFS2 needs to update on-disk structure use
count when a new cluster node loads quota information from disk. So just
revert the change and forbid Q_GETQUOTA together with Q_GETNEXTQUOTA for
frozen filesystem. Add comment to quotactl_cmd_write() to save us from
repeating this excercise in a few years when I forget again.
