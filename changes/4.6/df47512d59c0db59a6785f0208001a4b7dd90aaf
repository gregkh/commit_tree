[media] netup_unidvb: Remove a useless memset

This memory is allocated using kzalloc so there is no need to call
memset(..., 0, ...)

[mchehab@osg.samsung.com: as suggested by Joe Perches,
 It's unusual to not see the alloc above the if, removed a
 blank line between kzalloc/if and added a blank line after if]
