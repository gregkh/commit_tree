cpufreq: Move scheduler-related code to the sched directory

Create cpufreq.c under kernel/sched/ and move the cpufreq code
related to the scheduler to that file and to sched.h.

Redefine cpufreq_update_util() as a static inline function to avoid
function calls at its call sites in the scheduler code (as suggested
by Peter Zijlstra).

Also move the definition of struct update_util_data and declaration
of cpufreq_set_update_util_data() from include/linux/cpufreq.h to
include/linux/sched.h.
