PCI: Move pci_dma_* helpers to common code

For a long time all architectures implement the pci_dma_* functions using
the generic DMA API, and they all use the same header to do so.

Move this header, pci-dma-compat.h, to include/linux and include it from
the generic pci.h instead of having each arch duplicate this include.
