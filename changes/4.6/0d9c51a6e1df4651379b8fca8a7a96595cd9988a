block: partition: add partition specific uevent callbacks for partition info

This patch has been carried in the Android tree for quite some time and
is one of the few patches required to get a mainline kernel up and
running with an exsiting Android userspace.  So I wanted to submit it
for review and consideration if it should be merged.

For partitions, add new uevent parameters 'PARTN' which specifies the
partitions index in the table, and 'PARTNAME', which specifies PARTNAME
specifices the partition name of a partition device.

Android's userspace uses this for creating device node links from the
partition name and number, ie:

    /dev/block/platform/soc/by-name/system
or
    /dev/block/platform/soc/by-num/p1

One can see its usage here:
    https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/init/devices.cpp#355
and
    https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/init/devices.cpp#494
