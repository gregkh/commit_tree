platform: goldfish: pipe: don't log when dropping PIPE_ERROR_AGAIN

On PIPE_ERROR_AGAIN, just stopping in the middle of a transfer and
returning the number of bytes actually handled is the right behavior.

Other errors should be returned on the next read() or write() call.
Continue logging those until we confirm nothing actually relies on the
existing (wrong) behavior of dropping errors on the floor.
