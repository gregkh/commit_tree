staging: netlogic: Replacing pr_err with dev_err after the call to devm_kzalloc

The function devm_kzalloc has a first argument of type struct device *.
This is the type of argument required by printing functions such as
dev_info, dev_err, etc. Thus, functions like pr_info should not
normally be used after a call to devm_kzalloc. Thus, all pr_err occurances are
replaced with dev_err function calls
