iommu/arm-smmu: Don't allocate resources for bypass domains

Until we get fully plumbed into of_iommu_configure, our default
IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA domains just bypass translation. Since we achieve that
by leaving the stream table entries set to bypass instead of pointing at
a translation context, the context bank we allocate for the domain is
completely wasted. Context banks are typically a rather limited
resource, so don't hog ones we don't need.
