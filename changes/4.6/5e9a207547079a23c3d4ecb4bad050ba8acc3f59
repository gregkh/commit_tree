pinctrl: lpc18xx: ensure ngroups is initialized at correct place

The initialization of ngroups is occurring at the end of the
first iteration of the outer loop, which means that the
assignment  pins[ngroups++] = i is potentially indexing into
a region outside of array pins because ngroups is not initialized.
Instead, initialize ngroups in the inner loop before the first
inner loop iteration.
