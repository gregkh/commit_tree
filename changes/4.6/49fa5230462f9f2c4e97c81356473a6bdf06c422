sparc64: Fix bootup regressions on some Kconfig combinations.

The system call tracing bug fix mentioned in the Fixes tag
below increased the amount of assembler code in the sequence
of assembler files included by head_64.S

This caused to total set of code to exceed 0x4000 bytes in
size, which overflows the expression in head_64.S that works
to place swapper_tsb at address 0x408000.

When this is violated, the TSB is not properly aligned, and
also the trap table is not aligned properly either.  All of
this together results in failed boots.

So, do two things:

1) Simplify some code by using ba,a instead of ba/nop to get
   those bytes back.

2) Add a linker script assertion to make sure that if this
   happens again the build will fail.
