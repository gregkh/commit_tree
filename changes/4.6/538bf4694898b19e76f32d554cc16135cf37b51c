ARM: 8513/1: xip: Move XIP linking to a separate file

When building an XIP kernel, the linker script needs to be much different
than a conventional kernel's script. Over time, it's been difficult to
maintain both XIP and non-XIP layouts in one linker script. Therefore,
this patch separates the two procedures into two completely different
files.

The new linker script is essentially a straight copy of the current script
with all the non-CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL portions removed.

Additionally, all CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL portions have been removed from the
existing linker script...never to return again.

It should be noted that this does not fix any current XIP issues, but
rather is the first move in fixing them properly with subsequent patches.
