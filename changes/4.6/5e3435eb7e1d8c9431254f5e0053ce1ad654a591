iommu/exynos: Remove ARM-specific cache flush interface

This patch replaces custom ARM-specific code for performing CPU cache flush
operations with generic code based on DMA-mapping. Domain managing code
is independent of particular SYSMMU device, so the first registered SYSMMU
device is used for DMA-mapping calls. This simplification works fine
because all SYSMMU controllers are in the same address space (where
DMA address equals physical address) and the DMA-mapping calls are done
mainly to flush CPU cache to make changes visible to SYSMMU controllers.
