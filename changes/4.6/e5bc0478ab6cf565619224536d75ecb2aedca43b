ARC: Add missing io barriers to io{read,write}{16,32}be()

While reviewing a different change to asm-generic/io.h Arnd spotted that
ARC ioread32 and ioread32be both of which come from asm-generic versions
are not symmetrical in terms of calling the io barriers.

generic ioread32   -> ARC readl()                  [ has barriers]
generic ioread32be -> __be32_to_cpu(__raw_readl()) [ lacks barriers]

While generic ioread32be is being remediated to call readl(), that involves
a swab32(), causing double swaps on ioread32be() on Big Endian systems.

So provide our versions of big endian IO accessors to ensure io barrier
calls while also keeping them optimal
