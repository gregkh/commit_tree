arm64: Remove the get_thread_info() function

This function was introduced by previous commits implementing UAO.
However, it can be replaced with task_thread_info() in
uao_thread_switch() or get_fs() in do_page_fault() (the latter being
called only on the current context, so no need for using the saved
pt_regs).
