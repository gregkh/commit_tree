Documentation: devicetree: Add DT bindings to eeprom_93xx46 driver.

This commit documents bindings to be added to the eeprom_93xx46 driver
which will allow:

  - Device word size and read-only attributes to be specified.
  - A device-specific compatible string for use with Atmel AT93C46D
    EEPROMs.
  - Specifying a GPIO line to function as a 'select' or 'enable' signal
    prior to accessing the EEPROM.
