Input: gtco - fix crash on detecting device without endpoints

The gtco driver expects at least one valid endpoint. If given malicious
descriptors that specify 0 for the number of endpoints, it will crash in
the probe function. Ensure there is at least one endpoint on the interface
before using it.

Also let's fix a minor coding style issue.
