USB: EHCI: store reason for unlinking a QH

This patch replaces the "exception" bitflag in the ehci_qh structure
with a more explicit "unlink_reason" bitmask.  This is for use in the
following patch, where we will need to have a good idea of the
reason for unlinking a QH, not just "something exceptional happened".
