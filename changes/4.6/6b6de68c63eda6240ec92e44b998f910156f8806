KVM: halt_polling: improve grow/shrink settings

Right now halt_poll_ns can be change during runtime. The
grow and shrink factors can only be set during module load.
Lets fix several aspects of grow shrink:
- make grow/shrink changeable by root
- make all variables unsigned int
- read the variables once to prevent races
