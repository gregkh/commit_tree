drm/i915: Fix context/engine cleanup order

Swap the order of context & engine cleanup, so that contexts are cleaned
up first, and *then* engines. This is a more sensible order anyway, but
in particular has become necessary since the 'intel_ring_initialized()
must be simple and inline' patch, which now uses ring->dev as an
'initialised' flag, so it can now be NULL after engine teardown. This
in turn can cause a problem in the context code, which (used to) check
the ring->dev->struct_mutex -- causing a fault if ring->dev was NULL.

Also rename the cleanup function to reflect what it actually does
(cleanup engines, not a ringbuffer), and fix an annoying whitespace issue.

v2: Also make the fix in i915_load_modeset_init, not just in
    i915_driver_unload (Chris Wilson)
v3: Had extra stuff in it.
v4: Reverted extra stuff (so we're back to v2).
    Rebased and updated commentary above (Dave Gordon).
