ALSA: hda - hdmi jack created based on pcm

Jack is created based on pcm.

Apply the acomp jack rule to dyn_pcm_assign.
For dyn_pcm_assign:
 Driver does not use hda_jack. It operates snd_jack directly.
 snd_jack pointer will be stored in spec->pcm.jack instead of
 the current spec->acomp_jack. When pcm is assigned to pin,
 jack will be assigned to pin automatically.
For !dyn_pcm_assign:
 Driver continues using hda_jack for less impact on the old cases.
 Pcm is statically assigned to pin. So is jack. spec->pcm.jack
 saves the snd_jack pointer created in hda_jack.
