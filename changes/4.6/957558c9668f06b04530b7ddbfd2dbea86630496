staging/rdma/hfi1: Consolidate CPU/IRQ affinity support

This patch unifies the affinity support for CPU and IRQ allocations into
a single code base. The goal is to allow the driver to make intelligent
placement decision based on an overall view of processes and IRQs across
as much of the driver as possible.

Pulling all the scattered affinity code into a single code base lays the
ground work for accomplishing the above goal.  For example, previous
implementations made user process placement decision solely based on
other user processes.  This algorithm is limited as it did not take into
account IRQ placement and could result in overloading certain CPUs.

A single code base also provides a much easier way to maintain and debug
any performance issues related to affinity.
