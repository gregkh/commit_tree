drm/i915: Correct max delay for HDMI hotplug live status checking

The total delay of HDMI hotplug detecting with 30ms have already
been split into a resolution of 3 retries of 10ms each, for the worst
cases. But it still suffered from only waiting 10ms at most in
intel_hdmi_detect(). This patch corrects it by reading hotplug status
with 4 times at most for 30ms delay.

v2:
- straight up to loop execution for more clear in code readability
- mdelay will replace with msleep by Daniel's new patch

	drm/i915: mdelay(10) considered harmful

- suggest to re-evaluate try times for being compatible to old HDMI monitor
