USB: uas: Reduce can_queue to MAX_CMNDS

The uas driver can never queue more then MAX_CMNDS (- 1) tags and tags
are shared between luns, so there is no need to claim that we can_queue
some random large number.

Not claiming that we can_queue 65536 commands, fixes the uas driver
failing to initialize while allocating the tag map with a "Page allocation
failure (order 7)" error on systems which have been running for a while
and thus have fragmented memory.
