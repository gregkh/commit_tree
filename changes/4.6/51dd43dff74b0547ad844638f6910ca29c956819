tpm_tis: Use devm_ioremap_resource

This does a request_resource under the covers which means tis holds a
lock on the memory range it is using so other drivers cannot grab it.
When doing probing it is important to ensure that other drivers are
not using the same range before tis starts touching it.

To do this flow the actual struct resource from the device right
through to devm_ioremap_resource. This ensures all the proper resource
meta-data is carried down.
