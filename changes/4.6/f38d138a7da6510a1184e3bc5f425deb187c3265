net/ethtool: support set coalesce per queue

This patch implements sub command ETHTOOL_SCOALESCE for ioctl
ETHTOOL_PERQUEUE. It introduces an interface set_per_queue_coalesce to
set coalesce of each masked queue to device driver. The wanted coalesce
information are stored in "data" for each masked queue, which can copy
from userspace.
If it fails to set coalesce to device driver, the value which already
set to specific queue will be tried to rollback.
