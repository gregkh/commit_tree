net/mlx5_core: Add VF param when querying vport counter

Add a vf parameter to mlx5_core_query_vport_counter so we can call it to
query counters of virtual functions. Also update current users of the
API.

PFs may call mlx5_core_query_vport_counter with other_vport set to
indicate that they are querying a virtual function. The virtual
function to be queried is given by the vf parameter. Virtual function
numbering is zero based so the first VF is 0 and so on. When a PF
queries its own function, the other_vport parameter is cleared.
