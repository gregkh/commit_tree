powerpc/mm: enable page parallel initialisation

Parallel initialisation has been enabled for X86, boot time is improved
greatly.  On Power8, it is improved greatly for small memory.  Here is
the result from my test on Power8 platform:

For 4GB of memory, boot time is improved by 59%, from 24.5s to 10s.

For 50GB memory, boot time is improved by 22%, from 56.8s to 43.8s.
