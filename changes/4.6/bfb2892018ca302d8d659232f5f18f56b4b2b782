crypto: sunxi - don't print confusing data

gcc correctly warns that the printk output contains a variable that
it thinks is not initialized in some cases:

drivers/crypto/sunxi-ss/sun4i-ss-cipher.c: In function 'sun4i_ss_cipher_poll':
drivers/crypto/sunxi-ss/sun4i-ss-cipher.c:254:76: warning: 'todo' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
drivers/crypto/sunxi-ss/sun4i-ss-cipher.c:144:15: note: 'todo' was declared here

A closer look at the function reveals that the variable is always
initialized at this point (ileft is guaranteed to be positive at the
start), but its contents are not well-defined:
Depending on some other variables, it might be either a count in
words or bytes, and it could refer to either input or output.

The easiest solution apparently is to remove the confusing output
and let the reader figure out the state from the other variables.
