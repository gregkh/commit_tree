x86/mm/pkeys: Pass VMA down in to fault signal generation code

During a page fault, we look up the VMA to ensure that the fault
is in a region with a valid mapping.  But, in the top-level page
fault code we don't need the VMA for much else.  Once we have
decided that an access is bad, we are going to send a signal no
matter what and do not need the VMA any more.  So we do not pass
it down in to the signal generation code.

But, for protection keys, we need the VMA.  It tells us *which*
protection key we violated if we get a PF_PK.  So, we need to
pass the VMA down and fill in siginfo->si_pkey.
