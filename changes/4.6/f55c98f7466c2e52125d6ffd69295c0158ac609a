mmc: sdhci: factor out common DMA cleanup in sdhci_finish_data()

sdhci_finish_data() has two paths which result in identical DMA cleanup.
One is when SDHCI_USE_ADMA is clear, and the other is just before when
SDHCI_USE_ADMA is set, and is performed within sdhci_adma_table_post().

Simplify the code by removing the 'else' and eliminating the duplicate
inside sdhci_adma_table_post().
