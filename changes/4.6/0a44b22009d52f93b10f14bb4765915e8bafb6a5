rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Convert driver to use common 5G channel table

There are several copies of the 5G channel tables in this driver. These
are removed so that the tables in the core will be used. This change
also removes a useless message of "Channel 163 in Group not found".

The number of possible 5G channels was reduced from 54 to a better
value of 49 during the conversion.
