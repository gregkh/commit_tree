KVM: PPC: Move reusable bits of H_PUT_TCE handler to helpers

Upcoming multi-tce support (H_PUT_TCE_INDIRECT/H_STUFF_TCE hypercalls)
will validate TCE (not to have unexpected bits) and IO address
(to be within the DMA window boundaries).

This introduces helpers to validate TCE and IO address. The helpers are
exported as they compile into vmlinux (to work in realmode) and will be
used later by KVM kernel module in virtual mode.
