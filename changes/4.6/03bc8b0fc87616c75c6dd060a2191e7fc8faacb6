powerpc32: checksum_wrappers_64 becomes checksum_wrappers

The powerpc64 checksum wrapper functions adds csum_and_copy_to_user()
which otherwise is implemented in include/net/checksum.h by using
csum_partial() then copy_to_user()

Those two wrapper fonctions are also applicable to powerpc32 as it is
based on the use of csum_partial_copy_generic() which also
exists on powerpc32

This patch renames arch/powerpc/lib/checksum_wrappers_64.c to
arch/powerpc/lib/checksum_wrappers.c and
makes it non-conditional to CONFIG_WORD_SIZE
