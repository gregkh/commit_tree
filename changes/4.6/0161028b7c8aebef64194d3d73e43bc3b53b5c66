perf/core: Change the default paranoia level to 2

Allowing unprivileged kernel profiling lets any user dump follow kernel
control flow and dump kernel registers.  This most likely allows trivial
kASLR bypassing, and it may allow other mischief as well.  (Off the top
of my head, the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR output during /dev/urandom reads
could be quite interesting.)
