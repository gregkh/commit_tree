dsa: slave: Don't reference NULL pointer during phy_disconnect

When the phy is disconnected, the parent pointer to the netdev it was
attached to is set to NULL. The code then tries to suspend the phy,
but dsa_slave_fixed_link_update needs the parent pointer to determine
which switch the phy is connected to. So it dereferenced a NULL
pointer. Check for this condition.
