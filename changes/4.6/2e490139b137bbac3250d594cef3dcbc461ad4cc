[media] media: i2c: ov2659: speedup probe if no device connected

The ov2659 driver performs device detection and initialization in the
following way:
 - send reset command REG_SOFTWARE_RESET
 - load array of predefined register's setting (~150 values)
 - read device version REG_SC_CHIP_ID_H/REG_SC_CHIP_ID_L
 - check version and exit if invalid.

As result, for not connected device there will be >~150 i2c transactions
executed before device version checking and exit (there are no
failures detected because ov2659 declared as I2C_CLIENT_SCCB and NACKs
are ignored in this case).

Let's fix that by checking the chip version first and start
initialization only if it's supported.
