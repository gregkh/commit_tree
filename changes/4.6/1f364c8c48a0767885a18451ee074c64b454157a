arm64: VHE: Add support for running Linux in EL2 mode

With ARMv8.1 VHE, the architecture is able to (almost) transparently
run the kernel at EL2, despite being written for EL1.

This patch takes care of the "almost" part, mostly preventing the kernel
from dropping from EL2 to EL1, and setting up the HYP configuration.
