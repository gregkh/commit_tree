IB/rdmavt: Remove unnecessary exported functions

Remove exported functions which are no longer required as the
functionality has moved into rdmavt. This also requires re-ordering some
of the functions since their prototype no longer appears in a header
file. Rather than add forward declarations it is just cleaner to
re-order some of the functions.
