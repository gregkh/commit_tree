gre: build header correctly for collect metadata tunnels

In ipgre (i.e. not gretap) + collect metadata mode, the skb was assumed to
contain Ethernet header and was encapsulated as ETH_P_TEB. This is not the
case, the interface is ARPHRD_IPGRE and the protocol to be used for
encapsulation is skb->protocol.

Fixes: 2e15ea390e6f4 ("ip_gre: Add support to collect tunnel metadata.")
