be2net: check for INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES error

The driver currently logs the message "VF is not privileged to issue
opcode" by checking only the base_status field for UNAUTHORIZED_REQUEST.
Add check to look for INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES in the additional status
field also as not all cmds fail with that base status.
