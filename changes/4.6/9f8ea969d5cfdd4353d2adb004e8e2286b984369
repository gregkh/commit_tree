PM / OPP: get/put regulators from OPP core

This allows the OPP core to request/free the regulator resource,
attached to a device OPP. The regulator device is fetched using the name
provided by the driver, while calling: dev_pm_opp_set_regulator().

This will work for both OPP-v1 and v2 bindings.

This is a preliminary step for moving the OPP switching logic into the
OPP core.
