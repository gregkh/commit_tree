be2iscsi:Add missing error check in beiscsi_eeh_resume

This adds the missing error check and path for if the call to the
function hwi_init_controller fails as this error path was clearly missed
when writing beiscsi_eeh_resume and thus we must add it now in order to
be able to handle this nonrecoverable failing function call gracefully
in beiscsi_eeh_resume.
