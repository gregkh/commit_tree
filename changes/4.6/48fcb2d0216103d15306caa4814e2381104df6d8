efi: stub: use high allocation for converted command line

Before we can move the command line processing before the allocation
of the kernel, which is required for detecting the 'nokaslr' option
which controls that allocation, move the converted command line higher
up in memory, to prevent it from interfering with the kernel itself.

Since x86 needs the address to fit in 32 bits, use UINT_MAX as the upper
bound there. Otherwise, use ULONG_MAX (i.e., no limit)
