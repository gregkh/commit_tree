KVM: s390: gaccess: implement instruction fetching mode

When an instruction is to be fetched, special handling applies to
secondary-space mode and access-register mode. The instruction is to be
fetched from primary space.

We can easily support this by selecting the right asce for translation.
Access registers will never be used during translation, so don't
include them in the interface. As we only want to read from the current
PSW address for now, let's also hide that detail.
