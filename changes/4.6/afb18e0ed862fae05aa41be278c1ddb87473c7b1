lightnvm: generalize rrpc ppa calculations

In rrpc, some calculations assume a certain configuration (e.g., 1 LUN,
1 sector per page). The reason behind this was that LightNVM used a
simple configuration with QEMU to test core features in the beginning.
This patch relaxes these assumptions and generalizes calculation,
allowing multiple luns to be used.
