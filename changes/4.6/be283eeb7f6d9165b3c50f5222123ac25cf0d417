powerpc/powernv: allocate sparse PE# when using M64 BAR in Single PE mode

When M64 BAR is set to Single PE mode, the PE# assigned to VF could be
sparse.

This patch restructures the code to allocate sparse PE# for VFs when M64
BAR is set to Single PE mode. Also it rename the offset to pe_num_map to
reflect the content is the PE number.
