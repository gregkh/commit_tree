megaraid_sas: Don't issue kill adapter for MFI controllers in case of PD list DCMD failure

There are few MFI adapters which do not support MR_DCMD_PD_LIST_QUERY so
if MFI adapters fail this DCMD, it should not be considered as FATAL and
driver should not issue kill adapter and set per controller's instance
variable- pd_list_not_supported so that same variable can be used inside
functions- slave_alloc and slave_configure to allow firmware scan.

Killing adapter because of DCMD failure when this DCMD is not supported
causes driver's probe getting failed. This issue got introduced by
commit 6d40afbc7d13 ("megaraid_sas: MFI IO timeout handling").

Killing adapter in case of this DCMD failure should be limited to Fusion
adapters only. Per controller's instance variable allow_fw_scan is
removed as pd_list_not_supported better reflect the purpose.
