Drivers: hv: vmbus: don't loose HVMSG_TIMER_EXPIRED messages

We must handle HVMSG_TIMER_EXPIRED messages in the interrupt context
and we offload all the rest to vmbus_on_msg_dpc() tasklet. This functions
loops to see if there are new messages pending. In case we'll ever see
HVMSG_TIMER_EXPIRED message there we're going to lose it as we can't
handle it from there. Avoid looping in vmbus_on_msg_dpc(), we're OK
with handling one message per interrupt.
