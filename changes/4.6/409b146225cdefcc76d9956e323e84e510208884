staging/rdma/hfi1: Fix reporting of LED status in Get(LedInfo) and Get(PortInfo)

The LedInfo SMA attribute is redefined to control the LED beaconing
state machine instead of the LED directly. In accordance, we now
return the state of LED beaconing, represented by whether the beaconing
timer is active, instead of the state of the LED itself for SMA queries
Get(LedInfo) and Get(PortInfo). While we are at it, we fix the beaconing
timer control code so that the state of the timer is accurately updated.
