KVM: PPC: Add support for 64bit TCE windows

The existing KVM_CREATE_SPAPR_TCE only supports 32bit windows which is not
enough for directly mapped windows as the guest can get more than 4GB.

This adds KVM_CREATE_SPAPR_TCE_64 ioctl and advertises it
via KVM_CAP_SPAPR_TCE_64 capability. The table size is checked against
the locked memory limit.

Since 64bit windows are to support Dynamic DMA windows (DDW), let's add
@bus_offset and @page_shift which are also required by DDW.
