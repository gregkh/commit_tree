IB/qib: Remove qib_lookup_qpn and use rvt_lookup_qpn instead

Add calls to rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() as rvt_lookup_qpn callers
must hold the rcu_read_lock before calling and keep the lock until the
returned qp is no longer in use.

Remove lookaside qp and some qp refcount atomics in the sdma send code
that is redundant with the s_dma_busy refcount, which will also stall
the state processing to the reset state.

Change the qpn hash function to hash_32 which is hash function used
in rvt_lookup_qpn. qpn_hash function would be eliminated in later patches.
