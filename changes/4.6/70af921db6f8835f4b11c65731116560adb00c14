net: ipv6: Do not keep linklocal and loopback addresses

f1705ec197e7 added the option to retain user configured addresses on an
admin down. A comment to one of the later revisions suggested using the
IFA_F_PERMANENT flag rather than adding a user_managed boolean to the
ifaddr struct. A side effect of this change is that link local and
loopback addresses are also retained which is not part of the objective
of f1705ec197e7. Add check to drop those addresses.

Fixes: f1705ec197e7 ("net: ipv6: Make address flushing on ifdown optional")
