HID: logitech: fix Dual Action gamepad support

The patch that added Logitech Dual Action gamepad support forgot to
update the special driver list for the device. This caused the logitech
driver not to probe unless kernel module load order was favorable.
Update the special driver list to fix it. Thanks to Simon Wood for the
idea.
