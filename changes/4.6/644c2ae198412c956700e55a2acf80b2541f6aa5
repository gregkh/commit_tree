arm64: cpufeature: Test 'matches' pointer to find the end of the list

CPU feature code uses the desc field as a test to find the end of the list,
this means every entry must have a description. This generates noise for
entries in the list that aren't really features, but combinations of them.
e.g.
> CPU features: detected feature: Privileged Access Never
> CPU features: detected feature: PAN and not UAO

These combination features are needed for corner cases with alternatives,
where cpu features interact.

Change all walkers of the arm64_features[] and arm64_hwcaps[] lists to test
'matches' not 'desc', and only print 'desc' if it is non-NULL.
