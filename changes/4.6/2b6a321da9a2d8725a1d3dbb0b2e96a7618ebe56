Input: synaptics-rmi4 - add support for Synaptics RMI4 devices

Synaptics uses the Register Mapped Interface (RMI) protocol as a
communications interface for their devices. This driver adds the core
functionality needed to interface with RMI4 devices.

RMI devices can be connected to the host via several transport protocols
and can supports a wide variety of functionality defined by RMI functions.
Support for transport protocols and RMI functions are implemented in
individual drivers. The RMI4 core driver uses a bus architecture to
facilitate the various combinations of transport and function drivers
needed by a particular device.
