tty: audit: Simplify first-use allocation

The first-use tty audit buffer allocation is a potential race
amongst multiple attempts at 'first-use'; only one 'winner' is
acceptable.

The successful buffer assignment occurs if tty_audit_buf == NULL
(which will also be the return from cmpxchg()); otherwise, another
racer 'won' and this buffer allocation is freed.
