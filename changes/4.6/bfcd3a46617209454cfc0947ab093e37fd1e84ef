Introduce devlink infrastructure

Introduce devlink infrastructure for drivers to register and expose to
userspace via generic Netlink interface.

There are two basic objects defined:
devlink - one instance for every "parent device", for example switch ASIC
devlink port - one instance for every physical port of the device.

This initial portion implements basic get/dump of objects to userspace.
Also, port splitter and port type setting is implemented.
