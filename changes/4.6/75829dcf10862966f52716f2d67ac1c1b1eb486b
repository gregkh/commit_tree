drivers/acpi: make pmic/intel_pmic_crc.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/acpi/Kconfig:config CRC_PMIC_OPREGION
drivers/acpi/Kconfig:   bool "ACPI operation region support for CrystalCove PMIC"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple modular references, so that when reading
the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
