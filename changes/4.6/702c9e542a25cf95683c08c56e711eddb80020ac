cpufreq: governor: Add a ->start callback for governors

To avoid having to check the governor type explicitly in the common
code in order to initialize data structures specific to the governor
type properly, add a ->start callback to struct dbs_governor and
use it to initialize those data structures for the ondemand and
conservative governors.
