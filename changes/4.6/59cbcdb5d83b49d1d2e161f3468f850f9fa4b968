ARM: KVM: Add VFP save/restore

This is almost a copy/paste of the existing version, with a couple
of subtle differences:
- Only write to FPEXC once on the save path
- Add an isb when enabling VFP access

The patch also defines a few sysreg accessors and a __vfp_enabled
predicate that test the VFP trapping state.
