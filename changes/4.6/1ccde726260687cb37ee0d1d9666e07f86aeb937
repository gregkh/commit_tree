staging: lustre: handle lnet_check_routes() errors

After adding a route, lnet_check_routes() is called to ensure that
the route added doesn't invalidate the routing configuration.  If
lnet_check_routes() fails then the route just added, which caused the
current configuration to be invalidated is deleted, and an error
is returned to the user.
