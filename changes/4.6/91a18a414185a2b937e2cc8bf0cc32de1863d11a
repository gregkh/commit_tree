platform: goldfish: pipe: add devicetree bindings

Add bindings so we don't need to rely on goldfish virtual bus for
probing any more, which means we don't need ARM and MIPS goldfish
board code for instantiating the bus.

In the long term we would like to move towards replacing the Android
pipe with virtio-vsock that is currently under development.
