Input: xpad - add Mad Catz FightStick TE 2 VID/PID

This adds the VID/PID combination for the Xbox One version of the Mad
Catz FightStick TE 2.

The functionality that this provides is about on par with what the
Windows drivers for the stick manage to deliver.

What works:
- Digital stick
- 6 main buttons
- Xbox button
- The two buttons on the back
- The locking buttons (preventing accidental Xbox button press)

What doesn't work:
- Two of the main buttons (don't work on Windows either)
- The "Haptic" button setting does not have an effect (not sure if it
  works on Windows)

I added the MAP_TRIGGERS_TO_BUTTONS option but in my (limited) testing
there was no practical difference with or without. The FightStick does
not have triggers though so adding it makes sense.
