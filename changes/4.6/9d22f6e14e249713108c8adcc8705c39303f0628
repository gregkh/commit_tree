selftests: add a new test for Media Controller API

This test opens user specified Media Device and calls
MEDIA_IOC_DEVICE_INFO ioctl in a loop once every 10
seconds. This test is for detecting errors in device
removal path.

Usage:
    sudo ./media_device_test -d /dev/mediaX

While test is running, remove the device and
ensure there are no use after free errors and
other Oops in the dmesg. Enable KaSan kernel
config option for use-after-free error detection.
