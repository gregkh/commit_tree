staging: lustre: make o2iblnd local functions static

This fixes sparse warnings such as:
 .../o2iblnd.c:424:1: warning: symbol 'kiblnd_get_peer_info' was not declared.
                      Should it be static?

This reduces the code size by 400 bytes.

The body of "the_o2iblnd" was moved at the end of the file,
to avoid having to declare some static prototypes.
