drm/i915: change intel_fill_fb_ggtt_view() to use the real tile size

Use the actual tile size as to compute stuff in
intel_fill_fb_ggtt_view() instead of assuming it's PAGE_SIZE. I suppose
it doesn't matter since we don't use the results on gen2 platforms
where the tile size is 2k.

v2: Update due to CbCr plane
