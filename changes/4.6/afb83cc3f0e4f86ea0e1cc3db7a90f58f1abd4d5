arm64: prefetch: add missing #include for spin_lock_prefetch

As of 52e662326e1e ("arm64: prefetch: don't provide spin_lock_prefetch
with LSE"), spin_lock_prefetch is patched at runtime when the LSE atomics
are in use. This relies on the ARM64_LSE_ATOMIC_INSN macro to drive
the alternatives framework, but that macro is only available via
asm/lse.h, which isn't explicitly included in processor.h. Consequently,
drivers can run into build failures such as:

   In file included from include/linux/prefetch.h:14:0,
                    from drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_txrx.c:27:
   arch/arm64/include/asm/processor.h: In function 'spin_lock_prefetch':
   arch/arm64/include/asm/processor.h:183:15: error: expected string literal before 'ARM64_LSE_ATOMIC_INSN'
     asm volatile(ARM64_LSE_ATOMIC_INSN(

This patch add the missing include and gets things building again.
