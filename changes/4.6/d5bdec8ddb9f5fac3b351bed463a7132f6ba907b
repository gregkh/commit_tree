lightnvm: fold get bb tbl when using dual/quad plane mode

When the media manager runs in dual or quad plane mode, lightnvm
abstracts away plane specific commands. This poses a problem for
get bad block table, as it reports bad blocks per plane, making the
table either two or four times bigger than expected. Fold the bad block
list before returning.
