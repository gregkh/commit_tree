arm64: KVM: VHE: Implement VHE activate/deactivate_traps

Running the kernel in HYP mode requires the HCR_E2H bit to be set
at all times, and the HCR_TGE bit to be set when running as a host
(and cleared when running as a guest). At the same time, the vector
 must be set to the current role of the kernel (either host or
hypervisor), and a couple of system registers differ between VHE
and non-VHE.

We implement these by using another set of alternate functions
that get dynamically patched.
