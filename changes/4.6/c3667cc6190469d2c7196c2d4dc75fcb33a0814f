dm thin: consistently return -ENOSPC if pool has run out of data space

Commit 0a927c2f02 ("dm thin: return -ENOSPC when erroring retry list due
to out of data space") was a step in the right direction but didn't go
far enough.

Add a new 'out_of_data_space' flag to 'struct pool' and set it if/when
the pool runs of of data space.  This fixes cell_error() and
error_retry_list() to not blindly return -EIO.

We cannot rely on the 'error_if_no_space' feature flag since it is
transient (in that it can be reset once space is added, plus it only
controls whether errors are issued, it doesn't reflect whether the
pool is actually out of space).
