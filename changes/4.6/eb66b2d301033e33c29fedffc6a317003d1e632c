staging: fsl-mc: bus: Eliminate double function call

A call to irq_find_matching_host was already made and the result
has been stored in mc_msi_domain. mc_msi_domain is again reassigned
using the same function call which is redundant.

irq_find_matching_host returns/locates a domain for a given fwnode.
The domain is identified using device node and bus_token(if several
domains have same device node but different purposes they can be
distinguished using bus-specific token).

Also, of_property_read_bool finds and reads a boolean from a property
device node from which the property value is to be read. It doesn't
alter the device node.

Since, both  the function calls have the same device node and bus_token,
the return values shall be the same. Hence, the second call has been
removed.

This was done using Coccinelle:

@r@
idexpression *x;
identifier f;
position p1,p2;
@@

x@p1 = f(...)
... when != x
(
x@p2 = f(...)
)

@script:python@
p1 << r.p1;
p2 << r.p2;
@@

if (p1[0].line == p2[0].line):
  cocci.include_match(False)

@@
idexpression *x;
identifier f;
position r.p1,r.p2;
@@

*x@p1 = f(...)
...
*x@p2 = f(...)
