staging: lustre: make some lnet functions static

Some functions and variables are only used in their C file, so reduce
their scope. This reduces the code size, and fixes sparse warnings
such as:

warning: symbol 'proc_lnet_routes' was not declared.
        Should it be static?
warning: symbol 'proc_lnet_routers' was not declared.
        Should it be static?

Some prototypes were removed from C files and added to the proper
header.
