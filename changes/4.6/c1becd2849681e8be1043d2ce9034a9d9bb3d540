misc: mic: Enable VOP card side functionality

This patch moves virtio functionality from the MIC card driver into a
separate hardware independent Virtio Over PCIe (VOP) driver. This
functionality was introduced in commit 2141c7c5ee67 ("Intel MIC Card
Driver Changes for Virtio Devices.") in
drivers/misc/mic/card/mic_virtio.c. Apart from being moved into a
separate driver the functionality is essentially unchanged. See the
above mentioned commit for a description of this functionality.
