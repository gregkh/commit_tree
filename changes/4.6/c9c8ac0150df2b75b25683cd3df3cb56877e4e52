usb: dwc2: host: fix split transfer schedule sequence

We're supposed to keep outstanding splits in order.  Keep track of a
list of the order of splits and process channel interrupts in that
order.

Without this change and the following setup:
* Rockchip rk3288 Chromebook, using port ff540000
  -> Pluggable 7-port Hub with Charging (powered)
     -> Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 2000 in port 1.
     -> Das Keyboard in port 2.

...I find that I get dropped keys on the Microsoft keyboard (I'm sure
there are other combinations that fail, but this documents my test).
Specifically I've been typing "hahahahahahaha" on the keyboard and often
see keys dropped or repeated.

After this change the above setup works properly.  This patch is based
on a previous patch proposed by Yunzhi Li ("usb: dwc2: hcd: fix periodic
transfer schedule sequence")
