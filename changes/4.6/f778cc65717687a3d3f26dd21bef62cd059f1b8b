ARC: [BE] readl()/writel() to work in Big Endian CPU configuration

read{l,w}() write{l,w}() primitives should use le{16,32}_to_cpu() and
cpu_to_le{16,32}() respectively to ensure device registers are read
correctly in Big Endian CPU configuration.

Per Arnd Bergmann
| Most drivers using readl() or readl_relaxed() expect those to perform byte
| swaps on big-endian architectures, as the registers tend to be fixed endian

This was needed for getting UART to work correctly on a Big Endian ARC.

The ARC accessors originally were fine, and the bug got introduced
inadventently by commit b8a033023994 ("ARCv2: barriers")
