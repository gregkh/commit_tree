lib/bug.c: make panic_on_warn available for all architectures

Christian Borntraeger reported that panic_on_warn doesn't have any
effect on s390.

The panic_on_warn feature was introduced with 9e3961a09798 ("kernel: add
panic_on_warn").  However it did care only for the case when
WANT_WARN_ON_SLOWPATH is defined.  This is turn is only the case for
architectures which do not have an own __WARN_TAINT defined.

Other architectures which do have __WARN_TAINT defined call report_bug()
for warnings within lib/bug.c which does not call panic() in case
panic_on_warn is set.

Let's simply enable the panic_on_warn feature by adding the same code
like it was added to warn_slowpath_common() in panic.c.

This enables panic_on_warn also for arm64, parisc, powerpc, s390 and sh.
