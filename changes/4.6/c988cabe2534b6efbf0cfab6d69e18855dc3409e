iscsi_ibft: Add prefix-len attr and display netmask

The iBFT table only specifies a prefix length, not a netmask.
And the netmask is pretty much pointless for IPv6.
So introduce a new attribute 'prefix-len'.

Some older user-space code might rely on the netmask attribute
being present, so we should always display it.

Changes from v1:
 - Combined two patches into one

 - Cleaned up/corrected wording for patch description

v3: [Put Hannes back as author]
