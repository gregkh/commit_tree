staging: delete STE RMI4 hackish driver

As of commit 62d5bdf972ebcfc99f72f734ae979713e4ca6450
"Merge branch 'synaptics-rmi4' into next" the input subsystem
has a proper RMI4 infrastructure and touchscreen driver.
The ST Ux500 platform has been converted to use the new driver
and its devicetree bindings. Delete this ancient hack.
