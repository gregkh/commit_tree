mm: memcontrol: reclaim when shrinking memory.high below usage

When setting memory.high below usage, nothing happens until the next
charge comes along, and then it will only reclaim its own charge and not
the now potentially huge excess of the new memory.high.  This can cause
groups to stay in excess of their memory.high indefinitely.

To fix that, when shrinking memory.high, kick off a reclaim cycle that
goes after the delta.
