usb: dwc3: keystone: drop dma_mask configuration

The Keystone 2 supports DT-boot only, as result dma_mask will be
always configured properly from DT -
of_platform_device_create_pdata()->of_dma_configure(). More over,
dwc3-keystone.c can be built as module and in this case it's unsafe to
assign local variable as dma_mask.

Hence, remove dma_mask configuration code.
