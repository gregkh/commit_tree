irqchip/ath79-misc: Move the MISC driver from arch/mips/ath79/

The driver stays the same but the initialization changes a bit.
For OF boards we now get the memory map from the OF node and use
a linear mapping instead of the legacy mapping. For legacy boards
we still use a legacy mapping and just pass down all the parameters
from the board init code.
