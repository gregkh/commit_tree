net: hns: add uc match for debug ports

Debug ports receives lots of packets with dest mac addr does not match
local mac addr, because the filter is close, and it does not drop the
useless packets. This patch adds ON/OFF switch of filtering the packets
whose dest mac addr do not match the local addr in  mac table. And the
switch is ON in initialization.
