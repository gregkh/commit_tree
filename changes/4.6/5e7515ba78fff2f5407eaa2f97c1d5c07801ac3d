pinctrl: sunxi: Fix A33 external interrupts not working

pinctrl-sun8i-a33.c (and the dts) declare only 2 interrupt banks,
where as the closely related a23 has 3 banks. This matches with the
datasheet for the A33 where only interrupt banks B and G are specified
where as the A23 has banks A, B and G.

However the A33 being the A23 derative it is means that the interrupt
configure/status io-addresses for the 2 banks it has are not changed
from the A23, iow they have the same address as if bank A was still
present. Where as the sunxi pinctrl currently tries to use the A23 bank
A addresses for bank B, since the pinctrl code does not know about the
removed bank A.

Add a irq_bank_base parameter and use this where appropriate to take
the missing bank A into account.

This fixes external interrupts not working on the A33 (tested with
an i2c touchscreen controller which uses an external interrupt).
