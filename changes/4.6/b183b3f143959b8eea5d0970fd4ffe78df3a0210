drm/i915/fbc: introduce struct intel_fbc_reg_params

The early return inside __intel_fbc_update does not completely check
all the parameters that affect the FBC register values. For example,
we currently lack looking at crtc->adjusted_y (for the fence Y offset)
and all the parameters that affect the CFB size (for i8xx).

Instead of just adding the missing parameters to the check and hoping
that any changes to the fbc_activate functions also come with a
matching change to the __intel_fbc_update check, introduce a new
structure where we store these parameters and use the structure at the
fbc_activate function. Of course, it's still possible to access
everything from dev_priv in those functions, but IMHO the new code
will be harder to break.

v2: Rebase.
