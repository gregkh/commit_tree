ncr5380: Dont re-enter NCR5380_select()

Calling NCR5380_select() from the abort handler causes various problems.
Firstly, it means potentially re-entering NCR5380_select(). Secondly, it
means that the lock is released, which permits the EH handlers to be
re-entered. The combination results in crashes. Don't do it.
