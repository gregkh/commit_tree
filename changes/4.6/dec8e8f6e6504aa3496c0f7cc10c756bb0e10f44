regmap: spmi: Fix regmap_spmi_ext_read in multi-byte case

Specifically for the case of reads that use the Extended Register
Read Long command, a multi-byte read operation is broken up into
8-byte chunks.  However the call to spmi_ext_register_readl() is
incorrectly passing 'val_size', which if greater than 8 will
always fail.  The argument should instead be 'len'.
