kexec: export OFFSET(page.compound_head) to find out compound tail page

PageAnon() always look at head page to check PAGE_MAPPING_ANON and tail
page's page->mapping has just a poisoned data since commit 1c290f642101
("mm: sanitize page->mapping for tail pages").

If makedumpfile checks page->mapping of a compound tail page to
distinguish anonymous page as usual, it must fail in newer kernel.  So
it's necessary to export OFFSET(page.compound_head) to avoid checking
compound tail pages.

The problem is that unnecessary hugepages won't be removed from a dump
file in kernels 4.5.x and later.  This means that extra disk space would
be consumed.  It's a problem, but not critical.
