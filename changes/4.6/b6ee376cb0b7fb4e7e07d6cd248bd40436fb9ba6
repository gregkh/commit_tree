ip6_tunnel: set rtnl_link_ops before calling register_netdevice

When creating an ip6tnl tunnel with ip tunnel, rtnl_link_ops is not set
before ip6_tnl_create2 is called. When register_netdevice is called, there
is no linkinfo attribute in the NEWLINK message because of that.

Setting rtnl_link_ops before calling register_netdevice fixes that.
