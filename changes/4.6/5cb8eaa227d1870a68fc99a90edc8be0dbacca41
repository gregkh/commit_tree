drm/edid: Switch DDC when reading the EDID

Originally by Seth Forshee <seth.forshee@canonical.com>, 2012-10-04:
    Some dual graphics machines support muxing the DDC separately from
    the display, so make use of this functionality when reading the EDID
    on the inactive GPU. Also serialize drm_get_edid() with a mutex to
    avoid races on the DDC mux state.

    I can't figure out why I didn't like this, but I rewrote this [...]
    to lock/unlock the ddc lines [...]. I think I'd prefer something
    like that otherwise the interface got really ugly.

    v3:   Move vga_switcheroo calls to a wrapper around drm_get_edid()
          which drivers can call on muxed machines. This avoids other
          drivers having to go through the vga_switcheroo motions even
          though they are never used on a muxed platform
