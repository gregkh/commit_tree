cxl: Poll for outstanding IRQs when detaching a context

When detaching contexts, we may still have interrupts in the system
which are yet to be delivered to any CPU and be acked in the PSL.
This can result in a subsequent unrelated process getting an spurious
IRQ or an interrupt for a non-existent context.

This polls the PSL to ensure that the PSL is clear of IRQs for the
detached context, before removing the context from the idr.
