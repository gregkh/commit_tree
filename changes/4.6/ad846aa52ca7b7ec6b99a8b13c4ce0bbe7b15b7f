sh_eth: do not call netif_start_queue() from sh_eth_dev_init()

Iff  sh_eth_phy_start() call fails in sh_eth_open(), the netif_start_queue()
call done by sh_eth_dev_init()  is not undone.  In order to deal with that,
stop calling netif_start_queue()  from there, so that it can be called only
when the device is fully opened and sh_eth_dev_init() only deals with the
hardware initialization, symmetrically to sh_eth_dev_exit()...
