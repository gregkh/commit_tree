ocfs2: do not change i_size in write_end for direct io

To support direct io in ocfs2_write_begin_nolock & ocfs2_write_end_nolock.

Append direct io do not change i_size in get block phase.  It only move
to orphan when starting write.  After data is written to disk, it will
delete itself from orphan and update i_size.  So skip i_size change
section in write_begin for direct io.

And when there is no extents alloc, no meta data changes needed for
direct io (since write_begin start trans for 2 reason: alloc extents &
change i_size.  Now none of them needed).  So we can skip start trans
procedure.
