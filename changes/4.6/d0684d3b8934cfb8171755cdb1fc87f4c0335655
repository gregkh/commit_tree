cpufreq: governor: Create generic macro for common tunables

Some tunables are present in governor-specific structures, whereas one
(min_sampling_rate) is located directly in struct dbs_data.

There is a special macro for creating its sysfs attribute and the
show/store callbacks, but since more tunables are going to be moved
to struct dbs_data, a new generic macro for such cases will be useful,
so add it and use it for min_sampling_rate.
