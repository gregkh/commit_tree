cpufreq: governor: Move per-CPU data to the common code

After previous changes there is only one piece of code in the
ondemand governor making references to per-CPU data structures,
but it can be easily modified to avoid doing that, so modify it
accordingly and move the definition of per-CPU data used by the
ondemand and conservative governors to the common code.  Next,
change that code to access the per-CPU data structures directly
rather than via a governor callback.

This causes the ->get_cpu_cdbs governor callback to become
unnecessary, so drop it along with the macro and function
definitions related to it.

Finally, drop the definitions of struct od_cpu_dbs_info_s and
struct cs_cpu_dbs_info_s that aren't necessary any more.
