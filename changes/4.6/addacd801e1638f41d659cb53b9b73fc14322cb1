ALSA: hda - Fix broken reconfig

The HD-audio reconfig function got broken in the recent kernels,
typically resulting in a failure like:
  snd_hda_intel 0000:00:1b.0: control 3:0:0:Playback Channel Map:0 is already present

This is because of the code restructuring to move the PCM and control
instantiation into the codec drive probe, by the commit [bcd96557bd0a:
ALSA: hda - Build PCMs and controls at codec driver probe].  Although
the commit above removed the calls of snd_hda_codec_build_pcms() and
*_build_controls() at the controller driver probe, the similar calls
in the reconfig were still left forgotten.  This caused the
conflicting and duplicated PCMs and controls.

The fix is trivial: just remove these superfluous calls from
reconfig_codec().
