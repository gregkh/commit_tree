ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Add jack reporting

Jack is created based on pcm devices enumerated, so we will
create Jack as "HDMI/DP, pcm=x Jack". This style is expected by
current usermode like PulseAudio and CRAS.

This patch exports an API which can be used to register Jack
based on PCM. This API also establishes the map between PCM and
cvt. Further cvt to pin mapping is established with the help of
usermode selection based on the board topology.

During device probe as the PCMs may not be registered, initial
pin sense don't report jack events. So, first time jack reporting
is done during user selection of mux control.
