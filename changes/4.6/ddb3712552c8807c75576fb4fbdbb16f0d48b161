tipc: safely copy UDP netlink data from user

The netlink policy for TIPC_NLA_UDP_LOCAL and TIPC_NLA_UDP_REMOTE
is of type binary with a defined length. This causes the policy
framework to threat the defined length as maximum length.

There is however no protection against a user sending a smaller
amount of data. Prior to this patch this wasn't handled which could
result in a partially incomplete sockaddr_storage struct containing
uninitialized data.

In this patch we use nla_memcpy() when copying the user data. This
ensures a potential gap at the end is cleared out properly.

This was found by Julia with Coccinelle tool.
