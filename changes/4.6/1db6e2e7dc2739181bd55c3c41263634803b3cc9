drm/i915: Check for get_pages instead of shmem (filp)

This behavior of checking for a shmem backed GEM object was introduced here:

    drm/i915: Refactor shmem pread setup

It is possible for an object to not be a shmem backed GEM object (for example
userptr objects). An example of how we hit this failure can be found through
copy_batch() in the command parser because we allocate a userptr object for the
batch which contains privileged instructions. Userptr calls
drm_gem_private_object_init() which explicitly sets the filp to none.

NOTE: I manually retyped this from a test machine. So I haven't even compiled
this exact patch.

v2: Use same logic as from a2a4f916c2f (Kristian, Dave Gordon)
