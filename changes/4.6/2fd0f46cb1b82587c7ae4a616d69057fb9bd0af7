libahci: save port map for forced port map

In usecases where force_port_map is used saved_port_map is never set,
resulting in not programming the PORTS_IMPL register as part of initial
config. This patch fixes this by setting it to port_map even in case
where force_port_map is used, making it more inline with other parts of
the code.
