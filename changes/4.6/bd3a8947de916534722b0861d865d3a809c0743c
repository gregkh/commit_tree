IB/hfi1: Specify mm when releasing pages

This change adds a pointer to the process mm_struct when
calling hfi1_release_user_pages().

Previously, the function used the mm_struct of the current
process to adjust the number of pinned pages. However, is some
cases, namely when unpinning pages due to a MMU notifier call,
we want to drop into that code block as it will cause a deadlock
(the MMU notifiers take the process' mmap_sem prior to calling
the callbacks).

By allowing to caller to specify the pointer to the mm_struct,
the caller has finer control over that part of hfi1_release_user_pages().
