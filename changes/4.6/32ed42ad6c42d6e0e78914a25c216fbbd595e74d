x86/platform: Make platform/intel-quark/imr_selftest.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

  arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:config DEBUG_IMR_SELFTEST
  arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:    bool "Isolated Memory Region self test"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
