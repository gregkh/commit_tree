udf: Use separate buffer for copying split names

Code in udf_find_entry() and udf_readdir() used the same buffer for
storing filename that was split among blocks and for the resulting
filename in utf8. This worked because udf_get_filename() first
internally copied the name into a different buffer and only then
performed a conversion into the destination buffer. However we want to
get rid of intermediate buffers so use separate buffer for converted
name and name split between blocks so that we don't have the same source
and destination buffer when converting split names.
