Orangefs: implement .write_iter

Until now, orangefs_devreq_write_iter has just been a wrapper for
the old-fashioned orangefs_devreq_writev... linux would call
.write_iter with "struct kiocb *iocb" and "struct iov_iter *iter"
and .write_iter would just:

        return pvfs2_devreq_writev(iocb->ki_filp,
                                   iter->iov,
                                   iter->nr_segs,
                                   &iocb->ki_pos);
