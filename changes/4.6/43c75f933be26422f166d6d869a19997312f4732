x86/mm: Streamline and restore probe_memory_block_size()

The cumulative effect of the following two commits:

  bdee237c0343 ("x86: mm: Use 2GB memory block size on large-memory x86-64 systems")
  982792c782ef ("x86, mm: probe memory block size for generic x86 64bit")

... is some pretty convoluted code.

The first commit also removed code for the UV case without stated reason,
which might lead to unexpected change in behavior.

This commit has no other (intended) functional change; just seeks to simplify
and make the code more understandable, beyond restoring the UV behavior.

The whole section with the "tail size" doesn't seem to be
reachable, since both the >= 64GB and < 64GB case return, so it
was removed.
