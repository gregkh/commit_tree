lpfc: fix misleading indentation

gcc-6 complains about the indentation of the lpfc_destroy_vport_work_array()
call in lpfc_online(), which clearly doesn't look right:

drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c: In function 'lpfc_online':
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:2880:3: warning: statement is indented as if it were guarded by... [-Wmisleading-indentation]
   lpfc_destroy_vport_work_array(phba, vports);
   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:2863:2: note: ...this 'if' clause, but it is not
  if (vports != NULL)
  ^~

Looking at the patch that introduced this code, it's clear that the
behavior is correct and the indentation is wrong.

This fixes the indentation and adds curly braces around the previous
if() block for clarity, as that is most likely what caused the code
to be misindented in the first place.
