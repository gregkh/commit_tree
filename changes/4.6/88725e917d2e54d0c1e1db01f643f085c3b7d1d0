Revert "drivers/tty/serial: make 8250/8250_mtk.c explicitly non-modular"

This reverts commit d72d391c126e ("drivers/tty/serial: make
8250/8250_mtk.c explicitly non-modular"), which intended to remove dead
code but did not have the desired effect when the main 8250 driver was
a module itself.

This would normally result in a link error, but as the entire
drivers/tty/serial/8250/ directory is only entered when CONFIG_SERIAL_8250
is set, we never notice that the driver does not get built in this
configuration.
