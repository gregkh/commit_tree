rocker: set FDB cleanup timer according to lowest ageing time

In rocker, ageing time is a per-port attribute, so the next time the FDB
cleanup timer fires should be set according to the lowest ageing time.

This will later allow us to delete the BR_MIN_AGEING_TIME macro, which was
added to guarantee minimum ageing time in the bridge layer, thereby breaking
existing behavior.
