IB/mlx5: Add support for don't trap rules

Each bypass flow steering priority will be split into two priorities:
1. Priority for don't trap rules.
2. Priority for normal rules.

When user creates a flow using IB_FLOW_ATTR_FLAGS_DONT_TRAP flag, the
driver creates two flow rules, one used for receiving the traffic and
the other one for forwarding the packet to continue matching in lower
or equal priorities.
