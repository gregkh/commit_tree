usb: gadget: bdc_udc: fix race condition in bdc_udc_exit()

bdc_ep_disable() expects to be called with bdc->lock held.
The assumption is met in all the cases except for call from bdc_udc_exit(),
that is called from bdc_remove(). As a result a race can happen or unheld
bdc->lock can be unlocked in bdc_req_complete().

The patch proposes to acquire-release bdc->lock around bdc_ep_disable()
in bdc_udc_exit().
