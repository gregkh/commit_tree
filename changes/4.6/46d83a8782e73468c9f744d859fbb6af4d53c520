misc: ibmasm: Replace timeval with timespec64

This patch replaces timeval with timespec64 as 32 bit 'struct timeval'
will not give current time beyond year 2038.

The patch changes the code to use ktime_get_real_ts64() which returns
a 'struct timespec64' instead of do_gettimeofday() which returns a
'struct timeval'

This patch also alters the format strings in sprintf() for now.tv_sec
and now.tv_nsec to incorporate 'long long' on 32 bit architectures and
leading zeroes respectively.
