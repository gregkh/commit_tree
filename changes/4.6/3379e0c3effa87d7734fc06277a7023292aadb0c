perf tools: Document the perf sysctls

perf_event_paranoid was only documented in source code and a perf error
message.  Copy the documentation from the error message to
Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt.

perf_cpu_time_max_percent was already documented but missing from the
list at the top, so add it there.
