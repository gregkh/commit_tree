btrfs: avoid uninitialized variable warning

With CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT both disabled, gcc decides
to partially inline the get_state_failrec() function but cannot
figure out that means the failrec pointer is always valid
if the function returns success, which causes a harmless
warning:

fs/btrfs/extent_io.c: In function 'clean_io_failure':
fs/btrfs/extent_io.c:2131:4: error: 'failrec' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This marks get_state_failrec() and set_state_failrec() both
as 'noinline', which avoids the warning in all cases for me,
and seems less ugly than adding a fake initialization.
