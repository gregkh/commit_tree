drm/i915: Start WM computation from scratch on ILK-BDW

ilk_compute_pipe_wm() assumes as zeroed pipe_wm structure when it
starts. We used to pass such a zeroed struct in, but this got broken
when the pipe_wm structure got embedded in the crtc state.

To fix it without too much fuzz, we need to resort to a memset().
