xfs: fix format specifier , should be %llx and not %llu

busyp->bno is printed with a %llu format specifier when the
intention is to print a hexadecimal value. Trivial fix to
use %llx instead.  Found with smatch static analysis:

fs/xfs/xfs_discard.c:229 xfs_discard_extents() warn: '0x'
  prefix is confusing together with '%llu' specifier
