power/reset: versatile: support the actual versatile

While this driver is named after the Versatile family of
boards (ARM reference designs) the machine actually called
Versatile was not supported. This patch makes the driver
handle also that machine. We augment the register names for
the reset to *VERSATILE* as well since it is the same
register offsets for Versatile and RealView.
