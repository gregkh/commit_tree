arm64: mm: use bit ops rather than arithmetic in pa/va translations

Since PAGE_OFFSET is chosen such that it cuts the kernel VA space right
in half, and since the size of the kernel VA space itself is always a
power of 2, we can treat PAGE_OFFSET as a bitmask and replace the
additions/subtractions with 'or' and 'and-not' operations.

For the comparison against PAGE_OFFSET, a mov/cmp/branch sequence ends
up getting replaced with a single tbz instruction. For the additions and
subtractions, we save a mov instruction since the mask is folded into the
instruction's immediate field.
