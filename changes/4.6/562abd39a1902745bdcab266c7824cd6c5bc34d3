xen-netback: support multiple extra info fragments passed from frontend

The code does not currently support a frontend passing multiple extra info
fragments to the backend in a tx request. The xenvif_get_extras() function
handles multiple extra_info fragments but make_tx_response() assumes there
is only ever a single extra info fragment.

This patch modifies xenvif_get_extras() to pass back a count of extra
info fragments, which is then passed to make_tx_response() (after
possibly being stashed in pending_tx_info for deferred responses).
