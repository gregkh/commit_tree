lpfc: Remove redundant code block in lpfc_scsi_cmd_iocb_cmpl

This removes a redundant code block that will either be executed if the
ENABLE_FCP_RING_POLLING flag is set in phba->cfg_poll or not. The code
is just duplicated in both cases, hence we unify it again.

This probably is a left over from some sort of refactoring.
