bpf: fix csum update in bpf_l4_csum_replace helper for udp

When using this helper for updating UDP checksums, we need to extend
this in order to write CSUM_MANGLED_0 for csum computations that result
into 0 as sum. Reason we need this is because packets with a checksum
could otherwise become incorrectly marked as a packet without a checksum.
Likewise, if the user indicates BPF_F_MARK_MANGLED_0, then we should
not turn packets without a checksum into ones with a checksum.
