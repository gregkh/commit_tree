KVM: s390: irq delivery should not rely on icptcode

Program irq injection during program irq intercepts is the last candidates
that injects nullifying irqs and relies on delivery to do the right thing.

As we should not rely on the icptcode during any delivery (because that
value will not be migrated), let's add a flag, telling prog IRQ delivery
to not rewind the PSW in case of nullifying prog IRQs.
