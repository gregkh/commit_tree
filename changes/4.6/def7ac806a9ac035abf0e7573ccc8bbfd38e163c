firmware: qemu_fw_cfg.c: hold ACPI global lock during device access

Allowing for the future possibility of implementing AML-based
(i.e., firmware-triggered) access to the QEMU fw_cfg device,
acquire the global ACPI lock when accessing the device on behalf
of the guest-side sysfs driver, to prevent any potential race
conditions.
