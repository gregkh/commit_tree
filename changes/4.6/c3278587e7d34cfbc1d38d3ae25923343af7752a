igb: clean up code for setting MAC address

Drop a bunch of hand written byte swapping code in favor of just doing the
byte swapping ourselves.  The registers are little endian registers storing
a big endian value so if we read the MAC address array as little endian
then we will get the CPU registers into the proper layout.
