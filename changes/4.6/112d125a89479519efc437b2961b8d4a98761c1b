Revert "driver-core: platform: probe of-devices only using list of compatibles"

This reverts commit 67d02a1bbb334558e9380409a3cd426b36d4578b

This should reallow binding of of-devices by name.

It turned out that there are valid reasons (e.g. step by step conversion
to device tree probing using auxdata) to bind of-instantiated devices to
drivers by name. So revert to the original logic.
