dma-buf: Remove range-based flush

This patch removes range-based information used for optimizations in
begin_cpu_access and end_cpu_access.

We don't have any user nor implementation using range-based flush. It seems a
consensus that if we ever want something like that again (or even more robust
using 2D, 3D sub-range regions) we can use the upcoming dma-buf sync ioctl for
such.
