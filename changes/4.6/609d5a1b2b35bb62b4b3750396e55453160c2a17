i2c: cpm: Fix build break due to incompatible pointer types

Since commit ea8daa7b9784 ("kbuild: Add option to turn incompatible
pointer check into error"), assignments from an incompatible pointer
types have become a hard error, eg:

  drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-cpm.c:545:91: error: passing argument 3 of
  'dma_alloc_coherent' from incompatible pointer type

Fix the build break by converting txdma & rxdma to dma_addr_t.
