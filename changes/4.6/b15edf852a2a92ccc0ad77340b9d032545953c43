rocker: remove unused rocker_port param from alloc funcs and shorten their names

No need to pass rocker_port around to alloc/free rocker functions,
since they now use switchdev_trans for memory management storage.
With the param removal, shorten the name of the functions since they now
has nothing to do with rocker port.
