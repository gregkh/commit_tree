scsi: ufs: tune UniPro parameters to optimize hibern8 exit time

Optimal values of local UniPro parameters like PA_Hibern8Time &
PA_TActivate can help reduce the hibern8 exit latency. If both host and
device supports UniPro ver1.6 or later, these parameters will be
automatically tuned during link startup itself. But if either host or
device doesn't support UniPro ver 1.6 or later, we have to manually
tune them. But to keep manual tuning logic simple, we will only do
manual tuning if local unipro version doesn't support ver1.6 or later.
