mbcache2: limit cache size

So far number of entries in mbcache is limited only by the pressure from
the shrinker. Since too many entries degrade the hash table and
generally we expect that caching more entries has diminishing returns,
limit number of entries the same way as in the old mbcache to 16 * hash
table size.

Once we exceed the desired maximum number of entries, we schedule a
backround work to reclaim entries. If the background work cannot keep up
and the number of entries exceeds two times the desired maximum, we
reclaim some entries directly when allocating a new entry.
