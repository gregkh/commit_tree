ath10k: reduce rx_lock contention for htt rx indication

Received frame indications are queued into a skb list and latest
processed by txrx tasklet. This skb queue is protected by htt rx lock.
Since the entire rx processing till delivering frame to mac80211 and
replenish tasks are processed under rx_lock protection, there might be
some delay in queuing newly received rx frame into that list on
multicore systems. Optimize this by using skb list lock while accessing
rx completion queue instead of htt rx lock.
