tile kgdb: fix bug in copy to gdb regs, and optimize memset

David Binderman pointed out that we were doing a full memset()
of the gdb register buffer and then doing a memcpy() to it that
was almost as big.  This commit optimizes that by only doing a
memset() of the registers that are intended to be zero.

While making this change I noticed that we were not copying the
link register (LR, number 55) due to a fencepost error in commit
f419e6f63c5a ("arch: tile: kernel: kgdb.c: Use memcpy() instead of
pointer copy one by one"), and I've corrected that as well.
