ima: remove firmware and module specific cached status info

Each time a file is read by the kernel, the file should be re-measured and
the file signature re-appraised, based on policy.  As there is no need to
preserve the status information, this patch replaces the firmware and
module specific cache status with a generic one named read_file.

This change simplifies adding support for other files read by the kernel.
