crypto: atmel-sha - fix race in atmel_sha_final()

When (!ctx->bufcnt && !(ctx->flags & SHA_FLAGS_PAD)), the former source
code used to set the SHA_FLAGS_BUSY without checking whether this flag was
already set. If so, the hardware is already processing another hash
request so the processing of the req argument of atmel_sha_final() should
be delayed by queueing this request, the same way as done for the
(ctx->bufcnt != 0) case.
