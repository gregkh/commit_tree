iommu/rockchip: Fix "is stall active" check

Since commit cd6438c5f844 ("iommu/rockchip: Reconstruct to support multi
slaves") rk_iommu_is_stall_active() always returns false because the
bitwise AND operates on the boolean flag promoted to an integer and a
value that is either zero or BIT(2).

Explicitly convert the right-hand value to a boolean so that both sides
are guaranteed to be either zero or one.

rk_iommu_is_paging_enabled() does not suffer from the same problem since
RK_MMU_STATUS_PAGING_ENABLED is BIT(0), but let's apply the same change
for consistency and to make it clear that it's correct without needing
to lookup the value.
