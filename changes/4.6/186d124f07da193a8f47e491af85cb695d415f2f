tpm_eventlog.c: fix binary_bios_measurements

The commit 0cc698af36ff ("vTPM: support little endian guests") copied
the event, but without the event data, did an endian conversion on the
size and tried to output the event data from the copied version, which
has only have one byte of the data, resulting in garbage event data.

[jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com: fixed minor coding style issues and
 renamed the local variable tempPtr as temp_ptr now that there is an
 excuse to do this.]
