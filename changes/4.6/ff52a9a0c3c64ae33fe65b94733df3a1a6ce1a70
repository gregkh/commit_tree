serial: amba-pl011: mark vendor_zte as __maybe_unused

The pl011 driver has gone back and forth on the definition of the
ZTE specific variation of the hardware definitions, but the
current state is that the vendor definition is left in place
yet unused:

drivers/tty/serial/amba-pl011.c:190:27: warning: 'vendor_zte' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

I don't know what the plan forward is to get this code to work,
but the current behavior is a bit annoying as we get a warning
whenever we build this driver.

This patch does not help us to make it work, but at least
shuts up the warning.
