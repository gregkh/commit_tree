Input: twl6040-vibra - fix NULL pointer dereference by removing workqueue

commit 21fb9f0d5e91 ("Input: twl6040-vibra - use system workqueue")

says that it switches to use the system workqueue but it did neither

- remove the workqueue struct variable
- replace code to really use the system workqueue

Instead it calls queue_work() on uninitialized info->workqueue.

The result is a NULL pointer dereference in vibra_play().

Solution: use schedule_work
