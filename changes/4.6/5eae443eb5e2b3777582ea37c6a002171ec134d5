iwlwifi: pcie: detect and workaround invalid write ptr behavior

In 9000 series A0 step the closed_rb_num is not wrapping around
properly. The queue is wrapping around as it should, so we can
W/A it by wrapping the closed_rb_num in the driver.
While at it, extend RX logging and add error handling of other
cases HW values may cause us to access invalid memory locations.
Add also a proper masking of vid value read from HW - this should
not have actual affect, but better to be on the safe side.
