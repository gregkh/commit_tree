iio: accel: bmc150: fix endianness when reading axes

For big endian platforms, reading the axes will return
invalid values.

The device stores each axis value in a 16 bit little
endian register. The driver uses regmap_read_bulk to get
the axis value, resulting in a 16 bit little endian value.
This needs to be converted to cpu endianness to work
on big endian platforms.

Fix endianness for big endian platforms by converting
the values for the axes read from little endian to
cpu.

This is also partially fixed in commit b6fb9b6d6552 ("iio:
accel: bmc150: optimize transfers in trigger handler").
