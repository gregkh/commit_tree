cxl: Support to flash a new image on the adapter from a guest

The new flash.c file contains the logic to flash a new image on the
adapter, through a hcall. It is an iterative process, with chunks of
data of 1M at a time. There are also 2 phases: write and verify. The
flash operation itself is driven from a user-land tool.
Once flashing is successful, an rtas call is made to update the device
tree with the new properties values for the adapter and the AFU(s)

Add a new char device for the adapter, so that the flash tool can
access the card, even if there is no valid AFU on it.
