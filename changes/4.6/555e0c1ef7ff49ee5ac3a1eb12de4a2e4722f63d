perf: Migrate perf to use new tick dependency mask model

Instead of providing asynchronous checks for the nohz subsystem to verify
perf event tick dependency, migrate perf to the new mask.

Perf needs the tick for two situations:

1) Freq events. We could set the tick dependency when those are
installed on a CPU context. But setting a global dependency on top of
the global freq events accounting is much easier. If people want that
to be optimized, we can still refine that on the per-CPU tick dependency
level. This patch dooesn't change the current behaviour anyway.

2) Throttled events: this is a per-cpu dependency.
