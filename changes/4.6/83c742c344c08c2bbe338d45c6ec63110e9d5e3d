mmc: block: fix ABI regression of mmc_blk_ioctl

If mmc_blk_ioctl returns -EINVAL, blkdev_ioctl continues to
work without returning err to user-space. But now we check
CAP_SYS_RAWIO firstly, so we return -EPERM to blkdev_ioctl,
which make blkdev_ioctl return -EPERM to user-space directly.
So this will break all the ioctl with BLKROSET. Now we find
Android-adb suffer it for the following log:

remount of /system failed;
couldn't make block device writable: Operation not permitted
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/dev/block/platform/ff420000.dwmmc/by-name/system", O_RDONLY) = 3
ioctl(3, BLKROSET, 0)  = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
