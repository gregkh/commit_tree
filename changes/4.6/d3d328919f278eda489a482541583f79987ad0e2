scsi_dh: add 'rescan' callback

If a device needs to be rescanned the device_handler might need
to be rechecked, too.
So add a 'rescan' callback to the device handler and call it
upon scsi_rescan_device(). The rescan callback will be invoked
from the Unit Attention handling of ASC/ASCQ 3F 03
(INQUIRY DATA HAS CHANGED).
