drivers/video: make fbdev/sunxvr1000.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config FB_XVR1000
        bool "Sun XVR-1000 support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.
Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
