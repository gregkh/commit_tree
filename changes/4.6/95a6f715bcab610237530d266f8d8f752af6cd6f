mfd: max77686: Add max77802 to I2C device ID table

The max77686 MFD driver supports both the Maxim 77686 and Maxim 77802
PMICs but only the OF device table contains entries for both devices.

The max77802 entry is missing in the I2C device ID table which isn't
a problem currently since the driver only supports DT but it will be
needed if the driver is changed to be built as a module since the I2C
core always reports a I2C modalias uevent so auto-load will not work.
