tty: audit: Ignore current association for audit push

In canonical read mode, each line read and logged is pushed separately
with tty_audit_push(). For all single-threaded processes and multi-threaded
processes reading from only one tty, this patch has no effect; the last line
read will still be the entry pushed to the audit log because the tty
association cannot have changed between tty_audit_add_data() and
tty_audit_push().

For multi-threaded processes reading from different ttys concurrently,
the audit log will have mixed log entries anyway. Consider two ttys
audited concurrently:

CPU0                           CPU1
----------                     ------------
tty_audit_add_data(ttyA)
                               tty_audit_add_data(ttyB)
tty_audit_push()
                               tty_audit_add_data(ttyB)
                               tty_audit_push()

This patch will now cause the ttyB output to be split into separate
audit log entries.

However, this possibility is equally likely without this patch:

CPU0                           CPU1
----------                     ------------
                               tty_audit_add_data(ttyB)
tty_audit_add_data(ttyA)
tty_audit_push()
                               tty_audit_add_data(ttyB)
                               tty_audit_push()

Mixed canonical and non-canonical reads have similar races.
