tracing: Remove duplicate checks for online CPUs

Some trace events have conditions that check if the current CPU is online or
not before recording the tracepoint. That's because certain trace events are
in locations that can be called as the CPU is going offline and when RCU no
longer monitors it (like kfree and friends). The check was added because
trace events require RCU to be active.

This is a trace event infrastructure issue and not something that individual
trace events should worry about. The tracepoint.h code now has added a check
to see if the current CPU is considered online, and it only does the
tracepoint if it is. There's no more need for individual trace events to
also include this check. It is now redundant.
