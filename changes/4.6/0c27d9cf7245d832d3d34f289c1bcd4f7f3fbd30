spi: pxa2xx: Translate ACPI DeviceSelection to Linux chip select on Baytrail

The Windows Baytrail SPI host controller driver uses 1 as the first (and
only) value for ACPI DeviceSelection like can be seen in DSDT taken from
Lenovo Thinkpad 10:

    Device (FPNT)
    {
        ...
        Method (_CRS, 0, NotSerialized)  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
        {
            Name (UBUF, ResourceTemplate ()
            {
                SpiSerialBus (0x0001, // DeviceSelection
                    PolarityLow, FourWireMode, 0x08,
                    ControllerInitiated, 0x007A1200, ClockPolarityLow,
                    ClockPhaseFirst, "\\_SB.SPI1",
                    0x00, ResourceConsumer,,)

This will fail to enumerate in Linux with following error:

[    0.241296] pxa2xx-spi 80860F0E:00: cs1 >= max 1
[    0.241312] spi_master spi32766: failed to add SPI device VFSI6101:00 from ACPI

To make the Linux SPI core successfully enumerate the device we provide a
custom version of ->fw_translate_cs() that translates DeviceSelection
correctly.
