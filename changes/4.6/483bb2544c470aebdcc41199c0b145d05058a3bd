usb: dwc2: host: Add scheduler logging for missed SOFs

We'll use the new "scheduler verbose debugging" macro to log missed
SOFs.  This is fast enough (assuming you configure it to use the ftrace
buffer) that we can do it without worrying about the speed hit.  The
overhead hit if the scheduler tracing is set to "no_printk" should be
near zero.
