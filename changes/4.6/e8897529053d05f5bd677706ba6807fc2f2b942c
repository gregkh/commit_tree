xfs: XFS_DIFLAG_DAX is only for regular files or directories

Only file data can use DAX, so we should onyl be able to set this
flag on regular files. However, the flag also serves as an "inherit"
flag at file create time when set on directories, so limit the
FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR ioctl to only set this flag on regular files and
directories.
