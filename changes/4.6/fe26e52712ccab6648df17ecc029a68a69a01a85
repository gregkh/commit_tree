KVM: PPC: Add @page_shift to kvmppc_spapr_tce_table

At the moment the kvmppc_spapr_tce_table struct can only describe
4GB windows and handle fixed size (4K) pages. Dynamic DMA windows
support more so these limits need to be extended.

This replaces window_size (in bytes, 4GB max) with page_shift (32bit)
and size (64bit, in pages).

This should cause no behavioural change as this is changing
the internal structures only - the user interface still only
allows one to create a 32-bit table with 4KiB pages at this stage.
