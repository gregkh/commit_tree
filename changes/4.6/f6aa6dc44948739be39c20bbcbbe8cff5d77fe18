KVM: s390: allow sync of fp registers via vregs

If we have MACHINE_HAS_VX, the floating point registers are stored
in the vector register format, event if the guest isn't enabled for vector
registers. So we can allow KVM_SYNC_VRS as soon as MACHINE_HAS_VX is
available.

This can in return be used by user space to support floating point
registers via struct kvm_run when the machine has vector registers.
