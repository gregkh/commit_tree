crypto: ccp - CCP versioning support

Future hardware may introduce new algorithms wherein the
driver will need to manage resources for different versions
of the cryptographic coprocessor. This precursor patch
determines the version of the available device, and marks
and registers algorithms accordingly. A structure is added
which manages the version-specific data.
