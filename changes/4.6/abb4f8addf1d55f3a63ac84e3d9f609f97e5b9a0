staging: wilc1000: fix build failure

allmodconfig build of alpha, m68k, m32r, tilepro has failed with the
error:
drivers/staging/wilc1000/wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c: In function 'wilc_create_wiphy':
drivers/staging/wilc1000/wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c:2632:13:
	error: 'struct wiphy' has no member named 'wowlan'

Looking at other drivers wowlan can be only used when CONFIG_PM is
defined.
