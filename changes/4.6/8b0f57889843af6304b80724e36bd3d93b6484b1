mailbox: pcc: optimized pcc_send_data

pcc_send_data() can be invoked during the execution of performance
critical code as in cppc_cpufreq driver. With acpi_* APIs, the
doorbell register accessed in pcc_send_data() if present in system
memory will be searched (in cached virt to phys addr mapping),
mapped, read/written and then unmapped. These operations take
significant amount of time.

This patch maps the performance critical doorbell register
during init and then reads/writes to it directly using the
mapped virtual address. This patch + similar changes to CPPC
acpi driver reduce the time per freq. transition from around
200us to about 20us for the CPPC cpufreq driver
