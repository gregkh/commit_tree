i40e: set shared bit for multicast filters

Add the use of the new Shared MAC filter bit for multicast and broadcast
filters in order to make better use of the filters available from the
device.  The FW folks have assured me that setting this bit on older FW
will have no affect, so we don't need a version check.

Also fixed a stray indent problem nearby.

Also update copyright year.
