net/mlx5_core: Fix soft lockup in steering error flow

In the error flow of adding flow rule to auto-grouped flow
table, we call to tree_remove_node.

tree_remove_node locks the node's parent, however the node's parent
is already locked by mlx5_add_flow_rule and this causes a deadlock.
After this patch, if we failed to add the flow rule, we unlock the
flow table before calling to tree_remove_node.
