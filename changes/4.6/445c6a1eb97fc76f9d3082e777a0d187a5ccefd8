staging: lustre: reject invalid net configuration for lnet

Currently if there exists a route that goes over a
remote net and then this net is added dynamically as
a local net, then traffic stops because the code in
lnet_send() determines that the destination nid
can be reached from another local_ni, but the src_nid
is still stuck on the earlier NI, because the src_nid
is stored in the ptlrpc layer and is not updated
when a local NI is configured.
