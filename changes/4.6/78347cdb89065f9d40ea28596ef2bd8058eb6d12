cpufreq: governor: Reset sample delay in store_sampling_rate()

If store_sampling_rate() updates the sample delay when the ondemand
governor is in the middle of its high/low dance (OD_SUB_SAMPLE sample
type is set), the governor will still do the bottom half of the
previous sample which may take too much time.

To prevent that from happening, change store_sampling_rate() to always
reset the sample delay to 0 which also is consistent with the new
behavior of cpufreq_governor_limits().
