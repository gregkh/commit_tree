HID: sony: do not bail out when the sixaxis refuses the output report

When setting the operational mode, some third party (Speedlink Strike-FX)
gamepads refuse the output report. Failing here means we refuse to
initialize the gamepad while this should be harmless.

The weird part is that the initial commit that added this: a7de9b8
("HID: sony: Enable Gasia third-party PS3 controllers") mentions this
very same controller as one requiring this output report.
Anyway, it's broken for one user at least, so let's change it.
We will report an error, but at least the controller should work.

And no, these devices present themselves as legacy Sony controllers
(VID:PID of 054C:0268, as in the official ones) so there are no ways
of discriminating them from the official ones.
