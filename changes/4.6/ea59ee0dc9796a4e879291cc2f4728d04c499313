cpufreq: governor: Drop the gov pointer from struct dbs_data

Since it is possible to obtain a pointer to struct dbs_governor
from a pointer to the struct governor embedded in it with the help
of container_of(), the additional gov pointer in struct dbs_data
isn't really necessary.

Drop that pointer and make the code using it reach the dbs_governor
object via policy->governor.
