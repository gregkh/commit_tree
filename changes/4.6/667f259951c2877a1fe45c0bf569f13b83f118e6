ARM: dts: DRA7: Add missing IVA and DSPEVE thermal domain data

OMAP5 has 3 thermal zones cpu, core and multimedia.
On the other hand DRA7 has 5 thermal zones cpu, gpu, core, dspeve
and iva. Currently cpu, core and multimedia are being added via device tree
and the other 2 are getting added via kernel. Add the missing thermal
domains in device tree so we can create the zones with the appropriate
trip numbers, type and temperatures.
