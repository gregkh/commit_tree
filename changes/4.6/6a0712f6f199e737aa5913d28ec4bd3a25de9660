PM / OPP: Add dev_pm_opp_set_rate()

This adds a routine, dev_pm_opp_set_rate(), responsible for configuring
power-supply and clock source for an OPP.

The OPP is found by matching against the target_freq passed to the
routine. This shall replace similar code present in most of the OPP
users and help simplify them a lot.
