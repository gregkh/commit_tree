qed: Print HW attention reasons

Each HW block contains common information about attention reasons,
raising a bit for each one of the different sub-reasons that caused it
to raise an attention.

This patch extends the infrastructure by allowing logging of the various
reasons causing the HW blocks to generate an attention.
