megaraid_sas: Reply Descriptor Post Queue (RDPQ) support

This patch will create a reply queue pool for each MSI-X index and will
provide an array of base addresses instead of the single address of
legacy mode. Using this new interface the driver can support higher
queue depths through scattered DMA pools.

If array mode is not supported driver will fall back to the legacy
method of reply pool allocation. This limits controller queue depth to
1K max. To enable a queue depth of more than 1K driver requires firmware
to support array mode and scratch_pad3 will provide the new queue depth
value.

When RDPQ is used, downgrading to an older firmware release should not
be permitted. This may cause firmware fault and is not supported.
