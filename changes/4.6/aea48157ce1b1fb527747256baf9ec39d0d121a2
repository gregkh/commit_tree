staging: rtl8712: memory corruption in wpa_set_encryption()

->KeyMaterial is declared as a 16 byte array, but we only ever allocate
either 5 or 13 bytes of it.  The problem is that we memset() all 16
bytes to zero so we're memsetting past the end of the allocated memory.

I fixed this in slightly lazy way, by just allocating 16 bytes.  This
works but there is a lot more cleanup you could do to this code if you
wanted.  Which is why this code is in staging.
