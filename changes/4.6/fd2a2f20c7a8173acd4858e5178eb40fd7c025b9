mtd: onenand: make onenand_scan_bbt() static

Like was done in commit 17799359e7b3fa6ef4f2bf926cd6821cf7903ecf
("mtd: nand_bbt: make nand_scan_bbt() static") for the NAND code, this
commit makes the onenand_scan_bbt() function static in the OneNAND
code, since it is only used in onenand_bbt.c itself.

Consequently, the EXPORT_SYMBOL() and declaration in bbm.h are also
removed.
