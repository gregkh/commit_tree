hvc_xen: add earlycon support

Introduce EARLYCON support in hvc_xen, useful for early debugging on arm
and arm64, where xen early_printk is not available.

It is different from xenboot_write_console on x86 in two ways:

- it does not return if !xen_pv_domain(), not only because ARM guests
  are xen_hvm_domain(), but also because we want to capture all the
  early boot messages, before xen support is discovered
- it does not try to print to the domU console at all, because xen
  support will only be discovered at a later point
