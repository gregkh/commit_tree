radix-tree,shmem: introduce radix_tree_iter_next()

shmem likes to occasionally drop the lock, schedule, then reacqire the
lock and continue with the iteration from the last place it left off.
This is currently done with a pretty ugly goto.  Introduce
radix_tree_iter_next() and use it throughout shmem.c.
