veth: implement ndo_set_rx_headroom

The rx headroom for veth dev is the peer device needed_headroom.
Avoid ping-pong updates setting the private flag IFF_PHONY_HEADROOM.

This avoids skb head reallocation when forwarding from a veth dev
towards a device adding some kind of encapsulation.

When transmitting frames below the MTU size towards a vxlan device,
this gives about 10% performance speed-up when OVS is used to connect
the veth and the vxlan device and a little more when using a
plain Linux bridge.
