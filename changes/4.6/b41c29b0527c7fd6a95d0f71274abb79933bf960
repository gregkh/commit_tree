Kbuild: provide a __UNIQUE_ID for clang

The default __UNIQUE_ID macro in compiler.h fails to work for some drivers:

drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/sdio.c:615:1: error: redefinition of
      '__UNIQUE_ID_firmware615'
BRCMF_FW_NVRAM_DEF(4354, "brcmfmac4354-sdio.bin", "brcmfmac4354-sdio.txt");

This adds a copy of the version we use for gcc-4.3 and higher, as the same
one works with all versions of clang that I could find in svn (2.6 and higher).
