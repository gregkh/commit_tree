Drivers: hv: vmbus: avoid infinite loop in init_vp_index()

When we pick a CPU to use for a new subchannel we try find a non-used one
on the appropriate NUMA node, we keep track of them with the
primary->alloced_cpus_in_node mask. Under normal circumstances we don't run
out of available CPUs but it is possible when we we don't initialize some
cpus in Linux, e.g. when we boot with 'nr_cpus=' limitation.

Avoid the infinite loop in init_vp_index() by checking that we still have
non-used CPUs in the alloced_cpus_in_node mask and resetting it in case
we don't.
