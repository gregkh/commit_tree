ARM: dts: armada-38x: add buffer manager nodes

Armada 38x network controller supports hardware buffer management (BM).
Since it is now enabled in mvneta driver, appropriate nodes can be added
to armada-38x.dtsi - for the actual common BM unit (bm@c8000) and its
internal SRAM (bm-bppi), which is used for indirect access to buffer
pointer ring residing in DRAM.

Pools - ports mapping, bm-bppi entry in 'soc' node's ranges and optional
parameters are supposed to be set in board files.
