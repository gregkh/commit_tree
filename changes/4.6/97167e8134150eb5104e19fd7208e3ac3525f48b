staging/rdma/hfi1: Tune for unknown channel if configuration file is absent

Currently, the driver fails to tune the SerDes and therefore prevents
link up if the configuration file is missing or fails parsing or
validation. This patch adds a fallback option so that the 8051 is asked
to tune for an unknown channel and possibly get the link up if tuning
succeeds. It also adds a user-friendly message to update the
configuration file if it is out-of-date.
