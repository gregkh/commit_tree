hrtimer: Add support for CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW

The KVM/ARM timer implementation arms a hrtimer when a vcpu is
blocked (usually because it is waiting for an interrupt)
while its timer is going to kick in the future.

It is essential that this timer doesn't get adjusted, or the
guest will end up being woken-up at the wrong time (NTP running
on the host seems to confuse the hell out of some guests).

In order to allow this, let's add CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW support
to hrtimer (it is so far only supported for posix timers). It also
has the (limited) benefit of fixing de0421d53bfb ("mac80211_hwsim:
shuffle code to prepare for dynamic radios"), which already uses
this functionnality without realizing wasn't implemented (just being
lucky...).
