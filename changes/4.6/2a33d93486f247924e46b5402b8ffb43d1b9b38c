drm/i915/bios: add support for MIPI sequence block v3

The changes since the sequence block v2 are:

* The whole MIPI bios data block has a separate 32-bit size field since
  v3, stored after the version. This facilitates big sequences.

* The size of the panel specific sequence blocks has grown to 32
  bits. This facilitates big sequences.

* The elements within sequences now have an 8-bit size field following
  the operation byte. This facilitates skipping unknown new operation
  bytes, i.e. forward compatibility.

v2 (of the patch): use DRM_ERROR for unknown operation byte
v3 (of the patch): even more bounds checking (Ville)
