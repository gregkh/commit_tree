i2c: prevent endless uevent loop with CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE

Jan reported this:

===
After enabling CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE my system was broken
(no network, console login not possible). System log was
flooded with the this message:

 ...
[  608.052077] rtc-ds1307 0-0068: uevent
[  608.052500] rtc-ds1307 0-0068: uevent
[  608.052925] rtc-ds1307 0-0068: uevent
 ...

The culprit is the dev_dbg printk in the i2c uevent handler.
If this is activated (for instance by CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE)
it results in an endless loop with systemd-journald.

This happens if user-space scans the system log and reads the uevent
file to get information about a newly created device, which seems fair
use to me. Unfortunately reading the "uevent" file uses the same
function that runs for creating the uevent for a new device,
generating the next syslog entry.

Ideally user-space would implement a recursion detection and
after reading the same device file for the 1000th time call it a
day, but nevertheless I think we should avoid this problem by
removing the debug print completely or using another print variant.

The same problem seems to be reported here:

His patch converted the message to pr_debug, but I think the debug can
simply go. We have other means to see code paths these days. This
enables us to clean up the function some more while we are here.
