Implement an ioctl to support the USMTMC-USB488 READ_STATUS_BYTE operation.

Background:
When performing a read on an instrument that is executing a function
that runs longer than the USB timeout the instrument may hang and
require a device reset to recover. The READ_STATUS_BYTE operation
always returns even when the instrument is busy permitting to poll
for the appropriate condition. This capability is referred to in
instrument application notes on synchronizing acquisitions for other
platforms.
