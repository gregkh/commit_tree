net/ethtool: support get coalesce per queue

This patch implements sub command ETHTOOL_GCOALESCE for ioctl
ETHTOOL_PERQUEUE. It introduces an interface get_per_queue_coalesce to
get coalesce of each masked queue from device driver. Then the interrupt
coalescing parameters will be copied back to user space one by one.
