sched/deadline: Remove dl_new from struct sched_dl_entity

The dl_new field of struct sched_dl_entity is currently used to
identify new deadline tasks, so that their deadline and runtime
can be properly initialised.

However, these tasks can be easily identified by checking if
their deadline is smaller than the current time when they switch
to SCHED_DEADLINE. So, dl_new can be removed by introducing this
check in switched_to_dl(); this allows to simplify the
SCHED_DEADLINE code.
