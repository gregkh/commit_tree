vxlan: support setting IPv6 flow label

This work adds support for setting the IPv6 flow label for vxlan per
device and through collect metadata (ip_tunnel_key) frontends. The
vxlan dst cache does not need any special considerations here, for
the cases where caches can be used, the label is static per cache.
