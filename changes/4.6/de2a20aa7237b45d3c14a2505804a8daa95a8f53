powerpc: Prepare for splitting giveup_{fpu, altivec, vsx} in two

This prepares for the decoupling of saving {fpu,altivec,vsx} registers and
marking {fpu,altivec,vsx} as being unused by a thread.

Currently giveup_{fpu,altivec,vsx}() does both however optimisations to
task switching can be made if these two operations are decoupled.
save_all() will permit the saving of registers to thread structs and leave
threads MSR with bits enabled.

This patch introduces no functional change.
