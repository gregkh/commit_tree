mm/debug_pagealloc: ask users for default setting of debug_pagealloc

Since commit 031bc5743f158 ("mm/debug-pagealloc: make debug-pagealloc
boottime configurable") CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is by default not adding
any page debugging.

This resulted in several unnoticed bugs, e.g.

    https://lkml.kernel.org/g/<569F5E29.3090107@de.ibm.com>
or
    https://lkml.kernel.org/g/<56A20F30.4050705@de.ibm.com>

as this behaviour change was not even documented in Kconfig.

Let's provide a new Kconfig symbol that allows to change the default
back to enabled, e.g.  for debug kernels.  This also makes the change
obvious to kernel packagers.

Let's also change the Kconfig description for CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, to
indicate that there are two stages of overhead.
