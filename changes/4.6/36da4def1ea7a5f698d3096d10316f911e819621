clk: s2mps11: remove redundant static variables declaration

The clk_table and clk_data are declared static. The clk_table
contains the three clock data structures belonging to the s2mps11
driver. In the probe function it gets stored into clk_data.

Remove clk_table and refer directly to clk_data.

clk_data, itself, is also declared static. Declare locally it
and allocate it inside the probe function, as it is not used
anywhere else.
