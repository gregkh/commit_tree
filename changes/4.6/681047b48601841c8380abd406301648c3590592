drm: Clean up pending events in the core

There's really no reason to not do so, instead of replicating this
for every use-case and every driver. Now we can't just nuke the events,
since that would still mean that all drm_event users would need to know
when that has happened, since calling e.g. drm_send_event isn't allowed
any more. Instead just unlink them from the file, and detect this case
and handle it appropriately in all functions.

v2: Adjust existing kerneldoc too.

v3: Improve wording of the kerneldoc and split out vblank cleanup (Laurent).
