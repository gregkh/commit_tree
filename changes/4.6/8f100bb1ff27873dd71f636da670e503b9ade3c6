s390/cpumf: add missing lpp magic initialization

Add the missing lpp magic initialization for cpu 0. Without this all
samples on cpu 0 do not have the most significant bit set in the
program parameter field, which we use to distinguish between guest and
host samples if the pid is also 0.

We did initialize the lpp magic in the absolute zero lowcore but
forgot that when switching to the allocated lowcore on cpu 0 only.
