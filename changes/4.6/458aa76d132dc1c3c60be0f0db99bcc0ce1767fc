mm/thp/migration: switch from flush_tlb_range to flush_pmd_tlb_range

We remove one instace of flush_tlb_range here.  That was added by commit
f714f4f20e59 ("mm: numa: call MMU notifiers on THP migration").  But the
pmdp_huge_clear_flush_notify should have done the require flush for us.
Hence remove the extra flush.
