KVM: s390: sync of fp registers via kvm_run

As we already store the floating point registers in the vector save area
in floating point register format when we don't have MACHINE_HAS_VX, we can
directly expose them to user space using a new sync flag.

The floating point registers will be valid when KVM_SYNC_FPRS is set. The
fpc will also be valid when KVM_SYNC_FPRS is set.

Either KVM_SYNC_FPRS or KVM_SYNC_VRS will be enabled, never both.

Let's also change two positions where we access vrs, making the code easier
to read and one comment superfluous.
