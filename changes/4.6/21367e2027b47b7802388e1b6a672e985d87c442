ibmvfc: byteswap scsi_id, wwpn, and node_name prior to logging

When logging async events the scsi_id, wwpn, and node_name values are
used directly from the CRQ struct which are of type __be64. This can be
confusing to someone looking through the log on a LE system.  Instead
byteswap these values to host endian prior to logging.
