s390/mm: uninline ptep_xxx functions from pgtable.h

The code in the various ptep_xxx functions has grown quite large,
consolidate them to four out-of-line functions:
  ptep_xchg_direct to exchange a pte with another with immediate flushing
  ptep_xchg_lazy to exchange a pte with another in a batched update
  ptep_modify_prot_start to begin a protection flags update
  ptep_modify_prot_commit to commit a protection flags update
