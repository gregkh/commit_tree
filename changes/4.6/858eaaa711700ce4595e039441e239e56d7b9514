mm/rmap: batched invalidations should use existing api

The recently introduced batched invalidations mechanism uses its own
mechanism for shootdown.  However, it does wrong accounting of
interrupts (e.g., inc_irq_stat is called for local invalidations),
trace-points (e.g., TLB_REMOTE_SHOOTDOWN for local invalidations) and
may break some platforms as it bypasses the invalidation mechanisms of
Xen and SGI UV.

This patch reuses the existing TLB flushing mechnaisms instead.  We use
NULL as mm to indicate a global invalidation is required.

Fixes 72b252aed506b8 ("mm: send one IPI per CPU to TLB flush all entries after unmapping pages")
