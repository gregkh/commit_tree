x86/microcode/intel: Move the BUG_ON up and turn it into WARN_ON

If we're going to BUG_ON() because we're running on the wrong CPU, we
better do it as the first thing we do when entering that function. And
also, turn it into a WARN_ON() because it is not worth to panic the
system if we apply the microcode on the wrong CPU - we're simply going
to exit early.
