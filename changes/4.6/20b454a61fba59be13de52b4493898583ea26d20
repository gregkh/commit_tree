cgroup: suppress spurious de-populated events

During task migration, tasks may transfer between two css_sets which
are associated with the same cgroup.  If those tasks are the only
tasks in the cgroup, this currently triggers a spurious de-populated
event on the cgroup.

Fix it by bumping up populated count before bumping it down during
migration to ensure that it doesn't reach zero spuriously.
