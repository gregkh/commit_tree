staging/lustre/libcfs: Properly handle debugfs read- and write-only files

It turns out that unlike procfs, debugfs does not really enforce
permissions for root (similar to regular filesystems), so we need
to ensure we are not providing ->write() method to read-only files
and ->read() method for write-only files at registration.

This fixes a couple of crashes on unexpected access.
