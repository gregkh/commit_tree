KVM: Pass kvm_init()'s opaque param to additional arch funcs

Pass @opaque to kvm_arch_hardware_setup() and
kvm_arch_check_processor_compat() to allow architecture specific code to
reference @opaque without having to stash it away in a temporary global
variable.  This will enable x86 to separate its vendor specific callback
ops, which are passed via @opaque, into "init" and "runtime" ops without
having to stash away the "init" ops.

No functional change intended.
