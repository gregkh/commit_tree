wireguard: receive: use tunnel helpers for decapsulating ECN markings

WireGuard currently only propagates ECN markings on tunnel decap according
to the old RFC3168 specification. However, the spec has since been updated
in RFC6040 to recommend slightly different decapsulation semantics. This
was implemented in the kernel as a set of common helpers for ECN
decapsulation, so let's just switch over WireGuard to using those, so it
can benefit from this enhancement and any future tweaks. We do not drop
packets with invalid ECN marking combinations, because WireGuard is
frequently used to work around broken ISPs, which could be doing that.
