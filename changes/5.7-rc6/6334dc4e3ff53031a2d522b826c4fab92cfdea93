EDAC/mc: Carve out error increment into a separate function

Carve out the error_count increment into a separate function
edac_inc_csrow(). This better separates code and reduces the indentation
level.

Implementation note: The function edac_inc_csrow() counts the same
as before, ->ce_count is only incremented if row >= 0. This is esp.
true for the case of (!e->enable_per_layer_report). Here, a DIMM was
not found, variable row still has a value of -1 and ->ce_count is not
incremented.
