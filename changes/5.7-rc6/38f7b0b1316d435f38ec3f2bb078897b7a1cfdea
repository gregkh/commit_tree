hrtimer: Cast explicitely to u32t in __ktime_divns()

do_div() does a 64-by-32 division at least on 32bit platforms, while the
divisor 'div' is explicitly casted to unsigned long, thus 64-bit on 64-bit
platforms.

The code already ensures that the divisor is less than 2^32. Hence the
proper cast type is u32.
