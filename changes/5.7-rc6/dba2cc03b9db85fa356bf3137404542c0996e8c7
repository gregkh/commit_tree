scsi: pm80xx: sysfs attribute for non fatal dump

Added the sysfs attribute for non fatal log so that management utility can
get the non fatal dump from driver. The non-fatal error is an error
condition or abnormal behavior detected by the host, or detected and
reported by the controller to the host.The non-fatal error does not stop
the controller firmware and enables it to still respond to host requests.
A typical example of a non-fatal error is an I/O timeout or an unusual
error notification from the controller. Since the firmware is operational,
the error dump information is pushed to host memory (by firmware) upon
request from the host.
