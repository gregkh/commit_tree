arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Reduce vdd_apc voltage

Some msm8996 based devices are unstable when run with VDD_APC of 1.23V,
which is listed as the maximum voltage in "Turbo" mode. Given that the
CPU cluster is not run in "Turbo" mode, reduce this to 0.98V - the
maximum voltage for nominal operation.
