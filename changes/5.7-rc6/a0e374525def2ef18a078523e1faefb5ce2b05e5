libnvdimm/region: Introduce NDD_LABELING

The NDD_ALIASING flag is used to indicate where pmem capacity might
alias with blk capacity and require labeling. It is also used to
indicate whether the DIMM supports labeling. Separate this latter
capability into its own flag so that the NDD_ALIASING flag is scoped to
true aliased configurations.

To my knowledge aliased configurations only exist in the ACPI spec,
there are no known platforms that ship this support in production.

This clarity allows namespace-capacity alignment constraints around
interleave-ways to be relaxed.
