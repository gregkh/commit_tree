ASoC: samsung: s3c24xx-i2s: Fix build after removal of DAI suspend/resume

Commit 450312b640f9 ("ASoC: soc-core: remove DAI suspend/resume")
removed the DAI side suspend/resume hooks and switched entirely to
component suspend/resume.  However the Samsung SoC s3c-i2s-v2 driver was
not updated.

Move the suspend/resume hooks from s3c-i2s-v2.c to s3c2412-i2s.c while
changing dai to component which allows to keep the struct
snd_soc_component_driver const.

This fixes build errors:

    sound/soc/samsung/s3c-i2s-v2.c: In function ‘s3c_i2sv2_register_component’:
    sound/soc/samsung/s3c-i2s-v2.c:730:9: error: ‘struct snd_soc_dai_driver’ has no member named ‘suspend’
      dai_drv->suspend = s3c2412_i2s_suspend;
