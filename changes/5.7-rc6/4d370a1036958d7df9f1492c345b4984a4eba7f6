crypto: caam - change return code in caam_jr_enqueue function

Based on commit 6b80ea389a0b ("crypto: change transient busy return code to -ENOSPC"),
change the return code of caam_jr_enqueue function to -EINPROGRESS, in
case of success, -ENOSPC in case the CAAM is busy (has no space left
in job ring queue), -EIO if it cannot map the caller's descriptor.

Update, also, the cases for resource-freeing for each algorithm type.

This is done for later use, on backlogging support in CAAM.
