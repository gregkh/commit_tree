x86/resctrl: Preserve CDP enable over CPU hotplug

Resctrl assumes that all CPUs are online when the filesystem is mounted,
and that CPUs remember their CDP-enabled state over CPU hotplug.

This goes wrong when resctrl's CDP-enabled state changes while all the
CPUs in a domain are offline.

When a domain comes online, enable (or disable!) CDP to match resctrl's
current setting.
