xtensa: replace setup_irq() by request_irq()

request_irq() is preferred over setup_irq(). Invocations of setup_irq()
occur after memory allocators are ready.

Per tglx[1], setup_irq() existed in olden days when allocators were not
ready by the time early interrupts were initialized.

Hence replace setup_irq() by request_irq().
