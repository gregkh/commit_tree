dt-bindings: arm: add Rockchip rk3036-evb board

A test with the command below gives this error:

arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-evb.dt.yaml: /: compatible:
['rockchip,rk3036-evb', 'rockchip,rk3036']
is not valid under any of the given schemas

This board was somehow never added to the documentation.
Fix this error by adding the rk3036-evb board to rockchip.yaml.

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/rockchip.yaml
