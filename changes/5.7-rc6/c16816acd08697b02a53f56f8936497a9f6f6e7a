genirq: Add protection against unsafe usage of generic_handle_irq()

In general calling generic_handle_irq() with interrupts disabled from non
interrupt context is harmless. For some interrupt controllers like the x86
trainwrecks this is outright dangerous as it might corrupt state if an
interrupt affinity change is pending.

Add infrastructure which allows to mark interrupts as unsafe and catch such
usage in generic_handle_irq().
