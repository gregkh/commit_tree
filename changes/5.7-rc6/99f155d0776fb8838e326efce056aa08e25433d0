dt-bindings: display: drop data-mapping from panel-dpi

data-mapping may not be the best way to describe the
data format used between panels and display interface.

Drop it from the panel-dpi binding so we do not start to rely on it.
We can then work out how to best describe this mapping and when
we know it, we can add it to this binding.
