libbpf: Don't allocate 16M for log buffer by default

For each prog/btf load we allocate and free 16 megs of verifier buffer.
On production systems it doesn't really make sense because the
programs/btf have gone through extensive testing and (mostly) guaranteed
to successfully load.

Let's assume successful case by default and skip buffer allocation
on the first try. If there is an error, start with BPF_LOG_BUF_SIZE
and double it on each ENOSPC iteration.

v3:
* Return -ENOMEM when can't allocate log buffer (Andrii Nakryiko)

v2:
* Don't allocate the buffer at all on the first try (Andrii Nakryiko)
