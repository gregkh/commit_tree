btrfs: use inode from io_ctl in io_ctl_prepare_pages

io_ctl_prepare_pages() gets a 'struct btrfs_io_ctl' as well as a 'struct
inode', but btrfs_io_ctl::inode points to the same struct inode as this is
assgined in io_ctl_init().

Use the inode form io_ctl to reduce the arguments of io_ctl_prepare_pages.
