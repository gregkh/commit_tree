audit: check the length of userspace generated audit records

Commit 756125289285 ("audit: always check the netlink payload length
in audit_receive_msg()") fixed a number of missing message length
checks, but forgot to check the length of userspace generated audit
records.  The good news is that you need CAP_AUDIT_WRITE to submit
userspace audit records, which is generally only given to trusted
processes, so the impact should be limited.
