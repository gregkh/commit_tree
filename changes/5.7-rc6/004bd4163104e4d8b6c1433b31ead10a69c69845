ASoC: soc-acpi: expand description of _ADR-based devices

For SoundWire, we need to know if endpoints needs to be 'aggregated'
(MIPI parlance, meaning logically grouped), e.g. when two speaker
amplifiers need to be handled as a single logical output.

We don't necessarily have the information at the firmware (BIOS)
level, so add a notion of endpoints and specify if a device/endpoint
is part of a group, with a position.

This may be expanded in future solutions, for now only provide a group
and position information.

Since we modify the header file, change all existing upstream tables
as well to avoid breaking compilation/bisect.
