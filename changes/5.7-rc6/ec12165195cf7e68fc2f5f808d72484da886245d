mlxsw: core_acl_flex_actions: Add trap with userdef action

Expose "Trap action with userdef". It is the same as already
defined "Trap action" with a difference that it would ask the policy
engine to pass arbitrary value (userdef) alongside with received packets.
This would be later on used to carry cookie index.
