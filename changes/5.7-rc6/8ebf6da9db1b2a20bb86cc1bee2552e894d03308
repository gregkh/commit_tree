s390/ftrace: fix potential crashes when switching tracers

Switching tracers include instruction patching. To prevent that a
instruction is patched while it's read the instruction patching is done
in stop_machine 'context'. This also means that any function called
during stop_machine must not be traced. Thus add 'notrace' to all
functions called within stop_machine.
