rtc: davinci: remove useless 24h alarm handling

The code handling invalid alarms meaning the alarm is in the next 24 hours
is not necessary since commit f8245c26886c ("rtc: remove "RTC_ALM_SET mode"
bugs") which actually predates this driver. Since then, .set_alarm is never
called with an invalid alarm and this handling is not necessary in the
driver.
