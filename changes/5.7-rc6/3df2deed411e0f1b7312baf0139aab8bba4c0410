drm/i915/execlists: Enable timeslice on partial virtual engine dequeue

If we stop filling the ELSP due to an incompatible virtual engine
request, check if we should enable the timeslice on behalf of the queue.

This fixes the case where we are inspecting the last->next element when
we know that the last element is the last request in the execution queue,
and so decided we did not need to enable timeslicing despite the intent
to do so!
