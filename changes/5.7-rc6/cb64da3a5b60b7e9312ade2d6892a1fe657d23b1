net: phy: broadcom: Have bcm54xx_adjust_rxrefclk() check for flags

bcm54xx_adjust_rxrefclk() already checks for PHY_BRCM_AUTO_PWRDWN_ENABLE
and PHY_BRCM_DIS_TXCRXC_NOENRGY in order to set the appropriate bit. The
situation is a bit more complicated with the flag
PHY_BRCM_RX_REFCLK_UNUSED but essentially amounts to the same situation.

The default setting for the 125MHz clock is to be on for all PHYs and
we still treat BCM50610 and BCM50610M specifically with the polarity of
the bit reversed.
