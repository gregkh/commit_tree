powerpc/eeh: Remove PHB check in probe

This check for a missing PHB has existing in various forms since the
initial PPC64 port was upstreamed in 2002. The idea seems to be that we
need to guard against creating pci-specific data structures for the non-pci
children of a PCI device tree node (e.g. USB devices). However, we only
create pci_dn structures for DT nodes that correspond to PCI devices so
there's not much point in doing this check in the eeh_probe path.
