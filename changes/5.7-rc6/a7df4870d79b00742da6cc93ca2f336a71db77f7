net_sched: fix tcm_parent in tc filter dump

When we tell kernel to dump filters from root (ffff:ffff),
those filters on ingress (ffff:0000) are matched, but their
true parents must be dumped as they are. However, kernel
dumps just whatever we tell it, that is either ffff:ffff
or ffff:0000:

 $ nl-cls-list --dev=dummy0 --parent=root
 cls basic dev dummy0 id none parent root prio 49152 protocol ip match-all
 cls basic dev dummy0 id :1 parent root prio 49152 protocol ip match-all
 $ nl-cls-list --dev=dummy0 --parent=ffff:
 cls basic dev dummy0 id none parent ffff: prio 49152 protocol ip match-all
 cls basic dev dummy0 id :1 parent ffff: prio 49152 protocol ip match-all

This is confusing and misleading, more importantly this is
a regression since 4.15, so the old behavior must be restored.

And, when tc filters are installed on a tc class, the parent
should be the classid, rather than the qdisc handle. Commit
edf6711c9840 ("net: sched: remove classid and q fields from tcf_proto")
removed the classid we save for filters, we can just restore
this classid in tcf_block.

Steps to reproduce this:
 ip li set dev dummy0 up
 tc qd add dev dummy0 ingress
 tc filter add dev dummy0 parent ffff: protocol arp basic action pass
 tc filter show dev dummy0 root

Before this patch:
 filter protocol arp pref 49152 basic
 filter protocol arp pref 49152 basic handle 0x1
	action order 1: gact action pass
	 random type none pass val 0
	 index 1 ref 1 bind 1

After this patch:
 filter parent ffff: protocol arp pref 49152 basic
 filter parent ffff: protocol arp pref 49152 basic handle 0x1
 	action order 1: gact action pass
 	 random type none pass val 0
	 index 1 ref 1 bind 1
