drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Train at faster rates if slower ones fail

If we fail training at a lower DP link rate let's now keep trying
until we run out of rates to try.  Basically the algorithm here is to
start at the link rate that is the theoretical minimum and then slowly
bump up until we run out of rates or hit the max rate of the sink.  We
query the sink using a DPCD read.

This is, in fact, important in practice.  Specifically at least one
panel hooked up to the bridge (AUO B116XAK01) had a theoretical min
rate more than 1.62 GHz (if run at 24 bpp) and fails to train at the
next rate (2.16 GHz).  It would train at 2.7 GHz, though.
