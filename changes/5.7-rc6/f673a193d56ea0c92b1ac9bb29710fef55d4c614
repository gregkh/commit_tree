iwlwifi: add Pu/PnJ/Th device values to differentiate them

Pu, PnJ and Th devices have different combinations of PCI ID, MAC ID
and RF IDs.  Use these to differentiate them and choose the correct
configuration.

This also includes a change from using soc cfg's for 0x2526
devices (PnJ/Th), which was incorrect.
