RISC-V: Move relocate and few other functions out of __init

The secondary hart booting and relocation code are under .init section.
As a result, it will be freed once kernel booting is done. However,
ordered booting protocol and CPU hotplug always requires these functions
to be present to bringup harts after initial kernel boot.

Move the required functions to a different section and make sure that
they are in memory within first 2MB offset as trampoline page directory
only maps first 2MB.
