net: mptcp: don't hang in mptcp_sendmsg() after TCP fallback

it's still possible for packetdrill to hang in mptcp_sendmsg(), when the
MPTCP socket falls back to regular TCP (e.g. after receiving unsupported
flags/version during the three-way handshake). Adjust MPTCP socket state
earlier, to ensure correct functionality of mptcp_sendmsg() even in case
of TCP fallback.

Fixes: 767d3ded5fb8 ("net: mptcp: don't hang before sending 'MP capable with data'")
Fixes: 1954b86016cf ("mptcp: Check connection state before attempting send")
