perf diff: Use __block_info__cmp() to replace block_pair_cmp()

'perf diff' uses block_pair_cmp() to compare two blocks. But
block_info__cmp() has the similar functionality and it's a bit more
complete.

This patch removes block_pair_cmp() and uses __block_info__cmp()
instead. __block_info__cmp() is wrapped by block_info__cmp() and it
doesn't receives a perf_hpp_fmt parameter.
