random: Make RANDOM_TRUST_CPU depend on ARCH_RANDOM

Listing the set of host architectures does not scale.
Depend instead on the existence of the architecture rng.

This will allow RANDOM_TRUST_CPU to be selected on arm64. Today
ARCH_RANDOM is only selected by x86, s390, and powerpc, so this does not
adversely affect other architectures.
