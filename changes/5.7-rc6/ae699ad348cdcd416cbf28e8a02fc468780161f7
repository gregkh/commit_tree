irqchip/gic-v4.1: Move doorbell management to the GICv4 abstraction layer

In order to hide some of the differences between v4.0 and v4.1, move
the doorbell management out of the KVM code, and into the GICv4-specific
layer. This allows the calling code to ask for the doorbell when blocking,
and otherwise to leave the doorbell permanently disabled.

This matches the v4.1 code perfectly, and only results in a minor
refactoring of the v4.0 code.
