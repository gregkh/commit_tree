vt: vt_ioctl: fix use-after-free in vt_in_use()

vt_in_use() dereferences console_driver->ttys[i] without proper locking.
This is broken because the tty can be closed and freed concurrently.

We could fix this by using 'READ_ONCE(console_driver->ttys[i]) != NULL'
and skipping the check of tty_struct::count.  But, looking at
console_driver->ttys[i] isn't really appropriate anyway because even if
it is NULL the tty can still be in the process of being closed.

Instead, fix it by making vt_in_use() require console_lock() and check
whether the vt is allocated and has port refcount > 1.  This works since
following the patch "vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use
virtual console" the port refcount is incremented while the vt is open.

Reproducer (very unreliable, but it worked for me after a few minutes):

	#include <fcntl.h>
	#include <linux/vt.h>

	int main()
	{
		int fd, nproc;
		struct vt_stat state;
		char ttyname[16];

		fd = open("/dev/tty10", O_RDONLY);
		for (nproc = 1; nproc < 8; nproc *= 2)
			fork();
		for (;;) {
			sprintf(ttyname, "/dev/tty%d", rand() % 8);
			close(open(ttyname, O_RDONLY));
			ioctl(fd, VT_GETSTATE, &state);
		}
	}
