SUNRPC/cache: don't allow invalid entries to be flushed

Trond points out in commit 277f27e2f277 ("SUNRPC/cache: Allow
garbage collection of invalid cache entries") that we allow invalid
cache entries to persist indefinitely. That fix, however,
reintroduces the problem fixed by Kinglong Mee's commit d6fc8821c2d2
("SUNRPC/Cache: Always treat the invalid cache as unexpired"), where
an invalid cache entry is immediately removed by a flush before
mountd responds to it. The result is that the server thread that
should be waiting for mountd to fill in that entry instead gets an
-ETIMEDOUT return from cache_check(). Symptoms are the server
becoming unresponsive after a restart, reproduceable by running
pynfs 4.1 test REBT5.

Instead, take a compromise approach: allow invalid cache entries to
be removed after they expire, but not to be removed by a cache
flush.
