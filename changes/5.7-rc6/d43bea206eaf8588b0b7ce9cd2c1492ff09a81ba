speakup: misc: Use dynamic minor numbers for speakup devices

Arnd notes in the link:
   | To clarify: the only numbers that I think should be changed to dynamic
   | allocation are for drivers/staging/speakup. While this is a fairly old
   | subsystem, I would expect that it being staging means we can be a
   | little more progressive with the changes.

This releases misc device minor numbers 25-27 for dynamic usage.
