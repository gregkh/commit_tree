partitions/efi: Fix partition name parsing in GUID partition entry

GUID partition entry defined to have a partition name as 36 UTF-16LE
code units. This means that on big-endian platforms ASCII symbols
would be read with 0xXX00 efi_char16_t character code. In order to
correctly extract ASCII characters from a partition name field we
should be converted from 16LE to CPU architecture.

The problem exists on all big endian platforms.
