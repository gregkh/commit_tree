ALSA: hda/hdmi: fix race in monitor detection during probe

A race exists between build_pcms() and build_controls() phases of codec
setup. Build_pcms() sets up notifier for jack events. If a monitor event
is received before build_controls() is run, the initial jack state is
lost and never reported via mixer controls.

The problem can be hit at least with SOF as the controller driver. SOF
calls snd_hda_codec_build_controls() in its workqueue-based probe and
this can be delayed enough to hit the race condition.

Fix the issue by invalidating the per-pin ELD information when
build_controls() is called. The existing call to hdmi_present_sense()
will update the ELD contents. This ensures initial monitor state is
correctly reflected via mixer controls.
