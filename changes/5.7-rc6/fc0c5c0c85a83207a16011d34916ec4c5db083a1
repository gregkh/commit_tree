floppy: prepare ARM code to simplify base address separation

The fd_outb() macro on ARM relies on a special fd_setdor() macro when
the register is FD_DOR and both will need to be changed to accept a
separate base address. Let's just remerge them to simplify the change
and make this code more easily reviewable.
