drm/i915: panel: Use intel_panel_compute_brightness() from pwm_setup_backlight()

Use intel_panel_compute_brightness() from pwm_setup_backlight() so that
we correctly take i915_modparams.invert_brightness and/or
QUIRK_INVERT_BRIGHTNESS into account when setting + getting the initial
brightness value.
