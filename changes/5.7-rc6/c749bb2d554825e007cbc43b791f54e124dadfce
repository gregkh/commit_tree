riscv: set max_pfn to the PFN of the last page

The current max_pfn equals to zero. In this case, I found it caused users
cannot get some page information through /proc such as kpagecount in v5.6
kernel because of new sanity checks. The following message is displayed by
stress-ng test suite with the command "stress-ng --verbose --physpage 1 -t
1" on HiFive unleashed board.

After applying this patch, the kernel can pass the test.

 # stress-ng --verbose --physpage 1 -t 1
