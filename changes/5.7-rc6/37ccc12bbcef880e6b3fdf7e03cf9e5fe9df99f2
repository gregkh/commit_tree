tools/runqslower: Add BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU for running selftest on older kernels

Libbpf compiles and runs subset of selftests on each PR in its Github mirror
repository. To allow still building up-to-date selftests against outdated
kernel images, add back BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU definitions back.

N.B. BCC's runqslower version ([0]) doesn't need BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU due to use of
locally checked in vmlinux.h, generated against kernel with 1aae4bdd7879 ("bpf:
Switch BPF UAPI #define constants used from BPF program side to enums")
applied.
