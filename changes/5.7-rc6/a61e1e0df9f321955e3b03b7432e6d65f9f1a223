Btrfs: simplify inline extent handling when doing reflinks

We can not reflink parts of an inline extent, we must always reflink the
whole inline extent. We know that inline extents always start at file
offset 0 and that can never represent an amount of data larger then the
filesystem's sector size (both compressed and uncompressed). We also have
had the constraints that reflink operations must have a start offset that
is aligned to the sector size and an end offset that is also aligned or
it ends the inode's i_size, so there's no way for user space to be able
to do a reflink operation that will refer to only a part of an inline
extent.

Initially there was a bug in the inlining code that could allow compressed
inline extents that encoded more than 1 page, but that was fixed in 2008
by commit 70b99e6959a4c2 ("Btrfs: Compression corner fixes") since that
was problematic.

So remove all the extent cloning code that deals with the possibility
of cloning only partial inline extents.
