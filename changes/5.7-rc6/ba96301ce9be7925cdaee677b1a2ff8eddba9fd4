powerpc: Suppress .eh_frame generation

GCC v8 defaults to enabling -fasynchronous-unwind-tables due to
https://gcc.gnu.org/r259298, which results in .eh_frame section being
generated. This results in additional disk usage by the build, as well
as the kernel modules. Since the kernel has no use for this, this
section is discarded.

Add -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables to KBUILD_CFLAGS to suppress
generation of .eh_frame section. Note that our VDSOs need .eh_frame, but
are not affected by this change since our VDSO code are all in assembly.
