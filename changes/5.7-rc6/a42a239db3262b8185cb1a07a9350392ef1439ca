powerpc/64s/exception: Introduce INT_DEFINE parameter block for code generation

The code generation macro arguments are difficult to read, and
defaults can't easily be used.

This introduces a block where parameters can be set for interrupt
handler code generation by the subsequent macros, and adds the first
generation macro for interrupt entry.

One interrupt handler is converted to the new macros to demonstrate
the change, the rest will be coverted all at once.

No generated code change.
