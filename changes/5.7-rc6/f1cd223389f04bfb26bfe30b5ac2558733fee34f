dt-bindings: rtc: Convert and update jz4740-rtc doc to YAML

Convert the jz4740-rtc doc to YAML, and update it to reflect the new
changes in the driver:
- More compatible strings are specified, with fallbacks if needed,
- The vendor-specific properties are now properly prefixed with the
  'ingenic,' prefix.
