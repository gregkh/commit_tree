block: keep bdi->io_pages in sync with max_sectors_kb for stacked devices

Field bdi->io_pages added in commit 9491ae4aade6 ("mm: don't cap request
size based on read-ahead setting") removes unneeded split of read requests.

Stacked drivers do not call blk_queue_max_hw_sectors(). Instead they set
limits of their devices by blk_set_stacking_limits() + disk_stack_limits().
Field bio->io_pages stays zero until user set max_sectors_kb via sysfs.

This patch updates io_pages after merging limits in disk_stack_limits().

Commit c6d6e9b0f6b4 ("dm: do not allow readahead to limit IO size") fixed
the same problem for device-mapper devices, this one fixes MD RAIDs.
