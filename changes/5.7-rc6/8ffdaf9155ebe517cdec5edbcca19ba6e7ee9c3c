KVM: selftests: Fix build for evmcs.h

I got this error when building kvm selftests:

/usr/bin/ld: /home/xz/git/linux/tools/testing/selftests/kvm/libkvm.a(vmx.o):/home/xz/git/linux/tools/testing/selftests/kvm/include/evmcs.h:222: multiple definition of `current_evmcs'; /tmp/cco1G48P.o:/home/xz/git/linux/tools/testing/selftests/kvm/include/evmcs.h:222: first defined here
/usr/bin/ld: /home/xz/git/linux/tools/testing/selftests/kvm/libkvm.a(vmx.o):/home/xz/git/linux/tools/testing/selftests/kvm/include/evmcs.h:223: multiple definition of `current_vp_assist'; /tmp/cco1G48P.o:/home/xz/git/linux/tools/testing/selftests/kvm/include/evmcs.h:223: first defined here

I think it's because evmcs.h is included both in a test file and a lib file so
the structs have multiple declarations when linking.  After all it's not a good
habit to declare structs in the header files.
