drm/i915: Remove lite restore defines

We have switched from tail manipulation to forced context restore
to implement WaIdleLiteRestore. Remove the old defines and comments.

Note: we still do emit the WA tail, and use it as our first attempt to
avoid forcing a full-restore instead of a lite-restore, we just have a
much stronger backup mechanism for repeated preemptions.
