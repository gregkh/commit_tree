i2c: aspeed: Avoid i2c interrupt status clear race condition.

In AST2600 there have a slow peripheral bus between CPU and i2c
controller. Therefore GIC i2c interrupt status clear have delay timing,
when CPU issue write clear i2c controller interrupt status. To avoid
this issue, the driver need have read after write clear at i2c ISR.
