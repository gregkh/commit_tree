x86/boot: Use unsigned comparison for addresses

The load address is compared with LOAD_PHYSICAL_ADDR using a signed
comparison currently (using jge instruction).

When loading a 64-bit kernel using the new efi32_pe_entry() point added by:

  97aa276579b2 ("efi/x86: Add true mixed mode entry point into .compat section")

using Qemu with -m 3072, the firmware actually loads us above 2Gb,
resulting in a very early crash.

Use the JAE instruction to perform a unsigned comparison instead, as physical
addresses should be considered unsigned.
