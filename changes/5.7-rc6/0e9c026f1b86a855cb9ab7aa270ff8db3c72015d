platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Add slp_s0_offset attribute back to tgl_reg_map

If platforms such as Tiger Lake has sub-states of S0ix, then attributes
such as slps0_dbg_offset become invalid. But slp_s0_offset is still
valid as it is used to get the pmcdev_base_addr.

Hence, add back slp_s0_offset and remove slps0_dbg_offset attributes.
