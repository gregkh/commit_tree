kvm: Handle reads of SandyBridge RAPL PMU MSRs rather than injecting #GP

Linux 3.14 unconditionally reads the RAPL PMU MSRs on boot, without handling
General Protection Faults on reading those MSRs. Rather than injecting a #GP,
which prevents boot, handle the MSRs by returning 0 for their data. Zero was
checked to be safe by code review of the RAPL PMU driver and in discussion
with the original driver author (eranian@google.com).
