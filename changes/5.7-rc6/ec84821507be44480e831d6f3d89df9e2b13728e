include/linux/pagemap.h: rename arguments to find_subpage

This isn't just a random struct page, it's known to be a head page, and
calling it head makes the function better self-documenting.  The pgoff_t
is less confusing if it's named index instead of offset.  Also add a
couple of comments to explain why we're doing various things.
