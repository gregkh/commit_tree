drm/i915/execlist: Mark up racy read of execlists->pending[0]

We write to execlists->pending[0] in process_csb() to acknowledge the
completion of the ESLP update, outside of the main spinlock. When we
check the current status of the previous submission in
__execlists_submission_tasklet() we should therefore use READ_ONCE() to
reflect and document the unsynchronized read.
