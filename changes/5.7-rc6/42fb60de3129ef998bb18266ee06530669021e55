drm/i915/gem: Don't leak non-persistent requests on changing engines

If we have a set of active engines marked as being non-persistent, we
lose track of those if the user replaces those engines with
I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_ENGINES. As part of our uABI contract is that
non-persistent requests are terminated if they are no longer being
tracked by the user's context (in order to prevent a lost request
causing an untracked and so unstoppable GPU hang), we need to apply the
same context cancellation upon changing engines.

v2: Track stale engines[] so we only reap at context closure.
v3: Tvrtko spotted races with closing contexts and set-engines, so add a
veneer of kill-everything paranoia to clean up after losing a race.
