clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: validate arch_timer_rate

Using an arch timer with a frequency of less than 1MHz can potentially
result in incorrect functionality in systems that assume a reasonable
rate of the arch timer of 1 to 50MHz, described as typical in the
architecture specification.

Therefore, warn if the arch timer rate is below 1MHz, which is
considered atypical and worth emphasizing.
