net/mlx5: Fix command entry leak in Internal Error State

Processing commands by cmd_work_handler() while already in Internal
Error State will result in entry leak, since the handler process force
completion without doorbell. Forced completion doesn't release the entry
and event completion will never arrive, so entry should be released.
