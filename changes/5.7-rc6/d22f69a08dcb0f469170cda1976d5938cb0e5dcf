gfs2: Fix use-after-free in gfs2_logd after withdraw

When the gfs2_logd daemon withdrew, the withdraw sequence called
into make_fs_ro() to make the file system read-only. That caused the
journal descriptors to be freed. However, those journal descriptors
were used by gfs2_logd's call to gfs2_ail_flush_reqd(). This caused
a use-after free and NULL pointer dereference.

This patch changes function gfs2_logd() so that it stops all logd
work until the thread is told to stop. Once a withdraw is done,
it only does an interruptible sleep.
