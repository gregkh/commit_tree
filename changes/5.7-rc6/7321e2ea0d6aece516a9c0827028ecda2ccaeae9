ARC: add support for DSP-enabled userspace applications

To be able to run DSP-enabled userspace applications we need to
save and restore following DSP-related registers:
At IRQ/exception entry/exit:
 * DSP_CTRL (save it and reset to value suitable for kernel)
 * ACC0_LO, ACC0_HI (we already save them as r58, r59 pair)
At context switch:
 * ACC0_GLO, ACC0_GHI
 * DSP_BFLY0, DSP_FFT_CTRL
