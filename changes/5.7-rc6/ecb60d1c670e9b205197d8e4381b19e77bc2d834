bpf: Move lnode list node to struct bpf_ksym

Adding lnode list node to 'struct bpf_ksym' object,
so the struct bpf_ksym itself can be chained and used
in other objects like bpf_trampoline and bpf_dispatcher.

Changing iterator to bpf_ksym in bpf_get_kallsym function.

The ksym->start is holding the prog->bpf_func value,
so it's ok to use it as value in bpf_get_kallsym.
