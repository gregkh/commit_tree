irqchip/gic-v4.1: Plumb set_vcpu_affinity SGI callbacks

Just like for vLPIs, there is some configuration information that cannot
be directly communicated through the normal irqchip API, and we have to
use our good old friend set_vcpu_affinity as a side-band communication
mechanism.

This is used to configure group and priority for a given vSGI.
