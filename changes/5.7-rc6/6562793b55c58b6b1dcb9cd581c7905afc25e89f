iio: cros_ec: Expose hwfifo_timeout

Expose EC minimal interrupt period through buffer/hwfifo_timeout:
- Maximal timeout is limited to 65s.
- When timeout for all sensors is set to 0, EC will not send events,
  even if the sensor sampling rate is greater than 0.

Rename frequency to sampling_frequency to match IIO ABI.
