tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: No need to stop tx/rx on UART shutdown

On a board using qcom_geni_serial I found that I could no longer
interact with kdb if I got a crash after the "agetty" running on the
same serial port was killed.  This meant that various classes of
crashes that happened at reboot time were undebuggable.

Reading through the code, I couldn't figure out why qcom_geni_serial
felt the need to run so much code at port shutdown time.  All we need
to do is disable the interrupt.

After I make this change then a hardcoded kgdb_breakpoint in some late
shutdown code now allows me to interact with the debugger.  I also
could freely close / re-open the port without problems.
