USB: hub: Fix handling of connect changes during sleep

Commit 8099f58f1ecd ("USB: hub: Don't record a connect-change event
during reset-resume") wasn't very well conceived.  The problem it
tried to fix was that if a connect-change event occurred while the
system was asleep (such as a device disconnecting itself from the bus
when it is suspended and then reconnecting when it resumes)
requiring a reset-resume during the system wakeup transition, the hub
port's change_bit entry would remain set afterward.  This would cause
the hub driver to believe another connect-change event had occurred
after the reset-resume, which was wrong and would lead the driver to
send unnecessary requests to the device (which could interfere with a
firmware update).

The commit tried to fix this by not setting the change_bit during the
wakeup.  But this was the wrong thing to do; it means that when a
device is unplugged while the system is asleep, the hub driver doesn't
realize anything has happened: The change_bit flag which would tell it
to handle the disconnect event is clear.

The commit needs to be reverted and the problem fixed in a different
way.  Fortunately an alternative solution was noted in the commit's
Changelog: We can continue to set the change_bit entry in
hub_activate() but then clear it when a reset-resume occurs.  That way
the the hub driver will see the change_bit when a device is
disconnected but won't see it when the device is still present.

That's what this patch does.
