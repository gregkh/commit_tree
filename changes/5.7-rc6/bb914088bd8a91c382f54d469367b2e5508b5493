watchdog: orion: use 0 for unset heartbeat

If the heartbeat module param is not specified we would get an error
message

  watchdog: f1020300.watchdog: driver supplied timeout (4294967295) out of range
  watchdog: f1020300.watchdog: falling back to default timeout (171)

This is because we were initialising heartbeat to -1. By removing the
initialisation (thus letting the C run time initialise it to 0) we
silence the warning message and the default timeout is still used.
