firmware_loader: revert removal of the fw_fallback_config export

Christoph's patch removed two unsused exported symbols, however, one
symbol is used by the firmware_loader itself.  If CONFIG_FW_LOADER=m so
the firmware_loader is modular but CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=y we fail
the build at mostpost.

ERROR: modpost: "fw_fallback_config" [drivers/base/firmware_loader/firmware_class.ko] undefined!

This happens because the variable fw_fallback_config is built into the
kernel if CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=y always, so we need to grant
access to the firmware loader module by exporting it.

Revert only one hunk from his patch.
