KVM: selftests: Add test for KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION

Add a KVM selftest to test moving the base gfn of a userspace memory
region.  Although the basic concept of moving memory regions is not x86
specific, the assumptions regarding large pages and MMIO shenanigans
used to verify the correctness make this x86_64 only for the time being.
