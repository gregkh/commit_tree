MAINTAINERS: list the section entries in the preferred order

The MAINTAINERS file header has never shown a preferred order for the
section entries but scripts/parse-maintainers.pl added a preferred order
with commit 61f741645a35 ("parse-maintainers: Add section pattern
sorting")

Commit 5cdbec108fd2 ("parse-maintainers: Do not sort section content by
default") changed the preferred order to be a bit more sensible.

Update the MAINTAINERS section description block to use this preferred
section entry ordering.

Add a slightly better description for the N: entry too.
