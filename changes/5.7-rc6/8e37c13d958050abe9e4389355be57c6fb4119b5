staging: mt7621-pci: don't return if get gpio fails

In some platforms gpio's are not used for reset but
for other purposes. Because of that when we try to
get them are valid gpio's but are already assigned
to do other function. To avoid those kind of problems
in those platforms just notice the fail in the kernel
but continue doing normal boot.
