xhci: Do not open code __print_symbolic() in xhci trace events

libtraceevent (used by perf and trace-cmd) failed to parse the
xhci_urb_dequeue trace event. This is because the user space trace
event format parsing is not a full C compiler. It can handle some basic
logic, but is not meant to be able to handle everything C can do.

In cases where a trace event field needs to be converted from a number
to a string, there's the __print_symbolic() macro that should be used:

 See samples/trace_events/trace-events-sample.h

Some xhci trace events open coded the __print_symbolic() causing the
user spaces tools to fail to parse it. This has to be replaced with
__print_symbolic() instead.
