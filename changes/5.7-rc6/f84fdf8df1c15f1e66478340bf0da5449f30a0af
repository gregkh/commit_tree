kbuild: remove the owner check in mkcompile_h

This reverts a very old commit, which dates back to the pre-git era:

|    kbuild: Fix compiling/installing as different users
|
|    "make bzImage && sudo make install" had the problem that during
|    the "sudo make install" the build system would notice that the information
|    in include/linux/compile.h is not accurate (it says "compiled by <user>",
|    but we are root), thus causing compile.h to be updated and leading to
|    some recompiles.
|
|    We now only update "compile.h" if the current user is the owner of
|    include/linux/autoconf.h, i.e. the user who did the "make *config". So the
|    above sequence will correctly state "compiled by <user>".

The 'make bzImage && sudo make install' problem no longer happens
because commit 1648e4f80506 ("x86, kbuild: make "make install" not
depend on vmlinux") fixed the root cause.

Commit 19514fc665ff ("arm, kbuild: make "make install" not depend on
vmlinux") fixed the similar issue on ARM, with detailed explanation.

So, the rule is that the installation targets should never trigger
the builds of any build artifact. By following it, this check is
unneeded.
