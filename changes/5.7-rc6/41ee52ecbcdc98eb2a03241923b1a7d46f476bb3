KVM: arm: vgic: Only use the virtual state when userspace accesses enable bits

There is no point in accessing the HW when writing to any of the
ISENABLER/ICENABLER registers from userspace, as only the guest
should be allowed to change the HW state.

Introduce new userspace-specific accessors that deal solely with
the virtual state.
