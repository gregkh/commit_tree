s390/topology: remove offline CPUs from CPU topology masks

The CPU topology masks on s390 contain also bits of CPUs which
are offline. Currently this is already a problem, since common
code scheduler expects e.g. cpu_smt_mask() to reflect reality.

This update changes the described behaviour and s390 starts to
behave like all other architectures.
