mptcp: consolidate synack processing.

Currently the MPTCP code uses 2 hooks to process syn-ack
packets, mptcp_rcv_synsent() and the sk_rx_dst_set()
callback.

We can drop the first, moving the relevant code into the
latter, reducing the hooking into the TCP code. This is
also needed by the next patch.

v1 -> v2:
 - use local tcp sock ptr instead of casting the sk variable
   several times - DaveM
