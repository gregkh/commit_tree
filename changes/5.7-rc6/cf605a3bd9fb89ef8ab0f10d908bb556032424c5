mt76: mt7615: rely on mt76_queues_read for mt7622

As previous devices, mt7622 relies on multiple hw queues while for
mt7615 we have just on per band hw queue and the mcu demux the traffic
according to the packet AC. In order to dump all configured hw queues,
rely on mt76_queues_read for mt7622 in mt7615 debugfs
