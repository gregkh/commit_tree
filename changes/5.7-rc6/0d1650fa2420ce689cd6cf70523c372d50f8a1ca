drm/mm: Remove redundant assignment in drm_mm_reserve_node

In Pete Goodliffe words, "You can improve a system by adding new code. You
can also improve a system by removing code" - In this case, commit
"202b52b7fbf70" added new code to initialize end of the node. So, there
is no need for duplicated initialization, and this patch simply removes it.
