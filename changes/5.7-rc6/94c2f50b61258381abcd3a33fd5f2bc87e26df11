selftests/bpf: Fix race in tcp_rtt test

Previous attempt to make tcp_rtt more robust introduced a new race, in which
server_done might be set to true before server can actually accept any
connection. Fix this by unconditionally waiting for accept(). Given socket is
non-blocking, if there are any problems with client side, it should eventually
close listening FD and let server thread exit with failure.
