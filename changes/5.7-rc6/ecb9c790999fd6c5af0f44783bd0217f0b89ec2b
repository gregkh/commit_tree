acpi/x86: ignore unspecified bit positions in the ACPI global lock field

The value in "new" is constructed from "old" such that all bits defined
as reserved by the ACPI spec[1] are left untouched. But if those bits
do not happen to be all zero, "new < 3" will not evaluate to true.

The firmware of the laptop(s) Medion MD63490 / Akoya P15648 comes with
garbage inside the "FACS" ACPI table. The starting value is
old=0x4944454d, therefore new=0x4944454e, which is >= 3. Mask off
the reserved bits.
