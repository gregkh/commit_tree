fanotify: Store fanotify handles differently

Currently, struct fanotify_fid groups fsid and file handle and is
unioned together with struct path to save space. Also there is fh_type
and fh_len directly in struct fanotify_event to avoid padding overhead.
In the follwing patches, we will be adding more event types and this
packing makes code difficult to follow. So unpack everything and create
struct fanotify_fh which groups members logically related to file handle
to make code easier to follow. In the following patch we will pack
things again differently to make events smaller.
