cpufreq: qcom: Add support for krait based socs

In Certain QCOM SoCs like ipq8064, apq8064, msm8960, msm8974
that has KRAIT processors the voltage/current value of each OPP
varies based on the silicon variant in use.

The required OPP related data is determined based on
the efuse value. This is similar to the existing code for
kryo cores. So adding support for krait cores here.
