KVM: nVMX: Replace a BUG_ON(1) with BUG() to squash clang warning

Use BUG() in the impossible-to-hit default case when switching on the
scope of INVEPT to squash a warning with clang 11 due to clang treating
the BUG_ON() as conditional.

  >> arch/x86/kvm/vmx/nested.c:5246:3: warning: variable 'roots_to_free'
     is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
     [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
                   BUG_ON(1);
