powerpc/64s: Fix doorbell wakeup msgclr optimisation

Commit 3282a3da25bd ("powerpc/64: Implement soft interrupt replay in C")
broke the doorbell wakeup optimisation introduced by commit a9af97aa0a12
("powerpc/64s: msgclr when handling doorbell exceptions from system
reset").

This patch restores the msgclr, in C code. It's now done in the system
reset wakeup path rather than doorbell interrupt replay where it used
to be, because it is always the right thing to do in the wakeup case,
but it may be rarely of use in other interrupt replay situations in
which case it's wasted work - we would have to run measurements to see
if that was a worthwhile optimisation, and I suspect it would not be.

The results are similar to those in the original commit, test on POWER8
of context_switch selftests benchmark with polling idle disabled (e.g.,
always nap, giving cross-CPU IPIs) gives the following results:

                                  broken           patched
