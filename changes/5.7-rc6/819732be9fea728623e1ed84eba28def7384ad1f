scsi: zfcp: fix missing erp_lock in port recovery trigger for point-to-point

v2.6.27 commit cc8c282963bd ("[SCSI] zfcp: Automatically attach remote
ports") introduced zfcp automatic port scan.

Before that, the user had to use the sysfs attribute "port_add" of an FCP
device (adapter) to add and open remote (target) ports, even for the remote
peer port in point-to-point topology. That code path did a proper port open
recovery trigger taking the erp_lock.

Since above commit, a new helper function zfcp_erp_open_ptp_port()
performed an UNlocked port open recovery trigger. This can race with other
parallel recovery triggers. In zfcp_erp_action_enqueue() this could corrupt
e.g. adapter->erp_total_count or adapter->erp_ready_head.

As already found for fabric topology in v4.17 commit fa89adba1941 ("scsi:
zfcp: fix infinite iteration on ERP ready list"), there was an endless loop
during tracing of rport (un)block.  A subsequent v4.18 commit 9e156c54ace3
("scsi: zfcp: assert that the ERP lock is held when tracing a recovery
trigger") introduced a lockdep assertion for that case.

As a side effect, that lockdep assertion now uncovered the unlocked code
path for PtP. It is from within an adapter ERP action:

zfcp_erp_strategy[1479]  intentionally DROPs erp lock around
                         zfcp_erp_strategy_do_action()
zfcp_erp_strategy_do_action[1441]      NO erp lock
zfcp_erp_adapter_strategy[876]         NO erp lock
zfcp_erp_adapter_strategy_open[855]    NO erp lock
zfcp_erp_adapter_strategy_open_fsf[806]NO erp lock
zfcp_erp_adapter_strat_fsf_xconf[772]  erp lock only around
                                       zfcp_erp_action_to_running(),
                                       BUT *_not_* around
                                       zfcp_erp_enqueue_ptp_port()
zfcp_erp_enqueue_ptp_port[728]         BUG: *_not_* taking erp lock
_zfcp_erp_port_reopen[432]             assumes to be called with erp lock
zfcp_erp_action_enqueue[314]           assumes to be called with erp lock
zfcp_dbf_rec_trig[288]                 _checks_ to be called with erp lock:
	lockdep_assert_held(&adapter->erp_lock);

It causes the following lockdep warning:

WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 775 at drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_dbf.c:288
                            zfcp_dbf_rec_trig+0x16a/0x188
no locks held by zfcperp0.0.17c0/775.

Fix this by using the proper locked recovery trigger helper function.
