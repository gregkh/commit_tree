net/mlx5e: Rename hw_modify to preactivate

mlx5e_safe_switch_channels accepts a callback to be called before
activating new channels. It is intended to configure some hardware
parameters in cases where channels are recreated because some
configuration has changed.

Recently, this callback has started being used to update the driver's
internal MLX5E_STATE_XDP_OPEN flag, and the following patches also
intend to use this callback for software preparations. This patch
renames the hw_modify callback to preactivate, so that the name fits
better.
