MAINTAINERS: clarify maintenance of nvdimm testing tool

The git history shows that the files under ./tools/testing/nvdimm are
being developed and maintained by the LIBNVDIMM maintainers.

This was identified with a small script that finds all files only
belonging to "THE REST" according to the current MAINTAINERS file, and I
acted upon its output.
