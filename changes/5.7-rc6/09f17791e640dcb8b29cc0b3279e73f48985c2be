scsi: ufs: Add dev ref clock gating wait time support

In UFS version 3.0, a newly added attribute bRefClkGatingWaitTime defines
the minimum time for which the reference clock is required by device during
transition to LS-MODE or HIBERN8 state. Make this change to reflect the new
requirement by adding delays before turning off the clock.
