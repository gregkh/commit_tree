KVM: x86: Refactor kvm_cpuid() param that controls out-of-range logic

Invert and rename the kvm_cpuid() param that controls out-of-range logic
to better reflect the semantics of the affected callers, i.e. callers
that bypass the out-of-range logic do so because they are looking up an
exact guest CPUID entry, e.g. to query the maxphyaddr.

Similarly, rename kvm_cpuid()'s internal "found" to "exact" to clarify
that it tracks whether or not the exact requested leaf was found, as
opposed to any usable leaf being found.

No functional change intended.
