proc: io_accounting: Use new infrastructure to fix deadlocks in execve

This changes do_io_accounting to use the new exec_update_mutex
instead of cred_guard_mutex.

This fixes possible deadlocks when the trace is accessing
/proc/$pid/io for instance.

This should be safe, as the credentials are only used for reading.
