proc: Use new infrastructure to fix deadlocks in execve

This changes lock_trace to use the new exec_update_mutex
instead of cred_guard_mutex.

This fixes possible deadlocks when the trace is accessing
/proc/$pid/stack for instance.

This should be safe, as the credentials are only used for reading,
and task->mm is updated on execve under the new exec_update_mutex.
