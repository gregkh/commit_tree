block/diskstats: replace time_in_queue with sum of request times

Column "time_in_queue" in diskstats is supposed to show total waiting time
of all requests. I.e. value should be equal to the sum of times from other
columns. But this is not true, because column "time_in_queue" is counted
separately in jiffies rather than in nanoseconds as other times.

This patch removes redundant counter for "time_in_queue" and shows total
time of read, write, discard and flush requests.
