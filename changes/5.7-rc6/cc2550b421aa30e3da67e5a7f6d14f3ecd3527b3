clocksource: Replace setup_irq() by request_irq()

request_irq() is preferred over setup_irq(). The early boot setup_irq()
invocations happen either via 'init_IRQ()' or 'time_init()', while
memory allocators are ready by 'mm_init()'.

Per tglx[1], setup_irq() existed in olden days when allocators were not
ready by the time early interrupts were initialized.

Hence replace setup_irq() by request_irq().

Seldom remove_irq() usage has been observed coupled with setup_irq(),
wherever that has been found, it too has been replaced by free_irq().

A build error that was reported by kbuild test robot <lkp@intel.com>
in the previous version of the patch also has been fixed.
