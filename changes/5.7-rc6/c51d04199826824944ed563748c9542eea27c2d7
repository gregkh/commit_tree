null_blk: add tracepoint helpers for zoned mode

This patch adds two new tracpoints for null_blk_zoned.c that allows us
to trace report-zones, zone-mgmt-op and zone-write operations which has
direct effect on the zone condition state machine.

Also, we update drivers/block/Makefile so that new null_blk related
tracefiles can be compiled.
