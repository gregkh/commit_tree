drm/amdgpu: Fix check for DPM when returning max clock

pp_funcs may not exist, while dpm may be enabled. This change ensures
that KFD topology will report the same as pp_dpm_sclk, as the conditions
for reporting them will be the same.

Otherwise, we may see the issue where KFD reports "100MHz" in topology
as the max speed, while DPM is working correctly.
