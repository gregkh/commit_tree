posix-timers: Pass lockdep expression to RCU lists

head is traversed using hlist_for_each_entry_rcu outside an RCU read-side
critical section but under the protection of hash_lock.

Hence, add corresponding lockdep expression to silence false-positive
lockdep warnings, and harden RCU lists.

[ tglx: Removed the macro and put the condition right where it's used ]
