tracing: Have hwlat ts be first instance and record count of instances

The hwlat tracer runs a loop of width time during a given window. It then
reports the max latency over a given threshold and records a timestamp. But
this timestamp is the time after the width has finished, and not the time it
actually triggered.

Record the actual time when the latency was greater than the threshold as
well as the number of times it was greater in a given width per window.
