ALSA: hda/realtek - Set principled PC Beep configuration for ALC256

The Realtek PC Beep Hidden Register[1] is currently set by
patch_realtek.c in two different places:

In alc_fill_eapd_coef(), it's set to the value 0x5757, corresponding to
non-beep input on 1Ah and no 1Ah loopback to either headphones or
speakers. (Although, curiously, the loopback amp is still enabled.) This
write was added fairly recently by commit e3743f431143 ("ALSA:
hda/realtek - Dell headphone has noise on unmute for ALC236") and is a
safe default. However, it happens in the wrong place:
alc_fill_eapd_coef() runs on module load and cold boot but not on S3
resume, meaning the register loses its value after suspend.

Conversely, in alc256_init(), the register is updated to unset bit 13
(disable speaker loopback) and set bit 5 (set non-beep input on 1Ah).
Although this write does run on S3 resume, it's not quite enough to fix
up the register's default value of 0x3717. What's missing is a set of
bit 14 to disable headphone loopback. Without that, we end up with a
feedback loop where the headphone jack is being driven by amplified
samples of itself[2].

This change eliminates the update in alc256_init() and replaces it with
the 0x5757 write from alc_fill_eapd_coef(). Kailang says that 0x5757 is
supposed to be the codec's default value, so using it will make
debugging easier for Realtek.

Affects the ALC255, ALC256, ALC257, ALC235, and ALC236 codecs.

[2] Setting the "Headphone Mic Boost" control from userspace changes
this feedback loop and has been a widely-shared workaround for headphone
noise on laptops like the Dell XPS 13 9350. This commit eliminates the
feedback loop and makes the workaround unnecessary.
