soc: qcom: aoss: Use wake_up_all() instead of wake_up_interruptible_all()

During the probe the task is waiting in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state which
cannot be woken-up by wake_up_interruptible_all() function.

Use wake_up_all() to wake-up both TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state tasks.
