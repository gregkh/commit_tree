mm/page_alloc: fix watchdog soft lockups during set_zone_contiguous()

Without CONFIG_PREEMPT, it can happen that we get soft lockups detected,
e.g., while booting up.

  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [swapper/0:1]
  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 5.6.0-next-20200331+ #4
  Hardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS 1.11.1-4.module+el8.1.0+4066+0f1aadab 04/01/2014
  RIP: __pageblock_pfn_to_page+0x134/0x1c0
  Call Trace:
   set_zone_contiguous+0x56/0x70

   ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40

The issue becomes visible when having a lot of memory (e.g., 4TB)
assigned to a single NUMA node - a system that can easily be created
using QEMU.  Inside VMs on a hypervisor with quite some memory
overcommit, this is fairly easy to trigger.
