mmc: core: Fix recursive locking issue in CQE recovery path

Consider the following stack trace

-001|raw_spin_lock_irqsave
-002|mmc_blk_cqe_complete_rq
-003|__blk_mq_complete_request(inline)
-003|blk_mq_complete_request(rq)
-004|mmc_cqe_timed_out(inline)
-004|mmc_mq_timed_out

mmc_mq_timed_out acquires the queue_lock for the first
time. The mmc_blk_cqe_complete_rq function also tries to acquire
the same queue lock resulting in recursive locking where the task
is spinning for the same lock which it has already acquired leading
to watchdog bark.

Fix this issue with the lock only for the required critical section.
