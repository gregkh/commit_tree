net: stmmac: dwmac1000: fix out-of-bounds mac address reg setting

Commit 9463c4455900 ("net: stmmac: dwmac1000: Clear unused address
entries") cleared the unused mac address entries, but introduced an
out-of bounds mac address register programming bug -- After setting
the secondary unicast mac addresses, the "reg" value has reached
netdev_uc_count() + 1, thus we should only clear address entries
if (addr < perfect_addr_number)
