lib/stackdepot.c: build with -fno-builtin

Clang may replace stackdepot_memcmp() with a call to instrumented bcmp(),
which is exactly what we wanted to avoid creating stackdepot_memcmp().
Building the file with -fno-builtin prevents such optimizations.

This patch has been previously mailed as part of KMSAN RFC patch series.
