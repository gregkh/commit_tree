rcu: Add WRITE_ONCE() to rcu_node ->qsmaskinitnext

The rcu_state structure's ->qsmaskinitnext field is read locklessly,
so this commit adds the WRITE_ONCE() to an update in order to provide
proper documentation and READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() pairing.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely for systems not doing incessant CPU-hotplug
operations.
