powerpc/64s: Fix section mismatch warnings from boot code

We currently have two section mismatch warnings:

  The function __boot_from_prom() references
  the function __init prom_init().

  The function start_here_common() references
  the function __init start_kernel().

The warnings are correct, we do have branches from non-init code into
init code, which is freed after boot. But we don't expect to ever
execute any of that early boot code after boot, if we did that would
be a bug. In particular calling into OF after boot would be fatal
because OF is no longer resident.

So for now fix the warnings by marking the relevant functions as
__REF, which puts them in the ".ref.text" section.

This causes some reordering of the functions in the final link:

In particular __boot_from_prom moves after copy_to_here, which means
it's not copied to zero in the first stage of copy of the kernel to
zero.

But that's OK, because we only call __boot_from_prom before we do the
copy, so it makes no difference when it's copied. The call sequence
is:
  __start
  -> __start_initialization_multiplatform
     -> __boot_from_prom
        -> __start
           -> __start_initialization_multiplatform
              -> __after_prom_start
                 -> copy_and_flush
                 -> copy_and_flush (relocated to 0)
                    -> start_here_multiplatform
                       -> early_setup
