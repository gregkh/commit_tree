mm/memremap_pages: Introduce memremap_compat_align()

The "sub-section memory hotplug" facility allows memremap_pages() users
like libnvdimm to compensate for hardware platforms like x86 that have a
section size larger than their hardware memory mapping granularity.  The
compensation that sub-section support affords is being tolerant of
physical memory resources shifting by units smaller (64MiB on x86) than
the memory-hotplug section size (128 MiB). Where the platform
physical-memory mapping granularity is limited by the number and
capability of address-decode-registers in the memory controller.

While the sub-section support allows memremap_pages() to operate on
sub-section (2MiB) granularity, the Power architecture may still
require 16MiB alignment on "!radix_enabled()" platforms.

In order for libnvdimm to be able to detect and manage this per-arch
limitation, introduce memremap_compat_align() as a common minimum
alignment across all driver-facing memory-mapping interfaces, and let
Power override it to 16MiB in the "!radix_enabled()" case.

The assumption / requirement for 16MiB to be a viable
memremap_compat_align() value is that Power does not have platforms
where its equivalent of address-decode-registers never hardware remaps a
persistent memory resource on smaller than 16MiB boundaries. Note that I
tried my best to not add a new Kconfig symbol, but header include
entanglements defeated the #ifndef memremap_compat_align design pattern
and the need to export it defeats the __weak design pattern for arch
overrides.

Based on an initial patch by Aneesh.
