sfc: support configuring vf spoofchk on EF10 VFs

Corresponds to the MAC_SPOOFING_TX privilege in the hardware.
Some firmware versions on some cards don't support the feature, so check
 the TX_MAC_SECURITY capability and fail EOPNOTSUPP if trying to enable
 spoofchk on a NIC that doesn't support it.
