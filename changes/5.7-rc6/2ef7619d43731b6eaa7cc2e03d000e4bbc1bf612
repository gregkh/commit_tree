KVM: VMX: Add helpers to query Intel PT mode

Add helpers to query which of the (two) supported PT modes is active.
The primary motivation is to help document that there is a third PT mode
(host-only) that's currently not supported by KVM.  As is, it's not
obvious that PT_MODE_SYSTEM != !PT_MODE_HOST_GUEST and vice versa, e.g.
that "pt_mode == PT_MODE_SYSTEM" and "pt_mode != PT_MODE_HOST_GUEST" are
two distinct checks.

No functional change intended.
