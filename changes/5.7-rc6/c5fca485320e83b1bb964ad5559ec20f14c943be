Input: goodix - add support for controlling the IRQ pin through ACPI methods

Some Apollo Lake (x86, UEFI + ACPI) devices only list the reset GPIO
in their _CRS table and the bit-banging of the IRQ line necessary to
wake-up the controller from suspend can be done by calling 2 Goodix
custom / specific ACPI methods.

This commit adds support for controlling the IRQ line in this matter,
allowing us to properly suspend the touchscreen controller on such
devices.
