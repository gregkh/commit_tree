nfsd: set the server_scope during service startup

Currently, nfsd4_encode_exchange_id() encodes the utsname nodename
string in the server_scope field.  In a multi-host container
environemnt, if an nfsd container is restarted on a different host than
it was originally running on, clients will see a server_scope mismatch
and will not attempt to reclaim opens.

Instead, set the server_scope while we're in a process context during
service startup, so we get the utsname nodename of the current process
and store that in nfsd_net.
