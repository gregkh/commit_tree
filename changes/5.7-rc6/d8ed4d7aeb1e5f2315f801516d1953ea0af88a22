tools headers: Update x86's syscall_64.tbl with the kernel sources

To pick the changes from:

  d3b1b776eefc ("x86/entry/64: Remove ptregs qualifier from syscall table")
  cab56d3484d4 ("x86/entry: Remove ABI prefixes from functions in syscall tables")
  27dd84fafcd5 ("x86/entry/64: Use syscall wrappers for x32_rt_sigreturn")

Addressing this tools/perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl'
  diff -u tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl

That didn't result in any tooling changes, as what is extracted are just
the first two columns, and these patches touched only the third.
