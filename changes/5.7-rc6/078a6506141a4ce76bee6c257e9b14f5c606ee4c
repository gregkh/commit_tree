dmaengine: at_hdmac: Fix deadlocks

Fix the following deadlocks:
1/ atc_handle_cyclic() and atc_chain_complete() called
dmaengine_desc_get_callback_invoke() while wrongly holding the
atchan->lock. Clients can set the callback to dmaengine_terminate_sync()
which will end up trying to get the same lock, thus a deadlock occurred.
2/ dma_run_dependencies() was called with the atchan->lock held, but the
method calls device_issue_pending() which tries to get the same lock,
and so a deadlock occurred.

The driver must not hold the lock when invoking the callback or when
running dependencies. Releasing the spinlock within a called function
before calling the callback is not a nice thing to do -> called functions
become non-atomic when called within an atomic region. Thus the lock is
now taken in the child routines whereever is needed.
