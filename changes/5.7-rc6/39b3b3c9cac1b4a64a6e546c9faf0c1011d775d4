iommu/virtio: Reject IOMMU page granule larger than PAGE_SIZE

We don't currently support IOMMUs with a page granule larger than the
system page size. The IOVA allocator has a BUG_ON() in this case, and
VFIO has a WARN_ON().

Removing these obstacles ranges doesn't seem possible without major
changes to the DMA API and VFIO. Some callers of iommu_map(), for
example, want to map multiple page-aligned regions adjacent to each
others for scatter-gather purposes. Even in simple DMA API uses, a call
to dma_map_page() would let the endpoint access neighbouring memory. And
VFIO users cannot ensure that their virtual address buffer is physically
contiguous at the IOMMU granule.

Rather than triggering the IOVA BUG_ON() on mismatched page sizes, abort
the vdomain finalise() with an error message. We could simply abort the
viommu probe(), but an upcoming extension to virtio-iommu will allow
setting different page masks for each endpoint.
