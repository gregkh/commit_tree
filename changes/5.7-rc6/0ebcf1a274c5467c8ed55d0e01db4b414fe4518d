dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Implement support for atype (for virtualization)

The DT for virtualized hosts have dma-cells == 2 where the second parameter
is the ATYPE for the channel.

In case of dma-cells == 1 we can configure the ATYPE as 0 (reset value).

The ATYPE defined for j721e are:
0: pointers are physical addresses (no translation)
1: pointers are intermediate addresses (PVU)
2: pointers are virtual addresses (SMMU)
