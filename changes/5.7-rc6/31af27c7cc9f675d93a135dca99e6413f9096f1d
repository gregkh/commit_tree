io_uring: don't count rqs failed after current one

When checking for draining with __req_need_defer(), it tries to match
how many requests were sent before a current one with number of already
completed. Dropped SQEs are included in req->sequence, and they won't
ever appear in CQ. To compensate for that, __req_need_defer() substracts
ctx->cached_sq_dropped.
However, what it should really use is number of SQEs dropped __before__
the current one. In other words, any submitted request shouldn't
shouldn't affect dequeueing from the drain queue of previously submitted
ones.

Instead of saving proper ctx->cached_sq_dropped in each request,
substract from req->sequence it at initialisation, so it includes number
of properly submitted requests.

note: it also changes behaviour of timeouts, but
1. it's already diverge from the description because of using SQ
2. the description is ambiguous regarding dropped SQEs
