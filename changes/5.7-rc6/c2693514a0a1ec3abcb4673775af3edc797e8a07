pwm: jz4740: Obtain regmap from parent node

The TCU registers are shared between a handful of drivers, accessing
them through the same regmap.

While this driver is devicetree-compatible, it is never (as of now)
probed from devicetree, so this change does not introduce a ABI problem
with current devicetree files.
