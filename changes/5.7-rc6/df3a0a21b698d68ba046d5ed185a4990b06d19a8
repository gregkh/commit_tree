mm/gup: fix omission of check on FOLL_LONGTERM in gup fast path

FOLL_LONGTERM is a special case of FOLL_PIN.  It suggests a pin which is
going to be given to hardware and can't move.  It would truncate CMA
permanently and should be excluded.

In gup slow path, where
__gup_longterm_locked->check_and_migrate_cma_pages() handles
FOLL_LONGTERM, but in fast path, there lacks such a check, which means a
possible leak of CMA page to longterm pinned.

Place a check in try_grab_compound_head() in the fast path to fix the
leak, and if FOLL_LONGTERM happens on CMA, it will fall back to slow path
to migrate the page.

Some note about the check: Huge page's subpages have the same migrate type
due to either allocation from a free_list[] or alloc_contig_range() with
param MIGRATE_MOVABLE.  So it is enough to check on a single subpage by
is_migrate_cma_page(subpage)
