locking/lockdep: Track number of zapped classes

The whole point of the lockdep dynamic key patch is to allow unused
locks to be removed from the lockdep data buffers so that existing
buffer space can be reused. However, there is no way to find out how
many unused locks are zapped and so we don't know if the zapping process
is working properly.

Add a new nr_zapped_classes counter to track that and show it in
/proc/lockdep_stats.
