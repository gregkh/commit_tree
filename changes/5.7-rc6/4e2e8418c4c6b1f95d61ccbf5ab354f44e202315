arm64: dts: rockchip: fix compatible property for Radxa ROCK Pi N10

A test with the command below gives this error:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399pro-rock-pi-n10.dt.yaml: /: compatible:
['radxa,rockpi-n10', 'rockchip,rk3399pro']
is not valid under any of the given schemas

During the review process the binding was changed,
but the dts file was somehow not updated.
Fix this error by adding 'vamrs,rk3399pro-vmarc-som' to
the compatible property.

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
