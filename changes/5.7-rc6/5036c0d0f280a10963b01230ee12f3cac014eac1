drm/edid: Add a FIXME about DispID CEA data block revision

I don't understand what the DispID CEA data block revision
means. The spec doesn't say. I guess some DispID must have
a value of >= 3 in there or else we generally wouldn't
even parse the CEA data blocks. Or does all this code
actually not do anything?
