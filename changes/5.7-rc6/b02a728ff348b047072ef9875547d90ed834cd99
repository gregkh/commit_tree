dt-bindings: iio: Fix adi, ltc2983 uint64-matrix schema constraints

'minItems' and 'maxItems' apply at the same level as 'items' schemas as
the keywords apply to arrays. What's currently defined is a 3
dimensional matrix with the outer size being undefined. To fix this,
minItems/maxItems needs to be moved up a level.

With this fixed, the example fails validation. For matrix types, the dts
syntax must use brackets (<>) matching the schema definition. In this
case, the inner array size is 2 elements, so let's add the correct
bracketing.
