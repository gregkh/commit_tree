mm/migrate.c: no need to check for i > start in do_pages_move()

Patch series "cleanup on do_pages_move()", v5.

The logic in do_pages_move() is a little mess for audience to read and has
some potential error on handling the return value. Especially there are
three calls on do_move_pages_to_node() and store_status() with almost the
same form.

This patch set tries to make the code a little friendly for audience by
consolidate the calls.

This patch (of 4):

At this point, we always have i >= start.  If i == start, store_status()
will return 0.  So we can drop the check for i > start.
