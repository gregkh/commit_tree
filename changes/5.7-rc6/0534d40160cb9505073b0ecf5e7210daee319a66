usb: gadget: tegra-xudc: Fix idle suspend/resume

When the XUDC device is idle (i.e. powergated), care must be taken not
to access any registers because that would lead to a crash.

Move the call to tegra_xudc_device_mode_off() into the same conditional
as the tegra_xudc_powergate() call to make sure we only force device
mode off if the XUDC is actually powered up.
