xprtrdma: Extract sockaddr from struct rdma_cm_id

rpcrdma_cm_event_handler() is always passed an @id pointer that is
valid. However, in a subsequent patch, we won't be able to extract
an r_xprt in every case. So instead of using the r_xprt's
presentation address strings, extract them from struct rdma_cm_id.
