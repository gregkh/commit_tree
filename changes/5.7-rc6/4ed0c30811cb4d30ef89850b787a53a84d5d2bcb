gfs2: move privileged user check to gfs2_quota_lock_check

Before this patch, function gfs2_quota_lock checked if it was called
from a privileged user, and if so, it bypassed the quota check:
superuser can operate outside the quotas.
That's the wrong place for the check because the lock/unlock functions
are separate from the lock_check function, and you can do lock and
unlock without actually checking the quotas.

This patch moves the check to gfs2_quota_lock_check.
