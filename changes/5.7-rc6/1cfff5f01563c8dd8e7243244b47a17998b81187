drm/dp_mst: Convert drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr.is_waiting_for_dwn_reply to bitfield

Small nitpick that I noticed a second ago - we can save some space in
the struct by making this a bitfield and sticking it with the rest of
the bitfields. Also, some small cleanup to the kdocs for this member.

There should be no functional changes in this patch.
