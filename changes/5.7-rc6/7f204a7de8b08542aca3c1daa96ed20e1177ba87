selftests: net: Add SO_REUSEADDR test to check if 4-tuples are fully utilized.

This commit adds a test to check if we can fully utilize 4-tuples for
connect() when all ephemeral ports are exhausted.

The test program changes the local port range to use only one port and binds
two sockets with or without SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT, and with the same
EUID or with different EUIDs, then do listen().

We should be able to bind only one socket having both SO_REUSEADDR and
SO_REUSEPORT per EUID, which restriction is to prevent unintentional
listen().
