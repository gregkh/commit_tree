block, bfq: move forward the getting of an extra ref in bfq_bfqq_move

Commit ecedd3d7e199 ("block, bfq: get extra ref to prevent a queue
from being freed during a group move") gets an extra reference to a
bfq_queue before possibly deactivating it (temporarily), in
bfq_bfqq_move(). This prevents the bfq_queue from disappearing before
being reactivated in its new group.

Yet, the bfq_queue may also be expired (i.e., its service may be
stopped) before the bfq_queue is deactivated. And also an expiration
may lead to a premature freeing. This commit fixes this issue by
simply moving forward the getting of the extra reference already
introduced by commit ecedd3d7e199 ("block, bfq: get extra ref to
prevent a queue from being freed during a group move").
