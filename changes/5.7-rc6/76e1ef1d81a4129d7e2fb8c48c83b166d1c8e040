The problem described in v5.6 commit 1208f9e1d758c9 ("USB: hub: Fix the
broken detection of USB3 device in SMSC hub") applies solely to the
USB5534B hub [2] present on the Kingfisher Infotainment Carrier Board,
manufactured by Shimafuji Electric Inc [3].

Despite that, the aforementioned commit applied the quirk to _all_ hubs
carrying vendor ID 0x424 (i.e. SMSC), of which there are more [4] than
initially expected. Consequently, the quirk is now enabled on platforms
carrying SMSC/Microchip hub models which potentially don't exhibit the
original issue.

To avoid reports like [1], further limit the quirk's scope to
USB5534B [2], by employing both Vendor and Product ID checks.

Tested on H3ULCB + Kingfisher rev. M05.
