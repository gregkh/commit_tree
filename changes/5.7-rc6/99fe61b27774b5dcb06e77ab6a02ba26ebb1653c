e1000e: fix missing cpu_to_le64 on buffer_addr

The following warning suggests there is a missing cpu_to_le64() in
the e1000_flush_tx_ring() function (it is also the behaviour
elsewhere in the driver to do cpu_to_le64() on the buffer_addr
when setting it)

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/netdev.c:3813:30: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/netdev.c:3813:30:    expected restricted __le64 [usertype] buffer_addr
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/netdev.c:3813:30:    got unsigned long long [usertype] dma
