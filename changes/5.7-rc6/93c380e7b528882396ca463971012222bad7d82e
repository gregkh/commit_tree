KVM: x86: Set emulated/transmuted feature bits via kvm_cpu_caps

Set emulated and transmuted (set based on other features) feature bits
via kvm_cpu_caps now that the CPUID output for KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID
is direcly overidden with kvm_cpu_caps.

Note, VMX emulation of UMIP already sets kvm_cpu_caps.

No functional change intended.
