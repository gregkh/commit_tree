ethtool: provide channel counts with CHANNELS_GET request

Implement CHANNELS_GET request to get channel counts of a network device.
These are traditionally available via ETHTOOL_GCHANNELS ioctl request.

Omit attributes for channel types which are not supported by driver or
device (zero reported for maximum).

v2: (all suggested by Jakub Kicinski)
  - minor cleanup in channels_prepare_data()
  - more descriptive channels_reply_size()
  - omit attributes with zero max count
