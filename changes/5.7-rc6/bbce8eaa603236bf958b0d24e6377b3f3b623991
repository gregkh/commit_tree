cpufreq: add function to get the hardware max frequency

Add weak function to return the hardware maximum frequency of a CPU,
with the default implementation returning cpuinfo.max_freq, which is
the best information we can generically get from the cpufreq framework.

The default can be overwritten by a strong function in platforms
that want to provide an alternative implementation, with more accurate
information, obtained either from hardware or firmware.
