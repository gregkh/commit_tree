KVM: x86: Remove the unnecessary loop on CPUID 0x7 sub-leafs

Explicitly handle CPUID 0x7 sub-leaf 1.  The kernel is currently aware
of exactly one feature in CPUID 0x7.1,  which means there is room for
another 127 features before CPUID 0x7.2 will see the light of day, i.e.
the looping is likely to be dead code for years to come.
