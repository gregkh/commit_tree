x86/fpu/xstate: Fix last_good_offset in setup_xstate_features()

The function setup_xstate_features() uses CPUID to find each xfeature's
standard-format offset and size.  Since XSAVES always uses the compacted
format, supervisor xstates are *NEVER* in the standard-format and their
offsets are left as -1's.  However, they are still being tracked as
last_good_offset.

Fix it by tracking only user xstate offsets.

 [ bp: Use xfeature_is_supervisor() and save an indentation level. Drop
   now unused xfeature_is_user(). ]
