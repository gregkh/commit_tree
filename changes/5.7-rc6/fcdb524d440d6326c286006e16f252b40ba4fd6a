powerpc/kernel/sysfs: Refactor current sysfs.c

An attempt to refactor the current sysfs.c file.
To start with a big chuck of macro #defines and dscr
functions are moved to start of the file. Secondly,
HAS_ #define macros are cleanup based on CONFIG_ options

Finally new HAS_ macro added:
1. HAS_PPC_PA6T (for PA6T) to separate out non-PMU SPRs.
2. HAS_PPC_PMC56 to separate out PMC SPR's from HAS_PPC_PMC_CLASSIC
   which come under CONFIG_PPC64.
