Input: icn8505 - Switch to firmware_request_platform for retreiving the fw

Unfortunately sofar we have been unable to get permission to redistribute
icn8505 touchscreen firmwares in linux-firmware. This means that people
need to find and install the firmware themselves before the touchscreen
will work

Some UEFI/x86 tablets with an icn8505 touchscreen have a copy of the fw
embedded in their UEFI boot-services code.

This commit makes the icn8505 driver use the new firmware_request_platform
function, which will fallback to looking for such an embedded copy when
direct filesystem lookup fails. This will make the touchscreen work OOTB
on devices where there is a fw copy embedded in the UEFI code.
