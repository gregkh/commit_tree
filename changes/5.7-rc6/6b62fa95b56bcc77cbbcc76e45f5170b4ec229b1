ASoC: fix card registration regression.

This reverts commit b2354e4009a773c00054b964d937e1b81cb92078.

This change might have been desirable to ensure the uniqueness of
the component name. It would have helped to better support linux
devices which register multiple components, something is which more
common than initially thought.

However, some card driver are directly using dev_name() to fill the
component names of the dai_link which is a problem if want to change
the way ASoC generates the component names.

Until we figure out the appropriate way to deal with this, revert the
change and keep the names as they were. There might be a couple of warning
related to debugfs (which were already present before the change) but it
is still better than breaking working audio cards.
