mm/sparse.c: only use subsection map in VMEMMAP case

Currently, to support subsection aligned memory region adding for pmem,
subsection map is added to track which subsection is present.

However, config ZONE_DEVICE depends on SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.  It means
subsection map only makes sense when SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP enabled.  For the
classic sparse, it's meaningless.  Even worse, it may confuse people when
checking code related to the classic sparse.

About the classic sparse which doesn't support subsection hotplug, Dan
said it's more because the effort and maintenance burden outweighs the
benefit.  Besides, the current 64 bit ARCHes all enable
SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP_ENABLE by default.

Combining the above reasons, no need to provide subsection map and the
relevant handling for the classic sparse.  Let's remove them.
