KVM: x86: Directly return __vmalloc() result in ->vm_alloc()

Directly return the __vmalloc() result in {svm,vmx}_vm_alloc() to pave
the way for handling VM alloc/free in common x86 code, and to obviate
the need to check the result of __vmalloc() in vendor specific code.
Add a build-time assertion to ensure each structs' "kvm" field stays at
offset 0, which allows interpreting a "struct kvm_{svm,vmx}" as a
"struct kvm".
