sched/topology: Remove SD_BALANCE_WAKE on asymmetric capacity systems

SD_BALANCE_WAKE was previously added to lower sched_domain levels on
asymmetric CPU capacity systems by commit:

  9ee1cda5ee25 ("sched/core: Enable SD_BALANCE_WAKE for asymmetric capacity systems")

to enable the use of find_idlest_cpu() and friends to find an appropriate
CPU for tasks.

That responsibility has now been shifted to select_idle_sibling() and
friends, and hence the flag can be removed. Note that this causes
asymmetric CPU capacity systems to no longer enter the slow wakeup path
(find_idlest_cpu()) on wakeups - only on execs and forks (which is aligned
with all other mainline topologies).
