perf vendor events amd: Update Zen1 events to V2

This patch updates the PMCs for AMD Zen1 core based processors (Family
17h; Models 0 through 2F) to be in accordance with PMCs as
documented in the latest versions of the AMD Processor Programming
Reference [1], [2] and [3]. Note that some events, such as FPU pipe
assignment are missing in [1], and therefore [3] is included for full
coverage of events.

PMCs added:

  fpu_pipe_assignment.dual{0|1|2|3}
  fpu_pipe_assignment.total{0|1|2|3}
  ls_mab_alloc.dc_prefetcher
  ls_mab_alloc.stores
  ls_mab_alloc.loads
  bp_dyn_ind_pred
  bp_de_redirect

PMC removed:

  ex_ret_cond_misp

Cumulative counts, fpu_pipe_assignment.total and
fpu_pipe_assignment.dual, existed in v1, but did expose port-level
counters.

ex_ret_cond_misp has been removed as it has been removed from the latest
versions of the PPR, and when tested, always seems to sample zero as
tested on a Ryzen 3400G system.
