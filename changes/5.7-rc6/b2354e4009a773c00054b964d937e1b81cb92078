ASoC: core: ensure component names are unique

Make sure each ASoC component is registered with a unique name.
The component is derived from the device name. If a device registers more
than one component, the component names will be the same.

This usually brings up a warning about the debugfs directory creation of
the component since directory already exists.

In such case, start numbering the component of the device so the names
don't collide anymore.
