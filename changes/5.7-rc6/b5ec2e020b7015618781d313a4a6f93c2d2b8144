KVM: nSVM: do not change host intercepts while nested VM is running

Instead of touching the host intercepts so that the bitwise OR in
recalc_intercepts just works, mask away uninteresting intercepts
directly in recalc_intercepts.

This is cleaner and keeps the logic in one place even for intercepts
that can change even while L2 is running.
