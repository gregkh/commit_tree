cifs: do not ignore the SYNC flags in getattr

Check the AT_STATX_FORCE_SYNC flag and force an attribute
revalidation if requested by the caller, and if the caller
specificies AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC only revalidate cached attributes
if required.  In addition do not flush writes in getattr (which
can be expensive) if size or timestamps not requested by the
caller.
