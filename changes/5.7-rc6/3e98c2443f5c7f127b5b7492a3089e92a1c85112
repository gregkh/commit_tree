nvme: Check for readiness more quickly, to speed up boot time

After initialization, nvme_wait_ready checks for readiness every 100ms,
even though the drive may be ready far sooner than that. This delays
system boot by hundreds of milliseconds. Reduce the delay, checking for
readiness every millisecond instead.

Boot-time tests on an AWS c5.12xlarge:
