net/mlx5: E-Switch, Refactor unload all reps per rep type

Following introduction of per vport configuration of vport and rep,
unload all reps per rep type is still needed as IB reps can be
unloaded individually. However, a few internal functions exist purely
for this purpose, merge them to a single function.

This patch doesn't change any existing functionality.
