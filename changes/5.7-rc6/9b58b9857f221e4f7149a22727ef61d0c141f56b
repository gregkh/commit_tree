KVM: SVM: Convert feature updates from CPUID to KVM cpu caps

Use the recently introduced KVM CPU caps to propagate SVM-only (kernel)
settings to supported CPUID flags.

Note, there are a few subtleties:

  - Setting a flag based on a *different* feature is effectively
    emulation, and must be done at runtime via ->set_supported_cpuid().

  - CPUID 0x8000000A.EDX is a feature leaf that was previously not
    adjusted by kvm_cpu_cap_mask() because all features are hidden by
    default.

Opportunistically add a technically unnecessary break and fix an
indentation issue in svm_set_supported_cpuid().

No functional change intended.
