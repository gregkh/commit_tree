efi/x86: Avoid using code32_start

code32_start is meant for 16-bit real-mode bootloaders to inform the
kernel where the 32-bit protected mode code starts. Nothing in the
protected mode kernel except the EFI stub uses it.

efi_main() currently returns boot_params, with code32_start set inside it
to tell efi_stub_entry() where startup_32 is located. Since it was invoked
by efi_stub_entry() in the first place, boot_params is already known.
Return the address of startup_32 instead.

This will allow a 64-bit kernel to live above 4Gb, for example, and it's
cleaner as well.
