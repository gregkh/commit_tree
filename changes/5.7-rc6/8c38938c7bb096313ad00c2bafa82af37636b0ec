btrfs: move the root freeing stuff into btrfs_put_root

There are a few different ways to free roots, either you allocated them
yourself and you just do

free_extent_buffer(root->node);
free_extent_buffer(root->commit_node);
btrfs_put_root(root);

Which is the pattern for log roots.  Or for snapshots/subvolumes that
are being dropped you simply call btrfs_free_fs_root() which does all
the cleanup for you.

Unify this all into btrfs_put_root(), so that we don't free up things
associated with the root until the last reference is dropped.  This
makes the root freeing code much more significant.

The only caveat is at close_ctree() time we have to free the extent
buffers for all of our main roots (extent_root, chunk_root, etc) because
we have to drop the btree_inode and we'll run into issues if we hold
onto those nodes until ->kill_sb() time.  This will be addressed in the
future when we kill the btree_inode.
