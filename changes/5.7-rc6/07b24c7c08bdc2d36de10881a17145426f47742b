crypto: pcrypt - simplify error handling in pcrypt_create_aead()

Simplify the error handling in pcrypt_create_aead() by taking advantage
of crypto_grab_aead() now handling an ERR_PTR() name and by taking
advantage of crypto_drop_aead() now accepting (as a no-op) a spawn that
hasn't been grabbed yet.

This required also making padata_free_shell() accept a NULL argument.
