kthread: mark timer used by delayed kthread works as IRQ safe

The timer used by delayed kthread works are IRQ safe because the used
kthread_delayed_work_timer_fn() is IRQ safe.

It is properly marked when initialized by KTHREAD_DELAYED_WORK_INIT().
But TIMER_IRQSAFE flag is missing when initialized by
kthread_init_delayed_work().

The missing flag might trigger invalid warning from del_timer_sync() when
kthread_mod_delayed_work() is called with interrupts disabled.

This patch is result of a discussion about using the API, see
