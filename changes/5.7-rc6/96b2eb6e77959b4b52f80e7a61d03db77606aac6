tools, bpftool: Fix struct_ops command invalid pointer free

In commit 65c93628599d ("bpftool: Add struct_ops support") a new
type of command named struct_ops has been added. This command requires
a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y set and for retrieving BTF info
in bpftool, the helper get_btf_vmlinux() is used.

When running this command on kernel without BTF debug info, this will
lead to 'btf_vmlinux' variable being an invalid(error) pointer. And by
this, btf_free() causes a segfault when executing 'bpftool struct_ops'.

This commit adds pointer validation with IS_ERR not to free invalid
pointer, and this will fix the segfault issue.
