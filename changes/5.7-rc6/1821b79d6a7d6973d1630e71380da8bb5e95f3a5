rtc: ds1307: check for failed memory allocation on wdt

Currently a failed memory allocation will lead to a null pointer
dereference on point wdt.  Fix this by checking for a failed
allocation and just returning.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference null return")
Fixes: fd90d48db037 ("rtc: ds1307: add support for watchdog timer on ds1388")
