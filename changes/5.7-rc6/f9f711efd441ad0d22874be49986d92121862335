arm64: tegra: Fix Tegra194 PCIe compatible string

If the kernel configuration option CONFIG_PCIE_DW_PLAT_HOST is enabled
then this can cause the kernel to incorrectly probe the generic
designware PCIe platform driver instead of the Tegra194 designware PCIe
driver. This causes a boot failure on Tegra194 because the necessary
configuration to access the hardware is not performed.

The order in which the compatible strings are populated in Device-Tree
is not relevant in this case, because the kernel will attempt to probe
the device as soon as a driver is loaded and if the generic designware
PCIe driver is loaded first, then this driver will be probed first.
Therefore, to fix this problem, remove the "snps,dw-pcie" string from
the compatible string as we never want this driver to be probe on
Tegra194.
