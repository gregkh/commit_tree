mm: introduce fault_signal_pending()

For most architectures, we've got a quick path to detect fatal signal
after a handle_mm_fault().  Introduce a helper for that quick path.

It cleans the current codes a bit so we don't need to duplicate the same
check across archs.  More importantly, this will be an unified place that
we handle the signal immediately right after an interrupted page fault, so
it'll be much easier for us if we want to change the behavior of handling
signals later on for all the archs.

Note that currently only part of the archs are using this new helper,
because some archs have their own way to handle signals.  In the follow up
patches, we'll try to apply this helper to all the rest of archs.

Another note is that the "regs" parameter in the new helper is not used
yet.  It'll be used very soon.  Now we kept it in this patch only to avoid
touching all the archs again in the follow up patches.
