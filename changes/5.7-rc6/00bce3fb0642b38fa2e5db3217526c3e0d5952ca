Bluetooth: Enable erroneous data reporting if WBS is supported

This change introduces a wide band speech setting which allows higher
level clients to query the local controller support for wide band speech
as well as set the setting state when the radio is powered off.
Internally, this setting controls if erroneous data reporting is enabled
on the controller.
