drm/fb-helper: Remove drm_fb_helper add, add_all and remove connector functions

drm_fb_helper_single_add_all_connectors(),
drm_fb_helper_add_one_connector()
and drm_fb_helper_remove_one_connector() don't keep an array of
connectors anymore and are just dummy. Now we have no callers to these
functions hence remove them.
