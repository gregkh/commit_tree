ASoC: soc-core: Merge CPU/Codec DAIs

ALSA SoC is currently categorizing CPU/Codec DAIs,
and it works well.

But modern devices require more complex connections,
for example Codec to Codec, etc, and future devices will
enable to more complex connections.
Because of these background, CPU/Codec DAIs categorizing is
no longer good much to modern device.

Currently, rtd has both CPU/Codec DAIs pointer.

	rtd->cpu_dais   = [][][][][][][][][]
	rtd->codec_dais = [][][][][][][][][]

This patch merges these into DAIs pointer.

	rtd->dais = [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
	            ^cpu_dais         ^codec_dais
	            |--- num_cpus ---|--- num_codecs --|

Then, we can merge for_each_rtd_cpu/codec_dais() from this patch.

-	for_each_rtd_cpu_dais() {
-		...
-	}
-	for_each_rtd_codec_dais() {
-		...
-	}
+	for_each_rtd_dais() {
+		...
+	}
