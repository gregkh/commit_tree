efi/x86: Remove extra headroom for setup block

The following commit:

  223e3ee56f77 ("efi/x86: add headroom to decompressor BSS to account for setup block")

added headroom to the PE image to account for the setup block, which
wasn't used for the decompression buffer.

Now that the decompression buffer is located at the start of the image,
and includes the setup block, this is no longer required.

Add a check to make sure that the head section of the compressed kernel
won't overwrite itself while relocating. This is only for
future-proofing as with current limits on the setup and the actual size
of the head section, this can never happen.
