io_uring: polled fixed file must go through free iteration

When we changed the file registration handling, it became important to
iterate the bulk request freeing list for fixed files as well, or we
miss dropping the fixed file reference. If not, we're leaking references,
and we'll get a kworker stuck waiting for file references to disappear.

This also means we can remove the special casing of fixed vs non-fixed
files, we need to iterate for both and we can just rely on
__io_req_aux_free() doing io_put_file() instead of doing it manually.
