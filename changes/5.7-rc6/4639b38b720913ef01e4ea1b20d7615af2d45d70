Revert "arm64: dts: sdm845: add IPA information"

This reverts commit 9cc5ae125f0eaee471bc87fb5cbf29385fd9272a.

This commit:
  b303f9f0050b arm64: dts: sdm845: Redefine interconnect provider DT nodes
found in the Qualcomm for-next tree removes/redefines the interconnect
provider node(s) used for IPA.  I'm not sure whether it technically
conflicts with the IPA change to "sdm845.dtsi" in for-next, but it renders
it broken.

Revert this commit in the for-next tree, with the plan to incorporate
it into the Qualcomm tree instead.
