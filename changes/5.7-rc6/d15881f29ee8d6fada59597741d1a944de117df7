ARM: dts: rcar-gen2: Add reset control properties for display

Add reset control properties to the device nodes for the Display Units
on all supported R-Car Gen2 SoCs.  Note that on these SoCs, there is
only a single reset for all DU channels.

Join the clocks lines while at it, to increase uniformity.
