srcu: Fix process_srcu()/srcu_batches_completed() datarace

The srcu_struct structure's ->srcu_idx field is accessed locklessly,
so reads must use READ_ONCE().  This commit therefore adds the needed
READ_ONCE() invocation where it was missed.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely.
