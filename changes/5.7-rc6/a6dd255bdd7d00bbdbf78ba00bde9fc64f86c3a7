bus: hisi_lpc: Fixup IO ports addresses to avoid use-after-free in host removal

Some released ACPI FW for Huawei boards describes incorrect the port IO
address range for child devices, in that it tells us the IO port max range
is 0x3fff for each child device, which is not correct. The address range
should be [e4:e8) or similar. With this incorrect upper range, the child
device IO port resources overlap.

As such, the kernel thinks that the LPC host serial device is a child of
the IPMI device:

root@(none)$ more /proc/ioports
[...]
00ffc0e3-00ffffff : hisi-lpc-ipmi.0.auto
  00ffc0e3-00ffc0e3 : ipmi_si
  00ffc0e4-00ffc0e4 : ipmi_si
  00ffc0e5-00ffc0e5 : ipmi_si
  00ffc2f7-00ffffff : serial8250.1.auto
    00ffc2f7-00ffc2fe : serial
root@(none)$

They should both be siblings. Note that these are logical PIO addresses,
which have a direct mapping from the FW IO port ranges.

This shows up as a real issue when we enable CONFIG_KASAN and
CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE - we see use-after-free warnings in the
host removal path:

The issue here is that the kernel created an incorrect parent-child
resource dependency between two devices, and references the false parent
node when deleting the second child device, when it had been deleted
already.

Fix up the child device resources from FW to create proper IO port
resource relationships for broken FW.

With this, the IO port layout looks more healthy:

root@(none)$ more /proc/ioports
[...]
00ffc0e3-00ffc0e7 : hisi-lpc-ipmi.0.auto
  00ffc0e3-00ffc0e3 : ipmi_si
