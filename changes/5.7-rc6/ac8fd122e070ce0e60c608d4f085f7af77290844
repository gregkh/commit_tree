MIPS: Replace setup_irq() by request_irq()

request_irq() is preferred over setup_irq(). Invocations of setup_irq()
occur after memory allocators are ready.

Per tglx[1], setup_irq() existed in olden days when allocators were not
ready by the time early interrupts were initialized.

Hence replace setup_irq() by request_irq().

remove_irq() has been replaced by free_irq() as well.

There were build error's during previous version, couple of which was
reported by kbuild test robot <lkp@intel.com> of which one was reported
by Thomas Bogendoerfer <tsbogend@alpha.franken.de> as well. There were a
few more issues including build errors, those also have been fixed.
