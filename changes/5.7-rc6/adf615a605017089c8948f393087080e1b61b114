ALSA: hda/hdmi: Move ELD parse and jack reporting into update_eld()

This is a final step of the cleanup series: move the HDMI ELD parser
call into update_eld() function so that we can unify the calls.
The ELD validity check is unified in update_eld(), too.

Along with it, the repoll scheduling is moved to update_eld() as well,
where sync_eld_via_acomp() just passes 0 for skipping it.
