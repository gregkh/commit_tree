net: dsa: Do not leave DSA master with NULL netdev_ops

When ndo_get_phys_port_name() for the CPU port was added we introduced
an early check for when the DSA master network device in
dsa_master_ndo_setup() already implements ndo_get_phys_port_name(). When
we perform the teardown operation in dsa_master_ndo_teardown() we would
not be checking that cpu_dp->orig_ndo_ops was successfully allocated and
non-NULL initialized.

With network device drivers such as virtio_net, this leads to a NPD as
soon as the DSA switch hanging off of it gets torn down because we are
now assigning the virtio_net device's netdev_ops a NULL pointer.
