drm/omap: hdmi5: Move mode set, enable and disable operations to bridge

Move the omap_dss_device .set_timings(), .enable() and .disable()
operations to the drm_bridge functions. As the drm_bridge for the HDMI
encoder is unconditionally registered and attached, those operations
will be called at the appropriate time.

The omapdss device .set_infoframe() and .set_hdmi_mode() operations have
no equivalent in drm_bridge. Thir content is thus moved to the bridge
.enable() operation as the data they store is not needed before the HDMI
encoder gets enabled.
