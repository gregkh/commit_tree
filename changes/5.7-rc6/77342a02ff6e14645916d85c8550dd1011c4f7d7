gcc-plugins: drop support for GCC <= 4.7

Nobody was opposed to raising minimum GCC version to 4.8 [1]
So, we will drop GCC <= 4.7 support sooner or later.

We always use C++ compiler for building plugins for GCC >= 4.8.

This commit drops the plugin support for GCC <= 4.7 a bit earlier,
which allows us to dump lots of code.
