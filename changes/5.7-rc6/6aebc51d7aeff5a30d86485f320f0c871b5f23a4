drm/lima: support heap buffer creation

heap buffer is used as output of GP and input of PP for
Mali Utgard GPU. Size of heap buffer depends on the task
so is a runtime variable.

Previously we just create a large enough buffer as heap
buffer. Now we add a heap buffer type to be able to
increase the backup memory dynamically when GP fail due
to lack of heap memory.
