debugfs: regset32: Add Runtime PM support

Hardware registers of devices under control of power management cannot
be accessed at all times.  If such a device is suspended, register
accesses may lead to undefined behavior, like reading bogus values, or
causing exceptions or system lock-ups.

Extend struct debugfs_regset32 with an optional field to let device
drivers specify the device the registers in the set belong to.  This
allows debugfs_show_regset32() to make sure the device is resumed while
its registers are being read.
