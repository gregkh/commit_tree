powerpc/64s/exception: Avoid touching the stack in hdecrementer

The hdec interrupt handler is reported to sometimes fire in Linux if
KVM leaves it pending after a guest exists. This is harmless, so there
is a no-op handler for it.

The interrupt handler currently uses the regular kernel stack. Change
this to avoid touching the stack entirely.

This should be the last place where the regular Linux stack can be
accessed with asynchronous interrupts (including PMI) soft-masked.
It might be possible to take advantage of this invariant, e.g., to
context switch the kernel stack SLB entry without clearing MSR[EE].
