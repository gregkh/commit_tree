powerpc: Rename current_stack_pointer() to current_stack_frame()

current_stack_pointer(), which was called __get_SP(), used to just
return the value in r1.

But that caused problems in some cases, so it was turned into a
function in commit bfe9a2cfe91a ("powerpc: Reimplement __get_SP() as a
function not a define").

Because it's a function in a separate compilation unit to all its
callers, it has the effect of causing a stack frame to be created, and
then returns the address of that frame. This is good in some cases
like those described in the above commit, but in other cases it's
overkill, we just need to know what stack page we're on.

On some other arches current_stack_pointer is just a register global
giving the stack pointer, and we'd like to do that too. So rename our
current_stack_pointer() to current_stack_frame() to make that
possible.
