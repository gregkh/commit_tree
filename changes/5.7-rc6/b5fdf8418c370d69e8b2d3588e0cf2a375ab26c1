NFSv4: Add support for CB_RECALL_ANY for flexfiles layouts

When we receive a CB_RECALL_ANY that asks us to return flexfiles
layouts, we iterate through all the layouts and look at whether or
not there are active open file descriptors that might need them
for I/O. If there are no such descriptors, we return the layouts.
