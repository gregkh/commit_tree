cpufreq: Convert to new X86 CPU match macros

The new macro set has a consistent namespace and uses C99 initializers
instead of the grufty C89 ones.

Get rid the of most local macro wrappers for consistency. The ones which
make sense for readability are renamed to X86_MATCH*.

In the centrino driver this also removes the two extra duplicates of family
6 model 13 which have no value at all.
