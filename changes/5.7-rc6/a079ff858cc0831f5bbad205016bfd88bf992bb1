spi: dt-bindings: spi-controller: Fix #address-cells for slave mode

Currently, the DT bindings for an SPI controller specify that
"#address-cells" must be fixed to one.  However, that applies to an SPI
controller in master mode only.  When running in SPI slave mode,
"#address-cells" should not be specified.

Fix this making "#address-cells" mutually-exclusive with "spi-slave".
