libbpf: Provide CO-RE variants of PT_REGS macros

Syscall raw tracepoints have struct pt_regs pointer as tracepoint's first
argument. After that, reading any of pt_regs fields requires bpf_probe_read(),
even for tp_btf programs. Due to that, PT_REGS_PARMx macros are not usable as
is. This patch adds CO-RE variants of those macros that use BPF_CORE_READ() to
read necessary fields. This provides relocatable architecture-agnostic pt_regs
field accesses.
