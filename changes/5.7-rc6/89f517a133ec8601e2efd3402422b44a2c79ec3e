media: imx: imx7-mipi-csis: Filter on CSI-2 data type

Enable filtering based on CSI-2 data type. Otherwise sources that send
multiple data types (such as sensors that send embedded data) will not
be properly supported. They will both result in additional non-image
lines being captured, and in the receiver being confused as it doesn't
resynchronise on vsync.
