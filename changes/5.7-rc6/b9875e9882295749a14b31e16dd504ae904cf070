locking/lockdep: Display irq_context names in /proc/lockdep_chains

Currently, the irq_context field of a lock chains displayed in
/proc/lockdep_chains is just a number. It is likely that many people
may not know what a non-zero number means. To make the information more
useful, print the actual irq names ("softirq" and "hardirq") instead.
