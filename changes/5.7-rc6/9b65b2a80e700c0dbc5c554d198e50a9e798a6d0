ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: remove unnecessary ROM IPC filter function

The HDA_DSP_IPC_PURGE_FW IPC from ROM is already handled in
cl_dsp_init(), and as IPC IRQ is disabled at this stage, this
IPC will be never received in the IRQ thread. The function
hda_dsp_ipc_is_sof for filtering the ROM IPC can be removed
safely.
