ALSA: usb-audio: Create a registration quirk for Kingston HyperX Amp (0951:16d8)

Create a quirk that allows special processing and/or
skipping the call to snd_card_register.

For HyperX AMP, which uses two interfaces, but only has
a capture stream in the second, this allows the capture
stream to merge with the first PCM.
