arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Remove unused SPDIF sound card

As of v5.7-rc2, Linux now prints the following message at boot:

  [   33.848525] platform sound_spdif: deferred probe pending

This is because sound_spdif is waiting on its CPU DAI &spdif to probe,
but &spdif is disabled in the device tree.

Exposure of the SPDIF pin is board-specific functionality, so the sound
card and codec DAI belong in the individual board DTS, not the SoC DTSI.
In fact, no in-tree A64 board DTS enables &spdif, so let's remove the
card and DAI entirely.

This reverts commit 78e071370a86473f25923e03b51cbbadacf8be0f.
