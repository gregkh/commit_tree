powerpc/ps3: Convert half completion to rcuwait

The PS3 notification interrupt and kthread use a hacked up completion to
communicate. Since we're wanting to change the completion implementation and
this is abuse anyway, replace it with a simple rcuwait since there is only ever
the one waiter.

AFAICT the kthread uses TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE to not increase loadavg, kthreads
cannot receive signals by default and this one doesn't look different. Use
TASK_IDLE instead.
