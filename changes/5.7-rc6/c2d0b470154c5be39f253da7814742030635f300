efi/libstub/x86: Incorporate eboot.c into libstub

Most of the EFI stub source files of all architectures reside under
drivers/firmware/efi/libstub, where they share a Makefile with special
CFLAGS and an include file with declarations that are only relevant
for stub code.

Currently, we carry a lot of stub specific stuff in linux/efi.h only
because eboot.c in arch/x86 needs them as well. So let's move eboot.c
into libstub/, and move the contents of eboot.h that we still care
about into efistub.h
