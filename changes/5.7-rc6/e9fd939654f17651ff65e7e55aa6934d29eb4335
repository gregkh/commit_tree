io_uring/io-wq: forward submission ref to async

First it changes io-wq interfaces. It replaces {get,put}_work() with
free_work(), which guaranteed to be called exactly once. It also enforces
free_work() callback to be non-NULL.

io_uring follows the changes and instead of putting a submission reference
in io_put_req_async_completion(), it will be done in io_free_work(). As
removes io_get_work() with corresponding refcount_inc(), the ref balance
is maintained.
