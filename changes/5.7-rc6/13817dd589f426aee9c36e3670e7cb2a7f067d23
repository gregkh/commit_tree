rcu: Tighten rcu_lockdep_assert_cblist_protected() check

The ->nocb_lock lockdep assertion is currently guarded by cpu_online(),
which is incorrect for no-CBs CPUs, whose callback lists must be
protected by ->nocb_lock regardless of whether or not the corresponding
CPU is online.  This situation could result in failure to detect bugs
resulting from failing to hold ->nocb_lock for offline CPUs.

This commit therefore removes the cpu_online() guard.
