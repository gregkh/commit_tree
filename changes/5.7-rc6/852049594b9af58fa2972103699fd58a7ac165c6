clk: ti: clkctrl: convert subclocks to use proper names also

Addition of the new internal API to get the clkctrl names missed adding
the same conversion in place for the subclocks. This leads into missed
parent/child relationships (i.e. orphaned clocks) with mixed node name
handling, for example with omap4/omap5 where the l4_per clocks are using
new naming, but rest are using old. Fix by converting the subclock
registration to pick correct names for the clocks also.
