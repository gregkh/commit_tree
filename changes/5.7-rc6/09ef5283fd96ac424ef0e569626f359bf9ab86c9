mm/mmap.c: initialize align_offset explicitly for vm_unmapped_area

On passing requirement to vm_unmapped_area, arch_get_unmapped_area and
arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown did not set align_offset.  Internally on
both unmapped_area and unmapped_area_topdown, if info->align_mask is 0,
then info->align_offset was meaningless.

But commit df529cabb7a2 ("mm: mmap: add trace point of
vm_unmapped_area") always prints info->align_offset even though it is
uninitialized.

Fix this uninitialized value issue by setting it to 0 explicitly.

Before:
  vm_unmapped_area: addr=0x755b155000 err=0 total_vm=0x15aaf0 flags=0x1 len=0x109000 lo=0x8000 hi=0x75eed48000 mask=0x0 ofs=0x4022

After:
  vm_unmapped_area: addr=0x74a4ca1000 err=0 total_vm=0x168ab1 flags=0x1 len=0x9000 lo=0x8000 hi=0x753d94b000 mask=0x0 ofs=0x0
