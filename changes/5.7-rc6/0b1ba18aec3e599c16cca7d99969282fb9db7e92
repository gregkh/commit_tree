net: ipa: zero return code before issuing generic EE command

Zero the result code stored in a field of the scratch 0 register
before issuing a generic EE command.  This just guarantees that
the value we read later was actually written as a result of the
command.

Also add the definitions of two more possible result codes that can
be returned when issuing flow control enable or disable commands:
  INCORRECT_CHANNEL_STATE: - channel must be in started state
  INCORRECT_DIRECTION - flow control is only valid for TX channels
