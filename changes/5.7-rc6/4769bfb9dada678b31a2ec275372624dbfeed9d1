ALSA: pcm: Add a standalone version of snd_pcm_limit_hw_rates

It can be useful to derive min/max rates of a snd_pcm_hardware without
having a snd_pcm_runtime, such as before constructing an ASoC DAI link.

Create a new helper that takes a pointer to a snd_pcm_hardware directly,
and refactor the original function as a wrapper around it, to avoid
needing to update any call sites.
