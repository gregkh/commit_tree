coredump: fix null pointer dereference on coredump

If the core_pattern is set to "|" and any process segfaults then we get
a null pointer derefernce while trying to coredump. The call stack shows:

    RIP: do_coredump+0x628/0x11c0

When the core_pattern has only "|" there is no use of trying the
coredump and we can check that while formating the corename and exit
with an error.

After this change I get:

    format_corename failed
    Aborting core

Fixes: 315c69261dd3 ("coredump: split pipe command whitespace before expanding template")
