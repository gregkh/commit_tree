bpftool: Use linux/types.h from source tree for profiler build

When compiling bpftool on a system where the /usr/include/asm symlink
doesn't exist (e.g. on an Ubuntu system without gcc-multilib installed),
the build fails with:

    CLANG    skeleton/profiler.bpf.o
  In file included from skeleton/profiler.bpf.c:4:
  In file included from /usr/include/linux/bpf.h:11:
  /usr/include/linux/types.h:5:10: fatal error: 'asm/types.h' file not found
  #include <asm/types.h>
           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 error generated.
  make: *** [Makefile:123: skeleton/profiler.bpf.o] Error 1

This indicates that the build is using linux/types.h from system headers
instead of source tree headers.

To fix this, adjust the clang search path to include the necessary
headers from tools/testing/selftests/bpf/include/uapi and
tools/include/uapi. Also use __bitwise__ instead of __bitwise in
skeleton/profiler.h to avoid clashing with the definition in
tools/testing/selftests/bpf/include/uapi/linux/types.h.
