NFS: Fix fscache super_cookie allocation

Commit f2aedb713c28 ("NFS: Add fs_context support.") reworked
NFS mount code paths for fs_context support which included
super_block initialization.  In the process there was an extra
return left in the code and so we never call
nfs_fscache_get_super_cookie even if 'fsc' is given on as mount
option.  In addition, there is an extra check inside
nfs_fscache_get_super_cookie for the NFS_OPTION_FSCACHE which
is unnecessary since the only caller nfs_get_cache_cookie
checks this flag.
