f2fs: Fix mount failure due to SPO after a successful online resize FS

Even though online resize is successfully done, a SPO immediately
after resize, still causes below error in the next mount.

[   11.294650] F2FS-fs (sda8): Wrong user_block_count: 2233856
[   11.300272] F2FS-fs (sda8): Failed to get valid F2FS checkpoint

This is because after FS metadata is updated in update_fs_metadata()
if the SBI_IS_DIRTY is not dirty, then CP will not be done to reflect
the new user_block_count.
