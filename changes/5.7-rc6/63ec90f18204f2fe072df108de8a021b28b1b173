um: ensure `make ARCH=um mrproper` removes arch/$(SUBARCH)/include/generated/

In this workflow:

$ make ARCH=um defconfig && make ARCH=um -j8

$ make ARCH=um mrproper

$ make ARCH=um defconfig O=./build_um && make ARCH=um -j8 O=./build_um

make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/iha/sdb/opensource/lkmp/linux-kselftest.git/build_um'
make: *** [Makefile:180: sub-make] Error 2

The cause of the error was because arch/$(SUBARCH)/include/generated files
weren't properly cleaned by `make ARCH=um mrproper`.
