net: sched: RED: Introduce an ECN nodrop mode

When the RED Qdisc is currently configured to enable ECN, the RED algorithm
is used to decide whether a certain SKB should be marked. If that SKB is
not ECN-capable, it is early-dropped.

It is also possible to keep all traffic in the queue, and just mark the
ECN-capable subset of it, as appropriate under the RED algorithm. Some
switches support this mode, and some installations make use of it.

To that end, add a new RED flag, TC_RED_NODROP. When the Qdisc is
configured with this flag, non-ECT traffic is enqueued instead of being
early-dropped.
