userfaultfd: fix remap event with MREMAP_DONTUNMAP

A user is not required to set a new address when using MREMAP_DONTUNMAP
as it can be used without MREMAP_FIXED.  When doing so the remap event
will use new_addr which may not have been set and we didn't propagate it
back other then in the return value of remap_to.

Because ret is always the new address it's probably more correct to use
it rather than new_addr on the remap_event_complete call, and it
resolves this bug.
