RISC-V: Add bitmap reprensenting ISA features common across CPUs

This patch adds riscv_isa bitmap which represents Host ISA features
common across all Host CPUs. The riscv_isa is not same as elf_hwcap
because elf_hwcap will only have ISA features relevant for user-space
apps whereas riscv_isa will have ISA features relevant to both kernel
and user-space apps.

One of the use-case for riscv_isa bitmap is in KVM hypervisor where
we will use it to do following operations:

1. Check whether hypervisor extension is available
2. Find ISA features that need to be virtualized (e.g. floating
   point support, vector extension, etc.)
