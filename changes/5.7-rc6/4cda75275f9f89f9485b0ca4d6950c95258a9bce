net: sched: make newly activated qdiscs visible

In their .attach callback, mq[prio] only add the qdiscs of the currently
active TX queues to the device's qdisc hash list.
If a user later increases the number of active TX queues, their qdiscs
are not visible via eg. 'tc qdisc show'.

Add a hook to netif_set_real_num_tx_queues() that walks all active
TX queues and adds those which are missing to the hash list.
