soundwire: cadence: make SSP interval programmable

In multi-master mode, the IP will only accept SSP intervals with
integer relationships between the frame rate and the gsync frequency.

E.g for a 48kHz frame rate and 4 kHz gsync signal, the SSP interval
can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.

To simplify we only allow one SSP per gsync interval.
