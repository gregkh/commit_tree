net: stmmac: gmac5+: fix potential integer overflow on 32 bit multiply

The multiplication of cfg->ctr[1] by 1000000000 is performed using a
32 bit multiplication (since cfg->ctr[1] is a u32) and this can lead
to a potential overflow. Fix this by making the constant a ULL to
ensure a 64 bit multiply occurs.
