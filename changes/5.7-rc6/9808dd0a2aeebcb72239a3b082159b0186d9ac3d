net/mlx5e: CT: Use rhashtable's ct entries instead of a separate list

Fixes CT entries list corruption.

After allowing parallel insertion/removals in upper nf flow table
layer, unprotected ct entries list can be corrupted by parallel add/del
on the same flow table.

CT entries list is only used while freeing a ct zone flow table to
go over all the ct entries offloaded on that zone/table, and flush
the table.

As rhashtable already provides an api to go over all the inserted entries,
fix the race by using the rhashtable iteration instead, and remove the list.
