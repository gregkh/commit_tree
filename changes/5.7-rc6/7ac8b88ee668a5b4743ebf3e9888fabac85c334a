btrfs: backref, only collect file extent items matching backref offset

When resolving one backref of type EXTENT_DATA_REF, we collect all
references that simply reference the EXTENT_ITEM even though their
(file_pos - file_extent_item::offset) are not the same as the
btrfs_extent_data_ref::offset we are searching for.

This patch adds additional check so that we only collect references whose
(file_pos - file_extent_item::offset) == btrfs_extent_data_ref::offset.
