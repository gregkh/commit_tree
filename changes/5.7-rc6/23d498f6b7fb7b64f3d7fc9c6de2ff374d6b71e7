drm/debugfs: also take per device driver features into account

Use drm_core_check_all_features() to ensure both the driver features and
the per-device driver features are taken into account when registering
debugfs files.

v3:
- files[i].driver_features == 0 actually means "don't care"

v2:
- use drm_core_check_all_features()
