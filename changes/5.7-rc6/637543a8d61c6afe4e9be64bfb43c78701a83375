KVM: x86: Fixes posted interrupt check for IRQs delivery modes

Current logic incorrectly uses the enum ioapic_irq_destination_types
to check the posted interrupt destination types. However, the value was
set using APIC_DM_XXX macros, which are left-shifted by 8 bits.

Fixes by using the APIC_DM_FIXED and APIC_DM_LOWEST instead.
