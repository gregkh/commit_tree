tunnel: Propagate ECT(1) when decapsulating as recommended by RFC6040

RFC 6040 recommends propagating an ECT(1) mark from an outer tunnel header
to the inner header if that inner header is already marked as ECT(0). When
RFC 6040 decapsulation was implemented, this case of propagation was not
added. This simply appears to be an oversight, so let's fix that.
