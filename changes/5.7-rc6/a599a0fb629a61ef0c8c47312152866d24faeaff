usb: core: Add ACPI support for USB interface devices

Currently on ACPI-enabled systems the USB interface device has no link to
the actual firmware node and thus drivers may not parse additional information
given in the table. The new feature, proposed here, allows to pass properties
or other information to the drivers.

The ACPI companion of the device has to be set for USB interface devices
to achieve above. Use ACPI_COMPANION_SET macro to set this.

Note, OF already does link of_node and this is the same for ACPI case.
