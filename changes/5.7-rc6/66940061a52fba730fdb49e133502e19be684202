drm/i915/gt: Protect signaler walk with RCU

While we know that the waiters cannot disappear as we walk our list
(only that they might be added), the same cannot be said for our
signalers as they may be completed by the HW and retired as we process
this request. Ergo we need to use rcu to protect the list iteration and
remember to mark up the list_del_rcu.

v2: Mark the deps as safe-for-rcu
