libbpf: Initialize *nl_pid so gcc 10 is happy

Builds of Fedora's kernel-tools package started to fail with "may be
used uninitialized" warnings for nl_pid in bpf_set_link_xdp_fd() and
bpf_get_link_xdp_info() on the s390 architecture.

Although libbpf_netlink_open() always returns a negative number when it
does not set *nl_pid, the compiler does not determine this and thus
believes the variable might be used uninitialized. Assuage gcc's fears
by explicitly initializing nl_pid.
