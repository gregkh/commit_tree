efi/libstub: Introduce symbolic constants for the stub major/minor version

Now that we have added new ways to load the initrd or the mixed mode
kernel, we will also need a way to tell the loader about this. Add
symbolic constants for the PE/COFF major/minor version numbers (which
fortunately have always been 0x0 for all architectures), so that we
can bump them later to document the capabilities of the stub.
