net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: fix irqs type

The K3 INTA driver, which is source TX/RX IRQs for CPSW NUSS, defines IRQs
triggering type as EDGE by default, but triggering type for CPSW NUSS TX/RX
IRQs has to be LEVEL as the EDGE triggering type may cause unnecessary IRQs
triggering and NAPI scheduling for empty queues. It was discovered with
RT-kernel.

Fix it by explicitly specifying CPSW NUSS TX/RX IRQ type as
IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH.
