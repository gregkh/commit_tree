nvmem: check for NULL reg_read and reg_write before dereferencing

Return -EPERM if reg_read is NULL in bin_attr_nvmem_read() or if
reg_write is NULL in bin_attr_nvmem_write().

This prevents NULL dereferences such as the one described in
03cd45d2e219 ("thunderbolt: Prevent crash if non-active NVMem file is
read")
