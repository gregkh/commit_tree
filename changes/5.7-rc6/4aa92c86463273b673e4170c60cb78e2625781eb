EDAC/mc: Remove per layer counters

Looking at how mci->{ue,ce}_per_layer[EDAC_MAX_LAYERS] is used, it
turns out that only the leaves in the memory hierarchy are consumed
(in sysfs), but not the intermediate layers, e.g.:

  count = dimm->mci->ce_per_layer[dimm->mci->n_layers-1][dimm->idx];

These unused counters only add complexity, remove them. The error
counter values are directly stored in struct dimm_info now.
