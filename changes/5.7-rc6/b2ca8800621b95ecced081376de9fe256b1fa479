i2c: qcom-geni: Let firmware specify irq trigger flags

We don't need to force IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH here as the DT or ACPI tables
should take care of this for us. Just use 0 instead so that we use the
flags from the firmware. Also, remove specify dev_name() for the irq
name so that we can get better information in /proc/interrupts about
which device is generating interrupts.
