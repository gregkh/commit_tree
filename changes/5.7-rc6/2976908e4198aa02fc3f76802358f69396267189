x86/mce: Do not log spurious corrected mce errors

A user has reported that they are seeing spurious corrected errors on
their hardware.

Intel Errata HSD131, HSM142, HSW131, and BDM48 report that "spurious
corrected errors may be logged in the IA32_MC0_STATUS register with
the valid field (bit 63) set, the uncorrected error field (bit 61) not
set, a Model Specific Error Code (bits [31:16]) of 0x000F, and an MCA
Error Code (bits [15:0]) of 0x0005." The Errata PDFs are linked in the
bugzilla below.

Block these spurious errors from the console and logs.

 [ bp: Move the intel_filter_mce() header declarations into the already
   existing CONFIG_X86_MCE_INTEL ifdeffery. ]
