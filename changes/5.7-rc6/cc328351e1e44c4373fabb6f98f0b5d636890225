drm/i915/gt: Wait for the wa batch to be pinned

Be sure to wait for the vma to be in place before we tell the GPU to
execute from the wa batch. Since initialisation is mostly synchronous
(or rather at some point during start up we will need to sync anyway),
we can affort to do an explicit i915_vma_sync() during wa batch
construction rather than check for a required await on every context
switch. (We don't expect to change the wa bb at run time so paying the
cost once up front seems preferrable.)
