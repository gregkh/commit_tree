drm/amd/display: Make clock table struct more accessible

[WHY]
Currently clock table struct is very far down in the bounding box struct
making it hard to find while debugging, especially when using the
dal3dbgext.

[HOW]
Move it up so it is the first struct defined, and therefore much easier
to find and access.
