RISC-V: Mark existing SBI as 0.1 SBI.

As per the new SBI specification, current SBI implementation version
is defined as 0.1 and will be removed/replaced in future. Each of the
function call in 0.1 is defined as a separate extension which makes
easier to replace them one at a time.

Rename existing implementation to reflect that. This patch is just
a preparatory patch for SBI v0.2 and doesn't introduce any functional
changes.
