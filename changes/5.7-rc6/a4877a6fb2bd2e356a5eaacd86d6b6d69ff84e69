ASoC: soc-pcm: fix regression in soc_new_pcm()

Commit af4bac11531f ("ASoC: soc-pcm: crash in snd_soc_dapm_new_dai")
swapped the SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_* parameter in the
snd_soc_dai_stream_valid(cpu_dai, ...) checks. But that works only
for codec2codec links. For normal links it breaks registration of
playback/capture-only PCM devices.

E.g. on qcom/apq8016_sbc there is usually one playback-only and one
capture-only PCM device, but they disappeared after the commit.

The codec2codec case was added in commit a342031cdd08
("ASoC: create pcm for codec2codec links as well") as an extra check
(e.g. `playback = playback && cpu_playback->channels_min`).

We should be able to simplify the code by checking directly for
the correct stream type in the loop.
This also fixes the regression because we check for PLAYBACK for
both codec and cpu dai again when codec2codec is not used.
