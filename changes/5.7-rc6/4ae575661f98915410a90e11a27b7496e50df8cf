net/mlxfw: Generic mlx FW flash status notify

FW flash status notify is currently implemented via a callback to the
caller mlx module, and all it is doing is to call
devlink_flash_update_status_notify with the specific module devlink
instance.

Instead of repeating the whole process for all mlx modules and
re-implement the status_notify callback again and again. Just provide the
devlink instance as part of mlxfw_dev when calling mlxfw_firmware_flash
and let mlxfw do the devlink status updates directly.

This will be very useful for adding status notify support to mlx5, as
already done in this patch, with a simple one line of just providing the
devlink instance to mlxfw_firmware_flash.

mlxfw now depends on NET_DEVLINK as all other mlx modules.
