coresight: cti: Add device tree support for custom CTI

Adds support for CTIs whose connections are implementation defined at
hardware design time, and not constrained by v8 architecture.

These CTIs have no standard connection setup, all the settings have to
be defined in the device tree files. The patch creates a set of connections
and trigger signals based on the information provided.
