selftests/x86/vdso: Fix no-vDSO segfaults

test_vdso would try to call a NULL pointer if the vDSO was missing.

vdso_restorer_32 hit a genuine failure: trying to use the
kernel-provided signal restorer doesn't work if the vDSO is missing.
Skip the test if the vDSO is missing, since the test adds no particular
value in that case.
