net/mlx5: Fix forced completion access non initialized command entry

mlx5_cmd_flush() will trigger forced completions to all valid command
entries. Triggered by an asynch event such as fast teardown it can
happen at any stage of the command, including command initialization.
It will trigger forced completion and that can lead to completion on an
uninitialized command entry.

Setting MLX5_CMD_ENT_STATE_PENDING_COMP only after command entry is
initialized will ensure force completion is treated only if command
entry is initialized.
