PCI/ASPM: Reduce severity of common clock config message

When the UEFI/BIOS or bootloader has not initialised a PCIe device we would
get the following message:

  kern.warning: pci 0000:00:01.0: ASPM: current common clock configuration is broken, reconfiguring

"warning" and "broken" are slightly misleading. On an embedded system it is
quite possible for the bootloader to avoid configuring PCIe devices if they
are not needed.

Downgrade the message to pci_info() and change "broken" to "inconsistent"
since we fix up the inconsistency in the code immediately following the
message (and emit an error if that fails).
