perf tools: Add hw_idx in struct branch_stack

The low level index of raw branch records for the most recent branch can
be recorded in a sample with PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_HW_INDEX
branch_sample_type. Extend struct branch_stack to support it.

However, if the PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_HW_INDEX is not applied, only nr and
entries[] will be output by kernel. The pointer of entries[] could be
wrong, since the output format is different with new struct
branch_stack.  Add a variable no_hw_idx in struct perf_sample to
indicate whether the hw_idx is output.  Add get_branch_entry() to return
corresponding pointer of entries[0].

To make dummy branch sample consistent as new branch sample, add hw_idx
in struct dummy_branch_stack for cs-etm and intel-pt.

Apply the new struct branch_stack for synthetic events as well.

Extend test case sample-parsing to support new struct branch_stack.

Committer notes:

Renamed get_branch_entries() to perf_sample__branch_entries() to have
proper namespacing and pave the way for this to be moved to libperf,
eventually.

Add 'static' to that inline as it is in a header.

Add 'hw_idx' to 'struct dummy_branch_stack' in cs-etm.c to fix the build
on arm64.
