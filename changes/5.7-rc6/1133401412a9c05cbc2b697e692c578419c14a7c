RDMA/hns: Optimize base address table config flow for qp buffer

Currently, before the qp is created, a page size needs to be calculated
for the base address table to store all base addresses in the mtr. As a
result, the parameter configuration of the mtr is complex. So integrate
the process of calculating the base table page size into the hem related
interface to simplify the process of using mtr.
