uml: Create a private mount of proc for mconsole

The mconsole code only ever accesses proc for the initial pid
namespace.  Instead of depending upon the proc_mnt which is
for proc_flush_task have uml create it's own mount of proc
instead.

This allows proc_flush_task to evolve and remove the
need for having a proc_mnt to do it's job.
