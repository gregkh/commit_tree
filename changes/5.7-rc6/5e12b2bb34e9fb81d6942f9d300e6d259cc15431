KVM: x86: Replace bare "unsigned" with "unsigned int" in cpuid helpers

Replace "unsigned" with "unsigned int" to make checkpatch and people
everywhere a little bit happier, and to avoid propagating the filth when
future patches add more cpuid helpers that work with unsigned (ints).

No functional change intended.
