dt-bindings: soc: qcom: fix IPA binding

The definitions for the "qcom,smem-states" and "qcom,smem-state-names"
properties need to list their "$ref" under an "allOf" keyword.

In addition, fix two problems in the example at the end:
  - Use #include for header files that define needed symbolic values
  - Terminate the line that includes the "ipa-shared" register space
    name with a comma rather than a semicolon

Finally, update some white space in the example for better alignment.
