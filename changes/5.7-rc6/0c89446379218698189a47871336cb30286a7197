dmaengine: mmp_tdma: Reset channel error on release

When a channel configuration fails, the status of the channel is set to
DEV_ERROR so that an attempt to submit it fails. However, this status
sticks until the heat end of the universe, making it impossible to
recover from the error.

Let's reset it when the channel is released so that further use of the
channel with correct configuration is not impacted.
