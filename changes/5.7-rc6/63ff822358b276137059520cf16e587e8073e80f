io_uring: don't use 'fd' for openat/openat2/statx

We currently make some guesses as when to open this fd, but in reality
we have no business (or need) to do so at all. In fact, it makes certain
things fail, like O_PATH.

Remove the fd lookup from these opcodes, we're just passing the 'fd' to
generic helpers anyway. With that, we can also remove the special casing
of fd values in io_req_needs_file(), and the 'fd_non_neg' check that
we have. And we can ensure that we only read sqe->fd once.

This fixes O_PATH usage with openat/openat2, and ditto statx path side
oddities.
