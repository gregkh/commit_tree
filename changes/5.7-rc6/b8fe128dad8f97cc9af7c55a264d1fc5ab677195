arch_topology: Adjust initial CPU capacities with current freq

The CPU freqs are not supposed to change before cpufreq policies
properly registered, meaning that they should be used to calculate the
initial CPU capacities.

Doing this helps choosing the best CPU during early boot, especially
for the initramfs decompressing.

There's no functional changes for non-clk CPU DVFS mechanism.
