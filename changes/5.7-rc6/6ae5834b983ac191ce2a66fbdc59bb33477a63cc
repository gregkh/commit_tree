net: dsa: b53: add MTU configuration support

It looks like the Broadcom switches supported by the b53 driver don't
support precise configuration of the MTU, but just a mumbo-jumbo boolean
flag. Set that.

Also configure BCM583XX devices to send and receive jumbo frames when
ports are configured with 10/100 Mbps speed.
