arm64: mm: convert cpu_do_switch_mm() to C

There's no reason that cpu_do_switch_mm() needs to be written as an
assembly function, and having it as a C function would make it easier to
maintain.

This patch converts cpu_do_switch_mm() to C, removing code that this
change makes redundant (e.g. the mmid macro). Since the header comment
was stale and the prototype now implies all the necessary information,
this comment is removed. The 'pgd_phys' argument is made a phys_addr_t
to match the return type of virt_to_phys().

At the same time, post_ttbr_update_workaround() is updated to use
IS_ENABLED(), which allows the compiler to figure out it can elide calls
for !CONFIG_CAVIUM_ERRATUM_27456 builds.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
