ubsan: add trap instrumentation option

Patch series "ubsan: Split out bounds checker", v5.

This splits out the bounds checker so it can be individually used.  This
is enabled in Android and hopefully for syzbot.  Includes LKDTM tests for
behavioral corner-cases (beyond just the bounds checker), and adjusts
ubsan and kasan slightly for correct panic handling.

This patch (of 6):

The Undefined Behavior Sanitizer can operate in two modes: warning
reporting mode via lib/ubsan.c handler calls, or trap mode, which uses
__builtin_trap() as the handler.  Using lib/ubsan.c means the kernel image
is about 5% larger (due to all the debugging text and reporting structures
to capture details about the warning conditions).  Using the trap mode,
the image size changes are much smaller, though at the loss of the
"warning only" mode.

In order to give greater flexibility to system builders that want minimal
changes to image size and are prepared to deal with kernel code being
aborted and potentially destabilizing the system, this introduces
CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP.  The resulting image sizes comparison:

   text    data     bss       dec       hex     filename
19533663   6183037  18554956  44271656  2a38828 vmlinux.stock
19991849   7618513  18874448  46484810  2c54d4a vmlinux.ubsan
19712181   6284181  18366540  44362902  2a4ec96 vmlinux.ubsan-trap

CONFIG_UBSAN=y:      image +4.8% (text +2.3%, data +18.9%)
CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP=y: image +0.2% (text +0.9%, data +1.6%)

Additionally adjusts the CONFIG_UBSAN Kconfig help for clarity and removes
the mention of non-existing boot param "ubsan_handle".
