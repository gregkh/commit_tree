efi: Move UGA and PROP table handling to x86 code

The UGA table is x86 specific (its handling was introduced when the
EFI support code was modified to accommodate IA32), so there is no
need to handle it in generic code.

The EFI properties table is not strictly x86 specific, but it was
deprecated almost immediately after having been introduced, due to
implementation difficulties. Only x86 takes it into account today,
and this is not going to change, so make this table x86 only as well.
