arm64: sdei: Annotate SDEI entry points using new style annotations

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly
functions new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC with two different annotations for normal functions and those
with unusual calling conventions.

The SDEI entry points are currently annotated as normal functions but
are called from non-kernel contexts with non-standard calling convention
and should therefore be annotated as such so do so.
