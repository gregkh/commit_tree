KVM: VMX: pass correct DR6 for GD userspace exit

When KVM_EXIT_DEBUG is raised for the disabled-breakpoints case (DR7.GD),
DR6 was incorrectly copied from the value in the VM.  Instead,
DR6.BD should be set in order to catch this case.

On AMD this does not need any special code because the processor triggers
a #DB exception that is intercepted.  However, the testcase would fail
without the previous patch because both DR6.BS and DR6.BD would be set.
