cdc_ncm: Implement the 32-bit version of NCM Transfer Block

The NCM specification defines two formats of transfer blocks: with 16-bit
fields (NTB-16) and with 32-bit fields (NTB-32). Currently only NTB-16 is
implemented.

This patch adds the support of NTB-32. The motivation behind this is that
some devices such as E5785 or E5885 from the current generation of Huawei
LTE routers do not support NTB-16. The previous generations of Huawei
devices are also use NTB-32 by default.

Also this patch enables NTB-32 by default for Huawei devices.

During the 2019 ValdikSS made five attempts to contact Huawei to add the
NTB-16 support to their router firmware, but they were unsuccessful.
