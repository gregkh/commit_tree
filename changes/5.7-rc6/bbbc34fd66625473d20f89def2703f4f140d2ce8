f2fs: clean up bggc mount option

There are three status for background gc: on, off and sync, it's
a little bit confused to use test_opt(BG_GC) and test_opt(FORCE_FG_GC)
combinations to indicate status of background gc.

So let's remove F2FS_MOUNT_BG_GC and F2FS_MOUNT_FORCE_FG_GC mount
options, and add F2FS_OPTION().bggc_mode with below three status
to clean up codes and enhance bggc mode's scalability.

enum {
	BGGC_MODE_ON,		/* background gc is on */
	BGGC_MODE_OFF,		/* background gc is off */
	BGGC_MODE_SYNC,		/*
				 * background gc is on, migrating blocks
				 * like foreground gc
				 */
};
