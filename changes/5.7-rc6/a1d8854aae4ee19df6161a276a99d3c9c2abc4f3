RDMA/mlx5: Fix MR cache size and limit debugfs

The size_write function is supposed to adjust the total_mr's to match the
user's request, but lacks locking and safety checking.

total_mrs can only be adjusted by at most available_mrs. mrs already
assigned to users cannot be revoked. Ensure that the user provides a
target value within the range of available_mrs and within the high/low
water mark.

limit_write has confusing and wrong sanity checking, and doesn't have the
ability to deallocate on limit reduction.

Since both functions use the same algorithm to adjust the available_mrs,
consolidate it into one function and write it correctly. Fix the locking
and by holding the spinlock for all accesses to ent->X.

Always fail if the user provides a malformed string.
