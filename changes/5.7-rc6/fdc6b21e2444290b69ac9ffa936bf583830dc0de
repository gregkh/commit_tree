platform/chrome: Add Type C connector class driver

Add a driver to implement the Type C connector class for Chrome OS
devices with ECs (Embedded Controllers).

The driver relies on firmware device specifications for various port
attributes. On ACPI platforms, this is specified using the logical
device with HID GOOG0014. On DT platforms, this is specified using the
DT node with compatible string "google,cros-ec-typec".

The driver reads the device FW node and uses the port attributes to
register the typec ports with the Type C connector class framework, but
doesn't do much else.

Subsequent patches will add more functionality to the driver, including
obtaining current port information (polarity, vconn role, current power
role etc.) after querying the EC.
