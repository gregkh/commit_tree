bus: mhi: core: Add support for basic PM operations

This commit adds support for basic MHI PM operations such as
mhi_async_power_up, mhi_sync_power_up, and mhi_power_down. These
routines places the MHI bus into respective power domain states
and calls the state_transition APIs when necessary. The MHI
controller driver is expected to call these PM routines for
MHI powerup and powerdown.

This is based on the patch submitted by Sujeev Dias:
