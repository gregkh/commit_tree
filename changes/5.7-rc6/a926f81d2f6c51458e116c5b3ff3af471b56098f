xen/cpuhotplug: Replace cpu_up/down() with device_online/offline()

The core device API performs extra housekeeping bits that are missing
from directly calling cpu_up/down().

See commit a6717c01ddc2 ("powerpc/rtas: use device model APIs and
serialization during LPM") for an example description of what might go
wrong.

This also prepares to make cpu_up/down() a private interface of the cpu
subsystem.
