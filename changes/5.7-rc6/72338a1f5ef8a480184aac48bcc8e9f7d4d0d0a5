drm/i915/gt: Expose reset stop timeout via sysfs

When we allow ourselves to sleep before a GPU reset after disabling
submission, even for a few milliseconds, gives an innocent context the
opportunity to clear the GPU before the reset occurs. However, how long
to sleep depends on the typical non-preemptible duration (a similar
problem to determining the ideal preempt-reset timeout or even the
heartbeat interval). As this seems of a hard policy decision, punt it to
userspace.

The timeout can be adjusted using
