selftests/bpf: Make tcp_rtt test more robust to failures

Switch to non-blocking accept and wait for server thread to exit before
proceeding. I noticed that sometimes tcp_rtt server thread failure would
"spill over" into other tests (that would run after tcp_rtt), probably just
because server thread exits much later and tcp_rtt doesn't wait for it.

v1->v2:
  - add usleep() while waiting on initial non-blocking accept() (Stanislav);
