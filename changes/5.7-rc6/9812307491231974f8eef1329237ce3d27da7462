net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: remove duplicate assignment of struct members

These struct members named 'phylink_validate' was assigned twice:

static const struct mv88e6xxx_ops mv88e6190_ops = {
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390_phylink_validate,
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390_phylink_validate,
};

static const struct mv88e6xxx_ops mv88e6190x_ops = {
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390_phylink_validate,
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390x_phylink_validate,
};

static const struct mv88e6xxx_ops mv88e6191_ops = {
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390_phylink_validate,
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390_phylink_validate,
};

static const struct mv88e6xxx_ops mv88e6290_ops = {
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390_phylink_validate,
	......
	.phylink_validate = mv88e6390_phylink_validate,
};

Remove all the first one and leave the second one which are been used in
fact. Be aware that for 'mv88e6190x_ops' the assignment functions is
different while the others are all the same. This fixes the following
coccicheck warning:
