lib/stackdepot.c: check depot_index before accessing the stack slab

Avoid crashes on corrupted stack ids.  Despite stack ID corruption may
indicate other bugs in the program, we'd better fail gracefully on such
IDs instead of crashing the kernel.

This patch has been previously mailed as part of KMSAN RFC patch series.

Subject: lib/stackdepot.c: fix a condition in stack_depot_fetch()

We should check for a NULL pointer first before adding the offset.
Otherwise if the pointer is NULL and the offset is non-zero, it will lead
to an Oops.
