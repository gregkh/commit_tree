net: mscc: ocelot: adjust maxlen on NPI port, not CPU

Being a non-physical port, the CPU port does not have an ocelot_port
structure, so the ocelot_port_writel call inside the
ocelot_port_set_maxlen() function would access data behind a NULL
pointer.

This is a patch for net-next only, the net tree boots fine, the bug was
introduced during the net -> net-next merge.
