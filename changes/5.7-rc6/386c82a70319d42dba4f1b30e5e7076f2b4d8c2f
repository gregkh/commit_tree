gpu/trace: Minor comment updates for gpu_mem_total tracepoint

This change updates the improper comment for the 'size' attribute in the
tracepoint definition. Most gfx drivers pre-fault in physical pages
instead of making virtual allocations. So we drop the 'Virtual' keyword
here and leave this to the implementations.
