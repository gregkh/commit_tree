vmxnet3: let core reject the unsupported coalescing parameters

Set ethtool_ops->supported_coalesce_params to let
the core reject unsupported coalescing parameters.

This driver correctly rejects all unsupported parameters.
As a side effect of these changes the error code for
unsupported params changes from EINVAL to EOPNOTSUPP.
