IB/iser: Always check sig MR before putting it to the free pool

libiscsi calls the check_protection transport handler only if SCSI-Respose
is received. So, the handler is never called if iSCSI task is completed
for some other reason like a timeout or error handling. And this behavior
looks correct. But the iSER does not handle this case properly because it
puts a non-checked signature MR to the free pool. Then the error occurs at
reusing the MR because it is not allowed to invalidate a signature MR
without checking.

This commit adds an extra check to iser_unreg_mem_fastreg(), which is a
part of the task cleanup flow. Now the signature MR is checked there if it
is needed.
