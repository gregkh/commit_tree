fbmem: Adjust indentation in fb_prepare_logo and fb_blank

Clang warns:

../drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:665:3: warning: misleading
indentation; statement is not part of the previous 'else'
[-Wmisleading-indentation]
        if (fb_logo.depth > 4 && depth > 4) {
        ^
../drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:661:2: note: previous statement is
here
        else
        ^
../drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:1075:3: warning: misleading
indentation; statement is not part of the previous 'if'
[-Wmisleading-indentation]
        return ret;
        ^
../drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:1072:2: note: previous statement is
here
        if (!ret)
        ^
2 warnings generated.

This warning occurs because there are spaces before the tabs on these
lines. Normalize the indentation in these functions so that it is
consistent with the Linux kernel coding style and clang no longer warns.
