net/mlx5e: Use preactivate hook to set the indirection table

mlx5e_ethtool_set_channels updates the indirection table before
switching to the new channels. If the switch fails, the indirection
table is new, but the channels are old, which is wrong. Fix it by using
the preactivate hook of mlx5e_safe_switch_channels to update the
indirection table at the stage when nothing can fail anymore.

As the code that updates the indirection table is now encapsulated into
a new function, use that function in the attach flow when the driver has
to reduce the number of channels, and prepare the code for the next
commit.
