KVM: x86: Handle Intel PT CPUID adjustment in VMX code

Move the Processor Trace CPUID adjustment into VMX code to eliminate
an instance of the undesirable "unsigned f_* = *_supported ? F(*) : 0"
pattern in the common CPUID handling code, and to pave the way toward
eventually removing ->pt_supported().

No functional change intended.
