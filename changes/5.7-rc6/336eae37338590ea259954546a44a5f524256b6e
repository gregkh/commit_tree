floppy: remove incomplete support for second FDC from ARM code

The ARM code was written with the apparent hope to one day support
a second FDC except that the code was incomplete and only touches
the first one, which is also reflected by N_FDC==1. However this
made its fd_outb() macro artificially depend on the global or local
"fdc" variable.

Let's get rid of this and make it explicit it doesn't rely on this
variable anymore.
