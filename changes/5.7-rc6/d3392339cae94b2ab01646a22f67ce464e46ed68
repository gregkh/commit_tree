mmc: cqhci: Update cqhci memory ioresource name

Update cqhci memory ioresource name from cqhci_mem to cqhci since
suffix _mem is redundant.

Only sdhci-msm driver is making use of this resource as of now.
No other vendor's driver is using it. So this update shouldn't affect
any other vendor's cqhci functionality.
