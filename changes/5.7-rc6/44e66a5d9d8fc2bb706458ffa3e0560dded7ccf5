ARM: dts: AM4372: Add the PRU-ICSS interconnect target-module node

The AM437x family of SoCs contains two dissimilar PRU-ICSS instances,
but leverage a common reset line and SYSCFG from the larger PRU-ICSS1
instance. This SYSC register has also very unique bit-fields. Both
the IPs require the PRCM reset to be deasserted to be able to access
any registers. Add a common PRUSS interconnect target-module with all
the required properties.

The PRUSS devices themselves shall be added as child nodes to this
interconnect node in the future. The PRU-ICSS instances are not
supported on AM4372 SoC though in the AM437x family, so the target
module node should be disabled in any derivative board files that
use this SoC.
