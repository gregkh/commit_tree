scsi: target: Write NULL to *port_nexus_ptr if no ISID

This patch fixes a minor flaw that could be triggered by a PR OUT RESERVE
on iSCSI, if TRANSPORT IDs with and without ISID are used in the same
command.  In case an ISCSI Transport ID has no ISID, port_nexus_ptr was not
used to write NULL, so value from previous call might persist.  I don't
know if that ever could happen, but with the change the code is cleaner, I
think.
