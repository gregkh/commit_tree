mptcp: replace mptcp_disconnect with a stub

Paolo points out that mptcp_disconnect is bogus:
"lock_sock(sk);
looks suspicious (lock should be already held by the caller)
And call to: tcp_disconnect(sk, flags); too, sk is not a tcp
socket".

->disconnect() gets called from e.g. inet_stream_connect when
one tries to disassociate a connected socket again (to re-connect
without closing the socket first).
MPTCP however uses mptcp_stream_connect, not inet_stream_connect,
for the mptcp-socket connect call.

inet_stream_connect only gets called indirectly, for the tcp socket,
so any ->disconnect() calls end up calling tcp_disconnect for that
tcp subflow sk.

This also explains why syzkaller has not yet reported a problem
here.  So for now replace this with a stub that doesn't do anything.
