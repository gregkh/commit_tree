gcc-10: disable 'stringop-overflow' warning for now

This is the final array bounds warning removal for gcc-10 for now.

Again, the warning is good, and we should re-enable all these warnings
when we have converted all the legacy array declaration cases to
flexible arrays. But in the meantime, it's just noise.
