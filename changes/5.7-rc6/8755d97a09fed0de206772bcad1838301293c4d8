io_uring: Ensure mask is initialized in io_arm_poll_handler

Clang warns:

fs/io_uring.c:4178:6: warning: variable 'mask' is used uninitialized
whenever 'if' condition is false [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        if (def->pollin)
            ^~~~~~~~~~~
fs/io_uring.c:4182:2: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        mask |= POLLERR | POLLPRI;
        ^~~~
fs/io_uring.c:4178:2: note: remove the 'if' if its condition is always
true
        if (def->pollin)
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
fs/io_uring.c:4154:15: note: initialize the variable 'mask' to silence
this warning
        __poll_t mask, ret;
                     ^
                      = 0
1 warning generated.

io_op_defs has many definitions where pollin is not set so mask indeed
might be uninitialized. Initialize it to zero and change the next
assignment to |=, in case further masks are added in the future to avoid
missing changing the assignment then.
