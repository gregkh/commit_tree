HID: wacom: Read HID_DG_CONTACTMAX directly for non-generic devices

We've recently switched from extracting the value of HID_DG_CONTACTMAX
at a fixed offset (which may not be correct for all tablets) to
injecting the report into the driver for the generic codepath to handle.
Unfortunately, this change was made for *all* tablets, even those which
aren't generic. Because `wacom_wac_report` ignores reports from non-
generic devices, the contact count never gets initialized. Ultimately
this results in the touch device itself failing to probe, and thus the
loss of touch input.

This commit adds back the fixed-offset extraction for non-generic devices.
