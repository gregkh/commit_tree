ionic: remove lifs on fw reset

When the FW RESET event comes to the driver from the firmware,
or the fw_status goes to 0 (stopped) or to 0xff (no PCI
connection), then shut down the driver activity.  This event
signals a FW upgrade where we need to quiesce all operations and
wait for the FW to restart.  The FW will continue the update
process once it sees all the LIFs are reset.  When the update
process is done it will set the fw_status back to RUNNING.
Meanwhile, the heartbeat check continues and when the fw_status
is seen as set to running we can restart the driver operations.
