acpi/nfit: improve bounds checking for 'func'

The 'func' variable can come from the user in the __nd_ioctl().  If it's
too high then the (1 << func) shift in acpi_nfit_clear_to_send() is
undefined.  In acpi_nfit_ctl() we pass 'func' to test_bit(func, &dsm_mask)
which could result in an out of bounds access.

To fix these issues, I introduced the NVDIMM_CMD_MAX (31) define and
updated nfit_dsm_revid() to use that define as well instead of magic
numbers.
