sched/numa: Use similar logic to the load balancer for moving between domains with spare capacity

The standard load balancer generally tries to keep the number of running
tasks or idle CPUs balanced between NUMA domains. The NUMA balancer allows
tasks to move if there is spare capacity but this causes a conflict and
utilisation between NUMA nodes gets badly skewed. This patch uses similar
logic between the NUMA balancer and load balancer when deciding if a task
migrating to its preferred node can use an idle CPU.
