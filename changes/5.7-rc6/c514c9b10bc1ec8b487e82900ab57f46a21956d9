btrfs: don't kmap() pages from block devices

Block device mappings are never in highmem so kmap() / kunmap() calls for
pages from block devices are unneeded. Use page_address() instead of
kmap() to get to the virtual addreses.

While we're at it, read_cache_page_gfp() doesn't return NULL on error,
only an ERR_PTR, so use IS_ERR() to check for errors.
