batman-adv: Fix refcnt leak in batadv_store_throughput_override

batadv_show_throughput_override() invokes batadv_hardif_get_by_netdev(),
which gets a batadv_hard_iface object from net_dev with increased refcnt
and its reference is assigned to a local pointer 'hard_iface'.

When batadv_store_throughput_override() returns, "hard_iface" becomes
invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.

The issue happens in one error path of
batadv_store_throughput_override(). When batadv_parse_throughput()
returns NULL, the refcnt increased by batadv_hardif_get_by_netdev() is
not decreased, causing a refcnt leak.

Fix this issue by jumping to "out" label when batadv_parse_throughput()
returns NULL.
