mptcp: fix race in msk status update

Currently subflow_finish_connect() changes unconditionally
any msk socket status other than TCP_ESTABLISHED.

If an unblocking connect() races with close(), we can end-up
triggering:

IPv4: Attempt to release TCP socket in state 1 00000000e32b8b7e

when the msk socket is disposed.

Be sure to enter the established status only from SYN_SENT.
