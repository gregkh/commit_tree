ALSA: hda/realtek - Add COEF workaround for ASUS ZenBook UX431DA

ASUS ZenBook UX431DA requires an additional COEF setup when booted
from the recent Windows 10, otherwise it produces the noisy output.
The quirk turns on COEF 0x1b bit 10 that has been cleared supposedly
due to the pop noise reduction.
