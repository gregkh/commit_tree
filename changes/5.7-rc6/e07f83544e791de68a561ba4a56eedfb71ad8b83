arm64: dts: sc7180: Add clock controller nodes

Add the display, video & graphics clock controller nodes supported on
SC7180.

NOTE: the dispcc needs input clocks from various PHYs that aren't in
the device tree yet.  For now we'll leave these stubbed out with <0>,
which is apparently the magic way to do this.  These clocks aren't
really "optional" and this stubbing out method is apparently the best
way to handle it.
