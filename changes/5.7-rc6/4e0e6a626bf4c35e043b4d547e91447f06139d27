arm64: dts: allwinner: pinebook: Remove unused AXP803 regulators

The Pinebook does not use the CSI bus on the A64. In fact it does not
use GPIO port E for anything at all. Thus the following regulators are
not used and do not need voltages set:

 - ALDO1: Connected to VCC-PE only
 - DLDO3: Not connected
 - ELDO3: Not connected
