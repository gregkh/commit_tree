Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix Suspend-to-Idle for Generation-2 VM

Before the hibernation patchset (e.g. f53335e3289f), in a Generation-2
Linux VM on Hyper-V, the user can run "echo freeze > /sys/power/state" to
freeze the system, i.e. Suspend-to-Idle. The user can press the keyboard
or move the mouse to wake up the VM.

With the hibernation patchset, Linux VM on Hyper-V can hibernate to disk,
but Suspend-to-Idle is broken: when the synthetic keyboard/mouse are
suspended, there is no way to wake up the VM.

Fix the issue by not suspending and resuming the vmbus devices upon
Suspend-to-Idle.

Fixes: f53335e3289f ("Drivers: hv: vmbus: Suspend/resume the vmbus itself for hibernation")
