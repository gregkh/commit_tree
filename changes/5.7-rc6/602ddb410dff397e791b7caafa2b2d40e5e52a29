drm/i915: Flush execution tasklets before checking request status

Rather than flushing the submission tasklets just before we sleep, flush
before we check the request status. Ideally this gives us a moment to
process the tasklets after sleeping just before we timeout.

v2: Compromise by pushing the flush prior to the timeout, but after the
check on completion so that we do not further delay the ready client.
