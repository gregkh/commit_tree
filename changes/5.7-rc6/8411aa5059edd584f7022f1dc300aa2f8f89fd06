clk: qcom: gcc: Add USB3 PIPE clock and GDSC for SM8150

This adds the USB3 PIPE clock and GDSC structures, so
that the USB driver can vote for these resources to be
enabled/disabled when required.  Both are needed for SS
and HS USB paths to operate properly.  The GDSC will
allow the USB system to be brought out of reset, while
the PIPE clock is needed for data transactions between
the PHY and controller.
