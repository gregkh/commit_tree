arm64: dts: meson: sei510: fix sound card codec node

A codec node of the sei510 sound card is numbered with the pattern
codec@XX. This pattern should be used only if there is a reg property in
the node which is not case here. Change this to something acceptable.

This change is only to better comply with the DT spec. No functional
changes expected.
