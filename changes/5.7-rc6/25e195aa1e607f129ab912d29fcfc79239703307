follow_automount(): get rid of dead^Wstillborn code

1) no instances of ->d_automount() have ever made use of the "return
ERR_PTR(-EISDIR) if you don't feel like mounting anything" - that's
a rudiment of plans that got superseded before the thing went into
the tree.  Despite the comment in follow_automount(), autofs has
never done that.

2) if there's no ->d_automount() in dentry_operations, filesystems
should not set DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT in the first place.  None have
ever done so...
