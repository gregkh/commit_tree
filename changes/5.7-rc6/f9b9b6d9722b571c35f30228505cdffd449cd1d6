drm/amd/display: fix dcc swath size calculations on dcn1

[Why]
Swath sizes are being calculated incorrectly. The horizontal swath size
should be the product of block height, viewport width, and bytes per
element, but the calculation uses viewport height instead of width. The
vertical swath size is similarly incorrectly calculated. The effect of
this is that we report the wrong DCC caps.

[How]
Use viewport width in the horizontal swath size calculation and viewport
height in the vertical swath size calculation.
