scsi: ufs: make HCE polling more compact to improve initialization latency

Reduce the waiting period between each HCE (Host Controller Enable) polling
from 5 ms to 1 ms. Also increase the maximum polling times to make "total
polling time" roughly the same.

This change could make HCE initialization faster to improve latency of
ufshcd initialization, error recovery, and resume behaviors.
