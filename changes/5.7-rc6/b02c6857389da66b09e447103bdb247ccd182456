hwmon: (k10temp) Swap Tdie and Tctl on Family 17h CPUs

Traditionally, the temperature displayed by k10temp was Tctl.
On Family 17h CPUs, Tdie was displayed instead. To reduce confusion,
Tctl was added later as second temperature. This resulted in Tdie
being reported as temp1_input, and Tctl as temp2_input. This is
different to non-Ryzen CPUs, where Tctl is displayed as temp1_input.
Swap temp1_input and temp2_input on Family 17h CPUs, such that Tctl
is now reported as temp1_input and Tdie is reported as temp2_input,
to align with other CPUs, streamline the code, and make it less
confusing. Coincidentally, this also aligns the code with its
documentation, which states that Tdie is reported as temp2_input.
