selftests/bpf: Validate frozen map contents stays frozen

Test that frozen and mmap()'ed BPF map can't be mprotect()'ed as writable or
executable memory. Also validate that "downgrading" from writable to read-only
doesn't screw up internal writable count accounting for the purposes of map
freezing.
