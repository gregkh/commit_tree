riscv: introduce interfaces to patch kernel code

On strict kernel memory permission, we couldn't patch code without
writable permission. Preserve two holes in fixmap area, so we can map
the kernel code temporarily to fixmap area, then patch the instructions.

We need two pages here because we support the compressed instruction, so
the instruction might be align to 2 bytes. When patching the 32-bit
length instruction which is 2 bytes alignment, it will across two pages.

Introduce two interfaces to patch kernel code:
riscv_patch_text_nosync:
 - patch code without synchronization, it's caller's responsibility to
   synchronize all CPUs if needed.
riscv_patch_text:
 - patch code and always synchronize with stop_machine()
