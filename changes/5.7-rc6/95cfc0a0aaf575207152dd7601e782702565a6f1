ASoC: simple-card: Add support for codec2codec DAI links

Following the example in cb2cf0de1174 ("ASoC: soc-core: care Codec <->
Codec case by non_legacy_dai_naming"), determine if a DAI link contains
only codec DAIs by examining the non_legacy_dai_naming flag in each
DAI's component.

For now, we assume there is only one or a small set of valid PCM stream
parameters, so num_params == 1 is good enough. We also assume that the
same params are valid for all supported streams. params is set to the
subset of parameters common among all DAIs, and then the existing code
automatically chooses the highest quality of the remaining values when
the link is brought up.
