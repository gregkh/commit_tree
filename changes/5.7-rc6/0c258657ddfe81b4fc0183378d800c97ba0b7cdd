ASoC: rsnd: Don't treat master SSI in multi SSI setup as parent

The master SSI of a multi-SSI setup was attached both to the
RSND_MOD_SSI slot and the RSND_MOD_SSIP slot of the rsnd_dai_stream.
This is not correct wrt. the meaning of being "parent" in the rest of
the SSI code, where it seems to indicate an SSI that provides clock and
word sync but is not transmitting/receiving audio data.

Not treating the multi-SSI master as parent allows removal of various
special cases to the rsnd_ssi_is_parent conditions introduced in commit
a09fb3f28a60 ("ASoC: rsnd: Fix parent SSI start/stop in multi-SSI mode").
It also fixes the issue that operations performed via rsnd_dai_call()
were performed twice for the master SSI. This caused some "status check
failed" spam when stopping a multi-SSI stream as the driver attempted to
stop the master SSI twice.
