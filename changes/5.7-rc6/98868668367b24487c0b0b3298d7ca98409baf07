bpf: Abstract away entire bpf_link clean up procedure

Instead of requiring users to do three steps for cleaning up bpf_link, its
anon_inode file, and unused fd, abstract that away into bpf_link_cleanup()
helper. bpf_link_defunct() is removed, as it shouldn't be needed as an
individual operation anymore.

v1->v2:
- keep bpf_link_cleanup() static for now (Daniel).
