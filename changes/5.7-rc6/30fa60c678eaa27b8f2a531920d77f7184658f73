ARM: dts: omap4-droid4: Fix flakey wlan by disabling internal pull for gpio

The wlan on droid4 is flakey on some devices, and experiments have shown this
gets fixed if we disable the internal pull for wlan gpio interrupt line.

The symptoms are that the wlan connection is very slow and almost useless
with lots of wlcore firmware reboot warnings in the dmesg.

In addition to configuring the wlan gpio pulls, let's also configure the rest
of the wlan sd pins. We have not configured those eariler as we're booting
using kexec.
