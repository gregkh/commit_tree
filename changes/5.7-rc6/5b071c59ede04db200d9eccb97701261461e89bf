ethtool: provide timestamping information with TSINFO_GET request

Implement TSINFO_GET request to get timestamping information for a network
device. This is traditionally available via ETHTOOL_GET_TS_INFO ioctl
request.

Move part of ethtool_get_ts_info() into common.c so that ioctl and netlink
code use the same logic to get timestamping information from the device.

v3: use "TSINFO" rather than "TIMESTAMP", suggested by Richard Cochran
