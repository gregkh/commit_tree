lib/dynamic_debug.c: use address-of operator on section symbols

Clang warns:

../lib/dynamic_debug.c:1034:24: warning: array comparison always
evaluates to false [-Wtautological-compare]
        if (__start___verbose == __stop___verbose) {
                              ^
1 warning generated.

These are not true arrays, they are linker defined symbols, which are just
addresses.  Using the address of operator silences the warning and does
not change the resulting assembly with either clang/ld.lld or gcc/ld
(tested with diff + objdump -Dr).
