floppy: rename the global "fdc" variable to "current_fdc"

This is done in order to remove the confusion that arises at some places
in the code where local variables or arguments shadow the global variable.
It is already visible that some places are a bit awkward and iterate over
the global variable, for the sole reason that they used to rely on it being
named "fdc" in order to get the correct address when using FD_DOR. These
ones are easy to spot by searching for "for (current_fdc...".

Some more cleanup is definitely possible. For example
"fdc_state[current_fdc].somefield" is used all over the code and would
probably be better with "fdc_state->somefield" with fdc_state being set
when current_fdc is assigned. This would require to pass the pointer to
the current state instead of the current_fdc to the I/O functions.
