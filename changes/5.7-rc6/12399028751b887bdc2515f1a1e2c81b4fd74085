drm/i915/display: Load DP_TP_CTL/STATUS offset before use it

Right now dp.regs.dp_tp_ctl/status are only set during the encoder
pre_enable() hook, what is causing all reads and writes to those
registers to go to offset 0x0 before pre_enable() is executed.

So if i915 takes the BIOS state and don't do a modeset any following
link retraing will fail.

In the case that i915 needs to do a modeset, the DDI disable sequence
will write to a wrong register not disabling DP 'Transport Enable' in
DP_TP_CTL, making a HDMI modeset in the same port/transcoder to
not light up the monitor.

So here for GENs older than 12, that have those registers fixed at
port offset range it is loading at encoder/port init while for GEN12
it will keep setting it at encoder pre_enable() and during HW state
readout.
