iommu: spapr_tce: Disable compile testing to fix build on book3s_32 config

Although SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU itself can be compile tested on certain PowerPC
configurations, its presence makes arch/powerpc/kvm/Makefile to select
modules which do not build in such configuration.

The arch/powerpc/kvm/ modules use kvm_arch.spapr_tce_tables which exists
only with CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S_64.  However these modules are selected when
COMPILE_TEST and SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU are chosen leading to build failures:
