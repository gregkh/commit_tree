mac80211: populate debugfs only after cfg80211 init

When fixing the initialization race, we neglected to account for
the fact that debugfs is initialized in wiphy_register(), and
some debugfs things went missing (or rather were rerooted to the
global debugfs root).

Fix this by adding debugfs entries only after wiphy_register().
This requires some changes in the rate control code since it
currently adds debugfs at alloc time, which can no longer be
done after the reordering.
