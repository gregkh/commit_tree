firmware: imx: fix compile-testing

It is nice to allow compile-testing the firmware drivers, but this
fails when the dependency is a loadable module:

aarch64-linux-ld: drivers/firmware/imx/scu-pd.o: in function `imx_sc_pd_power':
scu-pd.c:(.text+0xd8): undefined reference to `imx_scu_call_rpc'
aarch64-linux-ld: scu-pd.c:(.text+0x108): undefined reference to `imx_scu_call_rpc'
aarch64-linux-ld: drivers/firmware/imx/scu-pd.o: in function `imx_sc_pd_probe':

Change the dependencies to ensure that any driver we depend on is
either reachable or we are compile-testing and it is disabled,
effectively reverting most of the previous changes that turned
out to be incorrect.

Fixes: 5b00b8375416 ("firmware: imx: add COMPILE_TEST for IMX_SCU driver")
