um: Implement time-travel=ext

This implements synchronized time-travel mode which - using a special
application on a unix socket - lets multiple machines take part in a
time-travelling simulation together.

The protocol for the unix domain socket is defined in the new file
include/uapi/linux/um_timetravel.h.
