x86/boot/compressed: Remove .eh_frame section from bzImage

Discarding unnecessary sections with "*(*)" (see thread at Link: below)
works fine with the bfd linker but fails with lld:

  $ make -j$(nproc) -s CC=clang LD=ld.lld O=out.x86_64 distclean defconfig bzImage
  ld.lld: error: discarding .shstrtab section is not allowed

lld tries to also discard essential sections like .shstrtab, .symtab and
.strtab, which results in the link failing since .shstrtab is required
by the ELF specification: the e_shstrndx field in the ELF header is the
index of .shstrtab, and each section in the section table is required to
have an sh_name that points into the .shstrtab.

.symtab and .strtab are also necessary to generate the zoffset.h file
for the bzImage header.

Since the only sizeable section that can be discarded is .eh_frame,
restrict the discard to only .eh_frame to be safe.
