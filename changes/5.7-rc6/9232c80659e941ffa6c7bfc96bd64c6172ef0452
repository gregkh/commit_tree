watchdog: Add stop_on_reboot parameter to control reboot policy

Many watchdog drivers use watchdog_stop_on_reboot() helper in order
to stop the watchdog on system reboot. Unfortunately, this logic is
coded in driver's probe function and doesn't allows user to decide what
to do during shutdown/reboot.

On the other side, Xen and Qemu watchdog drivers (xen_wdt and i6300esb)
may be configured to either send NMI or turn off/reboot VM as
the watchdog action. As the kernel may stuck at any state, sending NMIs
can't reliably reboot the VM.

At Arista, we benefited from the following set-up: the emulated watchdogs
trigger VM reset and softdog is set to catch less severe conditions to
generate vmcore. Just before reboot watchdog's timeout is increased
to some good-enough value (3 mins). That keeps watchdog always running
and guarantees that VM doesn't stuck.

Provide new stop_on_reboot module parameter to let user control
watchdog's reboot policy.
