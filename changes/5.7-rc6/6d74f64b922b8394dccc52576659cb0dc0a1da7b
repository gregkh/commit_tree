selftests/bpf: Enforce returning 0 for fentry/fexit programs

There are a few fentry/fexit programs returning non-0.
The tests with these programs will break with the previous
patch which enfoced return-0 rules. Fix them properly.

Fixes: ac065870d928 ("selftests/bpf: Add BPF_PROG, BPF_KPROBE, and BPF_KRETPROBE macros")
