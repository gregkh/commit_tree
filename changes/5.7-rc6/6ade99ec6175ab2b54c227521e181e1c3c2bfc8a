proc: Put thread_pid in release_task not proc_flush_pid

Oleg pointed out that in the unlikely event the kernel is compiled
with CONFIG_PROC_FS unset that release_task will now leak the pid.

Move the put_pid out of proc_flush_pid into release_task to fix this
and to guarantee I don't make that mistake again.

When possible it makes sense to keep get and put in the same function
so it can easily been seen how they pair up.
