octeontx2-pf: Handle VF function level reset

When FLR is initiated for a VF (PCI function level reset),
the parent PF gets a interrupt. PF then sends a message to
admin function (AF), which then cleanups all resources attached
to that VF.

Also handled IRQs triggered when master enable bit is cleared
or set for VFs. This handler just clears the transaction pending
ie TRPEND bit.
