gcc-10 warnings: fix low-hanging fruit

Due to a bug-report that was compiler-dependent, I updated one of my
machines to gcc-10.  That shows a lot of new warnings.  Happily they
seem to be mostly the valid kind, but it's going to cause a round of
churn for getting rid of them..

This is the really low-hanging fruit of removing a couple of zero-sized
arrays in some core code.  We have had a round of these patches before,
and we'll have many more coming, and there is nothing special about
these except that they were particularly trivial, and triggered more
warnings than most.
