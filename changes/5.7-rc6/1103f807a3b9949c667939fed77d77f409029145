mmc: mmci_sdmmc: Add execute tuning with delay block

The hardware delay block is used to align the sampling clock on the data
received by SDMMC. It is mandatory for SDMMC to support the SDR104 mode.
The delay block is used to generate an output clock which is dephased from
the input clock.  The phase of the output clock must be programmed by the
execute tuning interface.
