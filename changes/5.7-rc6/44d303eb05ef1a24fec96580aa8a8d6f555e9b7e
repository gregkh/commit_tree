checkpatch: improve Gerrit Change-Id: test

The Gerrit Change-Id: entry is sometimes placed after a Signed-off-by:
line.  When this occurs, the Gerrit warning is not currently emitted as
the first Signed-off-by: signature sets a flag to stop looking.

Change the test to add a test for the --- patch separator and emit the
warning before any before the --- and also before any diff file name.
