net: drop_monitor: use IS_REACHABLE() to guard net_dm_hw_report()

In net/Kconfig, NET_DEVLINK implies NET_DROP_MONITOR.

The original behavior of the 'imply' keyword prevents NET_DROP_MONITOR
from being 'm' when NET_DEVLINK=y.

With the planned Kconfig change that relaxes the 'imply', the
combination of NET_DEVLINK=y and NET_DROP_MONITOR=m would be allowed.

Use IS_REACHABLE() to avoid the vmlinux link error for this case.
