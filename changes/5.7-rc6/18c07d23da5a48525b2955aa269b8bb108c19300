csky: Fixup calltrace panic

The implementation of show_stack will panic with wrong fp:

addr    = *fp++;

because the fp isn't checked properly.

The current implementations of show_stack, wchan and stack_trace
haven't been designed properly, so just deprecate them.

This patch is a reference to riscv's way, all codes are modified from
arm's. The patch is passed with:

 - cat /proc/<pid>/stack
 - cat /proc/<pid>/wchan
 - echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
