libbpf: Add setter for initial value for internal maps

For internal maps (most notably the maps backing global variables), libbpf
uses an internal mmaped area to store the data after opening the object.
This data is subsequently copied into the kernel map when the object is
loaded.

This adds a function to set a new value for that data, which can be used to
before it is loaded into the kernel. This is especially relevant for RODATA
maps, since those are frozen on load.
