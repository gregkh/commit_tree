remoteproc/omap: Add support to parse internal memories from DT

The OMAP remoteproc driver has been enhanced to parse and store
the kernel mappings for different internal RAM memories that may
be present within each remote processor IP subsystem. Different
devices have varying memories present on current SoCs. The current
support handles the L2RAM for all IPU devices on OMAP4+ SoCs. The
DSPs on OMAP4/OMAP5 only have Unicaches and do not have any L1 or
L2 RAM memories.

IPUs are expected to have the L2RAM at a fixed device address of
0x20000000, based on the current limitations on Attribute MMU
configurations.

NOTE:
The current logic doesn't handle the parsing of memories for DRA7
remoteproc devices, and will be added alongside the DRA7 support.
