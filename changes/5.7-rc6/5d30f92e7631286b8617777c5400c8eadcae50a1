x86/NUMA: Provide a range-to-target_node lookup facility

The DEV_DAX_KMEM facility is a generic mechanism to allow device-dax
instances, fronting performance-differentiated-memory like pmem, to be
added to the System RAM pool. The NUMA node for that hot-added memory is
derived from the device-dax instance's 'target_node' attribute.

Recall that the 'target_node' is the ACPI-PXM-to-node translation for
memory when it comes online whereas the 'numa_node' attribute of the
device represents the closest online cpu node.

Presently useful target_node information from the ACPI SRAT is discarded
with the expectation that "Reserved" memory will never be onlined. Now,
DEV_DAX_KMEM violates that assumption, there is a need to retain the
translation. Move, rather than discard, numa_memblk data to a secondary
array that memory_add_physaddr_to_target_node() may consider at a later
point in time.
