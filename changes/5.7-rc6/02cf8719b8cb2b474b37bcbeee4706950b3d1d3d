mm/page_reporting: rotate reported pages to the tail of the list

Rather than walking over the same pages again and again to get to the
pages that have yet to be reported we can save ourselves a significant
amount of time by simply rotating the list so that when we have a full
list of reported pages the head of the list is pointing to the next
non-reported page.  Doing this should save us some significant time when
processing each free list.

This doesn't gain us much in the standard case as all of the non-reported
pages should be near the top of the list already.  However in the case of
page shuffling this results in a noticeable improvement.  Below are the
will-it-scale page_fault1 w/ THP numbers for 16 tasks with and without
this patch.

Without:
tasks   processes       processes_idle  threads         threads_idle

With:
tasks   processes       processes_idle  threads         threads_idle
16      8283274.75      0.17            5594261.00      38.15
