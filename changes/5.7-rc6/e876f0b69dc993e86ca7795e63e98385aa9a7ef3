lib/vdso: Allow architectures to provide the vdso data pointer

On powerpc, __arch_get_vdso_data() clobbers the link register, requiring
the caller to save it.

As the parent function already has to set a stack frame and saves the link
register before calling the C vdso function, retrieving the vdso data
pointer there is less overhead.

Split out the functional code from the __cvdso.*() interfaces into new
static functions which can either be called from the existing interfaces
with the vdso data pointer supplied via __arch_get_vdso_data() or directly
from ASM code.
