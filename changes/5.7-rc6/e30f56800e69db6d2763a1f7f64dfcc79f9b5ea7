arm64: dts: renesas: Add HiHope RZ/G2M board with idk-1110wr display

The HiHope RZ/G2M is advertised as compatible with panel idk-1110wr
from Advantech, however the panel isn't sold alongside the board.
A new dts, adding everything that's required to get the panel to
work with HiHope RZ/G2M, is the most convenient way to support the
HiHope RZ/G2M when it's connected to the idk-1110wr.
