crypto: ccree - fix retry handling in cc_send_sync_request()

If cc_queues_status() indicates that the queue is full,
cc_send_sync_request() should loop and retry.

However, cc_queues_status() returns either 0 (for success), or -ENOSPC
(for queue full), while cc_send_sync_request() checks for real errors by
comparing with -EAGAIN.  Hence -ENOSPC is always considered a real
error, and the code never retries the operation.

Fix this by just removing the check, as cc_queues_status() never returns
any other error value than -ENOSPC.
