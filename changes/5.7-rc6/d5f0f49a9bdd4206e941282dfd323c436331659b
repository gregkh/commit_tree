xfs: clean up the attr flag confusion

The ATTR_* flags have a long IRIX history, where they a userspace
interface, the on-disk format and an internal interface.  We've split
out the on-disk interface to the XFS_ATTR_* values, but despite (or
because?) of that the flag have still been a mess.  Switch the
internal interface to pass the on-disk XFS_ATTR_* flags for the
namespace and the Linux XATTR_* flags for the actual flags instead.
The ATTR_* values that are actually used are move to xfs_fs.h with a
new XFS_IOC_* prefix to not conflict with the userspace version that
has the same name and must have the same value.
