KVM: VMX: Extend VMXs #AC interceptor to handle split lock #AC in guest

Two types of #AC can be generated in Intel CPUs:
 1. legacy alignment check #AC
 2. split lock #AC

Reflect #AC back into the guest if the guest has legacy alignment checks
enabled or if split lock detection is disabled.

If the #AC is not a legacy one and split lock detection is enabled, then
invoke handle_guest_split_lock() which will either warn and disable split
lock detection for this task or force SIGBUS on it.

[ tglx: Switch it to handle_guest_split_lock() and rename the misnamed
  helper function. ]
