powerpc/pseries/Makefile: Remove CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES check

The pseries Makefile (arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/Makefile) is only
included by the platform Makefile (arch/powerpc/platform/Makefile)
when CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES is selected, so checking for
CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES in the pseries Makefile is pointless.
