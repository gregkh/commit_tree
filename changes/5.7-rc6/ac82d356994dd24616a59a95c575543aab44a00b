efi/libstub/x86: Use ULONG_MAX as upper bound for all allocations

The header flag XLF_CAN_BE_LOADED_ABOVE_4G will inform us whether
allocations above 4 GiB for kernel, command line, etc are permitted,
so we take it into account when calling efi_allocate_pages() etc.

However, CONFIG_EFI_STUB implies CONFIG_RELOCATABLE, and so the flag
is guaranteed to be set on x86_64 builds, whereas i386 builds are
guaranteed to run under firmware that will not allocate above 4 GB
in the first place.

So drop the check, and just pass ULONG_MAX as the upper bound for
all allocations.
