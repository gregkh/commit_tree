staging: rtl8723bs: hal: Remove unnecessary cast on void pointer

Assignment to a typed pointer is sufficient in C.
No cast is needed.

The following Coccinelle script was used to detect this:
@r@
expression x;
void* e;
type T;
identifier f;
@@
(
  *((T *)e)
|
  ((T *)x)[...]
|
  ((T*)x)->f
|

- (T*)
  e
)
