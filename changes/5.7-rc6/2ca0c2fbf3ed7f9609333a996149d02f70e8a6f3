gfs2: drain the ail2 list after io errors

Before this patch, gfs2_logd continually tried to flush its journal
log, after the file system is withdrawn. We don't want to write anything
to the journal, lest we add corruption. Best course of action is to
drain the ail1 into the ail2 list (via gfs2_ail1_empty) then drain the
ail2 list with a new function, ail2_drain.
