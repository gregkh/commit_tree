btrfs: move ino_cache_inode dropping out of btrfs_free_fs_root

We are going to make root life be controlled soley by refcounting, and
inodes will be one of the things that hold a ref on the root.  This
means we need to handle dropping the ino_cache_inode outside of the root
freeing logic, so move it into btrfs_drop_and_free_fs_root() so it is
cleaned up properly on unmount.
