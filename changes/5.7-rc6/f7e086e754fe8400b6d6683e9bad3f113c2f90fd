octeontx2-af: Pause frame configuration at cgx

CGX LMAC, the physical interface can generate pause frames when
internal resources asserts backpressure due to exhaustion.

This patch configures CGX to generate 802.3 pause frames.
Also enabled processing of received pause frames on the line which
will assert backpressure on the internal transmit path.

Also added mailbox handlers for PF drivers to enable or disable
pause frames anytime.
