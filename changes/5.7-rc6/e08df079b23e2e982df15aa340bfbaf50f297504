scripts/decodecode: fix trapping instruction formatting

If the trapping instruction contains a ':', for a memory access through
segment registers for example, the sed substitution will insert the '*'
marker in the middle of the instruction instead of the line address:

	2b:   65 48 0f c7 0f          cmpxchg16b %gs:*(%rdi)          <-- trapping instruction

I started to think I had forgotten some quirk of the assembly syntax
before noticing that it was actually coming from the script.  Fix it to
add the address marker at the right place for these instructions:

	28:   49 8b 06                mov    (%r14),%rax
	2b:*  65 48 0f c7 0f          cmpxchg16b %gs:(%rdi)           <-- trapping instruction
	30:   0f 94 c0                sete   %al
