mac80211: simplify and improve HT/VHT/HE disable code

Check early on that a device has support for QoS (at least 4
queues) when it supports HT/VHT/HE, so we don't have to check
this while connecting.

This lets us clean up the code there: move some of it into
channel preparation to clean up a bit more, and then change
the logic to only check the "wmm_used" flag.

Additionally, disable HE consistently when VHT is disabled.
