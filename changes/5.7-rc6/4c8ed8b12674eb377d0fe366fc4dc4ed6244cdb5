drm/i915/selftests: Exercise timeslice rewinding

Originally, I did not expect having to rewind a context upon
timeslicing: the point was to replace the executing context with a
non-executing one! However, given a second context that depends on
requests from the first, we may have to split the requests along the
first context to execute the second, causing us to partially replay the
first context and so have to rewind its RING_TAIL.
