efi/libstub/arm: Make efi_entry() an ordinary PE/COFF entrypoint

Expose efi_entry() as the PE/COFF entrypoint directly, instead of
jumping into a wrapper that fiddles with stack buffers and other
stuff that the compiler is much better at. The only reason this
code exists is to obtain a pointer to the base of the image, but
we can get the same value from the loaded_image protocol, which
we already need for other reasons anyway.

Update the return type as well, to make it consistent with what
is required for a PE/COFF executable entrypoint.
