x86/Hyper-V: Report crash register data or kmsg before running crash kernel

We want to notify Hyper-V when a Linux guest VM crash occurs, so
there is a record of the crash even when kdump is enabled.   But
crash_kexec_post_notifiers defaults to "false", so the kdump kernel
runs before the notifiers and Hyper-V never gets notified.  Fix this by
always setting crash_kexec_post_notifiers to be true for Hyper-V VMs.

Fixes: 81b18bce48af ("Drivers: HV: Send one page worth of kmsg dump over Hyper-V during panic")
