xfrm: Always set XFRM_TRANSFORMED in xfrm{4,6}_output_finish

IPSKB_XFRM_TRANSFORMED and IP6SKB_XFRM_TRANSFORMED are skb flags set by
xfrm code to tell other skb handlers that the packet has been passed
through the xfrm output functions. Simplify the code and just always
set them rather than conditionally based on netfilter enabled thus
making the flag available for other users.
