locking/rwsem: Remove RWSEM_OWNER_UNKNOWN

Remove the now unused RWSEM_OWNER_UNKNOWN hack. This hack breaks
PREEMPT_RT and getting rid of it was the entire motivation for
re-writing the percpu rwsem.

The biggest problem is that it is fundamentally incompatible with any
form of Priority Inheritance, any exclusively held lock must have a
distinct owner.
