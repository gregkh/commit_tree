scsi: qla2xxx: set UNLOADING before waiting for session deletion

The purpose of the UNLOADING flag is to avoid port login procedures to
continue when a controller is in the process of shutting down.  It makes
sense to set this flag before starting session teardown.

Furthermore, use atomic test_and_set_bit() to avoid the shutdown being run
multiple times in parallel. In qla2x00_disable_board_on_pci_error(), the
test for UNLOADING is postponed until after the check for an already
disabled PCI board.
