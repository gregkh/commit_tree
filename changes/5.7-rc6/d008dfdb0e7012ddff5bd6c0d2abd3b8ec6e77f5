KVM: x86: Move init-only kvm_x86_ops to separate struct

Move the kvm_x86_ops functions that are used only within the scope of
kvm_init() into a separate struct, kvm_x86_init_ops.  In addition to
identifying the init-only functions without restorting to code comments,
this also sets the stage for waiting until after ->hardware_setup() to
set kvm_x86_ops.  Setting kvm_x86_ops after ->hardware_setup() is
desirable as many of the hooks are not usable until ->hardware_setup()
completes.

No functional change intended.
