gfs2: change from write to read lock for sd_log_flush_lock in journal replay

Function gfs2_recover_func grabs the sd_log_flush_lock rw_semaphore in
write mode. This is unnecessary because we only need to prevent log flush
from using sd_log_bio bio while it does. Therefore, a read lock will be
enough. This is a small step in cleaning up log flush.
