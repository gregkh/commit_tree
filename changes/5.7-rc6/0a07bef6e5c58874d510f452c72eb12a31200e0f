Documentation: Better document the softlockup_panic sysctl

Commit 9c44bc03fff4 ("softlockup: allow panic on lockup") added the
softlockup_panic sysctl, but didn't add information about it to the file
Documentation/admin-guide/sysctl/kernel.rst (which in that time certainly
wasn't rst and had other name!).

This patch just adds the respective documentation and references it from
the corresponding entry in Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt.

This patch was strongly based on Scott Wood's commit d22881dc13b6
("Documentation: Better document the hardlockup_panic sysctl").
