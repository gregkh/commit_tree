iommu/virtio: Fix freeing of incomplete domains

Calling viommu_domain_free() on a domain that hasn't been finalised (not
attached to any device, for example) can currently cause an Oops,
because we attempt to call ida_free() on ID 0, which may either be
unallocated or used by another domain.

Only initialise the vdomain->viommu pointer, which denotes a finalised
domain, at the end of a successful viommu_domain_finalise().
