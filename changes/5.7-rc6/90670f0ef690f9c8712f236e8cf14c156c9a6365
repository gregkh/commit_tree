arm64: defconfig: Re-enable Tegra PCIe host driver

Commit c57247f940e8 ("PCI: tegra: Add support for PCIe endpoint mode in
Tegra194") updated the Tegra PCIe Kconfig symbol for building the Tegra
PCIe host controller driver. Following this change the Tegra PCIe host
controller driver is no longer built by default and so no works without
updating the arm64 defconfig. Fix this by updating the Kconfig symbol
in the arm64 for the Tegra PCIe host controller so that again it is
built by default.
