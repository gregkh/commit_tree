mm/mempolicy: Allow lookup_node() to handle fatal signal

lookup_node() uses gup to pin the page and get node information.  It
checks against ret>=0 assuming the page will be filled in.  However it's
also possible that gup will return zero, for example, when the thread is
quickly killed with a fatal signal.  Teach lookup_node() to gracefully
return an error -EFAULT if it happens.

Meanwhile, initialize "page" to NULL to avoid potential risk of
exploiting the pointer.
