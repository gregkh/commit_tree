ASoC: Intel: sof_pcm512x: drop reverse deps for SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI

Having a reverse dependency to a config that has its own additional
dependencies, is generally not recommended. And this applies to
select statements for SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI, e.g. the case where SND_HDA
and SND_SOC_SOF_HDA are built as modules, but the machine driver is
built-in, leading to compile errors (reported as
i386-randconfig-e003-20200206).

Give up on trying to define different dependencies based on SOF/SST
selection, and simply add a "depends on" for SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI. This
fixes the issue with randconfigs. Only downside is that SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI
may be built unnecessarily in some cases, but this seems like the lesser
evil.
