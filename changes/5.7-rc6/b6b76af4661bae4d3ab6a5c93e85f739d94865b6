dt-bindings: sram: qcom: Clean-up 'ranges' and child node names

The regex for child nodes doesn't match the example. This wasn't flagged
with 'additionalProperties: false' missing. The child node schema was also
incorrect with 'ranges' property as it applies to child nodes and should
be moved up to the parent node.
