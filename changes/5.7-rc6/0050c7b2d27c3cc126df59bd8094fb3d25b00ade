locking/rtmutex: rcu: Add WRITE_ONCE() to rt_mutex ->owner

The rt_mutex structure's ->owner field is read locklessly, so this
commit adds the WRITE_ONCE() to an update in order to provide proper
documentation and READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() pairing.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely.
