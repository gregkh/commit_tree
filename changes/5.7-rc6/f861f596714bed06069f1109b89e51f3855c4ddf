scsi: lpfc: Fix lockdep error - register non-static key

The following lockdep error was reported when unloading the lpfc driver:

  INFO: trying to register non-static key.
  the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
  turning off the locking correctness validator.

Unloading the driver resulted in a call to del_timer_sync for the
cpuhp_poll_timer. However the call to setup the timer had never been made,
so the timer structures used by lockdep checking were not initialized.

Unconditionally call setup_timer for the cpuhp_poll_timer during driver
initialization. Calls to start the timer remain "as needed".
