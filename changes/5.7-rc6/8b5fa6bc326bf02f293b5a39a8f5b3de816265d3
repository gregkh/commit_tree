objtool: Optimize read_sections()

Perf showed that __hash_init() is a significant portion of
read_sections(), so instead of doing a per section rela_hash, use an
elf-wide rela_hash.

Statistics show us there are about 1.1 million relas, so size it
accordingly.

This reduces the objtool on vmlinux.o runtime to a third, from 15 to 5
seconds.
