atm: fix a UAF in lec_arp_clear_vccs()

Gengming reported a UAF in lec_arp_clear_vccs(),
where we add a vcc socket to an entry in a per-device
list but free the socket without removing it from the
list when vcc->dev is NULL.

We need to call lec_vcc_close() to search and remove
those entries contain the vcc being destroyed. This can
be done by calling vcc->push(vcc, NULL) unconditionally
in vcc_destroy_socket().

Another issue discovered by Gengming's reproducer is
the vcc->dev may point to the static device lecatm_dev,
for which we don't need to register/unregister device,
so we can just check for vcc->dev->ops->owner.
