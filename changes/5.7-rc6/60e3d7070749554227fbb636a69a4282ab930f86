xfs: support bulk loading of staged btrees

Add a new btree function that enables us to bulk load a btree cursor.
This will be used by the upcoming online repair patches to generate new
btrees.  This avoids the programmatic inefficiency of calling
xfs_btree_insert in a loop (which generates a lot of log traffic) in
favor of stamping out new btree blocks with ordered buffers, and then
committing both the new root and scheduling the removal of the old btree
blocks in a single transaction commit.

The design of this new generic code is based off the btree rebuilding
code in xfs_repair's phase 5 code, with the explicit goal of enabling us
to share that code between scrub and repair.  It has the additional
feature of being able to control btree block loading factors.
