Use ELF_BASE_PLATFORM to pass ISA level

Some userland application/program runtime/dynamic loaded need to
know about the current ISA level to use the best runtime.
While kernel doesn't provides this info.

ELF_PLATFORM only provides some info about the CPU, with very few info,
for example, the value is "mips" for both 24Kc and P6600.

Currently ELF_BASE_PLATFORM is not used by MIPS (only by powerpc).
So we cant set its value as:
  mips2, mips3, mips4, mips5,
  mips32, mips32r2, mips32r6
  mips64, mips64r2, mips64r6
Then in userland, we can get it by:
  getauxval(AT_BASE_PLATFORM)

The only problem is that it seems has different defination than ppc:
  on ppc, it is the mircoarchitecture
while now we use it as ISA level on MIPS.
