btrfs: reloc: reorder reservation before root selection

Since we're not only checking for metadata reservations but also if we
need to throttle our delayed ref generation, reorder
reserve_metadata_space() above the select_one_root() call in
relocate_tree_block().

The reason we want this is because select_reloc_root() will mess with
the backref cache, and if we're going to bail we want to be able to
cleanly remove this node from the backref cache and come back along to
regenerate it.  Move it up so this is the first thing we do to make
restarting cleaner.
