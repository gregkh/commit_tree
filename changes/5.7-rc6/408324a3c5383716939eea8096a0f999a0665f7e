ARM: shmobile: Enable ARM_GLOBAL_TIMER on Cortex-A9 MPCore SoCs

SH-Mobile AG5 and R-Car H1 SoCs are based on the Cortex-A9 MPCore, which
includes a global timer.

Enable the ARM global timer on these SoCs, which will be used for:
  - the scheduler clock, improving scheduler accuracy from 10 ms to 3 or
    4 ns,
  - delay loops, allowing removal of calls to shmobile_init_delay() from
    the corresponding machine vectors.

Note that when using an old DTB lacking the global timer, the kernel
will still work.  However, loops-per-jiffies will no longer be preset,
and the delay loop will need to be calibrated during boot.
