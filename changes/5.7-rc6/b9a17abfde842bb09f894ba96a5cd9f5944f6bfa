devlink: implement DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_NEW

Implement support for the DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_NEW command for creating
snapshots. This new command parallels the existing
DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_DEL.

In order for DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_NEW to work for a region, the new
".snapshot" operation must be implemented in the region's ops structure.

The desired snapshot id must be provided. This helps avoid confusion on
the purpose of DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_NEW, and keeps the API simpler.

The requested id will be inserted into the xarray tracking the number of
snapshots using each id. If this id is already used by another snapshot
on any region, an error will be returned.
