kbuild: Always validate DT binding examples

Most folks only run dt_binding_check on the single schema they care about
by setting DT_SCHEMA_FILES. That means example is only checked against
that one schema which is not always sufficient.

Let's address this by splitting processed-schema.yaml into 2 files: one
that's always all schemas for the examples and one that's just the schema
in DT_SCHEMA_FILES for dtbs.
