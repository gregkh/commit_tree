x86: remove always-defined CONFIG_AS_SSSE3

CONFIG_AS_SSSE3 was introduced by commit 75aaf4c3e6a4 ("x86/raid6:
correctly check for assembler capabilities").

We raise the minimal supported binutils version from time to time.
The last bump was commit 1fb12b35e5ff ("kbuild: Raise the minimum
required binutils version to 2.21").

I confirmed the code in $(call as-instr,...) can be assembled by the
binutils 2.21 assembler and also by LLVM integrated assembler.

Remove CONFIG_AS_SSSE3, which is always defined.

I added ifdef CONFIG_X86 to lib/raid6/algos.c to avoid link errors
on non-x86 architectures.

lib/raid6/algos.c is built not only for the kernel but also for
testing the library code from userspace. I added -DCONFIG_X86 to
lib/raid6/test/Makefile to cator to this usecase.
