bpf: Add tests for bpf_sk_storage to bpf_tcp_ca

This patch adds test to exercise the bpf_sk_storage_get()
and bpf_sk_storage_delete() helper from the bpf_dctcp.c.

The setup and check on the sk_storage is done immediately
before and after the connect().

This patch also takes this chance to move the pthread_create()
after the connect() has been done.  That will remove the need of
the "wait_thread" label.
