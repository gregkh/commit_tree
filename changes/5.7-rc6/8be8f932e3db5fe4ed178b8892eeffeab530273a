kvm: ioapic: Restrict lazy EOI update to edge-triggered interrupts

Commit f458d039db7e ("kvm: ioapic: Lazy update IOAPIC EOI") introduces
the following infinite loop:

The re-entrancy happens because the irq state is the OR of
the interrupt state and the resamplefd state.  That is, we don't
want to show the state as 0 until we've had a chance to set the
resamplefd.  But if the interrupt has _not_ gone low then
ioapic_set_irq is invoked again, causing an infinite loop.

This can only happen for a level-triggered interrupt, otherwise
irqfd_inject would immediately set the KVM_USERSPACE_IRQ_SOURCE_ID high
and then low.  Fortunately, in the case of level-triggered interrupts the VMEXIT already happens because
TMR is set.  Thus, fix the bug by restricting the lazy invocation
of the ack notifier to edge-triggered interrupts, the only ones that
need it.
