mdio_bus: Add generic mdio_find_bus()

It appears most ethernet drivers follow one of two main strategies
for mdio bus/phy management. A monolithic model where the net driver
itself creates, probes and uses the phy, and one where an external
mdio/phy driver instantiates the mdio bus/phy and the net driver
only attaches to a known phy. Usually in this latter model the phys
are discovered via DT relationships or simply phy name/address
hardcoding.

This is a shame because modern well behaved mdio buses are self
describing and can be probed. The mdio layer itself is fully capable
of this, yet there isn't a clean way for a standalone net driver
to attach and enumerate the discovered devices. This is because
outside of of_mdio_find_bus() there isn't a straightforward way
to acquire the mii_bus pointer.

So, lets add a mdio_find_bus which can return the mii_bus based
only on its name.
