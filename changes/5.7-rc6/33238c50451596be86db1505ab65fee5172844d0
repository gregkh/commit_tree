perf/core: Fix event cgroup tracking

Song reports that installing cgroup events is broken since:

  db0503e4f675 ("perf/core: Optimize perf_install_in_event()")

The problem being that cgroup events try to track cpuctx->cgrp even
for disabled events, which is pointless and actively harmful since the
above commit. Rework the code to have explicit enable/disable hooks
for cgroup events, such that we can limit cgroup tracking to active
events.

More specifically, since the above commit disabled events are no
longer added to their context from the 'right' CPU, and we can't
access things like the current cgroup for a remote CPU.
