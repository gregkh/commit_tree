docs: filesystems: convert proc.txt to ReST

This document has a nice format! Unfortunately, not exactly
ReST. So, several adjustments were required:

- Add a SPDX header;
- Adjust document and section titles;
- Whitespace fixes and new line breaks;
- Mark literal blocks as such;
- Add table markups;
- Add table captions;
- Add it to filesystems/index.rst.
