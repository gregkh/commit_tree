scsi: ibmvfc: Don't send implicit logouts prior to NPIV login

Commit ed830385a2b1 ("scsi: ibmvfc: Avoid loss of all paths during SVC node
reboot") introduced a regression where when the client resets or re-enables
its CRQ with the hypervisor there is a chance that if the server side
doesn't issue its INIT handshake quick enough the client can issue an
Implicit Logout prior to doing an NPIV Login. The server treats this
scenario as a protocol violation and closes the CRQ on its end forcing the
client through a reset that gets the client host state and next host action
out of agreement leading to a BUG assert.

This scenario can be prevented by rejecting any attempt to send an Implicit
Logout if the client adapter is not logged in yet.
