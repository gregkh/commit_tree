Revert "drm/i915: Don't use VBT for detecting DPCD backlight controls"

This reverts commit d2a4bb6f8bc8cf2d788adf7e59b5b52fe3a3333c.

So, turns out that this ended up just breaking things. While many
laptops incorrectly advertise themselves as supporting PWM backlight
controls, they actually will only work with DPCD backlight controls.
Unfortunately, it also seems there are a number of systems which
advertise DPCD backlight controls in their eDP DPCD but don't actually
support them. Talking with some laptop manufacturers has shown it might
be possible to probe this support via the EDID (!?!?) but I haven't been
able to confirm that this would work on any other manufacturer's
systems.

So in the mean time, we'll just revert this commit for now and go back
to the old way of doing things.
