x86/vmware: Add steal time clock support for VMware guests

Steal time is the amount of CPU time needed by a guest virtual machine
that is not provided by the host. Steal time occurs when the host
allocates this CPU time elsewhere, for example, to another guest.

Steal time can be enabled by adding the VM configuration option
stealclock.enable = "TRUE". It is supported by VMs that run hardware
version 13 or newer.

Introduce the VMware steal time infrastructure. The high level code
(such as enabling, disabling and hot-plug routines) was derived from KVM.

 [ Tomer: use READ_ONCE macros and 32bit guests support. ]
