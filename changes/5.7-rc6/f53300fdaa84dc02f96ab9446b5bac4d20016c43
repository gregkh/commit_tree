mt76: mt7615: Fix build with older compilers

Some compilers (tested with 4.8.5 from CentOS 7) fail properly process
FIELD_GET inside an inline function, which ends up in a BUILD_BUG_ON.
Convert inline function to a macro.

Fixes commit bf92e7685100 ("mt76: mt7615: add support for per-chain
signal strength reporting")
