mm/page-writeback.c: write_cache_pages(): deduplicate identical checks

There used to be a 'retry' label in between the two (identical) checks
when first introduced in commit f446daaea9d4 ("mm: implement writeback
livelock avoidance using page tagging"), and later modified/updated in
commit 6e6938b6d313 ("writeback: introduce .tagged_writepages for the
WB_SYNC_NONE sync stage").

The label has been removed in commit 64081362e8ff ("mm/page-writeback.c:
fix range_cyclic writeback vs writepages deadlock"), and the (identical)
checks are now present / performed immediately one after another.

So, remove/deduplicate the latter check, moving tag_pages_for_writeback()
into the former check before the 'tag' variable assignment, so it's clear
that it's not used in this (similarly-named) function call but only later
in pagevec_lookup_range_tag().
