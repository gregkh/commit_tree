bpf: Fix bug in mmap() implementation for BPF array map

mmap() subsystem allows user-space application to memory-map region with
initial page offset. This wasn't taken into account in initial implementation
of BPF array memory-mapping. This would result in wrong pages, not taking into
account requested page shift, being memory-mmaped into user-space. This patch
fixes this gap and adds a test for such scenario.
