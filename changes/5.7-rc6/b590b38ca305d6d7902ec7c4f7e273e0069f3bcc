ALSA: hda/realtek - Limit int mic boost for Thinkpad T530

Lenovo Thinkpad T530 seems to have a sensitive internal mic capture
that needs to limit the mic boost like a few other Thinkpad models.
Although we may change the quirk for ALC269_FIXUP_LENOVO_DOCK, this
hits way too many other laptop models, so let's add a new fixup model
that limits the internal mic boost on top of the existing quirk and
apply to only T530.
