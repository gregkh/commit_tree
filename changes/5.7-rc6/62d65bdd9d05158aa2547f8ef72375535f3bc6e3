USB: cdc-acm: restore capability check order

commit b401f8c4f492c ("USB: cdc-acm: fix rounding error in TIOCSSERIAL")
introduced a regression by changing the order of capability and close
settings change checks. When running with CAP_SYS_ADMIN setting the
close settings to the values already set resulted in -EOPNOTSUPP.

Fix this by changing the check order back to how it was before.
