KVM: x86: rename set_cr3 callback and related flags to load_mmu_pgd

The set_cr3 callback is not setting the guest CR3, it is setting the
root of the guest page tables, either shadow or two-dimensional.
To make this clearer as well as to indicate that the MMU calls it
via kvm_mmu_load_cr3, rename it to load_mmu_pgd.
