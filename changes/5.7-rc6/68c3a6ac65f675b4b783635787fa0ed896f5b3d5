drivers/base/memory.c: drop section_count

Patch series "mm: drop superfluous section checks when onlining/offlining".

Let's drop some superfluous section checks on the onlining/offlining path.

This patch (of 3):

Since commit c5e79ef561b0 ("mm/memory_hotplug.c: don't allow to
online/offline memory blocks with holes") we have a generic check in
offline_pages() that disallows offlining memory blocks with holes.

Memory blocks with missing sections are just another variant of these type
of blocks.  We can stop checking (and especially storing) present
sections.  A proper error message is now printed why offlining failed.

section_count was initially introduced in commit 07681215975e ("Driver
core: Add section count to memory_block struct") in order to detect when
it is okay to remove a memory block.  It was used in commit 26bbe7ef6d5c
("drivers/base/memory.c: prohibit offlining of memory blocks with missing
sections") to disallow offlining memory blocks with missing sections.  As
we refactored creation/removal of memory devices and have a proper check
for holes in place, we can drop the section_count.

This also removes a leftover comment regarding the mem_sysfs_mutex, which
was removed in commit 848e19ad3c33 ("drivers/base/memory.c: drop the
mem_sysfs_mutex").
