PCI: pciehp: Add DMI table for in-band presence detection disabled

Some systems have in-band presence detection disabled for hot-plug PCI
slots but do not report this in the slot capabilities 2 (SLTCAP2) register.
On these systems, presence detect can become active well after the link is
reported to be active, which can cause the slots to be disabled after a
device is connected.

Add a DMI table to flag these systems as having in-band presence detect
disabled.
