i40iw: fix null pointer dereference on a null wqe pointer

Currently the null check for wqe is incorrect and lets a null wqe
be passed to set_64bit_val and this indexes into the null pointer
causing a null pointer dereference.  Fix this by fixing the null
pointer check to return an error if wqe is null.
