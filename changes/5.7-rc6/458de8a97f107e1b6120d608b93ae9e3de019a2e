net: page_pool: API cleanup and comments

Functions starting with __ usually indicate those which are exported,
but should not be called directly. Update some of those declared in the
API and make it more readable.

page_pool_unmap_page() and page_pool_release_page() were doing
exactly the same thing calling __page_pool_clean_page().  Let's
rename __page_pool_clean_page() to page_pool_release_page() and
export it in order to show up on perf logs and get rid of
page_pool_unmap_page().

Finally rename __page_pool_put_page() to page_pool_put_page() since we
can now directly call it from drivers and rename the existing
page_pool_put_page() to page_pool_put_full_page() since they do the same
thing but the latter is trying to sync the full DMA area.

This patch also updates netsec, mvneta and stmmac drivers which use
those functions.
