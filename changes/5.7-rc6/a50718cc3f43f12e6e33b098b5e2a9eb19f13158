KVM: nSVM: Expose SVM features to L1 iff nested is enabled

Set SVM feature bits in KVM capabilities if and only if nested=true, KVM
shouldn't advertise features that realistically can't be used.  Use
kvm_cpu_cap_has(X86_FEATURE_SVM) to indirectly query "nested" in
svm_set_supported_cpuid() in anticipation of moving CPUID 0x8000000A
adjustments into common x86 code.
