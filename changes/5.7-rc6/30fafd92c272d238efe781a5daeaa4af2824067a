n_hdlc: simplify freeing of buffer list

n_hdlc_release contains four loops to free each buffer list. Create a
helper (n_hdlc_free_buf_list) and call it for every list instead. It
makes n_hdlc_release more readable.

We are switching from "for (;;)" to "do {} while (buf)" which avoids the
"if (buf)" completely -- kfree is a nop for NULL pointers.
