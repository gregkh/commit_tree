iwlwifi: convert all Qu with Jf devices to the new config table

Add new generic iwl_trans structures for these devices and apply the
correct cfg depending on the device characteristics.

Since we have to match Qu with IWL_CONFIG_ANY, we also need to move
the Hr devices to the new table, but for now we keep matching on PCI
device and subsystem device IDs.
