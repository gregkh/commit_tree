net: sched: refactor police action helpers to require tcf_lock

In order to remove rtnl lock dependency from flow_action representation
translator, change rcu_dereference_bh_rtnl() to rcu_dereference_protected()
in police action helpers that provide external access to rate and burst
values. This is safe to do because the functions are not called from
anywhere else outside flow_action infrastructure which was modified to
obtain tcf_lock when accessing action data in one of previous patches in
the series.
