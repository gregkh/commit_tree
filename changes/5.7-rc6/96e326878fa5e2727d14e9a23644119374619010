net/mlx5e: Eswitch, Use per vport tables for mirroring

When using port mirroring, we forward the traffic to another table and
use that table to forward to the mirrored vport. Since the hardware
loses the values of reg c, and in particular reg c0, we fail the match
on the input vport which previously existed in reg c0. To overcome this
situation, we use a set of per vport tables, positioned at the lowest
priority, and forward traffic to those tables. Since these tables are
per vport, we can avoid matching on reg c0.
