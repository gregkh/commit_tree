rcu: Add missing annotation for exit_tasks_rcu_finish()

Sparse reports a warning at exit_tasks_rcu_finish(void)

|warning: context imbalance in exit_tasks_rcu_finish()
|- wrong count at exit

To fix this, this commit adds a __releases(&tasks_rcu_exit_srcu).
Given that exit_tasks_rcu_finish() does actually call __srcu_read_lock(),
this not only fixes the warning but also improves on the readability of
the code.
