non-RCU analogue of the previous commit

new helper: choose_mountpoint().  Wrapper around choose_mountpoint_rcu(),
similar to lookup_mnt() vs. __lookup_mnt().  follow_dotdot() switched to
it.  Now we don't grab mount_lock exclusive anymore; note that the
primitive used non-RCU mount traversals in other direction (lookup_mnt())
doesn't bother with that either - it uses mount_lock seqcount instead.
