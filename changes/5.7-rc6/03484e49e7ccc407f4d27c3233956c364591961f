mlxsw: spectrum: Track used packet trap policer IDs

During initialization the driver configures various packet trap groups
and binds policers to them.

Currently, most of these groups are not exposed to user space and
therefore their policers should not be exposed as well. Otherwise, user
space will be able to alter policer parameters without knowing which
packet traps are policed by the policer.

Use a bitmap to track the used policer IDs so that these policers will
not be registered with devlink in a subsequent patch.
