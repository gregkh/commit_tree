KVM: arm64: PSCI: Forbid 64bit functions for 32bit guests

Implementing (and even advertising) 64bit PSCI functions to 32bit
guests is at least a bit odd, if not altogether violating the
spec which says ("5.2.1 Register usage in arguments and return values"):

"Adherence to the SMC Calling Conventions implies that any AArch32
caller of an SMC64 function will get a return code of 0xFFFFFFFF(int32).
This matches the NOT_SUPPORTED error code used in PSCI"

Tighten the implementation by pretending these functions are not
there for 32bit guests.
