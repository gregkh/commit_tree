drm/i915/perf: Mark up the racy use of perf->exclusive_stream

Inside the general i915_oa_init_reg_state() we avoid using the
perf->mutex. However, we rely on perf->exclusive_stream being valid to
access at that point, and for that we have to control the race with
disabling perf. This relies on the disabling being a heavy barrier that
inspects all active contexts, after marking the perf->exclusive_stream
as not available. This should ensure that there are no more concurrent
accesses to the perf->exclusive_stream as we destroy it.

Mark up the races around the perf->exclusive_stream so that they stand
out much more. (And hopefully we will be running kcsan to start
validating that the only races we have are carefully controlled.)
