brcmfmac: add the BRCM 4364 found in MacBook Pro 15,2

The 2018 13" MacBook Pro (MacBookPro15,2) has a Broadcom chip, the 4364.
This chip appears to be specific to Apple and is not found in other
hardware.

Add this chip to the brcmfmac driver so that it can be recognized
automatically.  Note that the PCI device id is 4464 even though the chip
is referred to as the 4364.
