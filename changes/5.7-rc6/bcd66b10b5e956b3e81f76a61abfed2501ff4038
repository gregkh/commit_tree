tools/bpf: Move linux/types.h for selftests and bpftool

Commit fe4eb069edb7 ("bpftool: Use linux/types.h from source tree for
profiler build") added a build dependency on tools/testing/selftests/bpf
to tools/bpf/bpftool. This is suboptimal with respect to a possible
stand-alone build of bpftool.

Fix this by moving tools/testing/selftests/bpf/include/uapi/linux/types.h
to tools/include/uapi/linux/types.h.

This requires an adjustment in the include search path order for the
tests in tools/testing/selftests/bpf so that tools/include/linux/types.h
is selected when building host binaries and
tools/include/uapi/linux/types.h is selected when building bpf binaries.

Verified by compiling bpftool and the bpf selftests on x86_64 with this
change.
