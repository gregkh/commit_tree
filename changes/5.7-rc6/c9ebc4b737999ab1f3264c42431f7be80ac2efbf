gfs2: allow journal replay to hold sd_log_flush_lock

Before this patch, journal replays could stomp on log flushes
and each other because both log flushes and journal replays used
the same sd_log_bio. Function gfs2_log_flush prevents other log
flushes from interfering by taking the sd_log_flush_lock rwsem
during the flush. However, it does not protect against journal
replays. This patch allows the journal replay to take the same
sd_log_flush_lock rwsem so use of the sd_log_bio is not stomped.
