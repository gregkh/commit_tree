media: dt-bindings: Add binding for rk3228 rga

Indicate that the rk3228 rga is compatible with that of the rk3288.

But if any rk3228-specific quirks are identified in future that
require handling logic that differs from what is provided for the
rk3288, then allow for the compatibility string "rockchip,rk3228-rga"
to be matched instead of "rockchip,rk3288-rga".
