ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Fix Ursa board Ethernet connection

The Y Soft yapp4 platform supports up to two Ethernet ports.
The Ursa board though has only one Ethernet port populated and that is
the port@2. Since the introduction of this platform into mainline a wrong
port was deleted and the Ethernet could never work. Fix this by deleting
the correct port node.
