ipmr: Add lockdep expression to ipmr_for_each_table macro

During the initialization process, ipmr_new_table() is called
to create new tables which in turn calls ipmr_get_table() which
traverses net->ipv4.mr_tables without holding the writer lock.
However, this is safe to do so as no tables exist at this time.
Hence add a suitable lockdep expression to silence the following
false-positive warning:
