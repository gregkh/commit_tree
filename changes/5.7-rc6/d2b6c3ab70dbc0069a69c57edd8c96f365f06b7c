bpf, selftests: Add test for BPF_STX BPF_B storing R10

This patch adds a test to test_verifier that writes the lower 8 bits of
R10 (aka FP) using BPF_B to an array map and reads the result back. The
expected behavior is that the result should be the same as first copying
R10 to R9, and then storing / loading the lower 8 bits of R9.

This test catches a bug that was present in the x86-64 JIT that caused
an incorrect encoding for BPF_STX BPF_B when the source operand is R10.
