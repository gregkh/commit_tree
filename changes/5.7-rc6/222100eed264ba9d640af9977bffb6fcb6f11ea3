mm/vma: make is_vma_temporary_stack() available for general use

Currently the declaration and definition for is_vma_temporary_stack() are
scattered.  Lets make is_vma_temporary_stack() helper available for
general use and also drop the declaration from (include/linux/huge_mm.h)
which is no longer required.  While at this, rename this as
vma_is_temporary_stack() in line with existing helpers.  This should not
cause any functional change.
