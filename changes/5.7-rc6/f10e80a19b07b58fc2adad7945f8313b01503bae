efi/x86: Add TPM related EFI tables to unencrypted mapping checks

When booting with SME active, EFI tables must be mapped unencrypted since
they were built by UEFI in unencrypted memory. Update the list of tables
to be checked during early_memremap() processing to account for the EFI
TPM tables.

This fixes a bug where an EFI TPM log table has been created by UEFI, but
it lives in memory that has been marked as usable rather than reserved.
