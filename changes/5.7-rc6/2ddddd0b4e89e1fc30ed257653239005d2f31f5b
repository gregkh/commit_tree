Drivers: hv: Move AEOI determination to architecture dependent code

Hyper-V on ARM64 doesn't provide a flag for the AEOI recommendation
in ms_hyperv.hints, so having the test in architecture independent
code doesn't work. Resolve this by moving the check of the flag
to an architecture dependent helper function. No functionality is
changed.
