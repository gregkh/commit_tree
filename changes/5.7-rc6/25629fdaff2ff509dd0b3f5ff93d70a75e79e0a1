net, ip_tunnel: fix interface lookup with no key

when creating a new ipip interface with no local/remote configuration,
the lookup is done with TUNNEL_NO_KEY flag, making it impossible to
match the new interface (only possible match being fallback or metada
case interface); e.g: `ip link add tunl1 type ipip dev eth0`

To fix this case, adding a flag check before the key comparison so we
permit to match an interface with no local/remote config; it also avoids
breaking possible userland tools relying on TUNNEL_NO_KEY flag and
uninitialised key.

context being on my side, I'm creating an extra ipip interface attached
to the physical one, and moving it to a dedicated namespace.
