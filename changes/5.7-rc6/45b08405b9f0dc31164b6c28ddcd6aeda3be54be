btrfs: remove extent_page_data::tree

All functions that set up extent_page_data::tree set it to the inode
io_tree. That's passed down the callstack that accesses either the same
inode or its pages. In the end submit_extent_page can pull the tree out
of the page and we don't have to store it in the structure.
