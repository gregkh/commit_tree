ibmvnic: Skip fatal error reset after passive init

During MTU change, the following events may happen.
Client-driven CRQ initialization fails due to partnerâ€™s CRQ closed,
causing client to enqueue a reset task for FATAL_ERROR. Then passive
(server-driven) CRQ initialization succeeds, causing client to
release CRQ and enqueue a reset task for failover. If the passive
CRQ initialization occurs before the FATAL reset task is processed,
the FATAL error reset task would try to access a CRQ message queue
that was freed, causing an oops. The problem may be most likely to
occur during DLPAR add vNIC with a non-default MTU, because the DLPAR
process will automatically issue a change MTU request.

Fix this by not processing fatal error reset if CRQ is passively
initialized after client-driven CRQ initialization fails.
