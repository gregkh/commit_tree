IB/hfi1: Call kobject_put() when kobject_init_and_add() fails

When kobject_init_and_add() returns an error in the function
hfi1_create_port_files(), the function kobject_put() is not called for the
corresponding kobject, which potentially leads to memory leak.

This patch fixes the issue by calling kobject_put() even if
kobject_init_and_add() fails.
