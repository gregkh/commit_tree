netfilter: flowtable: Add pending bit for offload work

Gc step can queue offloaded flow del work or stats work.
Those work items can race each other and a flow could be freed
before the stats work is executed and querying it.
To avoid that, add a pending bit that if a work exists for a flow
don't queue another work for it.
This will also avoid adding multiple stats works in case stats work
didn't complete but gc step started again.
