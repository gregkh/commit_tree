drm/amd/display: update scaling filters

Currently there is a minor error in scaling filter coefficients
caused by truncation to fit the HW registers.This error accummulates
with increased taps, but has gone unnoticed due to vast majority of
scaling being done with only 4 taps.

Scaling filters are now updated using HW team's filter generator
which has quantization error minimization built in.
