cifs: plumb smb2 POSIX dir enumeration

* add code to request POSIX info level
* parse dir entries and fill cifs_fattr to get correct inode data

since the POSIX payload is variable size the number of entries in a
FIND response needs to be computed differently.

Dirs and regular files are properly reported along with mode bits,
hardlink number, c/m/atime. No special files yet (see below).

Current experimental version of Samba with the extension unfortunately
has issues with wildcards and needs the following patch:

> --- i/source3/smbd/smb2_query_directory.c
> +++ w/source3/smbd/smb2_query_directory.c
> @@ -397,9 +397,7 @@ smbd_smb2_query_directory_send(TALLOC_CTX
> *mem_ctx,
> 		}
> 	}
>
> -       if (!state->smbreq->posix_pathnames) {
> 		wcard_has_wild = ms_has_wild(state->in_file_name);
> -       }
>
> 	/* Ensure we've canonicalized any search path if not a wildcard. */
> 	if (!wcard_has_wild) {
>

Also for special files despite reporting them as reparse point samba
doesn't set the reparse tag field. This patch will mark them as needing
re-evaluation but the re-evaluate code doesn't deal with it yet.
