KVM: x86: Clean up error handling in kvm_dev_ioctl_get_cpuid()

Clean up the error handling in kvm_dev_ioctl_get_cpuid(), which has
gotten a bit crusty as the function has evolved over the years.

Opportunistically hoist the static @funcs declaration to the top of the
function to make it more obvious that it's a "static const".

No functional change intended.
