bpf: Test_progs, add test to catch retval refine error handling

Before this series the verifier would clamp return bounds of
bpf_get_stack() to [0, X] and this led the verifier to believe
that a JMP_JSLT 0 would be false and so would prune that path.

The result is anything hidden behind that JSLT would be unverified.
Add a test to catch this case by hiding an goto pc-1 behind the
check which will cause an infinite loop if not rejected.
