cifs: rename posix create rsp

little progress on the posix create response.

* rename struct to create_posix_rsp to match with the request
  create_posix context
* make struct packed
* pass smb info struct for parse_posix_ctxt to fill
* use smb info struct as param
* update TODO

What needs to be done:

SMB2_open() has an optional smb info out argument that it will fill.
Callers making use of this are:

- smb3_query_mf_symlink (need to investigate)
- smb2_open_file

Callers of smb2_open_file (via server->ops->open) are passing an
smbinfo struct but that struct cannot hold POSIX information. All the
call stack needs to be changed for a different info type. Maybe pass
SMB generic struct like cifs_fattr instead.
