IB/mlx5: Replace tunnel mpls capability bits for tunnel_offloads

Until now the flex parser capability was used in ib_query_device() to
indicate tunnel_offloads_caps support for mpls_over_gre/mpls_over_udp.

Newer devices and firmware will have configurations with the flexparser
but without mpls support.

Testing for the flex parser capability was a mistake, the tunnel_stateless
capability was intended for detecting mpls and was introduced at the same
time as the flex parser capability.

Otherwise userspace will be incorrectly informed that a future device
supports MPLS when it does not.
