KVM: s390: add new variants of UV CALL

This adds two new helper functions for doing UV CALLs.

The first variant handles UV CALLs that might have longer busy
conditions or just need longer when doing partial completion. We should
schedule when necessary.

The second variant handles UV CALLs that only need the handle but have
no payload (e.g. destroying a VM). We can provide a simple wrapper for
those.
