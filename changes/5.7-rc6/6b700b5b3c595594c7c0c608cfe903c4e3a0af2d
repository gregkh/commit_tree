mm/vmscan.c: remove cpu online notification for now

kswapd kernel thread starts either with a CPU affinity set to the full cpu
mask of its target node or without any affinity at all if the node is
CPUless.  There is a cpu hotplug callback (kswapd_cpu_online) that
implements an elaborate way to update this mask when a cpu is onlined.

It is not really clear whether there is any actual benefit from this
scheme. Completely CPU-less NUMA nodes rarely gain a new CPU during
runtime. Drop the code for that reason. If there is a real usecase then
we can resurrect and simplify the code.
