media: tvp5150: make debug output more readable

The debug output for tvp5150_selmux() isn't really intuitive. Register
values are printed decimal formatted and the input/output driver states
are printed as enum. Even more the "normal" output enum mapps to zero so
a active output will printing output=0 and a inactive output=1.

Change this by brinting the register values hex formatted and the states
as more readable string.
