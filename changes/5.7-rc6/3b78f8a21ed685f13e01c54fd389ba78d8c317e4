media: allegro: verify source and destination buffer in VCU response

The PUT_STREAM_BUFFER and ENCODE_FRAME request have fields that allow to
pass arbitrary 64 bit values through the firmware to the ENCODE_FRAME
response. Use these values to verify that the buffers when finishing the
frame are actually the same buffers that have been sent for encoding a
frame.
