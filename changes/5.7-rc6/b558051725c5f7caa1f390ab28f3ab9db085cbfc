linux/elfnote.h: Replace elf.h with UAPI equivalent

The vDSO library should only include the necessary headers required for
a userspace library (UAPI and a minimal set of kernel headers). To make
this possible it is necessary to isolate from the kernel headers the
common parts that are strictly necessary to build the library.

Replace linux/elf.h with UAPI equivalent in elfnote.h to make the header
suitable for vDSO inclusion.
