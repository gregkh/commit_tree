net/mlx5: Avoid deriving mlx5_core_dev second time

All callers needs to work on mlx5_core_dev and it is already derived
before calling mlx5_devlink_eswitch_check().
Hence, accept mlx5_core_dev in mlx5_devlink_eswitch_check().

Given that it works on mlx5_core_dev change helper function name to
drop devlink prefix.
