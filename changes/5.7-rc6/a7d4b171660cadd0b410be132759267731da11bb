Input: goodix - add support for getting IRQ + reset GPIOs on Cherry Trail devices

On most Cherry Trail (x86, UEFI + ACPI) devices the ACPI tables do not have
a _DSD with a "daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301" UUID, adding
"irq-gpios" and "reset-gpios" mappings, so we cannot get the GPIOS by name
without first manually adding mappings ourselves.

These devices contain 1 GpioInt and 1 GpioIo resource in their _CRS table:

Method (_CRS, 0, NotSerialized)  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
{
    Name (RBUF, ResourceTemplate ()
    {
        I2cSerialBusV2 (0x0014, ControllerInitiated, 0x00061A80,
            AddressingMode7Bit, "\\_SB.PCI0.I2C2",
            0x00, ResourceConsumer, , Exclusive,
            )
        GpioInt (Edge, ActiveLow, Shared, PullDefault, 0x0000,
            "\\_SB.GPO1", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,
            )
            {   // Pin list
                0x0013
            }
        GpioIo (Shared, PullDefault, 0x0000, 0x0000,
            IoRestrictionOutputOnly,
            "\\_SB.GPO1", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,
            )
            {   // Pin list
                0x0019
            }
    })
    Return (RBUF) /* \_SB_.PCI0.I2C2.TCS1._CRS.RBUF */
}

There is no fixed order for these 2. This commit adds code to check that
there is 1 of each as expected and then registers a mapping matching their
order using devm_acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios().

This gives us access to both GPIOs allowing us to properly suspend the
controller during suspend, and making it possible to reset the controller
if necessary.
