selftests/bpf: Guarantee that useep() calls nanosleep() syscall

Some implementations of C runtime library won't call nanosleep() syscall from
usleep(). But a bunch of kprobe/tracepoint selftests rely on nanosleep being
called to trigger them. To make this more reliable, "override" usleep
implementation and call nanosleep explicitly.
