ALSA: hda/realtek - Add quirk for Lenovo Carbon X1 8th gen

The audio setup on the Lenovo Carbon X1 8th gen is the same as that on
the Lenovo Carbon X1 7th gen, as such it needs the same
ALC285_FIXUP_THINKPAD_HEADSET_JACK quirk.

This fixes volume control of the speaker not working among other things.
