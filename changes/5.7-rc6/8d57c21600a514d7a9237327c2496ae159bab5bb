xfs: add a function to deal with corrupt buffers post-verifiers

Add a helper function to get rid of buffers that we have decided are
corrupt after the verifiers have run.  This function is intended to
handle metadata checks that can't happen in the verifiers, such as
inter-block relationship checking.  Note that we now mark the buffer
stale so that it will not end up on any LRU and will be purged on
release.
