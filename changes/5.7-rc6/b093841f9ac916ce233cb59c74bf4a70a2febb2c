ice: Refactor port vlan configuration for the VF

Currently ice_vsi_manage_pvid() calls
ice_vsi_[set|kill]_pvid_fill_ctxt() when enabling/disabling a port VLAN
on a VSI respectively. These two functions have some duplication so just
move their unique pieces inline in ice_vsi_manage_pvid() and then the
duplicate code can be reused for both the enabling/disabling paths.

Before this patch the info.pvid field was not being written
correctly via ice_vsi_kill_pvid_fill_ctxt() so it was being hard coded
to 0 in ice_set_vf_port_vlan(). Fix this by setting the info.pvid field
to 0 before calling ice_vsi_update() in ice_vsi_manage_pvid().

We currently use vf->port_vlan_id to keep track of the port VLAN
ID and QoS, which is a bit misleading. Fix this by renaming it to
vf->port_vlan_info. Also change the name of the argument for
ice_vsi_manage_pvid() from vid to pvid_info.

In ice_vsi_manage_pvid() only save the fields that were modified
in the VSI properties structure on success instead of the entire thing.
