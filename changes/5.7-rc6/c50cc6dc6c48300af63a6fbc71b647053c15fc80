media: venus: hfi_parser: Ignore HEVC encoding for V1

Some older MSM8916 Venus firmware versions also seem to indicate
support for encoding HEVC, even though they really can't.
This will lead to errors later because hfi_session_init() fails
in this case.

HEVC is already ignored for "dec_codecs", so add the same for
"enc_codecs" to make these old firmware versions work correctly.
