KVM: X86: Declare KVM_CAP_SET_GUEST_DEBUG properly

KVM_CAP_SET_GUEST_DEBUG should be supported for x86 however it's not declared
as supported.  My wild guess is that userspaces like QEMU are using "#ifdef
KVM_CAP_SET_GUEST_DEBUG" to check for the capability instead, but that could be
wrong because the compilation host may not be the runtime host.

The userspace might still want to keep the old "#ifdef" though to not break the
guest debug on old kernels.
