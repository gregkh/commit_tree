sched/fair: Optimize select_idle_core()

Currently we loop through all threads of a core to evaluate if the core is
idle or not. This is unnecessary. If a thread of a core is not idle, skip
evaluating other threads of a core. Also while clearing the cpumask, bits
of all CPUs of a core can be cleared in one-shot.

Collecting ticks on a Power 9 SMT 8 system around select_idle_core
while running schbench shows us

(units are in ticks, hence lesser is better)
