ath11k: fix parsing PPDU_CTRL type in pktlog

PPDU_CTRL type is missing in current pktlog dumps.
PPDU_CTRL is sent on CE5 with len 2560 bytes, current
driver ignores the payload len greter than 2048.
PPDU_CTRL of 2560 bytes is sent in two fragments of len 2028
and 532 bytes, but firmware reports pkt header has length as 2560
for both of the fragments.
