ASoC: rt5682: Add CCF usage for providing I2S clks

There is a need to use RT5682 as DAI clock master for other codecs
within a platform, which means that the DAI clocks are required to
remain, regardless of whether the RT5682 is actually running
playback/capture.

The RT5682 CCF basic functions are implemented almost by the existing
internal functions and asoc apis. It needs a clk provider (rt5682 mclk)
to generate the bclk and wclk outputs.

The RT5682 CCF supports and restricts as below:
1. Fmt of DAI-AIF1 must be configured to master before using CCF.
2. Only accept a 48MHz clk as the clk provider.
3. Only provide a 48kHz wclk and a set of multiples of wclk as bclk.

There are some temporary limitations in this patch until a better
implementation.
