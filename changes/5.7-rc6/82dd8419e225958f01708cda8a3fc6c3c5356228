rcu: Warn on for_each_leaf_node_cpu_mask() from non-leaf

The for_each_leaf_node_cpu_mask() and for_each_leaf_node_possible_cpu()
macros must be invoked only on leaf rcu_node structures.  Failing to
abide by this restriction can result in infinite loops on systems with
more than 64 CPUs (or for more than 32 CPUs on 32-bit systems).  This
commit therefore adds WARN_ON_ONCE() calls to make misuse of these two
macros easier to debug.
