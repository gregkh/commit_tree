scripts: Fix the inclusion order in modpost

In the process of creating the source file of a module modpost injects a
set of includes that are not required if the compilation unit is
statically built into the kernel.

The order of inclusion of the headers can cause redefinition problems
(e.g.):

   In file included from include/linux/elf.h:5:0,
                    from include/linux/module.h:18,
                    from crypto/arc4.mod.c:2:
    #define ELF_OSABI  ELFOSABI_LINUX

   In file included from include/linux/elfnote.h:62:0,
                    from include/linux/build-salt.h:4,
                    from crypto/arc4.mod.c:1:
   include/uapi/linux/elf.h:363:0: note: this is the location of
   the previous definition
    #define ELF_OSABI ELFOSABI_NONE

The issue was exposed during the development of the series [1].
