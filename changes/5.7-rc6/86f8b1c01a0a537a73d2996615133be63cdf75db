net: dsa: Do not make user port errors fatal

Prior to 1d27732f411d ("net: dsa: setup and teardown ports"), we would
not treat failures to set-up an user port as fatal, but after this
commit we would, which is a regression for some systems where interfaces
may be declared in the Device Tree, but the underlying hardware may not
be present (pluggable daughter cards for instance).
