cpu/hotplug: Ignore pm_wakeup_pending() for disable_nonboot_cpus()

A recent change to freeze_secondary_cpus() which added an early abort if a
wakeup is pending missed the fact that the function is also invoked for
shutdown, reboot and kexec via disable_nonboot_cpus().

In case of disable_nonboot_cpus() the wakeup event needs to be ignored as
the purpose is to terminate the currently running kernel.

Add a 'suspend' argument which is only set when the freeze is in context of
a suspend operation. If not set then an eventually pending wakeup event is
ignored.
