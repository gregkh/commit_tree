ACPI: EC: Fix up fast path check in acpi_ec_add()

The fast path check in acpi_ec_add() is not incorrect, because in
fact acpi_device_hid(device) can be equal to ACPI_ECDT_HID only if
boot_ec is not NULL, but it may confuse static checkers, so change
it to explicitly check boot_ec upfront and use the slow path if
that pointer is NULL.
