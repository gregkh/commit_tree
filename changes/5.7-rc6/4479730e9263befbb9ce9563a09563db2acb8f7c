Revert "clocksource/drivers/timer-probe: Avoid creating dead devices"

This reverts commit 4f41fe386a94639cd9a1831298d4f85db5662f1e.

The change breaks systems on which the DT node of a device is used by
multiple drivers. The proposed workaround to clear OF_POPULATED is just a
band aid and this needs to be cleaned up at the root of the problem.

Revert this for now.
