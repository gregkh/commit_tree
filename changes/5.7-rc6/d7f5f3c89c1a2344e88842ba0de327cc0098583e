remoteproc: add IPA notification to q6v5 driver

Set up a subdev in the q6v5 modem remoteproc driver that generates
event notifications for the IPA driver to use for initialization and
recovery following a modem shutdown or crash.

A pair of new functions provides a way for the IPA driver to register
and deregister a notification callback function that will be called
whenever modem events (about to boot, running, about to shut down,
etc.) occur.  A void pointer value (provided by the IPA driver at
registration time) and an event type are supplied to the callback
function.

One event, MODEM_REMOVING, is signaled whenever the q6v5 driver is
about to remove the notification subdevice.  It requires the IPA
driver de-register its callback.

This sub-device is only used by the modem subsystem (MSS) driver,
so the code that adds the new subdev and allows registration and
deregistration of the notifier is found in "qcom_q6v6_mss.c".
