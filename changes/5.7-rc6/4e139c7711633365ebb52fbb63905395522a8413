sched: Provide cant_migrate()

Some code pathes rely on preempt_disable() to prevent migration on a non RT
enabled kernel. These preempt_disable/enable() pairs are substituted by
migrate_disable/enable() pairs or other forms of RT specific protection. On
RT these protections prevent migration but not preemption. Obviously a
cant_sleep() check in such a section will trigger on RT because preemption
is not disabled.

Provide a cant_migrate() macro which maps to cant_sleep() on a non RT
kernel and an empty placeholder for RT for now. The placeholder will be
changed to a proper debug check along with the RT specific migration
protection mechanism.
