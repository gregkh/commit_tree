x86/optprobe: Fix OPTPROBE vs UACCESS

While looking at an objtool UACCESS warning, it suddenly occurred to me
that it is entirely possible to have an OPTPROBE right in the middle of
an UACCESS region.

In this case we must of course clear FLAGS.AC while running the KPROBE.
Luckily the trampoline already saves/restores [ER]FLAGS, so all we need
to do is inject a CLAC. Unfortunately we cannot use ALTERNATIVE() in the
trampoline text, so we have to frob that manually.
