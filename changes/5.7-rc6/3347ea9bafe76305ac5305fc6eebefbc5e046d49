i2c: stm32f7: disable/restore Fast Mode Plus bits in low power modes

Defer the initial enabling of the Fast Mode Plus bits after the
stm32f7_i2c_setup_timing call in probe function in order to avoid
enabling them if speed is downgraded.
Clear & restore the Fast Mode Plus bits in the suspend/resume
handlers of the driver.
