perf report/top TUI: Support hotkey 'a' for annotation of unresolved addresses

In previous patch, we have supported the annotation functionality even
without symbols.

For this patch, it supports the hotkey 'a' on address in report view.
Note that, for branch mode, we only support the annotation for "branch
to" address.
