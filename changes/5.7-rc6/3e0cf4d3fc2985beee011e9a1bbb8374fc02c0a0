spi: meson-spicc: add a linear clock divider support

The SPICC controller in Meson-AXG SoC is capable of using
a linear clock divider to reach a much fine tuned range of clocks,
while the old controller only use a power of two clock divider,
result at a more coarse clock range.

Also convert the clock registration into Common Clock Framework.
