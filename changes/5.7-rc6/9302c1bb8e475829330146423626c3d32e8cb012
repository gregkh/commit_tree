efi/libstub: Rewrite file I/O routine

The file I/O routine that is used to load initrd or dtb files from
the EFI system partition suffers from a few issues:
- it converts the u8[] command line back to a UTF-16 string, which is
  pointless since we only handle initrd or dtb arguments provided via
  the loaded image protocol anyway, which is where we got the UTF-16[]
  command line from in the first place when booting via the PE entry
  point,
- in the far majority of cases, only a single initrd= option is present,
  but it optimizes for multiple options, by going over the command line
  twice, allocating heap buffers for dynamically sized arrays, etc.
- the coding style is hard to follow, with few comments, and all logic
  including string parsing etc all combined in a single routine.

Let's fix this by rewriting most of it, based on the idea that in the
case of multiple initrds, we can just allocate a new, bigger buffer
and copy over the data before freeing the old one.
