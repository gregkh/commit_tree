intel_idle: Simplify LAPIC timer reliability checks

The lapic_timer_always_reliable variable really takes only two values
and some arithmetic in intel_idle() related to comparing it with the
target C-state's MWAIT hint value is unnecessary.

Simplify the code by replacing lapic_timer_always_reliable with
a bool variable lapic_timer_always_reliable and dropping the
LAPIC_TIMER_ALWAYS_RELIABLE symbol along with the excess
computations in intel_idle().

While at it, add a comment explaining the branch taken in intel_idle()
if the LAPIC timer is only reliable in C1 and modify the related debug
message in intel_idle_init() accordingly (the modification of this
message in the only expected functional impact of the change made
here).
