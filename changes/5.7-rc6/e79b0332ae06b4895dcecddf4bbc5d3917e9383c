cifs: ignore cached share root handle closing errors

Fix tcon use-after-free and NULL ptr deref.

Customer system crashes with the following kernel log:

[462233.169868] CIFS VFS: Cancelling wait for mid 4894753 cmd: 14       => a QUERY DIR

 #6 [...] smb2_cancelled_close_fid at ... [cifs]

 #8 [...] worker_thread at ...
 #9 [...] kthread at ...

The most likely explanation we have is:

* When we put the last reference of a tcon (refcount=0), we close the
  cached share root handle.
* If closing a handle is interrupted, SMB2_close() will
  queue a SMB2_close() in a work thread.
* The queued object keeps a tcon ref so we bump the tcon
  refcount, jumping from 0 to 1.
* We reach the end of cifs_put_tcon(), we free the tcon object despite
  it now having a refcount of 1.
* The queued work now runs, but the tcon, ses & server was freed in
  the meantime resulting in a crash.

THREAD 1
========
cifs_put_tcon                 => tcon refcount reach 0
  SMB2_tdis
   close_shroot_lease
    close_shroot_lease_locked => if cached root has lease && refcount = 0
     smb2_close_cached_fid    => if cached root valid
      SMB2_close              => retry close in a thread if interrupted
       smb2_handle_cancelled_close
        __smb2_handle_cancelled_close    => !! tcon refcount bump 0 => 1 !!
         INIT_WORK(&cancelled->work, smb2_cancelled_close_fid);
         queue_work(cifsiod_wq, &cancelled->work) => queue work
 tconInfoFree(tcon);    ==> freed!
 cifs_put_smb_ses(ses); ==> freed!

THREAD 2 (workqueue)
========
smb2_cancelled_close_fid
  SMB2_close(0, cancelled->tcon, ...); => use-after-free of tcon
  cifs_put_tcon(cancelled->tcon);      => tcon refcount reach 0 second time
  *CRASH*
