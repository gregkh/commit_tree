libbpf: Fix use of PT_REGS_PARM macros with vmlinux.h

Add detection of vmlinux.h to bpf_tracing.h header for PT_REGS macro.
Currently, BPF applications have to define __KERNEL__ symbol to use correct
definition of struct pt_regs on x86 arch. This is due to different field names
under internal kernel vs UAPI conditions. To make this more transparent for
users, detect vmlinux.h by checking __VMLINUX_H__ symbol.
