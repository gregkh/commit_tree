crypto: ccp - use file mode for sev ioctl permissions

Instead of using CAP_SYS_ADMIN which is restricted to the root user,
check the file mode for write permissions before executing commands that
can affect the platform. This allows for more fine-grained access
control to the SEV ioctl interface. This would allow a SEV-only user
or group the ability to administer the platform without requiring them
to be root or granting them overly powerful permissions.

For example:

chown root:root /dev/sev
chmod 600 /dev/sev
setfacl -m g:sev:r /dev/sev
setfacl -m g:sev-admin:rw /dev/sev

In this instance, members of the "sev-admin" group have the ability to
perform all ioctl calls (including the ones that modify platform state).
Members of the "sev" group only have access to the ioctls that do not
modify the platform state.

This also makes opening "/dev/sev" more consistent with how file
descriptors are usually handled. By only checking for CAP_SYS_ADMIN,
the file descriptor could be opened read-only but could still execute
ioctls that modify the platform state. This patch enforces that the file
descriptor is opened with write privileges if it is going to be used to
modify the platform state.

This flexibility is completely opt-in, and if it is not desirable by
the administrator then they do not need to give anyone else access to
/dev/sev.
