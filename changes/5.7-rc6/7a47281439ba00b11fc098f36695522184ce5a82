net: sched: lock action when translating it to flow_action infra

In order to remove dependency on rtnl lock, take action's tcfa_lock when
constructing its representation as flow_action_entry structure.

Refactor tcf_sample_get_group() to assume that caller holds tcf_lock and
don't take it manually. This callback is only called from flow_action infra
representation translator which now calls it with tcf_lock held, so this
refactoring is necessary to prevent deadlock.

Allocate memory with GFP_ATOMIC flag for ip_tunnel_info copy because
tcf_tunnel_info_copy() is only called from flow_action representation infra
code with tcf_lock spinlock taken.
