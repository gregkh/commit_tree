qed: Fix race condition between scheduling and destroying the slowpath workqueue

Calling queue_delayed_work concurrently with
destroy_workqueue might race to an unexpected outcome -
scheduled task after wq is destroyed or other resources
(like ptt_pool) are freed (yields NULL pointer dereference).
cancel_delayed_work prevents the race by cancelling
the timer triggered for scheduling a new task.
