staging/octeon: fix up merge error

There's a semantic conflict in the Octeon staging network driver, which
used the skb_reset_tc() function to reset skb state when re-using an
skb.  But that inline helper function was removed in mainline by commit
2c64605b590e ("net: Fix CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT=n and
CONFIG_NFT_FWD_NETDEV={y, m} build").

Fix it by using skb_reset_redirect() instead.  Also move it out of the

This code path only ends up triggering if REUSE_SKBUFFS_WITHOUT_FREE is
enabled, which in turn only happens if you don't have CONFIG_NETFILTER
configured.  Which was how this wasn't caught by the usual allmodconfig
builds.
