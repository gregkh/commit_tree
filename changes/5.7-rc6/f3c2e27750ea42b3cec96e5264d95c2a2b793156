n_hdlc: convert debuglevel use to pr_debug

With pr_debug we have a fine-grained control about debugging prints. So
convert the use of global debuglevel variable and tests to a commonly
used pr_debug. And drop debuglevel completely.

This also implicitly adds a loglevel to the messages (KERN_DEBUG) as it
was missing on most of them.

And also use __func__ instead of function names explicitly typed.
