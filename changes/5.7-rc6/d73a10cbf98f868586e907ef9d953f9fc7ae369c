powerpc/64s/exception: Remove confusing IEARLY option

Replace IEARLY=1 and IEARLY=2 with IBRANCH_COMMON, which controls if
the entry code branches to a common handler; and IREALMODE_COMMON,
which controls whether the common handler should remain in real mode.

These special cases no longer avoid loading the SRR registers, there
is no point as most of them load the registers immediately anyway.
