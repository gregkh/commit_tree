platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Relocate pmc_core_*_display() to outside of CONFIG_DEBUG_FS

Since pmc_core_slps0_display() and pmc_core_lpm_display() is responsible for
dumping as well as displaying debug registers, there is no need for these
two functions to be defined under CONFIG_DEBUG_FS.

Hence, relocate these functions from under CONFIG_DEBUG_FS to above the block.
