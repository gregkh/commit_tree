x86: add comments about the binutils version to support code in as-instr

We raise the minimal supported binutils version from time to time.
The last bump was commit 1fb12b35e5ff ("kbuild: Raise the minimum
required binutils version to 2.21").

We have these as-instr tests because binutils 2.21 does not support
them.

When we bump the binutils version next time, this will be a good
hint to find out which one can be dropped.

As for the Clang/LLVM builds, we require very new LLVM version,
so the LLVM integrated assembler supports all of them.
