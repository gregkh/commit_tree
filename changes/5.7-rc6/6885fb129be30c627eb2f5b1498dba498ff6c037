arm64: Rename cpu_read_ops() to init_cpu_ops()

This renames cpu_read_ops() to init_cpu_ops() as the function is only
called in initialization phase. Also, we will introduce get_cpu_ops() in
the subsequent patches, to retireve the CPU operation by the given CPU
index. The usage of cpu_read_ops() and get_cpu_ops() are difficult to be
distinguished from their names.
