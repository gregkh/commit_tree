ASoC: soc-pcm: add snd_soc_dai_get_pcm_stream()

DAI driver has playback/capture stream.
OTOH, we have SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK/CAPTURE.
Because of this kind of implementation,
ALSA SoC needs to have many verbose code.

To solve this issue, this patch adds snd_soc_dai_get_pcm_stream() macro
to get playback/capture stream pointer from stream.
