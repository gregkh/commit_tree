net: phylink: ensure manual flow control is selected appropriately

Split the application of manually controlled flow control modes from
phylink_resolve_flow(), so that we can use alternative providers of
flow control resolution.

We also want to clear the MLO_PAUSE_AN flag when autoneg is disabled,
since flow control can't be negotiated in this circumstance.
