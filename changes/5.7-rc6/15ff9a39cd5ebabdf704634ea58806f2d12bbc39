arm: Remove the ability to set HYP vectors outside of the decompressor

Although we have to bounce between HYP and SVC to decompress and
relocate the kernel, we don't need to be able to use it in the
kernel itself. So let's drop the functionnality.

Since the vectors are never changed, there is no need to reset them
either, and nobody calls that stub anyway. The last function
(SOFT_RESTART) is still present in order to support kexec.
