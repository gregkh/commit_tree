locking/lockdep: Avoid recursion in lockdep_count_{for,back}ward_deps()

Qian Cai reported a bug when PROVE_RCU_LIST=y, and read on /proc/lockdep
triggered a warning:

  [ ] DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(current->hardirqs_enabled)
  ...
  [ ] Call Trace:
  [ ]  lock_is_held_type+0x5d/0x150
  [ ]  ? rcu_lockdep_current_cpu_online+0x64/0x80
  [ ]  rcu_read_lock_any_held+0xac/0x100
  [ ]  ? rcu_read_lock_held+0xc0/0xc0

  [ ]  ? class_equal+0x30/0x30
  [ ]  lockdep_count_forward_deps+0x11a/0x1a0

The warning got triggered because lockdep_count_forward_deps() call
__bfs() without current->lockdep_recursion being set, as a result
a lockdep internal function (__bfs()) is checked by lockdep, which is
unexpected, and the inconsistency between the irq-off state and the
state traced by lockdep caused the warning.

Apart from this warning, lockdep internal functions like __bfs() should
always be protected by current->lockdep_recursion to avoid potential
deadlocks and data inconsistency, therefore add the
current->lockdep_recursion on-and-off section to protect __bfs() in both
lockdep_count_forward_deps() and lockdep_count_backward_deps()
