ALSA: usb-audio: add mapping for ASRock TRX40 Creator

This is another TRX40 based motherboard with ALC1220-VB USB-audio
that requires a static mapping table.

This motherboard also has a PCI device which advertises no codecs.  The
PCI ID is 1022:1487 and PCI SSID is 1022:d102.  As this is using the AMD
vendor ID, don't blacklist for now in case other boards have a working
audio device with the same ssid.
