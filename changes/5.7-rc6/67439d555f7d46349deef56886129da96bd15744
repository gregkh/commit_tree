perf scripting perl: Add common_callchain to fix argument order

Since common_callchain has been added to the argument array, we need to
reflect it in perl-based scripts, because otherwise the following args
would be shifted and thus incorrect. E.g. rw-by-pid and calculation of
read and written bytes:

Before:

  read counts by pid:
     pid                  comm     # reads  bytes_requested  bytes_read
  ------  --------------------  -----------  ----------  ----------
   19301  dd                             4  424510450039736           0

After:

  read counts by pid:
     pid                  comm     # reads  bytes_requested  bytes_read
  ------  --------------------  -----------  ----------  ----------
   19301  dd                             4        9536             4341

Committer testing:

To see before after first do:

  # perf script record rw-by-pid
  ^C

Now you'll have a perf.data file to report on, then do before and after
using:

  # perf script report rw-by-pid

Anbd notice the bytes_request/bytes_read, as above.
