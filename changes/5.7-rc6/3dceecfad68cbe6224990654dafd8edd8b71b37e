s390/dasd: remove IOSCHED_DEADLINE from DASD Kconfig

CONFIG_IOSCHED_DEADLINE was removed with
commit f382fb0bcef4 ("block: remove legacy IO schedulers")

and setting of the scheduler was removed with
commit a5fd8ddce2af ("s390/dasd: remove setting of scheduler from driver").

So get rid of the select.
