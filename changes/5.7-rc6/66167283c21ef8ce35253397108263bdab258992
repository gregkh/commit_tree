scsi: ch: fixup refcounting imbalance for SCSI devices

The SCSI device is required to be present during ch_probe() and ch_open().
But the SCSI device itself is only checked during ch_open(), so it's anyones
guess if it had been present during ch_probe(). And consequently we can't
reliably detach it during ch_release(), as ch_remove() might have been
called first.  So initialize the changer device during ch_probe(), and take
a reference to the SCSI device during both ch_probe() and ch_open().
