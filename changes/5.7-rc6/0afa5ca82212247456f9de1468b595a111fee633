proc: Rename in proc_inode rename sysctl_inodes sibling_inodes

I about to need and use the same functionality for pid based
inodes and there is no point in adding a second field when
this field is already here and serving the same purporse.

Just give the field a generic name so it is clear that
it is no longer sysctl specific.

Also for good measure initialize sibling_inodes when
proc_inode is initialized.
