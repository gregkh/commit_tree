btrfs: account ticket size at add/delete time

Instead of iterating all pending tickets on the normal/priority list to
sum their total size the cost can be amortized across ticket addition/
removal. This turns O(n) + O(m) (where n is the size of the normal list
and m of the priority list) into O(1). This will mostly have effect in
workloads that experience heavy flushing.
