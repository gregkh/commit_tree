xfs: factor out a xlog_wait_on_iclog helper

Factor out the shared code to wait for a log force into a new helper.
This helper uses the XLOG_FORCED_SHUTDOWN check previous only used
by the unmount code over the equivalent iclog ioerror state used by
the other two functions.

There is a slight behavior change in that the force of the unmount
record is now accounted in the log force statistics.
