NFS: direct.c: Fix memory leak of dreq when nfs_get_lock_context fails

When dreq is allocated by nfs_direct_req_alloc(), dreq->kref is
initialized to 2. Therefore we need to call nfs_direct_req_release()
twice to release the allocated dreq. Usually it is called in
nfs_file_direct_{read, write}() and nfs_direct_complete().

However, current code only calls nfs_direct_req_relese() once if
nfs_get_lock_context() fails in nfs_file_direct_{read, write}().
So, that case would result in memory leak.

Fix this by adding the missing call.
