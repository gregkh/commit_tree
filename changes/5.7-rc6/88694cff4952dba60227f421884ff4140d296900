kbuild: generate autoksyms.h early

When doing a cold build, autoksyms.h starts empty, and is updated late
in the build process to have visibility over the symbols used by in-tree
drivers. But since the symbol whitelist is known upfront, it can be used
to pre-populate autoksyms.h and maximize the amount of code that can be
compiled to its final state in a single pass, hence reducing build time.

Do this by using gen_autoksyms.sh to initialize autoksyms.h instead of
creating an empty file.
