ASoC: SOF: Fix probe point getter

Firmware API changes which introduced 'num_elems' param in several probe
structs such as sof_ipc_probe_dma_add_params also impacted getter for
both, DMA and probe points. All struct handlers except for
sof_ipc_probe_info_params have been updated. Align said handler too to
calculate payload size correctly.
