RDMA/rxe: Always return ERR_PTR from rxe_create_mmap_info()

The commit below modified rxe_create_mmap_info() to return ERR_PTR's but
didn't update the callers to handle them. Modify rxe_create_mmap_info() to
only return ERR_PTR and fix all error checking after
rxe_create_mmap_info() is called.

Ensure that all other exit paths properly set the error return.
