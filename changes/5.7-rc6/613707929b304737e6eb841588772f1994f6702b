rcu: Add a trace event for kfree_rcu() use of kfree_bulk()

The event is given three parameters, first one is the name
of RCU flavour, second one is the number of elements in array
for free and last one is an address of the array holding
pointers to be freed by the kfree_bulk() function.

To enable the trace event your kernel has to be build with
CONFIG_RCU_TRACE=y, after that it is possible to track the
events using ftrace subsystem.
