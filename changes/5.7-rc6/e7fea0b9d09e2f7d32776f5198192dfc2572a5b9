net: axienet: Improve DMA error handling

Since 0 is a valid DMA address, we cannot use the physical address to
check whether a TX descriptor is valid and is holding a DMA mapping.

Use the "cntrl" member of the descriptor to make this decision, as it
contains at least the length of the buffer, so 0 points to an
uninitialised buffer.
