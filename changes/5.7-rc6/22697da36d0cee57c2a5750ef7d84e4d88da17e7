powerpc/kernel/sysfs: Add new config option PMU_SYSFS to enable PMU SPRs sysfs file creation

Many of the performance monitoring unit (PMU) SPRs are
exposed in the sysfs. This may not be a desirable since
"perf" API is the primary interface to program PMU and
collect counter data in the system. But that said, we
cant remove these sysfs files since we dont whether
anyone/anything is using them.

So the patch adds a new CONFIG option 'CONFIG_PMU_SYSFS'
(user selectable) to be used in sysfs file creation for
PMU SPRs. New option by default is disabled, but can be
enabled if user needs it.

Tested this patch behaviour in powernv and pseries machines.
Patch is also tested for pmac32_defconfig.
