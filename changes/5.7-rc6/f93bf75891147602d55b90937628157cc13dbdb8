serial: 8250_bcm2835aux: Support rs485 software emulation

Amend 8250_bcm2835aux.c to support rs485 as introduced for 8250_omap.c
by commit e490c9144cfa ("tty: Add software emulated RS485 support for
8250").

The bcm2835aux differs from omap chips by inverting the meaning of RTS
in the MCR register:  If the bit is clear, RTS is high.  With omap, it's
apparently the other way round.

Moreover, omap achieves half-duplex mode by disabling the UART_IER_RDI
interrupt and clearing the RX FIFO when TX stops.  This approach doesn't
work on bcm2835aux because the UART_LSR_DR bit is set even when
UART_IER_RDI is disabled.  Consequently, serial8250_handle_irq() invokes
serial8250_rx_chars() to empty the FIFO and characters are received even
though the user requested half-duplex.  Solve by disabling the receiver
using the non-standard CNTL register.

Cache that register in the driver's private data for performance.  Set
the private data pointer before calling serial8250_register_8250_port()
to prevent a null pointer deref in case one of the rs485 callbacks is
invoked immediately after port registration.
