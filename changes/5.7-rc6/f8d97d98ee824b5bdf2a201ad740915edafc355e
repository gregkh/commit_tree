drm: Register connector instead of calling register_connector callback

drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_cbs.register_connector callbacks are literally
identical amongst every driver and don't do anything other than
calling drm_connector_register(). Hence call drm_connector_register()
directly instead of a callback.

This is the preparatory step for removing the
drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_cbs.register_connector callback hook.
