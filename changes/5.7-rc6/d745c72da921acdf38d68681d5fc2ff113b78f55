arm64: dts: renesas: rcar-gen3: Add reset control properties for display

Add reset control properties to the device nodes for the Display Units
on all supported R-Car Gen3 SoCs.  Note that on these SoCs, there is
only a single reset for each pair of DU channels.

The display nodes on R-Car V3M and V3H already had "resets" properties,
but lacked the corresponding "reset-names" properties.

Join the clocks lines while at it, to increase uniformity.
