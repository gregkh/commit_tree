drm/i915/crc: move pipe_crc from drm_i915_private to intel_crtc

Having an array pipe_crc[I915_MAX_PIPES] in struct drm_i915_private
should be an obvious clue this should be located in struct intel_crtc
instead. Make it so.

As a side-effect, fix some errors in indexing pipe_crc with both pipe
and crtc index. And, of course, reduce the size of i915_drv.h.
