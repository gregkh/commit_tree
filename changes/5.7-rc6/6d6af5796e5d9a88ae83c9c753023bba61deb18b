spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Remove unused chip->void_write_data

This variable has been present since the initial submission of the
driver, and held, for some reason, the value of zero, to be sent on the
wire in the case there wasn't any TX buffer for the current transfer.

Since quite a while now, however, it isn't doing anything at all.
