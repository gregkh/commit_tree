net/mlx5: E-Switch, Restore chain id on miss

Chain ids are mapped to the lower part of reg C, and after loopback
are copied to to CQE via a restore rule's flow_tag.

To let tc continue in the correct chain, we find the corresponding
chain id in the eswitch chain id <-> reg C mapping, and set the SKB's
tc extension chain to it.

That tells tc to continue processing from this set chain.
