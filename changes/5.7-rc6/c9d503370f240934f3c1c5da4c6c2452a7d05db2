USB: Make it possible to "subclass" usb_device_driver

The kernel currenly has only 2 usb_device_drivers, one generic one, one
that completely replaces the generic one to make USB devices usable over
a network.

Use the newly exported generic driver functions when a driver declares
to want them run, in addition to its own code. This makes it possible to
write drivers that extend the generic USB driver.

Note that this patch is not enough for another driver to automatically
get selected.
