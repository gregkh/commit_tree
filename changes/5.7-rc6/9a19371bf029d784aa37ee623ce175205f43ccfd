mptcp: fix data_fin handing in RX path

The data fin flag is set only via a DSS option, but
mptcp_incoming_options() copies it unconditionally from the
provided RX options.

Since we do not clear all the mptcp sock RX options in a
socket free/alloc cycle, we can end-up with a stray data_fin
value while parsing e.g. MPC packets.

That would lead to mapping data corruption and will trigger
a few WARN_ON() in the RX path.

Instead of adding a costly memset(), fetch the data_fin flag
only for DSS packets - when we always explicitly initialize
such bit at option parsing time.
