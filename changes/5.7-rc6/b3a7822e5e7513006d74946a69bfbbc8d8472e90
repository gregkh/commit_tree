mm, memcg: prevent mem_cgroup_protected store tearing

The read side of this is all protected, but we can still tear if multiple
iterations of mem_cgroup_protected are going at the same time.

There's some intentional racing in mem_cgroup_protected which is ok, but
load/store tearing should be avoided.
