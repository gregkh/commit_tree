scsi: lpfc: Change default SCSI LUN QD to 64

The default lun queue depth by the driver has been 30 for many years.
However, this value, when used with more recent hardware, has actually
throttled some tests that concentrate io on a lun.

Increase the default lun queue depth to 64.

Queue full handling, reported by the target, remains in effect and
unchanged.
