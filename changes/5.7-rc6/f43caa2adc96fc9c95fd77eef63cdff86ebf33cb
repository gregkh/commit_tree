cgroup: Clean up css_set task traversal

css_task_iter stores pointer to head of each iterable list, this dates
back to commit 0f0a2b4fa621 ("cgroup: reorganize css_task_iter") when we
did not store cur_cset. Let us utilize list heads directly in cur_cset
and streamline css_task_iter_advance_css_set a bit. This is no
intentional function change.
