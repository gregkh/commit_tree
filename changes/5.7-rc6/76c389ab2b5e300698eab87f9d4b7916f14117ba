sched/fair: Fix kernel build warning in test_idle_cores() for !SMT NUMA

Building against the tip/sched/core as ff7db0bf24db ("sched/numa: Prefer
using an idle CPU as a migration target instead of comparing tasks") with
the arm64 defconfig (which doesn't have CONFIG_SCHED_SMT set) leads to:

  kernel/sched/fair.c:1525:20: warning: 'test_idle_cores' declared 'static' but never defined [-Wunused-function]
   static inline bool test_idle_cores(int cpu, bool def);
		      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rather than define it in its own CONFIG_SCHED_SMT #define island, bunch it
up with test_idle_cores().
