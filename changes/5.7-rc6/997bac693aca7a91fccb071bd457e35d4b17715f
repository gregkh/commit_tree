drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Avoid invalid rates

Based on work by Bjorn Andersson <bjorn.andersson@linaro.org>,
Jeffrey Hugo <jeffrey.l.hugo@gmail.com>, and
Rob Clark <robdclark@chromium.org>.

Let's read the SUPPORTED_LINK_RATES and/or MAX_LINK_RATE (depending on
the eDP version of the sink) to figure out what eDP rates are
supported and pick the ideal one.

NOTE: I have only personally tested this code on eDP panels that are
1.3 or older.  Code reading SUPPORTED_LINK_RATES for DP 1.4+ was
tested by hacking the code to pretend that a table was there.
