ARM: dts: sun8i-h3: Add thermal trip points/cooling maps

This enables passive cooling by down-regulating CPU voltage
and frequency.

For trip points, I used a slightly lowered values from the BSP
code. The critical temperature of 110째C from BSP code seemed
like a lot, so I rounded it off to 100째C.

The critical trip point value is 30째C above the maximum recommended
ambient temperature (70째C) for the SoC from the datasheet, so there's
some headroom even at such a high ambient temperature.
