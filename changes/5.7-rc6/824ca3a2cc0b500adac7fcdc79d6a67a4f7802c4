ARM: bcm: Drop unneeded select of PCI_DOMAINS_GENERIC, HAVE_SMP, TIMER_OF

Support for Broadcom SoCs depends on ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7, and thus on
ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM, which selects PCI_DOMAINS_GENERIC and TIMER_OF.
Support for the various Broadcom IPROC architected SoCs depends on
ARCH_MULTI_V7, which selects HAVE_SMP.
Hence there is no need for the Broadcom-specific symbols to select any
of them.
