x86/boot/compressed/32: Save the output address instead of recalculating it

In preparation for being able to decompress into a buffer starting at a
different address than startup_32, save the calculated output address
instead of recalculating it later.

We now keep track of three addresses:

	%edx: startup_32 as we were loaded by bootloader
	%ebx: new location of compressed kernel
	%ebp: start of decompression buffer
