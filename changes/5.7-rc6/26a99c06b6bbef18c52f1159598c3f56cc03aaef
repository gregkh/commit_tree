staging: comedi: ni_pcimio: add routes for NI PCIe-6251 and PCIe-6259

We do not currently provide routing information for NI PCIe-6251 and
PCI-6259 boards, but they are functionally identical to the PCI-6251 and
PCI-6259 boards and can share their routing information.  (This has been
confirmed for the PCIe-6251 by Éric Piel, using the "NI MAX" software
for Windows.  It is hoped that it applies to PCIe-6259, but has not yet
been checked due to lack of hardware.)  Initialize the `alt_route_name`
member of the board information for PCIe-6251 and PCIe-6259 to allow
them to make use of the routing information provided for PCI-6251 and
PCI-6259 respectively.
