io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS

IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS uses the buffer registration infrastructure to
support passing in an addr/len that is associated with a buffer ID and
buffer group ID. The group ID is used to index and lookup the buffers,
while the buffer ID can be used to notify the application which buffer
in the group was used. The addr passed in is the starting buffer address,
and length is each buffer length. A number of buffers to add with can be
specified, in which case addr is incremented by length for each addition,
and each buffer increments the buffer ID specified.

No validation is done of the buffer ID. If the application provides
buffers within the same group with identical buffer IDs, then it'll have
a hard time telling which buffer ID was used. The only restriction is
that the buffer ID can be a max of 16-bits in size, so USHRT_MAX is the
maximum ID that can be used.
