PM: QoS: Drop iterations over global QoS classes

After commit c3082a674f46 ("PM: QoS: Get rid of unused flags") the
only global PM QoS class in use is PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY, so it
does not really make sense to iterate over global QoS classes
anywhere, since there is only one.

Remove iterations over global QoS classes from the code and use
PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY as the target class directly where needed.

No intentional functional impact.
