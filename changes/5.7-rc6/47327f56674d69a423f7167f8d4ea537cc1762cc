perf events parser: Add missing Intel CPU events to parser

perf list expects CPU events to be parseable by name, e.g.

    # perf list | grep el-capacity-read
      el-capacity-read OR cpu/el-capacity-read/          [Kernel PMU event]

But the event parser does not recognize them that way, e.g.

    # perf test -v "Parse event"
    <SNIP>
    running test 54 'cycles//u'
    running test 55 'cycles:k'
    running test 0 'cpu/config=10,config1,config2=3,period=1000/u'
    running test 1 'cpu/config=1,name=krava/u,cpu/config=2/u'
    running test 2 'cpu/config=1,call-graph=fp,time,period=100000/,cpu/config=2,call-graph=no,time=0,period=2000/'
    running test 3 'cpu/name='COMPLEX_CYCLES_NAME:orig=cycles,desc=chip-clock-ticks',period=0x1,event=0x2/ukp'
    -> cpu/event=0,umask=0x11/
    -> cpu/event=0,umask=0x13/
    -> cpu/event=0x54,umask=0x1/
    failed to parse event 'el-capacity-read:u,cpu/event=el-capacity-read/u', err 1, str 'parser error'
    event syntax error: 'el-capacity-read:u,cpu/event=el-capacity-read/u'
                           \___ parser error test child finished with 1
    ---- end ----
    Parse event definition strings: FAILED!

This happens because the parser splits names by '-' in order to deal
with cache events. For example 'L1-dcache' is a token in
parse-events.l which is matched to 'L1-dcache-load-miss' by the
following rule:

    PE_NAME_CACHE_TYPE '-' PE_NAME_CACHE_OP_RESULT '-' PE_NAME_CACHE_OP_RESULT opt_event_config

And so there is special handling for 2-part PMU names i.e.

    PE_PMU_EVENT_PRE '-' PE_PMU_EVENT_SUF sep_dc

but no handling for 3-part names, which are instead added as tokens e.g.

    topdown-[a-z-]+

While it would be possible to add a rule for 3-part names, that would
not work if the first parts were also a valid PMU name e.g.
'el-capacity-read' would be matched to 'el-capacity' before the parser
reached the 3rd part.

The parser would need significant change to rationalize all this, so
instead fix for now by adding missing Intel CPU events with 3-part names
to the event parser as tokens.

Missing events were found by using:

    grep -r EVENT_ATTR_STR arch/x86/events/intel/core.c
