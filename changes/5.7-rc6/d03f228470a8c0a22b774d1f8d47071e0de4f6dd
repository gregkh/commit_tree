net: netrom: Fix potential nr_neigh refcnt leak in nr_add_node

nr_add_node() invokes nr_neigh_get_dev(), which returns a local
reference of the nr_neigh object to "nr_neigh" with increased refcnt.

When nr_add_node() returns, "nr_neigh" becomes invalid, so the refcount
should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.

The issue happens in one normal path of nr_add_node(), which forgets to
decrease the refcnt increased by nr_neigh_get_dev() and causes a refcnt
leak. It should decrease the refcnt before the function returns like
other normal paths do.

Fix this issue by calling nr_neigh_put() before the nr_add_node()
returns.
