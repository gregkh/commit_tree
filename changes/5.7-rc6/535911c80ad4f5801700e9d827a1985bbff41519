bpf: Add struct bpf_ksym

Adding 'struct bpf_ksym' object that will carry the
kallsym information for bpf symbol. Adding the start
and end address to begin with. It will be used by
bpf_prog, bpf_trampoline, bpf_dispatcher objects.

The symbol_start/symbol_end values were originally used
to sort bpf_prog objects. For the address displayed in
/proc/kallsyms we are using prog->bpf_func value.

I'm using the bpf_func value for program symbol start
instead of the symbol_start, because it makes no difference
for sorting bpf_prog objects and we can use it directly as
an address to display it in /proc/kallsyms.
