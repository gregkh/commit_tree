soundwire: bus: don't treat CMD_IGNORED as error on ClockStop

If a SoundWire link is enabled, but there are no Slave devices exposed
in firmware tables for this link, or no Slaves in ATTACHED or ALERT
mode, the CMD_IGNORED/-ENODATA error code on a broadcast write is
perfectly legit.

Filter this case to report errors and let the caller deal with the
CMD_IGNORED case.
