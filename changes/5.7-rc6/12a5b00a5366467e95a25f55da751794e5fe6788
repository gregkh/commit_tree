sparc,x86: vdso: remove meaningless undefining CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING

The code, #undef CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING, is not working as expected
because <linux/compiler_types.h> is parsed before vclock_gettime.c since
28128c61e08e ("kconfig.h: Include compiler types to avoid missed struct
attributes").

Since then, <linux/compiler_types.h> is included really early by using the
'-include' option.  So, you cannot negate the decision of
<linux/compiler_types.h> in this way.

You can confirm it by checking the pre-processed code, like this:

  $ make arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso32/vclock_gettime.i

There is no difference with/without CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE.

It is about two years since 28128c61e08e.  Nobody has reported a problem
(or, nobody has even noticed the fact that this code is not working).

It is ugly and unreliable to attempt to undefine a CONFIG option from C
files, and anyway the inlining heuristic is up to the compiler.

Just remove the broken code.
