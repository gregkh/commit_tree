mlxsw: spectrum: Remove unused RIF and FID families

In merge commit 50853808ff4a ("Merge branch
'mlxsw-Prepare-for-VLAN-aware-bridge-w-VxLAN'") I flipped mlxsw to use
emulated 802.1Q FIDs and correspondingly emulated VLAN RIFs. This means
that the non-emulated variants are no longer used. Remove them and
suppress the following warnings when compiling with W=1:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw//spectrum_router.c:7572:38: warning:
‘mlxsw_sp_rif_vlan_ops’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw//spectrum_fid.c:584:41: warning:
‘mlxsw_sp_fid_8021q_family’ defined but not used
[-Wunused-const-variable=]
