KVM: arm64: GICv4.1: Allow SGIs to switch between HW and SW interrupts

In order to let a guest buy in the new, active-less SGIs, we
need to be able to switch between the two modes.

Handle this by stopping all guest activity, transfer the state
from one mode to the other, and resume the guest. Nothing calls
this code so far, but a later patch will plug it into the MMIO
emulation.
