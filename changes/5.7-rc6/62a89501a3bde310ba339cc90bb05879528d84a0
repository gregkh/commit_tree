xprtrdma: Enhance MR-related trace points

Two changes:
- Show the number of SG entries that were mapped. This helps debug
  DMA-related problems.
- Record the MR's resource ID instead of its memory address. This
  groups each MR with its associated rdma-tool output, and reduces
  needless exposure of memory addresses.
