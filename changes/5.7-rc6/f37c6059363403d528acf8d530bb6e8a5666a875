addrconf: add functionality to check on rpl requirements

This patch adds a functionality to addrconf to check on a specific RPL
address configuration. According to RFC 6554:

To detect loops in the SRH, a router MUST determine if the SRH
includes multiple addresses assigned to any interface on that
router. If such addresses appear more than once and are separated by
at least one address not assigned to that router.
