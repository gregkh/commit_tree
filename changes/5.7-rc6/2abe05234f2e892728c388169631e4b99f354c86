l2tp: Allow management of tunnels and session in user namespace

Creation and management of L2TPv3 tunnels and session through netlink
requires CAP_NET_ADMIN. However, a process with CAP_NET_ADMIN in a
non-initial user namespace gets an EPERM due to the use of the
genetlink GENL_ADMIN_PERM flag. Thus, management of L2TP VPNs inside
an unprivileged container won't work.

We replaced the GENL_ADMIN_PERM by the GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM flag
similar to other network modules which also had this problem, e.g.,
openvswitch (commit 4a92602aa1cd "openvswitch: allow management from
inside user namespaces") and nl80211 (commit 5617c6cd6f844 "nl80211:
Allow privileged operations from user namespaces").

I tested this in the container runtime trustm3 (trustm3.github.io)
and was able to create l2tp tunnels and sessions in unpriviliged
(user namespaced) containers using a private network namespace.
For other runtimes such as docker or lxc this should work, too.
