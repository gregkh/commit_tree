usb: typec: mux: intel: Fix DP_HPD_LVL bit field

According to the PMC Type C Subsystem (TCSS) Mux programming guide rev
0.6, the PMC HPD request LVL bit field is bit 4.
Fix the definition here to match the programming guide.

Since this bit field is changing, explicitly define a field for the
HPD_HIGH mode data bit.
