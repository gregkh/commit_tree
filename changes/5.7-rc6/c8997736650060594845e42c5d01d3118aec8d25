block, bfq: turn put_queue into release_process_ref in __bfq_bic_change_cgroup

A bfq_put_queue() may be invoked in __bfq_bic_change_cgroup(). The
goal of this put is to release a process reference to a bfq_queue. But
process-reference releases may trigger also some extra operation, and,
to this goal, are handled through bfq_release_process_ref(). So, turn
the invocation of bfq_put_queue() into an invocation of
bfq_release_process_ref().
