perf test: Test pmu-events aliases

Add creating event aliases to the pmu-events test.

So currently we verify that the generated pmu-events.c is as expected for
some test events. Now test that we generate aliases as expected for those
events during normal operation.

For that, we cycle through each HW PMU in the system, and use the test
events to create aliases, and verify those against known, expected values.

For core PMUs, we should create an alias for every event in
test_cpu_events[].

However, for uncore PMUs, they need to be matched by the pmu_event.pmu
member, so use test_uncore_events[]; so check the match beforehand with
pmu_uncore_alias_match().

A sample run is as follows for my x86 machine:

  john@linux-3c19:~/linux> tools/perf/perf test -vv 10
  10: PMU events                                            :
  --- start ---

  ...
