mfd: intel-lpss: Fix Intel Elkhart Lake LPSS I2C input clock

Intel Elkhart Lake LPSS I2C has 100 MHz input clock instead of 133 MHz
that was our preliminary information. This will result slower I2C bus
clock when driver calculates its timing parameters in case ACPI tables
don't provide them.

Slower I2C bus clock is allowed but let's fix this to match with
reality.

While at it, keep the same default I2C device properties as Intel
Broxton since it is not known do they need any update.
