btrfs: make btrfs_assert_tree_locked static inline

The function btrfs_assert_tree_locked is used outside of the locking
code so it is exported, however we can make it static inine as it's
fairly trivial.

This is the only locking assertion used in release builds, inlining
improves the text size by 174 bytes and reduces stack consumption in the
callers.
