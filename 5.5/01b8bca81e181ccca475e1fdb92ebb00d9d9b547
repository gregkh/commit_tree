compat_ioctl: use correct compat_ptr() translation in drivers

A handful of drivers all have a trivial wrapper around their ioctl
handler, but don't call the compat_ptr() conversion function at the
moment. In practice this does not matter, since none of them are used
on the s390 architecture and for all other architectures, compat_ptr()
does not do anything, but using the new compat_ptr_ioctl()
helper makes it more correct in theory, and simplifies the code.

I checked that all ioctl handlers in these files are compatible
and take either pointer arguments or no argument.
