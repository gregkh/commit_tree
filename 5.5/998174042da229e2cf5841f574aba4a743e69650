ppdev: fix PPGETTIME/PPSETTIME ioctls

Going through the uses of timeval in the user space API,
I noticed two bugs in ppdev that were introduced in the y2038
conversion:

* The range check was accidentally moved from ppsettime to
  ppgettime

* On sparc64, the microseconds are in the other half of the
  64-bit word.

Fix both, and mark the fix for stable backports.
