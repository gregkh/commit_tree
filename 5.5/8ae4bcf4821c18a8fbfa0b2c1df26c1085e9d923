perf/smmuv3: Remove the leftover put_cpu() in error path

In smmu_pmu_probe(), there is put_cpu() in the error path,
which is wrong because we use raw_smp_processor_id() to
get the cpu ID, not get_cpu(), remove it.

While we are at it, kill 'out_cpuhp_err' altogether and
just return err if we fail to add the hotplug instance.
