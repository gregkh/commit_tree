PCI: amlogic: Fix reset assertion via gpio descriptor

Normally asserting reset signal on gpio would be achieved with:
	gpiod_set_value_cansleep(reset_gpio, 1);

Meson PCI driver set reset value to '0' instead of '1' as it takes into
account the PERST# signal polarity. The polarity should be taken care
in the device tree instead.

This fixes the reset assertion meaning and moves out the polarity
configuration in DT (please note that there is no DT currently using
this driver).
