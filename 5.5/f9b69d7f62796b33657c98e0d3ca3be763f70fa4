bnxt_en: Fix suspend/resume path on 57500 chips

Driver calls HWRM_FUNC_RESET firmware call while resuming the device
which clears the context memory backing store. Because of which
allocating firmware resources would eventually fail. Fix it by freeing
all context memory during suspend and reallocate the memory during resume.

Call bnxt_hwrm_queue_qportcfg() in resume path.  This firmware call
is needed on the 57500 chips so that firmware will set up the proper
queue mapping in relation to the context memory.
