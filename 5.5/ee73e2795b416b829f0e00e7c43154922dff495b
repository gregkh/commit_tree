drm/i915/tgl: Disable preemption while being debugged

We see failures where the context continues executing past a
preemption event, eventually leading to situations where a request has
executed before we have event submitted it to HW! It seems like tgl is
ignoring our RING_TAIL updates, but more likely is that there is a
missing update required for our semaphore waits around preemption.

v2: And disable internal semaphore usage
