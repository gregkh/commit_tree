drm/dp_mst: Rename drm_dp_add_port and drm_dp_update_port

The names for these functions are rather confusing. drm_dp_add_port()
sounds like a function that would simply create a port and add it to a
topology, and do nothing more. Similarly, drm_dp_update_port() would be
assumed to be the function that should be used to update port
information after initial creation.

While those assumptions are currently correct in how these functions are
used, a quick glance at drm_dp_add_port() reveals that drm_dp_add_port()
can also update the information on a port, and seems explicitly designed
to do so. This can be explained pretty simply by the fact that there's
more situations that would involve updating the port information based
on a link address response as opposed to a connection status
notification than the driver's initial topology probe. Case in point:
reprobing link addresses after suspend/resume.

Since we're about to start using drm_dp_add_port() differently for
suspend/resume reprobing, let's rename both functions to clarify what
they actually do.
