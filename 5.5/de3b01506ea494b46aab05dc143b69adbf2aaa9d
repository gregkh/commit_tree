mm: vmscan: simplify lruvec_lru_size()

Patch series "mm: vmscan: cgroup-related cleanups".

Here are 8 patches that clean up the reclaim code's interaction with
cgroups a bit. They're not supposed to change any behavior, just make
the implementation easier to understand and work with.

This patch (of 8):

This function currently takes the node or lruvec size and subtracts the
zones that are excluded by the classzone index of the allocation.  It uses
four different types of counters to do this.

Just add up the eligible zones.
