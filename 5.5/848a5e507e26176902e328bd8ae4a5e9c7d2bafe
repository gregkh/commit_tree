perf report: Jump to symbol source view from total cycles view

This patch supports jumping from tui total cycles view to symbol source
view.

For example,

  perf record -b ./div
  perf report --total-cycles

In total cycles view, we can select one entry and press 'a' or press
ENTER key to jump to symbol source view.

This patch also sets sort_order to NULL in cmd_report() which will use
the default branch sort order. The percent value in new annotate view
will be consistent with the percent in annotate view switched from perf
report (we observed the original percent gap with previous patches).

 v2:
 ---
 Fix the 'make NO_SLANG=1' error. (set __maybe_unused to
 annotation_opts in block_hists_tui_browse()).
