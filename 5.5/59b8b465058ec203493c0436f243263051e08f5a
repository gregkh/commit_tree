xfs: devirtualize ->data_get_ftype and ->data_put_ftype

Replace the ->data_get_ftype and ->data_put_ftype dir ops methods with
directly called xfs_dir2_data_get_ftype and xfs_dir2_data_put_ftype
helpers that takes care of the differences between the directory format
with and without the file type field.
