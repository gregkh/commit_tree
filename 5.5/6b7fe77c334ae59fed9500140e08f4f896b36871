arm/arm64: smccc/psci: add arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit()

SMCCC callers are currently amassing a collection of enums for the SMCCC
conduit, and are having to dig into the PSCI driver's internals in order
to figure out what to do.

Let's clean this up, with common SMCCC_CONDUIT_* definitions, and an
arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit() helper that abstracts the PSCI driver's
internal state.

We can kill off the PSCI_CONDUIT_* definitions once we've migrated users
over to the new interface.
