modpost: do not invoke extra modpost for nsdeps

'make nsdeps' invokes the modpost three times at most; before linking
vmlinux, before building modules, and finally for generating .ns_deps
files. Running the modpost again and again is not efficient.

The last two can be unified. When the -d option is given, the modpost
still does the usual job, and in addition, generates .ns_deps files.
