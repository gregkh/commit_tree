EDAC/amd64: Get rid of the ECC disabled long message

This message keeps flooding dmesg on boxes where ECC is disabled or the
DIMMs do not support ECC but the module gets auto-probed. What's even
worse is that autoprobing happens on every CPU due to the CPU-family
matching the driver does and uevent being generated for each CPU device.

What is more, this message is becoming even more useless on newer
systems where forcing ECC is not recommended and it should be done in
the BIOS so the BIOS can do all the necessary work, i.e., just setting a
bit in an MSR is not enough anymore.

So get rid of it.
