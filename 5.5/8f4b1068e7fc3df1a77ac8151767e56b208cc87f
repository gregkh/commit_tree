drm/i915: Check some transcoder timing minimum limits

On ILK+ the documented min hdisplay is 64, min hblank is 32, and min
vblank is 5. On earlier platforms min hblank is also 32, and min
vblank is 3. Make sure the mode satisfies those limits.

There are further limits for HDMI and pfit use cases, but we'll check
for those in a more specific location.
