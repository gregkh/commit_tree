net: dsa: sja1105: Take PTP egress timestamp by port, not mgmt slot

The PTP egress timestamp N must be captured from register PTPEGR_TS[n],
where n = 2 * PORT + TSREG. There are 10 PTPEGR_TS registers, 2 per
port. We are only using TSREG=0.

As opposed to the management slots, which are 4 in number
(SJA1105_NUM_PORTS, minus the CPU port). Any management frame (which
includes PTP frames) can be sent to any non-CPU port through any
management slot. When the CPU port is not the last port (#4), there will
be a mismatch between the slot and the port number.

Luckily, the only mainline occurrence with this switch
(arch/arm/boot/dts/ls1021a-tsn.dts) does have the CPU port as #4, so the
issue did not manifest itself thus far.
