reiserfs: fix handling of -EOPNOTSUPP in reiserfs_for_each_xattr

Commit 60e4cf67a58 (reiserfs: fix extended attributes on the root
directory) introduced a regression open_xa_root started returning
-EOPNOTSUPP but it was not handled properly in reiserfs_for_each_xattr.

When the reiserfs module is built without CONFIG_REISERFS_FS_XATTR,
deleting an inode would result in a warning and chowning an inode
would also result in a warning and then fail to complete.

With CONFIG_REISERFS_FS_XATTR enabled, the xattr root would always be
present for read-write operations.

This commit handles -EOPNOSUPP in the same way -ENODATA is handled.
