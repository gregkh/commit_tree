RDMA/core: Create mmap database and cookie helper functions

Create some common API's for adding entries to a xa_mmap. Searching for
an entry and freeing one.

The general approach is copied from the EFA driver and improved to be more
general and do more to help the drivers. Integration with the core allows
a reference counted scheme with a free function so that the driver can
know when its mmaps are all gone.

This significant new functionality will be helpful for drivers to have the
correct lifetime model for mmap objects.
