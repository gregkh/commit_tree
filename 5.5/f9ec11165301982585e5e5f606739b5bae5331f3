powerpc: Allow 64bit VDSO __kernel_sync_dicache to work across ranges >4GB

When calling __kernel_sync_dicache with a size >4GB, we were masking
off the upper 32 bits, so we would incorrectly flush a range smaller
than intended.

This patch replaces the 32 bit shifts with 64 bit ones, so that
the full size is accounted for.
