dt: spi: Add Renesas RZ/N1 binding documentation

The Renesas RZ/N1 SPI Controller is based on the Synopsys DW SSI, but has
additional registers for software CS control and DMA. This patch does not
address the changes required for DMA support, it simply adds the compatible
string. The CS functionality is not very useful and also not needed as
Linux can use gpios for the CS signals.

Add a compatible string to handle any unforeseen issues that may arise, and
pave the way for DMA support.
