cifs: smbd: Only queue work for error recovery on memory registration

It's not necessary to queue invalidated memory registration to work queue, as
all we need to do is to unmap the SG and make it usable again. This can save
CPU cycles in normal data paths as memory registration errors are rare and
normally only happens during reconnection.
