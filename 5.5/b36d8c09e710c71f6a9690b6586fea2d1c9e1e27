crypto: arm/chacha - remove dependency on generic ChaCha driver

Instead of falling back to the generic ChaCha skcipher driver for
non-SIMD cases, use a fast scalar implementation for ARM authored
by Eric Biggers. This removes the module dependency on chacha-generic
altogether, which also simplifies things when we expose the ChaCha
library interface from this module.
