net: sch_prio: When ungrafting, replace with FIFO

When a child Qdisc is removed from one of the PRIO Qdisc's bands, it is
replaced unconditionally by a NOOP qdisc. As a result, any traffic hitting
that band gets dropped. That is incorrect--no Qdisc was explicitly added
when PRIO was created, and after removal, none should have to be added
either.

Fix PRIO by first attempting to create a default Qdisc and only falling
back to noop when that fails. This pattern of attempting to create an
invisible FIFO, using NOOP only as a fallback, is also seen in other
Qdiscs.
