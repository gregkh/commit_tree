ASoC: soc-acpi: add link_mask field

When interfaces can be pin-muxed, static information from ACPI might
not be enough. Add information on which links needs to be enabled by
hardware/firmware for a specific machine driver to be selected.

When walking through the list of possible machines, links will be
checked, which implies that configurations where multiple links are
required need to be checked first.

Additional criteria will be needed later, such as which SoundWire
Slave devices are actually enabled, but for now this helps detect
between basic configurations.
