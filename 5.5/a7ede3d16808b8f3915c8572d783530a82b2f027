raid5: need to set STRIPE_HANDLE for batch head

With commit 6ce220dd2f8ea71d6afc29b9a7524c12e39f374a ("raid5: don't set
STRIPE_HANDLE to stripe which is in batch list"), we don't want to set
STRIPE_HANDLE flag for sh which is already in batch list.

However, the stripe which is the head of batch list should set this flag,
otherwise panic could happen inside init_stripe at BUG_ON(sh->batch_head),
it is reproducible with raid5 on top of nvdimm devices per Xiao oberserved.

Thanks for Xiao's effort to verify the change.
