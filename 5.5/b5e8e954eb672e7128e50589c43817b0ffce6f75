drm/i915/gt: Introduce barrier pulses along engines

To flush idle barriers, and even inflight requests, we want to send a
preemptive 'pulse' along an engine. We use a no-op request along the
pinned kernel_context at high priority so that it should run or else
kick off the stuck requests. We can use this to ensure idle barriers are
immediately flushed, as part of a context cancellation mechanism, or as
part of a heartbeat mechanism to detect and reset a stuck GPU.
