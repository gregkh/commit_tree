locking/refcount: Ensure integer operands are treated as signed

In preparation for changing the saturation point of REFCOUNT_FULL to
INT_MIN/2, change the type of integer operands passed into the API
from 'unsigned int' to 'int' so that we can avoid casting during
comparisons when we don't want to fall foul of C integral conversion
rules for signed and unsigned types.

Since the kernel is compiled with '-fno-strict-overflow', we don't need
to worry about the UB introduced by signed overflow here. Furthermore,
we're already making heavy use of the atomic_t API, which operates
exclusively on signed types.
