spi: Introduce dspi_slave_abort() function for NXP's dspi SPI driver

This change provides the dspi_slave_abort() function, which is a callback
for slave_abort() method of SPI controller generic driver.

As in the SPI slave mode the transmission is driven by master, any
distortion may cause the slave to enter undefined internal state.
To avoid this problem the dspi_slave_abort() terminates all pending and
ongoing DMA transactions (with sync) and clears internal FIFOs.
