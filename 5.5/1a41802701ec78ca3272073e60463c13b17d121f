btrfs: drop bio_set_dev where not needed

bio_set_dev sets a bdev to a bio and is not only setting a pointer bug
also changing some state bits if there was a different bdev set before.
This is one thing that's not needed.

Another thing is that setting a bdev at bio allocation time is too early
and actually does not work with plain redundancy profiles, where each
time we submit a bio to a device, the bdev is set correctly.

In many places the bio bdev is set to latest_bdev that seems to serve as
a stub pointer "just to put something to bio". But we don't have to do
that.

Where do we know which bdev to set:

* for regular IO: submit_stripe_bio that's called by btrfs_map_bio

* repair IO: repair_io_failure, read or write from specific device

* super block write (using buffer_heads but uses raw bdev) and barriers

* scrub: this does not use all regular IO paths as it needs to reach all
  copies, verify and fixup eventually, and for that all bdev management
  is independent

* raid56: rbio_add_io_page, for the RMW write

* integrity-checker: does it's own low-level block tracking
