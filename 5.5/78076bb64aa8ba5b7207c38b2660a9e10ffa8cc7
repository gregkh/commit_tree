io_uring: use hash table for poll command lookups

We recently changed this from a single list to an rbtree, but for some
real life workloads, the rbtree slows down the submission/insertion
case enough so that it's the top cycle consumer on the io_uring side.
In testing, using a hash table is a more well rounded compromise. It
is fast for insertion, and as long as it's sized appropriately, it
works well for the cancellation case as well. Running TAO with a lot
of network sockets, this removes io_poll_req_insert() from spending
2% of the CPU cycles.
