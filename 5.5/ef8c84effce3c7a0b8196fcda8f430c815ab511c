selftests/bpf: De-flake test_tcpbpf

It looks like BPF program that handles BPF_SOCK_OPS_STATE_CB state
can race with the bpf_map_lookup_elem("global_map"); I sometimes
see the failures in this test and re-running helps.

Since we know that we expect the callback to be called 3 times (one
time for listener socket, two times for both ends of the connection),
let's export this number and add simple retry logic around that.

Also, let's make EXPECT_EQ() not return on failure, but continue
evaluating all conditions; that should make potential debugging
easier.

With this fix in place I don't observe the flakiness anymore.
