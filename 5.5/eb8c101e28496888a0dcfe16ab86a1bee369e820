Bluetooth: hci_core: fix init for HCI_USER_CHANNEL

During the setup() stage, HCI device drivers expect the chip to
acknowledge its setup() completion via vendor specific frames.

If userspace opens() such HCI device in HCI_USER_CHANNEL [1] mode,
the vendor specific frames are never tranmitted to the driver, as
they are filtered in hci_rx_work().

Allow HCI devices which operate in HCI_USER_CHANNEL mode to receive
frames if the HCI device is is HCI_INIT state.
