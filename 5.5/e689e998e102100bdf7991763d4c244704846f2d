net/mlx5e: TC, Stub out ipv6 tun create header function

Improve mlx5e_route_lookup_ipv6 function structure by avoiding #ifdef then
return -EOPNOTSUPP in the middle of the function code.

To do so, we stub out mlx5e_tc_tun_create_header_ipv6 which is the only
caller of this helper function to avoid calling it altogether
when ipv6 is compiled out, which should also cleanup some compiler
warnings of unused variables.
