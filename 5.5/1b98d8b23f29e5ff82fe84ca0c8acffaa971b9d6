habanalabs: optimize MMU unmap

Reduce context close time by skipping hash table lookup if possible in
order to avoid hard reset with open contexts.
Reset with open contexts can potentially lead to a kernel crash as the
generic pool of the MMU hops is destroyed while it is not empty because
some unmap operations are not done.
This commit affect mainly when running on simulator.
