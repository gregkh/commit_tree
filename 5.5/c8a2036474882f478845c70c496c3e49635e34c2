gpu: host1x: Unconditionally select IOMMU_IOVA

Currently configurations can be generated where IOMMU_SUPPORT is
disabled but IOMMU_IOVA is built as a module and HOST1X as built-in. In
such a case, the symbols guarded by IOMMU_IOVA will not be available
when linking the host1x driver and cause a linking failure.

Simplify this by unconditionally selecting IOMMU_IOVA, which makes sure
that it will be forced to =y if HOST1X=y. Technically we can now get
IOMMU_IOVA code built-in even if we don't use it (host1x only uses it
when IOMMU_SUPPORT is also enabled), but such configuration are of a
mostly academic nature. In all practical configurations we want IOMMU
support anyway.
