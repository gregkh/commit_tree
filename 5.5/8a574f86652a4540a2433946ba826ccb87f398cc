openvswitch: remove another BUG_ON()

If we can't build the flow del notification, we can simply delete
the flow, no need to crash the kernel. Still keep a WARN_ON to
preserve debuggability.

Note: the BUG_ON() predates the Fixes tag, but this change
can be applied only after the mentioned commit.

v1 -> v2:
 - do not leak an skb on error

Fixes: aed067783e50 ("openvswitch: Minimize ovs_flow_cmd_del critical section.")
