mm/vmalloc: rework vmap_area_lock

With the new allocation approach introduced in the 5.2 kernel, it
becomes possible to get rid of one global spinlock.  By doing that we
can further improve the KVA from the performance point of view.

Basically we can have two independent locks, one for allocation part and
another one for deallocation, because of two different entities: "free
data structures" and "busy data structures".

As a result, allocation/deallocation operations can still interfere
between each other in case of running simultaneously on different CPUs,
it means there is still dependency, but with two locks it becomes lower.

Summarizing:
  - it reduces the high lock contention
  - it allows to perform operations on "free" and "busy"
    trees in parallel on different CPUs. Please note it
    does not solve scalability issue.

Test results:

In order to evaluate this patch, we can run "vmalloc test driver" to see
how many CPU cycles it takes to complete all test cases running
sequentially.  All online CPUs run it so it will cause a high lock
contention.
