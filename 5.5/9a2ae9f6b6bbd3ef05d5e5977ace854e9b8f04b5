KVM: x86: Zero the IOAPIC scan request dest vCPUs bitmap

Not zeroing the bitmap used for identifying the destination vCPUs for an
IOAPIC scan request in fixed delivery mode could lead to waking up unwanted
vCPUs. This patch zeroes the vCPU bitmap before passing it to
kvm_bitmap_or_dest_vcpus(), which is responsible for setting the bitmap
with the bits corresponding to the destination vCPUs.
