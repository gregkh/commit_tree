net/smc: improve link group freeing

Usually link groups are freed delayed to enable quick connection
creation for a follow-on SMC socket. Terminated link groups are
freed faster. This patch makes sure, fast schedule of link group
freeing is not rescheduled by a delayed schedule. And it makes sure
link group freeing is not rescheduled, if the real freeing is already
running.
