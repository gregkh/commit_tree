jbd2: Drop pointless wakeup from jbd2_journal_stop()

When we drop last handle from a transaction and journal->j_barrier_count
> 0, jbd2_journal_stop() wakes up journal->j_wait_transaction_locked
wait queue. This looks pointless - wait for outstanding handles always
happens on journal->j_wait_updates waitqueue.
journal->j_wait_transaction_locked is used to wait for transaction state
changes and by start_this_handle() for waiting until
journal->j_barrier_count drops to 0. The first case is clearly
irrelevant here since only jbd2 thread changes transaction state. The
second case looks related but jbd2_journal_unlock_updates() is
responsible for the wakeup in this case. So just drop the wakeup.
