net: phy: realtek: fix using paged operations with RTL8105e / RTL8208

It was reported [0] that since the referenced commit a warning is
triggered in phylib that complains about paged operations being used
with a PHY driver that doesn't support this. The commit isn't wrong,
just for one chip version (RTL8105e) no dedicated PHY driver exists
yet. So add the missing PHY driver.
