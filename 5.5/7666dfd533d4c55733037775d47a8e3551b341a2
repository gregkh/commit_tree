Revert "pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a77990: Fix MOD_SEL1 bit31 when using SIM0_D"

This reverts commit e167d723e1a472d252e5c4baf823b77ce5543b05.

According to the R-Car Gen3 Hardware Manual Errata for Rev 1.00 of Aug
24, 2018, the SEL_SIMCARD_{0,1} definition was to be deleted.  However,
this errata merely fixed an accidental double definition in the Hardware
User's Manual Rev. 1.00.  The real definition is still present in later
revisions of the manual (Rev. 1.50 and Rev. 2.00).

Hence revert the commit to recover the definition.

Based on a patch in the BSP by Takeshi Kihara
<takeshi.kihara.df@renesas.com>.
