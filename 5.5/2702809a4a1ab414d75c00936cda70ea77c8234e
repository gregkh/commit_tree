powerpc: Detect the trusted boot state of the system

While secure boot permits only properly verified signed kernels to be
booted, trusted boot calculates the file hash of the kernel image and
stores the measurement prior to boot, that can be subsequently
compared against good known values via attestation services.

This patch reads the trusted boot state of a PowerNV system. The state
is used to conditionally enable additional measurement rules in the
IMA arch-specific policies.
