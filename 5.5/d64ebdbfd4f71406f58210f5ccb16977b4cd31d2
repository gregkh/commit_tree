ALSA: hda/realtek - Move some alc236 pintbls to fallback table

We have a new Dell machine which needs to apply the quirk
ALC255_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE, try to use the fallback table
to fix it this time. And we could remove all pintbls of alc236
for applying DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE on Dell machines.
