bpf: Add attach_btf_id attribute to program load

Add attach_btf_id attribute to prog_load command.
It's similar to existing expected_attach_type attribute which is
used in several cgroup based program types.
Unfortunately expected_attach_type is ignored for
tracing programs and cannot be reused for new purpose.
Hence introduce attach_btf_id to verify bpf programs against
given in-kernel BTF type id at load time.
It is strictly checked to be valid for raw_tp programs only.
In a later patches it will become:
btf_id == 0 semantics of existing raw_tp progs.
btd_id > 0 raw_tp with BTF and additional type safety.
