ASoC: topology: Check return value for snd_soc_add_dai_link()

snd_soc_add_dai_link() might fail. This situation occurs for
instance in a very specific use case where a PCM device and a
Back End DAI link are given identical names in the topology.
When this happens, soc_new_pcm_runtime() fails and then
snd_soc_add_dai_link() returns -ENOMEM when called from
soc_tplg_fe_link_create(). Because of that, the link will not
get added into the card list, so any attempt to remove it later
ends up in a panic.

Fix that by checking the return status and free the memory in case
of an error.
