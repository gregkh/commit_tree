ntb: ntb_pingpong: no need to check the return value of debugfs calls

There is no need to check the return value of debugfs_create_atomic_t as
nothing happens with the error.  Also, the code will never return NULL,
so this check has never caught anything :)

Fix this by removing the check entirely.
