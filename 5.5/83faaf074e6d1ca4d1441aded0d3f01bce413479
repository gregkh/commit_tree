drm/i915/gvt: Stop initializing pvinfo through reading mmio

The region of pvinfo is reserved for communication between a VMM and
the GPU driver executing on a virtual machine. HW doesn't have any
backing mmio store support for the pvinfo region, thus accessing to
this range through MMIO read/write from host side is forbidden which
is regarded as unclaimed register access.

This patch leaves pvinfo range be initialized with zero.
