scsi: bnx2fc: timeout calculation invalid for bnx2fc_eh_abort()

In the bnx2fc_eh_abort() function there is a calculation for
wait_for_completion that uses a HZ multiplier.  This is incorrect, it
scales the timeout by 1000 seconds instead of converting the ms value to
jiffies.  Therefore change the calculation.
