perf beauty: Hook up the x86 MSR table generator

This way we generate the source with the table for later use by plugins,
etc.

I.e. after running:

  $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf

We end up with:

  $ head /tmp/build/perf/trace/beauty/generated/x86_arch_MSRs_array.c
  static const char *x86_MSRs[] = {
  	[0x00000000] = "IA32_P5_MC_ADDR",
  	[0x00000001] = "IA32_P5_MC_TYPE",
  	[0x00000010] = "IA32_TSC",
  	[0x00000017] = "IA32_PLATFORM_ID",
  	[0x0000001b] = "IA32_APICBASE",
  	[0x00000020] = "KNC_PERFCTR0",
  	[0x00000021] = "KNC_PERFCTR1",
  	[0x00000028] = "KNC_EVNTSEL0",
  	[0x00000029] = "KNC_EVNTSEL1",
  $

Now its just a matter of using it, first in a libtracevent plugin.

At some point we should move tools/perf/trace/beauty to tools/beauty/,
so that it can be used more generally and even made available externally
like libbpf, libperf, libtraevent, etc.
