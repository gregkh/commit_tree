drivers/tty/serial/8250: Make Aspeed VUART SIRQ polarity configurable

Make the SIRQ polarity for Aspeed AST24xx/25xx VUART configurable via
sysfs. This setting need to be changed on specific host platforms
depending on the selected host interface (LPC / eSPI).

The setting is configurable via sysfs rather than device-tree to stay in
line with other related configurable settings.

On AST2500 the VUART SIRQ polarity can be auto-configured by reading a
bit from a configuration register, e.g. the LPC/eSPI interface
configuration bit.

Tested: Verified on TYAN S7106 mainboard.
