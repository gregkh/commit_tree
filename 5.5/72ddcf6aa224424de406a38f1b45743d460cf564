arm64: dts: exynos: Move GPU under /soc node for Exynos5433

Mali GPU hardware module is a standard hardware module integrated to
Exynos5433 SoCs, so it should reside under the "/soc" node. The only SoC
components which are placed in the DT root, are those, which are a part
of CPUs: like ARM architected timers and ARM performance measurement
units.
