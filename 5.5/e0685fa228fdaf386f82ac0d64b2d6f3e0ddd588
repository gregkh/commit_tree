arm64: Retrieve stolen time as paravirtualized guest

Enable paravirtualization features when running under a hypervisor
supporting the PV_TIME_ST hypercall.

For each (v)CPU, we ask the hypervisor for the location of a shared
page which the hypervisor will use to report stolen time to us. We set
pv_time_ops to the stolen time function which simply reads the stolen
value from the shared page for a VCPU. We guarantee single-copy
atomicity using READ_ONCE which means we can also read the stolen
time for another VCPU than the currently running one while it is
potentially being updated by the hypervisor.
