selftests/bpf: Add simple per-test targets to Makefile

Currently it's impossible to do `make test_progs` and have only
test_progs be built, because all the binary targets are defined in terms
of $(OUTPUT)/<binary>, and $(OUTPUT) is absolute path to current
directory (or whatever gets overridden to by user).

This patch adds simple re-directing targets for all test targets making
it possible to do simple and nice `make test_progs` (and any other
target).
