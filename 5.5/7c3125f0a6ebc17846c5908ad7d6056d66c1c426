net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix IP fragment location and behavior

The IP fragment is specified through user-defined field as the first
bit of the first user-defined word. We were previously trying to extract
it from the user-defined mask which could not possibly work. The ip_frag
is also supposed to be a boolean, if we do not cast it as such, we risk
overwriting the next fields in CFP_DATA(6) which would render the rule
inoperative.
