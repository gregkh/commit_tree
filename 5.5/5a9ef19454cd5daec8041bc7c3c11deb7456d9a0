net: systemport: Fixed queue mapping in internal ring map

We would not be transmitting using the correct SYSTEMPORT transmit queue
during ndo_select_queue() which looks up the internal TX ring map
because while establishing the mapping we would be off by 4, so for
instance, when we populate switch port mappings we would be doing:

switch port 0, queue 0 -> ring index #0
switch port 0, queue 1 -> ring index #1
...
switch port 0, queue 3 -> ring index #3
switch port 1, queue 0 -> ring index #8 (4 + 4 * 1)
...

instead of using ring index #4. This would cause our ndo_select_queue()
to use the fallback queue mechanism which would pick up an incorrect
ring for that switch port. Fix this by using the correct switch queue
number instead of SYSTEMPORT queue number.
