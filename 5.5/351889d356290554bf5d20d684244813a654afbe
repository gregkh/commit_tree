MIPS: fw: arc: workaround 64bit kernel/32bit ARC problems

Pointer arguments for 32bit ARC PROMs must reside in CKSEG0/1. While
the initial stack resides in CKSEG0 the first kernel thread stack
is already placed at a XKPHYS address, which ARC32 can't handle.
The workaround here is to use static variables, which are placed
into BSS and linked to a CKSEG0 address.
