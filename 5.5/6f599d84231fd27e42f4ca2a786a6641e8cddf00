x86/kdump: Always reserve the low 1M when the crashkernel option is specified

On x86, purgatory() copies the first 640K of memory to a backup region
because the kernel needs those first 640K for the real mode trampoline
during boot, among others.

However, when SME is enabled, the kernel cannot properly copy the old
memory to the backup area but reads only its encrypted contents. The
result is that the crash tool gets invalid pointers when parsing vmcore:

  crash> kmem -s|grep -i invalid
  kmem: dma-kmalloc-512: slab:ffffd77680001c00 invalid freepointer:a6086ac099f0c5a4
  kmem: dma-kmalloc-512: slab:ffffd77680001c00 invalid freepointer:a6086ac099f0c5a4
  crash>

So reserve the remaining low 1M memory when the crashkernel option is
specified (after reserving real mode memory) so that allocated memory
does not fall into the low 1M area and thus the copying of the contents
of the first 640k to a backup region in purgatory() can be avoided
altogether.

This way, it does not need to be included in crash dumps or used for
anything except the trampolines that must live in the low 1M.

 [ bp: Heavily rewrite commit message, flip check logic in
   crash_reserve_low_1M().]
