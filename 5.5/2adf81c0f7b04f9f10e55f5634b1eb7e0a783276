net: icmp: use input address in traceroute

Even with icmp_errors_use_inbound_ifaddr set, traceroute returns the
primary address of the interface the packet was received on, even if
the path goes through a secondary address. In the example:

                    1.0.3.1/24
 ---- 1.0.1.3/24    1.0.1.1/24 ---- 1.0.2.1/24    1.0.2.4/24 ----
 |H1|--------------------------|R1|--------------------------|H2|
 ----            N1            ----            N2            ----

where 1.0.3.1/24 is R1's primary address on N1, traceroute from
H1 to H2 returns:

traceroute to 1.0.2.4 (1.0.2.4), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  1.0.3.1 (1.0.3.1)  0.018 ms  0.006 ms  0.006 ms
 2  1.0.2.4 (1.0.2.4)  0.021 ms  0.007 ms  0.007 ms

After applying this patch, it returns:

traceroute to 1.0.2.4 (1.0.2.4), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  1.0.1.1 (1.0.1.1)  0.033 ms  0.007 ms  0.006 ms
 2  1.0.2.4 (1.0.2.4)  0.011 ms  0.007 ms  0.007 ms
