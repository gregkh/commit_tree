tpm_crb: fix fTPM on AMD Zen+ CPUs

Bug link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195657

cmd/rsp buffers are expected to be in the same ACPI region.
For Zen+ CPUs BIOS's might report two different regions, some of
them also report region sizes inconsistent with values from TPM
registers.

Memory configuration on ASRock x470 ITX:

db0a0000-dc59efff : Reserved
        dc57e000-dc57efff : MSFT0101:00
        dc582000-dc582fff : MSFT0101:00

Work around the issue by storing ACPI regions declared for the
device in a fixed array and adding an array for pointers to
corresponding possibly allocated resources in crb_map_io function.
This data was previously held for a single resource
in struct crb_priv (iobase field) and local variable io_res in
crb_map_io function. ACPI resources array is used to find index of
corresponding region for each buffer and make the buffer size
consistent with region's length. Array of pointers to allocated
resources is used to map the region at most once.
