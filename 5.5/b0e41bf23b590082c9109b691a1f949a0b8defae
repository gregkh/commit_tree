media: am437x-vpfe: Fix suspend path to always handle pinctrl config

Currently if vpfe is not active then it returns immediately in the
suspend and resume handlers. Change this so that it always performs the
pinctrl config so that we can still get proper sleep state configuration
on the pins even if we do not need to worry about fully saving and
restoring context.
