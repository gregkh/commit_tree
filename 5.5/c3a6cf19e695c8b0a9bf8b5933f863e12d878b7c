export: avoid code duplication in include/linux/export.h

include/linux/export.h has lots of code duplication between
EXPORT_SYMBOL and EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS.

To improve the maintainability and readability, unify the
implementation.

When the symbol has no namespace, pass the empty string "" to
the 'ns' parameter.

The drawback of this change is, it grows the code size.
When the symbol has no namespace, sym->namespace was previously
NULL, but it is now an empty string "". So, it increases 1 byte
for every no namespace EXPORT_SYMBOL.

A typical kernel configuration has 10K exported symbols, so it
increases 10KB in rough estimation.

I did not come up with a good idea to refactor it without increasing
the code size.

I am not sure how big a deal it is, but at least include/linux/export.h
looks nicer.
