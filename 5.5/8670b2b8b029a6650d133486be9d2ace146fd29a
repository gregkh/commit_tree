rfkill: allocate static minor

udev has a feature of creating /dev/<node> device-nodes if it finds
a devnode:<node> modalias. This allows for auto-loading of modules that
provide the node. This requires to use a statically allocated minor
number for misc character devices.

However, rfkill uses dynamic minor numbers and prevents auto-loading
of the module. So allocate the next static misc minor number and use
it for rfkill.
