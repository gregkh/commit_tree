ARM: tegra: Use WFE for power-gating on Tegra30

Turned out that WFI doesn't work reliably on Tegra30 as a trigger for
the power-gating, it causes CPU hang under some circumstances like having
memory controller running of PLLP. The TRM doc states that WFI should be
used for the Big-Little "Cluster Switch", while WFE for the power-gating.
Hence let's use the WFE for CPU0 power-gating, like it is done for the
power-gating of a secondary cores. This fixes CPU hang after entering LP2
with memory running off PLLP.
