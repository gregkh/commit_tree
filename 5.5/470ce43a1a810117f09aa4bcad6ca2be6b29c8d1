usb: typec: ucsi: Remove struct ucsi_control

That data structure was used for constructing the commands
before executing them, but it was never really useful. Using
the structure just complicated the driver. The commands are
64-bit wide, so it is enough to simply fill a u64 variable.
No data structures needed.

This simplifies the driver considerable and makes it much
easier to for example add support for big endian systems
later on.
