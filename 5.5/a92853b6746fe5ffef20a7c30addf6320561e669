fs/direct-io.c: keep dio_warn_stale_pagecache() when CONFIG_BLOCK=n

This helper prints warning if direct I/O write failed to invalidate cache,
and set EIO at inode to warn usersapce about possible data corruption.

See also commit 5a9d929d6e13 ("iomap: report collisions between directio
and buffered writes to userspace").

Direct I/O is supported by non-disk filesystems, for example NFS.  Thus
generic code needs this even in kernel without CONFIG_BLOCK.
