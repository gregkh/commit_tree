drm/i915/tgl: Access the right register when handling PSR interruptions

For older gens PSR IIR and IMR have fixed addresses. From TGL onwards those
registers moved to each transcoder offset. The bits for the registers
are defined without an offset per transcoder as right now we have one
register per transcoder. So add a fake "trans_shift" when calculating
the bits offsets: it will be 0 for gen12+ and psr.transcoder otherwise.

v2 (Lucas): change the implementation to use trans_shift instead of
getting each bit value with a different macro
