iommu: arm-smmu-impl: Add sdm845 implementation hook

Add reset hook for sdm845 based platforms to turn off
the wait-for-safe sequence.

Understanding how wait-for-safe logic affects USB and UFS performance
on MTP845 and DB845 boards:

Qcom's implementation of arm,mmu-500 adds a WAIT-FOR-SAFE logic
to address under-performance issues in real-time clients, such as
Display, and Camera.
On receiving an invalidation requests, the SMMU forwards SAFE request
to these clients and waits for SAFE ack signal from real-time clients.
The SAFE signal from such clients is used to qualify the start of
invalidation.
This logic is controlled by chicken bits, one for each - MDP (display),
IFE0, and IFE1 (camera), that can be accessed only from secure software
on sdm845.

This configuration, however, degrades the performance of non-real time
clients, such as USB, and UFS etc. This happens because, with wait-for-safe
logic enabled the hardware tries to throttle non-real time clients while
waiting for SAFE ack signals from real-time clients.

On mtp845 and db845 devices, with wait-for-safe logic enabled by the
bootloaders we see degraded performance of USB and UFS when kernel
enables the smmu stage-1 translations for these clients.
Turn off this wait-for-safe logic from the kernel gets us back the perf
of USB and UFS devices until we re-visit this when we start seeing perf
issues on display/camera on upstream supported SDM845 platforms.
The bootloaders on these boards implement secure monitor callbacks to
handle a specific command - QCOM_SCM_SVC_SMMU_PROGRAM with which the
logic can be toggled.

There are other boards such as cheza whose bootloaders don't enable this
logic. Such boards don't implement callbacks to handle the specific SCM
call so disabling this logic for such boards will be a no-op.

This change is inspired by the downstream change from Patrick Daly
to address performance issues with display and camera by handling
this wait-for-safe within separte io-pagetable ops to do TLB
maintenance. So a big thanks to him for the change and for all the
offline discussions.

Without this change the UFS reads are pretty slow:
$ time dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/zero bs=1048576 count=10 conv=sync
10+0 records in

With this change they are back to rock!
