libnvdimm: Move attribute groups to device type

Statically initialize the attribute groups for each libnvdimm
device_type. This is a preparation step for removing unnecessary exports
of attributes that can be included in the device_type by default.

Also take the opportunity to mark 'struct device_type' instances const.
