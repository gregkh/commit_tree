ALSA: hda - remove forced polling workaround for CFL and CNL

Remove the workarounds added in commit fa763f1b2858 ("ALSA:
hda - Force polling mode on CNL for fixing codec communication")
and commit a8d7bde23e71 ("ALSA: hda - Force polling mode on CFL
for fixing codec communication").

The workarounds are no longer needed after the more generic
change done in commit 2756d9143aa5 ("ALSA: hda - Fix intermittent
CORB/RIRB stall on Intel chips"). This change applies to a larger
set of hardware and covers CFL and CNL as well.

Similar change was already done to SOF DSP HDA driver with
no regressions detected.
