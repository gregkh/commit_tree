perf machine: Fill map_symbol->maps in append_inlines() to fix segfault

I forgot to fill in the map_symbol->maps field in append_inlines() which
then makes code down the line segfault when trying to deref it.

It doesn't make any sense to have an addr_location with its 'map' member
not NULL while its 'maps' is NULL, after all al->maps is where al->map
is in.

It is done that way so that we don't have to have in each 'struct map' a
pointer to the 'struct maps' it is in, as we had in the past when we
would have 'map->mg', before 'struct maps' was combined with 'struct
map_groups', because there was always a one-to-one relationship for
these structs.

This fixes a segfault when processing DWARF callgraphs in 'perf report'.
