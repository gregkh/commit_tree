btrfs: do not leak reloc root if we fail to read the fs root

If we fail to read the fs root corresponding with a reloc root we'll
just break out and free the reloc roots.  But we remove our current
reloc_root from this list higher up, which means we'll leak this
reloc_root.  Fix this by adding ourselves back to the reloc_roots list
so we are properly cleaned up.
