power: supply: cpcap-battery: Check voltage before orderly_poweroff

We can get the low voltage interrupt trigger sometimes way too early,
maybe because of CPU load spikes. This causes orderly_poweroff() be
called too easily.

Let's check the voltage before orderly_poweroff in case it was not
yet a permanent condition. We will be getting more interrupts anyways
if the condition persists.

Let's also show the measured voltages for low battery and battery
empty warnings since we have them.
