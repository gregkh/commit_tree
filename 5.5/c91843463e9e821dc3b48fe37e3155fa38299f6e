 This test and due to the discussions with Wolfram and you in this
 thread, I would actually suggest that you enable MMC_CAP_ERASE for all
 tmio variants, rather than just for this particular one.

 In other words, set the cap in tmio_mmc_host_probe() should be fine,
 as it seems none of the tmio variants supports HW busy detection at
 this point.

Testing on R-Car H3ULCB-KF doesn't reveal any issues (v5.4-rc7):
