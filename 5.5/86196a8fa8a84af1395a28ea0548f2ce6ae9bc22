scsi: qla2xxx: Use explicit LOGO in target mode

Target makes implicit LOGO on session teardown. LOGO ELS is not send on the
wire and initiator is not aware that target no longer wants talking to
it. Initiator keeps sending I/O requests, target responds with BA_RJT, they
time out and then initiator sends ABORT TASK (ABTS-LS).

Current behaviour incurs unneeded I/O timeout and can be fixed for some
initiators by making explicit LOGO on session deletion.
