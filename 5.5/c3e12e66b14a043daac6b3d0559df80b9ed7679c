rtc: bd70528: Add MODULE ALIAS to autoload module

The bd70528 RTC driver is probed by MFD driver. Add MODULE_ALIAS
in order to allow udev to load the module when MFD sub-device cell
for RTC is added.

I'm not sure if this is a bugfix or feature addition but I guess
fixes tag won't harm in this case.
