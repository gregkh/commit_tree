staging: octeon: indent with tabs instead of spaces

Remove a coding style error from the Octeon driver's tree and keep
checkpatch.pl a little quieter.

Being a white-spaces patch the chances of breakage are minimal; we don't
have the hardware to run this driver so we built it with COMPILE_TEST
enabled on an x86 machine.
