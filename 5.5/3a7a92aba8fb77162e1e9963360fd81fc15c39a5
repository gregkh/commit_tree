drm/i915/execlists: Force preemption

If the preempted context takes too long to relinquish control, e.g. it
is stuck inside a shader with arbitration disabled, evict that context
with an engine reset. This ensures that preemptions are reasonably
responsive, providing a tighter QoS for the more important context at
the cost of flagging unresponsive contexts more frequently (i.e. instead
of using an ~10s hangcheck, we now evict at ~100ms).  The challenge of
lies in picking a timeout that can be reasonably serviced by HW for
typical workloads, balancing the existing clients against the needs for
responsiveness.

Note that coupled with timeslicing, this will lead to rapid GPU "hang"
detection with multiple active contexts vying for GPU time.

The forced preemption mechanism can be compiled out with

	./scripts/config --set-val DRM_I915_PREEMPT_TIMEOUT 0
