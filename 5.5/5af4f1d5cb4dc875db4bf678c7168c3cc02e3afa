tpm_tis: override durations for STM tpm with firmware 1.2.8.28

There was revealed a bug in the STM TPM chipset used in Dell R415s.
Bug is observed so far only on chipset firmware 1.2.8.28
(1.2 TPM, device-id 0x0, rev-id 78). After some number of
operations chipset hangs and stays in inconsistent state:

tpm_tis 00:09: Operation Timed out
tpm_tis 00:09: tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error -5

Durations returned by the chip are the same like on other
firmware revisions but apparently with specifically 1.2.8.28 fw
durations should be reset to 2 minutes to enable tpm chip work
properly. No working way of updating firmware was found.

This patch adds implementation of ->update_durations method
that matches only STM devices with specific firmware version.
