omap: pdata-quirks: remove openpandora quirks for mmc3 and wl1251

With a wl1251 child node of mmc3 in the device tree decoded
in omap_hsmmc.c to handle special wl1251 initialization, we do
no longer need to instantiate the mmc3 through pdata quirks.

We also can remove the wlan regulator and reset/interrupt definitions
and do them through device tree.
