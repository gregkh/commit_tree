bpf: Add array support to btf_struct_access

This patch adds array support to btf_struct_access().
It supports array of int, array of struct and multidimensional
array.

It also allows using u8[] as a scratch space.  For example,
it allows access the "char cb[48]" with size larger than
the array's element "char".  Another potential use case is
"u64 icsk_ca_priv[]" in the tcp congestion control.

btf_resolve_size() is added to resolve the size of any type.
It will follow the modifier if there is any.  Please
see the function comment for details.

This patch also adds the "off < moff" check at the beginning
of the for loop.  It is to reject cases when "off" is pointing
to a "hole" in a struct.
