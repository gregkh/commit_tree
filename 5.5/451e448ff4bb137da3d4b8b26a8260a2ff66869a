s390/bpf: Use lgrl instead of lg where possible

lg and lgrl have the same performance characteristics, but the former
requires a base register and is subject to long displacement range
limits, while the latter does not. Therefore, lgrl is totally superior
to lg and should be used instead whenever possible.
