xen/events: remove event handling recursion detection

__xen_evtchn_do_upcall() contains guards against being called
recursively. This mechanism was introduced in the early pvops times
(kernel 2.6.26) when there were all the Xen backend drivers missing
from the upstream kernel, and some of those out-of-tree drivers were
enabling interrupts in their event handlers (which was explicitly
allowed in the initial XenoLinux).

Nowadays we don't need to support those old drivers any more and the
capability to allow recursive calls of __xen_evtchn_do_upcall() can
be removed.
