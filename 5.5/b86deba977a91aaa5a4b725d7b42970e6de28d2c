RDMA/core: Move core content from ib_uverbs to ib_core

Move functionality that is called by the driver, which is
related to umap, to a new file that will be linked in ib_core.
This is a first step in later enabling ib_uverbs to be optional.
vm_ops is now initialized in ib_uverbs_mmap instead of
priv_init to avoid having to move all the rdma_umap functions
as well.
