arm64: simplify syscall wrapper ifdeffery

Back in commit:

  4378a7d4be30ec69 ("arm64: implement syscall wrappers")

... I implemented the arm64 syscall wrapper glue following the approach
taken on x86. While doing so, I also copied across some ifdeffery that
isn't necessary on arm64.

On arm64 we don't share any of the native wrappers with compat tasks,
and unlike x86 we don't have alternative implementations of
SYSCALL_DEFINE0(), COND_SYSCALL(), or SYS_NI() defined when AArch32
compat support is enabled.

Thus we don't need to prevent multiple definitions of these macros, and
can remove the #ifndef ... #endif guards protecting them. If any of
these had been previously defined elsewhere, syscalls are unlikely to
work correctly, and we'd want the compiler to warn about the multiple
definitions.
