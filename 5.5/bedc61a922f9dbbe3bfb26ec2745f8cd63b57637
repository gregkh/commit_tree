Drivers: hv: vmbus: Introduce table of VMBus protocol versions

The technique used to get the next VMBus version seems increasisly
clumsy as the number of VMBus versions increases.  Performance is
not a concern since this is only done once during system boot; it's
just that we'll end up with more lines of code than is really needed.

As an alternative, introduce a table with the version numbers listed
in order (from the most recent to the oldest).  vmbus_connect() loops
through the versions listed in the table until it gets an accepted
connection or gets to the end of the table (invalid version).
