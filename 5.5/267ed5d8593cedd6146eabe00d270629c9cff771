perf affinity: Add infrastructure to save/restore affinity

The kernel perf subsystem has to IPI to the target CPU for many
operations. On systems with many CPUs and when managing many events the
overhead can be dominated by lots of IPIs.

An alternative is to set up CPU affinity in the perf tool, then set up
all the events for that CPU, and then move on to the next CPU.

Add some affinity management infrastructure to enable such a model.
Used in followon patches.

Committer notes:

Use zfree() in some places, add missing stdbool.h header, some minor
coding style changes.
