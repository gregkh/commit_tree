perf hist: Support block formats with compare/sort/display

This patch provides helper routines to support new columns for block
info output.

The new columns are:

  Sampled Cycles%
  Sampled Cycles
  Avg Cycles%
  Avg Cycles
  [Program Block Range]
  Shared Object

 v5:
 ---
 1. Move more block related functions from builtin-report.c to
    block-info.c

 2. Set ms (map+sym) in block hist_entry. Because this info
    is needed for reporting the block range (i.e. source line)

Committer notes:

Remove unused set_fmt() function, some build were not completing with:

  util/block-info.c:396:20: error: unused function 'set_fmt' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
  static inline void set_fmt(struct block_fmt *block_fmt,
                     ^
  1 error generated.
