arm64: KVM: Invoke compute_layout() before alternatives are applied

compute_layout() is invoked as part of an alternative fixup under
stop_machine(). This function invokes get_random_long() which acquires a
sleeping lock on -RT which can not be acquired in this context.

Rename compute_layout() to kvm_compute_layout() and invoke it before
stop_machine() applies the alternatives. Add a __init prefix to
kvm_compute_layout() because the caller has it, too (and so the code can be
discarded after boot).
