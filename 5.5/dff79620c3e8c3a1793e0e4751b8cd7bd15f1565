net: dsa: sja1105: Replace sja1105_spi_send_int with sja1105_xfer_{u32, u64}

Having a function that takes a variable number of unpacked bytes which
it generically calls an "int" is confusing and makes auditing patches
next to impossible.

We only use spi_send_int with the int sizes of 32 and 64 bits. So just
make the spi_send_int function less generic and replace it with the
appropriate two explicit functions, which can now type-check the int
pointer type.

Note that there is still a small weirdness in the u32 function, which
has to convert it to a u64 temporary. This is because of how the packing
API works at the moment, but the weirdness is at least hidden from
callers of sja1105_xfer_u32 now.
