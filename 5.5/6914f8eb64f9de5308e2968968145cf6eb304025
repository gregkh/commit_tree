drm: Add high-precision time to vblank trace event

Store the timestamp of the current vblank in the new field 'time' of the
vblank trace event. If the timestamp is calculated by a driver that
supports high-precision vblank timing, set the field 'high-prec' to
'true'.

User space can now access actual hardware vblank times via the tracing
infrastructure. Tracing applications (such as GPUVis, see [0] for
related discussion), can use the newly added information to conduct a
more accurate analysis of display timing.
