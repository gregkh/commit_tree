mm: vmscan: harmonize writeback congestion tracking for nodes & memcgs

The current writeback congestion tracking has separate flags for kswapd
reclaim (node level) and cgroup limit reclaim (memcg-node level).  This is
unnecessarily complicated: the lruvec is an existing abstraction layer for
that node-memcg intersection.

Introduce lruvec->flags and LRUVEC_CONGESTED.  Then track that at the
reclaim root level, which is either the NUMA node for global reclaim, or
the cgroup-node intersection for cgroup reclaim.
