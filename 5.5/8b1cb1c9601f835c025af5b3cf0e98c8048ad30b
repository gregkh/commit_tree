selftest/bpf: Add relocatable bitfield reading tests

Add a bunch of selftests verifying correctness of relocatable bitfield reading
support in libbpf. Both bpf_probe_read()-based and direct read-based bitfield
macros are tested. core_reloc.c "test_harness" is extended to support raw
tracepoint and new typed raw tracepoints as test BPF program types.
