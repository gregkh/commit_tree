regulator: ab8500: Remove SYSCLKREQ from enum ab8505_regulator_id

Those regulators are not actually supported by the AB8500 regulator
driver. There is no ab8500_regulator_info for them and no entry in
ab8505_regulator_match.

As such, they cannot be registered successfully, and looking them
up in ab8505_regulator_match causes an out-of-bounds array read.
