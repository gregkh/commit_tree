jbd2: Account descriptor blocks into t_outstanding_credits

Currently, journal descriptor blocks were not accounted in
transaction->t_outstanding_credits and we were just leaving some slack
space in the journal for them (in jbd2_log_space_left() and
jbd2_space_needed()). This is making proper accounting (and reservation
we want to add) of descriptor blocks difficult so switch to accounting
descriptor blocks in transaction->t_outstanding_credits and just reserve
the same amount of credits in t_outstanding credits for journal
descriptor blocks when creating transaction.
