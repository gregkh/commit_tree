splice: only read in as much information as there is pipe buffer space

Andreas Grünbacher reports that on the two filesystems that support
iomap directio, it's possible for splice() to return -EAGAIN (instead of
a short splice) if the pipe being written to has less space available in
its pipe buffers than the length supplied by the calling process.

Months ago we fixed splice_direct_to_actor to clamp the length of the
read request to the size of the splice pipe.  Do the same to do_splice.
