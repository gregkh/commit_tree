fsnotify/fdinfo: exportfs_encode_inode_fh() takes pointer as 4th argument

The call to exportfs_encode_inode_fh() takes an pointer
as the 4th argument, so replace the integer 0 with the
NULL pointer.

This fixes the following sparse warning:

fs/notify/fdinfo.c:53:87: warning: Using plain integer as NULL pointer
