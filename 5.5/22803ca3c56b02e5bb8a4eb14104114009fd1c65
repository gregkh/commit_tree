regulator: tps65132: switch to using devm_fwnode_gpiod_get()

devm_fwnode_get_index_gpiod_from_child() is going away as the name is
too unwieldy, let's switch to using the new devm_fwnode_gpiod_get().

Note that we no longer need to check for NULL as devm_fwnode_gpiod_get()
will return -ENOENT if GPIO is missing.
