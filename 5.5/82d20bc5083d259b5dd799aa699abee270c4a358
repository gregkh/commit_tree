staging: vchiq: don't print pointless kernel address

Since commit ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p"),
an obfuscated kernel pointer is printed at boot:

    vchiq: vchiq_init_state: slot_zero = (____ptrval____)

Remove the the print completely, as it's useless without the address.
