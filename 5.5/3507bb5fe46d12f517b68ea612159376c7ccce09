ASoC: intel: skl-pcm: remove snd_pcm_ops

snd_pcm_ops is no longer needed.
Let's use component driver callback.

*Note*

Only Intel skl-pcm has .get_time_info implementation, but ALSA SoC
framework doesn't call it so far.
To keep its implementation, this patch keeps .get_time_info,
but it is still not called.
Intel guy need to support it in the future.
