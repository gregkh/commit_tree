kernfs: convert kernfs_node->id from union kernfs_node_id to u64

kernfs_node->id is currently a union kernfs_node_id which represents
either a 32bit (ino, gen) pair or u64 value.  I can't see much value
in the usage of the union - all that's needed is a 64bit ID which the
current code is already limited to.  Using a union makes the code
unnecessarily complicated and prevents using 64bit ino without adding
practical benefits.

This patch drops union kernfs_node_id and makes kernfs_node->id a u64.
ino is stored in the lower 32bits and gen upper.  Accessors -
kernfs[_id]_ino() and kernfs[_id]_gen() - are added to retrieve the
ino and gen.  This simplifies ID handling less cumbersome and will
allow using 64bit inos on supported archs.

This patch doesn't make any functional changes.
