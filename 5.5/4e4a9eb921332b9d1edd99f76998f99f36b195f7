mm/rmap.c: reuse mergeable anon_vma as parent when fork

In __anon_vma_prepare(), we will try to find anon_vma if it is possible to
reuse it.  While on fork, the logic is different.

Since commit 5beb49305251 ("mm: change anon_vma linking to fix
multi-process server scalability issue"), function anon_vma_clone() tries
to allocate new anon_vma for child process.  But the logic here will
allocate a new anon_vma for each vma, even in parent this vma is mergeable
and share the same anon_vma with its sibling.  This may do better for
scalability issue, while it is not necessary to do so especially after
interval tree is used.

Commit 7a3ef208e662 ("mm: prevent endless growth of anon_vma hierarchy")
tries to reuse some anon_vma by counting child anon_vma and attached vmas.
While for those mergeable anon_vmas, we can just reuse it and not
necessary to go through the logic.

After this change, kernel build test reduces 20% anon_vma allocation.

Do the same kernel build test, it shows run time in sys reduced 11.6%.
