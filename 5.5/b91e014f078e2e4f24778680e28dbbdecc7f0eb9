bpf: Make BPF trampoline use register_ftrace_direct() API

Make BPF trampoline attach its generated assembly code to kernel functions via
register_ftrace_direct() API. It helps ftrace-based tracers co-exist with BPF
trampoline on the same kernel function. It also switches attaching logic from
arch specific text_poke to generic ftrace that is available on many
architectures. text_poke is still necessary for bpf-to-bpf attach and for
bpf_tail_call optimization.
