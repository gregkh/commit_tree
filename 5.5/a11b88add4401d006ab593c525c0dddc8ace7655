thunderbolt: Add bandwidth management for Display Port tunnels

Titan Ridge supports Display Port 1.4 which adds HBR3 (High Bit Rate)
rates that may be up to 8.1 Gb/s over 4 lanes. This translates to
effective data bandwidth of 25.92 Gb/s (as 8/10 encoding is removed by
the DP adapters when going over Thunderbolt fabric). If another high
rate monitor is connected we may need to reduce the bandwidth it
consumes so that it fits into the total 40 Gb/s available on the
Thunderbolt fabric.
