tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Auto mode for CLX

There is an expectation in the CLX platform for SST base-freq feature that
Scaling min frequency be different for high and low priority cores.
This is the way the firmware will understand the priority.

So this change will look at high priority and low priority cores, and set
scaling_min_freq to P1High for high priority cores and P1Low to low
priority cores.
