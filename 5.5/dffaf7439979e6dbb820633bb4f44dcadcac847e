spi: zynq-qspi: Clarify the select chip function

The code used to assert and de-assert a chip select line is very
complicated for no reason. Simplify the logic by either setting or
resetting the concerned bit, which actually only changes an electrical
state.

Update the comment to reflect that there is no possibility to actually
choose a CS as the default (CS0) will be driven in any case.
