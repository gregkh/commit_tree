ASoC: adau7118: Fix example warning

The ADAU7118 has an example where the codec has an i2c address of 14, and
the unit address set to 14 as well.

However, while the address is expressed in decimal, the unit-address is
supposed to be in hexadecimal, which ends up with two different addresses
that trigger a DTC warning. Fix this by setting the address to 0x14.
