Fix root mounting with no mount options

The "trivial conversion" in commit cccaa5e33525 ("init: use do_mount()
instead of ksys_mount()") was totally broken, since it didn't handle the
case of a NULL mount data pointer.  And while I had "tested" it (and
presumably Dominik had too) that bug was hidden by me having options.
