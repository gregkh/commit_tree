clk: tegra: clk-super: Add restore-context support

This patch implements restore_context for clk_super_mux and clk_super.

During system supend, core power goes off the and context of Tegra
CAR registers is lost.

So on system resume, context of super clock registers are restored
to have them in same state as before suspend.
