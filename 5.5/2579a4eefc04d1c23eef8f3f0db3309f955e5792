x86/ioapic: Rename misnamed functions

ioapic_irqd_[un]mask() are misnomers as both functions do way more than
masking and unmasking the interrupt line. Both deal with the moving the
affinity of the interrupt within interrupt context. The mask/unmask is just
a tiny part of the functionality.

Rename them to ioapic_prepare/finish_move(), fixup the call sites and
rename the related variables in the code to reflect what this is about.

No functional change.
