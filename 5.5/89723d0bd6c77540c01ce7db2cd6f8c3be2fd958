io_uring: enable optimized link handling for IORING_OP_POLL_ADD

As introduced by commit:

ba816ad61fdf ("io_uring: run dependent links inline if possible")

enable inline dependent link running for poll commands.
io_poll_complete_work() is the most important change, as it allows a
linked sequence of { POLL, READ } (for example) to proceed inline
instead of needing to get punted to another async context. The
submission side only potentially matters for sqthread, but may as well
include that bit.
