fgraph: Fix function type mismatches of ftrace_graph_return using ftrace_stub

The C compiler is allowing more checks to make sure that function pointers
are assigned to the correct prototype function. Unfortunately, the function
graph tracer uses a special name with its assigned ftrace_graph_return
function pointer that maps to a stub function used by the function tracer
(ftrace_stub). The ftrace_graph_return variable is compared to the
ftrace_stub in some archs to know if the function graph tracer is enabled or
not. This means we can not just simply create a new function stub that
compares it without modifying all the archs.

Instead, have the linker script create a function_graph_stub that maps to
ftrace_stub, and this way we can define the prototype for it to match the
prototype of ftrace_graph_return, and make the compiler checks all happy!
