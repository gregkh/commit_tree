drm/i915: Drop assertion that ce->pin_mutex guards state updates

The actual conditions are that we know the GPU is not accessing the
context, and we hold a pin on the context image to allow CPU access. We
used a fake lock on ce->pin_mutex so that we could try and use lockdep
to assert that access is serialised, but the various different
hardirq/softirq contexts where we need to *fake* holding the pin_mutex
are causing more trouble.

Still it would be nice if we did have a way to reassure ourselves that
the direct update to the context image is serialised with GPU execution.
In the meantime, stop lockdep complaining about false irq inversions.
