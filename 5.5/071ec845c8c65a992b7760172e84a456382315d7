Input: apanel - switch to using polled mode of input devices

We have added polled mode to the normal input devices with the intent of
retiring input_polled_dev. This converts apanel driver to use the polling
mode of standard input devices and removes dependency on INPUT_POLLDEV.

While at it, let's convert the driver to use devm.
