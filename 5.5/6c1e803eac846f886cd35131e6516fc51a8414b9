scsi: lpfc: Fix kernel crash at lpfc_nvme_info_show during remote port bounce

When reading sysfs nvme_info file while a remote port leaves and comes
back, a NULL pointer is encountered. The issue is due to ndlp list
corruption as the the nvme_info_show does not use the same lock as the rest
of the code.

Correct by removing the rcu_xxx_lock calls and replace by the host_lock and
phba->hbaLock spinlocks that are used by the rest of the driver.  Given
we're called from sysfs, we are safe to use _irq rather than _irqsave.
