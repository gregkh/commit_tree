scsi: ufs: Fix error handing during hibern8 enter

During clock gating (ufshcd_gate_work()), we first put the link hibern8 by
calling ufshcd_uic_hibern8_enter() and if ufshcd_uic_hibern8_enter()
returns success (0) then we gate all the clocks.  Now letâ€™s zoom in to what
ufshcd_uic_hibern8_enter() does internally: It calls
__ufshcd_uic_hibern8_enter() and if failure is encountered, link recovery
shall put the link back to the highest HS gear and returns success (0) to
ufshcd_uic_hibern8_enter() which is the issue as link is still in active
state due to recovery!  Now ufshcd_uic_hibern8_enter() returns success to
ufshcd_gate_work() and hence it goes ahead with gating the UFS clock while
link is still in active state hence I believe controller would raise UIC
error interrupts. But when we service the interrupt, clocks might have
already been disabled!

This change fixes for this by returning failure from
__ufshcd_uic_hibern8_enter() if recovery succeeds as link is still not in
hibern8, upon receiving the error ufshcd_hibern8_enter() would initiate
retry to put the link state back into hibern8.
