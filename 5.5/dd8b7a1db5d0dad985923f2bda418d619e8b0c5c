Revert "serial: core: Use cons->index for preferred console registration"

This reverts commit 91daae03188e0dd1da3c1b599df4ce7539d5a69f.

The origin patch is causing an issue on r8a7791/koelsch and
r8a7795/salvator-xs platforms where cons->index is not initialized to
expected value.
It is safer to revert this patch for now till it is clear why this is
happening.
