staging: iio: adc: ad7192: Add system calibration support

This patch will add a system calibration attribute for each channel. Using
this option the user will have the ability to calibrate each channel for
zero scale and full scale. It uses the iio_chan_spec_ext_info and IIO_ENUM
to implement the functionality.
