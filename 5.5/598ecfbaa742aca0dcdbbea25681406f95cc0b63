iomap: lift the xfs writeback code to iomap

Take the xfs writeback code and move it to fs/iomap.  A new structure
with three methods is added as the abstraction from the generic writeback
code to the file system.  These methods are used to map blocks, submit an
ioend, and cancel a page that encountered an error before it was added to
an ioend.
