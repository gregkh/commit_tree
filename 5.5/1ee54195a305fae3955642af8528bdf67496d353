xen/interface: re-define FRONT/BACK_RING_ATTACH()

Currently these macros are defined to re-initialize a front/back ring
(respectively) to values read from the shared ring in such a way that any
requests/responses that are added to the shared ring whilst the front/back
is detached will be skipped over. This, in general, is not a desirable
semantic since most frontend implementations will eventually block waiting
for a response which would either never appear or never be processed.

Since the macros are currently unused, take this opportunity to re-define
them to re-initialize a front/back ring using specified values. This also
allows FRONT/BACK_RING_INIT() to be re-defined in terms of
FRONT/BACK_RING_ATTACH() using a specified value of 0.

NOTE: BACK_RING_ATTACH() will be used directly in a subsequent patch.
