usb: typec: ucsi: acpi: Move to the new API

Replacing the old "cmd" and "sync" callbacks with an
implementation of struct ucsi_operations. The ACPI
notification (interrupt) handler will from now on read the
CCI (Command Status and Connector Change Indication)
register, and call ucsi_connector_change() function and/or
complete pending command completions based on it.
