net: ethernet: ti: cpsw: fix extra rx interrupt

Now RX interrupt is triggered twice every time, because in
cpsw_rx_interrupt() it is asked first and then disabled. So there will be
pending interrupt always, when RX interrupt is enabled again in NAPI
handler.

Fix it by first disabling IRQ and then do ask.
