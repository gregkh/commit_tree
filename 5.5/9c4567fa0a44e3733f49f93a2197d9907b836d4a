USB: host: ohci-at91: completely shutdown the controller in at91_stop_hc()

When removing the ohci-at91 module, the fact of not running complete shutdown
of all the ports was keeping additional analog cells consuming power for no
reason.
Doing Reset (OHCI_HCR) to HcCommandStatus register is the way to go, but using
the OHCI controller shutdown procedure is just perfect for this.
