ARM: 8955/1: virt: Relax arch timer version check during early boot

Updates to the Generic Timer architecture allow ID_PFR1.GenTimer to
have values other than 0 or 1 while still preserving backward
compatibility. At the moment, Linux is quite strict in the way it
handles this field at early boot and will not configure arch timer if
it doesn't find the value 1.

Since here use ubfx for arch timer version extraction (hyb-stub build
with -march=armv7-a, so it is safe)

To help backports (even though the code was correct at the time of writing)
