vfio/pci: call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() before freeing irq

Since irq_bypass_register_producer() is called after request_irq(), we
should do tear-down in reverse order: irq_bypass_unregister_producer()
then free_irq().

Specifically free_irq() may release resources required by the
irqbypass del_producer() callback.  Notably an example provided by
Marc Zyngier on arm64 with GICv4 that he indicates has the potential
to wedge the hardware:

 free_irq(irq)
   __free_irq(irq)
     irq_domain_deactivate_irq(irq)
       its_irq_domain_deactivate()
         [unmap the VLPI from the ITS]

 kvm_arch_irq_bypass_del_producer(cons, prod)
   kvm_vgic_v4_unset_forwarding(kvm, irq, ...)
     its_unmap_vlpi(irq)
       [Unmap the VLPI from the ITS (again), remap the original LPI]
