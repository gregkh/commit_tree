efi/earlycon: Fix write-combine mapping on x86

On x86, until PAT is initialized, WC translates into UC-. Since we
calculate and store pgprot_writecombine(PAGE_KERNEL) when earlycon is
initialized, this means we actually use UC- mappings instead of WC
mappings, which makes scrolling very slow.

Instead store a boolean flag to indicate whether we want to use
writeback or write-combine mappings, and recalculate the actual pgprot_t
we need on every mapping. Once PAT is initialized, we will start using
write-combine mappings, which speeds up the scrolling considerably.
