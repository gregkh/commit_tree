ALSA: compress: add flac decoder params

The current design of sending codec parameters assumes that decoders
will have parsers so they can parse the encoded stream for parameters
and configure the decoder.

But this assumption may not be universally true and we know some DSPs
which do not contain the parsers so additional parameters are required
to be passed.

So add these parameters starting with FLAC decoder. The size of
snd_codec_options is still 120 bytes after this change (due to this
being a union)
