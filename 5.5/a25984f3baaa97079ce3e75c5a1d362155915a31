RDMA/qedr: Fix null-pointer dereference when calling rdma_user_mmap_get_offset

When running against rdma-core that doesn't support doorbell recovery, the
rdma_user_mmap_entry won't be allocated for doorbell recovery related
mappings.

We have a flag indicating whether rdma-core supports doorbell recovery or
not which was used during initialization, however some cases didn't check
that the rdma_user_mmap_entry exists before attempting to acquire it's
offset.
