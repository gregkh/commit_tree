net: phy: dp83869: fix return of uninitialized variable ret

In the case where the call to phy_interface_is_rgmii returns zero
the variable ret is left uninitialized and this is returned at
the end of the function dp83869_configure_rgmii.  Fix this by
returning 0 instead of the uninitialized value in ret.
