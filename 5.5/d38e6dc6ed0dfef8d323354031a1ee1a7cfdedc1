rcutorture: Force on tick for readers and callback flooders

Readers and callback flooders in the rcutorture stress-test suite run for
extended time periods by design.  They do take pains to relinquish the
CPU from time to time, but in some cases this relies on the scheduler
being active, which in turn relies on the scheduler-clock interrupt
firing from time to time.

This commit therefore forces scheduling-clock interrupts within
these loops.  While in the area, this commit also prevents
rcu_torture_reader()'s occasional timed sleeps from delaying shutdown.
