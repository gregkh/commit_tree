net/mlx5e: ethtool, Fix analysis of speed setting

When setting speed to 100G via ethtool (AN is set to off), only 25G*4 is
configured while the user, who has an advanced HW which supports
extended PTYS, expects also 50G*2 to be configured.
With this patch, when extended PTYS mode is available, configure
PTYS via extended fields.
