mmc: sdhci: fix minimum clock rate for v3 controller

For SDHCIv3+ with programmable clock mode, minimal clock frequency is
still base clock / max(divider). Minimal programmable clock frequency is
always greater than minimal divided clock frequency. Without this patch,
SDHCI uses out-of-spec initial frequency when multiplier is big enough:

mmc1: mmc_rescan_try_freq: trying to init card at 468750 Hz
[for 480 MHz source clock divided by 1024]

The code in sdhci_calc_clk() already chooses a correct SDCLK clock mode.
