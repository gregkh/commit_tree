libbpf: Fix error handling in bpf_map__reuse_fd()

bpf_map__reuse_fd() was calling close() in the error path before returning
an error value based on errno. However, close can change errno, so that can
lead to potentially misleading error messages. Instead, explicitly store
errno in the err variable before each goto.
