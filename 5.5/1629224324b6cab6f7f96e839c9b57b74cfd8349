drm/i915/lmem: add the fake lmem region

Intended for upstream testing so that we can still exercise the LMEM
plumbing and !i915_ggtt_has_aperture paths. Smoke tested on Skull Canyon
device. This works by allocating an intel_memory_region for a reserved
portion of system memory, which we treat like LMEM. For the LMEMBAR we
steal the aperture and 1:1 it map to the stolen region.

To enable simply set the i915 modparam fake_lmem_start= on the kernel
cmdline with the start of reserved region(see memmap=). The size of the
region we can use is determined by the size of the mappable aperture, so
the size of reserved region should be >= mappable_end. For now we only
enable for the selftests. Depends on CONFIG_DRM_I915_UNSTABLE being
enabled.

eg. memmap=2G$16G i915.fake_lmem_start=0x400000000

v2: make fake_lmem_start an i915 modparam
