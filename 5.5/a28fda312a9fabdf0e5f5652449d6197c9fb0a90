drm/amdgpu: Avoid accidental thread reactivation.

Problem:
During GPU reset we call the GPU scheduler to suspend it's
thread, those two functions in amdgpu also suspend and resume
the sceduler for their needs but this can collide with GPU
reset in progress and accidently restart a suspended thread
before time.

Fix:
Serialize with GPU reset.
