ASoC: Fix NULL dereference at freeing

When an ASoC driver with pcm_destruct component ops is freed before
the PCM object instantiation (e.g. deferring the probe), it hits an
Oops at snd_soc_pcm_component_free() that calls the pcm_destruct ops
unconditionally.

Fix it by adding a NULL-check of rtd->pcm before calling callbacks.
