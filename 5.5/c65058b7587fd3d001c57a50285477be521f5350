crypto: skcipher - remove the "blkcipher" algorithm type

Now that all "blkcipher" algorithms have been converted to "skcipher",
remove the blkcipher algorithm type.

The skcipher (symmetric key cipher) algorithm type was introduced a few
years ago to replace both blkcipher and ablkcipher (synchronous and
asynchronous block cipher).  The advantages of skcipher include:

  - A much less confusing name, since none of these algorithm types have
    ever actually been for raw block ciphers, but rather for all
    length-preserving encryption modes including block cipher modes of
    operation, stream ciphers, and other length-preserving modes.

  - It unified blkcipher and ablkcipher into a single algorithm type
    which supports both synchronous and asynchronous implementations.
    Note, blkcipher already operated only on scatterlists, so the fact
    that skcipher does too isn't a regression in functionality.

  - Better type safety by using struct skcipher_alg, struct
    crypto_skcipher, etc. instead of crypto_alg, crypto_tfm, etc.

  - It sometimes simplifies the implementations of algorithms.

Also, the blkcipher API was no longer being tested.
