Revert "selftests: Fix O= and KBUILD_OUTPUT handling for relative paths"

This reverts commit 303e6218ecec475d5bc3e5922dec770ee5baf107.

This patch breaks several CI use-cases that run kselftest builds
without using main Makefile. This fix depends on abs_objtree which
is undefined when kselftest build is invoked on selftests Makefile
without going through the main Makefile.

Revert this for now as this patch impacts selftest runs.
