affs: fix a memory leak in affs_remount

In affs_remount if data is provided it is duplicated into new_opts.  The
allocated memory for new_opts is only released if parse_options fails.

There's a bit of history behind new_options, originally there was
save/replace options on the VFS layer so the 'data' passed must not
change (thus strdup), this got cleaned up in later patches. But not
completely.

There's no reason to do the strdup in cases where the filesystem does
not need to reuse the 'data' again, because strsep would modify it
directly.
