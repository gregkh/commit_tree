iwlwifi: mvm: don't send the IWL_MVM_RXQ_NSSN_SYNC notif to Rx queues

The purpose of this was to keep all the queues updated with
the Rx sequence numbers because unlikely yet possible
situations where queues can't understand if a specific
packet needs to be dropped or not.

Unfortunately, it was reported that this caused issues in
our DMA engine. We don't fully understand how this is related,
but this is being currently debugged. For now, just don't send
this notification to the Rx queues. This de-facto reverts my
commit 3c514bf831ac12356b695ff054bef641b9e99593:

iwlwifi: mvm: add a loose synchronization of the NSSN across Rx queues

This issue was reported here:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205001
and others maybe.
