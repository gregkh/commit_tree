habanalabs: make the reset code more consistent

In the hl_device_reset we ask about the hard_reset argument when we want to
differentiate between soft and hard reset, except for three places where
we use "from_hard_reset_thread". Replace one of those locations with the
hard_reset argument as it is guaranteed that if we reached to that
line in the code during hard_reset, it is from a kernel thread.
