libbpf: Fix passing uninitialized bytes to setsockopt

'struct xdp_umem_reg' has 4 bytes of padding at the end that makes
valgrind complain about passing uninitialized stack memory to the
syscall:

  Syscall param socketcall.setsockopt() points to uninitialised byte(s)
    at 0x4E7AB7E: setsockopt (in /usr/lib64/libc-2.29.so)
    by 0x4BDE035: xsk_umem__create@@LIBBPF_0.0.4 (xsk.c:172)
  Uninitialised value was created by a stack allocation
    at 0x4BDDEBA: xsk_umem__create@@LIBBPF_0.0.4 (xsk.c:140)

Padding bytes appeared after introducing of a new 'flags' field.
memset() is required to clear them.
