pinctrl: at91: Pass irqchip when adding gpiochip

We need to convert all old gpio irqchips to pass the irqchip
setup along when adding the gpio_chip. For more info see
drivers/gpio/TODO.

For chained irqchips this is a pretty straight-forward
conversion: at91 is a little bit special since it registers
up to 3 gpio_chips with the same parent handler, but just
passing girq->parent_handler and the parent on the first
of them should cut it.
