soc: renesas: Add ARCH_R8A77960 for existing R-Car M3-W

Add CONFIG_ARCH_R8A77960 as a new config symbol for R-Car M3-W
(R8A77960), to replace CONFIG_ARCH_R8A7796, and avoid confusion with
R-Car M3-W+ (R8A77961), which will use CONFIG_ARCH_R8A77961.

Note that for now, CONFIG_ARCH_R8A7796 is retained, and just selects
CONFIG_ARCH_R8A77960.  This relaxes dependencies of other subsystems on
the SoC configuration symbol, and provides a smooth transition path for
config files through "make oldconfig".
