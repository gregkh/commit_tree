libbpf: Fix bpf_object name determination for bpf_object__open_file()

If bpf_object__open_file() gets path like "some/dir/obj.o", it should derive
BPF object's name as "obj" (unless overriden through opts->object_name).
Instead, due to using `path` as a fallback value for opts->obj_name, path is
used as is for object name, so for above example BPF object's name will be
verbatim "some/dir/obj", which leads to all sorts of troubles, especially when
internal maps are concern (they are using up to 8 characters of object name).
Fix that by ensuring object_name stays NULL, unless overriden.
