net: ethernet: ave: Avoid lockdep warning

When building with PROVE_LOCKING=y, lockdep shows the following
dump message.

    INFO: trying to register non-static key.
    the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
    turning off the locking correctness validator.
     ...

Calling device_set_wakeup_enable() directly occurs this issue,
and it isn't necessary for initialization, so this patch creates
internal function __ave_ethtool_set_wol() and replaces with this
in ave_init() and ave_resume().
