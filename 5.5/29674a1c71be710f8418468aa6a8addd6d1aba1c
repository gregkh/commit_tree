powerpc/pkeys: remove unused pkey_allows_readwrite

pkey_allows_readwrite() was first introduced in the commit 5586cf61e108
("powerpc: introduce execute-only pkey"), but the usage was removed
entirely in the commit a4fcc877d4e1 ("powerpc/pkeys: Preallocate
execute-only key").

Found by the "-Wunused-function" compiler warning flag.

Fixes: a4fcc877d4e1 ("powerpc/pkeys: Preallocate execute-only key")
