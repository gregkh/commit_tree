perf probe: Fix to show function entry line as probe-able

Fix die_walk_lines() to list the function entry line correctly.  Since
the dwarf_entrypc() does not return the entry pc if the DIE has only
range attribute, __die_walk_funclines() fails to list the declaration
line (entry line) in that case.

To solve this issue, this introduces die_entrypc() which correctly
returns the entry PC (the first address range) even if the DIE has only
range attribute. With this fix die_walk_lines() shows the function entry
line is able to probe correctly.
