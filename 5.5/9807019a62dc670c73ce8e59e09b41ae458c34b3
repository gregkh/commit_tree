um: Loadable BPF "Firmware" for vector drivers

All vector drivers now allow a BPF program to be loaded and
associated with the RX socket in the host kernel.

1. The program can be loaded as an extra kernel command line
option to any of the vector drivers.

2. The program can also be loaded as "firmware", using the
ethtool flash option. It is possible to turn this facility
on or off using a command line option.

A simplistic wrapper for generating the BPF firmware for the raw
socket driver out of a tcpdump/libpcap filter expression can be
found at: https://github.com/kot-begemot-uk/uml_vector_utilities/
