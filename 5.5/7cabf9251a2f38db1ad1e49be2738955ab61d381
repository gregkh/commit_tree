bus/ti-pwmss: move TI PWMSS driver from PWM to bus subsystem

The TI PWMSS driver is a simple bus driver for providing power
power management for the PWM peripherals on TI AM33xx SoCs, namely
eCAP, eHRPWM and eQEP. The eQEP is a counter rather than a PWM, so
it does not make sense to have the bus driver in the PWM subsystem
since the PWMSS is not exclusive to PWM devices.
