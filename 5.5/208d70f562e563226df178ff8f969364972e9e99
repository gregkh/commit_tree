IB/mlx5: Support flow counters offset for bulk counters

Add support for flow steering counters action with a non-base counter
ID (offset) for bulk counters.

When creating a flow counter object, save the bulk value.  This value is
used when a flow action with a non-base counter ID is requested - to
validate that the required offset is in the range of the allocated bulk.
