serdev: Don't claim unsupported ACPI serial devices

Serdev sub-system claims all ACPI serial devices that are not already
initialised. As a result, no device node is created for serial ports
on certain boards such as the Apollo Lake based UP2. This has the
unintended consequence of not being able to raise the login prompt via
serial connection.

Introduce a blacklist to reject ACPI serial devices that should not be
claimed by serdev sub-system. Add the peripheral ids for Intel HS UART
to the blacklist to bring back serial port on SoCs carrying them.
