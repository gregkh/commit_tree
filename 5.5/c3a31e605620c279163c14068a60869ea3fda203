io_uring: add support for IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE

Allows the application to remove/replace/add files to/from a file set.
Passes in a struct:

struct io_uring_files_update {
	__u32 offset;
	__s32 *fds;
};

that holds an array of fds, size of array passed in through the usual
nr_args part of the io_uring_register() system call. The logic is as
follows:

1) If ->fds[i] is -1, the existing file at i + ->offset is removed from
   the set.
2) If ->fds[i] is a valid fd, the existing file at i + ->offset is
   replaced with ->fds[i].

For case #2, is the existing file is currently empty (fd == -1), the
new fd is simply added to the array.
