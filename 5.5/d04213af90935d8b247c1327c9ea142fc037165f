kdb: Simplify code to fetch characters from console

Currently kdb_read_get_key() contains complex control flow that, on
close inspection, turns out to be unnecessary. In particular:

1. It is impossible to enter the branch conditioned on (escape_delay == 1)
   except when the loop enters with (escape_delay == 2) allowing us to
   combine the branches.

2. Most of the code conditioned on (escape_delay == 2) simply modifies
   local data and then breaks out of the loop causing the function to
   return escape_data[0].

3. Based on #2 there is not actually any need to ever explicitly set
   escape_delay to 2 because we it is much simpler to directly return
   escape_data[0] instead.

4. escape_data[0] is, for all but one exit path, known to be '\e'.

Simplify the code based on these observations.

There is a subtle (and harmless) change of behaviour resulting from this
simplification: instead of letting the escape timeout after ~1998
milliseconds we now timeout after ~2000 milliseconds
