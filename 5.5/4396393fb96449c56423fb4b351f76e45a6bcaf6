drm/sun4i: tcon: Set RGB DCLK min. divider based on hardware model

In commit 0b8e7bbde5e7 ("drm/sun4i: tcon: Set min division of TCON0_DCLK
to 1.") it was assumed that all TCON variants support a minimum divider
of 1 if only DCLK was used.

However, the oldest generation of hardware only supports minimum divider
of 4 if only DCLK is used. If a divider of 1 was used on this old
hardware, some scrolling artifact would appear. A divider of 2 seemed
OK, but a divider of 3 had artifacts as well.

Set the minimum divider when outputing to parallel RGB based on the
hardware model, with a minimum of 4 for the oldest (A10/A10s/A13/A20)
hardware, and a minimum of 1 for the rest. A value is not set for the
TCON variants lacking channel 0.

This fixes the scrolling artifacts seen on my A13 tablet.
