ixgbe: Fix calculation of queue with VFs and flow director on interface flap

This patch fixes the calculation of queue when we restore flow director
filters after resetting adapter. In ixgbe_fdir_filter_restore(), filter's
vf may be zero which makes the queue outside of the rx_ring array.

The calculation is changed to the same as ixgbe_add_ethtool_fdir_entry().
