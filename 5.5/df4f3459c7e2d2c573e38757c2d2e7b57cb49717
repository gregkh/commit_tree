bus: ti-sysc: drop the extra hardreset during init

There seems to be unnecessary extra hardreset line toggling applied
during module init. This is unnecessary, as the reset lines are already
asserted during boot, and it can cause certain modules to hang (iommus,
remoteprocs.) Remove the extra hardreset toggle, and remove the now
redundant function to handle this also.
