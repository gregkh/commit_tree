ASoC: SOF: enable dual control for pga

Currently sof pga element supports only 1 kcontrol and you can't create
for example a mixer element with combined volume slider and mute switch.
So enable sof pga to have more than 1 kcontrol associated with it. Also
check for possible NULL tlv pointer as switch element might not have it.
