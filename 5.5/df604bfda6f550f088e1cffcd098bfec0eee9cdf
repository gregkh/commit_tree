perf trace: Hook the 'vec' tracepoint argument with the x86 IRQ vectors scnprintf/strtoul

Ended up only being useful when filtering multiple irq_vectors
tracepoints, as we end up having a tracepoint for each of the entries,
i.e.:

This will always come with the "RESCHEDULE_VECTOR" in the 'vector' arg:

  # perf trace --max-events 8 -e irq_vectors:reschedule*
     0.000 cc1/29067 irq_vectors:reschedule_entry(vector: RESCHEDULE)
     0.004 cc1/29067 irq_vectors:reschedule_exit(vector: RESCHEDULE)
     0.553 cc1/29067 irq_vectors:reschedule_entry(vector: RESCHEDULE)
     0.556 cc1/29067 irq_vectors:reschedule_exit(vector: RESCHEDULE)
     1.182 cc1/29067 irq_vectors:reschedule_entry(vector: RESCHEDULE)
     1.185 cc1/29067 irq_vectors:reschedule_exit(vector: RESCHEDULE)
     1.203 :29052/29052 irq_vectors:reschedule_entry(vector: RESCHEDULE)
     1.206 :29052/29052 irq_vectors:reschedule_exit(vector: RESCHEDULE)
  #

While filtering that value will produce nothing:

  # perf trace --max-events 8 -e irq_vectors:reschedule* --filter="vector != RESCHEDULE"
  ^C#

Maybe it'll be useful for those other tracepoints:

  # perf list irq_vectors:vector_*

  List of pre-defined events (to be used in -e):

    irq_vectors:vector_activate                        [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_alloc                           [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_alloc_managed                   [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_clear                           [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_config                          [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_deactivate                      [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_free_moved                      [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_reserve                         [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_reserve_managed                 [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_setup                           [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_teardown                        [Tracepoint event]
    irq_vectors:vector_update                          [Tracepoint event]
  #

But since we have it done, keep it.

This at least served to teach me that all those irq vectors have a entry
and an exit tracepoint that I can then use just like with
raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}, i.e. pair them, use just a
trace__irq_vectors_entry() + trace__irq_vectors_exit() and use the
'vector' arg as I use the 'syscall id' one for syscalls.

Then the default for 'perf trace' will include irq_vectors in addition
to syscalls.
