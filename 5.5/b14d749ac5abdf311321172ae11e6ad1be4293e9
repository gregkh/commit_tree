Drivers: hv: Specify receive buffer size using Hyper-V page size

The recv_buffer is used to retrieve data from the VMbus ring buffer.
VMbus ring buffers are sized based on the guest page size which
Hyper-V assumes to be 4KB. But it may be different on some
architectures. So use the Hyper-V page size to allocate the
recv_buffer and set the maximum size to receive.
