xfs: refactor cntbt lastblock scan best extent logic into helper

The cntbt lastblock scan checks the size, alignment, locality, etc.
of each free extent in the block and compares it with the current
best candidate. This logic will be reused by the upcoming optimized
cntbt algorithm, so refactor it into a separate helper. Note that
acur->diff is now initialized to -1 (unsigned) instead of 0 to
support the more granular comparison logic in the new helper.
