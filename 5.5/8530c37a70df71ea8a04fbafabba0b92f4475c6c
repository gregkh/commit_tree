btrfs: get bdev from latest_dev for dio bh_result

To remove use of extent_map::bdev we need to find a replacement, and the
latest_bdev is the only one we can use here, because inode::i_bdev and
superblock::s_bdev are NULL.

The DIO code uses bdev in two places:

* to read blocksize to perform alignment checks in
  do_blockdev_direct_IO, but we do them in btrfs code before any call to
  DIO

* in the following call chain:

  do_direct_IO
    get_more_blocks
     sdio->get_block() <-- this is btrfs_get_blocks_direct

  subsequently the map_bh->b_dev member is used in clean_bdev_aliases
  and dio_new_bio to set the bio's bdev to that of the buffer_head.
  However, because we have provided a submit function dio_bio_submit
  calls our submission function and ignores the bdev.

So it's safe to pass any valid bdev that's used within the filesystem.
