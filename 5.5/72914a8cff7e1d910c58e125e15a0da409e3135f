mtd: cfi_cmdset_0002: only check errors when ready in cfi_check_err_status()

Cypress S26K{L|S}P{128|256|512}S datasheet says that the error bits in
the status register are only valid when the "device ready" bit 7 is set.
Add the check for the device ready bit in cfi_check_err_status() as that
function isn't always called with this bit set.
