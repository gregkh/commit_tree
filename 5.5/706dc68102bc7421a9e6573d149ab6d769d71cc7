backlight: gpio: Explicitly set the direction of the GPIO

The GPIO backlight driver currently requests the line 'as is', without
acively setting its direction. This can lead to problems: if the line
is in input mode by default, we won't be able to drive it later when
updating the status and also reading its initial value doesn't make
sense for backlight setting.

Request the line 'as is' initially, so that we can read its value
without affecting it but then change the direction to output explicitly
when setting the initial brightness.

Also: check the current direction and only read the value if it's output.
