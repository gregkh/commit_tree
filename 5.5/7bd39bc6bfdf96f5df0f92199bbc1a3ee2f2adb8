firmware: arm_scmi: Fix doorbell ring logic for !CONFIG_64BIT

The logic to ring the scmi performance fastchannel ignores the
value read from the doorbell register in case of !CONFIG_64BIT.
This bug also shows up as warning with '-Wunused-but-set-variable' gcc
flag:

drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/perf.c: In function scmi_perf_fc_ring_db:
drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/perf.c:323:7: warning: variable val set but
			not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Fix the same by aligning the logic with CONFIG_64BIT as used in the
macro SCMI_PERF_FC_RING_DB().
