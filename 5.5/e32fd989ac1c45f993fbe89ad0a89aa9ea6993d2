usb: typec: ucsi: ccg: Move to the new API

Replacing the old "cmd" and "sync" callbacks with an
implementation of struct ucsi_operations. The interrupt
handler will from now on read the CCI (Command Status and
Connector Change Indication) register, and call
ucsi_connector_change() function and/or complete pending
command completions based on it.
