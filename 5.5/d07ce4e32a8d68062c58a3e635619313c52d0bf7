kdb: Avoid array subscript warnings on non-SMP builds

Recent versions of gcc (reported on gcc-7.4) issue array subscript
warnings for builds where SMP is not enabled.

kernel/debug/debug_core.c: In function 'kdb_dump_stack_on_cpu':
kernel/debug/debug_core.c:452:17: warning: array subscript is outside array
+bounds [-Warray-bounds]
     if (!(kgdb_info[cpu].exception_state & DCPU_IS_SLAVE)) {
           ~~~~~~~~~^~~~~
   kernel/debug/debug_core.c:469:33: warning: array subscript is outside array
+bounds [-Warray-bounds]
     kgdb_info[cpu].exception_state |= DCPU_WANT_BT;
   kernel/debug/debug_core.c:470:18: warning: array subscript is outside array
+bounds [-Warray-bounds]
     while (kgdb_info[cpu].exception_state & DCPU_WANT_BT)

There is no bug here but there is scope to improve the code
generation for non-SMP systems (whilst also silencing the warning).
