xfs: introduce allocation cursor data structure

Introduce a new allocation cursor data structure to encapsulate the
various states and structures used to perform an extent allocation.
This structure will eventually be used to track overall allocation
state across different search algorithms on both free space btrees.

To start, include the three btree cursors (one for the cntbt and two
for the bnobt left/right search) used by the near mode allocation
algorithm and refactor the cursor setup and teardown code into
helpers. This slightly changes cursor memory allocation patterns,
but otherwise makes no functional changes to the allocation
algorithm.
