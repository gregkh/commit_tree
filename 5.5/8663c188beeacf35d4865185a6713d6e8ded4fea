backlight: qcom-wled: Add auto string detection logic

The auto string detection algorithm checks if the current WLED
sink configuration is valid. It tries enabling every sink and
checks if the OVP fault is observed. Based on this information
it detects and enables the valid sink configuration.
Auto calibration will be triggered when the OVP fault interrupts
are seen frequently thereby it tries to fix the sink configuration.

The auto-detection also kicks in when the connected LED string
of the display-backlight malfunctions (because of damage) and
requires the damaged string to be turned off to prevent the
complete panel and/or board from being damaged.
