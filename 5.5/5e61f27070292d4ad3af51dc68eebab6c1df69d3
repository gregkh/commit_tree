libbpf: stop enforcing kern_version, populate it for users

Kernel version enforcement for kprobes/kretprobes was removed from
5.0 kernel in 6c4fc209fcf9 ("bpf: remove useless version check for prog load").
Since then, BPF programs were specifying SEC("version") just to please
libbpf. We should stop enforcing this in libbpf, if even kernel doesn't
care. Furthermore, libbpf now will pre-populate current kernel version
of the host system, in case we are still running on old kernel.

This patch also removes __bpf_object__open_xattr from libbpf.h, as
nothing in libbpf is relying on having it in that header. That function
was never exported as LIBBPF_API and even name suggests its internal
version. So this should be safe to remove, as it doesn't break ABI.
