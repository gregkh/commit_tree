io_uring: read opcode and user_data from SQE exactly once

If we defer a request, we can't be reading the opcode again. Ensure that
the user_data and opcode fields are stable. For the user_data we already
have a place for it, for the opcode we can fill a one byte hold and store
that as well. For both of them, assign them when we originally read the
SQE in io_get_sqring(). Any code that uses sqe->opcode or sqe->user_data
is switched to req->opcode and req->user_data.
