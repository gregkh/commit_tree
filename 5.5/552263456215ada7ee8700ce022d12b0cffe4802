powerpc: Fix vDSO clock_getres()

clock_getres in the vDSO library has to preserve the same behaviour
of posix_get_hrtimer_res().

In particular, posix_get_hrtimer_res() does:
    sec = 0;
    ns = hrtimer_resolution;
and hrtimer_resolution depends on the enablement of the high
resolution timers that can happen either at compile or at run time.

Fix the powerpc vdso implementation of clock_getres keeping a copy of
hrtimer_resolution in vdso data and using that directly.

Fixes: a7f290dad32e ("[PATCH] powerpc: Merge vdso's and add vdso support to 32 bits kernel")
