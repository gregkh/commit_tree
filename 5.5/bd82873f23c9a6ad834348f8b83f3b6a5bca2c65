xhci: make sure interrupts are restored to correct state

spin_unlock_irqrestore() might be called with stale flags after
reading port status, possibly restoring interrupts to a incorrect
state.

If a usb2 port just finished resuming while the port status is read
the spin lock will be temporary released and re-acquired in a separate
function. The flags parameter is passed as value instead of a pointer,
not updating flags properly before the final spin_unlock_irqrestore()
is called.
