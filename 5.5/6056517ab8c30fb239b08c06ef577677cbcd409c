drm/i915/tgl: Guard and warn if more than one eDP panel is present

On TGL+ it's possible to have PSR1 enabled in other ports besides DDIA.
PSR2 is still limited to DDIA. However currently we handle only one
instance of PSR struct. Lets guard intel_psr_init_dpcd() against
multiple eDP panels and warn about it.

v2: Reword commit message to be TGL+ only and with the info where
PSR1/PSR2 are supported (Lucas)
