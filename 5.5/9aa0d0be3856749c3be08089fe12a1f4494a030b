rtc: wilco-ec: Handle reading invalid times

If the RTC HW returns an invalid time, the rtc_year_days()
call would crash. This patch adds error logging in this
situation, and removes the tm_yday and tm_wday calculations.
These fields should not be relied upon by userspace
according to man rtc, and thus we don't need to calculate
them.
