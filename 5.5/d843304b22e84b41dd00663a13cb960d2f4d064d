Input: synaptics-rmi4 - simplify data read in rmi_f54_work

The body of the for loop is only ever run once as the second standard_report
element is never changed from its initial zero init, so the loop condition is
never satisfies after the first run. Equally the start member of the first
element is never changed from 0, so the index offset is always a constant 0.

Remove this needless obfuscation of the code and write it in a straight
forward manner.
