s390/zcrypt: handle new reply code FILTERED_BY_HYPERVISOR

This patch introduces support for a new architectured reply
code 0x8B indicating that a hypervisor layer (if any) has
rejected an ap message.

Linux may run as a guest on top of a hypervisor like zVM
or KVM. So the crypto hardware seen by the ap bus may be
restricted by the hypervisor for example only a subset like
only clear key crypto requests may be supported. Other
requests will be filtered out - rejected by the hypervisor.
The new reply code 0x8B will appear in such cases and needs
to get recognized by the ap bus and zcrypt device driver zoo.
