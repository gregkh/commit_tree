ASoC: pcm_dmaengine: Extract snd_dmaengine_pcm_refine_runtime_hwparams

When set the runtime hardware parameters, we may need to query
the capability of DMA to complete the parameters.

This patch is to Extract this operation from
dmaengine_pcm_set_runtime_hwparams function to a separate function
snd_dmaengine_pcm_refine_runtime_hwparams, that other components
which need this feature can call this function.
