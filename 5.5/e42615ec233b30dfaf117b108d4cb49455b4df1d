gpio: Use new GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION

It's hard for occasional GPIO code reader/writer to know if values 0/1
equal to IN or OUT. Use defined GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_IN and
GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_OUT to help them out.

NOTE - for gpio-amd-fch and gpio-bd9571mwv:
This commit also changes the return value for direction get to equal 1
for direction INPUT. Prior this commit these drivers might have
returned some other positive value but 1 for INPUT.
