s390/qeth: guard against runt packets

Depending on a packet's type, the RX path needs to access fields in the
packet headers and thus requires a minimum packet length.
Enforce this length when building the skb.

On the other hand a single runt packet is no reason to drop the whole
RX buffer. So just skip it, and continue processing on the next packet.
