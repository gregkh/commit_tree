crypto: s390/paes - convert to skcipher API

Convert the glue code for the S390 CPACF protected key implementations
of AES-ECB, AES-CBC, AES-XTS, and AES-CTR from the deprecated
"blkcipher" API to the "skcipher" API.  This is needed in order for the
blkcipher API to be removed.

Note: I made CTR use the same function for encryption and decryption,
since CTR encryption and decryption are identical.
