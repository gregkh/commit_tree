rtlwifi: rtl8192de: Fix missing enable interrupt flag

In commit 38506ecefab9 ("rtlwifi: rtl_pci: Start modification for
new drivers"), the flag that indicates that interrupts are enabled was
never set.

In addition, there are several places when enable/disable interrupts
were commented out are restored. A sychronize_interrupts() call is
removed.
