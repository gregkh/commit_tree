of/address: Translate 'dma-ranges' for parent nodes missing 'dma-ranges'

'dma-ranges' frequently exists without parent nodes having 'dma-ranges'.
While this is an error for 'ranges', this is fine because DMA capable
devices always have a translatable DMA address. Also, with no
'dma-ranges' at all, the assumption is that DMA addresses are 1:1 with
no restrictions unless perhaps the device itself has implicit
restrictions.
