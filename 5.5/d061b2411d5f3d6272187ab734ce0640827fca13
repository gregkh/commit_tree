bnxt_en: Do not treat DSN (Digital Serial Number) read failure as fatal.

DSN read can fail, for example on a kdump kernel without PCIe extended
config space support.  If DSN read fails, don't set the
BNXT_FLAG_DSN_VALID flag and continue loading.  Check the flag
to see if the stored DSN is valid before using it.  Only VF reps
creation should fail without valid DSN.
