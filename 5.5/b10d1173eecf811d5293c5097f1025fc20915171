drm/i915: Simplify intel_get_crtc_ycbcr_config()

Make intel_get_crtc_ycbcr_config() simpler and rename it
to bdw_get_pipemisc_output_format() to better reflect what
it does.

Also toss in some comments to document that the 4:2:0 PIPECONF
bits are glk+ only. They are mbz on earlier platforms so reading
them unconditionally is safe however.
