CIFS: refactor cifs_get_inode_info()

Make logic of cifs_get_inode() much clearer by moving code to sub
functions and adding comments.

Document the steps this function does.

cifs_get_inode_info() gets and updates a file inode metadata from its
file path.

* If caller already has raw info data from server they can pass it.
* If inode already exists (just need to update) caller can pass it.

Step 1: get raw data from server if none was passed
Step 2: parse raw data into intermediate internal cifs_fattr struct
Step 3: set fattr uniqueid which is later used for inode number. This
        can sometime be done from raw data
Step 4: tweak fattr according to mount options (file_mode, acl to mode
        bits, uid, gid, etc)
Step 5: update or create inode from final fattr struct

* add is_smb1_server() helper
* add is_inode_cache_good() helper
* move SMB1-backupcreds-getinfo-retry to separate func
  cifs_backup_query_path_info().
* move set-uniqueid code to separate func cifs_set_fattr_ino()
* don't clobber uniqueid from backup cred retry
* fix some probable corner cases memleaks
