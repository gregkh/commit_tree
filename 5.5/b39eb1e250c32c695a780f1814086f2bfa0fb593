ASoC: fsl_asrc: refine the setting of internal clock divider

The output divider should align with the output sample
rate, if use ideal sample rate, there will be a lot of overload,
which would cause underrun.

The maximum divider of asrc clock is 1024, but there is no
judgement for this limitation in driver, which may cause the divider
setting not correct.

For non-ideal ratio mode, the clock rate should divide the sample
rate with no remainder, and the quotient should be less than 1024.
