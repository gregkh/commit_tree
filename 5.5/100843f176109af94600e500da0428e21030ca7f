scsi: zfcp: trace channel log even for FCP command responses

While v2.6.26 commit b75db73159cc ("[SCSI] zfcp: Add qtcb dump to hba debug
trace") is right that we don't want to flood the (payload) trace ring
buffer, we don't trace successful FCP command responses by default.  So we
can include the channel log for problem determination with failed responses
of any FSF request type.

Fixes: b75db73159cc ("[SCSI] zfcp: Add qtcb dump to hba debug trace")
Fixes: a54ca0f62f95 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Redesign of the debug tracing for HBA records.")
