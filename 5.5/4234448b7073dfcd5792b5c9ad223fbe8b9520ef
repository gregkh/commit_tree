kbuild: Extend defconfig field size from 24 to 27

There are 6 defconfigs with names longer than 24 characters, breaking
alignment in "make help".

The "winner" is "ecovec24-romimage_defconfig", counting in at 27
characters.

Extend the defconfig field size to 27 to restore alignment.
Don't use a larger value, to not encourage people to create even longer
defconfig names.
