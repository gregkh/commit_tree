mlxsw: spectrum_router: After underlay moves, demote conflicting tunnels

When a GRE tunnel is bound to an underlay netdevice and that netdevice is
moved to a different VRF, that could cause two tunnels to have the same
underlay local address in the same VRF. Linux in this situation dispatches
the traffic according to the tunnel key (or lack thereof), but that cannot
be offloaded to Spectrum devices.

Detect this situation and unoffload the two impacted tunnels when it
happens.
