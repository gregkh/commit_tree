MIPS: barrier: Clean up __sync() definition

Implement __sync() using the new __SYNC() infrastructure, which will
take care of not emitting an instruction for old R3k CPUs that don't
support it. The only behavioral difference is that __sync() will now
provide a compiler barrier on these old CPUs, but that seems like
reasonable behavior anyway.
