PCI/PM: Fold __pci_start_power_transition() into its caller

Because pci_power_up() has become the only caller of
__pci_start_power_transition(), there is no need for the latter to
be a separate function any more, so fold it into the former, drop a
redundant check and reduce the number of lines of code somewhat.

Code rearrangement, no intentional functional impact.
