ath10k: avoid leaving .bss_info_changed prematurely

ath10k_bss_info_changed() handles various events from the upper layers. It
parses the changed bitfield and then configures the driver/firmware
accordingly. Each detected event is handled in a separate scope which is
independent of each other - but in the same function.

The commit f279294e9ee2 ("ath10k: add support for configuring management
packet rate") changed this behavior by returning from this function
prematurely when some precondition was not fulfilled. All new event
handlers added after the BSS_CHANGED_BASIC_RATES event handler would then
also be skipped.
