bpf/flow_dissector: add mode to enforce global BPF flow dissector

Always use init_net flow dissector BPF program if it's attached and fall
back to the per-net namespace one. Also, deny installing new programs if
there is already one attached to the root namespace.
Users can still detach their BPF programs, but can't attach any
new ones (-EEXIST).
