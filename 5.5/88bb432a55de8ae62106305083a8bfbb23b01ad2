ice: delay less

Shorten the delay for SQ responses, but increase the number of loops.
Max delay time is unchanged, but some operations complete much more
quickly.

In the process, add a new define to make the delay count and delay time
more explicit. Add comments to make things more explicit.

This fixes a problem with VF resets failing on with many VFs.
