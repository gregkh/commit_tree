docs/kunit/start: Use in-tree 'kunit_defconfig'

The kunit doc suggests users to get the default `kunitconfig` from an
external git tree.  However, the file is already located under the
`arch/um/configs/` of the kernel tree.  Because the local file is easier
to access and maintain, this commit updates the doc to use it.
