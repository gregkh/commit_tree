of: property: Fix documentation for out values

Property fetching functions which return number of successfully fetched
properties should not state that out-values are only modified if 0 is
returned. Fix this. Also, "pointer to return value" is slightly suboptimal
phrase as "return value" commonly refers to value function returns (not via
arguments). Rather use "pointer to found values".
