block: fix bdev_disk_changed for non-partitioned devices

We still have to set the capacity to 0 if invalidating or call
revalidate_disk if not even if the disk has no partitions.  Fix
that by merging rescan_partitions into bdev_disk_changed and just
stubbing out blk_add_partitions and blk_drop_partitions for
non-partitioned devices.
