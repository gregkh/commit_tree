Revert "udp: do rmem bulk free even if the rx sk queue is empty"

This reverts commit 0d4a6608f68c7532dcbfec2ea1150c9761767d03.

Williem reported that after commit 0d4a6608f68c ("udp: do rmem bulk
free even if the rx sk queue is empty") the memory allocated by
an almost idle system with many UDP sockets can grow a lot.

For stable kernel keep the solution as simple as possible and revert
the offending commit.
