sctp: free cmd->obj.chunk for the unprocessed SCTP_CMD_REPLY

This patch is to fix a memleak caused by no place to free cmd->obj.chunk
for the unprocessed SCTP_CMD_REPLY. This issue occurs when failing to
process a cmd while there're still SCTP_CMD_REPLY cmds on the cmd seq
with an allocated chunk in cmd->obj.chunk.

So fix it by freeing cmd->obj.chunk for each SCTP_CMD_REPLY cmd left on
the cmd seq when any cmd returns error. While at it, also remove 'nomem'
label.
