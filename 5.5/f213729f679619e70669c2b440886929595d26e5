counter: new TI eQEP driver

This adds a new counter driver for the Texas Instruments Enhanced
Quadrature Encoder Pulse (eQEP) module.

Only very basic functionality is currently implemented - only enough to
be able to read the position. The actual device has many more features
which can be added to the driver on an as-needed basis.

It is not possible to read the QEPA/B signal values in hardware, so
that feature is omitted.

The TI_PWMSS kernel option is selected in Kconfig to enable the parent
bus, which is needed for power management.
