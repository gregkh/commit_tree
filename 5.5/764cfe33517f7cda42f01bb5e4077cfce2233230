pinctrl: intel: Drop level from warning to debug in intel_restore_hostown()

Since we didn't get any new reports from users about wrong settings
of pad ownership, there is no point to spam kernel log with it. Thus,
drop level from warning to debug.

Also, modify format to be in align with the rest restore helpers.
