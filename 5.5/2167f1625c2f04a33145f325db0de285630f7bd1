perf/x86/intel/uncore: Remove PCIe3 unit for SNR

The PCIe Root Port driver for CPU Complex PCIe Root Ports are not
loaded on SNR.

The device ID for SNR PCIe3 unit is used by both uncore driver and the
PCIe Root Port driver. If uncore driver is loaded, the PCIe Root Port
driver never be probed.

Remove the PCIe3 unit for SNR for now. The support for PCIe3 unit will
be added later separately.
