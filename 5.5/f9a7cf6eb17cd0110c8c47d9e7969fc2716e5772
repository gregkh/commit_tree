bpf: Introduce BPF_TRACE_x helper for the tracing tests

For BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING, the bpf_prog's ctx is an array of u64.
This patch borrows the idea from BPF_CALL_x in filter.h to
convert a u64 to the arg type of the traced function.

The new BPF_TRACE_x has an arg to specify the return type of a bpf_prog.
It will be used in the future TCP-ops bpf_prog that may return "void".

The new macros are defined in the new header file "bpf_trace_helpers.h".
It is under selftests/bpf/ for now.  It could be moved to libbpf later
after seeing more upcoming non-tracing use cases.

The tests are changed to use these new macros also.  Hence,
the k[s]u8/16/32/64 are no longer needed and they are removed
from the bpf_helpers.h.
