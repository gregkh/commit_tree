preemptirq_delay_test: Add the burst feature and a sysfs trigger

This burst feature enables the user to generate a burst of
preempt/irqsoff latencies. This makes it possible to test whether we
are able to detect latencies that systematically occur very close to
each other.

The maximum burst size is 10. We also create 10 identical test
functions, so that we get 10 different backtraces; this is useful
when we want to test whether we can detect all the latencies in a
burst. Otherwise, there would be no easy way of differentiating
between which latency in a burst was captured by the tracer.

In addition, there is a sysfs trigger, so that it's not necessary to
reload the module to repeat the test. The trigger will appear as
/sys/kernel/preemptirq_delay_test/trigger in sysfs.
