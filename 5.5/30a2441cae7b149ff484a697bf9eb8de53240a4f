x86/asm: Make more symbols local

During the assembly cleanup patchset review, I found more symbols which
are used only locally. So make them really local by prepending ".L" to
them. Namely:

 - wakeup_idt is used only in realmode/rm/wakeup_asm.S.
 - in_pm32 is used only in boot/pmjump.S.
 - retint_user is used only in entry/entry_64.S, perhaps since commit
   2ec67971facc ("x86/entry/64/compat: Remove most of the fast system
   call machinery"), where entry_64_compat's caller was removed.

Drop GLOBAL from all of them too. I do not see more candidates in the
series.
