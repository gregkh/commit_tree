drm/amd/display: Add capability check for static ramp calc

[Why]
Static ramp to max refresh rate does not have capability check on
calculated v_total. Programming a lower v_total_min and max than the
total causes continuous spurious HPDs.

[How]
Add a capability check after v_total calculation similar to calculate
v_total helper functions.
