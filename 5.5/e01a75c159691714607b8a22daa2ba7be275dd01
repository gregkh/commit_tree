libbpf: Move bpf_{helpers, helper_defs, endian, tracing}.h into libbpf

Move bpf_helpers.h, bpf_tracing.h, and bpf_endian.h into libbpf. Move
bpf_helper_defs.h generation into libbpf's Makefile. Ensure all those
headers are installed along the other libbpf headers. Also, adjust
selftests and samples include path to include libbpf now.
