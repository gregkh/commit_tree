usb: dwc3: Disable phy suspend after power-on reset

For DRD controllers, the programming guide recommended that
GUSB3PIPECTL.SUSPENDABLE and GUSB2PHYCFG.SUSPHY to be cleared after
power-on reset and only set after the controller initialization is
completed. This can be done after device soft-reset in dwc3_core_init().
This patch makes sure to clear GUSB3PIPECTL.SUSPENDABLE and
GUSB2PHYCFG.SUSPHY before core initialization and only set them after
the device soft-reset is completed.
