bpf: Support doubleword alignment in bpf_jit_binary_alloc

Currently passing alignment greater than 4 to bpf_jit_binary_alloc does
not work: in such cases it silently aligns only to 4 bytes.

On s390, in order to load a constant from memory in a large (>512k) BPF
program, one must use lgrl instruction, whose memory operand must be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary.

This patch makes it possible to request 8-byte alignment from
bpf_jit_binary_alloc, and also makes it issue a warning when an
unsupported alignment is requested.
