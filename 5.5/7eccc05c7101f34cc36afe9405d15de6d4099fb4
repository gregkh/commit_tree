ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Update quirk for Teclast X89

When the Teclast X89 quirk was added we did not have jack-detection
support yet.

Note the over-current detection limit is set to 2mA instead of the usual
1.5mA because this tablet tends to give false-positive button-presses
when it is set to 1.5mA.
