ASoC: SOF: Intel: add support for snd-hda-codec-hdmi

Add support to implement HDMI/DP audio by using the common
snd-hda-codec-hdmi driver.

Change of codec driver affects user-space as the two
drivers expose different mixer controls. A new kernel
module option "use_common_hdmi" is added to user-space
to indicate which interface should be used. The default
driver can be selected via a Kconfig option.
