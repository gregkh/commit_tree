net: mscc: ocelot: refactor struct ocelot_port out of function prototypes

The ocelot_port structure has a net_device embedded in it, which makes
it unsuitable for leaving it in the driver implementation functions.

Leave ocelot_flower.c untouched. In that file, ocelot_port is used as an
interface to the tc shared blocks. That will be addressed in the next
patch.
