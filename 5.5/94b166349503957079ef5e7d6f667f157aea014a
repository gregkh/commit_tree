net/sonic: Improve receive descriptor status flag check

After sonic_tx_timeout() calls sonic_init(), it can happen that
sonic_rx() will subsequently encounter a receive descriptor with no
flags set. Remove the comment that says that this can't happen.

When giving a receive descriptor to the SONIC, clear the descriptor
status field. That way, any rx descriptor with flags set can only be
a newly received packet.

Don't process a descriptor without the LPKT bit set. The buffer is
still in use by the SONIC.
