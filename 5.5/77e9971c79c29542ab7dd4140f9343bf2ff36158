locking/refcount: Move the bulk of the REFCOUNT_FULL implementation into the <linux/refcount.h> header

In an effort to improve performance of the REFCOUNT_FULL implementation,
move the bulk of its functions into linux/refcount.h. This allows them
to be inlined in the same way as if they had been provided via
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_REFCOUNT.
