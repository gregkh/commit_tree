nfsd: Ensure CLONE persists data and metadata changes to the target file

The NFSv4.2 CLONE operation has implicit persistence requirements on the
target file, since there is no protocol requirement that the client issue
a separate operation to persist data.
For that reason, we should call vfs_fsync_range() on the destination file
after a successful call to vfs_clone_file_range().
