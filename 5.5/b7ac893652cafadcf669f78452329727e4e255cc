net: nfc: nci: fix a possible sleep-in-atomic-context bug in nci_uart_tty_receive()

The kernel may sleep while holding a spinlock.
The function call path (from bottom to top) in Linux 4.19 is:

net/nfc/nci/uart.c, 349:
	nci_skb_alloc in nci_uart_default_recv_buf
net/nfc/nci/uart.c, 255:
	(FUNC_PTR)nci_uart_default_recv_buf in nci_uart_tty_receive
net/nfc/nci/uart.c, 254:
	spin_lock in nci_uart_tty_receive

nci_skb_alloc(GFP_KERNEL) can sleep at runtime.
(FUNC_PTR) means a function pointer is called.

To fix this bug, GFP_KERNEL is replaced with GFP_ATOMIC for
nci_skb_alloc().

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by myself.
