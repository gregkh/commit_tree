sched/kcpustat: Introduce vtime-aware kcpustat accessor for CPUTIME_SYSTEM

Kcpustat is not correctly supported on nohz_full CPUs. The tick doesn't
fire and the cputime therefore doesn't move forward. The issue has shown
up after the vanishing of the remaining 1Hz which has made the stall
visible.

We are solving that with checking the task running on a CPU through RCU
and reading its vtime delta that we add to the raw kcpustat values.

We make sure that we fetch a coherent raw-kcpustat/vtime-delta couple
sequence while checking that the CPU referred by the target vtime is the
correct one, under the locked vtime seqcount.

Only CPUTIME_SYSTEM is handled here as a start because it's the trivial
case. User and guest time will require more preparation work to
correctly handle niceness.
