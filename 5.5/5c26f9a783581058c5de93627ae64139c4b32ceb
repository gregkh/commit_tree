libbpf: Don't use cxx to test_libpf target

No need to use C++ for test_libbpf target when libbpf is on C and it
can be tested with C, after this change the CXXFLAGS in makefiles can
be avoided, at least in bpf samples, when sysroot is used, passing
same C/LDFLAGS as for lib.

Add "return 0" in test_libbpf to avoid warn, but also remove spaces at
start of the lines to keep same style and avoid warns while apply.
