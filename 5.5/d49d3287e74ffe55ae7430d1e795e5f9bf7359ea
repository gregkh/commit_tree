btrfs: fix invalid removal of root ref

If we have the following sequence of events

  btrfs sub create A
  btrfs sub create A/B
  btrfs sub snap A C
  mkdir C/foo
  mv A/B C/foo
  rm -rf *

We will end up with a transaction abort.

The reason for this is because we create a root ref for B pointing to A.
When we create a snapshot of C we still have B in our tree, but because
the root ref points to A and not C we will make it appear to be empty.

The problem happens when we move B into C.  This removes the root ref
for B pointing to A and adds a ref of B pointing to C.  When we rmdir C
we'll see that we have a ref to our root and remove the root ref,
despite not actually matching our reference name.

Now btrfs_del_root_ref() allowing this to work is a bug as well, however
we know that this inode does not actually point to a root ref in the
first place, so we shouldn't be calling btrfs_del_root_ref() in the
first place and instead simply look up our dir index for this item and
do the rest of the removal.
