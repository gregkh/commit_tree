RDMA/hns: Prevent undefined behavior in hns_roce_set_user_sq_size()

The "ucmd->log_sq_bb_count" variable is a user controlled variable in the
0-255 range.  If we shift more than then number of bits in an int then
it's undefined behavior (it shift wraps), and potentially the int could
become negative.
