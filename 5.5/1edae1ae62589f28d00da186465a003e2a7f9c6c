x86/Kconfig: Enforce limit of 512 CPUs with MAXSMP and no CPUMASK_OFFSTACK

The help text of NR_CPUS says that the maximum number of CPUs supported
without CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is 512. However, NR_CPUS_RANGE_END allows this
limit to be bypassed by MAXSMP even if CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is not set.

This scenario can currently only happen in the RT tree, since it has
"select CPUMASK_OFFSTACK if !PREEMPT_RT_FULL" in MAXSMP. However,
even if we ignore the RT tree, checking for MAXSMP in addition to
CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is redundant.
