drm/i915: split out i915_switcheroo.[ch] from i915_drv.c

Split out code related to vga switcheroo register/unregister and state
handling from i915_drv.c into new i915_switcheroo.[ch] files.

It's a bit difficult to draw the line how much to move to the new file
from i915_drv.c, but it seemed to me keeping i915_suspend_switcheroo()
and i915_resume_switcheroo() in place was the cleanest.

No functional changes.
