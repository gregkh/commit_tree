coresight: etm4x: Improve usability of sysfs - include/exclude addr.

Setting include / exclude on a range had to be done by setting
the bit in 'mode' before setting the range. However, setting this
bit also had the effect of altering the current range as well.

Changed to only set include / exclude setting of a range at the point of
setting that range. Either use a 3rd input parameter as the include exclude
value, or if not present use the current value of 'mode'. Do not change
current range when 'mode' changes.
