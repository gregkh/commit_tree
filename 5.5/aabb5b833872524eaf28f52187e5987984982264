usbip: Fix error path of vhci_recv_ret_submit()

If a transaction error happens in vhci_recv_ret_submit(), event
handler closes connection and changes port status to kick hub_event.
Then hub tries to flush the endpoint URBs, but that causes infinite
loop between usb_hub_flush_endpoint() and vhci_urb_dequeue() because
"vhci_priv" in vhci_urb_dequeue() was already released by
vhci_recv_ret_submit() before a transmission error occurred. Thus,
vhci_urb_dequeue() terminates early and usb_hub_flush_endpoint()
continuously calls vhci_urb_dequeue().

The root cause of this issue is that vhci_recv_ret_submit()
terminates early without giving back URB when transaction error
occurs in vhci_recv_ret_submit(). That causes the error URB to still
be linked at endpoint list without “vhci_priv".

So, in the case of transaction error in vhci_recv_ret_submit(),
unlink URB from the endpoint, insert proper error code in
urb->status and give back URB.
