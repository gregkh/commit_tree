habanalabs: split MMU properties to PCI/DRAM

Split the properties used for MMU mappings to DRAM and PCI (host) types.
This is a prerequisite for future ASICs support.
Note that in Goya ASIC, the PMMU and DMMU are the same (except of page
sizes) as only one MMU mechanism is used for both of the mapping types.
Hence this patch should not have any effect on current behavior.
