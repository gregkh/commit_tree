xfs: include QUOTA, FATAL ASSERT build options in XFS_BUILD_OPTIONS

In commit d03a2f1b9fa8 ("xfs: include WARN, REPAIR build options in
XFS_BUILD_OPTIONS"), Eric pointed out that the XFS_BUILD_OPTIONS string,
shown at module init time and in modinfo output, does not currently
include all available build options. So, he added in CONFIG_XFS_WARN and
CONFIG_XFS_REPAIR. However, this is not enough, add in CONFIG_XFS_QUOTA
and CONFIG_XFS_ASSERT_FATAL.
