net/wan/fsl_ucc_hdlc: fix out of bounds write on array utdm_info

Array utdm_info is declared as an array of MAX_HDLC_NUM (4) elements
however up to UCC_MAX_NUM (8) elements are potentially being written
to it.  Currently we have an array out-of-bounds write error on the
last 4 elements. Fix this by making utdm_info UCC_MAX_NUM elements in
size.
