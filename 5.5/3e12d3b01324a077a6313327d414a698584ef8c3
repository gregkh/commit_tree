coresight: etm4x: Improve usability of sysfs - CID and VMID masks.

Context ID and VM ID masks required 2 value inputs, even when the
second value is ignored as insufficient CID / VMID comparators are
implemented.

Permit a single value to be used if that is sufficient to cover all
implemented comparators.
