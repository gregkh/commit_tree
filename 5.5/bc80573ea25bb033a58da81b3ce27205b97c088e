iio: light: vcnl4000: Fix scale for vcnl4040

According to the data sheet the ambient sensor's scale is 0.12 lux/step
(not 0.024 lux/step as used by vcnl4200) when the integration time is
80ms. The integration time is currently hardcoded in the driver to that
value.

See p. 8 in https://www.vishay.com/docs/84307/designingvcnl4040.pdf
