staging: fbtft: Do not hardcode SPI CS polarity inversion

The current use of the mode flag SPI_CS_HIGH is fragile: it
overwrites anything already assigned by the SPI core.

Assign ^= SPI_CS_HIGH since we might be active high
already, and that is usually the case with GPIOs used
for chip select, even if they are in practice active low.

Add a comment clarifying why ^= SPI_CS_HIGH is the right
choice here.
