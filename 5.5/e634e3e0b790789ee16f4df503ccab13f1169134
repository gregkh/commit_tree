PCI: altera: Use pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges()

Convert altera host bridge to use the common
pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges().

There's no need to assign the resources to a temporary list first. Just
use bridge->windows directly and remove all the temporary list handling.

If an I/O range is present, then it will now be mapped. It's expected
that h/w which doesn't support I/O range will not define one.
