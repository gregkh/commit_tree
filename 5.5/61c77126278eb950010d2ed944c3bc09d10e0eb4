net: dsa: sja1105: Make all public PTP functions take dsa_switch as argument

The new rule (as already started for sja1105_tas.h) is for functions of
optional driver components (ones which may be disabled via Kconfig - PTP
and TAS) to take struct dsa_switch *ds instead of struct sja1105_private
*priv as first argument.

This is so that forward-declarations of struct sja1105_private can be
avoided.

So make sja1105_ptp.h the second user of this rule.
