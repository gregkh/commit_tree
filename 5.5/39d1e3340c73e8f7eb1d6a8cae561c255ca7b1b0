mtd: spi-nor: Fix clearing of QE bit on lock()/unlock()

Make sure that when doing a lock() or an unlock() operation we don't clear
the QE bit from Status Register 2.

JESD216 revB or later offers information about the *default* Status
Register commands to use (see BFPT DWORDS[15], bits 22:20). In this
standard, Status Register 1 refers to the first data byte transferred on a
Read Status (05h) or Write Status (01h) command. Status register 2 refers
to the byte read using instruction 35h. Status register 2 is the second
byte transferred in a Write Status (01h) command.

Industry naming and definitions of these Status Registers may differ.
The definitions are described in JESD216B, BFPT DWORDS[15], bits 22:20.
There are cases in which writing only one byte to the Status Register 1
has the side-effect of clearing Status Register 2 and implicitly the Quad
Enable bit. This side-effect is hit just by the
BFPT_DWORD15_QER_SR2_BIT1_BUGGY and BFPT_DWORD15_QER_SR2_BIT1 cases.
