libbpf: Update BTF reloc support to latest Clang format

BTF offset reloc was generalized in recent Clang into field relocation,
capturing extra u32 field, specifying what aspect of captured field
needs to be relocated. This changes .BTF.ext's record size for this
relocation from 12 bytes to 16 bytes. Given these format changes
happened in Clang before official released version, it's ok to not
support outdated 12-byte record size w/o breaking ABI.
