KVM: nVMX: Add support for capturing highest observable L2 TSC

The L1 hypervisor may include the IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER MSR in the
vmcs12 MSR VM-exit MSR-store area as a way of determining the highest
TSC value that might have been observed by L2 prior to VM-exit. The
current implementation does not capture a very tight bound on this
value.  To tighten the bound, add the IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER MSR to the
vmcs02 VM-exit MSR-store area whenever it appears in the vmcs12 VM-exit
MSR-store area.  When L0 processes the vmcs12 VM-exit MSR-store area
during the emulation of an L2->L1 VM-exit, special-case the
IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER MSR, using the value stored in the vmcs02
VM-exit MSR-store area to derive the value to be stored in the vmcs12
VM-exit MSR-store area.
