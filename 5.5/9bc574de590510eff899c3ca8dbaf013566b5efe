btrfs: skip log replay on orphaned roots

My fsstress modifications coupled with generic/475 uncovered a failure
to mount and replay the log if we hit a orphaned root.  We do not want
to replay the log for an orphan root, but it's completely legitimate to
have an orphaned root with a log attached.  Fix this by simply skipping
replaying the log.  We still need to pin it's root node so that we do
not overwrite it while replaying other logs, as we re-read the log root
at every stage of the replay.
