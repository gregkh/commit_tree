driver core: Add device link support for SYNC_STATE_ONLY flag

Parent devices might need to create "proxy" device links from themselves
to supplier devices to make sure the supplier devices don't get a
sync_state() before the child consumer devices get a chance to add
device links to the supplier devices.

However, the parent device has no real dependency on the supplier device
and probing, suspend/resume or runtime PM don't need to be affected by
the supplier device.  To capture these cases, create a SYNC_STATE_ONLY
device link flag that only affects sync_state() behavior and doesn't
affect probing, suspend/resume or runtime PM.
