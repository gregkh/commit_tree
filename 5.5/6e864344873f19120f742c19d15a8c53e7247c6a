ASoC: soc-core: merge soc_new_pcm_runtime() and soc_rtd_init()

"rtd"      is handled by soc_xxx_pcm_runtime(), and
"rtd->dev" is handled by soc_rtd_xxx().

There is no reason to separate these, and it makes code complex.
We can create these in the same time.

This patch merges soc_rtd_init() into soc_new_pcm_runtime().
