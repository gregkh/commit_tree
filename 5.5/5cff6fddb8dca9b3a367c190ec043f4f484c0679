dt-bindings: vendor-prefixes: Add 'fsi[ab]' to the list of non-vendor prefixes

'fsia' and 'fsib' property prefixes were added as schema in commit
2f52475bac7e ("ASoC: fsi: switch to yaml base Documentation").
Unfortunately to do checks on actual vendor prefixes, we have to track
the handful of prefixes which are not vendors like 'fsia' and 'fsib'.
