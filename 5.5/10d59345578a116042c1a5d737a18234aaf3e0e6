io_uring: add sockets to list of files that support non-blocking issue

In chasing a performance issue between using IORING_OP_RECVMSG and
IORING_OP_READV on sockets, tracing showed that we always punt the
socket reads to async offload. This is due to io_file_supports_async()
not checking for S_ISSOCK on the inode. Since sockets supports the
O_NONBLOCK (or MSG_DONTWAIT) flag just fine, add sockets to the list
of file types that we can do a non-blocking issue to.
