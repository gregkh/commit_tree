scsi: hisi_sas: use wait_for_completion_timeout() when clearing ITCT

When injecting 2bit ecc errors, it will cause confusion inside SAS
controller which needs host reset to recover it. If a device is gone at the
same times inject 2bit ecc errors, we may not receive the ITCT interrupt so
it will wait for completion in clear_itct_v3_hw() all the time. And host
reset will also not occur because it can't require hisi_hba->sem, so the
system will be suspended.

To solve the issue, use wait_for_completion_timeout() instead of
wait_for_completion(), and also don't mark the gone device as
SAS_PHY_UNUSED when device gone.
