arm64/mm: Poison initmem while freeing with free_reserved_area()

Platform implementation for free_initmem() should poison the memory while
freeing it up. Hence pass across POISON_FREE_INITMEM while calling into
free_reserved_area(). The same is being followed in the generic fallback
for free_initmem() and some other platforms overriding it.
