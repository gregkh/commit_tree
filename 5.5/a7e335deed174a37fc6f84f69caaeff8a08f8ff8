dmaengine: sprd: Add wrap address support for link-list mode

The Spreadtrum Audio compress offload mode will use 2-stage DMA transfer
to save power. That means we can request 2 dma channels, one for source
channel, and another one for destination channel. Once the source channel's
transaction is done, it will trigger the destination channel's transaction
automatically by hardware signal.

In this case, the source channel will transfer data from IRAM buffer to
the DSP fifo to decoding/encoding, once IRAM buffer is empty by transferring
done, the destination channel will start to transfer data from DDR buffer
to IRAM buffer. Since the destination channel will use link-list mode to
fill the IRAM data, and IRAM buffer is allocated by 32K, and DDR buffer
is larger to 2M, that means we need lots of link-list nodes to do a cyclic
transfer, instead wasting lots of link-list memory, we can use wrap address
support to reduce link-list node number, which means when the transfer
address reaches the wrap address, the transfer address will jump to the
wrap_to address specified by wrap_to register, and only 2 link-list nodes
can do a cyclic transfer to transfer data from DDR to IRAM.

Thus this patch adds wrap address to support this case.
