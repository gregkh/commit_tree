CIFS: Close cached root handle only if it has a lease

SMB2_tdis() checks if a root handle is valid in order to decide
whether it needs to close the handle or not. However if another
thread has reference for the handle, it may end up with putting
the reference twice. The extra reference that we want to put
during the tree disconnect is the reference that has a directory
lease. So, track the fact that we have a directory lease and
close the handle only in that case.
