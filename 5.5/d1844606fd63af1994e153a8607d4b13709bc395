drm/i915: Add PIPECONF YCbCr 4:4:4 programming for ILK-IVB

On ILK-IVB the pipe colorspace is configured via PIPECONF
(as opposed to PIPEMISC in BDW+). Let's configure+readout
that stuff correctly.

Enabling YCbCr 4:4:4 output will now be a simple matter of
setting crtc_state->output_format appropriately in the encoder
.compute_config(). However, when we do that we must be
aware of the fact that YCbCr DP output doesn't seem to work
on ILK (resulting image is totally garbled), but on SNB+
it works fine. However HDMI YCbCr output does work correctly
even on ILK.
