drm/ttm: use the parent resv for ghost objects v3

This way the TTM is destroyed with the correct dma_resv object
locked and we can even pipeline imported BO evictions.

v2: Limit this to only cases when the parent object uses a separate
    reservation object as well. This fixes another OOM problem.
v3: fix init and try_lock on the wrong object
