ALSA: hda - fixup for the bass speaker on Lenovo Carbon X1 7th gen

The auto-parser assigns the bass speaker to DAC3 (NID 0x06) which
is without the volume control. I do not see a reason to use DAC2,
because the shared output to all speakers produces the sufficient
and well balanced sound. The stereo support is enough for this
purpose (laptop).
