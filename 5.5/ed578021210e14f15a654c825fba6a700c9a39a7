libbpf: Simplify BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD_PROBED usage

Streamline BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD_PROBED interface to follow
BPF_CORE_READ_BITFIELD (direct) and BPF_CORE_READ, in general, i.e., just
return read result or 0, if underlying bpf_probe_read() failed.

In practice, real applications rarely check bpf_probe_read() result, because
it has to always work or otherwise it's a bug. So propagating internal
bpf_probe_read() error from this macro hurts usability without providing real
benefits in practice. This patch fixes the issue and simplifies usage,
noticeable even in selftest itself.
