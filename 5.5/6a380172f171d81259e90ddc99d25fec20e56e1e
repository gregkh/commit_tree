dt-bindings: marvell: Declare the CN913x SoC compatibles

Describe the compatible properties for the new Marvell SoCs:
* CN9130: 1x AP807-quad + 1x CP115 (1x embedded)
* CN9131: 1x AP807-quad + 2x CP115 (1x embedded + 1x modular)
* CN9132: 1x AP807-quad + 3x CP115 (1x embedded + 2x modular)

CP115 are similar to CP110 in terms of features.

There are three development boards based on these SoCs:
* CN9130-DB: comes as a single mother board (with the CP115 bundled)
* CN9131-DB: same as CN9130-DB with one additional modular CP115
* CN9132-DB: same as CN9130-DB with two additional modular CP115
