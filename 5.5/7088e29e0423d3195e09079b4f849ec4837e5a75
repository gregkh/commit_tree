EDAC/ghes: Fix grain calculation

The current code to convert a physical address mask to a grain
(defined as granularity in bytes) is:

	e->grain = ~(mem_err->physical_addr_mask & ~PAGE_MASK);

This is broken in several ways:

1) It calculates to wrong grain values. E.g., a physical address mask
of ~0xfff should give a grain of 0x1000. Without considering
PAGE_MASK, there is an off-by-one. Things are worse when also
filtering it with ~PAGE_MASK. This will calculate to a grain with the
upper bits set. In the example it even calculates to ~0.

2) The grain does not depend on and is unrelated to the kernel's
page-size. The page-size only matters when unmapping memory in
memory_failure(). Smaller grains are wrongly rounded up to the
page-size, on architectures with a configurable page-size (e.g. arm64)
this could round up to the even bigger page-size of the hypervisor.

Fix this with:

	e->grain = ~mem_err->physical_addr_mask + 1;

The grain_bits are defined as:

	grain = 1 << grain_bits;

Change also the grain_bits calculation accordingly, it is the same
formula as in edac_mc.c now and the code can be unified.

The value in ->physical_addr_mask coming from firmware is assumed to
be contiguous, but this is not sanity-checked. However, in case the
mask is non-contiguous, a conversion to grain_bits effectively
converts the grain bit mask to a power of 2 by rounding it up.
