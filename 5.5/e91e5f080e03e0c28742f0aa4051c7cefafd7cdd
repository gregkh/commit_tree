drm/sched: Set error to s_fence if HW job submission failed.

Problem:
When run_job fails and HW fence returned is NULL we still signal
the s_fence to avoid hangs but the user has no way of knowing if
the actual HW job was ran and finished.

Fix:
Allow .run_job implementations to return ERR_PTR in the fence pointer
returned and then set this error for s_fence->finished fence so whoever
wait on this fence can inspect the signaled fence for an error.
