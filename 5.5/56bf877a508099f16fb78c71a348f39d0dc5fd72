selftests, bpf: xdping is not meant to be run standalone

The actual test to run is test_xdping.sh, which is already in TEST_PROGS.
The xdping program alone is not runnable with 'make run_tests', it
immediatelly fails due to missing arguments.

Move xdping to TEST_GEN_PROGS_EXTENDED in order to be built but not run.
