bpf: Fix a bug when getting subprog 0 jited image in check_attach_btf_id

For jited bpf program, if the subprogram count is 1, i.e.,
there is no callees in the program, prog->aux->func will be NULL
and prog->bpf_func points to image address of the program.

If there is more than one subprogram, prog->aux->func is populated,
and subprogram 0 can be accessed through either prog->bpf_func or
prog->aux->func[0]. Other subprograms should be accessed through
prog->aux->func[subprog_id].

This patch fixed a bug in check_attach_btf_id(), where
prog->aux->func[subprog_id] is used to access any subprogram which
caused a segfault like below:
