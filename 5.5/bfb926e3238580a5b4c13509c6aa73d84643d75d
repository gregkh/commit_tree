drm/i915/display/icl: Save Master transcoder in slave's crtc_state for Transcoder Port Sync

In case of tiled displays when the two tiles are sent across two CRTCs
over two separate DP SST connectors, we need a mechanism to synchronize
the two CRTCs and their corresponding transcoders.
So use the master-slave mode where there is one master corresponding
to last horizontal and vertical tile that needs to be genlocked with
all other slave tiles.
This patch identifies saves the master transcoder in all the slave
CRTC states. This is needed to select the master CRTC/transcoder
while configuring transcoder port sync for the corresponding slaves.

v6:
Rebase (manasi)
v5:
* Address Ville's comments
* Just pass crtc_state, no need to check GEN (Ville)
v4:
* Rebase
v3:
* Use master_tramscoder instead of master_crtc for valid
HW state readouts (Ville)
v2:
* Move this to intel_mode_set_pipe_config(Jani N, Ville)
* Use slave_bitmask to save associated slaves in master crtc state (Ville)
