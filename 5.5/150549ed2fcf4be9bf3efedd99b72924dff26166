jbd2: Drop pointless check from jbd2_journal_stop()

If a transaction is larger than journal->j_max_transaction_buffers, that
is a bug and not a trigger for transaction commit. Also the very next
attempt to start new handle will start transaction commit anyway. So
just remove the pointless check. Arguably, we could start transaction
commit whenever the transaction size is *close* to
journal->j_max_transaction_buffers. This has a potential to reduce
latency of the next jbd2_journal_start() at the cost of somewhat smaller
transactions. However for this to have any effect, it would mean that
there isn't someone already waiting in jbd2_journal_start() which means
metadata load for the fs is pretty light anyway so probably this
optimization is not worth it.
