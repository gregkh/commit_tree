Revert "locking/mutex: Complain upon mutex API misuse in IRQ contexts"

This ended up causing some noise in places such as rxrpc running in softirq.

The warning is misleading in this case as the mutex trylock and unlock
operations are done within the same context; and therefore we need not
worry about the PI-boosting issues that comes along with no single-owner
lock guarantees.

While we don't want to support this in mutexes, there is no way out of
this yet; so lets get rid of the WARNs for now, as it is only fair to
code that has historically relied on non-preemptible softirq guarantees.
In addition, changing the lock type is also unviable: exclusive rwsems
have the same issue (just not the WARN_ON) and counting semaphores
would introduce a performance hit as mutexes are a lot more optimized.

This reverts:
