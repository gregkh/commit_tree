irqchip/gic-v3-its: Synchronise INT/CLEAR commands targetting a VLPI using VSYNC

We have so far always injected/cleared VLPIs using either
INT+SYNC or CLEAR+SYNC sequences, but that's pretty wrong
for two reasons:

- SYNC only synchronises physical LPIs
- The collection ID that for the associated LPI doesn't match
  the redistributor the vPE is associated with

Instead, send an {INT,CLEAR}+VSYNC for forwarded LPIs, ensuring
that the ITS synchronises against the virtual pending table.
