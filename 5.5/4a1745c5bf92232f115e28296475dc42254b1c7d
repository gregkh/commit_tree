powerpc/pseries/cmm: Drop page array

We can simply store the pages in a list (page->lru), no need for a
separate data structure (+ complicated handling). This is how most
other balloon drivers store allocated pages without additional
tracking data.

For the notifiers, use page_to_pfn() to check if a page is in the
applicable range. Use page_to_phys() in plpar_page_set_loaned() and
plpar_page_set_active() (I assume due to the __pa() that's the right
thing to do).
