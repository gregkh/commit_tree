spi: use new `spi_transfer_delay_exec` helper where straightforward

For many places in the spi drivers, using the new `spi_transfer_delay`
helper is straightforward.
It's just replacing:
```
  if (t->delay_usecs)
     udelay(t->delay_usecs);
```
with `spi_transfer_delay(t)` which handles both `delay_usecs` and the new
`delay` field.

This change replaces in all places (in the spi drivers)  where this change
is simple.
