perf probe: Generate event name with line number

Generate event name from function name with line number as
<function>_L<line_number>. Note that this is only for the new event
which is defined by the line number of function (except for line 0).

If there is another event on same line, you have to use
"-f" option. In that case, the new event has "_1" suffix.

 e.g.
  # perf probe -a kernel_read:2
  Added new event:
    probe:kernel_read_L2 (on kernel_read:2)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:kernel_read_L2 -aR sleep 1

But if we omit the line number or 0th line, it will
have no suffix.

  # perf probe -a kernel_read:0
  Added new event:
    probe:kernel_read (on kernel_read)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:kernel_read -aR sleep 1

  probe:kernel_read    (on kernel_read@linux-5.0.0/fs/read_write.c)
  probe:kernel_read_L2 (on kernel_read:2@linux-5.0.0/fs/read_write.c)
