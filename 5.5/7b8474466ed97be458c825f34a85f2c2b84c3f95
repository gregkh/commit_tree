time: Zero the upper 32-bits in __kernel_timespec on 32-bit

On compat interfaces, the high order bits of nanoseconds should be zeroed
out. This is because the application code or the libc do not guarantee
zeroing of these. If used without zeroing, kernel might be at risk of using
timespec values incorrectly.

Originally it was handled correctly, but lost during is_compat_syscall()
cleanup. Revert the condition back to check CONFIG_64BIT.
