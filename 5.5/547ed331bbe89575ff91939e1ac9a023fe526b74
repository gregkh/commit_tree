RDMA/srp: Add parse function for maximum initiator to target IU size

According to SRP specifications 'srp-r16a' and 'srp2r06',
IOControllerProfile attributes for SRP target port include the maximum
initiator to target IU size.

SRP connection daemons, such as srp_daemon, can get the value from the
subnet manager. The SRP connection daemon can pass this value to kernel.

This patch adds a parse function for it.

Upstream commit [1] enables the kernel parameter, 'use_imm_data', by
default. [1] also use (8 * 1024) as the default value for kernel parameter
'max_imm_data'. With those default values, the maximum initiator to target
IU size will be 8260.

In case the SRPT modules, which include the in-tree 'ib_srpt.ko' module,
do not support SRP-2 'immediate data' feature, the default maximum
initiator to target IU size is significantly smaller than 8260. For
'ib_srpt.ko' module, which built from source before [2], the default
maximum initiator to target IU is 2116.

[1] introduces a regression issue for old srp targets with default kernel
parameters, as the connection will be rejected because of a too large
maximum initiator to target IU size.
