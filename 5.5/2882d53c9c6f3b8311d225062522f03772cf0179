seccomp: Check that seccomp_notif is zeroed out by the user

This patch is a small change in enforcement of the uapi for
SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_RECV ioctl. Specifically, the datastructure which
is passed (seccomp_notif) must be zeroed out. Previously any of its
members could be set to nonsense values, and we would ignore it.

This ensures all fields are set to their zero value.
