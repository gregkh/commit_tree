ath10k: Correct error handling of dma_map_single()

The return value of dma_map_single() should be checked for errors using
dma_mapping_error() and the skb has been dequeued so it needs to be
freed.

This was found when enabling CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG and it warned about the
missing dma_mapping_error() call.
