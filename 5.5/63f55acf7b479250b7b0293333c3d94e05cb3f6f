netfilter: ecache: document extension area access rules

Once ct->ext gets free'd via kfree() rather than kfree_rcu we can't
access the extension area anymore without owning the conntrack.

This is a special case:

The worker is walking the pcpu dying list while holding dying list lock:
Neither ct nor ct->ext can be free'd until after the walk has completed.
