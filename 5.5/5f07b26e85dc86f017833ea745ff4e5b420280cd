arm64: dts: marvell: Externalize PCIe macros from CP11x file

PCIe macros are specific to CP110 and will not fit CP115
constraints. To keep the same way the files are organized, just move
some macros out of the CP11x generic file and define them directly in
SoC DTSI, instead of defining single addresses in the SoC DTSI and
reusing them in macros.

In the end:
* CP11X_PCIE_MEM_BASE SoC define is dropped
* CP11X_PCIEx_MEM_BASE is moved out of the generic DT to be put in the
  SoC files as it replaces the above definition.
* As the CP11X_PCIEx_MEM_SIZE macro is also subject to change with
  newer SoCs, we put it in the SoC files as well.
