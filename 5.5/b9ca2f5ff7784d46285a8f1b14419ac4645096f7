vsock: add vsock_create_connected() called by transports

All transports call __vsock_create() with the same parameters,
most of them depending on the parent socket. In order to simplify
the VSOCK core APIs exposed to the transports, this patch adds
the vsock_create_connected() callable from transports to create
a new socket when a connection request is received.
We also unexported the __vsock_create().
