tracing: Initialize val to zero in parse_entry of inject code

gcc produces a variable may be uninitialized warning for "val" in
parse_entry(). This is really a false positive, but the code is subtle
enough to just initialize val to zero and it's not a fast path to worry
about it.

Marked for stable to remove the warning in the stable trees as well.
