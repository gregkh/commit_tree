exit/exec: Seperate mm_release()

mm_release() contains the futex exit handling. mm_release() is called from
do_exit()->exit_mm() and from exec()->exec_mm().

In the exit_mm() case PF_EXITING and the futex state is updated. In the
exec_mm() case these states are not touched.

As the futex exit code needs further protections against exit races, this
needs to be split into two functions.

Preparatory only, no functional change.
