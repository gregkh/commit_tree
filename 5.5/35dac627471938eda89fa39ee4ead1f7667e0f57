ASoC: fsl_esai: Add spin lock to protect reset, stop and start

xrun may happen at the end of stream, the
trigger->fsl_esai_trigger_stop maybe called in the middle of
fsl_esai_hw_reset, this may cause esai in wrong state
after stop, and there may be endless xrun interrupt.

This issue may also happen with trigger->fsl_esai_trigger_start.

So Add spin lock to lock those functions.
