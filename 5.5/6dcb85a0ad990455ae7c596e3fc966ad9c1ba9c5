drm/i915: Hold irq-off for the entire fake lock period

Sadly lockdep records when the irqs are re-enabled and then marks up the
fake lock as being irq-unsafe. Our hand is forced and so we must mark up
the entire fake lock critical section as irq-off.

Hopefully this is the last tweak required!

v2: Not quite, we need to mark the timeline spinlock as irqsafe. That
was a genuine bug being hidden by the earlier lockdep splat.
