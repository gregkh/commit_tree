crypto: poly1305 - move core routines into a separate library

Move the core Poly1305 routines shared between the generic Poly1305
shash driver and the Adiantum and NHPoly1305 drivers into a separate
library so that using just this pieces does not pull in the crypto
API pieces of the generic Poly1305 routine.

In a subsequent patch, we will augment this generic library with
init/update/final routines so that Poyl1305 algorithm can be used
directly without the need for using the crypto API's shash abstraction.
