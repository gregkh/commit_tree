net/sonic: Fix receive buffer handling

The SONIC can sometimes advance its rx buffer pointer (RRP register)
without advancing its rx descriptor pointer (CRDA register). As a result
the index of the current rx descriptor may not equal that of the current
rx buffer. The driver mistakenly assumes that they are always equal.
This assumption leads to incorrect packet lengths and possible packet
duplication. Avoid this by calling a new function to locate the buffer
corresponding to a given descriptor.
