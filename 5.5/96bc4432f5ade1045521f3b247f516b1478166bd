bpf, riscv: Limit to 33 tail calls

All BPF JIT compilers except RISC-V's and MIPS' enforce a 33-tail calls
limit at runtime.  In addition, a test was recently added, in tailcalls2,
to check this limit.

This patch updates the tail call limit in RISC-V's JIT compiler to allow
33 tail calls.  I tested it using the above selftest on an emulated
RISCV64.
