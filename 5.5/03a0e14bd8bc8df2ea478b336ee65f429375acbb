staging: qlge: Deduplicate rx buffer queue management

The qlge driver (and device) uses two kinds of buffers for reception,
so-called "small buffers" and "large buffers". The two are arranged in
rings, the sbq and lbq. These two share similar data structures and code.

Factor out data structures into a common struct qlge_bq, make required
adjustments to code and dedup the most obvious cases of copy/paste.

This patch should not introduce any functional change other than to some of
the printk format strings.
