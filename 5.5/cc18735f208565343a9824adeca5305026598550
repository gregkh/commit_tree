ACPI: LPSS: Add LNXVIDEO -> BYT I2C7 to lpss_device_links

So far on Bay Trail (BYT) we only have been adding a device_link adding
the iGPU (LNXVIDEO) device as consumer for the I2C controller for the
PMIC for I2C5, but the PMIC only uses I2C5 on BYT CR (cost reduced) on
regular BYT platforms I2C7 is used and we were not adding the device_link
sometimes causing resume ordering issues.

This commit adds LNXVIDEO -> BYT I2C7 to the lpss_device_links table,
fixing this.
