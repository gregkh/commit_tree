arm64: dts: meson-g12a: Add PCIe node

This adds the Amlogic G12A PCI Express controller node, also
using the USB3+PCIe Combo PHY.

The PHY mode selection is static, thus the USB3+PCIe Combo PHY
phandle would need to be removed from the USB control node if the
shared differential lines are used for PCIe instead of USB3.
