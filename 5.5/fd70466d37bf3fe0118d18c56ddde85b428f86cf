HID: i2c-hid: Reset ALPS touchpads on resume

Commit 52cf93e63ee6 ("HID: i2c-hid: Don't reset device upon system
resume") fixes many touchpads and touchscreens, however ALPS touchpads
start to trigger IRQ storm after system resume.

Since it's total silence from ALPS, let's bring the old behavior back
to ALPS touchpads.
