bpf, x86: Small optimization in comparing against imm0

Replace 'cmp reg, 0' with 'test reg, reg' for comparisons against
zero. Saves 1 byte of instruction encoding per occurrence. The flag
results of test 'reg, reg' are identical to 'cmp reg, 0' in all
cases except for AF which we don't use/care about. In terms of
macro-fusibility in combination with a subsequent conditional jump
instruction, both have the same properties for the jumps used in
the JIT translation. For example, same JITed Cilium program can
shrink a bit from e.g. 12,455 to 12,317 bytes as tests with 0 are
used quite frequently.
