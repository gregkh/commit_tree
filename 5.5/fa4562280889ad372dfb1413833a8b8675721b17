io_uring: remove index from sqe_submit

submit->index is used only for inbound check in submission path (i.e.
head < ctx->sq_entries). However, it always will be true, as
1. it's already validated by io_get_sqring()
2. ctx->sq_entries can't be changedd in between, because of held
ctx->uring_lock and ctx->refs.
