spi: Fix SPI_CS_HIGH setting when using native and GPIO CS

When improving the CS GPIO support at core level, the SPI_CS_HIGH
has been enabled for all the CS lines used for a given SPI controller.

However, the SPI framework allows to have on the same controller native
CS and GPIO CS. The native CS may not support the SPI_CS_HIGH, so they
should not be setup automatically.

With this patch the setting is done only for the CS that will use a
GPIO as CS
