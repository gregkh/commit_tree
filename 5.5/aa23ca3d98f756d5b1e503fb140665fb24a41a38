gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option + quirk mechanism

On some laptops enabling wakeup on the GPIO interrupts used for ACPI _AEI
event handling causes spurious wakeups.

This commit adds a new honor_wakeup option, defaulting to true (our current
behavior), which can be used to disable wakeup on troublesome hardware
to avoid these spurious wakeups.

This is a workaround for an architectural problem with s2idle under Linux
where we do not have any mechanism to immediately go back to sleep after
wakeup events, other then for embedded-controller events using the standard
ACPI EC interface, for details see:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-acpi/61450f9b-cbc6-0c09-8b3a-aff6bf9a0b3c@redhat.com/

One series of laptops which is not able to suspend without this workaround
is the HP x2 10 Cherry Trail models, this commit adds a DMI based quirk
which makes sets honor_wakeup to false on these models.
