media: vivid: Set vid_cap_streaming and vid_out_streaming to true

When vbi stream is started, followed by video streaming,
the vid_cap_streaming and vid_out_streaming were not being set to true,
which would cause the video stream to stop when vbi stream is stopped.
This patch allows to set vid_cap_streaming and vid_out_streaming to true.
According to Hans Verkuil it appears that these 'if (dev->kthread_vid_cap)'
checks are a left-over from the original vivid development and should never
have been there.
