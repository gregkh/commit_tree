net/smc: tell peers about abnormal link group termination

There are lots of link group termination scenarios. Most of them
still allow to inform the peer of the terminating sockets about aborting.
This patch tries to call smc_close_abort() for terminating sockets.

And the internal TCP socket is reset with tcp_abort().
