net: dsa: sja1105: Implement state machine for TAS with PTP clock source

Tested using the following bash script and the tc from iproute2-next:

	#!/bin/bash

	set -e -u -o pipefail

	NSEC_PER_SEC="1000000000"

	gatemask() {
		local tc_list="$1"
		local mask=0

		for tc in ${tc_list}; do
			mask=$((${mask} | (1 << ${tc})))
		done

		printf "%02x" ${mask}
	}

	if ! systemctl is-active --quiet ptp4l; then
		echo "Please start the ptp4l service"
		exit
	fi

	now=$(phc_ctl /dev/ptp1 get | gawk '/clock time is/ { print $5; }')
	# Phase-align the base time to the start of the next second.
	sec=$(echo "${now}" | gawk -F. '{ print $1; }')
	base_time="$(((${sec} + 1) * ${NSEC_PER_SEC}))"

	tc qdisc add dev swp5 parent root handle 100 taprio \
		num_tc 8 \
		map 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 \
		queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 \
		base-time ${base_time} \
		sched-entry S $(gatemask 7) 100000 \
		sched-entry S $(gatemask "0 1 2 3 4 5 6") 400000 \
		clockid CLOCK_TAI flags 2

The "state machine" is a workqueue invoked after each manipulation
command on the PTP clock (reset, adjust time, set time, adjust
frequency) which checks over the state of the time-aware scheduler.
So it is not monitored periodically, only in reaction to a PTP command
typically triggered from a userspace daemon (linuxptp). Otherwise there
is no reason for things to go wrong.

Now that the timecounter/cyclecounter has been replaced with hardware
operations on the PTP clock, the TAS Kconfig now depends upon PTP and
the standalone clocksource operating mode has been removed.
