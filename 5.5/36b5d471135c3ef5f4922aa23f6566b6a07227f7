selftests/bpf: samples/bpf: Split off legacy stuff from bpf_helpers.h

Split off few legacy things from bpf_helpers.h into separate
bpf_legacy.h file:
- load_{byte|half|word};
- remove extra inner_idx and numa_node fields from bpf_map_def and
  introduce bpf_map_def_legacy for use in samples;
- move BPF_ANNOTATE_KV_PAIR into bpf_legacy.h.

Adjust samples and selftests accordingly by either including
bpf_legacy.h and using bpf_map_def_legacy, or switching to BTF-defined
maps altogether.
