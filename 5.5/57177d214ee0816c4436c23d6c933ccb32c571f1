drm/sun4i: hdmi: Remove duplicate cleanup calls

When the HDMI unbinds drm_connector_cleanup() and drm_encoder_cleanup()
are called. This also happens when the connector and the encoder are
destroyed. This double call triggers a NULL pointer exception.

The patch fixes this by removing the cleanup calls in the unbind
function.
