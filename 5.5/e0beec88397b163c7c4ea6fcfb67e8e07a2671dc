ASoC: msm8916-wcd-analog: Fix selected events for MIC BIAS External1

MIC BIAS External1 sets pm8916_wcd_analog_enable_micbias_ext1()
as event handler, which ends up in pm8916_wcd_analog_enable_micbias_ext().

But pm8916_wcd_analog_enable_micbias_ext() only handles the POST_PMU
event, which is not specified in the event flags for MIC BIAS External1.
This means that the code in the event handler is never actually run.

Set SND_SOC_DAPM_POST_PMU as the only event for the handler to fix this.
