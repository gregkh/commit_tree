KVM: nVMX: Check GUEST_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL on VM-Entry

Add condition to nested_vmx_check_guest_state() to check the validity of
GUEST_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL. Per Intel's SDM Vol 3 26.3.1.1:

  If the "load IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL" VM-entry control is 1, bits
  reserved in the IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL MSR must be 0 in the field for that
  register.
