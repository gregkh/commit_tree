ALSA: hda: hdmi - fix kernel oops caused by invalid PCM idx

Add additional check in hdmi_find_pcm_slot() to not return
a pcm index that points to unallocated pcm. This could happen
if codec driver is set up in codec->mst_no_extra_pcms mode.
On some platforms, this leads to a kernel oops in snd_ctl_notify(),
called via update_eld().
