drm/i915/execlists: Flush the post-sync breadcrumb write harder

Quite rarely we see that the CS completion event fires before the
breadcrumb is coherent, which presumably is a result of the CS_STALL not
waiting for the post-sync operation. Try throwing in a DC_FLUSH into
the following pipecontrol to see if that makes any difference.
