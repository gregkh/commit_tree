media: cx88: Fix some error handling path in 'cx8800_initdev()'

A call to 'pci_disable_device()' is missing in the error handling path.
In some cases, a call to 'free_irq()' may also be missing.

Reorder the error handling path, add some new labels and fix the 2 issues
mentionned above.

This way, the error handling path in more in line with 'cx8800_finidev()'
(i.e. the remove function)
