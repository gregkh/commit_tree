Input: imx_sc_key - only take the valid data from SCU firmware as key state

When reading key state from SCU, the response data from SCU firmware
is 4 bytes due to MU message protocol, but ONLY the first byte is the
key state, other 3 bytes could be some dirty data, so we should ONLY
take the first byte as key state to avoid reporting incorrect state.
