x86/stacktrace: update kconfig help text for reliable unwinders

commit 6415b38bae26 ("x86/stacktrace: Enable HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE
for the ORC unwinder") added the ORC unwinder as a "reliable" unwinder.
Update the help text to reflect that change: the frame pointer unwinder
is no longer the only one that can provide HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE.
