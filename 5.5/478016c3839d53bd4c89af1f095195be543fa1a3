docs/arm64: cpu-feature-registers: Rewrite bitfields that don't follow [e, s]

Commit "docs/arm64: cpu-feature-registers: Documents missing visible
fields" added bitfields following the convention [s, e]. However, the
documentation is following [s, e] and so does the Arm ARM.

Rewrite the bitfields to match the format [s, e].
