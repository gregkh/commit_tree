ASoC: soc-core: add new pcm_construct/pcm_destruct

Current snd_soc_component_driver has pcm_new/pcm_free, but,
it doesn't have "component" at parameter.
Thus, each callback can't know it is called for which component.
Each callback currently is getting "component" by using
snd_soc_rtdcom_lookup() with driver name.

It works today, but, will not work in the future if we support multi
CPU/Codec/Platform, because 1 rtd might have multiple same driver
name component.

To solve this issue, each callback need to be called with component.
This patch adds new pcm_construct/pcm_destruct with "component"
parameter.
