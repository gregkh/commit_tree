power: reset: at91: fix __le32 cast in reset code

The writel() takes standard integers, not __le32 so
fix the following sparse warnings by removing the
cpu_to_le32() calls.

drivers/power/reset/at91-reset.c:134:9: warning: cast from restricted __le32
drivers/power/reset/at91-reset.c:143:9: warning: cast from restricted __le32

This has made no code changes, the md5sums pre and post applying
this patch are the same. The at91 should be natively little endian
anyway.
