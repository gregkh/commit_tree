nvme: introduce "Command Aborted By host" status code

Fix the status code of canceled requests initiated by the host according
to TP4028 (Status Code 0x371):
"Command Aborted By host: The command was aborted as a result of host
action (e.g., the host disconnected the Fabric connection)."

Also in a multipath environment, unless otherwise specified, errors of
this type (path related) should be retried using a different path, if
one is available.
