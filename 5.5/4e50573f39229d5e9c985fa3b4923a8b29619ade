gpio: mpc8xxx: Don't overwrite default irq_set_type callback

The per-SoC devtype structures can contain their own callbacks that
overwrite mpc8xxx_gpio_devtype_default.

The clear intention is that mpc8xxx_irq_set_type is used in case the SoC
does not specify a more specific callback. But what happens is that if
the SoC doesn't specify one, its .irq_set_type is de-facto NULL, and
this overwrites mpc8xxx_irq_set_type to a no-op. This means that the
following SoCs are affected:

- fsl,mpc8572-gpio
- fsl,ls1028a-gpio
- fsl,ls1088a-gpio

On these boards, the irq_set_type does exactly nothing, and the GPIO
controller keeps its GPICR register in the hardware-default state. On
the LS1028A, that is ACTIVE_BOTH, which means 2 interrupts are raised
even if the IRQ client requests LEVEL_HIGH. Another implication is that
the IRQs are not checked (e.g. level-triggered interrupts are not
rejected, although they are not supported).
