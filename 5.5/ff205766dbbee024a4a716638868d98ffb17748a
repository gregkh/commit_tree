ftrace: Fix function_graph tracer interaction with BPF trampoline

Depending on type of BPF programs served by BPF trampoline it can call original
function. In such case the trampoline will skip one stack frame while
returning. That will confuse function_graph tracer and will cause crashes with
bad RIP. Teach graph tracer to skip functions that have BPF trampoline attached.
