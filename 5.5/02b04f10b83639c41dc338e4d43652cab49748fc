ACPICA: acpiexec: initialize all simple types and field units from user input

ACPICA commit 367b363edc5fa1f93bbc14e4a1e05f34fef765a2

acpiexec allows a user to provide a file that indicates values to
initialize named objects during table load with the -fi option. This
can provide more accurate simulation by setting named objects to
values found during OS runtime.

Previously, this option only supported integer objects. This change
adds user initialization support for field units, strings, buffers,
and packages.
