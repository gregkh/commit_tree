USB: legousbtower: drop redundant interrupt-in running flag

Drop the redundant interrupt-in-running flag, which tried to keep track
of when the interrupt-in URB was in flight. This isn't needed since we
can stop the URB unconditionally in tower_abort_transfers() and the URB
can not be submitted while usb_kill_urb() is running anyway.
