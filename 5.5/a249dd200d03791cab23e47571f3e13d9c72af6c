tee: optee: Fix dynamic shm pool allocations

In case of dynamic shared memory pool, kernel memory allocated using
dmabuf_mgr pool needs to be registered with OP-TEE prior to its usage
during optee_open_session() or optee_invoke_func().

So fix dmabuf_mgr pool allocations via an additional call to
optee_shm_register().

Also, allow kernel pages to be registered as shared memory with OP-TEE.
