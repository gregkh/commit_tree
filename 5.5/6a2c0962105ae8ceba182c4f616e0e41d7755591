vsock: prevent transport modules unloading

This patch adds 'module' member in the 'struct vsock_transport'
in order to get/put the transport module. This prevents the
module unloading while sockets are assigned to it.

We increase the module refcnt when a socket is assigned to a
transport, and we decrease the module refcnt when the socket
is destructed.
