platform/x86: dell-laptop: disable kbd backlight on Inspiron 10xx

This patch adds a quirk disabling keyboard backlight support for the
Dell Inspiron 1012 and 1018.

Those models wrongly report supporting keyboard backlight control
features (through SMBIOS tokens) even though they're not equipped with
a backlit keyboard. This led to broken controls being exposed
through sysfs by this driver which froze the system when used.
