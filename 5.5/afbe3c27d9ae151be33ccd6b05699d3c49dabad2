samples: bpf: Update outdated error message

Currently, under samples, several methods are being used to load bpf
program.

Since using libbpf is preferred solution, lots of previously used
'load_bpf_file' from bpf_load are replaced with 'bpf_prog_load_xattr'
from libbpf.

But some of the error messages still show up as 'load_bpf_file' instead
of 'bpf_prog_load_xattr'.

This commit fixes outdated errror messages under samples and fixes some
code style issues.
