PM / devfreq: Make log message more explicit when devfreq device already exists

Before creating a new devfreq device devfreq_add_device() checks
if there is already a devfreq dev associated with the requesting
device (parent). If that's the case the function rejects to create
another devfreq dev for that parent and logs an error. The error
message is very unspecific, make it a bit more explicit.
