ARM: dts: add Netronix E60K02 board common file

The Netronix board E60K02 can be found some several Ebook-Readers,
at least the Kobo Clara HD and the Tolino Shine 3. The board
is equipped with different SoCs requiring different pinmuxes.

For now the following peripherals are included:
- LED
- Power Key
- Cover (gpio via hall sensor)
- RC5T619 PMIC (the kernel misses support for rtc and charger
  subdevices).
- Backlight via lm3630a
- Wifi sdio chip detection (mmc-powerseq and stuff)

It is based on vendor kernel but heavily reworked due to many
changed bindings.
