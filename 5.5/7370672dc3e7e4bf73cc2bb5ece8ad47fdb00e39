scsi: pm80xx: Squashed logging cleanup changes

The default logging doesn't include the device name, so it's difficult to
determine which controller is being logged about in error scenarios. The
logging level was only settable via sysfs, which made it inconvenient for
actual debugging. This changes the default to only cover error handling.
