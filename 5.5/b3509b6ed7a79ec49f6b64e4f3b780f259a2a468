perf script: Fix --reltime with --time

My earlier patch to just enable --reltime with --time was a little too
optimistic.  The --time parsing would accept absolute time, which is
very confusing to the user.

Support relative time in --time parsing too. This only works with recent
perf record that records the first sample time. Otherwise we error out.
