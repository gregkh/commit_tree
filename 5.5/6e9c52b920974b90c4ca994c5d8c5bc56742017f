staging: qlge: Refill rx buffers up to multiple of 16

Reading the {s,l}bq_prod_idx registers on a running device, it appears that
the adapter will only use buffers up to prod_idx & 0xfff0. The driver
currently uses fixed-size guard zones (16 for sbq, 32 for lbq - don't know
why this difference). After the previous patch, this approach no longer
guarantees prod_idx values aligned on multiples of 16. While it appears
that we can write unaligned values to prod_idx without ill effects on
device operation, it makes more sense to change qlge_refill_bq() to refill
up to a limit that corresponds with the device's behavior.
