perf probe: Fix to find range-only function instance

Fix die_is_func_instance() to find range-only function instance.

In some case, a function instance can be made without any low PC or
entry PC, but only with address ranges by optimization.  (e.g. cold text
partially in "text.unlikely" section) To find such function instance, we
have to check the range attribute too.
