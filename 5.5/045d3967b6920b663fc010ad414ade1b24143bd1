btrfs: rework arguments of btrfs_unlink_subvol

btrfs_unlink_subvol takes the name of the dentry and the root objectid
based on what kind of inode this is, either a real subvolume link or a
empty one that we inherited as a snapshot.  We need to fix how we unlink
in the case for BTRFS_EMPTY_SUBVOL_DIR_OBJECTID in the future, so rework
btrfs_unlink_subvol to just take the dentry and handle getting the right
objectid given the type of inode this is.  There is no functional change
here, simply pushing the work into btrfs_unlink_subvol() proper.
