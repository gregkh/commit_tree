docs: Add initial documentation for devfreq

The devfreq subsystem has plenty of kernel-doc comments but they're not
currently included in sphinx documentation.

Add a minimal devfreq.rst file which mostly just includes kernel-doc
comments from devfreq source. This also exposes a number of kernel-doc
warnings on `make htmldocs`
