dmaengine: sf-pdma: add platform DMA support for HiFive Unleashed A00

Add PDMA driver, sf-pdma, to enable DMA engine on HiFive Unleashed
Rev A00 board.

 - Implement dmaengine APIs, support MEM_TO_MEM async copy.
 - Tested by DMA Test client
 - Supports 4 channels DMA, each channel has 1 done and 1 err
   interrupt connected to platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC).
 - Depends on DMA_ENGINE and DMA_VIRTUAL_CHANNELS

The datasheet is here:

  https://static.dev.sifive.com/FU540-C000-v1.0.pdf

Follow the DMAengine controller doc,
"./Documentation/driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst" to implement DMA
engine. And use the dma test client in doc,
"./Documentation/driver-api/dmaengine/dmatest.rst", to test.

Each DMA channel has separate HW regs and support done and error ISRs.
4 channels share 1 done and 1 err ISRs. There's no expander/arbitrator
in DMA HW.
