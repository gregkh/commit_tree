perf scripting engines: Iterate on tep event arrays directly

Instead of calling a useless (and broken) helper function to get the
next event of a tep event array, just get the array directly and iterate
over it.

Note, the broken part was from trace_find_next_event() which after this
will no longer be used, and can be removed.

Committer notes:

This fixes a segfault when generating python scripts from perf.data
files with multiple tracepoint events, i.e. the following use case is
fixed by this patch:

  # perf record -e sched:* sleep 1
  [ perf record: Woken up 31 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.031 MB perf.data (9 samples) ]
  # perf script -g python
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
