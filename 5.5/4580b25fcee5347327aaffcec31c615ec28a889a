libbpf: Store map pin path and status in struct bpf_map

Support storing and setting a pin path in struct bpf_map, which can be used
for automatic pinning. Also store the pin status so we can avoid attempts
to re-pin a map that has already been pinned (or reused from a previous
pinning).

The behaviour of bpf_object__{un,}pin_maps() is changed so that if it is
called with a NULL path argument (which was previously illegal), it will
(un)pin only those maps that have a pin_path set.
