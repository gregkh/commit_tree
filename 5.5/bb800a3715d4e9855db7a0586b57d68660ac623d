backlight: qcom-wled: Rename PM8941* to WLED3

Rename the PM8941* references as WLED3 to make the driver
generic and have WLED support for other PMICs. Also rename
"i_boost_limit" and "i_limit" variables to "boost_i_limit"
and "string_i_limit" respectively to resemble the corresponding
register names.
