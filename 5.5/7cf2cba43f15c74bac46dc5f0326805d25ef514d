PCI: Unify ACS quirk desired vs provided checking

Most of the ACS quirks have a similar pattern of:

  acs_flags &= ~( <controls provided by this device> );
  return acs_flags ? 0 : 1;

Pull this out into a helper function to simplify the quirks slightly.  The
helper function is also a convenient place for comments about what the list
of ACS controls means.  No functional change intended.
