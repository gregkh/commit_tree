IB/mlx5: Test write combining support

Linux can run in all sorts of physical machines and VMs where write
combining may or may not be supported. Currently there is no way to
reliably tell if the system supports WC, or not. The driver uses WC to
optimize posting work to the HCA, and getting this wrong in either
direction can cause a significant performance loss.

Add a test in mlx5_ib initialization process to test whether
write-combining is supported on the machine.  The test will run as part of
the enable_driver callback to ensure that the test runs after the device
is setup and can create and modify the QP needed, but runs before the
device is exposed to the users.

The test opens UD QP and posts NOP WQEs, the WQE written to the BlueFlame
is different from the WQE in memory, requesting CQE only on the BlueFlame
WQE. By checking whether we received a completion on one of these WQEs we
can know if BlueFlame succeeded and this write-combining must be
supported.

Change reporting of BlueFlame support to be dependent on write-combining
support instead of the FW's guess as to what the machine can do.
