drm/amd/display: Map DSC resources 1-to-1 if numbers of OPPs and DSCs are equal

[why]
On ASICs where number of DSCs is the same as OPPs there's no need
for DSC resource management. Mappping 1-to-1 fixes mode-set- or S3-
-related issues for such platforms.

[how]
Map DSC resources 1-to-1 to pipes only if number of OPPs is the same
as number of DSCs. This will still keep other ASICs working.
A follow-up patch to fix mode-set issues on those ASICs will be
required if testing shows issues with mode set.
