USB: serial: io_edgeport: handle unbound ports on URB completion

Check for NULL port data in the shared interrupt and bulk completion
callbacks to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer in case a device sends
data for a port device which isn't bound to a driver (e.g. due to a
malicious device having unexpected endpoints or after an allocation
failure on port probe).
