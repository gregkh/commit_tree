HID: hyperv: Add the support of hibernation

During the suspend process and resume process, if there is any mouse
event, there is a small chance the suspend and the resume process can be
aborted because of mousevsc_on_receive() -> pm_wakeup_hard_event().

This behavior can be avoided by disabling the Hyper-V mouse device as
a wakeup source:

echo disabled > /sys/bus/vmbus/drivers/hid_hyperv/XXX/power/wakeup
(XXX is the device's GUID).
