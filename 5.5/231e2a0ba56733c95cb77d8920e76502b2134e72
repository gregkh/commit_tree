smb3: improve check for when we send the security descriptor context on create

We had cases in the previous patch where we were sending the security
descriptor context on SMB3 open (file create) in cases when we hadn't
mounted with with "modefromsid" mount option.

Add check for that mount flag before calling ad_sd_context in
open init.
