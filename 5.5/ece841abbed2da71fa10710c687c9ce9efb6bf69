block: fix memleak of bio integrity data

7c20f11680a4 ("bio-integrity: stop abusing bi_end_io") moves
bio_integrity_free from bio_uninit() to bio_integrity_verify_fn()
and bio_endio(). This way looks wrong because bio may be freed
without calling bio_endio(), for example, blk_rq_unprep_clone() is
called from dm_mq_queue_rq() when the underlying queue of dm-mpath
is busy.

So memory leak of bio integrity data is caused by commit 7c20f11680a4.

Fixes this issue by re-adding bio_integrity_free() to bio_uninit().
