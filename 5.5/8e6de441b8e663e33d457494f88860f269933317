net: hns3: add support for configuring VF MAC from the host

This patch adds support of configuring VF MAC from the host
for the HNS3 driver.

BTW, the parameter init in the hns3_init_mac_addr is
unnecessary now, since the MAC address will not read from
NCL_CONFIG when doing reset, so it should be removed,
otherwise it will affect VF's MAC address initialization.
