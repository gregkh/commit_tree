KVM: VMX: Add helper to check reserved bits in IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL

Create a helper function to check the validity of a proposed value for
IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL from the existing check in intel_pmu_set_msr().

Per Intel's SDM, the reserved bits in IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL must be
cleared for the corresponding host/guest state fields.
