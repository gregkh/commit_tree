io_uring: make POLL_ADD/POLL_REMOVE scale better

One of the obvious use cases for these commands is networking, where
it's not uncommon to have tons of sockets open and polled for. The
current implementation uses a list for insertion and lookup, which works
fine for file based use cases where the count is usually low, it breaks
down somewhat for higher number of files / sockets. A test case with
30k sockets being polled for and cancelled takes:

real    0m6.968s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m6.936s

with the patch it takes:

real    0m0.233s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m0.176s

If you go to 50k sockets, it gets even more abysmal with the current
code:

real    0m40.602s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m40.555s

with the patch it takes:

real    0m0.398s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.341s

Change is pretty straight forward, just replace the cancel_list with
a red/black tree instead.
