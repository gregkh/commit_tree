tracing: Fix endianness bug in histogram trigger

At least on PA-RISC and s390 synthetic histogram triggers are failing
selftests because trace_event_raw_event_synth() always writes a 64 bit
values, but the reader expects a field->size sized value. On little endian
machines this doesn't hurt, but on big endian this makes the reader always
read zero values.
