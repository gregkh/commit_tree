efi/gop: Fix memory leak in __gop_query32/64()

efi_graphics_output_protocol::query_mode() returns info in
callee-allocated memory which must be freed by the caller, which
we aren't doing.

We don't actually need to call query_mode() in order to obtain the
info for the current graphics mode, which is already there in
gop->mode->info, so just access it directly in the setup_gop32/64()
functions.

Also nothing uses the size of the info structure, so don't update the
passed-in size (which is the size of the gop_handle table in bytes)
unnecessarily.
