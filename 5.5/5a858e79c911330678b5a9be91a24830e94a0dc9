ALSA: hda - Disable audio component for legacy Nvidia HDMI codecs

The old Nvidia chips have multiple HD-audio codecs on the same
HD-audio controller, and this doesn't work as expected with the current
audio component binding that is implemented under the one-codec-per-
controller assumption; at the probe time, the driver leads to several
kernel WARNING messages.

For the proper support, we may change the pin2port and port2pin to
traverse the codec list per the given pin number, but this needs more
development and testing.

As a quick workaround, instead, this patch drops the binding in the
audio side for these legacy chips since the audio component support in
nouveau graphics driver is still not merged (hence it's basically
unused).
