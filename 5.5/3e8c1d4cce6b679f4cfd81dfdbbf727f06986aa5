clk: renesas: rcar-gen2: Improve arithmetic divisions

- Use div64_ul() instead of div_u64() if the divisor is unsigned long,
    to avoid truncation to 32-bit on 64-bit platforms,
  - Prefer ULL constant suffixes over casts to u64,
  - Prioritize multiplication over division, to increase accuracy.
