net: dsa: Prevent usage of NET_DSA_TAG_8021Q as tagging protocol

It is possible for a switch driver to use NET_DSA_TAG_8021Q as a valid
DSA tagging protocol since it registers itself as such, unfortunately
since there are not xmit or rcv functions provided, the lack of a xmit()
function will lead to a NPD in dsa_slave_xmit() to start with.

net/dsa/tag_8021q.c is only comprised of a set of helper functions at
the moment, but is not a fully autonomous or functional tagging "driver"
(though it could become later on). We do not have any users of
NET_DSA_TAG_8021Q so now is a good time to make sure there are not
issues being encountered by making this file strictly a place holder for
helper functions.
