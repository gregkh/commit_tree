net: phylink: fix interface passed to mac_link_up

A mismerge between the following two commits:

c678726305b9 ("net: phylink: ensure consistent phy interface mode")
27755ff88c0e ("net: phylink: Add phylink_mac_link_{up, down} wrapper functions")

resulted in the wrong interface being passed to the mac_link_up()
function. Fix this up.
