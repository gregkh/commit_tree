x86/resctrl: Fix an imbalance in domain_remove_cpu()

A system that supports resource monitoring may have multiple resources
while not all of these resources are capable of monitoring. Monitoring
related state is initialized only for resources that are capable of
monitoring and correspondingly this state should subsequently only be
removed from these resources that are capable of monitoring.

domain_add_cpu() calls domain_setup_mon_state() only when r->mon_capable
is true where it will initialize d->mbm_over. However,
domain_remove_cpu() calls cancel_delayed_work(&d->mbm_over) without
checking r->mon_capable resulting in an attempt to cancel d->mbm_over on
all resources, even those that never initialized d->mbm_over because
they are not capable of monitoring. Hence, it triggers a debugobjects
warning when offlining CPUs because those timer debugobjects are never
initialized:

  ODEBUG: assert_init not available (active state 0) object type:
  timer_list hint: 0x0
