pstore/ram: Regularize prz label allocation lifetime

In my attempt to fix a memory leak, I introduced a double-free in the
pstore error path. Instead of trying to manage the allocation lifetime
between persistent_ram_new() and its callers, adjust the logic so
persistent_ram_new() always takes a kstrdup() copy, and leaves the
caller's allocation lifetime up to the caller. Therefore callers are
_always_ responsible for freeing their label. Before, it only needed
freeing when the prz itself failed to allocate, and not in any of the
other prz failure cases, which callers would have no visibility into,
which is the root design problem that lead to both the leak and now
double-free bugs.
