spi: spidev: use new `delay` field for spi transfers

The `delay` field has type `struct spi_delay`.
This allows users to specify nano-second or clock-cycle delays (if needed).

Converting to use `delay` is straightforward: it's just assigning the
value to `delay.value` and hard-coding the `delay.unit` to
`SPI_DELAY_UNIT_USECS`.

This keeps the uapi for spidev un-changed. Changing it can be part of
another changeset and discussion.
