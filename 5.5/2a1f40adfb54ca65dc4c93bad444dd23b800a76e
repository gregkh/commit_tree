rseq/selftests: Clarify rseq_prepare_unload() helper requirements

The rseq.h UAPI now documents that the rseq_cs field must be cleared
before reclaiming memory that contains the targeted struct rseq_cs, but
also that the rseq_cs field must be cleared before reclaiming memory of
the code pointed to by the rseq_cs start_ip and post_commit_offset
fields.

While we can expect that use of dlclose(3) will typically unmap
both struct rseq_cs and its associated code at once, nothing would
theoretically prevent a JIT from reclaiming the code without
reclaiming the struct rseq_cs, which would erroneously allow the
kernel to consider new code which is not a rseq critical section
as a rseq critical section following a code reclaim.
