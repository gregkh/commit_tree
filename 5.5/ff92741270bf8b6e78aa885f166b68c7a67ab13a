net: introduce name_node struct to be used in hashlist

Introduce name_node structure to hold name of device and put it into
hashlist instead of putting there struct net_device directly. Add a
necessary infrastructure to manipulate the hashlist. This prepares
the code to use the same hashlist for alternative names introduced
later in this set.
