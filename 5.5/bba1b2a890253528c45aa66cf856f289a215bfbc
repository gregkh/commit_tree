samples: bpf: Replace symbol compare of trace_event

Previously, when this sample is added, commit 1c47910ef8013
("samples/bpf: add perf_event+bpf example"), a symbol 'sys_read' and
'sys_write' has been used without no prefixes. But currently there are
no exact symbols with these under kallsyms and this leads to failure.

This commit changes exact compare to substring compare to keep compatible
with exact symbol or prefixed symbol.

Fixes: 1c47910ef8013 ("samples/bpf: add perf_event+bpf example")
