soc: qcom: Invert the cooling states for the aoss warming devices

Thermal framework takes 0 as the lowest/default state for a
cooling/warming device. The current code has the order inverted with 1
corresponding to lowest state in hardware and 0 the highest state.
Invert this for a better fit with the thermal framework.
