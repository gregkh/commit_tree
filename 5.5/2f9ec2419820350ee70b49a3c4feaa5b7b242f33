ice: Don't modify stripping for add/del VLANs on VF

Currently when adding/deleting vlans in ice_vc_process_vlan_msg()
we are calling ice_vsi_manage_vlan_stripping() to enable/disable
when adding and deleting a VLAN respectively. This is wrong
because adding/deleting VLANs has nothing to do with configuring
VLAN stripping. VLAN stripping is configured through the
following VIRTCHNL operations:
	VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_VLAN_STRIPPING
	VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_VLAN_STRIPPING

Unfortunately we can't just remove this because then stripping
will never be configured on VF initialization. Fix this by
adding a new function that initializes (disables/enables) VLAN
stripping for the VF based on the device supported capabilities.
This allows us to remove the call to
ice_vsi_manage_vlan_stripping() in ice_vc_process_vlan_msg().
