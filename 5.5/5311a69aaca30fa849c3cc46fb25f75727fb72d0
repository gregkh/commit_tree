net, ip6_tunnel: fix namespaces move

in the same manner as commit d0f418516022 ("net, ip_tunnel: fix
namespaces move"), fix namespace moving as it was broken since commit
8d79266bc48c ("ip6_tunnel: add collect_md mode to IPv6 tunnel"), but for
ipv6 this time; there is no reason to keep it for ip6_tunnel.

Fixes: 8d79266bc48c ("ip6_tunnel: add collect_md mode to IPv6 tunnel")
