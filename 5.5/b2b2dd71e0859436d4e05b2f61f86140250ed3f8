tty: vt: keyboard: reject invalid keycodes

Do not try to handle keycodes that are too big, otherwise we risk doing
out-of-bounds writes:

In this case we were dealing with a fuzzed HID device that declared over
12K buttons, and while HID layer should not be reporting to us such big
keycodes, we should also be defensive and reject invalid data ourselves as
well.
