selftests/bpf: Make a copy of subtest name

test_progs never created a copy of subtest name, rather just stored
pointer to whatever string test provided. This is bad as that string
might be freed or modified by the end of subtest. Fix this by creating
a copy of given subtest name when subtest starts.
