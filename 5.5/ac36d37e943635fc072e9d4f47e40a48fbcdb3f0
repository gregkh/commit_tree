ACPI: Always build evged in

Although the Generic Event Device is a Hardware-reduced
platfom device in principle, it should not be restricted to
ACPI_REDUCED_HARDWARE_ONLY.

Kernels supporting both fixed and hardware-reduced ACPI platforms
should be able to probe the GED when dynamically detecting that a
platform is hardware-reduced. For that, the driver must be
unconditionally built in.
