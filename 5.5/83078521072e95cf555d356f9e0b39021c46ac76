ASoC: adau1761: Add PGA Slew time control

The PGA Slew Time control allows to configure the rate with which the PGA
gain control ramps up/down to the target setting.

The PGA slew control is done via the ALC Control 0 register. There are 2
bits on that reg, that control PGA slew time, while the other bits control
parts of the ALC (automatic level control) block.
