dt-bindings: clock: Add r8a77961 CPG Core Clock Definitions

Add all Clock Pulse Generator Core Clock Outputs for the Renesas R-Car
M3-W+ (R8A77961) SoC, as listed in Table 8.2b ("List of Clocks [R-Car
M3-W/R-Car M3-W+]") of the R-Car Series, 3rd Generation Hardware User's
Manual (Rev. 2.00, Jul. 31, 2019).  A gap is added for CSIREF, to
preserve compatibility with the definitions for R-Car M3-W (R8A77960).

Note that internal CPG clocks (S0, S1, S2, S3, SDSRC, SSPSRC, and POST2)
are not included, as they are used as internal clock sources only, and
never referenced from DT.
