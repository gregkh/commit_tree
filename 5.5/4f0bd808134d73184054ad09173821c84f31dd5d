asm-generic/nds32: don't redefine cacheflush primitives

The commit c296d4dc13ae ("asm-generic: fix a compilation warning") changed
asm-generic/cachflush.h to use static inlines instead of macros and as a
result the nds32 build with CONFIG_CPU_CACHE_ALIASING=n fails:

      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Surround the inline functions in asm-generic/cacheflush.h by ifdef's so
that architectures could override them and add the required overrides to
nds32.
