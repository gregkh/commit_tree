ata: libahci_platform: Export again ahci_platform_<en/dis>able_phys()

This reverts commit 6bb86fefa086faba7b60bb452300b76a47cde1a5
("libahci_platform: Staticize ahci_platform_<en/dis>able_phys()") we are
going to need ahci_platform_{enable,disable}_phys() in a subsequent
commit for ahci_brcm.c in order to properly control the PHY
initialization order.

Also make sure the function prototypes are declared in
include/linux/ahci_platform.h as a result.
