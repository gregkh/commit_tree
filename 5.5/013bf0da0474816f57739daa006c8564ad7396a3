ftrace: Add ftrace_find_direct_func()

As function_graph tracer modifies the return address to insert a trampoline
to trace the return of a function, it must be aware of a direct caller, as
when it gets called, the function's return address may not be at on the
stack where it expects. It may have to see if that return address points to
the a direct caller and adjust if it is.
