drm/i915: Protect request peeking with RCU

Since the execlists_active() is no longer protected by the
engine->active.lock, we need to protect the request pointer with RCU to
prevent it being freed as we evaluate whether or not we need to preempt.

Fixes: df403069029d ("drm/i915/execlists: Lift process_csb() out of the irq-off spinlock")
Fixes: 13ed13a4dcbf ("drm/i915: Don't set queue_priority_hint if we don't kick the submission")
