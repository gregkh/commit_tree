reset: brcmstb: Remove resource checks

The use of IS_ALIGNED() is incorrect, the typical resource we pass looks
like this: start: 0x8404318, size: 0x30. When using IS_ALIGNED() we will
get the following 0x8404318 & (0x18 - 1) = 0x10 which is definitively
not equal to 0, same goes with the size. These two checks would make the
driver fail probing.

Remove the resource checks, since there should be no constraint on the
base addresse or size.
