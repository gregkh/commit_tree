ice: Fix setting coalesce to handle DCB configuration

Currently there can be a case where a DCB map is applied and there are
more interrupt vectors (vsi->num_q_vectors) than Rx queues (vsi->num_rxq)
and Tx queues (vsi->num_txq). If we try to set coalesce settings in this
case it will report a false failure. Fix this by checking if vector index
is valid with respect to the number of Tx and Rx queues configured.
