drm/amd/display: remove hw access from dc_destroy

[why]
dc_destroy should only clean up SW, this is because GPUs may be
removed before driver unload, leading to HW to be unavailable.

[how]
remove GPIO close as part of GPIO destroy, this is unnecessary because
GPIO is not shared, and GPIOs are generally closed after being opened

Add tracking to HW access during destructor to make future issues
easier to pinpoint, and block access to prevent hangs.
