crypto: inside-secure - Remove #ifdef checks

When both PCI and OF are disabled, no drivers are registered, and
we get some unused-function warnings:

drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel.c:1221:13: error: unused function 'safexcel_unregister_algorithms' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
static void safexcel_unregister_algorithms(struct safexcel_crypto_priv *priv)
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel.c:1307:12: error: unused function 'safexcel_probe_generic' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
static int safexcel_probe_generic(void *pdev,
drivers/crypto/inside-secure/safexcel.c:1531:13: error: unused function 'safexcel_hw_reset_rings' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
static void safexcel_hw_reset_rings(struct safexcel_crypto_priv *priv)

It's better to make the compiler see what is going on and remove
such ifdef checks completely. In case of PCI, this is trivial since
pci_register_driver() is defined to an empty function that makes the
compiler subsequently drop all unused code silently.

The global pcireg_rc/ofreg_rc variables are not actually needed here
since the driver registration does not fail in ways that would make
it helpful.

For CONFIG_OF, an IS_ENABLED() check is still required, since platform
drivers can exist both with and without it.

A little change to linux/pci.h is needed to ensure that
pcim_enable_device() is visible to the driver. Moving the declaration
outside of ifdef would be sufficient here, but for consistency with the
rest of the file, adding an inline helper is probably best.
