net: bridge: deny dev_set_mac_address() when unregistering

We have an interesting memory leak in the bridge when it is being
unregistered and is a slave to a master device which would change the
mac of its slaves on unregister (e.g. bond, team). This is a very
unusual setup but we do end up leaking 1 fdb entry because
dev_set_mac_address() would cause the bridge to insert the new mac address
into its table after all fdbs are flushed, i.e. after dellink() on the
bridge has finished and we call NETDEV_UNREGISTER the bond/team would
release it and will call dev_set_mac_address() to restore its original
address and that in turn will add an fdb in the bridge.
One fix is to check for the bridge dev's reg_state in its
ndo_set_mac_address callback and return an error if the bridge is not in
NETREG_REGISTERED.

Easy steps to reproduce:
 1. add bond in mode != A/B
 2. add any slave to the bond
 3. add bridge dev as a slave to the bond
 4. destroy the bridge device
