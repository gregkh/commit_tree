RDMA/odp: Remove broken debugging call to invalidate_range

invalidate_range() also obtains the umem_mutex which is being held at this
point, so if this path were was ever called it would deadlock. Thus
conclude the debugging never triggers and rework it into a simple WARN_ON
and leave things as they are.

While here add a note to explain how we could possibly get inconsistent
page pointers.
