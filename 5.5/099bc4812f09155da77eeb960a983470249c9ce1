powerpc/irq: fix stack overflow verification

Before commit 0366a1c70b89 ("powerpc/irq: Run softirqs off the top of
the irq stack"), check_stack_overflow() was called by do_IRQ(), before
switching to the irq stack.
In that commit, do_IRQ() was renamed __do_irq(), and is now executing
on the irq stack, so check_stack_overflow() has just become almost
useless.

Move check_stack_overflow() call in do_IRQ() to do the check while
still on the current stack.
