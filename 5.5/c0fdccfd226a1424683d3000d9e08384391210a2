net/ixgbe: Fix concurrency issues between config flow and XSK

Use synchronize_rcu to wait until the XSK wakeup function finishes
before destroying the resources it uses:

1. ixgbe_down already calls synchronize_rcu after setting __IXGBE_DOWN.

2. After switching the XDP program, call synchronize_rcu to let
ixgbe_xsk_wakeup exit before the XDP program is freed.

3. Changing the number of channels brings the interface down.

4. Disabling UMEM sets __IXGBE_TX_DISABLED before closing hardware
resources and resetting xsk_umem. Check that bit in ixgbe_xsk_wakeup to
avoid using the XDP ring when it's already destroyed. synchronize_rcu is
called from ixgbe_txrx_ring_disable.
