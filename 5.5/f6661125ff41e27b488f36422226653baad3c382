perf beauty: Add CLEAR_SIGHAND support for clone's flags arg

Add support for the recently added CLONE_CLEAR_SIGHAND flag.

This takes advantage of the copy of the uapi/linux/sched.h we have in
tools/include, which allows us to build tools/perf in older systems and
have the binary support printing that flag whenever that system gets its
kernel updated to one where this feature is present.
