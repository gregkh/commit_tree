audit: Report suspicious O_CREAT usage

This renames the very specific audit_log_link_denied() to
audit_log_path_denied() and adds the AUDIT_* type as an argument. This
allows for the creation of the new AUDIT_ANOM_CREAT that can be used to
report the fifo/regular file creation restrictions that were introduced
in commit 30aba6656f61 ("namei: allow restricted O_CREAT of FIFOs and
regular files").
