net: openvswitch: add flow-mask cache for performance

The idea of this optimization comes from a patch which
is committed in 2014, openvswitch community. The author
is Pravin B Shelar. In order to get high performance, I
implement it again. Later patches will use it.

Pravin B Shelar, says:
| On every packet OVS needs to lookup flow-table with every
| mask until it finds a match. The packet flow-key is first
| masked with mask in the list and then the masked key is
| looked up in flow-table. Therefore number of masks can
| affect packet processing performance.
