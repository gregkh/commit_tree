net/smc: immediate termination for SMCD link groups

SMCD link group termination is called when peer signals its shutdown
of its corresponding link group. For regular shutdowns no connections
exist anymore. For abnormal shutdowns connections must be killed and
their DMBs must be unregistered immediately. That means the SMCR method
to delay the link group freeing several seconds does not fit.

This patch adds immediate termination of a link group and its SMCD
connections and makes sure all SMCD link group related cleanup steps
are finished.
