ALSA: aloop: Avoid pointer dereference before null-check

Static analysis tools (cppcheck and PVS Studio) report an error
in loopback_snd_timer_period_elapsed() regarding dpcm_play pointer
dereference earlier than its null-check. And although this is a result
of a formal check, and the pointer correctness is also protected
by having a corresponding bit set in the "running" mask, re-ordering
of the lines can imake the code even formally correct and eliminate
those static analysis error reports.
