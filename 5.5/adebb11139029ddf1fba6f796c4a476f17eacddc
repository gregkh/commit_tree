ASoC: Intel: cht_bsw_rt5645: Add quirk for boards using pmc_plt_clk_0

As of commit 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as
CLK_IS_CRITICAL"), the cht_bsw_rt5645 driver needs to enable the clock
it's using for the codec's mclk. It does this from commit 7735bce05a9c
("ASoC: Intel: boards: use devm_clk_get() unconditionally"), enabling
pmc_plt_clk_3. However, Strago family Chromebooks use pmc_plt_clk_0 for
the codec mclk, resulting in white noise with some digital microphones.
Add a DMI-based quirk for Strago family Chromebooks to use pmc_plt_clk_0
instead - mirroring the changes made to cht_bsw_max98090_ti in
commit a182ecd3809c ("ASoC: intel: cht_bsw_max98090_ti: Add quirk for
boards using pmc_plt_clk_0") and making use of the existing
dmi_check_system() call and related infrastructure added in
commit 22af29114eb4 ("ASoC: Intel: cht-bsw-rt5645: add quirks for
SSP0/AIF1/AIF2 routing").
