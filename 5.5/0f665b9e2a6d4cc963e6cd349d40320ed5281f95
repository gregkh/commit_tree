xtensa: use the generic uncached segment support

Switch xtensa over to use the generic uncached support, and thus the
generic implementations of dma_alloc_* and dma_alloc_*, which also
gains support for mmaping DMA memory.  The non-working nommu DMA
support has been disabled, but could be re-enabled easily if platforms
that actually have an uncached segment show up.
