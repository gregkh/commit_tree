octeontx2-af: Add option to disable dynamic entry caching in NDC

A config option is added to disable caching of dynamic entries
like SQEs and stack pages. Also locks down all HW contexts in NDC,
preventing them from being evicted.

This option is useful when the queue count is large and there are
huge NDC cache misses. It's trade off between SQ context misses and
dynamically changing entries like SQE and stack page pointers.
