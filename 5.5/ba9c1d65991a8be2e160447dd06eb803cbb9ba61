xtensa: rearrange syscall tracing

system_call saves and restores syscall number across system call to make
clone and execv entry and exit tracing match. This complicates things
when syscall code may be changed by ptrace.
Preserve syscall code in copy_thread and start_thread directly instead of
doing tricks in system_call.
