habanalabs: rate limit error msg on waiting for CS

In case a user submits a CS, and the submission fails, and the user doesn't
check the return value and instead use the error return value as a valid
sequence number of a CS and ask to wait on it, the driver will print an
error and return an error code for that wait.

The real problem happens if now the user ignores the error of the wait, and
try to wait again and again. This can lead to a flood of error messages
from the driver and even soft lockup event.
