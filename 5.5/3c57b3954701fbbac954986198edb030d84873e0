nfc: pn532: Add uart phy docs and rename it

This adds documentation about the uart phy to the pn532 binding doc. As
the filename "pn533-i2c.txt" is not appropriate any more, rename it to
the more general "pn532.txt".
This also documents the deprecation of the compatible strings ending
with "...-i2c".
