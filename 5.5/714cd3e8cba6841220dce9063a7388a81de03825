btrfs: handle ENOENT in btrfs_uuid_tree_iterate

If we get an -ENOENT back from btrfs_uuid_iter_rem when iterating the
uuid tree we'll just continue and do btrfs_next_item().  However we've
done a btrfs_release_path() at this point and no longer have a valid
path.  So increment the key and go back and do a normal search.
