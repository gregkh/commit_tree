workqueue: Add RCU annotation for pwq list walk

An additional check has been recently added to ensure that a RCU related lock
is held while the RCU list is iterated.
The `pwqs' are sometimes iterated without a RCU lock but with the &wq->mutex
acquired leading to a warning.

Teach list_for_each_entry_rcu() that the RCU usage is okay if &wq->mutex
is acquired during the list traversal.
