crypto: arm/chacha - expose ARM ChaCha routine as library function

Expose the accelerated NEON ChaCha routine directly as a symbol
export so that users of the ChaCha library API can use it directly.

Given that calls into the library API will always go through the
routines in this module if it is enabled, switch to static keys
to select the optimal implementation available (which may be none
at all, in which case we defer to the generic implementation for
all invocations).
