userfaultfd: remove unnecessary WARN_ON() in __mcopy_atomic_hugetlb()

These warning here is to make sure address(dst_addr) and length(len -
copied) are huge page size aligned.

While this is ensured by:

    dst_start and len is huge page size aligned
    dst_addr equals to dst_start and increase huge page size each time
    copied increase huge page size each time

This means these warnings will never be triggered.
