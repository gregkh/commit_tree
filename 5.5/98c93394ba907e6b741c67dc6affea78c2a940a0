drm/i915: Refuse modes with hdisplay==4096 on pre-HSW DP

The DP port/pipe goes wonky if we try to use timings with
hdisplay==4096 on pre-HSW platforms. The link fails to train
and the pipe may not signal vblank interrupts. On HDMI such at
mode works just fine (tested on ELK/SNB/CHV). So let's refuse
such modes on DP on older platforms.
