efi/gop: Return EFI_NOT_FOUND if there are no usable GOPs

If we don't find a usable instance of the Graphics Output Protocol
(GOP) because none of them have a framebuffer (i.e. they were all
PIXEL_BLT_ONLY), but all the EFI calls succeeded, we will return
EFI_SUCCESS even though we didn't find a usable GOP.

Fix this by explicitly returning EFI_NOT_FOUND if no usable GOPs are
found, allowing the caller to probe for UGA instead.
