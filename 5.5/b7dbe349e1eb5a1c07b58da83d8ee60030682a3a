ARM: dts: omap34xx & omap36xx: replace opp-v1 tables by opp-v2 for

With the driver installed, we can change the opp-v1 table format
to opp-v2.

In addition, move omap3 from whitelist to blacklist in cpufreq-dt-platdev
in the same patch, because doing either first breaks operation and
may make trouble in bisect.

We also can remove opp-v1 table for omap3-n950-n9 since its 1GHz
capability is now automatically detected.

We also fix a wrong OPP4 voltage for omap3430 which must be
0.6V + 54*12.5mV = 1275mV. Otherwise the twl4030 driver will reject
this OPP.

Note: the high speed OPPs that were not available in the opp-v1 tables
are tagged "turbo-mode;" which means they are not automatically
activated by the govenors or cpu-freq.

To enable you have to write

echo 1 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost

Note: to hard disable an OPP in a board.dts file use e.g.

&cpu0_opp_table: {
	/delete-node/ opp1g-1000000000;	/* do not use */
};

or alternatively:

&cpu0_opp_table: {
	opp1g-1000000000 {
		status = "disabled";	/* do not use */
	};
};
