tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Add int argument to command functions

The current code structure has similar but separate command functions for
the enable and disable operations.  This can be improved by adding an int
argument to the command function structure, and interpreting 1 as enable
and 0 as disable.  This change results in the removal of the disable
command functions.

Add int argument to the command function structure.
