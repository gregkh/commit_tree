block: allow partitions on host aware zone devices

Host-aware SMR drives can be used with the commands to explicitly manage
zone state, but they can also be used as normal disks.  In the former
case it makes perfect sense to allow partitions on them, in the latter
it does not, just like for host managed devices.  Add a check to
add_partition to allow partitions on host aware devices, but give
up any zone management capabilities in that case, which also catches
the previously missed case of adding a partition vs just scanning it.

Because sd can rescan the attribute at runtime it needs to check if
a disk has partitions, for which a new helper is added to genhd.h.
