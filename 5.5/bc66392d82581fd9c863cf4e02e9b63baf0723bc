arm64: dts: fsl: Add device tree for S32V234-EVB

Add initial version of device tree for S32V234-EVB, including nodes for the
4 Cortex-A53 cores, AIPS bus with UART modules, ARM architected timer and
Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC).

Keep SoC level separate from board level to let future boards with this SoC
share common properties, while the dts files will keep board-dependent
properties.
