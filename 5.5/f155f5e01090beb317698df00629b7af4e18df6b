gfs2: fix infinite loop in gfs2_ail1_flush on io error

Before this patch, an IO error encountered in function gfs2_ail1_flush
would cause a deadlock: because of the io error (and its resulting
withdrawn state), buffers stopped being written to the journal.
Buffers would remain on the ail1 list, so gfs2_ail1_start_one would
return 1 to indicate dirty buffers were still on the ail1 list.
However, when function gfs2_ail1_flush got a non-zero return code,
it would goto restart to retry the writes, which meant it would never
finish, and thus the infinite loop.
