net_sched: fix datalen for ematch

syzbot reported an out-of-bound access in em_nbyte. As initially
analyzed by Eric, this is because em_nbyte sets its own em->datalen
in em_nbyte_change() other than the one specified by user, but this
value gets overwritten later by its caller tcf_em_validate().
We should leave em->datalen untouched to respect their choices.

I audit all the in-tree ematch users, all of those implement
->change() set em->datalen, so we can just avoid setting it twice
in this case.
