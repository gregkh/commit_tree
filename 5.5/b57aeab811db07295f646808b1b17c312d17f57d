powerpc/watchpoint: Fix length calculation for unaligned target

Watchpoint match range is always doubleword(8 bytes) aligned on
powerpc. If the given range is crossing doubleword boundary, we need
to increase the length such that next doubleword also get
covered. Ex,

          address   len = 6 bytes
                |=========.
   |------------v--|------v--------|
   | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
   |---------------|---------------|
    <---8 bytes--->

In such case, current code configures hw as:
  start_addr = address & ~HW_BREAKPOINT_ALIGN
  len = 8 bytes

And thus read/write in last 4 bytes of the given range is ignored.
Fix this by including next doubleword in the length.
