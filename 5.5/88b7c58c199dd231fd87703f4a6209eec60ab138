net: hns3: minor optimization for barrier in IO path

Currently, the TX and RX ring in a queue is bounded to the
same IRQ, there may be unnecessary barrier op when only one of
the ring need to be processed.

This patch adjusts the location of rmb() in hns3_clean_tx_ring()
and adds a checking in hns3_clean_rx_ring() to avoid unnecessary
barrier op when there is nothing to do for the ring.
