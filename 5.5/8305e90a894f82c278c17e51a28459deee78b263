firmware: arm_scmi: Avoid double free in error flow

If device_register() fails, both put_device() and kfree() are called,
ending with a double free of the scmi_dev.

Calling kfree() is needed only when a failure happens between the
allocation of the scmi_dev and its registration, so move it to there
and remove it from the error flow.
