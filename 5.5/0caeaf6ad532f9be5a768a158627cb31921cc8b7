cxgb4/cxgb4vf: fix flow control display for auto negotiation

As per 802.3-2005, Section Two, Annex 28B, Table 28B-2 [1], when
_only_ Rx pause is enabled, both symmetric and asymmetric pause
towards local device must be enabled. Also, firmware returns the local
device's flow control pause params as part of advertised capabilities
and negotiated params as part of current link attributes. So, fix up
ethtool's flow control pause params fetch logic to read from acaps,
instead of linkattr.
