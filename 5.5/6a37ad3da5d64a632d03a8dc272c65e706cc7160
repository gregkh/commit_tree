net/smc: wait for tx completions before link freeing

Make sure all pending work requests are completed before freeing
a link.
Dismiss tx pending slots already when terminating a link group to
exploit termination shortcut in tx completion queue handler.

And kill the completion queue tasklets after destroy of the
completion queues, otherwise there is a time window for another
tasklet schedule of an already killed tasklet.
