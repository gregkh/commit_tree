mm/mmap.c: prev could be retrieved from vma->vm_prev

Currently __vma_unlink_common handles two cases:

  * has_prev
  * or not

When has_prev is false, it is obvious prev is calculated from
vma->vm_prev in __vma_unlink_common.

When has_prev is true, the prev is passed through from __vma_unlink_prev
in __vma_adjust for non-case 8.  And at the beginning next is calculated
from vma->vm_next, which implies vma is next->vm_prev.

The above statement sounds a little complicated, while to think in
another point of view, no matter whether vma and next is swapped, the
mmap link list still preserves its property.  It is proper to access
vma->vm_prev.
