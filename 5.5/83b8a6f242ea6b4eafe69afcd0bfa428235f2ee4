drm/gem: Fix mmap fake offset handling for drm_gem_object_funcs.mmap

Commit c40069cb7bd6 ("drm: add mmap() to drm_gem_object_funcs")
introduced a GEM object mmap() hook which is expected to subtract the
fake offset from vm_pgoff. However, for mmap() on dmabufs, there is not
a fake offset.

To fix this, let's always call mmap() object callback with an offset of 0,
and leave it up to drm_gem_mmap_obj() to remove the fake offset.

TTM still needs the fake offset, so we have to add it back until that's
fixed.
