jbd2: Completely fill journal descriptor blocks

With 32-bit block numbers, we don't allocate the array for journal
buffer heads large enough for corresponding descriptor tags to fill the
descriptor block. Thus we end up writing out half-full descriptor blocks
to the journal unnecessarily growing the transaction. Fix the logic to
allocate the array large enough.
