arm64: dts: marvell: Prepare the introduction of CP115

CP110 and CP115 are almost the same in terms of features and have a
very limited set of differences. Let's create an armada-cp11x.dtsi
file which will be used to instantiate both CP110 and CP115
nodes.

The only changes between the two armada-cp11{0,x}.dtsi files are the
following naming in macros: s/CP110/CP11X/.
