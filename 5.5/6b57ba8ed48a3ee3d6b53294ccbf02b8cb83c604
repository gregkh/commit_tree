riscv: clean up the macro format in each header file

There are many different formats in each header now, such as
_ASM_XXX_H, __ASM_XXX_H, _ASM_RISCV_XXX_H, RISCV_XXX_H, etc., This patch
tries to unify the format by using _ASM_RISCV_XXX_H, because the most
header use it now. This patch also adds the conditional to the headers
if they lost it.
