dm table: do not allow request-based DM to stack on partitions

Partitioned request-based devices cannot be used as underlying devices
for request-based DM because no partition offsets are added to each
incoming request.  As such, until now, stacking on partitioned devices
would _always_ result in data corruption (e.g. wiping the partition
table, writing to other partitions, etc).  Fix this by disallowing
request-based stacking on partitions.

While at it, since all .request_fn support has been removed from block
core, remove legacy dm-table code that differentiated between blk-mq and
.request_fn request-based.
