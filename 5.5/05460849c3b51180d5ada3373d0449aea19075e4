arm64: errata: Hide CTR_EL0.DIC on systems affected by Neoverse-N1 #1542419

Cores affected by Neoverse-N1 #1542419 could execute a stale instruction
when a branch is updated to point to freshly generated instructions.

To workaround this issue we need user-space to issue unnecessary
icache maintenance that we can trap. Start by hiding CTR_EL0.DIC.
