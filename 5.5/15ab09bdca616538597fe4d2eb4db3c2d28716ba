bpf: Enforce 'return 0' in BTF-enabled raw_tp programs

The return value of raw_tp programs is ignored by __bpf_trace_run()
that calls them. The verifier also allows any value to be returned.
For BTF-enabled raw_tp lets enforce 'return 0', so that return value
can be used for something in the future.
