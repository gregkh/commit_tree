drm/i915/selftests: fix null pointer dereference on pointer data

In the case where data fails to be allocated the error exit path is
via label 'out' where data is dereferenced in a for-loop.  Fix this
by exiting via the label 'out_file' instead to avoid the null pointer
dereference.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference after null check")
