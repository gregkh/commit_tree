powerpc: Avoid clang warnings around setjmp and longjmp

Commit aea447141c7e ("powerpc: Disable -Wbuiltin-requires-header when
setjmp is used") disabled -Wbuiltin-requires-header because of a
warning about the setjmp and longjmp declarations.

r367387 in clang added another diagnostic around this, complaining
that there is no jmp_buf declaration.

  In file included from ../arch/powerpc/xmon/xmon.c:47:
  ../arch/powerpc/include/asm/setjmp.h:10:13: error: declaration of
  built-in function 'setjmp' requires the declaration of the 'jmp_buf'
  type, commonly provided in the header <setjmp.h>.
  [-Werror,-Wincomplete-setjmp-declaration]
  extern long setjmp(long *);
              ^
  ../arch/powerpc/include/asm/setjmp.h:11:13: error: declaration of
  built-in function 'longjmp' requires the declaration of the 'jmp_buf'
  type, commonly provided in the header <setjmp.h>.
  [-Werror,-Wincomplete-setjmp-declaration]
  extern void longjmp(long *, long);
              ^
  2 errors generated.

We are not using the standard library's longjmp/setjmp implementations
for obvious reasons; make this clear to clang by using -ffreestanding
on these files.
