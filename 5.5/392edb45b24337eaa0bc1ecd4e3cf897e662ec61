io_uring: don't dynamically allocate poll data

This essentially reverts commit e944475e6984. For high poll ops
workloads, like TAO, the dynamic allocation of the wait_queue
entry for IORING_OP_POLL_ADD adds considerable extra overhead.
Go back to embedding the wait_queue_entry, but keep the usage of
wait->private for the pointer stashing.
