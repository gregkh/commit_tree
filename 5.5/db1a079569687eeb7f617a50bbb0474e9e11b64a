drm/dp_mst: Handle SST-only branch device case

[Why]
While handling LINK_ADDRESS reply, current code expects a peer device
can handle sideband message once the peer device type is reported as
DP_PEER_DEVICE_MST_BRANCHING. However, when the connected device is
a SST branch case, it can't handle the sideband message(MST_CAP=0 in
DPCD 00021h).

Current code will try to send LINK_ADDRESS to SST branch device and end
up with message timeout and monitor can't display normally. As the
result of that, we should take SST branch device into account.

[How]
According to DP 1.4 spec, we can use Peer_Device_Type as
DP_PEER_DEVICE_MST_BRANCHING and Message_Capability_Status as 0 to
indicate peer device as a SST-only branch device.

Fix following:
- Add the function drm_dp_mst_is_dp_mst_end_device() to decide whether a
peer device connected to a DFP is mst end device. Which also indicates
if the peer device is capable of handling message or not.
- Take SST-only branch device case into account in
drm_dp_port_set_pdt() and add a new parameter 'new_mcs'. Take sst branch
device case as the same case as DP_PEER_DEVICE_DP_LEGACY_CONV and
DP_PEER_DEVICE_SST_SINK. All original handling logics remain.
- Take SST-only branch device case into account in
drm_dp_mst_port_add_connector().
- Fix some parts in drm_dp_mst_handle_link_address_port() to have SST
branch device case into consideration.
- Fix the arguments of drm_dp_port_set_pdt() in
drm_dp_mst_handle_conn_stat().
- Have SST branch device also report
connector_status_connected when the ddps is true
in drm_dp_mst_detect_port()
- Fix the arguments of drm_dp_port_set_pdt() in
drm_dp_delayed_destroy_port()
