x86/entry/32: Unwind the ESPFIX stack earlier on exception entry

Right now, we do some fancy parts of the exception entry path while SS
might have a nonzero base: we fill in regs->ss and regs->sp, and we
consider switching to the kernel stack. This results in regs->ss and
regs->sp referring to a non-flat stack and it may result in
overflowing the entry stack. The former issue means that we can try to
call iret_exc on a non-flat stack, which doesn't work.

Tested with selftests/x86/sigreturn_32.
