clk: renesas: mstp: Delete unnecessary kfree() in cpg_mstp_clocks_init()

A NULL pointer would be passed to a call of the function kfree()
directly after a call of the function kzalloc() failed at one place.
Remove this superfluous function call.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
