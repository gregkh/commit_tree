scsi: lpfc: Fix NVMe ABTS in response to receiving an ABTS

When the port, running as a nvme target, receives an ABTS, it submits
commands to the adapter to Abort i/o outstanding in the adapter. The Abort
command formatting routine left a command field set to zero, which
instructs the adapter to generate an ABTS on the wire as part of cleaning
up the I/O. This is common operation for an initiator, but not for a
target.

Fix the driver to check whether an ABTS had been received for the I/O, and
if so, change the Abort command formatting so that the ABTS generation is
disabled (IA=1). No need to ABTS it when the other side already has.

Also refactored the code such that there is a single routine being used for
nvme or nvmet ABORT requests, and IA is an argument.
