logic_pio: Build into a library

Object file logic_pio.o is always built.

Ideally the object file should only be built when required. This is
tricky, as that would be for archs which define PCI_IOBASE, but no common
config option exists for that.

For now, continue to always build but at least ensure the symbols are not
included in the vmlinux when not referenced.
