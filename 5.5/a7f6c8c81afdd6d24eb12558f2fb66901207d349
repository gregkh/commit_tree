perf list: Hide deprecated events by default

There are some deprecated events listed by perf list. But we can't
remove them from perf list with ease because some old scripts may use
them.

Deprecated events are old names of renamed events.  When an event gets
renamed the old name is kept around for some time and marked with
Deprecated. The newer Intel event lists in the tree already have these
headers.

So we need to keep them in the event list, but provide a new option to
show them. The new option is "--deprecated".

With this patch, the deprecated events are hidden by default but they
can be displayed when option "--deprecated" is enabled.
