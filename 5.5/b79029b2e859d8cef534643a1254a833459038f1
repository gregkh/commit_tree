drm/i915/gt: Make timeslice duration configurable

Execlists uses a scheduling quantum (a timeslice) to alternate execution
between ready-to-run contexts of equal priority. This ensures that all
users (though only if they of equal importance) have the opportunity to
run and prevents livelocks where contexts may have implicit ordering due
to userspace semaphores. However, not all workloads necessarily benefit
from timeslicing and in the extreme some sysadmin may want to disable or
reduce the timeslicing granularity.

The timeslicing mechanism can be compiled out^W^W disabled (but should
DCE!) with

	./scripts/config --set-val DRM_I915_TIMESLICE_DURATION 0
