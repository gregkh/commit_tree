net: phylink: rename mac_link_state() op to mac_pcs_get_state()

Rename the mac_link_state() method to mac_pcs_get_state() to make it
clear that it should be returning the MACs PCS current state, which
is used for inband negotiation rather than just reading back what the
MAC has been configured for. Update the documentation to explicitly
mention that this is for inband.

We drop the return value as well; most of phylink doesn't check the
return value and it is not clear what it should do on error - instead
arrange for state->link to be false.
