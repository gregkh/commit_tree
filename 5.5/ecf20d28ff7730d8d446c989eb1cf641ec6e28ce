media: dvb-frontends/tc90522: extend i2c algo to support some devices

This demod implements an i2c adapter for attached tuner
and relays i2c messages from users (dvb adapters / bridge chips).
Some of them, such as Friio dvb card using gl861,
require each pair of i2c messages for one read to be issued as
two separate transactions.
This patch adds a configuration option to enable this split.
