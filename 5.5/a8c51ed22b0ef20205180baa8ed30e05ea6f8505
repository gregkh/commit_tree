drm/i915/gt: Try to more gracefully quiesce the system before resets

If we are doing a normal GPU reset triggered after detecting a long
period of stalled work, we can take our time and allow the engines to
quiesce. Since we've stopped submission to the engine, and if we wait
long enough an innocent context should complete, leaving the engine idle.
So by waiting a short amount of time, we should prevent clobbering other
users when resetting a stuck context.
