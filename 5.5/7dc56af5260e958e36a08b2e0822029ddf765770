drm/i915/selftests: Verify the LRC register layout between init and HW

Before we submit the first context to HW, we need to construct a valid
image of the register state. This layout is defined by the HW and should
match the layout generated by HW when it saves the context image.
Asserting that this should be equivalent should help avoid any undefined
behaviour and verify that we haven't missed anything important!

Of course, having insisted that the initial register state within the
LRC should match that returned by HW, we need to ensure that it does.

v2: Drop the RELATIVE_MMIO flag from gen11, we ignore it for
constructing the lrc image.
