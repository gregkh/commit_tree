drm/amdgpu: move the call of ras recovery_init and bad page reserve to proper place

ras recovery_init should be called after ttm init,
bad page reserve should be put in front of gpu reset since i2c
may be unstable during gpu reset.
add cleanup for recovery_init and recovery_fini

v2: add more comment and print.
    remove cancel_work_sync in recovery_init.
