PCI/PM: Clear PCIe PME Status even for legacy power management

Previously, pci_pm_resume_noirq() cleared the PME Status bit in the Root
Status register only if the device had no driver or the driver did not
implement legacy power management.  It should clear PME Status regardless
of what sort of power management the driver supports, so do this before
checking for legacy power management.

This affects Root Ports and Root Complex Event Collectors, for which the
usual driver is the PCIe portdrv, which implements new power management, so
this change is just on principle, not to fix any actual defects.
