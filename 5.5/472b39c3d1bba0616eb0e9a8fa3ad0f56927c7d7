regulator: max8907: Fix the usage of uninitialized variable in max8907_regulator_probe()

Inside function max8907_regulator_probe(), variable val could
be uninitialized if regmap_read() fails. However, val is used
later in the if statement to decide the content written to
"pmic", which is potentially unsafe.
