drm/i915: Mark up "sentinel" requests

Sometimes we want to emit a terminator request, a request that flushes
the pipeline and allows no request to come after it. This can be used
for a "preempt-to-idle" to ensure that upon processing the
context-switch to that request, all other active contexts have been
flushed.
