xfs: refactor xfs_parseags()

Refactor xfs_parseags(), move the entire token case block to a separate
function in an attempt to highlight the code that actually changes in
converting to use the new mount api.

Also change the break in the switch to a return in the factored out
xfs_fc_parse_param() function.
