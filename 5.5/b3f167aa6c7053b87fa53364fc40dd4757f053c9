btrfs: move the failrec tree stuff into extent-io-tree.h

This needs to be cleaned up in the future, but for now it belongs to the
extent-io-tree stuff since it uses the internal tree search code.
Needed to export get_state_failrec and set_state_failrec as well since
we're not going to move the actual IO part of the failrec stuff out at
this point.
