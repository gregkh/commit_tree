tools/power/cpupower: Fix initializer override in hsw_ext_cstates

When building cpupower with clang, the following warning appears:

 utils/idle_monitor/hsw_ext_idle.c:42:16: warning: initializer overrides
 prior initialization of this subobject [-Winitializer-overrides]
                 .desc                   = N_("Processor Package C2"),

This appears to be a copy and paste or merge mistake because the name
and id fields both have PC9 in them, not PC2. Remove the second
assignment to fix the warning.
