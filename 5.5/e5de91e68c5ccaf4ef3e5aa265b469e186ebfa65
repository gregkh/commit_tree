Revert "drm/i915/tgl: Implement Wa_1406941453"

Our sanitychecks indicate that while this register is context
saved/restore, the HW does not preserve this bit within the register --
it likely doesn't exist, or one of those mythical bits that the
architects insist does something despite all appearances to the
contrary.

For reference, SAMPLER_MODE is already in i915_reg.h as
GEN10_SAMPLER_MODE and is being setup in icl_ctx_workarounds_init() as
opposed to the chosen location here of rcs_engine_wa_init).
