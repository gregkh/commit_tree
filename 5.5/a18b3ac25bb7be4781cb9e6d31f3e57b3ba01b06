mm/mempolicy.c: check range first in queue_pages_test_walk

Patch series "mm: Fix checking unmapped holes for mbind", v4.

This patchset fix checking unmapped holes for mbind().

First patch makes sure the vma been correctly tracked in .test_walk(),
so each time when .test_walk() is called, the neighborhood of two vma
is correct.

Current problem is that the !vma_migratable() check could cause return
immediately without update tracking to vma.

Second patch fix the inconsistent report of EFAULT when mbind() is
called for MPOL_DEFAULT and non MPOL_DEFAULT cases, so application do
not need to have workaround code to handle this special behavior.
Currently there are two problems, one is that the .test_walk() can not
know there is hole at tail side of range, because .test_walk() only
call for vma not for hole.  The other one is that mbind_range() checks
for hole at head side of range but do not consider the
MPOL_MF_DISCONTIG_OK flag as done in .test_walk().

This patch (of 2):

Checking unmapped hole and updating the previous vma must be handled
first, otherwise the unmapped hole could be calculated from a wrong
previous vma.

Several commits were relevant to this error:

 - commit 6f4576e3687b ("mempolicy: apply page table walker on
   queue_pages_range()")

   This commit was correct, the VM_PFNMAP check was after updating
   previous vma

 - commit 48684a65b4e3 ("mm: pagewalk: fix misbehavior of
   walk_page_range for vma(VM_PFNMAP)")

   This commit added VM_PFNMAP check before updating previous vma. Then,
   there were two VM_PFNMAP check did same thing twice.

 - commit acda0c334028 ("mm/mempolicy.c: get rid of duplicated check for
   vma(VM_PFNMAP) in queue_page s_range()")

   This commit tried to fix the duplicated VM_PFNMAP check, but it
   wrongly removed the one which was after updating vma.
