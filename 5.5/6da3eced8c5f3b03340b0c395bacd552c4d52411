powerpc/spinlocks: Include correct header for static key

Recently, the spinlock implementation grew a static key optimization,
but the jump_label.h header include was left out, leading to build
errors:

  linux/arch/powerpc/include/asm/spinlock.h:44:7: error: implicit declaration of function ‘static_branch_unlikely’
   44 |  if (!static_branch_unlikely(&shared_processor))

This commit adds the missing header.

mpe: The build break is only seen with CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL=n.
