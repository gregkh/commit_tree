selftests/x86/mov_ss_trap: Fix the SYSENTER test

For reasons that I haven't quite fully diagnosed, running
mov_ss_trap_32 on a 32-bit kernel results in an infinite loop in
userspace.  This appears to be because the hacky SYSENTER test
doesn't segfault as desired; instead it corrupts the program state
such that it infinite loops.

Fix it by explicitly clearing EBP before doing SYSENTER.  This will
give a more reliable segfault.
