net/mlx5e: Always print health reporter message to dmesg

In case a reporter exists, error message is logged only to the devlink
tracer. The devlink tracer is a visibility utility only, which user can
choose not to monitor.
After cited patch, 3rd party monitoring tools that tracks these error
message will no longer find them in dmesg, causing a regression.

With this patch, error messages are also logged into the dmesg.
