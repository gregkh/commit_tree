serial: sirf: make register info static

The sirfsoc_usp and sirfsoc_uart objects are not
used outside of the drivers/tty/serial/sirfsoc_uart.o
so make them static. Fixes following sparse warnings:

drivers/tty/serial/sirfsoc_uart.h:123:30: warning: symbol 'sirfsoc_usp' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/tty/serial/sirfsoc_uart.h:189:30: warning: symbol 'sirfsoc_uart' was not declared. Should it be static?
