media: ti-vpe: vpe: use r2y instead of y2r, copy-paste error

There appears to be a copy-paste error on the access of
csc_coeffs.y2r.r601.full.coeff, I believe csc_coeffs.2yr.r601.full.coeff
should be used instead. This is a moot point as the code is never
reached, but at least use the correct structure element.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Copy-paste error")

Fixes: 3ff3a712a9ea ("media: ti-vpe: vpe: don't rely on colorspace member for conversion")
