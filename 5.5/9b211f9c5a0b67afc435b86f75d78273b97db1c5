media: cec-funcs.h: add status_req checks

The CEC_MSG_GIVE_DECK_STATUS and CEC_MSG_GIVE_TUNER_DEVICE_STATUS commands
both have a status_req argument: ON, OFF, ONCE. If ON or ONCE, then the
follower will reply with a STATUS message. Either once or whenever the
status changes (status_req == ON).

If status_req == OFF, then it will stop sending continuous status updates,
but the follower will *not* send a STATUS message in that case.

This means that if status_req == OFF, then msg->reply should be 0 as well
since no reply is expected in that case.
