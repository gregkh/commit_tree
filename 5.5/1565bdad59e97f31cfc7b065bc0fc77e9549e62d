fscrypt: remove struct fscrypt_ctx

Now that ext4 and f2fs implement their own post-read workflow that
supports both fscrypt and fsverity, the fscrypt-only workflow based
around struct fscrypt_ctx is no longer used.  So remove the unused code.

This is based on a patch from Chandan Rajendra's "Consolidate FS read
I/O callbacks code" patchset, but rebased onto the latest kernel, folded
__fscrypt_decrypt_bio() into fscrypt_decrypt_bio(), cleaned up
fscrypt_initialize(), and updated the commit message.
