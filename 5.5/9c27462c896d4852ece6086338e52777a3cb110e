drm/i915/selftests: Check known register values within the context

Check the logical ring context by asserting that the registers hold
expected start during execution. (It's a bit chicken-and-egg for how
could we manage to execute our request if the registers were not being
updated. Still, it's nice to verify that the HW is working as expected.)
