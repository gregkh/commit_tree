net-af_xdp: Use correct number of channels from ethtool

Drivers use different fields to report the number of channels, so take
the maximum of all data channels (rx, tx, combined) when determining the
size of the xsk map. The current code used only 'combined' which was set
to 0 in some drivers e.g. mlx4.

Tested: compiled and run xdpsock -q 3 -r -S on mlx4
