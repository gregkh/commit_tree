tracing: Use seq_buf_hex_dump() to dump buffers

Without this, buffers can be printed with __print_array macro that has
no formatting options and can be hard to read. The other way is to
mimic formatting capability with multiple calls of trace event with one
call per row which gives performance impact and different timestamp in
each row.
