selftests/bpf: Add read-only map values propagation tests

Add tests checking that verifier does proper constant propagation for
read-only maps. If constant propagation didn't work, skipp_loop and
part_loop BPF programs would be rejected due to BPF verifier otherwise
not being able to prove they ever complete. With constant propagation,
though, they are succesfully validated as properly terminating loops.
