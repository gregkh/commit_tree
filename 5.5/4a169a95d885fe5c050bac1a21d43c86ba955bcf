genirq: Introduce irq_chip_get/set_parent_state calls

On certain QTI chipsets some GPIOs are direct-connect interrupts to the
GIC to be used as regular interrupt lines. When the GPIOs are not used
for interrupt generation the interrupt line is disabled. But disabling
the interrupt at GIC does not prevent the interrupt to be reported as
pending at GIC_ISPEND. Later, when drivers call enable_irq() on the
interrupt, an unwanted interrupt occurs.

Introduce get and set methods for irqchip's parent to clear it's pending
irq state. This then can be invoked by the GPIO interrupt controller on
the parents in it hierarchy to clear the interrupt before enabling the
interrupt.
