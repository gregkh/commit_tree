pinctrl: devicetree: Avoid taking direct reference to device name string

When populating the pinctrl mapping table entries for a device, the
'dev_name' field for each entry is initialised to point directly at the
string returned by 'dev_name()' for the device and subsequently used by
'create_pinctrl()' when looking up the mappings for the device being
probed.

This is unreliable in the presence of calls to 'dev_set_name()', which may
reallocate the device name string leaving the pinctrl mappings with a
dangling reference. This then leads to a use-after-free every time the
name is dereferenced by a device probe:

Follow the example of sysfs, and duplicate the device name string before
stashing it away in the pinctrl mapping entries.
