ARM: dts: tacoma: Hog LPC pinmux

Requesting pinmux configuration is done at driver probe time. The LPC IP
is composed of many sub-devices, each with their own driver, and no
driver exists for the entire IP block. Avoid having each sub-device
request the LPC pinmux by just hogging it in the pinctrl node.
