drivers/staging/exfat: Replace binary semaphores for mutexes

At a slight footprint cost (24 vs 32 bytes), mutexes are more optimal
than semaphores; it's also a nicer interface for mutual exclusion,
which is why they are encouraged over binary semaphores, when possible.

For both v_sem and z_sem, their semantics imply traditional lock
ownership; that is, the lock owner is the same for both lock/unlock
operations. Therefore it is safe to convert.
