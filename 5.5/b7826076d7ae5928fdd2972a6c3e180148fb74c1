net/mlx5e: E-switch, Fix Ingress ACL groups in switchdev mode for prio tag

In cited commit, when prio tag mode is enabled, FTE creation fails
due to missing group with valid match criteria.

Hence,
(a) create prio tag group metadata_prio_tag_grp when prio tag is
enabled with match criteria for vlan push FTE.
(b) Rename metadata_grp to metadata_allmatch_grp to reflect its purpose.

Also when priority tag is enabled, delete metadata settings after
deleting ingress rules, which are using it.

Tide up rest of the ingress config code for unnecessary labels.
