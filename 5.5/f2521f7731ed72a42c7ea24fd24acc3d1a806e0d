drm/i915: switch to drm_fb_helper_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers

No need for a home-grown version, the generic helper should work just
fine.  It also handles vgacon removal these days, see commit
1c74ca7a1a9a ("drm/fb-helper: call vga_remove_vgacon automatically."),
so that can be removed too.
