platform/mellanox: fix the mlx-bootctl sysfs

This is a follow-up commit for the sysfs attributes to change
from DRIVER_ATTR to DEVICE_ATTR according to some initial comments.
In such case, it's better to point the sysfs path to the device
itself instead of the driver. The ABI document is also updated.
