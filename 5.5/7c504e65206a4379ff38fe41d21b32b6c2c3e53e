io_uring: don't wait when under-submitting

There is no reliable way to submit and wait in a single syscall, as
io_submit_sqes() may under-consume sqes (in case of an early error).
Then it will wait for not-yet-submitted requests, deadlocking the user
in most cases.

Don't wait/poll if can't submit all sqes
