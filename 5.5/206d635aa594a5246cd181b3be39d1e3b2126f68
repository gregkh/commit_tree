perf trace: Make evlist__set_evsel_handler() affect just entries without a handler

Renaming it to evlist__set_default_evsel_handler(), to better reflect
what we want to do, which is to set a default handler for events we
still haven't set a custom handler, like the ones for "msr:write_msr",
etc that are coming soon.
