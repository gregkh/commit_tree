dm zoned: reduce overhead of backing device checks

Commit 75d66ffb48efb3 added backing device health checks and as a part
of these checks, check_events() block ops template call is invoked in
dm-zoned mapping path as well as in reclaim and flush path. Calling
check_events() with ATA or SCSI backing devices introduces a blocking
scsi_test_unit_ready() call being made in sd_check_events(). Even though
the overhead of calling scsi_test_unit_ready() is small for ATA zoned
devices, it is much larger for SCSI and it affects performance in a very
negative way.

Fix this performance regression by executing check_events() only in case
of any I/O errors. The function dmz_bdev_is_dying() is modified to call
only blk_queue_dying(), while calls to check_events() are made in a new
helper function, dmz_check_bdev().
