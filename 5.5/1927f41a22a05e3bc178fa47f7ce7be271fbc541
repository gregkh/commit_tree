net: genetlink: introduce dump info struct to be available during dumpit op

Currently the cb->data is taken by ops during non-parallel dumping.
Introduce a new structure genl_dumpit_info and store the ops there.
Distribute the info to both non-parallel and parallel dumping. Also add
a helper genl_dumpit_info() to easily get the info structure in the
dumpit callback from cb.
