ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Update quirk for Acer Switch 10 SW5-012 2-in-1

When the Acer Switch 10 SW5-012 quirk was added we did not have
jack-detection support yet; and the builtin microphone selection of
the original quirk is wrong too.

Fix the microphone-input quirk and add jack-detection info so that the
internal-microphone and headphone/set jack on the Switch 10 work properly.
