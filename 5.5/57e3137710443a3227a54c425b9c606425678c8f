spi: atmel: Improve and fix GPIO CS usage

In the previous implementation of this driver, the index of the GPIO
used as CS was linked to the offset of the CS register used to
configure the transfer.

With this new implementation the first CS register not used by
internal CS is associated to all the GPIO CS. It allows to not be
anymore limited to have only 4 CS managed, now it is possible to have
in the same time until 3 internal CS and no more limit for the CS
GPIO.
