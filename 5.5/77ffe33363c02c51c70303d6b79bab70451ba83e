hv_sock: use HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE for Hyper-V communication

Current code assumes PAGE_SIZE (the guest page size) is equal
to the page size used to communicate with Hyper-V (which is
always 4K). While this assumption is true on x86, it may not
be true for Hyper-V on other architectures. For example,
Linux on ARM64 may have PAGE_SIZE of 16K or 64K. A new symbol,
HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE, has been previously introduced to use when
the Hyper-V page size is intended instead of the guest page size.

Make this code work on non-x86 architectures by using the new
HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE symbol instead of PAGE_SIZE, where appropriate.
Also replace the now redundant PAGE_SIZE_4K with HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE.
The change has no effect on x86, but lays the groundwork to run
on ARM64 and others.
