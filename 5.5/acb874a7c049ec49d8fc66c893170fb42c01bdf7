ASoC: max98090: remove msleep in PLL unlocked workaround

It was observed Baytrail-based chromebooks could cause continuous PLL
unlocked when using playback stream and capture stream simultaneously.
Specifically, starting a capture stream after started a playback stream.
As a result, the audio data could corrupt or turn completely silent.

As the datasheet suggested, the maximum PLL lock time should be 7 msec.
The workaround resets the codec softly by toggling SHDN off and on if
PLL failed to lock for 10 msec.  Notably, there is no suggested hold
time for SHDN off.

On Baytrail-based chromebooks, it would easily happen continuous PLL
unlocked if there is a 10 msec delay between SHDN off and on.  Removes
the msleep().
