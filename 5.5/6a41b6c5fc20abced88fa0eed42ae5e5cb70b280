gpio: Add xgs-iproc driver

This driver supports the Chip Common A GPIO controller present on a
number of Broadcom switch ASICs with integrated SoCs. The controller is
similar to the pinctrl-nsp-gpio and pinctrl-iproc-gpio blocks but
different enough that a separate driver is required.

This has been ported from Broadcom's XLDK 5.0.3 retaining only the CCA
support (pinctrl-iproc-gpio covers CCB).
