soc: qcom: llcc: Move regmap config to local variable

This is now a global variable that we're modifying to fix the name.
That isn't terribly thread safe and it's not necessary to be a global so
let's just move this to a local variable instead. This saves space in
the symtab and actually reduces kernel image size because the regmap
config is large and we can replace the initialization of that structure
with a memset and a few member assignments.
