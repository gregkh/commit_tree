drm/amd/display: Isolate DSC module from driver dependencies

[Why]
Edid Utility wishes to include DSC module from driver instead
of doing it's own logic which will need to be updated every time
someone modifies the driver logic.

[How]
Modify some functions such that we dont need to pass the entire
DC structure as parameter.
-Remove DC inclusion from module.
-Filter out problematic types and inclusions
