block: Reduce the amount of memory used for tag sets

Instead of allocating an array of size nr_cpu_ids for set->tags, allocate
an array of size set->nr_hw_queues. This patch improves behavior that was
introduced by commit 868f2f0b7206 ("blk-mq: dynamic h/w context count").

Reallocating tag sets from inside __blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() is safe
because:
- All request queues that share the tag sets are frozen before the tag sets
  are reallocated.
- blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() holds q->q_usage_counter while active and
  hence is serialized against __blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues().
