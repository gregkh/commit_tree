net: ethernet: ti: build cpsw-common for switchdev

Without the common part of the driver, the new file fails to link:

drivers/net/ethernet/ti/cpsw_new.o: In function `cpsw_probe':
cpsw_new.c:(.text+0x312c): undefined reference to `ti_cm_get_macid'

Use the same Makefile hack as before, and build cpsw-common.o for
any driver that needs it.
