powerpc/xive: Discard ESB load value when interrupt is invalid

A load on an ESB page returning all 1's means that the underlying
device has invalidated the access to the PQ state of the interrupt
through mmio. It may happen, for example when querying a PHB interrupt
while the PHB is in an error state.

In that case, we should consider the interrupt to be invalid when
checking its state in the irq_get_irqchip_state() handler.
