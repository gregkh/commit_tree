arm64: dts: imx8mq-evk: Add remote control

Add remote control to i.MX8M EVK device tree.

The rc protocol must be selected by writing to:
/sys/devices/platform/ir-receiver/rc/rc0/protocols

On my tests, I used "nec" rc protocol:
echo nec > protocols

Tested using evetest:
evtest /dev/input/event0

Output log for each key pressed:
Event:
time 1568122608.267845, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event:
time 1568122610.503835, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 440
