perf evlist: Maintain evlist->all_cpus

Maintain a cpumap in the evlist that is the union of all the cpus of the
events.

This needs a cpumap merge operation, which is added together with tests.

v2:
Add tests for cpu map merge
Fix handling of duplicates
Rename _update to _merge
Factor out sorting.
Fix handling of NULL maps in merge

v3:
Add comments and empty lines to _merge

Committer testing:

  # perf test "Merge cpu map"
  52: Merge cpu map                                         : Ok
