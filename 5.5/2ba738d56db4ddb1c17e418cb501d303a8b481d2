clk: renesas: r8a7796: Add R8A77961 CPG/MSSR support

Add support for the R-Car M3-W+ (R8A77961) SoC to the Renesas Clock
Pulse Generator / Module Standby and Software Reset driver.

R-Car M3-W+ is very similar to R-Car M3-W (R8A77960), which allows for
both SoCs to share a driver.  R-Car M3-W+ lacks a few modules, so their
clocks must be nullified.
