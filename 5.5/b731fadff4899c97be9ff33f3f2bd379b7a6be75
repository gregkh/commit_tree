ARM: dts: e60k02: fix power button

The power button was only producing irqs, but no key events,
Forced power down with long key press works, so probably
only a short spike arrives at the SoC.
Further investigation shows that LDORTC2 is off after boot
of the vendor kernel. LDORTC2 is shared with a GPIO at the pmic
which probably transfers the button press to the SoC.
That regulator off at boot, so "regulator-boot-on" is definitively
wrong. So remove that.
