pinctrl: meson: Fix wrong shift value when get drive-strength

In meson_pinconf_get_drive_strength, variable bit is calculated by
meson_calc_reg_and_bit, this value is the offset from the first pin of a
certain bank to current pin, while Meson SoCs use two bits for each pin
to depict drive-strength. So a left shift by 1 should be done or node
pinconf-pins shows wrong message.
