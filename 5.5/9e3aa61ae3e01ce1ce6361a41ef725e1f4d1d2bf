io_uring: ensure we return -EINVAL on unknown opcode

If we submit an unknown opcode and have fd == -1, io_op_needs_file()
will return true as we default to needing a file. Then when we go and
assign the file, we find the 'fd' invalid and return -EBADF. We really
should be returning -EINVAL for that case, as we normally do for
unsupported opcodes.

Change io_op_needs_file() to have the following return values:

0   - does not need a file
1   - does need a file
< 0 - error value

and use this to pass back the right value for this invalid case.
