drm: Destroy the correct mutex name in drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_destroy

It looks like one of the topology manager mutexes may have been renamed
during a rebase, but the destruction function wasn't updated with the
new name:

   error: ‘struct drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr’ has no member named
   ‘delayed_destroy_lock’
