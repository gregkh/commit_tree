ftrace/x86: Tell objtool to ignore nondeterministic ftrace stack layout

Objtool complains about the new ftrace direct trampoline code:

  arch/x86/kernel/ftrace_64.o: warning: objtool: ftrace_regs_caller()+0x190: stack state mismatch: cfa1=7+16 cfa2=7+24

Typically, code has a deterministic stack layout, such that at a given
instruction address, the stack frame size is always the same.

That's not the case for the new ftrace_regs_caller() code after it
adjusts the stack for the direct case.  Just plead ignorance and assume
it's always the non-direct path.  Note this creates a tiny window for
ORC to get confused.
