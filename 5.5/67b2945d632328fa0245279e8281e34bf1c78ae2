usb: gadget: u_audio: Remove superfluous snd_dma_continuous_data()

The recent change (commit 08422d2c559d: "ALSA: memalloc: Allow NULL
device for SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_CONTINUOUS type") made the PCM preallocation
helper accepting NULL as the device pointer for the default usage.
Drop the snd_dma_continuous_data() usage that became superfluous from
the callers.
