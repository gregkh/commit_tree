cxgb4: parse and configure TC-MQPRIO offload

Add logic for validation and configuration of TC-MQPRIO Qdisc
offload. Also, add support to manage EOSW_TXQ, which have 1-to-1
mapping with EOTIDs, and expose them to network stack.

Move common skb validation in Tx path to a separate function and
add minimal Tx path for ETHOFLD. Update Tx queue selection to return
normal NIC Txq to send traffic pattern that can't go through ETHOFLD
Tx path.
