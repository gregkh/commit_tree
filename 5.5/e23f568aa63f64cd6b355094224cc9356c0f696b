kernfs: fix ino wrap-around detection

When the 32bit ino wraps around, kernfs increments the generation
number to distinguish reused ino instances.  The wrap-around detection
tests whether the allocated ino is lower than what the cursor but the
cursor is pointing to the next ino to allocate so the condition never
triggers.

Fix it by remembering the last ino and comparing against that.
