scripts/kallsyms: fix definitely-lost memory leak

build_initial_tok_table() overwrites unused sym_entry to shrink the
table size. Before the entry is overwritten, table[i].sym must be freed
since it is malloc'ed data.

This fixes the 'definitely lost' report from valgrind. I ran valgrind
against x86_64_defconfig of v5.4-rc8 kernel, and here is the summary:

[Before the fix]

  LEAK SUMMARY:
     definitely lost: 53,184 bytes in 2,874 blocks

[After the fix]

  LEAK SUMMARY:
     definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
