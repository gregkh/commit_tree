bpftool: Fix bpftool build by switching to bpf_object__open_file()

As part of libbpf in 5e61f2707029 ("libbpf: stop enforcing kern_version,
populate it for users") non-LIBBPF_API __bpf_object__open_xattr() API
was removed from libbpf.h header. This broke bpftool, which relied on
that function. This patch fixes the build by switching to newly added
bpf_object__open_file() which provides the same capabilities, but is
official and future-proof API.

v1->v2:
- fix prog_type shadowing (Stanislav).
