media: cedrus: Fix undefined shift with a SHIFT_AND_MASK_BITS macro

We need to shift and mask values at different occasions to fill up
cedrus registers. This was done using macros that don't explicitly
treat arguments as unsigned, leading to possibly undefined behavior.

Introduce the SHIFT_AND_MASK_BITS macro and use it where possible.
In cases where it doesn't apply as-is, explicitly cast to unsigned
instead.

This macro should be moved to include/linux/bits.h eventually.
