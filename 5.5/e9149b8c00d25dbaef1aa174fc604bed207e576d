ASoC: wm8904: fix regcache handling

The current code assumes that the power is turned off in
SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF. If there are no actual regulator the codec isn't
turned off and the registers are not reset to their default values but
the regcache is still marked as dirty. Thus a value might not be written
to the hardware if it is set to the default value. Do a software reset
before turning off the power to make sure the registers are always reset
to their default states.
