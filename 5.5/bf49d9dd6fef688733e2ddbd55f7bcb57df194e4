export,module: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to headers with no license

Commit b24413180f56 ("License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license
identifier to files with no license") took care of a lot of files
without any license information.

These headers were not processed by the tool perhaps because they
contain "GPL" in the code.

I do not see any license boilerplate in them, so they fall back to
GPL version 2 only, which is the project default.
