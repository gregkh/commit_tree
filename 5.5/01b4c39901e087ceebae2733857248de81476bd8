nohz: Add TICK_DEP_BIT_RCU

If a nohz_full CPU is looping in the kernel, the scheduling-clock tick
might nevertheless remain disabled.  In !PREEMPT kernels, this can
prevent RCU's attempts to enlist the aid of that CPU's executions of
cond_resched(), which can in turn result in an arbitrarily delayed grace
period and thus an OOM.  RCU therefore needs a way to enable a holdout
nohz_full CPU's scheduler-clock interrupt.

This commit therefore provides a new TICK_DEP_BIT_RCU value which RCU can
pass to tick_dep_set_cpu() and friends to force on the scheduler-clock
interrupt for a specified CPU or task.  In some cases, rcutorture needs
to turn on the scheduler-clock tick, so this commit also exports the
relevant symbols to GPL-licensed modules.
