net/fsl: treat fsl,erratum-a011043

When fsl,erratum-a011043 is set, adjust for erratum A011043:
MDIO reads to internal PCS registers may result in having
the MDIO_CFG[MDIO_RD_ER] bit set, even when there is no
error and read data (MDIO_DATA[MDIO_DATA]) is correct.
Software may get false read error when reading internal
PCS registers through MDIO. As a workaround, all internal
MDIO accesses should ignore the MDIO_CFG[MDIO_RD_ER] bit.
