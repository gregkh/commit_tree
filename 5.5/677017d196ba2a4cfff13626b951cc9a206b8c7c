f2fs: Fix deadlock in f2fs_gc() context during atomic files handling

The FS got stuck in the below stack when the storage is almost
full/dirty condition (when FG_GC is being done).

schedule_timeout
io_schedule_timeout
congestion_wait
f2fs_drop_inmem_pages_all
f2fs_gc
f2fs_balance_fs
__write_node_page
f2fs_fsync_node_pages
f2fs_do_sync_file
f2fs_ioctl

The root cause for this issue is there is a potential infinite loop
in f2fs_drop_inmem_pages_all() for the case where gc_failure is true
and when there an inode whose i_gc_failures[GC_FAILURE_ATOMIC] is
not set. Fix this by keeping track of the total atomic files
currently opened and using that to exit from this condition.
