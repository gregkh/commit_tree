net: sched: pie: enable timestamp based delay calculation

RFC 8033 suggests an alternative approach to calculate the queue
delay in PIE by using a timestamp on every enqueued packet. This
patch adds an implementation of that approach and sets it as the
default method to calculate queue delay. The previous method (based
on Little's law) to calculate queue delay is set as optional.
