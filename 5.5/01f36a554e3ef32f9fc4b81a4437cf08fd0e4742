samples/trace_printk: Wait for IRQ work to finish

trace_printk schedules work via irq_work_queue(), but doesn't
wait until it was processed. The kprobe_module.tc testcase does:

:;: "Load module again, which means the event1 should be recorded";:
modprobe trace-printk
grep "event1:" trace

so the grep which checks the trace file might run before the irq work
was processed. Fix this by adding a irq_work_sync().
