ACPICA: debugger: add field unit support for acpi_db_get_next_token

ACPICA commit d509afa88e9415f13a3283c38ce9ee034634ae24

Since field unit data output from the debugger are now surrounded by
braces '{', support has been added to acpi_db_get_next_token to recognize
strings beginning with this character as a ACPI_TYPE_FIELD_UNIT.
