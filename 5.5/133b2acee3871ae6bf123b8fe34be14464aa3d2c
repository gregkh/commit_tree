platform/x86: hp-wmi: Make buffer for HPWMI_FEATURE2_QUERY 128 bytes

At least on the HP Envy x360 15-cp0xxx model the WMI interface
for HPWMI_FEATURE2_QUERY requires an outsize of at least 128 bytes,
otherwise it fails with an error code 5 (HPWMI_RET_INVALID_PARAMETERS):

Dec 06 00:59:38 kernel: hp_wmi: query 0xd returned error 0x5

We do not care about the contents of the buffer, we just want to know
if the HPWMI_FEATURE2_QUERY command is supported.

This commits bumps the buffer size, fixing the error.
