apparmor: Initial implementation of raw policy blob compression

This adds an initial implementation of raw policy blob compression,
using deflate. Compression level can be controlled via a new sysctl,
"apparmor.rawdata_compression_level", which can be set to a value
between 0 (no compression) and 9 (highest compression).
