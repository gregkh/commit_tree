lpc_eth: kernel BUG on remove

We may have found a bug in the nxp/lpc_eth.c driver. The function
platform_set_drvdata() is called twice, the second time it is called,
in lpc_mii_init(), it overwrites the struct net_device which should be
at pdev->dev->driver_data with pldat->mii_bus. When trying to remove
the driver, in lpc_eth_drv_remove(), platform_get_drvdata() will
return the pldat->mii_bus pointer and try to use it as a struct
net_device pointer. This causes unregister_netdev to segfault and
generate a kernel BUG. Is this reproducible?
