btrfs: remove embedded block_group_cache::item

The members ::used and ::flags are now in the block group cache
structure, the last one is chunk_objectid, but that's set to a fixed
value and otherwise unused. The item is constructed from a local
variable before write, so we can remove the embedded one from block
group.
