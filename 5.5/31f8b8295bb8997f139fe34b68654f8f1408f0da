selftests, bpftool: Set EXIT trap after usage function

The trap on EXIT is used to clean up any temporary directory left by the
build attempts. It is not needed when the user simply calls the script
with its --help option, and may not be needed either if we add checks
(e.g. on the availability of bpftool files) before the build attempts.

Let's move this trap and related variables lower down in the code, so
that we don't accidentally change the value returned from the script
on early exits at pre-checks.
