staging: exfat: remove two unused functions

Fix sparse warnings:

drivers/staging/exfat/exfat_core.c:2045:4: warning: symbol 'calc_checksum_1byte' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/staging/exfat/exfat_core.c:2080:5: warning: symbol 'calc_checksum_4byte' was not declared. Should it be static?

The two functions has no caller in tree, so remove it.
