ASoC: soc-core: add snd_soc_del_component_unlocked()

It is easy to read code if it is cleanly using paired function/naming,
like start <-> stop, register <-> unregister, etc, etc.
But, current ALSA SoC code is very random, unbalance, not paired, etc.
It is easy to create bug at the such code, and is difficult to debug.

Now ALSA SoC has snd_soc_add_component(), but there is no paired
snd_soc_del_component(). Thus, snd_soc_unregister_component() is
calling cleanup function randomly. it is difficult to read.
This patch adds missing snd_soc_del_component_unlocked() and
balance up code.
