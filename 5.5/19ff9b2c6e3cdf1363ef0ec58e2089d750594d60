iwlwifi: scan: adapt the code to use api ver 11

FW scan api ver 11 adds support for some new features,
in this version the fw did also some cleanup in the api,
which causes the driver not to be able to use the
current scan req struct.

Therefore, in this patch the driver has new version for the scan command
code
