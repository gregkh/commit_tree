sched/uclamp: Fix overzealous type replacement

Some uclamp helpers had their return type changed from 'unsigned int' to
'enum uclamp_id' by commit

  0413d7f33e60 ("sched/uclamp: Always use 'enum uclamp_id' for clamp_id values")

but it happens that some do return a value in the [0, SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE]
range, which should really be unsigned int. The affected helpers are
uclamp_none(), uclamp_rq_max_value() and uclamp_eff_value(). Fix those up.

Note that this doesn't lead to any obj diff using a relatively recent
aarch64 compiler (8.3-2019.03). The current code of e.g. uclamp_eff_value()
properly returns an 11 bit value (bits_per(1024)) and doesn't seem to do
anything funny. I'm still marking this as fixing the above commit to be on
the safe side.
