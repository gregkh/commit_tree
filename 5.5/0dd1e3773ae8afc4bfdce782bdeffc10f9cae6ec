pipe: fix empty pipe check in pipe_write()

LTP pipeio_1 test is hanging with v5.5-rc2-385-gb8e382a185eb,
with read side observing empty pipe and sleeping and write
side running out of space and then sleeping as well. In this
scenario there are 5 writers and 1 reader.

Problem is that after pipe_write() reacquires pipe lock, it
re-checks for empty pipe with potentially stale 'head' and
doesn't wake up read side anymore. pipe->tail can advance
beyond 'head', because there are multiple writers.

Use pipe->head for empty pipe check after reacquiring lock
to observe current state.

Testing: With patch, LTP pipeio_1 ran successfully in loop for 1 hour.
         Without patch it hanged within a minute.
