dmaengine: dma-jz4780: Also break descriptor chains on JZ4725B

It turns out that the JZ4725B displays the same buggy behaviour as the
JZ4740 that was described in commit f4c255f1a747 ("dmaengine: dma-jz4780:
Break descriptor chains on JZ4740").

Work around it by using the same workaround previously used for the
JZ4740.

Fixes commit f4c255f1a747 ("dmaengine: dma-jz4780: Break descriptor
chains on JZ4740")
