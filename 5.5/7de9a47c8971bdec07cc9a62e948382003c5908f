ASoC: Intel: skl-hda-dsp-generic: use snd-hda-codec-hdmi

Add support for using snd-hda-codec-hdmi driver for HDMI/DP
instead of ASoC hdac-hdmi. This is aligned with how other
HDA codecs are already handled.

When snd-hda-codec-hdmi is used, the PCM device numbers are
parsed from card topology and passed to the codec driver.
This needs to be done at runtime as topology changes may
affect PCM device allocation.
