ALSA: pci: Drop superfluous snd_pcm_sgbuf_ops_page

snd_pcm_sgbuf_ops_page is no longer needed to be set explicitly to PCM
page ops since the recent change in the PCM core (*).  Leaving it NULL
should work as long as the preallocation has been done properly.

This patch drops the redundant lines.

                  default mmap handler
