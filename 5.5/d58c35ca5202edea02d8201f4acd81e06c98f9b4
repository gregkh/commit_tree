mlxsw: spectrum: Do not enforce same firmware version for multiple ASICs

In commit a72afb6879bb ("mlxsw: Enforce firmware version for
Spectrum-2") I added a required firmware version for Spectrum-2, but
missed the fact that mlxsw_sp2_init() is used by both Spectrum-2 and
Spectrum-3. This means that the same firmware version will be used for
both, which is wrong.

Fix this by creating a new init() callback for Spectrum-3.
