ARM: dts: imx6ull-colibri: reduce v_batt current in power off

Reduce the current drawn from VCC_BATT when the main power on the 3V3
pins to the module are switched off.

This switches off SoC internal pull resistors which are provided on the
module for TAMPER7 and TAMPER9 SoC pin and switches on a pull down
instead of a pullup for the USBC_DET module pin (TAMPER2).
