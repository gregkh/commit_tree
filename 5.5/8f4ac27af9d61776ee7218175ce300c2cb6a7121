media: v4l: Put camera sensor, lens and flash drivers under MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT

Instead of individually depending on MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT (or forgetting
it), put all camera sensor, lens and flash drivers under
MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT as a whole. The lens VCM devices didn't use to do
this, but make them depend on MEDIA_CAMERA_SUPPORT as well since there's
no use for these devices without that in practice.
