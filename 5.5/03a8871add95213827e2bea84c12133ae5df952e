KVM: nVMX: Expose load IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL VM-{Entry,Exit} control

The "load IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL" bit for VM-entry and VM-exit should
only be exposed to the guest if IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL is a valid MSR.
Create a new helper to allow pmu_refresh() to update the VM-Entry and
VM-Exit controls to ensure PMU values are initialized when performing
the is_valid_msr() check.
