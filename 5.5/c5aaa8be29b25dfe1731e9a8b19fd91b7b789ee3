iwlwifi: mvm: fix unaligned read of rx_pkt_status

This is present since the introduction of iwlmvm.
Example stack trace on MIPS:

[<ffffffffc0789328>] iwl_mvm_rx_rx_mpdu+0xa8/0xb88 [iwlmvm]
[<ffffffffc0632b40>] iwl_pcie_rx_handle+0x420/0xc48 [iwlwifi]

Tested with a Wireless AC 7265 for ~6 months, confirmed to fix the
problem. No other unaligned accesses are spotted yet.
