ipmi: kill off 'timespec' usage again

'struct timespec' is getting removed from the kernel. The usage in ipmi
was fixed before in commit 48862ea2ce86 ("ipmi: Update timespec usage
to timespec64"), but unfortunately it crept back in.

The busy looping code can better use ktime_t anyway, so use that
there to simplify the implementation.
