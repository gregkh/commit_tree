random: don't forget compat_ioctl on urandom

Recently, there's been some compat ioctl cleanup, in which large
hardcoded lists were replaced with compat_ptr_ioctl. One of these
changes involved removing the random.c hardcoded list entries and adding
a compat ioctl function pointer to the random.c fops. In the process,
urandom was forgotten about, so this commit fixes that oversight.
