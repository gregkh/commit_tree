riscv: add support for SECCOMP and SECCOMP_FILTER

This patch was extensively tested on Fedora/RISCV (applied by default on
top of 5.2-rc7 kernel for <2 months). The patch was also tested with 5.3-rc
on QEMU and SiFive Unleashed board.

libseccomp (userspace) was rebased:
https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp/pull/134

Fully passes libseccomp regression testing (simulation and live).

There is one failing kernel selftest: global.user_notification_signal

v1 -> v2:
  - return immediately if secure_computing(NULL) returns -1
  - fixed whitespace issues
  - add missing seccomp.h
  - remove patch #2 (solved now)
  - add riscv to seccomp kernel selftest
