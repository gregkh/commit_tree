dma-mapping: merge the generic remapping helpers into dma-direct

Integrate the generic dma remapping implementation into the main flow.
This prepares for architectures like xtensa that use an uncached
segment for pages in the kernel mapping, but can also remap highmem
from CMA.  To simplify that implementation we now always deduct the
page from the physical address via the DMA address instead of the
virtual address.
