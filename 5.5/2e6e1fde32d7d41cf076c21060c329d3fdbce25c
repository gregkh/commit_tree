io_uring: fix error handling in io_queue_link_head

In case of an error io_submit_sqe() drops a request and continues
without it, even if the request was a part of a link. Not only it
doesn't cancel links, but also may execute wrong sequence of actions.

Stop consuming sqes, and let the user handle errors.
