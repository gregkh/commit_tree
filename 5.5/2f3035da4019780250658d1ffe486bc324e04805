riscv: prefix IRQ_ macro names with an RV_ namespace

"IRQ_TIMER", used in the arch/riscv CSR header file, is a sufficiently
generic macro name that it's used by several source files across the
Linux code base.  Some of these other files ultimately include the
arch/riscv CSR include file, causing collisions.  Fix by prefixing the
RISC-V csr.h IRQ_ macro names with an RV_ prefix.
