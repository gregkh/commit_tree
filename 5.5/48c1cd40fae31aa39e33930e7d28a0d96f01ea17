crypto: hisilicon - merge sgl support to hisi_qm module

As HW SGL can be seen as a data format of QM's sqe, we merge sgl code into
qm module and rename it as hisi_qm, which reduces the number of module and
make the name less generic.

This patch also modify the interface of SGL:
 - Create/free hisi_acc_sgl_pool inside.
 - Let user to pass the SGE number in one SGL when creating sgl pool, which
   is better than a unified module parameter for sgl module before.
 - Modify zip driver according to sgl interface change.
