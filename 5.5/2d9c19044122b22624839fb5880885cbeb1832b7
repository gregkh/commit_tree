drm/i915/uc: define GuC and HuC binaries for TGL

GuC 35.2.0 and HuC 7.0.3 are the first production releases for TGL.
GuC 35.2 for Gen12 is interface-compatible with 33.0 on older Gens,
because the differences are related to additional blocks/commands in
the interface to support new Gen12 features. These parts of the
interface will be added when the relevant features are enabled.
