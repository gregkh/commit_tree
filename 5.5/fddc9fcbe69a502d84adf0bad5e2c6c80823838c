fpga: dfl: fme: add power management support

This patch adds support for power management private feature under
FPGA Management Engine (FME). This private feature driver registers
a hwmon for power (power1_input), thresholds information, e.g.
(power1_max / crit / max_alarm / crit_alarm) and also read-only sysfs
interfaces for other power management information. For configuration,
user could write threshold values via above power1_max / crit sysfs
interface under hwmon too.
