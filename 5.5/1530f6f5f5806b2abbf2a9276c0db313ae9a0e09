usb: missing parentheses in USE_NEW_SCHEME

According to bd0e6c9614b9 ("usb: hub: try old enumeration scheme first
for high speed devices") the kernel will try the old enumeration scheme
first for high speed devices.  This can happen when a high speed device
is plugged in.

But due to missing parentheses in the USE_NEW_SCHEME define, this logic
can get messed up and the incorrect result happens.
