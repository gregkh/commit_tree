i2c: pxa: migrate to new i2c_slave APIs

The i2c subsystem was enhanced circa 2015 to support operating as
an i2c-slave device.  Prior to that, the i2c-pxa driver supported
an i2c-slave but had its own APIs.  There are no existing in-kernel
drivers or platforms that utilize the i2c-pxa APIs.

Migrate the i2c-pxa driver to the general i2c-slave APIs so that
existing drivers, such as the i2c-slave-eeprom, can be used.

This has been tested with a Marvell EspressoBin, using i2c-pxa and
i2c-slave-eeprom, acting as a slave, and a RaspeberryPi 3, using the
at24 driver, acting as a master.
