x86/ptrace: Prevent truncation of bitmap size

The active() callback of the IO bitmap regset divides the IO bitmap size by
the word size (32/64 bit). As the I/O bitmap size is in bytes the active
check fails for bitmap sizes of 1-3 bytes on 32bit and 1-7 bytes on 64bit.

Use DIV_ROUND_UP() instead.
