tracing: Remove stray tab in TRACE_EVAL_MAP_FILE's help text

There was a stray tab in the help text of the aforementioned config
option which showed like this:

  The "print fmt" of the trace events will show the enum/sizeof names
  instead        of their values. This can cause problems for user space tools
  ...

in menuconfig. Remove it and end a sentence with a fullstop.

No functional changes.
