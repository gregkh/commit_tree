Revert "Input: cros_ec_keyb - add back missing mask for event_type"

This reverts commit 62c3801619e16b68a37ea899b76572145dfe41c9.

This patch is not needed anymore since we clear EC_MKBP_HAS_MORE_EVENTS
flag before calling the notifiers in patch
"9d9518f5b52a (platform: chrome: cros_ec: handle MKBP more events flag)"
