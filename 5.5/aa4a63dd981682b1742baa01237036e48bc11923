tpm: Revert "tpm_tis_core: Turn on the TPM before probing IRQ's"

There has been a bunch of reports (one from kernel bugzilla linked)
reporting that when this commit is applied it causes on some machines
boot freezes.

Unfortunately hardware where this commit causes a failure is not widely
available (only one I'm aware is Lenovo T490), which means we cannot
predict yet how long it will take to properly fix tpm_tis interrupt
probing.

Thus, the least worst short term action is to revert the code to the
state before this commit. In long term we need fix the tpm_tis probing
code to work on machines that Stefan's fix was supposed to fix.

Fixes: 21df4a8b6018 ("tpm_tis: reserve chip for duration of tpm_tis_core_init")
