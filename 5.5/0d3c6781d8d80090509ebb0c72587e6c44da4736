crypto: ccp - Change a message to reflect status instead of failure

If an AMD BIOS makes zero CCP queues available to the driver, the
device is unavailable and therefore can't be activated. When this
happens, report the status but don't report a (non-existent)
failure. The CCP will be unactivated.
