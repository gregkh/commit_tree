crypto: arm/poly1305 - incorporate OpenSSL/CRYPTOGAMS NEON implementation

This is a straight import of the OpenSSL/CRYPTOGAMS Poly1305 implementation
for NEON authored by Andy Polyakov, and contributed by him to the OpenSSL
project. The file 'poly1305-armv4.pl' is taken straight from this upstream
GitHub repository [0] at commit ec55a08dc0244ce570c4fc7cade330c60798952f,
and already contains all the changes required to build it as part of a
Linux kernel module.
