hrtimer: Remove the comment about not used HRTIMER_SOFTIRQ

The softirq `HRTIMER_SOFTIRQ' was not used since commit c6eb3f70d448
("hrtimer: Get rid of hrtimer softirq").

But it got used again, beginning with commit 5da70160462e ("hrtimer:
Implement support for softirq based hrtimers"), which did not remove the
comment. Remove it now.
