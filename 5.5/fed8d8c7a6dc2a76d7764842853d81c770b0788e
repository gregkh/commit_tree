spi: atmel: fix handling of cs_change set on non-last xfer

The driver does the wrong thing when cs_change is set on a non-last
xfer in a message.  When cs_change is set, the driver deactivates the
CS and leaves it off until a later xfer again has cs_change set whereas
it should be briefly toggling CS off and on again.

This patch brings the behaviour of the driver back in line with the
documentation and common sense.  The delay of 10 us is the same as is
used by the default spi_transfer_one_message() function in spi.c.
