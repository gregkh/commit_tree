scripts/bpf: Print an error when known types list needs updating

Don't generate a broken bpf_helper_defs.h header if the helper script needs
updating because it doesn't recognize a newly added type. Instead print an
error that explains why the build is failing, clean up the partially
generated header and stop.

v1->v2:
- Switched from temporary file to .DELETE_ON_ERROR.
