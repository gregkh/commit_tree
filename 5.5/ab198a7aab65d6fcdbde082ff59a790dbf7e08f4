drm/msm: Sanitize the modeset_is_locked checks in dpu

As Daniel mentions in his email [1], non-blocking commits don't hold the
modeset locks, so we can safely access state as long as these functions
are in the commit path. So remove the WARN_ON in dpu_kms_encoder_enable.

In dpu_crtc_get_intf_mode, things are a bit more complicated. So keep
the WARN_ON, but add a comment explaining the situation and hope someone
comes along and fixes the issue.
