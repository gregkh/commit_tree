x86: hv: Add function to allocate zeroed page for Hyper-V

Hyper-V assumes page size to be 4K. While this assumption holds true on
x86 architecture, it might not  be true for ARM64 architecture. Hence
define hyper-v specific function to allocate a zeroed page which can
have a different implementation on ARM64 architecture to handle the
conflict between hyper-v's assumed page size and actual guest page size.
