drm/i915: Only apply a rmw mmio update if the value changes

If we try to clear, or even set, a bit in the register that doesn't
change the register state; skip the write. There's a slight danger in
that the register acts as a latch-on-write, but I do not think we use a
rmw cycle with any such latch registers.
