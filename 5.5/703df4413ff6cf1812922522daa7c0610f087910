ASoC: fsl_asrc: Fix error with S24_3LE format bitstream in i.MX8

There is error "aplay: pcm_write:2023: write error: Input/output error"
on i.MX8QM/i.MX8QXP platform for S24_3LE format.

In i.MX8QM/i.MX8QXP, the DMA is EDMA, which don't support 24bit
sample, but we didn't add any constraint, that cause issues.

So we need to query the caps of dma, then update the hw parameters
according to the caps.
