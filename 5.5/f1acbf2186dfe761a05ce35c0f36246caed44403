brd: warn on un-aligned buffer

Queue dma alignment limit requires users(fs, target, ...) of block layer
to pass aligned buffer.

So far brd doesn't support un-aligned buffer, even though it is easy
to support it.

However, given brd is often used for debug purpose, and there are other
drivers which can't support un-aligned buffer too.

So add warning so that brd users know what to fix.
