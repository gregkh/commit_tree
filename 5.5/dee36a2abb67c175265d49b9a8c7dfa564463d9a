perf probe: Skip overlapped location on searching variables

Since debuginfo__find_probes() callback function can be called with  the
location which already passed, the callback function must filter out
such overlapped locations.

add_probe_trace_event() has already done it by commit 1a375ae7659a
("perf probe: Skip same probe address for a given line"), but
add_available_vars() doesn't. Thus perf probe -v shows same address
repeatedly as below:

  # perf probe -V vfs_read:18
  Available variables at vfs_read:18
          @<vfs_read+217>
                  char*   buf
                  loff_t* pos
                  ssize_t ret
                  struct file*    file
          @<vfs_read+217>
                  char*   buf
                  loff_t* pos
                  ssize_t ret
                  struct file*    file
          @<vfs_read+226>
                  char*   buf
                  loff_t* pos
                  ssize_t ret
                  struct file*    file

With this fix, perf probe -V shows it correctly:

  # perf probe -V vfs_read:18
  Available variables at vfs_read:18
          @<vfs_read+217>
                  char*   buf
                  loff_t* pos
                  ssize_t ret
                  struct file*    file
          @<vfs_read+226>
                  char*   buf
                  loff_t* pos
                  ssize_t ret
                  struct file*    file
