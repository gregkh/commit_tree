ASoC: fsl_asrc: Use in(out)put_format instead of in(out)put_word_width

snd_pcm_format_t is more formal than enum asrc_word_width, which has
two property, width and physical width, which is more accurate than
enum asrc_word_width. So it is better to use in(out)put_format
instead of in(out)put_word_width.
