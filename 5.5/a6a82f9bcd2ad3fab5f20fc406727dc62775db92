tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Turbo-freq feature auto mode

Introduce --auto|-a option to turbo-freq enable feature, so that it
does in one step for users who are OK by setting all passed target cores
as high priority and set in CLOS 0 and remaining in CLOS 3. In this way,
users don't have to take multiple steps to enable turbo-freq feature. For
users who want more fine grain control, they can always use core-power
feature to set custom CLOS configuration and assignment.

While here also print the error to output when clos configuration fails.

For example
intel-speed-select -c 0-4 turbo-freq enable --auto

The above command will enable turbo-freq and core-power feature. Also
mark CPU 0 to CPU 4 as high priority.
