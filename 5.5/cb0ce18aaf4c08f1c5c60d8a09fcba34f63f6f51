genetlink: do not parse attributes for families with zero maxattr

Commit c10e6cf85e7d ("net: genetlink: push attrbuf allocation and parsing
to a separate function") moved attribute buffer allocation and attribute
parsing from genl_family_rcv_msg_doit() into a separate function
genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_parse() which, unlike the previous code, calls
__nlmsg_parse() even if family->maxattr is 0 (i.e. the family does its own
parsing). The parser error is ignored and does not propagate out of
genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_parse() but an error message ("Unknown attribute
type") is set in extack and if further processing generates no error or
warning, it stays there and is interpreted as a warning by userspace.

Dumpit requests are not affected as genl_family_rcv_msg_dumpit() bypasses
the call of genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_parse() if family->maxattr is zero.
Move this logic inside genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_parse() so that we don't
have to handle it in each caller.

v3: put the check inside genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_parse()
v2: adjust also argument of genl_family_rcv_msg_attrs_free()
