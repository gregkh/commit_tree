pinctrl: intel: Avoid potential glitches if pin is in GPIO mode

When consumer requests a pin, in order to be on the safest side,
we switch it first to GPIO mode followed by immediate transition
to the input state. Due to posted writes it's luckily to be a single
I/O transaction.

However, if firmware or boot loader already configures the pin
to the GPIO mode, user expects no glitches for the requested pin.
We may check if the pin is pre-configured and leave it as is
till the actual consumer toggles its state to avoid glitches.
