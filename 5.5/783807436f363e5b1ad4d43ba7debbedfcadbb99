soc/tegra: regulators: Add regulators coupler for Tegra30

Add regulators coupler for Tegra30 SoCs that performs voltage balancing
of a coupled regulators and thus provides voltage scaling functionality.

There are 2 coupled regulators on all Tegra30 SoCs: CORE and CPU. The
coupled regulator voltages shall be in a range of 300mV from each other
and CORE voltage shall be higher than the CPU by N mV, where N depends
on the CPU voltage.
