drm/i915/gt: execlists->active is serialised by the tasklet

The active/pending execlists is no longer protected by the
engine->active.lock, but is serialised by the tasklet instead. Update
the locking around the debug and stats to follow suit.

v2: local_bh_disable() to prevent recursing into the tasklet in case we
trigger a softirq (Tvrtko)
