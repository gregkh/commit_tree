locking/rwsem: Fix kernel crash when spinning on RWSEM_OWNER_UNKNOWN

The commit 91d2a812dfb9 ("locking/rwsem: Make handoff writer
optimistically spin on owner") will allow a recently woken up waiting
writer to spin on the owner. Unfortunately, if the owner happens to be
RWSEM_OWNER_UNKNOWN, the code will incorrectly spin on it leading to a
kernel crash. This is fixed by passing the proper non-spinnable bits
to rwsem_spin_on_owner() so that RWSEM_OWNER_UNKNOWN will be treated
as a non-spinnable target.
