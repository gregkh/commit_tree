net: dsa: sja1105: Simplify reset handling

We don't really need 10k species of reset. Remove everything except cold
reset which is what is actually used. Too bad the hardware designers
couldn't agree to use the same bit field for rev 1 and rev 2, so the
(*reset_cmd) function pointer is there to stay.

However let's simplify the prototype and give it a struct dsa_switch (we
want to avoid forward-declarations of structures, in this case struct
sja1105_private, wherever we can).
