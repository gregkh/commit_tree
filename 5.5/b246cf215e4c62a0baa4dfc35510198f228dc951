drm/i915/dp: Program an Infoframe SDP Header and DB for HDR Static Metadata

Function intel_dp_setup_hdr_metadata_infoframe_sdp handles Infoframe SDP
header and data block setup for HDR Static Metadata. It enables writing of
HDR metadata infoframe SDP to panel. Support for HDR video was introduced
in DisplayPort 1.4. It implements the CTA-861-G standard for transport of
static HDR metadata. The HDR Metadata will be provided by userspace
compositors, based on blending policies and passed to the driver through
a blob property.

Because each of GEN11 and prior GEN11 have different register size for
HDR Metadata Infoframe SDP packet, it adds and uses different register
size.

Setup Infoframe SDP header and data block in function
intel_dp_setup_hdr_metadata_infoframe_sdp for HDR Static Metadata as per
dp 1.4 spec and CTA-861-F spec.
As per DP 1.4 spec, 2.2.2.5 SDP Formats. It enables Dynamic Range and
Mastering Infoframe for HDR content, which is defined in CTA-861-F spec.
According to DP 1.4 spec and CEA-861-F spec Table 5, in order to transmit
static HDR metadata, we have to use Non-audio INFOFRAME SDP v1.3.

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|      [ Packet Type Value ]     |       [ Packet Type ]         |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 80h + Non-audio INFOFRAME Type | CEA-861-F Non-audio INFOFRAME |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|      [Transmission Timing]                                     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| As per CEA-861-F for INFOFRAME, including CEA-861.3 within     |
| which Dynamic Range and Mastering INFOFRAME are defined        |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

v2: Add a missed blank line after function declaration.
v3: Remove not handled return values from
    intel_dp_setup_hdr_metadata_infoframe_sdp(). [Uma]
v9: Addressed review comments from Ville.
    - Add BUILD_BUG_ON to check a changing of struct dp_sdp size.
    - Change a passed size toward write_infoframe() for DP infoframe sdp
      packet for HDR static metadata.
