drm/i915/perf: Allow dynamic reconfiguration of the OA stream

Introduce a new perf_ioctl command to change the OA configuration of the
active stream. This allows the OA stream to be reconfigured between
batch buffers, giving greater flexibility in sampling. We inject a
request into the OA context to reconfigure the stream asynchronously on
the GPU in between and ordered with execbuffer calls.

Original patch for dynamic reconfiguration by Lionel Landwerlin.
