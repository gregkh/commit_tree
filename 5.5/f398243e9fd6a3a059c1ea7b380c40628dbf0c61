crypto: ecdh - fix big endian bug in ECC library

The elliptic curve arithmetic library used by the EC-DH KPP implementation
assumes big endian byte order, and unconditionally reverses the byte
and word order of multi-limb quantities. On big endian systems, the byte
reordering is not necessary, while the word ordering needs to be retained.

So replace the __swab64() invocation with a call to be64_to_cpu() which
should do the right thing for both little and big endian builds.
