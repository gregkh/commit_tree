xtensa: clean up system_call/xtensa_rt_sigreturn interaction

system_call assembly code always pushes pointer to struct pt_regs as the
last additional parameter for all system calls. The only user of this
feature is xtensa_rt_sigreturn.
Avoid this special case. Define xtensa_rt_sigreturn as accepting no
argiments. Use current_pt_regs to get pointer to struct pt_regs in
xtensa_rt_sigreturn. Don't pass additional parameter from system_call
code.
