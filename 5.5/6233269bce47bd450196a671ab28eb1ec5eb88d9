ARM: dts: rockchip: Use interpolated brightness tables for veyron

Use interpolated brightness tables (added by commit 573fe6d1c25
("backlight: pwm_bl: Linear interpolation between
brightness-levels") for veyron, instead of specifying every single
step. Some devices/panels have intervals that are smaller than
the specified 'num-interpolated-steps', the driver interprets
these intervals as a single step.

Another option would be to switch to a perceptual brightness curve
(CIE 1931), with the caveat that it would change the behavior of
the backlight. Also the concept of a minimum brightness level is
currently not supported for CIE 1931 curves.
