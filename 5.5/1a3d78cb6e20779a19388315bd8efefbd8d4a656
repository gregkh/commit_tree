ata: ahci_brcm: BCM7425 AHCI requires AHCI_HFLAG_DELAY_ENGINE

Set AHCI_HFLAG_DELAY_ENGINE for the BCM7425 AHCI controller thus making
it conforming to the 'strict' AHCI implementation which this controller
is based on.

This solves long link establishment with specific hard drives (e.g.:
Seagate ST1000VM002-9ZL1 SC12) that would otherwise have to complete the
error recovery handling before finally establishing a succesful SATA
link at the desired speed.

We re-order the hpriv->flags assignment to also remove the NONCQ quirk
since we can set the flag directly.
