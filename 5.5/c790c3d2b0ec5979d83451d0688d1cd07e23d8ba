selftests/powerpc: Add a test of spectre_v2 mitigations

This test uses the PMU to count branch prediction hits/misses for a
known loop, and compare the result to the reported spectre v2
mitigation.

This gives us a way of sanity checking that the reported mitigation is
actually in effect.

Sample output for some cases, eg:

  Power9:
    sysfs reports: 'Vulnerable'
     PM_BR_PRED_CCACHE: result        368 running/enabled 5792777124
    PM_BR_MPRED_CCACHE: result        319 running/enabled 5792775546
     PM_BR_PRED_PCACHE: result 2147483281 running/enabled 5792773128
    PM_BR_MPRED_PCACHE: result  213604201 running/enabled 5792771640
    Miss percent 9 %
    OK - Measured branch prediction rates match reported spectre v2 mitigation.

    sysfs reports: 'Mitigation: Indirect branch serialisation (kernel only)'
     PM_BR_PRED_CCACHE: result        895 running/enabled 5780320920
    PM_BR_MPRED_CCACHE: result        822 running/enabled 5780312414
     PM_BR_PRED_PCACHE: result 2147482754 running/enabled 5780308836
    PM_BR_MPRED_PCACHE: result  213639731 running/enabled 5780307912
    Miss percent 9 %
    OK - Measured branch prediction rates match reported spectre v2 mitigation.

    sysfs reports: 'Mitigation: Indirect branch cache disabled'
     PM_BR_PRED_CCACHE: result 2147483649 running/enabled 20540186160
    PM_BR_MPRED_CCACHE: result 2147483649 running/enabled 20540180056
     PM_BR_PRED_PCACHE: result          0 running/enabled 20540176090
    PM_BR_MPRED_PCACHE: result          0 running/enabled 20540174182
    Miss percent 100 %
    OK - Measured branch prediction rates match reported spectre v2 mitigation.

  Power8:
    sysfs reports: 'Vulnerable'
     PM_BR_PRED_CCACHE: result 2147483649 running/enabled 3505888142
    PM_BR_MPRED_CCACHE: result          9 running/enabled 3505882788
    Miss percent 0 %
    OK - Measured branch prediction rates match reported spectre v2 mitigation.

    sysfs reports: 'Mitigation: Indirect branch cache disabled'
     PM_BR_PRED_CCACHE: result 2147483649 running/enabled 16931421988
    PM_BR_MPRED_CCACHE: result 2147483649 running/enabled 16931416478
    Miss percent 100 %
    OK - Measured branch prediction rates match reported spectre v2 mitigation.
    success: spectre_v2
