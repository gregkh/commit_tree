Fixed updating of ethertype in function skb_mpls_pop

The skb_mpls_pop was not updating ethertype of an ethernet packet if the
packet was originally received from a non ARPHRD_ETHER device.

In the below OVS data path flow, since the device corresponding to port 7
is an l3 device (ARPHRD_NONE) the skb_mpls_pop function does not update
the ethertype of the packet even though the previous push_eth action had
added an ethernet header to the packet.

recirc_id(0),in_port(7),eth_type(0x8847),
mpls(label=12/0xfffff,tc=0/0,ttl=0/0x0,bos=1/1),
actions:push_eth(src=00:00:00:00:00:00,dst=00:00:00:00:00:00),
pop_mpls(eth_type=0x800),4
