CIFS: Do not miss cancelled OPEN responses

When an OPEN command is cancelled we mark a mid as
cancelled and let the demultiplex thread process it
by closing an open handle. The problem is there is
a race between a system call thread and the demultiplex
thread and there may be a situation when the mid has
been already processed before it is set as cancelled.

Fix this by processing cancelled requests when mids
are being destroyed which means that there is only
one thread referencing a particular mid. Also set
mids as cancelled unconditionally on their state.
