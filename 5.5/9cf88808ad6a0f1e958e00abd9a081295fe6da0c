net/mlx5e: Fix concurrency issues between config flow and XSK

After disabling resources necessary for XSK (the XDP program, channels,
XSK queues), use synchronize_rcu to wait until the XSK wakeup function
finishes, before freeing the resources.

Suspend XSK wakeups during switching channels. If the XDP program is
being removed, synchronize_rcu before closing the old channels to allow
XSK wakeup to complete.
