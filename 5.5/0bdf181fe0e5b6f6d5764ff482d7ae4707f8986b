perf diff: Don't use hack to skip column length calculation

Previously we use a nasty hack to skip the hists__calc_col_len for block
since this function is not very suitable for block column length
calculation.

This patch removes the hack code and add a check at the entry of
hists__calc_col_len to skip for block case.
