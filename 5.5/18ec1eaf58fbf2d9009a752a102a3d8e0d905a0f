x86/mm: Enable 5-level paging support by default

Support of boot-time switching between 4- and 5-level paging mode is
upstream since 4.17.

We run internal testing with 5-level paging support enabled for a while
and it doesn't not cause any functional or performance regression on
4-level paging hardware.

The only 5-level paging related regressions I saw were in early boot
code that runs independently from CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL.

The next major release of distributions expected to have
CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL=y.

Enable the option by default. It may help to catch obscure bugs early.
