drm/amd/display: Do not double-buffer DTO adjustments

[WHY]
When changing DPP global ref clock, DTO adjustments must take effect
immediately, or else underflow may occur.
It appears the original decision to double-buffer DTO adjustments was made to
prevent underflows that occur when raising DPP ref clock (which is not
double-buffered), but that same decision causes similar issues when
lowering DPP global ref clock. The better solution is to order the
adjustments according to whether clocks are being raised or lowered.
