PCI: Make ACS quirk implementations more uniform

The ACS quirks differ in needless ways, which makes them look more
different than they really are.

Reorder the ACS flags in order of definitions in the spec:

  PCI_ACS_SV   Source Validation
  PCI_ACS_TB   Translation Blocking
  PCI_ACS_RR   P2P Request Redirect
  PCI_ACS_CR   P2P Completion Redirect
  PCI_ACS_UF   Upstream Forwarding
  PCI_ACS_EC   P2P Egress Control
  PCI_ACS_DT   Direct Translated P2P

(PCIe r5.0, sec 7.7.8.2) and use similar code structure in all.  No
functional change intended.
