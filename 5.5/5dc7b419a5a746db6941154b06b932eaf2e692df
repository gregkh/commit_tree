powerpc/watchpoint: Support for 8xx in ptrace-hwbreak.c selftest

On the 8xx, signals are generated after executing the instruction. So
no need to manually single-step on 8xx. Also, 8xx __set_dabr()
currently ignores length and hardcodes the length to 8 bytes. So all
unaligned and 512 byte testcase will fail on 8xx. Ignore those
testcases on 8xx.
