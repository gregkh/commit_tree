ARM: 8915/1: zImage: atags_to_fdt: fix __be32 and __be64 types

There are some sparse warnings about type conversion in
the atags_to_fdt.c code, due to __be32 and __be64, so
fix the following:

- Change _be32 and __be64 where appropriate
- Change setprop() to take a 'void *'
- Change incorrect fdt32_to_cpu() on FDT_MAGIC

Fixes the following sparse warnings:
