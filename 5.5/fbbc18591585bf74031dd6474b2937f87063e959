clk: ti: divider: cleanup _register_divider and ti_clk_get_div_table

Cleanup couple of TI divider clock internal APIs. These currently pass
huge amount of parameters, which makes it difficult to track what is
going on. Abstract most of these under struct clk_omap_div which gets
passed over the APIs.
