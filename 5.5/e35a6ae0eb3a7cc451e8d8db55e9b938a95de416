pinctrl/msm: Setup GPIO chip in hierarchy

Some GPIOs are marked as wakeup capable and are routed to another
interrupt controller that is an always-domain and can detect interrupts
even when most of the SoC is powered off. The wakeup interrupt
controller wakes up the GIC and replays the interrupt at the GIC.

Setup the TLMM irqchip in hierarchy with the wakeup interrupt controller
and ensure the wakeup GPIOs are handled correctly.
