KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix regression on big endian hosts

VCPU_CR is the offset of arch.regs.ccr in kvm_vcpu.
arch/powerpc/include/asm/kvm_host.h defines arch.regs as a struct
pt_regs, and arch/powerpc/include/asm/ptrace.h defines the ccr field
of pt_regs as "unsigned long ccr".  Since unsigned long is 64 bits, a
64-bit load needs to be used to load it, unless an endianness specific
correction offset is added to access the desired subpart.  In this
case there is no reason to _not_ use a 64 bit load though.
