net: bpf: Don't leak time wait and request sockets

It's possible to leak time wait and request sockets via the following
BPF pseudo code:
Â 
  sk = bpf_skc_lookup_tcp(...)
  if (sk)
    bpf_sk_release(sk)

If sk->sk_state is TCP_NEW_SYN_RECV or TCP_TIME_WAIT the refcount taken
by bpf_skc_lookup_tcp is not undone by bpf_sk_release. This is because
sk_flags is re-used for other data in both kinds of sockets. The check

  !sock_flag(sk, SOCK_RCU_FREE)

therefore returns a bogus result. Check that sk_flags is valid by calling
sk_fullsock. Skip checking SOCK_RCU_FREE if we already know that sk is
not a full socket.

Fixes: edbf8c01de5a ("bpf: add skc_lookup_tcp helper")
Fixes: f7355a6c0497 ("bpf: Check sk_fullsock() before returning from bpf_sk_lookup()")
