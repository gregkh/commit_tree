mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: Revert "mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add erratum A-009204 support"

This reverts commit 5dd195522562542bc6ebe6e7bd47890d8b7ca93c.

First, the fix seems to be plain wrong, since the erratum suggests
waiting 5ms before setting setting SYSCTL[RSTD], but this msleep()
happens after the call of sdhci_reset() which is where that bit gets
set (if SDHCI_RESET_DATA is in mask).

Second, walking the whole device tree to figure out if some node has a
"fsl,p2020-esdhc" compatible string is hugely expensive - about 70 to
100 us on our mpc8309 board. Walking the device tree is done under a
raw_spin_lock, so this is obviously really bad on an -rt system, and a
waste of time on all.

In fact, since esdhc_reset() seems to get called around 100 times per
second, that mpc8309 now spends 0.8% of its time determining that
it is not a p2020. Whether those 100 calls/s are normal or due to some
other bug or misconfiguration, regularly hitting a 100 us
non-preemptible window is unacceptable.
