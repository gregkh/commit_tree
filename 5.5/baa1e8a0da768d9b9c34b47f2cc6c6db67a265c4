batman-adv: Axe 'aggr_list_lock'

'aggr_list.lock' can safely be used in place of another explicit spinlock
when access to 'aggr_list' has to be guarded.

This avoids to take 2 locks, knowing that the 2nd one is always successful.

Now that the 'aggr_list.lock' is handled explicitly, the lock-free
__sbk_something() variants should be used when dealing with 'aggr_list'.
