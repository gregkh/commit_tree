gpiolib: fix up emulated open drain outputs

gpiolib has a corner case with open drain outputs that are emulated.
When such outputs are outputting a logic 1, emulation will set the
hardware to input mode, which will cause gpiod_get_direction() to
report that it is in input mode. This is different from the behaviour
with a true open-drain output.

Unify the semantics here.
