drm/dp: Do not busy-loop during link training

Use microsecond sleeps for the clock recovery and channel equalization
delays during link training. The duration of these delays can be from
100 us up to 16 ms. It is rude to busy-loop for that amount of time.

While at it, also convert to standard coding style by putting the
opening braces in a function definition on a new line. Also switch to
using an unsigned int for the AUX read interval to match the data type
of the parameters to usleep_range().

v2: use correct multiplier for training delays (Philipp Zabel)
v3: clarify data type change in commit message
