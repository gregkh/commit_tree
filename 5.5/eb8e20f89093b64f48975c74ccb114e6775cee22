powerpc/pseries: Mark accumulate_stolen_time() as notrace

accumulate_stolen_time() is called prior to interrupt state being
reconciled, which can trip the warning in arch_local_irq_restore():

  WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1017 at arch/powerpc/kernel/irq.c:258 .arch_local_irq_restore+0x9c/0x130
  ...
  NIP .arch_local_irq_restore+0x9c/0x130

  Call Trace:

    .accumulate_stolen_time+0x1c/0xb0
    decrementer_common+0x124/0x160

For now just mark it as notrace. We may change the ordering to call it
after interrupt state has been reconciled, but that is a larger
change.
