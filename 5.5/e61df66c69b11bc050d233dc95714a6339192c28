io-wq: ensure free/busy list browsing see all items

We have two lists for workers in io-wq, a busy and a free list. For
certain operations we want to browse all workers, and we currently do
that by browsing the two separate lists. But since these lists are RCU
protected, we can potentially miss workers if they move between the two
lists while we're browsing them.

Add a third list, all_list, that simply holds all workers. A worker is
added to that list when it starts, and removed when it exits. This makes
the worker iteration cleaner, too.
