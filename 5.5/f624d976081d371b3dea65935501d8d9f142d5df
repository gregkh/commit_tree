btrfs: ctree: Reduce one indent level for btrfs_search_slot()

In btrfs_search_slot(), we something like:

	if (level != 0) {
		/* Do search inside tree nodes*/
	} else {
		/* Do search inside tree leaves */
		goto done;
	}

This caused extra indent for tree node search code.  Change it to
something like:

	if (level == 0) {
		/* Do search inside tree leaves */
		goto done'
	}
	/* Do search inside tree nodes */

So we have more space to maneuver our code, this is especially useful as
the tree nodes search code is more complex than the leaves search code.
