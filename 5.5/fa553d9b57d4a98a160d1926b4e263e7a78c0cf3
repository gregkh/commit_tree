bpf, testing: Add selftest to read/write sockaddr from user space

Tested on x86-64 and Ilya was also kind enough to give it a spin on
s390x, both passing with probe_user:OK there. The test is using the
newly added bpf_probe_read_user() to dump sockaddr from connect call
into .bss BPF map and overrides the user buffer via bpf_probe_write_user():

  # ./test_progs
  [...]
  #17 pkt_md_access:OK
  #18 probe_user:OK
  #19 prog_run_xattr:OK
  [...]
