locking/refcount: Remove unused refcount_*_checked() variants

The full-fat refcount implementation is exposed via a set of functions
suffixed with "_checked()", the idea being that code can choose to use
the more expensive, yet more secure implementation on a case-by-case
basis.

In reality, this hasn't happened, so with a grand total of zero users,
let's remove the checked variants for now by simply dropping the suffix
and predicating the out-of-line functions on CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL=y.
