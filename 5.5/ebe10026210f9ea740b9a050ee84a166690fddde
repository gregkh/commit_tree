io_uring: don't cancel all work on process exit

If we're sharing the ring across forks, then one process exiting means
that we cancel ALL work and prevent future work. This is overly
restrictive. As long as we cancel the work associated with the files
from the current task, it's safe to let others persist. Normal fd close
on exit will still wait (and cancel) pending work.
