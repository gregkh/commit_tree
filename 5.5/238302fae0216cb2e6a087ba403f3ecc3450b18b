net/mlx5: E-switch, Enable metadata on own vport

Currently on ECPF, metadata is enabled on the ECPF vport = 0xfffe
(manager vport).
Metadata when supported, must be enabled on own vport which is
used to pass metadata to vport of NIC Rx Flow Table.

Due to this error, traffic tagged by ingress ACL is not processed
correctly at NIC rx flow table level which is supposed to work
on metadata tag.

Hence, instead of working on eswitch manager vport, always working on
eswitch own vport regardless of PF or ECPF.

Given that mlx5_eswitch_query/modify_esw_vport_context() is used to
access other vport in legacy mode and own vport settings in switchdev mode,
extend low level API to explicitly specify other_vport.
