net: dsa: tag_8021q: clarify index limitation

Now that there's no restriction from the DSA core side regarding
the switch IDs and port numbers, only tag_8021q which is currently
reserving 3 bits for the switch ID and 4 bits for the port number, has
limitation for these values. Update their descriptions to reflect that.
