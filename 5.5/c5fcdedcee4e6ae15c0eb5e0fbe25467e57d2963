bcache: add idle_max_writeback_rate sysfs interface

For writeback mode, if there is no regular I/O request for a while,
the writeback rate will be set to the maximum value (1TB/s for now).
This is good for most of the storage workload, but there are still
people don't what the maximum writeback rate in I/O idle time.

This patch adds a sysfs interface file idle_max_writeback_rate to
permit people to disable maximum writeback rate. Then the minimum
writeback rate can be advised by writeback_rate_minimum in the
bcache device's sysfs interface.
