can: flexcan: add low power enter/exit acknowledgment helper

The MCR[LPMACK] read-only bit indicates that FlexCAN is in a lower-power
mode (Disabled mode, Doze mode, Stop mode).

The CPU can poll this bit to know when FlexCAN has actually entered low
power mode. The low power enter/exit acknowledgment helper will reduce
code duplication for disabled mode, doze mode and stop mode.
