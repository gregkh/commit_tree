cpuidle: Drop disabled field from struct cpuidle_state

After recent cpuidle updates the "disabled" field in struct
cpuidle_state is only used by two drivers (intel_idle and shmobile
cpuidle) for marking unusable idle states, but that may as well be
achieved with the help of a state flag, so define an "unusable" idle
state flag, CPUIDLE_FLAG_UNUSABLE, make the drivers in question use
it instead of the "disabled" field and make the core set
CPUIDLE_STATE_DISABLED_BY_DRIVER for the idle states with that flag
set.

After the above changes, the "disabled" field in struct cpuidle_state
is not used any more, so drop it.

No intentional functional impact.
