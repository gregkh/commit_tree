MIPS: bitops: ins start position is always an immediate

The start position for an ins instruction is always encoded as an
immediate, so allowing registers to be used by the inline asm makes no
sense. It should never happen anyway since a bit index should always be
small enough to be treated as an immediate, but remove the nonsensical
"r" for sanity.
