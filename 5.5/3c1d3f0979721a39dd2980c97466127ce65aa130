MIPS: futex: Emit Loongson3 sync workarounds within asm

Generate the sync instructions required to workaround Loongson3 LL/SC
errata within inline asm blocks, which feels a little safer than doing
it from C where strictly speaking the compiler would be well within its
rights to insert a memory access between the separate asm statements we
previously had, containing sync & ll instructions respectively.
