pipe: fix and clarify pipe read wakeup logic

This is the read side version of the previous commit: it simplifies the
logic to only wake up waiting writers when necessary, and makes sure to
use a synchronous wakeup.  This time not so much for GNU make jobserver
reasons (that pipe never fills up), but simply to get the writer going
quickly again.

A bit less verbose commentary this time, if only because I assume that
the write side commentary isn't going to be ignored if you touch this
code.
