Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Fix RTS handling during startup

The RPi 4 uses the hardware handshake lines for CYW43455, but the chip
doesn't react to HCI requests during DT probe. The reason is the inproper
handling of the RTS line during startup. According to the startup
signaling sequence in the CYW43455 datasheet, the hosts RTS line must
be driven after BT_REG_ON and BT_HOST_WAKE.
