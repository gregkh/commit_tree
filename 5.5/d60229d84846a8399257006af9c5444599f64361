ALSA: cs4236: fix error return comparison of an unsigned integer

The return from pnp_irq is an unsigned integer type resource_size_t
and hence the error check for a positive non-error code is always
going to be true.  A check for a non-failure return from pnp_irq
should in fact be for (resource_size_t)-1 rather than >= 0.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
