dm mpath: remove harmful bio-based optimization

Removes the branching for edge-case where no SCSI device handler
exists.  The __map_bio_fast() method was far too limited, by only
selecting a new pathgroup or path IFF there was a path failure, fix this
be eliminating it in favor of __map_bio().  __map_bio()'s extra SCSI
device handler specific MPATHF_PG_INIT_REQUIRED test is not in the fast
path anyway.

This change restores full path selector functionality for bio-based
configurations that don't haave a SCSI device handler.  But it should be
noted that the path selectors do have an impact on performance for
certain networks that are extremely fast (and don't require frequent
switching).
