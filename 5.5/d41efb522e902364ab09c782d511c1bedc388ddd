fs/namei.c: pull positivity check into follow_managed()

There are 4 callers; two proceed to check if result is positive and
fail with ENOENT if it isn't; one (in handle_lookup_down()) is
guaranteed to yield positive and one (in lookup_fast()) is _preceded_
by positivity check.

However, follow_managed() on a negative dentry is a (fairly cheap)
no-op on anything other than autofs.  And negative autofs dentries
are never hashed, so lookup_fast() is not going to run into one
of those.  Moreover, successful follow_managed() on a _positive_
dentry never yields a negative one (and we significantly rely upon
that in callers of lookup_fast()).

In other words, we can easily transpose the positivity check and
the call of follow_managed() in lookup_fast().  And that allows
to fold the positivity check *into* follow_managed(), simplifying
life for the code downstream of its calls.
