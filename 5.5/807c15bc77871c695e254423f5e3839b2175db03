soundwire: intel: don't filter out PDI0/1

PDI0/1 are reserved for Bulk and filtered out in the existing code.
That leads to endless confusions on whether the index is the raw or
corrected one. In addition we will need support for Bulk at some point
so it's just simpler to expose those PDIs and not use it for now than
try to be smart unless we have to remove the smarts.

This patch requires a topology change to use PDIs starting at offset 2
explicitly.

Note that there is a known discrepancy between hardware documentation
and what ALH stream works in practice, future fixes are likely.
