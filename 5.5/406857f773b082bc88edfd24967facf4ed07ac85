ACPI: EC: add support for hardware-reduced systems

As defined in the ACPI spec section 12.11, ACPI hardware-reduced
platforms define the EC SCI interrupt as a GpioInt in the _CRS object.

This replaces the previous way of using a GPE for this interrupt;
GPE blocks are not available on reduced hardware platforms.

Add support for handling this interrupt as an EC event source, and
avoid GPE usage on reduced hardware platforms.

This enables the use of several media keys (e.g. screen brightness
up/down) on Asus UX434DA.
