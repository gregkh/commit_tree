drm: Don't free jobs in wait_event_interruptible()

drm_sched_cleanup_jobs() attempts to free finished jobs, however because
it is called as the condition of wait_event_interruptible() it must not
sleep. Unfortunately some free callbacks (notably for Panfrost) do sleep.

Instead let's rename drm_sched_cleanup_jobs() to
drm_sched_get_cleanup_job() and simply return a job for processing if
there is one. The caller can then call the free_job() callback outside
the wait_event_interruptible() where sleeping is possible before
re-checking and returning to sleep if necessary.
