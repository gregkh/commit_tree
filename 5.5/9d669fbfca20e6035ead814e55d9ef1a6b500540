media: i2c: ov2659: Fix missing 720p register config

The initial registers sequence is only loaded at probe
time. Afterward only the resolution and format specific
register are modified. Care must be taken to make sure
registers modified by one resolution setting are reverted
back when another resolution is programmed.

This was not done properly for the 720p case.
