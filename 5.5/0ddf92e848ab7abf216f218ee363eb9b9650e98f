io_uring: provide fallback request for OOM situations

One thing that really sucks for userspace APIs is if the kernel passes
back -ENOMEM/-EAGAIN for resource shortages. The application really has
no idea of what to do in those cases. Should it try and reap
completions? Probably a good idea. Will it solve the issue? Who knows.

This patch adds a simple fallback mechanism if we fail to allocate
memory for a request. If we fail allocating memory from the slab for a
request, we punt to a pre-allocated request. There's just one of these
per io_ring_ctx, but the important part is if we ever return -EBUSY to
the application, the applications knows that it can wait for events and
make forward progress when events have completed. This is the important
part.
