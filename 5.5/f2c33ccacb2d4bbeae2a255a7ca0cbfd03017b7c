PCI/PM: Always return devices to D0 when thawing

pci_pm_thaw_noirq() is supposed to return the device to D0 and restore its
configuration registers, but previously it only did that for devices whose
drivers implemented the new power management ops.

Hibernation, e.g., via "echo disk > /sys/power/state", involves freezing
devices, creating a hibernation image, thawing devices, writing the image,
and powering off.  The fact that thawing did not return devices with legacy
power management to D0 caused errors, e.g., in this path:

  pci_pm_thaw_noirq
    if (pci_has_legacy_pm_support(pci_dev)) # true for Mellanox VF driver
      return pci_legacy_resume_early(dev)   # ... legacy PM skips the rest
    pci_set_power_state(pci_dev, PCI_D0)
    pci_restore_state(pci_dev)
  pci_pm_thaw
    if (pci_has_legacy_pm_support(pci_dev))
      pci_legacy_resume
	drv->resume
	  mlx4_resume
	    ...
	      pci_enable_msix_range
	        ...
		  if (dev->current_state != PCI_D0)  # <---
		    return -EINVAL;

which caused these warnings:

  mlx4_core a6d1:00:02.0: INTx is not supported in multi-function mode, aborting
  PM: dpm_run_callback(): pci_pm_thaw+0x0/0xd7 returns -95
  PM: Device a6d1:00:02.0 failed to thaw: error -95

Return devices to D0 and restore config registers for all devices, not just
those whose drivers support new power management.

[bhelgaas: also call pci_restore_state() before pci_legacy_resume_early(),
