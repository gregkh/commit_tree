net: phylink: fix failure to register on x86 systems

The kernel test robot reports a boot failure with qemu in 5.5-rc,
referencing commit 2203cbf2c8b5 ("net: sfp: move fwnode parsing into
sfp-bus layer"). This is caused by phylink_create() being passed a
NULL fwnode, causing fwnode_property_get_reference_args() to return
-EINVAL.

Don't attempt to attach to a SFP bus if we have no fwnode, which
avoids this issue.
