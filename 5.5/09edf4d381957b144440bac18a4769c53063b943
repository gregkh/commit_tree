ext4: introduce new callback for IOMAP_REPORT

As part of the ext4_iomap_begin() cleanups that precede this patch, we
also split up the IOMAP_REPORT branch into a completely separate
->iomap_begin() callback named ext4_iomap_begin_report(). Again, the
raionale for this change is to reduce the overall clutter within
ext4_iomap_begin().
