PM / devfreq: Set scaling_max_freq to max on OPP notifier error

The devfreq_notifier_call functions will update scaling_min_freq and
scaling_max_freq when the OPP table is updated.

If fetching the maximum frequency fails then scaling_max_freq remains
set to zero which is confusing. Set to ULONG_MAX instead so we don't
need special handling for this case in other places.
