iwlwifi: fix TLV fragment allocation loop

In the allocation loop, "pages" will never become zero (because of the
DIV_ROUND_UP), so if we can't allocate any size and pages becomes 1,
we will keep trying to allocate 1 page until it succeeds.  And in that
case, as coverity reported, block will never be NULL.
