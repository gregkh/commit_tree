leds: remove PAGE_SIZE limit of /sys/class/leds/<led>/trigger

Reading /sys/class/leds/<led>/trigger returns all available LED triggers.
However, the size of this file is limited to PAGE_SIZE because of the
limitation for sysfs attribute.

Enabling LED CPU trigger on systems with thousands of CPUs easily hits
PAGE_SIZE limit, and makes it impossible to see all available LED triggers
and which trigger is currently activated.

We work around it here by converting /sys/class/leds/<led>/trigger to
binary attribute, which is not limited by length. This is _not_ good
design, do not copy it.
