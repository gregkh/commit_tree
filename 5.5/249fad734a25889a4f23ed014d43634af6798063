powerpc/perf: Disable trace_imc pmu

When a root user or a user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege uses any
trace_imc performance monitoring unit events, to monitor application
or KVM threads, it may result in a checkstop (System crash).

The cause is frequent switching of the "trace/accumulation" mode of
the In-Memory Collection hardware (LDBAR).

This patch disables the trace_imc PMU unit entirely to avoid
triggering the checkstop. A future patch will reenable it at a later
stage once a workaround has been developed.
