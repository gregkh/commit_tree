xprtrdma: Add unique trace points for posting Local Invalidate WRs

When adding frwr_unmap_async way back when, I re-used the existing
trace_xprtrdma_post_send() trace point to record the return code
of ib_post_send.

Unfortunately there are some cases where re-using that trace point
causes a crash. Instead, construct a trace point specific to posting
Local Invalidate WRs that will always be safe to use in that context,
and will act as a trace log eye-catcher for Local Invalidation.
