io_uring: correct poll cancel and linked timeout expiration completion

Currently a poll request fills a completion entry of 0, even if it got
cancelled. This is odd, and it makes it harder to support with chains.
Ensure that it returns -ECANCELED in the completions events if it got
cancelled, and furthermore ensure that the linked timeout that triggered
it completes with -ETIME if we did indeed trigger the completions
through a timeout.
