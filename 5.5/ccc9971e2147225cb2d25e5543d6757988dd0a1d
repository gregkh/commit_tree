docs: rcu: convert some articles from html to ReST

There are 4 RCU articles that are written on html format.

The way they are, they can't be part of the Linux Kernel
documentation body nor share the styles and pdf output.

So, convert them to ReST format.

This way, make htmldocs and make pdfdocs will produce a
documentation output that will be like the original ones, but
will be part of the Linux Kernel documentation body.

Part of the conversion was done with the help of pandoc, but
the result had some broken things that had to be manually
fixed.

Following are manual changes Mauro made when doing the automatic conversion:
