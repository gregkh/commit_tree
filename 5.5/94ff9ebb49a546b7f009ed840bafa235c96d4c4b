libbpf: Fix compatibility for kernels without need_wakeup

When the need_wakeup flag was added to AF_XDP, the format of the
XDP_MMAP_OFFSETS getsockopt was extended. Code was added to the
kernel to take care of compatibility issues arrising from running
applications using any of the two formats. However, libbpf was
not extended to take care of the case when the application/libbpf
uses the new format but the kernel only supports the old
format. This patch adds support in libbpf for parsing the old
format, before the need_wakeup flag was added, and emulating a
set of static need_wakeup flags that will always work for the
application.

v2 -> v3:
* Incorporated code improvements suggested by Jonathan Lemon

v1 -> v2:
* Rebased to bpf-next
* Rewrote the code as the previous version made you blind
