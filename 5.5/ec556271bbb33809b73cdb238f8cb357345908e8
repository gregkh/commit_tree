powerpc: Rename "notes" PT_NOTE to "note"

The Program Header identifiers are internal to the linker scripts. In
preparation for moving the NOTES segment declaration into RO_DATA,
standardize the identifier for the PT_NOTE entry to "note" as used by
all other architectures that emit PT_NOTE.

Note that there was discussion about changing all architectures to use
"notes" instead, but I prefer to avoid that at this time. Changing only
powerpc is the smallest change to standardize the entire kernel. And
while this standardization does use singular "note" for a section that
has more than one note in it, this is just an internal identifier. It
matches the ELF "PT_NOTE", and is 4 characters (like "text", and "data")
for pretty alignment. The more exposed macro, "NOTES", use the more
sensible plural wording.
