ftrace: Rename ftrace_graph_stub to ftrace_stub_graph

The ftrace_graph_stub was created and points to ftrace_stub as a way to
assign the functon graph tracer function pointer to a stub function with a
different prototype than what ftrace_stub has and not trigger the C
verifier. The ftrace_graph_stub was created via the linker script
vmlinux.lds.h. Unfortunately, powerpc already uses the name
ftrace_graph_stub for its internal implementation of the function graph
tracer, and even though powerpc would still build, the change via the linker
script broke function tracer on powerpc from working.

By using the name ftrace_stub_graph, which does not exist anywhere else in
the kernel, this should not be a problem.
