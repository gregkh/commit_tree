staging: rtl8188eu: reduce indentation level in rtw_alloc_stainfo

Remove else-arm from if-else statement. Move the else code out of the
if-else and skip it by adding goto exit to the if block. The exit label
was directly after the else-arm, so there is no change in behaviour.
Reduces indentation level and clears a line over 80 characters
checkpatch warning.
