scsi: NCR5380: Add disconnect_mask module parameter

Add a module parameter to inhibit disconnect/reselect for individual
targets. This gains compatibility with Aztec PowerMonster SCSI/SATA
adapters with buggy firmware. (No fix is available from the vendor.)

Apparently these adapters pass-through the product/vendor of the attached
SATA device. Since they can't be identified from the response to an INQUIRY
command, a device blacklist flag won't work.
