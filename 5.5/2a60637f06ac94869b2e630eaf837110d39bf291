f2fs: fix to update dir's i_pino during cross_rename

As Eric reported:

RENAME_EXCHANGE support was just added to fsstress in xfstests:

	    fsstress: add EXCHANGE renameat2 support

This is causing xfstest generic/579 to fail due to fsck.f2fs reporting errors.
I'm not sure what the problem is, but it still happens even with all the
fs-verity stuff in the test commented out, so that the test just runs fsstress.

Here's the contents of 579.full:

_check_generic_filesystem: filesystem on /dev/vdc is inconsistent
*** fsck.f2fs output ***
[ASSERT] (__chk_dots_dentries:1378)  --> Bad inode number[0x24] for '..', parent parent ino is [0xd10]

The root cause is that we forgot to update directory's i_pino during
cross_rename, fix it.
