mod_devicetable: fix PHY module format

When a PHY is probed, if the top bit is set, we end up requesting a
module with the string "mdio:-10101110000000100101000101010001" -
the top bit is printed to a signed -1 value. This leads to the module
not being loaded.

Fix the module format string and the macro generating the values for
it to ensure that we only print unsigned types and the top bit is
always 0/1. We correctly end up with
"mdio:10101110000000100101000101010001".
