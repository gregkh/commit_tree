lp: fix sparc64 LPSETTIMEOUT ioctl

The layout of struct timeval is different on sparc64 from
anything else, and the patch I did long ago failed to take
this into account.

Change it now to handle sparc64 user space correctly again.

Quite likely nobody cares about parallel ports on sparc64,
but there is no reason not to fix it.
