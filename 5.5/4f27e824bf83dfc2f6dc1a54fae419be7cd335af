kdb: Remove special case logic from kdb_read()

kdb_read() contains special case logic to force it exit after reading
a single character. We can remove all the special case logic by directly
calling the function to read a single character instead. This also
allows us to tidy up the function prototype which, because it now matches
getchar(), we can also rename in order to make its role clearer.

This does involve some extra code to handle btaprompt properly but we
don't mind the new lines of code here because the old code had some
interesting problems (bad newline handling, treating unexpected
characters like <cr>).
