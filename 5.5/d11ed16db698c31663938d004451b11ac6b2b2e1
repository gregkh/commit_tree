scsi: lpfc: Update async event logging

This patch updates ACQE handling for:

 - an EEPROM failure error reported by the adapter.

 - ensures that all data for any ACQE, recognized or not, is logged.

 - Given that all data is now logged unconditionally, the default case
   (unrecognized) data can be reduced.
