coresight: etm4x: Add view comparator settings API to sysfs.

Currently it is not possible to view the current settings of a given
address comparator without knowing what type it is set to. For example, if
a comparator is set as an addr_start comparator, attempting to read
addr_stop for the same index will result in an error.

addr_cmp_view is added to allow the user to see the current settings of
the indexed address comparator without resorting to trial and error when
the set type is not known.
