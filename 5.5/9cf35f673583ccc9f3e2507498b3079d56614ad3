btrfs: simplify inode locking for RWF_NOWAIT

This is similar to 942491c9e6d6 ("xfs: fix AIM7 regression"). Apparently
our current rwsem code doesn't like doing the trylock, then lock for
real scheme. This causes extra contention on the lock and can be
measured eg. by AIM7 benchmark.  So change our read/write methods to
just do the trylock for the RWF_NOWAIT case.

Fixes: edf064e7c6fe ("btrfs: nowait aio support")
