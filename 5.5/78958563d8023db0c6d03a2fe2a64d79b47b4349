KVM: x86: Remove unneeded kvm_vcpu variable, guest_xcr0_loaded

The kvm_vcpu variable, guest_xcr0_loaded, is a waste of an 'int'
and a conditional branch.  VMX and SVM are the only users, and both
unconditionally pair kvm_load_guest_xcr0() with kvm_put_guest_xcr0()
making this check unnecessary. Without this variable, the predicates in
kvm_load_guest_xcr0 and kvm_put_guest_xcr0 should match.
