iio: tcs3414: fix iio_triggered_buffer_{pre,post}enable positions

The iio_triggered_buffer_{predisable,postenable} functions attach/detach
the poll functions.

For the predisable hook, the disable code should occur before detaching
the poll func, and for the postenable hook, the poll func should be
attached before the enable code.

The driver was slightly reworked. The preenable hook was moved to the
postenable, to add some symmetry to the postenable/predisable part.
