mmc: core: Drop check for mmc_card_is_removable() in mmc_rescan()

Upfront in mmc_rescan() we use the host->rescan_entered flag, to allow
scanning only once for non-removable cards. Therefore, it's also not
possible that we can have a corresponding card bus attached (host->bus_ops
is NULL), when we are scanning non-removable cards.

For this reason, let' drop the check for mmc_card_is_removable() as it's
redundant.
