drm/msm/dsi: Implement qcom, dsi-phy-regulator-ldo-mode for 28nm PHY

The DSI PHY regulator supports two regulator modes: LDO and DCDC.
This mode can be selected using the "qcom,dsi-phy-regulator-ldo-mode"
device tree property.

However, at the moment only the 20nm PHY driver actually implements
that option. Add a check in the 28nm PHY driver to program the
registers correctly for LDO mode.
