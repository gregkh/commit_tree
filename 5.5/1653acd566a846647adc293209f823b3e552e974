drm/amd/display: populate bios integrated info for renoir

[Why]
When video_memory_type bw_params->vram_type
is assigned, wedistinguish between Ddr4MemType and LpDdr4MemType.
Because of this we will never report that we are using
LpDdr4MemType and never re-purpose WM set D

[How]
populate bios integrated info for renoir by adding the
revision number for renoir and use that integrated info
table instead of of asic_id to get the vram type
