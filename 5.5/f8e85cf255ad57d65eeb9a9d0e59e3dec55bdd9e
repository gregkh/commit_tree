io_uring: add support for IORING_OP_CONNECT

This allows an application to call connect() in an async fashion. Like
other opcodes, we first try a non-blocking connect, then punt to async
context if we have to.

Note that we can still return -EINPROGRESS, and in that case the caller
should use IORING_OP_POLL_ADD to do an async wait for completion of the
connect request (just like for regular connect(2), except we can do it
async here too).
