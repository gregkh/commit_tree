dm raid: Remove unnecessary negation of a shift in raid10_format_to_md_layout

When building with Clang + -Wtautological-constant-compare:

 drivers/md/dm-raid.c:619:8: warning: converting the result of '<<' to a
 boolean always evaluates to true [-Wtautological-constant-compare]
                 r = !RAID10_OFFSET;
                      ^
 drivers/md/dm-raid.c:517:28: note: expanded from macro 'RAID10_OFFSET'
 #define RAID10_OFFSET                   (1 << 16) /* stripes with data
 copies area adjacent on devices */
                                           ^
 1 warning generated.

Negating a non-zero number will always make it zero, which is the
default value of r in this function so this statement is unnecessary;
remove it so that clang no longer warns.
