i2c: tegra: Properly disable runtime PM on driver's probe error

One of the recent Tegra I2C commits made a change that resumes runtime PM
during driver's probe, but it missed to put the RPM in a case of error.
Note that it's not correct to use pm_runtime_status_suspended because it
breaks RPM refcounting.
