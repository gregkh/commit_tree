xen/xenbus: reference count registered modules

To prevent a PV driver module being removed whilst attached to its other
end, and hence xenbus calling into potentially invalid text, take a
reference on the module before calling the probe() method (dropping it if
unsuccessful) and drop the reference after returning from the remove()
method.
