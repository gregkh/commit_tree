drm/i915/execlists: Tweak virtual unsubmission

Since commit e2144503bf3b ("drm/i915: Prevent bonded requests from
overtaking each other on preemption") we have restricted requests to run
on their chosen engine across preemption events. We can take this
restriction into account to know that we will want to resubmit those
requests onto the same physical engine, and so can shortcircuit the
virtual engine selection process and keep the request on the same
engine during unwind.
