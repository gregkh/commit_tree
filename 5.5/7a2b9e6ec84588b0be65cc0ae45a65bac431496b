mei: bus: prefix device names on bus with the bus name

Add parent device name to the name of devices on bus to avoid
device names collisions for same client UUID available
from different MEI heads. Namely this prevents sysfs collision under
/sys/bus/mei/device/

In the device part leave just UUID other parameters that are
required for device matching are not required here and are
just bloating the name.
