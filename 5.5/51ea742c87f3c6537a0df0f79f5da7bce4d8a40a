drm/qxl: stop using TTM to call driver internal functions

The ttm_mem_io_* functions were intended to be internal to TTM and
shouldn't have been used in a driver. They were exported in commit
afe6804c045fbd69a1b75c681107b5d6df9190de just for QXL.

Instead call the qxl_ttm_io_mem_reserve() function directly and
completely drop the free call since that is a dummy on QXL.
