perf/x86: Implement immediate enforcement of /sys/devices/cpu/rdpmc value of 0

When you successfully write 0 to /sys/devices/cpu/rdpmc, the RDPMC
instruction should be disabled unconditionally and immediately (after you
close the SYSFS file) by the documentation.

Instead, in the current implementation the PMU must be reloaded which
happens only eventually some time in the future. Only after that the RDPMC
instruction becomes disabled (on ring 3) on the respective core.

This change makes the treatment of the 0 value as blocking and as
unconditional as the current treatment of the 2 value, only the CR4.PCE
bit is naturally set to false instead of true.
