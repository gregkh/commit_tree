workqueue: more destroy_workqueue() fixes

destroy_workqueue() warnings still, at a lower frequency, trigger
spuriously.  The problem seems to be in-flight operations which
haven't reached put_pwq() yet.

* Make sanity check grab all the related locks so that it's
  synchronized against operations which puts pwq at the end.

* Always print out the offending pwq.
