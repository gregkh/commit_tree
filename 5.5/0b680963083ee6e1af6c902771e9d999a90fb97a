arm64: dts: ls1028a: Fix tmu unit address

The following build warning is seen with W=1:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1028a.dtsi:531.20-581.5: Warning (simple_bus_reg): /soc/tmu@1f00000: simple-bus unit address format error, expected "1f80000"

Fix it by adjusting the tmu unit address to match its reg entry.
