x86/fpu: Use XFEATURE_FP/SSE enum values instead of hardcoded numbers

When setting up sizes and offsets for legacy header entries the code uses
hardcoded 0/1 instead of the corresponding enum values XFEATURE_FP and
XFEATURE_SSE.

Replace the hardcoded numbers which enhances readability of the code and
also makes this code the first user of those enum values..
