spi: Add call to spi_slave_abort() function when spidev driver is released

This change is necessary for spidev devices (e.g. /dev/spidev3.0) working
in the slave mode (like NXP's dspi driver for Vybrid SoC).

When SPI HW works in this mode - the master is responsible for providing
CS and CLK signals. However, when some fault happens - like for example
distortion on SPI lines - the SPI Linux driver needs a chance to recover
from this abnormal situation and prepare itself for next (correct)
transmission.

This change doesn't pose any threat on drivers working in master mode as
spi_slave_abort() function checks if SPI slave mode is supported.
