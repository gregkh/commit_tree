ASoC: soc-core: remove unneeded snd_soc_tplg_component_remove()

snd_soc_tplg_component_remove() is pair of snd_soc_tplg_component_load(),
and it is topology related cleanup function.

The driver which called _load() needs to call _remove() by its responsibility.
Today, skl-pcm and topology are the user, and these are calling both
_load() and _remove().

soc-core doesn't need to call it.
This patch remove it.
