selftests/bpf: Add BPF_TYPE_MAP_ARRAY mmap() tests

Add selftests validating mmap()-ing BPF array maps: both single-element and
multi-element ones. Check that plain bpf_map_update_elem() and
bpf_map_lookup_elem() work correctly with memory-mapped array. Also convert
CO-RE relocation tests to use memory-mapped views of global data.
