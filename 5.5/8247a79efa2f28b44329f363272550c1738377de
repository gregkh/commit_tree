vti: do not confirm neighbor when do pmtu update

When do IPv6 tunnel PMTU update and calls __ip6_rt_update_pmtu() in the end,
we should not call dst_confirm_neigh() as there is no two-way communication.

Although vti and vti6 are immune to this problem because they are IFF_NOARP
interfaces, as Guillaume pointed. There is still no sense to confirm neighbour
here.

v5: Update commit description.
v4: No change.
v3: Do not remove dst_confirm_neigh, but add a new bool parameter in
    dst_ops.update_pmtu to control whether we should do neighbor confirm.
    Also split the big patch to small ones for each area.
v2: Remove dst_confirm_neigh in __ip6_rt_update_pmtu.
