Move the static keyword to the front of declarations
of msm_dsi_v2_host_ops, msm_dsi_6g_host_ops and
msm_dsi_6g_v2_host_ops, and resolve the following
compiler warnings that can be seen when building
with warnings enabled (W=1):

drivers/gpu/drm/msm/dsi/dsi_cfg.c:150:1: warning:
  ‘static’ is not at beginning of declaration [-Wold-style-declaration]

drivers/gpu/drm/msm/dsi/dsi_cfg.c:161:1: warning:
  ‘static’ is not at beginning of declaration [-Wold-style-declaration]
