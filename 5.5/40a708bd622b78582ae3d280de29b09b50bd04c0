afs: Fix use-after-loss-of-ref

afs_lookup() has a tracepoint to indicate the outcome of
d_splice_alias(), passing it the inode to retrieve the fid from.
However, the function gave up its ref on that inode when it called
d_splice_alias(), which may have failed and dropped the inode.

Fix this by caching the fid.
