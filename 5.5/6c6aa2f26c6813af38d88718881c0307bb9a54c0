nvme: hwmon: add quirk to avoid changing temperature threshold

This adds a new quirk NVME_QUIRK_NO_TEMP_THRESH_CHANGE to avoid changing
the value of the temperature threshold feature for specific devices that
show undesirable behavior.

Guenter reported:

"On my Intel NVME drive (SSDPEKKW512G7), writing any minimum limit on the
Composite temperature sensor results in a temperature warning, and that
warning is sticky until I reset the controller.

It doesn't seem to matter which temperature I write; writing -273000 has
the same result."

The Intel NVMe has the latest firmware version installed, so this isn't
a problem that was ever fixed.
