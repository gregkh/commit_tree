of/platform: Unconditionally pause/resume sync state during kernel init

Commit 5e6669387e22 ("of/platform: Pause/resume sync state during init
and of_platform_populate()") paused/resumed sync state during init only
if Linux had parsed and populated a devicetree.

However, the check for that (of_have_populated_dt()) can change after
of_platform_default_populate_init() executes.  One example of this is
when devicetree unittests are enabled.  This causes an unmatched
pause/resume of sync state. To avoid this, just unconditionally
pause/resume sync state during init.
