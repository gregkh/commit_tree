libbpf: Use pr_warn() when printing netlink errors

The netlink functions were using fprintf(stderr, ) directly to print out
error messages, instead of going through the usual logging macros. This
makes it impossible for the calling application to silence or redirect
those error messages. Fix this by switching to pr_warn() in nlattr.c and
netlink.c.
