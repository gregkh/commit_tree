ALSA: rme: Avoid non-standard macro usage

Pass the device pointer from the PCI pointer directly, instead of a
non-standard macro.  The macro didn't give any better readability.

Along with it, drop the unnecessary assignment before the
snd_dma_alloc_pages() call and simplify by returning the error code
directly.
