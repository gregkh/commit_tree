dm thin: wakeup worker only when deferred bios exist

Single thread fio test (read, bs=4k, ioengine=libaio, iodepth=128,
numjobs=1) over dm-thin device has poor performance versus bare nvme
device.

Further investigation with perf indicates that queue_work_on() consumes
over 20% CPU time when doing IO over dm-thin device. The call stack is
as follows.

- 40.57% thin_map
    + 22.07% queue_work_on
    + 9.95% dm_thin_find_block
    + 2.80% cell_defer_no_holder
      1.91% inc_all_io_entry.isra.33.part.34
    + 1.78% bio_detain.isra.35

In cell_defer_no_holder(), wakeup_worker() is always called, no matter
whether the tc->deferred_bio_list list is empty or not. In single thread
IO model, this list is most likely empty. So skip waking up worker thread
if tc->deferred_bio_list list is empty.

Single thread IO performance improves from 448 MiB/s to 646 MiB/s (+44%)
once the needless wake_worker() calls are properly skipped.
