powerpc: permanently include 8xx registers in reg.h

Most 8xx registers have specific names, so just include
reg_8xx.h all the time in reg.h in order to have them defined
even when CONFIG_PPC_8xx is not selected. This will avoid
the need for #ifdefs in C code.

Guard SPRN_ICTRL in an #ifdef CONFIG_PPC_8xx as this register
has same name but different meaning and different spr number as
another register in the mpc7450.
