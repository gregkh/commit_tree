selftests: Move kselftest_module.sh into kselftest/

The kselftest_module.sh file was not being installed by the Makefile
"install" target, rendering the lib/*.sh tests nonfunction. This fixes
that and takes the opportunity to move it into the kselftest/ subdirectory
which is where the kselftest infrastructure bits are collecting.
