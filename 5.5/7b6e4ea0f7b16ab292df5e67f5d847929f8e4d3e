habanalabs: type specific MMU cache invalidation

Add the ability to invalidate the necessary MMU cache only.
This ability is a prerequisite for future ASICs support.
Note that in Goya ASIC, a single cache is used for both host/DRAM
mappings and hence this patch should not have any effect on current
behavior.
