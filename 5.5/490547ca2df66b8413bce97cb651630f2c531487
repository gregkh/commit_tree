block: don't send uevent for empty disk when not invalidating

Commit 6917d0689993 ("block: merge invalidate_partitions into
rescan_partitions") caused a regression where systemd-udevd spins
forever using max CPU starting at boot time.

It's caused by a behavior change where a KOBJ_CHANGE uevent is now sent
in a case where previously it wasn't.

Restore the old behavior.
