afs: Fix characters allowed into cell names

The afs filesystem needs to prohibit certain characters from cell names,
such as '/', as these are used to form filenames in procfs, leading to
the following warning being generated:

	WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3489 at fs/proc/generic.c:178

Fix afs_alloc_cell() to disallow nonprintable characters, '/', '@' and
names that begin with a dot.

Remove the check for "@cell" as that is then redundant.

This can be tested by running:

	echo add foo/.bar 1.2.3.4 >/proc/fs/afs/cells

Note that we will also need to deal with:

 - Names ending in ".invalid" shouldn't be passed to the DNS.

 - Names that contain non-valid domainname chars shouldn't be passed to
   the DNS.

 - DNS replies that say "your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.<gTLD>" and
   replies containing A records that say 127.0.53.53 should be
   considered invalid.

but these need to be dealt with by the kafs-client DNS program rather
than the kernel.
