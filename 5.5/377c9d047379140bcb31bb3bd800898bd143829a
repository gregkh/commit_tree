drm/amd/display: Reprogram FMT on pipe change

[Why]
When planes are added or removed from a stream, the change
in pipe usage from dynamic MPC combine can cause a second
stream using ODM combine to pick a different pipe to combine with.

In this scenario, a different OPP is connected to the ODM without
programming its FMT.

[How]
Reprogram the FMT in dcn20_program_pipe whenever a pipe is
newly enabled, or when its opp changes.
