mmc: mmci: add hardware busy timeout feature

In the stm32_sdmmc variant, the datatimer is active not only during
data transfers with the DPSM, but also while waiting for the busyend
IRQs from commands having the MMC_RSP_BUSY flag set. This leads to an
incorrect IRQ being raised to signal MCI_DATATIMEOUT error, which
simply breaks the behaviour.

Address this by updating the datatimer value before sending a command
having the MMC_RSP_BUSY flag set. To inform the mmc core about the
maximum supported busy timeout, which also depends on the current
clock rate, set ->max_busy_timeout (in ms).
