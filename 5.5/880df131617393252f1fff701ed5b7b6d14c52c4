kernfs: kernfs_find_and_get_node_by_ino() should only look up activated nodes

kernfs node can be created in two separate steps - allocation and
activation.  This is used to make kernfs nodes visible only after the
internal states attached to the node are fully initialized.
kernfs_find_and_get_node_by_id() currently allows lookups of nodes
which aren't activated yet and thus can expose nodes are which are
still being prepped by kernfs users.

Fix it by disallowing lookups of nodes which aren't activated yet.
