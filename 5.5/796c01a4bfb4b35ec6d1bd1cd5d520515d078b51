perf evsel: Always preserve errno while cleaning up perf_event_open failures

In some cases when perf_event_open fails, it may do some closes to clean
up. In special cases these closes can fail too, which overwrites the
errno of the perf_event_open, which is then incorrectly reported.

Save/restore errno around closes.
