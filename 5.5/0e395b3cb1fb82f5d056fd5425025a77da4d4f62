cxgb4: add FLOWC based QoS offload

Rework SCHED API to allow offloading TC-MQPRIO QoS configuration.
The existing QUEUE based rate limiting throttles all queues sharing
a traffic class, to the specified max rate limit value. So, if
multiple queues share a traffic class, then all the queues get
the aggregate specified max rate limit.

So, introduce the new FLOWC based rate limiting, where multiple
queues can share a traffic class with each queue getting its own
individual specified max rate limit.

For example, if 2 queues are bound to class 0, which is rate limited
to 1 Gbps, then 2 queues using QUEUE based rate limiting, get the
aggregate output of 1 Gbps only. In FLOWC based rate limiting, each
queue gets its own output of max 1 Gbps each; i.e. 2 queues * 1 Gbps
rate limit = 2 Gbps.
