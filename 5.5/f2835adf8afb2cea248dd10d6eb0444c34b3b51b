dmaengine: fsl-dpaa2-qdma: Add the DPDMAI(Data Path DMA Interface) support

The MC(Management Complex) exports the DPDMAI(Data Path DMA Interface)
object as an interface to operate the DPAA2(Data Path Acceleration
Architecture 2) qDMA Engine. The DPDMAI enables sending frame-based
requests to qDMA and receiving back confirmation response on transaction
completion, utilizing the DPAA2 QBMan(Queue Manager and Buffer Manager
hardware) infrastructure. DPDMAI object provides up to two priorities for
processing qDMA requests.
The following list summarizes the DPDMAI main features and capabilities:
	1. Supports up to two scheduling priorities for processing
	service requests.
	- Each DPDMAI transmit queue is mapped to one of two service
	priorities, allowing further prioritization in hardware between
	requests from different DPDMAI objects.
	2. Supports up to two receive queues for incoming transaction
	completion confirmations.
	- Each DPDMAI receive queue is mapped to one of two receive
	priorities, allowing further prioritization between other
	interfaces when associating the DPDMAI receive queues to DPIO
	or DPCON(Data Path Concentrator) objects.
	3. Supports different scheduling options for processing received
	packets:
	- Queues can be configured either in 'parked' mode (default),
	or attached to a DPIO object, or attached to DPCON object.
	4. Allows interaction with one or more DPIO objects for
	dequeueing/enqueueing frame descriptors(FD) and for
	acquiring/releasing buffers.
	5. Supports enable, disable, and reset operations.

Add dpdmai to support some platforms with dpaa2 qdma engine.
