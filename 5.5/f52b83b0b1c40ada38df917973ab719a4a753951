afs: Fix afs_lookup() to not clobber the version on a new dentry

Fix afs_lookup() to not clobber the version set on a new dentry by
afs_do_lookup() - especially as it's using the wrong version of the
version (we need to use the one given to us by whatever op the dir
contents correspond to rather than what's in the afs_vnode).
