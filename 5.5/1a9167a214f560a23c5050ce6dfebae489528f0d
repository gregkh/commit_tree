KVM: PPC: Report single stepping capability

When calling the KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG ioctl, userspace might request
the next instruction to be single stepped via the
KVM_GUESTDBG_SINGLESTEP control bit of the kvm_guest_debug structure.

This patch adds the KVM_CAP_PPC_GUEST_DEBUG_SSTEP capability in order
to inform userspace about the state of single stepping support.

We currently don't have support for guest single stepping implemented
in Book3S HV so the capability is only present for Book3S PR and
BookE.
