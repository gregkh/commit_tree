rtc: ds1685: add indirect access method and remove plat_read/plat_write

SGI Octane (IP30) doesn't have RTC register directly mapped into CPU
address space, but accesses RTC registers with an address and data
register.  This is now supported by additional access functions, which
are selected by a new field in platform data. Removed plat_read/plat_write
since there is no user and their usage could introduce lifetime issue,
when functions are placed in different modules.
