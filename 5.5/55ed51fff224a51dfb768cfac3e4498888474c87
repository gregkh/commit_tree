{tty: serial, nand: onenand}: samsung: rename to fix build warning

Any arm config which has 'CONFIG_MTD_ONENAND_SAMSUNG=m' and
'CONFIG_SERIAL_SAMSUNG=m' gives a build warning:

warning: same module names found:
  drivers/tty/serial/samsung.ko
  drivers/mtd/nand/onenand/samsung.ko

Rename both drivers/tty/serial/samsung.c to
drivers/tty/serial/samsung_tty.c and drivers/mtd/nand/onenand/samsung.c
drivers/mtd/nand/onenand/samsung_mtd.c to fix the warning.
