smb3: query attributes on file close

Since timestamps on files on most servers can be updated at
close, and since timestamps on our dentries default to one
second we can have stale timestamps in some common cases
(e.g. open, write, close, stat, wait one second, stat - will
show different mtime for the first and second stat).

The SMB2/SMB3 protocol allows querying timestamps at close
so add the code to request timestamp and attr information
(which is cheap for the server to provide) to be returned
when a file is closed (it is not needed for the many
paths that call SMB2_close that are from compounded
query infos and close nor is it needed for some of
the cases where a directory close immediately follows a
directory open.
