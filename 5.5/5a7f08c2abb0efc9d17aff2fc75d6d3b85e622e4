net: phy: dp83867: enable robust auto-mdix

The link detection timeouts can be observed (or link might not be detected
at all) when dp83867 PHY is configured in manual mode (speed/duplex).

CFG3[9] Robust Auto-MDIX option allows to significantly improve link detection
in case dp83867 is configured in manual mode and reduce link detection
time.
As per DM: "If link partners are configured to operational modes that are
not supported by normal Auto MDI/MDIX mode (like Auto-Neg versus Force
100Base-TX or Force 100Base-TX versus Force 100Base-TX), this Robust Auto
MDI/MDIX mode allows MDI/MDIX resolution and prevents deadlock."

Hence, enable this option by default as there are no known reasons
not to do so.
