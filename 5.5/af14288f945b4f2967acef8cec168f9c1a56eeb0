r8152: support firmware of PHY NC for RTL8153A

Support the firmware of PHY NC which is used to fix the issue found
for PHY. Currently, only RTL_VER_04, RTL_VER_05, and RTL_VER_06 need
it.

The order of loading PHY firmware would be

	RTL_FW_PHY_START
	RTL_FW_PHY_NC
	RTL_FW_PHY_STOP

The RTL_FW_PHY_START/RTL_FW_PHY_STOP are used to lock/unlock the PHY,
and set/clear the patch key from the firmware file.
