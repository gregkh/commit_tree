mm/migrate.c: handle freed page at the first place

When doing migration if the freed page is met, we just return without
migrating it since it is pointless to migrate a freed page.  But, the
current code allocates target page unconditionally before handling freed
page, if the page is freed, the newly allocated will be just freed.  It
doesn't make too much sense and is just a waste of time although
migrating freed page is rare.

So, handle freed page at the before that to avoid unnecessary page
allocation and free.
