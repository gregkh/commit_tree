drm/amdgpu: Optimize KFD page table reservation

Be less pessimistic about estimated page table use for KFD. Most
allocations use 2MB pages and therefore need less VRAM for page
tables. This allows more VRAM to be used for applications especially
on large systems with many GPUs and hundreds of GB of system memory.

Example: 8 GPUs with 32GB VRAM each + 256GB system memory = 512GB
Old page table reservation per GPU:  1GB
New page table reservation per GPU: 32MB
