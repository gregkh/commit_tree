fpga: dfl: fme: add thermal management support

This patch adds support to thermal management private feature for DFL
FPGA Management Engine (FME). This private feature driver registers
a hwmon for thermal/temperature monitoring (hwmon temp1_input).
If hardware automatic throttling is supported by this hardware, then
driver also exposes sysfs interfaces under hwmon for thresholds
(temp1_max/ crit/ emergency), threshold alarms (temp1_max_alarm/
temp1_crit_alarm) and throttling policy (temp1_max_policy).
