ath10k: use ath10k_pci_soc_ functions for all warm_reset instances

Use ath10k_pci_soc_read32 / ath10k_pci_soc_write32 functions for
the rest of warm_reset functions. Until now these have been used
only for ath10k_pci_warm_reset_si0, but since they already exist
it makes sense to simplify code a bit.
Runtime tested with QCA9862.
