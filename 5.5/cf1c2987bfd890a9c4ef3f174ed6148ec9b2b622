staging: qlge: Remove useless dma synchronization calls

This is unneeded for two reasons:
1) the cpu does not write data for the device in the mapping
2) calls like ..._sync_..._for_device(..., ..._FROMDEVICE) are
   nonsensical, see commit 3f0fb4e85b38 ("Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt:
   fix misleading example")
