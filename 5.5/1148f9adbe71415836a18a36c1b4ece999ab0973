net, sysctl: Fix compiler warning when only cBPF is present

proc_dointvec_minmax_bpf_restricted() has been firstly introduced
in commit 2e4a30983b0f ("bpf: restrict access to core bpf sysctls")
under CONFIG_HAVE_EBPF_JIT. Then, this ifdef has been removed in
ede95a63b5e8 ("bpf: add bpf_jit_limit knob to restrict unpriv
allocations"), because a new sysctl, bpf_jit_limit, made use of it.
Finally, this parameter has become long instead of integer with
fdadd04931c2 ("bpf: fix bpf_jit_limit knob for PAGE_SIZE >= 64K")
and thus, a new proc_dolongvec_minmax_bpf_restricted() has been
added.

With this last change, we got back to that
proc_dointvec_minmax_bpf_restricted() is used only under
CONFIG_HAVE_EBPF_JIT, but the corresponding ifdef has not been
brought back.

So, in configurations like CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y && CONFIG_HAVE_EBPF_JIT=n
since v4.20 we have:

  CC      net/core/sysctl_net_core.o
net/core/sysctl_net_core.c:292:1: warning: ‘proc_dointvec_minmax_bpf_restricted’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
  292 | proc_dointvec_minmax_bpf_restricted(struct ctl_table *table, int write,
      | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppress this by guarding it with CONFIG_HAVE_EBPF_JIT again.
