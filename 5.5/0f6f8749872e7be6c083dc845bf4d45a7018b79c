staging: vchiq: Have vchiq_dump_* functions return an error code

These functions currently modify the struct dump_context passed
to them, and set context->actual to -EFAULT in case of error.
The issue is that this is never returned to the user (except
accidentally when things align so that that happens). So, have
these functions return 0 on success and the appropriate error
code otherwise, and return nonzero errors to the user.
