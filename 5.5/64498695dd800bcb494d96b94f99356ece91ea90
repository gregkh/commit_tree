mei: bus: add more client attributes to sysfs

Export more client attributes via sysfs that are usually obtained
upon connection. In some cases, for example a monitoring application
may wish to know the attributes without actually performing the connection.
Added attributes:
max number of connections, fixed address, max message length.
