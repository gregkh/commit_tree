selftests/bpf: Adjust CO-RE reloc tests for new bpf_core_read() macro

To allow adding a variadic BPF_CORE_READ macro with slightly different
syntax and semantics, define CORE_READ in CO-RE reloc tests, which is
a thin wrapper around low-level bpf_core_read() macro, which in turn is
just a wrapper around bpf_probe_read().
