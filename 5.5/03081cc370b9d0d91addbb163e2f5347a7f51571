ASoC: samsung: arndale: Add support for WM1811 CODEC

The Arndale boards come with different types of the audio daughter
board.  In order to support the WM1811 one we add new definition of
an ASoC card which will be registered when the driver matches on
"samsung,arndale-wm1811" compatible.  There is no runtime detection of
the audio daughter board type at the moment, compatible string of the
audio card needs to be adjusted in DT, e.g. by the bootloader,
depending on actual audio board (CODEC) used.
