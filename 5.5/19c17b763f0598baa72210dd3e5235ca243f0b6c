drm/i915/execlists: Use vfunc to check engine submission mode

While processing CSB there is no need to look at GuC submission
settings, just check if engine is configured for execlists mode.

While today GuC submission is disabled it's settings are still
based on modparam values that might not correctly reflect actual
submission status in case of any fallback. Until that is fully
fixed, use alternate method to confirm that engine really runs in
execlists mode by comparing set_default_submission vfunc.

v2: add other immediate use of new helper
