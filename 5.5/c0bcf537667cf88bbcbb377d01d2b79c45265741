net: dsa: ocelot: add hardware timestamping support for Felix

This patch is to reuse ocelot functions as possible to enable PTP
clock and to support hardware timestamping on Felix.
On TX path, timestamping works on packet which requires timestamp.
The injection header will be configured accordingly, and skb clone
requires timestamp will be added into a list. The TX timestamp
is final handled in threaded interrupt handler when PTP timestamp
FIFO is ready.
On RX path, timestamping is always working. The RX timestamp could
be got from extraction header.
