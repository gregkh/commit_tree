bpf/sockmap: Read psock ingress_msg before sk_receive_queue

Right now in tcp_bpf_recvmsg, sock read data first from sk_receive_queue
if not empty than psock->ingress_msg otherwise. If a FIN packet arrives
and there's also some data in psock->ingress_msg, the data in
psock->ingress_msg will be purged. It is always happen when request to a
HTTP1.0 server like python SimpleHTTPServer since the server send FIN
packet after data is sent out.

Fixes: 604326b41a6fb ("bpf, sockmap: convert to generic sk_msg interface")
