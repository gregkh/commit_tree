PCI/ASPM: Remove pcie_aspm_enabled() unnecessary locking

The lifetime of the link_state structure (bridge->link_state) is not the
same as the lifetime of "bridge" itself.  The link_state is allocated by
pcie_aspm_init_link_state() after children of the bridge have been
enumerated, and it is deallocated by pcie_aspm_exit_link_state() after all
children of the bridge (but not the bridge itself) have been removed.

Previously pcie_aspm_enabled() acquired aspm_lock to ensure that
link_state was not deallocated while we're looking at it.  But the fact
that the caller of pcie_aspm_enabled() holds a reference to @pdev means
there's always at least one child of the bridge, which means link_state
can't be deallocated.

Remove the unnecessary locking in pcie_aspm_enabled().
