btrfs: compression: attach workspace manager to the ops

There's a lot of indirection when the generic code calls into
algo-specific callbacks to reach the private workspace manager structure
and back to the generic code.

To simplify that, export the workspace manager for heuristic, LZO and
ZLIB, while ZSTD is going to use it's own manager.
