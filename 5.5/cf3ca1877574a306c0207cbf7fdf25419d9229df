hwmon: (adt7475) Make volt2reg return same reg as reg2volt input

reg2volt returns the voltage that matches a given register value.
Converting this back the other way with volt2reg didn't return the same
register value because it used truncation instead of rounding.

This meant that values read from sysfs could not be written back to sysfs
to set back the same register value.

With this change, volt2reg will return the same value for every voltage
previously returned by reg2volt (for the set of possible input values)
