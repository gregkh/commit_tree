btrfs: move block_group_item::used to block group

For unknown reasons, the member 'used' in the block group struct is
stored in the b-tree item and accessed everywhere using the special
accessor helper. Let's unify it and make it a regular member and only
update the item before writing it to the tree.

The item is still being used for flags and chunk_objectid, there's some
duplication until the item is removed in following patches.
