x86/xen/32: Simplify ring check in xen_iret_crit_fixup()

This can be had with two instead of six insns, by just checking the high
CS.RPL bit.

Also adjust the comment - there would be no #GP in the mentioned cases, as
there's no segment limit violation or alike. Instead there'd be #PF, but
that one reports the target EIP of said branch, not the address of the
branch insn itself.
