mlxsw: spectrum: Use dedicated policer for VRRP packets

Currently, VRRP packets and packets that hit exceptions during routing
(e.g., MTU error) are policed using the same policer towards the CPU.
This means, for example, that misconfiguration of the MTU on a routed
interface can prevent VRRP packets from reaching the CPU, which in turn
can cause the VRRP daemon to assume it is the Master router.

Fix this by using a dedicated policer for VRRP packets.
