spi: zynq-qspi: Keep the bitfields naming consistent

Most of the bits/bitfields #define'd in this driver are composed with:
1/ the driver prefix
2/ the name of the register they apply to

Keep the naming consistent by applying this rule to the CONFIG register
internals. These definitions will be used in a following change set.
