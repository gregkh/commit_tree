tipc: fix use-after-free in tipc_disc_rcv()

In the function 'tipc_disc_rcv()', the 'msg_peer_net_hash()' is called
to read the header data field but after the message skb has been freed,
that might result in a garbage value...

This commit fixes it by defining a new local variable to store the data
first, just like the other header fields' handling.
