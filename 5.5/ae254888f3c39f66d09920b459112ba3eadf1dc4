ALSA: hda: hdmi - fix regression in connect list handling

Fix regression in how intel_haswell_fixup_connect_list()
results are used in hda_read_pin_conn(). Use of
snd_hda_get_raw_connections() in hda_read_pin_conn() bypasses
the cache and thus also bypasses the overridden pin connection
list. On platforms that require the connection list fixup,
mux list will be empty and HDMI playback will fail to -EBUSY
at open.

Fix the regression in hda_read_pinn_conn(). Simplify code
as suggested by Takashi Iwai to remove old
intel_haswell_fixup_connect_list() and copy the cvt_nid list
directly and not use snd_hda_override_conn_list() at all.
