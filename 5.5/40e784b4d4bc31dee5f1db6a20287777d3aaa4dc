MIPS: atomic: Unify 32b & 64b sub_if_positive

Unify the definitions of atomic_sub_if_positive() &
atomic64_sub_if_positive() using a macro like we do for most other
atomic functions. This allows us to share the implementation ensuring
consistency between the two. Notably this provides the appropriate
loongson3_war barriers in the atomic64_sub_if_positive() case which were
previously missing.

The code is rearranged a little to handle the !kernel_uses_llsc case
first in order to de-indent the LL/SC case & allow us not to go over 80
characters per line.
