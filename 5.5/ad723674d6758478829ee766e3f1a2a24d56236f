x86/efi: move common keyring handler functions to new file

The handlers to add the keys to the .platform keyring and blacklisted
hashes to the .blacklist keyring is common for both the uefi and powerpc
mechanisms of loading the keys/hashes from the firmware.

This patch moves the common code from load_uefi.c to keyring_handler.c
