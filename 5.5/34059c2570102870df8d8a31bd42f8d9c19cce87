KVM: x86: Fold decache_cr3() into cache_reg()

Handle caching CR3 (from VMX's VMCS) into struct kvm_vcpu via the common
cache_reg() callback and drop the dedicated decache_cr3().  The name
decache_cr3() is somewhat confusing as the caching behavior of CR3
follows that of GPRs, RFLAGS and PDPTRs, (handled via cache_reg()), and
has nothing in common with the caching behavior of CR0/CR4 (whose
decache_cr{0,4}_guest_bits() likely provided the 'decache' verbiage).

This would effectivel adds a BUG() if KVM attempts to cache CR3 on SVM.
Change it to a WARN_ON_ONCE() -- if the cache never requires filling,
the value is already in the right place -- and opportunistically add one
in VMX to provide an equivalent check.
