perf maps: Merge 'struct maps' with 'struct map_groups'

And pick the shortest name: 'struct maps'.

The split existed because we used to have two groups of maps, one for
functions and one for variables, but that only complicated things,
sometimes we needed to figure out what was at some address and then had
to first try it on the functions group and if that failed, fall back to
the variables one.

That split is long gone, so for quite a while we had only one struct
maps per struct map_groups, simplify things by combining those structs.

First patch is the minimum needed to merge both, follow up patches will
rename 'thread->mg' to 'thread->maps', etc.
