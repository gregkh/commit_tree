i2c: remove helpers for ref-counting clients

There are no in-tree users of these helpers anymore, and there
shouldn't. Most use cases went away once the driver model started to
refcount for us. There have been users like the media subsystem, but
they all switched to better refcounting methods meanwhile. Media did
this in 2008. Last user (IPMI) left 2018. Remove this cruft.
