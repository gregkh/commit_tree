PM / devfreq: tegra30: Use kHz units for dependency threshold

The dependency threshold designates a memory activity level below which
CPU's frequency isn't accounted. Currently the threshold is given in
"memory cycle" units and that value depends on the polling interval which
is fixed to 12ms in the driver. Later on we'd want to add support for a
variable polling interval and thus the threshold value either needs to be
scaled in accordance to the polling interval or it needs to be represented
in a units that do not depend on the polling interval.

It is nicer to have threshold value being defined independently of the
polling interval, thus this patch converts the dependency threshold units
from "cycle" to "kHz". Having this change as a separate-preparatory patch
will make easier to follow further patches.
