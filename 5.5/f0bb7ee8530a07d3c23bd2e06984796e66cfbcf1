perf auxtrace: Add support for AUX area sample recording

Add support for parsing and validating AUX area sample options. At
present, the only option is the sample size, but it is also necessary to
ensure that events are in a group with an AUX area event as the leader.

Committer note:

Add missing 'static inline' in front of auxtrace_parse_sample_options()
for when we don't HAVE_AUXTRACE_SUPPORT.
