blk-cgroup: cgroup_rstat_updated() shouldn't be called on cgroup1

Currently, cgroup rstat is supported only on cgroup2 hierarchy and
rstat functions shouldn't be called on cgroup1 cgroups.  While
converting blk-cgroup core statistics to rstat, f73316482977
("blk-cgroup: reimplement basic IO stats using cgroup rstat")
accidentally ended up calling cgroup_rstat_updated() on cgroup1
cgroups causing crashes.

Longer term, we probably should add cgroup1 support to rstat but for
now let's mask the call directly.
