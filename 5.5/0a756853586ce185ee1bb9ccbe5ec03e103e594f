kunit: test: add test resource management API

Create a common API for test managed resources like memory and test
objects. A lot of times a test will want to set up infrastructure to be
used in test cases; this could be anything from just wanting to allocate
some memory to setting up a driver stack; this defines facilities for
creating "test resources" which are managed by the test infrastructure
and are automatically cleaned up at the conclusion of the test.
