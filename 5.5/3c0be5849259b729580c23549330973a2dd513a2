MIPS: Drop 32-bit asm string functions

We have assembly implementations of strcpy(), strncpy(), strcmp() &
strncmp() which:

 - Are simple byte-at-a-time loops with no particular optimizations. As
   a comment in the code describes, they're "rather naive".

 - Offer no clear performance advantage over the generic C
   implementations - in microbenchmarks performed by Alexander Lobakin
   the asm functions sometimes win & sometimes lose, but generally not
   by large margins in either direction.

 - Don't support 64-bit kernels, where we already make use of the
   generic C implementations.

 - Tend to bloat kernel code size due to inlining.

 - Don't support CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

 - Won't support nanoMIPS without rework.

For all of these reasons, delete the asm implementations & make use of
the generic C implementations for 32-bit kernels just like we already do
for 64-bit kernels.
