ALSA: pcm: Yet another missing check of non-cached buffer type

For non-x86 architectures, SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_UC should be treated
equivalent with SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV, where the default mmap handler
still checks only about SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV.  Make the check more
proper.

Note that all existing users of *_UC buffer types are x86-only, so
this doesn't fix any bug, but just for consistency.
