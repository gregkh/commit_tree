tools, bpf_asm: Warn when jumps are out of range

When compiling larger programs with bpf_asm, it's possible to
accidentally exceed jt/jf range, in which case it won't complain, but
rather silently emit a truncated offset, leading to a "happy debugging"
situation.

Add a warning to help detecting such issues. It could be made an error
instead, but this might break compilation of existing code (which might
be working by accident).
