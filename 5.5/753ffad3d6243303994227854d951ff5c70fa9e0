mac80211: fix TID field in monitor mode transmit

Fix overwriting of the qos_ctrl.tid field for encrypted frames injected on
a monitor interface. While qos_ctrl.tid is not encrypted, it's used as an
input into the encryption algorithm so it's protected, and thus cannot be
modified after encryption. For injected frames, the encryption may already
have been done in userspace, so we cannot change any fields.

Before passing the frame to the driver, the qos_ctrl.tid field is updated
from skb->priority. Prior to dbd50a851c50 skb->priority was updated in
ieee80211_select_queue_80211(), but this function is no longer always
called.

Update skb->priority in ieee80211_monitor_start_xmit() so that the value
is stored, and when later code 'modifies' the TID it really sets it to
the same value as before, preserving the encryption.
