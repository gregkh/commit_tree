drm/virtio: notify virtqueues without holding spinlock

Split virtqueue_kick() call into virtqueue_kick_prepare(), which
requires serialization, and virtqueue_notify(), which does not.  Move
the virtqueue_notify() call out of the critical section protected by the
queue lock.  This avoids triggering a vmexit while holding the lock and
thereby fixes a rather bad spinlock contention.
