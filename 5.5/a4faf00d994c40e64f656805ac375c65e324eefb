perf/aux: Allow using AUX data in perf samples

AUX data can be used to annotate perf events such as performance counters
or tracepoints/breakpoints by including it in sample records when
PERF_SAMPLE_AUX flag is set. Such samples would be instrumental in debugging
and profiling by providing, for example, a history of instruction flow
leading up to the event's overflow.

The implementation makes use of grouping an AUX event with all the events
that wish to take samples of the AUX data, such that the former is the
group leader. The samplees should also specify the desired size of the AUX
sample via attr.aux_sample_size.

AUX capable PMUs need to explicitly add support for sampling, because it
relies on a new callback to take a snapshot of the buffer without touching
the event states.
