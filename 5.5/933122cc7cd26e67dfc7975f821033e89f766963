drm/i915: Remove duplicated bxt/cnl/icl .modeset_calc_cdclk() funcs

Reuse the same .modeset_calc_cdclk() function for all bxt+.

The only difference in between the cnl/icl and the bxt variants
is the call to cnl_compute_min_voltage_level(). We can do that call
just fine on older platforms since they leave min_voltage_level[]
zeroed. Let's rename the function to bxt_compute_min_voltage_level()
just so it stays consistent with the rest of the naming scheme.
