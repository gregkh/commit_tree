xfs: simplify parsing of allocsize mount option

Rework xfs_parseargs to fill out the default value and then parse the
option directly into the mount structure, similar to what we do for
other updates, and open code the now trivial updates based on on the
on-disk superblock directly into xfs_mountfs.

Note that this change rejects the allocsize=0 mount option that has been
documented as invalid for a long time instead of just ignoring it.
