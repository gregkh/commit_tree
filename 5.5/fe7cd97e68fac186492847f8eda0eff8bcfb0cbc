MIPS: bitops: Handle !kernel_uses_llsc first

Reorder conditions in our various bitops functions that check
kernel_uses_llsc such that they handle the !kernel_uses_llsc case first.
This allows us to avoid the need to duplicate the kernel_uses_llsc check
in all the other cases. For functions that don't involve barriers common
to the various implementations, we switch to returning from within each
if block making each case easier to read in isolation.
