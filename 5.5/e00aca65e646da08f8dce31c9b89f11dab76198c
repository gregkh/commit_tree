libbpf: Make DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS macro strictly a variable declaration

LIBBPF_OPTS is implemented as a mix of field declaration and memset
+ assignment. This makes it neither variable declaration nor purely
statements, which is a problem, because you can't mix it with either
other variable declarations nor other function statements, because C90
compiler mode emits warning on mixing all that together.

This patch changes LIBBPF_OPTS into a strictly declaration of variable
and solves this problem, as can be seen in case of bpftool, which
previously would emit compiler warning, if done this way (LIBBPF_OPTS as
part of function variables declaration block).

This patch also renames LIBBPF_OPTS into DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS to follow
kernel convention for similar macros more closely.

v1->v2:
- rename LIBBPF_OPTS into DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS (Jakub Sitnicki).
