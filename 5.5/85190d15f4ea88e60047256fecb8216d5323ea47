pipe: don't use 'pipe_wait() for basic pipe IO

pipe_wait() may be simple, but since it relies on the pipe lock, it
means that we have to do the wakeup while holding the lock.  That's
unfortunate, because the very first thing the waked entity will want to
do is to get the pipe lock for itself.

So get rid of the pipe_wait() usage by simply releasing the pipe lock,
doing the wakeup (if required) and then using wait_event_interruptible()
to wait on the right condition instead.

wait_event_interruptible() handles races on its own by comparing the
wakeup condition before and after adding itself to the wait queue, so
you can use an optimistic unlocked condition for it.
