ASoC: fsl_asrc: update supported sample format

The ASRC support 24bit/16bit/8bit input width, which is
data width, not slot width.

For the S20_3LE format, the data with is 20bit, slot width
is 24bit, if we set ASRMCR1n.IWD to be 24bits, the result
is the volume is lower than expected, it likes 24bit data
right shift 4 bits

So replace S20_3LE with S24_3LE in supported list and add S8
format in TX supported list
