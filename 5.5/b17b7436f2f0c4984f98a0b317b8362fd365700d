KVM: VMX: Skip GUEST_CR3 VMREAD+VMWRITE if the VMCS is up-to-date

Skip the VMWRITE to update GUEST_CR3 if CR3 is not available, i.e. has
not been read from the VMCS since the last VM-Enter.  If vcpu->arch.cr3
is stale, kvm_read_cr3(vcpu) will refresh vcpu->arch.cr3 from the VMCS,
meaning KVM will do a VMREAD and then VMWRITE the value it just pulled
from the VMCS.

Note, this is a purely theoretical change, no instances of skipping
the VMREAD+VMWRITE have been observed with this change.
