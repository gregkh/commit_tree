io_uring: only !null ptr to io_issue_sqe()

Pass only non-null @nxt to io_issue_sqe() and handle it at the caller's
side. And propagate it.

- kiocb_done() is only called from io_read() and io_write(), which are
only called from io_issue_sqe(), so it's @nxt != NULL

- io_put_req_find_next() is called either with explicitly non-null local
nxt, or from one of the functions in io_issue_sqe() switch (or their
callees).
