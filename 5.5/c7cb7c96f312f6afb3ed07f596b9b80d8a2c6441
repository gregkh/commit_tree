arm64: defconfig: Change CONFIG_AT803X_PHY from m to y

With phy-reset-gpios are enabled for i.MX8MM-EVK board, phy
will be reset. Without CONFIG_AT803X_PHY as y, board will stop
booting in NFS DHCP, because phy is not ready. So mark
CONFIG_AT803X_PHY from m to y to make board boot when using nfs rootfs.
