iwlwifi: pcie: allocate smaller dev_cmd for TX headers

As noted in the previous commit, due to the way we allocate the
dev_cmd headers with 324 byte size, and 4/8 byte alignment, the
part we use of them (bytes 20..40-68) could still cross a page
and thus 2^32 boundary.

Address this by using alignment to ensure that the allocation
cannot cross a page boundary, on hardware that's affected. To
make that not cause more memory consumption, reduce the size of
the allocations to the necessary size - we go from 324 bytes in
each allocation to 60/68 on gen2 depending on family, and ~120
or so on gen1 (so on gen1 it's a pure reduction in size, since
we don't need alignment there).

To avoid size and clearing issues, add a new structure that's
just the header, and use kmem_cache_zalloc().
