m68k: q40: Fix info-leak in rtc_ioctl

When the option is RTC_PLL_GET, pll will be copied to userland
via copy_to_user. pll is initialized using mach_get_rtc_pll indirect
call and mach_get_rtc_pll is only assigned with function
q40_get_rtc_pll in arch/m68k/q40/config.c.
In function q40_get_rtc_pll, the field pll_ctrl is not initialized.
This will leak uninitialized stack content to userland.
Fix this by zeroing the uninitialized field.
