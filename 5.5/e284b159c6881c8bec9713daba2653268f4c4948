RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix chip number validation Broadcom's Gen P5 series

In the first version of Gen P5 ASIC, chip-id was always set to 0x1750 for
all adaptor port configurations. This has been fixed in the new chip rev.

Due to this missing fix users are not able to use adaptors based on latest
chip rev of Broadcom's Gen P5 adaptors.

Fixes: ae8637e13185 ("RDMA/bnxt_re: Add chip context to identify 57500 series")
