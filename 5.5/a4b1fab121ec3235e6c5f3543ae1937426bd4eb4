erofs: clean up decompress queue stuffs

Previously, both z_erofs_unzip_io and z_erofs_unzip_io_sb
record decompress queues for backend to use.

The only difference is that z_erofs_unzip_io is used for
on-stack sync decompression so that it doesn't have a super
block field (since the caller can pass it in its context),
but it increases complexity with only a pointer saving.

Rename z_erofs_unzip_io to z_erofs_decompressqueue with
a fixed super_block member and kill the other entirely,
and it can fallback to sync decompression if memory
allocation failure.
