crypto: poly1305 - expose init/update/final library interface

Expose the existing generic Poly1305 code via a init/update/final
library interface so that callers are not required to go through
the crypto API's shash abstraction to access it. At the same time,
make some preparations so that the library implementation can be
superseded by an accelerated arch-specific version in the future.
