ASoC: rt5677: Stop and restart DSP over suspend/resume

MCLK1 gets disabled at suspend and re-enabled at resume. Before
MCLK1 is re-enabled, if the DSP is already on (either the DSP was
left on during suspend, or the DSP is turned on early at resume),
i2c register read returns garbage and corrupts the regmap cache.

This patch stops the DSP before suspend and restarts it after
resume with a dalay to ensure MCLK is on while loading firmware.
