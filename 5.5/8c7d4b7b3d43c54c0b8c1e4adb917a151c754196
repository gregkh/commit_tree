usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix logical condition

This patch corrects the condition to kick the transfer without
giving back the requests when either request has remaining data
or when there are pending SGs. The && check was introduced during
spliting up the dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_completed_requests() function.

Fixes: f38e35dd84e2 ("usb: dwc3: gadget: split dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_completed_requests()")
