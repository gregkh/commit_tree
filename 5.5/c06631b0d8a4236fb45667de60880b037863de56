btrfs: Enhance error output for write time tree checker

Unlike read time tree checker errors, write time error can't be
inspected by "btrfs inspect dump-tree", so we need extra information to
determine what's going wrong.

The patch will add the following output for write time tree checker
error:

- The content of the offending tree block
  To help determining if it's a false alert.

- Kernel WARN_ON() for debug build
  This is helpful for us to detect unexpected write time tree checker
  error, especially fstests could catch the dmesg.
  Since the WARN_ON() is only triggered for write time tree checker,
  test cases utilizing dm-error won't trigger this WARN_ON(), thus no
  extra noise.
