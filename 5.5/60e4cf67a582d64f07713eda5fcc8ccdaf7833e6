reiserfs: fix extended attributes on the root directory

Since commit d0a5b995a308 (vfs: Add IOP_XATTR inode operations flag)
extended attributes haven't worked on the root directory in reiserfs.

This is due to reiserfs conditionally setting the sb->s_xattrs handler
array depending on whether it located or create the internal privroot
directory.  It necessarily does this after the root inode is already
read in.  The IOP_XATTR flag is set during inode initialization, so
it never gets set on the root directory.

This commit unconditionally assigns sb->s_xattrs and clears IOP_XATTR on
internal inodes.  The old return values due to the conditional assignment
are handled via open_xa_root, which now returns EOPNOTSUPP as the VFS
would have done.
