pref tools: Make 'struct addr_map_symbol' contain 'struct map_symbol'

So that we pass that substructure around and with it consolidate lots of
functions that receive a (map, symbol) pair and now can receive just a
'struct map_symbol' pointer.

This further paves the way to add 'struct map_groups' to 'struct
map_symbol' so that we can have all we need for annotation so that we
can ditch 'struct map'->groups, i.e. have the map_groups pointer in a
more central place, avoiding the pointer in the 'struct map' that have
tons of instances.
