btrfs: use better definition of number of compression type

The compression type upper limit constant is the same as the last value
and this is confusing.  In order to keep coding style consistent, use
BTRFS_NR_COMPRESS_TYPES as the total number that follows the idom of
'NR' being one more than the last value.
