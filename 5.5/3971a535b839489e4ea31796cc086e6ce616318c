mlxsw: spectrum_qdisc: Ignore grafting of invisible FIFO

The following patch will change PRIO to replace a removed Qdisc with an
invisible FIFO, instead of NOOP. mlxsw will see this replacement due to the
graft message that is generated. But because FIFO does not issue its own
REPLACE message, when the graft operation takes place, the Qdisc that mlxsw
tracks under the indicated band is still the old one. The child
handle (0:0) therefore does not match, and mlxsw rejects the graft
operation, which leads to an extack message:

    Warning: Offloading graft operation failed.

Fix by ignoring the invisible children in the PRIO graft handler. The
DESTROY message of the removed Qdisc is going to follow shortly and handle
the removal.
