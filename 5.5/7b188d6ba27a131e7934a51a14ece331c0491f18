media: ov6650: Fix crop rectangle alignment not passed back

Commit 4f996594ceaf ("[media] v4l2: make vidioc_s_crop const")
introduced a writable copy of constified user requested crop rectangle
in order to be able to perform hardware alignments on it.  Later
on, commit 10d5509c8d50 ("[media] v4l2: remove g/s_crop from video
ops") replaced s_crop() video operation using that const argument with
set_selection() pad operation which had a corresponding argument not
constified, however the original behavior of the driver was not
restored.  Since that time, any hardware alignment applied on a user
requested crop rectangle is not passed back to the user calling
.set_selection() as it should be.

Fix the issue by dropping the copy and replacing all references to it
with references to the crop rectangle embedded in the user argument.
