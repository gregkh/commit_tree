PCI/ATS: Consolidate ATS declarations in linux/pci-ats.h

Move ATS function prototypes from include/linux/pci.h to
include/linux/pci-ats.h as the ATS, PRI, and PASID interfaces are related
and are used only by the IOMMU drivers.  This effectively reverts
ff9bee895c4d ("PCI: Move ATS declarations to linux/pci.h so they're all
together").

Also, remove surplus forward declaration of struct pci_ats from
include/linux/pci.h, as it is no longer needed, since struct pci_ats was
embedded directly into struct pci_dev by d544d75ac96a ("PCI: Embed ATS info
directly into struct pci_dev").

No functional changes intended.
