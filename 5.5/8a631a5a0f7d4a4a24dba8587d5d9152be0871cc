dmaengine: xilinx_dma: Clear desc_pendingcount in xilinx_dma_reset

Whenever we reset the channel, we need to clear desc_pendingcount
along with desc_submitcount. Otherwise when a new transaction is
submitted, the irq coalesce level could be programmed to an incorrect
value in the axidma case.

This behavior can be observed when terminating pending transactions
with xilinx_dma_terminate_all() and then submitting new transactions
without releasing and requesting the channel.
