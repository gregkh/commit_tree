treewide: Use sizeof_field() macro

Replace all the occurrences of FIELD_SIZEOF() with sizeof_field() except
at places where these are defined. Later patches will remove the unused
definition of FIELD_SIZEOF().

This patch is generated using following script:

EXCLUDE_FILES="include/linux/stddef.h|include/linux/kernel.h"

git grep -l -e "\bFIELD_SIZEOF\b" | while read file;
do

	if [[ "$file" =~ $EXCLUDE_FILES ]]; then
		continue
	fi
	sed -i  -e 's/\bFIELD_SIZEOF\b/sizeof_field/g' $file;
done
