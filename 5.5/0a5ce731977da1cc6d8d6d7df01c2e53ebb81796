scsi: lpfc: Fix reporting of read-only fw error errors

When the adapter FW is administratively set to RO mode, a FW update
triggered by the driver's sysfs attribute will fail. Currently, the
driver's logging mechanism does not properly parse the adapter return codes
and print a meaningful message.  This oversight prevents quick diagnosis in
the field.

Parse the adapter return codes for Write_Object and write an appropriate
message to the system console.
