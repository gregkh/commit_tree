media: cec: avoid decrementing transmit_queue_sz if it is 0

WARN if transmit_queue_sz is 0 but do not decrement it.
The CEC adapter will become unresponsive if it goes below
0 since then it thinks there are 4 billion messages in the
queue.

Obviously this should not happen, but a driver bug could
cause this.
