crypto: geode-aes - switch to skcipher for cbc(aes) fallback

Commit 79c65d179a40e145 ("crypto: cbc - Convert to skcipher") updated
the generic CBC template wrapper from a blkcipher to a skcipher algo,
to get away from the deprecated blkcipher interface. However, as a side
effect, drivers that instantiate CBC transforms using the blkcipher as
a fallback no longer work, since skciphers can wrap blkciphers but not
the other way around. This broke the geode-aes driver.

So let's fix it by moving to the sync skcipher interface when allocating
the fallback. At the same time, align with the generic API for ECB and
CBC by rejecting inputs that are not a multiple of the AES block size.
