xfs: add mising include of xfs_pnfs.h for missing declarations

The xfs_pnfs.c file is missing an include of xfs_pnfs.h to
add the prototypes of the functions it exports. Include this
file to fix the following sparse warnings:

fs/xfs/xfs_pnfs.c:27:1: warning: symbol 'xfs_break_leased_layouts' was not declared. Should it be static?
fs/xfs/xfs_pnfs.c:52:1: warning: symbol 'xfs_fs_get_uuid' was not declared. Should it be static?
fs/xfs/xfs_pnfs.c:77:1: warning: symbol 'xfs_fs_map_blocks' was not declared. Should it be static?
fs/xfs/xfs_pnfs.c:226:1: warning: symbol 'xfs_fs_commit_blocks' was not declared. Should it be static?
