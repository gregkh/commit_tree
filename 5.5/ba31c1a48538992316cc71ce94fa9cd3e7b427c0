futex: Move futex exit handling into futex code

The futex exit handling is #ifdeffed into mm_release() which is not pretty
to begin with. But upcoming changes to address futex exit races need to add
more functionality to this exit code.

Split it out into a function, move it into futex code and make the various
futex exit functions static.

Preparatory only and no functional change.

Folded build fix from Borislav.
