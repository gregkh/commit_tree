btrfs: add __pure attribute to functions

The attribute is more relaxed than const and the functions could
dereference pointers, as long as the observable state is not changed. We
do have such functions, based on -Wsuggest-attribute=pure .

The visible effects of this patch are negligible, there are differences
in the assembly but hard to summarize.
