USB: idmouse: simplify disconnect handling

Since commit d4ead16f50f9 ("USB: prevent char device open/deregister
race") core prevents further calls to open() after usb_deregister_dev()
returns so there's no need to use the interface data for
synchronisation.

This effectively reverts commit 54d2bc068fd2 ("USB: fix locking in
idmouse") with respect to the open-disconnect race.

Note that the driver already uses a present flag to suppress I/O post
disconnect (even if all USB I/O take place at open).
