xhci-pci: Allow host runtime PM as default also for Intel Ice Lake xHCI

Intel Ice Lake has two xHCI controllers one on PCH and the other as part
of the CPU itself. The latter is also part of the so called Type C
Subsystem (TCSS) sharing ACPI power resources with the PCIe root ports
and the Thunderbolt controllers. In order to put the whole TCSS block
into D3cold the xHCI needs to be runtime suspended as well when idle.

For this reason allow runtime PM as default for Ice Lake TCSS xHCI
controller.
