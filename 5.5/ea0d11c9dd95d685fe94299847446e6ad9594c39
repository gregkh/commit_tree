PM / core: Clean up some function headers in power.h

The power.h is a bit messy due to the various existing CONFIG_PM* Kconfig
combinations. However the final section for wakeup_source_sysfs*() can be
moved inside one of the existing sections rather than adding yet another
one, so let's do that to clean up the code a little bit.
