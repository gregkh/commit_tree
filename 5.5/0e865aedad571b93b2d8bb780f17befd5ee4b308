samples/bpf: Use __LINUX_ARM_ARCH__ selector for arm

For arm, -D__LINUX_ARM_ARCH__=X is min version used as instruction
set selector and is absolutely required while parsing some parts of
headers. It's present in KBUILD_CFLAGS but not in autoconf.h, so let's
retrieve it from and add to programs cflags. In another case errors
like "SMP is not supported" for armv7 and bunch of other errors are
issued resulting to incorrect final object.
