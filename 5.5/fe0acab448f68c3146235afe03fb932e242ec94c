mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: fix P2020 errata handling

Two previous patches introduced below quirks for P2020 platforms.
- SDHCI_QUIRK_RESET_AFTER_REQUEST
- SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_TIMEOUT_VAL

The patches made a mistake to add them in quirks2 of sdhci_host
structure, while they were defined for quirks.
	host->quirks2 |= SDHCI_QUIRK_RESET_AFTER_REQUEST;
	host->quirks2 |= SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_TIMEOUT_VAL;

This patch is to fix them.
	host->quirks |= SDHCI_QUIRK_RESET_AFTER_REQUEST;
	host->quirks |= SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_TIMEOUT_VAL;

Fixes: a46e42712596 ("mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add erratum eSDHC5 support")
