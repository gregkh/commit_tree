PM / devfreq: Add new interrupt_driven flag for governors

Currently interrupt-driven governors (like NVIDIA Tegra30 ACTMON governor)
are used to set polling_ms=0 in order to avoid periodic polling of device
status by devfreq core. This means that polling interval can't be changed
by userspace for such governors.

The new governor flag allows interrupt-driven governors to convey that
devfreq core shouldn't perform polling of device status and thus generic
devfreq polling interval could be supported by these governors now.
