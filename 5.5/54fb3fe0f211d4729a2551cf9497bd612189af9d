Revert "arm64: dts: juno: add dma-ranges property"

This reverts commit 193d00a2b35ee3353813b4006a18131122087205.

Commit 951d48855d86 ("of: Make of_dma_get_range() work on bus nodes")
reworked the logic such that of_dma_get_range() works correctly
starting from a bus node containing "dma-ranges".

Since on Juno we don't have a SoC level bus node and "dma-ranges" is
present only in the root node, we get the following error:

OF: translation of DMA address(0) to CPU address failed node(/sram@2e000000)
OF: translation of DMA address(0) to CPU address failed node(/uart@7ff80000)
...
OF: translation of DMA address(0) to CPU address failed node(/mhu@2b1f0000)
OF: translation of DMA address(0) to CPU address failed node(/iommu@2b600000)
OF: translation of DMA address(0) to CPU address failed node(/iommu@2b600000)
OF: translation of DMA address(0) to CPU address failed node(/iommu@2b600000)

So let's fix it by dropping the "dma-ranges" property for now. This
should be fine since it doesn't represent any kind of device-visible
restriction; it was only there for completeness, and we've since given
in to the assumption that missing "dma-ranges" implies a 1:1 mapping
anyway.

We can add it later with a proper SoC bus node and moving all the
devices that belong there along with the "dma-ranges" if required.
