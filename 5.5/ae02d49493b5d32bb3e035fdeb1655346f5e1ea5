media: hantro: Fix s_fmt for dynamic resolution changes

Commit 953aaa1492c53 ("media: rockchip/vpu: Prepare things to support decoders")
changed the conditions under S_FMT was allowed for OUTPUT
CAPTURE buffers.

However, and according to the mem-to-mem stateless decoder specification,
in order to support dynamic resolution changes, S_FMT should be allowed
even if OUTPUT buffers have been allocated.

Relax decoder S_FMT restrictions on OUTPUT buffers, allowing a
resolution modification, provided the pixel format stays the same.

Tested on RK3288 platforms using ChromiumOS Video Decode/Encode
Accelerator Unittests.
