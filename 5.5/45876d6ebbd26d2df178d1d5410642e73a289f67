Revert "mt76: mt76x0e: don't use hw encryption for MT7630E"

This reverts commit 34b0e9b767bfa09ae233ca0d6ceb299bf2e24600.

Since commit 7bd0650be63c ("mt76: dma: fix buffer unmap with non-linear skbs")
is no longer necessary to disable HW encryption for MT7630E.

Disabling HW encryption helped previously because somehow fragmented
skb's are not created if mac80211 encrypt frames, so buffer unmap bug
of non-linear skbs was not triggered. Now since this bug is properly
fixed by commit 7bd0650be63c ("mt76: dma: fix buffer unmap with
non-linear skbs") , we can enable HW encryption back.
