s390/dasd/cio: Interpret ccw_device_get_mdc return value correctly

The max data count (mdc) is an unsigned 16-bit integer value as per AR
documentation and is received via ccw_device_get_mdc() for a specific
path mask from the CIO layer. The function itself also always returns a
positive mdc value or 0 in case mdc isn't supported or couldn't be
determined.

Though, the comment for this function describes a negative return value
to indicate failures.

As a result, the DASD device driver interprets the return value of
ccw_device_get_mdc() incorrectly. The error case is essentially a dead
code path.

To fix this behaviour, check explicitly for a return value of 0 and
change the comment for ccw_device_get_mdc() accordingly.

This fix merely enables the error code path in the DASD functions
get_fcx_max_data() and verify_fcx_max_data(). The actual functionality
stays the same and is still correct.
