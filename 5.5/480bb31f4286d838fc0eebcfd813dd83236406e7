ARM: tegra: Enable Tegra VDE driver in tegra_defconfig

The video decoder driver was tested by time and works absolutely fine.
The reason why it is in staging is because it doesn't provide common V4L
interface yet, this shouldn't stop driver enabling in the defconfig since
our userspace (libvdpau-tegra) provides combined acceleration of decoding
and displaying without use of V4L.
