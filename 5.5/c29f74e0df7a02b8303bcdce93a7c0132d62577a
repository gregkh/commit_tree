netfilter: nf_flow_table: hardware offload support

This patch adds the dataplane hardware offload to the flowtable
infrastructure. Three new flags represent the hardware state of this
flow:

* FLOW_OFFLOAD_HW: This flow entry resides in the hardware.
* FLOW_OFFLOAD_HW_DYING: This flow entry has been scheduled to be remove
  from hardware. This might be triggered by either packet path (via TCP
  RST/FIN packet) or via aging.
* FLOW_OFFLOAD_HW_DEAD: This flow entry has been already removed from
  the hardware, the software garbage collector can remove it from the
  software flowtable.

This patch supports for:

* IPv4 only.
* Aging via FLOW_CLS_STATS, no packet and byte counter synchronization
  at this stage.

This patch also adds the action callback that specifies how to convert
the flow entry into the flow_rule object that is passed to the driver.
