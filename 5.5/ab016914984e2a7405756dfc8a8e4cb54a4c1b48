drm/i915: disable set/get_tiling ioctl on gen12+

The cpu (de)tiler hw is gone, this stopped being useful. Plus it never
supported any of the fancy new tiling formats, which means userspace
also stopped using the magic side-channel this provides.

This would totally break a lot of the igts, but they're already broken
for the same reasons as userspace on gen12 would be.

v2: Look at ggtt->num_fences instead, that also avoids the need for a
comment (Chris). This also means that gen12 support really needs to
make sure num_fences is set to 0. There is a patch for that, but it
checks for HAS_MAPPABLE_APERTURE, which I'm not sure is the right
thing really. Adding relevant people.
