drm/amd/display: OTC underflow fix

[Why] Underflow occurs on some display setups(repro'd on 3x4K HDR) on boot,
mode set, and hot-plugs with. Underflow occurs because mem clk
is not set high after disabling pstate switching. This behaviour occurs
because some calculations assumed displays were synchronized.

[How] Add a condition to check if timing sync is disabled so that
synchronized vblank can be set to false.
