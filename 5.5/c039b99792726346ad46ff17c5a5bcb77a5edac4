iomap: use a srcmap for a read-modify-write I/O

The srcmap is used to identify where the read is to be performed from.
It is passed to ->iomap_begin, which can fill it in if we need to read
data for partially written blocks from a different location than the
write target.  The srcmap is only supported for buffered writes so far.

[hch: merged two patches, removed the IOMAP_F_COW flag, use iomap as
      srcmap if not set, adjust length down to srcmap end as well]
