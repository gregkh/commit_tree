drm/i915/execlists: Cancel banned contexts on schedule-out

On schedule-out (CS completion) of a banned context, scrub the context
image so that we do not replay the active payload. The intent is that we
skip banned payloads on request submission so that the timeline
advancement continues on in the background. However, if we are returning
to a preempted request, i915_request_skip() is ineffective and instead we
need to patch up the context image so that it continues from the start
of the next request.

v2: Fixup cancellation so that we only scrub the payload of the active
request and do not short-circuit the breadcrumbs (which might cause
other contexts to execute out of order).
v3: Grammar pass
