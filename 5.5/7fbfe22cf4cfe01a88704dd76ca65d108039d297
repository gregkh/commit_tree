perf trace: Filter own pid to avoid a feedback look in 'perf trace record -a'

When doing a system wide 'perf trace record' we need, just like in 'perf
trace' live mode, to filter out perf trace's own pid, so set up a
tracepoint filter for the raw_syscalls tracepoints right after adding
them to the argv array that is set up to then call cmd_record().
