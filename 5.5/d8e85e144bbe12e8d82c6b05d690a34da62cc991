arm64: Kconfig: add a choice for endianness

When building allmodconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=$(pwd)/arch/arm64/configs/defconfig
CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN gets enabled. Which tends not to be what most
people want. Another concern that has come up is that ACPI isn't built
for an allmodconfig kernel today since that also depends on !CPU_BIG_ENDIAN.

Rework so that we introduce a 'choice' and default the choice to
CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN. That means that when we build an allmodconfig kernel
it will default to CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN that most people tends to want.
