seccomp: rework define for SECCOMP_USER_NOTIF_FLAG_CONTINUE

Switch from BIT(0) to (1UL << 0).
First, there are already two different forms used in the header, so there's
no need to add a third. Second, the BIT() macros is kernel internal and
afaict not actually exposed to userspace. Maybe there's some magic there
I'm missing but it definitely causes issues when compiling a program that
tries to use SECCOMP_USER_NOTIF_FLAG_CONTINUE. It currently fails in the
following way:

	# github.com/lxc/lxd/lxd
	/usr/bin/ld: $WORK/b001/_x003.o: in function
	`__do_user_notification_continue':
	lxd/main_checkfeature.go:240: undefined reference to `BIT'
	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Switching to (1UL << 0) should prevent that and is more in line what is
already done in the rest of the header.
