ARM: dts: Probe am335x musb with ti-sysc

We can now probe musb with ti-sysc interconnect driver and dts data
with the following changes:

1. Swap the old ti,am33xx-usb compatible wrapper to generic ti-sysc
   driver. This means later on we can also remove the old wrapper driver
   drivers/usb/musb/musb_am335x.c

2. Update the child nodes to use the ranges provided by ti-sysc

3. Drop unneeded status = "enabled" tinkering for SoC internal devices.
   This allows us to remove some useless board specific boilerplate code
   in the following patches
