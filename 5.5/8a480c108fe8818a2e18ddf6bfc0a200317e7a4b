platform/x86: huawei-wmi: Add quirks and module parameters

Introduce quirks and module parameters. 3 quirks are added:
1. Fixes reporting brightness keys twice since it's already handled by
   acpi-video.
2. Some models need a short delay when setting battery thresholds to
   prevent a race condition when two processes read/write. (will be used later)
3. Matebook X (2017) handles micmute led through the "legacy" interface
   which is not currently implemented. Use ACPI EC method to control
   this led. (will be used later)

2 module parameters are added to enable this short delay and/or report
  brightness keys through this driver.
