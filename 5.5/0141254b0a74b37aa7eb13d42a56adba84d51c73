ALSA: usb-audio: fix set_format altsetting sanity check

Make sure to check the return value of usb_altnum_to_altsetting() to
avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer when the requested alternate settings
is missing.

The format altsetting number may come from a quirk table and there does
not seem to be any other validation of it (the corresponding index is
checked however).
