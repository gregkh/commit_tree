irqchip/qcom-pdc: Add irqdomain for wakeup capable GPIOs

Introduce a new domain for wakeup capable GPIOs. The domain can be
requested using the bus token DOMAIN_BUS_WAKEUP. In the following
patches, we will specify PDC as the wakeup-parent for the TLMM GPIO
irqchip. Requesting a wakeup GPIO will setup the GPIO and the
corresponding PDC interrupt as its parent.
