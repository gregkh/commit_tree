drivers/perf: hisi: update the sccl_id/ccl_id for certain HiSilicon platform

For some HiSilicon platform, the originally designed SCCL_ID and CCL_ID
are not satisfied with much rich topology when the MT is set, so we
extend the SCCL_ID to MPIDR[aff3] and CCL_ID to MPIDR[aff2]. Let's
update this for HiSilicon uncore PMU driver.
