qtnfmac: send EAPOL frames via control path

Send EAPOL frames via control path so they can be treated in a different
way rather than normal data frames. In this case EAPOLs are sent with
higher priority and with disabled aggregation and encryption. Besides,
all devices benefit from sending EAPOL frames via high priority path,
so move the functionality from chip specific to common code.
