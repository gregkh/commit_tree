arm64: tegra: Fix 'active-low' warning for Jetson Xavier regulator

Commit 4fdbfd60a3a2 ("arm64: tegra: Add PCIe slot supply information
in p2972-0000 platform") added regulators for the PCIe slot on the
Jetson Xavier platform. One of these regulators has an active-low enable
and this commit incorrectly added an active-low specifier for the GPIO
which causes the following warning to occur on boot ...

 WARNING KERN regulator@3 GPIO handle specifies active low - ignored

The fixed-regulator binding does not use the active-low flag from the
gpio specifier and purely relies of the presence of the
'enable-active-high' property to determine if it is active high or low
(if this property is omitted). Fix this warning by setting the GPIO
to active-high in the GPIO specifier. Finally, remove the
'enable-active-low' as this is not a valid property.
