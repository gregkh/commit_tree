drm/amdgpu: Avoid HW GPU reset for RAS.

Problem:
Under certain conditions, when some IP bocks take a RAS error,
we can get into a situation where a GPU reset is not possible
due to issues in RAS in SMU/PSP.

Temporary fix until proper solution in PSP/SMU is ready:
When uncorrectable error happens the DF will unconditionally
broadcast error event packets to all its clients/slave upon
receiving fatal error event and freeze all its outbound queues,
err_event_athub interrupt  will be triggered.
In such case and we use this interrupt
to issue GPU reset. THe GPU reset code is modified for such case to avoid HW
reset, only stops schedulers, deatches all in progress and not yet scheduled
job's fences, set error code on them and signals.
Also reject any new incoming job submissions from user space.
All this is done to notify the applications of the problem.

v2:
Extract amdgpu_amdkfd_pre/post_reset from amdgpu_device_lock/unlock_adev
Move amdgpu_job_stop_all_jobs_on_sched to amdgpu_job.c
Remove print param from amdgpu_ras_query_error_count

v3:
Update based on prevoius bug fixing patch to properly call amdgpu_amdkfd_pre_reset
for other XGMI hive memebers.
