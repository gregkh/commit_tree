regulator: s5m8767: switch to using devm_fwnode_gpiod_get

devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node() is being retired in favor of
devm_fwnode_gpiod_get_index(), that behaves similar to
devm_gpiod_get_index(), but can work with arbitrary firmware node. It
will also be able to support secondary software nodes.

Let's switch this driver over.
