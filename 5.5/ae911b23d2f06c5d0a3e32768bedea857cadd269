drm/i915/execlists: Relax assertion for a pinned context image on reset

A gpu hang can occur at any time, given a sufficiently angry gpu. An
example is when it forgets to perform a context-switch at the end of a
request, leaving us with a hanging GPU on a completed request. Here, we
may retire the request, only leaving its context alive via the active
barrier. When we reset the GPU on a completed request, we do not modify
its context image (just updating the ring state) and can safely defer
the assertion that we have the image pinned and ready to modify.
