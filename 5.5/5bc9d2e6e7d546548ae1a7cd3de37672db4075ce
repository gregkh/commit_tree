net: mscc: ocelot: move invariant configs out of adjust_link

It doesn't make sense to rewrite all these registers every time the PHY
library notifies us about a link state change.

In a future patch we will customize the MTU for the CPU port, and since
the MTU was previously configured from adjust_link, if we don't make
this change, its value would have got overridden.
