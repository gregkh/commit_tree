MIPS: Loongson: Add Loongson-3A R4 basic support

All Loongson-3 CPU family:

Code-name         Brand-name       PRId
Loongson-3A R1    Loongson-3A1000  0x6305
Loongson-3A R2    Loongson-3A2000  0x6308
Loongson-3A R2.1  Loongson-3A2000  0x630c
Loongson-3A R3    Loongson-3A3000  0x6309
Loongson-3A R3.1  Loongson-3A3000  0x630d
Loongson-3A R4    Loongson-3A4000  0xc000
Loongson-3B R1    Loongson-3B1000  0x6306
Loongson-3B R2    Loongson-3B1500  0x6307

Features of R4 revision of Loongson-3A:

  - All R2/R3 features, including SFB, V-Cache, FTLB, RIXI, DSP, etc.
  - Support variable ASID bits.
  - Support MSA and VZ extensions.
  - Support CPUCFG (CPU config) and CSR (Control and Status Register)
      extensions.
  - 64 entries of VTLB (classic TLB), 2048 entries of FTLB (8-way
      set-associative).

Now 64-bit Loongson processors has three types of PRID.IMP: 0x6300 is
the classic one so we call it PRID_IMP_LOONGSON_64C (e.g., Loongson-2E/
2F/3A1000/3B1000/3B1500/3A2000/3A3000), 0x6100 is for some processors
which has reduced capabilities so we call it PRID_IMP_LOONGSON_64R
(e.g., Loongson-2K), 0xc000 is supposed to cover all new processors in
general (e.g., Loongson-3A4000+) so we call it PRID_IMP_LOONGSON_64G.
