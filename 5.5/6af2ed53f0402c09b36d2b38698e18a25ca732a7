cpupower: mperf_monitor: Update cpupower to use the RDPRU instruction

AMD Zen 2 introduces the RDPRU instruction which can be used to access some
processor registers which are typically only accessible in privilege level
0. ECX specifies the register to read and EDX:EAX will contain the value read.

ECX: 0 - Register MPERF
     1 - Register APERF

This has the added advantage of not having to use the msr module, since the
userspace to kernel transitions which occur during each read_msr() might
cause APERF and MPERF to go out of sync.
