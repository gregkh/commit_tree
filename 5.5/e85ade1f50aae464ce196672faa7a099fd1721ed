drm/i915: Hold reference to intel_frontbuffer as we track activity

Since obj->frontbuffer is no longer protected by the struct_mutex, as we
are processing the execbuf, it may be removed. Mark the
intel_frontbuffer as rcu protected, and so acquire a reference to
the struct as we track activity upon it.
