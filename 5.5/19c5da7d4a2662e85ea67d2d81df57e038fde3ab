crypto: virtio - deal with unsupported input sizes

Return -EINVAL for input sizes that are not a multiple of the AES
block size, since they are not supported by our CBC chaining mode.

While at it, remove the pr_err() that reports unsupported key sizes
being used: we shouldn't spam the kernel log with that.
