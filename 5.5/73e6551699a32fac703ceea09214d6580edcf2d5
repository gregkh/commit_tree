net/mlx5e: Query global pause state before setting prio2buffer

When the user changes prio2buffer mapping while global pause is
enabled, mlx5 driver incorrectly sets all active buffers
(buffer that has at least one priority mapped) to lossy.

Solution:
If global pause is enabled, set all the active buffers to lossless
in prio2buffer command.
Also, add error message when buffer size is not enough to meet
xoff threshold.
