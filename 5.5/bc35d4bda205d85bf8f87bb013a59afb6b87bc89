scripts/nsdeps: support nsdeps for external module builds

scripts/nsdeps is written to take care of only in-tree modules.
Perhaps, this is not a bug, but just a design. At least,
Documentation/core-api/symbol-namespaces.rst focuses on in-tree modules.

Having said that, some people already tried nsdeps for external modules.
So, it would be nice to support it.
