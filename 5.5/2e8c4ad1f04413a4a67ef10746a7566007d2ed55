soundwire: ignore uniqueID when irrelevant

The uniqueID is useful when there are two or more devices of the same
type (identical manufacturer ID, part ID) on the same link.

When there is a single device of a given type on a link, its uniqueID
is irrelevant. It's not uncommon on actual platforms to see variations
of the uniqueID, or differences between devID registers and ACPI _ADR
fields.

This patch suggests a filter on startup to identify 'single' devices
and tag them accordingly. The uniqueID is then not used for the probe,
and the device name omits the uniqueID as well.
