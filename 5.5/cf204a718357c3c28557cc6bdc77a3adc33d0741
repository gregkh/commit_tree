bpf, testing: Introduce 'gso_linear_no_head_frag' skb_segment test

Following reports of skb_segment() hitting a BUG_ON when working on
GROed skbs which have their gso_size mangled (e.g. after a
bpf_skb_change_proto call), add a reproducer test that mimics the
input skbs that lead to the mentioned BUG_ON as in [1] and validates the
fix submitted in [2].
