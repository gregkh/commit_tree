perf record: Add aux-sample-size config term

To allow individual events to be selected for AUX area sampling, add
aux-sample-size config term. attr.aux_sample_size is updated by
auxtrace_parse_sample_options() so that the existing validation will see
the value. Any event that has a non-zero aux_sample_size will cause AUX
area sampling to be configured, irrespective of the --aux-sample option.
