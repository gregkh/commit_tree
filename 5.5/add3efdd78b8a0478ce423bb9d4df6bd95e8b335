jbd2: Fix possible overflow in jbd2_log_space_left()

When number of free space in the journal is very low, the arithmetic in
jbd2_log_space_left() could underflow resulting in very high number of
free blocks and thus triggering assertion failure in transaction commit
code complaining there's not enough space in the journal:

J_ASSERT(journal->j_free > 1);

Properly check for the low number of free blocks.
