perf/imx_ddr: Add enhanced AXI ID filter support

With DDR_CAP_AXI_ID_FILTER quirk, indicating HW supports AXI ID filter
which only can get bursts from DDR transaction, i.e. DDR read/write
requests.

This patch add DDR_CAP_AXI_ID_ENHANCED_FILTER quirk, indicating HW
supports AXI ID filter which can get bursts and bytes from DDR
transaction at the same time. We hope PMU always return bytes in the
driver due to it is more meaningful for users.
