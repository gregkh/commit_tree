EDAC/amd64: Save max number of controllers to family type

The maximum number of memory controllers is fixed within a family/model
group. In most cases, this has been fixed at 2, but some systems may
have up to 8.

The struct amd64_family_type already contains family/model-specific
information, and this can be used rather than adding model checks to
various functions.

Create a new field in struct amd64_family_type for max_mcs.
Set this when setting other family type information, and use this when
needing the maximum number of memory controllers possible for a system.
