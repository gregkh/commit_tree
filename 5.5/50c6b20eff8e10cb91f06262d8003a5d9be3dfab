net/smc: fix final cleanup sequence for SMCD devices

If peer announces shutdown, use the link group terminate worker for
local cleanup of link groups and connections to terminate link group
in proper context.

Make sure link groups are cleaned up first before destroying the
event queue of the SMCD device, because link group cleanup may
raise events.

Send signal shutdown only if peer has not done it already.

Send socket abort or close only, if peer has not already announced
shutdown.
