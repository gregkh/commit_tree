xtensa: mm: fix PMD folding implementation

There was a definition of pmd_offset() in arch/xtensa/include/asm/pgtable.h
that shadowed the generic implementation defined in
include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopmd.h.

As the result, xtensa had shortcuts in page table traversal in several
places instead of doing level unfolding.

Remove local override for pmd_offset() and add page table unfolding where
necessary.
