openvswitch: support asymmetric conntrack

The openvswitch module shares a common conntrack and NAT infrastructure
exposed via netfilter.  It's possible that a packet needs both SNAT and
DNAT manipulation, due to e.g. tuple collision.  Netfilter can support
this because it runs through the NAT table twice - once on ingress and
again after egress.  The openvswitch module doesn't have such capability.

Like netfilter hook infrastructure, we should run through NAT twice to
keep the symmetry.
