   DC3CO enable bit will be used by driver to make DC3CO
   ready for DMC f/w and status bit will be used as DC3CO
   entry status.
2. Transcoder EXITLINE register and its bit fields and mask.
   Transcoder EXITLINE enable bit represents PSR2 idle frame
   reset should be applied at exit line and exitlines mask

v1: Use of REG_BIT and using extra space for EXITLINE_ macro
    definition. [Animesh]
