x86/doublefault/32: Rewrite the x86_32 #DF handler and unify with 64-bit

The old x86_32 doublefault_fn() was old and crufty, and it did not
even try to recover.  do_double_fault() is much nicer.  Rewrite the
32-bit double fault code to sanitize CPU state and call
do_double_fault().  This is mostly an exercise i386 archaeology.

With this patch applied, 32-bit double faults get a real stack trace,
just like 64-bit double faults.

[ mingo: merged the patch to a later kernel base. ]
