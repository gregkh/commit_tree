bus: ti-sysc: Fix missing force mstandby quirk handling

Commit 03856e928b0e ("bus: ti-sysc: Handle mstandby quirk and use it for
musb") added quirk handling for mstandby quirk but did not consider that
we also need a quirk variant for SYSC_QUIRK_FORCE_MSTANDBY.

We need to use forced idle mode for both SYSC_QUIRK_SWSUP_MSTANDBY and
SYSC_QUIRK_FORCE_MSTANDBY, but SYSC_QUIRK_SWSUP_MSTANDBY also need to
additionally also configure no-idle mode when enabled.
