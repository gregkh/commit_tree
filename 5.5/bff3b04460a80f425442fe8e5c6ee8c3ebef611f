arm64: mm: reserve CMA and crashkernel in ZONE_DMA32

With the introduction of ZONE_DMA in arm64 we moved the default CMA and
crashkernel reservation into that area. This caused a regression on big
machines that need big CMA and crashkernel reservations. Note that
ZONE_DMA is only 1GB big.

Restore the previous behavior as the wide majority of devices are OK
with reserving these in ZONE_DMA32. The ones that need them in ZONE_DMA
will configure it explicitly.
