mm/thp: flush file for !is_shmem PageDirty() case in collapse_file()

For non-shmem file THPs, khugepaged only collapses read only .text
mapping (VM_DENYWRITE).  These pages should not be dirty except the case
where the file hasn't been flushed since first write.

Call filemap_flush() in collapse_file() to accelerate the write back in
such cases.
