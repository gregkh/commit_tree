powerpc: support KASAN instrumentation of bitops

The powerpc-specific bitops are not being picked up by the KASAN
test suite.

Instrumentation is done via the bitops/instrumented-{atomic,lock}.h
headers. They require that arch-specific versions of bitop functions
are renamed to arch_*. Do this renaming.

For clear_bit_unlock_is_negative_byte, the current implementation
uses the PG_waiters constant. This works because it's a preprocessor
macro - so it's only actually evaluated in contexts where PG_waiters
is defined. With instrumentation however, it becomes a static inline
function, and all of a sudden we need the actual value of PG_waiters.
Because of the order of header includes, it's not available and we
fail to compile. Instead, manually specify that we care about bit 7.
This is still correct: bit 7 is the bit that would mark a negative
byte.

While we're at it, replace __inline__ with inline across the file.
