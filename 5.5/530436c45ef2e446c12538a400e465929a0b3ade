nvme: Discard workaround for non-conformant devices

Users observe IOMMU related errors when performing discard on nvme from
non-compliant nvme devices reading beyond the end of the DMA mapped
ranges to discard.

Two different variants of this behavior have been observed: SM22XX
controllers round up the read size to a multiple of 512 bytes, and Phison
E12 unconditionally reads the maximum discard size allowed by the spec
(256 segments or 4kB).

Make nvme_setup_discard unconditionally allocate the maximum DSM buffer
so the driver DMA maps a memory range that will always succeed.
