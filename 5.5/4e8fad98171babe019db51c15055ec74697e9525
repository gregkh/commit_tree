omap: pdata-quirks: revert pandora specific gpiod additions

This partly reverts the commit efdfeb079cc3 ("regulator: fixed: Convert to
use GPIO descriptor only").

We must remove this from mainline first, so that the following patch
to remove the openpandora quirks for mmc3 and wl1251 cleanly applies
to stable v4.9, v4.14, v4.19 where the above mentioned patch is not yet
present.

Since the code affected is removed (no pandora gpios in pdata-quirks
and more), there will be no matching revert-of-the-revert.
