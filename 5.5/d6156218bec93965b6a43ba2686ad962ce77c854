btrfs: make locking assertion helpers static inline

I've noticed that none of the btrfs_assert_*lock* debugging helpers is
inlined, despite they're short and mostly a value update. Making them
inline shaves 67 from the text size, reduces stack consumption and
perhaps also slightly improves the performance due to avoiding
unnecessary calls.
