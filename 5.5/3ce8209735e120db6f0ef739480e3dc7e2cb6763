drm/i915/hdcp: Nuke intel_hdcp_transcoder_config()

intel_hdcp_transcoder_config() is clobbering some globally visible
state in .compute_config(). That is a big no no as .compute_config()
is supposed to have no visible side effects when either the commit
fails or it's just a TEST_ONLY commit.

Inline this stuff into intel_hdcp_enable() so that the state only
gets modified when we actually commit the state to the hardware.
