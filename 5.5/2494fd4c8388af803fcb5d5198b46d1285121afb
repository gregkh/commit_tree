fbtft: Drop useless #ifdef CONFIG_OF and dead code

First of all there is no need to guard GPIO request by CONFIG_OF.
It works for everybody independently on resource provider. While here,
rename the function to reflect the above.

Moreover, since we have a global dependency to OF, the rest of
conditional compilation is no-op, i.e. it's always be true.

Due to above drop useless #ifdef CONFIG_OF and therefore dead code.
