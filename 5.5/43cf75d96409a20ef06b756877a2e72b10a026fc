exit: panic before exit_mm() on global init exit

Currently, when global init and all threads in its thread-group have exited
we panic via:
do_exit()
-> exit_notify()
   -> forget_original_parent()
      -> find_child_reaper()
This makes it hard to extract a useable coredump for global init from a
kernel crashdump because by the time we panic exit_mm() will have already
released global init's mm.
This patch moves the panic futher up before exit_mm() is called. As was the
case previously, we only panic when global init and all its threads in the
thread-group have exited.
