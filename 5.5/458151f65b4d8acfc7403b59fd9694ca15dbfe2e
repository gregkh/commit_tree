KVM: nVMX: Use kvm_set_msr to load IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL on VM-Exit

The existing implementation for loading the IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL MSR
on VM-exit was incorrect, as the next call to atomic_switch_perf_msrs()
could cause this value to be overwritten. Instead, call kvm_set_msr()
which will allow atomic_switch_perf_msrs() to correctly set the values.

Define a macro, SET_MSR_OR_WARN(), to set the MSR with kvm_set_msr()
and WARN on failure.
