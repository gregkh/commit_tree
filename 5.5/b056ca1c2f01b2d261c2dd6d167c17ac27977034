gpiolib: Introduce ->add_pin_ranges() callback

When IRQ chip is being added by GPIO library, the ACPI based platform expects
GPIO <-> pin mapping ranges to be initialized in order to correctly initialize
ACPI event mechanism on affected platforms. Unfortunately this step is missed.

Introduce ->add_pin_ranges() callback to fill the above mentioned gap.
