mm: vmscan: memcontrol: remove mem_cgroup_select_victim_node()

Since commit 1ba6fc9af35b ("mm: vmscan: do not share cgroup iteration
between reclaimers"), the memcg reclaim does not bail out earlier based
on sc->nr_reclaimed and will traverse all the nodes.  All the
reclaimable pages of the memcg on all the nodes will be scanned relative
to the reclaim priority.  So, there is no need to maintain state
regarding which node to start the memcg reclaim from.

This patch effectively reverts the commit 889976dbcb12 ("memcg: reclaim
memory from nodes in round-robin order") and commit 453a9bf347f1
("memcg: fix numa scan information update to be triggered by memory
event").
