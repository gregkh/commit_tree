kernel-hacking: group sysrq/kgdb/ubsan into 'Generic Kernel Debugging Instruments'

Patch series "hacking: make 'kernel hacking' menu better structurized", v3.

This series is a trivial improvment for the layout of 'kernel hacking'
configuration menu.  Now we have many items in it which makes takes a
little time to look up them since they are not well structurized yet.

Early discussion is here:

This patch (of 9):

Group generic kernel debugging instruments sysrq/kgdb/ubsan together
into a new submenu.
