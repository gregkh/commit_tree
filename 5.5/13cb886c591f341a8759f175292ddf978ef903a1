xprtrdma: Fix completion wait during device removal

I've found that on occasion, "rmmod <dev>" will hang while if an NFS
is under load.

Ensure that ri_remove_done is initialized only just before the
transport is woken up to force a close. This avoids the completion
possibly getting initialized again while the CM event handler is
waiting for a wake-up.
