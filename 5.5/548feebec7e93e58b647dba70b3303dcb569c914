ext4: update direct I/O read lock pattern for IOCB_NOWAIT

This patch updates the lock pattern in ext4_direct_IO_read() to not
block on inode lock in cases of IOCB_NOWAIT direct I/O reads. The
locking condition implemented here is similar to that of 942491c9e6d6
("xfs: fix AIM7 regression").

Fixes: 16c54688592c ("ext4: Allow parallel DIO reads")
