io_uring: io_allocate_scq_urings() should return a sane state

We currently rely on the ring destroy on cleaning things up in case of
failure, but io_allocate_scq_urings() can leave things half initialized
if only parts of it fails.

Be nice and return with either everything setup in success, or return an
error with things nicely cleaned up.
