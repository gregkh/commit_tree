ARM: dts: logicpd-torpedo: Remove unnecessary notes/comments

There used to be a bug in the video driver that caused the timings
for the LCD to calculate in a way on the DM3730 which made it hang.

The work around for this bug was to set
CONFIG_OMAP2_DSS_MIN_FCK_PER_PCK=4 in the kernel.  This work around
is no longer needed as the video drivers have been corrected.

This patch removes the legacy note.
