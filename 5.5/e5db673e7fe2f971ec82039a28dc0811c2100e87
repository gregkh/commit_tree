mmc: sdio: fix wl1251 vendor id

v4.11-rc1 did introduce a patch series that rearranged the
sdio quirks into a header file. Unfortunately this did forget
to handle SDIO_VENDOR_ID_TI differently between wl1251 and
wl1271 with the result that although the wl1251 was found on
the sdio bus, the firmware did not load any more and there was
no interface registration.

This patch defines separate constants to be used by sdio quirks
and drivers.
