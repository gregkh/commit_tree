dm thin: replace spin_lock_irqsave with spin_lock_irq

If we are in a place where it is known that interrupts are enabled,
functions spin_lock_irq/spin_unlock_irq should be used instead of
spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_irqrestore.

spin_lock_irq and spin_unlock_irq are faster because they don't need to
push and pop the flags register.
