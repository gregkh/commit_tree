psi: Fix a division error in psi poll()

The psi window size is a u64 an can be up to 10 seconds right now,
which exceeds the lower 32 bits of the variable. We currently use
div_u64 for it, which is meant only for 32-bit divisors. The result is
garbage pressure sampling values and even potential div0 crashes.

Use div64_u64.
