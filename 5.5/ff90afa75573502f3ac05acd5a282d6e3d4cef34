KVM: x86: Evaluate latched_init in KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS when vCPU not in SMM

Commit 4b9852f4f389 ("KVM: x86: Fix INIT signal handling in various CPU states")
fixed KVM to also latch pending LAPIC INIT event when vCPU is in VMX
operation.

However, current API of KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS defines this field as
part of SMM state and only set pending LAPIC INIT event if vCPU is
specified to be in SMM mode (events->smi.smm is set).

Change KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS handler to set pending LAPIC INIT event
by latched_init field regardless of if vCPU is in SMM mode or not.
