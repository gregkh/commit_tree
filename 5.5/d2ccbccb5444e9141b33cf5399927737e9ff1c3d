tracing: Define MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE when not defined without direct calls

In order to handle direct calls along side of function graph tracer, a check
is made to see if the address being traced by the function graph tracer is a
direct call or not. To get the address used by direct callers, the return
address is subtracted by MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE.

For some archs with certain configurations, MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE is undefined
here. But these should not be using direct calls anyway. Just define
MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE to zero in this case.
