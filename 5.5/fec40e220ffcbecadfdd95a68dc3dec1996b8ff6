xfs: refactor xfs_bmap_count_blocks using newer btree helpers

Currently, this function open-codes walking a bmbt to count the extents
and blocks in use by a particular inode fork.  Since we now have a
function to tally extent records from the incore extent tree and a btree
helper to count every block in a btree, replace all that with calls to
the helpers.
