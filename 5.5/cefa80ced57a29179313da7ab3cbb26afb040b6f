pipe: Increase the writer-wakeup threshold to reduce context-switch count

Increase the threshold at which the reader sends a wake event to the
writers in the queue such that the queue must be half empty before the wake
is issued rather than the wake being issued when just a single slot
available.

This reduces the number of context switches in the tests significantly,
without altering the amount of work achieved.  With my pipe-bench program,
there's a 20% reduction versus an unpatched kernel.
