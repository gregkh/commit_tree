arm64: ftrace: fix ifdeffery

When I tweaked the ftrace entry assembly in commit:

  3b23e4991fb66f6d ("arm64: implement ftrace with regs")

... my ifdeffery tweaks left ftrace_graph_caller undefined for
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE && CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER when ftrace is
based on mcount.

The kbuild test robot reported that this issue is detected at link time:

| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.o: In function `skip_ftrace_call':
| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:238: undefined reference to `ftrace_graph_caller'
| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:238:(.text+0x3c): relocation truncated to fit: R_AARCH64_CONDBR19 against undefined symbol
| `ftrace_graph_caller'
| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:243: undefined reference to `ftrace_graph_caller'
| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:243:(.text+0x54): relocation truncated to fit: R_AARCH64_CONDBR19 against undefined symbol
| `ftrace_graph_caller'

This patch fixes the ifdeffery so that the mcount version of
ftrace_graph_caller doesn't depend on CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE. At the same
time, a redundant #else is removed from the ifdeffery for the
patchable-function-entry version of ftrace_graph_caller.
