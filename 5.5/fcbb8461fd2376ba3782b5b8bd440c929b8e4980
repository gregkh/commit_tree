kbuild: remove header compile test

There are both positive and negative options about this feature.
At first, I thought it was a good idea, but actually Linus stated a
negative opinion (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/29/227). I admit it
is ugly and annoying.

The baseline I'd like to keep is the compile-test of uapi headers.
(Otherwise, kernel developers have no way to ensure the correctness
of the exported headers.)

I will maintain a small build rule in usr/include/Makefile.
Remove the other header test functionality.
