nvme-rdma: Avoid preallocating big SGL for data

nvme_rdma_alloc_tagset() preallocates a big buffer for the IO SGL based
on SG_CHUNK_SIZE.

Modern DMA engines are often capable of dealing with very big segments so
the SG_CHUNK_SIZE is often too big. SG_CHUNK_SIZE results in a static 4KB
SGL allocation per command.

If a controller has lots of deep queues, preallocation for the sg list can
consume substantial amounts of memory. For nvme-rdma, nr_hw_queues can be
128 and each queue's depth 128. This means the resulting preallocation
for the data SGL is 128*128*4K = 64MB per controller.

Switch to runtime allocation for SGL for lists longer than 2 entries. This
is the approach used by NVMe PCI so it should be reasonable for NVMeOF as
well. Runtime SGL allocation has always been the case for the legacy I/O
path so this is nothing new.

The preallocated small SGL depends on SG_CHAIN so if the ARCH doesn't
support SG_CHAIN, use only runtime allocation for the SGL.

We didn't notice of a performance degradation, since for small IOs we'll
use the inline SG and for the bigger IOs the allocation of a bigger SGL
from slab is fast enough.
