scripts/get_maintainer.pl: add signatures from Fixes: <badcommit> lines in commit message

A Fixes: lines in a commit message generally indicate that a previous
commit was inadequate for whatever reason.

The signers of the previous inadequate commit should also be cc'd on
this new commit so update get_maintainer to find the old commit and add
the original signers.
