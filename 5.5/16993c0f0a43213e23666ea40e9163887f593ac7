arm/efi: EFI soft reservation to memblock

UEFI 2.8 defines an EFI_MEMORY_SP attribute bit to augment the
interpretation of the EFI Memory Types as "reserved for a specific
purpose".

The proposed Linux behavior for specific purpose memory is that it is
reserved for direct-access (device-dax) by default and not available for
any kernel usage, not even as an OOM fallback.  Later, through udev
scripts or another init mechanism, these device-dax claimed ranges can
be reconfigured and hot-added to the available System-RAM with a unique
node identifier. This device-dax management scheme implements "soft" in
the "soft reserved" designation by allowing some or all of the
reservation to be recovered as typical memory. This policy can be
disabled at compile-time with CONFIG_EFI_SOFT_RESERVE=n, or runtime with
efi=nosoftreserve.

For this patch, update the ARM paths that consider
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY to optionally take the EFI_MEMORY_SP attribute
into account as a reservation indicator. Publish the soft reservation as
IORES_DESC_SOFT_RESERVED memory, similar to x86.
