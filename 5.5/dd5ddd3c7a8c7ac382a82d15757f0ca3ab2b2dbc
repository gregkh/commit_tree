iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Rename IOMMU_QCOM_SYS_CACHE and improve doc

The 'IOMMU_QCOM_SYS_CACHE' IOMMU protection flag is exposed to all
users of the IOMMU API. Despite its name, the idea behind it isn't
especially tied to Qualcomm implementations and could conceivably be
used by other systems.

Rename it to 'IOMMU_SYS_CACHE_ONLY' and update the comment to describe
a bit better the idea behind it.
