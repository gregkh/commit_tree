PM / devfreq: tegra30: Disable consecutive interrupts when appropriate

Consecutive interrupts should be disabled when boosting is completed.

Currently the disabling of "lower" interrupt happens only for MCCPU
monitor that uses dependency threshold, but even in a case of MCCPU the
interrupt isn't getting disabled if CPU's activity is above the threshold.
This results in a lot of dummy interrupt requests. The boosting feature is
used by both MCCPU and MCALL, boosting should be stopped once it reaches 0
for both of the monitors and regardless of the activity level.

The boosting stops to grow once the maximum limit is hit and thus the
"upper" interrupt needs to be disabled when the limit is reached.
