rtc: fsl-ftm-alarm: remove select FSL_RCPM and default y from Kconfig

The Flextimer alarm is primarily used as a wakeup source for system
power management.  But it shouldn't select the power management driver
as they don't really have dependency of each other.

Also remove the default y as it is not a critical feature for the
systems.
