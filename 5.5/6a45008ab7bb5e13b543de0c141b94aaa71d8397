drm/i915/perf: allow for CS OA configs to be created lazily

Here we introduce a mechanism by which the execbuf part of the i915
driver will be able to request that a batch buffer containing the
programming for a particular OA config be created.

We'll execute these OA configuration buffers right before executing a
set of userspace commands so that a particular user batchbuffer be
executed with a given OA configuration.

This mechanism essentially allows the userspace driver to go through
several OA configuration without having to open/close the i915/perf
stream.

v2: No need for locking on object OA config object creation (Chris)
    Flush cpu mapping of OA config (Chris)

v3: Properly deal with the perf_metric lock (Chris/Lionel)

v4: Fix oa config unref/put when not found (Lionel)

v5: Allocate BOs for configurations on the stream instead of globally
    (Lionel)

v6: Fix 64bit division (Chris)

v7: Store allocated config BOs into the stream (Lionel)
