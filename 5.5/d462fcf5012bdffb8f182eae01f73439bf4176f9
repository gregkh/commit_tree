drm/amd/display: Update hdcp display config

[Why]
We need to update the hdcp display parameter whenever the link is
updated, so the next time there is an update to hdcp we have the
latest display info

[How]
Create a callback, and use this anytime there is a change in the link. This will
be used later by the dm.
