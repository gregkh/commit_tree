scsi: storvsc: Correctly set number of hardware queues for IDE disk

Commit 0ed881027690 ("scsi: storvsc: setup 1:1 mapping between hardware
queue and CPU queue") introduced a regression for disks attached to
IDE. For these disks the host VSP only offers one VMBUS channel. Setting
multiple queues can overload the VMBUS channel and result in performance
drop for high queue depth workload on system with large number of CPUs.

Fix it by leaving the number of hardware queues to 1 (default value) for
IDE disks.
