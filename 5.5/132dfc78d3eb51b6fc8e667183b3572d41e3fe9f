drm/i915: Drop the IRQ-off asserts

The lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled() check is needless. The previous
lockdep_assert_held() check ensures that the lock is acquired and while
the lock is acquired lockdep also prints a warning if the interrupts are
not disabled if they have to be.
These IRQ-off asserts trigger on PREEMPT_RT because the locks become
sleeping locks and do not really disable interrupts.

Remove lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled().
