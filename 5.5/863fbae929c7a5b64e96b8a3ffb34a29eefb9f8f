nvme_fc: add module to ops template to allow module references

In nvme-fc: it's possible to have connected active controllers
and as no references are taken on the LLDD, the LLDD can be
unloaded.  The controller would enter a reconnect state and as
long as the LLDD resumed within the reconnect timeout, the
controller would resume.  But if a namespace on the controller
is the root device, allowing the driver to unload can be problematic.
To reload the driver, it may require new io to the boot device,
and as it's no longer connected we get into a catch-22 that
eventually fails, and the system locks up.

Fix this issue by taking a module reference for every connected
controller (which is what the core layer did to the transport
module). Reference is cleared when the controller is removed.
