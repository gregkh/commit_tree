riscv: separate MMIO functions into their own header file

Separate the low-level MMIO static inline functions and macros, such
as {read,write}{b,w,l,q}(), into their own header file under
arch/riscv/include: asm/mmio.h.  This is done to break a header
dependency chain that arises when both asm/pgtable.h and asm/io.h are
included by asm/timex.h.  Since the problem is related to the legacy
I/O port support in asm/io.h, this allows files under arch/riscv that
encounter those issues to simply include asm/mmio.h instead, and
bypass the legacy I/O port functions.  Existing users of asm/io.h
don't need to change anything, since asm/mmio.h is included by
asm/io.h.

While here, clean up some checkpatch.pl-related issues with the
original code.
