time: Optimize ns_to_timespec64()

ns_to_timespec64() calls div_s64_rem(), which is a rather slow function on
32-bit architectures, as it cannot take advantage of the do_div()
optimizations for constant arguments.

Open-code the div_s64_rem() function in ns_to_timespec64(), so a constant
divider can be passed into the optimized div_u64_rem() function.
