net: dsa: add ports list in the switch fabric

Add a list of switch ports within the switch fabric. This will help the
lookup of a port inside the whole fabric, and it is the first step
towards supporting multiple CPU ports, before deprecating the usage of
the unique dst->cpu_dp pointer.

In preparation for a future allocation of the dsa_port structures,
return -ENOMEM in case no structure is returned, even though this
error cannot be reached yet.
