btrfs: remove cached space_info in btrfs_statfs()

In btrfs_statfs() we cache fs_info::space_info in a local variable only
to use it once in a list_for_each_rcu() statement.

Not only is the local variable unnecessary it even makes the code harder
to follow as it's not clear which list it is iterating.
