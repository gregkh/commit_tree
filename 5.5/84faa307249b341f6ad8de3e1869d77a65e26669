crypto: arm/curve25519 - add arch-specific key generation function

Somehow this was forgotten when Zinc was being split into oddly shaped
pieces, resulting in linker errors. The x86_64 glue has a specific key
generation implementation, but the Arm one does not. However, it can
still receive the NEON speedups by calling the ordinary DH function
using the base point.
