ARM: omap2plus_defconfig: Update for moved item

When running make savedefconfig ARCH=arm, CONFIG_DMA_CMA
changed location.  To help facilitate future changes to
omap2plus_defconfig, this patch re-syncs the omap2plus file
with the updated location generated by make savedefconfig.

No items were removed or added during this patch.
