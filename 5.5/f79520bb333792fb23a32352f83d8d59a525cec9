drm/i915/selftests: Synchronize checking active status with retirement

If retirement is running on another thread, we may inspect the status of
the i915_active before its retirement callback is complete. As we expect
it to be running synchronously, we can wait for any callback to complete
by acquiring the i915_active.mutex.
