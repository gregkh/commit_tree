spi: gpio: Look for a device node instead of match

This driver doesn't do anything with the match for the device node. The
logic is the same as looking to see if a device node exists or not
because this driver wouldn't probe unless there is a device node match
when the device is created from DT. Just test for the presence of the
device node to simplify and avoid referencing a potentially undefined
match table when CONFIG_OF=n.
