net: mscc: ocelot: separate net_device related items out of ocelot_port

The ocelot and ocelot_port structures will be used by a new DSA driver,
so the ocelot_board.c file will have to allocate and work with a private
structure (ocelot_port_private), which embeds the generic struct
ocelot_port. This is because in DSA, at least one interface does not
have a net_device, and the DSA driver API does not interact with that
anyway.

The ocelot_port structure is equivalent to dsa_port, and ocelot to
dsa_switch. The members of ocelot_port which have an equivalent in
dsa_port (such as dp->vlan_filtering) have been moved to
ocelot_port_private.

We want to enforce the coding convention that "ocelot_port" refers to
the structure, and "port" refers to the integer index. One can retrieve
the structure at any time from ocelot->ports[port].

The patch is large but only contains variable renaming and mechanical
movement of fields from one structure to another.
