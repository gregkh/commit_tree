net: sched: extract common action counters update code into function

Currently, all implementations of tc_action_ops->stats_update() callback
have almost exactly the same implementation of counters update
code (besides gact which also updates drop counter). In order to simplify
support for using both percpu-allocated and regular action counters
depending on run-time flag in following patches, extract action counters
update code into standalone function in act API.

This commit doesn't change functionality.
