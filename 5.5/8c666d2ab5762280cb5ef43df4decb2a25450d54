selftests/livepatch: Test interaction with ftrace_enabled

Since livepatching depends upon ftrace handlers to implement "patched"
code functionality, verify that the ftrace_enabled sysctl value
interacts with livepatch registration as expected.  At the same time,
ensure that ftrace_enabled is set and part of the test environment
configuration that is saved and restored when running the selftests.
