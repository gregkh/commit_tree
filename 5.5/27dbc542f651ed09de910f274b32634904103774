PM / devfreq: Use PM QoS for sysfs min/max_freq

Switch the handling of min_freq and max_freq from sysfs to use the
dev_pm_qos_request interface.

Since PM QoS handles frequencies as kHz this change reduces the
precision of min_freq and max_freq. This shouldn't introduce problems
because frequencies which are not an integer number of kHz are likely
not an integer number of Hz either.

Try to ensure compatibility by rounding min values down and rounding
max values up.
