soc: samsung: Add Exynos Adaptive Supply Voltage driver

The Adaptive Supply Voltage (ASV) driver adjusts CPU cluster operating
points depending on exact revision of an SoC retrieved from the CHIPID
block or the OTP memory.  This allows for some power saving as for some
CPU clock frequencies we can lower CPU cluster's supply voltage comparing
to safe values common to all the SoC revisions.

This patch adds support for Exynos5422/5800 SoC, it is partially based
on code from https://github.com/hardkernel/linux repository,
branch odroidxu4-4.14.y, files: arch/arm/mach-exynos/exynos5422-asv.[ch].

Tested on Odroid XU3, XU4, XU3 Lite.
