x86/asm/suspend: Use SYM_DATA for data

Some global data in the suspend code were marked as `ENTRY'. ENTRY was
intended for functions and shall be paired with ENDPROC. ENTRY also
aligns symbols to 16 bytes which creates unnecessary holes.

Note that:

* saved_magic (long) in wakeup_32 is still prepended by section's ALIGN
* saved_magic (quad) in wakeup_64 follows a bunch of quads which are
  aligned (but need not be aligned to 16)

Since historical markings are being dropped, make proper use of newly
added SYM_DATA in this code.
