can: mscan: mscan_rx_poll(): fix rx path lockup when returning from polling to irq mode

Under load, the RX side of the mscan driver can get stuck while TX still
works. Restarting the interface locks up the system. This behaviour
could be reproduced reliably on a MPC5121e based system.

The patch fixes the return value of the NAPI polling function (should be
the number of processed packets, not constant 1) and the condition under
which IRQs are enabled again after polling is finished.

With this patch, no more lockups were observed over a test period of ten
days.
