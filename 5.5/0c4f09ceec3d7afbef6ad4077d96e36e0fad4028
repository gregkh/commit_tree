ALSA: timer: Fix the breakage of slave link open

A silly mistake was made while applying the fix for potential races in
commit 6a34367e52ca ("ALSA: timer: Fix possible race at assigning a
timer instance"): when a slave PCM is opened and succeeds, it doesn't
return but proceeds to the master timer open code instead.  Plug the
hole and beautify a bit.
