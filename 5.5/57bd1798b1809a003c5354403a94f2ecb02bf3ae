drm/i915/tgl/pll: Set update_active_dpll

Commit 24a7bfe0c2d7 ("drm/i915: Keep the TypeC port mode fixed when the
port is active") added this new hook while in parallel TGL upstream was
happening and this was missed.

Without this driver will crash when TC DDI is added and driver is
preparing to do a full modeset.
