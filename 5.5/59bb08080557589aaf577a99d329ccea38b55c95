ice: introduce frame padding computation logic

Take into account the underlying architecture specific settings and
based on that calculate the possible padding that can be supplied.
Typically, for x86 and standard MTU size we will end up with 192 bytes
of headroom. This is the same behavior as our other drivers have and we
can dedicate it for XDP purposes.

Furthermore, introduce the Rx ring flag for indicating whether build_skb
is used on particular. Based on that invoke the routines for padding
calculation.
