powerpc: Allow flush_icache_range to work across ranges >4GB

When calling flush_icache_range with a size >4GB, we were masking
off the upper 32 bits, so we would incorrectly flush a range smaller
than intended.

This patch replaces the 32 bit shifts with 64 bit ones, so that
the full size is accounted for.
