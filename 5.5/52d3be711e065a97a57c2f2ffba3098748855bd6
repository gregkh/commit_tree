i2c: stm32f7: rework slave_id allocation

The IP can handle two slave addresses. One address can either be
7 bits or 10 bits while the other can only be 7 bits.
In order to ensure that a 10 bits address can always be allocated
(assuming there is only one 7 bits address already allocated),
pick up the 7-bits only address slot in priority when performing a 7-bits
address allocation.
