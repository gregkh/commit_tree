mm, thp: tweak reclaim/compaction effort of local-only and all-node allocations

THP page faults now attempt a __GFP_THISNODE allocation first, which
should only compact existing free memory, followed by another attempt
that can allocate from any node using reclaim/compaction effort
specified by global defrag setting and madvise.

This patch makes the following changes to the scheme:

 - Before the patch, the first allocation relies on a check for
   pageblock order and __GFP_IO to prevent excessive reclaim. This
   however affects also the second attempt, which is not limited to
   single node.

   Instead of that, reuse the existing check for costly order
   __GFP_NORETRY allocations, and make sure the first THP attempt uses
   __GFP_NORETRY. As a side-effect, all costly order __GFP_NORETRY
   allocations will bail out if compaction needs reclaim, while
   previously they only bailed out when compaction was deferred due to
   previous failures.

   This should be still acceptable within the __GFP_NORETRY semantics.

 - Before the patch, the second allocation attempt (on all nodes) was
   passing __GFP_NORETRY. This is redundant as the check for pageblock
   order (discussed above) was stronger. It's also contrary to
   madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE) which means some effort to allocate THP is
   requested.

   After this patch, the second attempt doesn't pass __GFP_THISNODE nor
   __GFP_NORETRY.

To sum up, THP page faults now try the following attempts:

1. local node only THP allocation with no reclaim, just compaction.
2. for madvised VMA's or when synchronous compaction is enabled always - THP
   allocation from any node with effort determined by global defrag setting
   and VMA madvise
3. fallback to base pages on any node
