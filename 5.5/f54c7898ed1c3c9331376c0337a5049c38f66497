bpf: Fix precision tracking for unbounded scalars

Anatoly has been fuzzing with kBdysch harness and reported a hang in one
of the outcomes. Upon closer analysis, it turns out that precise scalar
value tracking is missing a few precision markings for unknown scalars:

  0: R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0
  0: (b7) r0 = 0
  1: R0_w=invP0 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0
  1: (35) if r0 >= 0xf72e goto pc+0
  --> only follow fallthrough
  2: R0_w=invP0 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0
  2: (35) if r0 >= 0x80fe0000 goto pc+0
  --> only follow fallthrough
  3: R0_w=invP0 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0
  3: (14) w0 -= -536870912
  4: R0_w=invP536870912 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0
  4: (0f) r1 += r0
  5: R0_w=invP536870912 R1_w=inv(id=0) R10=fp0
  5: (55) if r1 != 0x104c1500 goto pc+0
  --> push other branch for later analysis
  R0_w=invP536870912 R1_w=inv273421568 R10=fp0
  6: R0_w=invP536870912 R1_w=inv273421568 R10=fp0
  6: (b7) r0 = 0
  7: R0=invP0 R1=inv273421568 R10=fp0
  7: (76) if w1 s>= 0xffffff00 goto pc+3
  --> only follow goto
  11: R0=invP0 R1=inv273421568 R10=fp0
  11: (95) exit
  6: R0_w=invP536870912 R1_w=inv(id=0) R10=fp0
  6: (b7) r0 = 0

  7: safe
  processed 11 insns [...]

In the analysis of the second path coming after the successful exit above,
the path is being pruned at line 7. Pruning analysis found that both r0 are
precise P0 and both R1 are non-precise scalars and given prior path with
R1 as non-precise scalar succeeded, this one is therefore safe as well.

However, problem is that given condition at insn 7 in the first run, we only
followed goto and didn't push the other branch for later analysis, we've
never walked the few insns in there and therefore dead-code sanitation
rewrites it as goto pc-1, causing the hang depending on the skb address
hitting these conditions. The issue is that R1 should have been marked as
precise as well such that pruning enforces range check and conluded that new
R1 is not in range of old R1. In insn 4, we mark R1 (skb) as unknown scalar
via __mark_reg_unbounded() but not mark_reg_unbounded() and therefore
regs->precise remains as false.

Back in b5dc0163d8fd ("bpf: precise scalar_value tracking"), this was not
the case since marking out of __mark_reg_unbounded() had this covered as well.
Once in both are set as precise in 4 as they should have been, we conclude
that given R1 was in prior fall-through path 0x104c1500 and now is completely
unknown, the check at insn 7 concludes that we need to continue walking.
