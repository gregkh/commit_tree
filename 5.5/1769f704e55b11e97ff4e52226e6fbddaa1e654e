crypto: inside-secure - Add SM4 based authenc AEAD ciphersuites

This patch adds support for the authenc(hmac(sha1),cbc(sm4)),
authenc(hmac(sm3),cbc(sm4)), authenc(hmac(sha1),rfc3686(ctr(sm4))),
and authenc(hmac(sm3),rfc3686(ctr(sm4))) aead ciphersuites.
These are necessary to support IPsec according to the Chinese standard
GM/T 022-1014 - IPsec VPN specification.

Note that there are no testvectors present in testmgr for these
ciphersuites. However, considering all building blocks have already been
verified elsewhere, it is fair to assume the generic implementation to be
correct-by-construction.
The hardware implementation has been fuzzed against this generic
implementation by means of a locally modified testmgr. The intention is
to upstream these testmgr changes but this is pending other testmgr changes
being made by Eric Biggers.

The patch has been tested with the eip197c_iewxkbc configuration on the
Xilinx VCU118 development board, using the abovementioned modified testmgr

This patch applies on top of "Add support for SM4 ciphers" and needs to
be applied before "Add (HMAC) SHA3 support".
