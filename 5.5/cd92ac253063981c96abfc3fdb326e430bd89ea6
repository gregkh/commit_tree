s390/purgatory: Make sure we fail the build if purgatory has missing symbols

Since we link purgatory with -r aka we enable "incremental linking"
no checks for unresolved symbols are done while linking the purgatory.

This commit adds an extra check for unresolved symbols by calling ld
without -r before running objcopy to generate purgatory.ro.

This will help us catch missing symbols in the purgatory sooner.

Note this commit also removes --no-undefined from LDFLAGS_purgatory
as that has no effect.
