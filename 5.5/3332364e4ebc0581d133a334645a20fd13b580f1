iommu/amd: Support multiple PCI DMA aliases in device table

Non-Transparent Bridge (NTB) devices (among others) may have many DMA
aliases seeing the hardware will send requests with different device ids
depending on their origin across the bridged hardware.

See commit ad281ecf1c7d ("PCI: Add DMA alias quirk for Microsemi
Switchtec NTB") for more information on this.

The AMD IOMMU ignores all the PCI aliases except the last one so DMA
transfers from these aliases will be blocked on AMD hardware with the
IOMMU enabled.

To fix this, ensure the DTEs are cloned for every PCI alias. This is
done by copying the DTE data for each alias as well as the IVRS alias
every time it is changed.
