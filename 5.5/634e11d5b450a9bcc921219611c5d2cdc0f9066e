drivers: thermal: tsens: Add interrupt support

Depending on the IP version, TSENS supports upper, lower and critical
threshold interrupts. We only add support for upper and lower threshold
interrupts for now.

TSENSv2 has an irq [status|clear|mask] bit tuple for each sensor while
earlier versions only have a single bit per sensor to denote status and
clear. These differences are handled transparently by the interrupt
handler. At each interrupt, we reprogram the new upper and lower threshold
in the .set_trip callback.
