scsi: lpfc: Fix configuration of BB credit recovery in service parameters

The driver today is reading service parameters from the firmware and then
overwriting the firmware-provided values with values of its own.  There are
some switch features that require preliminary FLOGI's that are
switch-specific and done prior to the actual fabric FLOGI for traffic.  The
fw will perform those FLOGIs and will revise the service parameters for the
features configured. As the driver later overwrites those values with its
own values, it misconfigures things like BBSCN use by doing so.

Correct by eliminating the driver-overwrite of firmware values. The driver
correctly re-reads the service parameters after each link up to obtain the
latest values from firmware.
