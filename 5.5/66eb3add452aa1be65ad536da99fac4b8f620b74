SUNRPC: Avoid RPC delays when exiting suspend

Jon Hunter: "I have been tracking down another suspend/NFS related
issue where again I am seeing random delays exiting suspend. The delays
can be up to a couple minutes in the worst case and this is causing a
suspend test we have to fail."

Change the use of a deferrable work to a standard delayed one.
