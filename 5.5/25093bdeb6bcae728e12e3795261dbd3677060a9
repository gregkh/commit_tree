spi: implement SW control for CS times

This change implements CS control for setup, hold & inactive delays.

The `cs_setup` delay is completely new, and can help with cases where
asserting the CS, also brings the device out of power-sleep, where there
needs to be a longer (than usual), before transferring data.

The `cs_hold` time can overlap with the `delay` (or `delay_usecs`) from an
SPI transfer. The main difference is that `cs_hold` implies that CS will be
de-asserted.

The `cs_inactive` delay does not have a clear use-case yet. It has been
implemented mostly because the `spi_set_cs_timing()` function implements
it. To some degree, this could overlap or replace `cs_change_delay`, but
this will require more consideration/investigation in the future.

All these delays have been added to the `spi_controller` struct, as they
would typically be configured by calling `spi_set_cs_timing()` after an
`spi_setup()` call.

Software-mode for CS control, implies that the `set_cs_timing()` hook has
not been provided for the `spi_controller` object.
