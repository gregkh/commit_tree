btrfs: add member for a specific checksum driver

Currently all the checksum algorithms generate a fixed size digest size
and we use it.  The on-disk format can hold up to BTRFS_CSUM_SIZE bytes
and BLAKE2b produces digest of 512 bits by default. We can't do that and
will use the blake2b-256, this needs to be passed to the crypto API.

Separate that from the base algorithm name and add a member to request
specific driver, in this case with the digest size.

The only place that uses the driver name is the crypto API setup.
