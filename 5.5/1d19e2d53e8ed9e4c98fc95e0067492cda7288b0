hsr: fix error handling routine in hsr_dev_finalize()

hsr_dev_finalize() is called to create new hsr interface.
There are some wrong error handling codes.

1. wrong checking return value of debugfs_create_{dir/file}.
These function doesn't return NULL. If error occurs in there,
it returns error pointer.
So, it should check error pointer instead of NULL.

2. It doesn't unregister interface if it fails to setup hsr interface.
If it fails to initialize hsr interface after register_netdevice(),
it should call unregister_netdevice().

3. Ignore failure of creation of debugfs
If creating of debugfs dir and file is failed, creating hsr interface
will be failed. But debugfs doesn't affect actual logic of hsr module.
So, ignoring this is more correct and this behavior is more general.
