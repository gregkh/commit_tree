xen/balloon: fix ballooned page accounting without hotplug enabled

When CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG is not defined
reserve_additional_memory() will set balloon_stats.target_pages to a
wrong value in case there are still some ballooned pages allocated via
alloc_xenballooned_pages().

This will result in balloon_process() no longer be triggered when
ballooned pages are freed in batches.
