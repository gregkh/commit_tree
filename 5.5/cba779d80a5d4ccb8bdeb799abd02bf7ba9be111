arm64: mm: Fix column alignment for UXN in kernel_page_tables

UXN is the only individual PTE bit other than the PTE_ATTRINDX_MASK ones
which doesn't have both a set and a clear value provided, meaning that the
columns in the table won't all be aligned. The PTE_ATTRINDX_MASK values
are all both mutually exclusive and longer so are listed last to make a
single final column for those values. Ensure everything is aligned by
providing a clear value for UXN.
