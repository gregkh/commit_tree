ARM: 8911/1: move pcibios_report_status to <asm/pci.h>

Move the pcibios_report_status to <asm/pci.h> include to remove the
following sparse warning and to remove the extra definition in the
footbrdige dc21285.c driver:

arch/arm/kernel/bios32.c:59:6: warning: symbol 'pcibios_report_status' was not declared. Should it be static?
