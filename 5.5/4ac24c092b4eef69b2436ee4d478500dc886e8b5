s390: fix register clobbering in CALL_ON_STACK

CALL_ON_STACK defines and initializes register variables. Inline
assembly which follows might trigger compiler to generate memory access
for "stack" argument (e.g. in case of S390_lowcore.nodat_stack). This
memory access produces a function call under kasan with outline
instrumentation which clobbers registers.

Switch "stack" argument in CALL_ON_STACK helper to use memory reference
constraint and perform load instead.
