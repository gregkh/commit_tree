fs/nsfs.c: include headers for missing declarations

Include linux/proc_fs.h and fs/internal.h to address the following
'sparse' warnings:

    fs/nsfs.c:41:32: warning: symbol 'ns_dentry_operations' was not declared. Should it be static?
    fs/nsfs.c:145:5: warning: symbol 'open_related_ns' was not declared. Should it be static?
