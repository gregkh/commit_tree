netfilter: Support iif matches in POSTROUTING

Instead of generally passing NULL to NF_HOOK_COND() for input device,
pass skb->dev which contains input device for routed skbs.

Note that iptables (both legacy and nft) reject rules with input
interface match from being added to POSTROUTING chains, but nftables
allows this.
