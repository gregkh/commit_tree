io_wq: add get/put_work handlers to io_wq_create()

For cancellation, we need to ensure that the work item stays valid for
as long as ->cur_work is valid. Right now we can't safely dereference
the work item even under the wqe->lock, because while the ->cur_work
pointer will remain valid, the work could be completing and be freed
in parallel.

Only invoke ->get/put_work() on items we know that the caller queued
themselves. Add IO_WQ_WORK_INTERNAL for io-wq to use, which is needed
when we're queueing a flush item, for instance.
