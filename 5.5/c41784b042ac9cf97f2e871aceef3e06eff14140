drm: dw-hdmi-i2s: enable audio clock in audio_startup

In the designware databook, the sequence of enabling audio clock and
setting format is not clearly specified.
Currently, audio clock is enabled in the end of hw_param ops after
setting format.

On some monitors, there is a possibility that audio does not come out.
Fix this by enabling audio clock in audio_startup ops
before hw_param ops setting format.
