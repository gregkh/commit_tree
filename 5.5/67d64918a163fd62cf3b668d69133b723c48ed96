locking: locktorture: Do not include rwlock.h directly

Including rwlock.h directly will cause kernel builds to fail
if CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT is defined. The correct header file
(rwlock_rt.h OR rwlock.h) will be included by spinlock.h which
is included by locktorture.c anyway.

Remove the include of linux/rwlock.h.
