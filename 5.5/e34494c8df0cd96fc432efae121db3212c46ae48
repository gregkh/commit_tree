rtc: msm6242: Fix reading of 10-hour digit

The driver was reading the wrong register as the 10-hour digit due to
a misplaced ')'. It was in fact reading the 1-second digit register due
to this bug.

Also remove the use of a magic number for the hour mask and use the define
for it which was already present.
