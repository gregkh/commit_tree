staging: wfx: drop module version

wfx_version.h says that this code is same same than driver 2.3.1 hosted
on github:

    https://github.com/siliconlabs/wfx-linux-driver/tree/2.3.1-public

However, it is inaccurate, driver in-tree contains multiple small
patches ahead 2.3.1.

I prefer to drop this confusing information.
