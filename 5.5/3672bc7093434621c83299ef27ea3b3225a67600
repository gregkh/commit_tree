Revert "pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a77990: Fix MOD_SEL1 bit30 when using SSI_SCK2 and SSI_WS2"

This reverts commit e87882eb9be10b2b9e28156922c2a47d877f5db4.

According to the R-Car Gen3 Hardware Manual Errata for Rev 1.00 of Aug
24, 2018, the SEL_SSI2_{0,1} definition was to be deleted.  However,
this errata merely fixed an accidental double definition in the Hardware
User's Manual Rev. 1.00.  The real definition is still present in later
revisions of the manual (Rev. 1.50 and Rev. 2.00).

Hence revert the commit to recover the definition.

Based on a patch in the BSP by Takeshi Kihara
