xsk: Store struct xdp_sock as a flexible array member of the XSKMAP

Prior this commit, the array storing XDP socket instances were stored
in a separate allocated array of the XSKMAP. Now, we store the sockets
as a flexible array member in a similar fashion as the arraymap. Doing
so, we do less pointer chasing in the lookup.
