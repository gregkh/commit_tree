io_uring: fix pre-prepped issue with force_nonblock == true

Some of these code paths assume that any force_nonblock == true issue
is not prepped, but that's not true if we did prep as part of link setup
earlier. Check if we already have an async context allocate before
setting up a new one.

Cleanup the async context setup in general, we have a lot of duplicated
code there.
