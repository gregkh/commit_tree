autofs: don't bother with atomics for ino->count

All writers are serialized on inode->i_rwsem.  So are the readers
outside of expire.c.  And the readers in expire.c are in the
code that really doesn't care about narrow races - it's looking
for expiry candidates and its callers have to cope with the
possibility of a good candidate becoming busy right under them.

No point bothering with atomic operations - just use int and
mark the non-serialized readers with READ_ONCE().
