thunderbolt: Add default linking between lane adapters if not provided by DROM

We currently read how sibling lane adapter ports relate each other from
DROM (Device ROM). If the two lane adapter ports go through the same
physical connector these lanes can then be bonded together. However,
some cases DROM does not provide this information or it is missing
completely (host routers typically do not have DROM). In this case we
have hard-coded the relationship.

Expand this to work with both legacy devices where lane adapter ports 1
and 2, and 3 and 4 are always linked together, and with USB4 devices
where lane adapter 1 is always following lane adapter 0 or is disabled
completely (see USB4 section 5.2.1 for more information).
