ice: add helpers for virtchnl

The virtchannel interface was repeating a lot of strings
and wasting storage space in the kernel.  There was also
inconsistent messages for the same thing.  Consolidate all
those messages and bit checks into a couple of helper functions.

Also, reduce stack space usage by simplifying getting the pointer
to the pf using a helper.
