scsi: qla2xxx: Don't defer relogin unconditonally

qla2x00_configure_local_loop sets RELOGIN_NEEDED bit and calls
qla24xx_fcport_handle_login to perform the login. This bit triggers a wake
up of DPC later after a successful login.

The deferred call is not needed if login succeeds, and it's set in
qla24xx_fcport_handle_login in case of errors, hence it should be safe to
drop.
