block: set the zone size in blk_revalidate_disk_zones atomically

The current zone revalidation code has a major problem in that it
doesn't update the zone size and q->nr_zones atomically, leading
to a short window where an out of bounds access to the zone arrays
is possible.

To fix this move the setting of the zone size into the crticial
sections blk_revalidate_disk_zones so that it gets updated together
with the zone bitmaps and q->nr_zones.  This also slightly simplifies
the caller as it deducts the zone size from the report_zones.

This change also allows to check for a power of two zone size in generic
code.
