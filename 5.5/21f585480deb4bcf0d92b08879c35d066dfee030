fbtft: Make sure string is NULL terminated

New GCC warns about inappropriate use of strncpy():

drivers/staging/fbtft/fbtft-core.c: In function ‘fbtft_framebuffer_alloc’:
drivers/staging/fbtft/fbtft-core.c:665:2: warning: ‘strncpy’ specified bound 16 equals destination size [-Wstringop-truncation]
  665 |  strncpy(info->fix.id, dev->driver->name, 16);
      |  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Later on the copy is being used with the assumption to be NULL terminated.
Make sure string is NULL terminated by switching to snprintf().
