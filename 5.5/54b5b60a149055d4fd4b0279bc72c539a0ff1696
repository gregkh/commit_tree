compat_ioctl: remove HIDIO translation

The two drivers implementing these both gained proper compat_ioctl()
handlers a long time ago with commits bb6c8d8fa9b5 ("HID: hiddev:
Add 32bit ioctl compatibilty") and ae5e49c79c05 ("HID: hidraw: add
compatibility ioctl() for 32-bit applications."), so the lists in
fs/compat_ioctl.c are no longer used.

It appears that the lists were also incomplete, so the translation
didn't actually work correctly when it was still in use.

Remove them as cleanup.
