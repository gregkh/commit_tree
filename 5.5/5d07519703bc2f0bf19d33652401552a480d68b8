ASoC: soc-core: have legacy_dai_naming at snd_soc_register_dai()

ALSA SoC has 2 functions.
snd_soc_register_dai()  is used from topology
snd_soc_register_dais() is used from snd_soc_add_component()

In general, people think like _dai() is called from _dais()
with for loop. But in reality, these are very similar
but different implementation.
We shouldn't have duplicated and confusing implementation.

snd_soc_register_dai() is now used from topology.
But to reduce duplicated code, it should be used from _dais(), too.
To prepare it, this patch adds missing parameter legacy_dai_naming
to snd_soc_register_dai().
