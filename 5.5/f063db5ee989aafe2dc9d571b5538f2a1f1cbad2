ext4: split IOMAP_WRITE branch in ext4_iomap_begin() into helper

In preparation for porting across the ext4 direct I/O path over to the
iomap infrastructure, split up the IOMAP_WRITE branch that's currently
within ext4_iomap_begin() into a separate helper
ext4_alloc_iomap(). This way, when we add in the necessary code for
direct I/O, we don't end up with ext4_iomap_begin() becoming a
monstrous twisty maze.
