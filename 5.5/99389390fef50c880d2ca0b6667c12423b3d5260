drm/i915/tgl: Implement TGL DisplayPort training sequence

On TGL some registers moved from DDI to transcoder and the
DisplayPort training sequence has a separate BSpec page.

I started adding 'ifs' to the original intel_ddi_pre_enable_dp() but
it was becoming really hard to follow, so a new and cleaner function
for TGL was added with comments of all steps. It's similar to ICL,
but different enough to deserve a new function.

The rest of DisplayPort enable and the whole disable sequences
remained the same.

v2: FEC and DSC should be enabled on sink side before start link
training(Maarten reported and Manasi confirmed the DSC part)

v3: Add call to enable FEC on step 7.l(Manasi)

BSpec: 49190
