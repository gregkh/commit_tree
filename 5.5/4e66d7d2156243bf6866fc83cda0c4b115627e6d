drm/amdgpu: Add a kernel parameter for specifying the asic type

As more and more new asics start to reuse the old device IDs before
launch, there is a need to quickly override the existing asic type
corresponding to the reused device ID through a kernel parameter. With
this, engineers no longer need to rely on local hack patches,
facilitating cooperation across teams.
