bpf: Allow __sk_buff tstamp in BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN

It's useful for implementing EDT related tests (set tstamp, run the
test, see how the tstamp is changed or observe some other parameter).

Note that bpf_ktime_get_ns() helper is using monotonic clock, so for
the BPF programs that compare tstamp against it, tstamp should be
derived from clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...).
