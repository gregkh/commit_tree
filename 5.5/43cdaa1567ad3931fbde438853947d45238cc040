clk: imx8mm: Move 1443X/1416X PLL clock structure to common place

Many i.MX8M SoCs use same 1443X/1416X PLL, such as i.MX8MM,
i.MX8MN and later i.MX8M SoCs, moving these PLL definitions
to pll14xx driver can save a lot of duplicated code on each
platform.

Meanwhile, no need to define PLL clock structure for every
module which uses same type of PLL, e.g., audio/video/dram use
1443X PLL, arm/gpu/vpu/sys use 1416X PLL, define 2 PLL clock
structure for each group is enough.
