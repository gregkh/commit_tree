hugetlb: region_chg provides only cache entry

Current behavior is that region_chg provides both a cache entry in
resv->region_cache, AND a placeholder entry in resv->regions.
region_add first tries to use the placeholder, and if it finds that the
placeholder has been deleted by a racing region_del call, it uses the
cache entry.

This behavior is completely unnecessary and is removed in this patch for
a couple of reasons:

1. region_add needs to either find a cached file_region entry in
   resv->region_cache, or find an entry in resv->regions to expand. It
   does not need both.

2. region_chg adding a placeholder entry in resv->regions opens up
   a possible race with region_del, where region_chg adds a placeholder
   region in resv->regions, and this region is deleted by a racing call
   to region_del during region_chg execution or before region_add is
   called. Removing the race makes the code easier to reason about and
   maintain.

In addition, a follow up patch in another series that disables region
coalescing, which would be further complicated if the race with
region_del exists.
