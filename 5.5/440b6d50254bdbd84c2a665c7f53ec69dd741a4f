mtd: spi-nor: Fix selection of 4-byte addressing opcodes on Spansion

mtd->size is still unassigned when running spansion_post_sfdp_fixups()
hook, therefore use nor->params.size to determine the size of flash device.

This makes sure that 4-byte addressing opcodes are used on Spansion
flashes that are larger than 16MiB and don't have SFDP 4BAIT table
populated.
