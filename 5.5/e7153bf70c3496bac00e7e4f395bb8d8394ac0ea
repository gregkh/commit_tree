can: can_dropped_invalid_skb(): ensure an initialized headroom in outgoing CAN sk_buffs

KMSAN sysbot detected a read access to an untinitialized value in the
headroom of an outgoing CAN related sk_buff. When using CAN sockets this
area is filled appropriately - but when using a packet socket this
initialization is missing.

The problematic read access occurs in the CAN receive path which can
only be triggered when the sk_buff is sent through a (virtual) CAN
interface. So we check in the sending path whether we need to perform
the missing initializations.
