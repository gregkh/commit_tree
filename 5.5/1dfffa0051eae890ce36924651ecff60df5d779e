drm/i915: Don't disable interrupts independently of the lock

The locks (active.lock and rq->lock) need to be taken with disabled
interrupts. This is done in i915_request_retire() by disabling the
interrupts independently of the locks itself.
While local_irq_disable()+spin_lock() equals spin_lock_irq() on vanilla
it does not on PREEMPT_RT.
Chris Wilson confirmed that local_irq_disable() was just introduced as
an optimisation to avoid enabling/disabling interrupts during
lock/unlock combo.

Enable/disable interrupts as part of the locking instruction.
