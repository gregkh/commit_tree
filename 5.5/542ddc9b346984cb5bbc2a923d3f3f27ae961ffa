scsi: lpfc: revise nvme max queues to be hdwq count

Driver is setting the initiator nvme template with a max hw queues value of
the present cpu count which is odd. It should be registering the number of
hdwq queues (queues created on the adapter).

Change to set nvme tempate, in all cases, to the number of hardware queues.
