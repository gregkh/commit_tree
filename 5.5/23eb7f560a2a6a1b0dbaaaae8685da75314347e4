powerpc: Convert flush_icache_range & friends to C

Similar to commit 22e9c88d486a
("powerpc/64: reuse PPC32 static inline flush_dcache_range()")
this patch converts the following ASM symbols to C:
    flush_icache_range()
    __flush_dcache_icache()
    __flush_dcache_icache_phys()

This was done as we discovered a long-standing bug where the length of the
range was truncated due to using a 32 bit shift instead of a 64 bit one.

By converting these functions to C, it becomes easier to maintain.

flush_dcache_icache_phys() retains a critical assembler section as we must
ensure there are no memory accesses while the data MMU is disabled
(authored by Christophe Leroy). Since this has no external callers, it has
also been made static, allowing the compiler to inline it within
flush_dcache_icache_page().
