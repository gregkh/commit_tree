block: merge invalidate_partitions into rescan_partitions

A lot of the logic in invalidate_partitions and rescan_partitions is
shared.  Merge the two functions to simplify things.  There is a small
behavior change in that we now send the kevent change notice also if we
were not invalidating but no partitions were found, which seems like
the right thing to do.
