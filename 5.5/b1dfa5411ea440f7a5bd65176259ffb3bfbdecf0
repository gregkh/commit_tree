scsi: lpfc: Add log macros to allow print by serverity or verbosity setting

Add two new macros to aid in message logging:

Both macros print a message if the corresponding lpfc verbosity setting is
set or the kernel log level is WARNING or more critical.

One macro is for use with a phba structure, the other with a vport
structure.
