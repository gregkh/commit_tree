media: intel-ipu3: Align struct ipu3_uapi_awb_fr_config_s to 32 bytes

A struct that needs to be aligned to 32 bytes has a size of 28. Increase
the size to 32.

This makes elements of arrays of this struct aligned to 32 as well, and
other structs where members are aligned to 32 mixing
ipu3_uapi_awb_fr_config_s as well as other types.
