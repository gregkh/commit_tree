drm/amd/display: skip enable stream on disconnected display

[why]
Virtual signal means there is no display attached.
In this case we will assign a virtual signal type to the stream.
We should only enable the front end of the stream but not the back end.

[how]
When stream is enabling with virtual signal type, skip backend programming.
