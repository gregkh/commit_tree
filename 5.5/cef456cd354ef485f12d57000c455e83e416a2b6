Revert "Bluetooth: hci_ll: set operational frequency earlier"

As nice as it would be to update firmware faster, that patch broke
at least two different boards, an OMAP4+WL1285 based Motorola Droid
4, as reported by Sebasian Reichel and the Logic PD i.MX6Q +
WL1837MOD.

This reverts commit a2e02f38eff84f199c8e32359eb213f81f270047.
