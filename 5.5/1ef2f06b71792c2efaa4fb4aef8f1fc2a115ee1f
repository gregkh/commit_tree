powerpc/pseries/cmm: Convert loaned_pages to an atomic_long_t

When switching to balloon compaction, we want to drop the cmm_lock and
completely rely on the balloon compaction list lock internally.
loaned_pages is currently protected under the cmm_lock.

Note: Right now cmm_alloc_pages() and cmm_free_pages() can be called
at the same time, e.g., via the thread and a concurrent OOM notifier.
