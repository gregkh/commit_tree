ASoC: core: Init pcm runtime work early to avoid warnings

There are cases where we fail before we reach soc_new_pcm which would
init the workqueue. When we fail we attempt to flush the queue which
generates warnings from the workqueue subsystem when we have not inited
the queue. Solution is to use a proxy function to get around this issue.
