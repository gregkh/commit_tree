riscv: fix compile failure with EXPORT_SYMBOL() & !MMU

When support for !MMU was added, the declaration of
__asm_copy_to_user() & __asm_copy_from_user() were #ifdefed
out hence their EXPORT_SYMBOL() give an error message like:
  .../riscv_ksyms.c:13:15: error: '__asm_copy_to_user' undeclared here
  .../riscv_ksyms.c:14:15: error: '__asm_copy_from_user' undeclared here

Since these symbols are not defined with !MMU it's wrong to export them.
Same for __clear_user() (even though this one is also declared in
include/asm-generic/uaccess.h and thus doesn't give an error message).

Fix this by doing the EXPORT_SYMBOL() directly where these symbols
are defined: inside lib/uaccess.S itself.
