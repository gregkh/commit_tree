btrfs: return error pointer from alloc_test_extent_buffer

Callers of alloc_test_extent_buffer have not correctly interpreted the
return value as error pointer, as alloc_test_extent_buffer should behave
as alloc_extent_buffer. The self-tests were unaffected but
btrfs_find_create_tree_block could call both functions and that would
cause problems up in the call chain.
