net/mlx5e: Rx, Update page pool numa node when changed

Once every napi poll cycle, check if numa node is different than
the page pool's numa id, and update it using page_pool_update_nid().

Alternatively, we could have registered an irq affinity change handler,
but page_pool_update_nid() must be called from napi context anyways, so
the handler won't actually help.

Performance testing:
XDP drop/tx rate and TCP single/multi stream, on mlx5 driver
while migrating rx ring irq from close to far numa:

mlx5 internal page cache was locally disabled to get pure page pool
results.

CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2603 v4 @ 1.70GHz
NIC: Mellanox Technologies MT27700 Family [ConnectX-4] (100G)

XDP Drop/TX single core:
NUMA  | XDP  | Before    | After
---------------------------------------
Close | Drop | 11   Mpps | 10.9 Mpps
Far   | Drop | 4.4  Mpps | 5.8  Mpps

Close | TX   | 6.5 Mpps  | 6.5 Mpps
Far   | TX   | 3.5 Mpps  | 4  Mpps

Improvement is about 30% drop packet rate, 15% tx packet rate for numa
far test.
No degradation for numa close tests.

TCP single/multi cpu/stream:
NUMA  | #cpu | Before  | After
--------------------------------------
Close | 1    | 18 Gbps | 18 Gbps
Far   | 1    | 15 Gbps | 18 Gbps
Close | 12   | 80 Gbps | 80 Gbps
Far   | 12   | 68 Gbps | 80 Gbps

In all test cases we see improvement for the far numa case, and no
impact on the close numa case.
