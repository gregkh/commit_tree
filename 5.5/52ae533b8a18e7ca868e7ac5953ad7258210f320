lib/sort: Move swap, cmp and cmp_r function types for wider use

The function types for swap, cmp and cmp_r functions are already
being in use by modules.

Move them to types.h that everybody in kernel will be able to use
generic types instead of custom ones.

This adds more sense to the comment in bsearch() later on.
