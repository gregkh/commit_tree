x86/jailhouse: Improve setup data version comparison

Soon, setup_data will contain information on passed-through platform
UARTs. This requires some preparational work for the sanity check of the
header and the check of the version.

Use the following strategy:

  1. Ensure that the header declares at least enough space for the
     version and the compatible_version as it must hold that fields for
     any version. The location and semantics of header+version fields
     will never change.

  2. Copy over data -- as much as as possible. The length is either
     limited by the header length or the length of setup_data.

  3. Things are now in place -- sanity check if the header length
     complies the actual version.

For future versions of the setup_data, only step 3 requires alignment.
