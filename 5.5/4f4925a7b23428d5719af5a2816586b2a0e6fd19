iwlwifi: pcie: fix support for transmitting SKBs with fraglist

When the implementation of SKBs with fraglist was sent upstream, a
merge-damage occurred and half the patch was not applied.

This causes problems in high-throughput situations with AX200 devices,
including low throughput and FW crashes.

Introduce the part that was missing from the original patch.
