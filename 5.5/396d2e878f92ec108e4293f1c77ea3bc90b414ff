kvm: x86: Host feature SSBD doesn't imply guest feature SPEC_CTRL_SSBD

The host reports support for the synthetic feature X86_FEATURE_SSBD
when any of the three following hardware features are set:
  CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):EDX.SSBD[bit 31]
  CPUID.80000008H:EBX.AMD_SSBD[bit 24]
  CPUID.80000008H:EBX.VIRT_SSBD[bit 25]

Either of the first two hardware features implies the existence of the
IA32_SPEC_CTRL MSR, but CPUID.80000008H:EBX.VIRT_SSBD[bit 25] does
not. Therefore, CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):EDX.SSBD[bit 31] should only be
set in the guest if CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):EDX.SSBD[bit 31] or
CPUID.80000008H:EBX.AMD_SSBD[bit 24] is set on the host.
