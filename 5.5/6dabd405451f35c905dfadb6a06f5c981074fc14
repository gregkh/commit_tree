net/smc: introduce bookkeeping of SMCR link groups

If the smc module is unloaded return control from exit routine only,
if all link groups are freed.
If an IB device is thrown away return control from device removal only,
if all link groups belonging to this device are freed.
Counters for the total number of SMCR link groups and for the total
number of SMCR links per IB device are introduced. smc module unloading
continues only if the total number of SMCR link groups is zero. IB device
removal continues only it the total number of SMCR links per IB device
has decreased to zero.
