drm/i915/pmu: Skip busyness sampling when and where not needed

Since d0aa694b9239 ("drm/i915/pmu: Always sample an active ringbuffer")
the cost of sampling the engine state on execlists platforms became a
little bit higher when both engine busyness and one of the wait states are
being monitored. (Previously the busyness sampling on legacy platforms was
done via seqno comparison so there was no cost of mmio read.)

We can avoid that by skipping busyness sampling when engine supports
software busy stats and so avoid the cost of potential mmio read and
sample accumulation.
