scsi: lpfc: Add additional discovery log messages

When debugging a recent discovery customer problem it was very hard to tell
what was happening with the existing discovery log messages. To fully debug
the issue additional log messages were necessary.

Add or extend log messages so that sufficient information is present for
debugging.
