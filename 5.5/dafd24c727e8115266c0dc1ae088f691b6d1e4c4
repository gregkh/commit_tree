ARM: OMAP1: drop duplicated dependency on ARCH_OMAP1

All of arch/arm/mach-omap1/Kconfig is enclosed in a big "if ARCH_OMAP1"
and so every symbol already has a dependency on ARCH_OMAP1 even without
mentioning it in their list of dependencies.

Also dependencies on ARCH_OMAP can be dropped as it is selected by
ARCH_OMAP1.
