RDMA/cma: Use ACK timeout for RoCE packetLifeTime

The cma is currently using a hard-coded value, CMA_IBOE_PACKET_LIFETIME,
for the PacketLifeTime, as it can not be determined from the network.
This value might not be optimal for all networks.

The cma module supports the function rdma_set_ack_timeout to set the ACK
timeout for a QP associated with a connection. As per IBTA 12.7.34 local
ACK timeout = (2 * PacketLifeTime + Local CAâ€™s ACK delay).  Assuming a
negligible local ACK delay, we can use PacketLifeTime = local ACK
timeout/2 as a reasonable approximation for RoCE networks.
