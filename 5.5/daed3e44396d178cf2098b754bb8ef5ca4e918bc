drm/i915/perf: implement active wait for noa configurations

NOA configuration take some amount of time to apply. That amount of
time depends on the size of the GT. There is no documented time for
this. For example, past experimentations with powergating
configuration changes seem to indicate a 60~70us delay. We go with
500us as default for now which should be over the required amount of
time (according to HW architects).

v2: Don't forget to save/restore registers used for the wait (Chris)

v3: Name used CS_GPR registers (Chris)
    Fix compile issue due to rebase (Lionel)

v4: Fix save/restore helpers (Umesh)

v5: Move noa_wait from drm_i915_private to i915_perf_stream (Lionel)

v6: Add missing struct declarations in i915_perf.h
