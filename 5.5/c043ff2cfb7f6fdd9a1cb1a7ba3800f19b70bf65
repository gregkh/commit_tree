RDMA: Connect between the mmap entry and the umap_priv structure

The rdma_user_mmap_io interface created a common interface for drivers to
correctly map hw resources and zap them once the ucontext is destroyed
enabling the drivers to safely free the hw resources.

However, this meant the drivers need to delay freeing the resource to the
ucontext destroy phase to ensure they were no longer mapped.  The new
mechanism for a common way of handling user/driver address mapping enabled
notifying the driver if all umap_priv mappings were removed, and enabled
freeing the hw resources when they are done with and not delay it until
ucontext destroy.

Since not all drivers use the mechanism, NULL can be sent to the
rdma_user_mmap_io interface to continue working as before.  Drivers that
use the mmap_xa interface can pass the entry being mapped to the
rdma_user_mmap_io function to be linked together.
