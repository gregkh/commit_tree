net/mlx5: DR, Support IPv4 and IPv6 mixed matcher

Until now SW steering supported matchers that are IPv4 and IPv6.
The limitation was mixed matchers in which the outer header IP version
was different from the inner header IP version.

To support the mixed matcher we create all the possible ste_builder
combinations, once we create a rule we select the correct one to
be used for rule creation.
