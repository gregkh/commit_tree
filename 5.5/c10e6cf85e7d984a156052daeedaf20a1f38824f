net: genetlink: push attrbuf allocation and parsing to a separate function

To be re-usable by dumpit as well, push the code that is taking care of
attrbuf allocation and parting from doit into separate function.
Introduce a helper to free the buffer too.

Check family->maxattr too before calling kfree() to be symmetrical with
the allocation check.
