gpiolib: introduce fwnode_gpiod_get_index()

This introduces fwnode_gpiod_get_index() that iterates through common gpio
suffixes when trying to locate a GPIO within a given firmware node.

We also switch devm_fwnode_gpiod_get_index() to call
fwnode_gpiod_get_index() instead of iterating through GPIO suffixes on
its own.
