NFSv4: Fix races between open and delegreturn

If the server returns the same delegation in an open that we just used
in a delegreturn, we need to ensure we don't apply that stateid if
the delegreturn has freed it on the server.
To do so, we ensure that we do not free the storage for the delegation
until either it is replaced by a new one, or we throw the inode out of
cache.
