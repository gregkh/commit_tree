staging: qlge: Update buffer queue prod index despite oom

Currently, if we repeatedly fail to allocate all of the buffers from the
desired batching budget, we will never update the prod_idx register.
Restructure code to always update prod_idx if new buffers could be
allocated. This eliminates the current two stage process (clean_idx ->
prod_idx) and some associated bookkeeping variables.
