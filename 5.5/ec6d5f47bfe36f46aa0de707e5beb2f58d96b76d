libbpf: Unpin auto-pinned maps if loading fails

Since the automatic map-pinning happens during load, it will leave pinned
maps around if the load fails at a later stage. Fix this by unpinning any
pinned maps on cleanup. To avoid unpinning pinned maps that were reused
rather than newly pinned, add a new boolean property on struct bpf_map to
keep track of whether that map was reused or not; and only unpin those maps
that were not reused.
