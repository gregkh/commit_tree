s390/time: ensure get_clock_monotonic() returns monotonic values

The current implementation of get_clock_monotonic() leaves it up to
the caller to call the function with preemption disabled. The only
core kernel caller (sched_clock) however does not disable preemption.

In order to make sure that all callers of this function see monotonic
values handle disabling preemption within the function itself.
