md: improve handling of bio with REQ_PREFLUSH in md_flush_request()

If pers->make_request fails in md_flush_request(), the bio is lost. To
fix this, pass back a bool to indicate if the original make_request call
should continue to handle the I/O and instead of assuming the flush logic
will push it to completion.

Convert md_flush_request to return a bool and no longer calls the raid
driver's make_request function.  If the return is true, then the md flush
logic has or will complete the bio and the md make_request call is done.
If false, then the md make_request function needs to keep processing like
it is a normal bio. Let the original call to md_handle_request handle any
need to retry sending the bio to the raid driver's make_request function
should it be needed.

Also mark md_flush_request and the make_request function pointer as
__must_check to issue warnings should these critical return values be
ignored.
