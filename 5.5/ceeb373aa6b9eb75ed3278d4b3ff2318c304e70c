block: Simplify report zones execution

All kernel users of blkdev_report_zones() as well as applications use
through ioctl(BLKZONEREPORT) expect to potentially get less zone
descriptors than requested. As such, the use of the internal report
zones command execution loop implemented by blk_report_zones() is
not necessary and can even be harmful to performance by causing the
execution of inefficient small zones report command to service the
reminder of a requested zone array.

This patch removes blk_report_zones(), simplifying the code. Also
remove a now incorrect comment in dm_blk_report_zones().
