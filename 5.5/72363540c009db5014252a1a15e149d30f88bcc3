perf probe: Support multiprobe event

Support multiprobe event if the event is based on function and lines and
kernel supports it. In this case, perf probe creates the first probe
with an event, and tries to append following probes on that event, since
those probes must be on the same source code line.

Before this patch;

  # perf probe -a vfs_read:18
  Added new events:
    probe:vfs_read_L18   (on vfs_read:18)
    probe:vfs_read_L18_1 (on vfs_read:18)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:vfs_read_L18_1 -aR sleep 1

  #

After this patch (on multiprobe supported kernel)
  # perf probe -a vfs_read:18
  Added new events:
    probe:vfs_read_L18   (on vfs_read:18)
    probe:vfs_read_L18   (on vfs_read:18)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:vfs_read_L18 -aR sleep 1

  #

Committer testing:

On a kernel that doesn't support multiprobe events, after this patch:

  # uname -a
  Linux quaco 5.3.8-200.fc30.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Oct 29 14:46:22 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  # grep append /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/README

  	    can be modified by appending any of the following modifiers
  #
  # perf probe -a vfs_read:18
  Added new events:
    probe:vfs_read_L18   (on vfs_read:18)
    probe:vfs_read_L18_1 (on vfs_read:18)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:vfs_read_L18_1 -aR sleep 1

  # perf probe -l
    probe:vfs_read_L18   (on vfs_read:18@fs/read_write.c)
    probe:vfs_read_L18_1 (on vfs_read:18@fs/read_write.c)
