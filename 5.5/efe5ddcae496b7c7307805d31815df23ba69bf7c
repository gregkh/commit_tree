KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Allow userspace to set the # of VPs

Add a new attribute to both XIVE and XICS-on-XIVE KVM devices so that
userspace can tell how many interrupt servers it needs. If a VM needs
less than the current default of KVM_MAX_VCPUS (2048), we can allocate
less VPs in OPAL. Combined with a core stride (VSMT) that matches the
number of guest threads per core, this may substantially increases the
number of VMs that can run concurrently with an in-kernel XIVE device.

Since the legacy XIVE KVM device is exposed to userspace through the
XICS KVM API, a new attribute group is added to it for this purpose.
While here, fix the syntax of the existing KVM_DEV_XICS_GRP_SOURCES
in the XICS documentation.
