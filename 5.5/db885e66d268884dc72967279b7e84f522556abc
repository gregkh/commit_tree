net/tls: fix async operation

Mallesham reports the TLS with async accelerator was broken by
commit d10523d0b3d7 ("net/tls: free the record on encryption error")
because encryption can return -EINPROGRESS in such setups, which
should not be treated as an error.

The error is also present in the BPF path (likely copied from there).
