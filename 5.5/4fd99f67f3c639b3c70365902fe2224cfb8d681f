drm/amd/display: refine i2c over aux

[Why]
When user mode use i2c over aux through ADL or DDI, the function
dal_ddc_service_query_ddc_data will be called. There are two issues.

1. When read/write length > 16byte, current always return false because
the DEFAULT_AUX_MAX_DATA_SIZE != length.
2. When usermode only need to read data through i2c, driver will write
mot = true at the same address and cause i2c sink confused. Therefore
the following read command will get garbage.

[How]
1. Add function dal_dcc_submit_aux_command to handle length > 16 byte.
2. Check read size and write size when query ddc data.
