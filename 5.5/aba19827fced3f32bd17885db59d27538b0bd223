soc/tegra: pmc: Support wake events on more Tegra SoCs

This patch allows to create separate irq_set_wake and irq_set_type
implementations for different Tegra designs PMC that has different
wake models which require difference wake registers and different
programming sequence.

AOWAKE model support is available for Tegra186 and Tegra194 only
and it resides within PMC and supports tiered wake architecture.

Tegra210 and prior Tegra designs uses PMC directly to receive wake
events and coordinate the wake sequence.
