hwrng: omap3-rom - Use runtime PM instead of custom functions

Nowadays we have runtime PM, and we can use it with autosuspend_timeout
to idle things automatically. This allows us to get rid of the custom
PM implementation.

We enable clocks and init RNG in runtime_resume, and reset RNG and
disable clocks in runtime_suspend. And then omap3_rom_rng_read()
becomes very simple and we don't need the old functions for
omap3_rom_rng_idle() and omap3_rom_rng_get_random(). We can now also
get rid of pr_fmt as we're using dev_err instead.
