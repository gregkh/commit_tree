perf kvm: Clarify the 'perf kvm' -i and -o command line options

The 'perf kvm' subcommand has options that it in turn passes to other
perf subcommands such as 'report' and 'record', particularly -i and -o
end up setting the same variable that will then be used for 'record's -o
and report '-i', which ends up being confusing, leading some to think
that both -i and -o can be used with 'report'.

Improve the man page to state that -i is used with the post-processing
subcommands while -o is used just with 'record' and that to save the
output of 'report' one should simply redirect its output to a file.

Noticed while reading the https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Perf_events
page.
