PCI: dwc: Fix find_next_bit() usage

find_next_bit() takes a parameter of size long, and performs arithmetic
that assumes that the argument is of size long.

Therefore we cannot pass a u32, since this will cause find_next_bit()
to read outside the stack buffer and will produce the following print:
BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in find_next_bit+0x38/0xb0
