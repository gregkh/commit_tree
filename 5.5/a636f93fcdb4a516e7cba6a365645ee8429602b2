arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Disable coresight by default

Boot failure has been reported on MSM8998 based laptop when
coresight is enabled. This is most likely due to lack of
firmware support for coresight on production device when
compared to debug device like MTP where this issue is not
observed. So disable coresight by default for MSM8998 and
enable it only for MSM8998 MTP.
