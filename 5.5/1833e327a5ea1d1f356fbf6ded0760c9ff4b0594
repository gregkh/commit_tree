riscv: export flush_icache_all to modules

This is needed by LKDTM (crash dump test module), it calls
flush_icache_range(), which on RISC-V turns into flush_icache_all(). On
other architectures, the actual implementation is exported, so follow
that precedence and export it here too.

Fixes build of CONFIG_LKDTM that fails with:
ERROR: "flush_icache_all" [drivers/misc/lkdtm/lkdtm.ko] undefined!
