spi: orion: use new `word_delay` field for SPI transfers

The `word_delay` field had it's type changed to `struct spi_delay`.
This allows users to specify nano-second or clock-cycle delays (if needed).

Converting to use `word_delay` is straightforward: it just uses the new
`spi_delay_exec()` routine, that handles the `unit` part.
