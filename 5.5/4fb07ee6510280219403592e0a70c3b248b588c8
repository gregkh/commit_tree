userfaultfd: use vma_pagesize for all huge page size calculation

In __mcopy_atomic_hugetlb() we use two variables to deal with huge page
size: vma_hpagesize and huge_page_size.

Since they are the same, it is not necessary to use two different
mechanism. This patch makes it consistent by all using vma_hpagesize.
