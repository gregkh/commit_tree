net: ethernet: ti: ale: ensure vlan/mdb deleted when no members

The recently updated ALE APIs cpsw_ale_del_mcast() and
cpsw_ale_del_vlan_modify() have an issue and will not delete ALE entry even
if VLAN/mcast group has no more members. Hence fix it here and delete ALE
entry if !port_mask.

The issue affected only new cpsw switchdev driver.
