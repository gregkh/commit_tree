ftrace: Add helper find_direct_entry() to consolidate code

Both unregister_ftrace_direct() and modify_ftrace_direct() needs to
normalize the ip passed in to match the rec->ip, as it is acceptable to have
the ip on the ftrace call site but not the start. There are also common
validity checks with the record found by the ip, these should be done for
both unregister_ftrace_direct() and modify_ftrace_direct().
