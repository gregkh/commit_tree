octeontx2-af: Add NDC block stats to debugfs.

NDC is a data cache unit which caches NPA and NIX block's
aura/pool/RQ/SQ/CQ/etc contexts to reduce number of costly
DRAM accesses.

This patch adds support to dump cache's performance stats
like cache line hit/miss counters, average cycles taken for
accessing cached and non-cached data. This will help in
checking if NPA/NIX context reads/writes are having NDC cache
misses which inturn might effect performance.

Also changed NDC enums to reflect correct NDC hardware instance.
