crypto: inside-secure - Add support for the EIP196

This patch adds support for the EIP196, which is an EIP197 derivative
that has no classification hardware and a simplified record cache.

The patch has been tested with the eip196b-ie and eip197c-iewxkbc
configurations on the Xilinx VCU118 development board as well as on the
Macchiatobin board (Marvell A8K - EIP197b-ieswx), including the crypto
extra tests.

Note that this patchset applies on top of the earlier submitted
"Add support for eip197f_iewc" series.
