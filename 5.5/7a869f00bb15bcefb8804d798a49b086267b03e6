mmc: sdhci-pci: Quirk for AMD SDHC Device 0x7906

AMD SDHC 0x7906 requires a hard reset to clear all internal state.
Otherwise it can get into a bad state where the DATA lines are always
read as zeros.

This change requires firmware that can transition the device into
D3Cold for it to work correctly. If the firmware does not support
transitioning to D3Cold then the power state transitions are a no-op.
