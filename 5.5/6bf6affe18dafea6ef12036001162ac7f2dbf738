selftests/bpf: Bring back c++ include/link test

Commit 5c26f9a78358 ("libbpf: Don't use cxx to test_libpf target")
converted existing c++ test to c. We still want to include and
link against libbpf from c++ code, so reinstate this test back,
this time in a form of a selftest with a clear comment about
its purpose.

v2:
* -lelf -> $(LDLIBS) (Andrii Nakryiko)
