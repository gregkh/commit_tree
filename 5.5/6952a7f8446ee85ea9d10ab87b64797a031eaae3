block: split bio if the only bvec's length is > SZ_4K

64K PAGE_SIZE is popular on ARM64 or other ARCHs, and 64K has been big
enough to break some devices probably, so change the logic to split bio
if the only bvec's length is > SZ_4K instead of PAGE_SIZE.

Fixes: fa5322872187 (block: avoid blk_bio_segment_split for small I/O operations)
