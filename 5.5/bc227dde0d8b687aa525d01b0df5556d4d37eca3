scsi: lpfc: Initialize cpu_map for not present cpus

Currently, cpu_map[cpu#]->hdwq is left to equal LPFC_VECTOR_MAP_EMPTY for
not present CPUs.  If a CPU is dynamically hot-added, it is possible we may
crash due to not assigning an allocated hdwq.

Correct by assigning a hdwq at initialization for all not-present CPUs.
