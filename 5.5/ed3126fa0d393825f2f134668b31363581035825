drm/i915: parameterize south hpd macros

South, follow the north.

Instead of defining separate macros for each port, make them take port
as parameter as done for TC ports and for north engine. This will allow
us to easily extend this as needed.

tgp_ddi_port_hotplug_long_detect() is also removed as after the EHL
introduction the tgp variant is an exact copy of icp.
