drm/i915: Drop unused AUX register offsets

We reference DP AUX registers via the DP_AUX_CH_CTL() and
DP_AUX_CH_DATA() macros that calculate all the register offsets for us
automatically; there's no need to explicitly define every offset in
i915_reg.h if they're never going to be used by the driver code.

v2: Apparently GVT was directly using these raw definitions in a couple
    places.  Switch GVT code over to using our preferred macros.
