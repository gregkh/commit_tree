libbpf: Support initialized global variables

Initialized global variables are no different in ELF from static variables,
and don't require any extra support from libbpf. But they are matching
semantics of global data (backed by BPF maps) more closely, preventing
LLVM/Clang from aggressively inlining constant values and not requiring
volatile incantations to prevent those. This patch enables global variables.
It still disables uninitialized variables, which will be put into special COM
(common) ELF section, because BPF doesn't allow uninitialized data to be
accessed.
