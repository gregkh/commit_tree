drm/i915/pmu: Initialise the spinlock before registering

As the GT may be running in parallel with the module initialisation
code, we may enter i915_pmu_gt_parked() as we are executing
i915_pmu_register(). We have to init the spinlock before we mark
pmu.event_init so that it is available for use by i915_pmu_gt_parked()
(which may run as soon as event_init is set).
