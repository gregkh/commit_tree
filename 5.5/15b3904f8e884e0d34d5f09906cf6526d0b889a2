libtraceevent: Copy pkg-config file to output folder when using O=

When we use 'O=' with make to build libtraceevent in a separate folder
it still copies 'libtraceevent.pc' to its source folder. Modify the
Makefile so that it uses the output folder to copy the pkg-config file
and install from there.
