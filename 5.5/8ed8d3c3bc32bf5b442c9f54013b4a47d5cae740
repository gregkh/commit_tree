io_uring: any deferred command must have stable sqe data

We're currently not retaining sqe data for accept, fsync, and
sync_file_range. None of these commands need data outside of what
is directly provided, hence it can't go stale when the request is
deferred. However, it can get reused, if an application reuses
SQE entries.

Ensure that we retain the information we need and only read the sqe
contents once, off the submission path. Most of this is just moving
code into a prep and finish function.
