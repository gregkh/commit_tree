ALSA: ice1724: Fix sleep-in-atomic in Infrasonic Quartet support code

Jia-Ju Bai reported a possible sleep-in-atomic scenario in the ice1724
driver with Infrasonic Quartet support code: namely, ice->set_rate
callback gets called inside ice->reg_lock spinlock, while the callback
in quartet.c holds ice->gpio_mutex.

This patch fixes the invalid call: it simply moves the calls of
ice->set_rate and ice->set_mclk callbacks outside the spinlock.
