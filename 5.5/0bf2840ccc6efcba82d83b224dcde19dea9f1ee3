nfc: pn533: Add dev_up/dev_down hooks to phy_ops

This adds hooks for dev_up and dev_down to the phy_ops. They are
optional.
The idea is to inform the phy driver when the nfc chip is really going
to be used. When it is not used, the phy driver can suspend it's
interface to the nfc chip to save some power. The nfc chip is considered
not in use before dev_up and after dev_down.
