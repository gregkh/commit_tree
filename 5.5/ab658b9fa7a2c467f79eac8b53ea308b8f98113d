netfilter: conntrack: sctp: use distinct states for new SCTP connections

The netlink notifications triggered by the INIT and INIT_ACK chunks
for a tracked SCTP association do not include protocol information
for the corresponding connection - SCTP state and verification tags
for the original and reply direction are missing. Since the connection
tracking implementation allows user space programs to receive
notifications about a connection and then create a new connection
based on the values received in a notification, it makes sense that
INIT and INIT_ACK notifications should contain the SCTP state
and verification tags available at the time when a notification
is sent. The missing verification tags cause a newly created
netfilter connection to fail to verify the tags of SCTP packets
when this connection has been created from the values previously
received in an INIT or INIT_ACK notification.

A PROTOINFO event is cached in sctp_packet() when the state
of a connection changes. The CLOSED and COOKIE_WAIT state will
be used for connections that have seen an INIT and INIT_ACK chunk,
respectively. The distinct states will cause a connection state
change in sctp_packet().
