perf trace: Introduce accessors to trace specific evsel->priv

We're using evsel->priv in syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}_SYSCALL and in
raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit} to cache the offset of the common fields,
the multiplexor id/syscall_id in the sys_enter case and syscall_id + ret
for sys_exit.

And for the rest of the tracepoints we use it to have a syscall_arg_fmt
array to have scnprintf/strtoul for tracepoint args.

So we better clearly mark them with accessors so that we can move to
having a 'struct evsel_trace' struct for all 'perf trace' specific
evsel->priv usage.
