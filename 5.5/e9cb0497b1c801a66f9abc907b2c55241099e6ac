firmware: Fix incompatible function behavior for RSU driver

The older versions of remote system update (RSU) firmware don't support
retry and notify features then the kernel module dies when it queries
the RSU retry counter or performs notify operation.

Update the Intel service layer and RSU drivers to be compatible with
all versions of RSU firmware.
