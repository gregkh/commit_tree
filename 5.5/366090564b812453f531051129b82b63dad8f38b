RDMA/mlx5: Add capability for max sge to get optimized performance

Allows the IB device to provide a value of maximum scatter gather entries
per RDMA READ.

In certain cases it may be preferable for a device to perform UMR memory
registration rather than have many scatter entries in a single RDMA READ.
This provides a significant performance increase in devices capable of
using different memory registration schemes based on the number of scatter
gather entries. This general capability allows each device vendor to fine
tune when it is better to use memory registration.
