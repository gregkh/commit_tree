drivers: thermal: tsens: Get rid of id field in tsens_sensor

There are two fields - id and hw_id - to track what sensor an action was
to performed on. This was because the sensors connected to a TSENS IP
might not be contiguous i.e. 1, 2, 4, 5 with 3 being skipped.

This causes confusion in the code which uses hw_id sometimes and id
other times (tsens_get_temp, tsens_get_trend).

Switch to only using the hw_id field to track the physical ID of the
sensor. When we iterate through all the sensors connected to an IP
block, we use an index i to loop through the list of sensors, and then
return the actual hw_id that is registered on that index.
