s390/qeth: lock the card while changing its hsuid

qeth_l3_dev_hsuid_store() initially checks the card state, but doesn't
take the conf_mutex to ensure that the card stays in this state while
being reconfigured.

Rework the code to take this lock, and drop a redundant state check in a
helper function.
