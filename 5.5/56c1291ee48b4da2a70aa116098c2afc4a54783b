bpf: re-fix skip write only files in debugfs

Commit 5bc60de50dfe ("selftests: bpf: Don't try to read files without
read permission") got reverted as the fix was not working as expected
and real fix came in via 8101e069418d ("selftests: bpf: Skip write
only files in debugfs"). When bpf-next got merged into net-next, the
test_offload.py had a small conflict. Fix the resolution in ae8a76fb8b5d
iby not reintroducing 5bc60de50dfe again.
