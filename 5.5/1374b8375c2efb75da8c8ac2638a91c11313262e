drm/meson: dw_hdmi: add resume/suspend hooks

Add the suspend and resume hooks to:
- reset the whole HDMI glue and HDMI controller on suspend
- re-init the HDMI glue and HDMI controller on resume

The HDMI glue init is refactored to be re-used from the resume hook.

It makes usage of dw_hdmi_resume() to recover a functionnal DDC bus.
