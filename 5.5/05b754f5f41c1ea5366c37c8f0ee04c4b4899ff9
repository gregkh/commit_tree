ASoC: rockchip_max98090: Optionally support HDMI use case

Support three different use cases with rockchip_max98090 driver.

The three use cases:
- max98090 only: Current usage, where HDMI link is missing.
- HDMI only: Needed use case for veyron_mickey board.
- max98090 + HDMI: Ideal use case for veyron_jerry, veyron_minnie..etc.

The presence of max98090 is determined by the presence of
rockchip,audio-codec device property.

The presence of HDMI is determined by the presence of
rockchip,hdmi-codec device property.

Create different sound card based on the configuration.
Note that we keep max98090 only usage for backward compatibility.
