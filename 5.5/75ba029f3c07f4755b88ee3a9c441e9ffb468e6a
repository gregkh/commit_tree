netdevsim: implement proper devlink reload

During devlink reload, all driver objects should be reinstantiated with
the exception of devlink instance and devlink resources and params.
Move existing devlink_resource_size_get() calls into fib_create() just
before fib notifier is registered. Also, make sure that extack is
propagated down to fib_notifier_register() call.
