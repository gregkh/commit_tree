ARM: dts: imx6ull: improve can templates

Add the pinmuxing and a inactive node for flexcan1 on SODIMM 55/63
and move the inactive flexcan nodes to imx6ull-colibri-eval-v3.dtsi
where they belong.

Note that this commit does not enable flexcan functionality, but rather
eases the effort needed to do so.
