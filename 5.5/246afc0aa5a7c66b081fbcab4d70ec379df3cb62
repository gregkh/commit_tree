NFSv4: Handle NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID in delegreturn

If the server returns NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID in response to our delegreturn,
we want to sync to the most recent seqid for the delegation stateid. However
if we are already at the most recent, we have two possibilities:

- an OPEN reply is still outstanding and will return a new seqid
- an earlier OPEN reply was dropped on the floor due to a timeout.

In the latter case, we may end up unable to complete the delegreturn,
so we want to bump the seqid to a value greater than the cached value.
While this may cause us to lose the delegation in the former case,
it should now be safe to assume that the client will replay the OPEN
if necessary in order to get a new valid stateid.
