dt-bindings: arm: coresight: Add support for coresight-loses-context-with-cpu

Some coresight components, because of choices made during hardware
integration, require their state to be saved and restored across CPU low
power states.

The software has no reliable method of detecting when save/restore is
required thus let's add a binding to inform the kernel.
