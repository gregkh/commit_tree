Revert "Input: cros_ec_keyb: mask out extra flags in event_type"

This reverts commit d096aa3eb6045a6a475a0239f3471c59eedf3d61.

This patch is not needed anymore since we clear EC_MKBP_HAS_MORE_EVENTS
flag before calling the notifiers in patch
"9d9518f5b52a (platform: chrome: cros_ec: handle MKBP more events flag)"
