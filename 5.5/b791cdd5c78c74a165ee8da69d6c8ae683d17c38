ice: Change max MSI-x vector_id check in cfg_irq_map

Currently we check to make sure the vector_id passed down from iavf
is less than or equal to pf->hw.func_caps.common_caps.num_msix_vectors.
This is incorrect because the vector_id is always 0-based and never
greater than or equal to the ICE_MAX_INTR_PER_VF. Fix this by checking
to make sure the vector_id is less than the max allowed interrupts per
VF (ICE_MAX_INTR_PER_VF).
