staging: exfat: Clean up the namespace pollution part 6

Move a few more things so we can make them static and clear exfat.h out.
At this point, pretty much everything that can be static is static.
(Note: FAT_sync(), buf_sync(), and sync_alloc_bitmap() aren't called
anyplace, but aren't static because (a) that will toss an error and
(b) they probably *should* be getting called someplace
