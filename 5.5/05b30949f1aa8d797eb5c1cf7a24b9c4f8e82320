xfs: set IOMAP_F_NEW more carefully

Don't set IOMAP_F_NEW if we COW over an existing allocated range, as
these aren't strictly new allocations.  This is required to be able to
use IOMAP_F_NEW to zero newly allocated blocks, which is required for
the iomap code to fully support file systems that don't do delayed
allocations or use unwritten extents.
