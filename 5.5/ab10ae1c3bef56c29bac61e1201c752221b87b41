lib: Reduce user_access_begin() boundaries in strncpy_from_user() and strnlen_user()

The range passed to user_access_begin() by strncpy_from_user() and
strnlen_user() starts at 'src' and goes up to the limit of userspace
although reads will be limited by the 'count' param.

On 32 bits powerpc (book3s/32) access has to be granted for each
256Mbytes segment and the cost increases with the number of segments to
unlock.

Limit the range with 'count' param.
