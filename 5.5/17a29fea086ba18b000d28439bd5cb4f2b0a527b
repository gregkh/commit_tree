staging/octeon: Use stubs for MIPS && !CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC

When building for a non-Cavium MIPS system with COMPILE_TEST=y, the
Octeon ethernet driver hits a number of issues due to use of macros
provided only for CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC=y configurations. For
example:

  drivers/staging/octeon/ethernet-rx.c:190:6: error:
    'CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON_CVMSEG_SIZE' undeclared (first use in this function)
  drivers/staging/octeon/ethernet-rx.c:472:25: error:
    'OCTEON_IRQ_WORKQ0' undeclared (first use in this function)

These come from various asm/ headers that a non-Octeon build will be
using a non-Octeon version of.

Fix this by using the octeon-stubs.h header for non-Cavium MIPS builds,
and only using the real asm/octeon/ headers when building a Cavium
Octeon kernel configuration.

This requires that octeon-stubs.h doesn't redefine XKPHYS_TO_PHYS, which
is defined for MIPS by asm/addrspace.h which is pulled in by many other
common asm/ headers.
