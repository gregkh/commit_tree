pwm: stm32: Add power management support

Add suspend/resume PM sleep ops. When going to low power, enforce the PWM
channel isn't active. Let the PWM consumers disable it during their own
suspend sequence, see [1]. So, perform a check here, and handle the
pinctrl states. Also restore the break inputs upon resume, as registers
content may be lost when going to low power mode.
