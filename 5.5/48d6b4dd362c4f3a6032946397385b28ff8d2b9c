  drivers/rapidio/rio-driver.c:53:16: warning: symbol 'rio_dev_get' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/rapidio/rio-driver.c:70:6: warning: symbol 'rio_dev_put' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/rapidio/rio-driver.c:150:5: warning: symbol 'rio_register_driver' was not declared. Should it be static?
