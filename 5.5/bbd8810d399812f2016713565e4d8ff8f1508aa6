PCI: Remove unused includes and superfluous struct declaration

Remove <linux/pci.h> and <linux/msi.h> from being included directly as part
of the include/linux/of_pci.h, and remove superfluous declaration of struct
of_phandle_args.

Move users of include <linux/of_pci.h> to include <linux/pci.h> and
<linux/msi.h> directly rather than rely on both being included transitively
through <linux/of_pci.h>.
