bus: ti-sysc: Fix quirk flags for lcdc on am335x

Commit adb72394e2ab ("ARM: OMAP2+: Drop legacy platform data for am3
lcdc") dropped legacy platform data but we never added the quirks for
SWSUP_SIDLE and SWSUP_MSTANDBY for lcdc for ti-sysc driver.

This breaks suspend/resume. Let's fix the issue by enabling the same
quirks for ti-sysc driver as we had earlier with platform data.

Fixes: adb72394e2ab ("ARM: OMAP2+: Drop legacy platform data for am3 lcdc")
Fixes: 23731eac9848 ("bus: ti-sysc: Detect devices on am335x when DEBUG is enabled")
