perf mmap: Declare type for cpu mask of arbitrary length

Declare a dedicated struct map_cpu_mask type for cpu masks of arbitrary
length.

The mask is available thru bits pointer and the mask length is kept in
nbits field. MMAP_CPU_MASK_BYTES() macro returns mask storage size in
bytes.

The mmap_cpu_mask__scnprintf() function can be used to log text
representation of the mask.

Committer notes:

To print the 'nbits' struct member we must use %zd, since it is a
size_t, this fixes the build in some toolchains/arches.
