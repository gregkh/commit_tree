mm: move_pages: report the number of non-attempted pages

Since commit a49bd4d71637 ("mm, numa: rework do_pages_move"), the
semantic of move_pages() has changed to return the number of
non-migrated pages if they were result of a non-fatal reasons (usually a
busy page).

This was an unintentional change that hasn't been noticed except for LTP
tests which checked for the documented behavior.

There are two ways to go around this change.  We can even get back to
the original behavior and return -EAGAIN whenever migrate_pages is not
able to migrate pages due to non-fatal reasons.  Another option would be
to simply continue with the changed semantic and extend move_pages
documentation to clarify that -errno is returned on an invalid input or
when migration simply cannot succeed (e.g.  -ENOMEM, -EBUSY) or the
number of pages that couldn't have been migrated due to ephemeral
reasons (e.g.  page is pinned or locked for other reasons).

This patch implements the second option because this behavior is in
place for some time without anybody complaining and possibly new users
depending on it.  Also it allows to have a slightly easier error
handling as the caller knows that it is worth to retry when err > 0.

But since the new semantic would be aborted immediately if migration is
failed due to ephemeral reasons, need include the number of
non-attempted pages in the return value too.
