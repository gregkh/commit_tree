ASoC: soc-core: remove snd_soc_disconnect_sync()

Sound card disconnecting operation was needed when "sound driver" was
unbinded without unbinding "sound card".
In such case, sound driver should be stopped even though it was
playbacking/capturing. Otherwise clock open/close counter mismatch happen.

One headache was that we can't skip unbind in error case because unbind
operation doesn't check return value from each drivers.
snd_soc_disconnect_sync() was added for these purpose, and Renesas
sound card only is used it.

But now, ALSA SoC automatically disconnect sound card when sound driver
was unbinded. Thus, snd_soc_disconnect_sync() is no longer needed.
This patch removes it.
