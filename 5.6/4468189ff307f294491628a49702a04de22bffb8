ASoC: soc-core: find rtd via dai_link pointer at snd_soc_get_pcm_runtime()

Current snd_soc_get_pcm_runtime() is finding rtd by checking dai_link
name. But, it is strange and waste of CPU power, because its user want
to get from rtd from dai_link, not from dai_link name.
This patch find rtd via dai_link pointer instead of its name.
