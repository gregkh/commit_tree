pwm: Remove set but not set variable 'pwm'

Fixes gcc '-Wunused-but-set-variable' warning:

	drivers/pwm/pwm-pca9685.c: In function ‘pca9685_pwm_gpio_free’:
	drivers/pwm/pwm-pca9685.c:162:21: warning: variable ‘pwm’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

It is never used, and so can be removed. In that case, hold and release
the lock 'pca->lock' can be removed since nothing will be done between
them.

Fixes: e926b12c611c ("pwm: Clear chip_data in pwm_put()")
