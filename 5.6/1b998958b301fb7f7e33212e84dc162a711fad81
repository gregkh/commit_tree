staging: qlge: Fix CHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis

Fix CHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis in qlge_dbg.c,
qlge_ethtool.c, qlge_main.c, and qlge_mpi.c. Also made changes to
the following lines:

WARNING: quoted string split across lines
FILE: drivers/staging/qlge/qlge_main.c:81

WARNING: quoted string split across lines
FILE: drivers/staging/qlge/qlge_main.c:87

WARNING: quoted string split across lines
FILE: drivers/staging/qlge/qlge_main.c:3528

WARNING: quoted string split across lines
FILE: drivers/staging/qlge/qlge_main.c:3536

CHECK: spaces preferred around that '*' (ctx:VxV)
drivers/staging/qlge/qlge_main.c:4102

I made these changes due to touching these lines in the original fix
