ACPI: processor: Introduce acpi_processor_evaluate_cst()

In order to separate the ACPI _CST evaluation from checks
specific to the ACPI processor driver, move the majority of
the acpi_processor_get_power_info_cst() function body to a new
function, acpi_processor_evaluate_cst(), that will extract
the C-states information from _CST output, and redefine
acpi_processor_get_power_info_cst() as a wrapper around it.

No intentional functional impact.
