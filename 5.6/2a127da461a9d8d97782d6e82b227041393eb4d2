nvmem: add support for the write-protect pin

The write-protect pin handling looks like a standard property that
could benefit other users if available in the core nvmem framework.

Instead of modifying all the memory drivers to check this pin, make
the NVMEM subsystem check if the write-protect GPIO being passed
through the nvmem_config or defined in the device tree and pull it
low whenever writing to the memory.

There was a suggestion for introducing the gpiodesc from pdata, but
as pdata is already removed it could be replaced by adding it to
nvmem_config.
