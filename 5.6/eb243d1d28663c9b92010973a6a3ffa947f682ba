x86/mm/pat: Rename <asm/pat.h> => <asm/memtype.h>

pat.h is a file whose main purpose is to provide the memtype_*() APIs.

PAT is the low level hardware mechanism - but the high level abstraction
is memtype.

So name the header <memtype.h> as well - this goes hand in hand with memtype.c
and memtype_interval.c.
