EDAC/amd64: Do not warn when removing instances

On machines which do not populate all nodes with DIMMs, the driver
doesn't initialize an instance there. However, the instance removal
remove_one_instance() path will warn unconditionally, which is wrong.

Remove the WARN_ON() even if the warning is innocent because it causes a
splat in dmesg.
