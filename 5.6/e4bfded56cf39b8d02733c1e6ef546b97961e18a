usb: gadget: serial: fix Tx stall after buffer overflow

Symptom: application opens /dev/ttyGS0 and starts sending (writing) to
it while either USB cable is not connected, or nobody listens on the
other side of the cable. If driver circular buffer overflows before
connection is established, no data will be written to the USB layer
until/unless /dev/ttyGS0 is closed and re-opened again by the
application (the latter besides having no means of being notified about
the event of establishing of the connection.)

Fix: on open and/or connect, kick Tx to flush circular buffer data to
USB layer.
