qed: Use dmae to write to widebus registers in fw_funcs

There are several wide-bus registers written to by the fw_funcs
that require using the dmae for atomicity. Therefore using the dmae
channel functionality was added to the fw_funcs file, since the code
is very similar to the previously used code, the structures used were
moved to qed_hsi. Due to FW conventions, the names of the flags in the
struct changed. Since this required slight modification in the places
that set the flags the code was modified to use GET/SET FIELD macros.
