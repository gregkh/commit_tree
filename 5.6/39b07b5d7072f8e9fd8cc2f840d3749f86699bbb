btrfs: drop create parameter to btrfs_get_extent()

We only pass this as 1 from __extent_writepage_io(). The parameter
basically means "pretend I didn't pass in a page". This is silly since
we can simply not pass in the page. Get rid of the parameter from
btrfs_get_extent(), and since it's used as a get_extent_t callback,
remove it from get_extent_t and btree_get_extent(), neither of which
need it.

While we're here, let's document btrfs_get_extent().
