md/raid1: use bucket based mechanism for IO serialization

Since raid1 had already used bucket based mechanism to reduce
the conflict between write IO and resync IO, it is possible to
speed up performance for io serialization with refer to the
same mechanism.

To align with the barrier bucket mechanism, we created arrays
(with the same number of BARRIER_BUCKETS_NR) for spinlock, rb
tree and waitqueue. Then we can reduce lock competition with
multiple spinlocks, boost search performance with multiple rb
trees and also reduce thundering herd problem with multiple
waitqueues.
