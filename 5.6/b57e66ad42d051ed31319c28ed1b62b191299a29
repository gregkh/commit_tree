net/mlx5e: TX, Error completion is for last WQE in batch

For a cyclic work queue, when not requesting a completion per WQE,
a single CQE might indicate the completion of several WQEs.
However, in case some WQE in the batch causes an error, then an error
completion is issued, breaking the batch, and pointing to the offending
WQE in the wqe_counter field.

Hence, WQE-specific error CQE handling (like printing, breaking, etc...)
should be performed only for the last WQE in batch.
