cifs: make sure we do not overflow the max EA buffer size

RHBZ: 1752437

Before we add a new EA we should check that this will not overflow
the maximum buffer we have available to read the EAs back.
Otherwise we can get into a situation where the EAs are so big that
we can not read them back to the client and thus we can not list EAs
anymore or delete them.
