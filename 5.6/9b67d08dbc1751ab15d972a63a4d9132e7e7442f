crypto: ccp - rename psp-dev files to sev-dev

This is a preliminary patch for creating a generic PSP device driver
file, which will have support for both SEV and TEE (Trusted Execution
Environment) interface.

This patch does not introduce any new functionality, but simply renames
psp-dev.c and psp-dev.h files to sev-dev.c and sev-dev.h files
respectively.
