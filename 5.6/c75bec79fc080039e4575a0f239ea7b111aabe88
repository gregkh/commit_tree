tools headers UAPI: Sync copy of arm64's asm/unistd.h with the kernel sources

To get the changes in:

  3e3c8ca5a351 ("arm64: Move __ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE3 definition to uapi headers")

Silencing this tools/perf/ build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h

Which will probably end up enabling the use of "clone3" in 'perf trace -e',
haven't checked the build with this change on an arm64 system.
