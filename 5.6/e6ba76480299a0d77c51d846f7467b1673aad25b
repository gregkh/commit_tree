drm/i915: Remove i915->kernel_context

Allocate only an internal intel_context for the kernel_context, forgoing
a global GEM context for internal use as we only require a separate
address space (for our own protection).

Now having weaned GT from requiring ce->gem_context, we can stop
referencing it entirely. This also means we no longer have to create random
and unnecessary GEM contexts for internal use.

GEM contexts are now entirely for tracking GEM clients, and intel_context
the execution environment on the GPU.
