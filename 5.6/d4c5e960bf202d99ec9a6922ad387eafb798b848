ext4: avoid fetching btime in ext4_getattr() unless requested

Linus observed that an allmodconfig build which does a lot of stat(2)
calls that ext4_getattr() was a noticeable (1%) amount of CPU time,
due to the cache line for i_extra_isize getting pulled in.  Since the
normal stat system call doesn't return btime, it's a complete waste.
So only calculate btime when it is explicitly requested.

[ Fixed to check against request_mask instead of query_flags. ]
