iwlwifi: mvm: avoid use after free for pmsr request

When a FTM request is aborted, the driver sends the abort command to
the fw and waits for a response. When the response arrives, the driver
calls cfg80211_pmsr_complete() for that request.
However, cfg80211 frees the requested data immediately after sending
the abort command, so this may lead to use after free.

Fix it by clearing the request data in the driver when the abort
command arrives and ignoring the fw notification that will come
afterwards.
