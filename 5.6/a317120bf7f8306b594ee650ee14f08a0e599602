fs/adfs: dir: add generic copy functions

Directories can span multiple buffers, and we currently open-code
memcpy access to these buffers, including dealing with entries that
are split across multiple buffers.  Such code exists in both
directory format implementations.

Provide common functions to allow data to be copied from/to the
directory buffers as if they were a contiguous set of buffers, and
use them when accessing directories.
