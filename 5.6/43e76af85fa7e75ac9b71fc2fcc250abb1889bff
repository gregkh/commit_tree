kcov: ignore fault-inject and stacktrace

Don't instrument 3 more files that contain debugging facilities and
produce large amounts of uninteresting coverage for every syscall.

The following snippets are sprinkled all over the place in kcov traces
in a debugging kernel.  We already try to disable instrumentation of
stack unwinding code and of most debug facilities.  I guess we did not
use fault-inject.c at the time, and stacktrace.c was somehow missed (or
something has changed in kernel/configs).  This change both speeds up
kcov (kernel doesn't need to store these PCs, user-space doesn't need to
process them) and frees trace buffer capacity for more useful coverage.
