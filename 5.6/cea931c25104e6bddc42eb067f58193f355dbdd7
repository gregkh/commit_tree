clocksource: davinci: only enable clockevents once tim34 is initialized

The DM365 platform has a strange quirk (only present when using ancient
u-boot - mainline u-boot v2013.01 and later works fine) where if we
enable the second half of the timer in periodic mode before we do its
initialization - the time won't start flowing and we can't boot.

When using more recent u-boot, we can enable the timer, then reinitialize
it and all works fine.

To work around this issue only enable clockevents once tim34 is
initialized i.e. move clockevents_config_and_register() below tim34
initialization.
