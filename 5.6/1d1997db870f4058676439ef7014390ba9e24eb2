Revert "nfp: abm: fix memory leak in nfp_abm_u32_knode_replace"

This reverts commit 78beef629fd9 ("nfp: abm: fix memory leak in
nfp_abm_u32_knode_replace").

The quoted commit does not fix anything and resulted in a bogus
CVE-2019-19076.

If match is NULL then it is known there is no matching entry in
list, hence, calling nfp_abm_u32_knode_delete() is pointless.
