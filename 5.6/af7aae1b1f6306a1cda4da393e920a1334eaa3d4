ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: move i915 init earlier

To be compliant with i915 display driver requirements, i915 power-up
must be done before any HDA communication takes place, including
parsing the bus capabilities. Otherwise the initial codec probe
may fail.

Move i915 initialization earlier in the SOF HDA sequence. This
sequence is now aligned with the snd-hda-intel driver where the
display_power() call is before snd_hdac_bus_parse_capabilities()
and rest of the capability parsing.

Also remove unnecessary ifdef around hda_codec_i915_init(). There's
a dummy implementation provided if CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_HDA is not
enabled.
