pinctrl: baytrail: Replace WARN with dev_info_once when setting direct-irq pin to output

Suspending Goodix touchscreens requires changing the interrupt pin to
output before sending them a power-down command. Followed by wiggling
the interrupt pin to wake the device up, after which it is put back
in input mode.

On Cherry Trail device the interrupt pin is listed as a GpioInt ACPI
resource so we can do this without problems as long as we release the
IRQ before changing the pin to output mode.

On Bay Trail devices with a Goodix touchscreen direct-irq mode is used
in combination with listing the pin as a normal GpioIo resource. This
works fine, but this triggers the WARN in byt_gpio_set_direction-s output
path because direct-irq support is enabled on the pin.

This commit replaces the WARN call with a dev_info_once call, fixing a
bunch of WARN splats in dmesg on each suspend/resume cycle.
