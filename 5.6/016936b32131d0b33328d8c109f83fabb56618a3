fs/adfs: dir: use pointers to access directory head/tails

Add and use pointers in the adfs_dir structure to access the directory
head and tail structures, which will always be contiguous in a buffer.
This allows us to avoid memcpy()ing the data in the new directory code,
making it slightly more efficient.
