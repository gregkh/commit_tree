blk-mq: insert passthrough request into hctx->dispatch directly

For some reason, device may be in one situation which can't handle
FS request, so STS_RESOURCE is always returned and the FS request
will be added to hctx->dispatch. However passthrough request may
be required at that time for fixing the problem. If passthrough
request is added to scheduler queue, there isn't any chance for
blk-mq to dispatch it given we prioritize requests in hctx->dispatch.
Then the FS IO request may never be completed, and IO hang is caused.

So passthrough request has to be added to hctx->dispatch directly
for fixing the IO hang.

Fix this issue by inserting passthrough request into hctx->dispatch
directly together withing adding FS request to the tail of
hctx->dispatch in blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list(). Actually we add FS request
to tail of hctx->dispatch at default, see blk_mq_request_bypass_insert().

Then it becomes consistent with original legacy IO request
path, in which passthrough request is always added to q->queue_head.
