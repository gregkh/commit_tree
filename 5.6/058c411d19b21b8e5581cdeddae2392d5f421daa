iwlwifi: yoyo: remove unnecessary active triggers status flag

Now that we can't change the domain at runtime anymore, we don't have
to protect the active trigger status.  Remove it.  Additionally, we
don't need to flush the dumps at this point anymore, since this only
runs during initialization and there shouldn't be any dumps running.
