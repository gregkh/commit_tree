arm64: Workaround for Cortex-A55 erratum 1530923

Cortex-A55 erratum 1530923 allows TLB entries to be allocated as a
result of a speculative AT instruction. This may happen in the middle of
a guest world switch while the relevant VMSA configuration is in an
inconsistent state, leading to erroneous content being allocated into
TLBs.

The same workaround as is used for Cortex-A76 erratum 1165522
(WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_AT_VHE) can be used here. Note that this
mandates the use of VHE on affected parts.
