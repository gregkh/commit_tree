Revert "powerpc/pseries/iommu: Don't use dma_iommu_ops on secure guests"

This reverts commit edea902c1c1efb855f77e041f9daf1abe7a9768a.

At the time the change allowed direct DMA ops for secure VMs; however
since then we switched on using SWIOTLB backed with IOMMU (direct mapping)
and to make this work, we need dma_iommu_ops which handles all cases
including TCE mapping I/O pages in the presence of an IOMMU.
