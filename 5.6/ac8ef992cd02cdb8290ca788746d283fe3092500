KVM: X86: Drop KVM_APIC_SHORT_MASK and KVM_APIC_DEST_MASK

We have both APIC_SHORT_MASK and KVM_APIC_SHORT_MASK defined for the
shorthand mask.  Similarly, we have both APIC_DEST_MASK and
KVM_APIC_DEST_MASK defined for the destination mode mask.

Drop the KVM_APIC_* macros and replace the only user of them to use
the APIC_DEST_* macros instead.  At the meantime, move APIC_SHORT_MASK
and APIC_DEST_MASK from lapic.c to lapic.h.
