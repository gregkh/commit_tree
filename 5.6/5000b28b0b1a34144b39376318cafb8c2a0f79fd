tcp: Cleanup duplicate initialization of sk->sk_state.

When a TCP socket is created, sk->sk_state is initialized twice as
TCP_CLOSE in sock_init_data() and tcp_init_sock(). The tcp_init_sock() is
always called after the sock_init_data(), so it is not necessary to update
sk->sk_state in the tcp_init_sock().

Before v2.1.8, the code of the two functions was in the inet_create(). In
the patch of v2.1.8, the tcp_v4/v6_init_sock() were added and the code of
initialization of sk->state was duplicated.
