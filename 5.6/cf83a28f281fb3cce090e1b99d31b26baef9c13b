clk: tegra: divider: Check UART's divider enable-bit state on rate's recalculation

UART clock is divided using divisor values from DLM/DLL registers when
enable-bit is unset in clk register and clk's divider configuration isn't
taken onto account in this case. This doesn't cause any problems, but
let's add a check for the divider's enable-bit state, for consistency.
