drm/amd/display: MST DSC compute fair share

If there is limited link bandwidth on a MST network,
it must be divided fairly between the streams on that network

Implement an algorithm to determine the correct DSC config
for each stream

The algorithm:
This
     [                   ]          ( )
represents the range of bandwidths possible for a given stream.
The [] area represents the range of DSC configs, and the ()
represents no DSC. The bandwidth used increases from left to right.

First, try disabling DSC on all streams
     [                  ]          (|)
     [                     ]            (|)
Check this against the bandwidth limits of the link and each branch
(including each endpoint). If it passes, the job is done

Second, try maximum DSC compression on all streams
that support DSC
     [|         ]        ( )
     [|                ]         ( )
If this does not pass, then enabling this combination of streams
is impossible

Otherwise, divide the remaining bandwidth evenly amongst the streams
     [        |  ]         ( )
     [        |      ]        ( )

If one or more of the streams reach minimum compression, evenly
divide the reamining bandwidth amongst the remaining streams
     [    |] ( )
     [       |]   ( )
     [                 |   ]               ( )
     [                 |      ]                  ( )

If all streams can reach minimum compression, disable compression
greedily
     [      |]  ( )
     [        |]    ( )
     [                 ]                                (|)

Perform this algorithm on each full update, on each MST link
with at least one DSC stream on it

After the configs are computed, call
dcn20_add_dsc_to_stream_resource on each stream with DSC enabled.
It is only after all streams are created that we can know which
of them will need DSC.

Do all of this at the end of amdgpu atomic check.  If it fails,
fail check; This combination of timings cannot be supported.

v2: Use drm_dp_mst_atomic_check to validate bw for certain dsc
configurations

v3: Use dc_dsc_policy structure to get min and max bpp rate
for DSC configuration
