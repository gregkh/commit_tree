ASoC: soc-core: remove duplicate pinctrl operation when suspend

snd_soc_suspend() are doing below for pinctrl_pm_select_sleep_state()

	int snd_soc_suspend(struct device *dev)
	{
		...
		for_each_card_components(card, component) {
			...
(1)			pinctrl_pm_select_sleep_state(component->dev);
		}

		for_each_card_rtds(card, rtd) {
			...
(2)			pinctrl_pm_select_sleep_state(cpu_dai->dev);
		}
	}

(1) is called for all component (CPU/Codec/Platform), and
(2) is called for CPU DAIs.
Here, component->dev is same as dai->dev.
This means, it is called in duplicate on CPU case.
This patch removes (2).
