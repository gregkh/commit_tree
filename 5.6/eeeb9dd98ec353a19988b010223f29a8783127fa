fs/adfs: inode: update timestamps to centisecond precision

Despite ADFS timestamps having centi-second granularity, and Linux
gaining fine-grained timestamp support in v2.5.48, fs/adfs was never
updated.

Update fs/adfs to centi-second support, and ensure that the inode ctime
always reflects what is written in underlying media.
