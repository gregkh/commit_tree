crypto: algapi - remove obsoleted instance creation helpers

Remove lots of helper functions that were previously used for
instantiating crypto templates, but are now unused:

- crypto_get_attr_alg() and similar functions looked up an inner
  algorithm directly from a template parameter.  These were replaced
  with getting the algorithm's name, then calling crypto_grab_*().

- crypto_init_spawn2() and similar functions initialized a spawn, given
  an algorithm.  Similarly, these were replaced with crypto_grab_*().

- crypto_alloc_instance() and similar functions allocated an instance
  with a single spawn, given the inner algorithm.  These aren't useful
  anymore since crypto_grab_*() need the instance allocated first.
