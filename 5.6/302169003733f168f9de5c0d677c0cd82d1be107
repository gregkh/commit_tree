drm/amd/display: split rxstatus for hdmi and dp

[Why]
Currently we share rxstatus between HDMI and DP, so we use 16bits
The drm defines work with 1bytes at a time. So we need to
split the HDMI rxstatus into 2bytes before we can use drm defines

[How]
-create rxstatus for dp and hdmi. rxstatus for hdmi is split into bytes
using arrays.
-use drm_hdcp defines for the remaining structs
