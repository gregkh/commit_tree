drm/i915/pmu: Only use exclusive mmio access for gen7

On gen7, we have to avoid concurrent access to the same mmio cacheline,
and so coordinate all mmio access with the uncore->lock. However, for
pmu, we want to avoid perturbing the system and disabling interrupts
unnecessarily, so restrict the w/a to gen7 where it is requied to
prevent machine hangs.
