scsi: ufs: Use UFS device indicated maximum LU number

According to Jedec standard UFS 3.0 and UFS 2.1 Spec, Maximum number of
logical units supported by the UFS device is indicated by parameter
bMaxNumberLU in Geometry Descriptor. This patch is to delete current hard
code macro definition of UFS_UPIU_MAX_GENERAL_LUN, and switch to use device
indicated number instead.
