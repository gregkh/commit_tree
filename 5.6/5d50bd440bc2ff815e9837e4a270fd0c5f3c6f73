drm/udl: Make udl driver depend on CONFIG_USB

The udl driver for DisplayLink devices depends on support for host-side
USB controllers, which is enabled with CONFIG_USB. Plain USB support as
given by CONFIG_USB_SUPPORT is not sufficient.

This patch changes dependencies for udl to depend on CONFIG_USB, instead
of CONFIG_USB_SUPPORT. Users will have to enable CONFIG_USB and select a
USB host controller. With this change udl dependencies work the same way
as dependencies for PCI drivers.
