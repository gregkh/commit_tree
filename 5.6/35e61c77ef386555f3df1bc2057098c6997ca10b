arm64: asm: Add new-style position independent function annotations

As part of an effort to make the annotations in assembly code clearer and
more consistent new macros have been introduced, including replacements
for ENTRY() and ENDPROC().

On arm64 we have ENDPIPROC(), a custom version of ENDPROC() which is
used for code that will need to run in position independent environments
like EFI, it creates an alias for the function with the prefix __pi_ and
then emits the standard ENDPROC. Add new-style macros to replace this
which expand to the standard SYM_FUNC_*() and SYM_FUNC_ALIAS_*(),
resulting in the same object code. These are added in linkage.h for
consistency with where the generic assembler code has its macros.
