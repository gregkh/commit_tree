drm/edid: Add aspect ratios to HDMI 4K modes

[Why]
HDMI 2.0 adds aspect ratio attribute to distinguish different
4k modes. According to Appendix E of HDMI 2.0 spec, source should
use VSIF to indicate video mode only when the mode is one defined
in HDMI 1.4b 4K modes. Otherwise, use AVI infoframes to convey VIC.

Current code doesn't take aspect ratio into consideration while
constructing avi infoframe. Should modify that.

[How]
Inherit Ville Syrj채l채's work
"drm/edid: Prep for HDMI VIC aspect ratio" at
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11174639/

Add picture_aspect_ratio attributes to edid_4k_modes[] and
construct VIC and HDMI_VIC by taking aspect ratio into
consideration.

v2: Correct missing initializer error at adding aspect ratio of
SMPTE mode.
