Bluetooth: hci_qca: Collect controller memory dump during SSR

We will collect the ramdump of BT controller when hardware error event
received before rebooting the HCI layer. Before restarting a subsystem
or a process running on a subsystem, it is often required to request
either a subsystem or a process to perform proper cache dump and
software failure reason into a memory buffer which application
processor can retrieve afterwards. SW developers can often provide
initial investigation by looking into that debugging information.
