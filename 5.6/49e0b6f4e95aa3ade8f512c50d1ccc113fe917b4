perf beauty sockaddr: Fix augmented syscall format warning

The sockaddr related examples given in
`tools/perf/examples/bpf/augmented_syscalls.c` almost always use `long`s
to represent most of their fields.

However, `size_t syscall_arg__scnprintf_sockaddr(..)` has a `scnprintf`
call that uses `"%#x"` as format string.

This throws a warning (whenever the syscall argument is `unsigned
long`).

Added `l` identifier to indicate that the `arg->value` is an unsigned
long.

Not sure about the complications of this with x86 though.
