ice: Fix VF link state when it's IFLA_VF_LINK_STATE_AUTO

Currently the flow for ice_set_vf_link_state() is not configuring link
the same as all other VF link configuration flows. Fix this by only
setting the necessary VF members in ice_set_vf_link_state() and then
call ice_vc_notify_link_state() to actually configure link for the
VF. This made ice_set_pfe_link_forced() unnecessary, so it was
deleted. Also, this commonizes the link flows for the VF to all call
ice_vc_notify_link_state().
