cpuidle: psci: Add a helper to attach a CPU to its PM domain

Introduce a PSCI DT helper function, psci_dt_attach_cpu(), which takes a
CPU number as an in-parameter and tries to attach the CPU's struct device
to its corresponding PM domain.

Let's makes use of dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name(), as it allows us to
specify "psci" as the "name" of the PM domain to attach to. Additionally,
let's also prepare the attached device to be power managed via runtime PM.

Note that, the implementation of the new helper function is in a new
separate c-file, which may seems a bit too much at this point. However,
subsequent changes that implements the remaining part of the PM domain
support for cpuidle-psci, helps to justify this split.
