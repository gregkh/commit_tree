IB: Allow calls to ib_umem_get from kernel ULPs

So far the assumption was that ib_umem_get() and ib_umem_odp_get()
are called from flows that start in UVERBS and therefore has a user
context. This assumption restricts flows that are initiated by ULPs
and need the service that ib_umem_get() provides.

This patch changes ib_umem_get() and ib_umem_odp_get() to get IB device
directly by relying on the fact that both UVERBS and ULPs sets that
field correctly.
