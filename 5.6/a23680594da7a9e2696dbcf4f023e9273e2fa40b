pinctrl: baytrail: Do not clear IRQ flags on direct-irq enabled pins

Suspending Goodix touchscreens requires changing the interrupt pin to
output before sending them a power-down command. Followed by wiggling
the interrupt pin to wake the device up, after which it is put back
in input mode.

On Bay Trail devices with a Goodix touchscreen direct-irq mode is used
in combination with listing the pin as a normal GpioIo resource.

This works fine, until the goodix driver gets rmmod-ed and then insmod-ed
again. In this case byt_gpio_disable_free() calls
byt_gpio_clear_triggering() which clears the IRQ flags and after that the
(direct) IRQ no longer triggers.

This commit fixes this by adding a check for the BYT_DIRECT_IRQ_EN flag
to byt_gpio_clear_triggering().

Note that byt_gpio_clear_triggering() only gets called from
byt_gpio_disable_free() for direct-irq enabled pins, as these are excluded
from the irq_valid mask by byt_init_irq_valid_mask().
