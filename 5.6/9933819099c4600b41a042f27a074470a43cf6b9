powerpc/32s: Fix CPU wake-up from sleep mode

Commit f7354ccac844 ("powerpc/32: Remove CURRENT_THREAD_INFO and
rename TI_CPU") broke the CPU wake-up from sleep mode (i.e. when
_TLF_SLEEPING is set) by delaying the tovirt(r2, r2).

This is because r2 is not restored by fast_exception_return. It used
to work (by chance ?) because CPU wake-up interrupt never comes from
user, so r2 is expected to point to 'current' on return.

Commit e2fb9f544431 ("powerpc/32: Prepare for Kernel Userspace Access
Protection") broke it even more by clobbering r0 which is not
restored by fast_exception_return either.

Use r6 instead of r0. This is possible because r3-r6 are restored by
fast_exception_return and only r3-r5 are used for exception arguments.

For r2 it could be converted back to virtual address, but stay on the
safe side and restore it from the stack instead. It should be live
in the cache at that moment, so loading from the stack should make
no difference compared to converting it from phys to virt.
