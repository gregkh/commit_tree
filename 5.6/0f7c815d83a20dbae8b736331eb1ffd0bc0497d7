mmc: core: Rework cd-gpio handling

There are a few places around the code that invert inverted and possibly
inverted CD line. That's really confusing. Squash them all into one place
in mmc_gpiod_request_cd(). MMC_CAP2_CD_ACTIVE_HIGH is used analogously to
WP line: in GPIO mode it is used only at probe time to switch polarity, for
native mode it is left as is.
