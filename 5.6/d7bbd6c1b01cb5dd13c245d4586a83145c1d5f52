arm64: kbuild: remove compressed images on 'make ARCH=arm64 (dist)clean'

Since v4.3-rc1 commit 0723c05fb75e44 ("arm64: enable more compressed
Image formats"), it is possible to build Image.{bz2,lz4,lzma,lzo}
AArch64 images. However, the commit missed adding support for removing
those images on 'make ARCH=arm64 (dist)clean'.

Fix this by adding them to the target list.
Make sure to match the order of the recipes in the makefile.
