libbpf: Expose BTF-to-C type declaration emitting API

Expose API that allows to emit type declaration and field/variable definition
(if optional field name is specified) in valid C syntax for any provided BTF
type. This is going to be used by bpftool when emitting data section layout as
a struct. As part of making this API useful in a stand-alone fashion, move
initialization of some of the internal btf_dump state to earlier phase.
