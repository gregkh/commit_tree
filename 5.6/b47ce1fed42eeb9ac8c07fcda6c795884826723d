x86/cpu: Detect VMX features on Intel, Centaur and Zhaoxin CPUs

Add an entry in struct cpuinfo_x86 to track VMX capabilities and fill
the capabilities during IA32_FEAT_CTL MSR initialization.

Make the VMX capabilities dependent on IA32_FEAT_CTL and
X86_FEATURE_NAMES so as to avoid unnecessary overhead on CPUs that can't
possibly support VMX, or when /proc/cpuinfo is not available.
