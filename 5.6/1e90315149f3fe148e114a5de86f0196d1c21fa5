btrfs: do not check delayed items are empty for single transaction cleanup

btrfs_assert_delayed_root_empty() will check if the delayed root is
completely empty, but this is a filesystem-wide check.  On cleanup we
may have allowed other transactions to begin, for whatever reason, and
thus the delayed root is not empty.

So remove this check from cleanup_one_transation().  This however can
stay in btrfs_cleanup_transaction(), because it checks only after all of
the transactions have been properly cleaned up, and thus is valid.
