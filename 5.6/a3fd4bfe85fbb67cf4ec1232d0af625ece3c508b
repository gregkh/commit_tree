scsi: zfcp: fix wrong data and display format of SFP+ temperature

When implementing support for retrieval of local diagnostic data from the
FCP channel, the wrong data format was assumed for the temperature of the
local SFP+ connector. The Fibre Channel Link Services (FC-LS-3)
specification is not clear on the format of the stored integer, and only
after consulting the SNIA specification SFF-8472 did we realize it is
stored as two's complement. Thus, the used data and display format is
wrong, and highly misleading for users when the temperature should drop
below 0Â°C (however unlikely that may be).

To fix this, change the data format in `struct fsf_qtcb_bottom_port` from
unsigned to signed, and change the printf format string used to generate
`zfcp_sysfs_adapter_diag_sfp_temperature_show()` from `%hu` to `%hd`.
