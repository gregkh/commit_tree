wireguard: socket: remove extra call to synchronize_net

synchronize_net() is a wrapper around synchronize_rcu(), so there's no
point in having synchronize_net and synchronize_rcu back to back,
despite the documentation comment suggesting maybe it's somewhat useful,
"Wait for packets currently being received to be done." This commit
removes the extra call.
