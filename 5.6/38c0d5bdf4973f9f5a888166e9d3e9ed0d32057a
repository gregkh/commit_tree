USB: serial: ir-usb: fix IrLAP framing

Commit f4a4cbb2047e ("USB: ir-usb: reimplement using generic framework")
switched to using the generic write implementation which may combine
multiple write requests into larger transfers. This can break the IrLAP
protocol where end-of-frame is determined using the USB short packet
mechanism, for example, if multiple frames are sent in rapid succession.
