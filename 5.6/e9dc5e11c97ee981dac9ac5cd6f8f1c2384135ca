scsi: hisi_sas: replace spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_restore with spin_lock/spin_unlock

After changing tasklet to workqueue or threaded irq, some critical
resources are only used on threads (not in interrupt or bottom half of
interrupt), so replace spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_restore with
spin_lock/spin_unlock to protect those critical resources.
