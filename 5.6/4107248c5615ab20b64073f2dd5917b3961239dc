powerpc/eeh_sysfs: ifdef pseries sr-iov sysfs properties

There are several EEH sysfs properties that only exists when the
"ibm,is-open-sriov-pf" property appears in the device tree node of the PCI
device. This used on pseries to indicate to the guest that the hypervisor
allows the guest to configure the SR-IOV capability. Doing this requires
some handshaking between the guest, hypervisor and userspace when a VF is
EEH frozen which is why these properties exist.

This is all dead code on non-pseries platforms so wrap it in an #ifdef
CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES to make the dependency clearer.
