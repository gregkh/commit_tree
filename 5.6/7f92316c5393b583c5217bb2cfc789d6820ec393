s390/qeth: make cmd/reply matching more flexible

When data is received on the READ channel, the matching logic for cmds
that are waiting for a reply is currently hard-coded into the channel's
main IO callback.
Move this into a per-cmd callback, so that we can apply custom matching
logic for each individual cmd.

This also allows us to remove the coarse-grained check for unexpected
non-IPA replies, since they will no longer match against _all_ pending
cmds.

Note that IDX cmds use _no_ matcher, since their reply is synchronously
received as part of the cmd's IO.
