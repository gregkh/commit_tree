cxgb4: fix checks for max queues to allocate

Hardware can support more than 8 queues currently limited by
netif_get_num_default_rss_queues(). So, rework and fix checks for max
number of queues to allocate. The checks should be based on how many are
actually supported by hardware, OR the number of online cpus; whichever
is lower.
