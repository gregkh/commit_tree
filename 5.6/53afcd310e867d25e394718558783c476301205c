ovl: fix some xino configurations

Fix up two bugs in the coversion to xino_mode:
1. xino=off does not always end up in disabled mode
2. xino=auto on 32bit arch should end up in disabled mode

Take a proactive approach to disabling xino on 32bit kernel:
1. Disable XINO_AUTO config during build time
2. Disable xino with a warning on mount time

As a by product, xino=on on 32bit arch also ends up in disabled mode.
We never intended to enable xino on 32bit arch and this will make the
rest of the logic simpler.
