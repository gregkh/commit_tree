uapi: rename ext2_swab() to swab() and share globally in swab.h

ext2_swab() is defined locally in lib/find_bit.c However it is not
specific to ext2, neither to bitmaps.

There are many potential users of it, so rename it to just swab() and
move to include/uapi/linux/swab.h

ABI guarantees that size of unsigned long corresponds to BITS_PER_LONG,
therefore drop unneeded cast.
