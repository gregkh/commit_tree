x86/mm/pat: Clean up PAT initialization flags

Right now we have these variables that impact the PAT initialization sequence:

  pat_disabled
  boot_cpu_done
  pat_initialized
  init_cm_done

Some have a pat_ prefix, some not, and the naming is random,
which makes their purpose rather opaque.

Name them consistently and according to their role:

  pat_disabled
  pat_bp_initialized
  pat_bp_enabled
  pat_cm_initialized

Also rename pat_bsp_init() => pat_bp_init(), to use the canonical
abbreviation.

Also add a warning for double calls of init_cache_modes(), the call chains
leading to this are complex and I couldn't convince myself that we never
call this function twice - so utilize the flag for a debug check.

No change in functionality intended.
