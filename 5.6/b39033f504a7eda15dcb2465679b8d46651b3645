KVM: VMX: Use VMX_FEATURE_* flags to define VMCS control bits

Define the VMCS execution control flags (consumed by KVM) using their
associated VMX_FEATURE_* to provide a strong hint that new VMX features
are expected to be added to VMX_FEATURE and considered for reporting via
/proc/cpuinfo.

No functional change intended.
