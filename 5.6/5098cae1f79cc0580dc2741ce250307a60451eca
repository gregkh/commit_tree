dt-bindings: soundwire: fix example

As wsa881x schema mentions #sound-dai-cells as required property,
so update soundwire-controller.yaml example so that dt_bindings_check
does not fail as below:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soundwire/soundwire-controller.example.dt.yaml:
speaker@0,1: '#sound-dai-cells' is a required property
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soundwire/soundwire-controller.example.dt.yaml:
speaker@0,2: '#sound-dai-cells' is a required property
