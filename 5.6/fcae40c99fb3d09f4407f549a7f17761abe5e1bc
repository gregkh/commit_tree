ALSA: Replace timespec with timespec64

Since timespec is not year 2038 safe on 32bit system, and we need to
convert all timespec variables to timespec64 type for sound subsystem.

This patch is used to do preparation for following patches, that will
convert all structures defined in uapi/sound/asound.h to use 64-bit
time_t.
