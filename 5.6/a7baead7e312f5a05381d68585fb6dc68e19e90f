KVM: x86: Ensure guest's FPU state is loaded when accessing for emulation

Lock the FPU regs and reload the current thread's FPU state, which holds
the guest's FPU state, to the CPU registers if necessary prior to
accessing guest FPU state as part of emulation.  kernel_fpu_begin() can
be called from softirq context, therefore KVM must ensure softirqs are
disabled (locking the FPU regs disables softirqs) when touching CPU FPU
state.

Note, for all intents and purposes this reverts commit 6ab0b9feb82a7
("x86,kvm: remove KVM emulator get_fpu / put_fpu"), but at the time it
was applied, removing get/put_fpu() was correct.  The re-introduction
of {get,put}_fpu() is necessitated by the deferring of FPU state load.
