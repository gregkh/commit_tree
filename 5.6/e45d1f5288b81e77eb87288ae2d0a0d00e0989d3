net: phylink: support Clause 45 PHYs on SFP+ modules

Some SFP+ modules have Clause 45 PHYs embedded on them, which need a
little more handling in order to ensure that they are correctly setup,
as they switch the PHY link mode according to the negotiated speed.

With Clause 22 PHYs, we assumed that they would operate in SGMII mode,
but this assumption is now false.  Adapt phylink to support Clause 45
PHYs on SFP+ modules.
