netfilter: xt_hashlimit: limit the max size of hashtable

The user-specified hashtable size is unbound, this could
easily lead to an OOM or a hung task as we hold the global
mutex while allocating and initializing the new hashtable.

Add a max value to cap both cfg->size and cfg->max, as
suggested by Florian.
