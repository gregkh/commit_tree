drm/exynos: Don't reset bridge->next

bridge->next is only points to the new bridge if drm_bridge_attach()
succeeds. No need to reset it manually here.

Note that this change is part of the attempt to make the bridge chain
a double-linked list. In order to do that we must patch all drivers
manipulating the bridge->next field.
