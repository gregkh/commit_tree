drm/i915/gem: Serialise object before changing cache-level

Wait for the object to be idle before changing its cache-level and
unbinding. This was dropped as supposedly superfluous from commit
8b1c78e06e61 ("drm/i915: Avoid calling i915_gem_object_unbind holding
object lock"), but it turns out to prevent some cache dirt escaping.
Smells like papering over a race...
