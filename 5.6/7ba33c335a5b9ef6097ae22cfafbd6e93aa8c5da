arm64: dts: renesas: Prepare for split of ARCH_R8A7795 into ARCH_R8A7795[01]

As R-Car H3 ES1.x (R8A77950) and R-Car H3 ES2.0+ (R8A77951) are really
different SoCs, CONFIG_ARCH_R8A7795 will be split in
CONFIG_ARCH_R8A77950 and CONFIG_ARCH_R8A77951.

Relax dependencies by handling both the old and the new symbols.
