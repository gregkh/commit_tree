drm: atmel-hlcdc: enable clock before configuring timing engine

Changing pixel clock source without having this clock source enabled
will block the timing engine and the next operations after (in this case
setting ATMEL_HLCDC_CFG(5) settings in atmel_hlcdc_crtc_mode_set_nofb()
will fail). It is recomended (although in datasheet this is not present)
to actually enabled pixel clock source before doing any changes on timing
enginge (only SAM9X60 datasheet specifies that the peripheral clock and
pixel clock must be enabled before using LCD controller).
