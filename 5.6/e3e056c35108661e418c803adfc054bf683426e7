cifs: fix mode bits from dir listing when mounted with modefromsid

When mounting with -o modefromsid, the mode bits are stored in an
ACE. Directory enumeration (e.g. ls -l /mnt) triggers an SMB Query Dir
which does not include ACEs in its response. The mode bits in this
case are silently set to a default value of 755 instead.

This patch marks the dentry created during the directory enumeration
as needing re-evaluation (i.e. additional Query Info with ACEs) so
that the mode bits can be properly extracted.

Quick repro:

$ mount.cifs //win19.test/data /mnt -o ...,modefromsid
$ touch /mnt/foo && chmod 751 /mnt/foo
$ stat /mnt/foo
  # reports 751 (OK)
$ sleep 2
  # dentry older than 1s by default get invalidated
$ ls -l /mnt
  # since dentry invalid, ls does a Query Dir
  # and reports foo as 755 (WRONG)
