arm64: lse: fix LSE atomics with LLVM's integrated assembler

Unlike gcc, clang considers each inline assembly block to be independent
and therefore, when using the integrated assembler for inline assembly,
any preambles that enable features must be repeated in each block.

This change defines __LSE_PREAMBLE and adds it to each inline assembly
block that has LSE instructions, which allows them to be compiled also
with clang's assembler.
