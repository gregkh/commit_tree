Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Disallow set_baudrate for BCM4354

Without updating the patchram, the BCM4354 does not support a higher
operating speed. The normal bcm_setup follows the correct order
(init_speed, patchram and then oper_speed) but the serdev driver will
set the operating speed before calling the hu->setup function. Thus,
for the BCM4354, don't set the operating speed before patchram.
