libbpf: Add BPF object skeleton support

Add new set of APIs, allowing to open/load/attach BPF object through BPF
object skeleton, generated by bpftool for a specific BPF object file. All the
xxx_skeleton() APIs wrap up corresponding bpf_object_xxx() APIs, but
additionally also automate map/program lookups by name, global data
initialization and mmap()-ing, etc.  All this greatly improves and simplifies
userspace usability of working with BPF programs. See follow up patches for
examples.
