perf annotate: Simplify disasm_line allocation and freeing code

We are allocating disasm_line object in annotation_line__new() instead
of disasm_line__new(). Similarly annotation_line__delete() is actually
freeing disasm_line object as well. This complexity is because of
privsize.  But we don't need privsize anymore so get rid of privsize and
simplify disasm_line allocation and freeing code.
