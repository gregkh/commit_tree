dm space map common: fix to ensure new block isn't already in use

The space-maps track the reference counts for disk blocks allocated by
both the thin-provisioning and cache targets.  There are variants for
tracking metadata blocks and data blocks.

Transactionality is implemented by never touching blocks from the
previous transaction, so we can rollback in the event of a crash.

When allocating a new block we need to ensure the block is free (has
reference count of 0) in both the current and previous transaction.
Prior to this fix we were doing this by searching for a free block in
the previous transaction, and relying on a 'begin' counter to track
where the last allocation in the current transaction was.  This
'begin' field was not being updated in all code paths (eg, increment
of a data block reference count due to breaking sharing of a neighbour
block in the same btree leaf).

This fix keeps the 'begin' field, but now it's just a hint to speed up
the search.  Instead the current transaction is searched for a free
block, and then the old transaction is double checked to ensure it's
free.  Much simpler.

This fixes reports of sm_disk_new_block()'s BUG_ON() triggering when
DM thin-provisioning's snapshots are heavily used.
