regulator: vctrl-regulator: Avoid deadlock getting and setting the voltage

`cat /sys/kernel/debug/regulator/regulator_summary` ends on a deadlock
when you have a voltage controlled regulator (vctrl).

The problem is that the vctrl_get_voltage() and vctrl_set_voltage() calls the
regulator_get_voltage() and regulator_set_voltage() and that will try to lock
again the dependent regulators (the regulator supplying the control voltage).

Fix the issue by exporting the unlocked version of the regulator_get_voltage()
and regulator_set_voltage() API so drivers that need it, like the voltage
controlled regulator driver can use it.
