mlxsw: spectrum: Rename MLXSW_REG_QEEC_HIERARCY_* enumerators

These enums want to be named MLXSW_REG_QEEC_HIERARCHY_, but due to a typo
lack the second H. That is confusing and complicates searching.

But actually the enumerators should be named _HR_, because that is how
their enum type is called. So rename them as appropriate.
