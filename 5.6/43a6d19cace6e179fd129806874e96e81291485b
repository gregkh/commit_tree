drm/i915: Pass intel_connector to intel_attached_*()

Life is usually easier when we pass around intel_ types instead
of drm_ types. In this case it might not be, but I think being
consistent is a good thing anyway. Also some of this might get
cleaned up a bit more later as we keep propagating the intel_
types further.
