habanalabs: do not halt CoreSight during hard reset

During hard reset we must not write to the device.
Hence avoid halting CoreSight during user context close if it is done
during hard reset.
In addition, we must not re-enable clock gating afterwards as it was
deliberately disabled in the beginning of the hard reset flow.
