docs: nvdimm: use ReST notation for subsection

The ACPI Device Specific Methods (_DSM) paragraph is intended to be a
subsection of the Submit Checklist Addendum section. Dan Williams however
used Markdown notation for this subsection, which does not parse as
intended in a ReST documentation.

Change the markup to ReST notation, as described in the Specific
guidelines for the kernel documentation section in
Documentation/doc-guide/sphinx.rst.
