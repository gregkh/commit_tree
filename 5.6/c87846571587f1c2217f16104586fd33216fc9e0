remoteproc: use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct fw_rsc_vdev {
	...
        struct fw_rsc_vdev_vring vring[0];
} __packed;

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*rsc) + rsc->num_of_vrings * sizeof(struct fw_rsc_vdev_vring)

with:

struct_size(rsc, vring, rsc->num_of_vrings)
