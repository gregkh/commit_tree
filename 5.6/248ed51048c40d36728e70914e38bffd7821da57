x86/nmi: Remove irq_work from the long duration NMI handler

First, printk() is NMI-context safe now since the safe printk() has been
implemented and it already has an irq_work to make NMI-context safe.

Second, this NMI irq_work actually does not work if a NMI handler causes
panic by watchdog timeout. It has no chance to run in such case, while
the safe printk() will flush its per-cpu buffers before panicking.

While at it, repurpose the irq_work callback into a function which
concentrates the NMI duration checking and makes the code easier to
follow.
