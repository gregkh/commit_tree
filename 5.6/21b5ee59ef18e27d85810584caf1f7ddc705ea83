x86/cpu/amd: Enable the fixed Instructions Retired counter IRPERF

Commit

  aaf248848db50 ("perf/x86/msr: Add AMD IRPERF (Instructions Retired)
		  performance counter")

added support for access to the free-running counter via 'perf -e
msr/irperf/', but when exercised, it always returns a 0 count:

BEFORE:

  $ perf stat -e instructions,msr/irperf/ true

   Performance counter stats for 'true':

             624,833      instructions
                   0      msr/irperf/

Simply set its enable bit - HWCR bit 30 - to make it start counting.

Enablement is restricted to all machines advertising IRPERF capability,
except those susceptible to an erratum that makes the IRPERF return
bad values.

That erratum occurs in Family 17h models 00-1fh [1], but not in F17h
models 20h and above [2].

AFTER (on a family 17h model 31h machine):

  $ perf stat -e instructions,msr/irperf/ true

   Performance counter stats for 'true':

             621,690      instructions
             622,490      msr/irperf/
