btrfs: Remove WARN_ON in walk_log_tree

The log_root passed to walk_log_tree is guaranteed to have its
root_key.objectid always be BTRFS_TREE_LOG_OBJECTID. This is by
merit that all log roots of an ordinary root are allocated in
alloc_log_tree which hard-codes objectid to be BTRFS_TREE_LOG_OBJECTID.

In case walk_log_tree is called for a log tree found by btrfs_read_fs_root
in btrfs_recover_log_trees, that function already ensures
found_key.objectid is BTRFS_TREE_LOG_OBJECTID.

No functional changes.
