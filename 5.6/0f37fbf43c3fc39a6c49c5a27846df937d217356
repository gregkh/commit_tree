ath11k: update tcl cmd descriptor parameters for STA mode

It is observed that ath11k STA mode UL throughput is low.
This is due to packets delivered to FW from TCL instead of TQM.
TCL AST search fail causes packet delivered to FW, fix this by
properly configuring the TCL address search type and ast_hash.
STA UL throughput is improved 10times with 11AC AP.
