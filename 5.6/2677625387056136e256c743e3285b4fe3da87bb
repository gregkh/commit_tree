seg6: fix SRv6 L2 tunnels to use IANA-assigned protocol number

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has recently assigned
a protocol number value of 143 for Ethernet [1].

Before this assignment, encapsulation mechanisms such as Segment Routing
used the IPv6-NoNxt protocol number (59) to indicate that the encapsulated
payload is an Ethernet frame.

In this patch, we add the definition of the Ethernet protocol number to the
kernel headers and update the SRv6 L2 tunnels to use it.
