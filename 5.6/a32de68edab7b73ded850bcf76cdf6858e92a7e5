brcmfmac: Keep OOB wake-interrupt disabled when it shouldn't be enabled

NVIDIA Tegra SoCs do not like when OOB wake is enabled and WiFi interface
is in DOWN state during suspend. This results in a CPU hang on programming
OOB wake-up state of the GPIO controller during of system's suspend.

The solution is trivial: don't enable wake for the OOB interrupt when it
should be disabled.

This fixes hang on Tegra20 (Acer A500) and Tegra30 (Nexus 7) devices which
are using BCM4329 and BCM4330 WiFi chips respectively.
