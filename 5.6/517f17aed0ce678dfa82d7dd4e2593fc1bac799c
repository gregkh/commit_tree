torture: Handle jitter for CPUs that cannot be offlined

Currently, jitter.sh assumes that the underlying hypervisor will be
configured with all CPUs hotpluggable, with the possible exception
of CPU 0.  However, there are installations where the hypervisor
prohibits offlining, which breaks jitter.sh.  This commit therefore
lists the CPUs that cannot be offlined up front, and checks for the
case where no CPU can be offlined in the loop.
