scsi: ufs: Complete pending requests in host reset and restore path

In UFS host reset and restore path, before probe, we stop and start the
host controller once. After host controller is stopped, the pending
requests, if any, are cleared from the doorbell, but no completion IRQ
would be raised due to the hba is stopped.  These pending requests shall be
completed along with the first NOP_OUT command (as it is the first command
which can raise a transfer completion IRQ) sent during probe.  Since the
OCSs of these pending requests are not SUCCESS (because they are not yet
literally finished), their UPIUs shall be dumped. When there are multiple
pending requests, the UPIU dump can be overwhelming and may lead to
stability issues because it is in atomic context.  Therefore, before probe,
complete these pending requests right after host controller is stopped and
silence the UPIU dump from them.
