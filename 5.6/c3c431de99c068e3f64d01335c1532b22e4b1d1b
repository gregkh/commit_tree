dmaengine: Move dma_get_{,any_}slave_channel() to private dmaengine.h

The functions dma_get_slave_channel() and dma_get_any_slave_channel()
are called from DMA engine drivers only.  Hence move their declarations
from the public header file <linux/dmaengine.h> to the private header
file drivers/dma/dmaengine.h.
