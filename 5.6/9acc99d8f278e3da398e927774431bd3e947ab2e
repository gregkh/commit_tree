drm/i915/query: Align flavour of engine data lookup

Commit 750e76b4f9f6 ("drm/i915/gt: Move the [class][inst] lookup for
engines onto the GT") changed the engine query to iterate over uabi
engines but left the buffer size calculation look at the physical engine
count. Difference has no practical consequence but it is nicer to align
both queries.
