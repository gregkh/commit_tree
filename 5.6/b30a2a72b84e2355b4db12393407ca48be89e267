firmware: qcom_scm-64: Move svc/cmd/owner into qcom_scm_desc

Service, command, and owner IDs are all part of qcom_scm_desc struct and
have no special reason to be a function argument (or hard-coded in the
case of owner [1]). Moving them to be part of qcom_scm_desc struct improves
readability.

[1]: Example of SCM function using owner vale other than hard-coded SIP value:
