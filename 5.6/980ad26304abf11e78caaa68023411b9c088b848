io_uring: don't attempt to copy iovec for READ/WRITE

For the non-vectored variant of READV/WRITEV, we don't need to setup an
async io context, and we flag that appropriately in the io_op_defs
array. However, in fixing this for the 5.5 kernel in commit 74566df3a71c
we didn't have these opcodes, so the check there was added just for the
READ_FIXED and WRITE_FIXED opcodes. Replace that check with just a
single check for needing async context, that covers all four of these
read/write variants that don't use an iovec.
