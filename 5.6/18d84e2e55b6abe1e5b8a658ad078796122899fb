MIPS: make CPU_HAS_LOAD_STORE_LR opt-out

CPU_HAS_LOAD_STORE_LR was introduced in 932afdeec18b ("MIPS: Add Kconfig
variable for CPUs with unaligned load/store instructions") to make code
in kernel/unaligned.c and lib/mem{cpy,set}.S more intuitive and give a
possibility to easily add new CPUs without these instruction sets in
future.

Hovewer, this variant is not optimal for mainly two reasons:
* For now, we have 20+ CPUs with such instructions and only two (MIPS R6)
  without. It will obviously be more effective and straightforward to
  have an option for these two rather than for the rest.
* You can easily miss the fact that you need to select this option when
  adding a new CPU, while all processors lacking these sets are
  well-known, so the probability of missing something is way much lower.

We can address both points by turning CPU_HAS_LOAD_STORE_LR into opt-out
CPU_NO_LOAD_STORE_LR. This also makes MIPS root Kconfig more clear and
understandable.
