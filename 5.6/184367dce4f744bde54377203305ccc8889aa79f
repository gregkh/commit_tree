hv_netvsc: Fix XDP refcnt for synthetic and VF NICs

The caller of XDP_SETUP_PROG has already incremented refcnt in
__bpf_prog_get(), so drivers should only increment refcnt by
num_queues - 1.

To fix the issue, update netvsc_xdp_set() to add the correct number
to refcnt.

Hold a refcnt in netvsc_xdp_set()â€™s other caller, netvsc_attach().

And, do the same in netvsc_vf_setxdp(). Otherwise, every time when VF is
removed and added from the host side, the refcnt will be decreased by one,
which may cause page fault when unloading xdp program.
