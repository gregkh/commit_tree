staging/android/ion: delete dma_buf->kmap/unmap implemenation

There's no callers in-tree anymore.

For merging probably best to stuff this into drm-misc, since that's
where the dma-buf heaps will land too. And the resulting conflict
hopefully ensures that dma-buf heaps wont have a new ->kmap/unmap
implemenation.
