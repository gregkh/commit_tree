arm64: dts: renesas: Rename r8a7795{-es1,}* to r8a7795[01]*

Despite using the same compatible values ("r8a7795"-based) because of
historical reasons, R-Car H3 ES1.x (R8A77950) and R-Car H3 ES2.0+
(R8A77951) are really different SoCs, with different part numbers.

Reflect this in the DTS files by changing their base names from
"r8a7795-es1" and "r8a7795" to "r8a77950" resp. "r8a77951".
Drop all "ES" references next to part numbers, as they are implied by
the part numbers, and thus redundant.

Note that DT binding headers, definitions, and compatible values are
not renamed, to preserve backward compatibility.
