devmap: Adjust tracepoint for map-less queue flush

Now that we don't have a reference to a devmap when flushing the device
bulk queue, let's change the the devmap_xmit tracepoint to remote the
map_id and map_index fields entirely. Rearrange the fields so 'drops' and
'sent' stay in the same position in the tracepoint struct, to make it
possible for the xdp_monitor utility to read both the old and the new
format.
