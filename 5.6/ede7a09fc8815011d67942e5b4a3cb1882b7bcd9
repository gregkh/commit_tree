fscrypt: Allow modular crypto algorithms

The commit 643fa9612bf1 ("fscrypt: remove filesystem specific
build config option") removed modular support for fs/crypto.  This
causes the Crypto API to be built-in whenever fscrypt is enabled.
This makes it very difficult for me to test modular builds of
the Crypto API without disabling fscrypt which is a pain.

As fscrypt is still evolving and it's developing new ties with the
fs layer, it's hard to build it as a module for now.

However, the actual algorithms are not required until a filesystem
is mounted.  Therefore we can allow them to be built as modules.
