ARM: dts: ux500: Drop pulls on I2C buses

The I2C block in the Ux500 uses internal pull-ups on the
SoC, in fact it has to: in HS mode, the I2C block will need
to autonomously take control over the pull-up line to do
its job. This can be clearly seen from the SoC manual which
states that the silicon has a line named "en_cspu_hs" which
enables current source pull-up for high speed mode. Another
hint is that the vendor code tree never enabled the pull
up on these lines, despite being deployed on boards that
lack external pull-up resistors.

Tested on the Ux500 reference designs without any problems.
