perf maps: Add missing unlock to maps__insert() error case

`tools/perf/util/map.c` has a function named `maps__insert` that
acquires a write lock if its in multithread context.

Even though this lock is released when function successfully completes,
there's a branch that is executed when `maps_by_name == NULL` that
returns from this function without releasing the write lock.

Added an `up_write` to release the lock when this happens.
