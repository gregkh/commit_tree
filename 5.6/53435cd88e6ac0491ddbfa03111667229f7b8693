Input: edt-ft5x06 - make wakeup-source switchable

Since day one the touch controller acts as wakeup-source. This seems to
be wrong since the device supports deep-sleep mechanism [1] which
requires a reset to leave it. Also some designs won't use the
touchscreen as wakeup-source.

According discussion [2] we decided to break backward compatibility and
go the common way by using the 'wakeup-source' device-property.
