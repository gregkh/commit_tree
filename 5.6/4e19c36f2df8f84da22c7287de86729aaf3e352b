kvm: x86: Introduce APICv inhibit reason bits

There are several reasons in which a VM needs to deactivate APICv
e.g. disable APICv via parameter during module loading, or when
enable Hyper-V SynIC support. Additional inhibit reasons will be
introduced later on when dynamic APICv is supported,

Introduce KVM APICv inhibit reason bits along with a new variable,
apicv_inhibit_reasons, to help keep track of APICv state for each VM,

Initially, the APICV_INHIBIT_REASON_DISABLE bit is used to indicate
the case where APICv is disabled during KVM module load.
(e.g. insmod kvm_amd avic=0 or insmod kvm_intel enable_apicv=0).
