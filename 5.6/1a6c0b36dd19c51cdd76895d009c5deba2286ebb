media: v4l2-core: fix VIDIOC_DQEVENT for time64 ABI

The v4l2_event structure contains a 'struct timespec' member that is
defined by the user space C library, creating an ABI incompatibility
when that gets updated to a 64-bit time_t.

While passing a 32-bit time_t here would be sufficient for CLOCK_MONOTONIC
timestamps, simply redefining the structure to use the kernel's
__kernel_old_timespec would not work for any library that uses a copy
of the linux/videodev2.h header file rather than including the copy from
the latest kernel headers.

This means the kernel has to be changed to handle both versions of the
structure layout on a 32-bit architecture. The easiest way to do this
is during the copy from/to user space.
