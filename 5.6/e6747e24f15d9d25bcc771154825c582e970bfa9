dt-bindings: clock: Fix qcom,gpucc bindings for sdm845/sc7180/msm8998

The qcom,gpucc bindings had a few problems with them:

1. When things were converted to yaml the name of the "gpll0 main"
   clock got changed from "gpll0" to "gpll0_main".  Change it back for
   msm8998.

2. Apparently there is a push not to use purist aliases for clocks but
   instead to just use the internal Qualcomm names.  For sdm845 and
   sc7180 (where the drivers haven't already been changed) move in
   this direction.

Things were also getting complicated harder to deal with by jamming
several SoCs into one file.  Splitting simplifies things.
