drm/nouveau/flcn: move fetching of configuration until first use

We want to be able to register falcons with ACR during the constructor for
the subdev it belongs to, however, we may not have access to the falcon's
registers prior to DEVINIT.

Delay touching registers until the first time the falcon is acquired.

This may temporarily break secboot on non-production boards due to not
being able to determine whether the falcon is in debug or production mode,
the new ACR subdev will not have this issue, and it's not a use-case that's
terribly important for bisectability.
