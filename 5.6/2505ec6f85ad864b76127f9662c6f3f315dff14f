iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Propagate ssid_bits

Now that we support substream IDs, initialize s1cdmax with the number of
SSID bits supported by a master and the SMMU.

Context descriptor tables are allocated once for the first master
attached to a domain. Therefore attaching multiple devices with
different SSID sizes is tricky, and we currently don't support it.

As a future improvement it would be nice to at least support attaching a
SSID-capable device to a domain that isn't using SSID, by reallocating
the SSID table. This would allow supporting a SSID-capable device that
is in the same IOMMU group as a bridge, for example. Varying SSID size
is less of a concern, since the PCIe specification "highly recommends"
that devices supporting PASID implement all 20 bits of it.
