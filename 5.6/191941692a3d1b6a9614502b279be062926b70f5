misc: pvpanic: add crash loaded event

Some users prefer kdump tools to generate guest kernel dumpfile,
at the same time, need a out-of-band kernel panic event.

Currently if booting guest kernel with 'crash_kexec_post_notifiers',
QEMU will receive PVPANIC_PANICKED event and stop VM. If booting
guest kernel without 'crash_kexec_post_notifiers', guest will not
call notifier chain.

Add PVPANIC_CRASH_LOADED bit for pvpanic event, it means that guest
kernel actually hit a kernel panic, but the guest kernel wants to
handle by itself.
