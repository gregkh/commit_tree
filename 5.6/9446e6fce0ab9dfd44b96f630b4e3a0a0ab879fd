KVM: x86: fix WARN_ON check of an unsigned less than zero

The check cpu->hv_clock.system_time < 0 is redundant since system_time
is a u64 and hence can never be less than zero.  But what was actually
meant is to check that the result is positive, since kernel_ns and
v->kvm->arch.kvmclock_offset are both s64.
