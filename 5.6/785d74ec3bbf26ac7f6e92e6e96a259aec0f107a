initramfs: restore default compression behavior

Even though INITRAMFS_SOURCE kconfig option isn't set in most of
defconfigs it is used (set) extensively by various build systems.
Commit f26661e12765 ("initramfs: make initramfs compression choice
non-optional") has changed default compression mode. Previously we
compress initramfs using available compression algorithm. Now
we don't use any compression at all by default.
It significantly increases the image size in case of build system
chooses embedded initramfs. Initially I faced with this issue while
using buildroot.

As of today it's not possible to set preferred compression mode
in target defconfig as this option depends on INITRAMFS_SOURCE
being set. Modification of all build systems either doesn't look
like good option.

Let's instead rewrite initramfs compression mode choices list
the way that "INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_NONE" will be the last option
in the list. In that case it will be chosen only if all other
options (which implements any compression) are not available.
