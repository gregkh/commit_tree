net: bridge: vlan: add basic option setting support

This patch adds support for option modification of single vlans and
ranges. It allows to only modify options, i.e. skip create/delete by
using the BRIDGE_VLAN_INFO_ONLY_OPTS flag. When working with a range
option changes we try to pack the notifications as much as possible.

v2: do full port (all vlans) notification only when creating/deleting
    vlans for compatibility, rework the range detection when changing
    options, add more verbose extack errors and check if a vlan should
    be used (br_vlan_should_use checks)
