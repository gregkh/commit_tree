bpftool: Match maps by name

This patch implements lookup by name for maps and changes the behavior of
lookups by tag to be consistent with prog subcommands.  Similarly to
program subcommands, the show and dump commands will return all maps with
the given name (or tag), whereas other commands will error out if several
maps have the same name (resp. tag).

When a map has BTF info, it is dumped in JSON with available BTF info.
This patch requires that all matched maps have BTF info before switching
the output format to JSON.
