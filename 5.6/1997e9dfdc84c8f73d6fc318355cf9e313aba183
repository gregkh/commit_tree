serial_core: Un-ifdef sysrq SUPPORT_SYSRQ

The SUPPORT_SYSRQ is messy: every .c source should define it before
including "serial_core.h" if sysrq is supported or struct uart_port will
differ in sizes. Also this prevents moving to serial_core.c functions:
uart_handle_sysrq_char(), uart_prepare_sysrq_char(),
uart_unlock_and_check_sysrq().

It doesn't save many bytes in the structure, and a better way to reduce
it's size would be making rs485 and iso7816 pointers.

Introduce `has_sysrq` member to be used by serial line drivers further.
