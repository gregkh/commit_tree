power: reset: at91-poweroff: introduce struct shdwc_reg_config

This driver uses AT91_PMC_MCKR in poweroff() function. But the
SAM9X60's PMC versions maps AT91_PMC_MCKR functionality at different
offset compared to the SAMA5D2's one. This patch prepares the field
so that different AT91_PMC_MCKR's offsets to be introduced in
struct reg_config so that proper offset to be used for AT91_PMC_MCKR
based on compatible string.
