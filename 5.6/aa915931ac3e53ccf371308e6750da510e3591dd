libbpf: Fix readelf output parsing for Fedora

Fedora binutils has been patched to show "other info" for a symbol at the
end of the line. This was done in order to support unmaintained scripts
that would break with the extra info. [1]

This in turn has been done to fix the build of ruby, because of checksec.

As libbpf Makefile is not unmaintained, we can simply deal with either
output format, by just removing the "other info" field, as it always comes
inside brackets.
