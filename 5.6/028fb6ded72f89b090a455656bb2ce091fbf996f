powerpc/configs/skiroot: Drop HID_LOGITECH

Commit bdd08fff4915 ("HID: logitech: Add depends on LEDS_CLASS to
Logitech Kconfig entry") made HID_LOGITECH depend on LEDS_CLASS which
we do not enable, meaning we are not actually enabling those drivers
any more.

The Kconfig help text suggests USB HID compliant Logictech devices
will continue to work without HID_LOGITECH, so just drop it.
