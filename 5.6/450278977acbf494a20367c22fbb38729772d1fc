samples/bpf: Set -fno-stack-protector when building BPF programs

It seems Clang can in some cases turn on stack protection by default, which
doesn't work with BPF. This was reported once before[0], but it seems the
flag to explicitly turn off the stack protector wasn't added to the
Makefile, so do that now.

The symptom of this is compile errors like the following:

error: <unknown>:0:0: in function bpf_prog1 i32 (%struct.__sk_buff*): A call to built-in function '__stack_chk_fail' is not supported.
