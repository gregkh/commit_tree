rtc: ds1343: Do not hardcode SPI mode flags

The current use of mode flags to us SPI_MODE_3 and
SPI_CS_HIGH is fragile: it overwrites anything already
assigned by the SPI core. Change it thusly:

- Just |= the SPI_MODE_3 so we keep other flags
- Assign ^= SPI_CS_HIGH since we might be active high
  already, and that is usually the case with GPIOs used
  for chip select, even if they are in practice active low.

Add a comment clarifying why ^= SPI_CS_HIGH is the right
choice here.
