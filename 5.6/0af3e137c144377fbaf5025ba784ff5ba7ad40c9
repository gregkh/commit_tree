clocksource/drivers/hyper-v: Untangle stimers and timesync from clocksources

hyperv_timer.c exports hyperv_cs, which is used by stimers and the
timesync mechanism.  However, the clocksource dependency is not
needed: these mechanisms only depend on the partition reference
counter (which can be read via a MSR or via the TSC Reference Page).

Introduce the (function) pointer hv_read_reference_counter, as an
embodiment of the partition reference counter read, and export it
in place of the hyperv_cs pointer.  The latter can be removed.

This should clarify that there's no relationship between Hyper-V
stimers & timesync and the Linux clocksource abstractions.  No
functional or semantic change.
