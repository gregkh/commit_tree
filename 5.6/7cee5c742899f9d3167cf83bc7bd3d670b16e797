arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Fix node order

The SC7180 device tree nodes should be ordered by address. Re-shuffle
some nodes which currently don't follow this convention.

Since we are already moving it add a missing leading zero to the
address in the 'reg' property of the 'interrupt-controller@b220000'
node.
