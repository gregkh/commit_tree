hwmon: (pmbus/ltc2978) Fix PMBus polling of MFR_COMMON definitions.

Change 21537dc driver PMBus polling of MFR_COMMON from bits 5/4 to
bits 6/5. This fixs a LTC297X family bug where polling always returns
not busy even when the part is busy. This fixes a LTC388X and
LTM467X bug where polling used PEND and NOT_IN_TRANS, and BUSY was
not polled, which can lead to NACKing of commands. LTC388X and
LTM467X modules now poll BUSY and PEND, increasing reliability by
eliminating NACKing of commands.
