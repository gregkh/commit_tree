iio: pressure: bmp280: Drop ACPI support

There is no evidence of officially registered ACPI IDs for these devices.
Thus, revert ACPI support from the driver. All authors of the respective
changes are being informed here:

  d5c94568cc1d ("iio: add bmp280 pressure and temperature driver")
  6dba72eca7fb ("iio: pressure: bmp280: add support for BMP180")
  14beaa8f5ab1 ("iio: pressure: bmp280: add humidity support")

Above seems a cargo cult without paying attention to how ACPI IDs
are being allocated.
