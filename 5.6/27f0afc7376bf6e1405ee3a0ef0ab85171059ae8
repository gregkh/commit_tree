btrfs: ensure removal of discardable_* in free_bitmap()

Most callers of free_bitmap() only call it if bitmap_info->bytes is 0.
However, there are certain cases where we may free the free space cache
via __btrfs_remove_free_space_cache(). This exposes a path where
free_bitmap() is called regardless. This may result in a bad accounting
situation for discardable_bytes and discardable_extents. So, remove the
stats and call btrfs_discard_update_discardable().
