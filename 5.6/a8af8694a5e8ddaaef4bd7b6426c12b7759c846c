RDMA/mlx5: Fix async events cleanup flows

As in the prior patch, the devx code is not fully cleaning up its
event_lists before finishing driver_destroy allowing a later read to
trigger user after free conditions.

Re-arrange things so that the event_list is always empty after destroy and
ensure it remains empty until the file is closed.

Fixes: f7c8416ccea5 ("RDMA/core: Simplify destruction of FD uobjects")
