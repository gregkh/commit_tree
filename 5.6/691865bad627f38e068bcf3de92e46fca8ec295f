clk: qcom: clk-alpha-pll: Add support for Fabia PLL calibration

In the cases where the PLL is not calibrated the PLL could fail to lock.
Add support for prepare ops which would take care of the same.

Fabia PLL user/test control registers might required to be configured, so
add support for configuring them.
