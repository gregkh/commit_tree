btrfs: sysfs, btrfs_sysfs_add_fsid() drop unused argument parent

Commit 24bd69cb ("Btrfs: sysfs: add support to add parent for fsid")
added parent argument in preparation to show the seed fsid under the
sprout fsid as in the patch [1] in the mailing list.

 [1] Btrfs: sysfs: support seed devices in the sysfs layout

But later this idea was superseded by another idea to rename the fsid as
in the commit f93c39970b1d ("btrfs: factor out sysfs code for updating
sprout fsid").

So we don't need parent argument anymore.
