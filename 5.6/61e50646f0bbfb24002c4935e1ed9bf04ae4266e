drm/amd/display: add Pollock IDs, fix Pollock & Dali clk mgr construct

[WHY]
Only a single voltage level should be available to Pollock (min level)
Pollock & Dali get misidentified as Renoir, use wrong clk mgr constructor

[HOW]
Add provided Pollock IDs to ASIC Rev. ID list.
Create new Pollock ASIC RID check, fix RV2 & Dali ASIC checks.
Check RID and set max voltage level to 0 if Pollock is detected.
Work around broken ASICREV_IS_RENOIR, IS_RAVEN2, etc. checks by
performing Dali/Pollock checks before they can be misidentified as RN.
