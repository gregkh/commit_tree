net: ena: Add first_interrupt field to napi struct

The first_interrupt field is accessed in ena_intr_msix_io() upon
receiving an interrupt.The rx_ring and tx_ring fields of napi can
be NULL when receiving interrupt for xdp queues. This patch fixes
the issue by moving the field to the ena_napi struct.
