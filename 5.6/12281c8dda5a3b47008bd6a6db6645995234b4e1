video: fb_defio: preserve user fb_ops

Modifying fb_ops directly to override fb_mmap with fb_deferred_io_mmap
and then resetting it to NULL afterwards causes problems all over the
place. First, it prevents making the fbops member of struct fb_info a
const pointer, which means we can't make struct fb_ops const
anywhere. Second, a few places have to go out of their way to restore
the original fb_mmap pointer that gets reset to NULL.

Since the only user of the fbops->fb_mmap hook is fb_mmap() in fbmem.c,
call fb_deferred_io_mmap() directly when deferred IO is enabled, and
avoid modifying fb_ops altogether.

Simply use info->fbdefio to determine whether deferred IO should be used
or not. This should be accurate enough for all use cases, although
perhaps not pedantically correct.

v2: Simplify considerably by calling fb_deferred_io_mmap() directly
