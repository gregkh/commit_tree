thunderbolt: fix memory leak of object sw

In the case where the call tb_switch_exceeds_max_depth is true
the error reurn path leaks memory in sw.  Fix this by setting
the return error code to -EADDRNOTAVAIL and returning via the
error exit path err_free_sw_ports to free sw. sw has been kzalloc'd
so the free of the NULL sw->ports is fine.
