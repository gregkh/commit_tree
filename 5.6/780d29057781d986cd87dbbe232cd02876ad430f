xfs: fix misuse of the XFS_ATTR_INCOMPLETE flag

XFS_ATTR_INCOMPLETE is a flag in the on-disk attribute format, and thus
in a different namespace as the ATTR_* flags in xfs_da_args.flags.
Switch to using a XFS_DA_OP_INCOMPLETE flag in op_flags instead.  Without
this users might be able to inject this flag into operations using the
attr by handle ioctl.
