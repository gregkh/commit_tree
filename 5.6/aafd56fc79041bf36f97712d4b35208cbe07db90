pinctrl: core: Remove extra kref_get which blocks hogs being freed

kref_init starts with the reference count at 1, which will be balanced
by the pinctrl_put in pinctrl_unregister. The additional kref_get in
pinctrl_claim_hogs will increase this count to 2 and cause the hogs to
not get freed when pinctrl_unregister is called.
