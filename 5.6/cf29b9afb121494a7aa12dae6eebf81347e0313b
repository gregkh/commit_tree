thunderbolt: Add support for Time Management Unit

Time Management Unit (TMU) is included in each USB4 router. It is used
to synchronize time across the USB4 fabric. By default when USB4 router
is plugged to the domain, its TMU is turned off. This differs from
Thunderbolt (1, 2 and 3) devices whose TMU is by default configured to
bi-directional HiFi mode. Since time synchronization is needed for
proper Display Port tunneling this means we need to configure the TMU on
USB4 compliant devices.

The USB4 spec allows some flexibility on how the TMU can be configured.
This makes it possible to enable link power management states (CLx) in
certain topologies, where for example DP tunneling is not used. TMU can
also be re-configured dynamicaly depending on types of tunnels created
over the USB4 fabric.

In this patch we simply configure the TMU to be in bi-directional HiFi
mode. This way we can tunnel any kind of traffic without need to perform
complex steps to re-configure the domain dynamically. We can add more
fine-grained TMU configuration later on when we start enabling CLx
states.
