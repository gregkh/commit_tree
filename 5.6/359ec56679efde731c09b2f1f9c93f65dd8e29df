mlxsw: spectrum: Disable MC_DMAC check in hardware pipeline

The check drops packets if they need to be routed and their multicast
MAC mismatched to their multicast destination IP.

For IPV4:
DMAC is mismatched if it is different from {01-00-5E-0 (25 bits),
DIP[22:0]}

For IPV6:
DMAC is mismatched if it is different from {33-33-0 (16 bits),
DIP[31:0]}

Disable the check since the kernel forwards such packets and does not
drop them.
