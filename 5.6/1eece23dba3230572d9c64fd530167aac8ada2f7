dt-bindings: mmc: convert rockchip dw-mshc bindings to yaml

Current dts files with 'dwmmc' nodes are manually verified.
In order to automate this process rockchip-dw-mshc.txt
has to be converted to yaml. In the new setup
rockchip-dw-mshc.yaml will inherit properties from
mmc-controller.yaml and synopsys-dw-mshc-common.yaml.
'dwmmc' will no longer be a valid name for a node and
should be changed to 'mmc'.
