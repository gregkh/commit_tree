bpftool: Make skeleton C code compilable with C++ compiler

When auto-generated BPF skeleton C code is included from C++ application, it
triggers compilation error due to void * being implicitly casted to whatever
target pointer type. This is supported by C, but not C++. To solve this
problem, add explicit casts, where necessary.

To ensure issues like this are captured going forward, add skeleton usage in
test_cpp test.
