net: phy: dp83640: Move the probe and remove methods around.

An upcoming patch will change how the PHY time stamping functions are
registered with the networking stack, and adapting this driver would
entail adding forward declarations for four time stamping methods.
However, forward declarations are considered to be stylistic defects.
This patch avoids the issue by moving the probe and remove methods
immediately above the phy_driver interface structure.
