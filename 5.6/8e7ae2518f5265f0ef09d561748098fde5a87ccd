bpf: Sanitize the bpf_struct_ops tcp-cc name

The bpf_struct_ops tcp-cc name should be sanitized in order to
avoid problematic chars (e.g. whitespaces).

This patch reuses the bpf_obj_name_cpy() for accepting the same set
of characters in order to keep a consistent bpf programming experience.
A "size" param is added.  Also, the strlen is returned on success so
that the caller (like the bpf_tcp_ca here) can error out on empty name.
The existing callers of the bpf_obj_name_cpy() only need to change the
testing statement to "if (err < 0)".  For all these existing callers,
the err will be overwritten later, so no extra change is needed
for the new strlen return value.

v3:
  - reverse xmas tree style
v2:
  - Save the orig_src to avoid "end - size" (Andrii)
