drm/modes: parse_cmdline: Allow specifying stand-alone options

Some options which can be specified on the commandline, such as
margin_right=..., margin_left=..., etc. are applied not only to the
specified mode, but to all modes. As such it would be nice if the user
can simply say e.g.
video=HDMI-1:margin_right=14,margin_left=24,margin_bottom=36,margin_top=42

This commit refactors drm_mode_parse_command_line_for_connector() to
add support for this, and as a nice side effect also cleans up the
function a bit.
