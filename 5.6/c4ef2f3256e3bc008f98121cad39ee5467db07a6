selftests/bpf: Add send_signal_sched_switch test

Added one test, send_signal_sched_switch, to test bpf_send_signal()
helper triggered by sched/sched_switch tracepoint. This test can be used
to verify kernel deadlocks fixed by the previous commit. The test itself
is heavily borrowed from Commit eac9153f2b58 ("bpf/stackmap: Fix deadlock
with rq_lock in bpf_get_stack()").
