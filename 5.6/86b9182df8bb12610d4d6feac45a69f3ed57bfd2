power/supply: ingenic-battery: Don't change scale if there's only one

The ADC in the JZ4740 can work either in high-precision mode with a 2.5V
range, or in low-precision mode with a 7.5V range. The code in place in
this driver will select the proper scale according to the maximum
voltage of the battery.

The JZ4770 however only has one mode, with a 6.6V range. If only one
scale is available, there's no need to change it (and nothing to change
it to), and trying to do so will fail with -EINVAL.

Fixes: fb24ccfbe1e0 ("power: supply: add Ingenic JZ47xx battery driver.")
