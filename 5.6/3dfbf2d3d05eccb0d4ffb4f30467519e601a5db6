Revert "drm/bridge: Add the necessary bits to support bus format negotiation"

This reverts commit e351e4d5eaec ("drm/bridge: Add the necessary bits
to support bus format negotiation"). Commit 6ed7e9625fa6 ("drm/bridge:
Add a drm_bridge_state object") introduced a circular dependency
between drm.ko and drm_kms_helper.ko which uncovered a misdesign in
how the whole thing was implemented. Let's revert all patches depending
on the bridge_state infrastructure for now.
