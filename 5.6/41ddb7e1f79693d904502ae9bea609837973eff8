cpupower: Revert library ABI changes from commit ae2917093fb60bdc1ed3e

Commit ae2917093fb6 ("tools/power/cpupower: Display boost frequency
separately") modified the library function:

struct cpufreq_available_frequencies
*cpufreq_get_available_frequencies(unsigned int cpu)

to
struct cpufreq_frequencies
*cpufreq_get_frequencies(const char *type, unsigned int cpu)

This patch recovers the old API and implements the new functionality
in a newly introduce method:
struct cpufreq_boost_frequencies
*cpufreq_get_available_frequencies(unsigned int cpu)

This one should get merged into stable kernels back to 5.0 when
the above had been introduced.

Fixes: ae2917093fb6 ("tools/power/cpupower: Display boost frequency separately")
