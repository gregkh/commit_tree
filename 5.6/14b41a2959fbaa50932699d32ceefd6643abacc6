net: stmmac: Delete txtimer in suspend()

When running v5.5 with a rootfs on NFS, memory abort may happen in
the system resume stage:

It's found that stmmac_xmit() and stmmac_resume() sometimes might
run concurrently, possibly resulting in a race condition between
mod_timer() and setup_timer(), being called by stmmac_xmit() and
stmmac_resume() respectively.

Since the resume() runs setup_timer() every time, it'd be safer to
have del_timer_sync() in the suspend() as the counterpart.
