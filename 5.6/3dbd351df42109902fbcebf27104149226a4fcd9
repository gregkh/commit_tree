btrfs: fix possible NULL-pointer dereference in integrity checks

A user reports a possible NULL-pointer dereference in
btrfsic_process_superblock(). We are assigning state->fs_info to a local
fs_info variable and afterwards checking for the presence of state.

While we would BUG_ON() a NULL state anyways, we can also just remove
the local fs_info copy, as fs_info is only used once as the first
argument for btrfs_num_copies(). There we can just pass in
state->fs_info as well.
