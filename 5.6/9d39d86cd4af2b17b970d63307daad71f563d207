ARM: dts: at91: Reenable UART TX pull-ups

Pull-ups for SAM9 UART/USART TX lines were disabled in a previous
commit. However, several chips in the SAM9 family require pull-ups to
prevent the TX lines from falling (and causing an endless break
condition) when the transceiver is disabled.

From the SAM9G20 datasheet, 32.5.1: "To prevent the TXD line from
falling when the USART is disabled, the use of an internal pull up
is mandatory.". This commit reenables the pull-ups for all chips having
that sentence in their datasheets.
