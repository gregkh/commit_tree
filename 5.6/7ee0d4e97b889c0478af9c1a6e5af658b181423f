selftests/bpf: Switch reuseport tests for test_progs framework

The tests were originally written in abort-on-error style. With the switch
to test_progs we can no longer do that. So at the risk of not cleaning up
some resource on failure, we now return to the caller on error.

That said, failure inside one test should not affect others because we run
setup/cleanup before/after every test.
