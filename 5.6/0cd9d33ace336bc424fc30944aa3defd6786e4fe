cgroup: init_tasks shouldn't be linked to the root cgroup

5153faac18d2 ("cgroup: remove cgroup_enable_task_cg_lists()
optimization") removed lazy initialization of css_sets so that new
tasks are always lniked to its css_set. In the process, it incorrectly
ended up adding init_tasks to root css_set. They show up as PID 0's in
root's cgroup.procs triggering warnings in systemd and generally
confusing people.

Fix it by skip css_set linking for init_tasks.
