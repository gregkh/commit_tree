md: introduce a new struct for IO serialization

Obviously, IO serialization could cause the degradation of
performance a lot. In order to reduce the degradation, so a
rb interval tree is added in raid1 to speed up the check of
collision.

So, a rb root is needed in md_rdev, then abstract all the
serialize related members to a new struct (serial_in_rdev),
embed it into md_rdev.

Of course, we need to free the struct if it is not needed
anymore, so rdev/rdevs_uninit_serial are added accordingly.
And they should be called when destroty memory pool or can't
alloc memory.

And we need to consider to call mddev_destroy_serial_pool
in case serialize_policy/write-behind is disabled, bitmap
is destroyed or in __md_stop_writes.
