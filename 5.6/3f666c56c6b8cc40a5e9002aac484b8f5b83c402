dax: Pass dax_dev instead of bdev to dax_writeback_mapping_range()

As of now dax_writeback_mapping_range() takes "struct block_device" as a
parameter and dax_dev is searched from bdev name. This also involves taking
a fresh reference on dax_dev and putting that reference at the end of
function.

We are developing a new filesystem virtio-fs and using dax to access host
page cache directly. But there is no block device. IOW, we want to make
use of dax but want to get rid of this assumption that there is always
a block device associated with dax_dev.

So pass in "struct dax_device" as parameter instead of bdev.

ext2/ext4/xfs are current users and they already have a reference on
dax_device. So there is no need to take reference and drop reference to
dax_device on each call of this function.
