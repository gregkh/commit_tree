smp/up: Make smp_call_function_single() match SMP semantics

In CONFIG_SMP=y kernels, smp_call_function_single() returns -ENXIO when
invoked for a non-existent CPU.  In contrast, in CONFIG_SMP=n kernels,
a splat is emitted and smp_call_function_single() otherwise silently
ignores its "cpu" argument, instead pretending that the caller intended
to have something happen on CPU 0.  Given that there is now code that
expects smp_call_function_single() to return an error if a bad CPU was
specified, this difference in semantics needs to be addressed.

Bring the semantics of the CONFIG_SMP=n version of
smp_call_function_single() into alignment with its CONFIG_SMP=y
counterpart.
