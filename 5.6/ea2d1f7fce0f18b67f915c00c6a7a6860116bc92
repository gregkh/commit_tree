hrtimers: Prepare hrtimer_nanosleep() for time namespaces

clock_nanosleep() accepts absolute values of expiration time when
TIMER_ABSTIME flag is set. This absolute value is inside the task's
time namespace, and has to be converted to the host's time.

There is timens_ktime_to_host() helper for converting time, but
it accepts ktime argument.

As a preparation, make hrtimer_nanosleep() accept a clock value in ktime
instead of timespec64.
