selftests/bpf: Ensure bpf_helper_defs.h are taken from selftests dir

Reorder includes search path to ensure $(OUTPUT) and $(CURDIR) go before
libbpf's directory. Also fix bpf_helpers.h to include bpf_helper_defs.h in
such a way as to leverage includes search path. This allows selftests to not
use libbpf's local and potentially stale bpf_helper_defs.h. It's important
because selftests/bpf's Makefile only re-generates bpf_helper_defs.h in
seltests' output directory, not the one in libbpf's directory.

Also force regeneration of bpf_helper_defs.h when libbpf.a is updated to
reduce staleness.
