ASoC: topology: Fix memleak in soc_tplg_manifest_load()

In case of ABI version mismatch, _manifest needs to be freed as
it is just a copy of the original topology manifest. However, if
a driver manifest handler is defined, that would get executed and
the cleanup is never reached. Fix that by getting the return status
of manifest() instead of returning directly.
