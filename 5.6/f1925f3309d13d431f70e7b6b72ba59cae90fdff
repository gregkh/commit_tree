drm/i915: Use EAGAIN for trylock failures

While not good behaviour, it is, however, established behaviour that we
can punt EAGAIN to userspace if we need to retry the ioctl. When trying
to acquire a mutex, prefer to use EAGAIN to propagate losing the race
so that if it does end up back in userspace, we try again.
