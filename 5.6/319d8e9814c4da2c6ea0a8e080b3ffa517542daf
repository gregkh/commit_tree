drm/bridge: lvds-codec: Simplify panel DT node localisation

The probe function needs to get ahold of the panel device tree
node, and it achieves that by using a combination of
of_graph_get_port_by_id, of_get_child_by_name, and
of_graph_get_remote_port_parent. We can achieve the same goal
by replacing those calls with a call to of_graph_get_remote_node
these days.
