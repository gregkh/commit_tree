btrfs: tree-checker: Refactor root key check into separate function

ROOT_ITEM key check itself is not as simple as single line check, and
will be reused for both ROOT_ITEM and DIR_ITEM/DIR_INDEX location key
check, so refactor such check into check_root_key().

Also since we are here, fix a comment error about ROOT_ITEM offset,
which is transid of snapshot creation, not some "older kernel behavior".
