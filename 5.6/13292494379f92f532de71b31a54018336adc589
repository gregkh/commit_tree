tracing: Make struct ring_buffer less ambiguous

As there's two struct ring_buffers in the kernel, it causes some confusion.
The other one being the perf ring buffer. It was agreed upon that as neither
of the ring buffers are generic enough to be used globally, they should be
renamed as:

   perf's ring_buffer -> perf_buffer
   ftrace's ring_buffer -> trace_buffer

This implements the changes to the ring buffer that ftrace uses.
