btrfs: have multiple discard lists

Non-block group destruction discarding currently only had a single list
with no minimum discard length. This can lead to caravaning more
meaningful discards behind a heavily fragmented block group.

This adds support for multiple lists with minimum discard lengths to
prevent the caravan effect. We promote block groups back up when we
exceed the BTRFS_ASYNC_DISCARD_MAX_FILTER size, currently we support
only 2 lists with filters of 1MB and 32KB respectively.
