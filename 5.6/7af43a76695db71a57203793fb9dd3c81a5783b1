backlight: qcom-wled: Fix unsigned comparison to zero

Fixes coccicheck warning:
./drivers/video/backlight/qcom-wled.c:1104:5-15:
	WARNING: Unsigned expression compared with zero: string_len > 0

The unsigned variable string_len is assigned a return value from the call
to of_property_count_elems_of_size(), which may return negative error code.
