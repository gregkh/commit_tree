powerpc: Implement user_access_begin and friends

Today, when a function like strncpy_from_user() is called,
the userspace access protection is de-activated and re-activated
for every word read.

By implementing user_access_begin and friends, the protection
is de-activated at the beginning of the copy and re-activated at the
end.

Implement user_access_begin(), user_access_end() and
unsafe_get_user(), unsafe_put_user() and unsafe_copy_to_user()

For the time being, we keep user_access_save() and
user_access_restore() as nops.
