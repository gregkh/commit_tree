virtio-pci: check name when counting MSI-X vectors

VQs without a name specified are not valid; they are skipped in the
later loop that assigns MSI-X vectors to queues, but the per_vq_vectors
loop above that counts the required number of vectors previously still
counted any queue with a non-NULL callback as needing a vector.

Add a check to the per_vq_vectors loop so that vectors with no name are
not counted to make the two loops consistent.  This prevents
over-counting unnecessary vectors (e.g. for features which were not
negotiated with the device).
