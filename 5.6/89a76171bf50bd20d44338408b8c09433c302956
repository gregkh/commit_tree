x86/MCE/AMD, EDAC/mce_amd: Add new Load Store unit McaType

Add support for a new version of the Load Store unit bank type as
indicated by its McaType value, which will be present in future SMCA
systems.

Add the new (HWID, MCATYPE) tuple. Reuse the same name, since this is
logically the same to the user.

Also, add the new error descriptions to edac_mce_amd.
