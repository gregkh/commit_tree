drm/i915/gt: Manual rc6 entry upon parking

Now that we rapidly park the GT when the GPU idles, we often find
ourselves idling faster than the RC6 promotion timer. Thus if we tell
the GPU to enter RC6 manually as we park, we can do so quicker (by
around 50ms, half an EI on average) and marginally increase our
powersaving across all execlists platforms.

v2: Now with a selftest to check we can enter RC6 manually
