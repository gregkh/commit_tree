selftests: add openat2(2) selftests

Test all of the various openat2(2) flags. A small stress-test of a
symlink-rename attack is included to show that the protections against
".."-based attacks are sufficient.

The main things these self-tests are enforcing are:

  * The struct+usize ABI for openat2(2) and copy_struct_from_user() to
    ensure that upgrades will be handled gracefully (in addition,
    ensuring that misaligned structures are also handled correctly).

  * The -EINVAL checks for openat2(2) are all correctly handled to avoid
    userspace passing unknown or conflicting flag sets (most
    importantly, ensuring that invalid flag combinations are checked).

  * All of the RESOLVE_* semantics (including errno values) are
    correctly handled with various combinations of paths and flags.

  * RESOLVE_IN_ROOT correctly protects against the symlink rename(2)
    attack that has been responsible for several CVEs (and likely will
    be responsible for several more).
