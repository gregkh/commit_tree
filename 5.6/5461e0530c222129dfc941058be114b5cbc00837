ALSA: pcm: oss: Remove WARNING from snd_pcm_plug_alloc() checks

The return value checks in snd_pcm_plug_alloc() are covered with
snd_BUG_ON() macro that may trigger a kernel WARNING depending on the
kconfig.  But since the error condition can be triggered by a weird
user space parameter passed to OSS layer, we shouldn't give the kernel
stack trace just for that.  As it's a normal error condition, let's
remove snd_BUG_ON() macro usage there.
