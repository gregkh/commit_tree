KVM: arm/arm64: Re-check VMA on detecting a poisoned page

When we check for a poisoned page, we use the VMA to tell userspace
about the looming disaster. But we pass a pointer to this VMA
after having released the mmap_sem, which isn't a good idea.

Instead, stash the shift value that goes with this pfn while
we are holding the mmap_sem.
