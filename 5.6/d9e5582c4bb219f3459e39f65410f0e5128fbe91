ALSA: Avoid using timespec for struct snd_rawmidi_status

The struct snd_rawmidi_status will use 'timespec' type variables to record
timestamp, which is not year 2038 safe on 32bits system.

Thus we introduced 'struct snd_rawmidi_status32' and 'struct snd_rawmidi_status64'
to handle 32bit time_t and 64bit time_t in native mode, which replace
timespec with s64 type.

In compat mode, we renamed or introduced new structures to handle 32bit/64bit
time_t in compatible mode. The 'struct snd_rawmidi_status32' and
snd_rawmidi_ioctl_status32() are used to handle 32bit time_t in compat mode.
'struct compat_snd_rawmidi_status64' is used to handle 64bit time_t.

When glibc changes time_t to 64-bit, any recompiled program will issue ioctl
commands that the kernel does not understand without this patch.
