phylink: Improve error message when validate failed

This should improve the error message when the PHY validate in the MAC
driver failed. I ran into this problem multiple times that I put wrong
interface values into the device tree and was searching why it is
failing with -22 (-EINVAL). This should make it easier to spot the
problem.
