tools/runqslower: Use consistent include paths for libbpf

Fix the runqslower tool to include libbpf header files with the bpf/
prefix, to be consistent with external users of the library. Also ensure
that all includes of exported libbpf header files (those that are exported
on 'make install' of the library) use bracketed includes instead of quoted.

To not break the build, keep the old include path until everything has been
changed to the new one; a subsequent patch will remove that.
