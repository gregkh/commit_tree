pwm: sun4i: Add support for H6 PWM

Now that sun4i PWM driver supports deasserting reset line and enabling
bus clock, support for H6 PWM can be added.

Note that while H6 PWM has two channels, only first one is wired to
output pin. Second channel is used as a clock source to companion AC200
chip which is bundled into same package.
