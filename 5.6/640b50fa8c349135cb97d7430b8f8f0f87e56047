drm/i915: Restore very early GPU reset

In commit d03b224f4252 ("drm/i915/gt: Apply sanitiization just before
resume") the GT sanitization was pulled into the resume path as we need
to know the backend in order to do a full reset prior to resume.
However, it is still imperative that we scrub existing GPU state before
clobbering in our early setup, so restore a minimal GPU reset at the
start of our init sequence.
