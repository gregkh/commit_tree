docs: kvm: Convert api.txt to ReST format

convert api.txt document to ReST format while trying to keep
its format as close as possible with the authors intent, and
avoid adding uneeded markups.

- Use document title and chapter markups;
- Convert tables;
- Add markups for literal blocks;
- use :field: for field descriptions;
- Add blank lines and adjust indentation
