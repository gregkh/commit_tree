crypto: ccm - use crypto_grab_ahash() and simplify error paths

Make the ccm and ccm_base templates use the new function
crypto_grab_ahash() to initialize their ahash spawn.

This is needed to make all spawns be initialized in a consistent way.

Also simplify the error handling by taking advantage of crypto_drop_*()
now accepting (as a no-op) spawns that haven't been initialized yet.
