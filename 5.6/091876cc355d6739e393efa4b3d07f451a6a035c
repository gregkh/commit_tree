phy: ti: j721e-wiz: Add support for WIZ module present in TI J721E SoC

Add support for WIZ module present in TI's J721E SoC. WIZ is a SERDES
wrapper used to configure some of the input signals to the SERDES. It is
used with both Sierra(16G) and Torrent(10G) SERDES. This driver configures
three clock selects (pll0, pll1, dig), two divider clocks and supports
resets for each of the lanes.
