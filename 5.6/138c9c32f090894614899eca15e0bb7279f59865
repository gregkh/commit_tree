spi: spidev: Fix CS polarity if GPIO descriptors are used

Commit f3186dd87669 ("spi: Optionally use GPIO descriptors for CS GPIOs")
amended of_spi_parse_dt() to always set SPI_CS_HIGH for SPI slaves whose
Chip Select is defined by a "cs-gpios" devicetree property.

This change broke userspace applications which issue an SPI_IOC_WR_MODE
ioctl() to an spidev:  Chip Select polarity will be incorrect unless the
application is changed to set SPI_CS_HIGH.  And once changed, it will be
incompatible with kernels not containing the commit.

Fix by setting SPI_CS_HIGH in spidev_ioctl() (under the same conditions
as in of_spi_parse_dt()).
