xsk, net: Make sock_def_readable() have external linkage

XDP sockets use the default implementation of struct sock's
sk_data_ready callback, which is sock_def_readable(). This function
is called in the XDP socket fast-path, and involves a retpoline. By
letting sock_def_readable() have external linkage, and being called
directly, the retpoline can be avoided.
