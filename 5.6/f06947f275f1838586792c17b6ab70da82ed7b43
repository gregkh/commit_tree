usb: usb251xb: fix regulator probe and error handling

Commit 4d7201cda226 ("usb: usb251xb: add vdd supply support") didn't
covered the non-DT use-case and so the regualtor_enable() call during
probe will fail on those platforms. Also the commit didn't handled the
error case correctly.

Move devm_regulator_get() out of usb251xb_get_ofdata() to address the
1st issue. This can be done without worries because devm_regulator_get()
handles the non-DT use-case too. Add devm_add_action_or_reset() to
address the 2nd bug.
