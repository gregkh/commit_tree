mmc: spi: Toggle SPI polarity, do not hardcode it

The code in mmc_spi_initsequence() tries to send a burst with
high chipselect and for this reason hardcodes the device into
SPI_CS_HIGH.

This is not good because the SPI_CS_HIGH flag indicates
logical "asserted" CS not always the physical level. In
some cases the signal is inverted in the GPIO library and
in that case SPI_CS_HIGH is already set, and enforcing
SPI_CS_HIGH again will actually drive it low.

Instead of hard-coding this, toggle the polarity so if the
default is LOW it goes high to assert chipselect but if it
is already high then toggle it low instead.
