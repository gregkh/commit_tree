sched/fair: Fix sgc->{min,max}_capacity calculation for SD_OVERLAP

commit bf475ce0a3dd ("sched/fair: Add per-CPU min capacity to
sched_group_capacity") introduced per-cpu min_capacity.

commit e3d6d0cb66f2 ("sched/fair: Add sched_group per-CPU max capacity")
introduced per-cpu max_capacity.

In the SD_OVERLAP case, the local variable 'capacity' represents the sum
of CPU capacity of all CPUs in the first sched group (sg) of the sched
domain (sd).

It is erroneously used to calculate sg's min and max CPU capacity.
To fix this use capacity_of(cpu) instead of 'capacity'.

The code which achieves this via cpu_rq(cpu)->sd->groups->sgc->capacity
(for rq->sd != NULL) can be removed since it delivers the same value as
capacity_of(cpu) which is currently only used for the (!rq->sd) case
(see update_cpu_capacity()).
An sg of the lowest sd (rq->sd or sd->child == NULL) represents a single
CPU (and hence sg->sgc->capacity == capacity_of(cpu)).
