pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a77965: Fix DU_DOTCLKIN3 drive/bias control

R-Car Gen3 Hardware Manual Errata for Rev. 2.00 of October 24, 2019
changed the configuration bits for drive and bias control for the
DU_DOTCLKIN3 pin on R-Car M3-N, to match the same pin on R-Car H3.
Update the driver to reflect this.

After this, the handling of drive and bias control for the various
DU_DOTCLKINx pins is consistent across all of the R-Car H3, M3-W,
M3-W+, and M3-N SoCs.

Fixes: 86c045c2e4201e94 ("pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a77965: Replace DU_DOTCLKIN2 by DU_DOTCLKIN3")
