nfp: flower: modify pre-tunnel and set tunnel action for ipv6

The IPv4 set tunnel action allows the setting of tunnel metadata such as
the TTL and ToS values. The pre-tunnel action includes the destination IP
address and is used to calculate the next hop from from the neighbour
table.

Much of the IPv4 tunnel actions can be reused for IPv6 tunnels. Change the
names of associated functions and structs to remove the IPv4 identifier
and make minor modifcations to support IPv6 tunnel actions.

Ensure the pre-tunnel action contains the IPv6 address along with an
identifying flag when an IPv6 tunnel action is required.
