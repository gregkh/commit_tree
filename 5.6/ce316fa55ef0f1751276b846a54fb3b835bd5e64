drm/amdgpu: add concurrent baco reset support for XGMI

Currently each XGMI node reset wq does not run in parrallel if bound to same
cpu. Make change to bound the xgmi_reset_work item to different cpus.

XGMI requires all nodes enter into baco within very close proximity before
any node exit baco. So schedule the xgmi_reset_work wq twice for enter/exit
baco respectively.

To use baco for XGMI, PMFW supported for baco on XGMI needs to be involved.

The case that PSP reset and baco reset coexist within an XGMI hive never exist
and is not in the consideration.

v2: define use_baco flag to simplify the code for xgmi baco sequence
