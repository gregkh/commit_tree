crypto: atmel-{aes,sha,tdes} - Retire crypto_platform_data

These drivers no longer need it as they are only probed via DT.
crypto_platform_data was allocated but unused, so remove it.
This is a follow up for:
commit 45a536e3a7e0 ("crypto: atmel-tdes - Retire dma_request_slave_channel_compat()")
commit db28512f48e2 ("crypto: atmel-sha - Retire dma_request_slave_channel_compat()")
commit 62f72cbdcf02 ("crypto: atmel-aes - Retire dma_request_slave_channel_compat()")
