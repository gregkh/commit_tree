usb: dwc3: gadget: Don't send unintended link state change

DCTL.ULSTCHNGREQ is a write-only field. When doing a read-modify-write
to DCTL, the driver must make sure that there's no unintended link state
change request from whatever is read from DCTL.ULSTCHNGREQ. Set link
state change to no-action when the driver writes to DCTL.
