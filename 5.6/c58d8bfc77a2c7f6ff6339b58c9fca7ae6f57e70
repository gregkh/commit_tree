usb: dwc3: gadget: Check END_TRANSFER completion

While the END_TRANSFER command is sent but not completed, any request
dequeue during this time will cause the driver to issue the END_TRANSFER
command. The driver needs to submit the command only once to stop the
controller from processing further. The controller may take more time to
process the same command multiple times unnecessarily. Let's add a flag
DWC3_EP_END_TRANSFER_PENDING to check for this condition.
