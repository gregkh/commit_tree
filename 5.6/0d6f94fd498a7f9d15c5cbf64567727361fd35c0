tools headers UAPI: Update tools's copy of kvm.h headers

Picking the changes from:

  5ef8acbdd687 ("KVM: nVMX: Emulate MTF when performing instruction emulation")

Silencing this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h

No change in tooling ensues, just the x86 kvm tooling gets rebuilt as
those headers are included in its build:

  $ cp arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
  $ make -C tools/perf
  make: Entering directory '/home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf'
    BUILD:   Doing 'make -j12' parallel build

  Auto-detecting system features:
  ...                         dwarf: [ on  ]
  <SNIP>
  ...        disassembler-four-args: [ on  ]

    LD       /tmp/build/perf/perf-in.o

  $

As it doesn't seem to be used there:

  $ grep STATE tools/perf/arch/x86/util/kvm-stat.c
  $

And the 'perf trace' beautifier table generator isn't interested in
these things:

  $ grep regex= tools/perf/trace/beauty/kvm_ioctl.sh
  regex='^#[[:space:]]*define[[:space:]]+KVM_(\w+)[[:space:]]+_IO[RW]*\([[:space:]]*KVMIO[[:space:]]*,[[:space:]]*(0x[[:xdigit:]]+).*'
  $
