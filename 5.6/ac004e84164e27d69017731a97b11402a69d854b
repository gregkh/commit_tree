mlxsw: pci: Wait longer before accessing the device after reset

During initialization the driver issues a reset to the device and waits
for 100ms before checking if the firmware is ready. The waiting is
necessary because before that the device is irresponsive and the first
read can result in a completion timeout.

While 100ms is sufficient for Spectrum-1 and Spectrum-2, it is
insufficient for Spectrum-3.

Fix this by increasing the timeout to 200ms.
