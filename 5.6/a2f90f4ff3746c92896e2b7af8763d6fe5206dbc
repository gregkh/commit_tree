drm/i915/execlists: Reclaim the hanging virtual request

If we encounter a hang on a virtual engine, as we process the hang the
request may already have been moved back to the virtual engine (we are
processing the hang on the physical engine). We need to reclaim the
request from the virtual engine so that the locking is consistent and
local to the real engine on which we will hold the request for error
state capturing.

v2: Pull the reclamation into execlists_hold() and assert that cannot be
called from outside of the reset (i.e. with the tasklet disabled).
v3: Added selftest
v4: Drop the reference owned by the virtual engine
