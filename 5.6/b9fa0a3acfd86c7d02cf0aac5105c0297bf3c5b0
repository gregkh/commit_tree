hwmon: (pmbus/core) Add support for vid mode detection per page bases

Add support for VID protocol detection per page bases, instead of
detecting it based on "PMBU_VOUT" readout from page 0 for all the pages
supported by particular device.
The reason that some devices allows to configure different VID modes
per page within the same device.
Patch modifies the field "vrm_version" within the structure
"pmbus_driver_info" to be per page array.
