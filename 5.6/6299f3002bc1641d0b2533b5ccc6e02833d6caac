ARM: dts: ux500: Add device tree include for AB8505

AB8505 is a slightly newer version of AB8500.
Overall it is quite similar, but there are some differences like
the number of GPIOs and regulators. Therefore we need a separate
device tree definition for devices making use of AB8505.

The AB8500-specific nodes were moved out of ste-dbx5x0.dtsi in
commit a46f7c6762d8 ("ARM: dts: ux500: Move ab8500 nodes to ste-ab8500.dtsi").
Add a new "ste-ab8505.dtsi" device tree include in a similar way.

Keep the battery/charging related sub-devices disabled by default
since they require additional configuration to work correctly.
