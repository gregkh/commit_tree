irqchip/gic-v3-its: Reference to its_invall_cmd descriptor when building INVALL

It looks like an obvious mistake to use its_mapc_cmd descriptor when
building the INVALL command block. It so far worked by luck because
both its_mapc_cmd.col and its_invall_cmd.col sit at the same offset of
the ITS command descriptor, but we should not rely on it.
