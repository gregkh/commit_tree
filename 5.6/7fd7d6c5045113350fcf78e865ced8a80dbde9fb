ALSA: uapi: Fix typos and header inclusion in asound.h

The recent changes in uapi/asoundlib.h caused some build errors in
alsa-lib side because of a typo and the new included files.
Basically asound.h is supposed to be usable also on non-Linux systems,
so we've tried to avoid the Linux-specific include files.

This patch is an attempt to recover from those changes.

Fixes: 3ddee7f88aaf ("ALSA: Avoid using timespec for struct snd_pcm_status")
Fixes: 80fe7430c708 ("ALSA: add new 32-bit layout for snd_pcm_mmap_status/control")
