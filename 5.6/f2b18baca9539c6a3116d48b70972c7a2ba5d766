mac80211: use more bits for ack_frame_id

It turns out that this wasn't a good idea, I hit a test failure in
hwsim due to this. That particular failure was easily worked around,
but it raised questions: if an AP needs to, for example, send action
frames to each connected station, the current limit is nowhere near
enough (especially if those stations are sleeping and the frames are
queued for a while.)

Shuffle around some bits to make more room for ack_frame_id to allow
up to 8192 queued up frames, that's enough for queueing 4 frames to
each connected station, even at the maximum of 2007 stations on a
single AP.

We take the bits from band (which currently only 2 but I leave 3 in
case we add another band) and from the hw_queue, which can only need
4 since it has a limit of 16 queues.
