misc: xilinx_sdfec: add missing __user annotation

The second arg of xsdfec_set_order() is a 'void __user *'
and this pointer is then used in get_user() which expect
a __user pointer.

But get_user() can't be used with a void pointer, it a
pointer to the effective type. This is done here by casting
the argument to a pointer to the effective type but the
__user is missing in the cast.

Fix this by adding the missing __user in the cast.
