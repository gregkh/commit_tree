rxrpc: Fix use-after-free in rxrpc_receive_data()

The subpacket scanning loop in rxrpc_receive_data() references the
subpacket count in the private data part of the sk_buff in the loop
termination condition.  However, when the final subpacket is pasted into
the ring buffer, the function is no longer has a ref on the sk_buff and
should not be looking at sp->* any more.  This point is actually marked in
the code when skb is cleared (but sp is not - which is an error).

Fix this by caching sp->nr_subpackets in a local variable and using that
instead.

Also clear 'sp' to catch accesses after that point.

This can show up as an oops in rxrpc_get_skb() if sp->nr_subpackets gets
trashed by the sk_buff getting freed and reused in the meantime.
