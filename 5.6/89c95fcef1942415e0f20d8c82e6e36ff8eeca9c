tracing: Add trace_array_find/_get() to find instance trace arrays

Add a new trace_array_find() function that can be used to find a trace
array given the instance name, and replace existing code that does the
same thing with it.  Also add trace_array_find_get() which does the
same but returns the trace array after upping its refcount.

Also make both available for use outside of trace.c.
