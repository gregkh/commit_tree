crypto: shash - introduce crypto_grab_shash()

Currently, shash spawns are initialized by using shash_attr_alg() or
crypto_alg_mod_lookup() to look up the shash algorithm, then calling
crypto_init_shash_spawn().

This is different from how skcipher, aead, and akcipher spawns are
initialized (they use crypto_grab_*()), and for no good reason.  This
difference introduces unnecessary complexity.

The crypto_grab_*() functions used to have some problems, like not
holding a reference to the algorithm and requiring the caller to
initialize spawn->base.inst.  But those problems are fixed now.

So, let's introduce crypto_grab_shash() so that we can convert all
templates to the same way of initializing their spawns.
