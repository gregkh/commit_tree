mm/page_alloc.c: initialize memmap of unavailable memory directly

Let's make sure that all memory holes are actually marked PageReserved(),
that page_to_pfn() produces reliable results, and that these pages are not
detected as "mmap" pages due to the mapcount.

E.g., booting a x86-64 QEMU guest with 4160 MB:

[    0.010585] Early memory node ranges
[    0.010586]   node   0: [mem 0x0000000000001000-0x000000000009efff]
[    0.010588]   node   0: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000bffdefff]
[    0.010589]   node   0: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x0000000143ffffff]

max_pfn is 0x144000.

Before this change:

[root@localhost ~]# ./page-types -r -a 0x144000,
             flags      page-count       MB  symbolic-flags                     long-symbolic-flags
0x0000000000000800           16384       64  ___________M_______________________________        mmap
             total           16384       64

After this change:

[root@localhost ~]# ./page-types -r -a 0x144000,
             flags      page-count       MB  symbolic-flags                     long-symbolic-flags
0x0000000100000000           16384       64  ___________________________r_______________        reserved
             total           16384       64

IOW, especially the unavailable physical memory ("memory hole") in the
last section would not get properly marked PageReserved() and is indicated
to be "mmap" memory.

Drop the trace of that function from include/linux/mm.h - nobody else
needs it, and rename it accordingly.

Note: The fake zone/node might not be covered by the zone/node span.  This
is not an urgent issue (for now, we had the same node/zone due to the
zeroing).  We'll need a clean way to mark memory holes (e.g., using a page
type PageHole() if possible or a fake ZONE_INVALID) and eventually stop
marking these memory holes PageReserved().
