x86/resctrl: Check monitoring static key in the MBM overflow handler

Currently, there are three static keys in the resctrl file system:
rdt_mon_enable_key and rdt_alloc_enable_key indicate if the monitoring
feature and the allocation feature are enabled, respectively. The
rdt_enable_key is enabled when either the monitoring feature or the
allocation feature is enabled.

If no monitoring feature is present (either hardware doesn't support a
monitoring feature or the feature is disabled by the kernel command line
option "rdt="), rdt_enable_key is still enabled but rdt_mon_enable_key
is disabled.

MBM is a monitoring feature. The MBM overflow handler intends to
check if the monitoring feature is not enabled for fast return.

So check the rdt_mon_enable_key in it instead of the rdt_enable_key as
former is the more accurate check.
