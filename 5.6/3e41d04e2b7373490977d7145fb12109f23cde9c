net: phy: don't crash in phy_read/_write_mmd without a PHY driver

The APIs can be used by Ethernet drivers without actually loading a PHY
driver. This may become more widespread in the future with 802.3z
compatible MAC PCS devices being locally driven by the MAC driver when
configuring for a PHY mode with in-band negotiation.

Check that drv is not NULL before reading from it.
