perf record: Adapt affinity to machines with #CPUs > 1K

Use struct mmap_cpu_mask type for the tool's thread and mmap data
buffers to overcome current 1024 CPUs mask size limitation of cpu_set_t
type.

Currently glibc's cpu_set_t type has an internal mask size limit of 1024
CPUs.

Moving to the 'struct mmap_cpu_mask' type allows overcoming that limit.

The tools bitmap API is used to manipulate objects of 'struct mmap_cpu_mask'
type.

Committer notes:

To print the 'nbits' struct member we must use %zd, since it is a
size_t, this fixes the build in some toolchains/arches.
