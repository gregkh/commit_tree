arm64: dts: rockchip: enable wifi module at sdio0 on rockpro64

RockPro64 supports an Ampak AP6359SA based wifi/bt combo module.
The BCM4359/9 wifi controller in this module is connected to sdio0,
enable this interface.

Use the in-band sdio irq instead of the out-of-band wifi_host_wake_l
signal since the latter is not working reliably on this board (probably
due to it's PCIe WAKE# connection).
