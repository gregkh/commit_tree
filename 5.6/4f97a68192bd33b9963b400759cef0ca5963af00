ext4: fix support for inode sizes > 1024 bytes

A recent commit, 9803387c55f7 ("ext4: validate the
debug_want_extra_isize mount option at parse time"), moved mount-time
checks around.  One of those changes moved the inode size check before
the blocksize variable was set to the blocksize of the file system.
After 9803387c55f7 was set to the minimum allowable blocksize, which
in practice on most systems would be 1024 bytes.  This cuased file
systems with inode sizes larger than 1024 bytes to be rejected with a
message:

EXT4-fs (sdXX): unsupported inode size: 4096
