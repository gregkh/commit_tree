ceph: remove the extra slashes in the server path

It's possible to pass the mount helper a server path that has more
than one contiguous slash character. For example:

  $ mount -t ceph 192.168.195.165:40176:/// /mnt/cephfs/

In the MDS server side the extra slashes of the server path will be
treated as snap dir, and then we can get the following debug logs:

  ceph:  mount opening path //
  ceph:  open_root_inode opening '//'
  ceph:  fill_trace 0000000059b8a3bc is_dentry 0 is_target 1
  ceph:  alloc_inode 00000000dc4ca00b
  ceph:  get_inode created new inode 00000000dc4ca00b 1.ffffffffffffffff ino 1
  ceph:  get_inode on 1=1.ffffffffffffffff got 00000000dc4ca00b

And then when creating any new file or directory under the mount
point, we can hit the following BUG_ON in ceph_fill_trace():

  BUG_ON(ceph_snap(dir) != dvino.snap);

Have the client ignore the extra slashes in the server path when
mounting. This will also canonicalize the path, so that identical mounts
can be consilidated.

1) "//mydir1///mydir//"
2) "/mydir1/mydir"
3) "/mydir1/mydir/"

Regardless of the internal treatment of these paths, the kernel still
stores the original string including the leading '/' for presentation
to userland.
