libbpf: Add generic bpf_program__attach()

Generalize BPF program attaching and allow libbpf to auto-detect type (and
extra parameters, where applicable) and attach supported BPF program types
based on program sections. Currently this is supported for:
- kprobe/kretprobe;
- tracepoint;
- raw tracepoint;
- tracing programs (typed raw TP/fentry/fexit).

More types support can be trivially added within this framework.
