octeontx2-pf: Attach NIX and NPA block LFs

For a PF to function as a NIC, NPA (for Rx buffers, Tx descriptors etc)
and NIX (for rcv, send and completion queues) are the minimum resources
needed. So request admin function (AF) to attach one each of NIX and NPA
block LFs (local functions).

Only AF can configure a LF's contexts, so request AF to allocate memory
for NPA aura/pool and NIX RQ/SQ/CQ HW contexts. Upon receiving response,
save some of the HW constants like number of pointers per stack page,
size of send queue buffer (SQBs, where SQEs are queued by HW) e.t.c which
are later used to initialize queues.

A HW context here is like a state machine maintained for a descriptor
queue. eg size, head/tail pointers, irq etc etc. HW maintains this in
memory.
