sched/fair: Define sched_idle_cpu() only for SMP configurations

sched_idle_cpu() isn't used for non SMP configuration and with a recent
change, we have started getting following warning:

  kernel/sched/fair.c:5221:12: warning: ‘sched_idle_cpu’ defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

Fix that by defining sched_idle_cpu() only for SMP configurations.

Fixes: 323af6deaf70 ("sched/fair: Load balance aggressively for SCHED_IDLE CPUs")
