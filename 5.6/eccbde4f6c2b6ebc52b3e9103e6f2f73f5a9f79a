kbuild: remove wrong documentation about mandatory-y

This sentence does not make sense in the section about mandatory-y.

This seems to be a copy-paste mistake of commit fcc8487d477a ("uapi:
export all headers under uapi directories").

The correct description would be "The convention is to list one
mandatory-y per line ...".

I just removed it instead of fixing it. If such information is needed,
it could be commented in include/asm-generic/Kbuild and
include/uapi/asm-generic/Kbuild.
