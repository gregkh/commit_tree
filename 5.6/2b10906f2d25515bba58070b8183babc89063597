x86: Remove force_iret()

force_iret() was originally intended to prevent the return to user mode with
the SYSRET or SYSEXIT instructions, in cases where the register state could
have been changed to be incompatible with those instructions.  The entry code
has been significantly reworked since then, and register state is validated
before SYSRET or SYSEXIT are used.  force_iret() no longer serves its original
purpose and can be eliminated.
