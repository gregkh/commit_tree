xtensa: reorganize vectors placement

Allow vectors to be either merged into the kernel .text or put at a
fixed virtual address independently of XIP option. Drop option that
puts vectors at a fixed offset from the kernel text. Add choice to
Kconfig.
Vectors at fixed virtual address may be useful for XIP-aware MTD support
and for noMMU configurations with available IRAM. Configurations without
VECBASE register must put their vectors at specific locations regardless
of the selected option. All other configurations should happily use
merged vectors.
