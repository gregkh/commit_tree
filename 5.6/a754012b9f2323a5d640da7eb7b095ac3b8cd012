drm/i915/execlists: Leave resetting ring to intel_ring

We need to allow concurrent intel_context_unpin, which means avoiding
doing destructive operations like intel_ring_reset(). This was already
fixed for intel_ring_unpin() in commit 0725d9a31869 ("drm/i915/gt: Make
intel_ring_unpin() safe for concurrent pint"), but I overlooked that
execlists_context_unpin() also made the same mistake.
