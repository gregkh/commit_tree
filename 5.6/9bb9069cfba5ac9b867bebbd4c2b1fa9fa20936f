iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Drop __GFP_ZERO flag from DMA allocation

Since commit 518a2f1925c3 ("dma-mapping: zero memory returned from
dma_alloc_*"), dma_alloc_* always initializes memory to zero, so there
is no need to use dma_zalloc_* or pass the __GFP_ZERO flag anymore.

The flag was introduced by commit 04fa26c71be5 ("iommu/arm-smmu: Convert
DMA buffer allocations to the managed API"), since the managed API
didn't provide a dmam_zalloc_coherent() function.
