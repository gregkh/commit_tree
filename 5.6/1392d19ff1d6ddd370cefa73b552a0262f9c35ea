qed: Add abstraction for different hsi values per chip

The number of BTB blocks was modified to be different between the two chip
flavors supported (BB/K2) as a result, this lead to a re-write of selecting
the default hsi value based on the chip.
This patch creates a lookup table for hsi values per chip rather than
ask again and again for every value.
