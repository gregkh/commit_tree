ARM: dma-api: fix max_pfn off-by-one error in __dma_supported()

max_pfn, as set in arch/arm/mm/init.c:

    static void __init find_limits(unsigned long *min,
				   unsigned long *max_low,
				   unsigned long *max_high)
    {
	    *max_low = PFN_DOWN(memblock_get_current_limit());
	    *min = PFN_UP(memblock_start_of_DRAM());
	    *max_high = PFN_DOWN(memblock_end_of_DRAM());
    }

with memblock_end_of_DRAM() pointing to the next byte after DRAM.  As
such, max_pfn points to the PFN after the end of DRAM.

Thus when using max_pfn to check DMA masks, we should subtract one when
checking DMA ranges against it.

Commit 8bf1268f48ad ("ARM: dma-api: fix off-by-one error in
__dma_supported()") fixed the same issue, but missed this spot.

This issue was found while working on the sun4i-csi v4l2 driver on the
Allwinner R40 SoC.  On Allwinner SoCs, DRAM is offset at 0x40000000, and
we are starting to use of_dma_configure() with the "dma-ranges" property
in the device tree to have the DMA API handle the offset.

In this particular instance, dma-ranges was set to the same range as the
actual available (2 GiB) DRAM.  The following error appeared when the
driver attempted to allocate a buffer:

    sun4i-csi 1c09000.csi: Coherent DMA mask 0x7fffffff (pfn 0x40000-0xc0000)
    covers a smaller range of system memory than the DMA zone pfn 0x0-0xc0001
    sun4i-csi 1c09000.csi: dma_alloc_coherent of size 307200 failed

Fixing the off-by-one error makes things work.
