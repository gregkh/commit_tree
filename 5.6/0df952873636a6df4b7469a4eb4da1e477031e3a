mv88e6xxx: Add serdes Rx statistics

If packet checker is enabled in the serdes, then Rx counter registers
start working, and no side effects have been detected.

This patch enables packet checker automatically when powering serdes on,
and exposes Rx counter registers via ethtool statistics interface.

Code partially basded by older attempt by Andrew Lunn.
