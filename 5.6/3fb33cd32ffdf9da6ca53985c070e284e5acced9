drm/i915/selftests: Add coverage of mocs registers

Probe the mocs registers for new contexts and across GPU resets. Similar
to intel_workarounds, we have tables of what register values we expect
to see, so verify that user contexts are affected by them. In the
future, we should add tests similar to intel_sseu to cover dynamic
reconfigurations.
