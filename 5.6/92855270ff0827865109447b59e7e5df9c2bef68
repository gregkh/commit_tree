mm/memcontrol.c: cleanup some useless code

Compound pages handling in mem_cgroup_migrate is more convoluted than
necessary.  The state is duplicated in compound variable and the same
could be achieved by PageTransHuge check which is trivial and
hpage_nr_pages is already PageTransHuge aware.

It is much simpler to just use hpage_nr_pages for nr_pages and replace
the local variable by PageTransHuge check directly
