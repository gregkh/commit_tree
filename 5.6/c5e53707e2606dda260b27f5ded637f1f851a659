drm/amd/display: remove spam DSC log

[why]
add_dsc_to_stream_resource could be called for validation.
Failing validation is completely fine.
However failing it inside commit streams is bad.
This code could be triggered for both contexts.
The function itself cannot distinguish the caller, which
makes it impossible to output the log only in the
meaningful case (commit streams).
