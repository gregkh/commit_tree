perf/x86/intel: Explicitly include asm/io.h to use virt_to_phys()

Through a labyrinthian sequence of includes, usage of virt_to_phys() is
dependent on the include of asm/io.h in asm/realmode.h via asm/acpi.h.
Explicitly include asm/io.h to break the dependency on realmode.h so
that a future patch can remove the realmode.h include from acpi.h
without breaking the build.
