firmware: qcom_scm: Dynamically support SMCCC and legacy conventions

Dynamically support SMCCCC and legacy conventions by detecting which
convention to use at runtime. qcom_scm_call_atomic and qcom_scm_call can
then be moved in qcom_scm.c and use underlying convention backend as
appropriate. Thus, rename qcom_scm-64,-32 to reflect that they are
backends for -smc and -legacy, respectively.

Also add support for making SCM calls earlier than when SCM driver
probes to support use cases such as qcom_scm_set_cold_boot_addr. Support
is added by lazily initializing the convention and guarding the query
with a spin lock.  The limitation of these early SCM calls is that they
cannot use DMA, as in the case of >4 arguments for SMC convention and
any non-atomic call for legacy convention.
