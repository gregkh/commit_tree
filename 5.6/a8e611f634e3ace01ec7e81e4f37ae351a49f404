arm64: dts: rockchip: Disable HS400 for mmc on rk3399-roc-pc

Working with rootfs on two 128GB mmcs on rk3399-roc-pc.

One (mmc name 128G72, one screw hole) works fine in HS400 mode.
Other (mmc name DJNB4R, firefly on pcb, two screw holes) gets lots of
mmc1: "running CQE recovery", even hangs with damaged fs,
when running under heavy load, e.g. compiling kernel.
Both run fine with HS200.

Disabling CQ with patch mmc: core: Add MMC Command Queue Support kernel parameter [0] did not help.

Therefore I propose to disable HS400 mode on roc-pc for now.
