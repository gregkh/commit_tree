KVM: nVMX: Check GUEST_DR7 on vmentry of nested guests

According to section "Checks on Guest Control Registers, Debug Registers, and
and MSRs" in Intel SDM vol 3C, the following checks are performed on vmentry
of nested guests:

    If the "load debug controls" VM-entry control is 1, bits 63:32 in the DR7
    field must be 0.

In KVM, GUEST_DR7 is set prior to the vmcs02 VM-entry by kvm_set_dr() and the
latter synthesizes a #GP if any bit in the high dword in the former is set.
Hence this field needs to be checked in software.
