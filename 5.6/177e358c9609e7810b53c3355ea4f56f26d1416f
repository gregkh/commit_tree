crypto: inside-secure - Fix hang case on EIP97 with basic DES/3DES ops

This patch fixes another hang case on the EIP97 caused by sending
invalidation tokens to the hardware when doing basic (3)DES ECB/CBC
operations. Invalidation tokens are an EIP197 feature and needed nor
supported by the EIP97. So they should not be sent for that device.
