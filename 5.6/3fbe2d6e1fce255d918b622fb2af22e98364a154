tracing/boot: Add synthetic event support

Add synthetic event node support to boot time tracing.
The synthetic event is a kind of event node, but the group
name is "synthetic".

 - ftrace.event.synthetic.EVENT.fields = FIELD[, FIELD2...]
   Defines new synthetic event with FIELDs. Each field should be
   "type varname".

The synthetic node requires "fields" string arraies, which defines
the fields as same as tracing/synth_events interface.
