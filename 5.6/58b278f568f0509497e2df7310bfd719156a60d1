powerpc: Provide initial documentation for PAPR hcalls

This doc patch provides an initial description of the hcall op-codes
that are used by Linux kernel running as a guest (LPAR) on top of
PowerVM or any other sPAPR compliant hyper-visor (e.g qemu).

Apart from documenting the hcalls the doc-patch also provides a
rudimentary overview of how hcall ABI, how they are issued with the
Linux kernel and how information/control flows between the guest and
hypervisor.
