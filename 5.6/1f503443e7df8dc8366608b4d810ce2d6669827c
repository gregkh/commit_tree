mm/sparse.c: reset section's mem_map when fully deactivated

After commit ba72b4c8cf60 ("mm/sparsemem: support sub-section hotplug"),
when a mem section is fully deactivated, section_mem_map still records
the section's start pfn, which is not used any more and will be
reassigned during re-addition.

In analogy with alloc/free pattern, it is better to clear all fields of
section_mem_map.

Beside this, it breaks the user space tool "makedumpfile" [1], which
makes assumption that a hot-removed section has mem_map as NULL, instead
of checking directly against SECTION_MARKED_PRESENT bit.  (makedumpfile
will be better to change the assumption, and need a patch)

The bug can be reproduced on IBM POWERVM by "drmgr -c mem -r -q 5" ,
trigger a crash, and save vmcore by makedumpfile
