media: v4l2-core: fix compat VIDIOC_DQEVENT for time64 ABI

The native code supports the variant of struct v4l2_event for 64-bit
time_t, so add the compat version as well.

Here, a new incompatibility arises: while almost all 32-bit architectures
now use the same layout as 64-bit architectures and the commands can
simply be passed through, on x86 the internal alignment of v4l2_event
is different because of the 64-bit member in v4l2_event_ctrl.

To handle all architectures, this now requires defining four different
versions of the structure to cover all possible combinations. The compat
handling for VIDIOC_DQEVENT32 and VIDIOC_DQEVENT32_TIME32 is now inside
of an #ifdef so it does not get used on architectures other than x86.
