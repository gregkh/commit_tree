mm/filemap.c: clean up filemap_write_and_wait()

At some point filemap_write_and_wait() and
filemap_write_and_wait_range() got the exact same implementation with
the exception of the range being specified in *_range()

Similar to other functions in fs.h which call *_range(..., 0,
LLONG_MAX), change filemap_write_and_wait() to be a static inline which
calls filemap_write_and_wait_range()
