net: hns3: modify the IRQ name of TQP vector

When rename the net devices, the IRQ number can not be
fetched by the net device name, because the driver request
the IRQ resources only when the vector resource changed, and
the rename operation did not change the vector resources,
so the IRQ name keeps the previous net device name.
So this patch modifies the name of the TQP IRQ as
"pci driver name"-"pci name"-"TxRx"-"index".
