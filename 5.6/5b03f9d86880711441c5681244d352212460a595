drm/dp_mst: Add new quirk for Synaptics MST hubs

Synaptics DP1.4 hubs (BRANCH_ID 0x90CC24) do not
support virtual DPCD registers, but do support DSC.
The DSC caps can be read from the physical aux,
like in SST DSC. These hubs have many different
DEVICE_IDs.  Add a new quirk to detect this case.

v2: Fix error when checking return of drm_dp_read_desc
