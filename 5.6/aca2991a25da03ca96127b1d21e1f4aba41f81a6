rcu: Substitute lookup for bit-twiddling in sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus()

The code in sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus() calculates the current
CPU's mask within its rcu_node structure's bitmasks, but this has
already been computed in the ->grpmask field of that CPU's rcu_data
structure.  This commit therefore just uses this ->grpmask field.
