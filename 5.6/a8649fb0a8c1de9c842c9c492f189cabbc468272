kdb: kdb_current_task shouldn't be exported

The kdb_current_task variable has been declared in
"kernel/debug/kdb/kdb_private.h" since 2010 when kdb was added to the
mainline kernel.  This is not a public header.  There should be no
reason that kdb_current_task should be exported and there are no
in-kernel users that need it.  Remove the export.
