s390/pci: Fix unexpected write combine on resource

In the initial MIO support introduced in

commit 71ba41c9b1d9 ("s390/pci: provide support for MIO instructions")

zpci_map_resource() and zpci_setup_resources() default to using the
mio_wb address as the resource's start address. This means users of the
mapping, which includes most drivers, will get write combining on PCI
Stores. This may lead to problems when drivers expect write through
behavior when not using an explicit ioremap_wc().
