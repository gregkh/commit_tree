xsk: Standardize naming of producer ring access functions

Adopt the naming of the producer ring access functions to have a
similar naming convention as the functions in libbpf, but adapted to
the kernel. You first reserve a number of entries that you later
submit to the global state of the ring. This is much clearer, IMO,
than the one that was in the kernel part. Once renamed, we also
discover that two functions are actually the same, so remove one of
them. Some of the primitive ring submission operations are also the
same so break these out into __xskq_prod_submit that the upper level
ring access functions can use.
