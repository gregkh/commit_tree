nfp: flower: pass flow rule pointer directly to match functions

In kernel 5.1, the flow offload API was introduced along with a helper
function to extract the flow_rule from the TC offload struct. Each of the
match helper functions are passed the offload struct and extract the flow
rule to a local variable.

Simplify the code while also removing the extra compat and local variable
calls by extracting the rule once in the main match handler, and passing
a reference to the rule direct to each helper.

This patch does not change driver functionality.
