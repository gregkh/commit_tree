clocksource/drivers/hyper-v: Reserve PAGE_SIZE space for tsc page

Currently, the reserved size for a tsc page is 4K, which is enough for
communicating with hypervisor. However, in the case where we want to
export the tsc page to userspace (e.g. for vDSO to read the
clocksource), the tsc page should be at least PAGE_SIZE, otherwise, when
PAGE_SIZE is larger than 4K, extra kernel data will be mapped into
userspace, which means leaking kernel information.

Therefore reserve PAGE_SIZE space for tsc_pg as a preparation for the
vDSO support of ARM64 in the future. Also, while at it, replace all
reference to tsc_pg with hv_get_tsc_page() since it should be the only
interface to access tsc page.
