block, bfq: get a ref to a group when adding it to a service tree

BFQ schedules generic entities, which may represent either bfq_queues
or groups of bfq_queues. When an entity is inserted into a service
tree, a reference must be taken, to make sure that the entity does not
disappear while still referred in the tree. Unfortunately, such a
reference is mistakenly taken only if the entity represents a
bfq_queue. This commit takes a reference also in case the entity
represents a group.
