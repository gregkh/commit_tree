ipv6: Notify newly added route if should be offloaded

fib6_add_rt2node() takes care of adding a single route ('struct
fib6_info') to a FIB node. The route in question should only be notified
in case it is added as the first route in the node (lowest metric) or if
it is added as a sibling route to the first route in the node.

The first criterion can be tested by checking if the route is pointed to
by 'fn->leaf'. The second criterion can be tested by checking the new
'notify_sibling_rt' variable that is set when the route is added as a
sibling to the first route in the node.
