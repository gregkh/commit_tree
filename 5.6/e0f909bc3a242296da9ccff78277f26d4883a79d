net: switch to using PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_10GBASER rather than 10GKR

Switch network drivers, phy drivers, and SFP/phylink over to use the
more correct 10GBASE-R, rather than 10GBASE-KR. 10GBASE-KR is backplane
ethernet, which is 10GBASE-R with autonegotiation on top, which our
current usage on the affected platforms does not have.

The only remaining user of PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_10GKR is the Aquantia
PHY, which has a separate mode for 10GBASE-KR.

For Marvell mvpp2, we detect 10GBASE-KR, and rewrite it to 10GBASE-R
for compatibility with existing DT - this is the only network driver
at present that makes use of PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_10GKR.
