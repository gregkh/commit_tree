s390/zcrypt: fix card and queue total counter wrap

The internal statistic counters for the total number of
requests processed per card and per queue used integers. So they do
wrap after a rather huge amount of crypto requests processed. This
patch introduces uint64 counters which should hold much longer but
still may wrap. The sysfs attributes request_count for card and queue
also used only %ld and now display the counter value with %llu.

This is not a security relevant fix. The int overflow which happened
is not in any way exploitable as a security breach.
