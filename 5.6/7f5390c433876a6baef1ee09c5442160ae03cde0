drm/i915/guc/ct: Drop guards in enable/disable calls

We track the status of the GuC much more closely now and we expect the
enable/disable functions to be correctly called only once. If this isn't
true we do want to flag it as a flow failure (via the BUG_ON in the ctch
functions) and not silently ignore the call.
