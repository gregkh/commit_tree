workqueue: add worker function to workqueue_execute_end tracepoint

It's surprising that workqueue_execute_end includes only the work when
its counterpart workqueue_execute_start has both the work and the worker
function.

You can't set a tracing filter or trigger based on the function, and
postprocessing scripts interested in specific functions are harder to
write since they have to remember the work from _start and match it up
with the same field in _end.

Add the function name, taking care to use the copy stashed in the
worker since the work is no longer safe to touch.
