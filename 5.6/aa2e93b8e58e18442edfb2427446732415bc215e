bpf: Add generic support for update and delete batch ops

This commit adds generic support for update and delete batch ops that
can be used for almost all the bpf maps. These commands share the same
UAPI attr that lookup and lookup_and_delete batch ops use and the
syscall commands are:

  BPF_MAP_UPDATE_BATCH
  BPF_MAP_DELETE_BATCH

The main difference between update/delete and lookup batch ops is that
for update/delete keys/values must be specified for userspace and
because of that, neither in_batch nor out_batch are used.
