staging: wfx: drop wdev->output_power

mac80211 and the device are both able to control tx power per vif. But,
the current code retrieve tx power from wfx_config(). So, it does not
allow to setup the tx power independently for each vif. Driver just has
to rely on bss_conf->txpower to get the correct information.

In add, it is no more necessary to protect access to wdev->output_power
with scan_lock.
