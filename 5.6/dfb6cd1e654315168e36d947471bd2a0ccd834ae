tracing: Fix very unlikely race of registering two stat tracers

Looking through old emails in my INBOX, I came across a patch from Luis
Henriques that attempted to fix a race of two stat tracers registering the
same stat trace (extremely unlikely, as this is done in the kernel, and
probably doesn't even exist). The submitted patch wasn't quite right as it
needed to deal with clean up a bit better (if two stat tracers were the
same, it would have the same files).

But to make the code cleaner, all we needed to do is to keep the
all_stat_sessions_mutex held for most of the registering function.
