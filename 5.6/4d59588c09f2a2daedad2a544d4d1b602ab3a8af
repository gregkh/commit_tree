EDAC/sysfs: Remove csrow objects on errors

All created csrow objects must be removed in the error path of
edac_create_csrow_objects(). The objects have been added as devices.

They need to be removed by doing a device_del() *and* put_device() call
to also free their memory. The missing put_device() leaves a memory
leak. Use device_unregister() instead of device_del() which properly
unregisters the device doing both.
