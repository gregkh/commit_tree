btrfs: remove superfluous BUG_ON() in integrity checks

btrfsic_process_superblock() BUG_ON()s if 'state' is NULL. But this can
never happen as the only caller from btrfsic_process_superblock() is
btrfsic_mount() which allocates 'state' some lines above calling
btrfsic_process_superblock() and checks for the allocation to succeed.

Let's just remove the impossible to hit BUG_ON().
