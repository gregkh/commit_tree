selftests: Pass VMLINUX_BTF to runqslower Makefile

Add a VMLINUX_BTF variable with the locally-built path when calling the
runqslower Makefile from selftests. This makes sure a simple 'make'
invocation in the selftests dir works even when there is no BTF information
for the running kernel. Do a wildcard expansion and include the same paths
for BTF for the running kernel as in the runqslower Makefile, to make it
possible to build selftests without having a vmlinux in the local tree.

Also fix the make invocation to use $(OUTPUT)/tools as the destination
directory instead of $(CURDIR)/tools.
