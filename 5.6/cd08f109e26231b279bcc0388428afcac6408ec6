powerpc/32s: Enable CONFIG_VMAP_STACK

A few changes to retrieve DAR and DSISR from struct regs
instead of retrieving them directly, as they may have
changed due to a TLB miss.

Also modifies hash_page() and friends to work with virtual
data addresses instead of physical ones. Same on load_up_fpu()
and load_up_altivec().
