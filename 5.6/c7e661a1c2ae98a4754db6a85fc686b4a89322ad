ALSA: hda - Fix DP-MST support for NVIDIA codecs

If dyn_pcm_assign is set, different jack objects are being created
for pcm and pins.

If dyn_pcm_assign is set, generic_hdmi_build_jack() calls into
add_hdmi_jack_kctl() to create and track separate jack object for
pcm. Like sync_eld_via_acomp(), hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs() also
need to report status change of the pcm jack.

Rename pin_idx_to_jack() to pin_idx_to_pcm_jack(). Update
hdmi_present_sense_via_verbs() to report plug state of pcm jack
object. Unlike sync_eld_via_acomp(), for !acomp drivers the pcm
jack's plug state must be consistent with plug state
of pin's jack.
