ARM: dts: exynos: Adjust bus related OPPs to the values correct for Exynos5422 Odroids

Hardkernel's Odroid XU3/XU4/HC1 boards use bootloader, which configures
top PLLs to the following values: MPLL: 532MHz, CPLL: 666MHz and DPLL:
600MHz.

Adjust all bus related OPPs to the values that are possible to derive
from the top PLL configured by the bootloader. Also add a comment for
each bus describing which PLL is used for it.

The most significant change is the highest rate for wcore bus. It has
been increased to 532MHz as this is the value configured initially by
the bootloader. Also the voltage for this OPP is changed to match the
value set by the bootloader.

This patch finally allows the buses to operate on the rates matching the
values set for each OPP and fixes the following warnings observed on
boot:

exynos-bus: new bus device registered: soc:bus_wcore ( 84000 KHz ~ 400000 KHz)
exynos-bus: new bus device registered: soc:bus_noc ( 67000 KHz ~ 100000 KHz)
exynos-bus: new bus device registered: soc:bus_fsys_apb (100000 KHz ~ 200000 KHz)
...
exynos-bus soc:bus_wcore: dev_pm_opp_set_rate: failed to find current OPP for freq 532000000 (-34)
exynos-bus soc:bus_noc: dev_pm_opp_set_rate: failed to find current OPP for freq 111000000 (-34)
exynos-bus soc:bus_fsys_apb: dev_pm_opp_set_rate: failed to find current OPP for freq 222000000 (-34)

The problem with setting incorrect (in some cases much lower) clock rate
for the defined OPP were there from the beginning, but went unnoticed
because the only way to observe it was to manually check the rate of the
respective clocks. The commit 4294a779bd8d ("PM / devfreq: exynos-bus:
Convert to use dev_pm_opp_set_rate()") finally revealed it, because it
enabled use of the generic code from the OPP framework, which issues the
above mentioned warnings.
