net: dsa: b53: Always use dev->vlan_enabled in b53_configure_vlan()

b53_configure_vlan() is called by the bcm_sf2 driver upon setup and
indirectly through resume as well. During the initial setup, we are
guaranteed that dev->vlan_enabled is false, so there is no change in
behavior, however during suspend, we may have enabled VLANs before, so we
do want to restore that setting.
