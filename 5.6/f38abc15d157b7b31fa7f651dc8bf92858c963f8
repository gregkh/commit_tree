drm/amdkfd: Fix a bug in SDMA RLC queue counting under HWS mode

The sdma_queue_count increment should be done before
execute_queues_cpsch(), which calls pm_calc_rlib_size() where
sdma_queue_count is used to calculate whether over_subscription is
triggered.

With the previous code, when a SDMA queue is created,
compute_queue_count in pm_calc_rlib_size() is one more than the
actual compute queue number, because the queue_count has been
incremented while sdma_queue_count has not. This patch fixes that.
