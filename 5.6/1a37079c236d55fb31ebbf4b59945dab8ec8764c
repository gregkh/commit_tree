selinux: revert "stop passing MAY_NOT_BLOCK to the AVC upon follow_link"

This reverts commit e46e01eebbbc ("selinux: stop passing MAY_NOT_BLOCK
to the AVC upon follow_link"). The correct fix is to instead fall
back to ref-walk if audit is required irrespective of the specific
audit data type.  This is done in the next commit.
