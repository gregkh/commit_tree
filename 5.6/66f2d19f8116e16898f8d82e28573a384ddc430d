ALSA: pcm: Fix memory leak at closing a stream without hw_free

ALSA PCM core recently introduced a new managed PCM buffer allocation
mode that does allocate / free automatically at hw_params and
hw_free.  However, it overlooked the code path directly calling
hw_free PCM ops at releasing the PCM substream, and it may result in a
memory leak as spotted by syzkaller when no buffer preallocation is
used (e.g. vmalloc buffer).

This patch papers over it with a slight refactoring.  The hw_free ops
call and relevant tasks are unified in a new helper function, and call
it from both places.
