net/smc: fix cleanup for linkgroup setup failures

If an SMC connection to a certain peer is setup the first time,
a new linkgroup is created. In case of setup failures, such a
linkgroup is unusable and should disappear. As a first step the
linkgroup is removed from the linkgroup list in smc_lgr_forget().

There are 2 problems:
smc_listen_decline() might be called before linkgroup creation
resulting in a crash due to calling smc_lgr_forget() with
parameter NULL.
If a setup failure occurs after linkgroup creation, the connection
is never unregistered from the linkgroup, preventing linkgroup
freeing.

This patch introduces an enhanced smc_lgr_cleanup_early() function
which
* contains a linkgroup check for early smc_listen_decline()
  invocations
* invokes smc_conn_free() to guarantee unregistering of the
  connection.
* schedules fast linkgroup removal of the unusable linkgroup

And the unused function smcd_conn_free() is removed from smc_core.h.
