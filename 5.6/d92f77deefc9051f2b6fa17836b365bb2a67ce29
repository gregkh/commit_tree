Revert "drm/i915: use a separate context for gpu relocs"

Since commit c45e788d95b4 ("drm/i915/tgl: Suspend pre-parser across GTT
invalidations"), we now disable the advanced preparser on Tigerlake for the
invalidation phase at the start of the batch, we no longer need to emit
the GPU relocations from a second context as they are now flushed inlined.
