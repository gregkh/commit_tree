dt-bindings: display: sunxi: Fix compatible

Commit f5a98bfe7b37 ("dt-bindings: display: Convert Allwinner display
pipeline to schemas") introduced a YAML schema for the Allwinner TCON DT
binding, but the H6 TCON-TV compatible was mistakenly set to fallback on
the A83t's, while the initial documentation and the DT are using R40's.

Fix that.
