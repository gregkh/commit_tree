btrfs: increase the metadata allowance for the free_space_cache

Currently, there is no way for the free space cache to recover from
being serviced by purely bitmaps because the extent threshold is set to
0 in recalculate_thresholds() when we surpass the metadata allowance.

This adds a recovery mechanism by keeping large extents out of the
bitmaps and increases the metadata upper bound to 64KB. The recovery
mechanism bypasses this upper bound, thus making it a soft upper bound.
But, with the bypass being 1MB or greater, it shouldn't add unbounded
overhead.
