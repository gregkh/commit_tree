ALSA: uapi: Fix sparse warning

Fix the following sparse warning generated due to
64-bit compat type having fields defined explicitly
with __s32:
sound/soc/sof/sof-audio.c:46:31: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
sound/soc/sof/sof-audio.c:46:31: expected restricted snd_pcm_state_t [usertype] state
sound/soc/sof/sof-audio.c:46:31: got signed int [usertype] state

Fixes: 80fe7430c708 ("ALSA: add new 32-bit layout for snd_pcm_mmap_status/control")
