drm/gma500: Fixup fbdev stolen size usage evaluation

psbfb_probe performs an evaluation of the required size from the stolen
GTT memory, but gets it wrong in two distinct ways:
- The resulting size must be page-size-aligned;
- The size to allocate is derived from the surface dimensions, not the fb
  dimensions.

When two connectors are connected with different modes, the smallest will
be stored in the fb dimensions, but the size that needs to be allocated must
match the largest (surface) dimensions. This is what is used in the actual
allocation code.

Fix this by correcting the evaluation to conform to the two points above.
It allows correctly switching to 16bpp when one connector is e.g. 1920x1080
and the other is 1024x768.
