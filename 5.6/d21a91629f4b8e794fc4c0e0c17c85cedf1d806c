ACPI: video: Do not export a non working backlight interface on MSI MS-7721 boards

Despite our heuristics to not wrongly export a non working ACPI backlight
interface on desktop machines, we still end up exporting one on desktops
using a motherboard from the MSI MS-7721 series.

I've looked at improving the heuristics, but in this case a quirk seems
to be the only way to solve this.

While at it also add a comment to separate the video_detect_force_none
entries in the video_detect_dmi_table from other type of entries, as we
already do for the other entry types.
