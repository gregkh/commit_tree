powerpc/64s: Reimplement power4_idle code in C

This implements the tricky tracing and soft irq handling bits in C,
leaving the low level bit to asm.

A functional difference is that this redirects the interrupt exit to
a return stub to execute blr, rather than the lr address itself. This
is probably barely measurable on real hardware, but it keeps the link
stack balanced.

Tested with QEMU.
