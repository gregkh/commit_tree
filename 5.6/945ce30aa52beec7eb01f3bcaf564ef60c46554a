staging: wfx: simplify hif_scan() usage

The structures hif_req_start_scan and hif_ssid_def come from hardware
API. It is not intended to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

So, this patch relocate handling of theses structures to hif_scan()
(the low level function). This change also allows to drop struct
wfx_scan_params.
