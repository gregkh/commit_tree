arm64: fpsimd: Make sure SVE setup is complete before SIMD is used

In-kernel users of NEON rely on may_use_simd() to check if the SIMD
can be used. However, we must initialize the SVE before SIMD can
be used. Add a sanity check to make sure that we have completed the
SVE setup before anyone uses the SIMD.
