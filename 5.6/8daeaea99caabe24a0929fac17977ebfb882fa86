clk: meson: meson8b: make the CCF use the glitch-free mali mux

The "mali_0" or "mali_1" clock trees should not be updated while the
clock is running. Enforce this by setting CLK_SET_RATE_GATE on the
"mali_0" and "mali_1" gates. This makes the CCF switch to the "mali_1"
tree when "mali_0" is currently active and vice versa, which is exactly
what the vendor driver does when updating the frequency of the mali
clock.

This fixes a potential hang when changing the GPU frequency at runtime.
