fs_parse: handle optional arguments sanely

Don't bother with "mixed" options that would allow both the
form with and without argument (i.e. both -o foo and -o foo=bar).
Rather than trying to shove both into a single fs_parameter_spec,
allow having with-argument and no-argument specs with the same
name and teach fs_parse to handle that.

There are very few options of that sort, and they are actually
easier to handle that way - callers end up with less postprocessing.
