drm/amdgpu: fix bad DMA from INTERRUPT_CNTL2

The INTERRUPT_CNTL2 register expects a valid DMA address, but is
currently set with a GPU MC address.  This can cause problems on
systems that detect the resulting DMA read from an invalid address
(found on a Power8 guest).

Instead, use the DMA address of the dummy page because it will always
be safe.
