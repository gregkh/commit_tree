objtool: Silence build output

The sync-check.sh script prints out the path due to a "cd -" at the end
of the script, even on silent builds. This isn't even needed, since the
script is executed in our build instead of sourced (so it won't change
the working directory of the surrounding build anyway).

Just remove the cd to make the build silent.
