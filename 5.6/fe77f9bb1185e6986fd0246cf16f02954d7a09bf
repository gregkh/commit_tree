Input: axp20x-pek - respect userspace wakeup configuration

Unlike most other power button drivers, this driver unconditionally
enables its wakeup IRQ. It should be using device_may_wakeup() to
respect the userspace configuration of wakeup sources.

Because the AXP20x MFD device uses regmap-irq, the AXP20x PEK IRQs are
nested off of regmap-irq's threaded interrupt handler. The device core
ignores such interrupts, so to actually disable wakeup, we must
explicitly disable all non-wakeup interrupts during suspend.
