bpf, uapi: Remove text about bpf_redirect_map() giving higher performance

The performance of bpf_redirect() is now roughly the same as that of
bpf_redirect_map(). However, David Ahern pointed out that the header file
has not been updated to reflect this, and still says that a significant
performance increase is possible when using bpf_redirect_map(). Remove this
text from the bpf_redirect_map() description, and reword the description in
bpf_redirect() slightly. Also fix the 'Return' section of the
bpf_redirect_map() documentation.
