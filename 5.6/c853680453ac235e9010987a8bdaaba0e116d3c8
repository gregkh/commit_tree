ovl: fix lockdep warning for async write

Lockdep reports "WARNING: lock held when returning to user space!" due to
async write holding freeze lock over the write.  Apparently aio.c already
deals with this by lying to lockdep about the state of the lock.

Do the same here.  No need to check for S_IFREG() here since these file ops
are regular-only.
