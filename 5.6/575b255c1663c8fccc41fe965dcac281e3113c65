KVM: x86: allow compiling as non-module with W=1

Compile error with CONFIG_KVM_INTEL=y and W=1:

  CC      arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.o
arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:68:32: error: 'vmx_cpu_id' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-const-variable=]
   68 | static const struct x86_cpu_id vmx_cpu_id[] = {
      |                                ^~~~~~~~~~
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

When building with =y, the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro doesn't generate a
reference to the structure (or any code at all).  This makes W=1 compiles
unhappy.

Wrap both in a #ifdef to avoid the issue.
