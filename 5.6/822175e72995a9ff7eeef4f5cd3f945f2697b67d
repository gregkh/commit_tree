rcu: Fix harmless omission of "CONFIG_" from #if condition

The C preprocessor macros SRCU and TINY_RCU should instead be CONFIG_SRCU
and CONFIG_TINY_RCU, respectively in the #f in kernel/rcu/rcu.h. But
there is no harm when "TINY_RCU" is wrongly used, which are always
non-defined, which makes "!defined(TINY_RCU)" always true, which means
the code block is always included, and the included code block doesn't
cause any compilation error so far in CONFIG_TINY_RCU builds.  It is
also the reason this change should not be taken in -stable.

This commit adds the needed "CONFIG_" prefix to both macros.

Not for -stable.
