staging: wfx: simplify hif_set_mac_addr_condition()

The structure hif_mib_mac_addr_data_frame_condition come from hardware
API. It is not intended to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

In add, current code for hif_set_mac_addr_condition() is too dumb. It
should pack data with hardware representation instead of leaving all
work to the caller.
