mac80211: drop data frames without key on encrypted links

If we know that we have an encrypted link (based on having had
a key configured for TX in the past) then drop all data frames
in the key selection handler if there's no key anymore.

This fixes an issue with mac80211 internal TXQs - there we can
buffer frames for an encrypted link, but then if the key is no
longer there when they're dequeued, the frames are sent without
encryption. This happens if a station is disconnected while the
frames are still on the TXQ.

Detecting that a link should be encrypted based on a first key
having been configured for TX is fine as there are no use cases
for a connection going from with encryption to no encryption.
With extended key IDs, however, there is a case of having a key
configured for only decryption, so we can't just trigger this
behaviour on a key being configured.
