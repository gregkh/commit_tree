ALSA: sh: Fix compile warning wrt const

A long-standing compile warning was seen during build test:
  sound/sh/aica.c: In function 'load_aica_firmware':
  sound/sh/aica.c:521:25: warning: passing argument 2 of 'spu_memload' discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-qualifiers]

Fixes: 198de43d758c ("[ALSA] Add ALSA support for the SEGA Dreamcast PCM device")
