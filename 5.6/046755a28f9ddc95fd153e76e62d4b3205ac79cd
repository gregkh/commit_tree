drivers/block/null_blk_main.c: fix uninitialized var warnings

With gcc-7.2, many instances of

drivers/block/null_blk_main.c: In function ‘nullb_device_zone_nr_conv_store’:
drivers/block/null_blk_main.c:291:12: warning: ‘new_value’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  dev->NAME = new_value;      \
            ^
drivers/block/null_blk_main.c:279:7: note: ‘new_value’ was declared here
  TYPE new_value;       \
       ^

Presumably notabug, so use uninitialized_var() to suppress them.
