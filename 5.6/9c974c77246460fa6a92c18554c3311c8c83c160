cgroup: Iterate tasks that did not finish do_exit()

PF_EXITING is set earlier than actual removal from css_set when a task
is exitting. This can confuse cgroup.procs readers who see no PF_EXITING
tasks, however, rmdir is checking against css_set membership so it can
transitionally fail with EBUSY.

Fix this by listing tasks that weren't unlinked from css_set active
lists.
It may happen that other users of the task iterator (without
CSS_TASK_ITER_PROCS) spot a PF_EXITING task before cgroup_exit(). This
is equal to the state before commit c03cd7738a83 ("cgroup: Include dying
leaders with live threads in PROCS iterations") but it may be reviewed
later.
