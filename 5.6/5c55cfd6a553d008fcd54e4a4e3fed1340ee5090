RDMA/core: Use READ_ONCE for ib_ufile.async_file

The writer for async_file holds the ucontext_lock, while the readers are
left unlocked. Most readers rely on an implicit locking, either by having
a uobject (which cannot be created before a context) or by holding the
ib_ufile kref.

However ib_uverbs_free_hw_resources() has no implicit lock and has a
possible race. Make this all clear and sane by using READ_ONCE
consistently.
