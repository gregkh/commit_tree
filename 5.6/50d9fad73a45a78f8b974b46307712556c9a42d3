ubifs: use IS_ENCRYPTED() instead of ubifs_crypt_is_encrypted()

There's no need for the ubifs_crypt_is_encrypted() function anymore.
Just use IS_ENCRYPTED() instead, like ext4 and f2fs do.  IS_ENCRYPTED()
checks the VFS-level flag instead of the UBIFS-specific flag, but it
shouldn't change any behavior since the flags are kept in sync.
