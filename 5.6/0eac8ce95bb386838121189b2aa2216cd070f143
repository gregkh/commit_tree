ptr_ring: add include of linux/mm.h

Commit 0bf7800f1799 ("ptr_ring: try vmalloc() when kmalloc() fails")
started to use kvmalloc_array and kvfree, which are defined in mm.h,
the previous functions kcalloc and kfree, which are defined in slab.h.

Add the missing include of linux/mm.h.  This went unnoticed as other
include files happened to include mm.h.
