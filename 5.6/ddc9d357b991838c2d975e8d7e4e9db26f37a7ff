Drivers: hv: vmbus: Ignore CHANNELMSG_TL_CONNECT_RESULT(23)

When a Linux hv_sock app tries to connect to a Service GUID on which no
host app is listening, a recent host (RS3+) sends a
CHANNELMSG_TL_CONNECT_RESULT (23) message to Linux and this triggers such
a warning:

unknown msgtype=23
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at drivers/hv/vmbus_drv.c:1031 vmbus_on_msg_dpc

Actually Linux can safely ignore the message because the Linux app's
connect() will time out in 2 seconds: see VSOCK_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
and vsock_stream_connect(). We don't bother to make use of the message
because: 1) it's only supported on recent hosts; 2) a non-trivial effort
is required to use the message in Linux, but the benefit is small.

So, let's not see the warning by silently ignoring the message.
