x86/cpu: Clear VMX feature flag if VMX is not fully enabled

Now that IA32_FEAT_CTL is always configured and locked for CPUs that are
known to support VMX[*], clear the VMX capability flag if the MSR is
unsupported or BIOS disabled VMX, i.e. locked IA32_FEAT_CTL and didn't
set the appropriate VMX enable bit.

[*] Because init_ia32_feat_ctl() is called from vendors ->c_init(), it's
    still possible for IA32_FEAT_CTL to be left unlocked when VMX is
    supported by the CPU.  This is not fatal, and will be addressed in a
    future patch.
