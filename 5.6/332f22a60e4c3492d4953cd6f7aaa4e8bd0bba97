xdp: Remove map_to_flush and map swap detection

Now that all XDP maps that can be used with bpf_redirect_map() tracks
entries to be flushed in a global fashion, there is not need to track
that the map has changed and flush from xdp_do_generic_map()
anymore. All entries will be flushed in xdp_do_flush_map().

This means that the map_to_flush can be removed, and the corresponding
checks. Moving the flush logic to one place, xdp_do_flush_map(), give
a bulking behavior and performance boost.
