soundwire: cadence_master: remove config update for interrupt setting

Config only needs to be updated when setting MCP_Config, MCP_Control
and MCP_CmdCtrl to make these register setting effective. When updating
config in master, master will communicate with slave to update status.
Communication will be failed when masters and slaves are in clock stop
state, and this unnecessary config update makes interrupt setting failed.

Tested on Comet Lake with soundwire enabled
