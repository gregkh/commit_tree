bpftool, selftests/bpf: Embed object file inside skeleton

Embed contents of BPF object file used for BPF skeleton generation inside
skeleton itself. This allows to keep BPF object file and its skeleton in sync
at all times, and simpifies skeleton instantiation.

Also switch existing selftests to not require BPF_EMBED_OBJ anymore.
