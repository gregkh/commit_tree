xprtrdma: Fix DMA scatter-gather list mapping imbalance

The @nents value that was passed to ib_dma_map_sg() has to be passed
to the matching ib_dma_unmap_sg() call. If ib_dma_map_sg() choses to
concatenate sg entries, it will return a different nents value than
it was passed.

The bug was exposed by recent changes to the AMD IOMMU driver, which
enabled sg entry concatenation.

Looking all the way back to commit 4143f34e01e9 ("xprtrdma: Port to
new memory registration API") and reviewing other kernel ULPs, it's
not clear that the frwr_map() logic was ever correct for this case.
