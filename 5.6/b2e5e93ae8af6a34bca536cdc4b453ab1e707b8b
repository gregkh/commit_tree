samples/bpf: Don't try to remove user's homedir on clean

The 'clean' rule in the samples/bpf Makefile tries to remove backup
files (ending in ~). However, if no such files exist, it will instead try
to remove the user's home directory. While the attempt is mostly harmless,
it does lead to a somewhat scary warning like this:

rm: cannot remove '~': Is a directory

Fix this by using find instead of shell expansion to locate any actual
backup files that need to be removed.
