IB/mlx5: Return failure when rts2rts_qp_counters_set_id is not supported

When binding a QP with a counter and the QP state is not RESET, return
failure if the rts2rts_qp_counters_set_id is not supported by the
device.

This is to prevent cases like manual bind for Connect-IB devices from
returning success when the feature is not supported.
