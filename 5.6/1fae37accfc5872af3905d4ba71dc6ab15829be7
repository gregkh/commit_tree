nvme/pci: Add sleep quirk for Samsung and Toshiba drives

The Samsung SSD SM981/PM981 and Toshiba SSD KBG40ZNT256G on the Lenovo
C640 platform experience runtime resume issues when the SSDs are kept in
sleep/suspend mode for long time.

This patch applies the 'Simple Suspend' quirk to these configurations.
With this patch, the issue had not been observed in a 1+ day test.
