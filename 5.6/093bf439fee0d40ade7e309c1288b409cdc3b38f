irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix get_vlpi_map() breakage with doorbells

When updating an LPI configuration, get_vlpi_map() may be passed a
irq_data structure relative to an ITS domain (the normal case) or one
that is relative to the core GICv3 domain in the case of a GICv4
doorbell.

In the latter case, special care must be take not to dereference
the irq_chip data as an its_dev structure, as that isn't what is
stored there. Instead, check *first* whether the IRQ is forwarded
to a vcpu, and only then try to obtain the vlpi mapping.
