iio: magnetometer: ak8974: Fix negative raw values in sysfs

At the moment, reading from in_magn_*_raw in sysfs tends to return
large values around 65000, even though the output of ak8974 is actually
limited to Â±32768. This happens because the value is never converted
to the signed 16-bit integer variant.

Add an explicit cast to s16 to fix this.
