media: MAINTAINERS: Orphan img-ir driver

I haven't been active for 18 months, and don't have the hardware set up
to test the img-ir driver, so mark it as orphaned and remove myself as
maintainer.

I used to test this driver using a Minimorph board with Meta based
TZ1090 SoC, but the Meta arch port is long gone from the kernel. The
only remaining platform in-tree using this driver is the Imagination
Pistachio SoC, and the only Pistachio based board with DTS in-tree (MIPS
Creator Ci40) doesn't bring the IR out.

However I presume the IP persists under the guardianship of Sondrel, and
its possible current & future SoCs/boards may continue to use this IP.
