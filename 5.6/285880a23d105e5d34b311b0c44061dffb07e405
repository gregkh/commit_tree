ASoC: SOF: Make creation of machine device from SOF core optional

Currently, SOF probes machine drivers by creating a platform device
and passing the machine description as private data.

This is driven by the ACPI restrictions. Ideally, ACPI tables
should contain the description for the machine driver. This is
not possible because ACPI tables are frozen and used on multiple
OS-es (e.g Windows).

In the case of Device Tree we don't have this restriction, so we
choose to probe the machine drivers by creating a DT node as is
the standard ALSA way.

This patch makes the probing of machine drivers from SOF
core optional allowing for Device Tree platforms to decouple
the SOF core from machine driver probing.

Along with this, it also consolidates the machine driver selection
for Intel platforms by defining optional ops for selecting the machine
driver based on the ACPI match for HDA and non-HDA platforms and
setting the mach params.
