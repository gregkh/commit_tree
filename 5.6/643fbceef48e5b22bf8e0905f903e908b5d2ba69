smb3: fix default permissions on new files when mounting with modefromsid

When mounting with "modefromsid" mount parm most servers will require
that some default permissions are given to users in the ACL on newly
created files, files created with the new 'sd context' - when passing in
an sd context on create, permissions are not inherited from the parent
directory, so in addition to the ACE with the special SID which contains
the mode, we also must pass in an ACE allowing users to access the file
(GENERIC_ALL for authenticated users seemed like a reasonable default,
although later we could allow a mount option or config switch to make
it GENERIC_ALL for EVERYONE special sid).
