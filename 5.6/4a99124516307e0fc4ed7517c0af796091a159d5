ath10k: change bundle count for max rx bundle for sdio

For max bundle size 32, the bundle mask is not same with 8/16.
Change it to match the max bundle size of htc. Otherwise it
will not match with firmware, for example, when bundle count
is 17, then flags of ath10k_htc_hdr is 0x4, if without this
patch, it will be considered as non-bundled packet because it
does not have mask 0xF0, then trigger error message later:
payload length 56747 exceeds max htc length: 4088.

htc->max_msgs_per_htc_bundle is the min value of
HTC_HOST_MAX_MSG_PER_RX_BUNDLE and
msg->ready_ext.max_msgs_per_htc_bundle of ath10k_htc_wait_target,
it will be sent to firmware later in ath10k_htc_start, then
firmware will use it as the final max rx bundle count, in
WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00029, msg->ready_ext.max_msgs_per_htc_bundle
is 32, it is same with HTC_HOST_MAX_MSG_PER_RX_BUNDLE, so the
final max rx bundle count will be set to 32 in firmware.

This patch only effect sdio chips.

Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00029.
