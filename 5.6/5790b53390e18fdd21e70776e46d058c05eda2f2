virtio-balloon: initialize all vq callbacks

Ensure that elements of the callbacks array that correspond to
unavailable features are set to NULL; previously, they would be left
uninitialized.

Since the corresponding names array elements were explicitly set to
NULL, the uninitialized callback pointers would not actually be
dereferenced; however, the uninitialized callbacks elements would still
be read in vp_find_vqs_msix() and used to calculate the number of MSI-X
vectors required.
