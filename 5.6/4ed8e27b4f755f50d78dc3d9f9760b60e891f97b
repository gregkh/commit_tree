xfs: make xfs_buf_read_map return an error code

Convert xfs_buf_read_map() to return numeric error codes like most
everywhere else in xfs.  This involves moving the open-coded logic that
reports metadata IO read / corruption errors and stales the buffer into
xfs_buf_read_map so that the logic is all in one place.
