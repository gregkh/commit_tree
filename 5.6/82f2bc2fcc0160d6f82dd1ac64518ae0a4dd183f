kbuild: Disable -Wpointer-to-enum-cast

Clang's -Wpointer-to-int-cast deviates from GCC in that it warns when
casting to enums. The kernel does this in certain places, such as device
tree matches to set the version of the device being used, which allows
the kernel to avoid using a gigantic union.

To avoid a ton of false positive warnings, disable this particular part
of the warning, which has been split off into a separate diagnostic so
that the entire warning does not need to be turned off for clang. It
will be visible under W=1 in case people want to go about fixing these
easily and enabling the warning treewide.
