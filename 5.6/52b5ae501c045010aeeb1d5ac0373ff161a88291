net_sched: fix a resource leak in tcindex_set_parms()

Jakub noticed there is a potential resource leak in
tcindex_set_parms(): when tcindex_filter_result_init() fails
and it jumps to 'errout1' which doesn't release the memory
and resources allocated by tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().

We should just jump to 'errout_alloc' which calls
tcindex_free_perfect_hash().

Fixes: b9a24bb76bf6 ("net_sched: properly handle failure case of tcf_exts_init()")
