KVM: x86/mmu: Rely on host page tables to find HugeTLB mappings

Remove KVM's HugeTLB specific logic and instead rely on walking the host
page tables (already done for THP) to identify HugeTLB mappings.
Eliminating the HugeTLB-only logic avoids taking mmap_sem and calling
find_vma() for all hugepage compatible page faults, and simplifies KVM's
page fault code by consolidating all hugepage adjustments into a common
helper.
