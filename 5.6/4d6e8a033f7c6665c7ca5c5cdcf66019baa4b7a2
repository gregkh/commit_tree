RDMA/cm: Use RCU synchronization mechanism to protect cm_id_private xa_load()

The RCU mechanism is optimized for read-mostly scenarios and therefore
more suitable to protect the cm_id_private to decrease "cm.lock"
congestion.

This patch replaces the existing spinlock locking mechanism and kfree with
RCU mechanism in places where spinlock(cm.lock) protected xa_load
returning the cm_id_priv

In addition, delete the cm_get_id() function as there is no longer a
distinction if the caller already holds the cm_lock.

Remove an open coded version of cm_get_id().
