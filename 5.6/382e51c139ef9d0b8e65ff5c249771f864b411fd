ath10k: set WMI_PEER_AUTHORIZE after a firmware crash

After the firmware crashes ath10k recovers via ieee80211_reconfig(),
which eventually leads to firmware configuration and including the
encryption keys. However, because there is no new auth/assoc and
4-way-handshake, and firmware set the authorize flag after
4-way-handshake, so the authorize flag in firmware is not set in
firmware without 4-way-handshake. This will lead to a failure of data
transmission after recovery done when using encrypted connections like
WPA-PSK. Set authorize flag after installing keys to firmware will fix
the issue.

This was noticed by testing firmware crashing using simulate_fw_crash
debugfs file.

Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00007-QCARMSWP-1.
