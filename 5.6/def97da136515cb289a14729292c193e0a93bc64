printk: fix exclusive_console replaying

Commit f92b070f2dc8 ("printk: Do not miss new messages when replaying
the log") introduced a new variable @exclusive_console_stop_seq to
store when an exclusive console should stop printing. It should be
set to the @console_seq value at registration. However, @console_seq
is previously set to @syslog_seq so that the exclusive console knows
where to begin. This results in the exclusive console immediately
reactivating all the other consoles and thus repeating the messages
for those consoles.

Set @console_seq after @exclusive_console_stop_seq has stored the
current @console_seq value.
