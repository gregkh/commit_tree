scripts/get_maintainer.pl: deprioritize old Fixes: addresses

Recently, I found that get_maintainer was causing me to send emails to
the old addresses for maintainers.  Since I usually just trust the
output of get_maintainer to know the right email address, I didn't even
look carefully and fired off two patch series that went to the wrong
place.  Oops.

The problem was introduced recently when trying to add signatures from
Fixes.  The problem was that these email addresses were added too early
in the process of compiling our list of places to send.  Things added to
the list earlier are considered more canonical and when we later added
maintainer entries we ended up deduplicating to the old address.

Here are two examples using mainline commits (to make it easier to
replicate) for the two maintainers that I messed up recently:

  $ git format-patch d8549bcd0529~..d8549bcd0529
  $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-clk-Add-clk_hw*.patch | grep Boyd
  Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>...

  $ git format-patch 6d1238aa3395~..6d1238aa3395
  $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-arm64-dts-qcom-qcs404*.patch | grep Andy
  Andy Gross <andy.gross@linaro.org>

Let's move the adding of addresses from Fixes: to the end since the
email addresses from these are much more likely to be older.

After this patch the above examples get the right addresses for the two
examples.
