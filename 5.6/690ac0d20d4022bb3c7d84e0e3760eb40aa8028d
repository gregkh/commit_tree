thunderbolt: Update Kconfig entries to USB4

Since the driver now supports USB4 which is the standard going forward,
update the Kconfig entry to mention this and rename the entry from
CONFIG_THUNDERBOLT to CONFIG_USB4 instead to help people to find the
correct option if they want to enable USB4.

Also do the same for Thunderbolt network driver.
