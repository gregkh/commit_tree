serial: 8250: Support disabling mdelay-filled probes of 16550A variants

The 8250 driver can probe for many variants of the venerable 16550A
serial port. Some of those probes involve long (20ms) mdelay calls,
which delay system boot. Modern systems and virtual machines don't have
those variants.

Provide a Kconfig option to disable probes for 16550A variants.
Disabling this speeds up the boot of a virtual machine with a serial
console by more than 20ms (a substantial fraction of the ~100ms needed
to boot a carefully configured VM).

Before:
[  +0.021919] 00:04: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
After:
[  +0.000097] 00:04: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
