sctp: move the format error check out of __sctp_sf_do_9_1_abort

When T2 timer is to be stopped, the asoc should also be deleted,
otherwise, there will be no chance to call sctp_association_free
and the asoc could last in memory forever.

However, in sctp_sf_shutdown_sent_abort(), after adding the cmd
SCTP_CMD_TIMER_STOP for T2 timer, it may return error due to the
format error from __sctp_sf_do_9_1_abort() and miss adding
SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_FAILED where the asoc will be deleted.

This patch is to fix it by moving the format error check out of
__sctp_sf_do_9_1_abort(), and do it before adding the cmd
SCTP_CMD_TIMER_STOP for T2 timer.

Thanks Hangbin for reporting this issue by the fuzz testing.

v1->v2:
  - improve the comment in the code as Marcelo's suggestion.
