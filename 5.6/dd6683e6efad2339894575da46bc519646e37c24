ext4: remove ext4_{ind,ext}_calc_metadata_amount()

Remove the ext4_ind_calc_metadata_amount() and
ext4_ext_calc_metadata_amount() functions, which have been unused since
commit 71d4f7d03214 ("ext4: remove metadata reservation checks").

Also remove the i_da_metadata_calc_last_lblock and
i_da_metadata_calc_len fields from struct ext4_inode_info, as these were
only used by these removed functions.
