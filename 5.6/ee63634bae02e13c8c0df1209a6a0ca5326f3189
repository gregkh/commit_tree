dm zoned: Fix reference counter initial value of chunk works

Dm-zoned initializes reference counters of new chunk works with zero
value and refcount_inc() is called to increment the counter. However, the
refcount_inc() function handles the addition to zero value as an error
and triggers the warning as follows:

refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

After this warning, following refcount API calls for the counter all fail
to change the counter value.

Fix this by setting the initial reference counter value not zero but one
for the new chunk works. Instead, do not call refcount_inc() via
dmz_get_chunk_work() for the new chunks works.

The failure was observed with linux version 5.4 with CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL
enabled. Refcount rework was merged to linux version 5.5 by the
commit 168829ad09ca ("Merge branch 'locking-core-for-linus' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip"). After this
commit, CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL was removed and the failure was observed
regardless of kernel configuration.

Linux version 4.20 merged the commit 092b5648760a ("dm zoned: target: use
refcount_t for dm zoned reference counters"). Before this commit, dm
zoned used atomic_t APIs which does not check addition to zero, then this
fix is not necessary.
