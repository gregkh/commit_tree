kvm: x86: hyperv: Use APICv update request interface

Since disabling APICv has to be done for all vcpus on AMD-based
system, adopt the newly introduced kvm_request_apicv_update()
interface, and introduce a new APICV_INHIBIT_REASON_HYPERV.

Also, remove the kvm_vcpu_deactivate_apicv() since no longer used.
