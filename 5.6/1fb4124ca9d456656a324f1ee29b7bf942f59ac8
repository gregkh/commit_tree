powerpc/sriov: Remove VF eeh_dev state when disabling SR-IOV

When disabling virtual functions on an SR-IOV adapter we currently do not
correctly remove the EEH state for the now-dead virtual functions. When
removing the pci_dn that was created for the VF when SR-IOV was enabled
we free the corresponding eeh_dev without removing it from the child device
list of the eeh_pe that contained it. This can result in crashes due to the
use-after-free.
