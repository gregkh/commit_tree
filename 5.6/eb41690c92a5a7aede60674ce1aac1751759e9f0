ARM: dts: at91: sama5d27_som1_ek: add the microchip,sdcal-inverted on sdmmc0

Specify the SoC SDCAL pin connection that is used in the
sama5d27c 128MiB SiP on the SAMA5D27 SOM1.
This will put in place a software workaround that would reduce power
consumption on all boards using this SoM, including the SAMA5D27 SOM1 EK.

Uses property introduced in 5cd41fe89704 ("dt-bindings: sdhci-of-at91:
add the microchip,sdcal-inverted property")
