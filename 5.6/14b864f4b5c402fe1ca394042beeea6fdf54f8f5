efi/x86: Check number of arguments to variadic functions

On x86 we need to thunk through assembler stubs to call the EFI services
for mixed mode, and for runtime services in 64-bit mode. The assembler
stubs have limits on how many arguments it handles. Introduce a few
macros to check that we do not try to pass too many arguments to the
stubs.
