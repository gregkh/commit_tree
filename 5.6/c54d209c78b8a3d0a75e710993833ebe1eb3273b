ice: Wait for VF to be reset/ready before configuration

The configuration/command below is failing when the VF in the xml
file is already bound to the host iavf driver.

pci_0000_af_0_0.xml:

<interface type='hostdev' managed='yes'>
<source>
<address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0xaf' slot='0x0' function='0x0'/>
</source>
<mac address='00:de:ad:00:11:01'/>
</interface>

> virsh attach-device domain_name pci_0000_af_0_0.xml
error: Failed to attach device from pci_0000_af_0_0.xml
error: Cannot set interface MAC/vlanid to 00:de:ad:00:11:01/0 for
	ifname ens1f1 vf 0: Device or resource busy

This is failing because the VF has not been completely removed/reset
after being unbound (via the virsh command above) from the host iavf
driver and ice_set_vf_mac() checks if the VF is disabled before waiting
for the reset to finish.

Fix this by waiting for the VF remove/reset process to happen before
checking if the VF is disabled. Also, since many functions for VF
administration on the PF were more or less calling the same 3 functions
(ice_wait_on_vf_reset(), ice_is_vf_disabled(), and ice_check_vf_init())
move these into the helper function ice_check_vf_ready_for_cfg(). Then
call this function in any flow that attempts to configure/query a VF
from the PF.

Lastly, increase the maximum wait time in ice_wait_on_vf_reset() to
800ms, and modify/add the #define(s) that determine the wait time.
This was done for robustness because in rare/stress cases VF removal can
take a max of ~800ms and previously the wait was a max of ~300ms.
