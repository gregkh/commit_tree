dma-direct: improve swiotlb error reporting

Untangle the way how dma_direct_map_page calls into swiotlb to be able
to properly report errors where the swiotlb DMA address overflows the
mask separately from overflows in the !swiotlb case.  This means that
siotlb_map now has to do a little more work that duplicates
dma_direct_map_page, but doing so greatly simplifies the calling
convention.
