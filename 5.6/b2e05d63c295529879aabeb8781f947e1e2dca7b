pinctrl: lynxpoint: Use raw_spinlock for locking

The Intel Lynxpoint pinctrl driver implements irqchip callbacks which are
called with desc->lock raw_spinlock held. In mainline this is fine because
spinlock resolves to raw_spinlock. However, running the same code in -rt
we will get a BUG() asserted.

This is because in -rt spinlocks are preemptible so taking the driver
private spinlock in irqchip callbacks causes might_sleep() to trigger.

In order to keep -rt happy but at the same time make sure that register
accesses get serialized, convert the driver to use raw_spinlock instead.
