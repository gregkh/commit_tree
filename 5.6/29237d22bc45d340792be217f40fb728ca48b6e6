net/smc: allow unprivileged users to read pnet table

The current flags of the SMC_PNET_GET command only allow privileged
users to retrieve entries from the pnet table via netlink. The content
of the pnet table may be useful for all users though, e.g., for
debugging smc connection problems.

This patch removes the GENL_ADMIN_PERM flag so that unprivileged users
can read the pnet table.
