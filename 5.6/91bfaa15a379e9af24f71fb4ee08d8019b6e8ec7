netfilter: flowtable: Fix hardware flush order on nf_flow_table_cleanup

On netdev down event, nf_flow_table_cleanup() is called for the relevant
device and it cleans all the tables that are on that device.
If one of those tables has hardware offload flag,
nf_flow_table_iterate_cleanup flushes hardware and then runs the gc.
But the gc can queue more hardware work, which will take time to execute.

Instead first add the work, then flush it, to execute it now.
