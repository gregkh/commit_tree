ARM: defconfig: gemini: Update defconfig

This updates the gemini defconfig with Kconfig shuffling and
some of the features activated in new upstream drivers and newly
supported devices:

- Move some symbols around due to Kconfig alterations,
  this affects CONFIG_PREEMPT, CONFIG_PCI, CONFIG_CMA,
  CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC, CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED.
- Add RedBoot partition parsing, as all the Gemini
  devices use some RedBoot derivative and store their
  flash partition tables in this format.
- Enable bridge and VLAN filtering: a majority of the
  Gemini devices have some kind of DSA chip for ethernet
  bridging/routing.
- Enable CONFIG_NET_DSA_REALTEK_SMI as this DSA router
  chip is found in the Gemini-based products. This makes
  explicit selection of CONFIG_REALTEK_PHY unnecessary
  so that goes away.
- Enable CONFIG_TUN since Gemini userspace often make
  use of the TUN interface for network services.
- Enable MARVELL_PHY as Marvell PHY connectors are often
  found in Gemini systems.
- Enable basic 802.11 libraries as many Gemini systems
  have wireless PCI cards.
