MAINTAINERS: remove unnecessary ':' characters

Commit e567cb3fef30 ("MAINTAINERS: add an entry for kfifo") added a new
entry to MAINTAINERS. Following the example of the previous entry on the
list I added a trailing ':' character at the end of the title line.

This however results in rather strange looking output from
scripts/get_maintainer.pl:

$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl ./0001-kfifo.patch
Stefani Seibold <stefani@seibold.net> (maintainer:KFIFO:)
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)

It turns out there are more entries like this. Fix the entire file by
removing all trailing colons.
