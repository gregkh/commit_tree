bpf: Initialize storage pointers to NULL to prevent freeing garbage pointer

Local storage array isn't initialized, so if cgroup storage allocation fails
for BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED, error handling code will attempt to free
uninitialized pointer for BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_PERCPU storage type. Avoid this
by always initializing storage pointers to NULLs.
