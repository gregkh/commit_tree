usb: host: ehci-tegra: Correct teardown order of driver's removal

I found that PHY's enable refcounting was broken and after fixing it
I also found that machine started to hang after EHCI driver module
removal. Turned out that the teardown order is incorrect because HCD must
be unregistered *before* PHY's disabling. Note that it is also not correct
to assert the shared reset during of driver's removal because PHY takes
care of resetting shared pads and thus it's better to remove that part
from the EHCI driver.
