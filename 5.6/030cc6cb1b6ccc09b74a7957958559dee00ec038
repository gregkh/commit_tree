ARM: dts: NSP: Use hardware I2C for BCM958625HR

Now that the i2c-bcm-iproc driver has been fixed to permit reading more
than 63 bytes in a single transaction with commit fd01eecdf959 ("i2c:
iproc: Fix i2c master read more than 63 bytes") we no longer need to
bitbang i2c over GPIOs which was necessary before to allow the
PHYLINK/SFP subsystems to read SFP modules.
