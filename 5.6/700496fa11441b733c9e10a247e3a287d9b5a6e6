drm/todo: Add entry to remove load/unload hooks

They're midlayer, broken, and because of the old gunk, we can't fix
them. For examples see the various checks in drm_mode_object.c against
dev->registered, which cannot be enforced if the driver still uses the
load hook.

Unfortunately our biggest driver still uses load/unload, so this would
be really great to get fixed.
