tools/bootconfig: Show the number of bootconfig nodes

Show the number of bootconfig nodes when applying new bootconfig to
initrd.

Since there are limitations of bootconfig not only in its filesize,
but also the number of nodes, the number should be shown when applying
so that user can get the feeling of scale of current bootconfig.
