KVM: arm/arm64: Cleanup MMIO handling

Our MMIO handling is a bit odd, in the sense that it uses an
intermediate per-vcpu structure to store the various decoded
information that describe the access.

But the same information is readily available in the HSR/ESR_EL2
field, and we actually use this field to populate the structure.

Let's simplify the whole thing by getting rid of the superfluous
structure and save a (tiny) bit of space in the vcpu structure.
