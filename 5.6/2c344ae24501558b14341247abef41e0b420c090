igc: Add support for TX timestamping

This adds support for timestamping packets being transmitted.

Based on the code from i210. The basic differences is that i225 has 4
registers to store the transmit timestamps (i210 has one). Right now,
we only support retrieving from one register, support for using the
other registers will be added later.
