drbd: fifo_alloc() should use struct_size

Switching to struct_size for the allocation in fifo_alloc avoids
hard-coding the type of fifo_buffer.values in fifo_alloc. It also
provides overflow protection; to avoid pessimistic code being
generated by the compiler as a result, this patch also switches
fifo_size to unsigned, propagating the change as appropriate.
