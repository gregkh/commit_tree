selftests/ftrace: fix glob selftest

test.d/ftrace/func-filter-glob.tc is failing on s390 because it has
ARCH_INLINE_SPIN_LOCK and friends set to 'y'. So the usual
__raw_spin_lock symbol isn't in the ftrace function list. Change
'*aw*lock' to '*spin*lock' which would hopefully match some of the
locking functions on all platforms.
