ALSA: usb-audio: Annotate endianess in Scarlett gen2 quirk

The Scarlett gen2 mixer quirk code defines a few record types to
communicate via USB hub, and those must be all little-endian.
This patch changes the field types to LE to annotate endianess
properly.  It also fixes the incorrect usage of leXX_to_cpu() in a
couple of places, which was caught by sparse after this change.
