virt: vbox: Explicitly include linux/io.h to pick up various defs

Through a labyrinthian sequence of includes, usage of page_to_phys(),
virt_to_phys() and out*() is dependent on the include of asm/io.h in
x86's asm/realmode.h, which is included in x86's asm/acpi.h and thus by
linux/acpi.h.  Explicitly include linux/io.h to break the dependency on
realmode.h so that a future patch can remove the realmode.h include from
acpi.h without breaking the build.
