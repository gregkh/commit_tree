crypto: ccp - create a generic psp-dev file

The PSP (Platform Security Processor) provides support for key management
commands in Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) mode, along with
software-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to enable third-party
Trusted Applications.

Therefore, introduce psp-dev.c and psp-dev.h files, which can invoke
SEV (or TEE) initialization based on platform feature support.

TEE interface support will be introduced in a later patch.
