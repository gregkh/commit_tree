x86/mce/amd: Publish the bank pointer only after setup has succeeded

threshold_create_bank() creates a bank descriptor per MCA error
thresholding counter which can be controlled over sysfs. It publishes
the pointer to that bank in a per-CPU variable and then goes on to
create additional thresholding blocks if the bank has such.

However, that creation of additional blocks in
allocate_threshold_blocks() can fail, leading to a use-after-free
through the per-CPU pointer.

Therefore, publish that pointer only after all blocks have been setup
successfully.
