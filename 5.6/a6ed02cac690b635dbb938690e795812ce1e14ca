libbpf: Load btf_vmlinux only once per object.

As more programs (TRACING, STRUCT_OPS, and upcoming LSM) use vmlinux
BTF information, loading the BTF vmlinux information for every program
in an object is sub-optimal. The fix was originally proposed in:

   https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/CAEf4BzZodr3LKJuM7QwD38BiEH02Cc1UbtnGpVkCJ00Mf+V_Qg@mail.gmail.com/

The btf_vmlinux is populated in the object if any of the programs in
the object requires it just before the programs are loaded and freed
after the programs finish loading.
