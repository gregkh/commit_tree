media: Revert "media: staging/intel-ipu3: make imgu use fixed running mode"

This reverts commit e878742c83ec26ef256ebb6b36a4d44644548f25.

Imgu should still keep the capability and flexibility to allow user to
run 2 video pipes, as the user may use the video pipe to capture still
frames with less system load and power than still pipe.
