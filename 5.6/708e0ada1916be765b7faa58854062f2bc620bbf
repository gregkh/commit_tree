module: avoid setting info->name early in case we can fall back to info->mod->name

In setup_load_info(), info->name (which contains the name of the module,
mostly used for early logging purposes before the module gets set up)
gets unconditionally assigned if .modinfo is missing despite the fact
that there is an if (!info->name) check near the end of the function.
Avoid assigning a placeholder string to info->name if .modinfo doesn't
exist, so that we can fall back to info->mod->name later on.
