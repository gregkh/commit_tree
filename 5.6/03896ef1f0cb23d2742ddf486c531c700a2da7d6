xsk: Change names of validation functions

Change the names of the validation functions to better reflect what
they are doing. The uppermost ones are reading entries from the rings
and only the bottom ones validate entries. So xskq_cons_read_ is a
better prefix name.

Also change the xskq_cons_read_ functions to return a bool
as the the descriptor or address is already returned by reference
in the parameters. Everyone is using the return value as a bool
anyway.
