nfs: Return EINVAL rather than ERANGE for mount parse errors

Return EINVAL rather than ERANGE for mount parse errors as the userspace
mount command doesn't necessarily understand what to do with anything other
than EINVAL.

The old code returned -ERANGE as an intermediate error that then get
converted to -EINVAL, whereas the new code returns -ERANGE.

This was induced by passing minorversion=1 to a v4 mount where
CONFIG_NFS_V4_1 was disabled in the kernel build.
