blk-mq: Remove some unused function arguments

The struct blk_mq_hw_ctx pointer argument in blk_mq_put_tag(),
blk_mq_poll_nsecs(), and blk_mq_poll_hybrid_sleep() is unused, so remove
it.

Overall obj code size shows a minor reduction, before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  27306	   1312	      0	  28618	   6fca	block/blk-mq.o
   4303	    272	      0	   4575	   11df	block/blk-mq-tag.o

after:
  27282	   1312	      0	  28594	   6fb2	block/blk-mq.o
   4311	    272	      0	   4583	   11e7	block/blk-mq-tag.o

This minor patch had been carried as part of the blk-mq shared tags RFC,
I'd rather not carry it anymore as it required rebasing, so now or never..
