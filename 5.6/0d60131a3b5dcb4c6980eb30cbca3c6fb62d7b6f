drm/bridge: Repurpose lvds-encoder.c

lvds-encoder.c implementation is also suitable for LVDS decoders,
not just LVDS encoders.
Instead of creating a new driver for addressing support for
transparent LVDS decoders, repurpose lvds-encoder.c for the greater
good with this patch.

This patch only "rebrands" the lvds-encoder.c driver, to make it
suitable for hosting LVDS decoders support. The actual support for
LVDS decoders will come with a later patch.
