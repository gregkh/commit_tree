drm/i915: Handle a few more cases for crtc hw/uapi split, v3.

We are still looking at drm_crtc_state in a few places, convert those
to use intel_crtc_state instead.

Changes since v1:
- Move to before uapi/hw split.
- Add hunks for intel_pm.c as well.
Changes since v2:
- Incorporate Ville's feedback.
