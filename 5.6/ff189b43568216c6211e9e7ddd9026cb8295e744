net/mlx5: Add ignore level support fwd to table rules

If user sets ignore flow level flag on a rule, that rule can point to
a flow table of any level, including those with levels equal or less
than the level of the flow table it is added on.

This with unamanged tables will be used to create a FDB chain/prio
hierarchy much larger than currently supported level range.
