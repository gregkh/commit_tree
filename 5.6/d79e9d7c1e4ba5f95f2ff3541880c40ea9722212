arm64: dts: ls1046ardb: set RGMII interfaces to RGMII_ID mode

The correct setting for the RGMII ports on LS1046ARDB is to
enable delay on both Rx and Tx so the interface mode used must
be PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.

Since commit 1b3047b5208a80 ("net: phy: realtek: add support for
configuring the RX delay on RTL8211F") the Realtek 8211F PHY driver
has control over the RGMII RX delay and it is disabling it for
RGMII_TXID. The LS1046ARDB uses two such PHYs in RGMII_ID mode but
in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii".

Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.
