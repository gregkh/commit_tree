arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404-evb: Set vdd_apc regulator in high power mode

vdd_apc is the regulator that supplies the main CPU cluster.

At sudden CPU load changes, we have noticed invalid page faults on
addresses with all bits shifted, as well as on addresses with individual
bits flipped.

By putting the vdd_apc regulator in high power mode, the voltage drops
during sudden load changes will be less severe, and we have not been able
to reproduce the invalid page faults with the regulator in this mode.
