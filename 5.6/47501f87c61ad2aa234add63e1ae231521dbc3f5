f2fs: preallocate DIO blocks when forcing buffered_io

The previous preallocation and DIO decision like below.

                         allow_outplace_dio              !allow_outplace_dio
f2fs_force_buffered_io   (*) No_Prealloc / Buffered_IO   Prealloc / Buffered_IO
!f2fs_force_buffered_io  No_Prealloc / DIO               Prealloc / DIO

But, Javier reported Case (*) where zoned device bypassed preallocation but
fell back to buffered writes in f2fs_direct_IO(), resulting in stale data
being read.

In order to fix the issue, actually we need to preallocate blocks whenever
we fall back to buffered IO like this. No change is made in the other cases.

                         allow_outplace_dio              !allow_outplace_dio
f2fs_force_buffered_io   (*) Prealloc / Buffered_IO      Prealloc / Buffered_IO
!f2fs_force_buffered_io  No_Prealloc / DIO               Prealloc / DIO
