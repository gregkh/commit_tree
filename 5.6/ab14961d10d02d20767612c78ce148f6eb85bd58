net: fec: validate the new settings in fec_enet_set_coalesce()

fec_enet_set_coalesce() validates the previously set params
and if they are within range proceeds to apply the new ones.
The new ones, however, are not validated. This seems backwards,
probably a copy-paste error?

Compile tested only.
