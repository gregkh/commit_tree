xsk: Simplify detection of empty and full rings

In order to set the correct return flags for poll, the xsk code has to
check if the Rx queue is empty and if the Tx queue is full. This code
was unnecessarily large and complex as it used the functions that are
used to update the local state from the global state (xskq_nb_free and
xskq_nb_avail). Since we are not doing this nor updating any data
dependent on this state, we can simplify the functions. Another
benefit from this is that we can also simplify the xskq_nb_free and
xskq_nb_avail functions in a later commit.
