clk: Add support for setting clk_rate via debugfs

For testing, it is useful to be able to specify a clock rate manually.
As this is a dangerous feature, it is not enabled by default.
Users need to modify the source directly and #define
CLOCK_ALLOW_WRITE_DEBUGFS.

This follows the spirit of commit 09c6ecd394105c48 ("regmap: Add support
for writing to regmap registers via debugfs").
