KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Fix restoration of unmapped collections

Saving/restoring an unmapped collection is a valid scenario. For
example this happens if a MAPTI command was sent, featuring an
unmapped collection. At the moment the CTE fails to be restored.
Only compare against the number of online vcpus if the rdist
base is set.
