tracing: Make sure synth_event_trace() example always uses u64

synth_event_trace() is the varargs version of synth_event_trace_array(),
which takes an array of u64, as do synth_event_add_val() et al.

To not only be consistent with those, but also to address the fact
that synth_event_trace() expects every arg to be of the same type
since it doesn't also pass in e.g. a format string, the caller needs
to make sure all args are of the same type, u64.  u64 is used because
it needs to accomodate the largest type available in synthetic events,
which is u64.

This fixes the bug reported by the kernel test robot/Rong Chen.
