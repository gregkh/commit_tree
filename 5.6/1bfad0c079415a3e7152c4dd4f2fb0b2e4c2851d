fs: ubifs: Eliminate timespec64_trunc() usage

DEFAULT_TIME_GRAN is seconds granularity. We can
just drop the nsec while creating the default root node.
Delete the unneeded call to timespec64_trunc().

Also update the ktime_get_* api to match the one used in
current_time(). This allows for the timestamps to be updated
by using the same ktime_get_* api always.
