pwm: omap-dmtimer: Remove PWM chip in .remove before making it unfunctional

In the old code (e.g.) mutex_destroy() was called before
pwmchip_remove(). Between these two calls it is possible that a PWM
callback is used which tries to grab the mutex.

Fixes: 6604c6556db9 ("pwm: Add PWM driver for OMAP using dual-mode timers")
