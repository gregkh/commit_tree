sfc: detach from cb_page in efx_copy_channel()

It's a resource, not a parameter, so we can't copy it into the new
 channel's TX queues, otherwise aliasing will lead to resource-
 management bugs if the channel is subsequently torn down without
 being initialised.

Before the Fixes:-tagged commit there was a similar bug with
 tsoh_page, but I'm not sure it's worth doing another fix for such
 old kernels.
