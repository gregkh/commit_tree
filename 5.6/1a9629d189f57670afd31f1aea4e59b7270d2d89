drm/i915: Don't show the blank process name for internal/simulated errors

For a simulated preemption reset, we don't populate the request and so
do not fill in the guilty context name.

[   79.991294] i915 0000:00:02.0: GPU HANG: ecode 9:1:e757fefe, in  [0]

Just don't mention the empty string in the logs!
