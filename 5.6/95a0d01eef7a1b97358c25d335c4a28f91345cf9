KVM: x86: Move all vcpu init code into kvm_arch_vcpu_create()

Fold init() into create() now that the two are called back-to-back by
common KVM code (kvm_vcpu_init() calls kvm_arch_vcpu_init() as its last
action, and kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu() calls kvm_arch_vcpu_create()
immediately thereafter).  This paves the way for removing
kvm_arch_vcpu_init() entirely.

No functional change intended.
