drm/bridge: split some definitions of ANX78xx to dedicated headers

Some definitions currently in analogix-anx78xx.h are not restricted to
the ANX78xx series, but also applicable to other DisplayPort
transmitters by Analogix.

Split out them to dedicated headers, and make analogix-anx78xx.h include
them.
