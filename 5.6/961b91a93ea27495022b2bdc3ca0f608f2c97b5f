ASoC: tegra: Revert 24 and 32 bit support

Commit f3ee99087c8ca0ecfdd549ef5a94f557c42d5428 ("ASoC: tegra: Allow
24bit and 32bit samples") added 24-bit and 32-bit support for to the
Tegra30 I2S driver. However, there are two additional commits that are
also needed to get 24-bit and 32-bit support to work correctly. These
commits are not yet applied because there are still some review comments
that need to be addressed. With only this change applied, 24-bit and
32-bit support is advertised by the I2S driver, but it does not work and
the audio is distorted. Therefore, revert this patch for now until the
other changes are also ready.

Furthermore, a clock issue with 24-bit support has been identified with
this change and so if we revert this now, we can also fix that in the
updated version.
