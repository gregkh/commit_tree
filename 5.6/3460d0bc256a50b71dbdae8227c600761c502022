kconfig: distinguish between dependencies and visibility in help text

Kconfig makes a distinction between dependencies (defined by "depends
on" expressions and enclosing "if" blocks) and visibility (which
includes all dependencies, but also includes inline "if" expressions of
individual properties as well as, for prompts, "visible if" expressions
of enclosing menus).

Before commit bcdedcc1afd6 ("menuconfig: print more info for symbol
without prompts"), the "Depends on" lines of a symbol's help text
indicated the visibility of the prompt property they appeared under.
After bcdedcc1afd, there was always only a single "Depends on" line,
which indicated the visibility of the first P_SYMBOL property of the
symbol. Since P_SYMBOLs never have inline if expressions, this was in
effect the same as the dependencies of the menu item that the P_SYMBOL
was attached to.

Neither of these situations accurately conveyed the dependencies of a
symbol--the first because it was actually the visibility, and the second
because it only showed the dependencies from a single definition.

With this series, we are back to printing separate dependencies for each
definition, but we print the actual dependencies (rather than the
visibility) in the "Depends on" line. However, it can still be useful to
know the visibility of a prompt, so this patch adds a "Visible if" line
that shows the visibility only if the visibility is different from the
dependencies (which it isn't for most prompts in Linux).

Before:

  Symbol: THUMB2_KERNEL [=n]
  Type  : bool
  Defined at arch/arm/Kconfig:1417
    Prompt: Compile the kernel in Thumb-2 mode
    Depends on: (CPU_V7 [=y] || CPU_V7M [=n]) && !CPU_V6 [=n] && !CPU_V6K [=n]
    Location:
      -> Kernel Features
    Selects: ARM_UNWIND [=n]

After:

   Symbol: THUMB2_KERNEL [=n]
   Type  : bool
   Defined at arch/arm/Kconfig:1417
     Prompt: Compile the kernel in Thumb-2 mode
     Depends on: (CPU_V7 [=y] || CPU_V7M [=n]) && !CPU_V6 [=n] && !CPU_V6K [=n]
     Visible if: (CPU_V7 [=y] || CPU_V7M [=n]) && !CPU_V6 [=n] && !CPU_V6K [=n] && !CPU_THUMBONLY [=n]
     Location:
       -> Kernel Features
     Selects: ARM_UNWIND [=n]
