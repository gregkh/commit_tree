RDMA/hns: Add support for reporting wc as software mode

When hardware is in resetting stage, we may can't poll back all the
expected work completions as the hardware won't generate cqe anymore.

This patch allows the driver to compose the expected wc instead of the
hardware during resetting stage. Once the hardware finished resetting, we
can poll cq from hardware again.
