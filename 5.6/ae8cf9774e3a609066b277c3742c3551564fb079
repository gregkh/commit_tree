drm/amd/display: Add some hardware status in DTN log debugfs

[Why]
For debug purpose, we need to check the following hardware status
in DTN log debugfs:
1.dpp & hubp clock enable;
2.crtc blank enable;
3.link phy status;

[How]
Add the upper information in the amdgpu_dm_dtn_log debugfs.

For CRTC blanked status, since DCN2 and greater reports it on the OPP
instead of OTG, we patch it in after calling optc1_read_otg_states.
Ideally, this should be done in the DCN version specific function hooks.
It has been left as a TODO item.
