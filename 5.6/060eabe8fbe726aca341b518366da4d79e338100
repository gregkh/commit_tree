xenbus/backend: Protect xenbus callback with lock

A driver's 'reclaim_memory' callback can race with 'probe' or 'remove'
because it will be called whenever memory pressure is detected.  To
avoid such race, this commit embeds a spinlock in each 'xenbus_device'
and make 'xenbus' to hold the lock while the corresponded callbacks are
running.
