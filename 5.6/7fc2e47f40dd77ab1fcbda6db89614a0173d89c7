dm integrity: fix invalid table returned due to argument count mismatch

If the flag SB_FLAG_RECALCULATE is present in the superblock, but it was
not specified on the command line (i.e. ic->recalculate_flag is false),
dm-integrity would return invalid table line - the reported number of
arguments would not match the real number.
