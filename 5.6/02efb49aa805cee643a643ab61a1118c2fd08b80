soundwire: qcom: add support for SoundWire controller

Qualcomm SoundWire Master controller is present in most Qualcomm SoCs
either integrated as part of WCD audio codecs via slimbus or
as part of SOC I/O.

This patchset adds support to a very basic controller which has been
tested with WCD934x SoundWire controller connected to WSA881x smart
speaker amplifiers.
