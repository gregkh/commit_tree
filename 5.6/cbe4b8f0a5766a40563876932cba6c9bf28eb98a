IB/mlx5: Unify ODP MR code paths to allow extra flexibility

Building MR translation table in the ODP case requires additional
flexibility, namely random access to DMA addresses. Make both direct and
indirect ODP MR use same code path, separated from the non-ODP MR code
path.

With the restructuring the correct page_shift is now used around
__mlx5_ib_populate_pas().
