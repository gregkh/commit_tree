ALSA: usb-audio: Apply sample rate quirk for Audioengine D1

The Audioengine D1 (0x2912:0x30c8) does support reading the sample rate,
but it returns the rate in byte-reversed order.

When setting sampling rate, the driver produces these warning messages:
[168840.944226] usb 3-2.2: current rate 4500480 is different from the runtime rate 44100
[168854.930414] usb 3-2.2: current rate 8436480 is different from the runtime rate 48000
[168905.185825] usb 3-2.1.2: current rate 30465 is different from the runtime rate 96000

As can be seen from the hexadecimal conversion, the current rate read
back is byte-reversed from the rate that was set.

44100 == 0x00ac44, 4500480 == 0x44ac00
48000 == 0x00bb80, 8436480 == 0x80bb00
96000 == 0x017700,   30465 == 0x007701

Rather than implementing a new quirk to reverse the order, just skip
checking the rate to avoid spamming the log.
