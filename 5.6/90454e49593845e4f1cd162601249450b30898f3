x86/mce: Fix mce=nobootlog

Since commit

  8b38937b7ab5 ("x86/mce: Do not enter deferred errors into the generic
		 pool twice")

the mce=nobootlog option has become mostly ineffective (after being only
slightly ineffective before), as the code is taking actions on MCEs left
over from boot when they have a usable address.

Move the check for MCP_DONTLOG a bit outward to make it effective again.

Also, since commit

  011d82611172 ("RAS: Add a Corrected Errors Collector")

the two branches of the remaining "if" at the bottom of machine_check_poll()
do same. Unify them.
