drm/amdgpu: load np fw prior before loading the TAs

Platform TAs will independently toggle DF Cstate.
for instance, get/set topology from xgmi ta. do error
injection from ras ta. In such case, PMFW needs to be
loaded before TAs so that all the subsequent Cstate
calls recieved by PSP FW can be routed to PMFW.
