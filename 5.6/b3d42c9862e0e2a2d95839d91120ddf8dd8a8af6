KVM: PPC: BookE: Setup vcpu during kvmppc_core_vcpu_create()

Fold setup() into create() now that the two are called back-to-back by
common KVM code.  This paves the way for removing kvm_arch_vcpu_setup().
Note, BookE directly implements kvm_arch_vcpu_setup() and PPC's common
kvm_arch_vcpu_create() is responsible for its own cleanup, thus the only
cleanup required when directly invoking kvmppc_core_vcpu_setup() is to
call .vcpu_free(), which is the BookE specific portion of PPC's
kvm_arch_vcpu_destroy() by way of kvmppc_core_vcpu_free().

No functional change intended.
