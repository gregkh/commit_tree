interconnect: Add a name to struct icc_path

When debugging interconnect things, it turned out that saving the path
name and including it in the traces is quite useful, especially for
devices with multiple paths.

For the path name we use the one specified in DT, or if we use platform
data, the name is based on the source and destination node names.
