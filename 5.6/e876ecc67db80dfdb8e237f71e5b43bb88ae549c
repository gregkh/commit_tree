cgroup: memcg: net: do not associate sock with unrelated cgroup

We are testing network memory accounting in our setup and noticed
inconsistent network memory usage and often unrelated cgroups network
usage correlates with testing workload. On further inspection, it
seems like mem_cgroup_sk_alloc() and cgroup_sk_alloc() are broken in
irq context specially for cgroup v1.

mem_cgroup_sk_alloc() and cgroup_sk_alloc() can be called in irq context
and kind of assumes that this can only happen from sk_clone_lock()
and the source sock object has already associated cgroup. However in
cgroup v1, where network memory accounting is opt-in, the source sock
can be unassociated with any cgroup and the new cloned sock can get
associated with unrelated interrupted cgroup.

Cgroup v2 can also suffer if the source sock object was created by
process in the root cgroup or if sk_alloc() is called in irq context.
The fix is to just do nothing in interrupt.

WARNING: Please note that about half of the TCP sockets are allocated
from the IRQ context, so, memory used by such sockets will not be
accouted by the memcg.
