netfilter: nft_fwd_netdev: allow to redirect to ifb via ingress

Set skb->tc_redirected to 1, otherwise the ifb driver drops the packet.
Set skb->tc_from_ingress to 1 to reinject the packet back to the ingress
path after leaving the ifb egress path.

This patch inconditionally sets on these two skb fields that are
meaningful to the ifb driver. The existing forward action is guaranteed
to run from ingress path.
