staging: wfx: simplify hif_set_edca_queue_params() usage

The struct hif_req_edca_queue_params comes from hardware API. It is not
intended to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

So, this patch:
  1. relocate the handling of this struct in hif_set_edca_queue_params()
     (the low level function)
  2. replace it in wfx_vif by the mac80211 equivalent: struct
     ieee80211_tx_queue_params
