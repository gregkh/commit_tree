NFS: Directory page cache pages need to be locked when read

When a NFS directory page cache page is removed from the page cache,
its contents are freed through a call to nfs_readdir_clear_array().
To prevent the removal of the page cache entry until after we've
finished reading it, we must take the page lock.
