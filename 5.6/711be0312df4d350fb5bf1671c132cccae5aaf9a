io_uring: optimise use of ctx->drain_next

Move setting ctx->drain_next to the only place it could be set, when it
got linked non-head requests. The same for checking it, it's interesting
only for a head of a link or a non-linked request.

No functional changes here. This removes some code from the common path
and also removes REQ_F_DRAIN_LINK flag, as it doesn't need it anymore.
