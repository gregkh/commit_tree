ovl: fix wrong WARN_ON() in ovl_cache_update_ino()

The WARN_ON() that child entry is always on overlay st_dev became wrong
when we allowed this function to update d_ino in non-samefs setup with xino
enabled.

It is not true in case of xino bits overflow on a non-dir inode.  Leave the
WARN_ON() only for directories, where assertion is still true.
