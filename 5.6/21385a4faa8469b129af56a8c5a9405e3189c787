ASoC: samsung: i2s: move .suspend/.resume to component

There is no big difference at implementation for .suspend/.resume
between DAI driver and Component driver.
But because some driver is using DAI version, thus ALSA SoC needs
to keep supporting it, hence, framework becoming verbose.
If we can switch all DAI driver .suspend/.resume to Component driver,
we can remove verbose code from ALSA SoC.

Driver is getting its private data via dai->dev.
But dai->dev and component->dev are same dev, thus, we can convert
these. For same reason, we can convert dai->active to
component->active if necessary.

This patch moves DAI driver .suspend/.resume to Component driver
