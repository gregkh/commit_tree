arm64: kvm: stop treating register x18 as caller save

In preparation of reserving x18, stop treating it as caller save in
the KVM guest entry/exit code. Currently, the code assumes there is
no need to preserve it for the host, given that it would have been
assumed clobbered anyway by the function call to __guest_enter().
Instead, preserve its value and restore it upon return.
