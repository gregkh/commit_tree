arm64: dts: pm8004: Add SPMI regulator and add phandles to lsids

Add the SPMI regulator node in the PM8004 LSID5 (as there is where
it resides basically 99% of the times) and set the nodes to be
disabled by default, as not all boards have both or one of the
lsids specified in this generic pm8004 DT.

While at it, also add nice phandles to the lsids specified in this
DT to allow configuration in specific board dts in a more human
readable fashion.
