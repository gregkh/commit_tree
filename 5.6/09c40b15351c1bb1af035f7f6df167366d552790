cifs: fix soft mounts hanging in the reconnect code

RHBZ: 1795423

This is the SMB1 version of a patch we already have for SMB2

In recent DFS updates we have a new variable controlling how many times we will
retry to reconnect the share.
If DFS is not used, then this variable is initialized to 0 in:

static inline int
dfs_cache_get_nr_tgts(const struct dfs_cache_tgt_list *tl)
{
        return tl ? tl->tl_numtgts : 0;
}

This means that in the reconnect loop in smb2_reconnect() we will immediately wrap retries to -1
and never actually get to pass this conditional:

                if (--retries)
                        continue;

The effect is that we no longer reach the point where we fail the commands with -EHOSTDOWN
and basically the kernel threads are virtually hung and unkillable.
