staging: wfx: simplify hif_set_template_frame() usage

The structure hif_mib_template_frame come from hardware API. It is not
intended to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

In add, the current code for hif_set_template_frame() is dumb. All the
difficult task is left to the caller. So, there is code to factorize
here.
