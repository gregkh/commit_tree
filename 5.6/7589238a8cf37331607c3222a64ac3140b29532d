Revert "software node: Simplify software_node_release() function"

This reverts commit 3df85a1ae51f6b256982fe9d17c2dc5bfb4cc402.

The reverted commit says "It's possible to release the node ID
immediately when fwnode_remove_software_node() is called, no need to
wait for software_node_release() with that." However, releasing the node
ID before waiting for software_node_release() to be called causes the
node ID to be released before the kobject and the underlying sysfs
entry; this means there is a period of time where a sysfs entry exists
that is associated with an unallocated node ID.

Once consequence of this is that there is a race condition where it is
possible to call fwnode_create_software_node() with no parent node
specified (NULL) and have it fail with -EEXIST because the node ID that
was assigned is still associated with a stale sysfs entry that hasn't
been cleaned up yet.

Although it is difficult to reproduce this race condition under normal
conditions, it can be deterministically reproduced with the following
minconfig on UML:

CONFIG_KUNIT_DRIVER_PE_TEST=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_TIMERS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE=y
CONFIG_KUNIT=y

Running the tests with this configuration causes the following failure:

<snip>
kobject: 'node0' ((____ptrval____)): kobject_release, parent (____ptrval____) (delayed 400)
