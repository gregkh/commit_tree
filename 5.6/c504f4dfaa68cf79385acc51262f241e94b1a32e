drm/i915: Do not override mode's aspect ratio with the prop value NONE

HDMI_PICTURE_ASPECT_NONE means "Automatic" so when the user has that
selected we should keep whatever aspect ratio the mode already has.

Also no point in checking for connector->is_hdmi in the SDVO code
since we only attach the property to HDMI connectors.
