usb: gadget: f_ncm: Use atomic_t to track in-flight request

Currently ncm->notify_req is used to flag when a request is in-flight.
ncm->notify_req is set to NULL and when a request completes it is
subsequently reset.

This is fundamentally buggy in that the unbind logic of the NCM driver will
unconditionally free ncm->notify_req leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
