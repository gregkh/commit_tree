cros_ec: treewide: Remove 'include/linux/mfd/cros_ec.h'

This header file now only includes the cros_ec_dev struct, however, is the
'include/linux/platform_data/cros_ec_proto.h' who contains the definition of
all the Chrome OS EC related structs. There is no reason to have a
separate include for this struct so move to the place where other
structs are defined. That way, we can remove the include itself, but also
simplify the common pattern

    #include <linux/mfd/cros_ec.h>
    #include <linux/platform_data/cros_ec_proto.h>

for a single include

    #include <linux/platform_data/cros_ec_proto.h>

The changes to remove the cros_ec.h include were generated with the
following shell script:

    git grep -l "<linux/mfd/cros_ec.h>" | xargs sed -i '/<linux\/mfd\/cros_ec.h>/d'
