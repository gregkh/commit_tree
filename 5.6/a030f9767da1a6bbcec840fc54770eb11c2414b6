locking/lockdep: Fix lockdep_stats indentation problem

It was found that two lines in the output of /proc/lockdep_stats have
indentation problem:

  # cat /proc/lockdep_stats
     :
   in-process chains:                   25057
   stack-trace entries:                137827 [max: 524288]
   number of stack traces:        7973
   number of stack hash chains:   6355
   combined max dependencies:      1356414598
   hardirq-safe locks:                     57
   hardirq-unsafe locks:                 1286
     :

All the numbers displayed in /proc/lockdep_stats except the two stack
trace numbers are formatted with a field with of 11. To properly align
all the numbers, a field width of 11 is now added to the two stack
trace numbers.
