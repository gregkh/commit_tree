iommu/vt-d: Setup pasid entries for iova over first level

Intel VT-d in scalable mode supports two types of page tables for
IOVA translation: first level and second level. The IOMMU driver
can choose one from both for IOVA translation according to the use
case. This sets up the pasid entry if a domain is selected to use
the first-level page table for iova translation.
