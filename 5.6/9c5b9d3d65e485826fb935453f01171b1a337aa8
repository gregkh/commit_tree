tracing/boot: Add boot-time tracing

Setup tracing options via extra boot config in addition to kernel
command line.

This adds following commands support. These are applied to
the global trace instance.

 - ftrace.options = OPT1[,OPT2...]
   Enable given ftrace options.

 - ftrace.trace_clock = CLOCK
   Set given CLOCK to ftrace's trace_clock.

 - ftrace.buffer_size = SIZE
   Configure ftrace buffer size to SIZE. You can use "KB" or "MB"
   for that SIZE.

 - ftrace.events = EVENT[, EVENT2...]
   Enable given events on boot. You can use a wild card in EVENT.

 - ftrace.tracer = TRACER
   Set TRACER to current tracer on boot. (e.g. function)

Note that this is NOT replacing the kernel parameters, because
this boot config based setting is later than that. If you want to
trace earlier boot events, you still need kernel parameters.
