drm/i915/dsi: Init panel-enable GPIO to low when the LCD is initially off (v2)

When the LCD has not been turned on by the firmware/GOP, because e.g. the
device was booted with an external monitor connected over HDMI, we should
not turn on the panel-enable GPIO when we request it.

Turning on the panel-enable GPIO when we request it, means we turn it on
too early in the init-sequence, which causes some panels to not correctly
light up.

This commits adds a panel_is_on parameter to intel_dsi_vbt_gpio_init()
and makes intel_dsi_vbt_gpio_init() set the initial GPIO value accordingly.

This fixes the panel not lighting up on a Thundersoft TST168 tablet when
booted with an external monitor connected over HDMI.

Changes in v2:
- Call intel_dsi_get_hw_state() to check if the panel is on instead of
  relying on the current_mode pointer
