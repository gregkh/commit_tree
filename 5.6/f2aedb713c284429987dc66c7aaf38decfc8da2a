NFS: Add fs_context support.

Add filesystem context support to NFS, parsing the options in advance and
attaching the information to struct nfs_fs_context.  The highlights are:

 (*) Merge nfs_mount_info and nfs_clone_mount into nfs_fs_context.  This
     structure represents NFS's superblock config.

 (*) Make use of the VFS's parsing support to split comma-separated lists

 (*) Pin the NFS protocol module in the nfs_fs_context.

 (*) Attach supplementary error information to fs_context.  This has the
     downside that these strings must be static and can't be formatted.

 (*) Remove the auxiliary file_system_type structs since the information
     necessary can be conveyed in the nfs_fs_context struct instead.

 (*) Root mounts are made by duplicating the config for the requested mount
     so as to have the same parameters.  Submounts pick up their parameters
     from the parent superblock.

[AV -- retrans is u32, not string]
[SM -- Renamed cfg to ctx in a few functions in an earlier patch]
[SM -- Moved fs_context mount option parsing to an earlier patch]
[SM -- Moved fs_context error logging to a later patch]
[SM -- Fixed printks in nfs4_try_get_tree() and nfs4_get_referral_tree()]
[SM -- Added is_remount_fc() helper]
[SM -- Deferred some refactoring to a later patch]
[SM -- Fixed referral mounts, which were broken in the original patch]
[SM -- Fixed leak of nfs_fattr when fs_context is freed]
