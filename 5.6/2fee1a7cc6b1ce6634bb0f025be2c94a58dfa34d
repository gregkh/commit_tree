PM / devfreq: Add new name attribute for sysfs

The commit 4585fbcb5331 ("PM / devfreq: Modify the device name as devfreq(X) for
sysfs") changed the node name to devfreq(x). After this commit, it is not
possible to get the device name through /sys/class/devfreq/devfreq(X)/*.

Add new name attribute in order to get device name.
