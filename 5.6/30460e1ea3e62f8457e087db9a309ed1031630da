fs: Enable bmap() function to properly return errors

By now, bmap() will either return the physical block number related to
the requested file offset or 0 in case of error or the requested offset
maps into a hole.
This patch makes the needed changes to enable bmap() to proper return
errors, using the return value as an error return, and now, a pointer
must be passed to bmap() to be filled with the mapped physical block.

It will change the behavior of bmap() on return:

- negative value in case of error
- zero on success or map fell into a hole

In case of a hole, the *block will be zero too

Since this is a prep patch, by now, the only error return is -EINVAL if
->bmap doesn't exist.
