SMB3: Backup intent flag missing from some more ops

When "backup intent" is requested on the mount (e.g. backupuid or
backupgid mount options), the corresponding flag was missing from
some of the operations.

Change all operations to use the macro cifs_create_options() to
set the backup intent flag if needed.
