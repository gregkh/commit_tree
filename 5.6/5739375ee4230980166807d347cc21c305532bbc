cifs: Fix mount options set in automount

Starting from 4a367dc04435, we must set the mount options based on the
DFS full path rather than the resolved target, that is, cifs_mount()
will be responsible for resolving the DFS link (cached) as well as
performing failover to any other targets in the referral.
