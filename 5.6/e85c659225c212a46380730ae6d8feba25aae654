drm/dsi: clean up DSI data type definitions

Rename picture parameter set (it's a long packet, not a long write) and
compression mode (it's not a DCS command) enumerations according to the
DSI specification. Order the types according to the spec. Use tabs
instead of spaces for indentation. Use all lower case for hex.
