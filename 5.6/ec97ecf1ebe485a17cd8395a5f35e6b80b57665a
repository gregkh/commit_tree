net: sched: add Flow Queue PIE packet scheduler

Principles:
  - Packets are classified on flows.
  - This is a Stochastic model (as we use a hash, several flows might
                                be hashed to the same slot)
  - Each flow has a PIE managed queue.
  - Flows are linked onto two (Round Robin) lists,
    so that new flows have priority on old ones.
  - For a given flow, packets are not reordered.
  - Drops during enqueue only.
  - ECN capability is off by default.
  - ECN threshold (if ECN is enabled) is at 10% by default.
  - Uses timestamps to calculate queue delay by default.

Usage:
tc qdisc ... fq_pie [ limit PACKETS ] [ flows NUMBER ]
                    [ target TIME ] [ tupdate TIME ]
                    [ alpha NUMBER ] [ beta NUMBER ]
                    [ quantum BYTES ] [ memory_limit BYTES ]
                    [ ecnprob PERCENTAGE ] [ [no]ecn ]
                    [ [no]bytemode ] [ [no_]dq_rate_estimator ]

defaults:
  limit: 10240 packets, flows: 1024
  target: 15 ms, tupdate: 15 ms (in jiffies)
  alpha: 1/8, beta : 5/4
  quantum: device MTU, memory_limit: 32 Mb
  ecnprob: 10%, ecn: off
  bytemode: off, dq_rate_estimator: off
