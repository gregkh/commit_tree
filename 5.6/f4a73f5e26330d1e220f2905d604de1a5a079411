pinctrl: qcom: sc7180: Add new qup functions

on sc7180 we have cases where multiple functions from the same
qup instance share the same pin. This is true for qup02/04/11 and qup13.
Add new function names to distinguish which qup function to use.

The device tree files for this platform haven't landed in mainline yet,
so there aren't any users upstream who should break with this change
in function names, however, anyone using the devicetree files that were
posted on the lists and using these specific function names will need
to update their changes.
