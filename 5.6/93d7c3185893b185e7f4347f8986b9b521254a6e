null_blk: remove unused fields in 'nullb_cmd'

'list', 'll_list' and 'csd' are no longer used.

The 'list' is not used since it was introduced by commit f2298c0403b0
("null_blk: multi queue aware block test driver").

The 'll_list' is no longer used since commit 3c395a969acc ("null_blk: set a
separate timer for each command").

The 'csd' is no longer used since commit ce2c350b2cfe ("null_blk: use
blk_complete_request and blk_mq_complete_request").
