cpuidle: Drop unused cpuidle_driver_ref/unref() functions

The cpuidle_driver_ref() and cpuidle_driver_unref() functions are not
used and the refcnt field in struct cpuidle_driver operated by them
is not updated anywhere else (so it is permanently equal to 0), so
drop both of them along with refcnt.
