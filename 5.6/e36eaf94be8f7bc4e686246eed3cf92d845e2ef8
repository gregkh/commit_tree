gpio: gpio-grgpio: fix possible sleep-in-atomic-context bugs in grgpio_irq_map/unmap()

The driver may sleep while holding a spinlock.
The function call path (from bottom to top) in Linux 4.19 is:

drivers/gpio/gpio-grgpio.c, 261:
	request_irq in grgpio_irq_map
drivers/gpio/gpio-grgpio.c, 255:
	_raw_spin_lock_irqsave in grgpio_irq_map

drivers/gpio/gpio-grgpio.c, 318:
	free_irq in grgpio_irq_unmap
drivers/gpio/gpio-grgpio.c, 299:
	_raw_spin_lock_irqsave in grgpio_irq_unmap

request_irq() and free_irq() can sleep at runtime.

To fix these bugs, request_irq() and free_irq() are called without
holding the spinlock.

These bugs are found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by myself.
