drm/amd/display: include linux/slab.h where needed

Calling kzalloc() and related functions requires the
linux/slab.h header to be included:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn21/dcn21_resource.c: In function 'dcn21_ipp_create':
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn21/dcn21_resource.c:679:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'kzalloc'; did you mean 'd_alloc'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
   kzalloc(sizeof(struct dcn10_ipp), GFP_KERNEL);

A lot of other headers also miss a direct include in this file,
but this is the only one that causes a problem for now.
