rcu: Use lockdep rather than comment to enforce lock held

The rcu_preempt_check_blocked_tasks() function has a comment
that states that the rcu_node structure's ->lock must be held,
which might be informative, but which carries little weight if
not read.  This commit therefore removes this comment in favor of
raw_lockdep_assert_held_rcu_node(), which will complain quite
visibly if the required lock is not held.
