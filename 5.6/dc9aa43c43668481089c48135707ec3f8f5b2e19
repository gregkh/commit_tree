phy: usb: EHCI DMA may lose a burst of DMA data for 7255xA0 family

When the EHCI controller received a 512 byte USB packet that
had to be broken into 2 256 byte bursts across the SCB bus AND
there was a following 512 byte USB packet, the second burst of
data from the first packet was sometimes being lost. If the
burst size was changed to 128 bytes via the EBR_SCB_SIZE field
in the USB_CTRL_EBRIDGE register we'd see the 4th 128 byte burst
of the first packet being lost. This problem became much worse
if other threads were running that accessed memory, like a memcpy
test. Setting the EBR_SCB_SIZE to 512, which prevents breaking
the EHCI USB packet (max size of 512 bytes) into bursts, fixed
the problem.
