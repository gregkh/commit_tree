mmc: sdhci-acpi: Disable write protect detection on Acer Aspire Switch 10 (SW5-012)

On the Acer Aspire Switch 10 (SW5-012) microSD slot always reports the card
being write-protected even though microSD cards do not have a write-protect
switch at all.

Add a new DMI_QUIRK_SD_NO_WRITE_PROTECT quirk which when set sets
the MMC_CAP2_NO_WRITE_PROTECT flag on the controller for the external SD
slot; and add a DMI quirk table entry which selects this quirk for the
Acer SW5-012.
