drm/tegra: Delete host1x_bo_ops->k(un)map

It doesn't have any callers anymore.

Aside: The ->mmap/munmap hooks have a bit a confusing name, they don't
do userspace mmaps, but a kernel vmap. I think most places use vmap
for this, except ttm, which uses kmap for vmap for added confusion.
mmap seems entirely for userspace mappings set up through mmap(2)
syscall.
