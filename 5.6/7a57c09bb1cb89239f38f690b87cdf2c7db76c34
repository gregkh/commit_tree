KVM: VMX: Condition ENCLS-exiting enabling on CPU support for SGX1

Enable ENCLS-exiting (and thus set vmcs.ENCLS_EXITING_BITMAP) only if
the CPU supports SGX1.  Per Intel's SDM, all ENCLS leafs #UD if SGX1
is not supported[*], i.e. intercepting ENCLS to inject a #UD is
unnecessary.

Avoiding ENCLS-exiting even when it is reported as supported by the CPU
works around a reported issue where SGX is "hard" disabled after an S3
suspend/resume cycle, i.e. CPUID.0x7.SGX=0 and the VMCS field/control
are enumerated as unsupported.  While the root cause of the S3 issue is
unknown, it's definitely _not_ a KVM (or kernel) bug, i.e. this is a
workaround for what is most likely a hardware or firmware issue.  As a
bonus side effect, KVM saves a VMWRITE when first preparing vmcs01 and
vmcs02.

Note, SGX must be disabled in BIOS to take advantage of this workaround

[*] The additional ENCLS CPUID check on SGX1 exists so that SGX can be
    globally "soft" disabled post-reset, e.g. if #MC bits in MCi_CTL are
    cleared.  Soft disabled meaning disabling SGX without clearing the
    primary CPUID bit (in leaf 0x7) and without poking into non-SGX
    CPU paths, e.g. for the VMCS controls.
