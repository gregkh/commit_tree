drm/amd/display: Use SMU ClockTable Values for DML Calculations

[Why]
DML Initialization was previously done on dcn21_resource initialization.
This meant that DML soc struct was populated with hardcoded values.

[How]
Move DML initialization to after updating bounding box, to use clock table
values from SMU.
