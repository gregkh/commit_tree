enetc: Make MDIO accessors more generic and export to include/linux/fsl

Within the LS1028A SoC, the register map for the ENETC MDIO controller
is instantiated a few times: for the central (external) MDIO controller,
for the internal bus of each standalone ENETC port, and for the internal
bus of the Felix switch.

Refactoring is needed to support multiple MDIO buses from multiple
drivers. The enetc_hw structure is made an opaque type and a smaller
enetc_mdio_priv is created.

'mdio_base' - MDIO registers base address - is being parameterized, to
be able to work with different MDIO register bases.

The ENETC MDIO bus operations are exported from the fsl-enetc-mdio
kernel object, the same that registers the central MDIO controller (the
dedicated PF). The ENETC main driver has been changed to select it, and
use its exported helpers to further register its private MDIO bus. The
DSA Felix driver will do the same.
