Documentation: Call out example SYM_FUNC_* usage as x86-specific

The example given in asm-annotations.rst to describe the constraints that
a function should meet in order to be annotated with a SYM_FUNC_* macro
is x86-specific, and not necessarily applicable to architectures using
branch-and-link style calling conventions such as arm64.

Tweak the example text to call out the x86-specific text.
