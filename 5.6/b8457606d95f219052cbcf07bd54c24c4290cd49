SUNRPC: call_connect_status should handle -EPROTO

The xprtrdma connect logic can return -EPROTO if the underlying
device or network path does not support RDMA. This can happen
after a device removal/insertion.

- When SOFTCONN is set, EPROTO is a permanent error.

- When SOFTCONN is not set, EPROTO is treated as a temporary error.
