KVM: SVM: Issue WBINVD after deactivating an SEV guest

Currently, CLFLUSH is used to flush SEV guest memory before the guest is
terminated (or a memory hotplug region is removed). However, CLFLUSH is
not enough to ensure that SEV guest tagged data is flushed from the cache.

With 33af3a7ef9e6 ("KVM: SVM: Reduce WBINVD/DF_FLUSH invocations"), the
original WBINVD was removed. This then exposed crashes at random times
because of a cache flush race with a page that had both a hypervisor and
a guest tag in the cache.

Restore the WBINVD when destroying an SEV guest and add a WBINVD to the
svm_unregister_enc_region() function to ensure hotplug memory is flushed
when removed. The DF_FLUSH can still be avoided at this point.
