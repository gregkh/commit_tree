selftests/bpf: Add tests for libbpf-provided externs

Add a set of tests validating libbpf-provided extern variables. One crucial
feature that's tested is dead code elimination together with using invalid BPF
helper. CONFIG_MISSING is not supposed to exist and should always be specified
by libbpf as zero, which allows BPF verifier to correctly do branch pruning
and not fail validation, when invalid BPF helper is called from dead if branch.
