intel_idle: Introduce 'use_acpi' module parameter

For diagnostics, it is generally useful to be able to make intel_idle
take the system's ACPI tables into consideration even if that is not
required for the processor model in there, so introduce a new module
parameter, 'use_acpi', to make that happen and update the documentation
to cover it.

While at it, fix the 'no_acpi' module parameter name in the
documentation.
