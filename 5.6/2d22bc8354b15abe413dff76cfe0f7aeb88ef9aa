qed: FW 8.42.2.0 debug features

Add to debug dump more information on the platform it was collected
from (pci func, path id).
Provide human readable reg fifo erros.

Removed static debug arrays from HSI Functions, and move them to
the hwfn.

Some structures were slightly changed (removing reserved chip id
for example) which lead to many long initializations being modified
with one parameter less during initialization. This leads to
some long diffs that don't really change anything.
