tracing: Simplify assignment parsing for hist triggers

In the process of adding better error messages for sorting, I realized
that strsep was being used incorrectly and some of the error paths I
was expecting to be hit weren't and just fell through to the common
invalid key error case.

It also became obvious that for keyword assignments, it wasn't
necessary to save the full assignment and reparse it later, and having
a common empty-assignment check would also make more sense in terms of
error processing.

Change the code to fix these problems and simplify it for new error
message changes in a subsequent patch.
