docs: virt: convert UML documentation to ReST

Despite being an old document, it contains lots of information
that could still be useful.

The document has a nice style with makes easy to convert to
ReST. So, let's convert it to ReST.

This patch does:

	- Use proper markups for titles;
	- Mark and proper indent literal blocks;
	- don't use an 'o' character for lists;
	- other minor changes required for the doc to be parsed.
