net: tulip: Adjust indentation in {dmfe, uli526x}_init_module

Clang warns:

../drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c:1812:3: warning: misleading
indentation; statement is not part of the previous 'if'
[-Wmisleading-indentation]
        switch (mode) {
        ^
../drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/uli526x.c:1809:2: note: previous
statement is here
        if (cr6set)
        ^
1 warning generated.

../drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/dmfe.c:2217:3: warning: misleading
indentation; statement is not part of the previous 'if'
[-Wmisleading-indentation]
        switch(mode) {
        ^
../drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/dmfe.c:2214:2: note: previous
statement is here
        if (cr6set)
        ^
1 warning generated.

This warning occurs because there is a space before the tab on these
lines. Remove them so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux
kernel coding style and clang no longer warns.

While we are here, adjust the default block in dmfe_init_module to have
a proper break between the label and assignment and add a space between
the switch and opening parentheses to avoid a checkpatch warning.
