s390: adjust -mpacked-stack support check for clang 10

clang 10 introduces -mpacked-stack compiler option implementation. At the
same time currently it does not support a combination of -mpacked-stack
and -mbackchain. This leads to the following build error:

clang: error: unsupported option '-mpacked-stack with -mbackchain' for
target 's390x-ibm-linux'

If/when clang adds support for a combination of -mpacked-stack and
-mbackchain it would also require -msoft-float (like gcc does). According
to Ulrich Weigand "stack slot assigned to the kernel backchain overlaps
the stack slot assigned to the FPR varargs (both are required to be
placed immediately after the saved r15 slot if present)."

Extend -mpacked-stack compiler option support check to include all 3
options -mpacked-stack -mbackchain -msoft-float which must present to
support -mpacked-stack with -mbackchain.
