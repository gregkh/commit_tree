backlight: bd6107: Convert to use GPIO descriptor

The Rohm BD6107 driver can pass a fixed GPIO line using the old
GPIO API using platform data. As there are no in-tree users of this
platform data since 2013, we can convert this to use a GPIO descriptor
and require any out-of-tree consumers to pass the GPIO using
a machine descriptor table instead.
