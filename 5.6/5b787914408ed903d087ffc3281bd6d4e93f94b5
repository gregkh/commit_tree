xtensa: drop unused function fast_coprocessor_double

fast_coprocessor_double is not used since commit c658eac628aa ("[XTENSA]
Add support for configurable registers and coprocessors"). Remove it.
There should be no coprocessor exceptions generated in the exception
handling paths while PS.EXCM is set.
