KVM: x86: Mark CR4.UMIP as reserved based on associated CPUID bit

Re-add code to mark CR4.UMIP as reserved if UMIP is not supported by the
host.  The UMIP handling was unintentionally dropped during a recent
refactoring.

Not flagging CR4.UMIP allows the guest to set its CR4.UMIP regardless of
host support or userspace desires.  On CPUs with UMIP support, including
emulated UMIP, this allows the guest to enable UMIP against the wishes
of the userspace VMM.  On CPUs without any form of UMIP, this results in
a failed VM-Enter due to invalid guest state.
