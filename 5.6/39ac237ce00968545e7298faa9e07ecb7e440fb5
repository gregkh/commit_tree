net/mlx5: E-Switch, Refactor chains and priorities

To support the entire chain and prio range (32bit + 16bit),
instead of a using a static array of chains/prios of limited size, create
them dynamically, and use a rhashtable to search for existing chains/prio
combinations.

This will be used in next patch to actually increase the number using
unamanged tables support and ignore flow level capability.
