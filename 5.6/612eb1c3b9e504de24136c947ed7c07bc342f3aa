Revert "net: bcmgenet: use RGMII loopback for MAC reset"

This reverts commit 3a55402c93877d291b0a612d25edb03d1b4b93ac.

This is not a good solution when connecting to an external switch
that may not support the isolation of the TXC signal resulting in
output driver contention on the pin.

A different solution is necessary.
