list: Add hlist_unhashed_lockless()

We would like to use hlist_unhashed() from timer_pending(),
which runs without protection of a lock.

Note that other callers might also want to use this variant.

Instead of forcing a READ_ONCE() for all hlist_unhashed()
callers, add a new helper with an explicit _lockless suffix
in the name to better document what is going on.

Also add various WRITE_ONCE() in __hlist_del(), hlist_add_head()
and hlist_add_before()/hlist_add_behind() to pair with
the READ_ONCE().
