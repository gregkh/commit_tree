KVM: x86: remove stale comment from struct x86_emulate_ctxt

Commit c44b4c6ab80e ("KVM: emulate: clean up initializations in
init_decode_cache") did some field shuffling and instead of
[opcode_len, _regs) started clearing [has_seg_override, modrm).
The comment about clearing fields altogether is not true anymore.
