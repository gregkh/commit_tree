iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use WRITE_ONCE() when changing validity of an STE

If, for some bizarre reason, the compiler decided to split up the write
of STE DWORD 0, we could end up making a partial structure valid.

Although this probably won't happen, follow the example of the
context-descriptor code and use WRITE_ONCE() to ensure atomicity of the
write.
