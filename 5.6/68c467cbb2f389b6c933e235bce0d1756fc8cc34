btrfs: separate definition of assertion failure handlers

There's a report where objtool detects unreachable instructions, eg.:

  fs/btrfs/ctree.o: warning: objtool: btrfs_search_slot()+0x2d4: unreachable instruction

This seems to be a false positive due to compiler version. The cause is
in the ASSERT macro implementation that does the conditional check as
IS_DEFINED(CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT) and not an #ifdef.

To avoid that, use the ifdefs directly.

There are still 2 reports that aren't fixed:

  fs/btrfs/extent_io.o: warning: objtool: __set_extent_bit()+0x71f: unreachable instruction
  fs/btrfs/relocation.o: warning: objtool: find_data_references()+0x4e0: unreachable instruction
