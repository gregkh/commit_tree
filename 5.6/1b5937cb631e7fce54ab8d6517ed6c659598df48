platform/x86: mlx-platform: Add more definitions for system attributes

Add new attributes for "next-generation" type systems:
- Reset cause indication, when system reset has been caused by the
  platform reset request through CPLD, by AC power failure,
  by software power off request through CPLD. by signal asserted by SOC
  through ACPI register. It introduces more reset causes, which can
  be monitored after the reboots.
- Setting and removing system VPD (EEPROM) hardware write protection.
  It allows to access VPD during production cycle and prevents VPD
  corruption on system in field.
- Voltage regulator devices configuration update status and version. It
  allows to monitor configuration update status and current active
  version for such sort of devices.
- PCIe ASIC reset disable - when set ASIC will go down upon PCIe
  root complex reset, otherwise ASIC will stay up during PCIe root
  complex reset.
- System configuration Ids to provide system static topology
  identification, like system's static I2C topology, number and type of
  FPGA devices within the system and so on.

Add the existing attribute for "iio" bank selection for system type
"msn21xx".

All the above attributes are exposed through "sysfs" by "mlxreg-io"
driver.
