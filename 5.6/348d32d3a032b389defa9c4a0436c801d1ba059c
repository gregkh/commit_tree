media: ti-vpe: cal: Properly calculate max resolution boundary

Currently we were using an arbitrarily small maximum resolution mostly
based on available sensor capabilities. However the hardware DMA limits
are much higher than the statically define maximum resolution we were
using.

There we rework the boundary check code to handle the maximum width and
height based on the maximum line width in bytes and re-calculating the
pixel width based on the given pixel format.
