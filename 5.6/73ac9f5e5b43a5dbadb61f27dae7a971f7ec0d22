ALSA: usb-audio: Add boot quirk for MOTU M Series

Add delay to make sure that audio urbs are not sent too early.
Otherwise the device hangs. Windows driver makes ~2s delay, so use
about the same time delay value.

snd_usb_apply_boot_quirk() is called 3 times for my MOTU M4, which
is an overkill. Thus a quirk that is called only once is implemented.

Also send two vendor-specific control messages before and after
the delay. This behaviour is blindly copied from the Windows driver.
