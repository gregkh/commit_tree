soc/tegra: fuse: Warn if straps are not ready

Now both Chip ID and HW straps are becoming available at the same time,
thus we could simply check the availability of the ID in order to check
the availability of the straps. We couldn't check straps for 0x0 because
it could be a correct value.

This change didn't uncover any problems, but anyways it is nicer to have
straps verified for consistency with the Chip ID verification.
