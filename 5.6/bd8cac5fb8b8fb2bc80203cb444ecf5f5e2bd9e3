ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: Fix incorrect clk and reset macros for EMAC device

When the raw numbers used for clk and reset indices in the EMAC device
node were converted to the new macros, the order of the clk and reset
properties was overlooked, and thus the incorrect macros were used.
This results in the EMAC being non-responsive, as well as an oops due
to incorrect usage of the reset control.

Correct the macro types, and also reorder the clk and reset properties
to match all the other device nodes.
