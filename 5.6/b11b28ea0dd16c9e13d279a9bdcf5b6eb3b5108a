drm/i915/gt: Pull context activation into central intel_context_pin()

While this is encroaching on midlayer territory, having already made the
state allocation a previous step in pinning, we can now pull the common
intel_context_active_acquire() into intel_context_pin() itself. This is
a prelude to make the activation a separate step inside pinning, outside
of the ce->pin_mutex
