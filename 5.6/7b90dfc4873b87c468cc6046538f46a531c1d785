PCI: Add DMA alias quirk for PLX PEX NTB

The PLX PEX NTB forwards DMA transactions using Requester IDs that don't
exist as PCI devices.  The devfn for a transaction is used as an index into
a lookup table storing the origin of a transaction on the other side of the
bridge.

Alias all possible devfns to the NTB device so that any transaction coming
in is governed by the mappings for the NTB.
