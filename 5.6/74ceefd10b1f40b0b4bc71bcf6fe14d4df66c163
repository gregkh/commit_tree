drm/i915: use might_lock_nested in get_pages annotation

So strictly speaking the existing annotation is also ok, because we
have a chain of

obj->mm.lock#I915_MM_GET_PAGES -> fs_reclaim -> obj->mm.lock

(the shrinker cannot get at an object while we're in get_pages, hence
this is safe). But it's confusing, so try to take the right subclass
of the lock.

This does a bit reduce our lockdep based checking, but then it's also
less fragile, in case we ever change the nesting around.
