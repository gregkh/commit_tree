arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404: Add DVFS support

Support dynamic voltage and frequency scaling on qcs404.

CPUFreq will soon be superseded by Core Power Reduction (CPR, a form
of Adaptive Voltage Scaling found on some Qualcomm SoCs like the
qcs404).

Due to the CPR upstreaming already being in progress - and some
commits already merged -  the following commit will need to be
reverted to enable CPUFreq support
