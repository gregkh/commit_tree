clk: tegra: Mark fuse clock as critical

For a little over a year, U-Boot on Tegra124 has configured the flow
controller to perform automatic RAM re-repair on off->on power
transitions of the CPU rail[1]. This is mandatory for correct operation
of Tegra124. However, RAM re-repair relies on certain clocks, which the
kernel must enable and leave running. The fuse clock is one of those
clocks. Mark this clock as critical so that LP1 power mode (system
suspend) operates correctly.
