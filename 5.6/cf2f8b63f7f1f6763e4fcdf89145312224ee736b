usb: dwc3: gadget: Remove END_TRANSFER delay

We had a 100us delay to synchronize the END_TRANSFER command completion
before giving back requests to the function drivers. Now, the controller
driver can handle cancelled TRBs with the requests' cancelled_list and
it can also wait until the END_TRANSFER completion before starting new
transfers. Synchronization can simply base on the controller's command
completion interrupt. The 100us delay is no longer needed. Remove this
arbitrary delay.
