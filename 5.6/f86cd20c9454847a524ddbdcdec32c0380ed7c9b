io_uring: fix linked command file table usage

We're not consistent in how the file table is grabbed and assigned if we
have a command linked that requires the use of it.

Add ->file_table to the io_op_defs[] array, and use that to determine
when to grab the table instead of having the handlers set it if they
need to defer. This also means we can kill the IO_WQ_WORK_NEEDS_FILES
flag. We always initialize work->files, so io-wq can just check for
that.
