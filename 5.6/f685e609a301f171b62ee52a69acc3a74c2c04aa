net: dsa: Deny PTP on master if switch supports it

It is possible to kill PTP on a DSA switch completely and absolutely,
until a reboot, with a simple command:

tcpdump -i eth2 -j adapter_unsynced

where eth2 is the switch's DSA master.

Why? Well, in short, the PTP API in place today is a bit rudimentary and
relies on applications to retrieve the TX timestamps by polling the
error queue and looking at the cmsg structure. But there is no timestamp
identification of any sorts (except whether it's HW or SW), you don't
know how many more timestamps are there to come, which one is this one,
from whom it is, etc. In other words, the SO_TIMESTAMPING API is
fundamentally limited in that you can get a single HW timestamp from the
stack.

And the "-j adapter_unsynced" flag of tcpdump enables hardware
timestamping.

So let's imagine what happens when the DSA master decides it wants to
deliver TX timestamps to the skb's socket too:
- The timestamp that the user space sees is taken by the DSA master.
  Whereas the RX timestamp will eventually be overwritten by the DSA
  switch. So the RX and TX timestamps will be in different time bases
  (aka garbage).
- The user space applications have no way to deal with the second (real)
  TX timestamp finally delivered by the DSA switch, or even to know to
  wait for it.

Take ptp4l from the linuxptp project, for example. This is its behavior
after running tcpdump, before the patch:

The ptp4l program itself is heavily patched to show this (more details
here [0]). Otherwise, by default it just hangs.

On the other hand, with the DSA patch to disallow HW timestamping
applied:

tcpdump -i eth2 -j adapter_unsynced
tcpdump: SIOCSHWTSTAMP failed: Device or resource busy

So it is a fact of life that PTP timestamping on the DSA master is
incompatible with timestamping on the switch MAC, at least with the
current API. And if the switch supports PTP, taking the timestamps from
the switch MAC is highly preferable anyway, due to the fact that those
don't contain the queuing latencies of the switch. So just disallow PTP
on the DSA master if there is any PTP-capable switch attached.
