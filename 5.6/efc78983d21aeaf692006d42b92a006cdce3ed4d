iio: st_sensors: Drop redundant parameter from st_sensors_of_name_probe()

Since we have access to the struct device_driver and thus to the ID table,
there is no need to supply special parameters to st_sensors_of_name_probe().

Besides that we have a common API to get driver match data, there is
no need to do matching separately for OF and ACPI.

Taking into consideration above, simplify the ST sensors code.
