crypto: shash - Add init_tfm/exit_tfm and verify descsize

The shash interface supports a dynamic descsize field because of
the presence of fallbacks (it's just padlock-sha actually, perhaps
we can remove it one day).  As it is the API does not verify the
setting of descsize at all.  It is up to the individual algorithms
to ensure that descsize does not exceed the specified maximum value
of HASH_MAX_DESCSIZE (going above would cause stack corruption).

In order to allow the API to impose this limit directly, this patch
adds init_tfm/exit_tfm hooks to the shash_alg structure.  We can
then verify the descsize setting in the API directly.
