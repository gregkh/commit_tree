bpf: Allow to resolve bpf trampoline and dispatcher in unwind

When unwinding the stack we need to identify each address
to successfully continue. Adding latch tree to keep trampolines
for quick lookup during the unwind.

The patch uses first 48 bytes for latch tree node, leaving 4048
bytes from the rest of the page for trampoline or dispatcher
generated code.

It's still enough not to affect trampoline and dispatcher progs
maximum counts.
