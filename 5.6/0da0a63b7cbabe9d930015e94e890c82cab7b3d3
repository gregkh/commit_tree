HID: logitech-hidpp: Support WirelessDeviceStatus connect events

This patch allows hidpp_report_is_connect_event to support
WirelessDeviceStatus connect events.

The WirelessDeviceStatus feature index is stored in hidpp_device when
probed. The connect event's fap feature_index is compared against it if the
device supports it.
