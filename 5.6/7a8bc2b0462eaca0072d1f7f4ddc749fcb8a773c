x86/mce: Fix use of uninitialized MCE message string

The function mce_severity() is not required to update its msg argument.
In fact, mce_severity_amd() does not, which makes mce_no_way_out()
return uninitialized data, which may be used later for printing.

Assuming that implementations of mce_severity() either always or never
update the msg argument (which is currently the case), it is sufficient
to initialize the temporary variable in mce_no_way_out().

While at it, avoid printing a useless "Unknown".
