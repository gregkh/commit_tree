rtw88: add interface config for 8822c

Some devices need to configure interface/HCI related reigsters
in power on flow. Add interface_cfg for HCI for the settings.

The driver only supports RTL8822BE/RTL8822CE now, and since
RTL8822BE does not need to configure PCIE, the configuration
is only added for RTL8822CE. Without it, some of the RTL8822CE
device can crash and disconnected to host in suspend/wowlan mode.
