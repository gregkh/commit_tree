bpf: Support bitfield read access in btf_struct_access

This patch allows bitfield access as a scalar.

It checks "off + size > t->size" to avoid accessing bitfield
end up accessing beyond the struct.  This check is done
outside of the loop since it is applicable to all access.

It also takes this chance to break early on the "off < moff" case.
