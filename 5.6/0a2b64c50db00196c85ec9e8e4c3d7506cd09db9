kvm: mmu: Replace unsigned with unsigned int for PTE access

There are several functions which pass an access permission mask for
SPTEs as an unsigned. This works, but checkpatch complains about it.
Switch the occurrences of unsigned to unsigned int to satisfy checkpatch.

No functional change expected.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests on an Intel Haswell machine. This
commit introduced no new failures.
