drm/bridge: Add a drm_bridge_state object

One of the last remaining objects to not have its atomic state.

This is being motivated by our attempt to support runtime bus-format
negotiation between elements of the bridge chain.
This patch just paves the road for such a feature by adding a new
drm_bridge_state object inheriting from drm_private_obj so we can
re-use some of the existing state initialization/tracking logic.
