powerpc/eeh_sysfs: Make clearing EEH_DEV_SYSFS saner

The eeh_sysfs_remove_device() function is supposed to clear the
EEH_DEV_SYSFS flag since it indicates the EEH sysfs entries have been added
for a pci_dev.

When the sysfs files are removed eeh_remove_device() the eeh_dev and the
pci_dev have already been de-associated. This then causes the
pci_dev_to_eeh_dev() call in eeh_sysfs_remove_device() to return NULL so
the flag can't be cleared from the still-live eeh_dev. This problem is
worked around in the caller by clearing the flag manually. However, this
behaviour doesn't make a whole lot of sense, so this patch fixes it by:

a) Re-ordering eeh_remove_device() so that eeh_sysfs_remove_device() is
   called before de-associating the pci_dev and eeh_dev.

b) Making eeh_sysfs_remove_device() emit a warning if there's no
   corresponding eeh_dev for a pci_dev. The paths where the sysfs
   files are only reachable if EEH was setup for the device
   for the device in the first place so hitting this warning
   indicates a programming error.
