usb: typec: Give the mux drivers all the details regarding the port state

Passing all the details that the alternate mode drivers
provide to the mux drivers during mode changes.

The mux drivers will in practice need to be able to make
decisions on their own. It is not enough that they get only
the requested port state. With the Thunderbolt 3 alternate
mode for example the mux driver will need to consider also
the capabilities of the cable before configuring the mux.
