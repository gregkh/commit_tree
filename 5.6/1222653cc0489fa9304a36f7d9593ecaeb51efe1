selftests/bpf: Build urandom_read with LDFLAGS and LDLIBS

During cross-compilation, it was discovered that LDFLAGS and
LDLIBS were not being used while building binaries, leading
to defaults which were not necessarily correct.

OpenEmbedded reported this kind of problem:

  ERROR: QA Issue: No GNU_HASH in the ELF binary [...], didn't pass LDFLAGS?
