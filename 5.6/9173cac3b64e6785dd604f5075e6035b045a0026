libbpf: Support .text sub-calls relocations

The LLVM patch https://reviews.llvm.org/D72197 makes LLVM emit function call
relocations within the same section. This includes a default .text section,
which contains any BPF sub-programs. This wasn't the case before and so libbpf
was able to get a way with slightly simpler handling of subprogram call
relocations.

This patch adds support for .text section relocations. It needs to ensure
correct order of relocations, so does two passes:
- first, relocate .text instructions, if there are any relocations in it;
- then process all the other programs and copy over patched .text instructions
for all sub-program calls.

v1->v2:
- break early once .text program is processed.
