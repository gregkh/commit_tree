KVM: x86: Free wbinvd_dirty_mask if vCPU creation fails

Free the vCPU's wbinvd_dirty_mask if vCPU creation fails after
kvm_arch_vcpu_init(), e.g. when installing the vCPU's file descriptor.
Do the freeing by calling kvm_arch_vcpu_free() instead of open coding
the freeing.  This adds a likely superfluous, but ultimately harmless,
call to kvmclock_reset(), which only clears vcpu->arch.pv_time_enabled.
Using kvm_arch_vcpu_free() allows for additional cleanup in the future.
