drm: of: Fix linking when CONFIG_OF is not set

The new helper drm_of_lvds_get_dual_link_pixel_order() introduced in
commit 6529007522de has a fallback stub when CONFIG_OF is not set, but
the stub is declared in drm_of.h without a static inline. This causes
multiple definitions of the function to be linked when the CONFIG_OF
option isn't set. Fix it by making the stub static inline.
