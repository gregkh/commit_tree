ASoC: SOF: move arch_ops under ops

The current structures are not well designed. We include Xtensa
information from the ACPI and PCI levels, but at the Kconfig/module
level everything Xtensa related is included at the sof/intel level.

Move the arch_ops under ops so that Xtensa is hidden in the DSP ops,
with a structure that follows the Kconfig/module partition.
