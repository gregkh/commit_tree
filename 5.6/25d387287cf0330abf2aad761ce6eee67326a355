perf/x86/amd: Add missing L2 misses event spec to AMD Family 17h's event map

Commit 3fe3331bb285 ("perf/x86/amd: Add event map for AMD Family 17h"),
claimed L2 misses were unsupported, due to them not being found in its
referenced documentation, whose link has now moved [1].

That old documentation listed PMCx064 unit mask bit 3 as:

    "LsRdBlkC: LS Read Block C S L X Change to X Miss."

and bit 0 as:

    "IcFillMiss: IC Fill Miss"

We now have new public documentation [2] with improved descriptions, that
clearly indicate what events those unit mask bits represent:

Bit 3 now clearly states:

    "LsRdBlkC: Data Cache Req Miss in L2 (all types)"

and bit 0 is:

    "IcFillMiss: Instruction Cache Req Miss in L2."

So we can now add support for L2 misses in perf's genericised events as
PMCx064 with both the above unit masks.
