watchdog/softlockup: Remove obsolete check of last reported task

commit 9cf57731b63e ("watchdog/softlockup: Replace "watchdog/%u" threads
 with cpu_stop_work") ensures that the watchdog is reliably touched during
a task switch.

As a result the check for an unnoticed task switch is not longer needed.

Remove the relevant code, which effectively reverts commit b1a8de1f5343
("softlockup: make detector be aware of task switch of processes hogging
cpu")
