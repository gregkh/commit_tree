irqchip/gic-v4.1: VPE table (aka GICR_VPROPBASER) allocation

GICv4.1 defines a new VPE table that is potentially shared between
both the ITSs and the redistributors, following complicated affinity
rules.

To make things more confusing, the programming of this table at
the redistributor level is reusing the GICv4.0 GICR_VPROPBASER register
for something completely different.

The code flow is somewhat complexified by the need to respect the
affinities required by the HW, meaning that tables can either be
inherited from a previously discovered ITS or redistributor.
