powerpc/powernv/ioda: set up PE on opencapi device when enabling

The PE for an opencapi device was set as part of a late PHB fixup
operation, when creating the PHB. To use the PCI hotplug framework,
this is not going to work, as the PHB stays the same, it's only the
devices underneath which are updated. For regular PCI devices, it is
done as part of the reconfiguration of the bridge, but for opencapi
PHBs, we don't have an intermediate bridge. So let's define the PE
when the device is enabled. PEs are meaningless for opencapi, the NPU
doesn't define them and opal is not doing anything with them.
