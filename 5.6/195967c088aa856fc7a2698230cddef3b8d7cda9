MAINTAINERS: rectify the INTEL IADX DRIVER entry

Commit bfe1d56091c1 ("dmaengine: idxd: Init and probe for Intel data
accelerators") added the INTEL IADX DRIVER entry in MAINTAINERS, which
mentions include/linux/idxd.h as file entry. However, this header file was
not added in this commit, nor in any later one.

Hence, since then, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test complains:

  warning: no file matches F: include/linux/idxd.h

Drop the file entry to the non-existing file in INTEL IADX DRIVER now.
