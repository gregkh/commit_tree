regulator: bd718x7: Simplify the code by removing struct bd718xx_pmic_inits

Nowdays ROHM_CHIP_TYPE_AMOUNT includes not only BD71837/BD71847 but also
BD70528/BD71828 which are not supported by this driver. So it seems not
necessay to have pmic_regulators[ROHM_CHIP_TYPE_AMOUNT] as mapping table.
Simplify the code by removing struct bd718xx_pmic_inits and
pmic_regulators[ROHM_CHIP_TYPE_AMOUNT].
