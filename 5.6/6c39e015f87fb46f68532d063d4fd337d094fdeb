devlink: convert driver-specific files to reStructuredText

Several drivers document what parameters they support in
a devlink-params-*.txt file. This file is supposed to contain both the
list of generic parameters implemented by the driver, as well as a list
of driver-specific parameters and their descriptions.

It would also be good if the driver documentation included other
driver-specific implementations, such as info versions, devlink
regions, and so forth.

Convert all of these documentation files to reStructuredText, and rename
them to just the driver name. Future changes will include other
driver-specific implementations. Each file will contain a table for the
generic parameters implemented, as well as a separate table for the
driver-specific parameters.

Future sections such as for devlink info versions will be added to these
files. This avoids creating additional devlink-<feature>-<driver> files
for each devlink feature, reducing clutter in the documentation folder.
