tracing: Add trace_get/put_event_file()

Add a function to get an event file and prevent it from going away on
module or instance removal.

trace_get_event_file() will find an event file in a given instance (if
instance is NULL, it assumes the top trace array) and return it,
pinning the instance's trace array as well as the event's module, if
applicable, so they won't go away while in use.

trace_put_event_file() does the matching release.
