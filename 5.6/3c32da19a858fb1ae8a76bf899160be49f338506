unix: Show number of pending scm files of receive queue in fdinfo

Unix sockets like a block box. You never know what is stored there:
there may be a file descriptor holding a mount or a block device,
or there may be whole universes with namespaces, sockets with receive
queues full of sockets etc.

The patch adds a little debug and accounts number of files (not recursive),
which is in receive queue of a unix socket. Sometimes this is useful
to determine, that socket should be investigated or which task should
be killed to put reference counter on a resourse.

v2: Pass correct argument to lockdep
