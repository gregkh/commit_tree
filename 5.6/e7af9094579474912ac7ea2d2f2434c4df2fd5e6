drm/i915: Add helpers to select correct ccs/aux planes

Using helpers instead of open coding this to select a CCS plane for a
main plane makes the code cleaner and less error-prone when the location
of CCS plane can be different based on the format (packed vs. YUV
semiplanar). The same applies to selecting an AUX plane which can be a
UV plane (for an uncompressed YUV semiplanar format), or a CCS plane.
