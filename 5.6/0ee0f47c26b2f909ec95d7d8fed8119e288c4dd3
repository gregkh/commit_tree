ipv6: Notify multipath route if should be offloaded

In a similar fashion to previous patches, only notify the new multipath
route if it is the first route in the node or if it was appended to such
route.

The type of the notification (replace vs. append) is determined based on
the number of routes added ('nhn') and the number of sibling routes. If
the two do not match, then an append notification should be sent.
