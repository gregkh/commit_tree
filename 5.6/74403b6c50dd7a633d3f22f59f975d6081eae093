tracing: Remove check_arg() callbacks from dynevent args

It's kind of strange to have check_arg() callbacks as part of the arg
objects themselves; it makes more sense to just pass these in when the
args are added instead.

Remove the check_arg() callbacks from those objects which also means
removing the check_arg() args from the init functions, adding them to
the add functions and fixing up existing callers.
