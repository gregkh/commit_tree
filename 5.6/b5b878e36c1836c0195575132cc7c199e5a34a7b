iwlwifi: mvm: fix TDLS discovery with the new firmware API

I changed the API for asking for a session protection but
I omitted the TDLS flows. Fix that now.
Note that for the TDLS flow, we need to block until the
session protection actually starts, so add this option
to iwl_mvm_schedule_session_protection.
This patch fixes a firmware assert in the TDLS flow since
the old TIME_EVENT_CMD is not supported anymore by newer
firwmare versions.
