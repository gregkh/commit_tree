net: bcmgenet: Clear ID_MODE_DIS in EXT_RGMII_OOB_CTRL when not needed

Outdated Raspberry Pi 4 firmware might configure the external PHY as
rgmii although the kernel currently sets it as rgmii-rxid. This makes
connections unreliable as ID_MODE_DIS is left enabled. To avoid this,
explicitly clear that bit whenever we don't need it.
