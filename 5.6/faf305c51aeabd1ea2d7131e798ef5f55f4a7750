iommu/qcom: Fix bogus detach logic

Currently, the implementation of qcom_iommu_domain_free() is guaranteed
to do one of two things: WARN() and leak everything, or dereference NULL
and crash. That alone is terrible, but in fact the whole idea of trying
to track the liveness of a domain via the qcom_domain->iommu pointer as
a sanity check is full of fundamentally flawed assumptions. Make things
robust and actually functional by not trying to be quite so clever.
