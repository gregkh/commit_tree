drm/bridge: lvds-codec: Add "lvds-decoder" support

Add support for transparent LVDS decoders by adding a new
compatible string ("lvds-decoder") to the driver.
This patch also adds member connector_type to struct lvds_codec,
and that's because LVDS decoders have a different connector type
from LVDS encoders. We fill this new member up with the data
matching the compatible string.
