rcu: Avoid tick_dep_set_cpu() misordering

In the current code, rcu_nmi_enter_common() might decide to turn on
the tick using tick_dep_set_cpu(), but be delayed just before doing so.
Then the grace-period kthread might notice that the CPU in question had
in fact gone through a quiescent state, thus turning off the tick using
tick_dep_clear_cpu().  The later invocation of tick_dep_set_cpu() would
then incorrectly leave the tick on.

This commit therefore enlists the aid of the leaf rcu_node structure's
->lock to ensure that decisions to enable or disable the tick are
carried out before they can be reversed.
