tools/bpf: Add runqslower tool to tools/bpf

Convert one of BCC tools (runqslower [0]) to BPF CO-RE + libbpf. It matches
its BCC-based counterpart 1-to-1, supporting all the same parameters and
functionality.

runqslower tool utilizes BPF skeleton, auto-generated from BPF object file,
as well as memory-mapped interface to global (read-only, in this case) data.
Its Makefile also ensures auto-generation of "relocatable" vmlinux.h, which is
necessary for BTF-typed raw tracepoints with direct memory access.
