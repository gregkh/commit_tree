watchdog: da9062: do not ping the hw during stop()

The da9062 hw has a minimum ping cool down phase of at least 200ms. The
driver takes that into account by setting the min_hw_heartbeat_ms to
300ms and the core guarantees that the hw limit is observed for the
ping() calls. But the core can't guarantee the required minimum ping
cool down phase if a stop() command is send immediately after the ping()
command. So it is not allowed to ping the watchdog within the stop()
command as the driver does. Remove the ping can be done without doubts
because the watchdog gets disabled anyway and a (re)start resets the
watchdog counter too.
