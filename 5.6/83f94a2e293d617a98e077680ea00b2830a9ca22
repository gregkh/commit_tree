ASoC: soc-core: add snd_soc_close_delayed_work()

We need to setup rtd->close_delayed_work_func.
It will be set at snd_soc_dai_compress_new() or soc_new_pcm().
But these setups close_delayed_work() which is same name /
same implemantaion, but different local code.
To reduce duplicate code, this patch moves it as
snd_soc_close_delayed_work() and share same code.
