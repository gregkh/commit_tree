kvm: x86: Add support for dynamic APICv activation

Certain runtime conditions require APICv to be temporary deactivated
during runtime.  The current implementation only support run-time
deactivation of APICv when Hyper-V SynIC is enabled, which is not
temporary.

In addition, for AMD, when APICv is (de)activated at runtime,
all vcpus in the VM have to operate in the same mode.  Thus the
requesting vcpu must notify the others.

So, introduce the following:
 * A new KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE request bit
 * Interfaces to request all vcpus to update APICv status
 * A new interface to update APICV-related parameters for each vcpu
