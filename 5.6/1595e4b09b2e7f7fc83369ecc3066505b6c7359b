cpuidle: psci: Simplify OF parsing of CPU idle state nodes

Iterating through the idle state nodes in DT, to find out the number of
states that needs to be allocated is unnecessary, as it has already been
done from dt_init_idle_driver(). Therefore, drop the iteration and use the
number we already have at hand.
