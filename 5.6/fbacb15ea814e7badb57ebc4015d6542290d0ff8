drm/i915/dsc: add basic hardware state readout support

Add basic hardware state readout for DSC, and check the most relevant
details in the state checker.

v2:
- check for DSC power before reading its state
- check if source supports DSC at all

As a side effect, this should also get the power domains for the enabled
DSC on takeover, and subsequently disable DSC if it's not needed.
