KVM: Clean up __kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init() and its callers

Barret reported a (technically benign) bug where nr_pages_avail can be
accessed without being initialized if gfn_to_hva_many() fails.

  virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:2193:13: warning: 'nr_pages_avail' may be
  used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Rather than simply squashing the warning by initializing nr_pages_avail,
fix the underlying issues by reworking __kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init() to
return immediately instead of continuing on.  Now that all callers check
the result and/or bail immediately on a bad hva, there's no need to
explicitly nullify the memslot on error.
