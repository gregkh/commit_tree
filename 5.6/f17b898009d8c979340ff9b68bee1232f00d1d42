drm/i915/gem: Drop local vma->vm_file reference

We use the global device inode, shared amongst all files, and not the
user's device filp to provide the backing storage for the mmap. The
vma->vm_file provides a redundant reference that breaks existing
expected behaviour that closing the user's device fd will release the
resources bound to it, if a mmap persists. (Even without the
vma->vm_file, the mmap will persist past the user's fd as the storage is
bound to the device, i.e. our reference is on the object not file.)
