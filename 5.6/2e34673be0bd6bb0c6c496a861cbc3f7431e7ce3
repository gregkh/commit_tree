PCI/ATS: Use PF PASID for VFs

Per PCIe r5.0, sec 9.3.7.14, if a PF implements the PASID Capability, the
PF PASID configuration is shared by its VFs, and VFs must not implement
their own PASID Capability.  But commit 751035b8dc06 ("PCI/ATS: Cache PASID
Capability offset") changed pci_max_pasids() and pci_pasid_features() to
use the PASID Capability of the VF device instead of the associated PF
device.  This leads to IOMMU bind failures when pci_max_pasids() and
pci_pasid_features() are called for VFs.

In pci_max_pasids() and pci_pasid_features(), always use the PF PASID
Capability.
