devtmpfs: fix theoretical stale pointer deref in devtmpfsd()

After complete(&setup_done), devtmpfs_init proceeds and may actually
return, invalidating the *err pointer, before devtmpfsd() proceeds to
reading back *err.

This is of course completely theoretical since the error conditions
never trigger in practice, and even if they did, nobody cares about
the exit value from a kernel thread, so it doesn't matter if we happen
to read back some garbage from some other stack frame. Still, this
isn't a pattern that should be copy-pasted, so fix it.
