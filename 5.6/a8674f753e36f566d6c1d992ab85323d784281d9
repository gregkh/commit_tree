ipv4: Notify newly added route if should be offloaded

When a route is added, it should only be notified in case it is the
first route in the FIB alias list with the given {prefix, prefix length,
table ID}. Otherwise, it is not used in the data path and should not be
considered by switch drivers.

v2:
* Convert to use fib_find_alias() instead of fib_find_first_alias()
