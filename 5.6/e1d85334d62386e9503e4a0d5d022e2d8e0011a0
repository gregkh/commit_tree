io_uring: fix 1-bit bitfields to be unsigned

Make bitfields of size 1 bit be unsigned (since there is no room
for the sign bit).
This clears up the sparse warnings:

  CHECK   ../fs/io_uring.c
../fs/io_uring.c:207:50: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
../fs/io_uring.c:208:55: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
../fs/io_uring.c:209:63: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
../fs/io_uring.c:210:54: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
../fs/io_uring.c:211:57: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield

Found by sight and then verified with sparse.
