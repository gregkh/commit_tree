drm/i915/gt: Drop the timeline->mutex as we wait for retirement

As we have pinned the timeline (using tl->active_count), we can safely
drop the tl->mutex as we wait for what we believe to be the final
request on that timeline. This is useful for ensuring that we do not
block the engine heartbeat by hogging the kernel_context's timeline on a
dead GPU.
