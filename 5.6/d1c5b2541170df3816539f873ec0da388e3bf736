dt-bindings: net: bluetooth: Add compatible string for WCN3991

Commit 7d250a062f75 ("Bluetooth: hci_qca: Add support for Qualcomm
Bluetooth SoC WCN3991") added the compatible string 'qcom,wcn3991-bt'
to the Qualcomm Bluetooth driver, however the string is not listed
in the binding. Add the 'qcom,wcn3991-bt' to the supported compatible
strings.
