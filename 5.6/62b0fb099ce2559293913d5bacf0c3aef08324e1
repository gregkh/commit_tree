mlxsw: spectrum: Disable SIP_CLASS_E check in hardware pipeline

The check drops packets if they need to be routed and their source IP is
from class E, i.e., belongs to 240.0.0.0/4 address range, but different
from 255.255.255.255.

Disable the check since the kernel forwards such packets and does not
drop them.
