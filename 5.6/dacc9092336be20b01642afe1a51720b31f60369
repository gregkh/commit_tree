x86/sysfb: Fix check for bad VRAM size

When checking whether the reported lfb_size makes sense, the height
* stride result is page-aligned before seeing whether it exceeds the
reported size.

This doesn't work if height * stride is not an exact number of pages.
For example, as reported in the kernel bugzilla below, an 800x600x32 EFI
framebuffer gets skipped because of this.

Move the PAGE_ALIGN to after the check vs size.
