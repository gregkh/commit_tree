serial_core: Remove unused member in uart_port

It should remove the align-padding before @name.

[yes, there's a "hole" in the structure now, but that's fine, no one
cares.  If they do care, the whole thing should be restructured using
pahole to find a better ordering.  Removing this field is good as some
drivers have been known to abuse it for other things when they shouldn't
have been doing that. -- gregkh]
