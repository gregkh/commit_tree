KVM: VMX: Use VMX feature flag to query BIOS enabling

Replace KVM's manual checks on IA32_FEAT_CTL with a query on the boot
CPU's MSR_IA32_FEAT_CTL and VMX feature flags.  The MSR_IA32_FEAT_CTL
indicates that IA32_FEAT_CTL has been configured and that dependent
features are accurately reflected in cpufeatures, e.g. the VMX flag is
now cleared during boot if VMX isn't fully enabled via IA32_FEAT_CTL,
including the case where the MSR isn't supported.
