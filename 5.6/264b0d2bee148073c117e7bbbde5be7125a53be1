percpu: Separate decrypted varaibles anytime encryption can be enabled

CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION may not be enabled for memory encrypted guests.  If
disabled, decrypted per-CPU variables may end up sharing the same page
with variables that should be left encrypted.

Always separate per-CPU variables that should be decrypted into their own
page anytime memory encryption can be enabled in the guest rather than
rely on any other config option that may not be enabled.
