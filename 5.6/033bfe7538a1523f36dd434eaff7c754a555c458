drm/vc4: dsi: Fix bridge chain handling

Commit 05193dc38197 ("drm/bridge: Make the bridge chain a double-linked
list") patched the bridge chain logic to use a double-linked list instead
of a single-linked list. This change induced changes to the VC4 driver
which was manually resetting the encoder->bridge element to NULL to
control the enable/disable sequence of the bridge chain. During this
conversion, 2 bugs were introduced:

1/ list_splice() was used to move chain elements to our own internal
   chain, but list_splice() does not reset the source list to an empty
   state, leading to unexpected bridge hook calls when
   drm_bridge_chain_xxx() helpers were called by the core. Replacing
   those list_splice() calls by list_splice_init() ones fixes this
   problem.

2/ drm_bridge_chain_xxx() helpers operate on the
   bridge->encoder->bridge_chain list, which is now empty. When the
   helper uses list_for_each_entry_reverse() we end up with no operation
   done which is not what we want. But that's even worse when the helper
   uses list_for_each_entry_from(), because in that case we end up in
   an infinite loop searching for the list head element which is no
   longer encoder->bridge_chain but vc4_dsi->bridge_chain. To address
   that problem we stop using the bridge chain helpers and call the
   hooks directly.
