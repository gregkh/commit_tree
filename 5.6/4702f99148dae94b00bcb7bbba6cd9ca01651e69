ASoC: soc-core: soc_set_name_prefix(): tidyup loop condition

Current soc_set_name_prefix() for loop is checking both codec_conf
pointer and its number

	for (...; i < card->num_configs && card->codec_conf; ...)

But, if card->num_configs exists but card->codec_conf was NULL,
it is just bug.
This patch cleanups for loop condition.
