tcp: coalesce/collapse must respect MPTCP extensions

Coalesce and collapse of packets carrying MPTCP extensions is allowed
when the newer packet has no extension or the extensions carried by both
packets are equal.

This allows merging of TSO packet trains and even cross-TSO packets, and
does not require any additional action when moving data into existing
SKBs.

v3 -> v4:
 - allow collapsing, under mptcp_skb_can_collapse() constraint

v5 -> v6:
 - clarify MPTCP skb extensions must always be cleared at allocation
   time
