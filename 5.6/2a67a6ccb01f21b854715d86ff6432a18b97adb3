bpf, btf: Always output invariant hit in pahole DWARF to BTF transform

When trying to compile with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF enabled, I got this
error:

    % make -s
    Failed to generate BTF for vmlinux
    Try to disable CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF
    make[3]: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

Compiling again without -s shows the true error (that pahole is
missing), but since this is fatal, we should show the error
unconditionally on stderr as well, not silence it using the `info`
function. With this patch:

    % make -s
    BTF: .tmp_vmlinux.btf: pahole (pahole) is not available
    Failed to generate BTF for vmlinux
    Try to disable CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF
    make[3]: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
