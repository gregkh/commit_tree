bootconfig: Add Extra Boot Config support

Extra Boot Config (XBC) allows admin to pass a tree-structured
boot configuration file when boot up the kernel. This extends
the kernel command line in an efficient way.

Boot config will contain some key-value commands, e.g.

key.word = value1
another.key.word = value2

It can fold same keys with braces, also you can write array
data. For example,

key {
   word1 {
      setting1 = data
      setting2
   }
   word2.array = "val1", "val2"
}

User can access these key-value pair and tree structure via
SKC APIs.
