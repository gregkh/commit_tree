sched.h: Annotate sighand_struct with __rcu

This patch fixes the following sparse errors by annotating the
sighand_struct with __rcu

kernel/fork.c:1511:9: error: incompatible types in comparison expression
kernel/exit.c:100:19: error: incompatible types in comparison expression
kernel/signal.c:1370:27: error: incompatible types in comparison expression

This fix introduces the following sparse error in signal.c due to
checking the sighand pointer without rcu primitives:

kernel/signal.c:1386:21: error: incompatible types in comparison expression

This new sparse error is also fixed in this patch.
