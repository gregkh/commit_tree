media: i2c: mt9v032: fix enum mbus codes and frame sizes

This driver supports both the mt9v032 (color) and the mt9v022 (mono)
sensors. Depending on which sensor is used, the format from the sensor is
different. The format.code inside the dev struct holds this information.
The enum mbus and enum frame sizes need to take into account both type of
sensors, not just the color one. To solve this, use the format.code in
these functions instead of the hardcoded bayer color format (which is only
used for mt9v032).
