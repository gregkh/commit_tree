efi/x86: Don't panic or BUG() on non-critical error conditions

The logic in __efi_enter_virtual_mode() does a number of steps in
sequence, all of which may fail in one way or the other. In most
cases, we simply print an error and disable EFI runtime services
support, but in some cases, we BUG() or panic() and bring down the
system when encountering conditions that we could easily handle in
the same way.

While at it, replace a pointless page-to-virt-phys conversion with
one that goes straight from struct page to physical.
