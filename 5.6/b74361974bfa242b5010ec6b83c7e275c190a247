drm/amd/display: remove redundant variable status

Variable status is redundant, it is being initialized with a value
that is over-written later and this is being returned immediately
after the assignment.  Clean up the code by removing status and
just returning the value returned from the call to function
dc->hwss.dmdata_status_done.
