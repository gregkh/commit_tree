usb: xhci: apply XHCI_SUSPEND_DELAY to AMD XHCI controller 1022:145c

This controller timeouts during suspend (S3) with
[  240.521724] xhci_hcd 0000:30:00.3: WARN: xHC save state timeout
[  240.521729] xhci_hcd 0000:30:00.3: ERROR mismatched command completion event
thus preventing the system from entering S3.
Moreover it remains in an undefined state where some connected devices stop
working until a reboot.
Apply the XHCI_SUSPEND_DELAY quirk to make it suspend properly.
