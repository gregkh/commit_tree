mm/migrate.c: also overwrite error when it is bigger than zero

If we get here after successfully adding page to list, err would be 1 to
indicate the page is queued in the list.

Current code has two problems:

  * on success, 0 is not returned
  * on error, if add_page_for_migratioin() return 1, and the following err1
    from do_move_pages_to_node() is set, the err1 is not returned since err
    is 1

And these behaviors break the user interface.
