ext4: make some functions static in extents.c

Make the following functions static since they're only used in
extents.c:

	__ext4_ext_dirty()
	ext4_can_extents_be_merged()
	ext4_collapse_range()
	ext4_insert_range()

Also remove the prototype for ext4_ext_writepage_trans_blocks(), as this
function is not defined anywhere.
