ALSA: uapi: Add linux/types.h include back (but carefully)

A few uapi/sound/*.h headers have been corrected for recovering from
the compile errors with the existing user-space code (alsa-lib) by the
recent commits.  OTOH, these introduced another regression, as now
linux/types.h inclusion became mandatory for the uapi header checks.

As a compromise, this patch re-adds linux/types.h inclusions again,
but conditionally not to break other non-standard user-space stuff
again.

Fixes: d63e63d42107 ("ALSA: hdsp: Make uapi/hdsp.h compilable again")
