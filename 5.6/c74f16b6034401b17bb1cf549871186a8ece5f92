wan: ixp4xx_hss: prepare compile testing

The ixp4xx_hss driver needs the platform data definition and the
system clock rate to be compiled. Move both into a new platform_data
header file.

This is a prerequisite for compile testing, but turning on compile
testing requires further patches to isolate the SoC headers.
