perf top: Fix stdio interface input handling with glibc 2.28+

Since glibc 2.28 when running 'perf top --stdio', input handling no
longer works, but hitting any key always just prints the "Mapped keys"
help text.

To fix it, call clearerr() in the display_thread() loop to clear any EOF
sticky errors, as instructed in the glibc NEWS file
(https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=NEWS):

 * All stdio functions now treat end-of-file as a sticky condition.  If you
   read from a file until EOF, and then the file is enlarged by another
   process, you must call clearerr or another function with the same effect
   (e.g. fseek, rewind) before you can read the additional data.  This
   corrects a longstanding C99 conformance bug.  It is most likely to affect
   programs that use stdio to read interactive input from a terminal.
   (Bug #1190.)
