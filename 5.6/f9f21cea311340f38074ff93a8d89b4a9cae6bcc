genirq: Clarify that irq wake state is orthogonal to enable/disable

There's some confusion around if an irq that's disabled with disable_irq()
can still wake the system from sleep states such as "suspend to RAM".

Clarify this in the kernel documentation for irq_set_irq_wake() so that
it's clear that an irq can be disabled and still wake the system if it has
been marked for wakeup.
