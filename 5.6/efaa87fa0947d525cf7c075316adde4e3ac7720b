gpiolib: acpi: Correct comment for HP x2 10 honor_wakeup quirk

Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
quirk mechanism") added a quirk for some models of the HP x2 10 series.

There are 2 issues with the comment describing the quirk:
1) The comment claims the DMI quirk applies to all Cherry Trail based HP x2
   10 models. In the mean time I have learned that there are at least 3
   models of the HP x2 10 models:

   Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
   Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
   Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC

   And this quirk's DMI matches only match the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
   SoC, which is good because we want a slightly different quirk for the
   others. This commit updates the comment to make it clear that the quirk
   is only for the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC models.

2) The comment says that it is ok to disable wakeup on all ACPI GPIO event
   handlers, because there is only the one for the embedded-controller
   events. This is not true, there also is a handler for the special
   INT0002 device which is related to USB wakeups. We need to also disable
   wakeups on that one because the device turns of the USB-keyboard built
   into the dock when closing the lid. The XHCI controller takes a while
   to notice this, so it only notices it when already suspended, causing
   a spurious wakeup because of this. So disabling wakeup on all handlers
   is the right thing to do, but not because there only is the one handler
   for the EC events. This commit updates the comment to correctly reflect
   this.
