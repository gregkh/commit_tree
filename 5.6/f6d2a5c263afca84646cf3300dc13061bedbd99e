btrfs: tree-checker: Check leaf chunk item size

Inspired by btrfs-progs github issue #208, where chunk item in chunk
tree has invalid num_stripes (0).

Although that can already be caught by current btrfs_check_chunk_valid(),
that function doesn't really check item size as it needs to handle chunk
item in super block sys_chunk_array().

This patch will add two extra checks for chunk items in chunk tree:

- Basic chunk item size
  If the item is smaller than btrfs_chunk (which already contains one
  stripe), exit right now as reading num_stripes may even go beyond
  eb boundary.

- Item size check against num_stripes
  If item size doesn't match with calculated chunk size, then either the
  item size or the num_stripes is corrupted. Error out anyway.
