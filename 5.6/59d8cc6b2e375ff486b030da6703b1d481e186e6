rcu: Forgive slow expedited grace periods at boot time

Boot-time processing often loops in the kernel longer than one might
prefer, which can prevent expedited grace periods from completing in
a timely manner.  This in turn triggers a splat In nohz_full CPUs  One
could argue that long-looping code should be fixed, but on the other hand,
boot time is a bit special.

This commit therefore removes the splat.  Later commits will add the
splat back in, but in a way that removes false positives.
