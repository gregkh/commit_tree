ARM: dts: imx6dl-colibri-eval-v3: fix sram compatible properties

The sram-node compatible properties have mistakingly combined the
model-specific string with the generic "mtd-ram" string.

Note that neither "cy7c1019dv33-10zsxi, mtd-ram" or
"cy7c1019dv33-10zsxi" are used by any in-kernel driver and they are
not present in any binding.

The physmap driver will however bind to platform devices that specify
"mtd-ram".
