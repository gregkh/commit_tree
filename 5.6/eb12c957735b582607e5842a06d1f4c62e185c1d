drm/radeon: Inline drm_get_pci_dev

It's the last user, and more importantly, it's the last non-legacy
user of anything in drm_pci.c.

The only tricky bit is the agp initialization. But a close look shows
that radeon does not use the drm_agp midlayer (the main use of that is
drm_bufs for legacy drivers), and instead could use the agp subsystem
directly (like nouveau does already). Hence we can just pull this in
too.

A further step would be to entirely drop the use of drm_device->agp,
but feels like too much churn just for this patch.
