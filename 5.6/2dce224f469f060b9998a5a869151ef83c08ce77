netns: protect netns ID lookups with RCU

__peernet2id() can be protected by RCU as it only calls idr_for_each(),
which is RCU-safe, and never modifies the nsid table.

rtnl_net_dumpid() can also do lockless lookups. It does two nested
idr_for_each() calls on nsid tables (one direct call and one indirect
call because of rtnl_net_dumpid_one() calling __peernet2id()). The
netnsid tables are never updated. Therefore it is safe to not take the
nsid_lock and run within an RCU-critical section instead.
