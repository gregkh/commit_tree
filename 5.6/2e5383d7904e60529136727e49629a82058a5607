cgroup1: don't call release_agent when it is ""

Older (and maybe current) versions of systemd set release_agent to "" when
shutting down, but do not set notify_on_release to 0.

Since 64e90a8acb85 ("Introduce STATIC_USERMODEHELPER to mediate
call_usermodehelper()"), we filter out such calls when the user mode helper
path is "". However, when used in conjunction with an actual (i.e. non "")
STATIC_USERMODEHELPER, the path is never "", so the real usermode helper
will be called with argv[0] == "".

Let's avoid this by not invoking the release_agent when it is "".
