ext4, jbd2: ensure panic when aborting with zero errno

JBD2_REC_ERR flag used to indicate the errno has been updated when jbd2
aborted, and then __ext4_abort() and ext4_handle_error() can invoke
panic if ERRORS_PANIC is specified. But if the journal has been aborted
with zero errno, jbd2_journal_abort() didn't set this flag so we can
no longer panic. Fix this by always record the proper errno in the
journal superblock.
