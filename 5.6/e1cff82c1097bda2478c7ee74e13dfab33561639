drm/bridge: fix anx6345 compilation for v5.5

The anx6345 driver originally was copied from anx78xx.c, which has meanwhile
seen a few changes. In particular, the removal of drm_dp_link helpers and the
discontinuation to include drm_bridge.h from drm_crtc.h breaks compilation
in linux-5.5. Apply equivalents of these changes to anx6345.c.
