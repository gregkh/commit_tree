ARM: dts: imx25: consolidate properties of usbhost1 in dtsi file

The usb port represented by &usbhost1 uses an USB phy internal to the
SoC. We add the phy_type to the base dtsi so the board dts only have to
overwrite it if they use a different configuration. While at it we also
pin the usbhost port to host mode.
