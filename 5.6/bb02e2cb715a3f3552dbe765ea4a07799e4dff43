x86/cpu: Print "VMX disabled" error message iff KVM is enabled

Don't print an error message about VMX being disabled by BIOS if KVM,
the sole user of VMX, is disabled. E.g. if KVM is disabled and the MSR
is unlocked, the kernel will intentionally disable VMX when locking
feature control and then complain that "BIOS" disabled VMX.
