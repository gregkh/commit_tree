ethtool: provide link settings with LINKINFO_GET request

Implement LINKINFO_GET netlink request to get basic link settings provided
by ETHTOOL_GLINKSETTINGS and ETHTOOL_GSET ioctl commands.

This request provides settings not directly related to autonegotiation and
link mode selection: physical port, phy MDIO address, MDI(-X) status,
MDI(-X) control and transceiver.

LINKINFO_GET request can be used with NLM_F_DUMP (without device
identification) to request the information for all devices in current
network namespace providing the data.
