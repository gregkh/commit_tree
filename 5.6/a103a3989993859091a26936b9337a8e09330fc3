ALSA: control: Fix incompatible protocol error

The recent change to bump the ALSA control API protocol version from
2.0.7 to 2.1.0 caused a regression on user-space; while the user-space
expects both the major and the minor versions to be identical with the
supported numbers, we changed the minor number from 0 to 1.

For recovering from the incompatibility, this patch changes the
protocol version again to 2.0.8, which is compatible, but yet higher
than the original number 2.0.7, indicating that the protocol change.
