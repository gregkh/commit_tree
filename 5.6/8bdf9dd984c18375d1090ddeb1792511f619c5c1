RDMA/uverbs: Remove needs_kfree_rcu from uverbs_obj_type_class

After device disassociation the uapi_objects are destroyed and freed,
however it is still possible that core code can be holding a kref on the
uobject. When it finally goes to uverbs_uobject_free() via the kref_put()
it can trigger a use-after-free on the uapi_object.

Since needs_kfree_rcu is a micro optimization that only benefits file
uobjects, just get rid of it. There is no harm in using kfree_rcu even if
it isn't required, and the number of involved objects is small.
