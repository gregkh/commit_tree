drm/i915: fix uninitialized pointer reads on pointers to and from

Currently pointers to and from are not initialized and may contain
garbage values. This will cause uninitialized pointer reads in the
call to intel_frontbuffer_track and later checks to see if to and from
are null.  Fix this by ensuring to and from are initialized to NULL.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialised pointer read)"
