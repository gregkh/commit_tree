mtd: rawnand: denali_dt: error out if platform has no associated data

denali->ecc_caps is a mandatory parameter. If it were left unset,
nand_ecc_choose_conf() would end up with NULL pointer access.

So, every compatible must be associated with proper denali_dt_data.
If of_device_get_match_data() returns NULL, let it fail immediately.
