x86/mm: split vmalloc_sync_all()

Commit 3f8fd02b1bf1 ("mm/vmalloc: Sync unmappings in
__purge_vmap_area_lazy()") introduced a call to vmalloc_sync_all() in
the vunmap() code-path.  While this change was necessary to maintain
correctness on x86-32-pae kernels, it also adds additional cycles for
architectures that don't need it.

Specifically on x86-64 with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y some people reported
severe performance regressions in micro-benchmarks because it now also
calls the x86-64 implementation of vmalloc_sync_all() on vunmap().  But
the vmalloc_sync_all() implementation on x86-64 is only needed for newly
created mappings.

To avoid the unnecessary work on x86-64 and to gain the performance
back, split up vmalloc_sync_all() into two functions:

	* vmalloc_sync_mappings(), and
	* vmalloc_sync_unmappings()

Most call-sites to vmalloc_sync_all() only care about new mappings being
synchronized.  The only exception is the new call-site added in the
above mentioned commit.

Shile Zhang directed us to a report of an 80% regression in reaim
throughput.
