btrfs: drop log root for dropped roots

If we fsync on a subvolume and create a log root for that volume, and
then later delete that subvolume we'll never clean up its log root.  Fix
this by making switch_commit_roots free the log for any dropped roots we
encounter.  The extra churn is because we need a btrfs_trans_handle, not
the btrfs_transaction.
