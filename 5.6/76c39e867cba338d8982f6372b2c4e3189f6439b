ASoC: soc-core: do pinctrl_pm_select_xxx() as component

ALSA SoC need to care pinctrl_pm_select_xxx().
It is called at soc-core and soc-pcm.
soc-pcm  is controlling it for activate DAI.
soc-core is controlling it for whole system
(= suspend/resume/probe/poweroff).

If we focus to soc-core side, it need to care about BIAS level.
Then, snd_soc_suspend() only is controlling it by Component base (a).
Other functions are DAI base (b).

(a)	pinctrl_pm_select_xxx(component->dev, xxx);
(b)	pinctrl_pm_select_xxx(dai->dev, xxx);

Because of these unbalance, the code is confusable.
Here, dai->dev and component->dev are same pointer.
Thus, we can replace it component base.

One note here is that it cared DAI (= CPU/Codec) pin before this patch,
after this patch, it cares Component (= CPU/Codec/Platform) pin.
