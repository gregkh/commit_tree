drm/amdgpu/powerplay: nv1x, renior copy dcn clock settings of watermark to smu during boot up

dc to pplib interface is changed for navi1x, renoir.
display_config_changed is not called by dc anymore.
smu_write_watermarks_table is not executed for navi1x, renoir
during boot up.

solution: call smu_write_watermarks_table just after dc pass
watermark clock settings to pplib
