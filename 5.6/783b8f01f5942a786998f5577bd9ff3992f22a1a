libbpf: Don't attach perf_buffer to offline/missing CPUs

It's quite common on some systems to have more CPUs enlisted as "possible",
than there are (and could ever be) present/online CPUs. In such cases,
perf_buffer creationg will fail due to inability to create perf event on
missing CPU with error like this:

libbpf: failed to open perf buffer event on cpu #16: No such device

This patch fixes the logic of perf_buffer__new() to ignore CPUs that are
missing or currently offline. In rare cases where user explicitly listed
specific CPUs to connect to, behavior is unchanged: libbpf will try to open
perf event buffer on specified CPU(s) anyways.
