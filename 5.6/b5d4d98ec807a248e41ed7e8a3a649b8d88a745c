staging: wfx: firmware never return PS status for stations

At the beginning, firmware could send suspend_resume indication to
notify that a station wake up or sleep down. However, mac80211 already
handles power save status of stations and this behavior has been removed
from the firmware. So now, when suspend_resume indication is received,
it is always to notify that a DTIM is about to be sent.

So, it is possible to simply wfx_suspend_resume().
