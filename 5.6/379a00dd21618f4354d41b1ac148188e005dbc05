mlxsw: spectrum_dcb: Allow setting default port priority

When APP TLV selector 1 (EtherType) is used with PID of 0, the
corresponding entry specifies "default application priority [...] when
application priority is not otherwise specified."

mlxsw currently supports this type of APP entry, but uses it only as a
fallback for unspecified DSCP rules. However non-IP traffic is prioritized
according to port-default priority, not according to the DSCP-to-prio
tables, and thus it's currently not possible to prioritize such traffic
correctly.

Extend the use of the abovementioned APP entry to also set default port
priority.
