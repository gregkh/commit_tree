net: dsa: mt7530: Change the LINK bit to reflect the link status

Andrew reported:

After a number of network port link up/down changes, sometimes the switch
port gets stuck in a state where it thinks it is still transmitting packets
but the cpu port is not actually transmitting anymore. In this state you
will see a message on the console
"mtk_soc_eth 1e100000.ethernet eth0: transmit timed out" and the Tx counter
in ifconfig will be incrementing on virtual port, but not incrementing on
cpu port.

The issue is that MAC TX/RX status has no impact on the link status or
queue manager of the switch. So the queue manager just queues up packets
of a disabled port and sends out pause frames when the queue is full.

Change the LINK bit to reflect the link status.
