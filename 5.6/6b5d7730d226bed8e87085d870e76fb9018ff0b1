drm/amd/display: Add wait for flip not pending on pipe unlock

[Why]
Lack of proper timing caused intermittent underflow on unplug external DP.
A previous fix was invalid and caused S0i3 regression, so had to be reverted.

[How]
When unlocking pipe, wait for no pipes to have flip pending before unlocking.
