KVM: x86/mmu: Apply max PA check for MMIO sptes to 32-bit KVM

Remove the bogus 64-bit only condition from the check that disables MMIO
spte optimization when the system supports the max PA, i.e. doesn't have
any reserved PA bits.  32-bit KVM always uses PAE paging for the shadow
MMU, and per Intel's SDM:

  PAE paging translates 32-bit linear addresses to 52-bit physical
  addresses.

The kernel's restrictions on max physical addresses are limits on how
much memory the kernel can reasonably use, not what physical addresses
are supported by hardware.
