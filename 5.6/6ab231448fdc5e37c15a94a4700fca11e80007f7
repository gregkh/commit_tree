io_uring: cancel pending async work if task exits

Normally we cancel all work we track, but for untracked work we could
leave the async worker behind until that work completes. This is totally
fine, but does leave resources pending after the task is gone until that
work completes.

Cancel work that this task queued up when it goes away.
