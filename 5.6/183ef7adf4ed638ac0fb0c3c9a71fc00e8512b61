x86/boot: Simplify calculation of output address

Condense the calculation of decompressed kernel start a little.

Committer notes:

before:

ebp = ebx - (init_size - _end)

after:

eax = (ebx + _end) - init_size

where in both ebx contains the temporary address the kernel is moved to
for in-place decompression.

The before and after difference in register state is %eax and %ebp
but that is immaterial because the compressed image is not built with
-mregparm, i.e., all arguments of the following extract_kernel() call
are passed on the stack.
