drm/i915: Perform manual conversions for plane uapi/hw split, v2.

get_crtc_from_states() is called before plane_state is copied to uapi,
so use the uapi state there.

intel_legacy_cursor_update() could probably get away with looking at
the hw state, but for clarity always look at the uapi state.

Changes since v1:
- Convert entirety of intel_legacy_cursor_update (Ville).
