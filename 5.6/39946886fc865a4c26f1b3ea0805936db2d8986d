cifs: potential unintitliazed error code in cifs_getattr()

Smatch complains that "rc" could be uninitialized.

    fs/cifs/inode.c:2206 cifs_getattr() error: uninitialized symbol 'rc'.

Changing it to "return 0;" improves readability as well.

Fixes: cc1baf98c8f6 ("cifs: do not ignore the SYNC flags in getattr")
