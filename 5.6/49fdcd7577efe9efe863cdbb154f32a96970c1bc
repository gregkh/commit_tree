firmware: psci: Export functions to manage the OSI mode

To allow subsequent changes to implement support for OSI mode through the
cpuidle-psci driver, export the existing psci_has_osi_support(). Export
also a new function, psci_set_osi_mode(), that allows its caller to enable
the OS-initiated CPU-suspend mode in the PSCI FW.

To deal with backwards compatibility for a kernel started through a kexec
call, default to set the CPU-suspend mode to the Platform Coordinated mode
during boot.
