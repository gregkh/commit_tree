io_uring: add support for IORING_OP_CLOSE

This works just like close(2), unsurprisingly. We remove the file
descriptor and post the completion inline, then offload the actual
(potential) last file put to async context.

Mark the async part of this work as uncancellable, as we really must
guarantee that the latter part of the close is run.
