ASoC: codecs: add wsa881x amplifier support

This patch adds support to WSA8810/WSA8815 Class-D Smart Speaker
Amplifier. This Amplifier is primarily interfaced with SoundWire.
One WSA is used for mono speaker configuration and second one
would give stereo setup.

This patch is tested on SDM845 based DragonBoard DB845c and
Lenovo YOGA C630 Laptop based on SDM850 with WSA8815
speaker amplifiers.
