iio: adc: ltc2497: split protocol independent part in a separate module

This allows to share most of this driver for the ltc2496 driver added in
the next commit that is an SPI variant of the ltc2497. Initially I named
the generic part ltc249x, but wild card names are frowned upon, so the
generic part is called ltc2497-core even though it's not obvious that
this is then to be reused for the ltc2496 driver.
