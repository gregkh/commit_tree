usb: dwc2: Fix NULL qh in dwc2_queue_transaction

When a usb device disconnects in a certain way, dwc2_queue_transaction
still gets called after dwc2_hcd_cleanup_channels.

dwc2_hcd_cleanup_channels does "channel->qh = NULL;" but
dwc2_queue_transaction still wants to dereference qh.
This adds a check for a null qh.
