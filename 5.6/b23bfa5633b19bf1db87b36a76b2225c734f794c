bpf, xdp: Remove no longer required rcu_read_{un}lock()

Now that we depend on rcu_call() and synchronize_rcu() to also wait
for preempt_disabled region to complete the rcu read critical section
in __dev_map_flush() is no longer required. Except in a few special
cases in drivers that need it for other reasons.

These originally ensured the map reference was safe while a map was
also being free'd. And additionally that bpf program updates via
ndo_bpf did not happen while flush updates were in flight. But flush
by new rules can only be called from preempt-disabled NAPI context.
The synchronize_rcu from the map free path and the rcu_call from the
delete path will ensure the reference there is safe. So lets remove
the rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock pair to avoid any confusion
around how this is being protected.

If the rcu_read_lock was required it would mean errors in the above
logic and the original patch would also be wrong.

Now that we have done above we put the rcu_read_lock in the driver
code where it is needed in a driver dependent way. I think this
helps readability of the code so we know where and why we are
taking read locks. Most drivers will not need rcu_read_locks here
and further XDP drivers already have rcu_read_locks in their code
paths for reading xdp programs on RX side so this makes it symmetric
where we don't have half of rcu critical sections define in driver
and the other half in devmap.
