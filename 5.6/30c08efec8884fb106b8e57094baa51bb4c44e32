random: make /dev/random be almost like /dev/urandom

This patch changes the read semantics of /dev/random to be the same
as /dev/urandom except that reads will block until the CRNG is
ready.

None of the cleanups that this enables have been done yet.  As a
result, this gives a warning about an unused function.
