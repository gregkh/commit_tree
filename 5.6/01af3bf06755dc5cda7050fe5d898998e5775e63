libbpf: Expose BPF program's function name

Add APIs to get BPF program function name, as opposed to bpf_program__title(),
which returns BPF program function's section name. Function name has a benefit
of being a valid C identifier and uniquely identifies a specific BPF program,
while section name can be duplicated across multiple independent BPF programs.

Add also bpf_object__find_program_by_name(), similar to
bpf_object__find_program_by_title(), to facilitate looking up BPF programs by
their C function names.

Convert one of selftests to new API for look up.
