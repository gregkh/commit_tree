ALSA: usb-audio: fix Corsair Virtuoso mixer label collision

The Corsair Virtuoso RGB Wireless is a USB headset with a mic and a
sidetone feature. Label its mixer appropriately instead of all
"Headset", so that applications such as Pulseaudio don't just move
the sidetone control when they intend the main Headset control.
