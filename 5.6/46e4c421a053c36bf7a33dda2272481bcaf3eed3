net/packet: tpacket_rcv: do not increment ring index on drop

In one error case, tpacket_rcv drops packets after incrementing the
ring producer index.

If this happens, it does not update tp_status to TP_STATUS_USER and
thus the reader is stalled for an iteration of the ring, causing out
of order arrival.

The only such error path is when virtio_net_hdr_from_skb fails due
to encountering an unknown GSO type.
