powerpc/6xx: Fix power_save_ppc32_restore() with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK

power_save_ppc32_restore() is called during exception entry, before
re-enabling the MMU. It substracts KERNELBASE from the address
of nap_save_msscr0 to access it.

With CONFIG_VMAP_STACK enabled, data MMU translation has already been
re-enabled, so power_save_ppc32_restore() has to access
nap_save_msscr0 by its virtual address.
