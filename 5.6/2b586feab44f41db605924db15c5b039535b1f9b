thermal/drivers/Kconfig: Convert the CPU cooling device to a choice

The next changes will add a new way to cool down a CPU by injecting
idle cycles. With the current configuration, a CPU cooling device is
the cpufreq cooling device. As we want to add a new CPU cooling
device, let's convert the CPU cooling to a choice giving a list of CPU
cooling devices. At this point, there is obviously only one CPU
cooling device.

There is no functional changes.
