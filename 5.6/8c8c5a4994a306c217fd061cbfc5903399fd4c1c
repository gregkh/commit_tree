dma-contiguous: CMA: give precedence to cmdline

Although the device tree might contain a reserved-memory DT node
dedicated as the default CMA pool, users might want to change CMA's
parameters using the kernel command line for debugging purposes and
whatnot. Honor this by bypassing the reserved memory CMA setup, which
will ultimately end up freeing the memblock and allow the command line
CMA configuration routine to run.
