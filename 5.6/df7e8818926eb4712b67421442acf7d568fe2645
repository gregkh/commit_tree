KVM: SVM: relax conditions for allowing MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL accesses

Userspace that does not know about the AMD_IBRS bit might still
allow the guest to protect itself with MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL using
the Intel SPEC_CTRL bit.  However, svm.c disallows this and will
cause a #GP in the guest when writing to the MSR.  Fix this by
loosening the test and allowing the Intel CPUID bit, and in fact
allow the AMD_STIBP bit as well since it allows writing to
MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL too.
