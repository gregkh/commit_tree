scsi: ufs: Do not clear the DL layer timers

During power mode change, PACP_PWR_Req frame sends PAPowerModeUserData
parameters (and they are considered valid by device if Flags[4] -
UserDataValid bit is set in the same frame).  Currently we don't set these
PAPowerModeUserData parameters and hardware always sets UserDataValid bit
which would clear all the DL layer timeout values of the peer device after
the power mode change.

This change sets the PAPowerModeUserData[0..5] to UniPro specification
recommended default values, in addition we are also setting the relevant
DME_LOCAL_* timer attributes as required by UFS HCI specification.
