dm integrity: use dm_bio_record and dm_bio_restore

In cases where dec_in_flight() has to requeue the integrity_bio_wait
work to transfer the rest of the data, the bio's __bi_remaining might
already have been decremented to 0, e.g.: if bio passed to underlying
data device was split via blk_queue_split().

Use dm_bio_{record,restore} rather than effectively open-coding them in
dm-integrity -- these methods now manage __bi_remaining too.
