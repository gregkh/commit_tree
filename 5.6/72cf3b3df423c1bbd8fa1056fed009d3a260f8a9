MIPS: vdso: Wrap -mexplicit-relocs in cc-option

Clang does not support this option and errors out:

clang-11: error: unknown argument: '-mexplicit-relocs'

Clang does not appear to need this flag like GCC does because the jalr
check that was added in commit 976c23af3ee5 ("mips: vdso: add build
time check that no 'jalr t9' calls left") passes just fine with

$ make ARCH=mips CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=mipsel-linux-gnu- malta_defconfig arch/mips/vdso/

even before commit d3f703c4359f ("mips: vdso: fix 'jalr t9' crash in
vdso code").

-mrelax-pic-calls has been supported since clang 9, which is the
earliest version that could build a working MIPS kernel, and it is the
default for clang so just leave it be.
