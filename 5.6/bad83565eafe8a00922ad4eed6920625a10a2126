dmaengine: Cleanups for the slave <-> channel symlink support

No need to use goto to jump over the
return chan ? chan : ERR_PTR(-EPROBE_DEFER);
We can just revert the check and return right there.

Do not fail the channel request if the chan->name allocation fails, but
print a warning about it.

Change the dev_err to dev_warn if sysfs_create_link() fails as it is not
fatal.

Only attempt to remove the DMA_SLAVE_NAME symlink if it is created - or it
was attempted to be created.
