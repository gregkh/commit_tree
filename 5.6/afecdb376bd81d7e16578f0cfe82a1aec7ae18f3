ipv6: Fix nlmsg_flags when splitting a multipath route

When splitting an RTA_MULTIPATH request into multiple routes and adding the
second and later components, we must not simply remove NLM_F_REPLACE but
instead replace it by NLM_F_CREATE. Otherwise, it may look like the netlink
message was malformed.

For example,
	ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
	ip route change 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:1 dev dummy0 \
		nexthop via fe80::30:2 dev dummy0
results in the following warnings:
[ 1035.057019] IPv6: RTM_NEWROUTE with no NLM_F_CREATE or NLM_F_REPLACE
[ 1035.057517] IPv6: NLM_F_CREATE should be set when creating new route

This patch makes the nlmsg sequence look equivalent for __ip6_ins_rt() to
what it would get if the multipath route had been added in multiple netlink
operations:
	ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
	ip route change 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:1 dev dummy0
	ip route append 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:2 dev dummy0
