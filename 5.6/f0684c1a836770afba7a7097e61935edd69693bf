phy/rockchip: inno-dsidphy: generalize parameter handling

During review it came to light that exposing the pll clock outside is
not the right approach and struct phy_configure_opts_mipi_dphy exists
just for that reason to transfer parameters to the phy.

So drop the exposed clock and rely on the phy configure options
to bring in the correct rate. That way we can also just drop the
open coded timing struct and default values function.
