KVM: x86/mmu: Refactor the per-slot level calculation in mapping_level()

Invert the loop which adjusts the allowed page level based on what's
compatible with the associated memslot to use a largest-to-smallest
page size walk.  This paves the way for passing around a "max level"
variable instead of having redundant checks and/or multiple booleans.

No functional change intended.
