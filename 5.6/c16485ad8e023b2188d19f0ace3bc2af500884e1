gpio: Add support for the Xylon LogiCVC GPIOs

The LogiCVC display hardware block comes with GPIO capabilities
that must be exposed separately from the main driver (as GPIOs) for
use with regulators and panels. A syscon is used to share the same
regmap across the two drivers.

Add a minimalistic GPIO driver to drive these GPIOs, using a syscon
regmap when available.
