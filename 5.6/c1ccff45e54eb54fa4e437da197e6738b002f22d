docs/memory-barriers.txt.kokr: Minor wordsmith

As suggested by Paul, I got a review from another Korean hacker Yunjae.
 From the review, I got not only 'Reviewed-by:' tags, but also found a
few minor nits.  So I made a second version of the patchset but just
realized that the first version has already sent to Linus.  I therefore
send only the nit fixes as another patch.
