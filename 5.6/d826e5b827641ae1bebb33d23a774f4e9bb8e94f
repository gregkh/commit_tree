NFSv4.x recover from pre-mature loss of openstateid

Ever since the commit 0e0cb35b417f, it's possible to lose an open stateid
while retrying a CLOSE due to ERR_OLD_STATEID. Once that happens,
operations that require openstateid fail with EAGAIN which is propagated
to the application then tests like generic/446 and generic/168 fail with
"Resource temporarily unavailable".

Instead of returning this error, initiate state recovery when possible to
recover the open stateid and then try calling nfs4_select_rw_stateid()
again.
