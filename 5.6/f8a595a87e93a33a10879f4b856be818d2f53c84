ath10k: Fix qmi init error handling

When ath10k_qmi_init() fails, the error handling does not free the irq
resources, which causes an issue if we EPROBE_DEFER as we'll attempt to
(re-)register irqs which are already registered.

Fix this by doing a power off since we just powered on the hardware, and
freeing the irqs as error handling.
