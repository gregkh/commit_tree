drm/modes: parse_cmdline: Set bpp/refresh_specified after successful parsing

drm_connector_get_cmdline_mode() calls
drm_mode_parse_command_line_for_connector() with &connector->cmdline_mode
as mode argument, so anything which we store in the mode arguments gets
kept even if we return false.

Avoid storing a possibly false-postive bpp/refresh_specified setting
in connector->cmdline_mode by moving the setting of these to after
successful parsing of the bpp/refresh parts of the video= argument.
