dt-bindings: media: csi: Fix clocks description

Commit 1de243b07666 ("media: dt-bindings: media: sun4i-csi: Add compatible
for CSI1 on A10/A20") introduced support for the CSI1 controller on A10 and
A20 that unlike CSI0 doesn't have an ISP and therefore only have two
clocks, the bus and module clocks.

The clocks and clock-names properties have thus been modified to allow
either two or tree clocks. However, the current list has the ISP clock at
the second position, which means the bindings expects a list of either
bus and isp, or bus, isp and mod. The initial intent of the patch was
obviously to have bus and mod in the former case.

Let's fix the binding so that it validates properly.
