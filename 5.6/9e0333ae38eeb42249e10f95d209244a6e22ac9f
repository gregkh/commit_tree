clocksource/drivers/hyper-v: Set TSC clocksource as default w/ InvariantTSC

Change the Hyper-V clocksource ratings to 250, below the TSC clocksource
rating of 300.  In configurations where Hyper-V offers an InvariantTSC,
the TSC is not marked "unstable", so the TSC clocksource is available
and preferred.  With the higher rating, it will be the default.  On
older hardware and Hyper-V versions, the TSC is marked "unstable", so no
TSC clocksource is created and the selected Hyper-V clocksource will be
the default.
