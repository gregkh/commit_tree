PCI: Add generic quirk for increasing D3hot delay

Separate the D3 delay increase functionality out of quirk_radeon_pm() into
its own function so that it can be shared with other quirks, including the
AMD Ryzen XHCI quirk that will be introduced in a followup commit.

Tweak the function name and message to indicate more clearly that the delay
relates to a D3hot-to-D0 transition.
