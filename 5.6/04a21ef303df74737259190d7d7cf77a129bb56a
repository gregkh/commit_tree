octeontx2-pf: Setup interrupts and NAPI handler

Completion queue (CQ) is the one with which HW notifies SW on a packet
reception or transmission. Each of the RQ and SQ are mapped to a unique
CQ and again both CQs are mapped to same interrupt ie the CINT. So that
each core has one interrupt source in whose handler both Rx and Tx
notifications are processed.

Also
- Registered a NAPI handler for the CINT.
- Setup coalescing parameters.
- IRQ affinity hints etc
