libbpf: Poison kernel-only integer types

It's been a recurring issue with types like u32 slipping into libbpf source
code accidentally. This is not detected during builds inside kernel source
tree, but becomes a compilation error in libbpf's Github repo. Libbpf is
supposed to use only __{s,u}{8,16,32,64} typedefs, so poison {s,u}{8,16,32,64}
explicitly in every .c file. Doing that in a bit more centralized way, e.g.,
inside libbpf_internal.h breaks selftests, which are both using kernel u32 and
libbpf_internal.h.

This patch also fixes a new u32 occurence in libbpf.c, added recently.
