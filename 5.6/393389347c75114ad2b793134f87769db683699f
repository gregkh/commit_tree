drm/komeda: Optionally dump DRM state on interrupts

It's potentially useful information when diagnosing error/warn IRQs, so
dump it to dmesg with a drm_info_printer. Hide this extra debug dumping
behind another komeda_dev->err_verbosity bit.

Note that there's not much sense in dumping it for INFO events,
since the VSYNC event will swamp the log.
