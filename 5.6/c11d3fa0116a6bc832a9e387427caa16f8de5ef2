lib/string.c: update match_string() doc-strings with correct behavior

There were a few attempts at changing behavior of the match_string()
helpers (i.e.  'match_string()' & 'sysfs_match_string()'), to change &
extend the behavior according to the doc-string.

But the simplest approach is to just fix the doc-strings.  The current
behavior is fine as-is, and some bugs were introduced trying to fix it.

As for extending the behavior, new helpers can always be introduced if
needed.

The match_string() helpers behave more like 'strncmp()' in the sense
that they go up to n elements or until the first NULL element in the
array of strings.

This change updates the doc-strings with this info.
