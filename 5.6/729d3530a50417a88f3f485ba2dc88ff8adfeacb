drivers: firmware: scmi: Extend SCMI transport layer by trace events

The SCMI transport layer communicates via mailboxes and shared memory with
firmware running on a microcontroller. It is platform specific how long it
takes to pass a SCMI message. The most sensitive requests are coming from
CPUFreq subsystem, which might be used by the scheduler.
Thus, there is a need to measure these delays and capture anomalies.
This change introduces trace events wrapped around transfer code.

According to Jim's suggestion a unique transfer_id is to distinguish
similar entries which might have the same message id, protocol id and
sequence. This is a case then there are some timeouts in transfers.
