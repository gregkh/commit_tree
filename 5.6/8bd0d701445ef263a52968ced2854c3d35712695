cifs: add support for fallocate mode 0 for non-sparse files

RHBZ 1336264

When we extend a file we must also force the size to be updated.

This fixes an issue with holetest in xfs-tests which performs the following
sequence :
1, create a new file
2, use fallocate mode==0 to populate the file
3, mmap the file
4, touch each page by reading the mmapped region.
