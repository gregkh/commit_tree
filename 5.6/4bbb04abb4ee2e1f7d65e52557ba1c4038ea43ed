xfs: truncate should remove all blocks, not just to the end of the page cache

xfs_itruncate_extents_flags() is supposed to unmap every block in a file
from EOF onwards.  Oddly, it uses s_maxbytes as the upper limit to the
bunmapi range, even though s_maxbytes reflects the highest offset the
pagecache can support, not the highest offset that XFS supports.

The result of this confusion is that if you create a 20T file on a
64-bit machine, mount the filesystem on a 32-bit machine, and remove the
file, we leak everything above 16T.  Fix this by capping the bunmapi
request at the maximum possible block offset, not s_maxbytes.
