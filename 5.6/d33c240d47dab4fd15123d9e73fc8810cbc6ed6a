hv_balloon: Balloon up according to request page number

Current code has assumption that balloon request memory size aligns
with 2MB. But actually Hyper-V doesn't guarantee such alignment. When
balloon driver receives non-aligned balloon request, it produces warning
and balloon up more memory than requested in order to keep 2MB alignment.
Remove the warning and balloon up memory according to actual requested
memory size.
