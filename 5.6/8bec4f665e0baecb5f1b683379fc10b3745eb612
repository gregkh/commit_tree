selftests: bpf: Ignore FIN packets for reuseport tests

The reuseport tests currently suffer from a race condition: FIN
packets count towards DROP_ERR_SKB_DATA, since they don't contain
a valid struct cmd. Tests will spuriously fail depending on whether
check_results is called before or after the FIN is processed.

Exit the BPF program early if FIN is set.
