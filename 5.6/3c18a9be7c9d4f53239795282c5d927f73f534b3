tracing: Have synthetic event test use raw_smp_processor_id()

The test code that tests synthetic event creation pushes in as one of its
test fields the current CPU using "smp_processor_id()". As this is just
something to see if the value is correctly passed in, and the actual CPU
used does not matter, use raw_smp_processor_id(), otherwise with debug
preemption enabled, a warning happens as the smp_processor_id() is called
without preemption enabled.
