ext4: fix potential race between online resizing and write operations

During an online resize an array of pointers to buffer heads gets
replaced so it can get enlarged.  If there is a racing block
allocation or deallocation which uses the old array, and the old array
has gotten reused this can lead to a GPF or some other random kernel
memory getting modified.
