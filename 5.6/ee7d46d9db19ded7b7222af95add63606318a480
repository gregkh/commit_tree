io_uring: optimise head checks in io_get_sqring()

A user may ask to submit more than there is in the ring, and then
io_uring will submit as much as it can. However, in the last iteration
it will allocate an io_kiocb and immediately free it. It could do
better and adjust @to_submit to what is in the ring.

And since the ring's head is already checked here, there is no need to
do it in the loop, spamming with smp_load_acquire()'s barriers
