bootconfig: Add append value operator support

Add append value operator "+=" support to bootconfig syntax.
With this operator, user can add new value to the key as
an entry of array instead of overwriting.
For example,

  foo = bar
  ...
  foo += baz

Then the key "foo" has "bar" and "baz" values as an array.
