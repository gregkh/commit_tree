drm/amd/display: fix dereference of pointer aconnector when it is null

Currently pointer aconnector is being dereferenced by the call to
to_dm_connector_state before it is being null checked, this could
lead to a null pointer dereference.  Fix this by checking that
aconnector is null before dereferencing it.
