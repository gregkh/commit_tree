bpf: Print error message for bpftool cgroup show

Currently, when bpftool cgroup show <path> has an error, no error
message is printed. This is confusing because the user may think the
result is empty.

Before the change:

$ bpftool cgroup show /sys/fs/cgroup
ID       AttachType      AttachFlags     Name
$ echo $?
255

After the change:
$ ./bpftool cgroup show /sys/fs/cgroup
Error: can't query bpf programs attached to /sys/fs/cgroup: Operation
not permitted

v2: Rename check_query_cgroup_progs to cgroup_has_attached_progs
