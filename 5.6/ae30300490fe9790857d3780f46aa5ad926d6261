drm/i915: Specialise i915_active.work lock classes

Similar to for i915_active.mutex, we require each class of i915_active
to have distinct lockdep chains as some, but by no means all,
i915_active are used within the shrinker and so have much more severe
usage constraints. By using a lockclass local to i915_active_init() all
i915_active workers have the same lock class, and we may generate false
positives when waiting for the i915_active. If we push the lockclass
into the caller, each class of i915_active will have distinct lockdep
chains.
