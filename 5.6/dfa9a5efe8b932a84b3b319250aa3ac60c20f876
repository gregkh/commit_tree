ALSA: rawmidi: Avoid bit fields for state flags

The rawmidi state flags (opened, append, active_sensing) are stored in
bit fields that can be potentially racy when concurrently accessed
without any locks.  Although the current code should be fine, there is
also no any real benefit by keeping the bitfields for this kind of
short number of members.

This patch changes those bit fields flags to the simple bool fields.
There should be no size increase of the snd_rawmidi_substream by this
change.
