drm/i915/gt: Invalidate as we write the gen7 breadcrumb

Still the saga of the hsw live_blt incoherency continues. While it did
seem that the invalidate before the breadcrumb had improved the mtbf,
nevertheless live_blt still failed. Mika's next idea was to pull the
invalidate-stall into the breadcrumb write itself.
