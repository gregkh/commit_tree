bootconfig: Prohibit re-defining value on same key

Currently, bootconfig adds a new value on the existing key to the tail of an
array. But this looks a bit confusing because an admin can easily rewrite
the original value in the same config file.

This rejects the following value re-definition.

  key = value1
  ...
  key = value2

You should rewrite value1 to value2 in this case.
