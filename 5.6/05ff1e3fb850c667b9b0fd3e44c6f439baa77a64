ARM: dts: exynos: Fix regulator node aliasing on Midas-based boards

Commit d4ec0cb05064 ("ARM: dts: exynos: Add support for the
touch-sensitive buttons on Midas family") added a new fixed regulator
("voltage-regulator-6") to base "midas" .dtsi, but it didn't update the
clients of that .dtsi, which define their own fixed regulators starting
from the "voltage-regulator-6". This results in aliasing of the regulator
dt nodes and breaks operation of OLED panel due to lack of power supply.
Fix this by increasing the numbers in the fixed regulator names for those
boards.
