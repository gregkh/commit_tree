dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Fix terminated transfer handling

When we receive back the descriptor of the terminated transfer the cookie
must be marked as completed to make sure that the accounting is correct.

In udma_tx_status() the status should be marked as completed if the channel
is no longer running (it can only happen if the channel is not yet started
for the first time, or after a channel termination).
