mm/gup: introduce pin_user_pages*() and FOLL_PIN

Introduce pin_user_pages*() variations of get_user_pages*() calls, and
also pin_longterm_pages*() variations.

For now, these are placeholder calls, until the various call sites are
converted to use the correct get_user_pages*() or pin_user_pages*() API.

These variants will eventually all set FOLL_PIN, which is also
introduced, and thoroughly documented.

    pin_user_pages()
    pin_user_pages_remote()
    pin_user_pages_fast()

All pages that are pinned via the above calls, must be unpinned via
put_user_page().

The underlying rules are:

* FOLL_PIN is a gup-internal flag, so the call sites should not directly
  set it.  That behavior is enforced with assertions.

* Call sites that want to indicate that they are going to do DirectIO
  ("DIO") or something with similar characteristics, should call a
  get_user_pages()-like wrapper call that sets FOLL_PIN.  These wrappers
  will:

    * Start with "pin_user_pages" instead of "get_user_pages".  That
      makes it easy to find and audit the call sites.

    * Set FOLL_PIN

* For pages that are received via FOLL_PIN, those pages must be returned
  via put_user_page().

Thanks to Jan Kara and Vlastimil Babka for explaining the 4 cases in
this documentation.  (I've reworded it and expanded upon it.)
