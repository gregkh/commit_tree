powerpc/iov: Move VF pdev fixup into pcibios_fixup_iov()

An ioda_pe for each VF is allocated in pnv_pci_sriov_enable() before
the pci_dev for the VF is created. We need to set the pe->pdev pointer
at some point after the pci_dev is created. Currently we do that in:

pcibios_bus_add_device()
	pnv_pci_dma_dev_setup() (via phb->ops.dma_dev_setup)
		/* fixup is done here */
		pnv_pci_ioda_dma_dev_setup() (via pnv_phb->dma_dev_setup)

The fixup needs to be done before setting up DMA for for the VF's PE,
but there's no real reason to delay it until this point. Move the
fixup into pnv_pci_ioda_fixup_iov() so the ordering is:

	pcibios_add_device()
		pnv_pci_ioda_fixup_iov() (via ppc_md.pcibios_fixup_sriov)

	pcibios_bus_add_device()
		...

This isn't strictly required, but it's a slightly more logical place
to do the fixup and it simplifies pnv_pci_dma_dev_setup().
