drm/amd/display: Fix static analysis bug in validate_bksv

[Why]
static analysis throws the error below

Out-of-bounds read (OVERRUN)
Overrunning array of 5 bytes at byte offset 7 by dereferencing pointer
(uint64_t *)hdcp->auth.msg.hdcp1.bksv.

var n is going to contain  r0p and bcaps. if they are non-zero the count
will be wrong

How]
Use memcpy instead to avoid this.
