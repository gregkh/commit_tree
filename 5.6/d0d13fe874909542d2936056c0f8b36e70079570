drm/amdgpu: put flush_delayed_work at first

There is one regression from 042f3d7b745cd76aa
To put flush_delayed_work after adev->shutdown = true
which will make amdgpu_ih_process not response the irq
At last, all ib ring tests will be failed just like below

[drm] amdgpu: finishing device.

[drm] Fence fallback timer expired on ring comp_1.0.0
