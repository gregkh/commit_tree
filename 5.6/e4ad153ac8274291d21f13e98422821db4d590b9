Input: synaptics-rmi4 - set reduced reporting mode only when requested

The previous patch "c5ccf2ad3d33 (Input: synaptics-rmi4 - switch to
reduced reporting mode)" enabled reduced reporting mode unintentionally
on some devices, if the firmware was configured with default Delta X/Y
threshold values. The result unintentionally degrade the performance of
some touchpads.

This patch checks to see that the driver is modifying the delta X/Y
thresholds before modifying the reporting mode.
