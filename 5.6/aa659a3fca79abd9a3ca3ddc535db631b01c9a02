ACPI: processor: Clean up acpi_processor_evaluate_cst()

Clean up acpi_processor_evaluate_cst() in multiple ways:

 * Rename current_count to last_index which matches the purpose of
   the variable better.

 * Consistently use acpi_handle_*() for printing messages and make
   the messages cleaner.

 * Drop redundant parens and braces.

 * Rewrite and clarify comments.

 * Rearrange checks and drop the redundant ones.

No intentional functional impact.
