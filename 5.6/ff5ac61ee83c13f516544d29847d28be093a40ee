x86/ima: use correct identifier for SetupMode variable

The IMA arch code attempts to inspect the "SetupMode" EFI variable
by populating a variable called efi_SetupMode_name with the string
"SecureBoot" and passing that to the EFI GetVariable service, which
obviously does not yield the expected result.

Given that the string is only referenced a single time, let's get
rid of the intermediate variable, and pass the correct string as
an immediate argument. While at it, do the same for "SecureBoot".
