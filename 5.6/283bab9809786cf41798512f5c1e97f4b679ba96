x86/cpu: Remove redundant cpu_detect_cache_sizes() call

Both functions call init_intel_cacheinfo() which computes L2 and L3 cache
sizes from CPUID(4). But then they also call cpu_detect_cache_sizes() a
bit later which computes ->x86_tlbsize and L2 size from CPUID(80000006).

However, the latter call is not needed because

 - on these CPUs, CPUID(80000006).EBX for ->x86_tlbsize is reserved

 - CPUID(80000006).ECX for the L2 size has the same result as CPUID(4)

Therefore, remove the latter call to simplify the code.
