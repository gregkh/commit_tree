KVM: X86: Move irrelevant declarations out of ioapic.h

kvm_apic_match_dest() is declared in both ioapic.h and lapic.h.
Remove the declaration in ioapic.h.

kvm_apic_compare_prio() is declared in ioapic.h but defined in
lapic.c.  Move the declaration to lapic.h.

kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic() is declared in ioapic.h but defined in
irq_comm.c.  Move the declaration to irq.h.

hyperv.c needs to use kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic(). Include irq.h in
hyperv.c.
