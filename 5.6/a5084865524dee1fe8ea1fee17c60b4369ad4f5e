xfs: introduce XFS_MAX_FILEOFF

Introduce a new #define for the maximum supported file block offset.
We'll use this in the next patch to make it more obvious that we're
doing some operation for all possible inode fork mappings after a given
offset.  We can't use ULLONG_MAX here because bunmapi uses that to
detect when it's done.
