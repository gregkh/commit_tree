binder: fix log spam for existing debugfs file creation.

Since commit 43e23b6c0b01 ("debugfs: log errors when something goes wrong")
debugfs logs attempts to create existing files.

However binder attempts to create multiple debugfs files with
the same name when a single PID has multiple contexts, this leads
to log spamming during an Android boot (17 such messages during
boot on my system).

Fix this by checking if we already know the PID and only create
the debugfs entry for the first context per PID.

Do the same thing for binderfs for symmetry.
