dmaengine: ti: k3-udma: Use the channel direction in pause/resume functions

It should be possible to pause, resume and check the pause state of a
channel even if we do not have active transfer.

udma_is_chan_paused() can trigger NULL pointer reference in it's current
form when the status is checked while uc->desc is NULL.
