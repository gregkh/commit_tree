iommu/amd: Only support x2APIC with IVHD type 11h/40h

Current implementation for IOMMU x2APIC support makes use of
the MMIO access to MSI capability block registers, which requires
checking EFR[MsiCapMmioSup]. However, only IVHD type 11h/40h contain
the information, and not in the IVHD type 10h IOMMU feature reporting
field. Since the BIOS in newer systems, which supports x2APIC, would
normally contain IVHD type 11h/40h, remove the IOMMU_FEAT_XTSUP_SHIFT
check for IVHD type 10h, and only support x2APIC with IVHD type 11h/40h.
