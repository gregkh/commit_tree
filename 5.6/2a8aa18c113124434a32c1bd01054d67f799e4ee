dt-bindings: clk: qcom: Fix self-validation, split, and clean cruft

The 'qcom,gcc.yaml' file failed self-validation (dt_binding_check)
because it required a property to be either (3 entries big),
(3 entries big), or (7 entries big), but not more than one of those
things.  That didn't make a ton of sense.

This patch splits all of the exceptional device trees (AKA those that
would have needed if/then/else rules) from qcom,gcc.yaml.  It also
cleans up some cruft found while doing that.

After this lands, this worked for me atop clk-next with just the known
error about msm8998:
  for f in \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-apq8064.yaml \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-ipq8074.yaml \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-msm8996.yaml \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-msm8998.yaml \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-qcs404.yaml \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-sc7180.yaml \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-sm8150.yaml \
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc.yaml; do \
      ARCH=arm64 make dtbs_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=$f; \
  done

I then picked this patch atop linux-next (next-20200129) and ran:
  # Delete broken yaml:
  rm Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/intel-gw-pcie.yaml
  ARCH=arm64 make dt_binding_check | grep 'clock/qcom'
...and that didn't seem to indicate problems.

Arbitrary decisions made (yell if you want changed):
- Left all the older devices (where clocks / clock-names weren't
  specified) in a single file.
- Didn't make clocks "required" for msm8996 but left them as listed.
  This seems a little weird but it matches the old binding.

Misc cleanups as part of this patch:
- Fixed schema id to not have "bindings/" as per Rob [1].
- Listed include files as per Stephen.
- sm8150 was claimed to be same set of clocks as sc7180, but driver
  and dts appear to say that "bi_tcxo_ao" doesn't exist.  Fixed.
- In "apq8064", "#thermal-sensor-cells" was missing the "#".
- Got rid of "|" at the end of top description since spacing doesn't
  matter.
- Changed indentation to consistently 2 spaces (it was 3 in some
  places).
- Added period at the end of protected-clocks description.
- No space before ":".
- Updated sc7180/sm8150 example to use the 'qcom,rpmh.h' include.
- Updated sc7180/sm8150 example to use larger address/size cells as
  per reality.
- Updated sc7180/sm8150 example to point to the sleep_clk rather than
  <0>.
- Made it so that gcc-ipq8074 didn't require #power-domain-cells since
  actual dts didn't have it and I got no hits from:
    git grep _GDSC include/dt-bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-ipq8074.h
- Made it so that gcc-qcs404 didn't require #power-domain-cells since
  actual dts didn't have it and I got no hits from:
    git grep _GDSC include/dt-bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-qcs404.h

Noticed, but not done in this patch (volunteers needed):
- Add "aud_ref_clk" to sm8150 bindings / dts even though I found a
  reference to it in "gcc-sm8150.c".
- Fix node name in actual ipq8074 to be "clock-controller" (it's gcc).
- Since the example doesn't need phandes to exist, in msm8998 could
  just make up places providing some of the clocks currently bogused
  out with <0>.
- On msm8998 clocks are listed as required but current dts doesn't
  have them.
