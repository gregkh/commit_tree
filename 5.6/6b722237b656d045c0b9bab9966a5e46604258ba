net: fib_notifier: Add temporary events to the FIB notification chain

Subsequent patches are going to simplify the IPv6 route offload API,
which will only use three events - replace, delete and append.

Introduce a temporary version of replace and delete in order to make the
conversion easier to review. Note that append does not need a temporary
version, as it is currently not used.
