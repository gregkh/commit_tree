drm/amd/display: Trigger modesets on MST DSC connectors

Whenever a connector on an MST network is attached, detached, or
undergoes a modeset, the DSC configs for each stream on that
topology will be recalculated. This can change their required
bandwidth, requiring a full reprogramming, as though a modeset
was performed, even if that stream did not change timing.

Therefore, whenever a crtc has drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset,
for each crtc that shares a MST topology with that stream and
supports DSC, add that crtc (and all affected connectors and
planes) to the atomic state and set mode_changed on its state

v2: Do this check only on Navi and before adding connectors
and planes on modesetting crtcs

v3: Call the drm_dp_mst_add_affected_dsc_crtcs() to update
all affected CRTCs
