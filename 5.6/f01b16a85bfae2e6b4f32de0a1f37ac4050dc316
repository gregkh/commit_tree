dax: Get rid of fs_dax_get_by_host() helper

Looks like nobody is using fs_dax_get_by_host() except fs_dax_get_by_bdev()
and it can easily use dax_get_by_host() instead.

IIUC, fs_dax_get_by_host() was only introduced so that one could compile
with CONFIG_FS_DAX=n and CONFIG_DAX=m. fs_dax_get_by_bdev() achieves
the same purpose and hence it looks like fs_dax_get_by_host() is not
needed anymore.
