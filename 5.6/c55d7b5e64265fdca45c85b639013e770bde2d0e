powerpc: Remove STRICT_KERNEL_RWX incompatibility with RELOCATABLE

I have tested this with the Radix MMU and everything seems to work, and
the previous patch for Hash seems to fix everything too.
STRICT_KERNEL_RWX should still be disabled by default for now.

Please test STRICT_KERNEL_RWX + RELOCATABLE!
