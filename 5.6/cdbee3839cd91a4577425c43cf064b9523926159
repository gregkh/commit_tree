libbpf: Introduce bpf_prog_attach_xattr

Introduce a new bpf_prog_attach_xattr function that, in addition to
program fd, target fd and attach type, accepts an extendable struct
bpf_prog_attach_opts.

bpf_prog_attach_opts relies on DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS macro to maintain
backward and forward compatibility and has the following "optional"
attach attributes:

* existing attach_flags, since it's not required when attaching in NONE
  mode. Even though it's quite often used in MULTI and OVERRIDE mode it
  seems to be a good idea to reduce number of arguments to
  bpf_prog_attach_xattr;

* newly introduced attribute of BPF_PROG_ATTACH command: replace_prog_fd
  that is fd of previously attached cgroup-bpf program to replace if
  BPF_F_REPLACE flag is used.

The new function is named to be consistent with other xattr-functions
(bpf_prog_test_run_xattr, bpf_create_map_xattr, bpf_load_program_xattr).

The struct bpf_prog_attach_opts is supposed to be used with
DECLARE_LIBBPF_OPTS macro.
