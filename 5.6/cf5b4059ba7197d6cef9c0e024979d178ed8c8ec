NFSv4: Fix races between open and dentry revalidation

We want to make sure that we revalidate the dentry if and only if
we've done an OPEN by filename.
In order to avoid races with remote changes to the directory on the
server, we want to save the verifier before calling OPEN. The exception
is if the server returned a delegation with our OPEN, as we then
know that the filename can't have changed on the server.
