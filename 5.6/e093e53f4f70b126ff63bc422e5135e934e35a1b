power: avs: qcom-cpr: Avoid clang -Wsometimes-uninitialized in cpr_scale

Clang warns (trimmed for brevity):

../drivers/power/avs/qcom-cpr.c:570:13: warning: variable 'reg_mask' is
used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

../drivers/power/avs/qcom-cpr.c:520:13: warning: variable 'new_uV' is
used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

Due to the fact that Clang's static analysis happens before any
optimization passes are taken into account, it cannot see that both
branches in the if statement must be taken because dir cannot be
something other than UP or DOWN due to the check at the top of this
function. Change the else if condition to else to fix this false
positive.
