amd/amdgpu/sriov enable onevf mode for ARCTURUS VF

Before, initialization of smu ip block would be skipped
for sriov ASICs. But if there's only one VF being used,
guest driver should be able to dump some HW info such as
clks, temperature,etc.

To solve this, now after onevf mode is enabled, host
driver will notify guest. If it's onevf mode, guest will
do smu hw_init and skip some steps in normal smu hw_init
flow because host driver has already done it for smu.

With this fix, guest app can talk with smu and dump hw
information from smu.

v2: refine the logic for pm_enabled.Skip hw_init by not
changing pm_enabled.
v3: refine is_support_sw_smu and fix some indentation
issue.
