drm/dp_mst: Add PBN calculation for DSC modes

With DSC, bpp can be fractional in multiples of 1/16.

Change drm_dp_calc_pbn_mode to reflect this, adding a new
parameter bool dsc. When this parameter is true, treat the
bpp parameter as having units not of bits per pixel, but
1/16 of a bit per pixel

v2: Don't add separate function for this
v3: In the equation divide bpp by 16 as it is expected
not to leave any remainder
v4: Added DSC test parameters for selftest
