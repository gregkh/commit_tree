net: phy: marvell: initialise link partner state earlier

Move the initialisation of the link partner state earlier, inside
marvell_read_status_page(), so we don't have the same initialisation
scattered amongst the other files.  This is in a similar place to
the genphy implementation, so would result in the same behaviour if
a PHY read error occurs.

This allows us to get rid of marvell_read_status_page_fixed(), which
became a pointless wrapper around genphy_read_status_fixed().
