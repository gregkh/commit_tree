icmp: introduce helper for nat'd source address in network device context

This introduces a helper function to be called only by network drivers
that wraps calls to icmp[v6]_send in a conntrack transformation, in case
NAT has been used. We don't want to pollute the non-driver path, though,
so we introduce this as a helper to be called by places that actually
make use of this, as suggested by Florian.
