scsi: qla2xxx: Fix RIDA Format-2

This patch fixes offset for Format-2 data structure for Report ID
Acquisition. This caused driver to set remote_nport_id to 0x0000 in N2N
configuration. In a scenario where initiator's WWPN is higher than target's
WWPN, driver will assign 0x00 as target nport-id, which results into login
failure.
