ALSA: hda: patch_realtek: fix empty macro usage in if block

GCC reports the following warning with W=1

sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c: In function ‘alc269_suspend’:
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:3616:29: warning: suggest braces around
empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
 3616 |   alc5505_dsp_suspend(codec);
      |                             ^

sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c: In function ‘alc269_resume’:
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:3651:28: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
 3651 |   alc5505_dsp_resume(codec);
      |                            ^

This is a classic macro problem and can indeed lead to bad program
flows.

Fix by using the usual "do { } while (0)" pattern
