net: sch_ets: Add a new Qdisc

Introduces a new Qdisc, which is based on 802.1Q-2014 wording. It is
PRIO-like in how it is configured, meaning one needs to specify how many
bands there are, how many are strict and how many are dwrr, quanta for the
latter, and priomap.

The new Qdisc operates like the PRIO / DRR combo would when configured as
per the standard. The strict classes, if any, are tried for traffic first.
When there's no traffic in any of the strict queues, the ETS ones (if any)
are treated in the same way as in DRR.
