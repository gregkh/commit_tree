io_uring: prevent sq_thread from spinning when it should stop

This patch drops 'cur_mm' before calling cond_resched(), to prevent
the sq_thread from spinning even when the user process is finished.

Before this patch, if the user process ended without closing the
io_uring fd, the sq_thread continues to spin until the
'sq_thread_idle' timeout ends.

In the worst case where the 'sq_thread_idle' parameter is bigger than
INT_MAX, the sq_thread will spin forever.
