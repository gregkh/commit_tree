Documentation/ko_KR/howto: Update broken web addresses

Commit 0ea6e6112219 ("Documentation: update broken web addresses.")
removed a link to 'http://patchwork.ozlabs.org' in howto, but the change
has not applied to the Korean translation.  This commit simply applies
the change to the Korean translation.  The link is restored now, though.
