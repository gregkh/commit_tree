net: sched: correct flower port blocking

tc flower rules that are based on src or dst port blocking are sometimes
ineffective due to uninitialized stack data. __skb_flow_dissect() extracts
ports from the skb for tc flower to match against. However, the port
dissection is not done when when the FLOW_DIS_IS_FRAGMENT bit is set in
key_control->flags. All callers of __skb_flow_dissect(), zero-out the
key_control field except for fl_classify() as used by the flower
classifier. Thus, the FLOW_DIS_IS_FRAGMENT may be set on entry to
__skb_flow_dissect(), since key_control is allocated on the stack
and may not be initialized.

Since key_basic and key_control are present for all flow keys, let's
make sure they are initialized.
