xsk: Add function naming comments and reorder functions

Add comments on how the ring access functions are named and how they
are supposed to be used for producers and consumers. The functions are
also reordered so that the consumer functions are in the beginning and
the producer functions in the end, for easier reference. Put this in a
separate patch as the diff might look a little odd, but no
functionality has changed in this patch.
