sched: Spare resched IPI when prio changes on a single fair task

The runqueue of a fair task being remotely reniced is going to get a
resched IPI in order to reassess which task should be the current
running on the CPU. However that evaluation is useless if the fair task
is running alone, in which case we can spare that IPI, preventing
nohz_full CPUs from being disturbed.
