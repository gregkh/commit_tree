net: xfrm: use skb_list_walk_safe helper for gso segments

This is converts xfrm segment iteration to use the new function, keeping
the flow of the existing code as intact as possible. One case is very
straight-forward, whereas the other case has some more subtle code that
likes to peak at ->next and relink skbs. By keeping the variables the
same as before, we can upgrade this code with minimal surgery required.
