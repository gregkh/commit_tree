ASoC: pcm: Fix possible buffer overflow in dpcm state sysfs output

dpcm_show_state() invokes multiple snprintf() calls to concatenate
formatted strings on the fixed size buffer.  The usage of snprintf()
is supposed for avoiding the buffer overflow, but it doesn't work as
expected because snprintf() doesn't return the actual output size but
the size to be written.

Fix this bug by replacing all snprintf() calls with scnprintf()
calls.
