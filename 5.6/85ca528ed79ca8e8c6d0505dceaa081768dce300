drm/i915/selftests: Replace mock_file hackery with drm's true fake

As drm now exports a method to create an anonymous struct file around a
drm_device for internal use, make use of it to avoid our horrible hacks.

Danial suggested that the mock_file_put() wrapper was suitable for
drm-core, along with the mock_drm_getfile() [and that the vestigal
mock_drm_file() in this patch should perhaps be the drm interface
itself]. However, the eventual goal is to remove the mock_drm_file() and
use the struct file and fput() directly, in this patch we take a simple
transition in that direction.
