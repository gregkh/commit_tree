io_uring: fix double prep iovec leak

Requests may be prepared multiple times with ->io allocated (i.e. async
prepared). Preparation functions don't handle it and forget about
previously allocated resources. This may happen in case of:
- spurious defer_check
- non-head (i.e. async prepared) request executed in sync (via nxt).

Make the handlers check, whether they already allocated resources, which
is true IFF REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP is set.
