spi: Add HiSilicon v3xx SPI NOR flash controller driver

Add the driver for the HiSilicon v3xx SPI NOR flash controller, commonly
found in hi16xx chipsets.

This is a different controller than that in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/hisi-sfc.c;
indeed, the naming for that driver is poor, since it is really known as
FMC, and can support other memory technologies.

The driver module name is "hisi-sfc-v3xx", as recommended by HW designer,
being an attempt to provide a distinct name - v3xx being the unique
controller versioning.

Only ACPI firmware is supported.

DMA is not supported, and we just use polling mode for operation
completion notification.

The driver uses the SPI MEM OPs.
