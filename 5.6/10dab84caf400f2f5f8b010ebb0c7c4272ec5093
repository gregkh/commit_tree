pid: make ENOMEM return value more obvious

The alloc_pid() codepath used to be simpler. With the introducation of the
ability to choose specific pids in 49cb2fc42ce4 ("fork: extend clone3() to
support setting a PID") it got more complex. It hasn't been super obvious
that ENOMEM is returned when the pid namespace init process/child subreaper
of the pid namespace has died. As can be seen from multiple attempts to
improve this see e.g. [1] and most recently [2].
We regressed returning ENOMEM in [3] and [2] restored it. Let's add a
comment on top explaining that this is historic and documented behavior and
cannot easily be changed.
