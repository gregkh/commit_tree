powerpc/eeh_cache: Don't use pci_dn when inserting new ranges

At the point where we start inserting ranges into the EEH address cache the
binding between pci_dev and eeh_dev has already been set up. Instead of
consulting the pci_dn tree we can retrieve the eeh_dev directly using
pci_dev_to_eeh_dev().
