drm/udl: Remove field lost_pixels from struct udl_device

The field lost_pixels in struct udl_device was supposed to signal an
error during USB transfers of the framebuffer data. The driver would
have to schedule a re-transfer at a later point. This code was never
implemented. Remove lost_pixels and return regular error codes instead.
