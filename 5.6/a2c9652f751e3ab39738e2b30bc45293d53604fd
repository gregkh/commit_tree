selftests: Refactor build to remove tools/lib/bpf from include path

To make sure no new files are introduced that doesn't include the bpf/
prefix in its #include, remove tools/lib/bpf from the include path
entirely.

Instead, we introduce a new header files directory under the scratch tools/
dir, and add a rule to run the 'install_headers' rule from libbpf to have a
full set of consistent libbpf headers in $(OUTPUT)/tools/include/bpf, and
then use $(OUTPUT)/tools/include as the include path for selftests.

For consistency we also make sure we put all the scratch build files from
other bpftool and libbpf into tools/build/, so everything stays within
selftests/.
