bpftool: Generate externs datasec in BPF skeleton

Add support for generation of mmap()-ed read-only view of libbpf-provided
extern variables. As externs are not supposed to be provided by user code
(that's what .data, .bss, and .rodata is for), don't mmap() it initially. Only
after skeleton load is performed, map .extern contents as read-only memory.
