MAINTAINERS: fix bad file pattern

Testing 'parse-maintainers' due to the previous commit shows a bad file
pattern for the "TI VPE/CAL DRIVERS" entry in the MAINTAINERS file.

There's also a lot of mis-ordered entries, but I'm still a bit nervous
about the inevitable and annoying merge problems it would probably cause
to fix them up.

The MAINTAINERS file is one of my least favorite files due to being huge
and centralized, but fixing it is also horribly painful for that reason.
