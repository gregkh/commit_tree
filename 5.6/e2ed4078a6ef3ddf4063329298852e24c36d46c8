kvm: i8254: Deactivate APICv when using in-kernel PIT re-injection mode.

AMD SVM AVIC accelerates EOI write and does not trap. This causes
in-kernel PIT re-injection mode to fail since it relies on irq-ack
notifier mechanism. So, APICv is activated only when in-kernel PIT
is in discard mode e.g. w/ qemu option:

  -global kvm-pit.lost_tick_policy=discard

Also, introduce APICV_INHIBIT_REASON_PIT_REINJ bit to be used for this
reason.
