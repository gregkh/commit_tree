ASoC: topology: Prevent use-after-free in snd_soc_get_pcm_runtime()

remove_link() is currently calling snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime() after
it has already freed the memory for the link name. But this is later
read from snd_soc_get_pcm_runtime() causing a KASAN use-after-free
warning. Reorder the cleanups to fix this issue.
