tty/serial: atmel: manage shutdown in case of RS485 or ISO7816 mode

In atmel_shutdown() we call atmel_stop_rx() and atmel_stop_tx() functions.
Prevent the rx restart that is implemented in RS485 or ISO7816 modes when
calling atmel_stop_tx() by using the atomic information tasklet_shutdown
that is already in place for this purpose.
