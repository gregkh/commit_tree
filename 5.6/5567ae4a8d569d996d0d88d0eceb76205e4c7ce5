bnxt_en: Improve device shutdown method.

Especially when bnxt_shutdown() is called during kexec, we need to
disable MSIX and disable Bus Master to completely quiesce the device.
Make these 2 calls unconditionally in the shutdown method.

Fixes: c20dc142dd7b ("bnxt_en: Disable bus master during PCI shutdown and driver unload.")
