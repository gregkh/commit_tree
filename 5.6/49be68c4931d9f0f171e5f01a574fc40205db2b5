udf: Fix meaning of ENTITYID_FLAGS_* macros to be really bitwise-or flags

Currently ENTITYID_FLAGS_* macros definitions are written as hex numbers
but their meaning is not bitwise-or flags. But rather bit position. This is
unusual and could be misleading. So change meaning of ENTITYID_FLAGS_*
macros definitions to be really bitwise-or flags.
