bpf: Add bpf_send_signal_thread() helper

Commit 8b401f9ed244 ("bpf: implement bpf_send_signal() helper")
added helper bpf_send_signal() which permits bpf program to
send a signal to the current process. The signal may be
delivered to any threads in the process.

We found a use case where sending the signal to the current
thread is more preferable.
  - A bpf program will collect the stack trace and then
    send signal to the user application.
  - The user application will add some thread specific
    information to the just collected stack trace for
    later analysis.

If bpf_send_signal() is used, user application will need
to check whether the thread receiving the signal matches
the thread collecting the stack by checking thread id.
If not, it will need to send signal to another thread
through pthread_kill().

This patch proposed a new helper bpf_send_signal_thread(),
which sends the signal to the thread corresponding to
the current kernel task. This way, user space is guaranteed that
bpf_program execution context and user space signal handling
context are the same thread.
