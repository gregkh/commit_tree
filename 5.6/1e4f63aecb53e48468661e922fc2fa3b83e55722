cpufreq: Avoid creating excessively large stack frames

In the process of modifying a cpufreq policy, the cpufreq core makes
a copy of it including all of the internals which is stored on the
CPU stack.  Because struct cpufreq_policy is relatively large, this
may cause the size of the stack frame to exceed the 2 KB limit and
so the GCC complains when -Wframe-larger-than= is used.

In fact, it is not necessary to copy the entire policy structure
in order to modify it, however.

First, because cpufreq_set_policy() obtains the min and max policy
limits from frequency QoS now, it is not necessary to pass the limits
to it from the callers.  The only things that need to be passed to it
from there are the new governor pointer or (if there is a built-in
governor in the driver) the "policy" value representing the governor
choice.  They both can be passed as individual arguments, though, so
make cpufreq_set_policy() take them this way and rework its callers
accordingly.  This avoids making copies of cpufreq policies in the
callers of cpufreq_set_policy().

Second, cpufreq_set_policy() still needs to pass the new policy
data to the ->verify() callback of the cpufreq driver whose task
is to sanitize the min and max policy limits.  It still does not
need to make a full copy of struct cpufreq_policy for this purpose,
but it needs to pass a few items from it to the driver in case they
are needed (different drivers have different needs in that respect
and all of them have to be covered).  For this reason, introduce
struct cpufreq_policy_data to hold copies of the members of
struct cpufreq_policy used by the existing ->verify() driver
callbacks and pass a pointer to a temporary structure of that
type to ->verify() (instead of passing a pointer to full struct
cpufreq_policy to it).

While at it, notice that intel_pstate and longrun don't really need
to verify the "policy" value in struct cpufreq_policy, so drop those
check from them to avoid copying "policy" into struct
cpufreq_policy_data (which allows it to be slightly smaller).

Also while at it fix up white space in a couple of places and make
cpufreq_set_policy() static (as it can be so).
