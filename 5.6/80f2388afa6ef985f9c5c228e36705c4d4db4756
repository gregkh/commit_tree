f2fs: fix race conditions in ->d_compare() and ->d_hash()

Since ->d_compare() and ->d_hash() can be called in RCU-walk mode,
->d_parent and ->d_inode can be concurrently modified, and in
particular, ->d_inode may be changed to NULL.  For f2fs_d_hash() this
resulted in a reproducible NULL dereference if a lookup is done in a
directory being deleted, e.g. with:

	int main()
	{
		if (fork()) {
			for (;;) {
				mkdir("subdir", 0700);
				rmdir("subdir");
			}
		} else {
			for (;;)
				access("subdir/file", 0);
		}
	}

... or by running the 't_encrypted_d_revalidate' program from xfstests.
Both repros work in any directory on a filesystem with the encoding
feature, even if the directory doesn't actually have the casefold flag.

I couldn't reproduce a crash in f2fs_d_compare(), but it appears that a
similar crash is possible there.

Fix these bugs by reading ->d_parent and ->d_inode using READ_ONCE() and
falling back to the case sensitive behavior if the inode is NULL.
