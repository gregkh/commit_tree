HID: hid-bigbenff: fix general protection fault caused by double kfree

The struct *bigben was allocated via devm_kzalloc() and then used as a
parameter in input_ff_create_memless(). This caused a double kfree
during removal of the device, since both the managed resource API and
ml_ff_destroy() in drivers/input/ff-memless.c would call kfree() on it.
