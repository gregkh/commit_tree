ath11k: driver for Qualcomm IEEE 802.11ax devices

ath11k is a new driver for Qualcomm IEEE 802.11ax devices, first
supporting only IPQ8074 SoC using the shared memory AHB bus. ath11k
uses mac80211 and supports AP, Station and Mesh modes.

Even though ath11k has some similar code as with ath10k (especially
the WMI layer) it was concluded to be simpler to have a "clean start"
for ath11k code base and not try to share the code with ath10k. This
makes maintenance easier and avoids major changes in ath10k, which
would have significantly increased the risk of regressions in existing
setups.

Even though the driver is very similar with ath10k but there are major
differences as well. The datapath is completely different. ath11k
supports multiple MACs, called "soc" in the firmware interface. And
there's only one WMI interface to support.

Currently ath11k supports only IEEE 802.11ac mode, but patches for
802.11ax are available and they will be submitted after ath11k is
accepted to upstream.

The firmware images are available from ath11k-firmware repository but
they will be also submitted to linux-firmware:

This was tested with firmware version WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-00629-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1.

The driver has had multiple authors who are listed in alphabetical
