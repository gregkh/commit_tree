dt-binding: fix compilation error of the example in qcom,gcc.yaml

Running `make dt_binging_check`, gives the error:

DTC     Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc.example.dt.yaml
Error: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qcom,gcc.example.dts:111.28-29 syntax error
FATAL ERROR: Unable to parse input tree

This is because the last example uses the macro RPM_SMD_XO_CLK_SRC which
is defined in qcom,rpmcc.h but the include of this header is missing.
Add the include to fix the error.
