icmp: allow icmpv6_ndo_send to work with CONFIG_IPV6=n

The icmpv6_send function has long had a static inline implementation
with an empty body for CONFIG_IPV6=n, so that code calling it doesn't
need to be ifdef'd. The new icmpv6_ndo_send function, which is intended
for drivers as a drop-in replacement with an identical function
signature, should follow the same pattern. Without this patch, drivers
that used to work with CONFIG_IPV6=n now result in a linker error.
