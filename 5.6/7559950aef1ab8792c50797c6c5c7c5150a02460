arm64: cpufeature: Set the FP/SIMD compat HWCAP bits properly

We set the compat_elf_hwcap bits unconditionally on arm64 to
include the VFP and NEON support. However, the FP/SIMD unit
is optional on Arm v8 and thus could be missing. We already
handle this properly in the kernel, but still advertise to
the COMPAT applications that the VFP is available. Fix this
to make sure we only advertise when we really have them.
