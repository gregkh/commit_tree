dt-bindings: dp83867: Convert fifo-depth to common fifo-depth and make optional

Convert the ti,fifo-depth from a TI specific property to the common
tx-fifo-depth property.  Also add support for the rx-fifo-depth.

These are optional properties for this device and if these are not
available then the fifo depths are set to device default values.
