RDMA/core: Trace points for diagnosing completion queue issues

Sample trace events:

Several features to note in this output:
 - The WCE count and context type are reported at allocation time
 - The CPU and kworker for each CQ is evident
 - The CQ's restracker ID is tagged on each trace event
 - CQ poll scheduling latency is measured
 - Details about how often single completions occur versus multiple
   completions are evident
 - The cost of the ULP's completion handler is recorded
