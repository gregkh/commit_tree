gpiolib: acpi: Add quirk to ignore EC wakeups on HP x2 10 BYT + AXP288 model

Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
quirk mechanism") was added to deal with spurious wakeups on one specific
model of the HP x2 10 series. In the mean time I have learned that there
are at least 3 different HP x2 10 models:

Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC

And the original quirk is only correct for (and only matches the)
Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC model.

The Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC model has different DMI strings, has
the external EC interrupt on a different GPIO pin and only needs to ignore
wakeups on the EC interrupt, the INT0002 device works fine on this model.

This commit adds an extra DMI based quirk for the HP x2 10 BYT + AXP288
model, ignoring wakeups for ACPI GPIO events on the EC interrupt pin
on this model. This fixes spurious wakeups from suspend on this model.
