drm/amd/display: Add delay after h' watchdog timeout event

[WHY]
Some monitors trigger HDCP2.x timeout after reinitializing (e.g. toggling HDR)
by taking longer than expected to return h' (h prime)
Previously the 200ms watchdog timer retry count would hit
MAX_NUM_OF_ATTEMPTS (4), causing fallback to HDCP1.x

[HOW]
Adding a 1s delay after an h' watchdog timeout provides enough time
for affected monitors to return h' in time without hitting MAX_NUM_OF_ATTEMPTS
