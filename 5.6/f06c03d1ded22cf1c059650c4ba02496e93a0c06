dm thin: change data device's flush_bio to be member of struct pool

With commit fe64369163c5 ("dm thin: don't allow changing data device
during thin-pool load") it is now possible to re-parent the data
device's flush_bio from the pool_c to pool structure.  Doing so offers
improved lifetime guarantees for the flush_bio so that the call to
dm_pool_register_pre_commit_callback can now be done safely from
pool_ctr().
