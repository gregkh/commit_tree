mm, memcg: fix corruption on 64-bit divisor in memory.high throttling

Commit 0e4b01df8659 had a bunch of fixups to use the right division
method.  However, it seems that after all that it still wasn't right --
div_u64 takes a 32-bit divisor.

The headroom is still large (2^32 pages), so on mundane systems you
won't hit this, but this should definitely be fixed.
