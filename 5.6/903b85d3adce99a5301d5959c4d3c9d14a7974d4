net: hns3: fix RMW issue for VLAN filter switch

According to the user manual, the ingress and egress VLAN filter
are configured at the same time. Currently, hclge_init_vlan_config()
and hclge_set_vlan_spoofchk() will both change the VLAN filter
switch. So it's necessary to read the old configuration before
modifying it.
