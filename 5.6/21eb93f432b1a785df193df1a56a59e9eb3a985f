driver core: Call sync_state() even if supplier has no consumers

The initial patch that added sync_state() support didn't handle the case
where a supplier has no consumers. This was because when a device is
successfully bound with a driver, only its suppliers were checked to see
if they are eligible to get a sync_state(). This is not sufficient for
devices that have no consumers but still need to do device state clean
up. So fix this.
