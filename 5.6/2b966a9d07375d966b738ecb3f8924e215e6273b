dt-bindings: Create DT bindings for SATA controllers

I need to create subnodes for drives connected to SATA
host controllers, and this needs to be supported
generally, so create a common YAML binding for
"sata" that will support subnodes with ports.

This has been designed as a subset of
ata/ahci-platform.txt with the bare essentials and
should be possible to extend or superset to cover the
common bindings.
