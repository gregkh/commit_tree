drm/i915/gt: Schedule request retirement when signaler idles

Very similar to commit 4f88f8747fa4 ("drm/i915/gt: Schedule request
retirement when timeline idles"), but this time instead of coupling into
the execlists CS event interrupt, we couple into the breadcrumb
interrupt and queue a timeline's retirement when the last signaler is
completed. This should allow us to more rapidly park ringbuffer
submission, and so help reduce power consumption on older systems.

v2: Fixup intel_engine_add_retire() to handle concurrent callers
