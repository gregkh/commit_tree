mm/memory_hotplug: pass in nid to online_pages()

Patch series "mm/memory_hotplug: pass in nid to online_pages()".

Simplify onlining code and get rid of find_memory_block().  Pass in the
nid from the memory block we are trying to online directly, instead of
manually looking it up.

This patch (of 2):

No need to lookup the memory block, we can directly pass in the nid.
