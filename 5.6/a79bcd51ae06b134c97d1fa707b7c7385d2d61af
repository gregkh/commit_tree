pinctrl: aspeed: Add ASPEED_SB_PINCONF() helper

This helper macro is for declaring single bit (SB) mask pinconf,
and is used to prepare for modifying aspeed_pin_config
structure, the aspeed_pin_config structure @bit variable will be
modified to @mask.

This case is common in the AST2400/AST2500 which the mask is a single bit.
