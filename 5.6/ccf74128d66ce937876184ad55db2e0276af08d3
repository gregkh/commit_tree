sched/topology: Assert non-NUMA topology masks don't (partially) overlap

topology.c::get_group() relies on the assumption that non-NUMA domains do
not partially overlap. Zeng Tao pointed out in [1] that such topology
descriptions, while completely bogus, can end up being exposed to the
scheduler.

In his example (8 CPUs, 2-node system), we end up with:
  MC span for CPU3 == 3-7
  MC span for CPU4 == 4-7

The first pass through get_group(3, sdd@MC) will result in the following
sched_group list:

  3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
  ^                  /
   `----------------'

And a later pass through get_group(4, sdd@MC) will "corrupt" that to:

  3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
       ^             /
	`-----------'

which will completely break things like 'while (sg != sd->groups)' when
using CPU3's base sched_domain.

There already are some architecture-specific checks in place such as
x86/kernel/smpboot.c::topology.sane(), but this is something we can detect
in the core scheduler, so it seems worthwhile to do so.

Warn and abort the construction of the sched domains if such a broken
topology description is detected. Note that this is somewhat
expensive (O(t.cÂ²), 't' non-NUMA topology levels and 'c' CPUs) and could be
gated under SCHED_DEBUG if deemed necessary.

Testing
=======

Dietmar managed to reproduce this using the following qemu incantation:

  $ qemu-system-aarch64 -kernel ./Image -hda ./qemu-image-aarch64.img \
  -append 'root=/dev/vda console=ttyAMA0 loglevel=8 sched_debug' -smp \
  cores=8 --nographic -m 512 -cpu cortex-a53 -machine virt -numa \
  node,cpus=0-2,nodeid=0 -numa node,cpus=3-7,nodeid=1

alongside the following drivers/base/arch_topology.c hack (AIUI wouldn't be
needed if '-smp cores=X, sockets=Y' would work with qemu):
