rcu: Remove kfree_rcu() special casing and lazy-callback handling

This commit removes kfree_rcu() special-casing and the lazy-callback
handling from Tree RCU.  It moves some of this special casing to Tiny RCU,
the removal of which will be the subject of later commits.

This results in a nice negative delta.
