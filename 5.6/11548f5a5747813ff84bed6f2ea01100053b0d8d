crypto: ccp - set max RSA modulus size for v3 platform devices as well

AMD Seattle incorporates a non-PCI version of the v3 CCP crypto
accelerator, and this version was left behind when the maximum
RSA modulus size was parameterized in order to support v5 hardware
which supports larger moduli than v3 hardware does. Due to this
oversight, RSA acceleration no longer works at all on these systems.

Fix this by setting the .rsamax property to the appropriate value
for v3 platform hardware.
