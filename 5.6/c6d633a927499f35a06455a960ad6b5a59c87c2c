crypto: algapi - make unregistration functions return void

Some of the algorithm unregistration functions return -ENOENT when asked
to unregister a non-registered algorithm, while others always return 0
or always return void.  But no users check the return value, except for
two of the bulk unregistration functions which print a message on error
but still always return 0 to their caller, and crypto_del_alg() which
calls crypto_unregister_instance() which always returns 0.

Since unregistering a non-registered algorithm is always a kernel bug
but there isn't anything callers should do to handle this situation at
runtime, let's simplify things by making all the unregistration
functions return void, and moving the error message into
crypto_unregister_alg() and upgrading it to a WARN().
