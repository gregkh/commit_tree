libbpf: Add support for program extensions

Add minimal support for program extensions. bpf_object_open_opts() needs to be
called with attach_prog_fd = target_prog_fd and BPF program extension needs to
have in .c file section definition like SEC("freplace/func_to_be_replaced").
libbpf will search for "func_to_be_replaced" in the target_prog_fd's BTF and
will pass it in attach_btf_id to the kernel. This approach works for tests, but
more compex use case may need to request function name (and attach_btf_id that
kernel sees) to be more dynamic. Such API will be added in future patches.
