scsi: qla2xxx: Fix unbound NVME response length

On certain cases when response length is less than 32, NVME response data
is supplied inline in IOCB. This is indicated by some combination of state
flags. There was an instance when a high, and incorrect, response length
was indicated causing driver to overrun buffers. Fix this by checking and
limiting the response payload length.
