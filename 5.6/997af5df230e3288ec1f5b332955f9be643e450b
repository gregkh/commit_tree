qed: FW 8.42.2.0 Additional ll2 type

LL2 queues were a limited resource due to FW constraints.
This FW introduced a new resource which is a context based ll2 queue
(memory on host). The additional ll2 queues are required for RDMA SRIOV.
The code refers to the previous ll2 queues as ram-based or legacy, and the
new queues as ctx-based.
This change decreased the "legacy" ram-based queues therefore the first ll2
queue used for iWARP was converted to the ctx-based ll2 queue.
This feature also exposed a bug in the DIRECT_REG_WR64 macro implementation
which didn't have an effect in other use cases.
