bootconfig: Fix CONFIG_BOOTTIME_TRACING dependency issue

Since commit d8a953ddde5e ("bootconfig: Set CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG=n by
default") also changed the CONFIG_BOOTTIME_TRACING to select
CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG to show the boot-time tracing on the menu,
it introduced wrong dependencies with BLK_DEV_INITRD as below.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for BOOT_CONFIG
  Depends on [n]: BLK_DEV_INITRD [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - BOOTTIME_TRACING [=y] && TRACING_SUPPORT [=y] && FTRACE [=y] && TRACING [=y]

This makes the CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG selects CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD to
fix this error and make CONFIG_BOOTTIME_TRACING=n by default, so
that both boot-time tracing and boot configuration off but those
appear on the menu list.
