netfilter: conntrack: split resolve_clash function

Followup patch will need a helper function with the 'clashing entries
refer to the identical tuple in both directions' resolution logic.

This patch will add another resolve_clash helper where loser_ct must
not be added to the dying list because it will be inserted into the
table.

Therefore this also moves the stat counters and dying-list insertion
of the losing ct.
