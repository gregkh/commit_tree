qmi_wwan: unconditionally reject 2 ep interfaces

We have been using the fact that the QMI and DIAG functions
usually are the only ones with class/subclass/protocol being
ff/ff/ff on Quectel modems. This has allowed us to match the
QMI function without knowing the exact interface number,
which can vary depending on firmware configuration.

The ability to silently reject the DIAG function, which is
usually handled by the option driver, is important for this
method to work.  This is done based on the knowledge that it
has exactly 2 bulk endpoints.  QMI function control interfaces
will have either 3 or 1 endpoint. This rule is universal so
the quirk condition can be removed.

The fixed layouts known from the Gobi1k and Gobi2k modems
have been gradually replaced by more dynamic layouts, and
many vendors now use configurable layouts without changing
device IDs.  Renaming the class/subclass/protocol matching
macro makes it more obvious that this is now not Quectel
specific anymore.
