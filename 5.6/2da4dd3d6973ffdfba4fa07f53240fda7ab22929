perf intel-pt: Fix endless record after being terminated

In __cmd_record(), when receiving SIGINT(ctrl + c), a 'done' flag will
be set and the event list will be disabled by evlist__disable() once.

While in auxtrace_record.read_finish(), the related events will be
enabled again, if they are continuous, the recording seems to be endless.

If the intel_pt event is disabled, we don't enable it again here.

Before the patch:

  huawei@huawei-2288H-V5:~/linux-5.5-rc4/tools/perf$ ./perf record -e \
  intel_pt//u -p 46803
  ^C^C^C^C^C^C

After the patch:

  huawei@huawei-2288H-V5:~/linux-5.5-rc4/tools/perf$ ./perf record -e \
  intel_pt//u -p 48591
  ^C[ perf record: Woken up 0 times to write data ]
  Warning:
  AUX data lost 504 times out of 4816!

  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 2024.405 MB perf.data ]
