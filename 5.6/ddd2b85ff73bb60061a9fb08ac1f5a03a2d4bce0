afs: Use kfree_rcu() instead of casting kfree() to rcu_callback_t

afs_put_addrlist() casts kfree() to rcu_callback_t. Apart from being wrong
in theory, this might also blow up when people start enforcing function
types via compiler instrumentation, and it means the rcu_head has to be
first in struct afs_addr_list.

Use kfree_rcu() instead, it's simpler and more correct.
