libbpf: Remove BPF_EMBED_OBJ macro from libbpf.h

Drop BPF_EMBED_OBJ and struct bpf_embed_data now that skeleton automatically
embeds contents of its source object file. While BPF_EMBED_OBJ is useful
independently of skeleton, we are currently don't have any use cases utilizing
it, so let's remove them until/if we need it.
