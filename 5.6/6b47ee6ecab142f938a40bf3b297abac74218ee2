io_uring: optimise sqe-to-req flags translation

For each IOSQE_* flag there is a corresponding REQ_F_* flag. And there
is a repetitive pattern of their translation:
e.g. if (sqe->flags & SQE_FLAG*) req->flags |= REQ_F_FLAG*

Use same numeric values/bits for them and copy instead of manual
handling.
