ipv4: Handle route deletion notification

When a route is deleted we potentially need to promote the next route in
the FIB alias list (e.g., with an higher metric). In case we find such a
route, a replace notification is emitted. Otherwise, a delete
notification for the deleted route.

v2:
* Convert to use fib_find_alias() instead of fib_find_first_alias()
