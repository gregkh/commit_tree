clk: qcom: mmcc8974: move gfx3d_clk_src from the mmcc to rpm

gfx3d_clk_src for msm8974 was introduced into the MMCC by
commit d8b212014e69 ("clk: qcom: Add support for MSM8974's multimedia
clock controller (MMCC)") to ensure that all of the clocks for
this platform are documented upstream. This clock actually belongs
on the RPM. Since then, commit 685dc94b7d8f ("clk: qcom: smd-rpmcc:
Add msm8974 clocks") was introduced, which contains the proper
definition for gfx3d_clk_src. Let's drop the definition from the
mmcc and register the clock with the rpm instead.

This change was tested on a Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone.
