io_uring: add ->show_fdinfo() for the io_uring file descriptor

It can be hard to know exactly what is registered with the ring.
Especially for credentials, it'd be handy to be able to see which
ones are registered, what personalities they have, and what the ID
of each of them is.

This adds support for showing information registered in the ring from
the fdinfo of the io_uring fd. Here's an example from a test case that
registers 4 files (two of them sparse), 4 buffers, and 2 personalities:

pos:	0
flags:	02000002
mnt_id:	14
UserFiles:	4
    0: file-no-1
    1: file-no-2
    2: <none>
    3: <none>
UserBufs:	4
    0: 0x563817c46000/128
    1: 0x563817c47000/256
    2: 0x563817c48000/512
    3: 0x563817c49000/1024
Personalities:
    1
	Uid:	0		0		0		0
	Gid:	0		0		0		0
	Groups:	0
	CapEff:	0000003fffffffff
    2
	Uid:	0		0		0		0
	Gid:	0		0		0		0
	Groups:	0
	CapEff:	0000003fffffffff
