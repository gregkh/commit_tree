btrfs: sysfs: make UUID/debug have its own kobject

Btrfs only allowed attributes to be exposed in debug/. Let's let other
groups be created by making debug its own kobject.

This also makes the per-fs debug options separate from the global
features mount attributes. This seems to be needed as
sysfs_create_files() requires const struct attribute * while
sysfs_create_group() can take struct attribute *. This seems nicer as
per file system, you'll probably use to_fs_info().
