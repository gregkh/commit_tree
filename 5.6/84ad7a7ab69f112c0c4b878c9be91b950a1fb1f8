bpf: Allow BTF ctx access for string pointers

When accessing the context we allow access to arguments with
scalar type and pointer to struct. But we deny access for
pointer to scalar type, which is the case for many functions.

Alexei suggested to take conservative approach and allow
currently only string pointer access, which is the case
for most functions now:

Adding check if the pointer is to string type and allow access to it.
