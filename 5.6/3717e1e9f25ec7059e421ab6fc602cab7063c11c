rcu: Clear ->rcu_read_unlock_special only once

In rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_irqrestore(), ->rcu_read_unlock_special is
cleared one piece at a time.  Given that the "if" statements in this
function use the copy in "special", this commit removes the clearing
of the individual pieces in favor of clearing ->rcu_read_unlock_special
in one go just after it has been determined to be non-zero.
