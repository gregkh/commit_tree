ath10k: Correct the DMA direction for management tx buffers

The management packets, send to firmware via WMI, are
mapped using the direction DMA_TO_DEVICE. Currently in
case of wmi cleanup, these buffers are being unmapped
using an incorrect DMA direction. This can cause unwanted
behavior when the host driver is handling a restart
of the wlan firmware.

We might see a trace like below

Fix the incorrect DMA direction during the wmi
management tx buffer cleanup.
