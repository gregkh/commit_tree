media: uvcvideo: Add a quirk to force GEO GC6500 Camera bits-per-pixel value

This device does not function correctly in raw mode in kernel
versions validating buffer sizes in bulk mode. It erroneously
announces 16 bits per pixel instead of 12 for NV12 format, so it
needs this quirk to fix computed frame size and avoid legitimate
frames getting discarded.
