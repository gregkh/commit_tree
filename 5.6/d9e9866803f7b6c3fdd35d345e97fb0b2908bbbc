ext2: Adjust indentation in ext2_fill_super

Clang warns:

../fs/ext2/super.c:1076:3: warning: misleading indentation; statement is
not part of the previous 'if' [-Wmisleading-indentation]
        sbi->s_groups_count = ((le32_to_cpu(es->s_blocks_count) -
        ^
../fs/ext2/super.c:1074:2: note: previous statement is here
        if (EXT2_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb) == 0)
        ^
1 warning generated.

This warning occurs because there is a space before the tab on this
line. Remove it so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux
kernel coding style and clang no longer warns.
