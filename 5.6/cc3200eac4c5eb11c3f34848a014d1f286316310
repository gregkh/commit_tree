blk-mq: insert flush request to the front of dispatch queue

commit 01e99aeca397 ("blk-mq: insert passthrough request into
hctx->dispatch directly") may change to add flush request to the tail
of dispatch by applying the 'add_head' parameter of
blk_mq_sched_insert_request.

Turns out this way causes performance regression on NCQ controller because
flush is non-NCQ command, which can't be queued when there is any in-flight
NCQ command. When adding flush rq to the front of hctx->dispatch, it is
easier to introduce extra time to flush rq's latency compared with adding
to the tail of dispatch queue because of S_SCHED_RESTART, then chance of
flush merge is increased, and less flush requests may be issued to
controller.

So always insert flush request to the front of dispatch queue just like
before applying commit 01e99aeca397 ("blk-mq: insert passthrough request
into hctx->dispatch directly").
