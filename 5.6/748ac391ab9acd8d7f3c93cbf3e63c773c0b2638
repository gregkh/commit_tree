pci/hotplug/pnv-php: Wrap warnings in macro

An opencapi slot doesn't have an associated bridge device. It's not
needed for operation, but any warning is displayed through pci_warn()
which uses the pci_dev struct of the assocated bridge device. So wrap
those warning so that a different trace mechanism can be used if it's
an opencapi slot.
