Documentation: convert nfs.txt to ReST

This patch converts nfs.txt to RST. It also moves it to admin-guide.
The reason for moving it is because this document contains information
useful for system administrators, as noted on the following paragraph:

'The purpose of this document is to provide information on some of the
special features of the NFS client that can be configured by system
administrators'.
