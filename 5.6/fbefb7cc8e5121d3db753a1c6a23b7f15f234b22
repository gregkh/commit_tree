clk: qcom: apcs-msm8916: use clk_parent_data to specify the parent

Allow accessing the parent clock names required for the driver operation
by using the device tree 'clock-names' property, while falling back to
the previous method of using names in the global name space.

This permits extending the driver to other platforms without having to
modify its source code.
