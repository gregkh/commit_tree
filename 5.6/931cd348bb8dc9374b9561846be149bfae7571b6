drm/i915: Skip rotated offset adjustment for unsupported modifiers

During framebuffer creation, we pre-compute offsets for 90/270 plane
rotation. However, only Y and Yf modifiers support 90/270 rotation. So,
skip the calculations for other modifiers.

To keep the gem buffer size check still working for tiled planes, factor
out the logic needed for rotation setup and skip only this part for
tiled planes other than Y/Yf.

v2: Add a bounds check WARN for the rotation info array.
v3: Keep the gem buffer size check working for tiled planes.
