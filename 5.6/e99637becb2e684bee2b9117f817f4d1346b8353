rcu: Add support for debug_objects debugging for kfree_rcu()

This commit applies RCU's debug_objects debugging to the new batched
kfree_rcu() implementations.  The object is queued at the kfree_rcu()
call and dequeued during reclaim.

Tested that enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_RCU_HEAD successfully detects
double kfree_rcu() calls.
