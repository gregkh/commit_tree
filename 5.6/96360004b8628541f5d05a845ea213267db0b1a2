xdp: Make devmap flush_list common for all map instances

The devmap flush list is used to track entries that need to flushed
from via the xdp_do_flush_map() function. This list used to be
per-map, but there is really no reason for that. Instead make the
flush list global for all devmaps, which simplifies __dev_map_flush()
and dev_map_init_map().
