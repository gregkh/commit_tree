tools/bpf: Add self tests for bpf_send_signal_thread()

The test_progs send_signal() is amended to test
bpf_send_signal_thread() as well.

   $ ./test_progs -n 40
   #40/1 send_signal_tracepoint:OK
   #40/2 send_signal_perf:OK
   #40/3 send_signal_nmi:OK
   #40/4 send_signal_tracepoint_thread:OK
   #40/5 send_signal_perf_thread:OK
   #40/6 send_signal_nmi_thread:OK
   #40 send_signal:OK
   Summary: 1/6 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 0 FAILED

Also took this opportunity to rewrite the send_signal test
using skeleton framework and array mmap to make code
simpler and more readable.
