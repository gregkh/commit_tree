drm/i915/dsi: Move Crystal Cove PMIC panel GPIO lookup from mfd to the i915 driver

Move the Crystal Cove PMIC panel GPIO lookup-table from
drivers/mfd/intel_soc_pmic_core.c to the i915 driver.

The moved looked-up table is adding a GPIO lookup to the i915 PCI
device and the GPIO subsys allows only one lookup table per device,

The intel_soc_pmic_core.c code only adds lookup-table entries for the
PMIC panel GPIO (as it deals only with the PMIC), but we also need to be
able to access some GPIOs on the SoC itself, which requires entries for
these GPIOs in the lookup-table.

Since the lookup-table is attached to the i915 PCI device it really
should be part of the i915 driver, this will also allow us to extend
it with GPIOs from other sources when necessary.
