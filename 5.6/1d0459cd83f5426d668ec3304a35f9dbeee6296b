crypto: cmac - use crypto_grab_cipher() and simplify error paths

Make the cmac template use the new function crypto_grab_cipher() to
initialize its cipher spawn.

This is needed to make all spawns be initialized in a consistent way.

This required making cmac_create() allocate the instance directly rather
than use shash_alloc_instance().

Also simplify the error handling by taking advantage of crypto_drop_*()
now accepting (as a no-op) spawns that haven't been initialized yet, and
by taking advantage of crypto_grab_*() now handling ERR_PTR() names.
