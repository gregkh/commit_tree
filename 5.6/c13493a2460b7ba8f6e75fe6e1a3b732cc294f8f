ASoC: soc-core: support snd_soc_dai_link_component for codec_conf

To find codec_conf component, it is using dev_name, of_node.
But, we already has this kind of finding component method by
snd_soc_dai_link_component, and snd_soc_is_matching_component().
We shouldn't have duplicate implementation to do same things.
This patch adds snd_soc_dai_link_component support to find
codec_conf component.
