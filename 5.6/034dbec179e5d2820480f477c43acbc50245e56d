platform/chrome: cros_ec: Match implementation with headers

The 'cros_ec' core driver is the common interface for the cros_ec
transport drivers to do the shared operations to register, unregister,
suspend, resume and handle_event. The interface is provided by including
the header 'include/linux/platform_data/cros_ec_proto.h', however, instead
of have the implementation of these functions in cros_ec_proto.c, it is in
'cros_ec.c', which is a different kernel module. Apart from being a bad
practice, this can induce confusions allowing the users of the cros_ec
protocol to call these functions.

The register, unregister, suspend, resume and handle_event functions
*should* only be called by the different transport drivers (i2c, spi, lpc,
etc.), so make this a bit less confusing by moving these functions from
the public in-kernel space to a private include in platform/chrome, and
then, the interface for cros_ec module and for the cros_ec_proto module is
clean.
