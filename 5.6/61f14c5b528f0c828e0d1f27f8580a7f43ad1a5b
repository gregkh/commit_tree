drm/amd/display: Disable link before reenable

[Why]
Black screen seen after display is disabled then re-enabled.
Caused by difference in link settings when
switching between different resolutions.

[How]
In PnP case, or whenever the display is
still enabled but the driver is unloaded,
disable link before re-enabling with new link settings.
