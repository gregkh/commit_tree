efi/x86: Map the entire EFI vendor string before copying it

Fix a couple of issues with the way we map and copy the vendor string:
- we map only 2 bytes, which usually works since you get at least a
  page, but if the vendor string happens to cross a page boundary,
  a crash will result
- only call early_memunmap() if early_memremap() succeeded, or we will
  call it with a NULL address which it doesn't like,
- while at it, switch to early_memremap_ro(), and array indexing rather
  than pointer dereferencing to read the CHAR16 characters.
