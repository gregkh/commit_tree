libbpf: Support flexible arrays in CO-RE

Some data stuctures in kernel are defined with either zero-sized array or
flexible (dimensionless) array at the end of a struct. Actual data of such
array follows in memory immediately after the end of that struct, forming its
variable-sized "body" of elements. Support such access pattern in CO-RE
relocation handling.
