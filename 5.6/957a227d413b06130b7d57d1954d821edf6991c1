x86/boot: Fix a comment's incorrect file reference

Fix the comment for 'struct real_mode_header' to reference the correct
assembly file, realmode/rm/header.S.  The comment has always incorrectly
referenced realmode.S, which doesn't exist, as defining the associated
asm blob.

Specify the file's path relative to arch/x86 to avoid confusion with
boot/header.S.  Update the comment for 'struct trampoline_header' to
also include the relative path to keep things consistent, and tweak the
dual 64/32 reference so that it doesn't appear to be an extension of the
relative path, i.e. avoid "realmode/rm/trampoline_32/64.S".
