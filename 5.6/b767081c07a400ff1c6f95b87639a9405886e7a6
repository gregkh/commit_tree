lib/vdso: Remove VDSO_HAS_32BIT_FALLBACK

VDSO_HAS_32BIT_FALLBACK was introduced to address a regression which
caused seccomp to deny access to the applications to clock_gettime64()
and clock_getres64() because they are not enabled in the existing
filters.

The purpose of VDSO_HAS_32BIT_FALLBACK was to simplify the conditional
implementation of __cvdso_clock_get*time32() variants.

Now that all the architectures that support the generic vDSO library
have been converted to support the 32 bit fallbacks the conditional
can be removed.
