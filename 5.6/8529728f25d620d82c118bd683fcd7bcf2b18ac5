arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Fixup uart3 gpio config for bluetooth

It turns out that the wcn3990 can float the gpio lines during bootup, etc
which will result in the uart core thinking there is incoming data.  This
results in the bluetooth stack getting garbage.  By applying a bias to
match what wcn3990 would drive, the issue is corrected.
