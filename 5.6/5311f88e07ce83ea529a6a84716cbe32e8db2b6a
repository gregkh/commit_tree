usb: mtk-xhci: Do not explicitly set the DMA mask

The mtk-xhci platform glue sets the DMA mask to 32 bits on its own,
which was needed before commit fda182d80a0b ("usb: xhci: configure
32-bit DMA if the controller does not support 64-bit DMA"), but now it
has no effect, because xhci_gen_setup() sets it up for us according to
hardware capabilities. Remove the useless code.
