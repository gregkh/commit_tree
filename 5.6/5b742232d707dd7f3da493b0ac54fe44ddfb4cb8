mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: update tuning erratum A-008171

There is an official update for eSDHC tuning erratum A-008171.
This patch is to implement the changes,
- Affect all revisions of SoC.
- Changes for tuning window checking.
- Hardware hits a new condition that tuning succeeds although
  the eSDHC might not have tuned properly for type2 SoCs
  (soc_tuning_erratum_type2[] array in driver). So check
  tuning window after tuning succeeds.
