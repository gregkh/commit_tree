x86/vdso: Provide vdso_data offset on vvar_page

VDSO support for time namespaces needs to set up a page with the same
layout as VVAR. That timens page will be placed on position of VVAR page
inside namespace. That page has vdso_data->seq set to 1 to enforce
the slow path and vdso_data->clock_mode set to VCLOCK_TIMENS to enforce
the time namespace handling path.

To prepare the time namespace page the kernel needs to know the vdso_data
offset.  Provide arch_get_vdso_data() helper for locating vdso_data on VVAR
page.
