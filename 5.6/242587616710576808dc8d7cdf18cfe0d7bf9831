gpiolib: Add support for the irqdomain which doesn't use irq_fwspec as arg

Some gpio's parent irqdomain may not use the struct irq_fwspec as
argument, such as msi irqdomain. So rename the callback
populate_parent_fwspec() to populate_parent_alloc_arg() and make it
allocate and populate the specific struct which is needed by the
parent irqdomain.
