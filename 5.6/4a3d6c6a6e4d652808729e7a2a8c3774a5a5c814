libbpf: Reduce log level for custom section names

Libbpf is trying to recognize BPF program type based on its section name
during bpf_object__open() phase. This is not strictly enforced and user code
has ability to specify/override correct BPF program type after open.  But if
BPF program is using custom section name, libbpf will still emit warnings,
which can be quite annoying to users. This patch reduces log level of
information messages emitted by libbpf if section name is not canonical. User
can still get a list of all supported section names as debug-level message.
