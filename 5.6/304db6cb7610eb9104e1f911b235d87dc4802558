page_pool: refill page when alloc.count of pool is zero

"do {} while" in page_pool_refill_alloc_cache will always
refill page once whether refill is true or false, and whether
alloc.count of pool is less than PP_ALLOC_CACHE_REFILL or not
this is wrong, and will cause overflow of pool->alloc.cache

the caller of __page_pool_get_cached should provide guarantee
that pool->alloc.cache is safe to access, so in_serving_softirq
should be removed as suggested by Jesper Dangaard Brouer in
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1233713/

so fix this issue by calling page_pool_refill_alloc_cache()
only when pool->alloc.count is zero
