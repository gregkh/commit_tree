nfsd: make 'boot_time' 64-bit wide

The local boot time variable gets truncated to time_t at the moment,
which can lead to slightly odd behavior on 32-bit architectures.

Use ktime_get_real_seconds() instead of get_seconds() to always
get a 64-bit result, and keep it that way wherever possible.

It still gets truncated in a few places:

- When assigning to cl_clientid.cl_boot, this is already documented
  and is only used as a unique identifier.

- In clients_still_reclaiming(), the truncation is to 'unsigned long'
  in order to use the 'time_before() helper.
