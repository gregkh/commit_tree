PM / devfreq: exynos-ppmu: Fix excessive stack usage

Putting a 'struct devfreq_event_dev' object on the stack is generally
a bad idea and here it leads to a warnig about potential stack overflow:

drivers/devfreq/event/exynos-ppmu.c:643:12: error: stack frame size of 1040 bytes in function 'exynos_ppmu_probe' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than=]

There is no real need for the device structure, only the string inside
it, so add an internal helper function that simply takes the string
as its argument and remove the device structure.
