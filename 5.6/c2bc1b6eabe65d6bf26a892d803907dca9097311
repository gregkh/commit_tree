drm/dp_mst: Add helpers for MST DSC and virtual DPCD aux

Add drm_dp_mst_dsc_aux_for_port. To enable DSC, the DSC_ENABLED
register might have to be written on the leaf port's DPCD,
its parent's DPCD, or the MST manager's DPCD. This function
finds the correct aux for the job.

As part of this, add drm_dp_mst_is_virtual_dpcd. Virtual DPCD
is a DP feature new in DP v1.4, which exposes certain DPCD
registers on virtual ports.

v2: Remember to unlock mutex on all paths
v3: Refactor to match coding style and increase brevity
v4: - Check DSC capable MST sink connected directly to the device.
    - Check branch's port_parent to be set
