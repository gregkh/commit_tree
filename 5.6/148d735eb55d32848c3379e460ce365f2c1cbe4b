KVM: nVMX: Use correct root level for nested EPT shadow page tables

Hardcode the EPT page-walk level for L2 to be 4 levels, as KVM's MMU
currently also hardcodes the page walk level for nested EPT to be 4
levels.  The L2 guest is all but guaranteed to soft hang on its first
instruction when L1 is using EPT, as KVM will construct 4-level page
tables and then tell hardware to use 5-level page tables.

Fixes: 855feb673640 ("KVM: MMU: Add 5 level EPT & Shadow page table support.")
