ALSA: usb-audio: Add clock validity quirk for Denon MC7000/MCX8000

It should be safe to ignore clock validity check result if the following
conditions are met:
 - only one single sample rate is supported;
 - the terminal is directly connected to the clock source;
 - the clock type is internal.

This is to deal with some Denon DJ controllers that always reports that
clock is invalid.
