rcu: Move gp_state_names[] and gp_state_getname() to tree_stall.h

Only tree_stall.h needs to get name from GP state, so this commit
moves the gp_state_names[] array and the gp_state_getname()
from kernel/rcu/tree.h and kernel/rcu/tree.c, respectively, to
kernel/rcu/tree_stall.h.  While moving gp_state_names[], this commit
uses the GCC syntax to ensure that the right string is associated with
the right CPP macro.
