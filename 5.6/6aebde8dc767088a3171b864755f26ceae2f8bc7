qed: FW 8.42.2.0 Expose new registers and change windows

This patch contains register initialization related changes.
- Modifications to the runtime offsets - these are defines used
  by the driver or firmware functions to set values that are used
  by the initialization functions to set device register values.
- Global window values changes to provide different device register
  ranges.
- Additional device registers addresses were added to the register file,
  used in later stages.
