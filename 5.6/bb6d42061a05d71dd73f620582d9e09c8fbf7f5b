media: sti: bdisp: fix a possible sleep-in-atomic-context bug in bdisp_device_run()

The driver may sleep while holding a spinlock.
The function call path (from bottom to top) in Linux 4.19 is:

drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-hw.c, 385:
    msleep in bdisp_hw_reset
drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-v4l2.c, 341:
    bdisp_hw_reset in bdisp_device_run
drivers/media/platform/sti/bdisp/bdisp-v4l2.c, 317:
    _raw_spin_lock_irqsave in bdisp_device_run

To fix this bug, msleep() is replaced with udelay().

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by myself.
