net: core: devlink.c: Use built-in RCU list checking

list_for_each_entry_rcu() has built-in RCU and lock checking.

Pass cond argument to list_for_each_entry_rcu() to silence
false lockdep warning when CONFIG_PROVE_RCU_LIST is enabled.

The devlink->lock is held when devlink_dpipe_table_find()
is called in non RCU read side section. Therefore, pass struct devlink
to devlink_dpipe_table_find() for lockdep checking.
