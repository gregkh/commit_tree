clk: qcom: Get rid of fallback global names for dispcc-sc7180

In the new world input clocks should be matched by ".fw_name".  sc7180
is new enough that no backward compatibility use of global names
should be needed.  Remove it.

With a proper device tree and downstream display patches I have
verified booting a sc7180 up and seeing the display after this patch.
