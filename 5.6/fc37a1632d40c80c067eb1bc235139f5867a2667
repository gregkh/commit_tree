powerpc: fix hardware PMU exception bug on PowerVM compatibility mode systems

PowerVM systems running compatibility mode on a few Power8 revisions are
still vulnerable to the hardware defect that loses PMU exceptions arriving
prior to a context switch.

The software fix for this issue is enabled through the CPU_FTR_PMAO_BUG
cpu_feature bit, nevertheless this bit also needs to be set for PowerVM
compatibility mode systems.
