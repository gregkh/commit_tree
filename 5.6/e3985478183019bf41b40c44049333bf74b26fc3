platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Create platform dependent bitmap structs

The current implementation of intel_pmc_core driver allows to reuse, but does
not reflect the exact number and names of IPs for a newer platform which
does not necessarily support all the IPs in the entries. The names and
number of these IPs might differ from its previous platforms. The number
of PCH IPs per platform is calculated based on PPFEAR_NUM_ENTRIES
defined, where each entry represents a bucket (8 bits). The platform can
support 'n' entries, but not necessarily all 'n * 8' IPs.

Create platform dependent bitmap structures to specify the exact number,
names of IPs while reusing the existing IPs.

The changes in this patch are preparatory to accommodate future SoCs
that might reuse the CNL/ICL PCH IPs, and to reflect the exact number of
IPs with its names.
