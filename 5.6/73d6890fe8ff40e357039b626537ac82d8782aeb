arm64: kernel: Correct annotation of end of el0_sync

Commit 582f95835a8fc812c ("arm64: entry: convert el0_sync to C") caused
the ENDPROC() annotating the end of el0_sync to be placed after the code
for el0_sync_compat. This replaced the previous annotation where it was
located after all the cases that are now converted to C, including after
the currently unannotated el0_irq_compat and el0_error_compat. Move the
annotation to the end of the function and add separate annotations for
the _compat ones.
