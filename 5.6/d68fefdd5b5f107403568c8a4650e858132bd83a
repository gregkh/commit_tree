tty/serial: Migrate 8250_fsl to use has_sysrq

The SUPPORT_SYSRQ ifdeffery is not nice as:
- May create misunderstanding about sizeof(struct uart_port) between
  different objects
- Prevents moving functions from serial_core.h
- Reduces readability (well, it's ifdeffery - it's hard to follow)

In order to remove SUPPORT_SYSRQ, has_sysrq variable has been added.
Initialise it in driver's probe and remove ifdeffery.

In contrast to 8250/8250_of, legacy_serial on powerpc does fill
(struct plat_serial8250_port). The reason is likely that it's done on
device_initcall(), not on probe. So, 8250_core is not yet probed.

Propagate value from platform_device on 8250 probe - in case powepc
legacy driver it's initialized on initcall, in case 8250_of it will be
initialized later on of_platform_serial_setup().
