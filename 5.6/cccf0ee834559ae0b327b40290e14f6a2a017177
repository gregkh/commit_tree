io_uring/io-wq: don't use static creds/mm assignments

We currently setup the io_wq with a static set of mm and creds. Even for
a single-use io-wq per io_uring, this is suboptimal as we have may have
multiple enters of the ring. For sharing the io-wq backend, it doesn't
work at all.

Switch to passing in the creds and mm when the work item is setup. This
means that async work is no longer deferred to the io_uring mm and creds,
it is done with the current mm and creds.

Flag this behavior with IORING_FEAT_CUR_PERSONALITY, so applications know
they can rely on the current personality (mm and creds) being the same
for direct issue and async issue.
