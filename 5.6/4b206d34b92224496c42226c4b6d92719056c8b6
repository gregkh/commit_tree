soundwire: intel: update stream callbacks for hwparams/free stream operations

The SoundWire DAIs for Intel platform are created in
drivers/soundwire/intel.c, while the communication with the Intel DSP
is all controlled in soc/sof/intel

When the DAI status changes, a callback is used to bridge the gap
between the two subsystems.

The naming of the existing 'config_stream' callback does not map well
with any of ALSA/ASoC concepts. This patch renames it as
'params_stream' to be more self-explanatory.

A new 'free_stream' callback is added in case any resources allocated
in the 'params_stream' stage need to be released. In the SOF
implementation, this is used in the hw_free case to release the DMA
channels over IPC.

These two callbacks now rely on structures which expose the link_id
and alh_stream_id (required by the firmware IPC), instead of a list of
parameters. The 'void *' definitions are changed to use explicit
types, as suggested on alsa-devel during earlier reviews.
