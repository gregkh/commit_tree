perf report/top: Make ENTER consistently bring up menu

When callchains are present the ENTER key switches from bringing up the
menu that offers Annotation, Zoom by DSO, etc to expanding/collapsing
one callchain level, causing confusion, fix it by making it consistently
bring up the menu and use '+' to expand/collapse one callchain level.

Next patch will also add an entry to the menu to allow
expanding/collapsing, so that people used to ENTER expanding one
callchain level can quickly find it and use it instead.
