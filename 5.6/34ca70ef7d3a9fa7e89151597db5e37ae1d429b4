sparc32: fix struct ipc64_perm type definition

As discussed in the strace issue tracker, it appears that the sparc32
sysvipc support has been broken for the past 11 years. It was however
working in compat mode, which is how it must have escaped most of the
regular testing.

The problem is that a cleanup patch inadvertently changed the uid/gid
fields in struct ipc64_perm from 32-bit types to 16-bit types in uapi
headers.

Both glibc and uclibc-ng still use the original types, so they should
work fine with compat mode, but not natively.  Change the definitions
to use __kernel_uid32_t and __kernel_gid32_t again.
