drm/i915/gt: Wait for new requests in intel_gt_retire_requests()

Our callers fall into two categories, those passing timeout=0 who just
want to flush request retirements and those passing a timeout that need
to wait for submission completion (e.g. intel_gt_wait_for_idle()).
Currently, we only wait for a snapshot of timelines at the start of the
wait (but there was an expectation that new requests would cause timelines
to appear at the end). However, our callers, such as
intel_gt_wait_for_idle() before suspend, do require us to wait for the
power management requests emitted by retirement as well. If we don't,
then it takes an extra second or two for the background worker to flush
the queue and mark the GT as idle.
