crypto: authencesn - use crypto_grab_ahash() and simplify error paths

Make the authencesn template use the new function crypto_grab_ahash() to
initialize its ahash spawn.

This is needed to make all spawns be initialized in a consistent way.

Also simplify the error handling by taking advantage of crypto_drop_*()
now accepting (as a no-op) spawns that haven't been initialized yet, and
by taking advantage of crypto_grab_*() now handling ERR_PTR() names.
