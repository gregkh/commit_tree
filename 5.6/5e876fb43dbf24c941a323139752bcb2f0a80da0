vfs, fdtable: Add fget_task helper

This introduces a function which can be used to fetch a file, given an
arbitrary task. As long as the user holds a reference (refcnt) to the
task_struct it is safe to call, and will either return NULL on failure,
or a pointer to the file, with a refcnt.

This patch is based on Oleg Nesterov's (cf. [1]) patch from September
2018.
