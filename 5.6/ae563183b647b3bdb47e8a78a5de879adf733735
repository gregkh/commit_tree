Bluetooth: hci_qca: Enable power off/on support during hci down/up for QCA Rome

This patch registers hdev->shutdown() callback and also sets
HCI_QUIRK_NON_PERSISTENT_SETUP for QCA Rome. It will power-off the BT chip
during hci down and power-on/initialize the chip again during hci up. As
wcn399x already enabled this, this patch also removed the callback register
and QUIRK setting in qca_setup() for wcn399x and uniformly do this in the
probe() routine.
