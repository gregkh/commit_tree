drm/i915/gt: Repeat wait_for_idle for retirement workers

Since we may retire timelines from secondary workers,
intel_gt_retire_requests() is not always a reliable indicator that all
pending retirements are complete. If we do detect secondary workers are
in progress, recommend intel_gt_wait_for_idle() to repeat the retirement
check.
