tracing: kprobes: Output kprobe event to printk buffer

Since kprobe-events use event_trigger_unlock_commit_regs() directly,
that events doesn't show up in printk buffer if "tp_printk" is set.

Use trace_event_buffer_commit() in kprobe events so that it can
invoke output_printk() as same as other trace events.
