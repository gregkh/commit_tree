crypto: omap-aes-gcm - use the AES library to encrypt the tag

The OMAP AES-GCM implementation uses a fallback ecb(aes) skcipher to
produce the keystream to encrypt the output tag. Let's use the new
AES library instead - this is much simpler, and shouldn't affect
performance given that it only involves a single block.
