taprio: Use taprio_reset_tc() to reset Traffic Classes configuration

When destroying the current taprio instance, which can happen when the
creation of one fails, we should reset the traffic class configuration
back to the default state.

netdev_reset_tc() is a better way because in addition to setting the
number of traffic classes to zero, it also resets the priority to
traffic classes mapping to the default value.
