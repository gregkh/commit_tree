fibmap: Reject negative block numbers

FIBMAP receives an integer from userspace which is then implicitly converted
into sector_t to be passed to bmap(). No check is made to ensure userspace
didn't send a negative block number, which can end up in an underflow, and
returning to userspace a corrupted block address.

As a side-effect, the underflow caused by a negative block here, will
trigger the WARN() in iomap_bmap_actor(), which is how this issue was
first discovered.
