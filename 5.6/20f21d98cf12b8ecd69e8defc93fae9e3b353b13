libbpf: Revert bpf_helper_defs.h inclusion regression

Revert bpf_helpers.h's change to include auto-generated bpf_helper_defs.h
through <> instead of "", which causes it to be searched in include path. This
can break existing applications that don't have their include path pointing
directly to where libbpf installs its headers.

There is ongoing work to make all (not just bpf_helper_defs.h) includes more
consistent across libbpf and its consumers, but this unbreaks user code as is
right now without any regressions. Selftests still behave sub-optimally
(taking bpf_helper_defs.h from libbpf's source directory, if it's present
there), which will be fixed in subsequent patches.
