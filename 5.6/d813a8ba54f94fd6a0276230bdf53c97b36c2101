KVM: x86: Move allocation of pio_data page down a few lines

Allocate the pio_data page after creating the MMU and local APIC so that
all direct memory allocations are grouped together.  This allows setting
the return value to -ENOMEM prior to starting the allocations instead of
setting it in the fail path for every allocation.

The pio_data page is only consumed when KVM_RUN is invoked, i.e. moving
its allocation has no real functional impact.
