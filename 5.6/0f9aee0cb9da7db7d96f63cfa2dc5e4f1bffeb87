powerpc/mm: Don't log user reads to 0xffffffff

Running vdsotest leaves many times the following log:

  [   79.629901] vdsotest[396]: User access of kernel address (ffffffff) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)

A pointer set to (-1) is likely a programming error similar to
a NULL pointer and is not worth logging as an exploit attempt.

Don't log user accesses to 0xffffffff.
