IB/hfi1: Fix logical condition in msix_request_irq

Clang warns:

drivers/infiniband/hw/hfi1/msix.c:136:22: warning: overlapping
comparisons always evaluate to false [-Wtautological-overlap-compare]
        if (type < IRQ_SDMA && type >= IRQ_OTHER)
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 warning generated.

It is impossible for something to be less than 0 (IRQ_SDMA) and greater
than or equal to 3 (IRQ_OTHER) at the same time. A logical OR should
have been used to keep the same logic as before.
