ovl: fix corner case of conflicting lower layer uuid

This fixes ovl_lower_uuid_ok() to correctly detect the corner case:
 - two filesystems, A and B, both have null uuid
 - upper layer is on A
 - lower layer 1 is also on A
 - lower layer 2 is on B

In this case, bad_uuid would not have been set for B, because the check
only involved the list of lower fs.  Hence we'll try to decode a layer 2
origin on layer 1 and fail.

We check for conflicting (and null) uuid among all lower layers, including
those layers that are on the same fs as the upper layer.
