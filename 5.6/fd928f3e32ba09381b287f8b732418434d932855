alarmtimer: Make alarmtimer_get_rtcdev() a stub when CONFIG_RTC_CLASS=n

The stubbed version of alarmtimer_get_rtcdev() is not exported.
so this won't work if this function is used in a module when
CONFIG_RTC_CLASS=n.

Move the stub function to the header file and make it inline so that
callers don't have to worry about linking against this symbol.

rtcdev isn't used outside of this ifdef so it's not required to be
redefined to NULL. Drop that while touching this area.
