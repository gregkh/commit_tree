ath10k: pci: Only dump ATH10K_MEM_REGION_TYPE_IOREG when safe

ath10k_pci_dump_memory_reg() will try to access memory of type
ATH10K_MEM_REGION_TYPE_IOREG however, if a hardware restart is in progress
this can crash a system.

Individual ioread32() time has been observed to jump from 15-20 ticks to >
80k ticks followed by a secure-watchdog bite and a system reset.

Work around this corner case by only issuing the read transaction when the
driver state is ATH10K_STATE_ON.

Tested-on: QCA9988 PCI 10.4-3.9.0.2-00044

Fixes: 219cc084c6706 ("ath10k: add memory dump support QCA9984")
