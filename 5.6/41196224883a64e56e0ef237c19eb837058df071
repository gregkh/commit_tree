powerpc/32s: Fix kasan_early_hash_table() for CONFIG_VMAP_STACK

On book3s/32 CPUs that are handling MMU through a hash table,
MMU_init_hw() function was adapted for VMAP_STACK in order to
handle virtual addresses instead of physical addresses in the
low level hash functions.

When using KASAN, the same adaptations are required for the
early hash table set up by kasan_early_hash_table() function.
