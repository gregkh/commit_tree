block: Allow t10-pi to be modular

Currently t10-pi can only be built into the block layer which via
crc-t10dif pulls in a whole chunk of the Crypto API.  In fact all
users of t10-pi work as modules and there is no reason for it to
always be built-in.

This patch adds a new hidden option for t10-pi that is selected
automatically based on BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY and whether the users
of t10-pi are built-in or not.
