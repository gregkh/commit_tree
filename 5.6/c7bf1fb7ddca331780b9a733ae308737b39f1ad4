libertas: don't exit from lbs_ibss_join_existing() with RCU read lock held

Commit e5e884b42639 ("libertas: Fix two buffer overflows at parsing bss
descriptor") introduced a bounds check on the number of supplied rates to
lbs_ibss_join_existing().

Unfortunately, it introduced a return path from within a RCU read side
critical section without a corresponding rcu_read_unlock(). Fix this.
