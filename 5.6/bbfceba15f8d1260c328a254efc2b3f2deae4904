kdb: Get rid of confusing diag msg from "rd" if current task has no regs

If you switch to a sleeping task with the "pid" command and then type
"rd", kdb tells you this:

  No current kdb registers.  You may need to select another task
  diag: -17: Invalid register name

The first message makes sense, but not the second.  Fix it by just
returning 0 after commands accessing the current registers finish if
we've already printed the "No current kdb registers" error.

While fixing kdb_rd(), change the function to use "if" rather than
"ifdef".  It cleans the function up a bit and any modern compiler will
have no trouble handling still producing good code.
