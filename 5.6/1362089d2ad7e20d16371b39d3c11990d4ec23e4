btrfs: Fix split-brain handling when changing FSID to metadata uuid

Current code doesn't correctly handle the situation which arises when
a file system that has METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT flag set and has its FSID
changed to the one in metadata uuid. This causes the incompat flag to
disappear.

In case of a power failure we could end up in a situation where part of
the disks in a multi-disk filesystem are correctly reverted to
METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT flag unset state, while others have
METADATA_UUID_INCOMPAT set and CHANGING_FSID_V2_IN_PROGRESS.

This patch corrects the behavior required to handle the case where a
disk of the second type is scanned first, creating the necessary
btrfs_fs_devices. Subsequently, when a disk which has already completed
the transition is scanned it should overwrite the data in
btrfs_fs_devices.
