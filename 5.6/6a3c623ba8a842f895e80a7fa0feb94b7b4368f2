KVM: X86: Drop x86_set_memory_region()

The helper x86_set_memory_region() is only used in vmx_set_tss_addr()
and kvm_arch_destroy_vm().  Push the lock upper in both cases.  With
that, drop x86_set_memory_region().

This prepares to allow __x86_set_memory_region() to return a HVA
mapped, because the HVA will need to be protected by the lock too even
after __x86_set_memory_region() returns.
