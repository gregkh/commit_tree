scsi: mpt3sas: renamed _base_after_reset_handler function

Renamed _base_after_reset_handler function to
_base_clear_outstanding_commands so that it can be used in multiple
scenarios with suitable name which matches with the operation it does.

Also renamed its child functions. No functional changes.
