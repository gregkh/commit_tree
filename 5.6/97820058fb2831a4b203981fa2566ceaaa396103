ceph: check availability of mds cluster on mount after wait timeout

If all the MDS daemons are down for some reason, then the first mount
attempt will fail with EIO after the mount request times out.  A mount
attempt will also fail with EIO if all of the MDS's are laggy.

This patch changes the code to return -EHOSTUNREACH in these situations
and adds a pr_info error message to help the admin determine the cause.
