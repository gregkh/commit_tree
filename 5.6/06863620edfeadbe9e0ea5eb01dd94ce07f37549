gpiolib: convert the type of hwnum to unsigned int in gpiochip_get_desc()

gpiochip_get_desc() takes a u16 hwnum, but it turns out most users don't
respect that and usually pass an unsigned int. Since implicit casting to
a smaller type is dangerous - let's change the type of hwnum to unsigned
int in gpiochip_get_desc() and in gpiochip_request_own_desc() where the
size of hwnum is not respected either and who's a user of the former.

This is safe as we then check the hwnum against the number of lines
before proceeding in gpiochip_get_desc().
