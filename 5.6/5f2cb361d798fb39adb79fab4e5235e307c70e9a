ALSA: hda: Unify get_response handling

Now most of the get_response handling became quite similar between
HDA-core and legacy drivers, and the only differences are:

- the handling of extra-long polling delay for some codecs
- the debug message for the stalled communication

and both are worth to share in the common code.

This patch unifies the code into snd_hdac_bus_get_response(), and use
this from the legacy get_response callback.  It results in a good
amount of code reduction in the end.
