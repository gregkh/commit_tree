KVM: x86/mmu: Avoid retpoline on ->page_fault() with TDP

Wrap calls to ->page_fault() with a small shim to directly invoke the
TDP fault handler when the kernel is using retpolines and TDP is being
used.  Single out the TDP fault handler and annotate the TDP path as
likely to coerce the compiler into preferring it over the indirect
function call.

Rename tdp_page_fault() to kvm_tdp_page_fault(), as it's exposed outside
of mmu.c to allow inlining the shim.
