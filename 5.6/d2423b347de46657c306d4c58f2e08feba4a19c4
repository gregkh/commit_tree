KVM: x86: Invoke kvm_vcpu_uninit() immediately prior to freeing vcpu

Move the call to kvm_vcpu_uninit() in kvm_arch_vcpu_destroy() down a few
lines so that it is invoked immediately prior to freeing the vCPU.  This
paves the way for moving the uninit and free sequence to common KVM code
without an associated functional change.
