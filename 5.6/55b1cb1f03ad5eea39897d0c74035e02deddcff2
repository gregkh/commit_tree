pinctrl: sh-pfc: sh7264: Fix CAN function GPIOs

pinmux_func_gpios[] contains a hole due to the missing function GPIO
definition for the "CTX0&CTX1" signal, which is the logical "AND" of the
two CAN outputs.

Fix this by:
  - Renaming CRX0_CRX1_MARK to CTX0_CTX1_MARK, as PJ2MD[2:0]=010
    configures the combined "CTX0&CTX1" output signal,
  - Renaming CRX0X1_MARK to CRX0_CRX1_MARK, as PJ3MD[1:0]=10 configures
    the shared "CRX0/CRX1" input signal, which is fed to both CAN
    inputs,
  - Adding the missing function GPIO definition for "CTX0&CTX1" to
    pinmux_func_gpios[],
  - Moving all CAN enums next to each other.

See SH7262 Group, SH7264 Group User's Manual: Hardware, Rev. 4.00:
  [1] Figure 1.2 (3) (Pin Assignment for the SH7264 Group (1-Mbyte
      Version),
  [2] Figure 1.2 (4) Pin Assignment for the SH7264 Group (640-Kbyte
      Version,
  [3] Table 1.4 List of Pins,
  [4] Figure 20.29 Connection Example when Using This Module as 1-Channel
      Module (64 Mailboxes x 1 Channel),
  [5] Table 32.10 Multiplexed Pins (Port J),
  [6] Section 32.2.30 (3) Port J Control Register 0 (PJCR0).

Note that the last 2 disagree about PJ2MD[2:0], which is probably the
root cause of this bug.  But considering [4], "CTx0&CTx1" in [5] must
be correct, and "CRx0&CRx1" in [6] must be wrong.
