gpiolib: have a single place of calling set_config()

Instead of calling the gpiochip's set_config() callback directly and
checking its existence every time - just add a new routine that performs
this check internally. Call it in gpio_set_config() and
gpiod_set_transitory(). Also call it in gpiod_set_debounce() and drop
the check for chip->set() as it's irrelevant to this config option.
