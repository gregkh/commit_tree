arm64: KVM: Annotate guest entry/exit as a single function

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotations of assembly
functions in the kernel new macros have been introduced replacing ENTRY
and ENDPROC. There are separate annotations SYM_FUNC_ for normal C
functions and SYM_CODE_ for other code. Currently __guest_enter and
__guest_exit are annotated as standard functions but this is not
entirely correct as the former doesn't do a normal return and the latter
is not entered in a normal fashion. From the point of view of the
hypervisor the guest entry/exit may be viewed as a single
function which happens to have an eret in the middle of it so let's
annotate it as such.
