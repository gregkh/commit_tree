KVM: X86: Fix callers of kvm_apic_match_dest() to use correct macros

Callers of kvm_apic_match_dest() should always pass in APIC_DEST_*
macros for either dest_mode and short_hand parameters.  Fix up all the
callers of kvm_apic_match_dest() that are not following the rule.

Since at it, rename the parameter from short_hand to shorthand in
kvm_apic_match_dest(), as suggested by Vitaly.
