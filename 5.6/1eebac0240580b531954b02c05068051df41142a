arm64: dts: uDPU: fix broken ethernet

The uDPU uses both ethernet controllers, which ties up COMPHY 0 for
eth1 and COMPHY 1 for eth0, with no USB3 comphy.  The addition of
COMPHY support made the kernel override the setup by the boot loader
breaking this platform by assuming that COMPHY 0 was always used for
USB3.  Delete the USB3 COMPHY definition at platform level, and add
phy specifications for the ethernet channels.
