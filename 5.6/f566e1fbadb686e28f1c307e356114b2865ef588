kbuild: make multiple directory targets work

Currently, the single-target build does not work when two
or more sub-directories are given:

  $ make fs/ kernel/ lib/
    CALL    scripts/checksyscalls.sh
    CALL    scripts/atomic/check-atomics.sh
    DESCEND  objtool
  make[2]: Nothing to be done for 'kernel/'.
  make[2]: Nothing to be done for 'fs/'.
  make[2]: Nothing to be done for 'lib/'.

Make it work properly.
