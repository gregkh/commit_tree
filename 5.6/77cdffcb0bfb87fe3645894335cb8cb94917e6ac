media: v4l2: abstract timeval handling in v4l2_buffer

As a preparation for adding 64-bit time_t support in the uapi,
change the drivers to no longer care about the format of the
timestamp field in struct v4l2_buffer.

The v4l2_timeval_to_ns() function is no longer needed in the
kernel after this, but there is userspace code relying on
it to be part of the uapi header.
