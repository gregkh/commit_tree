ima: avoid appraise error for hash calc interrupt

The integrity_kernel_read() call in ima_calc_file_hash_tfm() can return
a value of 0 before all bytes of the file are read. A value of 0 would
normally indicate an EOF. This has been observed if a user process is
causing a file appraisal and is terminated with a SIGTERM signal. The
most common occurrence of seeing the problem is if a shutdown or systemd
reload is initiated while files are being appraised.

The problem is similar to commit <f5e1040196db> (ima: always return
negative code for error) that fixed the problem in
ima_calc_file_hash_atfm().
