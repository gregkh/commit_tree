dm zoned: support zone sizes smaller than 128MiB

dm-zoned is observed to log failed kernel assertions and not work
correctly when operating against a device with a zone size smaller
than 128MiB (e.g. 32768 bits per 4K block). The reason is that the
bitmap size per zone is calculated as zero with such a small zone
size. Fix this problem and also make the code related to zone bitmap
management be able to handle per zone bitmaps smaller than a single
block.

A dm-zoned-tools patch is required to properly format dm-zoned devices
with zone sizes smaller than 128MiB.
