PCI: Fix pci_add_dma_alias() bitmask size

The number of possible devfns is 256, but pci_add_dma_alias() allocated a
bitmap of size 255.  Fix this off-by-one error.

This fixes commits 338c3149a221 ("PCI: Add support for multiple DMA
aliases") and c6635792737b ("PCI: Allocate dma_alias_mask with
bitmap_zalloc()"), but I doubt it was possible to see a problem because
it takes 4 64-bit longs (or 8 32-bit longs) to hold 255 bits, and
bitmap_zalloc() doesn't save the 255-bit size anywhere.

[bhelgaas: commit log, move #define to drivers/pci/pci.h, include loop
limit fix from Qian Cai:
