libbpf: Print hint about ulimit when getting permission denied error

Probably the single most common error newcomers to XDP are stumped by is
the 'permission denied' error they get when trying to load their program
and 'ulimit -l' is set too low. For examples, see [0], [1].

Since the error code is UAPI, we can't change that. Instead, this patch
adds a few heuristics in libbpf and outputs an additional hint if they are
met: If an EPERM is returned on map create or program load, and geteuid()
shows we are root, and the current RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is not infinity, we
output a hint about raising 'ulimit -l' as an additional log line.
