io_uring: allow registering credentials

If an application wants to use a ring with different kinds of
credentials, it can register them upfront. We don't lookup credentials,
the credentials of the task calling IORING_REGISTER_PERSONALITY is used.

An 'id' is returned for the application to use in subsequent personality
support.
