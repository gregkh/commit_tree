drm/i915: Copy across scheduler behaviour flags across submit fences

We want the bonded request to have the same scheduler properties as its
master so that it is placed at the same depth in the queue. For example,
consider we have requests A, B and B', where B & B' are a bonded pair to
run in parallel on two engines.

	A -> B
     	     \- B'

B will run after A and so may be scheduled on an idle engine and wait on
A using a semaphore. B' sees B being executed and so enters the queue on
the same engine as A. As B' did not inherit the semaphore-chain from B,
it may have higher precedence than A and so preempts execution. However,
B' then sits on a semaphore waiting for B, who is waiting for A, who is
blocked by B.

Ergo B' needs to inherit the scheduler properties from B (i.e. the
semaphore chain) so that it is scheduled with the same priority as B and
will not be executed ahead of Bs dependencies.

Furthermore, to prevent the priorities changing via the expose fence on
B', we need to couple in the dependencies for PI. This requires us to
relax our sanity-checks that dependencies are strictly in order.

v2: Synchronise (B, B') execution on all platforms, regardless of using
a scheduler, any no-op syncs should be elided.
