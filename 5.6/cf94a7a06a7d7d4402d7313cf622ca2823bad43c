ARM: tegra: Modify reshift divider during LP1

The reshift hardware module implements the RAM re-repair process. This
module uses PLLP as an input clock during LP1 resume. The input divider
for this clock is typically set for PLLP's normal rate. During LP1
resume, PLLP is bypassed and so runs at the crystal rate, which is much
slower. Consequently, decrease the divider so that the reshift module
runs at a reasonable rate during LP1 resume.

NVIDIA's downstream kernel code only does this if not compiled for
Tegra30, so the added code is made conditional upon the chip ID.
