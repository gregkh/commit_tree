tracing/boot Add kprobe event support

Add kprobe event support on event node to boot-time tracing.
If the group name of event is "kprobes", the boot-time tracing
defines new probe event according to "probes" values.

 - ftrace.event.kprobes.EVENT.probes = PROBE[, PROBE2...]
   Defines new kprobe event based on PROBEs. It is able to define
   multiple probes on one event, but those must have same type of
   arguments.

For example,

 ftrace.events.kprobes.myevent {
	probes = "vfs_read $arg1 $arg2";
	enable;
 }

This will add kprobes:myevent on vfs_read with the 1st and the 2nd
arguments.
