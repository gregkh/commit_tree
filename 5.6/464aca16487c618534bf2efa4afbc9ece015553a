power: supply: cros_usbpd: Remove dev_err() getting the number of ports

When a device has no support to get the charger number of ports, it
doesn't have to result in a dev_err(), print saying "Could not get
charger port count" using a dev_info() would suffice. In such case,
the dev_info() message is already printed but the dev_err() is annoying,
specially, on those devices that doesn't support the command. So remove
the dev_err().
