usb: phy: phy-gpio-vbus-usb: Convert to GPIO descriptors

Instead of using the legacy GPIO API and keeping track on
polarity inversion semantics in the driver, switch to use
GPIO descriptors for this driver and change all consumers
in the process.

This makes it possible to retire platform data completely:
the only remaining platform data member was "wakeup" which
was intended to make the vbus interrupt wakeup capable,
but was not set by any users and thus remained unused. VBUS
was not waking any devices up. Leave a comment about it so
later developers using the platform can consider setting it
to always enabled so plugging in USB wakes up the platform.
