ethtool: provide link state with LINKSTATE_GET request

Implement LINKSTATE_GET netlink request to get link state information.

At the moment, only link up flag as provided by ETHTOOL_GLINK ioctl command
is returned.

LINKSTATE_GET request can be used with NLM_F_DUMP (without device
identification) to request the information for all devices in current
network namespace providing the data.
