soc: fsl: qe: don't use NO_IRQ in qe_ic.c

This driver is currently PPC-only, and on powerpc, NO_IRQ is 0, so
this doesn't change functionality. However, not every architecture
defines NO_IRQ, and some define it as -1, so the detection of a failed
irq_of_parse_and_map() (which returns 0 on failure) would be wrong on
those. So to prepare for allowing this driver to build on other
architectures, drop all references to NO_IRQ.
