ext4: remove unneeded check for error allocating bio_post_read_ctx

Since allocating an object from a mempool never fails when
__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM (which is included in GFP_NOFS) is set, the check
for failure to allocate a bio_post_read_ctx is unnecessary.  Remove it.

Also remove the redundant assignment to ->bi_private.
