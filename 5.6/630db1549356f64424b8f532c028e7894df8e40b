ASoC: Intel: bdw-rt5677: fix Kconfig dependencies

The existing machine driver depends on SPI Master capabilities, but
the Kconfig does not model this dependency and the SPI controller
needs to be selected as well.

Without this patch the machine driver probe would fail with the
spi-RT5677AA:00 component never registered by the ACPI/LPSS subsystem.
