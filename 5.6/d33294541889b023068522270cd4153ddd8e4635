KVM: x86: remove bogus user-triggerable WARN_ON

The WARN_ON is essentially comparing a user-provided value with 0.  It is
trivial to trigger it just by passing garbage to KVM_SET_CLOCK.  Guests
can break if you do so, but the same applies to every KVM_SET_* ioctl.
So, if it hurts when you do like this, just do not do it.
