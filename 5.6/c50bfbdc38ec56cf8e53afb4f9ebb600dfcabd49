KVM: PPC: Allocate vcpu struct in common PPC code

Move allocation of all flavors of PPC vCPUs to common PPC code.  All
variants either allocate 'struct kvm_vcpu' directly, or require that
the embedded 'struct kvm_vcpu' member be located at offset 0, i.e.
guarantee that the allocation can be directly interpreted as a 'struct
kvm_vcpu' object.

Remove the message from the build-time assertion regarding placement of
the struct, as compatibility with the arch usercopy region is no longer
the sole dependent on 'struct kvm_vcpu' being at offset zero.
