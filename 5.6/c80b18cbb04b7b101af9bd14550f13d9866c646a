rtlwifi: rtl8188ee: Fix regression due to commit d1d1a96bdb44

For some unexplained reason, commit d1d1a96bdb44 ("rtlwifi: rtl8188ee:
Remove local configuration variable") broke at least one system. As
the only net effect of the change was to remove 2 bytes from the start
of struct phy_status_rpt, this patch adds 2 bytes of padding at the
beginning of the struct.
