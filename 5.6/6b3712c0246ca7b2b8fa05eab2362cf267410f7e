RDMA/core: Ensure that rdma_user_mmap_entry_remove() is a fence

The set of entry->driver_removed is missing locking, protect it with
xa_lock() which is held by the only reader.

Otherwise readers may continue to see driver_removed = false after
rdma_user_mmap_entry_remove() returns and may continue to try and
establish new mmaps.
