PM: suspend: Add sysfs attribute to control the "sync on suspend" behavior

The sysfs attribute `/sys/power/sync_on_suspend` controls, whether or not
filesystems are synced by the kernel before system suspend.

Congruously, the behaviour of build-time switch CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC
is slightly changed: It now defines the run-tim default for the new sysfs
attribute `/sys/power/sync_on_suspend`.

The run-time attribute is added because the existing corresponding
build-time Kconfig flag for (`CONFIG_SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC`) is not flexible
enough. E.g. Linux distributions that provide pre-compiled kernels
usually want to stick with the default (sync filesystems before suspend)
but under special conditions this needs to be changed.

One example for such a special condition is user-space handling of
suspending block devices (e.g. using `cryptsetup luksSuspend` or `dmsetup
suspend`) before system suspend. The Kernel trying to sync filesystems
after the underlying block device already got suspended obviously leads
to dead-locks. Be aware that you have to take care of the filesystem sync
yourself before suspending the system in those scenarios.
