ARM: dts: ux500: Rename generic pin configs according to pin group

Some components (e.g. SDI, I2C) can be used with different pin assignments.
Before we can add the alternative configurations, we need to rename the
current configurations to more generic names.

Each pin configuration usually configures one specific pin group.
Therefore we rename the configurations to use the pin group as name.
Make up for the slightly longer names by removing the "_mode" suffix.

Rename all existing uses to use the new labels.
