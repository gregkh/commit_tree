KVM: Return immediately if __kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init() fails

Check the result of __kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init() and return immediately
instead of relying on the kvm_is_error_hva() check to detect errors so
that it's abundantly clear KVM intends to immediately bail on an error.

Note, the hva check is still mandatory to handle errors on subqeuesnt
calls with the same generation.  Similarly, always return -EFAULT on
error so that multiple (bad) calls for a given generation will get the
same result, e.g. on an illegal gfn wrap, propagating the return from
__kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init() would cause the initial call to return
-EINVAL and subsequent calls to return -EFAULT.
