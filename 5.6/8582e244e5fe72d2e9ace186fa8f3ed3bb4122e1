drm/modes: parse_cmdline: Fix possible reference past end of string

Before this commit, if the last option of a video=... option is for
example "rotate" without a "=<value>" after it then delim will point to
the terminating 0 of the string, and value which is sets to <delim + 1>
will point one position past the end of the string.

This commit fixes this by enforcing that the contents of delim equals '='
as it should be for options which take a value, this check is done in a
new drm_mode_parse_cmdline_int helper function which factors out the
common integer parsing code for all the options which take an int.
