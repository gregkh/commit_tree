libbpf: Expose bpf_find_kernel_btf as a LIBBPF_API

This patch exposes bpf_find_kernel_btf() as a LIBBPF_API.
It will be used in 'bpftool map dump' in a following patch
to dump a map with btf_vmlinux_value_type_id set.

bpf_find_kernel_btf() is renamed to libbpf_find_kernel_btf()
and moved to btf.c.  As <linux/kernel.h> is included,
some of the max/min type casting needs to be fixed.
