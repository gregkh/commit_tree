btrfs: calculate discard delay based on number of extents

An earlier patch keeps track of discardable_extents. These are
undiscarded extents managed by the free space cache. Here, we will use
this to dynamically calculate the discard delay interval.

There are 3 rate to consider. The first is the target convergence rate,
the rate to discard all discardable_extents over the
BTRFS_DISCARD_TARGET_MSEC time frame. This is clamped by the lower
limit, the iops limit or BTRFS_DISCARD_MIN_DELAY (1ms), and the upper
limit, BTRFS_DISCARD_MAX_DELAY (1s). We reevaluate this delay every
transaction commit.
