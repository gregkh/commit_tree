io_uring: add io-wq workqueue sharing

If IORING_SETUP_ATTACH_WQ is set, it expects wq_fd in io_uring_params to
be a valid io_uring fd io-wq of which will be shared with the newly
created io_uring instance. If the flag is set but it can't share io-wq,
it fails.

This allows creation of "sibling" io_urings, where we prefer to keep the
SQ/CQ private, but want to share the async backend to minimize the amount
of overhead associated with having multiple rings that belong to the same
backend.
