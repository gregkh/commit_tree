tracing: Clear trace_state when starting trace

Clear trace_state data structure when starting trace
in __synth_event_trace_start() internal function.

Currently trace_state is initialized only in the
synth_event_trace_start() API, but the trace_state
in synth_event_trace() and synth_event_trace_array()
are on the stack without initialization.
This means those APIs will see wrong parameters and
wil skip closing process in __synth_event_trace_end()
because trace_state->disabled may be !0.
