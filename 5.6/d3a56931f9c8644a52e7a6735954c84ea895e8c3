xsk: Support allocations of large umems

When registering a umem area that is sufficiently large (>1G on an
x86), kmalloc cannot be used to allocate one of the internal data
structures, as the size requested gets too large. Use kvmalloc instead
that falls back on vmalloc if the allocation is too large for kmalloc.

Also add accounting for this structure as it is triggered by a user
space action (the XDP_UMEM_REG setsockopt) and it is by far the
largest structure of kernel allocated memory in xsk.
