tty: fix compat TIOCGSERIAL checking wrong function ptr

Commit 77654350306a ("take compat TIOC[SG]SERIAL treatment into
tty_compat_ioctl()") changed the compat version of TIOCGSERIAL to start
checking for the presence of the ->set_serial function pointer rather
than ->get_serial.  This appears to be a copy-and-paste error, since
->get_serial is the function pointer that is called as well as the
pointer that is checked by the non-compat version of TIOCGSERIAL.

Fix this by checking the correct function pointer.
