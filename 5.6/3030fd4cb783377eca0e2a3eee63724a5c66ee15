io-wq: remove spin-for-work optimization

Andres reports that buffered IO seems to suck up more cycles than we
would like, and he narrowed it down to the fact that the io-wq workers
will briefly spin for more work on completion of a work item. This was
a win on the networking side, but apparently some other cases take a
hit because of it. Remove the optimization to avoid burning more CPU
than we have to for disk IO.
