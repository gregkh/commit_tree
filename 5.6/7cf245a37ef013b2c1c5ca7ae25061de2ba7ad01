samples/bpf: Use consistent include paths for libbpf

Fix all files in samples/bpf to include libbpf header files with the bpf/
prefix, to be consistent with external users of the library. Also ensure
that all includes of exported libbpf header files (those that are exported
on 'make install' of the library) use bracketed includes instead of quoted.

To make sure no new files are introduced that doesn't include the bpf/
prefix in its include, remove tools/lib/bpf from the include path entirely,
and use tools/lib instead.
