xen/blkfront: fix ring info addressing

Commit 0265d6e8ddb890 ("xen/blkfront: limit allocated memory size to
actual use case") made struct blkfront_ring_info size dynamic. This is
fine when running with only one queue, but with multiple queues the
addressing of the single queues has to be adapted as the structs are
allocated in an array.
