ALSA: hda/realtek - Apply mic mute LED quirk for Dell E7xx laptops, too

Dell E7xx laptops have also mic mute LED that is driven by the
dell-laptop platform driver.  Bind it with the capture control as
already done for other models.

A caveat is that the fixup hook for the mic mute LED has to be applied
at last, otherwise it results in the invalid override of the callback.
