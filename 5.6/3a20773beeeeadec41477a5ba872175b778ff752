net: netlink: cap max groups which will be considered in netlink_bind()

Since nl_groups is a u32 we can't bind more groups via ->bind
(netlink_bind) call, but netlink has supported more groups via
setsockopt() for a long time and thus nlk->ngroups could be over 32.
Recently I added support for per-vlan notifications and increased the
groups to 33 for NETLINK_ROUTE which exposed an old bug in the
netlink_bind() code causing out-of-bounds access on archs where unsigned
long is 32 bits via test_bit() on a local variable. Fix this by capping the
maximum groups in netlink_bind() to BITS_PER_TYPE(u32), effectively
capping them at 32 which is the minimum of allocated groups and the
maximum groups which can be bound via netlink_bind().
