IB/mlx5: Fix outstanding_pi index for GSI qps

Commit b0ffeb537f3a ("IB/mlx5: Fix iteration overrun in GSI qps") changed
the way outstanding WRs are tracked for the GSI QP. But the fix did not
cover the case when a call to ib_post_send() fails and updates index to
track outstanding.

Since the prior commmit outstanding_pi should not be bounded otherwise the
loop generate_completions() will fail.
