xdp: Simplify devmap cleanup

After the RCU flavor consolidation [1], call_rcu() and
synchronize_rcu() waits for preempt-disable regions (NAPI) in addition
to the read-side critical sections. As a result of this, the cleanup
code in devmap can be simplified

* There is no longer a need to flush in __dev_map_entry_free, since we
  know that this has been done when the call_rcu() callback is
  triggered.

* When freeing the map, there is no need to explicitly wait for a
  flush. It's guaranteed to be done after the synchronize_rcu() call
  in dev_map_free(). The rcu_barrier() is still needed, so that the
  map is not freed prior the elements.
