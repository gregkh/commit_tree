netfilter: nft_meta: add support for slave device ifindex matching

Allow to match on vrf slave ifindex or name.

In case there was no slave interface involved, store 0 in the
destination register just like existing iif/oif matching.

sdif(name) is restricted to the ipv4/ipv6 input and forward hooks,
as it depends on ip(6) stack parsing/storing info in skb->cb[].
