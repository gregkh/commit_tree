usb: pd: Add definition for DFP and UFP1 VDOs

The latest version of the USB Power Delivery Specification
R3.0 added UFP and DFP product types for the Discover
Identity message. Both types can be used for example for
checking the USB capability of the partner, which means the
USB modes (USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and USB4) that the partner
device supports.
