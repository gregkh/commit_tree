PCI: brcmstb: Add MSI support

This adds MSI support to the Broadcom STB PCIe host controller. The MSI
controller is physically located within the PCIe block, however, there
is no reason why the MSI controller could not be moved elsewhere in the
future. MSIX is not supported by the HW.

Since the internal Brcmstb MSI controller is intertwined with the PCIe
controller, it is not its own platform device but rather part of the
PCIe platform device.
