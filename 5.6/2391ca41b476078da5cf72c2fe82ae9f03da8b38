smb3: add one more dynamic tracepoint missing from strict fsync path

We didn't have a dynamic trace point for catching errors in
file_write_and_wait_range error cases in cifs_strict_fsync.

Since not all apps check for write behind errors, it can be
important for debugging to be able to trace these error
paths.
