perf probe: Fix to delete multiple probe event

When we put an event with multiple probes, perf-probe fails to delete
with filters. This comes from a failure to list up the event name
because of overwrapping its name.

To fix this issue, skip to list up the event which has same name.

Without this patch:

  # perf probe -l \*
    probe_perf:map__map_ip (on perf_sample__fprintf_brstackoff:21@
    probe_perf:map__map_ip (on perf_sample__fprintf_brstackoff:25@
    probe_perf:map__map_ip (on append_inlines:12@util/machine.c in
    probe_perf:map__map_ip (on unwind_entry:19@util/machine.c in /
    probe_perf:map__map_ip (on map__map_ip@util/map.h in /home/mhi
    probe_perf:map__map_ip (on map__map_ip@util/map.h in /home/mhi
  # perf probe -d \*
  "*" does not hit any event.
    Error: Failed to delete events. Reason: No such file or directory (Code: -2)

With it:

  # perf probe -d \*
  Removed event: probe_perf:map__map_ip
  #
