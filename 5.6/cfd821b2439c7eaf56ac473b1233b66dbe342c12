drm/i915/selftests: Force bonded submission to overlap

Bonded request submission is designed to allow requests to execute in
parallel as laid out by the user. If the master request is already
finished before its bonded pair is submitted, the pair were not destined
to run in parallel and we lose the information about the master engine
to dictate selection of the secondary. If the second request was
required to be run on a particular engine in a virtual set, that should
have been specified, rather than left to the whims of a random
unconnected requests!

In the selftest, I made the mistake of not ensuring the master would
overlap with its bonded pairs, meaning that it could indeed complete
before we submitted the bonds. Those bonds were then free to select any
available engine in their virtual set, and not the one expected by the
test.
