efi/x86: Split off some old memmap handling into separate routines

In a subsequent patch, we will fold the prolog/epilog routines that are
part of the support code to call SetVirtualAddressMap() with a 1:1
mapping into the callers. However, the 64-bit version mostly consists
of ugly mapping code that is only used when efi=old_map is in effect,
which is extremely rare. So let's move this code out of the way so it
does not clutter the common code.
