cpuidle: psci: Prepare to use OS initiated suspend mode via PM domains

The per CPU variable psci_power_state, contains an array of fixed values,
which reflects the corresponding arm,psci-suspend-param parsed from DT, for
each of the available CPU idle states.

This isn't sufficient when using the hierarchical CPU topology in DT, in
combination with having PSCI OS initiated (OSI) mode enabled. More
precisely, in OSI mode, Linux is responsible of telling the PSCI FW what
idle state the cluster (a group of CPUs) should enter, while in PSCI
Platform Coordinated (PC) mode, each CPU independently votes for an idle
state of the cluster.

For this reason, introduce a per CPU variable called domain_state and
implement two helper functions to read/write its value. Then let the
domain_state take precedence over the regular selected state, when entering
and idle state.

To avoid executing the above OSI specific code in the ->enter() callback,
while operating in the default PSCI Platform Coordinated mode, let's also
add a new enter-function and use it for OSI.
