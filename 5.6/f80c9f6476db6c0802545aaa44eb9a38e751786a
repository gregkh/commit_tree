efi/x86: Remove support for EFI time and counter services in mixed mode

Mixed mode calls at runtime are rather tricky with vmap'ed stacks,
as we can no longer assume that data passed in by the callers of the
EFI runtime wrapper routines is contiguous in physical memory.

We need to fix this, but before we do, let's drop the implementations
of routines that we know are never used on x86, i.e., the RTC related
ones. Given that UEFI rev2.8 permits any runtime service to return
EFI_UNSUPPORTED at runtime, let's return that instead.

As get_next_high_mono_count() is never used at all, even on other
architectures, let's make that return EFI_UNSUPPORTED too.
