rcu: Fix tracepoint tracking RCU CPU kthread utilization

In the call to trace_rcu_utilization() at the start of the loop in
rcu_cpu_kthread(), "rcu_wait" is incorrect, plus this trace event needs
to be hoisted above the loop to balance with either the "rcu_wait" or
"rcu_yield", depending on how the loop exits.  This commit therefore
makes these changes.
