KVM: fix error handling in svm_hardware_setup

rename svm_hardware_unsetup as svm_hardware_teardown, move
it before svm_hardware_setup, and call it to free all memory
if fail to setup in svm_hardware_setup, otherwise memory will
be leaked

remove __exit attribute for it since it is called in __init
function
