arm64: dts: rockchip: Improve nanopi4 PCIe

Expand the power tree description with the 0V9 and 1V8 supplies to the
RK3399 PCIe block. The NanoPis M4 and NEO4 just route 2 lanes to the
user expansion pins, so there's not much more to say at the board level
for them; NanoPC-T4 has a standard M.2 connector so we can at least
claim the 3.3V supply to that too.
