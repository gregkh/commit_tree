efi/gop: Remove bogus packed attribute from GOP structures

EFI structures are not packed, they follow natural alignment.

The packed attribute doesn't have any effect on the structure layout due
to the types and order of the members, and we only ever get these
structures as output from the EFI firmware so alignment issues have not
come up.
