ath11k: avoid null pointer dereference when pointer band is null

In the unlikely event that cap->supported_bands has neither
WMI_HOST_WLAN_2G_CAP set or WMI_HOST_WLAN_5G_CAP set then pointer
band is null and a null dereference occurs when assigning
band->n_iftype_data.  Move the assignment to the if blocks to
avoid this.  Cleans up static analysis warnings.
