l2tp: Allow duplicate session creation with UDP

In the past it was possible to create multiple L2TPv3 sessions with the
same session id as long as the sessions belonged to different tunnels.
The resulting sessions had issues when used with IP encapsulated tunnels,
but worked fine with UDP encapsulated ones. Some applications began to
rely on this behaviour to avoid having to negotiate unique session ids.

Some time ago a change was made to require session ids to be unique across
all tunnels, breaking the applications making use of this "feature".

This change relaxes the duplicate session id check to allow duplicates
if both of the colliding sessions belong to UDP encapsulated tunnels.
