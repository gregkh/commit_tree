net/mlx5e: Fix ICOSQ recovery flow with Striding RQ

In striding RQ mode, the buffers of an RX WQE are first
prepared and posted to the HW using a UMR WQEs via the ICOSQ.
We maintain the state of these in-progress WQEs in the RQ
SW struct.

In the flow of ICOSQ recovery, the corresponding RQ is not
in error state, hence:

- The buffers of the in-progress WQEs must be released
  and the RQ metadata should reflect it.
- Existing RX WQEs in the RQ should not be affected.

For this, wrap the dealloc of the in-progress WQEs in
a function, and use it in the ICOSQ recovery flow
instead of mlx5e_free_rx_descs().
