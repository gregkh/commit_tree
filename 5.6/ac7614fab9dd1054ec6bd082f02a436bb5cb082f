extcon: arizona: Clear jack status regardless of detection type

It makes sense to clear the internal state of the jack detection
regardless of if the headphone detect based accessory detection or
the normal microphone detect based flow is used.

No issues are currently known because of this but the change makes
more logical sense and eases future refactoring of the code.
