batman-adv: Annotate bitwise integer pointer casts

The sparse commit 6002ded74587 ("add a flag to warn on casts to/from
bitwise pointers") introduced a check for non-direct casts from/to
restricted datatypes (when -Wbitwise-pointer is enabled).

This triggered various warnings in batman-adv when some (already big
endian) buffer content was casted to/from the corresponding big endian
integer data types. But these were correct and can therefore be marked with
__force to signalize sparse an intended cast from/to a bitwise type.
