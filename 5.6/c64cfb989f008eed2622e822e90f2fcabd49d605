fscrypt: verify that the crypto_skcipher has the correct ivsize

As a sanity check, verify that the allocated crypto_skcipher actually
has the ivsize that fscrypt is assuming it has.  This will always be the
case unless there's a bug.  But if there ever is such a bug (e.g. like
there was in earlier versions of the ESSIV conversion patch [1]) it's
preferable for it to be immediately obvious, and not rely on the
ciphertext verification tests failing due to uninitialized IV bytes.
