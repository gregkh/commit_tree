net/mlx5e: Fix missing reset of SW metadata in Striding RQ reset

When resetting the RQ (moving RQ state from RST to RDY), the driver
resets the WQ's SW metadata.
In striding RQ mode, we maintain a field that reflects the actual
expected WQ head (including in progress WQEs posted to the ICOSQ).
It was mistakenly not reset together with the WQ. Fix this here.
