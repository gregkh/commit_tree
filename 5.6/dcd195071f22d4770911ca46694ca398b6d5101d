dm writecache: improve performance of large linear writes on SSDs

When dm-writecache is used with SSD as a cache device, it would submit a
separate bio for each written block. The I/Os would be merged by the disk
scheduler, but this merging degrades performance.

Improve dm-writecache performance by submitting larger bios - this is
possible as long as there is consecutive free space on the cache
device.

Benchmark (arm64 with 64k page size, using /dev/ram0 as a cache device):

fio --bs=512k --iodepth=32 --size=400M --direct=1 \
    --filename=/dev/mapper/cache --rw=randwrite --numjobs=1 --name=test

block	old	new
