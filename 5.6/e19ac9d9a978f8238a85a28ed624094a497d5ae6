iio: adc: stm32-dfsdm: fix sleep in atomic context

This commit fixes the error message:
"BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/irq/chip.c"
Suppress the trigger irq handler. Make the buffer transfers directly
in DMA callback, instead.
Push buffers without timestamps, as timestamps are not supported
in DFSDM driver.
