drm/i915/selftests: Verify mmap_gtt revocation on unbinding

Whenever, we unbind (or change fence registers) on an object, we must
revoke any and all mmap_gtt using the previous bindings. Those user PTEs
point at the GGTT which know points into a new object, the wrong object.
Ergo, those PTEs must be cleared so that any user access provokes a new
page fault.
