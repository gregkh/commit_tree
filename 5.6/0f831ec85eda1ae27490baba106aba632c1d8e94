ovl: simplify ovl_same_sb() helper

No code uses the sb returned from this helper, so make it retrun a boolean
and rename it to ovl_same_fs().

The xino mode is irrelevant when all layers are on same fs, so instead of
describing samefs with mode OVL_XINO_OFF, use a new xino_mode state, which
is 0 in the case of samefs, -1 in the case of xino=off and > 0 with xino
enabled.

Create a new helper ovl_same_dev(), to use instead of the common check for
(ovl_same_fs() || xinobits).
