ath11k: fix wmi service ready ext tlv parsing

The current ath11k driver failed to parse
wmi_tlv_svc_rdy_ext_parse if there is change in
wmi_mac_phy_capabilities length with below error.

ath11k c000000.wifi1: failed to extract mac caps, idx :0
ath11k c000000.wifi1: failed to parse tlv -22

This is needed to get firmware version
WLAN.HK.2.0.0.1-00240-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1 working.
