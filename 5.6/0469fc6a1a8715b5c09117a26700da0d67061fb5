staging: wfx: check for memory allocation failures from wfx_alloc_hif

Currently calls to wfx_alloc_hif are not checking for a null return
when a memory allocation fails and this leads to null pointer
dereferencing issues.  Fix this by adding null pointer checks and
returning passing down -ENOMEM errors where necessary. The error
checking in the current driver is a bit sparse, so this may need
some extra attention later if required.
