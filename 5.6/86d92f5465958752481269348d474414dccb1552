usb: storage: Add quirk for Samsung Fit flash

Current driver has 240 (USB2.0) and 2048 (USB3.0) as max_sectors,
e.g., /sys/bus/scsi/devices/0:0:0:0/max_sectors

If data access times out, driver error handling will issue a port
reset.
Sometimes Samsung Fit (090C:1000) flash disk will not respond to
later Set Address or Get Descriptor command.

Adding this quirk to limit max_sectors to 64 sectors to avoid issue
occurring.
