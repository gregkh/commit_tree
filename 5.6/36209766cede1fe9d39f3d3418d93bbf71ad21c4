x86/traps: Cleanup do_general_protection()

Hoist the user_mode() case up because it is less code and can be dealt
with up-front like the other special cases UMIP and vm86.

This saves an indentation level for the kernel-mode #GP case and allows
to "unfold" the code more so that it is more readable.

No functional changes.
