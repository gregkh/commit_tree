thermal: rcar_thermal: Remove temperature bound

The hardware manual states that the operation of the sensor is not
guaranteed outside the range of -45°C to 125°C, not that the readings
are invalid. Remove the bound check and try to deliver temperature
readings even if we are outside the guaranteed operation range.
