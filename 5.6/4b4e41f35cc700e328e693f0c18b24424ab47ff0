pinctrl: actions: remove duplicate dsi entry

The dsi entry is defined identically twice, so remove
the second one to remove the sparse warning:

drivers/pinctrl/actions/pinctrl-s700.c:1581:10: warning: Initializer entry defined twice
drivers/pinctrl/actions/pinctrl-s700.c:1586:10:   also defined here
