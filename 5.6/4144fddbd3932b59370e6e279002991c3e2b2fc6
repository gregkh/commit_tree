x86/tsc: Remove redundant assignment

Previously, the assignment to the local variable 'now' took place
before the for loop. The loop is unconditional so it will be entered
at least once. The variable 'now' is reassigned in the loop and is not
used before reassigning. Therefore, the assignment before the loop is
unnecessary and can be removed.

No code changed:
