csky: Enable defer flush_dcache_page for abiv2 cpus (807/810/860)

Instead of flushing cache per update_mmu_cache() called, we use
flush_dcache_page to reduce the frequency of flashing the cache.

As abiv2 cpus are all PIPT for icache & dcache, we needn't handle
dcache aliasing problem. But their icache can't snoop dcache, so
we still need sync_icache_dcache in update_mmu_cache().
