net: hns3: check FE bit before calling hns3_add_frag()

A BD with FE bit means that it is the last BD of a packet,
currently the FE bit is checked before calling hns3_add_frag(),
which is unnecessary because the FE bit may have been checked
in some case.

This patch checks the FE bit before calling hns3_add_frag()
after processing the first BD of a SKB and adjust the location
of memcpy() to reduce duplication.
