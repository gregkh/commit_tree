nfs: fscache: use timespec64 in inode auxdata

nfs currently behaves differently on 32-bit and 64-bit kernels regarding
the on-disk format of nfs_fscache_inode_auxdata.

That format should really be the same on any kernel, and we should avoid
the 'timespec' type in order to remove that from the kernel later on.

Using plain 'timespec64' would not be good here, since that includes
implied padding and would possibly leak kernel stack data to the on-disk
format on 32-bit architectures.

struct __kernel_timespec would work as a replacement, but open-coding
the two struct members in nfs_fscache_inode_auxdata makes it more
obvious what's going on here, and keeps the current format for 64-bit
architectures.
