drm/nouveau/nouveau: fix incorrect sizeof on args.src an args.dst

The sizeof is currently on args.src and args.dst and should be on
*args.src and *args.dst. Fortunately these sizes just so happen
to be the same size so it worked, however, this should be fixed
and it also cleans up static analysis warnings

Addresses-Coverity: ("sizeof not portable")
