io_uring: allow use of offset == -1 to mean file position

This behaves like preadv2/pwritev2 with offset == -1, it'll use (and
update) the current file position. This obviously comes with the caveat
that if the application has multiple read/writes in flight, then the
end result will not be as expected. This is similar to threads sharing
a file descriptor and doing IO using the current file position.

Since this feature isn't easily detectable by doing a read or write,
add a feature flags, IORING_FEAT_RW_CUR_POS, to allow applications to
detect presence of this feature.
