ipv4: Encapsulate function arguments in a struct

fib_dump_info() is used to prepare RTM_{NEW,DEL}ROUTE netlink messages
using the passed arguments. Currently, the function takes 11 arguments,
6 of which are attributes of the route being dumped (e.g., prefix, TOS).

The next patch will need the function to also dump to user space an
indication if the route is present in hardware or not. Instead of
passing yet another argument, change the function to take a struct
containing the different route attributes.

v2:
* Name last argument of fib_dump_info()
* Move 'struct fib_rt_info' to include/net/ip_fib.h so that it could
  later be passed to fib_alias_hw_flags_set()
