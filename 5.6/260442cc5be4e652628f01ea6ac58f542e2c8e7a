iio: adc: ad7091r5: Add scale and external VREF support

The scale can now be obtained with the "in_voltage_scale" file.
By default, the scale returned corresponds to the internal VREF of 2.5V.

It is possible to use an external VREF (through the REFIN/REFOUT pin of
the chip), by passing a regulator to the driver. The scale will then be
calculated according to the voltage reported by the regulator.
