tracing: Add synth_event_trace() and related functions

Add an exported function named synth_event_trace(), allowing modules
or other kernel code to trace synthetic events.

Also added are several functions that allow the same functionality to
be broken out in a piecewise fashion, which are useful in situations
where tracing an event from a full array of values would be
cumbersome.  Those functions are synth_event_trace_start/end() and
synth_event_add_(next)_val().
