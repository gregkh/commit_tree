media: tm6000: Clean up ALSA PCM API usages

With the recent change in ALSA PCM core, the whole open-coded vmalloc
buffer handling in this driver can be dropped by replacing with the
managed buffer allocation.

Also, snd_tm6000_capture_free() is dropped since the check of
stream_started flag makes no sense; hw_free callback is guaranteed to
be called after the stream gets stopped.
