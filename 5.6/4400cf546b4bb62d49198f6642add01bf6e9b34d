KVM: x86: Fix perfctr WRMSR for running counters

Correct the logic in intel_pmu_set_msr() for fixed and general purpose
counters. This was recently changed to set pmc->counter without taking
in to account the value of pmc_read_counter() which will be incorrect if
the counter is currently running and non-zero; this changes back to the
old logic which accounted for the value of currently running counters.
