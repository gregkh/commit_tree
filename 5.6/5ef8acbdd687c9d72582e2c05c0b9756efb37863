KVM: nVMX: Emulate MTF when performing instruction emulation

Since commit 5f3d45e7f282 ("kvm/x86: add support for
MONITOR_TRAP_FLAG"), KVM has allowed an L1 guest to use the monitor trap
flag processor-based execution control for its L2 guest. KVM simply
forwards any MTF VM-exits to the L1 guest, which works for normal
instruction execution.

However, when KVM needs to emulate an instruction on the behalf of an L2
guest, the monitor trap flag is not emulated. Add the necessary logic to
kvm_skip_emulated_instruction() to synthesize an MTF VM-exit to L1 upon
instruction emulation for L2.
