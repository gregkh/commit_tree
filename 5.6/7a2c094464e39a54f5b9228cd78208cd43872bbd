arm64: entry: cleanup el0 svc handler naming

For most of the exception entry code, <foo>_handler() is the first C
function called from the entry assembly in entry-common.c, and external
functions handling the bulk of the logic are called do_<foo>().

For consistency, apply this scheme to el0_svc_handler and
el0_svc_compat_handler, renaming them to do_el0_svc and
do_el0_svc_compat respectively.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
