efi: Add tracking for dynamically allocated memmaps

In preparation for fixing efi_memmap_alloc() leaks, add support for
recording whether the memmap was dynamically allocated from slab,
memblock, or is the original physical memmap provided by the platform.

Given this tracking is established in efi_memmap_alloc() and needs to be
carried to efi_memmap_install(), use 'struct efi_memory_map_data' to
convey the flags.

Some small cleanups result from this reorganization, specifically the
removal of local variables for 'phys' and 'size' that are already
tracked in @data.
