staging: octeon-usb: delete the octeon usb host controller driver

This driver was merged back in 2013 and shows no progress toward every
being merged into the "correct" part of the kernel.  The code doesn't
even build for anyone unless you have the specific hardware platform
selected, so odds are it doesn't even work anymore.

Remove it for now and is someone comes along that has the hardware and
is willing to fix it up, it can be reverted.
