powerpc/pseries: Verify CPU doesn't exist before adding

When DLPAR adding a CPU we should verify that the CPU does not already
exist. Failure to do so can generate a kernel oops;

[    9.465585] kernel BUG at arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c:382!
[    9.465796] Oops: Exception in kernel mode, sig: 5 [#1]

This oops can be generated by causing a probe to be performed on a cpu
by writing to the sysfs cpu probe file (/sys/devices/system/cpu/probe).
This patch adds a check for the existence of cpu prior to probing the cpu
so userspace doing the wrong thing won't trigger a BUG_ON().
