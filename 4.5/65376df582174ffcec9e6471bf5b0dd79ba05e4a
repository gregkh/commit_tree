proc: revert /proc/<pid>/maps [stack:TID] annotation

Commit b76437579d13 ("procfs: mark thread stack correctly in
proc/<pid>/maps") added [stack:TID] annotation to /proc/<pid>/maps.

Finding the task of a stack VMA requires walking the entire thread list,
turning this into quadratic behavior: a thousand threads means a
thousand stacks, so the rendering of /proc/<pid>/maps needs to look at a
million combinations.

The cost is not in proportion to the usefulness as described in the
patch.

Drop the [stack:TID] annotation to make /proc/<pid>/maps (and
/proc/<pid>/numa_maps) usable again for higher thread counts.

The [stack] annotation inside /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/maps is retained, as
identifying the stack VMA there is an O(1) operation.

 "The end users needed a way to identify thread stacks programmatically and
  there wasn't a way to do that.  I'm afraid I no longer remember (or have
  access to the resources that would aid my memory since I changed
  employers) the details of their requirement.  However, I did do this on my
  own time because I thought it was an interesting project for me and nobody
  really gave any feedback then as to its utility, so as far as I am
  concerned you could roll back the main thread maps information since the
  information is available in the thread-specific files"
