drm/i915: Read FORCEWAKE registers with I915_READ_FW()

Change FORCEWAKE & co. reads for the error state to use I915_READ_FW().
Reading a FORCEWAKE register using a function that can frob forcewake
just seems wrong.

There is a check to skip grabbing the forcewake for accessing FORCEWAKE
in intel_uncore.c, but there's no such check for FORCEWAKE_MT. So no
idea what is currently happening with FORCEWAKE_MT reads. FORCEWAKE_VLV
is fortunately outside the forcewake range anyway, so no actual issue
with that one.

So let's just make the rule that you can't access FORCEWAKE registers with
the normal I915_READ() stuff, and we can drop the extra FORCEWAKE check
from NEEDS_FORCEWAKE(). While at it use NEEDS_FORCEWAKE() on BDW, where
it was skipped for whatever bikeshed reason that I've already forgotten.
