ixgbe: Prevent KR PHY reset in ixgbe_init_phy_ops_x550em

This patch removes KR PHY reset from ixgbe_init_phy_ops_x550em,
since this function is meant to initialize function pointers for
the detected PHY type. Internal PHY reset was moved to
ixgbe_setup_internal_phy_t_x550em which will now detect which
mode the internal PHY operates in and set it up as required.
