i2c: img-scb: support I2C_M_IGNORE_NAK

This commit adds support for the I2C_M_IGNORE_NAK protocol
modification.

Such behaviour can only be implemented in atomic mode. So, if a
transaction contains a message with such flag the drivers
switches to atomic mode. The implementation consists simply in
treating NAKs as ACKs.
