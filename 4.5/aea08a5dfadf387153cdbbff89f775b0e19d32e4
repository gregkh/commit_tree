dmaengine: stm32-dma: Fix unchecked deference of chan->desc

'commit d8b468394fb7 ("dmaengine: Add STM32 DMA driver")' leads to the
following Smatch complaint:

drivers/dma/stm32-dma.c:562 stm32_dma_issue_pending()
    error: we previously assumed 'chan->desc' could be null (see line 560)

So, this patch fixes the unchecked dereference of chan->desc by returning
operation not permitted error when stm32_dma_start_transfer() does not
succeed to allocate a virtual channel descriptor.
