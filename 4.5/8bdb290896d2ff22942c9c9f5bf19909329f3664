net: nb8800: avoid uninitialized variable warning

The nb8800_poll() function initializes the 'next' variable in the
loop looking for new input data. We know this will be called at
least once because 'budget' is a guaranteed to be a positive number
when we enter the function, but the compiler doesn't know that
and warns when the variable is used later:

drivers/net/ethernet/aurora/nb8800.c: In function 'nb8800_poll':
drivers/net/ethernet/aurora/nb8800.c:350:21: warning: 'next' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Changing the 'while() {}' loop to 'do {} while()' makes it obvious
to the compiler what is going on so it no longer warns.
