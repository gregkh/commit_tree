ext4: fix races of writeback with punch hole and zero range

When doing delayed allocation, update of on-disk inode size is postponed
until IO submission time. However hole punch or zero range fallocate
calls can end up discarding the tail page cache page and thus on-disk
inode size would never be properly updated.

Make sure the on-disk inode size is updated before truncating page
cache.
