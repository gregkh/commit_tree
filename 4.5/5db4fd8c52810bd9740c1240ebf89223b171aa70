arm64: Clear out any singlestep state on a ptrace detach operation

Make sure to clear out any ptrace singlestep state when a ptrace(2)
PTRACE_DETACH call is made on arm64 systems.

Otherwise, the previously ptraced task will die off with a SIGTRAP
signal if the debugger just previously singlestepped the ptraced task.
