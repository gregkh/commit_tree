bridge: mdb: avoid uninitialized variable warning

A recent change to the mdb code confused the compiler to the point
where it did not realize that the port-group returned from
br_mdb_add_group() is always valid when the function returns a nonzero
return value, so we get a spurious warning:

net/bridge/br_mdb.c: In function 'br_mdb_add':
net/bridge/br_mdb.c:542:4: error: 'pg' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    __br_mdb_notify(dev, entry, RTM_NEWMDB, pg);

Slightly rearranging the code in br_mdb_add_group() makes the problem
go away, as gcc is clever enough to see that both functions check
for 'ret != 0'.
