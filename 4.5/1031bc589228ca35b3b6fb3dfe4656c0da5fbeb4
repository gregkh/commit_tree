lib/vsprintf: add %*pg format specifier

This allow to directly print block_device name.
Currently one should use bdevname() with temporal char buffer.
This is very ineffective because bloat stack usage for deep IO call-traces

Example:
	%pg  ->    sda, sda1 or loop0p1

[AV: fixed a minor braino - position updates should not be dependent
upon having reached the of buffer]
