staging/wilc1000: use proper naming for global symbols

There are many global symbols in the wilc1000 driver, some of them
with names like "DEBUG_LEVEL" or "probe" that are not acceptable
for globals in the linux kernel as they may easily conflict with other
(equally broken) drivers.

This renames all the globals that do not already start with
wilc or a variation of that to start with wilc_ and to follow
the usual naming conventions.
