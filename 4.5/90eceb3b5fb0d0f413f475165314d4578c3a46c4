ath10k: set peer MFP flag in peer assoc command

Set peer's management frame protection flag in peer assoc command,
this setting will enable/disable encrytion of management frames in fw.

Setting of this flag is based on whether MFP is enabled/disabled at STA
and a firmware feature flag ATH10K_FW_FEATURE_MFP_SUPPORT. This is because
only firmwares 10.1.561 and above have support for MFP.
