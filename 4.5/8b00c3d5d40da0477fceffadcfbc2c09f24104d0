ncr5380: Implement new eh_abort_handler

Introduce a new eh_abort_handler implementation. This one attempts to
follow all of the rules relating to EH handlers. There is still a known
bug: during selection, a command becomes invisible to the EH handlers
because it only appears in a pointer on the stack of a different thread.
This bug is addressed in a subsequent patch.
