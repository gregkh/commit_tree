drm/i915: change no_fbc_reason from enum to string

I wanted to add yet another check to intel_fbc_update() and realized
I would need to create yet another enum no_fbc_reason case. So I
remembered this patch series that Damien wrote a long time ago and
nobody ever reviewed, so I decided to reimplement it since the code
changed a lot since then.
