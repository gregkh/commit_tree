KVM: x86: MMU: Make mmu_set_spte() return emulate value

mmu_set_spte()'s code is based on the assumption that the emulate
parameter has a valid pointer value if set_spte() returns true and
write_fault is not zero.  In other cases, emulate may be NULL, so a
NULL-check is needed.

Stop passing emulate pointer and make mmu_set_spte() return the emulate
value instead to clean up this complex interface.  Prefetch functions
can just throw away the return value.
