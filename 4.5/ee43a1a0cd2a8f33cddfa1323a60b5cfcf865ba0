ASoC: simple-card: don't fail if sysclk setting is not supported

Commit e22579713ae1 ("ASoC: simple card: set cpu-dai sysclk
with mclk-fs") added sysclk / SND_SOC_CLOCK_OUT setting, that makes
asoc_simple_card_hw_params fail if the operation is not supported,
although the intention clearly was to ignore ENOTSUPP. Fix it.

The patch fixes audio playback on Kirkwood / OpenRD client,
where the following errors are seen:

	asoc-simple-card sound: ASoC: machine hw_params failed: -524
	alsa-lib: /alsa-lib-1.0.28/src/pcm/pcm_hw.c:327:(snd_pcm_hw_hw_params) SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_PARAMS failed (-524): Unknown error 524
