VMW_PVSCSI: Fix the issue of DMA-API related warnings.

The driver is missing calls to pci_dma_mapping_error() after
performing the DMA mapping, which caused DMA-API warning to
show up in dmesg's output. Though that happens only when
DMA_API_DEBUG option is enabled. This change fixes the issue
and makes pvscsi_map_buffers() function more robust.
