bpf: export helper function flags and reject invalid ones

Export flags used by eBPF helper functions through UAPI, so they can be
used by programs (instead of them redefining all flags each time or just
using the hard-coded values). It also gives a better overview what flags
are used where and we can further get rid of the extra macros defined in
filter.c. Moreover, reject invalid flags.
