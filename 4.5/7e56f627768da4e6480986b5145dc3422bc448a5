powerpc/eeh: Fix PE location code

In eeh_pe_loc_get(), the PE location code is retrieved from the
"ibm,loc-code" property of the device node for the bridge of the
PE's primary bus. It's not correct because the property indicates
the parent PE's location code.

This reads the correct PE location code from "ibm,io-base-loc-code"
or "ibm,slot-location-code" property of PE parent bus's device node.
