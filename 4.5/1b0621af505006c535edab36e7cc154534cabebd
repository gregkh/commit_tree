[media] media: rc: ir-sharp-decoder: add support for Denon variant of the protocol

Denon also uses the Sharp protocol, however with different check bits.

It would have been also possible to add this as a separate protocol
but this may not be worth the effort.

Successfully tested with a Denon RC-1002 remote control.
