ntb: ntb perf tool

Providing raw performance data via a tool that directly access data from
NTB w/o any software overhead. This allows measurement of the hardware
performance limit. In revision one we are only doing single direction
CPU and DMA writes. Eventually we will provide bi-directional writes.

The measurement using DMA engine for NTB performance measure does
not measure the raw performance of DMA engine over NTB due to software
overhead. But it should provide the peak performance through the Linux DMA
driver.
