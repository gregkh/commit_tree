tipc: fix connection abort during subscription cancel

In 'commit 7fe8097cef5f ("tipc: fix nullpointer bug when subscribing
to events")', we terminate the connection if the subscription
creation fails.
In the same commit, the subscription creation result was based on
the value of the subscription pointer (set in the function) instead
of the return code.

Unfortunately, the same function tipc_subscrp_create() handles
subscription cancel request. For a subscription cancellation request,
the subscription pointer cannot be set. Thus if a subscriber has
several subscriptions and cancels any of them, the connection is
terminated.

In this commit, we terminate the connection based on the return value
of tipc_subscrp_create().
