rcu: Remove TINY_RCU bloat from pointless boot parameters

The rcu_expedited, rcu_normal, and rcu_normal_after_boot kernel boot
parameters are pointless in the case of TINY_RCU because in that case
synchronous grace periods, both expedited and normal, are no-ops.
However, these three symbols contribute several hundred bytes of bloat.
This commit therefore uses CPP directives to avoid compiling this code
in TINY_RCU kernels.
