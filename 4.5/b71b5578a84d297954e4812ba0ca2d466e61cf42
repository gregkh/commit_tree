HID: sony: Remove the size check for the Dualshock 4 HID Descriptor

Sony has modified the HID descriptor in new revisions of the Dualshock 4 which
causes the size check in the descriptor replacement function to fail.  Remove it
so that new revisions of the controller will work correctly.

The module is completely replacing the descriptor instead of patching it, so the
size check isn't really necessary anyways.
