kvm: x86: Update tsc multiplier on change.

vmx.c writes the TSC_MULTIPLIER field in vmx_vcpu_load, but only when a
vcpu has migrated physical cpus. Record the last value written and
update in vmx_vcpu_load on any change, otherwise a cpu migration must
occur for TSC frequency scaling to take effect.
