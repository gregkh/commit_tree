cxgb3: fix up vpd strings for kstrto*()

The vpd strings are left justified, in a fixed length array, with possible
trailing white space and no NUL.  So fix them up before calling kstrto*().

This is a recent regression which causes cxgb3 to fail to load.

Fixes: e72c932 ("cxgb3: Convert simple_strtoul to kstrtox")
