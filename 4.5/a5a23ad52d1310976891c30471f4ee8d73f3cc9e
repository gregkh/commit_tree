net: am79c961a: avoid %? in inline assembly

The am79c961a.c driver fails to build with clang because of an
unusual inline assembly construct:

drivers/net/ethernet/amd/am79c961a.c:53:7: error: invalid % escape in inline assembly string
 "str%?h        %1, [%2]        @ NET_RAP\n\t"

The same change has been done a decade ago in arch/arm as of
6a39dd6222dd ("[ARM] 3759/2: Remove uses of %?"), but apparently
some drivers were missed.
