lightnvm: allow to force mm initialization

System block allows the device to initialize with its configured media
manager. The system blocks is written to disk, and read again when media
manager is determined. For this to work, the backend must store the
data. Device drivers, such as null_blk, does not have any backend
storage. This patch allows the media manager to be initialized without a
storage backend.

It also fix incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk, as it
does not support get/set bad block interface.
