SCSI: fix crashes in sd and sr runtime PM

Runtime suspend during driver probe and removal can cause problems.
The driver's runtime_suspend or runtime_resume callbacks may invoked
before the driver has finished binding to the device or after the
driver has unbound from the device.

This problem shows up with the sd and sr drivers, and can cause disk
or CD/DVD drives to become unusable as a result.  The fix is simple.
The drivers store a pointer to the scsi_disk or scsi_cd structure as
their private device data when probing is finished, so we simply have
to be sure to clear the private data during removal and test it during
runtime suspend/resume.
