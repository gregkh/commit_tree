fsl/fman: Delete one function call "put_device" in dtsec_config()

The Coccinelle semantic patch script "deref_null.cocci" pointed a problem
out in the implementation of the function "dtsec_config".

A null pointer was assigned to the data structure member "tbiphy" of the
variable "dtsec" if a matching device was not found.
A call of the function "put_device" was unnecessary then because
a previous call of the function "get_device" was not triggered.
Thus remove the function call "put_device" after the printing of the
desired error message.
