watchdog: Use static struct class watchdog_class in stead of pointer

We need few sysfs attributes to know different status of a watchdog device.
To do that, we need to associate .dev_groups with watchdog_class. So
convert it from pointer to static.
Putting this static struct in watchdog_dev.c, so that static device
attributes defined in that file can be attached to it.
