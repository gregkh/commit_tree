Adding stateid information to tracepoints

Operations to which stateid information is added:
close, delegreturn, open, read, setattr, layoutget, layoutcommit, test_stateid,
write, lock, locku, lockt

Format is "stateid=<seqid>:<crc32 hash stateid.other>", also "openstateid=",
"layoutstateid=", and "lockstateid=" for open_file, layoutget, set_lock
tracepoints.

New function is added to internal.h, nfs_stateid_hash(), to compute the hash

trace_nfs4_setattr() is moved from nfs4_do_setattr() to _nfs4_do_setattr()
to get access to stateid.

trace_nfs4_setattr and trace_nfs4_delegreturn are changed from INODE_EVENT
to new event type, INODE_STATEID_EVENT which is same as INODE_EVENT but adds
stateid information

for locking tracepoints, moved trace_nfs4_set_lock() into _nfs4_do_setlk()
to get access to stateid information, and removed trace_nfs4_lock_reclaim(),
trace_nfs4_lock_expired() as they call into _nfs4_do_setlk() and both were
previously same LOCK_EVENT type.
