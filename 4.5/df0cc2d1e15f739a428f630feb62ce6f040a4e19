ASoC: samsung/smartq: use dynamic registration

As a prerequisite for moving s3c64xx into multiplatform configurations,
we need to change the smartq audio driver to stop using hardcoded
gpio numbers from the header file, and instead pass the gpio data
through platform_data.

In order to do that, we also move the code to use module_platform_driver
and register the platform device using platform_device_register_simple
and register the gpios through the gpiod API.
