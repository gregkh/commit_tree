netfilter: nf_conntrack: use safer way to lock all buckets

When we need to lock all buckets in the connection hashtable we'd attempt to
lock 1024 spinlocks, which is way more preemption levels than supported by
the kernel. Furthermore, this behavior was hidden by checking if lockdep is
enabled, and if it was - use only 8 buckets(!).

Fix this by using a global lock and synchronize all buckets on it when we
need to lock them all. This is pretty heavyweight, but is only done when we
need to resize the hashtable, and that doesn't happen often enough (or at all).
