device property: avoid allocations of 0 length

Arrays can not have zero elements by definition of the unified device
properties. If such property comes from outside we should not allow it to pass.
Otherwise memory allocation on 0 length will return non-NULL value, which we
currently don't check.

Prevent memory allocations of 0 length.
