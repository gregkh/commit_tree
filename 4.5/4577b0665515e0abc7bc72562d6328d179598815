nfit: update address range scrub commands to the acpi 6.1 format

The original format of these commands from the "NVDIMM DSM Interface
Example" [1] are superseded by the ACPI 6.1 definition of the "NVDIMM Root
Device _DSMs" [2].

[1]: http://pmem.io/documents/NVDIMM_DSM_Interface_Example.pdf
[2]: http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_6_1.pdf
     "9.20.7 NVDIMM Root Device _DSMs"

Changes include:
1/ New 'restart' fields in ars_status, unfortunately these are
   implemented in the middle of the existing definition so this change
   is not backwards compatible.  The expectation is that shipping
   platforms will only ever support the ACPI 6.1 definition.

2/ New status values for ars_start ('busy') and ars_status ('overflow').
