spi: davinci: fix spurious i/o error

davinci_spi_bufs() uses wait_for_completion_interruptible()
without bothering to handle -ERESTARTSYS. Due to this,
sometime, it returns prematurely when a signal is received.
Since the return value is never checked, userspace eventually
receives a spurious -EIO.

To fix this, use un-interruptible wait_for_completion_timeout().
