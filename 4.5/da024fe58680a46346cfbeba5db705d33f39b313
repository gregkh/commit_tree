drm/bridge: Improve kerneldoc

Especially document the assumptions and semantics of the callbacks
carefully. Just a warm-up excercise really.

v2: Spelling fixes (Eric).

v3: Consolidate more with existing docs:

- Remove the overview section explaining the bridge funcs, that's
  now all in the drm_bridge_funcs kerneldoc in much more detail.

- Use & to reference structs so that kerneldoc automatically inserts
  hyperlinks.

v4: Review from Thierry.
