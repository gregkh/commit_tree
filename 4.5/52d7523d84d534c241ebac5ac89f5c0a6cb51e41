arm64: mm: allow the kernel to handle alignment faults on user accesses

Although we don't expect to take alignment faults on access to normal
memory, misbehaving (i.e. buggy) user code can pass MMIO pointers into
system calls, leading to things like get_user accessing device memory.

Rather than OOPS the kernel, allow any exception fixups to run and
return something like -EFAULT back to userspace. This makes the
behaviour more consistent with userspace, even though applications with
access to device mappings can easily cause other issues if they try
hard enough.
