selinux: Inode label revalidation performance fix

Commit 5d226df4 has introduced a performance regression of about
10% in the UnixBench pipe benchmark.  It turns out that the call
to inode_security in selinux_file_permission can be moved below
the zero-mask test and that inode_security_revalidate can be
removed entirely, which brings us back to roughly the original
performance.
