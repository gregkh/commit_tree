net: hp100: remove unnecessary #ifdefs

Building the hp100 ethernet driver causes warnings when both the PCI
and EISA drivers are disabled:

ethernet/hp/hp100.c: In function 'hp100_module_init':
ethernet/hp/hp100.c:3047:2: warning: label 'out3' defined but not used [-Wunused-label]
ethernet/hp/hp100.c: At top level:
ethernet/hp/hp100.c:2828:13: warning: 'cleanup_dev' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

We can easily avoid the warnings and make the driver look slightly
nicer by removing the #ifdefs that check for the CONFIG_PCI and
CONFIG_EISA, as all the registration functions are designed to
have no effect when the buses are disabled.
