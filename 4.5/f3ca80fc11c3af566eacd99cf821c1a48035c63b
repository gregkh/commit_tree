nvme: move chardev and sysfs interface to common code

For this we need to add a proper controller init routine and a list of
all controllers that is in addition to the list of PCIe controllers,
which stays in pci.c.  Note that we remove the sysfs device when the
last reference to a controller is dropped now - the old code would have
kept it around longer, which doesn't make much sense.

This requires a new ->reset_ctrl operation to implement controleller
resets, and a new ->write_reg32 operation that is required to implement
subsystem resets.  We also now store caches copied of the NVMe compliance
version and the flag if a controller is attached to a subsystem or not in
the generic controller structure now.
