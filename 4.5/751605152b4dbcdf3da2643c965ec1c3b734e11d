h8300: Rename ctlr_out/in[bwl] to raw_read/write[bwl]

For the sake of consistency, let rename all ctrl_out/in calls to the write/read
calls so we have the same API consistent with the other architectures hence
open the door for the increasing of the test compilation coverage.

The unsigned long coercive cast is removed because all variables are set to
the right type "void __iomem *".
