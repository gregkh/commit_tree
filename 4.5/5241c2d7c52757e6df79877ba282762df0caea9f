ipv6: addrconf: drop ieee802154 specific things

This patch removes ARPHRD_IEEE802154 from addrconf handling. In the
earlier days of 802.15.4 6LoWPAN, the interface type was ARPHRD_IEEE802154
which introduced several issues, because 802.15.4 interfaces used the
same type.

Since commit 965e613d299c ("ieee802154: 6lowpan: fix ARPHRD to
ARPHRD_6LOWPAN") we use ARPHRD_6LOWPAN for 6LoWPAN interfaces. This
patch will remove ARPHRD_IEEE802154 which is currently deadcode, because
ARPHRD_IEEE802154 doesn't reach the minimum 1280 MTU of IPv6.

Also we use 6LoWPAN EUI64 specific defines instead using link-layer
constanst from 802.15.4 link-layer header.
