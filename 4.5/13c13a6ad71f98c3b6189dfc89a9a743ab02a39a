pNFS: Fix missing layoutreturn calls

The layoutreturn code currently relies on pnfs_put_lseg() to initiate the
RPC call when conditions are right. A problem arises when we want to
free the layout segment from inside an inode->i_lock section (e.g. in
pnfs_clear_request_commit()), since we cannot sleep.

The workaround is to move the actual call to pnfs_send_layoutreturn()
to pnfs_put_layout_hdr(), which doesn't have this restriction.
