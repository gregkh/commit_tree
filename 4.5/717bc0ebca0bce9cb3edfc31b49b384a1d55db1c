xfs: refactor in-core log state update to helper

Once the record at the head of the log is identified and verified, the
in-core log state is updated based on the record. This includes
information such as the current head block and cycle, the start block of
the last record written to the log, the tail lsn, etc.

Once torn write detection is conditional, this logic will need to be
reused. Factor the code to update the in-core log data structures into a
new helper function. This patch does not change behavior.
