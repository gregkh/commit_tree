ixgbe: Use __dev_uc_sync and __dev_uc_unsync for unicast addresses

This change replaces the ixgbe_write_uc_addr_list call in ixgbe_set_rx_mode
with a call to __dev_uc_sync instead.  This works much better with the MAC
addr list code that was already in place and solves an issue in which you
couldn't remove an FDB address without having to reset the port.
