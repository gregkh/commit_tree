net: bpf: reject invalid shifts

On ARM64, a BUG() is triggered in the eBPF JIT if a filter with a
constant shift that can't be encoded in the immediate field of the
UBFM/SBFM instructions is passed to the JIT.  Since these shifts
amounts, which are negative or >= regsize, are invalid, reject them in
the eBPF verifier and the classic BPF filter checker, for all
architectures.
