MIPS: ptrace: Drop cp0_tcstatus from regoffset_table[]

The cp0_tcstatus member of struct pt_regs was removed along with the
rest of SMTC in v3.16, commit b633648c5ad3 ("MIPS: MT: Remove SMTC
support"), however recent uprobes support in v4.3 added back a reference
to it in the regoffset_table[] in ptrace.c. Remove it.
