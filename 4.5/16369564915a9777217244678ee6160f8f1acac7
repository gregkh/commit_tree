ixgbe: Add support for VLAN promiscuous with SR-IOV

This patch adds support for VLAN promiscuous with SR-IOV enabled.

The code prior to this patch was only adding the PF to VLANs that the VF
had added.  As such enabling promiscuous mode would actually not add any
additional VLAN filters so visibility was limited.  This lead to a number
of issues as the bridge and OVS would expect us to accept all VLAN tagged
packets when promiscuous mode was enabled, and instead we would filter out
most if not all depending on the configuration of the PF.

With this patch what we do is set all the bits in the VFTA and all of the
VLVF bits associated with the pool belonging to the PF.  By doing this the
PF is guaranteed to receive all VLAN tagged traffic associated with the RAR
filters assigned to the PF.  In addition we will clean up those same bits
in the event of promiscuous mode being disabled.
