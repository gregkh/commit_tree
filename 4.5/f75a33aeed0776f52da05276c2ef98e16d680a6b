batman-adv: Delete an unnecessary check before the function call "batadv_softif_vlan_free_ref"

The batadv_softif_vlan_free_ref() function tests whether its argument is NULL
and then returns immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
