net: phy: Avoid polling PHY with PHY_IGNORE_INTERRUPTS

Commit 2c7b49212a86 ("phy: fix the use of PHY_IGNORE_INTERRUPT") changed
a hunk in phy_state_machine() in the PHY_RUNNING case which was not
needed. The change essentially makes the PHY library treat PHY devices
with PHY_IGNORE_INTERRUPT to keep polling for the PHY device, even
though the intent is not to do it.

Fix this by reverting that specific hunk, which makes the PHY state
machine wait for state changes, and stay in the PHY_RUNNING state for as
long as needed.
