i2c: designware: Convert to use unified device property API

With ACPI _DSD (introduced in ACPI v5.1) it is now possible to pass device
configuration information from ACPI in addition to DT. In order to support
this, convert the driver to use the unified device property accessors
instead of DT specific.

Change to ordering a bit so that we first try platform data and if that's
not available look from device properties. ACPI *CNT methods are then used
as last resort to override everything else.
