[media] omap3isp: rename single labels to just error

Commit bc36b30fe06b ("[media] omap3isp: separate links creation from
entities init") moved the link creation logic from the entities init
functions and so removed the error_link labels from the error paths.

But after that, some functions have a single error label so it makes
more sense to rename the label to just "error" in thi case.
