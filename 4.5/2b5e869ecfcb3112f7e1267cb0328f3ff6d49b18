MIPS: ELF: Interpret the NAN2008 file header flag

Handle the EF_MIPS_NAN2008 ELF file header flag and refuse execution
where there is no support in the FPU for the NaN encoding mode requested
by a binary invoked.  Ensure that the setting of the bit in the binary
matches one in any intepreter used.  Set the thread's initial FCSR
contents according to the value of the EF_MIPS_NAN2008.

Set the values of the FCSR ABS2008 and NAN2008 bits both to the same
value if possible, to take the approach taken with existing FPU hardware
into account.  As of now all implementations have both bits hardwired to
the same value, that is both are fixed at 0 or both are fixed at 1, even
though the architecture allows for implementations where the amount of
control implemented with each of these two individual bits is
independent of each other.
