ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable RSB and AXP20X related drivers as modules

axp20x support has been split into 2 parts, I2C and RSB interface
variants.

Update the MFD_AXP20X symbol for I2C support. Also enable SUNXI_RSB
MFD_AXP20X_RSB to support RSB variants. Build these drivers as
modules.

Keep MFD_AXP20X enabled for now, to ease migration for automated
boot farms while the patches are being merged. This should be
removed in the next release.
