PM: Avoid false-positive warnings in dev_pm_domain_set()

There is a WARN_ON() in dev_pm_domain_set() that triggers on attempts
to set the pm_domain pointer for devices with a driver bound.

However, that WARN_ON() triggers on attempts to clear the pointer
too and the test it uses is based on checking the device's
p->knode_driver pointer which still is set when the device bus
type's/driver's ->remove callback has been executed.  This
leads to false-positive warnings when bus type code calls
dev_pm_domain_set() to clear the pm_domain pointer after
invoking the driver's ->remove() callback.

To avoid those false-positives, make dev_pm_domain_set() check
if the pointer passed to it is NULL and skip the warning in
that case.
