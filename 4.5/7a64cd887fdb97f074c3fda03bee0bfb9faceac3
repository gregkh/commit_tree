drivers: android: correct the size of struct binder_uintptr_t for BC_DEAD_BINDER_DONE

There's one point was missed in the patch commit da49889deb34 ("staging:
binder: Support concurrent 32 bit and 64 bit processes."). When configure
BINDER_IPC_32BIT, the size of binder_uintptr_t was 32bits, but size of
void * is 64bit on 64bit system. Correct it here.
