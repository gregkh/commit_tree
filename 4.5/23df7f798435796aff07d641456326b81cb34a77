perf evlist: Make perf_evlist__open() open evsels with their cpus and threads (like perf record does)

'perf record' uses perf_evsel__open() to open events and passes the
evsel->cpus and evsel->threads.  Many tests and some tools instead use
perf_evlist__open() which passes instead evlist->cpus and
evlist->threads.

Make perf_evlist__open() follow the 'perf record' behaviour so that a
consistent approach is taken.
