irqchip/gicv3-its: Fix memory leak in its_free_tables()

The current ITS driver has a memory leak in its_free_tables(). It
happens on tear down path of the driver when its_probe() call fails.
its_free_tables() should free the exact number of pages that have
been allocated, not just a single page as current code does.

This patch records the memory size for each ITS_BASERn at the time of
page allocation and uses the same size information when freeing pages
to fix the issue.
