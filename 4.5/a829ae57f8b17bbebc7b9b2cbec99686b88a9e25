ARM: s3c64xx: use new adc/touchscreen driver

The old ADC and touchscreen drivers are not compatible with
multiplatform support, but we can use the exynos-adc driver
as a replacement.

This changes the common device creation functions for s3c64xx
(but not s3c24xx for now) to use the new driver. To do this,
we have to pass the interrupt resources in the opposite order
and pass the platform data in the adc device node.
