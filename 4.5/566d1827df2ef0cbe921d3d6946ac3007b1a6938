libata: disable forced PORTS_IMPL for >= AHCI 1.3

Some early controllers incorrectly reported zero ports in PORTS_IMPL
register and the ahci driver fabricates PORTS_IMPL from the number of
ports in those cases.  This hasn't mattered but with the new nvme
controllers there are cases where zero PORTS_IMPL is valid and should
be honored.

Disable the workaround for >= AHCI 1.3.
