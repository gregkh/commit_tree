KVM: s390: rewrite vcpu_post_run and drop out early

Let's rewrite this function to better reflect how we actually handle
exit_code. By dropping out early we can save a few cycles. This
especially speeds up sie exits caused by host irqs.

Also, let's move the special -EOPNOTSUPP for intercepts to
the place where it belongs and convert it to -EREMOTE.
