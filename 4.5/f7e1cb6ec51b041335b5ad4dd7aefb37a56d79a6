mm: memcontrol: account socket memory in unified hierarchy memory controller

Socket memory can be a significant share of overall memory consumed by
common workloads.  In order to provide reasonable resource isolation in
the unified hierarchy, this type of memory needs to be included in the
tracking/accounting of a cgroup under active memory resource control.

Overhead is only incurred when a non-root control group is created AND
the memory controller is instructed to track and account the memory
footprint of that group.  cgroup.memory=nosocket can be specified on the
boot commandline to override any runtime configuration and forcibly
exclude socket memory from active memory resource control.
