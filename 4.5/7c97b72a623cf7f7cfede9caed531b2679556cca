ath10k: allow Mesh Point to install peer security key

Mesh Point requires peer security key install when running
in secured mode since it's a type of peer links, otherwise peer
link will be removed due to key install failure.

MFP feature set is required to run Mesh in secured mode and
QCA988X firmware, 10.2.4.70.14-2 and above, is the only one
supporting secured Mesh at this moment.
