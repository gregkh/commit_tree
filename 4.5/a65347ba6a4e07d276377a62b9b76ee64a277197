drm/i915: add has_dsi_encoder to crtc state

DSI has quite a few special cases, like DP, so add it to crtc
state. This way we can get rid of a number of intel_pipe_has_type()
checks for DSI. This isn't necessarily the prettiest way, but it's a
step towards being aligned with what's being done with other encoders.
