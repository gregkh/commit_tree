rbtree: use READ_ONCE in RB_EMPTY_ROOT

With commit d72da4a4d97 ("rbtree: Make lockless searches non-fatal") our
rbtrees provide weak guarantees that allows us to do lockless (and very
speculative) reads of the tree.  Such readers cannot see partial stores
on nodes, ie left/right as well as root.  As such, similar to the
WRITE_ONCE semantics when doing rotations, use READ_ONCE when checking
the root node in RB_EMPTY_ROOT.
