RDMA/ocrdma: Fix arm logic to align with new cq API

Today ocrdma driver defer arming the CQ till poll is called.
This was used to prevent calling poll-cq on an armed CQ.

Recently a set of new CQ API has been introduced into the linux
kernel. The implementation of this API guarantees that a given
CQ is never armed before calling poll on it. Most of the kernel
ULPs have already moved to use this new API or have a code where
poll is called before arming the CQ.

Thus, the above workaround in ocrdma is not needed anymore.
This patch removes the additional logic to deffer arm till poll
is called. This patch adds a simple scheme where ib_req_notify_cq()
will actually arm the cq.
