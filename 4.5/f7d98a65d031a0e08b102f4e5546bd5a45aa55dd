leds: syscon: Make the driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/leds/Kconfig:config LEDS_SYSCON
drivers/leds/Kconfig:   bool "LED support for LEDs on system controllers"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.
