mac80211: allow the driver to send EOSP when needed

This can happen when the driver needs to send less frames
than expected and then needs to close the SP.
Mac80211 still needs to set the more_data properly based
on its buffer state (ps_tx_buffer and buffered frames on
other TIDs).
To that end, refactor the code that delivers frames upon
uAPSD trigger frames to be able to get only the more_data
bit without actually delivering those frames in case the
driver is just asking to set a NDP with EOSP and MORE_DATA
bit properly set.
