net/irda: bfin_sir: remove duplicate defines

The defconfig build of blackfin is failing with the error:

arch/blackfin/include/asm/bfin_serial.h:269:0: warning: "port_membase" redefined
drivers/net/irda/bfin_sir.h:85:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
arch/blackfin/include/asm/bfin_serial.h:382:0: warning: "get_lsr_cache" redefined
drivers/net/irda/bfin_sir.h:86:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
arch/blackfin/include/asm/bfin_serial.h:383:0: warning: "put_lsr_cache" redefined
drivers/net/irda/bfin_sir.h:87:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition

port_membase, get_lsr_cache, put_lsr_cache are already defined in the
architecture files, no need to define them again in the driver.
