i40e: hush little warnings

These messages seem big and scary, but they're really not. The driver
can fully recover from any of these. The overflow error in particular
can happen when enabling a bunch of VFs and the VF driver is not
blacklisted.

Since these messages are really for debugging purposes, reclassify
them as such.
