ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix support for multiple pins in a module

For supporting multiple dynamic pins, module state check is
incorrect. In case of unbind, module state need to be changed to
uninit if all pins in the module is is unbind state.
To handle module state correctly add pin state and use pin
state check to set module state correctly.
