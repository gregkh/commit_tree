drbd: Fix locking across all resources

Instead of using a rwlock for synchronizing state changes across
resources, take the request locks of all resources for global state
changes.  Use resources_mutex to serialize global state changes.

This means that taking the request lock of a resource is now enough to
prevent changes of that resource.  (Previously, a read lock on the
global state lock was needed as well.)
