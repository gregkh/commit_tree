libnvdimm, pfn: enable pfn sysfs interface unit testing

The unit test infrastructure uses CMA and real memory to emulate nvdimm
resources.  The call to devm_memremap_pages() can simply be mocked in
the same manner as memremap and we mock phys_to_pfn_t() to clear PFN_MAP
since these resources are not registered with in the pgmap_radix.
