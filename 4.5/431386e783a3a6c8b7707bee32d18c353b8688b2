iio: pressure: mpl115: fix temperature offset sign

According to the datasheet, the resolusion of temperature sensor is
-5.35 counts/C. Temperature ADC is 472 counts at 25C.
(https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Pressure/MPL115A1.pdf
NOTE: This is older revision, but this information is removed from the
latest datasheet from nxp somehow)

Temp [C] = (Tadc - 472) / -5.35 + 25
         = (Tadc - 605.750000) * -0.186915888

So the correct offset is -605.750000.
