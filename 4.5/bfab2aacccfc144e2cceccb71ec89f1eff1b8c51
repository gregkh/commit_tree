[media] media: use media_gobj inside entities

As entities are graph objects, let's embed media_gobj
on it. That ensures an unique ID for entities that can be
global along the entire media controller.

For now, we'll keep the already existing entity ID. Such
field need to be dropped at some point, but for now, let's
not do this, to avoid needing to review all drivers and
the userspace apps.
