cpufreq: intel_pstate: Account for non C0 time

The current function to calculate cpu utilization uses the average P-state
ratio (APerf/Mperf) scaled by the ratio of the current P-state to the
max available non-turbo one. This leads to an overestimation of
utilization which causes higher-performance P-states to be selected more
often and that leads to increased energy consumption.

This is a problem for low-power systems, so it is better to use a
different utilization calculation algorithm for them.

Namely, the Percent Busy value (or load) can be estimated as the ratio of the
MPERF counter that runs at a constant rate only during active periods (C0) to
the time stamp counter (TSC) that also runs (at the same rate) during idle.
That is:

Percent Busy = 100 * (delta_mperf / delta_tsc)

Use this algorithm for platforms with SoCs based on the Airmont and Silvermont
Atom cores.
