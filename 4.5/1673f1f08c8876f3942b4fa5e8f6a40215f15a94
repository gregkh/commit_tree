nvme: move block_device_operations and ns/ctrl freeing to common code

This moves the block_device_operations over to common code mostly
as-is.  The only change is that the ns and ctrl refcounting got some
small refcounting to have wrappers around the kref_put operations.

A new free_ctrl operation is added to allow the PCI driver to free
it's ressources on the final drop.
