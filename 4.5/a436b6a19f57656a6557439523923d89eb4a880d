PM / runtime: Add new helper for conditional usage count incrementation

Introduce a new runtime PM function, pm_runtime_get_if_in_use(),
that will increment the device's runtime PM usage counter and
return 1 if its status is RPM_ACTIVE and its usage counter
is greater than 0 at the same time (0 will be returned otherwise).

This is useful for things that should only be done if the device
is active (from the runtime PM perspective) and used by somebody
(as indicated by the usage counter) already and they are not worth
bothering otherwise.
