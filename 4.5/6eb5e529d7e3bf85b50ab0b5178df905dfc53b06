iwlwifi: pcie: build an A-MSDU using TSO core

When the op_mode sends an skb whose payload is bigger than
MSS, PCIe will create an A-MSDU out of it. PCIe assumes
that the skb that is coming from the op_mode can fit in one
A-MSDU. It is the op_mode's responsibility to make sure
that this guarantee holds.

Additional headers need to be built for the subframes.
The TSO core code takes care of the IP / TCP headers and
the driver takes care of the 802.11 subframe headers.

These headers are stored on a per-cpu page that is re-used
for all the packets handled on that same CPU. Each skb
holds a reference to that page and releases the page when
it is reclaimed. When the page gets full, it is released
and a new one is allocated.

Since any SKB that doesn't go through the fast-xmit path
of mac80211 will be segmented, we can assume here that the
packet is not WEP / TKIP and has a proper SNAP header.
