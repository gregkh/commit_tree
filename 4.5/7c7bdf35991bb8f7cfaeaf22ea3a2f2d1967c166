netfilter: nfnetlink: use original skbuff when acking batches

Since bd678e09dc17 ("netfilter: nfnetlink: fix splat due to incorrect
socket memory accounting in skbuff clones"), we don't manually attach
the sk to the skbuff clone anymore, so we have to use the original
skbuff from netlink_ack() which needs to access the sk pointer.
