[media] v4l: vsp1: use else if instead of continue when creating links

The for loop in the vsp1_create_entities() function that create the links,
checks the entity type and call the proper link creation function but then
it uses continue to force the next iteration of the loop to take place and
skipping code in between that creates links for different entities types.

It is more readable and easier to understand if the if else constructs is
used instead of the continue statement.
