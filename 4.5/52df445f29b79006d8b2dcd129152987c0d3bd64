i2c: rcar: revoke START request early

If we don't clear START generation as soon as possible, it may cause
another message to be generated, e.g. when receiving NACK in address
phase. To keep the race window as small as possible, we clear it right
at the beginning of the interrupt. We don't need any checks since we
always want to stop START and STOP generation on the next occasion after
we started it.

This patch improves the situation but sadly does not completely fix it.
It is still to be researched if we can do better given this HW design.
