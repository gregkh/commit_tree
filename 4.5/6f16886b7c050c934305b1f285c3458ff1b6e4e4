cpuidle: fix fallback mechanism for suspend to idle in absence of enter_freeze

Commit 51164251f5c3 "sched / idle: Drop default_idle_call() fallback
from call_cpuidle()" made find_deepest_state() return non-negative
value and check all the states with index > 0.  Also as a result,
find_deepest_state() returns 0 even when enter_freeze callbacks are not
implemented and enter_freeze_proper() is called which ends up crashing
the kernel.

This patch updates the check for index > 0 in cpuidle_enter_freeze and
cpuidle_idle_call(when idle_should_freeze is true) to restore the
suspend-to-idle functionality in absence of enter_freeze callback.
