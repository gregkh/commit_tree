xen/blkfront: split per device io_lock

After patch "xen/blkfront: separate per ring information out of device
info", per-ring data is protected by a per-device lock ('io_lock').

This is not a good way and will effect the scalability, so introduce a
per-ring lock ('ring_lock').

The old 'io_lock' is renamed to 'dev_lock' which protects the ->grants list and
->persistent_gnts_c which are shared by all rings.

Note that in 'blkfront_probe' the 'blkfront_info' is setup via kzalloc
so setting ->persistent_gnts_c to zero is not needed.
