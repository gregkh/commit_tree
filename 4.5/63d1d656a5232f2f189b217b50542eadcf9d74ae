cpufreq: intel_pstate: Account for IO wait time

In cases where we have many IOs, the global load becomes low and the
load algorithm will decrease the requested P-State. Because of that,
the IOs overheads will increase and impact the IO performances.

To improve IO bound work, we can count the io-wait time as busy time
in calculating CPU busy.

This change uses get_cpu_iowait_time_us() to obtain the IO wait time value
and converts time into number of cycles spent waiting on IO at the TSC
rate. At the moment, this trick is only used for Atom.
