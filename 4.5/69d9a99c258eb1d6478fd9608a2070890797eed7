NVMe: Move error handling to failed reset handler

This moves failed queue handling out of the namespace removal path and
into the reset failure path, fixing a hanging condition if the controller
fails or link down during del_gendisk. Previously the driver had to see
the controller as degraded prior to calling del_gendisk to setup the
queues to fail. But, if the controller happened to fail after this,
there was no task to end outstanding requests.

On failure, all namespace states are set to dead. This has capacity
revalidate to 0, and ends all new requests with error status.
