Btrfs: use linux/sizes.h to represent constants

We use many constants to represent size and offset value.  And to make
code readable we use '256 * 1024 * 1024' instead of '268435456' to
represent '256MB'.  However we can make far more readable with 'SZ_256MB'
which is defined in the 'linux/sizes.h'.

So this patch replaces 'xxx * 1024 * 1024' kind of expression with
single 'SZ_xxxMB' if 'xxx' is a power of 2 then 'xxx * SZ_1M' if 'xxx' is
not a power of 2. And I haven't touched to '4096' & '8192' because it's
more intuitive than 'SZ_4KB' & 'SZ_8KB'.
