perf stat record: Keep sample_type 0 for pipe session

For pipe sessions we need to keep sample_type zero, because script's
perf_evsel__check_attr is triggered by sample_type != 0, and the check
would fail on stat session.

I was tempted to keep it zero unconditionally, but the pipe session is
sufficient. In perf.data session we are guarded by HEADER_STAT feature.
