dmaengine: mv_xor: de-duplicate mv_chan_set_mode*()

When commit 6f166312c6ea2 ("dmaengine: mv_xor: add support for a38x
command in descriptor mode") added support for the descriptor mode
available in Marvell Armada 38x and later SoCs, it added a new
function mv_chan_set_mode_to_desc() which allows to configure a XOR
channel to get the specific operation to be done from each individual
DMA descriptor.

However, this function was mainly a duplicate of the existing
mv_chan_set_mode(), with just the operation being different.

This commit re-organizes the code into a single mv_chan_set_mode()
function, which takes the operation mode as argument, and the
mv_xor_channel_add() function decides whether to use
XOR_OPERATION_MODE_IN_DESC or XOR_OPERATION_MODE_XOR.
