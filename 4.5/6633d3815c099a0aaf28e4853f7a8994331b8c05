Revert "i40e: remove CONFIG_I40E_VXLAN"

This reverts commit 8fe269991aece394a7ed274f525d96c73f94109a.
The case where VXLAN is a module and i40e driver is inbuilt
will not be handled properly with this change since i40e
will have an undefined symbol vxlan_get_rx_port in it.

v2: Add a signed-off-by.
