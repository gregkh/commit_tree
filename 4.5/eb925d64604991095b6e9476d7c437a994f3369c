powerpc/xmon: Append linux_banner to exception information in xmon.

Currently if you are in xmon without an oops etc. to view the kernel
version you have to type "d $linux_banner" - not necessarily obvious. As
this is useful information, append to the output of "e" command.

Example output:
  $mon> e
  cpu 0x1: Vector: 0  at [c0000000f879ba80]
      pc: c000000000081718: sysrq_handle_xmon+0x68/0x80
      lr: c000000000081718: sysrq_handle_xmon+0x68/0x80
      sp: c0000000f879bbe0
