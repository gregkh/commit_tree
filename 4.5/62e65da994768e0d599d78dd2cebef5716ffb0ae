s390/cio: Remove unused inline assemblies

There is no longer a need to maintain two versions of the same inline
assembly - one with exception handling, and one without - so get rid of
the duplicates and adjust names accordingly. This applies to stsch_err
and msch_err which are now renamed to stsch and msch respectively,
while the original msch function is removed.
