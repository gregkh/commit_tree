drm: Fix drm_vblank_pre/post_modeset regression from Linux 4.4

Changes to drm_update_vblank_count() in Linux 4.4 broke the
behaviour of the pre/post modeset functions as the new update
code doesn't deal with hw vblank counter resets inbetween calls
to drm_vblank_pre_modeset an drm_vblank_post_modeset, as it
should.

This causes mistreatment of such hw counter resets as counter
wraparound, and thereby large forward jumps of the software
vblank counter which in turn cause vblank event dispatching
and vblank waits to fail/hang --> userspace clients hang.

This symptom was reported on radeon-kms to cause a infinite
hang of KDE Plasma 5 shell's login procedure, preventing users
from logging in.

Fix this by detecting when drm_update_vblank_count() is called
inside a pre->post modeset interval. If so, clamp valid vblank
increments to the safe values 0 and 1, pretty much restoring
the update behavior of the old update code of Linux 4.3 and
earlier. Also reset the last recorded hw vblank count at call
to drm_vblank_post_modeset() to be safe against hw that after
modesetting, dpms on etc. only fires its first vblank irq after
drm_vblank_post_modeset() was already called.
