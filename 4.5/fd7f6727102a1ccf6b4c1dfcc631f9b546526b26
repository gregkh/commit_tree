crypto: crc32c - Fix crc32c soft dependency

I don't think it makes sense for a module to have a soft dependency
on itself. This seems quite cyclic by nature and I can't see what
purpose it could serve.

OTOH libcrc32c calls crypto_alloc_shash("crc32c", 0, 0) so it pretty
much assumes that some incarnation of the "crc32c" hash algorithm has
been loaded. Therefore it makes sense to have the soft dependency
there (as crc-t10dif does.)
