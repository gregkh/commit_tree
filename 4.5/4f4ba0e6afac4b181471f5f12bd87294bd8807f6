perf tests: No need to set attr.sample_freq in the perf time to TSC test

We were asking for a 4kHz sample_freq, making the test fail needlessly
when the system reduced /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate
below that.

In this test we only look at the PERF_SAMPLE_TIME fields in PERF_RECORD_
meta events, no need to set sample_freq.

Thanks to Namhyung for suggesting that max_sample_rate could be the
reason for the test failure, seeing the 'perf test -vv' output I sent.

Before:

  # echo 1000 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate
  # perf test TSC
  45: Test converting perf time to TSC   : FAILED!

After:

  # perf test TSC
  45: Test converting perf time to TSC   : Ok
  # cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate
  1000
