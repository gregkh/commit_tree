i40evf: quoth the VF driver, Nevermore

If, upon a midnight dreary, the PF returns ERR_PARAM when the VF is
requesting resources, that's fatal. Either the firmware or NVM is badly,
badly misconfigured, or this VF has been disabled due to a previous VF
driver sending a bunch of bogus messages.

Either way, there is no recovery from this. Don't ponder weak and weary,
just quit.
