KVM: x86: MMU: Use for_each_rmap_spte macro instead of pte_list_walk()

As kvm_mmu_get_page() was changed so that every parent pointer would not
get into the sp->parent_ptes chain before the entry pointed to by it was
set properly, we can use the for_each_rmap_spte macro instead of
pte_list_walk().
