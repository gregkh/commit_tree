serial: sh-sci: Correct SCIF type on R-Car for BRG

The "renesas,scif" compatible value is currently used for the SCIF
variant in all Renesas SoCs of the R-Car family.  However, the variant
used in the R-Car family is not the common "SH-4(A)" variant, but a
derivative with added "Baud Rate Generator for External Clock" (BRG),
which is also present in sh7734.

Use the family-specific SCIF compatible values for R-Car Gen1, Gen2, and
Gen3 SoCs to differentiate.  The "renesas,scif" compatible value can
still be used as a common denominator for SCIF variants with the
"SH-4(A)" register layout (i.e. ignoring the "Serial Extension Mode
Register" (SCEMR) and the new BRG-specific registers).
