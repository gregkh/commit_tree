vxlan, gre, geneve: Set a large MTU on ovs-created tunnel devices

Prior to 4.3, openvswitch tunnel vports (vxlan, gre and geneve) could
transmit vxlan packets of any size, constrained only by the ability to
send out the resulting packets.  4.3 introduced netdevs corresponding
to tunnel vports.  These netdevs have an MTU, which limits the size of
a packet that can be successfully encapsulated.  The default MTU
values are low (1500 or less), which is awkwardly small in the context
of physical networks supporting jumbo frames, and leads to a
conspicuous change in behaviour for userspace.

Instead, set the MTU on openvswitch-created netdevs to be the relevant
maximum (i.e. the maximum IP packet size minus any relevant overhead),
effectively restoring the behaviour prior to 4.3.
