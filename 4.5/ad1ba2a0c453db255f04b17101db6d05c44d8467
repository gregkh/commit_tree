btrfs: Use direct way to determine raid56 write/recover mode

Old code used bbio->raid_map to determine whether in raid56
write/recover operation, because we didn't't have bbio->map_type.

Now we have direct way for this condition, rid of using
the function-relative data, and make the code more readable.
