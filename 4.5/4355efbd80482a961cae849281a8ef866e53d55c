modules: fix modparam async_probe request

Commit f2411da746985 ("driver-core: add driver module
asynchronous probe support") added async probe support,
in two forms:

  * in-kernel driver specification annotation
  * generic async_probe module parameter (modprobe foo async_probe)

To support the generic kernel parameter parse_args() was
extended via commit ecc8617053e0 ("module: add extra
argument for parse_params() callback") however commit
failed to f2411da746985 failed to add the required argument.

This causes a crash then whenever async_probe generic
module parameter is used. This was overlooked when the
form in which in-kernel async probe support was reworked
a bit... Fix this as originally intended.
