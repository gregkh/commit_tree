ravb: use clock rate as basis for GTI.TIV

The GTI.TIV may be set to 2GHz^2 / rate, where rate is
that of the clock of the device. Rather than assuming a
rate of 130MHz use the actual rate of the clock.

The motivation for this is to use the correct rate on
the r8a7795/Salvator-X which is advertised as 133MHz but
may differ depending on the extal present on the Salvator-X.
