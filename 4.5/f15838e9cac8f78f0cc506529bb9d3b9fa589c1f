powerpc: Fix dedotify for binutils >= 2.26

Since binutils 2.26 BFD is doing suffix merging on STRTAB sections.  But
dedotify modifies the symbol names in place, which can also modify
unrelated symbols with a name that matches a suffix of a dotted name.  To
remove the leading dot of a symbol name we can just increment the pointer
into the STRTAB section instead.

Backport to all stables to avoid breakage when people update their
binutils - mpe.
