perf top: Create the evlist sooner

This is a preparation to support dynamic sort keys for tracepoint
events.  Dynamic sort keys can be created for specific fields in trace
events so it needs the event information, so we need to pass the evlist
to the sort routines, create it sooner so that the next patch can do
that.
