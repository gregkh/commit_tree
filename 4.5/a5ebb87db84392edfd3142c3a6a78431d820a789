Revert "mmc: block: don't use parameter prefix if built as module"

This reverts commit 829b6962f7e3cfc06f7c5c26269fd47ad48cf503.

Revert this change as it causes a sysfs path to change and therefore
introduces and ABI regression. More precisely Android's vold is not being
able to access /sys/module/mmcblk/parameters/perdev_minors any more, since
the path becomes changed to: "/sys/module/mmc_block/..."

module")
