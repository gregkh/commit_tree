s390/dasd: fix diag 0x250 inline assembly

git commit 1ec2772e0c3c ("s390/diag: add a statistic for diagnose
calls") added function calls to gather diagnose statistics.

In case of the dasd diag driver the function call was added between a
register asm statement which initialized register r2 and the inline
assembly itself.  The function call clobbers the contents of register
r2 and therefore the diag 0x250 call behaves in a more or less random
way.

Fix this by extracting the function call into a separate function like
we do everywhere else.
