x86/mm/64: Enable SWIOTLB if system has SRAT memory regions above MAX_DMA32_PFN

when memory hotplug enabled system is booted with less
than 4GB of RAM and then later more RAM is hotplugged
32-bit devices stop functioning with following error:

 nommu_map_single: overflow 327b4f8c0+1522 of device mask ffffffff

the reason for this is that if x86_64 system were booted
with RAM less than 4GB, it doesn't enable SWIOTLB and
when memory is hotplugged beyond MAX_DMA32_PFN, devices
that expect 32-bit addresses can't handle 64-bit addresses.

Fix it by tracking max possible PFN when parsing
memory affinity structures from SRAT ACPI table and
enable SWIOTLB if there is hotpluggable memory
regions beyond MAX_DMA32_PFN.

It fixes KVM guests when they use emulated devices
(reproduces with ata_piix, e1000 and usb devices,
 RHBZ: 1275941, 1275977, 1271527)

It also fixes the HyperV, VMWare with emulated devices
which are affected by this issue as well.
