drm/dp/mst: move GUID storage from mgr, port to only mst branch

Previous implementation does not handle case below: boot up one MST branch
to DP connector of ASIC. After boot up, hot plug 2nd MST branch to DP output
of 1st MST, GUID is not created for 2nd MST branch. When downstream port of
2nd MST branch send upstream request, it fails because 2nd MST branch GUID
is not available.

New Implementation: only create GUID for MST branch and save it within Branch.
