perf top: Cleanup condition in perf_top__record_precise_ip()

The 'he' cannot be NULL since it's caller hist_iter__top_callback() is
called only if iter->he is not NULL (see hist_entry_iter__add).  So
setting 'sym' before the condition to simplify the code.

Also make it clearer that the top->symbol_filter_entry check is only
meaningful on stdio mode (i.e. when use_browser is 0).
