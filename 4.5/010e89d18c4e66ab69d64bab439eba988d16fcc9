ncr5380: Standardize work queueing algorithm

The complex main_running/queue_main mechanism is peculiar to
atari_NCR5380.c. It isn't SMP safe and offers little value given that
the work queue already offers concurrency management. Remove this
complexity to bring atari_NCR5380.c closer to NCR5380.c.

It is not a good idea to call the information transfer state machine from
queuecommand because, according to Documentation/scsi/scsi_mid_low_api.txt
that could happen in soft irq context. Fix this.
