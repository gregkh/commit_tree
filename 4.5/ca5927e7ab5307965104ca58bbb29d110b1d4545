lightnvm: introduce mlc lower page table mappings

NAND MLC memories have both lower and upper pages. When programming,
both of these must be written, before data can be read. However,
these lower and upper pages might not placed at even and odd flash
pages, but can be skipped. Therefore each flash memory has its lower
pages defined, which can then be used when programming and to know when
padding are necessary.

This patch implements the lower page definition in the specification,
and exposes it through a simple lookup table at dev->lptbl.
