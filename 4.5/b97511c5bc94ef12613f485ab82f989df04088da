perf tools: Add overhead/overhead_children keys defaults via string

We currently set 'overhead' and 'overhead_children' as default sort keys
within perf_hpp__init function by directly adding into the sort list.

This patch adds 'overhead' and 'overhead_children' in text form into
sort_keys and let them be added by standard sort dimension interface.

We need to eliminate dirrect sort_list additions to be able to add
support for hists specific sort keys.
