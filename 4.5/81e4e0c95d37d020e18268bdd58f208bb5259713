drm/i915: Send TP1 TP2/3 even when panel claims no NO_TRAIN_ON_EXIT.

On the commit 3301d4092106 ("drm/i915: PSR: Fix DP_PSR_NO_TRAIN_ON_EXIT logic")'
we already had identified that DP_PSR_NO_TRAIN_ON_EXIT
doesn't mean we shouldn't send TPS patterns, however we start sending the
minimal TP1 as possible and no TP2.

For most of the panels this is ok, but we found a reported case where
this is not true and panel keeps frozen without updating the screen for a while.

We could just get this case after patch "PSR: Don't Skip aux handshake on
DP_PSR_NO_TRAIN_ON_EXIT." is applied since that one fix the
hard freeze on this kind of panels.
