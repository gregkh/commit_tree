arm64: mm: allow sections for unaligned bases

Callees of __create_mapping may decide to create section mappings if
sufficient low bits of the physical and virtual addresses they were
passed are zero. While __create_mapping rounds the virtual base address
down, it does not similarly round the physical base address down, and
hence non-zero bits in the physical address can prevent use of a section
mapping, even where a whole next-level table would be used instead.

Round down the physical base address in __create_mapping to enable all
callees to always create section mappings when such a mapping is
possible.
