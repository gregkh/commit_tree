[media] media: move mdev list init to gobj

Let's control the topology changes inside the graph_object. So, move the
addition and removal of interfaces/entities from the mdev lists to
media_gobj_init() and media_gobj_remove().

The main reason is that mdev should have lists for all object types, as
the new MC api will require to store objects in separate places.
