ftrace/module: remove ftrace module notifier

Remove the ftrace module notifier in favor of directly calling
ftrace_module_enable() and ftrace_release_mod() in the module loader.
Hard-coding the function calls directly in the module loader removes
dependence on the module notifier call chain and provides better
visibility and control over what gets called when, which is important
to kernel utilities such as livepatch.

This fixes a notifier ordering issue in which the ftrace module notifier
(and hence ftrace_module_enable()) for coming modules was being called
after klp_module_notify(), which caused livepatch modules to initialize
incorrectly. This patch removes dependence on the module notifier call
chain in favor of hard coding the corresponding function calls in the
module loader. This ensures that ftrace and livepatch code get called in
the correct order on patch module load and unload.
