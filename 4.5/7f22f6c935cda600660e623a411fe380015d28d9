tty: Retry failed reopen if tty teardown in-progress

A small window exists where a tty reopen will observe the tty
just prior to imminent teardown (tty->count == 0); in this case, open()
returns EIO to userspace.

Instead, retry the open after checking for signals and yielding;
this interruptible retry loop allows teardown to commence and initialize
a new tty on retry. Never retry the BSD master pty reopen; there is no
guarantee the pty pair teardown is imminent since the slave file
descriptors may remain open indefinitely.
