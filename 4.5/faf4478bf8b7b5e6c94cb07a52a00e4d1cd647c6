net/mlx5e: Provide correct packet/bytes statistics

Using the HW VPort counters for traffic (rx/tx packets/bytes)
statistics is wrong. This is because frames dropped due to steering or
out of buffer will be counted as received. To fix that, we move to use
the packet/bytes accounting done by the driver for what the netdev
reports out.
