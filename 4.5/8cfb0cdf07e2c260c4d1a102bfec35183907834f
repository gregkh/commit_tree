ACPI / debugger: Add IO interface to access debugger functionalities

This patch adds /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/acpidbg, which can be used by
userspace programs to access ACPICA debugger functionalities.

Known issue:
1. IO flush support
   acpi_os_notify_command_complete() and acpi_os_wait_command_ready() can
   be used by acpi_dbg module to implement .flush() filesystem operation.
   While this patch doesn't go that far. It then becomes userspace tool's
   duty now to flush old commands before executing new batch mode commands.
