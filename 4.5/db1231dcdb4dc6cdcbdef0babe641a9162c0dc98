powerpc: Fix DSCR inheritance over fork()

Two DSCR tests have a hack in them:

	/*
	 * XXX: Force a context switch out so that DSCR
	 * current value is copied into the thread struct
	 * which is required for the child to inherit the
	 * changed value.
	 */
	sleep(1);

We should not be working around this in the testcase, it is a kernel bug.
Fix it by copying the current DSCR to the child, instead of what we
had in the thread struct at last context switch.
