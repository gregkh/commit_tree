fm10k: Cleanup exception handling for mailbox interrupt

This patch addresses two issues.

First is the fact that the fm10k_mbx_free_irq was assuming msix_entries was
valid and that will not always be the case.  As such we need to add a check
for if it is NULL.

Second is the fact that we weren't freeing the IRQ if the mailbox API
returned an error on trying to connect.
