crypto: atmel-aes - fix the counter overflow in CTR mode

Depending on its hardware version, the AES IP provides either a 16 or a
32 bit counter. However the CTR mode expects the size of the counter to be
the same as the size of the cipher block, ie 128 bits for AES.
This patch detects and handles counter overflows.
