block: defer timeouts to a workqueue

Timer context is not very useful for drivers to perform any meaningful abort
action from.  So instead of calling the driver from this useless context
defer it to a workqueue as soon as possible.

Note that while a delayed_work item would seem the right thing here I didn't
dare to use it due to the magic in blk_add_timer that pokes deep into timer
internals.  But maybe this encourages Tejun to add a sensible API for that to
the workqueue API and we'll all be fine in the end :)

Contains a major update from Keith Bush:

"This patch removes synchronizing the timeout work so that the timer can
 start a freeze on its own queue. The timer enters the queue, so timer
 context can only start a freeze, but not wait for frozen."
