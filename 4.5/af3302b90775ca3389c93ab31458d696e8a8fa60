Revert "drm/i915: Extend LRC pinning to cover GPU context writeback"

This reverts commit 6d65ba943a2d1e4292a07ca7ddb6c5138b9efa5d.

Mika Kuoppala traced down a use-after-free crash in module unload to
this commit, because ring->last_context is leaked beyond when the
context gets destroyed. Mika submitted a quick fix to patch that up in
the context destruction code, but that's too much of a hack.

The right fix is instead for the ring to hold a full reference onto
it's last context, like we do for legacy contexts.

Since this is causing a regression in BAT it gets reverted before we
can close this.
