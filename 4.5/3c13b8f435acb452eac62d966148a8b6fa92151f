KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v3: Make the LR indexing macro public

We store GICv3 LRs in reverse order so that the CPU can save/restore
them in rever order as well (don't ask why, the design is crazy),
and yet generate memory traffic that doesn't completely suck.

We need this macro to be available to the C version of save/restore.
