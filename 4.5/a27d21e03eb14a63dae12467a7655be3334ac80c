irqchip/gic: Kconfig the number of instances

There is currently a hack in the GIC driver making it possible
to pass the number of GIC instances from the platform-specific
include files and thus override the variable MAX_GIC_NR.

With multiplatform deployments, this will not work as we need
to get rid of the platform-specific include files.

It turns out that this feature is only used by the RealView
platform which has a cascaded GIC. So move the configuration
to Kconfig and bump to 2 instances if we're building for the
RealView. The include file hacks can then be removed.

Tested on the ARM PB11MPCore with its cascaded GIC.
