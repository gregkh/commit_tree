tty: amba-pl011: add register accessor functions

Add register accessor functions to amba-pl011.  Much of this
transformation was done using the sed expression below, with any
left-overs fixed up manually afterwards, and code formatted to remain
within coding style.

s/readw(\(uap->port.membase\|regs\|port->membase\) +/pl011_read(\1,/g
s/writew(\(.*\) +/pl011_write(\1,/g
