batman-adv: Only put gw_node list reference when removed

The batadv_gw_node reference counter in batadv_gw_node_update can only be
reduced when the list entry was actually removed. Otherwise the reference
counter may reach zero when batadv_gw_node_update is called from two
different contexts for the same gw_node but only one context is actually
removing the entry from the list.

The release function for this gw_node is not called inside the list_lock
spinlock protected region because the function batadv_gw_node_update still
holds a gw_node reference for the object pointer on the stack. Thus the
actual release function (when required) will be called only at the end of
the function.
