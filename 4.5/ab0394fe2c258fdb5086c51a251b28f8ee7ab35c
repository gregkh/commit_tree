net/mlx5e: Fix LRO modify

Ethtool LRO enable/disable is broken, as of today we only modify TCP
TIRs in order to apply the requested configuration.

Hardware requires that all TIRs pointing to the same RQ should share the
same LRO configuration. For that all other TIRs' LRO fields must be
modified as well.
