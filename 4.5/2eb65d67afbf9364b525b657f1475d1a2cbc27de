ALSA: dice: expand timeout to wait for Dice notification

Some users have reported that their Dice based models generate ETIMEDOUT
when starting PCM playback. It means that current timeout (=100msec) is
not enough for their models to transfer notifications.

This commit expands the timeout up to 2 sec. As a result, in a worst case,
any operations to start AMDTP streams takes 2 sec or more. Then, in
userspace, snd_pcm_hw_params(), snd_pcm_prepare(), snd_pcm_recover(),
snd_rawmidi_open(), snd_seq_connect_from() and snd_seq_connect_to() may
take the time.
