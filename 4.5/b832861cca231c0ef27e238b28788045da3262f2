fs/block_dev.c:bdev_write_page(): use blk_queue_enter(..., GFP_NOIO)

bdev_write_page() is used by swapout and by writepage where we cannot
use __GFP_FS or __GFP_IO.  So it is misleading to mention GFP_KERNEL
here.

blk_queue_enter() only actually looks at __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM, so no
bugs were harmed in the making of this patch.
