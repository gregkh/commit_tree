block: Add badblock management for gendisks

NVDIMM devices, which can behave more like DRAM rather than block
devices, may develop bad cache lines, or 'poison'. A block device
exposed by the pmem driver can then consume poison via a read (or
write), and cause a machine check. On platforms without machine
check recovery features, this would mean a crash.

The block device maintaining a runtime list of all known sectors that
have poison can directly avoid this, and also provide a path forward
to enable proper handling/recovery for DAX faults on such a device.

Use the new badblock management interfaces to add a badblocks list to
gendisks.
