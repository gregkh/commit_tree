namei: ->d_inode of a pinned dentry is stable only for positives

both do_last() and walk_component() risk picking a NULL inode out
of dentry about to become positive, *then* checking its flags and
seeing that it's not negative anymore and using (already stale by
then) value they'd fetched earlier.  Usually ends up oopsing soon
after that...
