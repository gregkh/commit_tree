dmaengine: dw: fix cyclic transfer setup

Commit 61e183f83069 ("dmaengine/dw_dmac: Reconfigure interrupt and
chan_cfg register on resume") moved some channel initialisation to
a new function which must be called before starting a transfer.

This updates dw_dma_cyclic_start() to use dwc_dostart() like the other
modes, thus ensuring dwc_initialize() gets called and removing some code
duplication.
