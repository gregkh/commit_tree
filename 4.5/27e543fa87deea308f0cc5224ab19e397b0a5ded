[media] media: add functions to allow creating interfaces

Interfaces are different than entities: they represent a
Kernel<->userspace interaction, while entities represent a
piece of hardware/firmware/software that executes a function.

Let's distinguish them by creating a separate structure to
store the interfaces.

Later patches should change the existing drivers and logic
to split the current interface embedded inside the entity
structure (device nodes) into a separate object of the graph.
