Revert "regulator: tps65217: remove tps65217.dtsi file"

This reverts commit 8e6ebfaa9b384088002baa10f7534efa73a0794e.

Without the patch reverted regulators will not work. This prevents
MMC to be working for example so the boards can not boot to
MMC rootfs.

Tested it on beaglebone white and bisect also points to the
reverted commit.
The issue can be also fixed by adding "regulator-compatible =" to all board
dts file for the regulators.
