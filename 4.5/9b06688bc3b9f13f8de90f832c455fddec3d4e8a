xprtrdma: Fix additional uses of spin_lock_irqsave(rb_lock)

Clean up.

rb_lock critical sections added in rpcrdma_ep_post_extra_recv()
should have first been converted to use normal spin_lock now that
the reply handler is a work queue.

The backchannel set up code should use the appropriate helper
instead of open-coding a rb_recv_bufs list add.

Problem introduced by glib patch re-ordering on my part.
