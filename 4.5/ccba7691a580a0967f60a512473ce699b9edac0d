drm/amdgpu: add EDC support for CZ (v3)

This adds EDC support for CZ.
EDC = Error Correction and Detection
This code properly initializes the EDC hardware and
resets the error counts.  This is done in late_init
since it requires the IB pool which is not initialized
during hw_init.

v2: fix the IB size as noted by Felix, fix shader pgm
register programming
v3: use the IB for the shaders as suggested by Christian
