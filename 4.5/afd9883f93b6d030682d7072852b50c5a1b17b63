mm, proc: adjust PSS calculation

The goal of this patchset is to make refcounting on THP pages cheaper
with simpler semantics and allow the same THP compound page to be mapped
with PMD and PTEs.  This is required to get reasonable THP-pagecache
implementation.

With the new refcounting design it's much easier to protect against
split_huge_page(): simple reference on a page will make you the deal.
It makes gup_fast() implementation simpler and doesn't require
special-case in futex code to handle tail THP pages.

It should improve THP utilization over the system since splitting THP in
one process doesn't necessary lead to splitting the page in all other
processes have the page mapped.

The patchset drastically lower complexity of get_page()/put_page()
codepaths.  I encourage people look on this code before-and-after to
justify time budget on reviewing this patchset.

This patch (of 37):

With new refcounting all subpages of the compound page are not necessary
have the same mapcount.  We need to take into account mapcount of every
sub-page.
