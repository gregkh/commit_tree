Input: psmouse - limit protocols that we try on passthrough ports

PS/2 protocol is slow, and using it with pass-through port (where we
encapsulate PS/2 into PS/2) is slower yet so it takes quite a bit of time
to do full protocol discovery for device attached to a pass-through port.
However, so far we have not see anything but trackpoints or basic PS/2
mice on pass-through ports, so let's limit protocols that we probe there
to Trackpoint, IntelliMouse Explorer, IntelliMouse, and bare PS/2 protocol,
and avoid other extended protocols, such as Synaptics, ALPS, etc.
