null_blk: oops when initializing without lightnvm

If the LightNVM subsystem is not compiled into the kernel, and the
null_blk device driver requests lightnvm to be initialized. The call to
nvm_register fails and the null_add_dev function cleans up the
initialization. However, at this point the null block device has
already been added to the nullb_list and thus a second cleanup will
occur when the function has returned, that leads to a double call to
blk_cleanup_queue.
