kconfig: return 'false' instead of 'no' in bool function

menu_is_visible() is a bool function and should use boolean return
values. "no" is a tristate value which happens to also have a value
of 0, but we should nevertheless use the right symbol for it.

This is a very minor cleanup with no semantic change.
