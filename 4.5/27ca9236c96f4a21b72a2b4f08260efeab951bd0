perf/core: Remove the bogus and dangerous CPU_DOWN_FAILED hotplug state

If CPU_DOWN_PREPARE fails the perf hotplug notifier is called for
CPU_DOWN_FAILED and calls perf_event_init_cpu(), which checks whether the
swhash is referenced. If yes it allocates a new hash and stores the pointer in
the per cpu data structure.

But at this point the cpu is still online, so there must be a valid hash
already. By overwriting the pointer the existing hash is not longer
accessible.

Remove the CPU_DOWN_FAILED state, as there is nothing to (re)allocate.
