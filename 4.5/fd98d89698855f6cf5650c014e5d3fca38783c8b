RDMA/ocrdma: Initialize stats resources in the driver before ib device registration.

In the latest kernel, process_mad hook of the driver can be invoked as
soon as device is registered. In this hook, ocrdma driver is issuing a
command to get the stats counters from the HW. This is triggering system
crash since the statistics command resources are not allocated by the driver.
Changing the sequence of initialization to avoid this crash.
