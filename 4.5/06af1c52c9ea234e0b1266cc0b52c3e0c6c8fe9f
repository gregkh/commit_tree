lz4: fix wrong compress buffer size for 64-bits

The current lz4 compress buffer is 16kb on 32-bits, 32kb on 64-bits
system.  But, lz4 needs only 16kb on both.  On 64-bits, this causes
wasted cpu cycles for additional memset during every compression.

In case of lz4hc, the current buffer size is (256kb + 8) on 32-bits,
(512kb + 16) on 64-bits.  But, lz4hc needs only (256kb + 2 * pointer) on
both.

This patch fixes these wrong compress buffer sizes for 64-bits.
