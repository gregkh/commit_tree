scsi_debug: Increase the reported optimal transfer length

The OPTIMAL TRANSFER LENGTH reported by scsi_debug is 64 blocks which
translates to 32KB with the default logical block size. That's much
lower than what real storage devices typically report (256KB to 1MB).

Bump the optimal transfer length to 1024 blocks.
