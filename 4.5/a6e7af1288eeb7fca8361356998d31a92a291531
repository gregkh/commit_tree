xen-blkback: clear PF_NOFREEZE for xen_blkif_schedule()

xen_blkif_schedule() kthread calls try_to_freeze() at the beginning of
every attempt to purge the LRU. This operation can't ever succeed though,
as the kthread hasn't marked itself as freezable.

Before (hopefully eventually) kthread freezing gets converted to fileystem
freezing, we'd rather mark xen_blkif_schedule() freezable (as it can
generate I/O during suspend).
