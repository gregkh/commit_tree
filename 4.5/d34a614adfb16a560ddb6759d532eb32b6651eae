ixgbevf: Handle extended IPv6 headers in Tx path

Check for and handle IPv6 extended headers so that Tx checksum
offload can be done. Also use skb_checksum_help for unexpected
cases. Thanks to Tom Herbert for noticing these problems. Thanks
to Alexander Duyck for seeing how to coalesce the error handling
into one location.
