drivers/cpuidle: make cpuidle-exynos.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

cpuidle/Kconfig.arm:config ARM_EXYNOS_CPUIDLE
cpuidle/Kconfig.arm:    bool "Cpu Idle Driver for the Exynos processors"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.
