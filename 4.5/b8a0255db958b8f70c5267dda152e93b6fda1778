include/linux/poison.h: use POISON_POINTER_DELTA for poison pointers

TIMER_ENTRY_STATIC and TAIL_MAPPING are defined as poison pointers which
should point to nowhere.  Redefine them using POISON_POINTER_DELTA
arithmetics to make sure they really point to non-mappable area declared
by the target architecture.
