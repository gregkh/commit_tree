ALSA: timer: Sync timer deletion at closing the system timer

ALSA timer core framework has no sync point at stopping because it's
called inside the spinlock.  Thus we need a sync point at close for
avoiding the stray timer task.  This is simply done by implementing
the close callback just calling del_timer_sync().  (It's harmless to
call it unconditionally, as the core timer itself cares of the already
deleted timer instance.)
