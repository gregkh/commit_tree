clk: mmp: stop using platform headers

The mmp clock drivers currently hardcode the physical addresses for
the clock registers. This is generally a bad idea, and it also gets in
the way of multiplatform builds, which make the platform header files
inaccessible to device drivers.

To work around the header file problem, this patch changes the calling
convention so the three mmp clock drivers get initialized with the base
addresses as arguments from the platform code.

It would still be useful to have a larger rework of the clock drivers,
with DT integration to let the clocks actually be probed automatically,
and the base addresses passed as DT properties. I am unsure if anyone
is still interested in the mmp platform, so it is possible that this
won't happen.
