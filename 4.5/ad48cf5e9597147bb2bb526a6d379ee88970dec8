Input: goodix - add axis swapping and axis inversion support

Implement support for the following device-tree and ACPI 5.1 DSD
properties in the goodix touchscreen driver:

 - touchscreen-inverted-x:  X axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-inverted-y:  Y axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-swapped-x-y: X and Y axis are swapped (boolean)

These are necessary on tablets which have a display in portrait
format while the touchscreen is in landscape format, such as e.g.
the MSI Primo 81.
