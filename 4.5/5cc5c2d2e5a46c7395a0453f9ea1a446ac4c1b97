bnx2x: fix sending VF->PF messages on big-endian

When a VF is sending a message to the PF, it needs to trigger the PF
to tell it the message is ready.
The trigger did not work on ppc64. No interrupt appeared in the PF.

The bug is due to confusion about the layout of struct trigger_vf_zone.
In bnx2x_send_msg2pf() the trigger is written using writeb(), not
writel(), so the attempt to define the struct with a reversed layout on
big-endian is counter-productive.
