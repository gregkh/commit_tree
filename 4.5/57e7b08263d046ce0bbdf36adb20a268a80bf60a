irqchip/sunxi-nmi: Rename binding doc filename to allwinner,sunxi-nmi.txt

The NMI controller is found in all Allwinner multi-core SoCs. It is not
limited to sun[67]i, nor is it always found in the "system controller"
block. On sun[68]i, it is in the RTC block, while on sun9i, it is in the
PRCM block.

Drop these 2 specific bits from the binding doc filename.
