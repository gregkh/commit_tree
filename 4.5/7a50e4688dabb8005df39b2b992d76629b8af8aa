MIPS: Fix build error when SMP is used without GIC

The MIPS_GIC_IPI should only be selected when MIPS_GIC is also
selected, otherwise it results in a compile error. smp-gic.c uses some
functions from include/linux/irqchip/mips-gic.h like
plat_ipi_call_int_xlate() which are only added to the header file when
MIPS_GIC is set. The Lantiq SoC does not use the GIC, but supports SMP.
The calls top the functions from smp-gic.c are already protected by
some #ifdefs

The first part of this was introduced in commit 72e20142b2bf ("MIPS:
Move GIC IPI functions out of smp-cmp.c")
