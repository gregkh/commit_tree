drm: Update drm_plane_funcs kerneldoc

- Merge the docbook into the kerneldoc comments.

- Spec in detail the precise semantics of the callbacks.

- For consistency in wording and easier review roll out kerneldoc also
  for crtc, encoder and connector for the standard hooks they share
  with planes.

v2: Suggestions from Thierry.
