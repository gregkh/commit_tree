PM / OPP: Use snprintf() instead of sprintf()

sprintf() can access memory outside of the range of the character array,
and is risky in some situations. The driver specified prop_name string
can be longer than NAME_MAX here (only an attacker will do that though)
and so blindly copying it into the character array of size NAME_MAX
isn't safe. Instead we must use snprintf() here.
