ARM: 8453/2: proc-v7.S: don't locate temporary stack space in .text section

The proc-v7.S code uses a small temporary stack to preserve register
content in its setup code. This stack is located in the .text section
which is normally meant to be read-only.

Move that temporary stack to the .bss section and get its address in
a position independent way, similarly to what we do in other parts
of the kernel.

While at it, one comments was updated to reflect reality, and the list
of saved registers in the proc-v7.S case is updated to match the comment
next to it for coherency.
