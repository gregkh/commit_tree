sparc64: Fix numa node distance initialization

Orabug: 22495713

Currently, NUMA node distance matrix is initialized only
when a machine descriptor (MD) exists. However, sun4u
machines (e.g. Sun Blade 2500) do not have an MD and thus
distance values were left uninitialized. The initialization
is now moved such that it happens on both sun4u and sun4v.
