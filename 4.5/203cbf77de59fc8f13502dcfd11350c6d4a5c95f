hrtimer: Handle remaining time proper for TIME_LOW_RES

If CONFIG_TIME_LOW_RES is enabled we add a jiffie to the relative timeout to
prevent short sleeps, but we do not account for that in interfaces which
retrieve the remaining time.

Helge observed that timerfd can return a remaining time larger than the
relative timeout. That's not expected and breaks userland test programs.

Store the information that the timer was armed relative and provide functions
to adjust the remaining time. To avoid bloating the hrtimer struct make state
a u8, which as a bonus results in better code on x86 at least.
