staging/rdma/hfi1: Fix for module parameter hdrq_entsize when it's 0

If driver is loaded with parameter hdrq_entsize=0, then
there's a NULL dereference when the driver gets unloaded.
This causes a kernel Oops and prevents the module  from
being unloaded. This patch fixes this issue by making sure
-EINVAL gets returned when hdrq_entsize=0.
