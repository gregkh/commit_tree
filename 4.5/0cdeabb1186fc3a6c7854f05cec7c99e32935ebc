kvm/x86: Reorg stimer_expiration() to better control timer restart

Split stimer_expiration() into two parts - timer expiration message
sending and timer restart/cleanup based on timer state(config).

This also fixes a bug where a one-shot timer message whose delivery
failed once would get lost for good.
