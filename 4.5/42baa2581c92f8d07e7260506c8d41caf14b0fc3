x86/apic: Fix the saving and restoring of lapic vectors during suspend/resume

Saving and restoring lapic vectors in lapic_suspend() and
lapic_resume() is not consistent: the thmr vector saving is
guarded by a different config option than the restore part. The
cmci vector isn't handled at all.

Those inconsistencies are not very critical, as the missing cmci
vector will be set via mce resume handling, the wrong config
option used for restoring the thmr vector can't be configured
differently than the one which should be used.

Nevertheless correct the thmr vector restore and add cmci vector
handling.
