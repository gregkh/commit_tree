ntp: Fix ADJ_SETOFFSET being used w/ ADJ_NANO

Recently, in commit 37cf4dc3370f I forgot to check if the timeval being passed
was actually a timespec (as is signaled with ADJ_NANO).

This resulted in that patch breaking ADJ_SETOFFSET users who set
ADJ_NANO, by rejecting valid timespecs that were compared with
valid timeval ranges.

This patch addresses this by checking for the ADJ_NANO flag and
using the timepsec check instead in that case.
