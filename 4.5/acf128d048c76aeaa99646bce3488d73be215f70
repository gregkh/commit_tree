mm: validate_mm browse_rb SMP race condition

The mmap_sem for reading in validate_mm called from expand_stack is not
enough to prevent the argumented rbtree rb_subtree_gap information to
change from under us because expand_stack may be running from other
threads concurrently which will hold the mmap_sem for reading too.

The argumented rbtree is updated with vma_gap_update under the
page_table_lock so use it in browse_rb() too to avoid false positives.
