i40e: fix: do not sleep in netdev_ops

The driver was being called by VLAN, bonding, teaming operations
that expected to be able to hold locks like rcu_read_lock().

This causes the driver to be held to the requirement to not sleep,
and was found by the kernel debug options for checking sleep
inside critical section, and the locking validator.
