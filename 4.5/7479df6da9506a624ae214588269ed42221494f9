thp, mlock: do not allow huge pages in mlocked area

With new refcounting THP can belong to several VMAs.  This makes tricky
to track THP pages, when they partially mlocked.  It can lead to leaking
mlocked pages to non-VM_LOCKED vmas and other problems.

With this patch we will split all pages on mlock and avoid
fault-in/collapse new THP in VM_LOCKED vmas.

I've tried alternative approach: do not mark THP pages mlocked and keep
them on normal LRUs.  This way vmscan could try to split huge pages on
memory pressure and free up subpages which doesn't belong to VM_LOCKED
vmas.  But this is user-visible change: we screw up Mlocked accouting
reported in meminfo, so I had to leave this approach aside.

We can bring something better later, but this should be good enough for
now.
