module: Use the same logic for setting and unsetting RO/NX

When setting a module's RO and NX permissions, set_section_ro_nx() is
used, but when clearing them, unset_module_{init,core}_ro_nx() are used.
The unset functions don't have the same checks the set function has for
partial page protections.  It's probably harmless, but it's still
confusingly asymmetrical.

Instead, use the same logic to do both.  Also add some new
set_module_{init,core}_ro_nx() helper functions for more symmetry with
the unset functions.
