fm10k: Update adaptive ITR algorithm

The existing adaptive ITR algorithm is overly restrictive. It throttles
incorrectly for various traffic rates, and does not produce good
performance. The algorithm now allows for more interrupts per second,
and does some calculation to help improve for smaller packet loads. In
addition, take into account the new itr_scale from the hardware which
indicates how much to scale due to PCIe link speed.
