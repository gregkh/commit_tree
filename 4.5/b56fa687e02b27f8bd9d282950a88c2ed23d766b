ALSA: fm801: detect FM-only card earlier

If user does not supply tea575x_tuner parameter the driver tries to detect the
tuner type. The failed codec initialization is considered as FM-only card
present, however the driver still registers an IRQ handler for it.

Move codec detection earlier to set tea575x_tuner parameter before check.

Here the following functions are introduced
 reset_coded()                       resets AC97 codec
 snd_fm801_chip_multichannel_init()  initializes cards with multichannel support
