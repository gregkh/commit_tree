mm/mmap.c: remove incorrect MAP_FIXED flag comparison from mmap_region

The following flag comparison in mmap_region makes no sense:

    if (!(vm_flags & MAP_FIXED))
        return -ENOMEM;

The condition is always false and thus the above "return -ENOMEM" is
never executed.  The vm_flags must not be compared with MAP_FIXED flag.
The vm_flags may only be compared with VM_* flags.  MAP_FIXED has the
same value as VM_MAYREAD.

Hitting the rlimit is a slow path and find_vma_intersection should
realize that there is no overlapping VMA for !MAP_FIXED case pretty
quickly.
