powerpc/powernv: Add support for Nvlink NPUs

NVLink is a high speed interconnect that is used in conjunction with a
PCI-E connection to create an interface between CPU and GPU that
provides very high data bandwidth. A PCI-E connection to a GPU is used
as the control path to initiate and report status of large data
transfers sent via the NVLink.

On IBM Power systems the NVLink processing unit (NPU) is similar to
the existing PHB3. This patch adds support for a new NPU PHB type. DMA
operations on the NPU are not supported as this patch sets the TCE
translation tables to be the same as the related GPU PCIe device for
each NVLink. Therefore all DMA operations are setup and controlled via
the PCIe device.

EEH is not presently supported for the NPU devices, although it may be
added in future.
