staging/wilc1000: pass hif operations through initialization

The wilc_hif_spi and wilc_hif_sdio structures are part of
the bus specific code, and the generic code should have no knowledge
of their addresses.

This changes the code to reference them only from the bus
specific initialization code, which we can then use to split
up the driver into separate modules.
