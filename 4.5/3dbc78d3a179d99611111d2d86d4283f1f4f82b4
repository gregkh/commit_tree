s390/smp: save timestamp on external calls

This is supposed to make debugging easier: if within a dump we can see
that an external call or emergency signal IPI is pending but all cpus
are idle, we have no idea for how long the interrupt is outstanding.

Therefore save a timestamp into the per cpu pcpu array of the target
cpu whenever such an IPI is sent.
