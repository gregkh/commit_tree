mm: replace vma_lock_anon_vma with anon_vma_lock_read/write

Sequence vma_lock_anon_vma() - vma_unlock_anon_vma() isn't safe if
anon_vma appeared between lock and unlock.  We have to check anon_vma
first or call anon_vma_prepare() to be sure that it's here.  There are
only few users of these legacy helpers.  Let's get rid of them.

This patch fixes anon_vma lock imbalance in validate_mm().  Write lock
isn't required here, read lock is enough.

And reorders expand_downwards/expand_upwards: security_mmap_addr() and
wrapping-around check don't have to be under anon vma lock.
