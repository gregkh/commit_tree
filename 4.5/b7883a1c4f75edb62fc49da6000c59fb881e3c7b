perf/x86: Handle multiple umask bits for BDW CYCLE_ACTIVITY.*

The earlier constraint fix for Broadwell CYCLE_ACTIVITY.*
forced umask 8 to counter 2. For this it used UEVENT,
to match the complete umask.

The event list for Broadwell has an additional
STALLS_L1D_PENDIND event that uses umask 8, but also
sets other bits in the umask.  The earlier strict umask match
didn't handle this case.

Add a new UBIT_EVENT constraint macro that only matches
the specified bits in the umask. Then use that macro
to handle CYCLE_ACTIVITY.* on Broadwell.

The documented event also uses cmask, but there's no
need to let the event scheduler know about the cmask,
as the scheduling restriction is only tied to the umask.
