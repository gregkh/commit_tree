checkpatch: check for __smp outside barrier.h

Introduction of __smp barriers cleans up a bunch of duplicate code, but
it gives people an additional handle onto a "new" set of barriers - just
because they're prefixed with __* unfortunately doesn't stop anyone from
using it (as happened with other arch stuff before.)

Add a checkpatch test so it will trigger a warning.
