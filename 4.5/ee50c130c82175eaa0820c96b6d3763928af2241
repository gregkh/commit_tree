net: jme: fix suspend/resume on JMC260

The JMC260 network card fails to suspend/resume because the call to
jme_start_irq() was too early, moving the call to jme_start_irq() after
the call to jme_reset_link() makes it work.

Prior this change suspend/resume would fail unless /sys/power/pm_async=0
was explicitly specified.
