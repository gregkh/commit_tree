watchdog: asm9260: remove __init and __exit annotations

The probe and release functions in this driver are marked
as __init and __exit, but this is wrong as indicated by this
Kbuild error message:

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.data+0x1d2308): Section mismatch in reference from the variable asm9260_wdt_driver to the function .init.text:asm9260_wdt_probe()

This removes the annotations, to make the sysfs unbind attribute
and deferred probing work.
