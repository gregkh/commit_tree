ARM: 8456/1: code patching only works on MMU

There is no __set_fixmap implementation for NOMMU kernels, so
we cannot link the kernel/patch.c file:

arch/arm/kernel/built-in.o: In function `patch_map':
:(.text+0x257e): undefined reference to `__set_fixmap'
arch/arm/kernel/built-in.o: In function `__patch_text_real':
:(.text+0x2618): undefined reference to `__set_fixmap'
:(.text+0x262e): undefined reference to `__set_fixmap'

To work around that, this adds dependencies for all features
that rely on code patching.
