ftrace: Have ftrace_ops_get_func() handle RCU and PER_CPU flags too

Jiri Olsa noted that the change to replace the control_ops did not update
the trampoline for when running perf on a single CPU and with CONFIG_PREEMPT
disabled (where dynamic ops, like perf, can use trampolines directly). The
result was that perf function could be called when RCU is not watching as
well as not handle the ftrace_local_disable().

Modify the ftrace_ops_get_func() to also check the RCU and PER_CPU ops flags
and use the recursive function if they are set. The recursive function is
modified to check those flags and execute the appropriate checks if they are
set.
