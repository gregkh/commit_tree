ssb: mark ssb_bus_register as __maybe_unused

The SoC variant of the ssb code is now optional like the other
ones, which means we can build the framwork without any
front-end, but that results in a warning:

drivers/ssb/main.c:616:12: warning: 'ssb_bus_register' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

This annotates the ssb_bus_register function as __maybe_unused to
shut up the warning. A configuration like this will not work on
any hardware of course, but we still want this to silently build
without warnings if the configuration is allowed in the first
place.
