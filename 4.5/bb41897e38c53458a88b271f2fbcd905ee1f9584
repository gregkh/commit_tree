regulator: core: fix regulator_lock_supply regression

As noticed by Geert Uytterhoeven, my patch to avoid a harmless build warning
in regulator_lock_supply() was total crap and introduced a real bug:

> [ BUG: bad unlock balance detected! ]
> kworker/u4:0/6 is trying to release lock (&rdev->mutex) at:
> [<c0247b84>] regulator_set_voltage+0x38/0x50

we still lock the regulator supplies, but not the actual regulators,
so we are missing a lock, and the unlock is unbalanced.

This rectifies it by first locking the regulator device itself before
using the same loop as before to lock its supplies.
