perf tui: Change default selection background color to yellow

Boris reported that 'perf top' is unusable on his default 'black on
white' terminal, which uses (eye friendly) light-grey as a background
color.

The reason is that the TUI cursor for the current selection line uses
HE_COLORSET_SELECTED, and that has a default background color of
'lightgrey' - which is a common terminal background choice and thus
the colors conflict.

Use yellow as the background color instead: that should be an uncommon
terminal background, yet it's still ergonomic on both black and
white/grey terminals.

[ It would be a better solution to straight out detect color
  collisions and resolve them reasonably by converting them to RGB and
  calculating color space distances, but I was unable to find
  proper documentation for SLtt_get_color_object() to recover the
  current color scheme so I gave up ... Yellow works well enough. ]
