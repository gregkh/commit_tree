sctp: remove the dead field of sctp_transport

After we use refcnt to check if transport is alive, the dead can be
removed from sctp_transport.

The traversal of transport_addr_list in procfs dump is using
list_for_each_entry_rcu, no need to check if it has been freed.

sctp_generate_t3_rtx_event and sctp_generate_heartbeat_event is
protected by sock lock, it's not necessary to check dead, either.
also, the timers are cancelled when sctp_transport_free() is
called, that it doesn't wait for refcnt to reach 0 to cancel them.
