fm10k: do not assume VF always has 1 queue

It is possible that the PF has not yet assigned resources to the VF.
Although rare, this could result in the VF attempting to read queues it
does not own and result in FUM or THI faults in the PF. To prevent this,
check queue 0 before we continue in init_hw_vf.
