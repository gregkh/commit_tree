x86/mce: Do not enter deferred errors into the generic pool twice

We used to have a special ring buffer for deferred errors that
was used to mark problem pages. We replaced that with a generic
pool. Then later converted mce_log() to also use the same pool.
As a result, we end up adding all deferred errors to the pool
twice.

Rearrange this code. Make sure to set the m.severity and
m.usable_addr fields for deferred errors. Then if flags and
mca_cfg.dont_log_ce mean we call mce_log() we are done, because
that will add this entry to the generic pool.

If we skipped mce_log(), then we still want to take action for
the deferred error, so add to the pool.

Change the name of the boolean "error_logged" to "error_seen",
we should set it whether of not we logged an error because the
return value from machine_check_poll() is used to decide whether
storms have subsided or not.
