serial: sh-sci: Drop the interface clock

As no platform defines an interface clock the SCI driver always falls
back to a clock named "peripheral_clk".
  - On SH platforms that clock is the base clock for the SCI functional
    clock and has the same frequency,
  - On ARM platforms that clock doesn't exist, and clk_get() will return
    the default clock for the device.
We can thus make the functional clock mandatory and drop the interface
clock.

EPROBE_DEFER is handled for clocks that may be referenced from DT (i.e.
"fck", and the deprecated "sci_ick").
