net: mvneta: Modify the queue related fields from each cpu

In the MVNETA_INTR_* registers, the queues related fields are per cpu,
according to the datasheet (comment in [] are added by me):
"In a multi-CPU system, bits of RX[or TX] queues for which the access by
the reading[or writing] CPU is disabled are read as 0, and cannot be
cleared[or written]."

That means that each time we want to manipulate these bits we had to do
it on each cpu and not only on the current cpu.
