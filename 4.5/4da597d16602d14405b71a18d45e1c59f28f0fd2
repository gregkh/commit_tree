ARM: OMAP2+: Fix ppa_zero_params and ppa_por_params for rodata

We don't want to write to .text so let's move ppa_zero_params and
ppa_por_params to .data and access them via pointers.

Note that I have not been able to test as we I don't have a HS
omap4 to test with. The code has been changed in similar way as
for omap3 though.
