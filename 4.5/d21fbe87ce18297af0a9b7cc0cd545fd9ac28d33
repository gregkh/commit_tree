drm/i915/ivb: Move WaCxSRDisabledForSpriteScaling w/a to atomic check

Determine whether we need to apply this workaround at atomic check time
and just set a flag that will be used by the main watermark update
routine.

Moving this workaround into the atomic framework reduces
ilk_update_sprite_wm() to just a standard watermark update, so drop it
completely and just ensure that ilk_update_wm() is called whenever a
sprite plane is updated in a way that would affect watermarks.
