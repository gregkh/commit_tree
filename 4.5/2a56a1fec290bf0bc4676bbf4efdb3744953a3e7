net: wrap sock->sk_cgrp_prioidx and ->sk_classid inside a struct

Introduce sock->sk_cgrp_data which is a struct sock_cgroup_data.
->sk_cgroup_prioidx and ->sk_classid are moved into it.  The struct
and its accessors are defined in cgroup-defs.h.  This is to prepare
for overloading the fields with a cgroup pointer.

This patch mostly performs equivalent conversions but the followings
are noteworthy.

* Equality test before updating classid is removed from
  sock_update_classid().  This shouldn't make any noticeable
  difference and a similar test will be implemented on the helper side
  later.

* sock_update_netprioidx() now takes struct sock_cgroup_data and can
  be moved to netprio_cgroup.h without causing include dependency
  loop.  Moved.

* The dummy version of sock_update_netprioidx() converted to a static
  inline function while at it.
