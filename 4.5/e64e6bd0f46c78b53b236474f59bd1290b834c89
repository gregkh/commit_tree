drm/i915: get runtime PM reference around GEM set_tiling IOCTL

After fixing the same issue in the set_caching IOCTL and Chris' request
to check out the possibilities for an improved RPM ref handling I
noticed that we have the same issue in the set_tiling IOCTL. Fix this
up.I didn't see any bug reports about this one, but the GTT unbind
operation on this path accesses the HW, which needs the ref.
