IB/mlx5: Add CQE version 1 support to user QPs and SRQs

Enforce working with CQE version 1 when the user supports CQE
version 1 and asked to work this way.

If the user still works with CQE version 0, then use the default
CQE version to tell the Firmware that the user still works in the
older mode.

After this patch, the kernel still reports CQE version 0.
