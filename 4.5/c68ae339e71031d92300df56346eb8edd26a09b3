drm/i915: don't disable_fbc() if FBC is already disabled

If FBC is disabled we will still call intel_fbc_invalidate(), and as a
result we may call intel_fbc_deactivate(), which will try to touch
registers.

I'm pretty sure I saw this happen on a runtime suspended device, and
I'm almost sure I was running igt/pm_rpm. It produced the "you touched
registers while the device is suspended" WARNs. But this was some time
ago and I can't remember exactly which conditions were necessary to
reproduce the problem.

v2: Rebase to new series order.
