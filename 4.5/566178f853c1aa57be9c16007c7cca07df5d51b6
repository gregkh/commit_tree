net: sctp: dynamically enable or disable pf state

As we all know, the value of pf_retrans >= max_retrans_path can
disable pf state. The variables of pf_retrans and max_retrans_path
can be changed by the userspace application.

Sometimes the user expects to disable pf state while the 2
variables are changed to enable pf state. So it is necessary to
introduce a new variable to disable pf state.

According to the suggestions from Vlad Yasevich, extra1 and extra2
are removed. The initialization of pf_enable is added.
