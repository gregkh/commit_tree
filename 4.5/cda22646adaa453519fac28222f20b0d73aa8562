block: add call to split trace point

There is a split tracepoint that is supposed to be called when
bio is splitted, and it was called in bio_split function until
commit 4b1faf931650d4a35b2a ("block: Kill bio_pair_split()").
But now, no one reports splits, so this patch adds call to
trace_block_split back in blk_queue_split right after split.
