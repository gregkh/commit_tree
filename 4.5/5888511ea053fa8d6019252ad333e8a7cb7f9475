net: mvneta: The mvneta_percpu_elect function should be atomic

Electing a CPU must be done in an atomic way: it should be done after or
before the removal/insertion of a CPU and this function is not reentrant.

During the loop of mvneta_percpu_elect we associates the queues to the
CPUs, if there is a topology change during this loop, then the mapping
between the CPUs and the queues could be wrong. During this loop the
interrupt mask is also updating for each CPUs, It should not be changed
in the same time by other part of the driver.

This patch adds spinlock to create the needed critical sections.
