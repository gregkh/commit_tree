xfs: refactor log record unpack and data processing

xlog_do_recovery_pass() duplicates a couple function calls related to
processing log records because the function must handle wrapping around
the end of the log if the head is behind the tail. This is implemented
as separate loops. CRC verification pass support will modify how records
are processed in both of these loops.

Rather than continue to duplicate code, factor the calls that process a
log record into a new helper and call that helper from both loops. This
patch contains no functional changes.
