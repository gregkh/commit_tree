[media] v4l: vsp1: Fix wrong entities links creation

The Media Control framework now requires entities to be registered with
the media device before creating links so commit c7621b3044f7 ("[media]
v4l: vsp1: separate links creation from entities init") separated link
creation from entities init.

But unfortunately that patch introduced a regression since wrong links
were created causing a boot failure on Renesas boards.

This patch fixes the boot issue and also the media graph was compared
by Geert Uytterhoeven to make sure that the driver changes required by
the Media Control framework next generation did not affect the graph.
