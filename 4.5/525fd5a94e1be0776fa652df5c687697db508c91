sparc64: fix incorrect sign extension in sys_sparc64_personality

The value returned by sys_personality has type "long int".
It is saved to a variable of type "int", which is not a problem
yet because the type of task_struct->pesonality is "unsigned int".
The problem is the sign extension from "int" to "long int"
that happens on return from sys_sparc64_personality.

For example, a userspace call personality((unsigned) -EINVAL) will
result to any subsequent personality call, including absolutely
harmless read-only personality(0xffffffff) call, failing with
errno set to EINVAL.
