ALSA: oxfw: reuse driver entry to detect quirks

Currently, assignment to model-dependent quirk is corresponding to
asynchronous transactions on IEEE 1394 bus. This is also achieved with
device entry.

This commit changes the processing of model-dependent quirk with the
entry. As a result, the transactions are sent only for Loud models.
