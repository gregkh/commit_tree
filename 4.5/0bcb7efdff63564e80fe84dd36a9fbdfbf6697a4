mmc: mmci: fix an ages old detection error

commit 4956e10903fd ("ARM: 6244/1: mmci: add variant data and default
MCICLOCK support") added variant data for ARM, U300 and Ux500 variants.
The Nomadik NHK8815/8820 variant was erroneously labeled as a U300
variant, and when the proper Nomadik variant was later introduced in
commit 34fd421349ff ("ARM: 7378/1: mmci: add support for the Nomadik MMCI
variant") this was not fixes. Let's say this fixes the latter commit as
there was no proper Nomadik support until then.
