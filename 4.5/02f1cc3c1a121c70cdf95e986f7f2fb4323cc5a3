ARM: omap2plus_defconfig: enable SPLIT and DWARF4

CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT will split debug info on
.dwo files. This will generate a smaller vmlinux and
smaller .ko modules, which will be easier to ship on
certain products.

CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF4 will generate debug info in
DWARF4 format, which ends up being larger, but
improves the probability of resolving variables in
optmized code.
