ncr5380: Fix whitespace in comments using regexp

Hanging indentation was a poor choice for the text inside comments. It
has been used in the wrong places and done badly elsewhere. There is
little consistency within any file. One fork of the core driver uses
tabs for this indentation while the other uses spaces. Better to use
flush-left alignment throughout.

This patch is the result of the following substitution. It replaces tabs
and spaces at the start of a comment line with a single space.

perl -i -pe 's,^(\t*[/ ]\*)[ \t]+,$1 ,' drivers/scsi/{atari_,}NCR5380.c

This removes some unimportant discrepancies between the two core driver
forks so that the important ones become obvious, to facilitate
reunification.
