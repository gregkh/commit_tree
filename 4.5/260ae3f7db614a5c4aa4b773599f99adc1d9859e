mm: skip memory block registration for ZONE_DEVICE

Prevent userspace from trying and failing to online ZONE_DEVICE pages
which are meant to never be onlined.

For example on platforms with a udev rule like the following:

  SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="add", ATTR{state}=="offline", ATTR{state}="online"

...will generate futile attempts to online the ZONE_DEVICE sections.
Example kernel messages:

    Built 1 zonelists in Node order, mobility grouping on.  Total pages: 1004747
    Policy zone: Normal
    online_pages [mem 0x248000000-0x24fffffff] failed
