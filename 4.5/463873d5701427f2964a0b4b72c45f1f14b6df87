drm/vc4: Add an API for creating GPU shaders in GEM BOs.

Since we have no MMU, the kernel needs to validate that the submitted
shader code won't make any accesses to memory that the user doesn't
control, which involves banning some operations (general purpose DMA
writes), and tracking where we need to write out pointers for other
operations (texture sampling).  Once it's validated, we return a GEM
BO containing the shader, which doesn't allow mapping for write or
exporting to other subsystems.

v2: Use __u32-style types.
