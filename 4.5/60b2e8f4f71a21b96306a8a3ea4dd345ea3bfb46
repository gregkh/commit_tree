test_hexdump: rename to test_hexdump

The test suite currently doesn't cover many corner cases when
hex_dump_to_buffer() runs into overflow.  Refactor and amend test suite
to cover most of the cases.

This patch (of 9):

Just to follow the scheme that most of the test modules are using.

There is no fuctional change.
