vfs: Add vfs_copy_file_range() support for pagecache copies

This allows us to have an in-kernel copy mechanism that avoids frequent
switches between kernel and user space.  This is especially useful so
NFSD can support server-side copies.

The default (flags=0) means to first attempt copy acceleration, but use
the pagecache if that fails.
