perf build: Test correct path of perf in build-test

If an 'O' is passed to 'make build-test', many 'test -x' and 'test -f'
will fail because perf resides in a different directory. Fix this by
computing PERF_OUT according to 'O' and test correct output files.
For make_kernelsrc and make_kernelsrc_tools, set KBUILD_OUTPUT_DIR
instead because the path is different from others ($(O)/perf vs
 $(O)/tools/perf).
