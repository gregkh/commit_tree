ALSA: oxfw: obsolete scs1x module

Now ALSA oxfw driver gains functionalities which scs1x module has.

This commit obsoletes the scs1x module, and adds a line of MODULE_ALIAS
to load oxfw module instead of scs1x module.

In scs1x module, the name of 'shortname' field is fixed as 'SCS1x'. This
field is used to name MIDI ports for both of SCS.1m and SCS.1d. This is
not good because typically some SCS.1m and SCS.1d are used in the same
system. It's better to distinguish them according to name of the ports.
This commit applies model name in config ROM to the 'shortname'.

For the name of 'driver' and 'longname', this commit uses the same way
applied to the other models. This change may not bring disadvantages to
users because userspace applications use ALSA rawmidi or seq interface
and these interfaces are not influenced by them directly.
