powerpc/mm: Add a _PAGE_PTE bit

For a pte entry we will have _PAGE_PTE set. Our pte page
address have a minimum alignment requirement of HUGEPD_SHIFT_MASK + 1.
We use the lower 7 bits to indicate hugepd. ie.

For pmd and pgd we can find:
1) _PAGE_PTE set pte -> indicate PTE
2) bits [2..6] non zero -> indicate hugepd.
   They also encode the size. We skip bit 1 (_PAGE_PRESENT).
3) othewise pointer to next table.
