NFSv4.1/pNFS: Fix a race in initiate_file_draining()

Peng Tao points out that the call to pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return()
could race with pnfs_put_lseg(), in which case the layout segment is
cleared, but no layoutreturn will be sent.
Fix is to replace the call to pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_invalid().
