Revert "btrfs: synchronize incompat feature bits with sysfs files"

This reverts commit 14e46e04958df740c6c6a94849f176159a333f13.

This ends up doing sysfs operations from deep in balance (where we
should be GFP_NOFS) and under heavy balance load, we're making races
against sysfs internals.

Revert it for now while we figure things out.
