drm/i915/skl: enable PC9/10 power states during suspend-to-idle

During suspend-to-idle we need to keep the DMC firmware active and DC6
enabled, since otherwise we won't reach deep system power states like
PC9/10. The lead for this came from Nivedita who noticed that the
kernel's turbostat tool didn't report any PC9/10 residency change
across an 'echo freeze > /sys/power/state'.
