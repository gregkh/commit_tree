ext4: fix scheduling in atomic on group checksum failure

When block group checksum is wrong, we call ext4_error() while holding
group spinlock from ext4_init_block_bitmap() or
ext4_init_inode_bitmap() which results in scheduling while in atomic.
Fix the issue by calling ext4_error() later after dropping the spinlock.
