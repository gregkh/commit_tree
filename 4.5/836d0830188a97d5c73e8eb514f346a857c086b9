ACPI / debugger: Add module support for ACPI debugger

This patch converts AML debugger into a loadable module.

Note that, it implements driver unloading at the level dependent on the
module reference count. Which means if ACPI debugger is being used by a
userspace program, "rmmod acpi_dbg" should result in failure.
