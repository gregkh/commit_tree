serial: mctrl_gpio: export mctrl_gpio_disable_ms and mctrl_gpio_init

To be able to make use of the mctrl-gpio helper from a module these
functions must be exported. This was forgotten in the commit introducing
support interrupt handling for these functions (while it was done for
mctrl_gpio_enable_ms, *sigh*).
