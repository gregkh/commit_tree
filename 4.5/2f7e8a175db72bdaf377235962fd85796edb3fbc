cpufreq: arm_big_little: Add support to register a cpufreq cooling device

Register passive cooling devices when initialising cpufreq on
big.LITTLE systems. If the device tree provides a dynamic power
coefficient for the CPUs then the bound cooling device will support
the extensions that allow it to be used with all the existing thermal
governors including the power allocator governor.

A cooling device will be created per individual frequency domain and
can be bound to thermal zones via the thermal DT bindings.
