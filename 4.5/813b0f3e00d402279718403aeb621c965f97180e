drm: Remove crtc/connector->save/restore hooks

They're not how system suspend/resume should be done with atomic
(there's new helpers for that developed by Thierry Reding), and for
legacy drivers this really should be a helper hook and not a core one.

But there's not even helper code to use them, and only 2 drivers
(which now have their own private hooks) set them. Ditch them.

Saves me typing some kerneldoc, too ;-)
