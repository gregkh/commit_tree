watchdog: Read device status through sysfs attributes

This patch adds following attributes to watchdog device's sysfs interface
to read its different status.

* state - reads whether device is active or not
* identity - reads Watchdog device's identity string.
* timeout - reads current timeout.
* timeleft - reads timeleft before watchdog generates a reset
* bootstatus - reads status of the watchdog device at boot
* status - reads watchdog device's  internal status bits
* nowayout - reads whether nowayout feature was set or not

Testing with iTCO_wdt:
 # cd /sys/class/watchdog/watchdog1/
 # ls
bootstatus  dev  device  identity  nowayout  power  state
subsystem  timeleft  timeout  uevent
 # cat identity
iTCO_wdt
 # cat timeout
30
 # cat state
inactive
 # echo > /dev/watchdog1
 # cat timeleft
26
 # cat state
active
 # cat bootstatus
0
 # cat nowayout
0
