nvme: simplify resets

Don't delete the controller from dev_list before queuing a reset, instead
just check for it being reset in the polling kthread.  This allows to remove
the dev_list_lock in various places, and in addition we can simply rely on
checking the queue_work return value to see if we could reset a controller.
