mac80211: Requeue work after scan complete for all VIF types.

During a sw scan ieee80211_iface_work ignores work items for all vifs.
However after the scan complete work is requeued only for STA, ADHOC
and MESH iftypes.

This occasionally results in event processing getting delayed/not
processed for iftype AP when it coexists with a STA. This can result
in data halt and eventually disconnection on the AP interface.
