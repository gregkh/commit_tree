xen/blkback: Free resources if connect_ring failed.

With the multi-queue support we could fail at setting up
some of the rings and fail the connection. That meant that
all resources tied to rings[0..n-1] (where n is the ring
that failed to be setup). Eventually the frontend will switch
to the states and we will call xen_blkif_disconnect.

However we do not want to be at the mercy of the frontend
deciding when to change states. This allows us to do the
cleanup right away and freeing resources.
