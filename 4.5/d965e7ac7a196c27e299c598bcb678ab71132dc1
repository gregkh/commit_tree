drm/i915/bxt: backlight clock gating workaround

Per bspec, "Backlight PWM may stop in the asserted state, causing
backlight to stay fully on. WA: Before disabling PWM, set CLKGATE_DIS_0
0x46530 bit 13 PWM1 Gating Dis (for PWM1) or bit 14 PWM2 Gating Dis (for
PWM2). The bits can remain set without harm." (There's no workaround
name for this.)

This fixes some Broxton backlight issues.
