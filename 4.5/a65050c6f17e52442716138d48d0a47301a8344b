x86/fpu: Revert ("x86/fpu: Disable AVX when eagerfpu is off")

Leonid Shatz noticed that the SDM interpretation of the following
recent commit:

  394db20ca240741 ("x86/fpu: Disable AVX when eagerfpu is off")

... is incorrect and that the original behavior of the FPU code was correct.

Because AVX is not stated in CR0 TS bit description, it was mistakenly
believed to be not supported for lazy context switch. This turns out
to be false:

  Intel Software Developer's Manual Vol. 3A, Sec. 2.5 Control Registers:

   'TS Task Switched bit (bit 3 of CR0) -- Allows the saving of the x87 FPU/
    MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 context on a task switch to be delayed until
    an x87 FPU/MMX/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3/SSE4 instruction is actually executed
    by the new task.'

  Intel Software Developer's Manual Vol. 2A, Sec. 2.4 Instruction Exception
  Specification:

   'AVX instructions refer to exceptions by classes that include #NM
    "Device Not Available" exception for lazy context switch.'

So revert the commit.
