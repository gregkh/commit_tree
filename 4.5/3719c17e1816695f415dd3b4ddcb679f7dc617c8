wlcore/wl18xx: fw logger over sdio

Enable the FW Logger to work over the SDIO interface in addition to over UART
interface. In the new design we use fw internal memory instead of packet ram
that was used in older (wl12xx) design. This change reduces the impact on TP
and stability.

A new event was added to notify fw logger is ready for reading. Dynamic
configuration to debugfs was added as well.
