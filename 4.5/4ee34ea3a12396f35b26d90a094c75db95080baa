libata: Align ata_device's id on a cacheline

The id buffer in ata_device is a DMA target, but it isn't explicitly
cacheline aligned. Due to this, adjacent fields can be overwritten with
stale data from memory on non coherent architectures. As a result, the
kernel is sometimes unable to communicate with an ATA device.

Fix this by ensuring that the id buffer is cacheline aligned.

This issue is similar to that fixed by Commit 84bda12af31f
("libata: align ap->sector_buf").
