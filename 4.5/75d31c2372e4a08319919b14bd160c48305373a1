i2c: xlr: add support for Sigma Designs controller variant

Sigma Designs chips use a variant of this controller with the following
differences:

- The BUSY bit in the STATUS register is inverted
- Bit 8 of the CONFIG register must be set
- The controller can generate interrupts

This patch adds support for the first two of these.  It also calculates
and sets the correct clock divisor if a clk is provided.  The bus
frequency is optionally speficied in the device tree node.
