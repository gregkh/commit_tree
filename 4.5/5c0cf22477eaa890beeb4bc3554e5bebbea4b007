perf record: Store data mmaps for dwarf unwind

Currently we don't synthesize data mmap by default. It depends on -d
option, that enables data address sampling.

But we've seen cases (softice) where DWARF unwinder went through non
executable mmaps, which we need to lookup in MAP__VARIABLE tree.

Making data mmaps to be synthesized for dwarf unwind as well.
