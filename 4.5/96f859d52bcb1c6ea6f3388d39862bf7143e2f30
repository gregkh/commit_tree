libxfs: pack the agfl header structure so XFS_AGFL_SIZE is correct

Because struct xfs_agfl is 36 bytes long and has a 64-bit integer
inside it, gcc will quietly round the structure size up to the nearest
64 bits -- in this case, 40 bytes.  This results in the XFS_AGFL_SIZE
macro returning incorrect results for v5 filesystems on 64-bit
machines (118 items instead of 119).  As a result, a 32-bit xfs_repair
will see garbage in AGFL item 119 and complain.

Therefore, tell gcc not to pad the structure so that the AGFL size
calculation is correct.
