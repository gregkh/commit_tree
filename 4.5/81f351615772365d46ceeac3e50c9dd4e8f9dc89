xen/blkfront: separate per ring information out of device info

Split per ring information to a new structure "blkfront_ring_info".

A ring is the representation of a hardware queue, every vbd device can associate
with one or more rings depending on how many hardware queues/rings to be used.

This patch is a preparation for supporting real multi hardware queues/rings.

We also add a backpointer to 'struct blkfront_info' (dev_info) which
is not needed (we could use containers_of) but further patch
("xen/blkfront: pseudo support for multi hardware queues/rings")
will make allocation of 'blkfront_ring_info' dynamic.
