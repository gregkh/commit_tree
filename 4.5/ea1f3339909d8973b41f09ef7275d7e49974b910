mfd: arizona: Support Cirrus Logic CS47L24 and WM1831

This patch adds the regmap configuration tables and
core MFD handling for the CS47L24 and WM1831 codecs.

Note that compared to the other Arizona codecs, these devices
do not have an LDO1 or micsupp regulators, extcon driver, or
the DCVDD isolation control.
