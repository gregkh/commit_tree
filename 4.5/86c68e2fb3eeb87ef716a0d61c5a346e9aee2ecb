backlight: adp88x0: Fix uninitialized variable use

gcc correctly warns about both the adp8860 and adp8870 backlight
drivers using an uninitialized variable in their error handling
path:

drivers/video/backlight/adp8870_bl.c: In function 'adp8870_bl_ambient_light_zone_store':
drivers/video/backlight/adp8870_bl.c:811:11: warning: 'reg_val' may be used uninitialized in this function

This changes the code to only write back the data if it was
correctly read to start with.

As a side-note, the drivers are mostly identical, so I think they
should really be merged into one file to avoid having to fix every
bug twice.
