list: Use WRITE_ONCE() when adding to lists and hlists

Code that does lockless emptiness testing of non-RCU lists is relying
on the list-addition code to write the list head's ->next pointer
atomically.  This commit therefore adds WRITE_ONCE() to list-addition
pointer stores that could affect the head's ->next pointer.
