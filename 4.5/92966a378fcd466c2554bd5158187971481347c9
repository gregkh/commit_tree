drm/i915: Disable FDI after the CRT port on LPT-H

Bspec modeset sequence tells us to disable the PCH transcoder and
FDI after the CRT port on LPT-H, so let's do that. And the CRT port
should be disabled after the pipe, as we do on other PCH platforms
too since
commit 1ea56e269e13 ("drm/i915: Disable CRT port after pipe on PCH platforms")

commit 00490c22b1b5 ("drm/i915: Consider SPLL as another shared pll, v2.")
moved the SPLL disable from the .post_disable() hook to some upper
level code, so we can just move the CRT port disabling into the
.post_disable() hook. If we still had the non-shared SPLL, it would have
needed to be moved into the .post_pll_disable() hook.

v2: Actually move the CRT port disable to the .post_disable() hook,
    and amend the commit message with more details (Paulo)
v3: Fix typos in commit message (Paulo)
