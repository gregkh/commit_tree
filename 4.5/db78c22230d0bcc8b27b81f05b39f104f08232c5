mm: fix pfn_t vs highmem

The pfn_t type uses an unsigned long to store a pfn + flags value.  On a
64-bit platform the upper 12 bits of an unsigned long are never used for
storing the value of a pfn.  However, this is not true on highmem
platforms, all 32-bits of a pfn value are used to address a 44-bit
physical address space.  A pfn_t needs to store a 64-bit value.
