memblock: don't mark memblock_phys_mem_size() as __init

At the moment memblock_phys_mem_size() is marked as __init, and so is
discarded after boot.  This is different from most of the memblock
functions which are marked __init_memblock, and are only discarded after
boot if memory hotplug is not configured.

To allow for upcoming code which will need memblock_phys_mem_size() in
the hotplug path, change it from __init to __init_memblock.
