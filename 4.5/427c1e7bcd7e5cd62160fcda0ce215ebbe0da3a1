{IB, net}/mlx5: Move the modify QP operation table to mlx5_ib

When modifying a QP, the desired operation was determined in
the mlx5_core using a transition table that takes the current
state, the final state, and returns the desired operation.

Since this logic will be used for Raw Packet QP, move the
operation table to the mlx5_ib.
