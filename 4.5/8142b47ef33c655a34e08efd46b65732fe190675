mtd: nand: remove unused and buggy get_platform_nandchip() helper function

Nobody uses the get_platform_nandchip() helper function which is supposed
to return a pointer to a platform_nand_chip struct from an mtd_info
pointer.
Moreover, this function is buggy since the introduction of the plat_nand
layer (chip->priv is now storing a pointer to an intermediate
plat_nand_data structure allocated in plat_nand_probe(), and we have no
way to retrieve a pointer to the provided platform_nand_chip struct from
this plat_nand_data pointer).

While we are at it, remove the useless (and buggy, since it's pointing to
something stored on the stack) data->chip.priv assignment.
