missing include asm/paravirt.h in cputime.c

Add include asm/paravirt.h to cputime.c, as steal_account_process_tick
calls paravirt_steal_clock, which is defined in asm/paravirt.h.

The ifdef CONFIG_PARAVIRT is necessary because not all archs have an
asm/paravirt.h to include.

The reason why currently cputime.c compiles, even though include
<asm/paravirt.h> is missing, is that on x86 asm/paravirt.h is included
by one of the other headers included in kernel/sched/cputime.c:

On arm and arm64, where I am about to introduce asm/paravirt.h and
stolen time support, without #include <asm/paravirt.h> in cputime.c, I
would get an error.
