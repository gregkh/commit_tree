PCI/MSI: Initialize MSI capability for all architectures

1851617cd2da ("PCI/MSI: Disable MSI at enumeration even if kernel doesn't
support MSI") moved dev->msi_cap and dev->msix_cap initialization from the
pci_init_capabilities() path (used on all architectures) to the
pci_setup_device() path (not used on Open Firmware architectures).

This broke MSI or MSI-X on Open Firmware machines.  4d9aac397a5d
("powerpc/PCI: Disable MSI/MSI-X interrupts at PCI probe time in OF case")
fixed it for PowerPC but not for SPARC.

Set up MSI and MSI-X (initialize msi_cap and msix_cap and disable MSI and
MSI-X) in pci_init_capabilities() so all architectures do it the same way.

This reverts 4d9aac397a5d since this patch fixes the problem generically
for both PowerPC and SPARC.
