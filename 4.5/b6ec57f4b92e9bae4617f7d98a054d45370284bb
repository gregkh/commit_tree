thp: change pmd_trans_huge_lock() interface to return ptl

After THP refcounting rework we have only two possible return values
from pmd_trans_huge_lock(): success and failure.  Return-by-pointer for
ptl doesn't make much sense in this case.

Let's convert pmd_trans_huge_lock() to return ptl on success and NULL on
failure.
