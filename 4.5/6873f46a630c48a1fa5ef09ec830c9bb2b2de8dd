toshiba_acpi: Add support for WWAN devices

Toshiba laptops with WWAN devices installed cannot use the device unless
it is attached and powered, similar to how Toshiba Bluetooth devices
work.

This patch adds support to WWAN devices, introducing three functions,
one to query the overall status of the wireless devices (RFKill, WLAN,
BT, WWAN), the second queries WWAN support, and finally the third
(de)activates the device.
