[media] media: Move media graph state for streamon/off to the pipeline

The struct media_entity_graph was allocated in the stack, limiting the
number of entities that could be reasonably allocated. Instead, move the
struct to struct media_pipeline which is typically allocated using
kmalloc() instead.

The intent is to keep the enumeration around for later use for the
duration of the streaming. As streaming is eventually stopped, an
unfortunate memory allocation failure would prevent stopping the
streaming. As no memory will need to be allocated, the problem is avoided
altogether.
