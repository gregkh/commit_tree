drbd: don't block forever in disconnect during resync if fencing=r-a-stonith

Disconnect should wait for pending bitmap IO.
But if that bitmap IO is not happening, because it is waiting for
pending application IO, and there is no progress, because the fencing
policy suspended application IO because of the disconnect,
then we deadlock.

The bitmap writeout in this case does not care for concurrent
application IO, so there is no point waiting for it.
