MAINTAINERS: trim the file triggers for ABI/API

Commit ea8f8fc8631 ("MAINTAINERS: add linux-api for review of API/ABI
changes") added file triggers for various paths that likely indicated
API/ABI changes.  However, catching all changes in Documentation/ABI/
and include/uapi/ produces a large volume of mail to linux-api, rather
than only API/ABI changes.  Drop those two entries, but leave
include/linux/syscalls.h and kernel/sys_ni.c to catch syscall-related
changes.
