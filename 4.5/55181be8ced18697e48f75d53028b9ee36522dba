ncr5380: Replace redundant flags with FLAG_NO_DMA_FIXUP

The flags DMA_WORKS_RIGHT, FLAG_NCR53C400 and FLAG_HAS_LAST_BYTE_SENT
all mean the same thing, i.e. the chip is not a 538[01]. (More recent
devices such as the 53C80 have a 'Last Byte Sent' bit in the Target
Command Register as well as other fixes for End-of-DMA errata.)

These flags have no additional meanings since previous cleanup patches
eliminated the NCR53C400 macro, moved g_NCR5380-specific code out of the
core driver and standardized interrupt handling.

Use the FLAG_NO_DMA_FIXUP flag to suppress End-of-DMA errata workarounds,
for those cards and drivers that make use of the TCR_LAST_BYTE_SENT bit.
Remove the old flags.
