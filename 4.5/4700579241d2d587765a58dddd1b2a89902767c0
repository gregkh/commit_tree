KVM: x86: MMU: Move initialization of parent_ptes out from kvm_mmu_alloc_page()

Make kvm_mmu_alloc_page() do just what its name tells to do, and remove
the extra allocation error check and zero-initialization of parent_ptes:
shadow page headers allocated by kmem_cache_zalloc() are always in the
per-VCPU pools.
