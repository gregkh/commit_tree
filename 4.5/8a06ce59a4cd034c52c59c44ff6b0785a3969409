IB/core: Add cross-channel support

The cross-channel feature allows to execute WQEs that involve
synchronization of I/O operations’ on different QPs.

This capability enables to program complex flows with a single
function call, hereby significantly reducing overhead associated
with I/O processing.

Cross-channel operations support is indicated by HCA capability
information.

The queue pairs can be configured to work as a “sync master queue”
or “sync slave queues”.

The added flags are:

1. Device capability flag IB_DEVICE_CROSS_CHANNEL for the
   devices that can perform cross-channel operations.

2. CQ property flag IB_CQ_FLAGS_IGNORE_OVERRUN to disable CQ overrun
   check. This check is useless in cross-channel scenario.

3. QP property flags to indicate if queues are slave or master:
   * IB_QP_CREATE_MANAGED_SEND indicates that posted send work requests
     will not be executed immediately and requires enabling.
   * IB_QP_CREATE_MANAGED_RECV indicates that posted receive work
     requests will not be executed immediately and requires enabling.
   * IB_QP_CREATE_CROSS_CHANNEL declares the QP to work in cross-channel
     mode. If IB_QP_CREATE_MANAGED_SEND and IB_QP_CREATE_MANAGED_RECV are
     not provided, this QP will be sync master queue, else it will be sync
     slave.
