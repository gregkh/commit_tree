tcp: beware of alignments in tcp_get_info()

With some combinations of user provided flags in netlink command,
it is possible to call tcp_get_info() with a buffer that is not 8-bytes
aligned.

It does matter on some arches, so we need to use put_unaligned() to
store the u64 fields.

Current iproute2 package does not trigger this particular issue.

Fixes: 977cb0ecf82e ("tcp: add pacing_rate information into tcp_info")
