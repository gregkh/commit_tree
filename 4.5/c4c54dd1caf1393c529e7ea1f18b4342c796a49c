kernel/cpu.c: change type of cpu_possible_bits and friends

Change cpu_possible_bits and friends (online, present, active) from being
bitmaps that happen to have the right size to actually being struct
cpumasks.  Also rename them to __cpu_xyz_mask.  This is mostly a small
cleanup in preparation for exporting them and, eventually, eliminating the
extra indirection through the cpu_xyz_mask variables.
