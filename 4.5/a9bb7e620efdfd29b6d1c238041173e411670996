memcg: only account kmem allocations marked as __GFP_ACCOUNT

Black-list kmem accounting policy (aka __GFP_NOACCOUNT) turned out to be
fragile and difficult to maintain, because there seem to be many more
allocations that should not be accounted than those that should be.
Besides, false accounting an allocation might result in much worse
consequences than not accounting at all, namely increased memory
consumption due to pinned dead kmem caches.

So this patch switches kmem accounting to the white-policy: now only
those kmem allocations that are marked as __GFP_ACCOUNT are accounted to
memcg.  Currently, no kmem allocations are marked like this.  The
following patches will mark several kmem allocations that are known to
be easily triggered from userspace and therefore should be accounted to
memcg.
