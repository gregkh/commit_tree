fbcon: set a default value to blink interval

Since commit 27a4c827c34ac4256a190cc9d24607f953c1c459
	fbcon: use the cursor blink interval provided by vt

two attempts have been made at fixing a possible hang caused by
cursor_timer_handler. That function registers a timer to be triggered at
"jiffies + fbcon_ops.cur_blink_jiffies".

A new case had been encountered during initialisation of clcd-pl11x:

    fbcon_fb_registered
    do_fbcon_takeover

    ->  do_register_con_driver
        fbcon_startup
    (A) add_cursor_timer (with cur_blink_jiffies = 0)

    ->  do_bind_con_driver
        visual_init
        fbcon_init
    (B) cur_blink_jiffies = msecs_to_jiffies(vc->vc_cur_blink_ms);

If we take an softirq anywhere between A and B (and we do),
cursor_timer_handler executes indefinitely.

Instead of patching all possible paths that lead to this case one at a
time, fix the issue at the source and initialise cur_blink_jiffies to
200ms when allocating fbcon_ops. This was its default value before
aforesaid commit. fbcon_cursor or fbcon_init will refine this value
downstream.
