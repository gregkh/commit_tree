ASoC: qcom: use correct device pointer in dma allocation

dev pointer in struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime does not have dma_ops set. In
v4.4 kernel dma_ops would end up pointing to dummy_dma_ops in such cases.
So attempting to use such device in allocating coherent memory on aarch64
would fail.

According to commit 1dccb598df549d892b6450c261da54cdd7af44b4 ("arm64:
simplify dma_get_ops") The current behavior of dma_get_ops is to fall
back to the global dma_ops when a device has not set its own dma_ops,
but only for DT based systems.

So, this patch fixes the driver to use correct device pointer while
allocating coherent memory, and also deletes un-necessary dma_mask setup
on soc_runtime->dev.

Without this patch lpass driver would fail with below log:
