sh: support 1 and 2 byte xchg

This completes the xchg implementation for sh architecture.  Note: The
llsc variant is tricky since this only supports 4 byte atomics, the
existing implementation of 1 byte xchg is wrong: we need to do a 4 byte
cmpxchg and retry if any bytes changed meanwhile.

Write this in C for clarity.
