drbd: separate out __al_write_transaction helper function

To be able to "force out" an activity log transaction,
even if there are no pending updates.

This will be used to relocate the on-disk activity log,
if the on-disk offsets have to be changed,
without the need to empty the activity log first.

While at it, move the definition,
so we can drop the forward declaration of a static helper.
