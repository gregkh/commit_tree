i2c: document generic DT bindings for timing parameters

Also, sort the properties alphabetically and make indentation
consistent. Wording largely taken from i2c-rk3x.txt, thanks guys!

Only "i2c-scl-internal-delay-ns" is new, the rest is used by two drivers
already and was documented in their driver binding documentation.
