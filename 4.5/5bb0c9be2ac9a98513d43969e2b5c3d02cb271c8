xenbus: use virt_xxx barriers

drivers/xen/xenbus/xenbus_comms.c uses
full memory barriers to communicate with the other side.

For guests compiled with CONFIG_SMP, smp_wmb and smp_mb
would be sufficient, so mb() and wmb() here are only needed if
a non-SMP guest runs on an SMP host.

Switch to virt_xxx barriers which serve this exact purpose.
