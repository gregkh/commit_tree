xhci: Fix list corruption in urb dequeue at host removal

xhci driver frees data for all devices, both usb2 and and usb3 the
first time usb_remove_hcd() is called, including td_list and and xhci_ring
structures.

When usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus it
will try to dequeue all pending urbs, and touches td_list which is already
freed for that endpoint.
