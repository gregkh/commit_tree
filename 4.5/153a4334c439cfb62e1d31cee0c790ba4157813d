x86/headers: Don't include asm/processor.h in asm/atomic.h

asm/atomic.h doesn't really need asm/processor.h anymore. Everything
it uses has moved to other header files. So remove that include.

processor.h is a nasty header that includes lots of
other headers and makes it prone to include loops. Removing the
include here makes asm/atomic.h a "leaf" header that can
be safely included in most other headers.

The only fallout is in the lib/atomic tester which relied on
this implicit include. Give it an explicit include.
(the include is in ifdef because the user is also in ifdef)
