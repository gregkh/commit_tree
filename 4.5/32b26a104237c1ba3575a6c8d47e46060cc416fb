ncr5380: Use standard list data structure

The NCR5380 drivers have a home-spun linked list implementation for
scsi_cmnd structs that uses cmd->host_scribble as a 'next' pointer. Adopt
the standard list_head data structure and list operations instead. Remove
the eh_abort_handler rather than convert it. Doing the conversion would
only be churn because the existing EH handlers don't work and get replaced
in a subsequent patch.
