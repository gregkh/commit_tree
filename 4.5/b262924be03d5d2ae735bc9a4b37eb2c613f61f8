lightnvm: fix locking and mempool in rrpc_lun_gc

This patch fix two issues in rrpc_lun_gc

1. prio_list is protected by rrpc_lun's lock not nvm_lun's, so
acquire rlun's lock instead of lun's before operate on the list.

2. we delete block from prio_list before allocating gcb, but gcb
allocation may fail, we end without putting it back to the list,
this makes the block won't get reclaimed in the future. To solve
this issue, delete block after gcb allocation.
