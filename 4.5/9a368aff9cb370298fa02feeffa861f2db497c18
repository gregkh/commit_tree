pptp: fix illegal memory access caused by multiple bind()s

Several times already this has been reported as kasan reports caused by
syzkaller and trinity and people always looked at RCU races, but it is
much more simple. :)

In case we bind a pptp socket multiple times, we simply add it to
the callid_sock list but don't remove the old binding. Thus the old
socket stays in the bucket with unused call_id indexes and doesn't get
cleaned up. This causes various forms of kasan reports which were hard
to pinpoint.

Simply don't allow multiple binds and correct error handling in
pptp_bind. Also keep sk_state bits in place in pptp_connect.
