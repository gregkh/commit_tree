nxp-nci: i2c: Do not check specifically for -EREMOTEIO error

Function nxp_nci_i2c_write currently assumes in case of
I2C bus NACK that the NFC device is in stand-by mode and
will retry the I2C transaction after a pause. This assumes
that the first failed I2C transaction will wake-up the device.

This is done by checking on EREMOTEIO, which is wrong. According
to Documentation/i2c/fault-codes ENXIO shall be used. Unfortunately
the NOACK return code is currently inconsistent across various I2C
host controller drivers. So only check for the generic error case
instead.

This is a temporary fix. As soon as all I2C bus master drivers are
fixed to consistently return 'ENXIO', then we can do the specific
error check again.
