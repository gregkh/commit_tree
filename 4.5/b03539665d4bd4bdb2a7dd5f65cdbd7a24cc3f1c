init, Documentation: Remove ramdisk_blocksize mentions

The brd driver has never supported the ramdisk_blocksize kernel
parameter that was in the rd driver it replaced, so remove
mention of this parameter from comments and Documentation.

Commit 9db5579be4bb ("rewrite rd") replaced rd with brd, keeping
a brd_blocksize variable in struct brd_device but never using it.

Commit a2cba2913c76 ("brd: get rid of unused members from struct
brd_device") removed the unused variable.

Commit f5abc8e75815 ("Documentation/blockdev/ramdisk.txt: updates")
removed mentions of ramdisk_blocksize from that file.
