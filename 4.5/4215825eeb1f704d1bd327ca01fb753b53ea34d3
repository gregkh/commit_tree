KVM: s390: don't switch to ESCA for ucontrol

sca_add_vpcu is not called for ucontrol guests. We must also not
apply the sca checking for sca_can_add_vcpu as ucontrol guests
do not have to follow the sca limits.

As common code already checks that id < KVM_MAX_VCPUS all other
data structures are safe as well.
