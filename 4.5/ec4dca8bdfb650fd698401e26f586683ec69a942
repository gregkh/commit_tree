USB: usbmon: Remove timeval usage for timestamp

struct timeval' uses 32-bits for its seconds field and will overflow in
the year 2038 and beyond. This patch replaces the usage of 'struct timeval'
in mon_get_timestamp() with timespec64 which uses a 64-bit seconds field
and is y2038-safe. mon_get_timestamp() truncates the timestamp at 4096 seconds,
so the correctness of the code is not affected. This patch is part of a larger
attempt to remove instances of struct timeval and other 32-bit timekeeping
(time_t, struct timespec) from the kernel.
