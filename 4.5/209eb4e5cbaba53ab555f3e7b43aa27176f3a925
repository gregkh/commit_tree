powerpc/rtas: Add rtas_call_unlocked()

Most users of RTAS (Run-Time Abstraction Services) use rtas_call(),
which deals with locking as well as endian handling.

However we have two users outside of rtas.c that can't use rtas_call()
because they have different locking requirements.

The hotplug CPU code can't take the RTAS lock because the CPU would go
offline with the lock held and no other CPUs would be able to call RTAS
until the CPU came back online.

The xmon code doesn't want to take the lock because it would risk dead
locking when we are trying to recover from a crash.

Both sites required multiple patches when we added little endian
support, proving that programmers can't do endian right.

Although that ship has sailed, we can still clean the code up by
providing an unlocked version of rtas_call() which avoids the need to
open code the logic elsewhere.
