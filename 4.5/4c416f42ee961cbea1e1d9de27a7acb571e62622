fs/stat.c: drop the last new_valid_dev check

New_valid_dev() always returns true, so that's unnecessary to perform
new_valid_dev() checks in some filesystems.  Most checks of
new_valid_dev() have been removed so let's drop this last one and then
we can remove new_valid_dev() from the source code.

No functional change.
