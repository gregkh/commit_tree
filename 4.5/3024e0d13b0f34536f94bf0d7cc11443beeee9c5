watchdog: dw_wdt: fix signedness bug in dw_wdt_top_in_seconds()

On 64bit platforms, "(1 << (16 + top)) / clk_get_rate(dw_wdt.clk)" is
sign-extended to 64bit then converted to unsigned 64bit, finally divide
the clk rate. If the top is the maximum TOP i.e 15, "(1 << (16 +15))"
will be sign-extended to 0xffffffff80000000, then converted to unsigned
0xffffffff80000000, which is a huge number, thus the final result is
wrong.

We fix this issue by giving usigned value(1U in this case) at first.

Let's assume clk rate is 25MHZ,
Before the patch:
dw_wdt_top_in_seconds(15) = -864612050

After the patch:
dw_wdt_top_in_seconds(15) = 85
