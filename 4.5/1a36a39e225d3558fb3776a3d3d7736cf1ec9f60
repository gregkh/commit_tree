s390/dump: rework CPU register dump code

To collect the CPU registers of the crashed system allocated a single
page with memblock_alloc_base and use it as a copy buffer. Replace the
stop-and-store-status sigp with a store-status-at-address sigp in
smp_save_dump_cpus() and smp_store_status(). In both cases the target
CPU is already stopped and store-status-at-address avoids the detour
via the absolute zero page.

For kexec simplify s390_reset_system and call store_status() before
the prefix register of the boot CPU has been set to zero. Use STPX
to store the prefix register and remove dump_prefix_page.
