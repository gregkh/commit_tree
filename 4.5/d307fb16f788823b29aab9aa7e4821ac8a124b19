Revert "virtio_ring: Update weak barriers to use dma_wmb/rmb"

This reverts commit 9e1a27ea42691429e31f158cce6fc61bc79bb2e9.

While that commit optimizes !CONFIG_SMP, it mixes
up DMA and SMP concepts, making the code hard
to figure out.

A better way to optimize this is with the new __smp_XXX
barriers.

As a first step, go back to full rmb/wmb barriers
for !SMP.
We switch to __smp_XXX barriers in the next patch.
