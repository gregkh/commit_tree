mm: temporarily mark THP broken

Up to this point we tried to keep patchset bisectable, but next patches
are going to change how core of THP refcounting work.

It would be beneficial to split the change into several patches and make
it more reviewable.  Unfortunately, I don't see how we can achieve that
while keeping THP working.

Let's hide THP under CONFIG_BROKEN for now and bring it back when new
refcounting get established.
