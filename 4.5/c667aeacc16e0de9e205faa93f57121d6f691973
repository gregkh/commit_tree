s390: rename struct _lowcore to struct lowcore

Finally get rid of the leading underscore. I tried this already two or
three years ago, however Michael Holzheu objected since this would
break the crash utility (again).

However Michael integrated support for the new name into the crash
utility back then, so it doesn't break if the name will be changed
now.  So finally get rid of the ever confusing leading underscore.
