Revert "INPUT: xpad: switch Logitech G920 Wheel into HID mode"

This reverts commit 27b9d5a254dcbc6095404c1bab7c335419601eb8.

I am reverting this one, while keeping the rest of the G920 support in,
so that it immediately starts working once proper HID-mode switching
is implemented.

Quoting Dmitry Torokhov for rationale:

==
It is wrong. Aside form the fact that IMO xpad.c is the wrong place for
this code to be in, why are we waiting for the input device to be
opened by userspace before we do the switch instead of doing it
immediately?
==

Several people (Simon Wood and Michal Maly) expressed the intent to work
on proper HID switching in a short term.
