drm: adv7511: really enable interrupts for EDID detection

The interrupts for EDID_READY or DDC_ERROR were never enabled in this
driver, so reading EDID always timed out when chip was powered down and
interrupts were used. Fix this and also remove clearing the interrupt
flags, they are cleared in POWER_DOWN mode anyhow (unlike the interrupt
enable flags) according to docs and my tests.
