net/mlx4_core: Support the HA mode for SRIOV VFs too

When the mlx4 driver runs in HA mode, and all VFs are single ported
ones, we make their single port Highly-Available.

This is done by taking advantage of the HA mode properties (following
bonding changes with programming the port V2P map, etc) and adding
the missing parts which are unique to SRIOV such as mirroring VF
steering rules on both ports.

Due to limits on the MAC and VLAN table this mode is enabled only when
number of total VFs is under 64.
