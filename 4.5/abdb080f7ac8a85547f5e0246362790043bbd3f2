kvm/irqchip: kvm_arch_irq_routing_update renaming split

Actually kvm_arch_irq_routing_update() should be
kvm_arch_post_irq_routing_update() as it's called at the end
of irq routing update.

This renaming frees kvm_arch_irq_routing_update function name.
kvm_arch_irq_routing_update() weak function which will be used
to update mappings for arch-specific irq routing entries
(in particular, the upcoming Hyper-V synthetic interrupts).
