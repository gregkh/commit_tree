leds: core: Add two new LED_BLINK_ flags

This patch adds LED_BLINK_BRIGHTNESS_CHANGE flag to indicate that blink
brightness has changed, and LED_BLINK_DISABLE flag to indicate that
blinking deactivation has been requested. In order to use the flags
led_timer_function and set_brightness_delayed callbacks as well as
led_set_brightness() function are being modified. The main goal of these
modifications is to prepare set_brightness_work for extension of the
scope of its responsibilities.
