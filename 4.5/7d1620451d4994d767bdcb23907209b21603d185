iwlwifi: nvm: fix up phy section when reading it

This is a workaround to an OTP bug. In Series 8000 1x1, the OTP
0xA052 defines 2x2 antenna configuration. This workaround overrides
the decision based on HW id and on MIMO disabled bit which is
correct in the OTP and set to disabled. This fixes the previous
workaround "force 1x1 antenna in Series 8000".
