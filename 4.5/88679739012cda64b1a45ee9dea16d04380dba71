ARM: meson: serial: tx_empty fails to check for transmitter busy

The tx_empty() uart_op should only return empty if both the transmit fifo
and the transmit state-machine are both idle. Add a test for the hardware's
XMIT_BUSY flag.

Note, this is possibly related to an issue where the port is being shutdown
with paritally transmitted characters in it.
