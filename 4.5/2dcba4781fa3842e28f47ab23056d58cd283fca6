ext4: get rid of EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_NO_LOCK flag

When dioread_nolock mode is enabled, we grab i_data_sem in
ext4_ext_direct_IO() and therefore we need to instruct _ext4_get_block()
not to grab i_data_sem again using EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_NO_LOCK. However
holding i_data_sem over overwrite direct IO isn't needed these days. We
have exclusion against truncate / hole punching because we increase
i_dio_count under i_mutex in ext4_ext_direct_IO() so once
ext4_file_write_iter() verifies blocks are allocated & written, they are
guaranteed to stay so during the whole direct IO even after we drop
i_mutex.

So we can just remove this locking abuse and the no longer necessary
EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_NO_LOCK flag.
