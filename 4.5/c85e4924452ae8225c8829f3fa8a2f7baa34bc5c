hv_netvsc: Fix book keeping of skb during batching process

Since eliminating send_completion_tid from struct hv_netvsc_packet, we
haven't add proper book keeping for the skb of the batched packet. This
patch fixes this issue and allows the previous skb is properly freed.
Otherwise, a panic may happen.
