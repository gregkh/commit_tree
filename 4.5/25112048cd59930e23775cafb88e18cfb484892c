tpm: rework tpm_get_timeouts()

IRQ probing needs to know that the TPM is working before trying to
probe, so move tpm_get_timeouts() to the top of the tpm_tis_init().
This has the advantage of also getting the correct timeouts loaded
before doing IRQ probing.

All the timeout handling code is moved to tpm_get_timeouts() in order to
remove duplicate code in tpm_tis and tpm_crb.
