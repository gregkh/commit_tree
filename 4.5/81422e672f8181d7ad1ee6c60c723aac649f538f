jme: Fix device PM wakeup API usage

According to Documentation/power/devices.txt

The driver should not use device_set_wakeup_enable() which is the policy
for user to decide.

Using device_init_wakeup() to initialize dev->power.should_wakeup and
dev->power.can_wakeup on driver initialization.

And use device_may_wakeup() on suspend to decide if WoL function should
be enabled on NIC.
