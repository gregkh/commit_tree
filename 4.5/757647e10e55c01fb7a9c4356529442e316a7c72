hv_netvsc: use skb_get_hash() instead of a homegrown implementation

Recent changes to 'struct flow_keys' (e.g commit d34af823ff40 ("net: Add
VLAN ID to flow_keys")) introduced a performance regression in netvsc
driver. Is problem is, however, not the above mentioned commit but the
fact that netvsc_set_hash() function did some assumptions on the struct
flow_keys data layout and this is wrong.

Get rid of netvsc_set_hash() by switching to skb_get_hash(). This change
will also imply switching to Jenkins hash from the currently used Toeplitz
but it seems there is no good excuse for Toeplitz to stay.
