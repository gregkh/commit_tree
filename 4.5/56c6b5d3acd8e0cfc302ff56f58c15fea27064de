drivers/base/memory.c: clean up section counting

Right now, section_count is calculated in add_memory_block().  However,
init_memory_block() increments section_count as well, which, at first,
seems like it would lead to an off-by-one error.  There is no harm done
because add_memory_block() immediately overwrites the
mem->section_count, but it is messy.

This commit moves the increment out of the common init_memory_block()
(called by both add_memory_block() and register_new_memory()) and adds
it to register_new_memory().
