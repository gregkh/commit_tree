ixgbe: Clean stale VLANs when changing port VLAN or resetting

This patch guarantees that the VFs do not have access to VLANs that they
were not supposed to.  What this patch does is add code so that we delete
the previous port VLAN after adding a new one, and if we reset the VF we
clear all of the filters associated with it.

Previously the code was leaving all previous VLANs mapped to the VF and
they didn't get deleted unless the VF specifically requested it or if the
PF itself was reset.
