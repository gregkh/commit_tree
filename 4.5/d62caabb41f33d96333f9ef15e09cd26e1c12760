kvm/x86: per-vcpu apicv deactivation support

The decision on whether to use hardware APIC virtualization used to be
taken globally, based on the availability of the feature in the CPU
and the value of a module parameter.

However, under certain circumstances we want to control it on per-vcpu
basis.  In particular, when the userspace activates HyperV synthetic
interrupt controller (SynIC), APICv has to be disabled as it's
incompatible with SynIC auto-EOI behavior.

To achieve that, introduce 'apicv_active' flag on struct
kvm_vcpu_arch, and kvm_vcpu_deactivate_apicv() function to turn APICv
off.  The flag is initialized based on the module parameter and CPU
capability, and consulted whenever an APICv-specific action is
performed.
