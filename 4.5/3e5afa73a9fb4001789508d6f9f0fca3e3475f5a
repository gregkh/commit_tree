ASoC: rsnd: DMA related definition goes to dma.c

Renesas sound needs many devices
(SSI/SSIU/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC/CMD/AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp).
SSI/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC are implemented as module.
SSI parent, SSIU are implemented as part of SSI
CMD is implemented as part of CTU/MIX/DVC
AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp are implemented as part of SSI/SRC
It is nice sense that these all devices are implemented as mod.

DMA will be implemented as module. Current DMA definition is no longer
needed on rsnd.h. Let's move it to dma.c
