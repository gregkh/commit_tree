[media] vb2: drop v4l2_format argument from queue_setup

The queue_setup callback has a void pointer that is just for V4L2
and is the pointer to the v4l2_format struct that was passed to
VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS. The idea was that drivers would use the information
from that struct to buffers suitable for the requested format.

After the vb2 split series this pointer is now a void pointer,
which is ugly, and the reality is that all existing drivers will
effectively just look at the sizeimage field of v4l2_format.

To make this more generic the queue_setup callback is changed:
the void pointer is dropped, instead if the *num_planes argument
is 0, then use the current format size, if it is non-zero, then
it contains the number of requested planes and the sizes array
contains the requested sizes. If either is unsupported, then return
-EINVAL, otherwise use the requested size(s).
