perf annotate: ARM support

Add basic support to parse ARM assembly.

This:

* enables perf to correctly show the disassembly, rather than chopping
  some constants off at the '#' (which is not a comment character on
  ARM).

* allows perf to identify ARM instructions that branch to other parts
  within the same function, thereby properly annotating them.

* allows perf to identify function calls, allowing called functions to
  be followed in the annotated view.
