PCI: generic,versatile: Remove unused pci_sys_data structures

Commit b3a72384fe29 ("ARM/PCI: Replace pci_sys_data->align_resource with
global function pointer") removed the struct pci_sys_data dependency from
the ARM pcibios functions that are part of the common ARM PCI arch
back-end, e.g., pcibios_align_resource(), so that struct pci_sys_data has
now become data that is only used internally by the ARM bios32 layer, i.e.,
pci_common_init_dev(), and by host controllers drivers callbacks, e.g.,
pci_sys_data.setup, that rely on the ARM bios32 API to probe.

PCI host controller drivers that do not rely on ARM bios32 calls to probe
do not need to have the pci_bus.sysdata pointer field pointing at a struct
pci_sys_data anymore, therefore it can be removed from the respective
drivers data structures.

Remove the pci_sys_data structures from the host controller drivers that do
not rely on ARM bios32 interface to scan the PCI bus, completing the
pci_sys_data clean-up and removing the related dependency on arch/arm
specific data.
