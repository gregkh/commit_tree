page-flags: define PG_locked behavior on compound pages

lock_page() must operate on the whole compound page.  It doesn't make
much sense to lock part of compound page.  Change code to use head
page's PG_locked, if tail page is passed.

This patch also gets rid of custom helper functions --
__set_page_locked() and __clear_page_locked().  They are replaced with
helpers generated by __SETPAGEFLAG/__CLEARPAGEFLAG.  Tail pages to these
helper would trigger VM_BUG_ON().

SLUB uses PG_locked as a bit spin locked.  IIUC, tail pages should never
appear there.  VM_BUG_ON() is added to make sure that this assumption is
correct.
