usb: core: lpm: fix usb3_hardware_lpm sysfs node

Commit 655fe4effe0f ("usbcore: add sysfs support to xHCI usb3
hardware LPM") introduced usb3_hardware_lpm sysfs node. This
doesn't show the correct status of USB3 U1 and U2 LPM status.

This patch fixes this by replacing usb3_hardware_lpm with two
nodes, usb3_hardware_lpm_u1 (for U1) and usb3_hardware_lpm_u2
(for U2), and recording the U1/U2 LPM status in right places.

This patch should be back-ported to kernels as old as 4.3,
that contains Commit 655fe4effe0f ("usbcore: add sysfs support
to xHCI usb3 hardware LPM").
