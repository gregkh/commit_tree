defxx: fix build warning

We are getting many build warnings about:
'bar_start' may be used uninitialized
and
'bar_len' may be used uninitialized

They are not actually uninitialized as dfx_get_bars() will initialize
them properly. But still lets have them initialized just to satisfy the
compiler (gcc 4.8.2).
