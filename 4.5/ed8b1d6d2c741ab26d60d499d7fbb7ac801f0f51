ALSA: timer: Fix race between stop and interrupt

A slave timer element also unlinks at snd_timer_stop() but it takes
only slave_active_lock.  When a slave is assigned to a master,
however, this may become a race against the master's interrupt
handling, eventually resulting in a list corruption.  The actual bug
could be seen with a syzkaller fuzzer test case in BugLink below.

As a fix, we need to take timeri->timer->lock when timer isn't NULL,
i.e. assigned to a master, while the assignment to a master itself is
protected by slave_active_lock.
