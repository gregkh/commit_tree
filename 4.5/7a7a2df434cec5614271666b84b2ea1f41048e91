ALSA: azt3328: Remove unnecessary synchronize_irq() before free_irq()

Calling synchronize_irq() right before free_irq() is quite useless. On one
hand the IRQ can easily fire again before free_irq() is entered, on the
other hand free_irq() itself calls synchronize_irq() internally (in a race
condition free way) before any state associated with the IRQ is freed.
