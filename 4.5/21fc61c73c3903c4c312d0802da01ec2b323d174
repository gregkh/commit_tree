don't put symlink bodies in pagecache into highmem

kmap() in page_follow_link_light() needed to go - allowing to hold
an arbitrary number of kmaps for long is a great way to deadlocking
the system.

new helper (inode_nohighmem(inode)) needs to be used for pagecache
symlinks inodes; done for all in-tree cases.  page_follow_link_light()
instrumented to yell about anything missed.
