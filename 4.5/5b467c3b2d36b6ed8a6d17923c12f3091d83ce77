arm64: dts: Add syscon based reboot in DT for NS2

To reset NS2, we simply have to write '0' to BIT[1] at offset 0x90
of CRMU space.

The above can be easily achieved by writing 0xfffffffd at offset 0x90
using syscon-reboot driver. We don't need to have separate driver for
rebooting NS2.

This patch enables syscon-reboot driver for NS2 using DT.
