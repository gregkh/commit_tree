Revert "PCI, x86: Implement pcibios_alloc_irq() and pcibios_free_irq()"

991de2e59090 ("PCI, x86: Implement pcibios_alloc_irq() and
pcibios_free_irq()") appeared in v4.3 and helps support IOAPIC hotplug.

Олег reported that the Elcus-1553 TA1-PCI driver worked in v4.2 but not
v4.3 and bisected it to 991de2e59090.  Sunjin reported that the RocketRAID
272x driver worked in v4.2 but not v4.3.  In both cases booting with
"pci=routirq" is a workaround.

I think the problem is that after 991de2e59090, we no longer call
pcibios_enable_irq() for upstream bridges.  Prior to 991de2e59090, when a
driver called pci_enable_device(), we recursively called
pcibios_enable_irq() for upstream bridges via pci_enable_bridge().

After 991de2e59090, we call pcibios_enable_irq() from pci_device_probe()
instead of the pci_enable_device() path, which does *not* call
pcibios_enable_irq() for upstream bridges.

Revert 991de2e59090 to fix these driver regressions.
