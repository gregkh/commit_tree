btrfs: add .copy_file_range file operation

This rearranges the existing COPY_RANGE ioctl implementation so that the
.copy_file_range file operation can call the core loop that copies file
data extent items.

The extent copying loop is lifted up into its own function.  It retains
the core btrfs error checks that should be shared.
