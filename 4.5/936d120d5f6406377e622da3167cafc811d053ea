tools build feature: Use value assignment form for FEATURE-DUMP file

Changing the contents of the FEATURE-DUMP file, so it looks like:

  feature-backtrace=1
  feature-dwarf=0
  feature-fortify-source=1
  feature-sync-compare-and-swap=0

This way it could get included in sub projects, so they won't be forced
to redo features detection.

Also now storing the complete set of features.
