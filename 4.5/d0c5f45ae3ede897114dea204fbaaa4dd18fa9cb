ravb: kill duplicate setting of CCC.CSEL

When  adding support for the  R-Car gen3 gPTP active in configuration mode,
the code setting the CCC.CSEL field  was duplicated due to an oversight.
For R-Car gen 2 it's just redundant  and for R-Car gen3 the write at this
time is probably  ignored due to CCC.GAC bit being already  set...
