mm: drop tail page refcounting

Tail page refcounting is utterly complicated and painful to support.

It uses ->_mapcount on tail pages to store how many times this page is
pinned.  get_page() bumps ->_mapcount on tail page in addition to
->_count on head.  This information is required by split_huge_page() to
be able to distribute pins from head of compound page to tails during
the split.

We will need ->_mapcount to account PTE mappings of subpages of the
compound page.  We eliminate need in current meaning of ->_mapcount in
tail pages by forbidding split entirely if the page is pinned.

The only user of tail page refcounting is THP which is marked BROKEN for
now.

Let's drop all this mess.  It makes get_page() and put_page() much
simpler.
