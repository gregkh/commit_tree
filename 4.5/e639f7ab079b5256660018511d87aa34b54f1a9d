netfilter: nf_tables: wrap tracing with a static key

Only needed when meta nftrace rule(s) were added.
The assumption is that no such rules are active, so the call to
nft_trace_init is "never" needed.

When nftrace rules are active, we always call the nft_trace_* functions,
but will only send netlink messages when all of the following are true:

 - traceinfo structure was initialised
 - skb->nf_trace == 1
 - at least one subscriber to trace group.

Adding an extra conditional
(static_branch ... && skb->nf_trace)
	nft_trace_init( ..)

Is possible but results in a larger nft_do_chain footprint.
