cpufreq: Simplify core code related to boost support

Notice that the boost_supported field in struct cpufreq_driver is
redundant, because the driver's ->set_boost callback may be left
unset if "boost" is not supported.  Moreover, the only driver
populating the ->set_boost callback is acpi_cpufreq, so make it
avoid populating that callback if "boost" is not supported, rework
the core to check ->set_boost instead of boost_supported to
verify "boost" support and drop boost_supported which isn't
used any more.
