fsl/fman: Add FMan support

Add the Data Path Acceleration Architecture Frame Manger Driver.
The FMan embeds a series of hardware blocks that implement a group
of Ethernet interfaces. This patch adds The FMan configuration,
initialization and runtime control routines.

The FMan driver supports several hardware versions
differentiated by things like:
	- Different type of MACs
	- Number of MAC and ports
	- Available resources
	- Different hardware errata
