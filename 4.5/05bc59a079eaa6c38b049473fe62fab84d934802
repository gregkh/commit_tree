ACPI / video: Add a module option to disable the reporting of keypresses

Add a module option to disable the reporting of keypresses, in some buggy
firmware implementatinon, the reported events are wrong. E.g. they lag
reality by one event in the case triggering the writing of this patch.

In this case it is better to not forward these wrong events to userspace
(esp.) when there is another source of the same events which is not buggy.

Note this is only intended to work around implementations which send
events which are plain wrong. In some cases we get double events, e.g.
from both acpi-video and the atkbd driver, in this case acpi-video is
considered the canonical source, and the events from the other source
should be filtered (using e.g. /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb).
