drm/i915: Remove the magic AUX_CTL is at DP + foo tricks

Currently we determine the location of the AUX registers in a confusing
way. First we assume the PCH registers are used always, but then we
override it for everything but HSW/BDW to use DP+0x10. Very confusing.

Let's just make it straightforward and simply add a few functions to
pick the right AUX_CTL based on the DP port.

To deal with VLV/CHV we'll include the display_mmio_offset into the
AUX register defines.
