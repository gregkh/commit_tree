block: don't optimize for non-cloned bio in bio_get_last_bvec()

For !BIO_CLONED bio, we can use .bi_vcnt safely, but it
doesn't mean we can just simply return .bi_io_vec[.bi_vcnt - 1]
because the start postion may have been moved in the middle of
the bvec, such as splitting in the middle of bvec.

Fixes: 7bcd79ac50d9(block: bio: introduce helpers to get the 1st and last bvec)
