switchdev: vlan: Use switchdev_port* in vlan_netdev_ops

We need to be able to propagate static FDB entries and certain bridge
port attributes (e.g. learning, flooding) down to the port netdev
driver when bridge port is a VLAN interface.

Achieve that by setting ndo_bridge* and ndo_fdb* in vlan_netdev_ops to
the corresponding switchdev_port* functions. This is consistent with
team and bond devices.
