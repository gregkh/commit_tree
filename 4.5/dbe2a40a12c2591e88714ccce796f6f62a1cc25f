ARM: dts: Remove broken-cd from eMMC node in exynos5800-peach-pi

The eMMC is non-removable so is marked with the non-removable DT
property to avoid having to redetect it after a suspend/resume.

But it also has the broken-cd property which is wrong since only
one of the DT properties for card detection should be used.

Also remove the card-detect-delay property that is not needed with
non-removable.
