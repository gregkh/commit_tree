mpls: support for dead routes

Adds support for RTNH_F_DEAD and RTNH_F_LINKDOWN flags on mpls
routes due to link events. Also adds code to ignore dead
routes during route selection.

Unlike ip routes, mpls routes are not deleted when the route goes
dead. This is current mpls behaviour and this patch does not change
that. With this patch however, routes will be marked dead.
dead routes are not notified to userspace (this is consistent with ipv4
routes).

dead routes:
-----------
$ip -f mpls route show
100
    nexthop as to 200 via inet 10.1.1.2  dev swp1
    nexthop as to 700 via inet 10.1.1.6  dev swp2

$ip link set dev swp1 down

$ip link show dev swp1
4: swp1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN mode
DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:02:00:00:00:01 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

$ip -f mpls route show
100
    nexthop as to 200 via inet 10.1.1.2  dev swp1 dead linkdown
    nexthop as to 700 via inet 10.1.1.6  dev swp2

linkdown routes:
----------------
$ip -f mpls route show
100
    nexthop as to 200 via inet 10.1.1.2  dev swp1
    nexthop as to 700 via inet 10.1.1.6  dev swp2

$ip link show dev swp1
4: swp1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast
state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:02:00:00:00:01 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

/* carrier goes down */
$ip link show dev swp1
4: swp1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast
state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:02:00:00:00:01 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

$ip -f mpls route show
100
    nexthop as to 200 via inet 10.1.1.2  dev swp1 linkdown
    nexthop as to 700 via inet 10.1.1.6  dev swp2
