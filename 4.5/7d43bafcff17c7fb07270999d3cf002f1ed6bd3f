KVM: s390: Make provisions for ESCA utilization

This patch updates the routines (sca_*) to provide transparent access
to and manipulation on the data for both Basic and Extended SCA in use.
The kvm.arch.sca is generalized to (void *) to handle BSCA/ESCA cases.
Also the kvm.arch.use_esca flag is provided.
The actual functionality is kept the same.
