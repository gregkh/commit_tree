netlink: not trim skb for mmaped socket when dump

We should not trim skb for mmaped socket since its buf size is fixed
and userspace will read as frame which data equals head. mmaped
socket will not call recvmsg, means max_recvmsg_len is 0,
skb_reserve was not called before commit: db65a3aaf29e.

Fixes: db65a3aaf29e (netlink: Trim skb to alloc size to avoid MSG_TRUNC)
