drm/nouveau/display: Enable vblank irqs after display engine is on again.

In the display resume path, move the calls to drm_vblank_on()
after the point when the display engine is running again.

Since changes were made to drm_update_vblank_count() in Linux 4.4+
to emulate hw vblank counters via vblank timestamping, the function
drm_vblank_on() now needs working high precision vblank timestamping
and therefore working scanout position queries at time of call.
These don't work before the display engine gets restarted, causing
miscalculation of vblank counter increments and thereby large forward
jumps in vblank count at display resume. These jumps can cause client
hangs on resume, or desktop hangs in the case of composited desktops.

Fix this Linux 4.4 regression by reordering calls accordingly.
