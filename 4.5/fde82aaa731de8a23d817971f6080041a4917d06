mm/page_alloc.c: get rid of __alloc_pages_high_priority()

__alloc_pages_high_priority doesn't do anything special other than it
calls get_page_from_freelist and loops around GFP_NOFAIL allocation
until it succeeds.  It would be better if the first part was done in
__alloc_pages_slowpath where we modify the zonelist because this would
be easier to read and understand.  Opencoding the function into its only
caller allows to simplify it a bit as well.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
