ARM: dts: kirkwood: gpio pin fixes for linkstation ls-wvl/vl

For kirkwood, gpio pins starts from 32 are in the 2nd bank, so it should be
converted to "gpio1 <pin minus 32>" in dts file.
e.g. gpio 40 should be "gpio1 8"

The pin/bank issue was found when discussing Debian Bug #810894
  [https://bugs.debian.org/810894#47]
