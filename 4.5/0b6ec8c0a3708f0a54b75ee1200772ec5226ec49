debugobjects: Allow bigger number of early boot objects

On my bigger s390 systems  I always get "Out of memory.
ODEBUG disabled". Since the number of objects is needed at
compile time, we can not change the size dynamically before
the caches etc are available. Doubling the size seems to
do the trick. Since it is init data it will be freed anyway,
this should be ok.
