serial: Fix UPIO_MEM comment

The original semantics of UPIO_MEM did not include the notion of bitness
and endianness; different drivers used UPIO_MEM to refer to their original
mmio bitness/endianness. For example, for the 8250 driver this is 8-bit LE
but for the amba-pl011 driver this is 16-bit LE. Since UPIO_* values are
userspace ABI via TIOCGSERIAL/TIOCSSERIAL ioctls, the original meaning of
UPIIO_MEM must remain as it was: the original mmio stride/width/endianness
of the driver.
