amdkfd: Copy from the proper user command pointer

8f1d57c17248 ("amdkfd: don't open-code memdup_user()") mistakenly uses
an uninitialized local pointer, gcc complains:

  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_chardev.c: In function ‘kfd_ioctl_dbg_address_watch’:
  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_chardev.c:562:12: warning: ‘args_buff’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
    args_buff = memdup_user(args_buff,
                ^

Fix it.
