net: sock: remove dead cgroup methods from struct proto

The cgroup methods are no longer used after baac50bbc3cd ("net:
tcp_memcontrol: simplify linkage between socket and page counter").
The hunk to delete them was included in the original patch but must
have gotten lost during conflict resolution on the way upstream.
