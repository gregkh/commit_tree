ovs: limit ovs recursions in ovs_execute_actions to not corrupt stack

It was seen that defective configurations of openvswitch could overwrite
the STACK_END_MAGIC and cause a hard crash of the kernel because of too
many recursions within ovs.

This problem arises due to the high stack usage of openvswitch. The rest
of the kernel is fine with the current limit of 10 (RECURSION_LIMIT).

We use the already existing recursion counter in ovs_execute_actions to
implement an upper bound of 5 recursions.
