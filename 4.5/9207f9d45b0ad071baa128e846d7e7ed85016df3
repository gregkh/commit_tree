net: preserve IP control block during GSO segmentation

Skb_gso_segment() uses skb control block during segmentation.
This patch adds 32-bytes room for previous control block which
will be copied into all resulting segments.

This patch fixes kernel crash during fragmenting forwarded packets.
Fragmentation requires valid IP CB in skb for clearing ip options.
Also patch removes custom save/restore in ovs code, now it's redundant.
