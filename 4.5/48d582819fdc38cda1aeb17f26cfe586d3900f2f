ASoC: rsnd: remove all modules when PIO fallback

Current Renesas sound is supporting PIO fallback if it can't use DMA.
In such case, it should remove all attached modules, but current driver
is missing about CTU/MIX. Because current implement requests
specific mod for remove.
To avoid same things in future, this patch removes all mods,
and re-connects SSI when PIO fallback case.
