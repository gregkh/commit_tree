[media] media: Amend media graph walk API by init and cleanup functions

Add media_entity_graph_walk_init() and media_entity_graph_walk_cleanup()
functions in order to dynamically allocate memory for the graph. This is
not done in media_entity_graph_walk_start() as there are situations where
e.g. correct error handling, that itself may not fail, requires successful
graph walk.
