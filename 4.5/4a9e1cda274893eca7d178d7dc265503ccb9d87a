mm: bring in additional flag for fixup_user_fault to signal unlock

During Jason's work with postcopy migration support for s390 a problem
regarding gmap faults was discovered.

The gmap code will call fixup_user_fault which will end up always in
handle_mm_fault.  Till now we never cared about retries, but as the
userfaultfd code kind of relies on it.  this needs some fix.

This patchset does not take care of the futex code.  I will now look
closer at this.

This patch (of 2):

With the introduction of userfaultfd, kvm on s390 needs fixup_user_fault
to pass in FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY and give feedback if during the
faulting we ever unlocked mmap_sem.

This patch brings in the logic to handle retries as well as it cleans up
the current documentation.  fixup_user_fault was not having the same
semantics as filemap_fault.  It never indicated if a retry happened and
so a caller wasn't able to handle that case.  So we now changed the
behaviour to always retry a locked mmap_sem.
