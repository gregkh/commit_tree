clk: at91: Revert "keep slow clk enabled to prevent system hang"

Commit dca1a4b5ff6e ("clk: at91: keep slow clk enabled to prevent system
hang") added a workaround for the slow clock as it is not properly handled
by its users.

Now that the slow clock is taken properly by the drivers, this workaround
is not necessary anymore, revert it.
