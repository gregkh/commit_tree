dmaengine: tegra-apb: Correct runtime-pm usage

The tegra-apb DMA driver enables runtime-pm but never calls
pm_runtime_get/put and hence the runtime-pm callbacks are never invoked.
The driver manages the clocks by directly calling clk_prepare_enable()
and clk_unprepare_disable().

Fix this by replacing the clk_prepare_enable() and clk_disable_unprepare()
with pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put(), respectively. Note that
the consequence of this is that if runtime-pm is disabled, then the clocks
will remain on the entire time the driver is loaded. However, if
runtime-pm is disabled, then power is not most likely not a concern.
