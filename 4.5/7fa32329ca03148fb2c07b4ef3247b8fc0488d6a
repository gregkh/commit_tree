i2c: cadence: Move to sensible power management

Currently the clocks are enabled at probe and disabled at remove.
Which keeps the clocks enabled even if no transaction is going on.
This patch enables the clocks at the start of transfer and disables
after it.

Also adapts to runtime pm.

converts dev pm to const to silence a checkpatch warning.
