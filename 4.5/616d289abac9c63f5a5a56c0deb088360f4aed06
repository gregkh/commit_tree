ARM: dts: Remove fimd node from exynos5422-odroidxu3-common

FIMD device is not used at all on Exynos5422-based Odroid XU3-lite and
XU4. XU3 board theorethically can support FIMD with DisplayPort
connector, but due to hw limitation/design it doesn't work in most
cases. It is also not even enabled in XU3 dts file.

FIMD node was enabled mainly due to limitation of early Exynos DRM
driver, which didn't initialize properly when no FIMD device was
available. This node can be now safely removed from XU3-common dtsi and
added layer to Odroid XU3 dts, when Display Port driver gets enabled.
