perf/x86/intel: Add perf core PMU support for Intel Knights Landing

Knights Landing core is based on Silvermont core with several differences.
Like Silvermont, Knights Landing has 8 pairs of LBR MSRs. However, the
LBR MSRs addresses match those of the Xeon cores' first 8 pairs of LBR MSRs
Unlike Silvermont, Knights Landing supports hyperthreading. Knights Landing
offcore response events config register mask is different from that of the
Silvermont.

This patch was developed based on a patch from Andi Kleen.
