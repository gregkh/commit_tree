hv_netvsc: Restore needed_headroom request

Commit c0eb454034aa ("hv_netvsc: Don't ask for additional head room in the
skb") got rid of needed_headroom setting for the driver. With the change I
hit the following issue trying to use ptkgen module:

[   57.522021] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:1128!
[   57.522021] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
...
[   58.721068] Call Trace:

[   58.721068]  [<ffffffffa02f9907>] pktgen_thread_worker+0x257/0x1920 [pktgen]

Basically, we're calling skb_cow_head(skb, RNDIS_AND_PPI_SIZE) and crash on
    if (skb_shared(skb))
        BUG();

We probably need to restore needed_headroom setting (but shrunk to
RNDIS_AND_PPI_SIZE as we don't need more) to request the required headroom
space. In theory, it should not give us performance penalty.
