be2net: cleanup FW flash image related macro defines

Many constant definitions relating to the FW-image layout
(such as section offset values) were defined in decimal format rather than
hexa-decimal. This makes this part of the code un-readable. Also some
defines related to BE2 are labeld "g2" and defines related to BE3 are
labeled "g3".  This patch cleans up all of this to make this code more
readable.
