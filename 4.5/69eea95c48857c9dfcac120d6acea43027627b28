s390/pci_dma: fix DMA table corruption with > 4 TB main memory

DMA addresses returned from map_page() are calculated by using an iommu
bitmap plus a start_dma offset. The size of this bitmap is based on the main
memory size. If we have more than (4 TB - start_dma) main memory, the DMA
address calculation will also produce addresses > 4 TB. Such addresses
cannot be inserted in the 3-level DMA page table, instead the entries
modulo 4 TB will be overwritten.

Fix this by restricting the iommu bitmap size to (4 TB - start_dma).
Also set zdev->end_dma to the actual end address of the usable
range, instead of the theoretical maximum as reported by the hardware,
which fixes a sanity check in dma_map() and also the IOMMU API domain
geometry aperture calculation.
