spi: sun4i: Prevent chip-select from being activated twice before a transfer

The SPI core calls set_cs before a transfer, but the SUN4I_CTL_CS_MANUAL
flag is only set in transfer_one. This leads to the following pattern on
the chip-select line (with runtime power-management on every transfer,
without it only on the first one):

activate, deactivate, activate, transfer, deactivate

Moving the configuration of the SUN4I_CTL_CS_MANUAL flag from transfer_one
to set_cs removes the double activation.
