ftrace: Add variable ftrace_expected for archs to show expected code

When an anomaly is found while modifying function code, ftrace_bug() is
called which disables the function tracing infrastructure and reports
information about what failed. If the code that is to be replaced does not
match what is expected, then actual code is shown. Currently there is no
arch generic way to show what was expected.

Add a new variable pointer calld ftrace_expected that the arch code can set
to point to what it expected so that ftrace_bug() can report the actual text
as well as the text that was expected to be there.
