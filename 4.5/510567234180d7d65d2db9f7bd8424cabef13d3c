drm/i915: Add soft-pinning API for execbuffer

Userspace can pass in an offset that it presumes the object is located
at. The kernel will then do its utmost to fit the object into that
location. The assumption is that userspace is handling its own object
locations (for example along with full-ppgtt) and that the kernel will
rarely have to make space for the user's requests.

v2: Fix i915_gem_evict_range() (now evict_for_vma) to handle ordinary
and fixed objects within the same batch
