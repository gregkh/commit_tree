ASoC: rsnd: DMA become SSI/SRC member

Renesas sound needs many devices
(SSI/SSIU/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC/CMD/AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp).
SSI/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC are implemented as module.
SSI parent, SSIU are implemented as part of SSI
CMD is implemented as part of CTU/MIX/DVC
AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp are implemented as part of SSI/SRC
It is nice sense that these all devices are implemented as mod.

Current rsnd_mod is member of rsnd_mod. But the DMA user is only
SSI/SRC. This DMA will be implemented as module. As 1st step, DMA
become SSI/SRC member by this patch.
