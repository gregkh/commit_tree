drm/i915: Turn __raw_i915_read8() & co. in to inline functions

There's no need for __raw_i915_read8() & co. to be macros, so make them
inline functions. To avoid typo mistakes generate the inline functions
using preprocessor templates.

We have a few users of the raw register acces functions outside
intel_uncore.c, so let's also move the functions into intel_drv.h.

While doing that switch I915_READ_FW() & co. to use the
__raw_i915_read() functions, and use the _FW macros everywhere
outside intel_uncore.c where we want to read registers without
grabbing forcewake and whatnot. The only exception is
i915_check_vgpu() which itself gets called from intel_uncore.c,
so using the __raw_i915_read stuff there seems appropriate.

v2: Squash in the intel_uncore.c->i915_drv.h move
    Convert I915_READ_FW() to use __raw_i915_read(), and use
    I915_READ_FW() outside of intel_uncore.c (Chris)
