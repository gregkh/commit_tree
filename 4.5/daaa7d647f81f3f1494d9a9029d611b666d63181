netfilter: ipv6: avoid nf_iterate recursion

The previous patch changed nf_ct_frag6_gather() to morph reassembled skb
with the previous one.

This means that the return value is always NULL or the skb argument.
So change it to an err value.

Instead of invoking NF_HOOK recursively with threshold to skip already-called hooks
we can now just return NF_ACCEPT to move on to the next hook except for
-EINPROGRESS (which means skb has been queued for reassembly), in which case we
return NF_STOLEN.
