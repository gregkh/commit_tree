ARM: add support for generic early_ioremap/early_memremap

This enables the generic early_ioremap implementation for ARM.

It uses the fixmap region reserved for kmap. Since early_ioremap
is only supported before paging_init(), and kmap is only supported
afterwards, this is guaranteed not to cause any clashes.
