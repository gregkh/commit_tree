drm/i915: Replace the aux ddc name switch statement with kasprintf()

Use kasprintf() to generate the "DPDDC-<port>" name for the aux helper.

To deal with errors properly make intel_dp_aux_init() return something,
and adjust the caller to match. It seems we were also missing a
intel_dp_mst_encoder_cleanup() call on edp (non-port A) init failures,
so add that too.

The whole error/cleanup ordering doesn't feel entirely sane to me, but
I'll leave that part alone for now.

v2: Use kasprintf() instead of a table, reorder patches (Chis)
