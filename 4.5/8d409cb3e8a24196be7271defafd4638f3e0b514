drm/i915: Fix hpd live status bits for g4x

Looks like g4x hpd live status bits actually agree with the spec. At
least they do on the machine I have, and apparently on Nick Bowler's
g4x as well.

So gm45 may be the only platform where they don't agree. At least
that seems to be the case based on the (somewhat incomplete)
logs/dumps in [1], and Daniel has also tested this on his gm45
sometime in the past.

So let's change the bits to match the spec on g4x. That actually makes
the g4x bits identical to vlv/chv so we can just share the code
between those platforms, leaving gm45 as the special case.
