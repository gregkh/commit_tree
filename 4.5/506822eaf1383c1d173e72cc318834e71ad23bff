ARM: ux500: replace legacy *,wakeup property with wakeup-source

Though the keyboard and other driver will continue to support the legacy
"gpio-key,wakeup", "linux,wakeup" boolean property to enable the wakeup
source, "wakeup-source" is the new standard binding.

This patch replaces all the legacy wakeup properties with the unified
"wakeup-source" property in order to avoid any futher copy-paste
duplication.
