PCI: rcar: Convert to DT resource parsing API

The main purpose of this change is to avoid calling pci_ioremap_io() as
this is not available on arm64.  However, instead of doing the range
parsing in this driver we can utilise of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources().

This is similar to changes made to the generic PCI host driver in commit
dbf9826d5797 ("PCI: generic: Convert to DT resource parsing API")
