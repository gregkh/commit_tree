Revert "powerpc/pci: Remove unused struct pci_dn.pcidev field"

This commit removed the pcidev field from struct pci_dn as it was no
longer in use by the kernel. However to support finding the
association of Nvlink devices to GPU devices from the device-tree this
field is required.

This reverts commit 250c7b277c65 ("powerpc/pci: Remove unused struct
pci_dn.pcidev field").
