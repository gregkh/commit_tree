drm: fix potential dangling else problems in for_each_ macros

We have serious dangling else bugs waiting to happen in our for_each_
style macros with ifs. Consider, for example,

 #define drm_for_each_plane_mask(plane, dev, plane_mask) \
         list_for_each_entry((plane), &(dev)->mode_config.plane_list, head) \
                 if ((plane_mask) & (1 << drm_plane_index(plane)))

If this is used in context:

	if (condition)
		drm_for_each_plane_mask(plane, dev, plane_mask);
	else
		foo();

foo() will be called for each plane *not* in plane_mask, if condition
holds, and not at all if condition doesn't hold.

Fix this by reversing the conditions in the macros, and adding an else
branch for the "for each" block, so that other if/else blocks can't
interfere. Provide a "for_each_if" helper macro to make it easier to get
this right.
