[media] media-device.h: Improve documentation and update it

Now that we moved the content of the media-framework.txt into
the kerneldoc documentation, move the per-function specific
documentation to the corresponding functions and clean it up.

It would be good if we had already the markdown kernel-doc
patches merged upstream, but, while we doesn't have it,
let's make it less ugly at device-drivers.xml.
