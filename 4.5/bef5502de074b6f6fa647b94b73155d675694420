ocfs2/dlm: ignore cleaning the migration mle that is inuse

We have found that migration source will trigger a BUG that the refcount
of mle is already zero before put when the target is down during
migration.  The situation is as follows:

dlm_migrate_lockres
  dlm_add_migration_mle
  dlm_mark_lockres_migrating
  dlm_get_mle_inuse
  <<<<<< Now the refcount of the mle is 2.
  dlm_send_one_lockres and wait for the target to become the
  new master.
  <<<<<< o2hb detect the target down and clean the migration
  mle. Now the refcount is 1.

dlm_migrate_lockres woken, and put the mle twice when found the target
goes down which trigger the BUG with the following message:

  "ERROR: bad mle: ".
