workqueue: implement "workqueue.debug_force_rr_cpu" debug feature

Workqueue used to guarantee local execution for work items queued
without explicit target CPU.  The guarantee is gone now which can
break some usages in subtle ways.  To flush out those cases, this
patch implements a debug feature which forces round-robin CPU
selection for all such work items.

The debug feature defaults to off and can be enabled with a kernel
parameter.  The default can be flipped with a debug config option.
