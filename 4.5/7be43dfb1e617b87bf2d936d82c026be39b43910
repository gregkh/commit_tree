perf build: Set parallel making options build-test

'make build-test' is painful because of time consuming. In a full test,
all test cases are built twice with tools/perf/Makefile and
tools/perf/Makefile.perf. 'Makefile' automatically computes parallel
options for make, but 'Makefile.perf' not, so all test cases is built
with one job. It is very slow.

This patch adds '-j' options to Makefile.perf testing. It computes
parallel building options like what tools/perf/Makefile does, and pass
'-j' option to Makefile.perf test.
