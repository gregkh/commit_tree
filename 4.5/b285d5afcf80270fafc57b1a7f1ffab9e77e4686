[media] omap3isp: remove pads prefix from isp_create_pads_links()

The function that creates the links between ISP internal and external
entities is called isp_create_pads_links() but the "pads" prefix is
redundant since the driver doesn't handle any other kind of link so
it can just be removed.

While being there, fix the function's kernel-doc since is not using
a proper format.
