xattr handlers: Simplify list operation

Change the list operation to only return whether or not an attribute
should be listed.  Copying the attribute names into the buffer is moved
to the callers.

Since the result only depends on the dentry and not on the attribute
name, we do not pass the attribute name to list operations.
