tools build feature: Move dwarf post unwind choice output into perf

We decide what dwarf unwind to choose way after the Makefile.feature
makefile is included. The $(dwarf-post-unwind) is not even set at that
time. For the same reason it was never included in FEATURE-DUMP file.

Moving it into perf VF=1 verbose display.

  $ make VF=1
    BUILD:   Doing 'make -j4' parallel build
  Auto-detecting system features:
  ...                         dwarf: [ on  ]
  ...
  ...                 LIBUNWIND_DIR:
  ...                     LIBDW_DIR:
  ...     DWARF post unwind library: libunwind
  ...
