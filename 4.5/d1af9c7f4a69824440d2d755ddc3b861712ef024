ncr5380: Remove UNSAFE macro

Configuring core drivers using macros like this one prevents re-unifying
the core driver forks, and prevents implementing the core driver as a
library or a platform driver.

The UNSAFE macro in particular is a poor workaround for the problem of
interrupt latency. Releasing the locks complicates things because then we
would have to handle the possibility of EH handler invocation during a
PDMA transfer.

The comments say that instead of using this macro, "you're going to be
better off twiddling with transfersize". I agree. Remove this stuff.
