net: tcp_memcontrol: remove bogus hierarchy pressure propagation

When a cgroup currently breaches its socket memory limit, it enters
memory pressure mode for itself and its *ancestors*.  This throttles
transmission in unrelated sibling and cousin subtrees that have nothing
to do with the breached limit.

On the contrary, breaching a limit should make that group and its
*children* enter memory pressure mode.  But this happens already, albeit
lazily: if an ancestor limit is breached, siblings will enter memory
pressure on their own once the next packet arrives for them.

So no additional hierarchy code is needed.  Remove the bogus stuff.
