lib/mpi: only require buffers as big as needed for the integer

Since mpi_write_to_sgl and mpi_read_buffer explicitly left-align the
integers being written it makes no sense to require a buffer big enough for
the number + the leading zero bytes which are not written.  The error
returned also doesn't convey any information.  So instead require only the
size needed and return -EOVERFLOW to signal when buffer too short.
