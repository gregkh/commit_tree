component: Detach components when deleting master struct

component_master_add_with_match calls find_components which, if any
components already exist, it attaches to the master struct. However, if
we later encounter an error the master struct is deleted, leaving
components with a dangling pointer to it.

If the error was a temporary one, e.g. for probe deferral, then when
the master device is re-probed, it will fail to find the required
components as they appear to already be attached to a master.

Fix this by nulling components pointers to the master struct when it is
deleted. This code is factored out into a separate function so it can be
shared with component_master_del.
