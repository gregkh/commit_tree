cgroup: fix sock_cgroup_data initialization on earlier compilers

sock_cgroup_data is a struct containing an anonymous union.
sock_cgroup_set_prioidx() and sock_cgroup_set_classid() were
initializing a field inside the anonymous union as follows.

 struct sock_ccgroup_data skcd_buf = { .val = VAL };

While this is fine on more recent compilers, gcc-4.4.7 triggers the
following errors.

 include/linux/cgroup-defs.h: In function ‘sock_cgroup_set_prioidx’:
 include/linux/cgroup-defs.h:619: error: unknown field ‘val’ specified in initializer
 include/linux/cgroup-defs.h:619: warning: missing braces around initializer
 include/linux/cgroup-defs.h:619: warning: (near initialization for ‘skcd_buf.<anonymous>’)

This is because .val belongs to the anonymous union nested inside the
struct but the initializer is missing the nesting.  Fix it by adding
an extra pair of braces.
