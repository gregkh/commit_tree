MIPS: Add support for PIC32MZDA platform

This adds support for the Microchip PIC32 MIPS microcontroller with the
specific variant PIC32MZDA. PIC32MZDA is based on the MIPS m14KEc core
and boots using device tree.

This includes an early pin setup and early clock setup needed prior to
device tree being initialized. In additon, an interface is provided to
synchronize access to registers shared across several peripherals.
