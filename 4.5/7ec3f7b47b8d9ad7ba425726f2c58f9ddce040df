netfilter: nft_payload: add packet mangling support

Add support for mangling packet payload. Checksum for the specified base
header is updated automatically if requested, however no updates for any
kind of pseudo headers are supported, meaning no stateless NAT is supported.

For checksum updates different checksumming methods can be specified. The
currently supported methods are NONE for no checksum updates, and INET for
internet type checksums.
