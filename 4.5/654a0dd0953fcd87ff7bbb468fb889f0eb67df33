cgroup, memcg, writeback: drop spurious rcu locking around mem_cgroup_css_from_page()

In earlier versions, mem_cgroup_css_from_page() could return non-root
css on a legacy hierarchy which can go away and required rcu locking;
however, the eventual version simply returns the root cgroup if memcg is
on a legacy hierarchy and thus doesn't need rcu locking around or in it.
Remove spurious rcu lockings.
