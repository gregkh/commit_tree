ncr5380: Remove H_NO macro and introduce dsprintk

Replace all H_NO and some HOSTNO macros (both peculiar to atari_NCR5380.c)
with a new dsprintk macro that's more useful and more consistent. The new
macro avoids a lot of boilerplate in new code in subsequent patches. Keep
NCR5380.c in sync. Remaining HOSTNO macros are removed as side-effects
of subsequent patches.
