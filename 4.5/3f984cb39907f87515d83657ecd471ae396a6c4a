coccinelle: tests: unsigned value cannot be lesser than zero

Unsigned expressions cannot be lesser than zero. Presence of comparisons
'unsigned (<|<=|>|>=) 0' often indicates a bug, usually wrong type of variable.
The patch beside finding such comparisons tries to eliminate false positives,
mainly by bypassing range checks.

gcc can detect such comparisons also using -Wtype-limits switch, but it warns
also in correct cases, making too much noise.
