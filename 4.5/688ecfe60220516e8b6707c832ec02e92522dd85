bpf: hash: use per-bucket spinlock

Both htab_map_update_elem() and htab_map_delete_elem() can be
called from eBPF program, and they may be in kernel hot path,
so it isn't efficient to use a per-hashtable lock in this two
helpers.

The per-hashtable spinlock is used for protecting bucket's
hlist, and per-bucket lock is just enough. This patch converts
the per-hashtable lock into per-bucket spinlock, so that
contention can be decreased a lot.
