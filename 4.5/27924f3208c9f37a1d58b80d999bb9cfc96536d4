ASoC: rsnd: enable to use rsnd_dai_connect() from each mod

Renesas sound needs many devices
(SSI/SSIU/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC/CMD/AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp).
SSI/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC are implemented as module.
SSI parent, SSIU are implemented as part of SSI
CMD is implemented as part of CTU/MIX/DVC
AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp are implemented as part of SSI/SRC
It is nice sense that these all devices are implemented as mod.

DMAC/SSIU/SSI-parent/CMD will be implemented as module, but these are
not customer controlled module. These should be automatically install
to system. Because of this, rsnd_dai_connect() should be called from
each mod. SSI can be very special, because it will be installed as
SSI-parent / SSI-child. Thus, new rsnd_dai_connect() has type parameter
which should be mod->type except SSI-parent
