s390/dump: cleanup CPU save area handling

Introduce save_area_alloc(), save_area_boot_cpu(), save_area_add_regs()
and save_area_add_vxrs to deal with storing the CPU state in case of a
system dump. Remove struct save_area and save_area_ext, and create a new
struct save_area as a local definition to arch/s390/kernel/crash_dump.c.
Copy each individual field from the hardware status area to the save area,
storing the minimum of required data.
