iio: core: Introduce IIO configfs support

This patch creates the IIO configfs root group. The group
will appear under <mount-point>/iio/, usually /config/iio.

We introduce configfs support in IIO in order to be able to easily
create IIO objects from userspace. The first supported IIO objects
are triggers introduced with next patches.
