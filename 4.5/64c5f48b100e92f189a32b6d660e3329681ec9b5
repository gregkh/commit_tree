usb: renesas_usbhs: Modify ep.caps.type_xxx and usb_ep_maxpacket_limit()

This patch modifies the ep.caps.type_{iso,bulk,int} setting and
the second argument of usb_ep_maxpacket_limit() using
the dparam.pipe_configs.

In the previous code, all the type_{iso,bulk,int} were set to true.
However, to avoid waste time for finding suitable pipe in usb_ep_enable(),
this driver should set correct type.
Also the second argument of usb_ep_maxpacket_limit() was set to 512
even if the pipe is isochronous or interrupt. So, this driver could
not bind a gadget driver like the g_audio driver.
