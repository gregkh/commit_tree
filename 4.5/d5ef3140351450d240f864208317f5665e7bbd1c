perf bpf: Fix build breakage due to libbpf

perf build is currently (v4.4-rc5) broken on powerpc:

  bpf.c:28:4: error: #error __NR_bpf not defined. libbpf does not support
  your arch.
   #  error __NR_bpf not defined. libbpf does not support your arch.
      ^

Fix this by including tools/scripts/Makefile.arch for the proper $ARCH
macro. While at it, remove redundant LP64 macro definition.

Also, since libbpf require $(srctree) now, detect the path of srctree
like perf.
