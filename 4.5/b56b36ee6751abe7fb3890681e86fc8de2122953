livepatch: Cleanup module page permission changes

Calling set_memory_rw() and set_memory_ro() for every iteration of the
loop in klp_write_object_relocations() is messy, inefficient, and
error-prone.

Change all the read-only pages to read-write before the loop and convert
them back to read-only again afterwards.
