wil6210: support for platform specific crash recovery

Added a simple interface for platform to perform crash
recovery.
When firmware crashes, wil driver can notify the platform
which can trigger a crash recovery process. During
the process the platform can request a ram dump
from the wil driver as well as control when firmware
recovery will start. This interface allows the platform
to implement a more advanced crash recovery, for
example to reset dependent subsystems in proper order, or
to provide its own notifications during the recovery process.
