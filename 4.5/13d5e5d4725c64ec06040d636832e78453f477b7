ALSA: seq: Fix double port list deletion

The commit [7f0973e973cd: ALSA: seq: Fix lockdep warnings due to
double mutex locks] split the management of two linked lists (source
and destination) into two individual calls for avoiding the AB/BA
deadlock.  However, this may leave the possible double deletion of one
of two lists when the counterpart is being deleted concurrently.
It ends up with a list corruption, as revealed by syzkaller fuzzer.

This patch fixes it by checking the list emptiness and skipping the
deletion and the following process.
