mfd: intel-lpss: Pass SDA hold time to I2C host controller driver

Intel Skylake the LPSS I2C pad circuit has internal delays that require
programming non-zero SDA hold time for the I2C host controller. If this is
not done communication to slave devices may fail with arbitration lost
errors like the one seen below taken from Lenovo Yoga 900:

  i2c_hid i2c-SYNA2B29:00: Fetching the HID descriptor
  i2c_hid i2c-SYNA2B29:00: __i2c_hid_command: cmd=20 00
  i2c_designware i2c_designware.1: i2c_dw_handle_tx_abort: lost arbitration

To fix this we follow what the Windows driver is doing and pass the default
SDA hold time of 230 ns to all Intel Skylake host controllers. This still
allows the platform to override these values by passing special ACPI
methods SSCN and FMCN.
