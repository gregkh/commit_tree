Input: xpad - update Xbox One Force Feedback Support

There's apparently a serial number woven into both input and output
packets; neglecting to specify a valid serial number causes the controller
to ignore the rumble packets.

The scale of the rumble was also apparently halved in the packets.

The initialization packet had to be changed to allow force feedback to
work.

see https://github.com/paroj/xpad/issues/7 for details.
