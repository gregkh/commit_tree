iio: core: Introduce IIO software triggers

A software trigger associates an IIO device trigger with a software
interrupt source (e.g: timer, sysfs). This patch adds the generic
infrastructure for handling software triggers.

Software interrupts sources are kept in a iio_trigger_types_list and
registered separately when the associated kernel module is loaded.

Software triggers can be created directly from drivers or from user
space via configfs interface.

To sum up, this dynamically creates "triggers" group to be found under
/config/iio/triggers and offers the possibility of dynamically
creating trigger types groups. The first supported trigger type is
"hrtimer" found under /config/iio/triggers/hrtimer.
