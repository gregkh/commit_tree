[media] v4l2-dv-timings: add condition checks for reduced fps

Added a helper function to check necessary conditions required for
reduced fps. The reduced fps is supported for CVT and CEA861 timings.
CVT supports reduced fps only if reduced blanking v2 (indicated by
vsync = 8) is true. Whereas CEA861 supports reduced fps if
V4L2_DV_FL_CAN_REDUCE_FPS flag is true.
