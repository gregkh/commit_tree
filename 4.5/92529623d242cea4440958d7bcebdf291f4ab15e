HID: debug: improve hid_debug_event()

The code in hid_debug_event() causes horrible code generation. First,
we do a strlen() call for every byte we copy (we're doing a store to
global memory, so gcc has no way of proving that strlen(buf) doesn't
change). Second, since both i, list->tail and HID_DEBUG_BUFSIZE have
signed type, the modulo computation has to take into account the
possibility that list->tail+i is negative, so it's not just a simple
and.

Fix the former by simply not doing strlen() at all (we have to load
buf[i] anyway, so testing it is almost free) and the latter by
changing i to unsigned. This cuts 29% (69 bytes) of the size of the
function.
