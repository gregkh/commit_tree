staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: do board reset early in (*auto_attach)

The board reset function disables and clears all interrupts. It also
resets all the digital output channels to 0.

Interrupts are not currently used by this driver. For asthetics, do
the board reset early in the (*auto_attach) to make sure the interrupts
are disabled in case this feature is added.
