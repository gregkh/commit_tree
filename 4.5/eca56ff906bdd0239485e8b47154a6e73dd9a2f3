mm, shmem: add internal shmem resident memory accounting

Currently looking at /proc/<pid>/status or statm, there is no way to
distinguish shmem pages from pages mapped to a regular file (shmem pages
are mapped to /dev/zero), even though their implication in actual memory
use is quite different.

The internal accounting currently counts shmem pages together with
regular files.  As a preparation to extend the userspace interfaces,
this patch adds MM_SHMEMPAGES counter to mm_rss_stat to account for
shmem pages separately from MM_FILEPAGES.  The next patch will expose it
to userspace - this patch doesn't change the exported values yet, by
adding up MM_SHMEMPAGES to MM_FILEPAGES at places where MM_FILEPAGES was
used before.  The only user-visible change after this patch is the OOM
killer message that separates the reported "shmem-rss" from "file-rss".
