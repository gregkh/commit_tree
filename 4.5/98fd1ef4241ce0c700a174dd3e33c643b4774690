mm: soft-offline: exit with failure for non anonymous thp

Currently memory_failure() doesn't handle non anonymous thp case,
because we can hardly expect the error handling to be successful, and it
can just hit some corner case which results in BUG_ON or something
severe like that.  This is also the case for soft offline code, so let's
make it in the same way.

Orignal code has a MF_COUNT_INCREASED check before put_hwpoison_page(),
but it's unnecessary because get_any_page() is already called when
running on this code, which takes a refcount of the target page
regardress of the flag.  So this patch also removes it.
