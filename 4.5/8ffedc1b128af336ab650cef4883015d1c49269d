staging:iio:ad7780: Remove the ad7780_platform_data

The ad7780_platform_data contains just the reference voltage information.
Since the preferred way of specifying this information is using the Linux
regulator framework and the ad7780 platform_data is not used by other
users, it can be completely removed.
