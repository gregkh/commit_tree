ALSA: timer: Fix leftover link at closing

In ALSA timer core, the active timer instance is managed in
active_list linked list.  Each element is added / removed dynamically
at timer start, stop and in timer interrupt.  The problem is that
snd_timer_interrupt() has a thinko and leaves the element in
active_list when it's the last opened element.  This eventually leads
to list corruption or use-after-free error.

This hasn't been revealed because we used to delete the list forcibly
in snd_timer_stop() in the past.  However, the recent fix avoids the
double-stop behavior (in commit [f784beb75ce8: ALSA: timer: Fix link
corruption due to double start or stop]), and this leak hits reality.

This patch fixes the link management in snd_timer_interrupt().  Now it
simply unlinks no matter which stream is.
