lightnvm: refactor end_io functions for sync

To implement sync I/O support within the LightNVM core, the end_io
functions are refactored to take an end_io function pointer instead of
testing for initialized media manager, followed by calling its end_io
function.

Sync I/O can then be implemented using a callback that signal I/O
completion. This is similar to the logic found in blk_to_execute_io().
By implementing it this way, the underlying device I/Os submission logic
is abstracted away from core, targets, and media managers.
