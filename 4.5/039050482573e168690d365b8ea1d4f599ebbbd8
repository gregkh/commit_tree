perf hists browser: Update nr entries regardless of min percent

When perf report on TUI was called with -S symbol filter, it should
update nr entries even if min_pcnt is 0.  IIRC the reason was to update
nr entries after applying minimum percent threshold.  But if symbol
filter was given on command line (with -S option), it should use
hists->nr_non_filtered_entries instead of hists->nr_entries.

So this patch fixes a bug of navigating hists browser that the cursor
goes beyond the number of entries when -S (or similar) option is used.
