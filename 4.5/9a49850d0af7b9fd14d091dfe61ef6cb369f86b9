tcp: Fix conditions to determine checksum offload

In tcp_send_sendpage and tcp_sendmsg we check the route capabilities to
determine if checksum offload can be performed. This check currently
does not take the IP protocol into account for devices that advertise
only one of NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM or NETIF_F_IP_CSUM. This patch adds a
function to check capabilities for checksum offload with a socket
called sk_check_csum_caps. This function checks for specific IPv4 or
IPv6 offload support based on the family of the socket.
