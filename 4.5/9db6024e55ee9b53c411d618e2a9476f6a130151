ncr5380: Replace READ_OVERRUNS macro with FLAG_NO_DMA_FIXUPS

The workarounds for chip errata appear twice, in slightly different
forms. One is used when defined(REAL_DMA) || defined(REAL_DMA_POLL), the
other when defined(PSEUDO_DMA). In the PDMA case, the workarounds have
been made conditional on FLAG_NO_DMA_FIXUPS. Do the same for the DMA case,
to eliminate the READ_OVERRUNS macro.
