usb: host: xhci-plat: fix NULL pointer in probe for device tree case

During probe, in the device tree case, the data pointer associated to a
compatible is dereferenced. However, not all the compatibles are
associated to a private data pointer.

The generic-xhci and the xhci-platform don't need them, this patch adds a
test on the data pointer before accessing it, avoiding a kernel crash.
