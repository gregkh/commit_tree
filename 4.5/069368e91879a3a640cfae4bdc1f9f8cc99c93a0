lightnvm: move ppa erase logic to core

A device may function in single, dual or quad plane mode. The gennvm
media manager manages this with explicit helpers. They convert a single
ppa to 1, 2 or 4 separate ppas in a ppa list. To aid implementation of
recovery and system blocks, this functionality can be moved directly
into the core.
