Bluetooth: Add stubs for synchronous HCI request functionality

Prepare hci_request.c to have code for doing synchronous HCI requests,
such as LE scanning or advertising changes. The necessary work
callbacks will be set up in hci_request_setup() and cleaned up in
hci_request_cancel_all(). The former is used when an HCI device get
registered, and the latter each time it is powered off (or
unregistered).
