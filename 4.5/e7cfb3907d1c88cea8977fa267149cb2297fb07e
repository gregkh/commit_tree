staging/emxx_udc: fix 64-bit warnings

ARCH_SHMOBILE is coming to arm64, which creates new warnings in allmodconfig:

drivers/staging/emxx_udc/emxx_udc.c: In function '_nbu2ss_out_dma':
drivers/staging/emxx_udc/emxx_udc.c:843:45: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
  _nbu2ss_writel(&preg->EP_DCR[num].EP_TADR, (u32)pBuffer);

This is clearly a mistake from confusing a dma_addr_t with a pointer,
so the fix is to use the correct types in two places.

The third warning of this kind is a check for an unaligned pointer,
which should be done by casting the pointer to uintptr_t, not int.
