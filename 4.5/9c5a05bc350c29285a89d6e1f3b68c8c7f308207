block: fix pfn_mkwrite() DAX fault handler

Previously the pfn_mkwrite() fault handler for raw block devices called
bldev_dax_fault() -> __dax_fault() to do a full DAX page fault.

Really what the pfn_mkwrite() fault handler needs to do is call
dax_pfn_mkwrite() to make sure that the radix tree entry for the given
PTE is marked as dirty so that a follow-up fsync or msync call will
flush it durably to media.
