staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: reset digital outputs in subdevice init

Currently the board reset function also resets the digital output channels
to 0. This works but it makes the reset function a bit messy and each
board type has to be handled special.

Move the digital output reset into the subdevice init where it can be
handle based on the subdevice setup.
