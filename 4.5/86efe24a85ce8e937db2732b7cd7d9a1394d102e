drm/i915/skl: Consider plane rotation when calculating stride in skl_do_mmio_flip

Previously rotation was ignored and wrong stride programmed
into the plane registers resulting in a corrupt image on screen.

v2: Do not access potentialy old plane state at flip time,
    but store the rotation value at the time of queing the flip.

v3: No need to pass rotation to intel_queue_mmio_flip since it
    is available in the crtc. (Ville)
