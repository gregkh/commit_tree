ASoC: hdac_hdmi: Use list to add pins and converters

Future platforms may have a different set of pins/converters.
So use lists to add pins and converters based on enumeration.

Also it may be required to connect any converter to any pin
dynamically as per different use cases (for example DP is
connected to pin 6 on skylake board). So this will help in
dynamically select and route.

Fix the dai map as well to use the pin/cvt from list. Not
enabling all dai maps for now.
