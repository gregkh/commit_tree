ARM: add UEFI stub support

This patch adds EFI stub support for the ARM Linux kernel.

The EFI stub operates similarly to the x86 and arm64 stubs: it is a
shim between the EFI firmware and the normal zImage entry point, and
sets up the environment that the zImage is expecting. This includes
optionally loading the initrd and device tree from the system partition
based on the kernel command line.
