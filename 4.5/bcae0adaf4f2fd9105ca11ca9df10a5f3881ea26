staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: remove boardinfo 'cardtype'

This member of the boardinfo is identical to the offset of the boardinfo
in the boardtypes array. It's also passed as the 'context' to the driver
(*auto_attach).

The 'cardtype' is only needed by the (*auto_attach) to determine which
PCI BAR to use and in pci_dio_reset() to handle the board specific code.

Remove the 'cardtype' member and use the 'context' value instead.
