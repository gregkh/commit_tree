rcu: Stop disabling interrupts in scheduler fastpaths

We need the scheduler's fastpaths to be, well, fast, and unnecessarily
disabling and re-enabling interrupts is not necessarily consistent with
this goal.  Especially given that there are regions of the scheduler that
already have interrupts disabled.

This commit therefore moves the call to rcu_note_context_switch()
to one of the interrupts-disabled regions of the scheduler, and
removes the now-redundant disabling and re-enabling of interrupts from
rcu_note_context_switch() and the functions it calls.
