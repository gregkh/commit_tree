drm/i915: Hide underruns from eDP PLL and port enable on ILK

We get underruns on the other pipe when enabling the CPU eDP PLL and
port on ILK.

Bspec knows about the PLL issue, and recommends doing a vblank wait just
prior to enabling the PLL. That does seem to help, but unfortunately we
get another underrun when actually enabling the CPU eDP port. Bspec
doesn't mention that at all, and the same vblank wait trick doesn't
appear to be effective there.

Since I have no better clue how to deal with this, just hide the errors.
