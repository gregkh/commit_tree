ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix the dapm machine map

DAPM Machine map for machine was not specifying the paths
correctly.

The correct order should be:
"DMIC01 Rx" (SoC DMIC BE), connected to "DMIC AIF" (DMic Codec
AIF) and then "DMic" (DMic codec Input) connected to "SoC DMIC"
(Machine DMIC MIC Widget)
