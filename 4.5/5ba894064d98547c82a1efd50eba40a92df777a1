drm: Rename MODE_UNVERIFIED to MODE_STALE

MODE_UNVERIFIED actually means that the mode came from a previous probe,
and if the new probe doesn't produce a matching mode it will get pruned
from the list. Rename the flag to MODE_STALE to better convey the
meaning.

v2: Rebased due to conflicts with Daniel's doc stuff
