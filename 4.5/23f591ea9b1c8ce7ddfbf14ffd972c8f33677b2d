ath10k: split driver info messages during device initialisation

Earlier we printed all the info messages after a successful device
initialisation and firmware boot, but that's problematic if something goes
wrong and there's no easy way to know what firmware version was used and so on.

Split the info messages into smaller pieces and print them as soon as we have
the info available.
