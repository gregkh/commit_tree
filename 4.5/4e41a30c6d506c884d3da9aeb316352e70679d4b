mm: hwpoison: adjust for new thp refcounting

Some mm-related BUG_ON()s could trigger from hwpoison code due to recent
changes in thp refcounting rule.  This patch fixes them up.

In the new refcounting, we no longer use tail->_mapcount to keep tail's
refcount, and thereby we can simplify get/put_hwpoison_page().

And another change is that tail's refcount is not transferred to the raw
page during thp split (more precisely, in new rule we don't take
refcount on tail page any more.) So when we need thp split, we have to
transfer the refcount properly to the 4kB soft-offlined page before
migration.

thp split code goes into core code only when precheck
(total_mapcount(head) == page_count(head) - 1) passes to avoid useless
split, where we assume that one refcount is held by the caller of thp
split and the others are taken via mapping.  To meet this assumption,
this patch moves thp split part in soft_offline_page() after
get_any_page().
