NVMe: fix build with CONFIG_NVM enabled

Looks like I didn't test with CONFIG_NVM enabled, and neither did
the build bot.

Most of this is really weird crazy shit in the lighnvm support, though.

Struct nvme_ns is a structure for the NVM I/O command set, and it has
no business poking into it.  Second this commit:

    nvme: lightnvm: use admin queues for admin cmds

Does even more crazy stuff.  If a function gets a request_queue parameter
passed it'd better use that and not look for another one.
