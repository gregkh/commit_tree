iwlwifi: mvm: Support setting continuous recording debug mode

Add ability to set the continuous recording mode of the FW, while
the FW debug data is configured to be stored on the NIC.
This could be useful for storing large segments of FW usniffer
debug data on the host, while having small store space on the NIC.
The host receives the usniffer data through the regular RX path, and
the data can get extracted using trace-cmd.
