bnx2x: avoid soft lockup in bnx2x_poll()

Under heavy TX load, bnx2x_poll() can loop forever and trigger
soft lockup bugs.

A napi poll handler must yield after one TX completion round,
risk of livelock is too high otherwise.

Bug is very easy to trigger using a debug build, and udp flood, because
of added cpu cycles in TX completion, and we do not receive enough
packets to break the loop.
