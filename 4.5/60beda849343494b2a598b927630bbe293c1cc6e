perf: Untangle 'owner' confusion

There are two concepts of owner wrt an event and they are conflated:

 - event::owner / event::owner_list,
   used by prctl(.option = PR_TASK_PERF_EVENTS_{EN,DIS}ABLE).

 - the 'owner' of the event object, typically the file descriptor.

Currently these two concepts are conflated, which gives trouble with
scm_rights passing of file descriptors. Passing the event and then
closing the creating task would render the event 'orphan' and would
have it cleared out. Unlikely what is expectd.

This patch untangles these two concepts by using PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT
to denote the second type.
