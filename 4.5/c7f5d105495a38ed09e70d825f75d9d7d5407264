net: Add eth_platform_get_mac_address() helper.

A repeating pattern in drivers has become to use OF node information
and, if not found, platform specific host information to extract the
ethernet address for a given device.

Currently this is done with a call to of_get_mac_address() and then
some ifdef'd stuff for SPARC.

Consolidate this into a portable routine, and provide the
arch_get_platform_mac_address() weak function hook for all
architectures to implement if they want.
