powerpc/powernv: remove FW_FEATURE_OPALv3 and just use FW_FEATURE_OPAL

Long ago, only in the lab, there was OPALv1 and OPALv2. Now there is
just OPALv3, with nobody ever expecting anything on pre-OPALv3 to
be cared about or supported by mainline kernels.

So, let's remove FW_FEATURE_OPALv3 and instead use FW_FEATURE_OPAL
exclusively.
