Drivers: hv: remove code duplication between vmbus_recvpacket()/vmbus_recvpacket_raw()

vmbus_recvpacket() and vmbus_recvpacket_raw() are almost identical but
there are two discrepancies:
1) vmbus_recvpacket() doesn't propagate errors from hv_ringbuffer_read()
   which looks like it is not desired.
2) There is an error message printed in packetlen > bufferlen case in
   vmbus_recvpacket(). I'm removing it as it is usless for users to see
   such messages and /vmbus_recvpacket_raw() doesn't have it.
