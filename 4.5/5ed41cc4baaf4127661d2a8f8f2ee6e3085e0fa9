gpiolib: do not allow to insert an empty gpiochip

We need to check if number of gpio is positive if there is no
such check in devicetree or acpi or whatever called before
gpiochip_add.

I suppose that devicetree and acpi do not allow insert gpiochip
with zero number but I do not know if it is enough to ignore
this check in gpiochip_add.
