ASoC: Support registering a DAI dynamically

Define API snd_soc_register_dai() to add a DAI dynamically and
create the DAI widgets. Topology can use this API to register DAIs
when probing a component with topology info. These DAIs's playback
& capture widgets will be freed when the sound card is unregistered
and the DAIs will be freed when cleaning up the component.

And a dobj is embedded into the struct snd_soc_dai_driver. Topology
can use the dobj to find the DAI drivers created by it and free them
when the topology component is removed.
