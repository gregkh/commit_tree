drivers/hwspinlock: fix race between radix tree insertion and lookup

of_hwspin_lock_get_id() is protected by the RCU lock, which means that
insertions can occur simultaneously with the lookup.  If the radix tree
transitions from a height of 0, we can see a slot with the indirect_ptr
bit set, which will cause us to at least read random memory, and could
cause other havoc.

Fix this by using the newly introduced radix_tree_iter_retry().
