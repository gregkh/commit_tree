ASoC: imx-spdif: Fix crash on suspend

When registering a ASoC card the driver data of the parent device is set to
point to the card. This driver data is used in the
snd_soc_suspend()/resume() callbacks.

The imx-spdif driver overwrites the driver data with custom data which
causes snd_soc_suspend() to crash.  Since the custom driver is not used
anywhere simply deleting the line which sets the custom driver data fixes
the issue.
