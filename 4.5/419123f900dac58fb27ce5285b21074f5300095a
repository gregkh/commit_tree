s390/spinlock: do not yield to a CPU in udelay/mdelay

It does not make sense to try to relinquish the time slice with diag 0x9c
to a CPU in a state that does not allow to schedule the CPU. The scenario
where this can happen is a CPU waiting in udelay/mdelay while holding a
spin-lock.

Add a CIF bit to tag a CPU in enabled wait and use it to detect that the
yield of a CPU will not be successful and skip the diagnose call.
