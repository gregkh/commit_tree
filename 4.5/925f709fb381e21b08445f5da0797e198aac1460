cpufreq-dt: correct dead link in documentation

commit 3566c5b277a4 ("PM / OPP: Create a directory for opp bindings")
renamed the file:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt
leaving a dead link in cpufreq/arm_big_little_dt.txt.

The link points now to the good file.
