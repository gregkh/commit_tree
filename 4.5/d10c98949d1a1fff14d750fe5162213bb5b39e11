[media] media: use entity.graph_obj.mdev instead of .parent

The struct media_entity has a .parent field that stores a pointer
to the parent struct media_device. But recently a media_gobj was
embedded into the entities and since struct media_gojb already has
a pointer to a struct media_device in the .mdev field, the .parent
field becomes redundant and can be removed.

This patch replaces all the usage of .parent by .graph_obj.mdev so
that field will become unused and can be removed on a later patch.

No functional changes.

The transformation was made using the following coccinelle spatch:

struct media_entity *me;
@@

- me->parent
+ me->graph_obj.mdev

struct media_entity *link;

- link->source->entity->parent
+ link->source->entity->graph_obj.mdev

struct exynos_video_entity *ve;

- ve->vdev.entity.parent
+ ve->vdev.entity.graph_obj.mdev
