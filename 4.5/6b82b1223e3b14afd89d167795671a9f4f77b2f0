usb: Add connected retry on resume for non SS devices

Currently usb_port_resume waits for up to 2 seconds for CONNECT
status for SS devices only. This change will do the same thing for
non-SS devices even though the reason is a little different. This
will fix an issue where VBUS is turned off during system wide
"suspend to ram" and some 2.0 devices take greater than the current
max of 100ms to show connected after VBUS is enabled. This is most
commonly seen on hard drive based devices and USB3.0 devices plugged
into a 2.0 only port.
