hisi_sas: Remove dependency on of_irq_count

Originally the driver would use of_irq_count to calculate how much
memory is required for storing the interrupt names, since the number of
interrupt sources for the controller is variable.  Since of_irq_count
cannot be used by the driver, use fixed names.
