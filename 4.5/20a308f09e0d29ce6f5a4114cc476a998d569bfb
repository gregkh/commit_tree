block: clarify badblocks lifetime

The badblocks list attached to a gendisk is allocated by the driver
which equates to the driver owning the lifetime of the object.  Do not
automatically free it in del_gendisk(). This is in preparation for
expanding the use of badblocks in libnvdimm drivers and introducing
devm_init_badblocks().
