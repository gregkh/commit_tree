drm/i915/gen9: Verify and enforce dc6 state writes

It has been observed that sometimes disabling the dc6 fails
and dc6 state pops back up, brief moment after disabling. This
has to be dmc save/restore timing issue or other bug in the
way dc states are handled.

Try to work around this issue as we don't have firmware fix
yet available. Verify that the value we wrote for the dmc sticks,
and also enforce it by rewriting it, if it didn't.
