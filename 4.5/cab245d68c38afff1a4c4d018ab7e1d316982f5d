sched/cputime: Correctly handle task guest time on housekeepers

When a task runs on a housekeeper (a CPU running with the periodic tick
with neighbours running tickless), it doesn't account cputime using vtime
but relies on the tick. Such a task has its vtime_snap_whence value set
to VTIME_INACTIVE.

Readers won't handle that correctly though. As long as vtime is running
on some CPU, readers incorretly assume that vtime runs on all CPUs and
always compute the tickless cputime delta, which is only junk on
housekeepers.

So lets fix this with checking that the target runs on a vtime CPU through
the appropriate state check before computing the tickless delta.
