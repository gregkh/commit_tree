fs/pnode.c: treat zero mnt_group_id-s as unequal

propagate_one(m) calculates "type" argument for copy_tree() like this:

>    if (m->mnt_group_id == last_dest->mnt_group_id) {
>        type = CL_MAKE_SHARED;
>    } else {
>        type = CL_SLAVE;
>        if (IS_MNT_SHARED(m))
>           type |= CL_MAKE_SHARED;
>   }

The "type" argument then governs clone_mnt() behavior with respect to flags
and mnt_master of new mount. When we iterate through a slave group, it is
possible that both current "m" and "last_dest" are not shared (although,
both are slaves, i.e. have non-NULL mnt_master-s). Then the comparison
above erroneously makes new mount shared and sets its mnt_master to
last_source->mnt_master. The patch fixes the problem by handling zero
mnt_group_id-s as though they are unequal.

The similar problem exists in the implementation of "else" clause above
when we have to ascend upward in the master/slave tree by calling:

>    last_source = last_source->mnt_master;
>    last_dest = last_source->mnt_parent;

proper number of times. The last step is governed by
"n->mnt_group_id != last_dest->mnt_group_id" condition that may lie if
both are zero. The patch fixes this case in the same way as the former one.

[AV: don't open-code an obvious helper...]
