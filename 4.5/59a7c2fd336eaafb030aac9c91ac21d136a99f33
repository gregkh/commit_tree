net/mlx5e: Remove wrong poll CQ optimization

With the MLX5E_CQ_HAS_CQES optimization flag, the following buggy
flow might occur:
- Suppose RX is always busy, TX has a single packet every second.
- We poll a single TX cqe and clear its flag.
- We never arm it again as RX is always busy.
- TX CQ flag is never changed, and new TX cqes are not polled.

We revert this optimization.
