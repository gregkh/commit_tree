ALSA: hda - Add fixup for Mac Mini 7,1 model

Mac Mini 7,1 model with CS4208 codec reports the headphone jack
detection wrongly in an inverted way.  Moreover, the advertised pins
for the audio input and SPDIF output have actually no jack detection.

This patch addresses these issues.  The inv_jack_detect flag is set
for fixing the headphone jack detection, and the pin configs for audio
input and SPDIF output are marked as non-detectable.
