xprtrdma: Revert commit e7104a2a9606 ('xprtrdma: Cap req_cqinit').

The root of the problem was that sends (especially unsignalled
FASTREG and LOCAL_INV Work Requests) were not properly flow-
controlled, which allowed a send queue overrun.

Now that the RPC/RDMA reply handler waits for invalidation to
complete, the send queue is properly flow-controlled. Thus this
limit is no longer necessary.
