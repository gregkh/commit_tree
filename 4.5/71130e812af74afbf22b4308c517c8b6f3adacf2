staging: wilc1000: take vif instead of drv in hostIFthread

In the first patch, we sent vif to hostIFthread. we can use vif instead of
drv in the all functions which handle the commands from cfg operations.
Change first argument host_if_drv with wilc_vif and use hif_drv of wilc_vif.
Pass vif to the functions as well.
In case of timer callback functions, set vif to the data and use vif instead
of hif_drv.
Lastly, initialize u32RcvdAssocRespInfoLen since changing hif_drv with vif
causes one uninitialied build warning.
Now we have vif that currently being used so we can use interface index of
wilc_vif to send to wilc device.
