serial: sh-sci: Avoid calculating the receive margin for HSCIF

When assuming D = 0.5 and F = 0, maximizing the receive margin M is
equivalent to maximizing the sample rate N.

Hence there's no need to calculate the receive margin, as we can obtain
the same result by iterating over all possible sample rates in reverse
order, and skipping parameter sets that don't provide a lower bit rate
error.
