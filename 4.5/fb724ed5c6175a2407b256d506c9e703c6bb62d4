wlcore: Fix regression in wlcore_set_partition()

The commit 3719c17e1816 ("wlcore/wl18xx: fw logger over sdio") introduced a
regression causing the wlcore to time out and go into recovery. Reverting the
changes regarding write of the last partition size brings the module back to
it's functional state.
