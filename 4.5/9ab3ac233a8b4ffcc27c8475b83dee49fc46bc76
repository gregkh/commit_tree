powerpc/mm/hash: Clear the invalid slot information correctly

We can get a hash pte fault with 4k base page size and find the pte
already inserted with 64K base page size. In that case we need to clear
the existing slot information from the old pte. Fix this correctly

With THP, we also clear the slot information with respect to all
the 64K hash pte mapping that 16MB page. They are all invalid
now. This make sure we don't find the slot valid when we fault with
4k base page size. Finding the slot valid should not result in any wrong
behavior because we do check again in hash page table for the validity.
But we can avoid that check completely.
