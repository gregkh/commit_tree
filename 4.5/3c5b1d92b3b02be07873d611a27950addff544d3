arm64: KVM: Configure TCR_EL2.PS at runtime

Setting TCR_EL2.PS to 40 bits is wrong on systems with less that
less than 40 bits of physical addresses. and breaks KVM on systems
where the RAM is above 40 bits.

This patch uses ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1.PARange to set TCR_EL2.PS dynamically,
just like we already do for VTCR_EL2.PS.
