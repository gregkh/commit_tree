mm, dax: check for pmd_none() after split_huge_pmd()

DAX implements split_huge_pmd() by clearing pmd.  This simple approach
reduces memory overhead, as we don't need to deposit page table on huge
page mapping to make split_huge_pmd() never-fail.  PTE table can be
allocated and populated later on page fault from backing store.

But one side effect is that have to check if pmd is pmd_none() after
split_huge_pmd().  In most places we do this already to deal with
parallel MADV_DONTNEED.

But I found two call sites which is not affected by MADV_DONTNEED (due
down_write(mmap_sem)), but need to have the check to work with DAX
properly.
