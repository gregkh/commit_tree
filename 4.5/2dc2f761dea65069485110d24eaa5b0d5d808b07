drm/i915: intel_hpd_init(): Fix suspend/resume reprobing

This fixes reprobing of display connectors on resume.  After some
talking with danvet on IRC, I learned that calling
drm_helper_hpd_irq_event() does actually trigger a full reprobe of each
connector's status. It turns out this is the actual reason reprobing on
resume hasn't been working (this was observed on a T440s):

	- We call hpd_init()
	- We check each connector for a couple of things before marking
	  connector->polled with DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_HPD, one of which is an
	  active encoder. Of course, a disconnected port won't have an
	  active encoder, so we don't add the flag to any of the
	  connectors.
	- We call drm_helper_hpd_irq_event()
	- drm_helper_irq_event() checks each connector for the
	  DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_HPD flag. The only one that has it is eDP-1,
	  so we skip reprobing each connector except that one.

In addition, we also now avoid setting connector->polled to
DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_HPD for MST connectors, since their reprobing is
handled by the mst helpers. This is probably what was originally
intended to happen here.

Changes since V1:
* Use the explanation of the issue as the commit message instead
* Change the title of the commit, since this does more then just stop a
  check for an encoder now
* Add "Fixes" line for the patch that introduced this regression
* Don't enable DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_HPD for mst connectors

Changes since V2:
* Put patch changelog above Signed-off-by
* Follow Daniel Vetter's suggestion for making the code here a bit more
  legible
