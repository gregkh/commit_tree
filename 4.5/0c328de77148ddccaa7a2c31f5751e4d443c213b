dmaengine: mdc: Correct terminate_all handling

Use of the CANCEL bit in mdc_terminate_all creates an
additional 'command done' to appear in the registers (in
addition to an interrupt).

In addition, there is a potential race between
mdc_terminate_all and the irq handler if a transfer
completes at the same time as the terminate all (presently
this results in an inappropriate warning).

To handle these issues, any outstanding 'command done'
events are cleared during mdc_terminate_all and the irq
handler takes no action when there are no new 'command done'
events.
