drm/amdgpu: fix race condition in amd_sched_entity_push_job

As soon as we leave the spinlock after the job has been added to the job
queue, we can no longer rely on the job's data to be available.

I have seen a null-pointer dereference due to sched == NULL in
amd_sched_wakeup via amd_sched_entity_push_job and
amd_sched_ib_submit_kernel_helper. Since the latter initializes
sched_job->sched with the address of the ring scheduler, which is
guaranteed to be non-NULL, this race appears to be a likely culprit.
