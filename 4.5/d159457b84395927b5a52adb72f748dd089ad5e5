xen/pciback: Save the number of MSI-X entries to be copied later.

Commit 8135cf8b092723dbfcc611fe6fdcb3a36c9951c5 (xen/pciback: Save
xen_pci_op commands before processing it) broke enabling MSI-X because
it would never copy the resulting vectors into the response.  The
number of vectors requested was being overwritten by the return value
(typically zero for success).

Save the number of vectors before processing the op, so the correct
number of vectors are copied afterwards.
