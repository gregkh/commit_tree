mm: add tracepoint for scanning pages

This patch series makes swapin readahead up to a certain number to gain
more thp performance and adds tracepoint for khugepaged_scan_pmd,
collapse_huge_page, __collapse_huge_page_isolate.

This patch series was written to deal with programs that access most,
but not all, of their memory after they get swapped out.  Currently
these programs do not get their memory collapsed into THPs after the
system swapped their memory out, while they would get THPs before
swapping happened.

This patch series was tested with a test program, it allocates 400MB of
memory, writes to it, and then sleeps.  I force the system to swap out
all.  Afterwards, the test program touches the area by writing and
leaves a piece of it without writing.  This shows how much swap in
readahead made by the patch.

Test results:

This patch (of 3):

Using static tracepoints, data of functions is recorded.  It is good to
automatize debugging without doing a lot of changes in the source code.

This patch adds tracepoint for khugepaged_scan_pmd, collapse_huge_page
and __collapse_huge_page_isolate.
