x86, mm: introduce _PAGE_DEVMAP

_PAGE_DEVMAP is a hardware-unused pte bit that will later be used in the
get_user_pages() path to identify pfns backed by the dynamic allocation
established by devm_memremap_pages.  Upon seeing that bit the gup path
will lookup and pin the allocation while the pages are in use.

Since the _PAGE_DEVMAP bit is > 32 it must be cast to u64 instead of a
pteval_t to allow pmd_flags() usage in the realmode boot code to build.
