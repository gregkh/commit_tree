ACPICA: iasl/acpiexec: Update input file handling and verification

ACPICA commit 3a6f2a516dd35a4daacbc5b5144d1db763ff2cb0

Improve and cleanup verification of ACPI tables within input files.
Share more code between the disassembler and acpiexec.

This patch only affects application debugger commands, thus it is a
no-op chage for Linux kernel.
