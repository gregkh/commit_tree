s390/cio: Consolidate inline assemblies and related data definitions

Replace the current semi-arbitrary distribution of inline assemblies:
 - Inline assemblies used by CIO go into ioasm.h
 - Data definitions used by inline assemblies go into cio.h

Beyond cleaning up the current structure this is also required for
use of tracepoints in inline assemblies introduced by a follow-on
patch.
