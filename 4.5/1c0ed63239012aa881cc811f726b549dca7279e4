perf bpf: Add BPF_PROLOGUE config options for further patches

If both LIBBPF and DWARF are detected, it is possible to create prologue
for eBPF programs to help them access kernel data. HAVE_BPF_PROLOGUE and
CONFIG_BPF_PROLOGUE are added as flags for this feature.

PERF_HAVE_ARCH_REGS_QUERY_REGISTER_OFFSET is introduced in commit
63ab024a5b6f295ca17a293ad81b7c728f49a89a ("perf tools:
regs_query_register_offset() infrastructure"), which indicates that an
architecture supports converting name of a register to its offset in
'struct pt_regs'. Without this support, BPF_PROLOGUE should be turned
off.
