kvm/x86: split ioapic-handled and EOI exit bitmaps

The function to determine if the vector is handled by ioapic used to
rely on the fact that only ioapic-handled vectors were set up to
cause vmexits when virtual apic was in use.

We're going to break this assumption when introducing Hyper-V
synthetic interrupts: they may need to cause vmexits too.

To achieve that, introduce a new bitmap dedicated specifically for
ioapic-handled vectors, and populate EOI exit bitmap from it for now.
