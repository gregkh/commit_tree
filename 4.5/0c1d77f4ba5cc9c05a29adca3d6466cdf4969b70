KVM: x86: fix conversion of addresses to linear in 32-bit protected mode

Commit e8dd2d2d641c ("Silence compiler warning in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c",
2015-09-06) broke boot of the Hurd.  The bug is that the "default:"
case actually could modify "la", but after the patch this change is
not reflected in *linear.

The bug is visible whenever a non-zero segment base causes the linear
address to wrap around the 4GB mark.
