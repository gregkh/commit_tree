mmc: dw_mmc: use resource_size_t to store physical address

The dw_mmc driver stores the physical address of the MMIO registers
in a pointer, which requires the use of type casts, and is actually
broken if anyone ever has this device on a 32-bit SoC in registers
above 4GB. Gcc warns about this possibility when the driver is built
with ARM LPAE enabled:

mmc/host/dw_mmc.c: In function 'dw_mci_edmac_start_dma':
mmc/host/dw_mmc.c:702:17: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
  cfg.dst_addr = (dma_addr_t)(host->phy_regs + fifo_offset);
                 ^
mmc/host/dw_mmc-pltfm.c: In function 'dw_mci_pltfm_register':
mmc/host/dw_mmc-pltfm.c:63:19: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
  host->phy_regs = (void *)(regs->start);

This changes the code to use resource_size_t, which gets rid of the
warning, the bug and the useless casts.
