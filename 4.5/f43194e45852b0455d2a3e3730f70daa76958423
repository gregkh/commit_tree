powerpc: Standardise on NR_syscalls rather than __NR_syscalls.

Most architectures use NR_syscalls as the #define for the number of syscalls.

We use __NR_syscalls, and then define NR_syscalls as __NR_syscalls.

__NR_syscalls is not used outside arch code, whereas NR_syscalls is. So as
NR_syscalls must be defined and __NR_syscalls does not, replace __NR_syscalls
with NR_syscalls.
