proc: add a reschedule point in proc_readfd_common()

User can pass an arbitrary large buffer to getdents().

It is typically a 32KB buffer used by libc scandir() implementation.

When scanning /proc/{pid}/fd, we can hold cpu way too long,
so add a cond_resched() to be kind with other tasks.

We've seen latencies of more than 50ms on real workloads.
