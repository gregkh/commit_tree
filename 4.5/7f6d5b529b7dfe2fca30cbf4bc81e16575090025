dax: move writeback calls into the filesystems

Previously calls to dax_writeback_mapping_range() for all DAX filesystems
(ext2, ext4 & xfs) were centralized in filemap_write_and_wait_range().

dax_writeback_mapping_range() needs a struct block_device, and it used
to get that from inode->i_sb->s_bdev.  This is correct for normal inodes
mounted on ext2, ext4 and XFS filesystems, but is incorrect for DAX raw
block devices and for XFS real-time files.

Instead, call dax_writeback_mapping_range() directly from the filesystem
->writepages function so that it can supply us with a valid block
device.  This also fixes DAX code to properly flush caches in response
to sync(2).
