security/integrity: make ima/ima_mok.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

ima/Kconfig:config IMA_MOK_KEYRING
ima/Kconfig: bool "Create IMA machine owner keys (MOK) and blacklist keyrings"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple of traces of modularity so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it really is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.
