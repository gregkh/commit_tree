ALSA: bebob: Use a signed return type for get_formation_index

The return type "unsigned int" was used by the get_formation_index function
despite of the aspect that it will eventually return a negative	error code.
So, change to signed int and get index by reference in the parameters.

Done with the help of Coccinelle.
