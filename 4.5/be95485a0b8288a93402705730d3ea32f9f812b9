ARM: 8457/1: psci-smp is built only for SMP

The PSCI SMP implementation is built only when both CONFIG_SMP and
CONFIG_ARM_PSCI are set, so a configuration that has the latter
but not the former can get a link error when it tries to call
psci_smp_available().

arch/arm/mach-tegra/built-in.o: In function `tegra114_cpuidle_init':
cpuidle-tegra114.c:(.init.text+0x52a): undefined reference to `psci_smp_available'

This corrects the #ifdef in the psci.h header file to match the
Makefile conditional we have for building that function.
