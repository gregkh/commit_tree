staging: wilc1000: linux_wlan.c: clean up comments

There are over-commenting in the linux_wlan.c file and most of them
are not helpful to explain what the code does and generate 80 ending
line over warnings. So, all of comments and commented codes are removed in
this patch. Comment will be added if necessary with the preferred Linux style.
