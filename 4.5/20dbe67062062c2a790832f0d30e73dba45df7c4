powerpc: Call restore_sprs() before _switch()

commit 152d523e6307 ("powerpc: Create context switch helpers save_sprs()
and restore_sprs()") moved the restore of SPRs after the call to _switch().

There is an issue with this approach - new tasks do not return through
_switch(), they are set up by copy_thread() to directly return through
ret_from_fork() or ret_from_kernel_thread(). This means restore_sprs() is
not getting called for new tasks.

Fix this by moving restore_sprs() before _switch().
