s390/cio: ensure consistent measurement state

Make sure that in all cases where we could not obtain measurement
characteristics the associated fields are set to invalid values.

Note: without this change the "shared" capability of a channel path
for which we could not obtain the measurement characteristics was
incorrectly displayed as 0 (not shared). We will now correctly
report "unknown" in this case.
