ALSA: pcm: Fix potential deadlock in OSS emulation

There are potential deadlocks in PCM OSS emulation code while
accessing read/write and mmap concurrently.  This comes from the
infamous mmap_sem usage in copy_from/to_user().  Namely,

   snd_pcm_oss_write() ->
     &runtime->oss.params_lock ->
        copy_to_user() ->
          &mm->mmap_sem
  mmap() ->
    &mm->mmap_sem ->
      snd_pcm_oss_mmap() ->
        &runtime->oss.params_lock

Since we can't avoid taking params_lock from mmap code path, use
trylock variant and aborts with -EAGAIN as a workaround of this AB/BA
deadlock.
