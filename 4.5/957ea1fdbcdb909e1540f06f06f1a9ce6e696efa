perf/x86: Remove warning for zero PEBS status

The recent commit:

  75f80859b130 ("perf/x86/intel/pebs: Robustify PEBS buffer drain")

causes lots of warnings on different CPUs before Skylake
when running PEBS intensive workloads.

They can have a zero status field in the PEBS record when
PEBS is racing with clearing of GLOBAl_STATUS.

This also can cause hangs (it seems there are still
problems with printk in NMI).

Disable the warning, but still ignore the record.
