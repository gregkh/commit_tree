component: move check for unbound master into try_to_bring_up_masters()

Clean up the code a little; we don't need to check that the master is
unbound for every invocation of try_to_bring_up_master(), so let's move
it to where it's really needed - try_to_bring_up_masters(), where we may
encounter already bound masters.
