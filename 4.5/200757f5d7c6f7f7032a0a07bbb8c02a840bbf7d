drm/i915: Disable primary plane if we fail to reconstruct BIOS fb (v2)

If we fail to reconstruct the BIOS fb (e.g., because the FB is too
large), we'll be left with plane state that indicates the primary plane
is visible yet has a NULL fb.  This mismatch causes problems later on
(e.g., for the watermark code).  Since we've failed to reconstruct the
BIOS FB, the best solution is to just disable the primary plane and
pretend the BIOS never had it enabled.

v2: Add intel_pre_disable_primary() call (Maarten)
