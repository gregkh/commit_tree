MAINTAINERS: drop OMAP USB and MUSB maintainership

Now that I have switched to another company, I won't
be able to help by maintaining OMAP USB Support and/or
the MUSB driver.

OMAP USB Support is left Orphaned. MUSB's new
maintainer will be Bin Liu from Texas Instruments
who has accepted to take over starting with v4.6.
