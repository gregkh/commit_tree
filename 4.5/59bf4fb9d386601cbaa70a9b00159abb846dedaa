dax: Split pmd map when fallback on COW

An infinite loop of PMD faults was observed when attempted to mlock() a
private read-only PMD mmap'd range of a DAX file.

__dax_pmd_fault() simply returns with VM_FAULT_FALLBACK when falling
back to PTE on COW.  However, __handle_mm_fault() returns without
falling back to handle_pte_fault() because a PMD map is present in this
case.

Change __dax_pmd_fault() to split the PMD map, if present, before
returning with VM_FAULT_FALLBACK.
