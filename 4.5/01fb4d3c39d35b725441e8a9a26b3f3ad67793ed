PM / OPP: Parse 'opp-<prop>-<name>' bindings

OPP bindings (for few properties) allow a platform to choose a
value/range among a set of available options. The options are present as
opp-<prop>-<name>, where the platform needs to supply the <name> string.

The OPP properties which allow such an option are: opp-microvolt and
opp-microamp.

Add support to the OPP-core to parse these bindings, by introducing
dev_pm_opp_{set|put}_prop_name() APIs.
