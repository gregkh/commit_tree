ACPI / SBS: fix inconsistent indenting inside if statement

The indenting in acpi_battery_set_alarm is inconsistent and has been
so since 2007; commit 94f6c0860139da9219255b8ff45ad42117dda859
("ACPI: SBS: Add support for power_supply class (and sysfs)"). Minor
fix for this, no code functionality change.
