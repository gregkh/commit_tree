drm/vc4: copy_to_user() returns the number of bytes remaining

The copy_to/from_user() functions return the number of bytes remaining
to be copied.  We want to return error codes here.

Also it's a bad idea to print an error message if a copy from user fails
because users can use that to spam /var/log/messages which is annoying
so I removed those.
