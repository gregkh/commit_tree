[media] media: add a common struct to be embed on media graph objects

Due to the MC API proposed changes, we'll need to have an unique
object ID for all graph objects, and have some shared fields
that will be common on all media graph objects.

Right now, the only common object is the object ID, but other
fields will be added later on.
