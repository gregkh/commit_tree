drbd: fix spurious alert level printk

When accessing out meta data area on disk, we double check the
plausibility of the requested sector offsets, and are very noisy about
it if they look suspicious.

During initial read of our "superblock", for "external" meta data,
this triggered because the range estimate returned by
drbd_md_last_sector() was still wrong.
