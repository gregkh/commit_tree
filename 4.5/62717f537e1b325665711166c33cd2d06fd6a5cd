ncr5380: Implement new eh_bus_reset_handler

NCR5380.c lacks a sane eh_bus_reset_handler. The atari_NCR5380.c code is
much better but it should not throw out the issue queue (that would be
a host reset) and it neglects to set the result code for commands that it
throws out. Fix these bugs and keep the two core drivers in sync.
