Documentation: translations: update linux cross reference link

The old link to source code cross reference does not work now. Though
the link has updated by commit 1d12554f0abbc7d17dce8d1b7b25f4e27555e6d7
("Documentation: HOWTO: update code cross reference link"), there are
few obsolete links yet. This commit update them.
