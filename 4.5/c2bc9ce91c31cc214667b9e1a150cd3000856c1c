ixgbe: Reorder search to work from the top down instead of bottom up

This patch is meant to reduce the complexity of the search function used
for finding a VLVF entry associated with a given VLAN ID.  The previous
code was searching from bottom to top.  I reordered it to search from top
to bottom.  In addition I pulled an AND statement out of the loop and
instead replaced it with an OR statement outside the loop.  This should
help to reduce the overall size and complexity of the function.

There was also some formatting I cleaned up in regards to whitespace and
such.
