fs/proc/task_mmu.c: add workaround for old compilers

For THP=n, HPAGE_PMD_NR in smaps_account() expands to BUILD_BUG().
That's fine since this codepath is eliminated by modern compilers.

But older compilers have not that efficient dead code elimination.  It
causes problem at least with gcc 4.1.2 on m68k:

   fs/built-in.o: In function `smaps_account':
   task_mmu.c:(.text+0x4f8fa): undefined reference to `__compiletime_assert_471'

Let's replace HPAGE_PMD_NR with 1 << compound_order(page).
