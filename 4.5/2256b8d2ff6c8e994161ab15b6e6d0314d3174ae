ASoC: rt5659: avoid unused variable warning for rt5659_acpi_match

The newly added rt5659 codec driver unconditionally defines an
ACPI device match table but then uses ACPI_PTR() to remove the
only reference to it, so we get a harmless build warning:

sound/soc/codecs/rt5659.c:4200:30: warning: 'rt5659_acpi_match' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
 static struct acpi_device_id rt5659_acpi_match[] = {

This changes both the OF match table and the ACPI match table
to follow the same style, using ACPI_PTR/of_match_ptr to
make the reference conditional, and using an #ifdef to hide
the table. This also adds the missing MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE for
the OF case and adapts the formatting to the same style.
