xen-netback: free queues after freeing the net device

If a queue still has a NAPI instance added to the net device, freeing
the queues early results in a use-after-free.

The shouldn't ever happen because we disconnect and tear down all queues
before freeing the net device, but doing this makes it obviously safe.
