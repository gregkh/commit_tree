KVM: s390: fix mismatch between user and in-kernel guest limit

While the userspace interface requests the maximum size the gmap code
expects to get a maximum address.

This error resulted in bigger page tables than necessary for some guest
sizes, e.g. a 2GB guest used 3 levels instead of 2.

At the same time we introduce KVM_S390_NO_MEM_LIMIT, which allows in a
bright future that a guest spans the complete 64 bit address space.

We also switch to TASK_MAX_SIZE for the initial memory size, this is a
cosmetic change as the previous size also resulted in a 4 level pagetable
creation.
