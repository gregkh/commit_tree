usb: xhci: handle both SSIC ports in PME stuck quirk

Commit abce329c27b3 ("xhci: Workaround to get D3 working in Intel xHCI")
adds a workaround for a limitation of PME storm caused by SSIC port in
some Intel SoCs. This commit only handled one SSIC port, while there
are actually two SSIC ports in the chips. This patch handles both SSIC
ports. Without this fix, users still see PME storm.
