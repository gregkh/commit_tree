udp6: fix UDP/IPv6 encap resubmit path

IPv4 interprets a negative return value from a protocol handler as a
request to redispatch to a new protocol.  In contrast, IPv6 interprets a
negative value as an error, and interprets a positive value as a request
for redispatch.

UDP for IPv6 was unaware of this difference.  Change __udp6_lib_rcv() to
return a positive value for redispatch.  Note that the socket's
encap_rcv hook still needs to return a negative value to request
dispatch, and in the case of IPv6 packets, adjust IP6CB(skb)->nhoff to
identify the byte containing the next protocol.
