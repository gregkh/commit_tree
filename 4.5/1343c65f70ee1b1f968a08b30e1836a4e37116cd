fm10k: always check init_hw for errors

A recent change modified init_hw in some flows the function may fail on
VF devices. For example, if a VF doesn't yet own its own queues.
However, many callers of init_hw didn't bother to check the error code.
Other callers checked but only displayed diagnostic messages without
actually handling the consequences.

Fix this by (a) always returning and preventing the netdevice from going
up, and (b) printing the diagnostic in every flow for consistency. This
should resolve an issue where VF drivers would attempt to come up
before the PF has finished assigning queues.

In addition, change the dmesg output to explicitly show the actual
function that failed, instead of combining reset_hw and init_hw into a
single check, to help for future debugging.
