ARM: versatile: merge mach code into a single file

With DT-only support now in place and most of the legacy code removed,
the separation of core.c and versatile_dt.c makes little sense. The
headers in mach include directory also have to move for multi-platform
support, but with a single .c file the remaining definitions needed can
also be moved into the versatile_dt.c.

In the move, the system registers and IB2 registers are converted to
run-time mappings and all register accesses converted to use
readl/writel.
