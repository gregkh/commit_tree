drm/i915: take a power domain reference while checking the HDMI live status

There are platforms that don't need the full GMBUS power domain (BXT)
while others do (PCH, VLV/CHV). For optimizing this we would need to add
a new power domain, but it's not clear how much we would benefit given
the short time we hold the reference. So for now let's keep things
simple.

v2:
- fix commit message, PCH won't take any redundant power resource after
this change (Ville)
