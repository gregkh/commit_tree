do_last(): don't let a bogus return value from ->open() et.al. to confuse us

... into returning a positive to path_openat(), which would interpret that
as "symlink had been encountered" and proceed to corrupt memory, etc.
It can only happen due to a bug in some ->open() instance or in some LSM
hook, etc., so we report any such event *and* make sure it doesn't trick
us into further unpleasantness.
