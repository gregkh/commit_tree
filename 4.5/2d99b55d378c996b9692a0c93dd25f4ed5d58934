bio: return EINTR if copying to user space got interrupted

Commit 35dc248383bbab0a7203fca4d722875bc81ef091 introduced a check for
current->mm to see if we have a user space context and only copies data
if we do. Now if an IO gets interrupted by a signal data isn't copied
into user space any more (as we don't have a user space context) but
user space isn't notified about it.

This patch modifies the behaviour to return -EINTR from bio_uncopy_user()
to notify userland that a signal has interrupted the syscall, otherwise
it could lead to a situation where the caller may get a buffer with
no data returned.

This can be reproduced by issuing SG_IO ioctl()s in one thread while
constantly sending signals to it.
