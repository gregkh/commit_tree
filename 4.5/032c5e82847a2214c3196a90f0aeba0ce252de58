Driver for IBM System i/p VNIC protocol

This is a new device driver for a high performance SR-IOV assisted virtual
network for IBM System p and IBM System i systems.  The SR-IOV VF will be
attached to the VIOS partition and mapped to the Linux client via the
hypervisor's VNIC protocol that this driver implements.

This driver is able to perform basic tx and rx, new features
and improvements will be added as they are being developed and tested.
