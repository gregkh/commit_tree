ARM: factor out allocation routine from __create_mapping()

To allow __create_mapping() to be used for populating UEFI Runtime
Services page tables, factor out the allocation routine 'early_alloc'
and pass it down as a function pointer into alloc_init_[pud|pmd|pte].
This way, new users of __create_mapping() can supply another allocation
function.
