drm/i915: refactor FBC deactivation at init

Make sure we deactivate FBC at intel_fbc_init(), so we can remove the
call from intel_display.c. Currently we only have the "enabled"
software state, but later we'll have both "enabled" and "active", and
we'll add assertions to them, so just calling intel_fbc_disable() from
intel_modeset_init() won't work. It's better to make sure
intel_fbc_init() already puts the hardware in the expected state, so
we can put nice assertions in the other functions.

v2: Keep/improve the comment (Chris).
v3: Improve the commit message a little bit.
