vmstat: make vmstat_updater deferrable again and shut down on idle

Currently the vmstat updater is not deferrable as a result of commit
ba4877b9ca51 ("vmstat: do not use deferrable delayed work for
vmstat_update").  This in turn can cause multiple interruptions of the
applications because the vmstat updater may run at

Make vmstate_update deferrable again and provide a function that folds
the differentials when the processor is going to idle mode thus
addressing the issue of the above commit in a clean way.

Note that the shepherd thread will continue scanning the differentials
from another processor and will reenable the vmstat workers if it
detects any changes.
