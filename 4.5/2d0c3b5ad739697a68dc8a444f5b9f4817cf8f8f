Drivers: hv: utils: Invoke the poll function after handshake

When the handshake with daemon is complete, we should poll the channel since
during the handshake, we will not be processing any messages. This is a
potential bug if the host is waiting for a response from the guest.
I would like to thank Dexuan for pointing this out.
