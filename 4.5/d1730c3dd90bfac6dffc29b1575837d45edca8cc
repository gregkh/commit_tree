ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix DSP pipe underrun/overrun issue

While rigourous testing of SKL drivers, we noticed underuns and
overuns and on debug realized that we need to change driver
handling of FE pipe startup and shutdown

We need to start DMA and then run pipe together and not split
these up. Similarly while stopping we should stop pipe and then
DMA in a sequence.
