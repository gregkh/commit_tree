powerpc: Don't disable kernel FP/VMX/VSX MSR bits on context switch

Writing the MSR is slow, so we want to avoid it whenever possible.

A subsequent patch will add a debug option that strictly manages the
FP/VMX/VSX unavailable bits. For now just remove it, matching what
we do in other areas of the kernel (eg enable_kernel_altivec()).

A context switch microbenchmark using yield():

./context_switch2 --test=yield --fp 0 0

shows an improvement of almost 3% on POWER8.
