mm: fix mixed zone detection in devm_memremap_pages

The check for whether we overlap "System RAM" needs to be done at
section granularity.  For example a system with the following mapping:

    100000000-37bffffff : System RAM
    37c000000-837ffffff : Persistent Memory

...is unable to use devm_memremap_pages() as it would result in two
zones colliding within a given section.
