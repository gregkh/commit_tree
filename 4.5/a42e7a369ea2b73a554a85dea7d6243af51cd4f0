i40e: Fix memory leaks, sideband filter programming

This patch fixes the memory leak which would be seen otherwise when user
programs flow-director filter using ethtool (sideband filter programming).

When ethtool is used to program flow directory filter, 'raw_buf' gets
allocated and it is supposed to be freed as part of queue cleanup. But
check of 'tx_buffer->skb' was preventing it from being freed.
