perf top: Do show usage message when failing to create cpu/thread maps

This is necessary to get rid of the browser dependency from
usage_with_options() and its friends.  Because we validate the targets
which are used to create the cpu/thread maps and inform the user about
any override performed via the chosen UI, we don't need to call the
usage routine for that.
