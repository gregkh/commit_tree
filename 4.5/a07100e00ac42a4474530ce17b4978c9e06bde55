qla2xxx: Fix TMR ABORT interaction issue between qla2xxx and TCM

During lun reset, TMR thread from TCM would issue abort
to qla driver.  At abort time, each command is in different
state.  Depending on the state, qla will use the TMR thread
to trigger a command free(cmd_kref--) if command is not
down at firmware.
