ARM: orion5x: clean up mach/*.h headers

This is a simple move of all header files that are no longer
included by anything else from the include/mach directory
to the platform directory itself as preparation for
multiplatform support.

The mach/uncompress.h headers are left in place for now,
and are mildly modified to be independent of the other
headers. They will be removed entirely when ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
gets enabled and they become obsolete.

Rather than updating the path names inside of the comments
of each header, I delete those comments to avoid having to
update them again, should they get moved or copied another
time.
