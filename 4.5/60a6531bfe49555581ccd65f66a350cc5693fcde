team: Replace rcu_read_lock with a mutex in team_vlan_rx_kill_vid

We can't be within an RCU read-side critical section when deleting
VLANs, as underlying drivers might sleep during the hardware operation.
Therefore, replace the RCU critical section with a mutex. This is
consistent with team_vlan_rx_add_vid.
