batman-adv: detect local excess vlans in TT request

If the local representation of the global TT table of one originator has
more VLAN entries than the respective TT update, there is some
inconsistency present. By detecting and reporting this inconsistency,
the global table gets updated and the excess VLAN will get removed in
the process.
