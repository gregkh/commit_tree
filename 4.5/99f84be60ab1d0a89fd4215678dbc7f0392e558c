sh_eth: Remove obsolete r7s72100-ether platform_device_id entry

Since commit 05104c266ae9a167 ("ARM: shmobile: r7s72100: genmai: Remove
legacy board file"), r7s72100 is only supported in generic DT-only ARM
multi-platform builds.  The driver doesn't need to match platform
devices by name anymore, hence remove the corresponding
platform_device_id entry.

Protect r7s72100_data by #ifdef CONFIG_OF as it's now referenced on DT
platforms only. Move it to a more logical position, in front of the
r8a777x support, so we can have a single #ifdef covering all r7s* and
r8a* support soon. This requires moving a helper function, too.
