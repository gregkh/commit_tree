mtd: nand: jz4780: driver for NAND devices on JZ4780 SoCs

Add a driver for NAND devices connected to the NEMC on JZ4780 SoCs, as
well as the hardware BCH controller. DMA is not currently implemented.

While older 47xx SoCs also have a BCH controller, they are incompatible
with the one in the 4780 due to differing register/bit positions, which
would make implementing a common driver for them quite messy.
