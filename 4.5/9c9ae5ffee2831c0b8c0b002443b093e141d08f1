clocksource/drivers/arm_global_timer: Fix suspend resume

Now the System stall is observed on TI AM437x based board (am437x-gp-evm)
during resuming from System suspend when ARM Global timer is selected as
clocksource device (CPUIdle not enabled) - SysRq are working, but nothing
else.

The reason of stall is that ARM Global timer loses its contexts during
System suspend:
   GT_CONTROL.TIMER_ENABLE = 0 (unbanked)
   GT_COUNTERx = 0

Hence, update ARM Global timer driver to reflect above behaviour
- re-enable ARM Global timer on resume (GT_CONTROL.TIMER_ENABLE = 1)
  if not enabled.
