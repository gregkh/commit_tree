ARM: integrator: use explicit core module options

For consistency with the other platforms, this remove the CPU
selection logic in mm/Kconfig that was only used by integrator,
and adds specific options for each available core tile and core
module, which in turn select the correct CPUs.

This is consistent with the new way that we do it for realview
and all other platforms.
