KVM: s390: Introduce new structures

This patch adds new structures and updates some existing ones to
provide the base for Extended SCA functionality.

The old sca_* structures were renamed to bsca_* to keep things uniform.

The access to fields of SIGP controls were turned into bitfields instead
of hardcoded bitmasks.
