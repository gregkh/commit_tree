arm/arm64: KVM: Feed initialized memory to MMIO accesses

On an MMIO access, we always copy the on-stack buffer info
the shared "run" structure, even if this is a read access.
This ends up leaking up to 8 bytes of uninitialized memory
into userspace, depending on the size of the access.

An obvious fix for this one is to only perform the copy if
this is an actual write.
