staging/wilc1000: avoid static definitions in header

The wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.h header defines the ieee80211_txrx_stypes
and cipher_suites variables that are only used in wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c
and should not be shared in a header file.

This moves over all that data into the .c file, and also moves all
the macro definitions from the file that are also not needed here.
