KVM: x86: MMU: Consolidate BUG_ON checks for reverse-mapped sptes

At some call sites of rmap_get_first() and rmap_get_next(), BUG_ON is
placed right after the call to detect unrelated sptes which must not be
found in the reverse-mapping list.

Move this check in rmap_get_first/next() so that all call sites, not
just the users of the for_each_rmap_spte() macro, will be checked the
same way.

One thing to keep in mind is that kvm_mmu_unlink_parents() also uses
rmap_get_first() to handle parent sptes.  The change will not break it
because parent sptes are present, at least until drop_parent_pte()
actually unlinks them, and not mmio-sptes.
