ARM: meson: serial: release region on port release

The meson_uart_release_port() unmaps the register area but does not release
it. The meson_uart_request_port() calls devm_request_mem_region so the
release should call devm_release_mem_region() for that area so that anyt
subsequent use of these calls will work.

This fixes an issue where the addition of reset code before registering
the uart stops the console from working.
