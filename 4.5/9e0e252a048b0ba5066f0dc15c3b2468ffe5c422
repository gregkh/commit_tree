badblocks: Add core badblock management code

Take the core badblocks implementation from md, and make it generally
available. This follows the same style as kernel implementations of
linked lists, rb-trees etc, where you can have a structure that can be
embedded anywhere, and accessor functions to manipulate the data.

The only changes in this copy of the code are ones to generalize
function/variable names from md-specific ones. Also add init and free
functions.
