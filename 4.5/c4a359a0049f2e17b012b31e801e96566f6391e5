ALSA: usb-audio: Fix mixer ctl regression of Native Instrument devices

The commit [da6d276957ea: ALSA: usb-audio: Add resume support for
Native Instruments controls] brought a regression where the Native
Instrument audio devices don't get the correct value at update due to
the missing shift at writing.  This patch addresses it.
