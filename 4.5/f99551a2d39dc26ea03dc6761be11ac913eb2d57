rtlwifi: rtl_pci: Fix kernel panic

In commit 38506ecefab9 (rtlwifi: rtl_pci: Start modification for new
drivers), a bug was introduced that causes a NULL pointer dereference.
As this bug only affects the infrequently used RTL8192EE and only under
low-memory conditions, it has taken a long time for the bug to show up.

The bug was reported on the linux-wireless mailing list and also at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-release-upgrader/ as
bug #1527603 (kernel crashes due to rtl8192ee driver on ubuntu 15.10).
