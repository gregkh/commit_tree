drm/i915: Don't register the CRT connector when it's fused off on LPT-H

LPT-H has a strap bit for fused off CRT block. Check it to see if
we should register the CRT connector or not. Supposedly this also
forces the ADAP enable bit to 0, so the detection we added in
commit 6c03a6bd0dd8 ("drm/i915: Don't register CRT connector when it's fused off")
should already catch it, but checking the fuse bit should at least
do no harm.

v2: Use HAS_PCH_LPT_H() (Paulo)
