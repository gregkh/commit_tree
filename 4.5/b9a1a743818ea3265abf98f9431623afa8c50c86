ASoC: samsung: pass DMA channels as pointers

ARM64 allmodconfig produces a bunch of warnings when building the
samsung ASoC code:

sound/soc/samsung/dmaengine.c: In function 'samsung_asoc_init_dma_data':
sound/soc/samsung/dmaengine.c:53:32: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
   playback_data->filter_data = (void *)playback->channel;
sound/soc/samsung/dmaengine.c:60:31: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
   capture_data->filter_data = (void *)capture->channel;

We could easily shut up the warning by adding an intermediate cast,
but there is a bigger underlying problem: The use of IORESOURCE_DMA
to pass data from platform code to device drivers is dubious to start
with, as what we really want is a pointer that can be passed into
a filter function.

Note that on s3c64xx, the pl08x DMA data is already a pointer, but
gets cast to resource_size_t so we can pass it as a resource, and it
then gets converted back to a pointer. In contrast, the data we pass
for s3c24xx is an index into a device specific table, and we artificially
convert that into a pointer for the filter function.
