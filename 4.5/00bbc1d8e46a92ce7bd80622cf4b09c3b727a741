driver core: platform: Add support for built-in device properties

Make it possible to pass built-in device properties to platform device
drivers. This is useful if the system does not have any firmware interface
like Device Tree or ACPI which provides these.

Properties associated with the platform device will be automatically
released when the corresponding device is removed.
