staging/wilc1000: remove WILC_SDIO/WILC_SPI macros

The last remaining user of WILC_SDIO macro checks for the correct
time to wait in an interrupt for the PLL to settle. We can
replace this with a runtime check and remove both WILC_SDIO and
WILC_SPI, as we no longer need conditional compilation based on
the hardware type.
