of/irq: optimize device node matching loop in of_irq_init()

Currently, of_irq_init() iterates over interrupt controller nodes
with for_each_matching_node(), and then gets each init function with
of_match_node() later.

This routine can be optimized with for_each_matching_node_and_match().
It allows to get the interrupt controller node and its init function
at the same time, saving __of_match_node() callings.
