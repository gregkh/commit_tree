staging: lustre: remove o_ prefix from function pointers

We mostly refer to these function pointers using macros that use macro
magic to add the "o_" prefix to the front.  It means that you can't use
cscope to find the caller.  Heck, you can't even grep for it.

I looked at preserving the "o_" prefix by removing the macro magic and
adding "o_" to all the call sites but then I realized that, really, the
prefix doesn't add any value.  Let's just remove it.
