mm, dax, gpu: convert vm_insert_mixed to pfn_t

Convert the raw unsigned long 'pfn' argument to pfn_t for the purpose of
evaluating the PFN_MAP and PFN_DEV flags.  When both are set it triggers
_PAGE_DEVMAP to be set in the resulting pte.

There are no functional changes to the gpu drivers as a result of this
conversion.
