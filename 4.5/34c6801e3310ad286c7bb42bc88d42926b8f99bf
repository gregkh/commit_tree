Drivers: hv: vmbus: fix rescind-offer handling for device without a driver

In the path vmbus_onoffer_rescind() -> vmbus_device_unregister()  ->
device_unregister() -> ... -> __device_release_driver(), we can see for a
device without a driver loaded: dev->driver is NULL, so
dev->bus->remove(dev), namely vmbus_remove(), isn't invoked.

As a result, vmbus_remove() -> hv_process_channel_removal() isn't invoked
and some cleanups(like sending a CHANNELMSG_RELID_RELEASED message to the
host) aren't done.

We can demo the issue this way:
1. rmmod hv_utils;
2. disable the Heartbeat Integration Service in Hyper-V Manager and lsvmbus
shows the device disappears.
3. re-enable the Heartbeat in Hyper-V Manager and modprobe hv_utils, but
lsvmbus shows the device can't appear again.
This is because, the host thinks the VM hasn't released the relid, so can't
re-offer the device to the VM.

We can fix the issue by moving hv_process_channel_removal()
from vmbus_close_internal() to vmbus_device_release(), since the latter is
always invoked on device_unregister(), whether or not the dev has a driver
loaded.
