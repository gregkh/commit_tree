s390/mm: four page table levels vs. fork

The fork of a process with four page table levels is broken since
git commit 6252d702c5311ce9 "[S390] dynamic page tables."

All new mm contexts are created with three page table levels and
an asce limit of 4TB. If the parent has four levels dup_mmap will
add vmas to the new context which are outside of the asce limit.
The subsequent call to copy_page_range will walk the three level
page table structure of the new process with non-zero pgd and pud
indexes. This leads to memory clobbers as the pgd_index *and* the
pud_index is added to the mm->pgd pointer without a pgd_deref
in between.

The init_new_context() function is selecting the number of page
table levels for a new context. The function is used by mm_init()
which in turn is called by dup_mm() and mm_alloc(). These two are
used by fork() and exec(). The init_new_context() function can
distinguish the two cases by looking at mm->context.asce_limit,
for fork() the mm struct has been copied and the number of page
table levels may not change. For exec() the mm_alloc() function
set the new mm structure to zero, in this case a three-level page
table is created as the temporary stack space is located at
STACK_TOP_MAX = 4TB.

This fixes CVE-2016-2143.
