batman-adv: Only put orig_node_vlan list reference when removed

The batadv_orig_node_vlan reference counter in batadv_tt_global_size_mod
can only be reduced when the list entry was actually removed. Otherwise the
reference counter may reach zero when batadv_tt_global_size_mod is called
from two different contexts for the same orig_node_vlan but only one
context is actually removing the entry from the list.

The release function for this orig_node_vlan is not called inside the
vlan_list_lock spinlock protected region because the function
batadv_tt_global_size_mod still holds a orig_node_vlan reference for the
object pointer on the stack. Thus the actual release function (when
required) will be called only at the end of the function.
