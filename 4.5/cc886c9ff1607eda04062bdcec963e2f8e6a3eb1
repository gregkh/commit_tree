svcrdma: Improve allocation of struct svc_rdma_op_ctxt

When the maximum payload size of NFS READ and WRITE was increased
by commit cc9a903d915c ("svcrdma: Change maximum server payload back
to RPCSVC_MAXPAYLOAD"), the size of struct svc_rdma_op_ctxt
increased to over 6KB (on x86_64). That makes allocating one of
these from a kmem_cache more likely to fail in situations when
system memory is exhausted.

Since I'm about to add a caller where this allocation must always
work _and_ it cannot sleep, pre-allocate ctxts for each connection.

Another motivation for this change is that NFSv4.x servers are
required by specification not to drop NFS requests. Pre-allocating
memory resources reduces the likelihood of a drop.
