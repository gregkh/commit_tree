IB/mlx5: Add hca_core_clock_offset to udata in init_ucontext

Pass hca_core_clock_offset to user-space is mandatory in order to
let the user-space read the free-running clock register from the
right offset in the memory mapped page.
Passing this value is done by changing the vendor's command
and response of init_ucontext to be in extensible form.
