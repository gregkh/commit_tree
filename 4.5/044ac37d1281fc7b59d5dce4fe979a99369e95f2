arm64: KVM: Add compatibility aliases

So far, we've implemented the new world switch with a completely
different namespace, so that we could have both implementation
compiled in.

Let's take things one step further by adding weak aliases that
have the same names as the original implementation. The weak
attributes allows the new implementation to be overriden by the
old one, and everything still work.

At a later point, we'll be able to simply drop the old code, and
everything will hopefully keep working, thanks to the aliases we
have just added. This also saves us repainting all the callers.
