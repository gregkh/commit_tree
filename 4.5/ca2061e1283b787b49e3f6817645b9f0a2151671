i2c: piix4: Convert piix4_main_adapter to array

The SB800 chipset supports a multiplexed main SMBus controller with
four ports. Therefore the static variable piix4_main_adapter is
converted into a piix4_main_adapters array that can hold one
i2c_adapter for each multiplexed port.

The auxiliary adapter remains unchanged since it represents the second
(not multiplexed) SMBus controller on the SB800 chipset.
