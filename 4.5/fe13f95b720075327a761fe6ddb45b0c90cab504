arm64: pass a task parameter to unwind_frame()

Function graph tracer modifies a return address (LR) in a stack frame
to hook a function's return. This will result in many useless entries
(return_to_handler) showing up in a call stack list.
We will fix this problem in a later patch ("arm64: ftrace: fix a stack
tracer's output under function graph tracer"). But since real return
addresses are saved in ret_stack[] array in struct task_struct,
unwind functions need to be notified of, in addition to a stack pointer
address, which task is being traced in order to find out real return
addresses.

This patch extends unwind functions' interfaces by adding an extra
argument of a pointer to task_struct.
