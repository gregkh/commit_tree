arm64: account for sparsemem section alignment when choosing vmemmap offset

Commit dfd55ad85e4a ("arm64: vmemmap: use virtual projection of linear
region") fixed an issue where the struct page array would overflow into the
adjacent virtual memory region if system RAM was placed so high up in
physical memory that its addresses were not representable in the build time
configured virtual address size.

However, the fix failed to take into account that the vmemmap region needs
to be relatively aligned with respect to the sparsemem section size, so that
a sequence of page structs corresponding with a sparsemem section in the
linear region appears naturally aligned in the vmemmap region.

So round up vmemmap to sparsemem section size. Since this essentially moves
the projection of the linear region up in memory, also revert the reduction
of the size of the vmemmap region.
