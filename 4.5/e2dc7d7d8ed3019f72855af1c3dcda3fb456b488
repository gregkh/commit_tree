ALSA: hda - Move audio component accesses to hdac_i915.c

A couple of i915_audio_component ops have been added and accessed
directly from patch_hdmi.c.  Ideally all these should be factored out
into hdac_i915.c.

This patch does it, adds two new helper functions for setting N/CTS
and fetching ELD bytes.  One bonus is that the hackish widget vs port
mapping is also moved to hdac_i915.c, so that it can be fixed /
enhanced more cleanly.
