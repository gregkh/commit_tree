i2c: imx: init bus recovery info before adding i2c adapter

During driver probe, i2c_imx_init_recovery_info() must come before
i2c_add_numbered_adapter(), because the get/set_scl() functions
are assigned in i2c_register_adapter() under the conditon that bus
recover_info are initialized. Otherwise, get/set_scl() function
pointers never get assigned.

In such case, when i2c_generic_gpio_recovery() is used for bus recovery,
there will be kernel crash because bri->set_scl is NULL.

The solution to this bug is moving i2c_imx_init_recovery_info() before
i2c_register_adapter().
