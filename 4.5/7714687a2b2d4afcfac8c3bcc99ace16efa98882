thinkpad_acpi: Use acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses()

Use the new acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses function to check
if we should report brightness key-presses.

This makes the code both easier to read and makes it properly report
key-presses when acpi-video is not reporting them for reasons other
then the backlight type being vendor.
