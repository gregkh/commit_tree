mtd: drop unnecessary partition parser data

We should assign the MTD dev.of_node instead of the parser data field.
This gets us the equivalent partition parser behavior with fewer special
fields and parameter passing.

Also convert several of these to mtd_device_register(), since we don't
need the 2nd and 3rd parameters anymore.
