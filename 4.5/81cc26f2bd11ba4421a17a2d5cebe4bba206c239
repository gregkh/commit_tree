printk: only unregister boot consoles when necessary

Boot consoles are typically replaced by proper consoles during the boot
process.  This can be problematic if the boot console data is part of
the init section that is reclaimed late during boot.  If the proper
console does not register before this point in time, the boot console
will need to be removed (so that the freed memory is not accessed),
leaving the system without output for some time.

There are various reasons why the proper console may not register early
enough, such as deferred probe or the driver being a loadable module.
If that happens, there is some amount of time where no console messages
are visible to the user, which in turn can mean that they won't see
crashes or other potentially useful information.

To avoid this situation, only remove the boot console when it resides in
the init section.  Code exists to replace the boot console by the proper
console when it is registered, keeping a seamless transition between the
boot and proper consoles.
