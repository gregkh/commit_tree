[media] media-entitiy: add a function to create multiple links

Sometimes, it is desired to create 1:n and n:1 or even
n:n links between different entities with the same
function.

This is actually needed to support DVB devices that
have multiple frontends. While we could do a function
like that internally at the DVB core, such function is
generic enough to be at media-entity, and it could be
useful on some other places.

So, add such function.
