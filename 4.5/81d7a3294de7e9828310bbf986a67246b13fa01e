powerpc: Make {cmp}xchg* and their atomic_ versions fully ordered

According to memory-barriers.txt, xchg*, cmpxchg* and their atomic_
versions all need to be fully ordered, however they are now just
RELEASE+ACQUIRE, which are not fully ordered.

So also replace PPC_RELEASE_BARRIER and PPC_ACQUIRE_BARRIER with
PPC_ATOMIC_ENTRY_BARRIER and PPC_ATOMIC_EXIT_BARRIER in
__{cmp,}xchg_{u32,u64} respectively to guarantee fully ordered semantics
of atomic{,64}_{cmp,}xchg() and {cmp,}xchg(), as a complement of commit
b97021f85517 ("powerpc: Fix atomic_xxx_return barrier semantics")

This patch depends on patch "powerpc: Make value-returning atomics fully
ordered" for PPC_ATOMIC_ENTRY_BARRIER definition.
