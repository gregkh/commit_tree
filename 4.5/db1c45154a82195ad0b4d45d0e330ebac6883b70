s390/spinlock: avoid diagnose loop

The spinlock implementation calls the diagnose 0x9c / 0x44 immediately
if the SIGP sense running reported the target CPU as not running.

The diagnose 0x9c is a hint to the hypervisor to schedule the target
CPU in preference to the source CPU that issued the diagnose. It can
happen that on return from the diagnose the target CPU has not been
scheduled yet, e.g. if the target logical CPU is on another physical
CPU and the hypervisor did not want to migrate the logical CPU.

Avoid the immediate repeat of the diagnose instruction, instead do
the retry loop before the next invocation of diagnose 0x9c.
