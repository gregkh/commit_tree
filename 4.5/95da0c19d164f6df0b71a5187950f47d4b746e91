dmaengine: at_xdmac: fix spurious flag status for mem2mem transfers

When setting the channel configuration register, the perid field is not
set to 0 since it is useless for mem2mem transfers. Unfortunately, a
device has 0 as perid. It could cause spurious flags status because
the controller could mix some events from the two channels.
For that reason, use the highest perid value for mem2mem transfers since it
doesn't match the perid of other devices.
