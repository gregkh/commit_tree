net: tcp_memcontrol: remove dead per-memcg count of allocated sockets

The number of allocated sockets is used for calculations in the soft
limit phase, where packets are accepted but the socket is under memory
pressure.
 Since there is no soft limit phase in tcp_memcontrol, and memory
pressure is only entered when packets are already dropped, this is
actually dead code.  Remove it.

As this is the last user of parent_cg_proto(), remove that too.
