staging: wilc1000: rename index to tcp_pending_ack_idx

This patch renames "index" of struct txq_entry_t to tcp_pending_ack_idx
since this name could be confused index of txq_entry_t. It is index of
tcp pending ack.

It fixes 8e55639d066f ("staging: wilc1000: rename tcp_PendingAck_index
of struct txq_entry_t")
