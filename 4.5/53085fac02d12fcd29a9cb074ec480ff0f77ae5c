ext4: provide ext4_issue_zeroout()

Create new function ext4_issue_zeroout() to zeroout contiguous (both
logically and physically) part of inode data. We will need to issue
zeroout when extent structure is not readily available and this function
will allow us to do it without making up fake extent structures.
