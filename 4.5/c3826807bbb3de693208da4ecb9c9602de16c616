regulatory: fix world regulatory domain data

The rule definitions here aren't really valid, they would
be rejected if it came from userspace due to the bandwidth
specified being bigger than the rule's width.

This is fairly much inconsequential since the other rules
around them do enable the bandwidth, but express that better
using the NL80211_RRF_AUTO_BW flag.
