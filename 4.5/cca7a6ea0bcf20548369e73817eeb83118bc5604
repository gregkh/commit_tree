ACPICA: Update parameter type for ObjectType operator

ACPICA commit 67953304a34944548f2fa53a4b0786a5db0ca2ea

The grammar for this operator changed in ACPI 5.0A, but it was
not necessary to update the interpreter/parser until now.

The UserTerm (method invocation) element was removed. Previously
a SuperName, the lone argument now requires a new ARGP_ type.
