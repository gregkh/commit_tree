ncr5380: Fix EH during arbitration and selection

During arbitration and selection, the relevant command is invisible to
exception handlers and can be found only in a pointer on the stack of a
different thread.

When eh_abort_handler can't find a given command, it can't decide whether
that command was completed already or is still in arbitration or selection
phase. But it must return either SUCCESS (e.g. command completed earlier)
or FAILED (could not abort the nexus, try bus reset).

The solution is to make sure all commands belonging to the LLD are always
visible to exception handlers. Add another scsi_cmnd pointer to the
hostdata struct to track the command in arbitration or selection phase.

Replace 'retain_dma_irq' with the new 'selecting' pointer, to bring
atari_NCR5380.c into line with NCR5380.c.
