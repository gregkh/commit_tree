arm: dts: berlin2q-marvell-dmp: remove broken-cd from eMMC node

The eMMC is non-removable so is marked with the non-removable DT
property to avoid having to redetect it after a suspend/resume.

But it also has the broken-cd property which is wrong since only
one of the DT properties for card detection should be used
