[media] media-device: use unsigned ints on some places

The entity->num_pads are defined as u16. So, better to use an
unsigned int, as this prevents additional warnings when W=2
(or W=1 on some architectures).

The "i" counter at __media_device_get_topology() is also a
monotonic counter that should never be below zero. So,
make it unsigned too.
