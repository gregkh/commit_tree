IB/qib: Improve ipoib UD performance

Based on profiling, UD performance drops in case of processes
in a single client due to excess context switches when
the progress workqueue is scheduled.

This is solved by modifying the heuristic to select the
direct progress instead of the scheduling progress via
the workqueue when UD-like situations are detected in
the heuristic.
