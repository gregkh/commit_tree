ALSA: hda - Flush the pending probe work at remove

As HD-audio driver does deferred probe internally via workqueue, the
driver might go into the mixed state doing both probe and remove when
the module gets unloaded during the probe work.  This eventually
triggers an Oops, unsurprisingly.

For avoiding this race, we just need to flush the pending probe work
explicitly before actually starting the resource release.
