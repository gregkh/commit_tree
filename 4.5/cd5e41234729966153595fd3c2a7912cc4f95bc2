dwc_eth_qos: do phy_start before resetting hardware

This reverts the changed init order from commit 3647bc35bd42
("dwc_eth_qos: Reset hardware before PHY start") and makes another fix
for the race.

It turned out that the reset state machine of the dwceqos hardware
requires PHY clocks to be present in order to complete the reset
cycle.

To plug the race with the phy state machine we defer link speed
setting until the hardware init has finished.
