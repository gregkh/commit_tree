nfs: handle request add failure properly

When we fail to queue a read page to IO descriptor,
we need to clean it up otherwise it is hanging around
preventing nfs module from being removed.

When we fail to queue a write page to IO descriptor,
we need to clean it up and also save the failure status
to open context. Then at file close, we can try to write
pages back again and drop the page if it fails to writeback
in .launder_page, which will be done in the next patch.
