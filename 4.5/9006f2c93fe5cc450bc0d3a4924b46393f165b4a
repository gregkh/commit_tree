f2fs: kill f2fs_drop_largest_extent

For direct IO, f2fs only allocate new address for the block which is not
exist in the disk before, its mapping info should not exist in extent
cache previously, so here we do not need to call f2fs_drop_largest_extent
to drop related cache.

Due to no more callers for f2fs_drop_largest_extent now, kill it.
