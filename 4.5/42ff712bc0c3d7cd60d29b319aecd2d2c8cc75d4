arm64: bpf: add extra pass to handle faulty codegen

Code generation functions in arch/arm64/kernel/insn.c previously
BUG_ON invalid parameters. Following change of that behavior, now we
need to handle the error case where AARCH64_BREAK_FAULT is returned.

Instead of error-handling on every emit() in JIT, we add a new
validation pass at the end of JIT compilation. There's no point in
running JITed code at run-time only to trap due to AARCH64_BREAK_FAULT.
Instead, we drop this failed JIT compilation and allow the system to
gracefully fallback on the BPF interpreter.
