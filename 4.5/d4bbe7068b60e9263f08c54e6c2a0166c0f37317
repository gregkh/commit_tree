dax: fix NULL pointer dereference in __dax_dbg()

In __dax_pmd_fault() we currently assume that get_block() will always
set bh.b_bdev and we unconditionally dereference it in __dax_dbg().

This assumption isn't always true - when called for reads of holes
ext4_dax_mmap_get_block() returns a buffer head where bh->b_bdev is
never set.  I hit this BUG while testing the DAX PMD fault path.

Instead, initialize bh.b_bdev before passing bh into get_block().  It is
possible that the filesystem's get_block() will update bh.b_bdev, and
this is fine - we just want to initialize bh.b_bdev to something
reasonable so that the calls to __dax_dbg() work and print something
useful.
