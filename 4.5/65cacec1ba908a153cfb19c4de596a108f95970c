selftests/x86: Test __kernel_sigreturn and __kernel_rt_sigreturn

The vdso-based sigreturn mechanism is fragile and isn't used by
modern glibc so, if we break it, we'll only notice when someone
tests an unusual libc.

Add an explicit selftest.

[ I wrote this while debugging a Bionic breakage -- my first guess
  was that I had somehow messed up sigreturn.  I've caused problems in
  that code before, and it's really easy to fail to notice it because
  there's nothing on a modern distro that needs vdso-based sigreturn. ]
