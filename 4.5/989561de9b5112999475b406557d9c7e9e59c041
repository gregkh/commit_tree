PM / Domains: add setter for dev.pm_domain

Adds a function that sets the pointer to dev_pm_domain in struct device
and that warns if the device has already finished probing. The reason
why we want to enforce that is because in the general case that can
cause problems and also that we can simplify code quite a bit if we can
always assume that.

This patch also changes all current code that directly sets the
dev.pm_domain pointer.
