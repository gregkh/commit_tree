mm: memcontrol: do not account memory+swap on unified hierarchy

The unified hierarchy memory controller doesn't expose the memory+swap
counter to userspace, but its accounting is hardcoded in all charge
paths right now, including the per-cpu charge cache ("the stock").

To avoid adding yet more pointless memory+swap accounting with the
socket memory support in unified hierarchy, disable the counter
altogether when in unified hierarchy mode.
