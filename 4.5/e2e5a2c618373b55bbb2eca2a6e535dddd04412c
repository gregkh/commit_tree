i2c: brcmstb: Adding support for CM and DSL SoCs

Broadcoms DSL, CM (cable modem)and STB I2C core implementation have
8 data in/out registers that can transfer 8 bytes or 32 bytes max.
Cable and DSL "Peripheral" i2c cores use single byte per data
register and the STB can use 4 byte per data register transfer.
Adding support to take care of this difference. Accordingly added
the compatible string for SoCs using the "Peripheral" I2C block.
