storvsc: Install the storvsc specific timeout handler for FC devices

The default timeout routine used for FC transport is not suitable for FC
devices managed by storvsc since FC devices managed by storvsc driver do
not have an rport associated with them. Use the time out handler used
for SCSI devices for FC devices as well.
