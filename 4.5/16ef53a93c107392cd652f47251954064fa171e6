drm/nouveau/disp: activate dual link TMDS links only when possible

Without this patch a pixel clock rate above 165 MHz on a TMDS link is
assumed to be dual link. This is true for DVI, but not for HDMI. HDMI
supports no dual link, but it supports pixel clock rates above 165 MHz.
Only activate Dual Link mode when it is actually possible and requested.
