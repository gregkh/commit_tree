Drivers: hv: ring_buffer: remove code duplication from hv_ringbuffer_peek/read()

hv_ringbuffer_peek() does the same as hv_ringbuffer_read() without
advancing the read index. The only functional change this patch brings
is moving hv_need_to_signal_on_read() call under the ring_lock but this
function is just a couple of comparisons.
