drm/i915: Don't pass *DP around to link training functions

It just makes the code more confusing, so just reference intel_dp_>DP
directly.

Note that this also fix a bug where the value of intel_dp->DP could be
different than the last value written to the hw, due to an early return
that would skip the 'intel_dp->DP = DP' line.

v2: Don't preserve old DP value on failure. (Sivakumar)
  - Don't call drm_dp_clock_recovery_ok() twice. (Sivakumar)
  - Keep return type of clock recovery and channel equalization
    functions as void. (Ander)

v3: Remove DP parameter from intel_dp_set_signal_levels(). (Sivakumar)
