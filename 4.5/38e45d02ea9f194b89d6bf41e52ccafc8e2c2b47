iommu/amd: Fix boot warning when device 00:00.0 is not iommu covered

The setup code for the performance counters in the AMD IOMMU driver
tests whether the counters can be written. It tests to setup a counter
for device 00:00.0, which fails on systems where this particular device
is not covered by the IOMMU.

Fix this by not relying on device 00:00.0 but only on the IOMMU being
present.
