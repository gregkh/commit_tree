Input: i8042 - add Fujitsu Lifebook U745 to the nomux list

Without i8042.nomux=1 the Elantech touch pad is not working at all on
a Fujitsu Lifebook U745. This patch does not seem necessary for all
U745 (maybe because of different BIOS versions?). However, it was
verified that the patch does not break those (see opensuse bug 883192:
https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=883192).
