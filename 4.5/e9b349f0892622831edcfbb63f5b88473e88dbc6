metag: ftrace: Fix the comments for ftrace_modify_code

There is no need to worry about module and __init text disappearing
case, because that ftrace has a module notifier that is called when
a module is being unloaded and before the text goes away and this
code grabs the ftrace_lock mutex and removes the module functions
from the ftrace list, such that it will no longer do any
modifications to that module's text, the update to make functions
be traced or not is done under the ftrace_lock mutex as well.
And by now, __init section codes should not been modified
by ftrace, because it is black listed in recordmcount.c and
ignored by ftrace.
