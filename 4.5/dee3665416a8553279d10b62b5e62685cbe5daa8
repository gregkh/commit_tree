timekeeping: Provide internal function __ktime_get_real_seconds

In order to fix Y2038 issues in the ntp code we will need replace
get_seconds() with ktime_get_real_seconds() but as the ntp code uses
the timekeeping lock which is also used by ktime_get_real_seconds(),
we need a version without locking.
Add a new function __ktime_get_real_seconds() in timekeeping to
do this.
