NFS/pNFS: Fix up pNFS write reschedule layering violations and bugs

The flexfiles layout in particular, seems to want to poke around in the
O_DIRECT flags when retransmitting.
This patch sets up an interface to allow it to call back into O_DIRECT
to handle retransmission correctly. It also fixes a potential bug whereby
we could change the behaviour of O_DIRECT if an error is already pending.
