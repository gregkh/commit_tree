posix-clock: Fix return code on the poll method's error path

The posix_clock_poll function is supposed to return a bit mask of
POLLxxx values.  However, in case the hardware has disappeared (due to
hot plugging for example) this code returns -ENODEV in a futile
attempt to throw an error at the file descriptor level.  The kernel's
file_operations interface does not accept such error codes from the
poll method.  Instead, this function aught to return POLLERR.

The value -ENODEV does, in fact, contain the POLLERR bit (and almost
all the other POLLxxx bits as well), but only by chance.  This patch
fixes code to return a proper bit mask.

Credit goes to Markus Elfring for pointing out the suspicious
signed/unsigned mismatch.
