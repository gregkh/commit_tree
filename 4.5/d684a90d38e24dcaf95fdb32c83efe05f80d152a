ahci: per-port msix support

Some AHCI controllers support per-port MSI-X vectors.  At the same time
the Linux AHCI driver needs to support one-off architectures that
implement a single MSI-X vector for all ports.  The heuristic for
enabling AHCI ports becomes, in order of preference:

1/ per-port multi-MSI-X

2/ per-port multi-MSI

3/ single MSI

4/ single MSI-X

5/ legacy INTX

This all depends on AHCI implementations with potentially broken MSI-X
requesting less vectors than the number of ports.  If this assumption is
violated we will need to start explicitly white-listing AHCI-MSIX
implementations.
