iommu/io-pgtable: Indicate granule for TLB maintenance

IOMMU hardware with range-based TLB maintenance commands can work
happily with the iova and size arguments passed via the tlb_add_flush
callback, but for IOMMUs which require separate commands per entry in
the range, it is not straightforward to infer the necessary granularity
when it comes to issuing the actual commands.

Add an additional argument indicating the granularity for the benefit
of drivers needing to know, and update the ARM LPAE code appropriately
(for non-leaf invalidations we currently just assume the worst-case
page granularity rather than walking the table to check).
