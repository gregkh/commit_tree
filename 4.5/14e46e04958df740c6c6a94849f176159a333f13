btrfs: synchronize incompat feature bits with sysfs files

The files under /sys/fs/UUID/features get out of sync with the actual
incompat bits set for the filesystem if they change after mount (eg. the
LZO compression).

Synchronize the feature bits with the sysfs files representing them
right after we set/clear them.
