drm/i915: only recompress FBC after flushing a drawing operation

There's no need to stop and restart FBC, which is quite expensive as
we have to revalidate the CRTC state. After flushing a drawing
operation we know the CRTC state hasn't changed, so a nuke
(recompress) should be fine.

v2: Make it simpler (Chris).
v3: Rewrite the patch again due to patch order changes.
v4: Rewrite commit message (Chris).
