arm64: Add do_softirq_own_stack() and enable irq_stacks

entry.S is modified to switch to the per_cpu irq_stack during el{0,1}_irq.
irq_count is used to detect recursive interrupts on the irq_stack, it is
updated late by do_softirq_own_stack(), when called on the irq_stack, before
__do_softirq() re-enables interrupts to process softirqs.

do_softirq_own_stack() is added by this patch, but does not yet switch
stack.

This patch adds the dummy stack frame and data needed by the previous
stack tracing patches.
