block: fix bio splitting on max sectors

After commit e36f62042880(block: split bios to maxpossible length),
bio can be splitted in the middle of a vector entry, then it
is easy to split out one bio which size isn't aligned with block
size, especially when the block size is bigger than 512.

This patch fixes the issue by making the max io size aligned
to logical block size.
