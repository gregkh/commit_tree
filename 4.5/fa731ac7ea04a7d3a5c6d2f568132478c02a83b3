regulator: core: avoid unused variable warning

The second argument of the mutex_lock_nested() helper is only
evaluated if CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC is set. Otherwise we
get this build warning for the new regulator_lock_supply
function:

drivers/regulator/core.c: In function 'regulator_lock_supply':
drivers/regulator/core.c:142:6: warning: unused variable 'i' [-Wunused-variable]

To avoid the warning, this restructures the code to make it
both simpler and to move the 'i++' outside of the mutex_lock_nested
call, where it is now always used and the variable is not
flagged as unused.

We had some discussion about changing mutex_lock_nested to an
inline function, which would make the code do the right thing here,
but in the end decided against it, in order to guarantee that
mutex_lock_nested() does not introduced overhead without
CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC.
