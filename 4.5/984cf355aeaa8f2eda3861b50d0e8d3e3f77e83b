sysrq: Fix warning in sysrq generated crash.

Commit 984d74a72076a1 ("sysrq: rcu-ify __handle_sysrq") replaced
spin_lock_irqsave() calls with rcu_read_lock() calls in sysrq. Since
rcu_read_lock() does not disable preemption, faulthandler_disabled() in
__do_page_fault() in x86/fault.c returns false. When the code later calls
might_sleep() in the pagefault handler, we get the following warning:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at ../arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1187
in_atomic(): 0, irqs_disabled(): 0, pid: 4706, name: bash
Preemption disabled at:[<ffffffff81484339>] printk+0x48/0x4a

To fix this, we release the RCU read lock before we crash.

Tested this patch on linux 3.18 by booting off one of our boards.
