drbd: Backport the "events2" command

The events2 command originates from drbd-9 development. It features
more information but requires a incompatible change in output
format.
Therefore the previous events command continues to exist, the new
improved events2 command becomes available now.

This prepares the user-base for a later switch to the complete
drbd9 code base.
