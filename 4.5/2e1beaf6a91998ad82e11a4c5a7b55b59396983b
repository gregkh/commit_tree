ACPICA: Utilities: Reorder initialization code

ACPICA commit 3894fa9d071343e6ebc7ea480255fa4f27a290be

This patch re-orders initialization code in acpi_enable_subsystem()
so that all hardware reduced stuffs can be collected together.

Note this patch contains code from the following 2 ACPICA upstream commits
so that the changes can be made clearer for the reviewers:
 https://github.com/acpica/acpica/commit/071eff73
 https://github.com/acpica/acpica/commit/3894fa9d
And additional change to remove the global variable and unused code
fragments due to the test result. Lv Zheng.
