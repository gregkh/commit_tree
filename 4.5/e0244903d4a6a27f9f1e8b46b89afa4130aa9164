fm10k: set netdev features in one location

Don't change netdev hw_features later in fm10k_probe, instead set all
values inside fm10k_alloc_netdev. To do so, we need to know the MAC type
(whether it is PF or VF) in order to determine what to do. This helps
ensure that all logic regarding features is co-located.
