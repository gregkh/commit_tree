ACPICA: Revert "acpi_get_object_info: Add support for ACPI 5.0 _SUB method."

ACPICA commit e4743959b59ad93eab7310adf756adc930be0ddb

This reverts commit 8e7a8753827660c3dd1f571f3185610402b756f0.

The _SUB method was found to be problematic for this interface
because some implementations use control methods. Therefore,
it is being removed.

Operations cannot be used because this interface is called
during the device discovery scan and the region handlers are
not fully installed at that time.
