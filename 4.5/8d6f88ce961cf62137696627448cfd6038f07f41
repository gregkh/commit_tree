ASoC: mediatek: Use current HW pointer for pointer callback

Previously we recorded "last interrupt position" and used it in
pointer callback. This is not correct implementation, and it causes
underruns when user space monitors buffer level to decide when to
send next data chunk in low latency application.

Remove position recording in IRQ handler and also hw_ptr in
struct mtk_afe_memif used to record that, and let pointer callback
reports current HW pointer instead.
