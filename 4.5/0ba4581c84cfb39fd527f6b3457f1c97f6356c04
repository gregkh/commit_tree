[media] adv7604: fix tx 5v detect regression

The 5 volt detect functionality broke in 3.14: the code reads IO register 0x70
again after it has already been cleared. Instead it should use the cached
irq_reg_0x70 value and the io_write to 0x71 to clear 0x70 can be dropped since
this has already been done.
