configfs: implement binary attributes

ConfigFS lacked binary attributes up until now. This patch
introduces support for binary attributes in a somewhat similar
manner of sysfs binary attributes albeit with changes that
fit the configfs usage model.

Problems that configfs binary attributes fix are everything that
requires a binary blob as part of the configuration of a resource,
such as bitstream loading for FPGAs, DTBs for dynamically created
devices etc.

Look at Documentation/filesystems/configfs/configfs.txt for internals
and howto use them.

This patch is against linux-next as of today that contains
Christoph's configfs rework.
