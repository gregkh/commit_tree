workqueue: schedule WORK_CPU_UNBOUND work on wq_unbound_cpumask CPUs

WORK_CPU_UNBOUND work items queued to a bound workqueue always run
locally.  This is a good thing normally, but not when the user has
asked us to keep unbound work away from certain CPUs.  Round robin
these to wq_unbound_cpumask CPUs instead, as perturbation avoidance
trumps performance.

tj: Cosmetic and comment changes.  WARN_ON_ONCE() dropped from empty
    (wq_unbound_cpumask AND cpu_online_mask).  If we want that, it
    should be done when config changes.
