arm64: KVM: Obey RES0/1 reserved bits when setting CPTR_EL2

Some bits in CPTR are defined as RES1 in the architecture.  Setting
these bits to zero may unintentionally enable future architecture
extensions, allowing guests to use them without supervision by the host.

This would be bad: for forwards compatibility, this patch makes
sure the affected bits are always written with 1, not 0.

This patch only addresses CPTR_EL2.  Initialisation of other system
registers may still need review.
