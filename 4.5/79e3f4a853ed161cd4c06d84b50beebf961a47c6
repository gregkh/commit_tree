PCI: keystone: Fix MSI code that retrieves struct pcie_port pointer

Commit cbce7900598c ("PCI: designware: Make driver arch-agnostic") changed
the host bridge sysdata pointer from the ARM pci_sys_data to the DesignWare
pcie_port structure, and changed pcie-designware.c to reflect that.  But it
did not change the corresponding code in pci-keystone-dw.c, so it caused
crashes on Keystone:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000030
  pgd = c0003000
  [00000030] *pgd=80000800004003, *pmd=00000000
  Internal error: Oops: 206 [#1] PREEMPT SMP ARM
  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.4.2-00139-gb74f926 #2
  Hardware name: Keystone
  PC is at ks_dw_pcie_msi_irq_unmask+0x24/0x58

Change pci-keystone-dw.c to expect sysdata to be the struct pcie_port
pointer.
