crypto: sahara - fix 64-bit dma_addr_t compilation

The sahara hardware uses DMA descriptors with 32-bit addresses, but
dma_addr_t is variable size depending on whether we want to support
any devices that use 64-bit DMA addresses in hardware.
This means that the definition of the DMA descriptor structure is wrong,
and we helpfully get a compiler warning about them too:

drivers/crypto/sahara.c:423:372: warning: format '%x' expects argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 4 has type 'dma_addr_t {aka long long unsigned int}' [-Wformat=]

This changes the definition of the sahara_hw_desc and sahara_hw_link
structures to only contain fixed-length members, which is required
to make the driver work on ARM LPAE mode, and avoids most of the
gcc warnings we get.
