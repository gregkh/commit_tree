s390: show virtualization support in /proc/cpuinfo

This patch exposes the SIE capability (aka virtualization support) via
/proc/cpuinfo -> "features" as "sie".

As we don't want to expose this hwcap via elf, let's add a second,
"internal"/non-elf capability list. The content is simply concatenated
to the existing features when printing /proc/cpuinfo.

We also add the defines to elf.h to keep the hwcap stuff at a common
place.
