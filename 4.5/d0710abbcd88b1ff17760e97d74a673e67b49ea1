drm/i915: Set the map-and-fenceable flag for preallocated objects

As we mark the preallocated objects as bound, we should also flag them
correctly as being map-and-fenceable (if appropriate!) so that later
users do not get confused and try and rebind the pinned vma in order to
get a map-and-fenceable binding.
