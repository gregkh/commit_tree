ALSA: pcm: Fix snd_pcm_hw_params struct copy in compat mode

This reverts one hunk of
commit ef44a1ec6eee ("ALSA: sound/core: use memdup_user()"), which
replaced a number of kmalloc followed by memcpy with memdup calls.

In this case, we are copying from a struct snd_pcm_hw_params32 to
a struct snd_pcm_hw_params, but the latter is 4 bytes longer than
the 32-bit version, so we need to separate kmalloc and copy calls.

This actually leads to an out-of-bounds memory access later on
in sound/soc/soc-pcm.c:soc_pcm_hw_params() (detected using KASan).
