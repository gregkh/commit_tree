leds: bcm6328: Reuse bcm6328_led_set() instead of copying its functionality

When ensuring a consistent initial LED state in bcm6328_led (as they may
be blinking instead of on/off), the LED register is set using an inverted
copy of bcm6328_led_set(). To avoid further errors relating to active low
handling, call this function directly instead.

As bcm6328_led_set() acquires the same spinlock again when updating the
register, it is called after unlocking.
