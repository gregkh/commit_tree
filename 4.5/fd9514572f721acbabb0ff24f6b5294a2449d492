KVM: x86: MMU: Add helper function to clear a bit in unsync child bitmap

Both __mmu_unsync_walk() and mmu_pages_clear_parents() have three line
code which clears a bit in the unsync child bitmap; the former places it
inside a loop block and uses a few goto statements to jump to it.

A new helper function, clear_unsync_child_bit(), makes the code cleaner.
