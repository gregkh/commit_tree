i40e: Move the saving of old link info from handle_link_event to link_event

The watchdog only calls link_event not handle_link_event which means
that we need to save the old information in link_event.

Previously when polling we were comparing current data to the old data
saved the last time we actually received a link event. This means that
the polling would only fix link status changes in one direction
depending on what the last old data saved off was.
