iwlwifi: mvm: Add a station in monitor mode

Currently when creating a new vif in monitor mode the driver doesn't
allocate a specific station. This causes that in the situation that
tx traffic is injected, the tx queues are not scheduled,
with the result of a TFD queue hang.
Fix that by allocating a station and ensuring its tx queues
are scheduled.
