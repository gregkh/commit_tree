ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix to ignore codec_mask check in probe

We have both I2S and hda codec support in the driver. codec_mask
check is relevant only for hda codec and some boards may have
only I2S Codec, so removed probe error in case no hda codec is
found and update the log to info as it may not be error.
