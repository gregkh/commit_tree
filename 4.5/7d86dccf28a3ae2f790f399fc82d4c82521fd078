list: Introduces generic list_splice_tail_init_rcu()

The list_splice_init_rcu() can be used as a stack onto which full lists
are pushed, but queue-like behavior is now needed by some security
policies.  This requires a list_splice_tail_init_rcu().

This commit therefore supplies a list_splice_tail_init_rcu() by
pulling code common it and to list_splice_init_rcu() into a new
__list_splice_init_rcu() function.  This new function is based on the
existing list_splice_init_rcu() implementation.
