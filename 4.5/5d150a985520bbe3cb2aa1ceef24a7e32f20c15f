ipv6: re-enable fragment header matching in ipv6_find_hdr

When ipv6_find_hdr is used to find a fragment header
(caller specifies target NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT) we erronously return
-ENOENT for all fragments with nonzero offset.

Before commit 9195bb8e381d, when target was specified, we did not
enter the exthdr walk loop as nexthdr == target so this used to work.

Now we do (so we can skip empty route headers). When we then stumble upon
a frag with nonzero frag_off we must return -ENOENT ("header not found")
only if the caller did not specifically request NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT.

This allows nfables exthdr expression to match ipv6 fragments, e.g. via

nft add rule ip6 filter input frag frag-off gt 0
