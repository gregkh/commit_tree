i40e: Opcode and structures required by OEM Post Update AQ command and add new NVM arq message

This is a part of implementation which contains data structures and
opcode for new AQ command. There's a new ARQ message that gets sent
near the end of the NVM update process that the driver should recognize
and ignore, rather than printing an Unknown Event error.
