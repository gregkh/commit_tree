btrfs: raid56: Use raid_write_end_io for scrub

No need to create additional end_io function for scrub, it increased
code size and introduced some un-unified lines, as:
raid_write_parity_end_io():
        int err = bio->bi_error;
        if (bio->bi_error)
raid_write_end_io():
        int err = bio->bi_error;
        if (err)

This patch combines them.
