drm/sysfs: Send out uevent when connector->force changes

To avoid even more code duplication punt this all to the probe worker,
which needs some slight adjustment to also generate a uevent when the
status has changed to due connector->force.

v2: Instead of running the output_poll_work (which is kinda the wrong
thing and a layering violation since it's an internal of the probe
helpers), or calling ->detect (which is again a layering violation
since it's used only by probe helpers) just call the official
->fill_modes function, like a GET_CONNECTOR ioctl call.

v3: Restore the accidentally removed forced-probe for echo "detect" >
force.
