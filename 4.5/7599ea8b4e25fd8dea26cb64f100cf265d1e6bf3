kbuild: Demote 'sign-compare' warning to W=2

Ideally, a kernel compile with W=1 enabled should complete cleanly;
however, when we run one currently we are presented with ~25k warnings.
'sign-compare' accounts for ~22k of those ~25k.

In this patch we're demoting 'sign-compare' warnings to W=2, with a view
to fixing the remaining 3k W=1 warnings required for a clean build.

Arnd adds:
  "As per our discussion, I'd add that this was inadvertedly introduced
   by Behan when he moved the clang specific warnings into an ifdef block
   and did not notice that -Wsign-compare was interpreted by both gcc
   and clang.

   Earlier, it was introduced in just the same way by Jan-Simon as part
   of 3d3d6b847420 ("kbuild: LLVMLinux: Adapt warnings for compilation
   with clang")."
