mm: memcontrol: do not uncharge old page in page cache replacement

Changing page->mem_cgroup of a live page is tricky and fragile.  In
particular, the memcg writeback code relies on that mapping being stable
and users of mem_cgroup_replace_page() not overlapping with dirtyable
inodes.

Page cache replacement doesn't have to do that, though.  Instead of being
clever and transferring the charge from the old page to the new,
force-charge the new page and leave the old page alone.  A temporary
overcharge won't matter in practice, and the old page is going to be freed
shortly after this anyway.  And this is not performance critical.
