KVM: s390: Introduce switching code

This patch adds code that performs transparent switch to Extended
SCA on addition of 65th VCPU in a VM. Disposal of ESCA is added too.
The entier ESCA functionality, however, is still not enabled.
The enablement will be provided in a separate patch.

This patch also uses read/write lock protection of SCA and its subfields for
possible disposal at the BSCA-to-ESCA transition. While only Basic SCA needs such
a protection (for the swap), any SCA access is now guarded.
