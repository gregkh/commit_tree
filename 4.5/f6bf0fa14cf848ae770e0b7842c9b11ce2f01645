powerpc/eeh: Fix partial hotplug criterion

During error recovery, the device could be removed as part of the
partial hotplug. The criterion used to come with partial hotplug
is: if the device driver provides error_detected(), slot_reset()
and resume() callbacks, it's immune from hotplug. Otherwise,
it's going to experience partial hotplug during EEH recovery. But
the criterion isn't correct enough: mlx4_core driver for Mellanox
adapters provides error_detected(), slot_reset() callbacks, but
resume() isn't there. Those Mellanox adapters won't be to involved
in the partial hotplug.

This fixes the criterion to a practical one: adpater with driver
that provides error_detected(), slot_reset() will be immune from
partial hotplug. resume() isn't mandatory.
