serial: 8250: of: Fix the driver and actually compile the 8250_of

The 8250_of never compiled since in the Kconfig we have SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM
but in the makefile we expect to have SERIAL_8250_OF...

When the 8250_of.c is actually compiled we will have two errors:
missing linux/nwpserial.h and 8250/8250.h.
Fix those as well at the same time when enable the compilation of the
driver.
