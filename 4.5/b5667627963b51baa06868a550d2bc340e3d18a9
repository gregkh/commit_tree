drm/i915/bxt: Fix eDP panel fitting (v2)

BXT CRTC scaling uses the same gen9 codepaths as SKL; these codepaths
store panel fitter information in pipe_config->pch_pfit.  However since
HAS_PCH_SPLIT() is false for BXT we never actually wind up filling in
this structure (we wind up filling in pipe_config->gmch_pfit instead,
which is ignored when we go to program the hardware).  Make sure we
always take the PCH code path on gen9+ platforms.

v2: Use HAS_GMCH_DISPLAY() to more cleanly describe the platforms that
    actually want to use GMCH-style panel fitting.  (Ville)
