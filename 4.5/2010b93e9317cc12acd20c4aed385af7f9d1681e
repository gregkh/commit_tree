net: tcp: deal with listen sockets properly in tcp_abort.

When closing a listen socket, tcp_abort currently calls
tcp_done without clearing the request queue. If the socket has a
child socket that is established but not yet accepted, the child
socket is then left without a parent, causing a leak.

Fix this by setting the socket state to TCP_CLOSE and calling
inet_csk_listen_stop with the socket lock held, like tcp_close
does.

Tested using net_test. With this patch, calling SOCK_DESTROY on a
listen socket that has an established but not yet accepted child
socket results in the parent and the child being closed, such
that they no longer appear in sock_diag dumps.
