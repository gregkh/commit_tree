IB/mlx5: Support IB device's callback for getting its netdev

For Eth ports only:
Maintain a net device pointer in mlx5_ib_device and update it
upon NETDEV_REGISTER and NETDEV_UNREGISTER events if the
net-device and IB device have the same PCI parent device.
Implement the get_netdev callback to return this net device.
