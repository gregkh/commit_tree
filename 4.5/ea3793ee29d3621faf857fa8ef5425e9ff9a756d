core: enable more fine-grained datagram reception control

The __skb_recv_datagram routine in core/ datagram.c provides a general
skb reception factility supposed to be utilized by protocol modules
providing datagram sockets. It encompasses both the actual recvmsg code
and a surrounding 'sleep until data is available' loop. This is
inconvenient if a protocol module has to use additional locking in order
to maintain some per-socket state the generic datagram socket code is
unaware of (as the af_unix code does). The patch below moves the recvmsg
proper code into a new __skb_try_recv_datagram routine which doesn't
sleep and renames wait_for_more_packets to
__skb_wait_for_more_packets, both routines being exported interfaces. The
original __skb_recv_datagram routine is reimplemented on top of these
two functions such that its user-visible behaviour remains unchanged.
