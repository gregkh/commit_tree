ARM: defconfig: multi_v7: Enable Qualcomm options for Honami

The Honami device does not boot due to the lack of pinctrl support
compiled in with the multi_v7_defconfig. This patch correct this and
enables coincell, sdhci, smsm, smp2p and wcnss_ctrl as well, all found
on a variety of Qualcomm boards.
