kbuild: Allow to specify composite modules with modname-m

This allows to write

  drm-$(CONFIG_AGP) += drm_agpsupport.o

without having to handle CONFIG_AGP=y vs. CONFIG_AGP=m. Only support
this syntax for modules, since built-in code depending on something
modular cannot work and init/Makefile actually relies on the current
semantics. There are a few drivers which adapted to the current
semantics out of necessity; these are fixed to also work when the
respective subsystem is modular.
