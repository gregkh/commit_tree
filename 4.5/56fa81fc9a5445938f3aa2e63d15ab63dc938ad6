MIPS: scache: Fix scache init with invalid line size.

In current scache init cache line_size is determined from
cpu config register, however if there there no scache
then mips_sc_probe_cm3 function populates a invalid line_size of 2.

The invalid line_size can cause a NULL pointer deference
during r4k_dma_cache_inv as r4k_blast_scache is populated
based on line_size. Scache line_size of 2 is invalid option in
r4k_blast_scache_setup.

This issue was faced during a MIPS I6400 based virtual platform bring up
where scache was not available in virtual platform model.
