gro: Make GRO aware of lightweight tunnels.

GRO is currently not aware of tunnel metadata generated by lightweight
tunnels and stored in the dst. This leads to two possible problems:
 * Incorrectly merging two frames that have different metadata.
 * Leaking of allocated metadata from merged frames.

This avoids those problems by comparing the tunnel information before
merging, similar to how we handle other metadata (such as vlan tags),
and releasing any state when we are done.
