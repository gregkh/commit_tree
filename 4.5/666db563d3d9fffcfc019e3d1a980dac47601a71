EDAC, mpc85xx: Make mpc85xx-pci-edac a platform device

Originally the mpc85xx-pci-edac driver bound directly to the PCI
controller node.

Commit

  905e75c46dba ("powerpc/fsl-pci: Unify pci/pcie initialization code")

turned the PCI controller code into a platform device. Since we can't
have two drivers binding to the same device, the EDAC code was changed
to be called into as a library-style submodule. However, this doesn't
work if the EDAC driver is built as a module.

Commit

  8d8fcba6d1ea ("EDAC: Rip out the edac_subsys reference counting")

exposed another problem with this approach -- mpc85xx_pci_err_probe()
was being called in the same early boot phase that the PCI controller
is initialized, rather than in the device_initcall phase that the EDAC
layer expects. This caused a crash on boot.

To fix this, the PCI controller code now creates a child platform device
specifically for EDAC, which the mpc85xx-pci-edac driver binds to.
