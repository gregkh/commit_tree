mmc: enable MMC/SD/SDIO device to suspend/resume asynchronously

Now, PM core supports asynchronous suspend/resume mode for devices
during system suspend/resume, and the power state transition of one
device may be completed in separate kernel thread. PM core ensures
all power state transition dependency between devices. This patch
enables MMC/SD/SDIO card and SDIO function devices to suspend/resume
asynchronously. This will take advantage of multicore and improve
system suspend/resume speed. After applying this patch and enabling
all SDIO function's child devices to suspend/resume asynchronously
on ASUS T100TA, the system suspend-to-idle time is reduced from
1645ms to 1108ms, and the system resume time is reduced from 940ms
to 918ms.
