ASoC: arizona: In arizona_calc_fratio make new codecs the default case

This patch rearranges the switch statement in arizona_calc_fratio so
that older codecs are the special cases, with the default case
applying to newer codecs (WM8998 and later). This is preferable
because it avoids having to patch new cases in every time a new
codec is added.
