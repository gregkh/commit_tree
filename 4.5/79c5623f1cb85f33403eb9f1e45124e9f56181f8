usb: musb: ux500: Fix NULL pointer dereference at system PM

The commit 7d32cdef5356 ("usb: musb: fail with error when no DMA
controller set"), caused the core platform driver to correctly return an
error code when fail probing.

Unfurtante it also caused bug for a NULL pointer dereference, during
system suspend for the ux500 driver. The reason is a lacking validation
of the corresponding ->driver_data pointer, which won't be set when the
musb core driver fails to probe (or haven't yet been probed).
