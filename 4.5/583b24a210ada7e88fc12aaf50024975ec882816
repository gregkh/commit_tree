arch/tile: adopt prepare_exit_to_usermode() model from x86

This change is a prerequisite change for TASK_ISOLATION but also
stands on its own for readability and maintainability.  The existing
tile do_work_pending() was called in a loop from assembly on
the slow path; this change moves the loop into C code as well.
For the x86 version see commit c5c46f59e4e7 ("x86/entry: Add new,
comprehensible entry and exit handlers written in C").

This change exposes a pre-existing bug on the older tilepro platform;
the singlestep processing is done last, but on tilepro (unlike tilegx)
we enable interrupts while doing that processing, so we could in
theory miss a signal or other asynchronous event.  A future change
could fix this by breaking the singlestep work into a "prepare"
step done in the main loop, and a "trigger" step done after exiting
the loop.  Since this change is intended as purely a restructuring
change, we call out the bug explicitly now, but don't yet fix it.
