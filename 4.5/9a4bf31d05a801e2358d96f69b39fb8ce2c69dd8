nfs: add new tracepoint for pnfs_update_layout

pnfs_update_layout is really the "nexus" of layout handling. If it
returns NULL then we end up going through the MDS. This patch adds
some tracepoints to that function that allow us to determine the
cause when we end up going through the MDS unexpectedly.
