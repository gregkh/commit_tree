perf buildid-list: Show running kernel build id fix

The --kernel option of perf buildid-list tool should show the running
kernel buildid.  The functionality has been lost during other changes of
the related code.

The build_id__sprintf() function should return length of the build-id
string,  but it was the length of the build-id raw data instead. Due to
that, some return value checking caused that the final string was not
printed out.

With this patch the build_id__sprintf() returns the correct value, so
the --kernel option works again.

Before:

	# perf buildid-list --kernel
	#

After:

	# perf buildid-list --kernel
