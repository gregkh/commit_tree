[media] media_entity: rename media_obj functions to *_create *_destroy

Those media_obj_* functions are actually creating/destroying
media graph objects. So, rename them to better represent
what they're actually doing.

No functional changes.

This was created via this small shell script:

	for i in $(git grep -l media_gobj_init); do sed s,media_gobj_init,media_gobj_create,g <$i >a && mv a $i; done
	for i in $(git grep -l media_gobj_remove); do sed s,media_gobj_remove,media_gobj_destroy,g <$i >a && mv a $i; done
