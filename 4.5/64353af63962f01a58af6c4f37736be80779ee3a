net:hns: Add Hip06 "TSO(TCP Segment Offload)" support HNS Driver

This patch adds the support of "TSO (TCP Segment Offload)" feature
provided by the Hip06 ethernet hardware to the HNS ethernet
driver.

Enabling this feature would help offload the TCP Segmentation
process to the Hip06 ethernet hardware. This eventually would help
in saving precious cpu cycles.
