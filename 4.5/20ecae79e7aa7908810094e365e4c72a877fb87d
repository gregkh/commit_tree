crypto: atmel - fix 64-bit warnings

The atmel AES driver assumes that 'int' and 'size_t' are the same
type in multiple locations, which the compiler warns about when
building it for 64-bit systems:

In file included from ../drivers/crypto/atmel-aes.c:17:0:
drivers/crypto/atmel-aes.c: In function 'atmel_aes_sg_copy':
include/linux/kernel.h:724:17: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
drivers/crypto/atmel-aes.c:448:11: note: in expansion of macro 'min'

drivers/crypto/atmel-aes.c: In function 'atmel_aes_crypt_dma_stop':
include/linux/kern_levels.h:4:18: warning: format '%u' expects argument of type 'unsigned int', but argument 2 has type 'size_t {aka long unsigned int}' [-Wformat=]

This changes the format strings to use the %z modifier when printing
a size_t, and makes sure that we use the correct size_t type where
needed. In case of sg_dma_len(), the type of the result depends
on CONFIG_NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH, so we have to use min_t to get it to
work in all configurations.
