rcutorture: Flag nonexistent RCU GP kthread

Currently, if the RCU grace-period kthread has not yet been created,
in which case the starvation-check code will print zero for the state,
which maps to TASK_RUNNING.  This could clearly be quite confusing, so
this commit prints ~0, which does not map to any legal ->state value.
