parisc: Fix __ARCH_SI_PREAMBLE_SIZE

On a 64bit kernel build the compiler aligns the _sifields union in the
struct siginfo_t on a 64bit address. The __ARCH_SI_PREAMBLE_SIZE define
compensates for this alignment and thus fixes the wait testcase of the
strace package.

The symptoms of a wrong __ARCH_SI_PREAMBLE_SIZE value is that
_sigchld.si_stime variable is missed to be copied and thus after a
copy_siginfo() will have uninitialized values.
