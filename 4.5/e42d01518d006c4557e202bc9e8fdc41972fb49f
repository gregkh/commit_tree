atari_NCR5380: Fix queue_size limit

When a target reports a QUEUE_FULL condition it causes the driver to
update the 'queue_size' limit with the number of currently allocated tags.
At least, that's what's supposed to happen, according to the comments.
Unfortunately the terms in the assignment are swapped. Fix this and
cleanup some obsolete comments.
