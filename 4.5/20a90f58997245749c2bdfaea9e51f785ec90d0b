dax: give DAX clearing code correct bdev

dax_clear_blocks() needs a valid struct block_device and previously it
was using inode->i_sb->s_bdev in all cases.  This is correct for normal
inodes on mounted ext2, ext4 and XFS filesystems, but is incorrect for
DAX raw block devices and for XFS real-time devices.

Instead, rename dax_clear_blocks() to dax_clear_sectors(), and change
its arguments to take a bdev and a sector instead of an inode and a
block.  This better reflects what the function does, and it allows the
filesystem and raw block device code to pass in an appropriate struct
block_device.
