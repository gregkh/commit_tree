tipc: fix node reference count bug

Commit 5405ff6e15f40f2f ("tipc: convert node lock to rwlock")
introduced a bug to the node reference counter handling. When a
message is successfully sent in the function tipc_node_xmit(),
we return directly after releasing the node lock, instead of
continuing and decrementing the node reference counter as we
should do.

This commit fixes this bug.
