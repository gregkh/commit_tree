tracing: Update cond flag when enabling or disabling a trigger

When a trigger is enabled, the cond flag should be set beforehand,
otherwise a trigger that's expecting to process a trace record
(e.g. one with post_trigger set) could be invoked without one.

Likewise a trigger's cond flag should be reset after it's disabled,
not before.
