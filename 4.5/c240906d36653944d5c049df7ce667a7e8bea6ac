drm/atomic-helper: Export framebuffer_changed()

The Rockchip driver cannot use drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks()
because it has hardware counters for neither vblanks nor scanlines.

In order to simplify re-implementing the functionality for this driver,
export the framebuffer_changed() helper so it can be reused.
