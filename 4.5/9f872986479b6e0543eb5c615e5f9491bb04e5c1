fm10k: Fix handling of NAPI budget when multiple queues are enabled per vector

This patch corrects an issue in which the polling routine would increase
the budget for Rx to at least 1 per queue if multiple queues were present.
This would result in Rx packets being processed when the budget was 0 which
is meant to indicate that no Rx can be handled.
