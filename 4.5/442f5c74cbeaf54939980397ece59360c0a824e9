perf/x86: Use INST_RETIRED.TOTAL_CYCLES_PS for cycles:pp for Skylake

I added UOPS_RETIRED.ALL by mistake to the Skylake PEBS event list for
cycles:pp. But the event is not documented for Skylake, and has some
issues.

The recommended replacement for cycles:pp is to use
INST_RETIRED.ANY+pebs as a base, similar to what CPUs before Sandy
Bridge did. This new event is called INST_RETIRED.TOTAL_CYCLES_PS. The
event is not really new, but has been already used by perf before
Sandy Bridge for the original cycles:p

Note the SDM doesn't document that event either, but it's being
documented in the latest version of the event list on:

  https://download.01.org/perfmon/SKL

This patch does:

 - Remove UOPS_RETIRED.ALL from the Skylake PEBS event list

 - Add INST_RETIRED.ANY to the Skylake PEBS event list, and an table entry to
   allow cmask=16,inv=1 for cycles:pp

 - We don't need an extra entry for the base INST_RETIRED event,
   because it is already covered by the catch-all PEBS table entry.

 - Switch Skylake to use the Core2 PEBS alias (which is
   INST_RETIRED.TOTAL_CYCLES_PS)
