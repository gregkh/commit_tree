ASoC: dpcm: Apply symmetry for DPCM

DPCM does not fully support symmetry attributes. soc_pcm_apply_symmetry()
is skipped in soc_pcm_open() for DPCM, without being applied elsewhere.
So HW parameters cannot be correctly limited, and user space can do
playback/capture at different rates while HW actually does not support it.
soc_pcm_params_symmetry() will return error and the second stream stops.

This patch adds soc_pcm_apply_symmetry() for FE, BE, and codec DAIs
in DPCM path that was skipped in soc_pcm_open().
