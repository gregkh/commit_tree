ALSA: hda - disable dynamic clock gating on Broxton before reset

On Broxton, to make sure the reset controller works properly,
MISCBDCGE bit (bit 6) in CGCTL (0x48) of PCI configuration space
need be cleared before reset and set back to 1 after reset.
Otherwise, it may prevent the CORB/RIRB logic from being reset.
