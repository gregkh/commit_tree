watchdog: ts4800: add driver for TS-4800 watchdog

This watchdog is instantiated in a FPGA that is memory mapped. It is
made of only one register, called the feed register. Writing to this
register will re-arm the watchdog for a given time (and enable it if it
was disable). It can be disabled by writing a special value into it.

It is part of a syscon block, and the watchdog register offset in this
block varies from board to board. This offset is passed in the syscon
property after the phandle to the syscon node.
