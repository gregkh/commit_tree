ALSA: seq: Fix lockdep warnings due to double mutex locks

The port subscription code uses double mutex locks for source and
destination ports, and this may become racy once when wrongly set up.
It leads to lockdep warning splat, typically triggered by fuzzer like
syzkaller, although the actual deadlock hasn't been seen, so far.

This patch simplifies the handling by reducing to two single locks, so
that no lockdep warning will be trigger any longer.

By splitting to two actions, a still-in-progress element shall be
added in one list while handling another.  For ignoring this element,
a new check is added in deliver_to_subscribers().

Along with it, the code to add/remove the subscribers list element was
cleaned up and refactored.
