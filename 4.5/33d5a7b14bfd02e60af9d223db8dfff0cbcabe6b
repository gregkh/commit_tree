netfilter: nf_tables: extend tracing infrastructure

nft monitor mode can then decode and display this trace data.

Parts of LL/Network/Transport headers are provided as separate
attributes.

Otherwise, printing IP address data becomes virtually impossible
for userspace since in the case of the netdev family we really don't
want userspace to have to know all the possible link layer types
and/or sizes just to display/print an ip address.

We also don't want userspace to have to follow ipv6 header chains
to get the s/dport info, the kernel already did this work for us.

To avoid bloating nft_do_chain all data required for tracing is
encapsulated in nft_traceinfo.

The structure is initialized unconditionally(!) for each nft_do_chain
invocation.

This unconditionall call will be moved under a static key in a
followup patch.

With lots of help from Patrick McHardy and Pablo Neira.
