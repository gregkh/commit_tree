staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: absorb pci_dio_add_do()

This function initializes a digitial output subdevice. For aesthetics,
absorb it into the (*auto_attach).

Remove the improper initialization of the SDF_LSAMPL subdev_flag and
len_chanlist. These are only used by subdevices that support async
commands.

Also remove the unnecessary initilaization of the subdevice 'state'.
