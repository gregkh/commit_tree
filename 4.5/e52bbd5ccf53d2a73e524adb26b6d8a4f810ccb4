ncr5380: Cleanup bogus {request,release}_region() calls

Commit 8b801ead3d7a ("[ARM] rpc: update Acorn SCSI drivers to modern ecard
interfaces") neglected to remove a request_region() call in cumana_1.c.

Commit eda32612f7b2 ("[PATCH] give all LLDD driver a ->release method") in
history/history.git added some pointless release_region() calls in dtc.c,
pas16.c and t128.c.

Fix these issues.
