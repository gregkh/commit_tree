x86/mm: Fix types used in pgprot cacheability flags translations

For PAE kernels "unsigned long" is not suitable to hold page protection
flags, since _PAGE_NX doesn't fit there. This is the reason for quite a
few W+X pages getting reported as insecure during boot (observed namely
for the entire initrd range).
