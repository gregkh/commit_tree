s390/dasd: fix failfast for disconnected devices

Enabling failfast should let request fail immediately if either an
error occurred or the device gets disconnected.
For disconnected devices new requests are not fetches from the block
queue and therefore failfast is not triggered.

Fix by letting the DASD driver fetch requests for disconnected devices
with failfast active.
