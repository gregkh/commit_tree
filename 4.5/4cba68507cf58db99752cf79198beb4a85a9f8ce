drm/atomic-helper: Reject legacy flips on a disabled pipe

We want this for consistency with existing page_flip semantics.

Since this spurred quite a discussion on IRC also document why we
reject event generation when the pipe is off: It's not that it's hard
to implement, but userspace has a track recording which proves that it's
way too easy to accidentally abuse and cause havoc. We want to make
sure userspace doesn't get away with that.

v2: Somehow thought we do reject events already, but that code only
existed in my imagination ... Also suggestions from Thierry.
