mm: rework virtual memory accounting

When inspecting a vague code inside prctl(PR_SET_MM_MEM) call (which
testing the RLIMIT_DATA value to figure out if we're allowed to assign
new @start_brk, @brk, @start_data, @end_data from mm_struct) it's been
commited that RLIMIT_DATA in a form it's implemented now doesn't do
anything useful because most of user-space libraries use mmap() syscall
for dynamic memory allocations.

Linus suggested to convert RLIMIT_DATA rlimit into something suitable
for anonymous memory accounting.  But in this patch we go further, and
the changes are bundled together as:

 * keep vma counting if CONFIG_PROC_FS=n, will be used for limits
 * replace mm->shared_vm with better defined mm->data_vm
 * account anonymous executable areas as executable
 * account file-backed growsdown/up areas as stack
 * drop struct file* argument from vm_stat_account
 * enforce RLIMIT_DATA for size of data areas

This way code looks cleaner: now code/stack/data classification depends
only on vm_flags state:

 VM_EXEC & ~VM_WRITE            -> code  (VmExe + VmLib in proc)
 VM_GROWSUP | VM_GROWSDOWN      -> stack (VmStk)
 VM_WRITE & ~VM_SHARED & !stack -> data  (VmData)

The rest (VmSize - VmData - VmStk - VmExe - VmLib) could be called
"shared", but that might be strange beast like readonly-private or VM_IO
area.

 - RLIMIT_AS            limits whole address space "VmSize"
 - RLIMIT_STACK         limits stack "VmStk" (but each vma individually)
 - RLIMIT_DATA          now limits "VmData"
