net: mvneta: Fix the CPU choice in mvneta_percpu_elect

When passing to the management of multiple RX queue, the
mvneta_percpu_elect function was broken. The use of the modulo can lead
to elect the wrong cpu. For example with rxq_def=2, if the CPU 2 goes
offline and then online, we ended with the third RX queue activated in
the same time on CPU 0 and CPU2, which lead to a kernel crash.

With this fix, we don't try to get "the closer" CPU if the default CPU is
gone, now we just use CPU 0 which always be there. Thanks to this, the
code becomes more readable, easier to maintain and more predicable.
