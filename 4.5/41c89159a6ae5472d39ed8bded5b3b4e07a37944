mmc: pxamci: fix again read-only gpio detection polarity

The commit fixing the conversion of pxamci to slot-gpio API fixed the
inverted the logic of the read-only gpio. Unfortunately, the commit was
tested on a non-inverted gpio, and not on the inverted one. And the fix
did work partially, by luck.

This is the remaining missing part of the fix, trivial but still necessary.
