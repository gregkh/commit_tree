cpufreq: intel_pstate: Configurable algorithm to get target pstate

Target systems using different cpus have different power and performance
requirements. They may use different algorithms to get the next P-state
based on their power or performance preference.

For example, power-constrained systems may not want to use
high-performance P-states as aggressively as a full-size desktop or a
server platform. A server platform may want to run close to the max to
achieve better performance, while laptop-like systems may prefer
sacrificing performance for longer battery lifes.

For the above reasons, modify intel_pstate to allow the target P-state
selection algorithm to be depend on the CPU ID.
