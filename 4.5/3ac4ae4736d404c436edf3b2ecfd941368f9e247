serial:bfin-uart:Remove 'struct timeval'

The bfin-uart code uses real time with struct timeval. This will
cause problems on 32-bit architectures in 2038 when time_t
overflows.
Since the code just needs delta value of time, it is not
necessary to record them in real time.
This patch changes the code to use the monotonic time instead,
replaces struct timeval and do_gettimeofday() with u64 and
ktime_get_ns().
