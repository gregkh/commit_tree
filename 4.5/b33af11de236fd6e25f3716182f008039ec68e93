i2c: designware: Do not require clock when SSCN and FFCN are provided

The current driver uses input clock source frequency to calculate
values for [SS|FS]_[HC|LC] registers. However, when booting ACPI, we do not
currently have a good way to provide the frequency information.
Instead, we can leverage the SSCN and FFCN ACPI methods, which can be used
to directly provide these values. So, the clock information should
no longer be required during probing.

However, since clk can be invalid, additional checks must be done where
we are making use of it.
