ARM: sunxi: Clean up sunxi_defconfig

Clean up sunxi_defconfig by generating a fresh file via
  make sunxi_defconfig
  make savedefconfig

While this moves around a few lines and removes unnecessary symbols,
it doesn't introduce any functional changes. The resulting .config is
identical before and after this patch.
