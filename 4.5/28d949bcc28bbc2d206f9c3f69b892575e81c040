xen/blkfront: negotiate number of queues/rings to be used with backend

The max number of hardware queues for xen/blkfront is set by parameter
'max_queues'(default 4), while it is also capped by the max value that the
xen/blkback exposes through XenStore key 'multi-queue-max-queues'.

The negotiated number is the smaller one and would be written back to xenstore
as "multi-queue-num-queues", blkback needs to read this negotiated number.
