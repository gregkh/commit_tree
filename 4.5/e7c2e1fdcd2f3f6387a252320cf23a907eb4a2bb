iwlwifi: mvm: Enable MPLUT only on supported hw

When there's a bt-wifi contention that requires arbitration,
we use a priority-based mechanism to decide which comm wins.
Over time, use cases become more and more complex, with multiple
concurrent active links with different traffic types and different QoS
requirements, on both WiFi and BT sides.
This, in turn, requires us to elaborate our prioritization mechanism.
However, our legacy products included hw that does not supports this,
so selectively enable this on specific hw - as signaled by the firmware.
