pinctrl: ssbi-gpio: Be sure to clamp return value

As we want gpio_chip .get() calls to be able to return negative
error codes and propagate to drivers, we need to go over all
drivers and make sure their return values are clamped to [0,1].
We do this by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

Also, this code was double-inverting a bool. That makes no
sense whatsoever, so I removed the double-invert.
