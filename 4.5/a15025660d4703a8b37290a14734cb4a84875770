Drivers: hv: utils: introduce HVUTIL_TRANSPORT_DESTROY mode

When Hyper-V host asks us to remove some util driver by closing the
appropriate channel there is no easy way to force the current file
descriptor holder to hang up but we can start to respond -EBADF to all
operations asking it to exit gracefully.

As we're setting hvt->mode from two separate contexts now we need to use
a proper locking.
