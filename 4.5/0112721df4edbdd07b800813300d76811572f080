IMA: policy can be updated zero times

Commit "IMA: policy can now be updated multiple times" assumed that the
policy would be updated at least once.

If there are zero updates, the temporary list head object will get added
to the policy list, and later dereferenced as an IMA policy object, which
means that invalid memory will be accessed.

Changelog:
- Move list_empty() test to ima_release_policy(), before audit msg - Mimi
