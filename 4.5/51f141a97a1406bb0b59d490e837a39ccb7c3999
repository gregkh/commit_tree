usb: renesas_usbhs: Modify pipe configuration

The current code has info->bufnmb_last to calculate the BUFNMB bits of
PIPEBUF register. However, since the bufnmb_last is initialized in
the usbhs_pipe_init() only, this driver is possible to set unexpected
value to the register if usb_ep_{enable,disable}() are called many times.

So, this patch modifies the pipe configuration via struct
renesas_usbhs_driver_param to simplify the code. Also this patch changes:
 - a double buffer configuration
 - isochronous buffer size from 512 to 1024
