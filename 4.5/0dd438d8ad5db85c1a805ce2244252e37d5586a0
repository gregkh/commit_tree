i40evf: allocate ring structs dynamically

Instead of awkwardly keeping a fixed array of pointers in the adapter
struct and then allocating ring structs individually, just keep a single
pointer and allocate a single blob for the arrays. This simplifies code,
shrinks the adapter structure, and future-proofs the driver by not
limiting the number of rings we can handle.
