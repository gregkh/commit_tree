s390/irqflags: optimize irq restore

The ssm instruction takes longer that stnsm/stosm as it is often
used to modify DAT and PER. We know that irqsave/irqrestore only
deals with external and I/O interrupts and we know that irqrestore
can transition only from disabled->disabled or disabled->enabled,
so we can use the faster stosm.
