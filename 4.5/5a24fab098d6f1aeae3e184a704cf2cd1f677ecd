drm/i915: Ensure the HW is powered during HW access in assert_pipe

The assumption when adding the intel_display_power_is_enabled() checks
was that if it returns success the power can't be turned off afterwards
during the HW access, which is guaranteed by modeset locks. This isn't
always true, so make sure we hold a dedicated reference for the time of
the access.
