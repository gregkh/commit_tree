[media] v4l2-device: Register entity before calling subdev's registered ops

Registering a V4L2 sub-device includes, among other things, registering
the related media entity and calling the sub-device's registered op. Since
patch "media: convert links from array to list", creating a link between
two pads requires registering the entity first. If the registered() op
involves link creation, the link list head will not be initialised before
it is used.

Resolve this by first registering the entity, then calling its
registered() op.
