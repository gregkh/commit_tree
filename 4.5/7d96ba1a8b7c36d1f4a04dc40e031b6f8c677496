i40evf: allocate queue vectors dynamically

Change the queue_vector array from a statically-sized member of the
adapter structure to a dynamically-allocated and -sized array.

This reduces the size of the adapter structure, and allows us to support
any number of queue vectors in the future without changing the code.
