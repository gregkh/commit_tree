drm/amd/display: Respect aux return values

[Why]
The new aux implementation was not up to spec. This caused us to fail DP
compliance as well as introduced serious delays during system resume.

[How]
Make dce_aux_transfer_raw return the operation result

Make dce_aux_transfer_with_retries delay with udelay instead
of msleep, and only on invalid reply.  Also fail on the second
invalid reply, third timeout, or first of any other error

Convert return values to drm error codes in amdgpu_dm

As the two aux transfer functions are now noticeably
different, change the names to better reflect their
functionality and document.

There was one last call to dc_link_aux_transfer that
should have retries, fix that
