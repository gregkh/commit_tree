afs: Fix afs_xattr_get_yfs() to not try freeing an error value

afs_xattr_get_yfs() tries to free yacl, which may hold an error value (say
if yfs_fs_fetch_opaque_acl() failed and returned an error).

Fix this by allocating yacl up front (since it's a fixed-length struct,
unlike afs_acl) and passing it in to the RPC function.  This also allows
the flags to be placed in the object rather than passing them through to
the RPC function.
