i2c: at91: split driver into core and master file

The single file i2c-at91.c has been split into core code (i2c-at91-core.c)
and master mode specific code (i2c-at91-master.c). This should enhance
maintainability and reduce ifdeffery for slave mode related code.

The code itself hasn't been touched. Shared functions only had to be made
non-static. Furthermore, includes have been cleaned up.
