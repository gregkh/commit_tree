binder: check for overflow when alloc for security context

When allocating space in the target buffer for the security context,
make sure the extra_buffers_size doesn't overflow. This can only
happen if the given size is invalid, but an overflow can turn it
into a valid size. Fail the transaction if an overflow is detected.
