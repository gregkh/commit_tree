drm/i915: fix i9xx irq enable/disable

Those functions are used on gen4 as well and gen4 does have a non-RCS
engine, so remove the BUG_ON and flip back the logic to what it was
before the ENGINE_READ/WRITE update

v2: update the posting read as well (Chris, Ville).

Fixes: baba6e572b38 ("drm/i915: take a reference to uncore in the engine and use it")
