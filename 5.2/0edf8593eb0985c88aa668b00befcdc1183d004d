crypto: cavium - remove bogus code handling cryptd

The cavium crypto driver adds 'sizeof(struct ablkcipher_request)' to its
request size because "the cryptd daemon uses this memory for request_ctx
information".  This is incorrect and unnecessary; cryptd doesn't require
wrapped algorithms to reserve extra request space.  So remove this.

Also remove the unneeded memset() of the tfm context to 0.
It's already zeroed on allocation.
