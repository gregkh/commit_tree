HID: logitech-hidpp: do not make failure to get the name fatal

With devices attached to a non-unifying 2.4GHz receiver we sometimes fail
to get the name. This is not a fatal error, we can just continue with the
original name.

So instead of bailing out, continue with battery-initialization when this
happens. This fixes the battery not getting registered when we fail to
get the name.
