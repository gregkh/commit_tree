uapi/habanalabs: add missing fields in bmon params

This patch adds missing fields of start address 0 and 1 in the bmon
parameter structure that is received from the user in the debug IOCTL.

Without these fields, the functionality of the bmon trace is broken,
because there is no configuration of the base address of the filter of the
bus monitor.
