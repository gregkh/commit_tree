swiotlb-xen: simplify the DMA sync method implementations

Get rid of the grand multiplexer and implement the sync_single_for_cpu
and sync_single_for_device methods directly, and then loop over them
for the scatterlist based variants.

Note that this also loses a few comments related to highlevel DMA API
concepts, which have nothing to do with the swiotlb-xen implementation
details.
