locks: move checks from locks_free_lock() to locks_release_private()

Code that allocates locks using locks_alloc_lock() will free it
using locks_free_lock(), and will benefit from the BUG_ON()
consistency checks therein.

However some code (nfsd and lockd) allocate a lock embedded in
some other data structure, and so free the lock themselves after
calling locks_release_private().  This path does not benefit from
the consistency checks.

To help catch future errors, move the BUG_ON() checks to
locks_release_private() - which locks_free_lock() already calls.
This ensures that all users for locks will find out if the lock
isn't detached properly before being free.
