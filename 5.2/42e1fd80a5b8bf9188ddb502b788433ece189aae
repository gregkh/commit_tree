perf record: Implement COMPRESSED event record and its attributes

Implemented PERF_RECORD_COMPRESSED event, related data types, header
feature and functions to write, read and print feature attributes from
the trace header section.

comp_mmap_len preserves the size of mmaped kernel buffer that was used
during collection. comp_mmap_len size is used on loading stage as the
size of decomp buffer for decompression of COMPRESSED events content.

Committer notes:

Fixed up conflict with BPF_PROG_INFO and BTF_BTF header features.
