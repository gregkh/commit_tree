ipv4: Flag fib_info with a fib_nh using IPv6 gateway

Until support is added to the offload drivers, they need to be able to
reject routes with an IPv6 gateway. To that end add a flag to fib_info
that indicates if any fib_nh has a v6 gateway. The flag allows the drivers
to efficiently know the use of a v6 gateway without walking all fib_nh
tied to a fib_info each time a route is added.

Update mlxsw and rocker to reject the routes with extack message as to why.
