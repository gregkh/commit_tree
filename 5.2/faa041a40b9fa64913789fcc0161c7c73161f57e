ipv4: Create cleanup helper for fib_nh

Move the fib_nh cleanup code from free_fib_info_rcu into a new helper,
fib_nh_release. Move classid accounting into fib_nh_release which is
called per fib_nh to make accounting symmetrical with fib_nh_init.
Export the helper to allow for use with nexthop objects in the
future.
