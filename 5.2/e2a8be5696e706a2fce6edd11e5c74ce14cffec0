scsi: lpfc: resolve lockdep warnings

There were a number of erroneous comments and incorrect older lockdep
checks that were causing a number of warnings.

Resolve the following:

 - Inconsistent lock state warnings in lpfc_nvme_info_show().

 - Fixed comments and code on sequences where ring lock is now held instead
   of hbalock.

 - Reworked calling sequences around lpfc_sli_iocbq_lookup(). Rather than
   locking prior to the routine and have routine guess on what lock, take
   the lock within the routine. The lockdep check becomes unnecessary.

 - Fixed comments and removed erroneous hbalock checks.
