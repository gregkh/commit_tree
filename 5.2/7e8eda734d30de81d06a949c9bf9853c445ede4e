ntp: Audit NTP parameters adjustment

Emit an audit record every time selected NTP parameters are modified
from userspace (via adjtimex(2) or clock_adjtime(2)). These parameters
may be used to indirectly change system clock, and thus their
modifications should be audited.

Such events will now generate records of type AUDIT_TIME_ADJNTPVAL
containing the following fields:
  - op -- which value was adjusted:
    - offset -- corresponding to the time_offset variable
    - freq   -- corresponding to the time_freq variable
    - status -- corresponding to the time_status variable
    - adjust -- corresponding to the time_adjust variable
    - tick   -- corresponding to the tick_usec variable
    - tai    -- corresponding to the timekeeping's TAI offset
  - old -- the old value
  - new -- the new value

Example records:

type=TIME_ADJNTPVAL msg=audit(1530616044.507:7): op=status old=64 new=8256
type=TIME_ADJNTPVAL msg=audit(1530616044.511:11): op=freq old=0 new=49180377088000

The records of this type will be associated with the corresponding
syscall records.

An overview of parameter changes that can be done via do_adjtimex()
(based on information from Miroslav Lichvar) and whether they are
audited:
  __timekeeping_set_tai_offset() -- sets the offset from the
                                    International Atomic Time
                                    (AUDITED)
  NTP variables:
    time_offset -- can adjust the clock by up to 0.5 seconds per call
                   and also speed it up or slow down by up to about
                   0.05% (43 seconds per day) (AUDITED)
    time_freq -- can speed up or slow down by up to about 0.05%
                 (AUDITED)
    time_status -- can insert/delete leap seconds and it also enables/
                   disables synchronization of the hardware real-time
                   clock (AUDITED)
    time_maxerror, time_esterror -- change error estimates used to
                                    inform userspace applications
                                    (NOT AUDITED)
    time_constant -- controls the speed of the clock adjustments that
                     are made when time_offset is set (NOT AUDITED)
    time_adjust -- can temporarily speed up or slow down the clock by up
                   to 0.05% (AUDITED)
    tick_usec -- a more extreme version of time_freq; can speed up or
                 slow down the clock by up to 10% (AUDITED)
