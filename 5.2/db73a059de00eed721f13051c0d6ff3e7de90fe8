intel_th: Rework resource passing between glue layers and core

Currently, MMIO resource numbers in the TH driver core correspond to
PCI BAR numbers, because in the beginning there was only the PCI glue
layer. This created some confusion when the ACPI glue layer was added.

To avoid confusion and remove glue-specific code from the driver core,
split the resource indices between core and glue layers and change the
API so that the driver core receives the MMIO resources in the same
fixed order. At the same time, make the IRQ always be a parameter to
intel_th_alloc() instead of sometimes passing it as a resource.
