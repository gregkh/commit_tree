mm, compaction: some tracepoints should be defined only when CONFIG_COMPACTION is set

Only mm_compaction_isolate_{free, migrate}pages may be used when
CONFIG_COMPACTION is not set.  All others are used only when
CONFIG_COMPACTION is set.

After this change, if CONFIG_COMPACTION is not set, the tracepoints that
only work when CONFIG_COMPACTION is set will not be exposed to userspace.
Without this change, they will always be exposed in debugfs whether
CONFIG_COMPACTION is set or not.  This is an improvement.
