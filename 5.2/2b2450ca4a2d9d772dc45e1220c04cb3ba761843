ipv6: Move gateway checks to a fib6_nh setting

The gateway setting is not per fib6_info entry but per-fib6_nh. Add a new
fib_nh_has_gw flag to fib6_nh and convert references to RTF_GATEWAY to
the new flag. For IPv6 address the flag is cheaper than checking that
nh_gw is non-0 like IPv4 does.

While this increases fib6_nh by 8-bytes, the effective allocation size of
a fib6_info is unchanged. The 8 bytes is recovered later with a
fib_nh_common change.
