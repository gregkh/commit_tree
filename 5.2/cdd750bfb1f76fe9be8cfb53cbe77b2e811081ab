kbuild: remove 'addtree' and 'flags' magic for header search paths

The 'addtree' and 'flags' in scripts/Kbuild.include are so compilecated
and ugly.

As I mentioned in [1], Kbuild should stop automatic prefixing of header
search path options.

I fixed up (almost) all Makefiles in the kernel. Now 'addtree' and
'flags' have been removed.

Kbuild still caters to add $(srctree)/$(src) and $(objtree)/$(obj)
to the header search path for O= building, but never touches extra
compiler options from ccflags-y etc.
