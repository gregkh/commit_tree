ASoC: rt5677-spi: Handle over reading when flipping bytes

There is a case when a we want to read a large number of bytes that
require a burst but is not a multiple of the word size (8). When this
happens rt5677_spi_reverse will run off the end of the buffer. The
solution is to tell spi_reverse the actual size of the destination and
stop if we reach it even if we have data left that we read.
