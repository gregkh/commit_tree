intel_th: Communicate IRQ via resource

Currently, the IRQ is passed between the glue layers and the core as a
separate argument, while the MMIO resources are passed as resources.
This also limits the number of IRQs thus used to one, while the current
versions of Intel TH use a different MSI vector for each interrupt
triggering event, of which there are 7.

Change this to pass IRQ in the resources array.
