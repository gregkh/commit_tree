staging: comedi: Add lockdep_assert_held() calls for dev->mutex

Lots of functions in the core comedi module expect the mutex in `struct
comedi_device` to be held, so add calls to `lockdep_assert_held()` to
check and document that.  An unusual case is the calls to
`lockdep_assert_held()` after successful return from
`comedi_alloc_board_minor()` which allocates a `struct comedi_device`
and returns with its mutex locked.
