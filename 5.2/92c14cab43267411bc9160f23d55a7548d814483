percpu: convert chunk hints to be based on pcpu_block_md

As mentioned in the last patch, a chunk's hints are no different than a
block just responsible for more bits. This converts chunk level hints to
use a pcpu_block_md to maintain them. This lets us reuse the same hint
helper functions as a block. The left_free and right_free are unused by
the chunk's pcpu_block_md.
