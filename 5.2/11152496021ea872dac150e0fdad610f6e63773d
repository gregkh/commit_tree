staging: erofs: fix error handling when failed to read compresssed data

Complete read error handling paths for all three kinds of
compressed pages:

 1) For cache-managed pages, PG_uptodate will be checked since
    read_endio will unlock and SetPageUptodate for these pages;

 2) For inplaced pages, read_endio cannot SetPageUptodate directly
    since it should be used to mark the final decompressed data,
    PG_error will be set with page locked for IO error instead;

 3) For staging pages, PG_error is used, which is similar to
    what we do for inplaced pages.
