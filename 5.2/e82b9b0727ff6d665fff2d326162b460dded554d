vhost: introduce vhost_exceeds_weight()

We used to have vhost_exceeds_weight() for vhost-net to:

- prevent vhost kthread from hogging the cpu
- balance the time spent between TX and RX

This function could be useful for vsock and scsi as well. So move it
to vhost.c. Device must specify a weight which counts the number of
requests, or it can also specific a byte_weight which counts the
number of bytes that has been processed.
