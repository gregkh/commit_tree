f2fs: Reduce zoned block device memory usage

For zoned block devices, an array of zone types for each device is
allocated and initialized in order to determine if a section is stored
on a sequential zone (zone reset needed) or a conventional zone (no
zone reset needed and regular discard applies). Considering this usage,
the zone types stored in memory can be replaced with a bitmap to
indicate an equivalent information, that is, if a zone is sequential or
not. This reduces the memory usage for each zoned device by roughly 8:
on a 14TB disk with zones of 256 MB, the zone type array consumes
13x4KB pages while the bitmap uses only 2x4KB pages.

This patch changes the f2fs_dev_info structure blkz_type field to the
bitmap blkz_seq. Access to this bitmap is done using the helper
function f2fs_blkz_is_seq(), which is a rewrite of the function
get_blkz_type().
