ASoC: wm_adsp: Add HALO MPU fault logging

A Halo Core DSP has a memory protection unit that can trap and signal
memory access faults. This patch adds a function that dumps the fault
information.

The interrupt reaches the host via the parent codec interrupt controller
so this fault function is exported to be called by the codec driver.
