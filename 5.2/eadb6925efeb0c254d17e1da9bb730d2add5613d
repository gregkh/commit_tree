mips: Discard post-CMA-init foreach loop

Really the loop is pointless, since it walks over memblock-reserved
memory regions and mark them as reserved in memblock. Before
bootmem was removed from the kernel, this loop had been
used to map the memory reserved by CMA into the legacy bootmem
allocator. But now the early memory allocator is memblock,
which is used by CMA for reservation, so we don't need any mapping
anymore.
