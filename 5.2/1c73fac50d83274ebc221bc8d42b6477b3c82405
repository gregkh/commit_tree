irqchip/gic-v3-its: Drop redundant initialization in mk_lpi_range

There's no reason to ask kmalloc() to zero the allocation, since all
the fields get initialized immediately afterwards. Except that there's
also not any reason to initialize the ->entry member, since the
element gets added to the lpi_range_list immediately.
