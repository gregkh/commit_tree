KVM: arm64: Factor out core register ID enumeration

In preparation for adding logic to filter out some KVM_REG_ARM_CORE
registers from the KVM_GET_REG_LIST output, this patch factors out
the core register enumeration into a separate function and rebuilds
num_core_regs() on top of it.

This may be a little more expensive (depending on how good a job
the compiler does of specialising the code), but KVM_GET_REG_LIST
is not a hot path.

This will make it easier to consolidate ID filtering code in one
place.

No functional change.
