ceph: simplify arguments and return semantics of try_get_cap_refs

The return of this function is rather complex. It can return 0 or 1,
and in the case of a 1 return, the "err" pointer will be filled out.
This necessitates a lot of copying of values.

We can achieve the same effect by just returning 0, 1 or a negative
error code, and drop the "err" argument from this function.
