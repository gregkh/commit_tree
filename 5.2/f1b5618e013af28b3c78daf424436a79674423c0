vfs: Add a sample program for the new mount API

Add a sample program to demonstrate fsopen/fsmount/move_mount to mount
something.

To make it compile on all arches, irrespective of whether or not syscall
numbers are assigned, define the syscall number to -1 if it isn't to cause
the kernel to return -ENOSYS.
