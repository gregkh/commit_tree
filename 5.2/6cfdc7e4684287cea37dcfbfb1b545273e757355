IB/mlx5: Restrict 'DELAY_DROP_TIMEOUT' subtype to Ethernet interfaces

Subtype 'DELAY_DROP_TIMEOUT' (under 'GENERAL' event) is restricted to
Ethernet interfaces. This patch doesn't change functionality or breaks
current flow. In the downstream patch, non Ethernet (like IB) interfaces
will receive 'GENERAL' event.
