net: macb: save/restore the remaining registers and features

SAMA5D2 SoC has a suspend mode where SoC's power is cut off. Due to this
the registers content is lost after a suspend/resume cycle. The current
suspend/resume implementation covers some of these registers. However
there are few which were not treated (e.g. SCRT2 and USRIO). Apart
from this, netdev features are not restored. Treat these issues.
