btrfs: tree-checker: Remove comprehensive root owner check

Commit 1ba98d086fe3 ("Btrfs: detect corruption when non-root leaf has
zero item") introduced comprehensive root owner checker.

However it's pretty expensive tree search to locate the owner root,
especially when it get reused by mandatory read and write time
tree-checker.

This patch will remove that check, and completely rely on owner based
empty leaf check, which is much faster and still works fine for most
case.

And since we skip the old root owner check, now write time tree check
can be merged with btrfs_check_leaf_full().
