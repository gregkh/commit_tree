ipv4: Allow ipv6 gateway with ipv4 routes

Add support for RTA_VIA and allow an IPv6 nexthop for v4 routes:
   $ ip ro add 172.16.1.0/24 via inet6 2001:db8::1 dev eth0
   $ ip ro ls
   ...
   172.16.1.0/24 via inet6 2001:db8::1 dev eth0

For convenience and simplicity, userspace can use RTA_VIA to specify
AF_INET or AF_INET6 gateway.

The common fib_nexthop_info dump function compares the gateway address
family to the nh_common family to know if the gateway should be encoded
as RTA_VIA or RTA_GATEWAY.
