s390/unwind: introduce stack unwind API

Rework the dump_trace() stack unwinder interface to support different
unwinding algorithms. The new interface looks like this:

	struct unwind_state state;
	unwind_for_each_frame(&state, task, regs, start_stack)
		do_something(state.sp, state.ip, state.reliable);

The unwind_bc.c file contains the implementation for the classic
back-chain unwinder.

One positive side effect of the new code is it now handles ftraced
functions gracefully. It prints the real name of the return function
instead of 'return_to_handler'.
