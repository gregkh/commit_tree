mfd: da9063: Fix OTP control register names to match datasheets for DA9063/63L

Mismatch between what is found in the Datasheets for DA9063 and DA9063L
provided by Dialog Semiconductor, and the register names provided in the
MFD registers file. The changes are for the OTP (one-time-programming)
control registers. The two naming errors are OPT instead of OTP, and
COUNT instead of CONT (i.e. control).
