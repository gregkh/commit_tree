kernel/sys.c: prctl: fix false positive in validate_prctl_map()

While validating new map we require the @start_data to be strictly less
than @end_data, which is fine for regular applications (this is why this
nit didn't trigger for that long).  These members are set from executable
loaders such as elf handers, still it is pretty valid to have a loadable
data section with zero size in file, in such case the start_data is equal
to end_data once kernel loader finishes.

As a result when we're trying to restore such programs the procedure fails
and the kernel returns -EINVAL.  From the image dump of a program:

 | "mm_start_code": "0x400000",
 | "mm_end_code": "0x8f5fb4",
 | "mm_start_data": "0xf1bfb0",
 | "mm_end_data": "0xf1bfb0",

Thus we need to change validate_prctl_map from strictly less to less or
equal operator use.
