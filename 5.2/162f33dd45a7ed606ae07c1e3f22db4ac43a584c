Move EM_ARCOMPACT and EM_ARCV2 to uapi/linux/elf-em.h

These should never have been defined in the arch tree to begin with, and
now uapi/linux/audit.h header is going to use EM_ARCOMPACT and EM_ARCV2
in order to define AUDIT_ARCH_ARCOMPACT and AUDIT_ARCH_ARCV2 which are
needed to implement syscall_get_arch() which in turn is required to
extend the generic ptrace API with PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO request.
