arm64: dts: ls1028a: Fix CPU idle fail.

PSCI spec define 1st parameter's bit 16 of function CPU_SUSPEND to
indicate CPU State Type: 0 for standby, 1 for power down. In this
case, we want to select standby for CPU idle feature. But current
setting wrongly select power down and cause CPU SUSPEND fail every
time. Need this fix.
