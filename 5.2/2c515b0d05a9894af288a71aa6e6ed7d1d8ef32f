ARM: sunxi: Fix the USB PHY ID detect GPIO properties

While the USB PHY Device Tree mandates that the name of the ID detect pin
should be usb0_id_det-gpios, a significant number of device tree use
usb0_id_det-gpio instead.

This was functional because the GPIO framework falls back to the gpio
suffix that is legacy, but we should fix this.
