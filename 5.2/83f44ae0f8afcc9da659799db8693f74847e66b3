perf/x86: Always store regs->ip in perf_callchain_kernel()

The stacktrace_map_raw_tp BPF selftest is failing because the RIP saved by
perf_arch_fetch_caller_regs() isn't getting saved by perf_callchain_kernel().

This was broken by the following commit:

  d15d356887e7 ("perf/x86: Make perf callchains work without CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER")

With that change, when starting with non-HW regs, the unwinder starts
with the current stack frame and unwinds until it passes up the frame
which called perf_arch_fetch_caller_regs().  So regs->ip needs to be
saved deliberately.
