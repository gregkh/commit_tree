ftrace/x86: Add a comment to why we take text_mutex in ftrace_arch_code_modify_prepare()

Taking the text_mutex in ftrace_arch_code_modify_prepare() is to fix a
race against module loading and live kernel patching that might try to
change the text permissions while ftrace has it as read/write. This
really needs to be documented in the code. Add a comment that does such.
