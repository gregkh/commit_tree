lightnvm: pblk: IO path reorganization

This patch is made in order to prepare read path for new approach to
partial read handling, which is simpler in compare with previous one.

The most important change is to move the handling of completed and
failed bio from the pblk_make_rq() to particular read and write
functions. This is needed, since after partial read path changes,
sometimes completed/failed bio will be different from original one, so
we cannot do this any longer in pblk_make_rq().

Other changes are small read path refactor in order to reduce the size
of the following patch with partial read changes.

Generally the goal of this patch is not to change the functionality,
but just to prepare the code for the following changes.
