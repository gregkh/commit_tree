btrfs: prop: open code btrfs_set_prop in inherit_prop

When an inode inherits property from its parent, we call btrfs_set_prop().
btrfs_set_prop() does an elaborate checks, which is not required in the
context of inheriting a property. Instead just open-code only the required
items from btrfs_set_prop() and then call btrfs_setxattr() directly. So
now the only user of btrfs_set_prop() is gone, (except for the wraper
function btrfs_set_prop_trans()).
