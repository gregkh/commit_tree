mips: vdso: drop unnecessary cc-ldoption

Towards the goal of removing cc-ldoption, it seems that --hash-style=
was added to binutils 2.17.50.0.2 in 2006. The minimal required version
of binutils for the kernel according to
Documentation/process/changes.rst is 2.20.

--build-id was added in 2.18 according to binutils-gdb/ld/NEWS.
