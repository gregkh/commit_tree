drm/i915: Fix pipe_bpp readout for BXT/GLK DSI

The only bpc information in pipe registers for BXT/GLK DSI
is the PIPEMISC dither bpc. Let's try to use that to read
out pipe_bpp on these platforms. However, I'm not sure if
this will be correctly populated by the GOP since bspec
suggests it's only needed if dithering is actually enabled.
If not I guess we'll have to go one step further and
extract pipe_bpp from the DSI pixel format when dithering
is disabled.
