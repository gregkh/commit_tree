vt: selection: allow functions to be called from inside kernel

This patch breaks set_selection() into two functions so that when
called from kernel, copy_from_user() can be avoided. The two functions
are called set_selection_user() and set_selection_kernel() in order to
be explicit about their purposes. This also means updating any
references to set_selection() and fixing for name change. It also
exports set_selection_kernel() and paste_selection().

These changes are used the following patch where speakup's selection
functionality calls into the above functions, thereby doing away with
parallel implementation.
