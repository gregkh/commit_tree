platform/x86: pmc_atom: Add several Beckhoff Automation boards to critclk_systems DMI table

There are several Beckhoff Automation industrial PC boards which use
pmc_plt_clk* clocks for ethernet controllers. This adds affected boards
to critclk_systems DMI table so the clocks are marked as CLK_CRITICAL and
not turned off.
