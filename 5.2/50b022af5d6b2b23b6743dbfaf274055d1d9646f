drm/i915: Force GPU idle on suspend

To facilitate the next patch to allow preemptible kernels not to incur
the wrath of hangcheck, we need to ensure that we can still suspend and
shutdown. That is we will not be able to rely on hangcheck to terminate
a blocking kernel and instead must manually do so ourselves. The
advantage is that we can apply more pressure!

As we now perform a GPU reset to clean up any residual kernels, we leave
the GPU in an unknown state and in particular can not talk to the GuC
before we reinitialise it following resume. For example, we no longer
need to tell the GuC to suspend itself, as it is already reset.
