fuse: convert printk -> pr_*

Functions, like pr_err, are a more modern variant of printing compared to
printk. They could be used to denoise sources by using needed level in
the print function name, and by automatically inserting per-driver /
function / ... print prefix as defined by pr_fmt macro. pr_* are also
said to be used in Documentation/process/coding-style.rst and more
recent code - for example overlayfs - uses them instead of printk.

Convert CUSE and FUSE to use the new pr_* functions.

CUSE output stays completely unchanged, while FUSE output is amended a
bit for "trying to steal weird page" warning - the second line now comes
also with "fuse:" prefix. I hope it is ok.
