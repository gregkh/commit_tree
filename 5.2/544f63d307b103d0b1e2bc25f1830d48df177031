ice: Reset all VFs with VFLR during SR-IOV init flow

During SR-IOV initialization, we allocate and setup VFs with reset, and
since we were going to inform Firmware about our intention to do VFLR by
disabling LAN TX Queue, then we really have to complete VF reset flow with
VFLR using appropriate registers - Otherwise, reset status bit for VF in
the Guest OS might returns DEADBEEF.
This resolves issue to properly initialize VFs in the Guest OS via PCI
passthrough.
