drm/i915: Stop storing the context name as the timeline name

The timeline->name is only used for convenience in pretty printing the
i915_request.fence->ops->get_timeline_name() and it is just as
convenient to pull it from the gem_context directly. The few instances
of its use inside GEM_TRACE() has proven more of a nuisance than
helpful, so not worth saving imo.
