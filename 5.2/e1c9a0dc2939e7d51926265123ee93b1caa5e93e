RDMA/hns: Dump detailed driver-specific CQ

This patch adds support of resource track for hip08 and take dumping cq
context state used for debugging as an example.  More resources track
supports for hns driver will be added in future.

The output should be as follows.
$ rdma res show cq dev hnseth0 -d
dev hnseth0 cqe 1023 users 2 poll-ctx WORKQUEUE pid 0 comm [ib_core] drv_state 2 drv_ceq
n 0 drv_cqn 0 drv_hopnum 1 drv_pi 0 drv_ci 0 drv_coalesce 0 drv_period 0 drv_cnt 0
