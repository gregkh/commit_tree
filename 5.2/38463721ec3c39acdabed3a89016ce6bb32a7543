hwmon: (pmbus/core) mutex_lock write in pmbus_set_samples

update_lock is a mutex intended to protect write operations. It was not
taken, however, when _pmbus_write_word_data is called from
pmbus_set_samples() function which may cause problems especially when
some PMBUS_VIRT_* operation is implemented as a read-modify-write cycle.

This patch makes sure the lock is held during the operation.
