do_move_mount(): fix an unsafe use of is_anon_ns()

What triggers it is a race between mount --move and umount -l
of the source; we should reject it (the source is parentless *and*
not the root of anon namespace at that), but the check for namespace
being an anon one is broken in that case - is_anon_ns() needs
ns to be non-NULL.  Better fixed here than in is_anon_ns(), since
the rest of the callers is guaranteed to get a non-NULL argument...
