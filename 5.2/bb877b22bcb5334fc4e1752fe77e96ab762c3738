ice: Don't remove VLAN filters that were never programmed

In case of non-trusted VFs, it is possible to program VLAN filter far
less than what is requested by the VF originally, thereby makes number of
VLAN elements being tracked by VF different from actual VLAN tags. This
patch makes sure that we are not attempting to remove VLAN filter that
does not exist.
