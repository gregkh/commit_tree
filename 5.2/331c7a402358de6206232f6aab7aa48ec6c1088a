ipv4: Move IN_DEV_IGNORE_ROUTES_WITH_LINKDOWN to helper

in_dev lookup followed by IN_DEV_IGNORE_ROUTES_WITH_LINKDOWN check
is called in several places, some with the rcu lock and others with the
rtnl held.

Move the check to a helper similar to what IPv6 has. Since the helper
can be invoked from either context use rcu_dereference_rtnl to
dereference ip_ptr.
