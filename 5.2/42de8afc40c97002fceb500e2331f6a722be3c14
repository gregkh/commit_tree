usb: dwc2: Use generic PHY width in params setup

Setting params.phy_utmi_width in dwc2_lowlevel_hw_init() is pointless since
it's value will be overwritten by dwc2_init_params().

This change make sure to take in account the generic PHY width information
during paraminitialisation, done in dwc2_set_param_phy_utmi_width().

By doing so, the phy_utmi_width params can still be overrided by
devicetree specific params and will also be checked against hardware
capabilities.
