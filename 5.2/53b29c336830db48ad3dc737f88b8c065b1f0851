swiotlb: save io_tlb_used to local variable before leaving critical section

When swiotlb is full, the kernel would print io_tlb_used. However, the
result might be inaccurate at that time because we have left the critical
section protected by spinlock.

Therefore, we backup the io_tlb_used into local variable before leaving
critical section.
