ice: Retrieve rx_buf in separate function

Introduce ice_get_rx_buf, which will fetch the Rx buffer and do the DMA
synchronization. Length of the packet that hardware Rx descriptor
contains is now read in ice_clean_rx_irq, so we can feed ice_get_rx_buf
with it and resign from rx_desc passed as argument in ice_fetch_rx_buf
and ice_add_rx_frag.
