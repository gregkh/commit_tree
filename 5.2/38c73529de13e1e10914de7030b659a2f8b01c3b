ipv4: Use return value of inet_iif() for __raw_v4_lookup in the while loop

In commit 19e4e768064a8 ("ipv4: Fix raw socket lookup for local
traffic"), the dif argument to __raw_v4_lookup() is coming from the
returned value of inet_iif() but the change was done only for the first
lookup. Subsequent lookups in the while loop still use skb->dev->ifIndex.
