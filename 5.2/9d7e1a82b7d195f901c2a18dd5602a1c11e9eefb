clk: mediatek: Add configurable pcwibits and fmin to mtk_pll_data

1. pcwibits: The integer bits of pcw for PLLs is extend to 8 bits,
   add a variable to indicate this change and
   backward-compatible.

2. fmin: The PLL frequency lower-bound is vary from 1GHz to
   1.5GHz, add a variable to indicate platform-dependent.
