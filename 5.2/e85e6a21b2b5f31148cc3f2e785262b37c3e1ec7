rcu: Unconditionally expedite during suspend/hibernate

The rcu_pm_notify() function refuses to switch to/from expedited grace
periods on systems with more than 256 CPUs due to the serialized
initialization of expedited grace periods.  However, expedited grace
periods are now initialized in parallel, removing this concern.
This commit therefore removes the checks from rcu_pm_notify(), so that
expedited grace periods are used unconditionally during suspend/resume
and hibernate/wake operations.

As always, real-time workloads wishing to completely avoid expedited
grace periods can use the rcupdate.rcu_normal= kernel parameter.
