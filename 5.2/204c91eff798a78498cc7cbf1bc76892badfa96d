KVM: selftests: do not blindly clobber registers in guest asm

The guest_code of sync_regs_test is assuming that the compiler will not
touch %r11 outside the asm that increments it, which is a bit brittle.
Instead, we can increment a variable and use a dummy asm to ensure the
increment is not optimized away.  However, we also need to use a
callee-save register or the compiler will insert a save/restore around
the vmexit, breaking the whole idea behind the test.

(Yes, "if it ain't broken...", but I would like the test to be clean
before it is copied into the upcoming s390 selftests).
