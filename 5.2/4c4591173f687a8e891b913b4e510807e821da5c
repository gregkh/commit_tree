Input: sun4i-a10-lradc-keys - add support for A83T

Allwinner A83T SoC has a low res adc like the one in Allwinner A10 SoC,
however, the A10 SoC's vref of lradc internally is divided by 2/3 and
the A83T SoC's vref of lradc internally is divided by 3/4, thus add
a hardware variant for it to be compatible with various devices.
