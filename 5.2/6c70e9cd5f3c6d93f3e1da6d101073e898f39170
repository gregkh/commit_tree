rcu: Fix nohz status in stall warning

The Documentation/RCU/stallwarn.txt file says that stall warnings
print "D" if dyntick-idle processing is enabled, but the code in
print_cpu_stall_fast_no_hz() prints "." instead.  This commit therefore
reverses the sense of the test to make the code match the documentation.
