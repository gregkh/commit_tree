regulator: tps65217: Simplify linear range for selector 25-52

The original code separates the selector 25-52 into 2 ranges on purpose
because DCDC1/DCDC3 only support up to 1.8V/1.5V in the old code.
Both DCDC1 and DCDC3 support up to 3.3V since commit b4c2e158a1e1
("regulator: tps65217: Allow DCDC1 and DCDC3 up to 3.3V"), so merge
25-30 and 31-52 ranges to one range.
