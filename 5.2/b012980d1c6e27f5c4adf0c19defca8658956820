riscv/mmiowb: Hook up mmwiob() implementation to asm-generic code

In a bid to kill off explicit mmiowb() usage in driver code, hook up
the asm-generic mmiowb() tracking code for riscv, so that an mmiowb()
is automatically issued from spin_unlock() if an I/O write was performed
in the critical section.
