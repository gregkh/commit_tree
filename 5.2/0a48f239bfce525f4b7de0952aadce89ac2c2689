watchdog: wdat_wdt: fix get_timeleft call for wdat_wdt

The get_timeleft call for wdat_wdt was using ACPI_WDAT_GET_COUNTDOWN
when running an action on the device, which would return the configured
countdown, instead of ACPI_WDAT_GET_CURRENT_COUNTDOWN, which returns the
time left before the watchdog will fire. This change corrects that.
