KVM: arm64: Add capability to advertise ptrauth for guest

This patch advertises the capability of two cpu feature called address
pointer authentication and generic pointer authentication. These
capabilities depend upon system support for pointer authentication and
VHE mode.

The current arm64 KVM partially implements pointer authentication and
support of address/generic authentication are tied together. However,
separate ABI requirements for both of them is added so that any future
isolated implementation will not require any ABI changes.
