s390/qeth: use callback to finalize cmd

To avoid concurrency issues, some parts of the cmd setup are delayed
until qeth_send_control_data() holds the IO channel's irq_pending
"lock". Rather than hard-coding those setup steps for each cmd type,
have the cmd provide a callback. This will make it easier to also issue
IDX commands via qeth_send_control_data().
