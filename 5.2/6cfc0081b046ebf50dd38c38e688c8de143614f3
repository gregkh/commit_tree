blk-mq: no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions

When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
never do something different based on this.

When all of these checks are cleaned up, lots of the functions used in
the blk-mq-debugfs code can now return void, as no need to check the
return value of them either.

Overall, this ends up cleaning up the code and making it smaller, always
a nice win.
