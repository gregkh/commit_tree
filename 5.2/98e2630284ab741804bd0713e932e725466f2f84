platform/x86: alienware-wmi: fix kfree on potentially uninitialized pointer

Currently the kfree of output.pointer can be potentially freeing
an uninitalized pointer in the case where out_data is NULL. Fix this
by reworking the case where out_data is not-null to perform the
ACPI status check and also the kfree of outpoint.pointer in one block
and hence ensuring the pointer is only freed when it has been used.

Also replace the if (ptr != NULL) idiom with just if (ptr).
