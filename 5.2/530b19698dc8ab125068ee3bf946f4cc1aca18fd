drm/panel: Add Rocktech jh057n00900 panel driver

Support Rocktech jh057n00900 5.5" 720x1440 TFT LCD panel. It is a MIPI
DSI video mode panel.

The panel seems to use a Sitronix ST7703 look alike (most of the
commands look similar to the ST7703's data sheet but use a different
number of parameters). The initial version of the DSI init sequence
(including sleeps) were provided by the vendor. Sleeps were reduced
considerably though to speed up initialization.
