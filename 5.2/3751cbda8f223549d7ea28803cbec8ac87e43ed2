mips: Manually call fdt_init_reserved_mem() method

Since memblock-patchset was introduced the reserved-memory nodes are
supported being declared in dt-files. So these nodes are actually parsed
during the arch setup procedure when the early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem()
method is called. But due to the arch-specific boot mem_map container
utilization we need to manually call the fdt_init_reserved_mem() method
after all the available and reserved memory has been moved to memblock.
The first function call performed before bootmem_init() by the
early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() routine fails due to the lack of any
memblock memory regions to allocate from at that stage.
