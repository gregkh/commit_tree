net: phy: aquantia: add downshift support

Aquantia PHY's of the AQR107 family support the downshift feature.
Add support for it as standard PHY tunable so that it can be controlled
via ethtool.
The AQCS109 supports a proprietary 2-pair 1Gbps mode. If two such PHY's
are connected to each other with a 2-pair cable, they may not be able
to establish a link if both advertise modes > 1Gbps.

v2:
- add downshift event detection
- warn if downshift occurred
- read downshifted rate from vendor register
- enable downshift per default on all AQR107 family members
