stm class: Fix channel free in stm output free path

Number of free masters is not set correctly in stm
free path. Fix this by properly adding the number
of output channels before setting them to 0 in
stm_output_disclaim().

Currently it is equivalent to doing nothing since
master->nr_free is incremented by 0.
