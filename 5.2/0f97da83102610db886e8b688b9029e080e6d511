PCI/P2PDMA: Allow P2P DMA between any devices under AMD ZEN Root Complex

The PCI specs say that peer-to-peer DMA should be supported between any two
devices that have a common upstream PCI-to-PCI bridge.  But devices under
different Root Ports don't share a common upstream bridge, and PCIe r4.0,
sec 1.3.1, says routing peer-to-peer transactions between Root Ports in the
same Root Complex is optional.

Many Root Complexes, including AMD ZEN, *do* support peer-to-peer DMA even
between Root Ports.  Add a whitelist and allow peer-to-peer DMA if both
participants are attached to a Root Complex known to support it.
