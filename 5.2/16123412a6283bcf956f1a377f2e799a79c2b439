ASoC: lochnagar: Add driver to support Lochnagar 2 sound card

Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus
Logic Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of
most Cirrus Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing
connection of various application processor systems to provide a
full evaluation platform.

Lochnagar 2 provides a set of line inputs/outputs, and a USB audio
device. This driver adds support for these analog line connections and
the Lochnagar side of the USB audio link.
