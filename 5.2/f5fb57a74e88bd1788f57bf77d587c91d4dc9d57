HID: logitech-dj: add support for the gaming unifying receiver

This receiver is almost identical to the normal unifying ones except:
- it is supposed to be paired to only one device (for performance reasons)
- the mice reports have a greater ranges in their values, so they are
  using a different report ID.

Tested on a G403 and a G900.
