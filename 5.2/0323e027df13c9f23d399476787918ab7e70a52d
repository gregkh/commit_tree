KVM: arm: Make vcpu finalization stubs into inline functions

The vcpu finalization stubs kvm_arm_vcpu_finalize() and
kvm_arm_vcpu_is_finalized() are currently #defines for ARM, which
limits the type-checking that the compiler can do at runtime.

The only reason for them to be #defines was to avoid reliance on
the definition of struct kvm_vcpu, which is not available here due
to circular #include problems.  However, because these are stubs
containing no code, they don't need the definition of struct
kvm_vcpu after all; only a declaration is needed (which is
available already).

So in the interests of cleanliness, this patch converts them to
inline functions.

No functional change.
