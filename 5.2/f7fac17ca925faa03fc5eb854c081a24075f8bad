xhci: Convert xhci_handshake() to use readl_poll_timeout_atomic()

Xhci_handshake() implements the algorithm already captured by
readl_poll_timeout_atomic(). Convert the former to use the latter to
avoid repetition.

Turned out this patch also fixes a bug on the AMD Stoneyridge platform
where usleep(1) sometimes takes over 10ms.
This means a 5 second timeout can easily take over 15 seconds which will
trigger the watchdog and reboot the system.
