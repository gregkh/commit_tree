misc: pci_endpoint_test: Add support to test PCI EP in AM654x

TI's AM654x PCIe EP has a restriction that BAR_0 is mapped to
application registers. "PCIe Inbound Address Translation" section in
AM65x Sitara Processors TRM (SPRUID7 â€“ April 2018) describes BAR0 as
reserved.

Configure pci_endpoint_test to use BAR_2 instead.

Also set alignment to 64K since "PCIe Subsystem Address Translation"
section in TRM indicates minimum ATU window size is 64K.
