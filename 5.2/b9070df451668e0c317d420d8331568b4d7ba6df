ASoC: wm_adsp: Move wm_adsp2_set_dspclk to CODEC drivers

The original wm_adsp2_early_event took an additional frequency
argument for clocking control so could not be used directly as a
DAPM callback. But this setup could equally be done by the codec
driver function wrapping wm_adsp2_early event. In preparation
for adding support for new core types wm_adsp2_set_dspclk has
been exported, and the freq argument removed so that it can
be used directly as a DAPM callback.
