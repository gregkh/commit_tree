mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add erratum A-009204 support

In the event of that any data error (like, IRQSTAT[DCE]) occurs
during an eSDHC data transaction where DMA is used for data
transfer to/from the system memory, setting the SYSCTL[RSTD]
register may cause a system hang. If software sets the register
SYSCTL[RSTD] to 1 for error recovery while DMA transferring is
not complete, eSDHC may hang the system bus. This happens because
the software register SYSCTL[RSTD] resets the DMA engine without
waiting for the completion of pending system transactions. This
erratum is to fix this issue.
