mm, memcg: consider subtrees in memory.events

memory.stat and other files already consider subtrees in their output, and
we should too in order to not present an inconsistent interface.

The current situation is fairly confusing, because people interacting with
cgroups expect hierarchical behaviour in the vein of memory.stat,
cgroup.events, and other files.  For example, this causes confusion when
debugging reclaim events under low, as currently these always read "0" at
non-leaf memcg nodes, which frequently causes people to misdiagnose breach
behaviour.  The same confusion applies to other counters in this file when
debugging issues.

Aggregation is done at write time instead of at read-time since these
counters aren't hot (unlike memory.stat which is per-page, so it does it
at read time), and it makes sense to bundle this with the file
notifications.

After this patch, events are propagated up the hierarchy:

    [root@ktst ~]# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memory.events
    low 0
    high 0
    max 0
    oom 0
    oom_kill 0
    [root@ktst ~]# systemd-run -p MemoryMax=1 true
    Running as unit: run-r251162a189fb4562b9dabfdc9b0422f5.service
    [root@ktst ~]# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/memory.events
    low 0
    high 0
    max 7
    oom 1
    oom_kill 1

As this is a change in behaviour, this can be reverted to the old
behaviour by mounting with the `memory_localevents' flag set.  However, we
use the new behaviour by default as there's a lack of evidence that there
are any current users of memory.events that would find this change
undesirable.

akpm: this is a behaviour change, so Cc:stable.  THis is so that
forthcoming distros which use cgroup v2 are more likely to pick up the
revised behaviour.
