powerpc/64: Don't trace code that runs with the soft irq mask unreconciled

"Reconciling" in terms of interrupt handling, is to bring the soft irq
mask state in to synch with the hardware, after an interrupt causes
MSR[EE] to be cleared (while the soft mask may be enabled, and hard
irqs not marked disabled).

General kernel code should not be called while unreconciled, because
local_irq_disable, etc. manipulations can cause surprising irq traces,
and it's fragile because the soft irq code does not really expect to
be called in this situation.

When exiting from an interrupt, MSR[EE] is cleared to prevent races,
but soft irq state is enabled for the returned-to context, so this is
now an unreconciled state. restore_math is called in this state, and
that can be ftraced, and the ftrace subsystem disables local irqs.

Mark restore_math and its callees as notrace. Restore a sanity check
in the soft irq code that had to be disabled for this case, by commit
4da1f79227ad4 ("powerpc/64: Disable irq restore warning for now").
