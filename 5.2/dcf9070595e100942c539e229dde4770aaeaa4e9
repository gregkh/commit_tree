fbdev: sm712fb: fix VRAM detection, don't set SR70/71/74/75

On a Thinkpad s30 (Pentium III / i440MX, Lynx3DM), the amount of Video
RAM is not detected correctly by the xf86-video-siliconmotion driver.
This is because sm712fb overwrites the GPR71 Scratch Pad Register, which
is set by BIOS on x86 and used to indicate amount of VRAM.

Other Scratch Pad Registers, including GPR70/74/75, don't have the same
side-effect, but overwriting to them is still questionable, as they are
not related to modesetting.

Stop writing to SR70/71/74/75 (a.k.a GPR70/71/74/75).
