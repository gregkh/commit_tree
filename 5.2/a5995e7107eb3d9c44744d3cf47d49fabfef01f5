ipv4: Move exception bucket to nh_common

Similar to the cached routes, make IPv4 exceptions accessible when
using an IPv6 nexthop struct with IPv4 routes. Simplify the exception
functions by passing in fib_nh_common since that is all it needs,
and then cleanup the call sites that have extraneous fib_nh conversions.

As with the cached routes this is a change in location only, from fib_nh
up to fib_nh_common; no functional change intended.
