ice: Disable sniffing VF traffic on PF

Delete code that add default Tx rule on PF. With this rule PF can see
Tx VF traffic that should go outside. For traffic from VF to another
VF default Tx rule on PF doesn't apply because of lower priority than
VF mac rule.

With this change on PF in promisc mode we can see only Rx traffic that
doesn't match any other rule (mac etc.). We can't see Tx traffic from
other VSI.
