gpio: Set proper argument value to set_config

The gpio_set_config function creates a pinconf configuration for a given
pinc_config_param.

However, it always uses an arg of 0, which might not be a valid argument
for a given param. A good example of that would be the bias parameters,
where 0 means that the pull up or down resistor is null, and the pin is
directly connected to VCC/GND.

The framework uses in some other places the value 1 as a default argument
to enable the pull resistor, so let's use the same one here.
