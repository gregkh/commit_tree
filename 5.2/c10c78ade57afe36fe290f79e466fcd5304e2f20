drm/i915/execlists: Refactor out can_merge_rq()

In the next patch, we add another user that wants to check whether
requests can be merge into a single HW execution, and in the future we
want to add more conditions under which requests from the same context
cannot be merge. In preparation, extract out can_merge_rq().

v2: Reorder tests to decide if we can continue filling ELSP and bonus
comments.
