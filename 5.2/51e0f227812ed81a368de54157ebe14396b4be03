stm class: Fix channel bitmap on 32-bit systems

Commit 7bd1d4093c2f ("stm class: Introduce an abstraction for System Trace
Module devices") naively calculates the channel bitmap size in 64-bit
chunks regardless of the size of underlying unsigned long, making the
bitmap half as big on a 32-bit system. This leads to an out of bounds
access with the upper half of the bitmap.

Fix this by using BITS_TO_LONGS. While at it, convert to using
struct_size() for the total size calculation of the master struct.
