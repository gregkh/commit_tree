ARM: dts: bugfix tqma7 soft reset issue

Running reboot command on the TQMa7 board would just hang infinite
at the end of the system shutdown process.

Handling of i.MX7 errata e10574:
Watchdog: A watchdog timeout or software trigger will not reset the SOC.

Moved pinctrl from common mba7 to common tqma7 dtsi as it improves
readability of errata handling. Most integrators of this SoM will
likely use the development board as inspiration for handling this
SoC issue.
