selftests_bpf: extend test_tc_tunnel for UDP encap

commit 868d523535c2 ("bpf: add bpf_skb_adjust_room encap flags")
introduced support to bpf_skb_adjust_room for GSO-friendly GRE
and UDP encapsulation and later introduced associated test_tc_tunnel
tests.  Here those tests are extended to cover UDP encapsulation also.
