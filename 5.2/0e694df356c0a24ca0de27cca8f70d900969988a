spi: tegra20-slink: change chip select action order

To transfer via SPI the tegra20-slink driver first sets the command
register, which contains the chip select value, and after that the
command2 register, which contains the chip select line. This leads to a
small spike in the chip selct 0 line between the set of the value and
the selection of the chip select line.

This commit changes the order of the register writes so that first the
chip select line is chosen and then the value is set, removing the
spike.
