powerpc/pseries: Track LMB nid instead of using device tree

When removing memory we need to remove the memory from the node
it was added to instead of looking up the node it should be in
in the device tree.

During testing we have seen scenarios where the affinity for a
LMB changes due to a partition migration or PRRN event. In these
cases the node the LMB exists in may not match the node the device
tree indicates it belongs in. This can lead to a system crash
when trying to DLPAR remove the LMB after a migration or PRRN
event. The current code looks up the node in the device tree to
remove the LMB from, the crash occurs when we try to offline this
node and it does not have any data, i.e. node_data[nid] == NULL.

To resolve this we need to track the node a LMB belongs to when
it is added to the system so we can remove it from that node instead
of the node that the device tree indicates it should belong to.
