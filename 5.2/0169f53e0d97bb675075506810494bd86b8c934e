x86/fpu: Remove user_fpu_begin()

user_fpu_begin() sets fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx to task's fpu struct. This is
always the case since there is no lazy FPU anymore.

fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx is used during context switch to decide if it needs
to load the saved registers or if the currently loaded registers are
valid. It could be skipped during a

  taskA -> kernel thread -> taskA

switch because the switch to the kernel thread would not alter the CPU's
sFPU tate.

Since this field is always updated during context switch and
never invalidated, setting it manually (in user context) makes no
difference. A kernel thread with kernel_fpu_begin() block could
set fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx to NULL but a kernel thread does not use
user_fpu_begin().

This is a leftover from the lazy-FPU time.

Remove user_fpu_begin(), it does not change fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx's
content.
