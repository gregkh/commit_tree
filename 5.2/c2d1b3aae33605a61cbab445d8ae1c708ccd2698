btrfs: Honour FITRIM range constraints during free space trim

Up until now trimming the freespace was done irrespective of what the
arguments of the FITRIM ioctl were. For example fstrim's -o/-l arguments
will be entirely ignored. Fix it by correctly handling those paramter.
This requires breaking if the found freespace extent is after the end of
the passed range as well as completing trim after trimming
fstrim_range::len bytes.
