nvmem: sunxi_sid: Support SID on A83T and H5

The device tree binding already lists compatible strings for these two
SoCs. They don't have the defect as seen on the H3, and the size and
register layout is the same as the A64. Furthermore, the driver does
not include nvmem cell definitions.

Add support for these two compatible strings, re-using the config for
the A64.
