rcutorture: Fix cleanup path for invalid torture_type strings

If the specified rcutorture.torture_type is not in the rcu_torture_init()
function's torture_ops[] array, rcutorture prints some console messages
and then invokes rcu_torture_cleanup() to set state so that a future
torture test can run.  However, rcu_torture_cleanup() also attempts to
end the test that didn't actually start, and in doing so relies on the
value of cur_ops, a value that is not particularly relevant in this case.
This can result in confusing output or even follow-on failures due to
attempts to use facilities that have not been properly initialized.

This commit therefore sets the value of cur_ops to NULL in this case
and inserts a check near the beginning of rcu_torture_cleanup(),
thus avoiding relying on an irrelevant cur_ops value.
