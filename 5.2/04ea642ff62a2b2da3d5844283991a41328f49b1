ASoC: SOF: pcm: clear hw_params_upon_resume flag correctly

sof_pcm_hw_params() can only be called once to setup the FW hw_params.
So after calling sof_pcm_hw_params(), hw_params_upon_resume flag must
be cleared to avoid multiple invoking sof_pcm_hw_params() by prepare.

For example, after resume, there is an xrun happened, prepare() will
be called. As the hw_params_upon_resume flag is not cleared,
sof_pcm_hw_params() will be called and this will cause IPC timeout.

This patch fixes such issues.
