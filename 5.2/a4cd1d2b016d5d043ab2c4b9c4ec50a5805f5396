drm/mediatek: clear num_pipes when unbind driver

num_pipes is used for mutex created in mtk_drm_crtc_create(). If we
don't clear num_pipes count, when rebinding driver, the count will
be accumulated. From mtk_disp_mutex_get(), there can only be at most
10 mutex id. Clear this number so it starts from 0 in every rebind.
