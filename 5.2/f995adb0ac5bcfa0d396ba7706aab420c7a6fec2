MIPS: Use memblock_phys_alloc() for exception vector

Allocate the exception vector using memblock_phys_alloc() which gives us
a physical address, rather than the previous convoluted setup which
obtained a virtual address using memblock_alloc(), converted it to a
physical address & then back to a virtual address.
