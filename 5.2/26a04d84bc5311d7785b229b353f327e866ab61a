arm64: debug: Separate debug hooks based on target exception level

Mixing kernel and user debug hooks together is highly error-prone as it
relies on all of the hooks to figure out whether the exception came from
kernel or user, and then to act accordingly.

Make our debug hook code a little more robust by maintaining separate
hook lists for user and kernel, with separate registration functions
to force callers to be explicit about the exception levels that they
care about.
