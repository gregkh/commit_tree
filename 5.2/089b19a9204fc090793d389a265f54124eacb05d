flow_dissector: switch kernel context to struct bpf_flow_dissector

struct bpf_flow_dissector has a small subset of sk_buff fields that
flow dissector BPF program is allowed to access and an optional
pointer to real skb. Real skb is used only in bpf_skb_load_bytes
helper to read non-linear data.

The real motivation for this is to be able to call flow dissector
from eth_get_headlen context where we don't have an skb and need
to dissect raw bytes.
