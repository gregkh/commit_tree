HID: quirks: do not blacklist Logitech devices

I am actually suggesting people to not populate this list, and I should
probably start to apply my advices to myself.

The end result means that if your initrd is lacking hid-logitech-dj
or hid-logitech-hidpp, but still contains hid-generic, then your
keyboard will work during pre-init.
