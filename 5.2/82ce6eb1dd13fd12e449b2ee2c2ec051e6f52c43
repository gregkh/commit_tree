selftests: netfilter: missing error check when setting up veth interface

A test for the basic NAT functionality uses ip command which needs veth
device. There is a condition where the kernel support for veth is not
compiled into the kernel and the test script breaks. This patch contains
code for reasonable error display and correct code exit.
