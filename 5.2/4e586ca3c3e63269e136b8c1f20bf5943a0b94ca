btrfs: Remove EXTENT_WRITEBACK

This flag was introduced in a52d9a8033c4 ("Btrfs: Extent based page
cache code.") and subsequently it's usage effectively was removed by
1edbb734b4e0 ("Btrfs: reduce CPU usage in the extent_state tree") and
f2a97a9dbd86 ("btrfs: remove all unused functions"). Just remove it,
no functional changes.
