docs/zh_CN: move process related docs into process dir

Much process documents spread here isn't neat. It's good to put them together
in their directory: process

So create 'process' directory and move docs:
	email-clients stable_kernel_rules stable_api_nosense
	submittingpatches submittingdrivers HOWTO
	volatile-considered-harmful
there.
