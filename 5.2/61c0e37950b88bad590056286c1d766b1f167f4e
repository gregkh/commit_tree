tty: serial: msm_serial: Fix XON/XOFF

When the tty layer requests the uart to throttle, the current code
executing in msm_serial will trigger "Bad mode in Error Handler" and
generate an invalid stack frame in pstore before rebooting (that is if
pstore is indeed configured: otherwise the user shall just notice a
reboot with no further information dumped to the console).

This patch replaces the PIO byte accessor with the word accessor
already used in PIO mode.
