security: don't use RCU accessors for cred->session_keyring

sparse complains that a bunch of places in kernel/cred.c access
cred->session_keyring without the RCU helpers required by the __rcu
annotation.

cred->session_keyring is written in the following places:

 - prepare_kernel_cred() [in a new cred struct]
 - keyctl_session_to_parent() [in a new cred struct]
 - prepare_creds [in a new cred struct, via memcpy]
 - install_session_keyring_to_cred()
  - from install_session_keyring() on new creds
  - from join_session_keyring() on new creds [twice]
  - from umh_keys_init()
   - from call_usermodehelper_exec_async() on new creds

All of these writes are before the creds are committed; therefore,
cred->session_keyring doesn't need RCU protection.

Remove the __rcu annotation and fix up all existing users that use __rcu.
