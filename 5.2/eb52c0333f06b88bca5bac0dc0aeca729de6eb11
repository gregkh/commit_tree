RDMA/i40iw: Use core helpers to get aligned DMA address within a supported page size

Call the core helpers to retrieve the HW aligned address to use for the
MR, within a supported i40iw page size.

Remove code in i40iw to determine when MR is backed by 2M huge pages which
involves checking the umem->hugetlb flag and VMA inspection.  The new DMA
iterator will return the 2M aligned address if the MR is backed by 2M
pages.
