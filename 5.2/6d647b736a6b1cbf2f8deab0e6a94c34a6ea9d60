ALSA: hdac: fix memory release for SST and SOF drivers

During the integration of HDaudio support, we changed the way in which
we get hdev in snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_init() to use one preallocated
with devm_kzalloc(), however it still left kfree(hdev) in
snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_exit(). It leads to oopses when trying to
rmmod and modprobe. Fix it, by just removing kfree call.

SOF also uses some of the snd_hdac_ functions for HDAudio support but
allocated the memory with kzalloc. A matching fix is provided
separately to align all users of the snd_hdac_ library.
