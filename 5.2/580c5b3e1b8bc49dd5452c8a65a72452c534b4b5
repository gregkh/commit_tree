kconfig: make parent directories for the saved .config as needed

With menuconfig / nconfig, users can input any file path from the
"Save" menu, but it fails if the parent directory does not exist.

Why not create the parent directory automatically. I think this is
a user-friendly behavior.

I changed the error messages in menuconfig / nconfig.

"Nonexistent directory" is no longer the most likely reason of the
failure. Perhaps, the user specified the existing directory, or
attempted to write to the location without write permission.
