ARM: dts: armada-38x: add interrupts for watchdog

The first interrupt is for the regular watchdog timeout. Normally the
RSTOUT line will trigger a reset before this interrupt fires but on
systems with a non-standard reset it may still trigger.

The second interrupt is for a timer1 which is used as a pre-timeout for
the watchdog.
