kernel/sysctl.c: fix proc_do_large_bitmap for large input buffers

Today, proc_do_large_bitmap() truncates a large write input buffer to
PAGE_SIZE - 1, which may result in misparsed numbers at the (truncated)
end of the buffer.  Further, it fails to notify the caller that the
buffer was truncated, so it doesn't get called iteratively to finish the
entire input buffer.

Tell the caller if there's more work to do by adding the skipped amount
back to left/*lenp before returning.

To fix the misparsing, reset the position if we have completely consumed
a truncated buffer (or if just one char is left, which may be a "-" in a
range), and ask the caller to come back for more.
