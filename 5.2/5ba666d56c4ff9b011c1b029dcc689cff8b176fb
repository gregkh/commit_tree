powerpc/mm: fix erroneous duplicate slb_addr_limit init

Commit 67fda38f0d68 ("powerpc/mm: Move slb_addr_linit to
early_init_mmu") moved slb_addr_limit init out of setup_arch().

Commit 701101865f5d ("powerpc/mm: Reduce memory usage for mm_context_t
for radix") brought it back into setup_arch() by error.

This patch reverts that erroneous regress.
