ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: Enable USB OTG controller on some boards

The Bananapi M3 and Cubietruck Plus both have USB OTG ports wired to the
SoC and PMIC in the same way, with the N_VBUSEN pin on the PMIC
controlling VBUS output, the PMIC's VBUS input for sensing VBUS, and
PH11 on the SoC for sensing the ID pin.

Enable OTG on both boards.
