drm/i915/guc: GuC suspend path cleanup

Adding a call to intel_uc_suspend in i915_gem_suspend, which
is a common point for the suspend/resume and hibernate paths.
This fixes an unbalanced call that causes issues with the CTB
register/deregister.

v2: Making the call unconditional (Daniele)
	Moving the call to after the GEM_BUG_ON (Chris)
