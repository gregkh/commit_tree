memstick: mspro_block: Fix an error code in mspro_block_issue_req()

We accidentally changed the error code from -EAGAIN to 1 when we did the
blk-mq conversion.

Maybe a contributing factor to this mistake is that it wasn't obvious
that the "while (chunk) {" condition is always true.  I have cleaned
that up as well.
