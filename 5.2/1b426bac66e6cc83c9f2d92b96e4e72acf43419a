hugetlb: use same fault hash key for shared and private mappings

hugetlb uses a fault mutex hash table to prevent page faults of the
same pages concurrently.  The key for shared and private mappings is
different.  Shared keys off address_space and file index.  Private keys
off mm and virtual address.  Consider a private mappings of a populated
hugetlbfs file.  A fault will map the page from the file and if needed
do a COW to map a writable page.

Hugetlbfs hole punch uses the fault mutex to prevent mappings of file
pages.  It uses the address_space file index key.  However, private
mappings will use a different key and could race with this code to map
the file page.  This causes problems (BUG) for the page cache remove
code as it expects the page to be unmapped.  A sample stack is:

page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_mapped(page))
kernel BUG at mm/filemap.c:169!
...
RIP: 0010:unaccount_page_cache_page+0x1b8/0x200

There seems to be another potential COW issue/race with this approach
of different private and shared keys as noted in commit 8382d914ebf7
("mm, hugetlb: improve page-fault scalability").

Since every hugetlb mapping (even anon and private) is actually a file
mapping, just use the address_space index key for all mappings.  This
results in potentially more hash collisions.  However, this should not
be the common case.
