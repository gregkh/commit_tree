hwmon: (ina3221) Add voltage conversion time settings

The CONFIG register has two 3-bit fields for conversion time
settings of Bus-voltage and Shunt-voltage, respectively. The
conversion settings, along with averaging mode, allow users
to optimize available timing requirement.

This patch adds an 'update_interval' sysfs node through the
hwmon_chip_info of hwmon core. It reflects a total hardware
conversion time:
    samples * channels * (Bus + Shunt conversion times)

Though INA3221 supports different conversion time setups for
Bus and Shunt voltages, this patch only adds the support of
a unified setting for both conversion times, by dividing the
conversion time into two equal values.
