perf vendor events intel: Update metrics from TMAM 3.5

Update all the Intel JSON metrics from Ahmad Yasin's TMAM 3.5
for Intel big core from Sandy Bridge to Cascade Lake.

This has many improvements and new metircs

- New TopDownL1_SMT group that provides a per SMT thread version
of --topdown that does not require -a anymore. The drawback is
increased multiplexing though since L1 TopDown does not fit into
4 generic counters anymore.

- Added SMT aware versions of other metrics

- Split SMT aware metrics into separate metrics to avoid
unnecessary event collections

- New metrics for better branch analysis:
Estimated Branch_Mispredict_Costs, Instructions per taken Branch,
Branch Instructions per Taken Branch, etc.

- Instruction mix metrics:
Instructions per load, Instructions per store, Instructions per Branch,
Instructions per Call

- New Cache metrics:
Bandwidth to L1/L2/L3 caches. L1/L2/L3 misses per kilo instructions.
memory level parallelism

- New memory controller metrics:
Normalized memory bandwidth in interval mode, Average memory latency,
Average number of parallel read requests,

- 3DXP persistent memory metrics for Cascade Lake:
3dxp read latency, 3dxp read/write bandwidth

- Some other useful metrics like Instruction Level Parallelism,

- Various other improvements.

Not all metrics are available on all CPUs. Skylake has best coverage.
