mtd: rawnand: Always store info about bad block markers in chip struct

The information about where the manufacturer puts the bad block
markers inside the bad block and in the OOB data is stored in
different places. Let's move this information to nand_chip.options
and nand_chip.badblockpos.

As this chip-specific information is not directly related to the
bad block table (BBT), we also rename the flags to NAND_BBM_*.
