RDMA/umem: Combine contiguous PAGE_SIZE regions in SGEs

Combine contiguous regions of PAGE_SIZE pages into single scatter list
entry while building the scatter table for a umem. This minimizes the
number of the entries in the scatter list and reduces the DMA mapping
overhead, particularly with the IOMMU.

Set default max_seg_size in core for IB devices to 2G and do not combine
if we exceed this limit.

Also, purge npages in struct ib_umem as we now DMA map the umem SGL with
sg_nents and npage computation is not needed. Drivers should now be using
ib_umem_num_pages(), so fix the last stragglers.

Move npages tracking to ib_umem_odp as ODP drivers still need it.
