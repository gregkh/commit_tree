arm64/sve: In-kernel vector length availability query interface

KVM will need to interrogate the set of SVE vector lengths
available on the system.

This patch exposes the relevant bits to the kernel, along with a
sve_vq_available() helper to check whether a particular vector
length is supported.

__vq_to_bit() and __bit_to_vq() are not intended for use outside
these functions: now that these are exposed outside fpsimd.c, they
are prefixed with __ in order to provide an extra hint that they
are not intended for general-purpose use.
