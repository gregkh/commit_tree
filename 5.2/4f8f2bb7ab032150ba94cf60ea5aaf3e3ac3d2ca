mfd: cros_ec: Instantiate properly CrOS Touchpad MCU device

Support Touchpad MCU as a special of CrOS EC devices. The current
Touchpad MCU is used on Eve Chromebook and used the same protocol as
other CrOS EC devices.

When a MCU has touchpad support (aka EC_FEATURE_TOUCHPAD), it is
instantiated as a special CrOS EC device with device name 'cros_tp'. So
regardless of the probing order between the actual cros_ec and cros_tp,
the userspace and other kernel drivers should not confuse them.
