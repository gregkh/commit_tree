watchdog: intel_scu: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config INTEL_SCU_WATCHDOG
       bool "Intel SCU Watchdog for Mobile Platforms"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We leave the moduleparam.h include since the file does declare some
module parameters, and leaving them as such is currently the easiest
way to remain compatible with existing boot arg use cases.
