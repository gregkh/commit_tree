i2c: tegra: Add Dmitry as a reviewer

I'm contributing to Tegra's upstream development in general and happened
to review the Tegra's I2C patches for awhile because I'm actively using
upstream kernel on all of my Tegra-powered devices and initially some of
the submitted patches were getting my attention since they were causing
problems. Recently Wolfram Sang asked whether I'm interested in becoming
a reviewer for the driver and I don't mind at all.
