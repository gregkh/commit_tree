net: phy: improve resuming from hibernation

I got an interesting report [0] that after resuming from hibernation
the link has 100Mbps instead of 1Gbps. Reason is that another OS has
been used whilst Linux was hibernated. And this OS speeds down the link
due to WoL. Therefore, when resuming, we shouldn't expect that what
the PHY advertises is what it did when hibernating.
Easiest way to do this is removing state PHY_RESUMING. Instead always
go via PHY_UP that configures PHY advertisement.
