scsi: lpfc: Stop adapter if pci errors detected

In a couple of cases, the driver detected a pci error (via pci device state
or via failed register reads) but didn't take any action to disable the
device.  Additionally, the driver is ignoring the status of pci
configuration space reads.

Having the driver take the adapter offline whenever the pci error is
detected.  Pay attention to pci_config_space_read status and return failure
if an error is seen.
