scripts/gdb: add kernel config dumping command

lx-configdump <file> dumps the contents of the gzipped .config to a text
file when the config is included in the kernel with CONFIG_IKCONFIG.  By
default, the file written is called config.txt, but it can be any user
supplied filename as well.  If the kernel config is in a module
(configs.ko), then it can be loaded along with symbols for the module
loaded with 'lx-symbols' and then this command will still work.

Obviously if you have the whole vmlinux then this can also be achieved
with scripts/extract-ikconfig, but this gdb script can be useful to
confirm that the memory contents of the config in memory and the vmlinux
contents on disk match what is expected.
