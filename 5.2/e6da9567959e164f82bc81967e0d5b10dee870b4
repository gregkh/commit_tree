objtool: Don't use ignore flag for fake jumps

The ignore flag is set on fake jumps in order to keep
add_jump_destinations() from setting their jump_dest, since it already
got set when the fake jump was created.

But using the ignore flag is a bit of a hack.  It's normally used to
skip validation of an instruction, which doesn't really make sense for
fake jumps.

Also, after the next patch, using the ignore flag for fake jumps can
trigger a false "why am I validating an ignored function?" warning.

Instead just add an explicit check in add_jump_destinations() to skip
fake jumps.
