drm/amd/display: Link train only when link is DP and backend is enabled

[Why]
In certain cases we do link training when we don't have a backend.

[How]
In dc_link_set_preferred_link_settings(), store preferred link settings
first and then verify that the link is DP and the link stream's backend is
enabled.  If either is false, then we will not do any link retraining.
