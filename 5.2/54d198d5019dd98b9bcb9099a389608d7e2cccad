ASoC: SOF: Propagate sof_get_ctrl_copy_params() error properly

This fixes a compile warning below by properly handling the error code
from sof_get_ctrl_copy_params():
  include/linux/kernel.h:843:43: warning: 'sparams.pl_size' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  sound/soc/sof/ipc.c:639:34: note: 'sparams.pl_size' was declared here

The function returns an error before setting sparams.pl_size, so it'd
assign an uninitialized value at a later point.
