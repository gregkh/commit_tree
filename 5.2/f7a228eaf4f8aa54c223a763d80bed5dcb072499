power: supply: olpc_battery: Use DT to get battery version

Avoid using the x86 OLPC platform specific call to get the board
version. That wouldn't work on FDT-based ARM MMP2 platform.

Add the XO 1.5 compatible string too. This is actually not completely
necessary as the battery nodes on XO 1.5 claim to be compatible with
"olpc,xo1-battery", but there are, in fact, differencies.
