mac80211: minstrel_ht: automatically calculate rate duration shift

A per-group shift was added to reduce the size of the per-rate transmit
duration field to u16 without sacrificing a lot of precision
This patch changes the macros to automatically calculate the best value for
this shift based on the lowest rate within the group.
This simplifies adding more groups and slightly improves accuracy for some of
the existing groups.
