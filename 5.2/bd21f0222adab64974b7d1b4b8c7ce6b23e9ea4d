USB: Fix chipmunk-like voice when using Logitech C270 for recording audio.

This patch fixes the chipmunk-like voice that manifets randomly when
using the integrated mic of the Logitech Webcam HD C270.

The issue was solved initially for this device by commit 2394d67e446b
("USB: add RESET_RESUME for webcams shown to be quirky") but it was then
reintroduced by e387ef5c47dd ("usb: Add USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME for all
Logitech UVC webcams"). This patch is to have the fix back.
