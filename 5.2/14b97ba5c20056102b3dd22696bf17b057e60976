hwmon: (vt1211) Use request_muxed_region for Super-IO accesses

Super-IO accesses may fail on a system with no or unmapped LPC bus.

Also, other drivers may attempt to access the LPC bus at the same time,
resulting in undefined behavior.

Use request_muxed_region() to ensure that IO access on the requested
address space is supported, and to ensure that access by multiple drivers
is synchronized.
