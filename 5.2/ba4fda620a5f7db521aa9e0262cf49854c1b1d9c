drm/i915: Optionally disable automatic recovery after a GPU reset

Some clients, such as mesa, may only emit minimal incremental batches
that rely on the logical context state from previous batches. They know
that recovery is impossible after a hang as their required GPU state is
lost, and that each in flight and subsequent batch will hang (resetting
the context image back to default perpetuating the problem).

To avoid getting into the state in the first place, we can allow clients
to opt out of automatic recovery and elect to ban any guilty context
following a hang. This prevents the continual stream of hangs and allows
the client to recreate their context and rebuild the state from scratch.

v2: Prefer calling it recoverable rather than unrecoverable.
