apparmor: enforce nullbyte at end of tag string

A packed AppArmor policy contains null-terminated tag strings that are read
by unpack_nameX(). However, unpack_nameX() uses string functions on them
without ensuring that they are actually null-terminated, potentially
leading to out-of-bounds accesses.

Make sure that the tag string is null-terminated before passing it to
strcmp().
