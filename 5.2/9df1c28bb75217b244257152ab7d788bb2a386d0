bpf: add writable context for raw tracepoints

This is an opt-in interface that allows a tracepoint to provide a safe
buffer that can be written from a BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT program.
The size of the buffer must be a compile-time constant, and is checked
before allowing a BPF program to attach to a tracepoint that uses this
feature.

The pointer to this buffer will be the first argument of tracepoints
that opt in; the pointer is valid and can be bpf_probe_read() by both
BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT and BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT_WRITABLE
programs that attach to such a tracepoint, but the buffer to which it
points may only be written by the latter.
