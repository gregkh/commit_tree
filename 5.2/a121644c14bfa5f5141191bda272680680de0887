i40e: print PCI vendor and device ID during probe

Printing each devices PCI vendor and device ID has the advantage of
easily revealing what hardware we're dealing with exactly. It's no
longer necessary to match the PCI bus information to the lspci output.

Helps with bug reports where no lspci output is available.
