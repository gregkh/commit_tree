ACPI: event: replace strcpy() by strscpy()

The strcpy() function is being deprecated. Replace it by the safer
strscpy() and fix the following Coverity warnings:

"You might overrun the 15-character fixed-size string event->bus_id
by copying bus_id without checking the length."

"You might overrun the 20-character fixed-size string event->device_class
by copying device_class without checking the length."
