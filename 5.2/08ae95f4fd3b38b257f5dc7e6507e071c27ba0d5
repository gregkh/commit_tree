nohz_full: Allow the boot CPU to be nohz_full

Allow the boot CPU/CPU0 to be nohz_full. Have the boot CPU take the
do_timer duty during boot until a housekeeping CPU can take over.

This is supported when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_SMP is not configured, or when
it is configured and the arch allows suspend on non-zero CPUs.

nohz_full has been trialed at a large supercomputer site and found to
significantly reduce jitter. In order to deploy it in production, they
need CPU0 to be nohz_full because their job control system requires
the application CPUs to start from 0, and the housekeeping CPUs are
placed higher. An equivalent job scheduling that uses CPU0 for
housekeeping could be achieved by modifying their system, but it is
preferable if nohz_full can support their environment without
modification.
