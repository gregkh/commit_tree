KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Add a control to dirty the XIVE EQ pages

When migration of a VM is initiated, a first copy of the RAM is
transferred to the destination before the VM is stopped, but there is
no guarantee that the EQ pages in which the event notifications are
queued have not been modified.

To make sure migration will capture a consistent memory state, the
XIVE device should perform a XIVE quiesce sequence to stop the flow of
event notifications and stabilize the EQs. This is the purpose of the
KVM_DEV_XIVE_EQ_SYNC control which will also marks the EQ pages dirty
to force their transfer.
