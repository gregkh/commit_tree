coresight: catu: fix clang build warning

Clang points out a syntax error, as the etr_catu_buf_ops structure is
declared 'static' before the type is known:

In file included from drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-tmc-etr.c:12:
drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-catu.h:116:40: warning: tentative definition of variable with internal linkage has incomplete non-array type 'const struct etr_buf_operations' [-Wtentative-definition-incomplete-type]
static const struct etr_buf_operations etr_catu_buf_ops;
                                       ^
drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-catu.h:116:21: note: forward declaration of 'struct etr_buf_operations'
static const struct etr_buf_operations etr_catu_buf_ops;

This seems worth fixing in the code, so replace pointer to the empty
constant structure with a NULL pointer. We need an extra NULL pointer
check here, but the result should be better object code otherwise,
avoiding the silly empty structure.
