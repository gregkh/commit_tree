s390: only build for new CPUs with clang

llvm does does not understand -march=z9-109 and older target
specifiers, so disable the respective Kconfig settings and
the logic to make the boot code work on old systems when
building with clang.

Part of the early boot code is normally compiled with -march=z900
for maximum compatibility. This also has to get changed with
clang to the oldest supported ISA, which is -march=z10 here.
