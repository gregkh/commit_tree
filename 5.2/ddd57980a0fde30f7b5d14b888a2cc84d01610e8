xhci: detect USB 3.2 capable host controllers correctly

USB 3.2 capability in a host can be detected from the
xHCI Supported Protocol Capability major and minor revision fields.

If major is 0x3 and minor 0x20 then the host is USB 3.2 capable.

For USB 3.2 capable hosts set the root hub lane count to 2.

The Major Revision and Minor Revision fields contain a BCD version number.
The value of the Major Revision field is JJh and the value of the Minor
Revision field is MNh for version JJ.M.N, where JJ = major revision number,
M - minor version number, N = sub-minor version number,
e.g. version 3.1 is represented with a value of 0310h.

Also fix the extra whitespace printed out when announcing regular
SuperSpeed hosts.
