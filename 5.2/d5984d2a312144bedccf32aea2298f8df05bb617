i2c: mux: demux-pinctrl: use struct_size() in devm_kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct foo {
    int stuff;
    void *entry[];
};

instance = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(struct foo) + sizeof(void *) * count, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(instance, entry, count), GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
