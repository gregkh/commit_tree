ocxl: Create a clear delineation between ocxl backend & frontend

The OCXL driver contains both frontend code for interacting with userspace,
as well as backend code for interacting with the hardware.

This patch separates the backend code from the frontend so that it can be
used by other device drivers that communicate via OpenCAPI.

Relocate dev, cdev & sysfs files to the frontend code to allow external
drivers to maintain their own devices.

Reference counting on the device in the backend is replaced with kref
counting.

Move file & sysfs layer initialisation from core.c (backend) to
pci.c (frontend).

Create an ocxl_function oriented interface for initing devices &
enumerating AFUs.
