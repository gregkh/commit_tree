KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: add a control to initialize a source

The XIVE KVM device maintains a list of interrupt sources for the VM
which are allocated in the pool of generic interrupts (IPIs) of the
main XIVE IC controller. These are used for the CPU IPIs as well as
for virtual device interrupts. The IRQ number space is defined by
QEMU.

The XIVE device reuses the source structures of the XICS-on-XIVE
device for the source blocks (2-level tree) and for the source
interrupts. Under XIVE native, the source interrupt caches mostly
configuration information and is less used than under the XICS-on-XIVE
device in which hcalls are still necessary at run-time.

When a source is initialized in KVM, an IPI interrupt source is simply
allocated at the OPAL level and then MASKED. KVM only needs to know
about its type: LSI or MSI.
