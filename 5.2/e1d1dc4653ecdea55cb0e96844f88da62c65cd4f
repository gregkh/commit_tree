libbpf: fix printf formatter for ptrdiff_t argument

Using %ld for printing out value of ptrdiff_t type is not portable
between 32-bit and 64-bit archs. This is causing compilation errors for
libbpf on 32-bit platform (discovered as part of an effort to integrate
libbpf into systemd ([0])). Proper formatter is %td, which is used in
this patch.
