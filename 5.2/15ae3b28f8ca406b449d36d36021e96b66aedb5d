drm/amd/display: disable link before changing link settings

[Why]
If link is already enabled at a different rate (for example 5.4 Gbps)
then calling VBIOS command table to switch to a new rate
(for example 2.7 Gbps) will not take effect.
This can lead to link training failure to occur.

[How]
If the requested link rate is different than the current link rate,
the link must be disabled in order to re-enable at the new
link rate.

In today's logic it is currently only impacting eDP since DP
connection types will always disable the link during display
detection, when initial link verification occurs.
