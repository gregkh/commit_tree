ASoC: hdmi-codec: unlock the device on startup errors

If the hdmi codec startup fails, it should clear the current_substream
pointer to free the device. This is properly done for the audio_startup()
callback but for snd_pcm_hw_constraint_eld().

Make sure the pointer cleared if an error is reported.
