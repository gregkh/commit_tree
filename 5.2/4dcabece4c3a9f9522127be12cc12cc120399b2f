cgroup: protect cgroup->nr_(dying_)descendants by css_set_lock

The number of descendant cgroups and the number of dying
descendant cgroups are currently synchronized using the cgroup_mutex.

The number of descendant cgroups will be required by the cgroup v2
freezer, which will use it to determine if a cgroup is frozen
(depending on total number of descendants and number of frozen
descendants). It's not always acceptable to grab the cgroup_mutex,
especially from quite hot paths (e.g. exit()).

To avoid this, let's additionally synchronize these counters using
the css_set_lock.

So, it's safe to read these counters with either cgroup_mutex or
css_set_lock locked, and for changing both locks should be acquired.
