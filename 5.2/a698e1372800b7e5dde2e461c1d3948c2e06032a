s390/qdio: optimize state inspection of HW-owned SBALs

When get_buf_states() gets called with count > 1, it scans the
corresponding number of SBAL states until it encounters a mismatch.

But when these SBALs are in a HW-owned state, the callers don't actually
care _how many_ such SBALs are on the queue. If we can't process the
first SBAL, we can't process any of the following SBALs either. So when
the first SBAL is HW-owned, skip the scan of the remaining SBALs and
thus save some CPU time.
