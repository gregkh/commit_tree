KVM: Introduce a 'mmap' method for KVM devices

Some KVM devices will want to handle special mappings related to the
underlying HW. For instance, the XIVE interrupt controller of the
POWER9 processor has MMIO pages for thread interrupt management and
for interrupt source control that need to be exposed to the guest when
the OS has the required support.
