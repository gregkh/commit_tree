nvme: Fix u32 overflow in the number of namespace list calculation

The Number of Namespaces (nn) field in the identify controller data structure is
defined as u32 and the maximum allowed value in NVMe specification is
0xFFFFFFFEUL. This change fixes the possible overflow of the DIV_ROUND_UP()
operation used in nvme_scan_ns_list() by casting the nn to u64.
