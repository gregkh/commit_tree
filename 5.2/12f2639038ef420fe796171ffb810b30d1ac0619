tracing: stop making gpio tracing configurable

gpio tracing was made configurable in 4.4-rc1 (commit ddd70280bf0e
("tracing: gpio: Add Kconfig option for enabling/disabling trace
events")). Since then it is the only event type that can be compiled
conditionally. Given that there is only little overhead I don't
understand the reasoning and I was annoyed more than once that gpio
events were not available without recompiling.

So drop the Kconfig symbol and make gpio events available
unconditionally.
