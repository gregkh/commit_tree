xfs: add missing error check in xfs_prepare_shift()

xfs_prepare_shift() fails to check the error return from
xfs_flush_unmap_range(). If the latter fails, that could lead to an
insert/collapse range operation over a delalloc range, which is not
supported.

Add an error check and return appropriately. This is reproduced
rarely by generic/475.
