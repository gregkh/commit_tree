media: ov7670: restore default settings after power-up

Since commit 3d6a8fe25605 ("media: ov7670: hook s_power onto v4l2 core"),
the device is actually powered off while the video stream is stopped.

The frame format and framerate are restored right after power-up, but
restoring the default register settings is forgotten.
