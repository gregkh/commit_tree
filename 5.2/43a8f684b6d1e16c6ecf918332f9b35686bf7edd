drm/i915: Reorder struct_mutex-vs-reset_lock in i915_gem_fault()

Annoyingly, struct_mutex was not entirely eliminated from the reset
pathway; for reasons of its own, intel_display_resume() requires
struct_mutex to prepare the planes it already captured. To avoid the
immediate problem of a deadlock between the struct_mutex and the reset
srcu, we have to acquire the reset_lock before struct_mutex in
i915_gem_fault(). Now any wait underneath struct_mutex will result us in
having to forcibly reset all inflight rendering, less than ideal, but
better than a deadlock (and will do for the short term).
