s390/kexec_file: Load new kernel to absolute 0

The leading 64 kB of a kernel image doesn't contain any data needed to boot
the new kernel when it was loaded via kexec_file. Thus kexec_file currently
strips them off before loading the image. Keep the leading 64 kB in order
to be able to pass a ipl_report to the next kernel.
