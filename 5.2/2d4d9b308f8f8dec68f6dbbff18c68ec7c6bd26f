powerpc/numa: improve control of topology updates

When booted with "topology_updates=no", or when "off" is written to
/proc/powerpc/topology_updates, NUMA reassignments are inhibited for
PRRN and VPHN events. However, migration and suspend unconditionally
re-enable reassignments via start_topology_update(). This is
incoherent.

Check the topology_updates_enabled flag in
start/stop_topology_update() so that callers of those APIs need not be
aware of whether reassignments are enabled. This allows the
administrative decision on reassignments to remain in force across
migrations and suspensions.
