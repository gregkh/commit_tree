bpf, libbpf: fix segfault in bpf_object__init_maps' pr_debug statement

Ran into it while testing; in bpf_object__init_maps() data can be NULL
in the case where no map section is present. Therefore we simply cannot
access data->d_size before NULL test. Move the pr_debug() where it's
safe to access.
