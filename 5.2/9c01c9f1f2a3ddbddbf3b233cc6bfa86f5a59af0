net: sched: always do stats accounting according to TCQ_F_CPUSTATS

The core sched implementation checks independently for NOLOCK flag
to acquire/release the root spin lock and for qdisc_is_percpu_stats()
to account per CPU values in many places.

This change update the last few places checking the TCQ_F_NOLOCK to
do per CPU stats accounting according to qdisc_is_percpu_stats()
value.

The above allows to clean dev_requeue_skb() implementation a bit
and makes stats update always consistent with a single flag.

v1 -> v2:
 - do not move qdisc_is_empty definition, fix build issue
