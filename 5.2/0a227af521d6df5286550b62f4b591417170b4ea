EDAC/amd64: Support more than two controllers for chip select handling

The struct chip_select array that's used for saving chip select bases
and masks is fixed at length of two. There should be one struct
chip_select for each controller, so this array should be increased to
support systems that may have more than two controllers.

Increase the size of the struct chip_select array to eight, which is the
largest number of controllers per die currently supported on AMD
systems.

Also, carve out the Family 17h+ reading of the bases/masks into a
separate function. This effectively reverts the original bases/masks
reading code to before Family 17h support was added.
