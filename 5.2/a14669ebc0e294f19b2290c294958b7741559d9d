lightnvm: Inherit mdts from the parent nvme device

Current lightnvm and pblk implementation does not care about NVMe max
data transfer size, which can be smaller than 64*K=256K. There are
existing NVMe controllers which NVMe max data transfer size is lower
that 256K (for example 128K, which happens for existing NVMe
controllers which are NVMe spec compliant). Such a controllers are not
able to handle command which contains 64 PPAs, since the the size of
DMAed buffer will be above the capabilities of such a controller.
