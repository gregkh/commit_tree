genirq: Prevent use-after-free and work list corruption

When irq_set_affinity_notifier() replaces the notifier, then the
reference count on the old notifier is dropped which causes it to be
freed. But nothing ensures that the old notifier is not longer queued
in the work list. If it is queued this results in a use after free and
possibly in work list corruption.

Ensure that the work is canceled before the reference is dropped.
