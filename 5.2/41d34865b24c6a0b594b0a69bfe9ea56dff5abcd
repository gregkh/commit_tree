RDMA/mthca: Use correct sizing on buffers holding page DMA addresses

The buffer that holds the page DMA addresses is sized off umem->nmap.
This can potentially cause out of bound accesses on the PBL array when
iterating the umem DMA-mapped SGL. This is because if umem pages are
combined, umem->nmap can be much lower than the number of system pages
in umem.

Use ib_umem_num_pages() to size this buffer.
