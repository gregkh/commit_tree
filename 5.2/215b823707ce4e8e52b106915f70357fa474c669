powerpc/32s: set up an early static hash table for KASAN.

KASAN requires early activation of hash table, before memblock()
functions are available.

This patch implements an early hash_table statically defined in
__initdata.

During early boot, a single page table is used.

For hash32, when doing the final init, one page table is allocated
for each PGD entry because of the _PAGE_HASHPTE flag which can't be
common to several virt pages. This is done after memblock get
available but before switching to the final hash table, otherwise
there are issues with TLB flushing due to the shared entries.
