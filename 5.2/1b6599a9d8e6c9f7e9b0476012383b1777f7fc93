perf intel-pt: Fix sample timestamp wrt non-taken branches

The sample timestamp is updated to ensure that the timestamp represents
the time of the sample and not a branch that the decoder is still
walking towards. The sample timestamp is updated when the decoder
returns, but the decoder does not return for non-taken branches. Update
the sample timestamp then also.

Note that commit 3f04d98e972b5 ("perf intel-pt: Improve sample
timestamp") was also a stable fix and appears, for example, in v4.4
stable tree as commit a4ebb58fd124 ("perf intel-pt: Improve sample
timestamp").
