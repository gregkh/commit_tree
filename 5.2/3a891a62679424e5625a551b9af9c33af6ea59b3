drm/i915: Move intel_engine_mask_t around for use by i915_request_types.h

We want to use intel_engine_mask_t inside i915_request.h, which means
extracting it from the general header file mess and placing it inside a
types.h. A knock on effect is that the compiler wants to warn about
type-contraction of ALL_ENGINES into intel_engine_maskt_t, so prepare
for the worst.

v2: Use intel_engine_mask_t consistently
v3: Move I915_NUM_ENGINES to its natural home at the end of the enum
