ARM: dts: Add l4 abe interconnect hierarchy and ti-sysc data for omap5

We can now add l4 abe interconnect hierarchy and ti-sysc data with
ti-sysc driver supporting external optional clocks needed by mcpdm.

This data is generated based on platform data from a booted system
and the interconnect acces protection registers for ranges. To avoid
regressions, we initially validate the device tree provided data
against the existing platform data on boot.

Note that mcpdm we now need to enable at module level only for devices
that have the external pdmclk wired from the PMIC as the clock is
needed for the module to be accessible.

Also note that abe seems to be the same as on omap4 except for domains
and clocks and we may be able to combine the l4 abe data later on.
But let's play it safe and just initially use what we have already
defined in the platform data.
