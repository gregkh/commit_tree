Bluetooth: Fix not initializing L2CAP tx_credits

l2cap_le_flowctl_init was reseting the tx_credits which works only for
outgoing connection since that set the tx_credits on the response, for
incoming connections that was not the case which leaves the channel
without any credits causing it to be suspended.
