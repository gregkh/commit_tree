PCI: designware-ep: Configure Resizable BAR cap to advertise the smallest size

Configure the Resizable BAR capability to advertise the smallest size
(1MB) for a couple of reasons:

- Host side resource allocation of BAR fails for larger sizes
- Endpoint function driver does not allocate memory for all supported
  sizes in the Resizable BAR capability.

If and when there is a usecase required to add more flexibility using
the Resizable BAR capability, this can be revisited.
