drm/drv: Fix incorrect resolution of merge conflict

Commit f06ddb53096b ("BackMerge v5.1-rc5 into drm-next") incorrectly
resolved a merge conflict related to a patch having been merged twice:
- commit 3f04e0a6cfeb ("drm: Fix drm_release() and device unplug")
  introduced as a standalone fix via drm-fixes branch,
- commit 1ee57d4d75fb ("drm: Fix drm_release() and device unplug")
  applied as patch 1/2 of a series on drm-next branch.
That incorrect resolution of the conflict effectively reverted a change
introduced to drivers/gpu/drm/drm_drv.c by patch 2/2 of that series -
commit ba3bf37e150a ("drm/drv: drm_dev_unplug(): Move out drm_dev_put()
call").  Fix it.
