pinctrl: sunxi: Allow to disable pinctrl drivers

Our pinctrl drivers are consisting of some common code, and big pin tables
that are SoC-specific. This is fine in most cases, but when you want to
reduce the size of the particular kernel image, those big tables are, well,
quite big.

We haven't had the option to disable them in the past since they were
hidden Kconfig options based on the SoC support. However, that granularity
isn't great since we don't have one Kconfig option per-SoC, but rather one
by family.

Make those options selectable by the user so that they can disable it if
needed, while keeping the current default to not change the standard case.
