gdbstub: mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

kernel/debug/gdbstub.c: In function ‘gdb_serial_stub’:
kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:1031:7: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
    if (remcom_in_buffer[1] == '\0') {
       ^
kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:1036:3: note: here
   case 'C': /* Exception passing */
   ^~~~
kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:1040:7: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
    if (tmp == 0)
       ^
kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:1043:3: note: here
   case 'c': /* Continue packet */
   ^~~~
kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:1050:4: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
    dbg_activate_sw_breakpoints();
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
kernel/debug/gdbstub.c:1052:3: note: here
   default:
   ^~~~~~~

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

Notice that, in this particular case, the code comment is modified
in accordance with what GCC is expecting to find.

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
