media: sound/usb: Use Media Controller API to share media resources

Media Device Allocator API to allows multiple drivers share a media device.
This API solves a very common use-case for media devices where one physical
device (an USB stick) provides both audio and video. When such media device
exposes a standard USB Audio class, a proprietary Video class, two or more
independent drivers will share a single physical USB bridge. In such cases,
it is necessary to coordinate access to the shared resource.

Using this API, drivers can allocate a media device with the shared struct
device as the key. Once the media device is allocated by a driver, other
drivers can get a reference to it. The media device is released when all
the references are released.

Change the ALSA driver to use the Media Controller API to share media
resources with DVB, and V4L2 drivers on a AU0828 media device.

The Media Controller specific initialization is done after sound card is
registered. ALSA creates Media interface and entity function graph nodes
for Control, Mixer, PCM Playback, and PCM Capture devices.

snd_usb_hw_params() will call Media Controller enable source handler
interface to request the media resource. If resource request is granted,
it will release it from snd_usb_hw_free(). If resource is busy, -EBUSY is
returned.

Media specific cleanup is done in usb_audio_disconnect().
