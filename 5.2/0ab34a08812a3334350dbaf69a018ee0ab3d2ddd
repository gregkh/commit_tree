media: si2165: fix a missing check of return value

si2165_readreg8() may fail. Looking into si2165_readreg8(), we will find
that "val_tmp" will be an uninitialized value when regmap_read() fails.
"val_tmp" is then assigned to "val". So if si2165_readreg8() fails,
"val" will be a random value. Further use will lead to undefined
behaviors. The fix checks if si2165_readreg8() fails, and if so, returns
its error code upstream.
