firmware: xilinx: fix debugfs write handler

 - Userspace wants to write a string with `len` bytes, not counting the
   terminating NULL, so we should allocate `len+1` bytes. It looks like the
   current code relied on having a nullbyte directly behind `kern_buff`,
   which happens to work reliably as long as `len` isn't one of the kmalloc
   size classes.
 - strncpy_from_user() is completely wrong here; userspace is giving us a
   (not necessarily null-terminated) buffer and its length.
   strncpy_from_user() is for cases in which we don't know the length.
 - Don't let broken userspace allocate arbitrarily big kmalloc allocations.

Just use memdup_user_nul(), which is designed precisely for things like
this.
