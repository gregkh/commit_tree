thunderbolt: Make rest of the logging to happen at debug level

Now that the driver can handle every possible tunnel types there is no
point to log everything as info level so turn these to happen at debug
level instead.

While at it remove duplicated tunnel activation log message
(tb_tunnel_activate() calls tb_tunnel_restart() which print the same
message) and add one missing '\n' termination.
