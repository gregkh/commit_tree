treewide: Add SPDX license identifier for more missed files

Add SPDX license identifiers to all files which:

 - Have no license information of any form

 - Have MODULE_LICENCE("GPL*") inside which was used in the initial
   scan/conversion to ignore the file

These files fall under the project license, GPL v2 only. The resulting SPDX
license identifier is:

  GPL-2.0-only
