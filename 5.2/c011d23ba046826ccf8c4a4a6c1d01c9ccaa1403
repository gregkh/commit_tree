kvm: fix compilation on aarch64

Commit e45adf665a53 ("KVM: Introduce a new guest mapping API", 2019-01-31)
introduced a build failure on aarch64 defconfig:

$ make -j$(nproc) ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- O=out defconfig \
                Image.gz
...
../arch/arm64/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:
    In function '__kvm_map_gfn':
../arch/arm64/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1763:9: error:
    implicit declaration of function 'memremap'; did you mean 'memset_p'?
../arch/arm64/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1763:46: error:
    'MEMREMAP_WB' undeclared (first use in this function)
../arch/arm64/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:
    In function 'kvm_vcpu_unmap':
../arch/arm64/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:1795:3: error:
    implicit declaration of function 'memunmap'; did you mean 'vm_munmap'?

because these functions are declared in <linux/io.h> rather than <asm/io.h>,
and the former was being pulled in already on x86 but not on aarch64.
