ice: Introduce bulk update for page count

{get,put}_page are atomic operations which we use for page count
handling. The current logic for refcount handling is that we increment
it when passing a skb with the data from the first half of page up to
netstack and recycle the second half of page. This operation protects us
from losing a page since the network stack can decrement the refcount of
page from skb.

The performance can be gently improved by doing the bulk updates of
refcount instead of doing it one by one. During the buffer initialization,
maximize the page's refcount and don't allow the refcount to become
less than two.
