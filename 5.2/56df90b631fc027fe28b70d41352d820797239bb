ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix for Lenovo B50-70 inverted internal microphone bug

Add patch for realtek codec in Lenovo B50-70 that fixes inverted
internal microphone channel.
Device IdeaPad Y410P has the same PCI SSID as Lenovo B50-70,
but first one is about fix the noise and it didn't seem help in a
later kernel version.
So I replaced IdeaPad Y410P device description with B50-70 and apply
inverted microphone fix.
