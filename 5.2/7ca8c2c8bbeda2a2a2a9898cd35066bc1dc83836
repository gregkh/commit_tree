staging: mt7621-mmc: Initialize completions a single time during probe

The module was initializing completions whenever it was going to wait on
them, and not when the completion was allocated.  This is incorrect
according to the completion docs:

    Calling init_completion() on the same completion object twice is
    most likely a bug [...]

Re-initialization is also unnecessary because the module never uses
complete_all().  Fix this by only ever initializing the completion a
single time, and log if the completions are not consumed as intended
(this is not a fatal problem, but should not go unnoticed).
