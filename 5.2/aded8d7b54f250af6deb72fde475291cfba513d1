NFS: Don't inadvertently clear writeback errors

vfs_fsync() has the side effect of clearing unreported writeback errors,
so we need to make sure that we do not abuse it in situations where
applications might not normally expect us to report those errors.

The solution is to replace calls to vfs_fsync() with calls to nfs_wb_all().
