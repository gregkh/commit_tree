Revert "MD: fix lock contention for flush bios"

This reverts commit 5a409b4f56d50b212334f338cb8465d65550cd85.

This patch has two problems.

1/ it make multiple calls to submit_bio() from inside a make_request_fn.
 The bios thus submitted will be queued on current->bio_list and not
 submitted immediately.  As the bios are allocated from a mempool,
 this can theoretically result in a deadlock - all the pool of requests
 could be in various ->bio_list queues and a subsequent mempool_alloc
 could block waiting for one of them to be released.

2/ It aims to handle a case when there are many concurrent flush requests.
  It handles this by submitting many requests in parallel - all of which
  are identical and so most of which do nothing useful.
  It would be more efficient to just send one lower-level request, but
  allow that to satisfy multiple upper-level requests.
