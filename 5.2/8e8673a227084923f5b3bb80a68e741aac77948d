net: dsa: sja1105: Fix status initialization in sja1105_get_ethtool_stats

Clang warns:

drivers/net/dsa/sja1105/sja1105_ethtool.c:316:39: warning: suggest
braces around initialization of subobject [-Wmissing-braces]
        struct sja1105_port_status status = {0};
                                             ^
                                             {}
1 warning generated.

One way to fix these warnings is to add additional braces like Clang
suggests; however, there has been a bit of push back from some
maintainers[1][2], who just prefer memset as it is unambiguous, doesn't
depend on a particular compiler version[3], and properly initializes all
subobjects. Do that here so there are no more warnings.
