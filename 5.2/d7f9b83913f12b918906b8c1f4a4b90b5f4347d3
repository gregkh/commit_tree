drm/vc4: Call drm_dev_register() after all setup is done

drm_dev_register() initializes internal clients like bootsplash as the
last thing it does, so all setup needs to be done at this point.

Fix by calling vc4_kms_load() before registering.
Also check the error code returned from that function.
