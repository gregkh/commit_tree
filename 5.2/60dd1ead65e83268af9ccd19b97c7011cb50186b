drivers: firmware: psci: Announce support for OS initiated suspend mode

PSCI firmware v1.0+, supports two different modes for CPU_SUSPEND.
The Platform Coordinated mode, which is the default and mandatory
mode, while support for the OS initiated (OSI) mode is optional.

In some cases it's interesting for the user/developer to know if
the OSI mode is supported by the PSCI FW, so print a message to
the log if that is the case.
