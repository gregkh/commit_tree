drm/amd/powerplay: Zero initialize num_of_levels in vega20_set_single_dpm_table

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../powerplay/vega20_ppt.c:456:2: warning:
variable 'num_of_levels' is used uninitialized whenever '?:' condition
is false [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

                                  = 0
1 warning generated.

The if statement it mentions as potentially problematic is currently
always true because the read_smc_arg callback is assigned at the
bottom of this file but Clang can't tell that. If the callback were
ever to disappear, num_of_levels would never be initialized. Just
zero initialize it to ensure that the intent behind this code
remains the same.
