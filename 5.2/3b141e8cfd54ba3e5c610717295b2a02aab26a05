scsi: ufs: Avoid configuring regulator with undefined voltage range

For regulators used by UFS, vcc, vccq and vccq2 will have voltage range
initialized by ufshcd_populate_vreg(), however other regulators may have
undefined voltage range if dt-bindings have no such definition.

In above undefined case, both "min_uV" and "max_uV" fields in ufs_vreg
struct will be zero values and these values will be configured on
regulators in different power modes.

Currently this may have no harm if both "min_uV" and "max_uV" always keep
"zero values" because regulator_set_voltage() will always bypass such
invalid values and return "good" results.

However improper values shall be fixed to avoid potential bugs.  Simply
bypass voltage configuration if voltage range is not defined.
