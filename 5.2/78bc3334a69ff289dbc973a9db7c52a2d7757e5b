fs/quota: erase unused but set variable warning

Local variable *reserved* of remove_dquot_ref() is only used if
define CONFIG_QUOTA_DEBUG, but not ebraced in CONFIG_QUOTA_DEBUG
macro, which leads to unused-but-set-variable warning when compiling.

This patch ebrace it into CONFIG_QUOTA_DEBUG macro like what is done
in add_dquot_ref().
