mm/mlock.c: mlockall error for flag MCL_ONFAULT

If mlockall() is called with only MCL_ONFAULT as flag, it removes any
previously applied lockings and does nothing else.

This behavior is counter-intuitive and doesn't match the Linux man page.

  For mlockall():

  EINVAL Unknown flags were specified or MCL_ONFAULT was specified
  without either MCL_FUTURE or MCL_CURRENT.

Consequently, return the error EINVAL, if only MCL_ONFAULT is passed.
That way, applications will at least detect that they are calling
mlockall() incorrectly.
