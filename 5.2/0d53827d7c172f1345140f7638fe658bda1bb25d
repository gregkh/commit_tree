thunderbolt: Implement CIO reset correctly for Titan Ridge

When starting ICM firmware on Apple systems we need to perform CIO reset
as part of the flow. However, it turns out that the reset register has
changed to another location in Titan Ridge.

Fix this by introducing ->cio_reset() callback with corresponding
implementations for Alpine and Titan Ridge.
