locking/lock_events: Make lock_events available for all archs & other locks

The QUEUED_LOCK_STAT option to report queued spinlocks event counts
was previously allowed only on x86 architecture. To make the locking
event counting code more useful, it is now renamed to a more generic
LOCK_EVENT_COUNTS config option. This new option will be available to
all the architectures that use qspinlock at the moment.

Other locking code can now start to use the generic locking event
counting code by including lock_events.h and put the new locking event
names into the lock_events_list.h header file.

My experience with lock event counting is that it gives valuable insight
on how the locking code works and what can be done to make it better. I
would like to extend this benefit to other locking code like mutex and
rwsem in the near future.

The PV qspinlock specific code will stay in qspinlock_stat.h. The
locking event counters will now reside in the <debugfs>/lock_event_counts
directory.
