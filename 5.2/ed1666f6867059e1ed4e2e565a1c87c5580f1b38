ASoC: mediatek: Fix UBSAN warning.

In sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-afe-fe-dai.c, when xxx_reg is -1, it's
a no-op to call mtk_regmap_update_bits, but since both xxx_reg and
xxx_shift are set to -1, the (1 << xxx_shift) in the argument would
trigger a UBSAN warning.

Fix the warning by setting those xxx_shift to 0 instead.

Note that since the code explicitly checks .mono_shift >= 0 and
.fs_shift >= 0 before using them in '<<' operator, those two members are
not set to 0.
