bpf: sockmap fix msg->sg.size account on ingress skb

When converting a skb to msg->sg we forget to set the size after the
latest ktls/tls code conversion. This patch can be reached by doing
a redir into ingress path from BPF skb sock recv hook. Then trying to
read the size fails.

Fix this by setting the size.
