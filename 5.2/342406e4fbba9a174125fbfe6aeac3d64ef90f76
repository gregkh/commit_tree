drm/nouveau/i2c: Disable i2c bus access after ->fini()

For a while, we've had the problem of i2c bus access not grabbing
a runtime PM ref when it's being used in userspace by i2c-dev, resulting
in nouveau spamming the kernel log with errors if anything attempts to
access the i2c bus while the GPU is in runtime suspend. An example:

[  130.078386] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: i2c: aux 000d: begin idle timeout ffffffff

Since the GPU is in runtime suspend, the MMIO region that the i2c bus is
on isn't accessible. On x86, the standard behavior for accessing an
unavailable MMIO region is to just return ~0.

Except, that turned out to be a lie. While computers with a clean
concious will return ~0 in this scenario, some machines will actually
completely hang a CPU on certian bad MMIO accesses. This was witnessed
with someone's Lenovo ThinkPad P50, where sensors-detect attempting to
access the i2c bus while the GPU was suspended would result in a CPU
hang:

  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#5 stuck for 23s! [sensors-detect:12438]

Yikes! While I wanted to try to make it so that accessing an i2c bus on
nouveau would wake up the GPU as needed, airlied pointed out that pretty
much any usecase for userspace accessing an i2c bus on a GPU (mainly for
the DDC brightness control that some displays have) is going to only be
useful while there's at least one display enabled on the GPU anyway, and
the GPU never sleeps while there's displays running.

Since teaching the i2c bus to wake up the GPU on userspace accesses is a
good deal more difficult than it might seem, mostly due to the fact that
we have to use the i2c bus during runtime resume of the GPU, we instead
opt for the easiest solution: don't let userspace access i2c busses on
the GPU at all while it's in runtime suspend.

Changes since v1:
* Also disable i2c busses that run over DP AUX
