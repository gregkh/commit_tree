net: sched: cls_u32: use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace code of the following form:

sizeof(*s) + s->nkeys*sizeof(struct tc_u32_key)

with:

struct_size(s, keys, s->nkeys)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
