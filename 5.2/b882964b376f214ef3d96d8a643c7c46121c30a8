clk: meson: meson8b: add support for the GP_PLL clock on Meson8m2

Meson8m2 has a GP_PLL clock (similar to GP0_PLL on GXBB/GXL/GXM) which
is used as input for the VPU clocks.
The only supported frequency (based on Amlogic's vendor kernel sources)
is 364MHz which is achieved using the following parameters:
- input: XTAL (24MHz)
- M = 182
- N = 3
- OD = 2 ^ 2
