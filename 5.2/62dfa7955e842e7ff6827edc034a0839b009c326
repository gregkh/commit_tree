RDMA/core: Restrict sysfs entries view to init_net

This is a preparation patch to provide isolation of rdma device in a
network namespace.

As first step, make rdma device visible only in init net namespace.
Subsequent patch will enable rdma device visibility back in multiple net
namespaces using compat ib_core_device device/sysfs tree.

Given that the IB subsystem depends on net stack, it needs to be
initialized after netdev and since it support devices, it needs to be
initialized before the device subsystem; therefore, change initcall
sequence to fs_initcall, so that when ib_core is compiled in the kernel
image, the right init sequence is followed.
