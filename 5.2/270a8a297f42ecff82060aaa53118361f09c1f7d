netfilter: nft_flow_offload: add entry to flowtable after confirmation

This is fixing flow offload for UDP traffic where packets only follow
one single direction.

The flow_offload_fixup_tcp() mechanism works fine in case that the
offloaded entry remains in SYN_RECV state, given sequence tracking is
reset and that conntrack handles syn+ack packets as a retransmission, ie.

	sES + synack => sIG

for reply traffic.
