spi: sh-msiof: Convert to use GPIO descriptors

Convert GPIO chip selects in the Renesas MSIOF SPI driver from legacy
GPIO numbers to GPIO descriptors.

Notes:
  - The board file for the SH7724-based Ecovec24 development board now
    registers a GPIO descriptor lookup, instead of passing a GPIO number
    through controller_data,
  - sh_msiof_get_cs_gpios() must release all GPIOs, else
    spi_get_gpio_descs() cannot claim them during SPI controller
    registration.
