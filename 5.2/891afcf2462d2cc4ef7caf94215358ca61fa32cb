ALSA: hda/realtek - Corrected fixup for System76 Gazelle (gaze14)

A mistake was made in the identification of the four variants of the
System76 Gazelle (gaze14). This patch corrects the PCI ID of the
17-inch, GTX 1660 Ti variant from 0x8560 to 0x8551. This patch also
adds the correct fixups for the 15-inch and 17-inch GTX 1650 variants
with PCI IDs 0x8560 and 0x8561.

Tests were done on all four variants ensuring full audio capability.
