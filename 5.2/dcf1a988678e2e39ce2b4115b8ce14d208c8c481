drm/amd/display: Fix exception from AUX acquire failure

[Why]
AUX arbitration occurs between SW and FW components.
When AUX acquire fails, it causes engine->ddc to be NULL,
which leads to an exception when we try to release the AUX
engine.

[How]
When AUX engine acquire fails, it should return from the
function without trying to continue the operation.
The upper level will determine if it wants to retry.
i.e. dce_aux_transfer_with_retries will be used and retry.
