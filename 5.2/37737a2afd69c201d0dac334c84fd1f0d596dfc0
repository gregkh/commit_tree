powerpc/32: move LOAD_MSR_KERNEL() into head_32.h and use it

As preparation for using head_32.h for head_40x.S, move
LOAD_MSR_KERNEL() there and use it to load r10 with MSR_KERNEL value.

In the mean time, this patch modifies it so that it takes into account
the size of the passed value to determine if 'li' can be used or if
'lis/ori' is needed instead of using the size of MSR_KERNEL. This is
done by using gas macro.
