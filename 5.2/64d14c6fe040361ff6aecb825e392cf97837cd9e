mtd: maps: physmap: Store gpio_values correctly

When the gpio-addr-flash.c driver was merged with physmap-core.c the
code to store the current gpio_values was lost. This meant that once a
gpio was asserted it was never de-asserted. Fix this by storing the
current offset in gpio_values like the old driver used to.
