ALSA: fireface: Use ULL suffixes for 64-bit constants

With gcc 4.1:

    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c: In function ‘latter_switch_fetching_mode’:
    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c:97: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c: In function ‘latter_begin_session’:
    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c:170: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c:197: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c:205: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c: In function ‘latter_finish_session’:
    sound/firewire/fireface/ff-protocol-latter.c:214: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type

Fix this by adding the missing "ULL" suffixes.
Add the same suffix to the last constant, to maintain consistency.
