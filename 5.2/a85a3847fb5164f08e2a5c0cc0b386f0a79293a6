ice: Always free/allocate q_vectors

Currently when probing/removing the driver we allocate/deallocate
each vsi->q_vectors array in ice_vsi_alloc_arrays() and
ice_vsi_free_arrays() respectively. However, we don't do this
during the reset and VSI rebuild flow. This is inconsistent
and unnecessary to have a difference between the two flows.

This patch makes the change to always allocate/deallocate the
vsi->q_vectors array regardless of the driver flow we are in.

Also, update the comment for ice_vsi_free_arrays() to be more
descriptive.
