btrfs: Always pass 0 bio_offset for btree_submit_bio_start

The btree submit hook queues the async csum and forwards the bio_offset
parameter passed to btree_submit_bio_hook. This is redundant since
btree_submit_bio_start calls btree_csum_one_bio which doesn't use the
offset at all. No functional changes.
