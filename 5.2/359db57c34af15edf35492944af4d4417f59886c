arm64: compat: Reduce address limit for 64K pages

With the introduction of the config option that allows to enable kuser
helpers, it is now possible to reduce TASK_SIZE_32 when these are
disabled and 64K pages are enabled. This extends the compliance with
the section 6.5.8 of the C standard (C99).
