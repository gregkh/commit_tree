riscv: move switch_mm to its own file

switch_mm is an expensive operations that has two users.
flush_icache_deferred is only called within switch_mm and can be moved
together. The function is expected to be more complicated when ASID
support is added, so clean up eagerly.

By moving them to a separate file we also removes some excessive
dependency of tlbflush.h and cacheflush.h.
