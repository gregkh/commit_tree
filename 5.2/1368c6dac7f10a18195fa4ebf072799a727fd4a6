btrfs: Make compress_file_range take only struct async_chunk

All context this function needs is held within struct async_chunk.
Currently we not only pass the struct but also every individual member.
This is redundant, simplify it by only passing struct async_chunk and
leaving it to compress_file_range to extract the values it requires.
No functional changes.
