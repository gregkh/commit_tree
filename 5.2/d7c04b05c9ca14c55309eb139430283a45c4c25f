net: avoid weird emergency message

When host is under high stress, it is very possible thread
running netdev_wait_allrefs() returns from msleep(250)
10 seconds late.

This leads to these messages in the syslog :

[...] unregister_netdevice: waiting for syz_tun to become free. Usage count = 0

If the device refcount is zero, the wait is over.
