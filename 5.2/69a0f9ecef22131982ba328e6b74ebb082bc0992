bpf, bpftool: fix a few ubsan warnings

The issue is reported at https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/issues/28.

Basically, per C standard, for
  void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n)
if "dest" or "src" is NULL, regardless of whether "n" is 0 or not,
the result of memcpy is undefined. clang ubsan reported three such
instances in bpf.c with the following pattern:
  memcpy(dest, 0, 0).

Although in practice, no known compiler will cause issues when
copy size is 0. Let us still fix the issue to silence ubsan
warnings.
