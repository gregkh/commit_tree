RDMA/iw_cxgb4: Always disconnect when QP is transitioning to TERMINATE state

On receiving a TERM from tje peer, Host moves the QP to TERMINATE state
and then moves the adapter out of RDMA mode. After issuing a TERM, peer
issues a CLOSE and at this point of time if the connectivity between peer
and host is lost for a significant amount of time, the QP remains in
TERMINATE state.

Therefore c4iw_modify_qp() needs to initiate a close on entering terminate
state.
