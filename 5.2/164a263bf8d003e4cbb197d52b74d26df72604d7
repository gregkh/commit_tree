ASoC: Intel: Make boards more available for compile test

The Intel boards have very strict dependencies which make them less
available for compile test than is desirable, with requirements for
specific drivers that are only needed at runtime but not at build time.
Relax this a bit if COMPILE_TEST is enabled to improve build coverage
for these drivers.
