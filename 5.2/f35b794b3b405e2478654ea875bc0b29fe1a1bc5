ipv4: Prepare fib_config for IPv6 gateway

Similar to rtable, fib_config needs to allow the gateway to be either an
IPv4 or an IPv6 address. To that end, rename fc_gw to fc_gw4 to mean an
IPv4 address and add fc_gw_family. Checks on 'is a gateway set' are changed
to see if fc_gw_family is set. In the process prepare the code for a
fc_gw_family == AF_INET6.
