drm/i915: Avoid using ctx->file_priv during construction

As we only set ctx->file_priv on registering the GEM context after
construction, it is invalid to try and use it in the middle for setting
various parameters. Indeed, we put the file_priv into struct create_ext
so that we have the right file_private available without having to look
at ctx->file_priv. However, it helps to use it!
