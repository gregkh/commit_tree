net: ethernet: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: enable support of unicast filtering

When adding more MAC addresses to a dwmac-sun8i interface, the device goes
directly in promiscuous mode.
This is due to IFF_UNICAST_FLT missing flag.

So since the hardware support unicast filtering, let's add IFF_UNICAST_FLT.
