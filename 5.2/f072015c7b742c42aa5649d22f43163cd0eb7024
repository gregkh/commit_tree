powerpc: disable KASAN instrumentation on early/critical files.

All files containing functions run before kasan_early_init() is called
must have KASAN instrumentation disabled.

For those file, branch profiling also have to be disabled otherwise
each if () generates a call to ftrace_likely_update().
