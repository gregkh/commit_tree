mm/vmalloc: Fix calculation of direct map addr range

The calculation of the direct map address range to flush was wrong.
This could cause the RO direct map alias to not get flushed. Today
this shouldn't be a problem because this flush is only needed on x86
right now and the spurious fault handler will fix cached RO->RW
translations. In the future though, it could cause the permissions
to remain RO in the TLB for the direct map alias, and then the page
would return from the page allocator to some other component as RO
and cause a crash.

So fix fix the address range calculation so the flush will include the
direct map range.
