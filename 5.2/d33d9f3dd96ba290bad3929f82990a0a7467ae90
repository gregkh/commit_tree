percpu: use chunk scan_hint to skip some scanning

Just like blocks, chunks now maintain a scan_hint. This can be used to
skip some scanning by promoting the scan_hint to be the contig_hint.
The chunk's scan_hint is primarily updated on the backside and relies on
full scanning when a block becomes free or the free region spans across
blocks.
