rcu: validate arguments for rcu tracepoints

When CONFIG_RCU_TRACE is not set, all these tracepoints are defined as
do-nothing macro.
We'd better make those inline functions that take proper arguments.

As RCU_TRACE() is defined as do-nothing marco as well when
CONFIG_RCU_TRACE is not set, so we can clean it up.
