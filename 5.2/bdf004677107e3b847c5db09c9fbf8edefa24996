net: Replace nhc_has_gw with nhc_gw_family

Allow the gateway in a fib_nh_common to be from a different address
family than the outer fib{6}_nh. To that end, replace nhc_has_gw with
nhc_gw_family and update users of nhc_has_gw to check nhc_gw_family.
Now nhc_family is used to know if the nh_common is part of a fib_nh
or fib6_nh (used for container_of to get to route family specific data),
and nhc_gw_family represents the address family for the gateway.
