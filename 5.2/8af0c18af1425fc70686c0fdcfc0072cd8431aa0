include/: refactor headers to allow kthread.h inclusion in psi_types.h

kthread.h can't be included in psi_types.h because it creates a circular
inclusion with kthread.h eventually including psi_types.h and
complaining on kthread structures not being defined because they are
defined further in the kthread.h.  Resolve this by removing psi_types.h
inclusion from the headers included from kthread.h.
