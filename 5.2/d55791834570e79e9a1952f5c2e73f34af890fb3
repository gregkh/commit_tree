PCI/AER: Replace dev_printk(KERN_DEBUG) with dev_info()

Replace dev_printk(KERN_DEBUG) with dev_info() or dev_err() to be more
consistent with other logging.

These could be converted to dev_dbg(), but that depends on
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG and DEBUG, and we want most of these messages to
*always* be in the dmesg log.

Also remove a redundant kzalloc() failure message.
