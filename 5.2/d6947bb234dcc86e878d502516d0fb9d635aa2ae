ASoC: hda: fix unbalanced codec dev refcount for HDA_DEV_ASOC

HDA_DEV_ASOC type codec device refcounts are managed differently
from HDA_DEV_LEGACY devices. The refcount is released explicitly
in snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_remove() for ASOC type devices.
So, remove the put_device() call in snd_hda_codec_dev_free()
for such devices to make the refcount balanced. This will prevent
the NULL pointer exception when the codec driver is released
after the card is freed.
