s390/qeth: cache max number of available buffer elements

The QETH_MAX_BUFFER_ELEMENTS() macro effectively returns a constant
value. To avoid some redundant pointer chasing and computations in the
xmit hot path, cache this value in the queue struct.

Take this as opportunity to shrink some of the queue struct's fields to
their appropriate value range, slightly reducing its total size.
