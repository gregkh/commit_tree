drm/i915: add GEN2_ prefix to the I{E, I, M, S}R registers

This discussion started because we use token pasting in the
GEN{2,3}_IRQ_INIT and GEN{2,3}_IRQ_RESET macros, so gen2-4 passes an
empty argument to those macros, making the code a little weird. The
original proposal was to just add a comment as the empty argument, but
Ville suggested we just add a prefix to the registers, and that indeed
sounds like a more elegant solution.

Now doing this is kinda against our rules for register naming since we
only add gens or platform names as register prefixes when the given
gen/platform changes a register that already existed before. On the
other hand, we have so many instances of IIR/IMR in comments that
adding a prefix would make the users of these register more easily
findable, in addition to make our token pasting macros actually
readable. So IMHO opening an exception here is worth it.
