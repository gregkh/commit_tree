fib_rules: return 0 directly if an exactly same rule exists when NLM_F_EXCL not supplied

With commit 153380ec4b9 ("fib_rules: Added NLM_F_EXCL support to
fib_nl_newrule") we now able to check if a rule already exists. But this
only works with iproute2. For other tools like libnl, NetworkManager,
it still could add duplicate rules with only NLM_F_CREATE flag, like

[localhost ~ ]# ip rule
0:      from all lookup local
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default
100000: from 192.168.7.5 lookup 5
100000: from 192.168.7.5 lookup 5

As it doesn't make sense to create two duplicate rules, let's just return
0 if the rule exists.
