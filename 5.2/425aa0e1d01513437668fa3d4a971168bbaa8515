ip_sockglue: Fix missing-check bug in ip_ra_control()

In function ip_ra_control(), the pointer new_ra is allocated a memory
space via kmalloc(). And it is used in the following codes. However,
when  there is a memory allocation error, kmalloc() fails. Thus null
pointer dereference may happen. And it will cause the kernel to crash.
Therefore, we should check the return value and handle the error.
