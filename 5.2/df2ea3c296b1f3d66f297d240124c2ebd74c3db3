drm/i915/gvt: use cmd to restore in-context mmios to hw for gen9 platform

for restore-inhibit context, hardware will not load in-context mmios
(engine context part) to hardware, but hardware will save the mmio
values in hardware back to context image. So, in order to save correct
values of vGPU back to context image, values of vGPU mmios have to be
loaded into hardware first for restore-inhibit context.

In this patch, the mechanism is applied to all gen9 platform.

The reason excluding gen8 platforms is only because of lacking of testing
on those platforms.

v3: for mocs registers, goto in-context mmios save-restore path for skl
platform as well (weinan li)
v2: update vreg when scanning indirect context for inhibit context for
gen9
