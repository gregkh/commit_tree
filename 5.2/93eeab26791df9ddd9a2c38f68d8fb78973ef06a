qtnfmac: update bands information on CHANGE_INTF command

In some regions, different regulatory limits (like max Tx power) may be
defined for different operating modes. As an example: in ETSI regions
DFS master devices may use higher transmit powers compared to DFS slave
devices. Update bands information in CHANGE_INTF command if mode of
operation changes.
