media: vsp1: drm: Implement writeback support

Extend the vsp1_du_atomic_flush() API with writeback support by adding
format, pitch and memory addresses of the writeback framebuffer.
Writeback completion is reported through the existing frame completion
callback with a new VSP1_DU_STATUS_WRITEBACK status flag.
