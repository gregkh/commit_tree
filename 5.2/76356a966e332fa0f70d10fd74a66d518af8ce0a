drm: aspeed: Clean up Kconfig options

The GFX IP is inside of the ASPEED BMC SoC so there is little use
enabling it on a kernel that does not support ASPEED.

When building with COMPILE_TEST the architecture many not have CMA
support, so to avoid breaking the build we only select these options if
the architecture supports the contiguous allocator.

I suspect the DRM_PANEL came from a cut/paste error.
