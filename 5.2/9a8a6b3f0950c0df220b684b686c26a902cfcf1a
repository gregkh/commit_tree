crypto: testmgr - fuzz hashes against their generic implementation

When the extra crypto self-tests are enabled, test each hash algorithm
against its generic implementation when one is available.  This
involves: checking the algorithm properties for consistency, then
randomly generating test vectors using the generic implementation and
running them against the implementation under test.  Both good and bad
inputs are tested.

This has already detected a bug in the x86 implementation of poly1305,
bugs in crct10dif, and an inconsistency in cbcmac.
