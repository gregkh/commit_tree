ARM: vdso: Remove dependency with the arch_timer driver internals

The VDSO code uses the kernel helper that was originally designed
to abstract the access between 32 and 64bit systems. It worked so
far because this function is declared as 'inline'.

As we're about to revamp that part of the code, the VDSO would
break. Let's fix it by doing what should have been done from
the start, a proper system register access.
