dt-bindings: phy: qcom-ufs: Add resets property

Add a resets property to the PHY that represents the PHY reset
register in the UFS controller itself. This better describes the
complete specification of the PHY, and allows the PHY to perform
its initialization in a single function, rather than relying on
back-channel sequencing of initialization through the PHY framework.
