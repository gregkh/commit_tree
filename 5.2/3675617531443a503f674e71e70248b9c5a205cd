dsa: Make use of the list of tag drivers

Implement the _get and _put functions to make use of the list of tag
drivers. Also, trigger the loading of the module, based on the alias
information. The _get function takes a reference on the tag driver, so
it cannot be unloaded, and the _put function releases the reference.
