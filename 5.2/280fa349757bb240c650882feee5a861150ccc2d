ARM: dts: rockchip: Add BT_EN to the power sequence for veyron

Add GPIO D5 (BT_ENABLE_L) as reset-GPIO to the power sequence for the
Bluetooth/WiFi module. On devices with a Broadcom module the signal
needs to be asserted to use Bluetooth.

Note that BT_ENABLE_L is a misnomer in the schematics, the signal
actually is active-high.
