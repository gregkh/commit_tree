arm64: dts: rockchip: eMMC additions for rk3328-roc-cc

The eMMC 5.x that Libre Computer provide for their boards supports HS200 mode.
The support is already included in the dts for their newest board:

La Frite (AML-S805X-AC)
dts: arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic/meson-gxl-s805x-libretech-ac.dts

That same eMMC is supported in the ROC-RK3328-CC:

This increases the speed of the eMMC significantly.
