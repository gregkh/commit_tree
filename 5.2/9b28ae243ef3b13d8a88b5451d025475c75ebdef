bpf: fix out-of-bounds read in __bpf_skc_lookup

__bpf_skc_lookup takes a socket tuple and the length of the
tuple as an argument. Based on the length, it decides which
address family to pass to the helper function sk_lookup.

In case of AF_INET6, it fails to verify that the length
of the tuple is long enough. sk_lookup may therefore access
data past the end of the tuple.
