net/mlx5: Allocate root ns memory using kzalloc to match kfree

root ns is yet another fs core node which is freed using kfree() by
tree_put_node().
Rest of the other fs core objects are also allocated using kmalloc
variants.

However, root ns memory is allocated using kvzalloc().
Hence allocate root ns memory using kzalloc().
