s390/qdio: consolidate index tracking for queue scan

qdio.ko offers a small number of high-level functions to drive the
scanning of a QDIO queue for ready-to-process SBALs:
qdio_get_next_buffers(), __[ti]qdio_inbound_processing() and
__qdio_outbound_processing().

Let each of those functions maintain the 'start' index for their current
scan, and pass it to lower-level helpers as needed. This improves the
code's overall layering, and allows us to eliminate the additional
first_to_kick cursor with a follow-on patch.
