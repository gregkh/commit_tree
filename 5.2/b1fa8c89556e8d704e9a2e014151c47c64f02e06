drm/amdgpu: Add sysfs entries  for xgmi hive v2.

For each device a file xgmi_device_id is created.
On the first device a subdirectory named xgmi_hive_info is created,
It contains  a file named hive_id and symlinks named node 1-4 linking
to each device in the hive.

v2: Return error codes instead of '-1' and few misspellings.
