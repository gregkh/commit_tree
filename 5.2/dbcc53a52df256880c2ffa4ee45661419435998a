xprtrdma: Clean up sendctx functions

Minor clean-ups I've stumbled on since sendctx was merged last year.
In particular, making Send completion processing more efficient
appears to have a measurable impact on IOPS throughput.

Note: test_and_clear_bit() returns a value, thus an explicit memory
barrier is not necessary.
