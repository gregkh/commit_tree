thunderbolt: Discover preboot PCIe paths the boot firmware established

In Apple Macs the boot firmware (EFI) connects all devices automatically
when the system is started, before it hands over to the OS. Instead of
ignoring we discover all those PCIe tunnels and record them using our
internal structures, just like we do when a device is connected after
the OS is already up.

By doing this we can properly tear down tunnels when devices are
disconnected. Also this allows us to resume the existing tunnels after
system suspend/resume cycle.
