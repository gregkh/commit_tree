ceph: use pathlen values returned by set_request_path_attr

We make copies of the dentry name in set_request_path_attr, but then
create_request_message re-fetches the lengths out of the dentry. While
we don't currently set the *_drop fields unless the parents are locked,
it's still better not to rely on that sort of implicit assumption.

Use the pathlen values that set_request_path_attr returned instead, as
they will always be correct for the returned paths themselves.
