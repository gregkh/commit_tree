drm/rockchip: shutdown drm subsystem on shutdown

As explained by Robin Murphy:

We had a more radical approach before in commit
7f3ef5dedb14 ("drm/rockchip: Allow driver to be shutdown on reboot/kexec")
but that resulted in new warnings and oopses on shutdown on rk3399
chromeos devices.

So second try is resurrecting Vicentes shutdown change which should
achieve the same result but in a less drastic way.
