RISC-V: Add RISC-V specific arch_match_cpu_phys_id

OF/DT core has a hook for architecture specific logical cpuid to hartid
mapping. By implementing this, we can pass the logical cpu id to cpu
node parsing functions.

Fix the instances where logical cpuid is expected as an argument in
of_get_cpu_node.
