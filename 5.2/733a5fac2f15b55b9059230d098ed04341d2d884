xfrm: remove afinfo pointer from xfrm_mode

Adds an EXPORT_SYMBOL for afinfo_get_rcu, as it will now be called from
ipv6 in case of CONFIG_IPV6=m.

This change has virtually no effect on vmlinux size, but it reduces
afinfo size and allows followup patch to make xfrm modes const.

v2: mark if (afinfo) tests as likely (Sabrina)
    re-fetch afinfo according to inner_mode in xfrm_prepare_input().
