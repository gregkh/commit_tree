genirq/devres: Use struct_size() in devm_kzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct foo {
    int stuff;
    struct boo entry[];
};

size = sizeof(struct foo) + count * sizeof(struct boo);
instance = devm_kzalloc(dev, size, GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper.

instance = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(instance, entry, count), GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
