rcu: Inline RCU task stall-warning helper functions

The rcu_print_detail_task_stall(), rcu_print_task_stall_begin(), and
rcu_print_task_stall_end() functions were defined to allow long-gone
Kconfig options to provide an abbreviated RCU CPU stall warning printout.
This commit saves a few lines of code by inlining them into their sole
callers.

While in the area, a useless call of rcu_print_detail_task_stall_rnp()
on the root rcu_node structure was eliminated.  If there is only one
rcu_node structure, its tasks get printed twice, but if there are more,
the root rcu_node structure is guaranteed to have an empty list of blocked
tasks, hence the uselessness.  (Long ago, root rcu_node structures with
non-empty ->blkd_tasks lists could happen, but no longer.)
