mmc: core: fix possible use after free of host

In the function mmc_alloc_host, the function put_device is called to
release allocated resources when mmc_gpio_alloc fails. Finally, the
function pointed by host->class_dev.class->dev_release (i.e.,
mmc_host_classdev_release) is used to release resources including the
host structure. However, after put_device, host is used and released
again. Resulting in a use-after-free bug.
