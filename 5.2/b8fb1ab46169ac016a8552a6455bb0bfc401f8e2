net ipv6: Prevent neighbor add if protocol is disabled on device

Disabling IPv6 on an interface removes existing entries but nothing prevents
new entries from being manually added. To that end, add a new neigh_table
operation, allow_add, that is called on RTM_NEWNEIGH to see if neighbor
entries are allowed on a given device. If IPv6 is disabled on the device,
allow_add returns false and passes a message back to the user via extack.

  $ echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth1/disable_ipv6
  $ ip -6 neigh add fe80::4c88:bff:fe21:2704 dev eth1 lladdr de:ad:be:ef:01:01
  Error: IPv6 is disabled on this device.
