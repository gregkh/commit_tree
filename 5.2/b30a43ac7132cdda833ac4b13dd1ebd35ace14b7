drm/nouveau: add kconfig option to turn off nouveau legacy contexts. (v3)

There was a nouveau DDX that relied on legacy context ioctls to work,
but we fixed it years ago, give distros that have a modern DDX the
option to break the uAPI and close the mess of holes that legacy
context support is.

    drm: Turn off Legacy Context Functions

    The context functions are not used by the i915 driver and should not
    be used by modeset drivers. These driver functions contain several bugs
    and security holes. This change makes these functions optional can be
    turned on by a setting, they are turned off by default for modeset
    driver with the exception of the nouvea driver that may require them with
    an old version of libdrm.

    The previous attempt was

    v3:
    - s/Nova/nouveau/ in the commit message, and add references to the

    - drop the part touching the drm hw lock, that should be a separate
      patch.
