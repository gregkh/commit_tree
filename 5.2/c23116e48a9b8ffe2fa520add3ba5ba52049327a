crypto: caam/jr - Remove extra memory barrier during job ring enqueue

In caam_jr_enqueue(), a write barrier is needed to order stores to job
ring slot before declaring addition of new job into input job ring.
The register write is done using wr_reg32() which internally uses
iowrite32() for write operation. The api iowrite32() issues a write
barrier before issuing write operation. Therefore, the wmb() preceding
wr_reg32() can be safely removed.
