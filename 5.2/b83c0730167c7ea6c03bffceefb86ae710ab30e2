net/mlx5e: Fix source port matching in fdb peer flow rule

The cited commit changed the initialization placement of the eswitch
attributes so it is done prior to parse tc actions function call,
including among others the in_rep and in_mdev fields which are mistakenly
reassigned inside the parse actions function.

This breaks the source port matching criteria of the peer redirect rule.

Fix by removing the now redundant reassignment of the already initialized
fields.
