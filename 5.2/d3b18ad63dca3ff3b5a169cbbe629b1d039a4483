dt-bindings: arm: coresight: Unify funnel DT binding

Following the same fashion with replicator DT binding, this patch is to
unify the DT binding for funnel to support static and dynamic modes;
finally we get the funnel DT binding as below:

Before patch:

  Static funnel, aka. non-configurable funnel:
    Not supported;

  Dynamic funnel, aka. configurable funnel:
    "arm,coresight-funnel", "arm,primecell";

After patch:

  Static funnel:
    "arm,coresight-static-funnel";

  Dynamic funnel:
    "arm,coresight-dynamic-funnel", "arm,primecell";
    "arm,coresight-funnel", "arm,primecell"; (obsolete)

At the end of this patch, it gives an example for static funnel DT
binding, and updates the dynamic funnel example.
