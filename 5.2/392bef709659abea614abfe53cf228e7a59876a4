x86/build: Move _etext to actual end of .text

When building x86 with Clang LTO and CFI, CFI jump regions are
automatically added to the end of the .text section late in linking. As a
result, the _etext position was being labelled before the appended jump
regions, causing confusion about where the boundaries of the executable
region actually are in the running kernel, and broke at least the fault
injection code. This moves the _etext mark to outside (and immediately
after) the .text area, as it already the case on other architectures
(e.g. arm64, arm).
