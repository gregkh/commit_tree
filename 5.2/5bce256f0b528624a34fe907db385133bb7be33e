usb: xhci: Fix a potential null pointer dereference in xhci_debugfs_create_endpoint()

In xhci_debugfs_create_slot(), kzalloc() can fail and
dev->debugfs_private will be NULL.
In xhci_debugfs_create_endpoint(), dev->debugfs_private is used without
any null-pointer check, and can cause a null pointer dereference.

To fix this bug, a null-pointer check is added in
xhci_debugfs_create_endpoint().

This bug is found by a runtime fuzzing tool named FIZZER written by us.
