xfrm: store xfrm_mode directly, not its address

This structure is now only 4 bytes, so its more efficient
to cache a copy rather than its address.

No significant size difference in allmodconfig vmlinux.

With non-modular kernel that has all XFRM options enabled, this
series reduces vmlinux image size by ~11kb. All xfrm_mode
indirections are gone and all modes are built-in.

before (ipsec-next master):
    text      data      bss         dec   filename
21071494   7233140 11104324    39408958   vmlinux.master

after this series:
21066448   7226772 11104324    39397544   vmlinux.patched

With allmodconfig kernel, the size increase is only 362 bytes,
even all the xfrm config options removed in this series are
modular.
