net: thunderbolt: Unregister ThunderboltIP protocol handler when suspending

The XDomain protocol messages may start as soon as Thunderbolt control
channel is started. This means that if the other host starts sending
ThunderboltIP packets early enough they will be passed to the network
driver which then gets confused because its resume hook is not called
yet.

Fix this by unregistering the ThunderboltIP protocol handler when
suspending and registering it back on resume.
