openvswitch: add seqadj extension when NAT is used.

When the conntrack is initialized, there is no helper attached
yet so the nat info initialization (nf_nat_setup_info) skips
adding the seqadj ext.

A helper is attached later when the conntrack is not confirmed
but is going to be committed. In this case, if NAT is needed then
adds the seqadj ext as well.
