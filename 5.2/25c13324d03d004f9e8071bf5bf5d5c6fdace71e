IB/mlx5: Add steering SW ICM device memory type

This patch adds support for allocating, deallocating and registering a new
device memory type, STEERING_SW_ICM.  This memory can be allocated and
used by a privileged user for direct rule insertion and management of the
device's steering tables.

The type is provided by the user via the dedicated attribute in the
alloc_dm ioctl command.
