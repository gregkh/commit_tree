media: vicodec: avoid clang frame size warning

Clang-9 makes some different inlining decisions compared to gcc, which
leads to a warning about a possible stack overflow problem when building
with CONFIG_KASAN, including when setting asan-stack=0, which avoids
most other frame overflow warnings:

drivers/media/platform/vicodec/codec-fwht.c:673:12: error: stack frame size of 2224 bytes in function 'encode_plane'

Manually adding noinline_for_stack annotations in those functions
called by encode_plane() or decode_plane() that require a significant
amount of kernel stack makes this impossible to happen with any
compiler.
