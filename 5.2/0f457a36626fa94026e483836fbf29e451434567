ipv4: Move cached routes to fib_nh_common

While the cached routes, nh_pcpu_rth_output and nh_rth_input, are IPv4
specific, a later patch wants to make them accessible for IPv6 nexthops
with IPv4 routes using a fib6_nh. Move the cached routes from fib_nh to
fib_nh_common and update references.

Initialization of the cached entries is moved to fib_nh_common_init,
and free is moved to fib_nh_common_release.

Change in location only, from fib_nh up to fib_nh_common; no functional
change intended.
