dsa: Add boilerplate helper to register DSA tag driver modules

A DSA tag driver module will need to register the tag protocols it
implements with the DSA core. Add macros containing this boiler plate.

The registration/unregistration code is currently just a stub. A Later
patch will add the real implementation.
