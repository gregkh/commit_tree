ftrace/x86: Anotate text_mutex split between ftrace_arch_code_modify_post_process() and ftrace_arch_code_modify_prepare()

ftrace_arch_code_modify_prepare() is acquiring text_mutex, while the
corresponding release is happening in ftrace_arch_code_modify_post_process().

This has already been documented in the code, but let's also make the fact
that this is intentional clear to the semantic analysis tools such as sparse.
