libceph: fix unaligned accesses in ceph_entity_addr handling

GCC9 is throwing a lot of warnings about unaligned access. This patch
fixes some of them by changing most of the sockaddr handling functions
to take a pointer to struct ceph_entity_addr instead of struct
sockaddr_storage.  The lower functions can then make copies or do
unaligned accesses as needed.
