ASoC: SOF: pcm: remove warning - initialize workqueue on open

If the SOF hw_params() fail, typically with an IPC error thrown by the
firmware, the period_elapsed workqueue is not initialized, but we
still cancel it in hw_free(), which results in a kernel warning.

Move the initialization to the .open callback. Tested on Broadwell
(Samus) and IceLake.

race condition in interrupt context")
