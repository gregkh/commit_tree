drm/nouveau/nouveau: forward error generated while resuming objects tree

On a failed resume we may experience unrecoverable errors. Plumb the error code
through to actually let the driver fail. On a reverse-prime setup this helps the
drm subsystem to at least recover the integrated gpu.

This can especially happen with secboot timing out, leaving the hardware in a
non-functioning state.
