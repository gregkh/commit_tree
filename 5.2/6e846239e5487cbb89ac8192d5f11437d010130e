EDAC/amd64: Add Family 17h Model 30h PCI IDs

Add the new Family 17h Model 30h PCI IDs to the AMD64 EDAC module.

This also fixes a probe failure that appeared when some other PCI IDs
for Family 17h Model 30h were added to the AMD NB code.

Fixes: be3518a16ef2 (x86/amd_nb: Add PCI device IDs for family 17h, model 30h)
