net/tcp: use deferred jump label for TCP acked data hook

User space can flip the clean_acked_data_enabled static branch
on and off with TLS offload when CONFIG_TLS_DEVICE is enabled.
jump_label.h suggests we use the delayed version in this case.

Deferred branches now also don't take the branch mutex on
decrement, so we avoid potential locking issues.
