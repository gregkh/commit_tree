drivers/dax: Allow to include DEV_DAX_PMEM as builtin

This move the dependency to DEV_DAX_PMEM_COMPAT such that only
if DEV_DAX_PMEM is built as module we can allow the compat support.

This allows to test the new code easily in a emulation setup where we
often build things without module support.
