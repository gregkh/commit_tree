drm/tinydrm: Use drm_dev_enter/exit()

This protects device resources from use after device removal.

There are 3 ways for driver-device unbinding to happen:
- The driver module is unloaded causing the driver to be unregistered.
  This can't happen as long as there are open file handles because a
  reference is taken on the module.
- The device is removed (Device Tree overlay unloading).
  This can happen at any time.
- The driver sysfs unbind file can be used to unbind the driver from the
  device. This can happen any time.

v2: Since drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() has to be called after
    drm_dev_unplug() we don't want do block ->disable after unplug.
