serial: sh-sci: disable DMA for uart_console

As noted in commit 84b40e3b57ee ("serial: 8250: omap: Disable DMA for
console UART"), UART console lines use low-level PIO only access functions
which will conflict with use of the line when DMA is enabled, e.g. when
the console line is also used for systemd messages. So disable DMA
support for UART console lines.
