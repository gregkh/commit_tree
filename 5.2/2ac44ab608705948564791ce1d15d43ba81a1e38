x86/CPU/AMD: Don't force the CPB cap when running under a hypervisor

For F17h AMD CPUs, the CPB capability ('Core Performance Boost') is forcibly set,
because some versions of that chip incorrectly report that they do not have it.

However, a hypervisor may filter out the CPB capability, for good
reasons. For example, KVM currently does not emulate setting the CPB
bit in MSR_K7_HWCR, and unchecked MSR access errors will be thrown
when trying to set it as a guest:

	unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0xc0010015 (tried to write 0x0000000001000011) at rIP: 0xffffffff890638f4 (native_write_msr+0x4/0x20)

	Call Trace:
	boost_set_msr+0x50/0x80 [acpi_cpufreq]
	cpuhp_invoke_callback+0x86/0x560
	sort_range+0x20/0x20
	cpuhp_thread_fun+0xb0/0x110
	smpboot_thread_fn+0xef/0x160
	kthread+0x113/0x130
	kthread_create_worker_on_cpu+0x70/0x70
	ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40

To avoid this issue, don't forcibly set the CPB capability for a CPU
when running under a hypervisor.
