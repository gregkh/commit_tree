ipv4: reset rt_iif for recirculated mcast/bcast out pkts

Multicast or broadcast egress packets have rt_iif set to the oif. These
packets might be recirculated back as input and lookup to the raw
sockets may fail because they are bound to the incoming interface
(skb_iif). If rt_iif is not zero, during the lookup, inet_iif() function
returns rt_iif instead of skb_iif. Hence, the lookup fails.

v2: Make it non vrf specific (David Ahern). Reword the changelog to
    reflect it.
