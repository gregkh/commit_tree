drm/arm/malidp:- Define a common list of AFBC format modifiers supported for DP500, DP550 and DP650

We need to define a common list of format modifiers supported by each of
the Mali display processors.

The following are the constraints with AFBC:-

1. AFBC is not supported for the formats defined in
malidp_hw_format_is_linear_only()

2. Some of the formats are supported only with AFBC modifiers. Thus we have
introduced a new function 'malidp_hw_format_is_afbc_only()' which verifies
the same.

3. AFBC_FORMAT_MOD_YTR needs to be provided for any RGB format.

4. Formats <= 16bpp cannot support AFBC_FORMAT_MOD_SPLIT.

5. CBR should not be set for non-subsampled formats.

6. SMART layer does not support framebuffer with AFBC modifiers.
Return -EINVAL for such a scenario.

7. AFBC_FORMAT_MOD_YTR is not supported for any YUV formats.

8. Formats which are subsampled cannot support AFBC_FORMAT_MOD_SPLIT.
However in DP550, YUV_420_10BIT is supported with AFBC_FORMAT_MOD_SPLIT.
This feature has been identified with
MALIDP_DEVICE_AFBC_YUV_420_10_SUPPORT_SPLIT.

9. In DP550 and DP650, for YUYV, the hardware supports different
format-ids to be used with and without AFBC modifier. We have used the
feature 'MALIDP_DEVICE_AFBC_YUYV_USE_422_P2' to identify this
characteristic.

10. DP500 does not support split mode (ie AFBC_FORMAT_MOD_SPLIT). We have
used the feature 'MALIDP_DEVICE_AFBC_SUPPORT_SPLIT' to identify the DPs
which support SPLIT mode.

11. DP550 supports YUV420 with split mode. We have defined the feature
'AFBC_SUPPORT_SPLIT_WITH_YUV_420_10' to identify this characteristic.

Changes since v1:-
- Merged https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/265215/ into this patch
- As Liviu pointed out in the last patch, we can pull the checks outside
of the 'while (*modifiers != DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID)' loop
- Rebased

Changes since v3 (series):
- Added the ack
- Rebased on the latest drm-misc-next
