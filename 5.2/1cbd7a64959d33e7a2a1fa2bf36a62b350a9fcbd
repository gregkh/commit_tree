platform/x86: sony-laptop: Fix unintentional fall-through

It seems that the default case should return AE_CTRL_TERMINATE, instead
of falling through to case ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_END_TAG and returning AE_OK;
otherwise the line of code at the end of the function is unreachable and
makes no sense:

return AE_CTRL_TERMINATE;

This fix is based on the following thread of discussion:
