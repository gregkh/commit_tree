psi: introduce psi monitor

Psi monitor aims to provide a low-latency short-term pressure detection
mechanism configurable by users.  It allows users to monitor psi metrics
growth and trigger events whenever a metric raises above user-defined
threshold within user-defined time window.

Time window and threshold are both expressed in usecs.  Multiple psi
resources with different thresholds and window sizes can be monitored
concurrently.

Psi monitors activate when system enters stall state for the monitored
psi metric and deactivate upon exit from the stall state.  While system
is in the stall state psi signal growth is monitored at a rate of 10
times per tracking window.  Min window size is 500ms, therefore the min
monitoring interval is 50ms.  Max window size is 10s with monitoring
interval of 1s.

When activated psi monitor stays active for at least the duration of one
tracking window to avoid repeated activations/deactivations when psi
signal is bouncing.

Notifications to the users are rate-limited to one per tracking window.
