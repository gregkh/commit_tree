KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make sure to load LPID for radix VCPUs

Commit 70ea13f6e609 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Flush TLB on secondary radix
threads", 2019-04-29) aimed to make radix guests that are using the
real-mode entry path load the LPID register and flush the TLB in the
same place where those things are done for HPT guests.  However, it
omitted to remove a branch which branches around that code for radix
guests.  The result is that with indep_thread_mode = N, radix guests
don't run correctly.  (With indep_threads_mode = Y, which is the
default, radix guests use a different entry path.)

This removes the offending branch, and also the load and compare that
the branch depends on, since the cr7 setting is now unused.
