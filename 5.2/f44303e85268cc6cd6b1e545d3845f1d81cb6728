staging: comedi: Add lockdep_assert_held() calls for dev->attach_lock

There are not a lot of functions in the core comedi module that require
the R/W semaphore `attach_lock` in `struct comedi_device` to be locked
(although there are a few functions that require at least one of
`attach_lock` and `mutex` to be locked).  One function that requires the
caller to lock `attach_lock` is `comedi_device_detach_cleanup()` so add
a call to `lockdep_assert_held()` to check and document that.
