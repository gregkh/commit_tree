powerpc/crypto: Use cheaper random numbers for crc-vpmsum self-test

This code was filling a 64K buffer from /dev/urandom in order to
compute a CRC over (on average half of) it by two different methods,
comparing the CRCs, and repeating.

This is not a remotely security-critical application, so use the far
faster and cheaper prandom_u32() generator.

And, while we're at it, only fill as much of the buffer as we plan to use.
