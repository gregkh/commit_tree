lapb: fixed leak of control-blocks.

lapb_register calls lapb_create_cb, which initializes the control-
block's ref-count to one, and __lapb_insert_cb, which increments it when
adding the new block to the list of blocks.

lapb_unregister calls __lapb_remove_cb, which decrements the ref-count
when removing control-block from the list of blocks, and calls lapb_put
itself to decrement the ref-count before returning.

However, lapb_unregister also calls __lapb_devtostruct to look up the
right control-block for the given net_device, and __lapb_devtostruct
also bumps the ref-count, which means that when lapb_unregister returns
the ref-count is still 1 and the control-block is leaked.

Call lapb_put after __lapb_devtostruct to fix leak.
