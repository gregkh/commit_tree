powerpc/mm/64: Document the sizes of/sizes mapped by Pxx_INDEX_SIZE

Add comments describing the size in bytes of the various levels of the
page table tree, and the size of the virtual address space mapped by
each level, to make it clear what the sizes are without having to also
look up other definitions.

The code that calculates the sizes actually uses sizeof(pgd_t) etc.,
so in theory these comments could skew vs the code, but the size of
pgd_t etc. is unlikely to change very often.
