HID: logitech-dj: add logi_dj_recv_queue_unknown_work helper

Add a logi_dj_recv_queue_unknown_work helper and implement query
rate-limiting inside this helper.

The motivations behind this are:

1) We need to queue workitems for reports with no place to forward them
from more places with the upcoming non-unifying receiver support, hence
the addition of the helper function.

2) When we've missed a pairing info report (or there is a race between
the report and input-events) and the input report is e.g. from a mouse
being moved, we will get a lot of these before we've finished (re-)
querying and enumerating the devices, hence the rate-limiting.

Note this also removes the:

if (!djrcv_dev->paired_dj_devices[hidpp_report->device_index])

check previously guarding the sending of an unknown workitem, the caller
of logi_dj_recv_queue_notification already does this check before calling
logi_dj_recv_queue_notification.
