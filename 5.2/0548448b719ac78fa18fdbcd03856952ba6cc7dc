pinctrl: lochnagar: Add support for the Cirrus Logic Lochnagar

Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus
Logic Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of
most Cirrus Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing
connection of various application processor systems to provide a
full evaluation platform. This driver supports the board
controller chip on the Lochnagar board.

Lochnagar provides many pins which can generally be used for an
audio function such as an AIF or a PDM interface, but also as
GPIOs.
