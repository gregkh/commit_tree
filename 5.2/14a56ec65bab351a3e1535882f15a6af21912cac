staging: erofs: support IO read error injection

Used to simulate disk IO read error for testing fatal
error tolerance.

Here are the details,
1) use bio->bi_private to indicate super_block
   for non-compressed bios since some (mainly meta)
   pages can be of the corresponding bdev inode;
2) get super_block dynamically for compressed bios,
   therefore it could not inject bios full of staging
   pages, yet it doesn't affect the normal usage.
