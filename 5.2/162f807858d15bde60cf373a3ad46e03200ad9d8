drm/amd/display: half bandwidth for YCbCr420 during validation

[Why]
used to be unable to run 4:2:0 if using a dongle because 4k60 bandwidth
exceeded dongle caps

[How]
half pixel clock during comparison to dongle cap. *Could get stuck on black
screen on monitor that don't support 420 but will be selecting 420 as
preferred mode*
