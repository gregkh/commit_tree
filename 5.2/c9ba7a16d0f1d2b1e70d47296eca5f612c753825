spi: Release spi_res after finalizing message

spi_split_transfers_maxsize() can be used to split a transfer. This
function uses spi_res to lifetime manage the added transfer structures.
So in order to finalize the current message while it contains the split
transfers, spi_res_release() must be called after finalizing.
