drm/i915: Introduce a mutex for file_priv->context_idr

Define a mutex for the exclusive use of interacting with the per-file
context-idr, that was previously guarded by struct_mutex. This allows us
to reduce the coverage of struct_mutex, with a view to removing the last
bits coordinating GEM context later. (In the short term, we avoid taking
struct_mutex while using the extended constructor functions, preventing
some nasty recursion.)

v2: s/context_lock/context_idr_lock/
