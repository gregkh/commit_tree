bpf: add bpf_skb_adjust_room encap flags

When pushing tunnel headers, annotate skbs in the same way as tunnel
devices.

For GSO packets, the network stack requires certain fields set to
segment packets with tunnel headers. gro_gse_segment depends on
transport and inner mac header, for instance.

Add an option to pass this information.

Remove the restriction on len_diff to network header length, which
is too short, e.g., for GRE protocols.

Changes
  v1->v2:
  - document new flags
  - BPF_F_ADJ_ROOM_MASK moved
  v2->v3:
  - BPF_F_ADJ_ROOM_ENCAP_L3_MASK moved
