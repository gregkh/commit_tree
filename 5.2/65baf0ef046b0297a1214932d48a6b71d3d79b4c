drm/i915: Hold a ref to the ring while retiring

As the final request on a ring may hold the reference to this ring (via
retiring the last pinned context), we may find ourselves chasing a
dangling pointer on completion of the list.

A quick solution is to hold a reference to the ring itself as we retire
along it so that we only free it after we stop dereferencing it.
