KVM: Introduce a 'release' method for KVM devices

When a P9 sPAPR VM boots, the CAS negotiation process determines which
interrupt mode to use (XICS legacy or XIVE native) and invokes a
machine reset to activate the chosen mode.

To be able to switch from one interrupt mode to another, we introduce
the capability to release a KVM device without destroying the VM. The
KVM device interface is extended with a new 'release' method which is
called when the file descriptor of the device is closed.

Once 'release' is called, the 'destroy' method will not be called
anymore as the device is removed from the device list of the VM.
