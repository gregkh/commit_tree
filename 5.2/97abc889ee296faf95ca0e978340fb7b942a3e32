signal: remove the wrong signal_pending() check in restore_user_sigmask()

This is the minimal fix for stable, I'll send cleanups later.

Commit 854a6ed56839 ("signal: Add restore_user_sigmask()") introduced
the visible change which breaks user-space: a signal temporary unblocked
by set_user_sigmask() can be delivered even if the caller returns
success or timeout.

Change restore_user_sigmask() to accept the additional "interrupted"
argument which should be used instead of signal_pending() check, and
update the callers.

Eric said:

: For clarity.  I don't think this is required by posix, or fundamentally to
: remove the races in select.  It is what linux has always done and we have
: applications who care so I agree this fix is needed.
:
: Further in any case where the semantic change that this patch rolls back
: (aka where allowing a signal to be delivered and the select like call to
: complete) would be advantage we can do as well if not better by using
: signalfd.
:
: Michael is there any chance we can get this guarantee of the linux
: implementation of pselect and friends clearly documented.  The guarantee
: that if the system call completes successfully we are guaranteed that no
: signal that is unblocked by using sigmask will be delivered?
