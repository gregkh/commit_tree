sctp: change to hold sk after auth shkey is created successfully

Now in sctp_endpoint_init(), it holds the sk then creates auth
shkey. But when the creation fails, it doesn't release the sk,
which causes a sk defcnf leak,

Here to fix it by only holding the sk when auth shkey is created
successfully.
