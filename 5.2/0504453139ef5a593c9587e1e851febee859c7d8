net: macb: Change interrupt and napi enable order in open

Current order in open:
-> Enable interrupts (macb_init_hw)
-> Enable NAPI
-> Start PHY

Sequence of RX handling:
-> RX interrupt occurs
-> Interrupt is cleared and interrupt bits disabled in handler
-> NAPI is scheduled
-> In NAPI, RX budget is processed and RX interrupts are re-enabled

With the above, on QEMU or fixed link setups (where PHY state doesn't
matter), there's a chance macb RX interrupt occurs before NAPI is
enabled. This will result in NAPI being scheduled before it is enabled.
Fix this macb open by changing the order.
