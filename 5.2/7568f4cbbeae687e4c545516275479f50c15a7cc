selftests/bpf: C based test for sysctl and strtoX

Add C based test for a few bpf_sysctl_* helpers and bpf_strtoul.

Make sure that sysctl can be identified by name and that multiple
integers can be parsed from sysctl value with bpf_strtoul.

net/ipv4/tcp_mem is chosen as a testing sysctl, it contains 3 unsigned
longs, they all are parsed and compared (val[0] < val[1] < val[2]).

Example of output:
  # ./test_sysctl
  ...
  Test case: C prog: deny all writes .. [PASS]
  Test case: C prog: deny access by name .. [PASS]
  Test case: C prog: read tcp_mem .. [PASS]
  Summary: 39 PASSED, 0 FAILED
