ACPI: PM: Call pm_set_suspend_via_firmware() during hibernation

On systems with ACPI platform firmware the last stage of hibernation
is analogous to system suspend to S3 (suspend-to-RAM), so it should
be handled analogously.  In particular, pm_suspend_via_firmware()
should return 'true' in that stage to let the callers of it know that
control will be passed to the platform firmware going forward, so
pm_set_suspend_via_firmware() needs to be called then in analogy with
acpi_suspend_begin().

However, the platform hibernation ->begin() callback is invoked
during the "freeze" transition (before creating a snapshot image of
system memory) as well as during the "hibernate" transition which is
the last stage of it and pm_set_suspend_via_firmware() should be
invoked by that callback in the latter stage only.

In order to implement that redefine the hibernation ->begin()
callback to take a pm_message_t argument to indicate which stage
of hibernation is taking place and rework acpi_hibernation_begin()
and acpi_hibernation_begin_old() to take it into account as needed.
