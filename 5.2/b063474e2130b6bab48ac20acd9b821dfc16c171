media: atmel: atmel-isc: removed ARGB32 added ABGR32 and XBGR32

ISC will output the "ARGB32" configuration in byte order: B, G, R, Alpha.
This is in fact the format BGRA, aka ABGR32.
If alpha is missing, the same format is equivalent to XBGR32.
Added both formats and removed ARGB32 which is wrong.
