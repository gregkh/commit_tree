selinux: do not report error on connect(AF_UNSPEC)

calling connect(AF_UNSPEC) on an already connected TCP socket is an
established way to disconnect() such socket. After commit 68741a8adab9
("selinux: Fix ltp test connect-syscall failure") it no longer works
and, in the above scenario connect() fails with EAFNOSUPPORT.

Fix the above falling back to the generic/old code when the address family
is not AF_INET{4,6}, but leave the SCTP code path untouched, as it has
specific constraints.
