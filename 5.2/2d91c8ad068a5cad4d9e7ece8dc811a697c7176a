brcmfmac: set txflow request id from 1 to pktids array size

Some PCIE firmwares drop txstatus if pktid is 0 and make packet held in
host side and never be released. If that packet type is 802.1x, the
pend_8021x_cnt value will be always greater than 0 and show "Timed out
waiting for no pending 802.1x packets" error message when sending key to
dongle every time.

To be compatible with all firmwares, host should set txflow request id
from 1 instead of from 0.
