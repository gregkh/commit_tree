cgroup: add tracing points for cgroup v2 freezer

Add cgroup:cgroup_freeze and cgroup:cgroup_unfreeze events,
which are using the existing cgroup tracing infrastructure.

Add the cgroup_event event class, which is similar to the cgroup
class, but contains an additional integer field to store a new
value (the level field is dropped).

Also add two tracing events: cgroup_notify_populated and
cgroup_notify_frozen, which are raised in a generic way using
the TRACE_CGROUP_PATH() macro.

This allows to trace cgroup state transitions and is generally
helpful for debugging the cgroup freezer code.
