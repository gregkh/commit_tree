net/mlx5e: Fix calling wrong function to get inner vlan key and mask

When flow_rule_match_XYZ() functions were first introduced,
flow_rule_match_cvlan() for inner vlan is missing.

In mlx5_core driver, to get inner vlan key and mask, flow_rule_match_vlan()
is just called, which is wrong because it obtains outer vlan information by
FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN.

This commit fixes this by changing to call flow_rule_match_cvlan() after
it's added.
