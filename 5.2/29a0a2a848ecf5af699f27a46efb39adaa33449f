ARM: dts: exynos: Add CPU cooling on Arndale Octa

Arndale Octa board comes without fan so proper CPU cooling is necessary
to avoid critical shutdowns when CPUs are busy.  Although thermal zones
were present but CPU cooling was missing in DTS.

Adjust the trip points and add respective cooling nodes for each CPU
thermal zone.  The CPU throttling will start at 60 degrees of C,
intensify at 80 degrees of C and slow down CPUs as much as possible at
110 degrees of C.

With this configuration, when running four CPU intensive tasks, the
temperatures did not exceed 90 degrees of Celsius mostly oscillating
around 88 degrees in hottest thermal zone.  Test was however done with
only four CPUs online (big cluster, Cortex A15) because of errors when
booting secondary CPUs.
