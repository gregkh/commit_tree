arm64: KVM: Encapsulate kvm_cpu_context in kvm_host_data

The virt/arm core allocates a kvm_cpu_context_t percpu, at present this is
a typedef to kvm_cpu_context and is used to store host cpu context. The
kvm_cpu_context structure is also used elsewhere to hold vcpu context.
In order to use the percpu to hold additional future host information we
encapsulate kvm_cpu_context in a new structure and rename the typedef and
percpu to match.
