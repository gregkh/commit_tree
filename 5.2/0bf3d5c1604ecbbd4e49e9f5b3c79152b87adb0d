fs, fscrypt: clear DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME when unaliasing directory

Make __d_move() clear DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME on the source dentry.  This
is needed for when d_splice_alias() moves a directory's encrypted alias
to its decrypted alias as a result of the encryption key being added.

Otherwise, the decrypted alias will incorrectly be invalidated on the
next lookup, causing problems such as unmounting a mount the user just
mount()ed there.

Note that we don't have to support arbitrary moves of this flag because
fscrypt doesn't allow dentries with DCACHE_ENCRYPTED_NAME to be the
source or target of a rename().
