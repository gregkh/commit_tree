drm/nouveau/secboot/gp10[2467]: support newer FW to fix SEC2 failures on some boards

Some newer boards with these chipsets aren't compatible with the prior
version of the SEC2 FW, and fail to load as a result.

This newer FW is actually the one we already use on >=GP108.

Unfortunately, there are interface differences in GP108's FW, making it
impossible to simply move files around in linux-firmware to solve this.

We need to be able to keep compatibility with all linux-firmware/kernel
combinations, which means supporting both firmwares.
