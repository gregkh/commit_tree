s390/kexec_file: Fix detection of text segment in ELF loader

To register data for the next kernel (command line, oldmem_base, etc.) the
current kernel needs to find the ELF segment that contains head.S. This is
currently done by checking ifor 'phdr->p_paddr == 0'. This works fine for
the current kernel build but in theory the first few pages could be
skipped. Make the detection more robust by checking if the entry point lies
within the segment.
