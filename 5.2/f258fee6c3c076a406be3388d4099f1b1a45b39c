drm/amd/display: Add debugfs dpcd interface

[Why]
We need arbitrary read/write over DP AUX DPCD
for debugging

[How]
Three debugfs entries

Set the target address by writing to
"aux_dpcd_address"
(The first four bytes written are used)

Set the transaction size in bytes by writing to
"aux_dpcd_size"
(The first four bytes written are used)

Start a transaction by reading/writing
"aux_dpcd_data"

Do note: there is no concerrency protection at all
Accessing these entries in quick succession can lead
to strange behaviour
