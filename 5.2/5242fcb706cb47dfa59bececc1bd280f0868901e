cifs: fix bi-directional fsctl passthrough calls

SMB2 Ioctl responses from servers may respond with both the request blob from
the client followed by the actual reply blob for ioctls that are bi-directional.

In that case we can not assume that the reply blob comes immediately after the
ioctl response structure.

This fixes FSCTLs such as SMB2:FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES
