clk: mediatek: Disable tuner_en before change PLL rate

PLLs with tuner_en bit, such as APLL1, need to disable
tuner_en before apply new frequency settings, or the new frequency
settings (pcw) will not be applied.
The tuner_en bit will be disabled during changing PLL rate
and be restored after new settings applied.
