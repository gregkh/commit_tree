arm64: vdso: Fix clock_getres() for CLOCK_REALTIME

clock_getres() in the vDSO library has to preserve the same behaviour
of posix_get_hrtimer_res().

In particular, posix_get_hrtimer_res() does:

    sec = 0;
    ns = hrtimer_resolution;

where 'hrtimer_resolution' depends on whether or not high resolution
timers are enabled, which is a runtime decision.

The vDSO incorrectly returns the constant CLOCK_REALTIME_RES. Fix this
by exposing 'hrtimer_resolution' in the vDSO datapage and returning that
instead.
