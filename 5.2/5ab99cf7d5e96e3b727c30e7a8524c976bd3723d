ARM: dts: exynos: Always enable necessary APIO_1V8 and ABB_1V8 regulators on Arndale Octa

The PVDD_APIO_1V8 (LDO2) and PVDD_ABB_1V8 (LDO8) regulators were turned
off by Linux kernel as unused.  However they supply critical parts of
SoC so they should be always on:

1. PVDD_APIO_1V8 supplies SYS pins (gpx[0-3], PSHOLD), HDMI level shift,
   RTC, VDD1_12 (DRAM internal 1.8 V logic), pull-up for PMIC interrupt
   lines, TTL/UARTR level shift, reset pins and SW-TACT1 button.
   It also supplies unused blocks like VDDQ_SRAM (for SROM controller) and
   VDDQ_GPIO (gpm7, gpy7).
   The LDO2 cannot be turned off (S2MPS11 keeps it on anyway) so
   marking it "always-on" only reflects its real status.

2. PVDD_ABB_1V8 supplies Adaptive Body Bias Generator for ARM cores,
   memory and Mali (G3D).
