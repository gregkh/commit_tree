irqchip/gic-pm: Fix suspend handling

If interrupts are enabled for a non-root GIC device that uses the
gic-pm driver, when system suspend occurs, the current interrupt
state is not saved and restored correctly and so interrupts do not
work again on resuming the system. Add a late suspend handler to
save and restore the state for these devices.
