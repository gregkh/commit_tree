net: phy: improve link partner capability detection

genphy_read_status() so far checks phydev->supported, not the actual
PHY capabilities. This can make a difference if the supported speeds
have been limited by of_set_phy_supported() or phy_set_max_speed().

It seems that this issue only affects the link partner advertisements
as displayed by ethtool. Also this patch wouldn't apply to older
kernels because linkmode bitmaps have been introduced recently.
Therefore net-next.
