kobject: fix dereference before null check on kobj

The kobj pointer is being null-checked so potentially it could be null,
however, the ktype declaration before the null check is dereferencing kobj
hence we have a potential null pointer deference. Fix this by moving the
assignment of ktype after kobj has been null checked.
