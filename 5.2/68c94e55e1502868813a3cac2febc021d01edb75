btrfs: Transpose btrfs_close_devices/btrfs_mapping_tree_free in close_ctree

Following the introduction of the alloc_state tree, some of the callees
of btrfs_mapping_tree_free will have to interact with the btrfs_device
of the constituent devices. Enable this by moving the code responsible
for freeing devices after the last user (btrfs_mapping_tree_free).
Otherwise the kernel could crash due to use-after-free.
