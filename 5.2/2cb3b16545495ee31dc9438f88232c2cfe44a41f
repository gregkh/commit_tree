irqchip/ls-scfg-msi: Don't map the MSI page in ls_scfg_msi_compose_msg()

ls_scfg_msi_compose_msg() may be called from non-preemptible context.
However, on RT, iommu_dma_map_msi_msg() requires to be called from a
preemptible context.

A recent patch split iommu_dma_map_msi_msg() in two new functions:
one that should be called in preemptible context, the other does
not have any requirement.

The FreeScale SCFG MSI driver is reworked to avoid executing preemptible
code in non-preemptible context. This can be achieved by preparing the
MSI maping when allocating the MSI interrupt.
