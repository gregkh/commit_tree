arm64: assembler: Update comment above cond_yield_neon() macro

Since commit 7faa313f05ca ("arm64: preempt: Fix big-endian when checking
preempt count in assembly") both the preempt count and the 'need_resched'
flag are checked as part of a single 64-bit load in cond_yield_neon(),
so update the stale comment to reflect reality.
