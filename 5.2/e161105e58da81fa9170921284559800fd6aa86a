net/mlx5: Function setup/teardown procedures

Function setup and teardown procedures are the basic procedure that
each mlx5 pci function should perform to boot up a mlx5 device function
and initialize basic communication with FW, before allocating any higher
level software/firmware resources.

This provides a better logical separation of mlx5 core device
initialization flow and will help to seamlessly support creating different
mlx5 device types such as PF, VF and SF mlx5 sub-function virtual device.

This patch does not change any functionality.
