ice: Prevent unintended multiple chain resets

In the current implementation of ice_reset_subtask, if multiple reset
types are set in the pf->state, the most intrusive one is meant to be
performed only, but the bits requesting the other types are not being
cleared. This would lead to another reset being performed the next time
the service task is scheduled.

Change the flow of ice_reset_subtask so that all reset request bits in
pf->state are cleared, and we still perform the most intrusive of the
resets requested.
