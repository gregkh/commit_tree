kbuild: allow Kbuild to start from any directory

Kbuild always runs in the top of the output directory.

If Make starts in the source directory with O=, it relocates the
working directory to the location specified by O=.

Also, users can start build from the output directory by using the
Makefile generated by scripts/mkmakefile.

With a little more effort, Kbuild will be able to start from any
directory path.

This commit allows to specify the source directory by using
the -f option.

For example, you can do:

  $ cd path/to/output/dir
  $ make -f path/to/source/dir/Makefile

Or, for the equivalent behavior, you can do:

  $ make O=path/to/output/dir -f path/to/source/dir/Makefile

KBUILD_SRC is now deprecated.
