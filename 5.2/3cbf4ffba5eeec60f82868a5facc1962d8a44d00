net: plumb network namespace into __skb_flow_dissect

This new argument will be used in the next patches for the
eth_get_headlen use case. eth_get_headlen calls flow dissector
with only data (without skb) so there is currently no way to
pull attached BPF flow dissector program. With this new argument,
we can amend the callers to explicitly pass network namespace
so we can use attached BPF program.
