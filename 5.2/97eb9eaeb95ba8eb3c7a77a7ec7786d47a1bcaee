drm: writeback: Cleanup job ownership handling when queuing job

The drm_writeback_queue_job() function takes ownership of the passed job
and requires the caller to manually set the connector state
writeback_job pointer to NULL. To simplify drivers and avoid errors
(such as the missing NULL set in the vc4 driver), pass the connector
state pointer to the function instead of the job pointer, and set the
writeback_job pointer to NULL internally.
