drm/i915: Remove defunct intel_suspend_gt_powersave()

Since commit b7137e0cf1e5 ("drm/i915: Defer enabling rc6 til after we
submit the first batch/context"), intel_suspend_gt_powersave() has been
a no-op. As we still do not need to do anything explicitly on suspend
(we do everything required on idling), remove the defunct function.
