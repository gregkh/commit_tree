net: phy: fix phy_validate_pause

We have valid scenarios where ETHTOOL_LINK_MODE_Pause_BIT doesn't
need to be supported. Therefore extend the first check to check
for rx_pause being set.

See also phy_set_asym_pause:
rx=0 and tx=1: advertise asym pause only
rx=0 and tx=0: stop advertising both pause modes

The fixed commit isn't wrong, it's just the one that introduced the
linkmode bitmaps.
