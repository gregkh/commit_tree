arm64/sve: Clarify role of the VQ map maintenance functions

The roles of sve_init_vq_map(), sve_update_vq_map() and
sve_verify_vq_map() are highly non-obvious to anyone who has not dug
through cpufeatures.c in detail.

Since the way these functions interact with each other is more
important here than a full understanding of the cpufeatures code, this
patch adds comments to make the functions' roles clearer.

No functional change.
