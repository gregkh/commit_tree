Documentation/trace: Add clarification how histogram onmatch works

The current trace documentation, the section describing histogram's "onmatch"
is not straightforward enough about how this action is applied. It is not
clear what criteria are used to "match" both events. A short note is added,
describing what exactly is compared in order to match the events.
