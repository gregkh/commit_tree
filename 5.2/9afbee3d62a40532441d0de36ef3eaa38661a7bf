scsi: lpfc: Reduce memory footprint for lpfc_queue

Currently the driver maintains a sideband structure which has a pointer for
each queue element. However, at 8 bytes per pointer, and up to 4k elements
per queue, and 100s of queues, this can take up a lot of memory.

Convert the driver to using an access routine that calculates the element
address based on its index rather than using the pointer table.
