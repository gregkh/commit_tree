dmaengine: sprd: Fix block length overflow

The maximum value of block length is 0xffff, so if the configured transfer length
is more than 0xffff, that will cause block length overflow to lead a configuration
error.

Thus we can set block length as the maximum burst length to avoid this issue, since
the maximum burst length will not be a big value which is more than 0xffff.
