s390/qdio: eliminate queue's last_move cursor

This cursor is used for debugging only. But since
commit "s390/qdio: pass up count of ready-to-process SBALs" it effectively
duplicates the first_to_check cursor, diverging for just a short moment
when get_*_buffer_frontier() updates q->first_to_check.
