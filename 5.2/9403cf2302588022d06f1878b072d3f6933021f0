tcp: free request sock directly upon TFO or syncookies error

Since the request socket is created locally, it'd make more sense to
use reqsk_free() instead of reqsk_put() in TFO and syncookies' error
path.

However, tcp_get_cookie_sock() may set ->rsk_refcnt before freeing the
socket; tcp_conn_request() may also have non-null ->rsk_refcnt because
of tcp_try_fastopen(). In both cases 'req' hasn't been exposed
to the outside world and is safe to free immediately, but that'd
trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE in reqsk_free().

Define __reqsk_free() for these situations where we know nobody's
referencing the socket, even though ->rsk_refcnt might be non-null.
Now we can consolidate the error path of tcp_get_cookie_sock() and
tcp_conn_request().
