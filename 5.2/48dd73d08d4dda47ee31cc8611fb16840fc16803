net: aquantia: fix vlans not working over bridged network

In configuration of vlan over bridge over aquantia device
it was found that vlan tagged traffic is dropped on chip.

The reason is that bridge device enables promisc mode,
but in atlantic chip vlan filters will still apply.
So we have to corellate promisc settings with vlan configuration.

The solution is to track in a separate state variable the
need of vlan forced promisc. And also consider generic
promisc configuration when doing vlan filter config.
