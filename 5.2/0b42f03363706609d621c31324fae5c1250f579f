dsa: Add MODULE_ALIAS to taggers in preparation to become modules

When the tag drivers become modules, we will need to dynamically load
them based on what the switch drivers need. Add aliases to map between
the TAG protocol and the driver.

In order to do this, we need the tag protocol number as something
which the C pre-processor can stringinfy. Only the compiler knows the
value of an enum, CPP cannot use them. So add #defines.
