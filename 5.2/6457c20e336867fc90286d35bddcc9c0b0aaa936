fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c: fix buffer free in SMB2_ioctl_free

The 2nd buffer could be NULL even if iov_len is not zero. This can
trigger a panic when handling symlinks. It's easy to reproduce with
LTP fs_racer scripts[1] which are randomly craete/delete/link files
and dirs. Fix this panic by checking if the 2nd buffer is padding
before kfree, like what we do in SMB2_open_free.
