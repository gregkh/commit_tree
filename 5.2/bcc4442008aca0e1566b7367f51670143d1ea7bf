drm: add drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb565_dstclip()

It is a drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb565() variant which checks the clip
rectangle for the destination too.

Common code between drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb565() and
drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb565_dstclip() was factored out into the
drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb565_lines() helper function.
