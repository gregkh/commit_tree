afs: Fix "kAFS: AFS vnode with undefined type 0"

Under some circumstances afs_select_fileserver() can return without setting
an error in fc->error.  The problem is in the no_more_servers segment where
the accumulated errors from attempts to contact various servers are
integrated into an afs_error-type variable 'e'.  The resultant error code
is, however, then abandoned.

Fix this by getting the error out of e.error and putting it in 'error' so
that the next part will store it into fc->error.

Not doing this causes a report like the following:

    kAFS: AFS vnode with undefined type 0
    kAFS: A=0 m=0 s=0 v=0
    kAFS: vnode 20000025:1:1

because the code following the server selection loop then sees what it
thinks is a successful invocation because fc.error is 0.  However, it can't
apply the status record because it's all zeros.

The report is followed on the first instance with a trace looking something
like:
