net: aquantia: fix wol configuration not applied sometimes

WoL magic packet configuration sometimes does not work due to
couple of leakages found.

Mainly there was a regression introduced during readx_poll refactoring.

Next, fw request waiting time was too small. Sometimes that
caused sleep proxy config function to return with an error
and to skip WoL configuration.
At last, WoL data were passed to FW from not clean buffer.
That could cause FW to accept garbage as a random configuration data.
