watchdog: coh901327: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config COH901327_WATCHDOG
       bool "ST-Ericsson COH 901 327 watchdog"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We explicitly disallow a driver unbind, since that doesn't have a
sensible use case anyway, and it allows us to drop the ".remove"
code for non-modular drivers.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_ALIAS is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We replace module.h with moduleparam.h since the file does actually
declare some module parameters (i.e. boot args for non-modules).
