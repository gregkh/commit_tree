dt-bindings: arm: coresight: Add new compatible for static replicator

CoreSight uses below bindings for replicator:

  Dynamic replicator, aka. configurable replicator:
    "arm,coresight-dynamic-replicator", "arm,primecell";

  Static replicator, aka. non-configurable replicator:
    "arm,coresight-replicator";

The compatible string "arm,coresight-replicator" is not an explicit
naming to express the replicator is 'static'.  To unify the naming
convention, this patch introduces a new compatible string
"arm,coresight-static-replicator" for the static replicator; the
compatible string "arm,coresight-replicator" is kept for backward
compatibility, but tag it as obsolete and suggest to use the new
compatible string.

As result CoreSight replicator have below bindings:

  Dynamic replicator:
    "arm,coresight-dynamic-replicator", "arm,primecell";

  Static replicator:
    "arm,coresight-static-replicator";
    "arm,coresight-replicator"; (obsolete)
