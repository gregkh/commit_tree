drm/i915/pmu: Always sample an active ringbuffer

As we no longer have a precise indication of requests queued to an
engine, make no presumptions and just sample the ring registers to see
if the engine is busy.

v2: Report busy while the ring is idling on a semaphore/event.
v3: Give the struct a name!
v4: Always 0 outside the powerwell; trusting the powerwell is
accurate enough for our sampling pmu.
v5: Protect against gen7 mmio madness and try to improve grammar
