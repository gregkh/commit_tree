x86/asm: Mark all top level asm statements as .text

With gcc toplevel assembler statements that do not mark themselves as .text
may end up in other sections. This causes LTO boot crashes because various
assembler statements ended up in the middle of the initcall section. It's
also a latent problem without LTO, although it's currently not known to
cause any real problems.

According to the gcc team it's expected behavior.

Always mark all the top level assembler statements as text so that they
switch to the right section.
