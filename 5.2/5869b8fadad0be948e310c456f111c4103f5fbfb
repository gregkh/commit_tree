net: use rcu_dereference_protected to fetch sk_dst_cache in sk_destruct

As Eric noticed, in .sk_destruct, sk->sk_dst_cache update is prevented, and
no barrier is needed for this. So change to use rcu_dereference_protected()
instead of rcu_dereference_check() to fetch sk_dst_cache in there.

v1->v2:
  - no change, repost after net-next is open.
