ASoC: sprd: Add Spreadtrum audio compress offload support

We use 2-stage DMA mode to support Spreadtrum audio compress offload,
which means we use one DMA source channel to transfer data from IRAM
buffer to the DSP fifo to do decoding/encoding, once IRAM buffer is
empty by transferring done, another DMA destination channel will be
triggered automatically to start to transfer data from DDR buffer to
the IRAM buffer. This can reduce the AP subsystem wakeup times to save
power.
