NFC: st21nfca: Fix fall-through warnings

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings by adding a missing break
and a fall-through annotation:

drivers/nfc/st21nfca/dep.c: In function ‘st21nfca_tm_event_send_data’:
drivers/nfc/st21nfca/dep.c:391:3: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
   switch (cmd1) {
   ^~~~~~

  default:

                 from drivers/nfc/st21nfca/dep.c:17:

   case ST21NFCA_NFC_DEP_PFB_I_PDU:
   ^~~~

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
