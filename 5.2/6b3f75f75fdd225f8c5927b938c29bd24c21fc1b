HID: intel-ish-hid: Add match callback to ishtp bus type

Currently we depend on the guid check in ishtp_cl_driver.probe to match
the device and driver. However Linux device core first calls the match()
callback to decide the matching of driver and device, and then does some
preparation before calling the driver probe function. If we return error
in the driver probe, it needs to tear down all the preparation work and
retry with next driver.

Adding the match callback can avoid the unnecessary entry into unmatched
driver probe function for ishtp clients reported by FW.
