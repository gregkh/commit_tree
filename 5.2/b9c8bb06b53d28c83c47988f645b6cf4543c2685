ice: Add ability to update rx-usecs-high

Currently the driver allows rx-usecs-high values to be set,
but when querying the device for rx-usecs-high the value
does not stick. This is because it was not yet implemented.
Add code to allow the user to change rx-usecs-high and
use this to set the q_vector's intrl value.
