acpi: Create subtable parsing infrastructure

Parsing entries in an ACPI table had assumed a generic header
structure. There is no standard ACPI header, though, so less common
layouts with different field sizes required custom parsers to go through
their subtable entry list.

Create the infrastructure for adding different table types so parsing
the entries array may be more reused for all ACPI system tables and
the common code doesn't need to be duplicated.
