drm/amd/display: Re-add custom degamma support

[Why]
The dc_gamma_type CUSTOM_GAMMA is used to represent degamma
mappings passed in by drm. This type of gamma must be interpolated
into a transfer function by apply_1d_lut.  The line in
mod_color_calculate_degamma_params that handled this case
was erroneously removed.

[How]
For CUSTOM_GAMMA degamma, calculate the lut as before.
