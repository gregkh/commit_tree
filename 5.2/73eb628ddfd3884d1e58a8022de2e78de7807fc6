Revert: "net: sched: put back q.qlen into a single location"

This revert commit 46b1c18f9deb ("net: sched: put back q.qlen into
a single location").
After the previous patch, when a NOLOCK qdisc is enslaved to a
locking qdisc it switches to global stats accounting. As a consequence,
when a classful qdisc accesses directly a child qdisc's qlen, such
qdisc is not doing per CPU accounting and qlen value is consistent.

In the control path nobody uses directly qlen since commit
e5f0e8f8e45 ("net: sched: introduce and use qdisc tree flush/purge
helpers"), so we can remove the contented atomic ops from the
datapath.

v1 -> v2:
 - complete the qdisc_qstats_atomic_qlen_dec() ->
   qdisc_qstats_cpu_qlen_dec() replacement, fix build issue
 - more descriptive commit message
