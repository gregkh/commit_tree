kbuild: check arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/generated before out-of-tree build

After cross-compiling the kernel, "make mrproper" should be executed
with the proper ARCH= option. Otherwise, stale objects will remain
under arch/$(SRCARCH)/.

One bad scenario is like this:

  $ make ARCH=arm defconfig all   # cross-compile the kernel for arm
  $ make mrproper                 # mrproper for host-arch (i.e. x86)
  $ make ARCH=arm O=build_dir defconfig all

If you miss ARCH= for mrproper and cross-compile the kernel with O=
and ARCH= options, Kbuild will happily start to build, but may fail
due to stale objects in the srctree.

If $(srctree)/arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/generated/ exists, let's stop
the out-of-tree build. To detect this, mrproper should clean only
arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/generated/.
