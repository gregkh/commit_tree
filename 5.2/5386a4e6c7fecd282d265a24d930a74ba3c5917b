scsi: qla2xxx: Add cleanup for PCI EEH recovery

During EEH error recovery testing it was discovered that driver's reset()
callback partially frees resources used by driver, leaving some stale
memory.  After reset() is done and when resume() callback in driver uses
old data which results into error leaving adapter disabled due to PCIe
error.

This patch does cleanup for EEH recovery code path and prevents adapter
from getting disabled.
