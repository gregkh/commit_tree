tracing: Allow RCU to run between postponed startup tests

When building a allmodconfig kernel for arm64 and boot that in qemu,
CONFIG_FTRACE_STARTUP_TEST gets enabled and that takes time so the
watchdog expires and prints out a message like this:
'watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [swapper/0:1]'
Depending on what the what test gets called from init_trace_selftests()
it stays minutes in the loop.
Rework so that function cond_resched() gets called in the
init_trace_selftests loop.
