clk: mediatek: Add new clkmux register API

On both MT8183 & MT6765, there add "set/clr" register for
each clkmux setting, and one update register to trigger value change.
It is designed to prevent read-modify-write racing issue.
The sw design need to add a new API to handle this hw change with
a new mtk_clk_mux/mtk_mux struct in new file "clk-mux.c", "clk-mux.h".
