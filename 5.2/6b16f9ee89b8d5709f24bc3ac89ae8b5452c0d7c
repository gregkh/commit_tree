net: move skb->xmit_more hint to softnet data

There are two reasons for this.

First, the xmit_more flag conceptually doesn't fit into the skb, as
xmit_more is not a property related to the skb.
Its only a hint to the driver that the stack is about to transmit another
packet immediately.

Second, it was only done this way to not have to pass another argument
to ndo_start_xmit().

We can place xmit_more in the softnet data, next to the device recursion.
The recursion counter is already written to on each transmit. The "more"
indicator is placed right next to it.

Drivers can use the netdev_xmit_more() helper instead of skb->xmit_more
to check the "more packets coming" hint.

skb->xmit_more is retained (but always 0) to not cause build breakage.

This change takes care of the simple s/skb->xmit_more/netdev_xmit_more()/
conversions.  Remaining drivers are converted in the next patches.
