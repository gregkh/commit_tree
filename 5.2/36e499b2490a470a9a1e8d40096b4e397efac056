drm/amdgpu: amdgpu_device_recover_vram got NULL of shadow->parent

amdgpu_bo_destroy had a bug by calling amdgpu_bo_unref outside mutex_lock.
If amdgpu_device_recover_vram executed between amdgpu_bo_unref and list_del_init,
it would get NULL of shadow->parent, then caused Call Trace and GPU reset failed.
