ALSA: usb-audio: fix sign unintended sign extension on left shifts

There are a couple of left shifts of unsigned 8 bit values that
first get promoted to signed ints and hence get sign extended
on the shift if the top bit of the 8 bit values are set. Fix
this by casting the 8 bit values to unsigned ints to stop the
unintentional sign extension.
