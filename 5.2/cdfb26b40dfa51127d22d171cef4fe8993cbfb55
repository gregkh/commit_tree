afs: Handle lock rpc ops failing on a file that got deleted

Holding a file lock on an AFS file does not prevent it from being deleted
on the server, so we need to handle an error resulting from that when we
try setting, extending or releasing a lock.

Fix this by adding a "deleted" lock state and cancelling the lock extension
process for that file and aborting all waiters for the lock.
