netfilter: nft_fib: Fix existence check support

NFTA_FIB_F_PRESENT flag was not always honored since eval functions did
not call nft_fib_store_result in all cases.

Given that in all callsites there is a struct net_device pointer
available which holds the interface data to be stored in destination
register, simplify nft_fib_store_result() to just accept that pointer
instead of the nft_pktinfo pointer and interface index. This also
allows to drop the index to interface lookup previously needed to get
the name associated with given index.
