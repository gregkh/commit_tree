cpufreq: schedutil: Simplify iowait boosting

There is not reason for the minimum iowait boost value in the
schedutil cpufreq governor to depend on the available range of CPU
frequencies.  In fact, that dependency is generally confusing,
because it causes the iowait boost to behave somewhat differently
on CPUs with the same maximum frequency and different minimum
frequencies, for example.

For this reason, replace the min field in struct sugov_cpu
with a constant and choose its values to be 1/8 of
SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE (for consistency with the intel_pstate
driver's internal governor).

[Note that policy->cpuinfo.max_freq will not be a constant any more
 after a subsequent change, so this change is depended on by it.]
