spi: document tx/rx clock delay properties

Tegra SPI controller has TX and RX trimmers to tuning the delay of
SPI master clock with respect to the data.

TX and RX tap values are based on the platform validation across the
PVT and the trimmer values vary based on the trace lengths to the
corresponding SPI devices.
