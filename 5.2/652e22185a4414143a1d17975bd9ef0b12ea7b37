dt-bindings: pps: pps-gpio PPS ECHO implementation

This patch implements the device tree binding changes required for the
PPS ECHO functionality for pps-gpio, that sysfs claims is available
already.

It adds two DT properties for configuring the PPS ECHO functionality.

This patch is provided separated from the rest of the patch per
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/submitting-patches.txt.

This patch was originally written by Lukas Senger as part of a masters
thesis project and modified for inclusion into the linux kernel by Tom
Burkart.
