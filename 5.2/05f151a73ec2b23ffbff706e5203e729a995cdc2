PCI: hv: Fix a memory leak in hv_eject_device_work()

When a device is created in new_pcichild_device(), hpdev->refs is set
to 2 (i.e. the initial value of 1 plus the get_pcichild()).

When we hot remove the device from the host, in a Linux VM we first call
hv_pci_eject_device(), which increases hpdev->refs by get_pcichild() and
then schedules a work of hv_eject_device_work(), so hpdev->refs becomes
3 (let's ignore the paired get/put_pcichild() in other places). But in
hv_eject_device_work(), currently we only call put_pcichild() twice,
meaning the 'hpdev' struct can't be freed in put_pcichild().

Add one put_pcichild() to fix the memory leak.

The device can also be removed when we run "rmmod pci-hyperv". On this
path (hv_pci_remove() -> hv_pci_bus_exit() -> hv_pci_devices_present()),
hpdev->refs is 2, and we do correctly call put_pcichild() twice in
pci_devices_present_work().
