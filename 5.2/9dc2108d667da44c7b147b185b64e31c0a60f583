ocfs2: use common file type conversion

Deduplicate the ocfs2 file type conversion implementation and remove
OCFS2_FT_* definitions - file systems that use the same file types as
defined by POSIX do not need to define their own versions and can use the
common helper functions decared in fs_types.h and implemented in
fs_types.c

Common implementation can be found via bbe7449e2599 ("fs: common
implementation of file type").
