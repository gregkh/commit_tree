mmc: sdhci: sdhci-pci-o2micro: Correctly set bus width when tuning

The O2Micro controller only supports tuning at 4-bits. So the host driver
needs to change the bus width while tuning and then set it back when done.

There was a bug in the original implementation in that mmc->ios.bus_width
also wasn't updated. Thus setting the incorrect blocksize in
sdhci_send_tuning which results in a tuning failure.
