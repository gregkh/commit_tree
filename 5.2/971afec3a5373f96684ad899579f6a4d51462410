drm/i915/gvt: ignore unexpected pvinfo write

There is pvinfo writing come from vgpu might be unexpected, like
writing to one unknown address, GVT-g should do as reserved register
to discard any invalid write. Now GVT-g lets it write to the vreg
without prompt error message, should ignore the unexpected pvinfo
write access and leave the vreg as the default value.

For possible guest query GVT-g host feature, this returned proper
value instead of wrong guest setting.

v2: ignore unexpected pvinfo write instead of return predefined value
