sh: exclude vmlinux.scr from .gitignore pattern

arch/sh/boot/.gitignore has the pattern "vmlinux*"; this is effective
not only for the current directory, but also for any sub-directories.

So, from the point of .gitignore grammar, the following check-in files
are also considered to be ignored:

  arch/sh/boot/compressed/vmlinux.scr
  arch/sh/boot/romimage/vmlinux.scr

As the manual gitignore(5) says "Files already tracked by Git are not
affected", this is not a problem as far as Git is concerned.

However, Git is not the only program that parses .gitignore because
.gitignore is useful to distinguish build artifacts from source files.

For example, tar(1) supports the --exclude-vcs-ignore option. As of
writing, this option does not work perfectly, but it intends to create
a tarball excluding files specified by .gitignore.

So, I believe it is better to fix this issue.
