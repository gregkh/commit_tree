ASoC: SOF: PCM: add period_elapsed work to fix race condition in interrupt context

The IPC implementation in SOF requires sending IPCs serially: we should
not send a new IPC command to the firmware before we get an ACK (or time
out) from firmware, and the IRQ processing is complete.

snd_pcm_period_elapsed() can be called in interrupt context before
IRQ_HANDLED is returned. When the PCM is done draining, a STOP
IPC will then be sent, which breaks the expectation that IPCs are
handled serially and leads to IPC timeouts.

This patch adds a workqueue to defer the call to snd_pcm_elapsed() after
the IRQ is handled.
