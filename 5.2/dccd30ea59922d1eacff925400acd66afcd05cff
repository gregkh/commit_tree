ARM: dts: sunxi: Improve A33 NAND transfers by using DMA

In the current state, A33 NAND controllers use PIO during
transfers. Throughput can be increased thanks to the use of DMA
(mostly during reads, because of the ECC pipelining feature).

Besides the usual addition of DMA DT properties, because the A33
NAND DMA handling is different than for older SoCs, we must also
update the compatible which has recently been introduced for this
purpose.
