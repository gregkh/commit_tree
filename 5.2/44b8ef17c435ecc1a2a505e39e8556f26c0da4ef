staging: media: tegra-vde: add proper SPDX identifiers on file that did not have it.

There was a single file for the tegra-vde driver that did not have SPDX
identifiers on it, so fix that up.  At the same time, remove the "free
form" text that specified the license of the file, as that is impossible
for any tool to properly parse.
