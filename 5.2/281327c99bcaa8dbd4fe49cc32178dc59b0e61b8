lib: make bitmap_parselist_user() a wrapper on bitmap_parselist()

Patch series "lib: rework bitmap_parselist and tests", v5.

bitmap_parselist has been evolved from a pretty simple idea for long and
now lacks for refactoring.  It is not structured, has nested loops and a
set of opaque-named variables.

Things are more complicated because bitmap_parselist() is a part of user
interface, and its behavior should not change.

In this patchset
 - bitmap_parselist_user() made a wrapper on bitmap_parselist();
 - bitmap_parselist() reworked (patch 2);
 - time measurement in test_bitmap_parselist switched to ktime_get
   (patch 3);
 - new tests introduced (patch 4), and
 - bitmap_parselist_user() testing enabled with the same testset as
   bitmap_parselist() (patch 5).

This patch (of 5):

Currently we parse user data byte after byte which leads to
overcomplification of parsing algorithm.  The only user of
bitmap_parselist_user() is not performance-critical, and so we can
duplicate user data to kernel buffer and simply call bitmap_parselist().
This rework lets us unify and simplify bitmap_parselist() and
bitmap_parselist_user(), which is done in the following patch.
