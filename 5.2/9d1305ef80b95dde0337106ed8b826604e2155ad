drm/i915: Introduce the i915_user_extension_method

An idea for extending uABI inspired by Vulkan's extension chains.
Instead of expanding the data struct for each ioctl every time we need
to add a new feature, define an extension chain instead. As we add
optional interfaces to control the ioctl, we define a new extension
struct that can be linked into the ioctl data only when required by the
user. The key advantage being able to ignore large control structs for
optional interfaces/extensions, while being able to process them in a
consistent manner.

In comparison to other extensible ioctls, the key difference is the
use of a linked chain of extension structs vs an array of tagged
pointers. For example,

struct drm_amdgpu_cs_chunk {
        __u32           chunk_id;
        __u32           length_dw;
        __u64           chunk_data;
};

struct drm_amdgpu_cs_in {
        __u32           ctx_id;
        __u32           bo_list_handle;
        __u32           num_chunks;
        __u32           _pad;
        __u64           chunks;
};

allows userspace to pass in array of pointers to extension structs, but
must therefore keep constructing that array along side the command stream.
In dynamic situations like that, a linked list is preferred and does not
similar from extra cache line misses as the extension structs themselves
must still be loaded separate to the chunks array.

v2: Apply the tail call optimisation directly to nip the worry of stack
overflow in the bud.
v3: Defend against recursion.
v4: Fixup local types to match new uabi

Opens:
- do we include the result as an out-field in each chain?
struct i915_user_extension {
	__u64 next_extension;
	__u64 name;
	__s32 result;
	__u32 mbz; /* reserved for future use */
};
* Undecided, so provision some room for future expansion.
