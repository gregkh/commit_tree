tools/memory-model: Rename some RCU relations

In preparation for adding support for SRCU, rename "crit" to
"rcu-rscs", rename "rscs" to "rcu-rscsi", and remove the restriction
to only the outermost level of nesting.

The name change is needed for disambiguating RCU read-side critical
sections from SRCU read-side critical sections.  Adding the "i" at the
end of "rcu-rscsi" emphasizes that the relation is inverted; it links
rcu_read_unlock() events to their corresponding preceding
rcu_read_lock() events.

The restriction to outermost nesting levels was never essential; it
was included mostly to show that it could be done.  Rather than add
equivalent unnecessary code for SRCU lock nesting, it seemed better to
remove the existing code.
