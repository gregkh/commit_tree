riscv: dts: add initial support for the SiFive FU540-C000 SoC

Add initial support for the SiFive FU540-C000 SoC.  This is a 28nm SoC
based around the SiFive U54-MC core complex and a TileLink
interconnect.

This file is expected to grow as more device drivers are added to the
kernel.

This patch includes a fix to the QSPI memory map due to a
documentation bug, found by ShihPo Hung <shihpo.hung@sifive.com>, adds
entries for the I2C controller, and merges all DT changes that
formerly were made dynamically by the riscv-pk BBL proxy kernel.
