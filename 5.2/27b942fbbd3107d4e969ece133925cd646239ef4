net/mlx5: Get rid of storing copy of device name

Currently mlx5 core stores copy of the PCI device name in a
mlx5_priv structure and uses pr_warn, pr_err helpers.

Get rid of the copy of this name; instead store the parent device
pointer that contains name as well as dma specific parameters.
This also allows to use kernel's well defined dev_warn, dev_err, dev_dbg
device specific print routines.

This is also a preparation patch to access non PCI parent device in
future.
