Revert "mmc: alcor: enable DMA transfer of large buffers"

This reverts commit 57ebb96c293da9f0ec56aba13c5541269a5c10b1.

Usage of the DMA page iterator was problematic here because
we were not considering offset & length of entries in the scatterlist.

Also, after further discussion, the suggested revised approach is much
more similar to the driver implementation before this commit was
applied, so revert it.
