drm/amd/display: Check scaling info when determing update type

[Why]
Surface scaling info updates can affect bandwidth and blocks. We need
to be checking these with global validation to avoid underflow or
corruption.

[How]
Drop the state->allow_modeset early exit in
dm_determine_update_type_for_commit. Most of those should be considered
fast now anyway.

Fill in scaling info and it to the surface update in atomic
check.
