slub: add comments to endif pre-processor macros

SLUB allocator makes heavy use of ifdef/endif pre-processor macros.  The
pairing of these statements is at times hard to follow e.g.  if the pair
are further than a screen apart or if there are nested pairs.  We can
reduce cognitive load by adding a comment to the endif statement of form

       #ifdef CONFIG_FOO
       ...
       #endif /* CONFIG_FOO */

Add comments to endif pre-processor macros if ifdef/endif pair is not
immediately apparent.
