net: strparser: make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

net/strparser/Kconfig:config STREAM_PARSER
net/strparser/Kconfig:  def_bool n

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.  For
clarity, we change the fcn name mod_init to dev_init at the same time.

We replace module.h with init.h and export.h ; the latter since this
file exports some syms.
