drm/gem_shmem: Use a writecombine mapping for ->vaddr

Right now, the BO is mapped as a cached region when ->vmap() is called
and the underlying object is not a dmabuf.
Doing that makes cache management a bit more complicated (you'd need
to call dma_map/unmap_sg() on the ->sgt field everytime the BO is about
to be passed to the GPU/CPU), so let's map the BO with writecombine
attributes instead (as done in most drivers).
