bridge: broute: make broute a real ebtables table

This makes broute a normal ebtables table, hooking at PREROUTING.
The broute hook is removed.

It uses skb->cb to signal to bridge rx handler that the skb should be
routed instead of being bridged.

This change is backwards compatible with ebtables as no userspace visible
parts are changed.

This means we can also remove the !ops test in ebt_register_table,
it was only there for broute table sake.
