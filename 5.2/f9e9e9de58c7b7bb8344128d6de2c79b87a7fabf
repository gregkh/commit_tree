drm/i915: Prioritise non-busywait semaphore workloads

We don't want to busywait on the GPU if we have other work to do. If we
give non-busywaiting workloads higher (initial) priority than workloads
that require a busywait, we will prioritise work that is ready to run
immediately. We then also have to be careful that we don't give earlier
semaphores an accidental boost because later work doesn't wait on other
rings, hence we keep a history of semaphore usage of the dependency chain.

v2: Stop rolling the bits into a chain and just use a flag in case this
request or any of our dependencies use a semaphore. The rolling around
was contagious as Tvrtko was heard to fall off his chair.
