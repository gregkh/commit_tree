ASoC: simple-card: Fix configuration of DAI format

When configuring a codec to be both bit-clock and frame-master, it was
found that the codec was always configured as bit-clock and frame-slave.
Looking at the simple_dai_link_of() function there appears to be two
problems with the configuration of the DAI format, which are ...

1. The function asoc_simple_parse_daifmt() is called before the function
   asoc_simple_parse_codec() and this means that the device-tree node
   for the codec has not been parsed yet, which is needed by the
   function asoc_simple_parse_daifmt() to determine who is the codec.
2. The phandle passed to asoc_simple_parse_daifmt() is the phandle to
   the 'codec' node and not the phandle of the actual codec defined by
   the 'sound-dai' property under the 'codec' node.

Fix the above by moving the call to asoc_simple_parse_daifmt() after the
the call to asoc_simple_parse_codec() and pass the phandle for the codec
to asoc_simple_parse_daifmt().
