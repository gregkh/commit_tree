Revert "ARM: tegra: Restore memory arbitration on resume from LP1 on Tegra30+"

Turned out that the actual bug was in the Memory Controller driver
that programmed shadowed registers without latching the new values
and then there was a bug on EMEM arbitration configuration calculation
that results in a wrong value being latched on resume from suspend.
The Memory Controller has been fixed properly now, hence the workaround
patch could be reverted safely.
