driver: base: Disable CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER by default

Since commit 7934779a69f1184f ("Driver-Core: disable /sbin/hotplug by
default"), the help text for the /sbin/hotplug fork-bomb says
"This should not be used today [...] creates a high system load, or
[...] out-of-memory situations during bootup".  The rationale for this
was that no recent mainstream system used this anymore (in 2010!).

A few years later, the complete uevent helper support was made optional
in commit 86d56134f1b67d0c ("kobject: Make support for uevent_helper
optional.").  However, if was still left enabled by default, to support
ancient userland.

Time passed by, and nothing should use this anymore, so it can be
disabled by default.
