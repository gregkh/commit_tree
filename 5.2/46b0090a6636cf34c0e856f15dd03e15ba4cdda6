net: mvpp2: prs: Fix parser range for VID filtering

VID filtering is implemented in the Header Parser, with one range of 11
vids being assigned for each no-loopback port.

Make sure we use the per-port range when looking for existing entries in
the Parser.

Since we used a global range instead of a per-port one, this causes VIDs
to be removed from the whitelist from all ports of the same PPv2
instance.
