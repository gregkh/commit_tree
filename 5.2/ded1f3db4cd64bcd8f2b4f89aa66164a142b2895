dmaengine: tegra210-adma: prepare for supporting newer Tegra chips

This is a preparatory patch to add support for Tegra186 and Tegra194 chips.
Following changes are necessary to make driver code generic.
 * chip_data structure is enhanced to have chip specific details and
   following are the additions to the structure
   * Offset addresses for ADMA global and channel registers
   * Offset values for Tx and Rx channel selection
   * Maximum supported Tx and Rx channels
   * Tx and Rx channel request mask
   * ADMA channel register space size
 * Make use of above chip_data to generalise the driver code

Support for Tegra186 and Tegra194 will be added in subsequent patches of
the series.
