btrfs: Introduce extent_io_tree::owner to distinguish different io_trees

Btrfs has the following different extent_io_trees used:

- fs_info::free_extents[2]
- btrfs_inode::io_tree - for both normal inodes and the btree inode
- btrfs_inode::io_failure_tree
- btrfs_transaction::dirty_pages
- btrfs_root::dirty_log_pages

If we want to trace changes in those trees, it will be pretty hard to
distinguish them.

Instead of using hard-to-read pointer address, this patch will introduce
a new member extent_io_tree::owner to track the owner.

This modification needs all the callers of extent_io_tree_init() to
accept a new parameter @owner.

This patch provides the basis for later trace events.
