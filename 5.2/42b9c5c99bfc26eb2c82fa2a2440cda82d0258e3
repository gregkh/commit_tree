bus: ti-sysc: Add support for early quirks based on register address

At least mcpdm needs an optional external clock enabled to function and
this clock typically comes from the PMIC. We can detect mcpdm based on
the interconnect target module address and set a quirk flag early.

To do this, let's initialize the clocks a bit later and add a new
function for sysc_init_early_quirks(). Note that we cannot yet enable
the early quirks for mcpdm until the optional external clocks are
handled in the in the following patch.
