ALSA: seq: Correct unlock sequence at snd_seq_client_ioctl_unlock()

The doubly unlock sequence at snd_seq_client_ioctl_unlock() is tricky.
I took a direct unref call since I thought it would avoid
misunderstanding, but rather this seems more confusing.  Let's use
snd_seq_client_unlock() consistently even if they look strange to be
called twice, and add more comments for avoiding reader's confusion.
