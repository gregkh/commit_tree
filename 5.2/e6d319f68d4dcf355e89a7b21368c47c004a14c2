scripts/spdxcheck.py: Fix path to deprecated licenses

The directory name for other licenses was changed to "deprecated" in
commit 62be257e986d ("LICENSES: Rename other to deprecated"). But it was
not changed for spdxcheck.py. As result, checkpatch failed with

  FAIL: "Blob or Tree named 'other' not found"
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "scripts/spdxcheck.py", line 240, in <module>
      spdx = read_spdxdata(repo)
