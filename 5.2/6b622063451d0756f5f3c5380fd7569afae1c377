drm: increase drm mmap_range size to 1TB

After patch "drm: Use the same mmap-range offset and size for GEM and
TTM", application failed to create bo of system memory because drm
mmap_range size decrease to 64GB from original 1TB. This is not big
enough for applications. Increase the drm mmap_range size to 1TB.
