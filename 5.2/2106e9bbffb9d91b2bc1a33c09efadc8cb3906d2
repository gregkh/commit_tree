regulator: cpcap: Remove unneeded init_data setting

This driver is using regulator core's simplified DT parsing code,
so regulator will call regulator_of_get_init_data() to get init_data.
No need to set config.init_data. In additional, current code does not
properly set the init_data setting, so just remove it.
