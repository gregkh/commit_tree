arm64: mm: Ensure we ignore the initrd if it is placed out of range

If the initrd payload isn't completely accessible via the linear map,
then we print a warning during boot and nobble the virtual address of
the payload so that we ignore it later on.

Unfortunately, since commit c756c592e442 ("arm64: Utilize
phys_initrd_start/phys_initrd_size"), the virtual address isn't
initialised until later anyway, so we need to nobble the size of the
payload to ensure that we don't try to use it later on.
