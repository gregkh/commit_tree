pinctrl: pinctrl-intel: move gpio suspend/resume to noirq phase

In current driver, SET_LATE_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS is used to install the
callbacks for suspend/resume.
GPIO pin may be used as the interrupt pin by some device. However, using
SET_LATE_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS() to install the callbacks, the resume
callback is called after resume_device_irqs(). Unintended interrupts may
arrive due to resuming device irqs first, but the GPIO controller is not
properly restored.

Normally, for a SMP system, there are multiple cores, so even when there are
unintended interrupts, BSP gets the chance to initialize the GPIO chip soon.
But when there is only 1 core is active (other cores are offlined or
single core) during resume, it is more easily to observe the unintended
interrupts.

This patch renames the suspend/resume function by adding suffix "_noirq",
and installs the callbacks using SET_NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS().
