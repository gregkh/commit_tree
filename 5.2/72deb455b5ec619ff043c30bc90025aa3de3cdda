block: remove CONFIG_LBDAF

Currently support for 64-bit sector_t and blkcnt_t is optional on 32-bit
architectures.  These types are required to support block device and/or
file sizes larger than 2 TiB, and have generally defaulted to on for
a long time.  Enabling the option only increases the i386 tinyconfig
size by 145 bytes, and many data structures already always use
64-bit values for their in-core and on-disk data structures anyway,
so there should not be a large change in dynamic memory usage either.

Dropping this option removes a somewhat weird non-default config that
has cause various bugs or compiler warnings when actually used.
