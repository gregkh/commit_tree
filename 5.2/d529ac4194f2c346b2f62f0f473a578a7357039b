vsprintf: Do not check address of well-known strings

We are going to check the address using probe_kernel_address(). It will
be more expensive and it does not make sense for well known address.

This patch splits the string() function. The variant without the check
is then used on locations that handle string constants or strings defined
as local variables.

This patch does not change the existing behavior.
