tracing: Add tracing error log

Introduce a new ftrace file, tracing/error_log, for ftrace commands to
log errors.  This is useful for allowing more complex commands such as
hist trigger and kprobe_event commands to point out specifically where
something may have gone wrong without forcing them to resort to more
ad hoc methods such as tacking error messages onto existing output
files.

To log a tracing error, call the event_log_err() function, passing it
a location string describing where it came from e.g. kprobe_events or
system:event, the command that caused the error, an array of static
error strings describing errors and an index within that array which
describes the specific error, along with the position to place the
error caret.

Reading the log displays the last (currently) 8 errors logged in the
following format:

  [timestamp] <loc>: error: <static error text>
    Command: <command that caused the error>
                      ^

Memory for the error log isn't allocated unless there has been a trace
event error, and the error log can be cleared and have its memory
freed by writing the empty string in truncation mode to it:

  # echo > tracing/error_log.
