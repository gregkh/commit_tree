ASoC: max98090: Fix restore of DAPM Muxes

The max98090 driver defines 3 DAPM muxes; one for the right line output
(LINMOD Mux), one for the left headphone mixer source (MIXHPLSEL Mux)
and one for the right headphone mixer source (MIXHPRSEL Mux). The same
bit is used for the mux as well as the DAPM enable, and although the mux
can be correctly configured, after playback has completed, the mux will
be reset during the disable phase. This is preventing the state of these
muxes from being saved and restored correctly on system reboot. Fix this
by marking these muxes as SND_SOC_NOPM.

Note this has been verified this on the Tegra124 Nyan Big which features
the MAX98090 codec.
