docs/memory-barriers.txt: Update I/O section to be clearer about CPU vs thread

The revised I/O ordering section of memory-barriers.txt introduced in
4614bbdee357 ("docs/memory-barriers.txt: Rewrite "KERNEL I/O BARRIER
EFFECTS" section") loosely refers to "the CPU", whereas the ordering
guarantees generally apply within a thread of execution that can migrate
between cores, with the scheduler providing the relevant barrier
semantics.

Reword the section to refer to "CPU thread" and call out ordering of
MMIO writes separately from ordering of writes to memory. Ben also
spotted that the string accessors are native-endian, so fix that up too.
