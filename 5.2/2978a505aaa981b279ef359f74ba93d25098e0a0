media: vimc: stream: fix thread state before sleep

The state TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE should be set just before
schedule_timeout() call, so it knows the sleep mode it should enter.
There is no point in setting TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE at the initialization
of the thread as schedule_timeout() will set the state back to
TASK_RUNNING.

This fixes a warning in __might_sleep() call, as it's expecting the
task to be in TASK_RUNNING state just before changing the state to
a sleeping state.
