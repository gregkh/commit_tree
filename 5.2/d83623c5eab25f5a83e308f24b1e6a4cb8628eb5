s390: mark __cpacf_check_opcode() and cpacf_query_func() as __always_inline

Commit e60fb8bf68d4 ("s390/cpacf: mark scpacf_query() as __always_inline")
was not enough to make sure to meet the 'i' (immediate) constraint for the
asm operands.

With CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING enabled, Laura Abbott reported error
with gcc 9.1.1:

  In file included from arch/s390/crypto/prng.c:29:
  ./arch/s390/include/asm/cpacf.h: In function 'cpacf_query_func':
  ./arch/s390/include/asm/cpacf.h:170:2: warning: asm operand 3 probably doesn't match constraints
    170 |  asm volatile(
        |  ^~~
  ./arch/s390/include/asm/cpacf.h:170:2: error: impossible constraint in 'asm'

Add more __always_inline to force inlining.
