ipv4: Fix raw socket lookup for local traffic

inet_iif should be used for the raw socket lookup. inet_iif considers
rt_iif which handles the case of local traffic.

As it stands, ping to a local address with the '-I <dev>' option fails
ever since ping was changed to use SO_BINDTODEVICE instead of
cmsg + IP_PKTINFO.

IPv6 works fine.
