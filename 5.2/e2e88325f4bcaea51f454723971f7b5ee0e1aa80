selftests: vm: Fix test build failure when built by itself

vm test build fails when test is built by itself using

make -C tools/testing/selftests/vm
or
cd tools/testing/selftests/vm; make

When the test is built invoking its Makefile directly, it defines
OUTPUT which conflicts with lib.mk's logic to install headers.

make --no-builtin-rules INSTALL_HDR_PATH=$OUTPUT/usr \
        ARCH=x86 -C ../../../.. headers_install
make[1]: Entering directory '/mnt/data/lkml/linux_5.2'
  REMOVE  shmparam.h
