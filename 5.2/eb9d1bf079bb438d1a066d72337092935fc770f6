random: only read from /dev/random after its pool has received 128 bits

Immediately after boot, we allow reads from /dev/random before its
entropy pool has been fully initialized.  Fix this so that we don't
allow this until the blocking pool has received 128 bits.

We do this by repurposing the initialized flag in the entropy pool
struct, and use the initialized flag in the blocking pool to indicate
whether it is safe to pull from the blocking pool.

To do this, we needed to rework when we decide to push entropy from the
input pool to the blocking pool, since the initialized flag for the
input pool was used for this purpose.  To simplify things, we no
longer use the initialized flag for that purpose, nor do we use the
entropy_total field any more.
