clk: tegra210: Fix default rates for HDA clocks

Currently the default clock rates for the HDA and HDA2CODEC_2X clocks
are both 19.2MHz. However, the default rates for these clocks should
actually be 51MHz and 48MHz, respectively. The current clock settings
results in a distorted output during audio playback. Correct the default
clock rates for these clocks by specifying them in the clock init table
for Tegra210.
