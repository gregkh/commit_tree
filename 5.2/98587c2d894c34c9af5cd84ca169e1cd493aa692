s390: simplify disabled_wait

The disabled_wait() function uses its argument as the PSW address when
it stops the CPU with a wait PSW that is disabled for interrupts.
The different callers sometimes use a specific number like 0xdeadbeef
to indicate a specific failure, the early boot code uses 0 and some
other calls sites use __builtin_return_address(0).

At the time a dump is created the current PSW and the registers of a
CPU are written to lowcore to make them avaiable to the dump analysis
tool. For a CPU stopped with disabled_wait the PSW and the registers
do not really make sense together, the PSW address does not point to
the function the registers belong to.

Simplify disabled_wait() by using _THIS_IP_ for the PSW address and
drop the argument to the function.
