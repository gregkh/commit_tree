clk: zynqmp: use structs for clk query responses

The driver retrieves the clock tree by querying the ATF for the clock
names, the clock topology, the parents and other attributes. The driver
needs to unmarshal the responses.

The definition of the fields in the firmware responses to the queries is
inconsistent. Some are specified as a mask, some as a shift, and by the
length of the previous field.

Define C structs for the entire firmware responses to avoid passing
pointers to arrays of an implicit size and make the format of the
responses to the queries obvious.
