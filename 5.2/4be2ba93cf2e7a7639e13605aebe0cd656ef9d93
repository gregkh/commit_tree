m68k: hp300: Handle timer counter overflow

Because hp300_read_clk() never checks the timer interrupt flag it may
fail to notice that the timer has wrapped, allowing the clock to jump
backwards. This is not a new problem.

This is resolved by checking the interrupt flag and, if need be,
taking wrap-around into account. The interrupt handler clears the flag
when it eventually executes.
