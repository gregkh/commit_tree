drm/panfrost: Make sure a BO is only unmapped when appropriate

mmu_ops->unmap() will fail when called on a BO that has not been
previously mapped, and the error path in panfrost_ioctl_create_bo()
can call drm_gem_object_put_unlocked() (which in turn calls
panfrost_mmu_unmap()) on a BO that has not been mapped yet.

Keep track of the mapped/unmapped state to avoid such issues.
