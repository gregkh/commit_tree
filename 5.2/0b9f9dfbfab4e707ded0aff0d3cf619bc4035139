dsa: Allow tag drivers to be built as modules

Make the CONFIG symbols tristate and add help text.

The broadcom and Microchip KSZ tag drivers support two different
tagging protocols in one driver. Add a configuration option for the
drivers, and then options to select the protocol.

Create a submenu for the tagging drivers.
