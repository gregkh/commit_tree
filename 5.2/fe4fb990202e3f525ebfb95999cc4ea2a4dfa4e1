ARM: 8854/1: drop -mauto-it

The assembler option -mauto-it is no longer a valid option. The last
remaining references have been removed from the documentation in
July 2009 [0].

The currently supported binutils version is 2.20 (released in
September 2009) or higher where gas supports -mimplicit-it=always.
Drop the fallback to -mauto-it and use -mimplicit-it=always only.
