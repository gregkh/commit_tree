perf/x86/intel: Allow PEBS multi-entry in watermark mode

This patch fixes a restriction/bug introduced by:

   583feb08e7f7 ("perf/x86/intel: Fix handling of wakeup_events for multi-entry PEBS")

The original patch prevented using multi-entry PEBS when wakeup_events != 0.
However given that wakeup_events is part of a union with wakeup_watermark, it
means that in watermark mode, PEBS multi-entry is also disabled which is not the
intent. This patch fixes this by checking is watermark mode is enabled.
