staging: greybus: power_supply: use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace code of the following form:

sizeof(*resp) + props_count * sizeof(struct gb_power_supply_props_desc)

with:

struct_size(resp, props, props_count)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
