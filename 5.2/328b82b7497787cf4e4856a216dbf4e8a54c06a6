tools lib traceevent: Handle trace_printk() "%px"

With security updates, %p in the kernel is hashed to protect true kernel
locations. But trace_printk() is not allowed in production systems, and
when a pointer is used, there are many times that the actual address is
needed. "%px" produces the real address. But libtraceevent does not know how
to handle that extension. Add it.
