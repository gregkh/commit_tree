lightnvm: track inflight target creations

When creation process is still in progress, target is not yet on
targets list. This causes a chance for removing whole lightnvm
subsystem by calling nvm_unregister() in the meantime and finally by
causing kernel panic inside target init function.

This patch changes the behaviour by adding kref variable which tracks
all the users of nvm_dev structure. When nvm_dev is allocated, kref
value is set to 1. Then before every target creation the value is
increased and decreased after target removal. The extra reference
is decreased when nvm subsystem is unregistered.
