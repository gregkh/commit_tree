rcu: Fix self-wakeups for grace-period kthread

The current rcu_gp_kthread_wake() function uses in_interrupt()
and thus does a self-wakeup from all interrupt contexts, including
the pointless case where the GP kthread happens to be running with
bottom halves disabled, along with the impossible case where the GP
kthread is running within an NMI handler (you are not supposed to invoke
rcu_gp_kthread_wake() from within an NMI handler.  This commit therefore
replaces the in_interrupt() with in_irq(), so that the self-wakeups
happen only from handlers for hardware interrupts and softirqs.
This also makes the code match the comment.
