kvm: x86: Include multiple indices with CPUID leaf 0x8000001d

Per the APM, "CPUID Fn8000_001D_E[D,C,B,A]X reports cache topology
information for the cache enumerated by the value passed to the
instruction in ECX, referred to as Cache n in the following
description. To gather information for all cache levels, software must
repeatedly execute CPUID with 8000_001Dh in EAX and ECX set to
increasing values beginning with 0 until a value of 00h is returned in
the field CacheType (EAX[4:0]) indicating no more cache descriptions
are available for this processor."

The termination condition is the same as leaf 4, so we can reuse that
code block for leaf 0x8000001d.
