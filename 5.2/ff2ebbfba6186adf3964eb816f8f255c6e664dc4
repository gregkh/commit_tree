tipc: introduce new capability flag for cluster

As a preparation for introducing a smooth switching between replicast
and broadcast method for multicast message, We have to introduce a new
capability flag TIPC_MCAST_RBCTL to handle this new feature.

During a cluster upgrade a node can come back with this new capabilities
which also must be reflected in the cluster capabilities field.
The new feature is only applicable if all node in the cluster supports
this new capability.
