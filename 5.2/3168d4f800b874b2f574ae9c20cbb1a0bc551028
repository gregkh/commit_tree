scsi: hisi_sas: Support all RAS events with MSI interrupts

This patch is to switch HW all error handling from PCI AER to MSI interrupt
due to non-standard PCI implementation. All HW errors which were being
reported through PCI AER can be reported through MSI interrupt also.

Do two things to complete the switch:

1. Notify FW to switch to MSI handling through ACPI DSM.

2. Add MSI handling for some hw errors, ECC errors and poison errors (we
   also call some of them AXI reuser error). They were handled only through
   PCI AER before.

For old FW reporting PCI AER events, the PCI AER handler will see that the
driver on longer support AER, and will leave the device in offlined state,
which is safe.
