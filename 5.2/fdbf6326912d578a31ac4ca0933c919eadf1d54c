net/af_iucv: remove GFP_DMA restriction for HiperTransport

af_iucv sockets over z/VM IUCV require that their skbs are allocated
in DMA memory. This restriction doesn't apply to connections over
HiperSockets. So only set this limit for z/VM IUCV sockets, thereby
increasing the likelihood that the large (and linear!) allocations for
HiperTransport messages succeed.
