net: sched: don't set tunnel for decap action

Action tunnel_key doesn't have a metadata/tunnel for release(decap) action.
Drivers do not dereference entry->tunnel pointer for that action type, so
this behavior doesn't result in a crash at the moment. However, this needs
to be corrected as a preparation for updating hardware offloads API to not
rely on rtnl lock, for which flow_action code will copy the tunnel data to
temporary buffer to prevent concurrent action overwrite from
invalidating/freeing it.
