cgroup: implement __cgroup_task_count() helper

The helper is identical to the existing cgroup_task_count()
except it doesn't take the css_set_lock by itself, assuming
that the caller does.

Also, move cgroup_task_count() implementation into
kernel/cgroup/cgroup.c, as there is nothing specific to cgroup v1.
