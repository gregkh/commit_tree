block: remove the segment size check in bio_will_gap

We fundamentally do not have a maximum segement size for devices with a
virt boundary.  So don't bother checking it, especially given that the
existing checks didn't properly work to start with as we never fully
update the front/back segment size and miss the bi_seg_front_size that
wuld have been required for some cases.
