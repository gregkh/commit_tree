habanalabs: Cancel pr_fmt() definition dependency on includes order

pr_fmt() should be defined before including linux/printk.h, either
directly or indirectly, in order to avoid redefinition of the macro.
Currently the macro definition is in habanalabs.h, which is included in
many files, and that makes the addition/reorder of includes to be prone
to compilation errors.
This patch cancels this dependency by defining the macro only in the few
source files that use it.
