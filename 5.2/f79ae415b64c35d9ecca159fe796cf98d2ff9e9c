dm snapshot: Make exception tables scalable

Use list_bl to implement the exception hash tables' buckets. This change
permits concurrent access, to distinct buckets, by multiple threads.

Also, implement helper functions to lock and unlock the exception tables
based on the chunk number of the exception at hand.

We retain the global locking, by means of down_write(), which is
replaced by the next commit.

Still, we must acquire the per-bucket spinlocks when accessing the hash
tables, since list_bl does not allow modification on unlocked lists.
