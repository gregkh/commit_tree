RISC-V: Access CSRs using CSR numbers

We should prefer accessing CSRs using their CSR numbers because:
1. It compiles fine with older toolchains.
2. We can use latest CSR names in #define macro names of CSR numbers
   as-per RISC-V spec.
3. We can access newly added CSRs even if toolchain does not recognize
   newly addes CSRs by name.
