drm/vc4: fix fb references in async update

Async update callbacks are expected to set the old_fb in the new_state
so prepare/cleanup framebuffers are balanced.

Calling drm_atomic_set_fb_for_plane() (which gets a reference of the new
fb and put the old fb) is not required, as it's taken care by
drm_mode_cursor_universal() when calling drm_atomic_helper_update_plane().
