selftests/bpf: Test variable offset stack access

Test different scenarios of indirect variable-offset stack access: out of
bound access (>0), min_off below initialized part of the stack,
max_off+size above initialized part of the stack, initialized stack.

Example of output:
  ...
  #856/p indirect variable-offset stack access, out of bound OK
  #857/p indirect variable-offset stack access, max_off+size > max_initialized OK
  #858/p indirect variable-offset stack access, min_off < min_initialized OK
  #859/p indirect variable-offset stack access, ok OK
  ...
