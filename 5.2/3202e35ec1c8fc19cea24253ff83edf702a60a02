powerpc/perf: Fix MMCRA corruption by bhrb_filter

Consider a scenario where user creates two events:

  1st event:
    attr.sample_type |= PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK;
    attr.branch_sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_ANY;
    fd = perf_event_open(attr, 0, 1, -1, 0);

  This sets cpuhw->bhrb_filter to 0 and returns valid fd.

  2nd event:
    attr.sample_type |= PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK;
    attr.branch_sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_CALL;
    fd = perf_event_open(attr, 0, 1, -1, 0);

  It overrides cpuhw->bhrb_filter to -1 and returns with error.

Now if power_pmu_enable() gets called by any path other than
power_pmu_add(), ppmu->config_bhrb(-1) will set MMCRA to -1.
