mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix BYT OCP setting

Some time ago, a fix was done for the sdhci-acpi driver, refer
commit 6e1c7d6103fe ("mmc: sdhci-acpi: Reduce Baytrail eMMC/SD/SDIO
hangs"). The same issue was not expected to affect the sdhci-pci driver,
but there have been reports to the contrary, so make the same hardware
setting change.

This patch applies to v5.0+ but before that backports will be required.
