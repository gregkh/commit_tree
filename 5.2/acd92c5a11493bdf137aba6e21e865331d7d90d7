ARM: qcom_defconfig: add options for LG Nexus 5 phone

Add wcn36xx wireless, msm vibrator, pm8941 power key, bq24190 charger,
spmi-iadc, spmi-vadc, mpu6515 gyroscope / accelerometer, and tsl2772
proximity / light drivers as modules to support the LG Nexus 5
(hammerhead) phone.

CFG80211 is changed to be a module to match MAC80211 since this isn't
required for initial bootup.

Device manager support is also added as a module since this is needed by
postmarketOS.
