Remove MODULE_ALIAS() calls that take undefined macro

These files do not define (USBHS_)DRIVER_NAME. Yet, they can be
successfully compiled because they are never built as a module by
anyone, i.e, the MODULE_ALIAS() calls are always no-op.

A problem showed up when a patch "moduleparam: Save information about
built-in modules in separate file" was applied. With this new feature,
MODULE_*() will be populated even if the callers are built-in.

To avoid the build errors, the lines referencing to the undefined
macro must be removed.

The complete fix is to remove all MODULE_* and #include <linux/module.h>
like many "make ... explicitly non-modular" commits did.

For now, I am touching only the offending lines.
