cifs:smbd When reconnecting to server, call smbd_destroy() after all MIDs have been called

commit 214bab448476 ("cifs: Call MID callback before destroying transport")
assumes that the MID callback should not take srv_mutex, this may not always
be true. SMB Direct requires the MID callback completed before calling
transport so all pending memory registration can be freed. So restore the
original calling sequence so TCP transport will use the same code, but moving
smbd_destroy() after all MID has been called.
