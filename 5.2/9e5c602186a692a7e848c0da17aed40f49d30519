parisc: Use ldcw instruction for SMP spinlock release barrier

There are only a couple of instructions that can function as a memory
barrier on parisc.  Currently, we use the sync instruction as a memory
barrier when releasing a spinlock.  However, the ldcw instruction is a
better barrier when we have a handy memory location since it operates in
the cache on coherent machines.

This patch updates the spinlock release code to use ldcw.  I also
changed the "stw,ma" instructions to "stw" instructions as it is not an
adequate barrier.
