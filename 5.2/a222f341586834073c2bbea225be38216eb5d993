mm: generalize putback scan functions

This combines two similar functions move_active_pages_to_lru() and
putback_inactive_pages() into single move_pages_to_lru().  This remove
duplicate code and makes object file size smaller.

Before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  57082	   4732	    128	  61942	   f1f6	mm/vmscan.o
After:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  55112	   4600	    128	  59840	   e9c0	mm/vmscan.o

Note, that now we are checking for !page_evictable() coming from
shrink_active_list(), which shouldn't change any behavior since that path
works with evictable pages only.
