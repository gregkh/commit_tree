ice: Put __ICE_PREPARED_FOR_RESET check in ice_prepare_for_reset

Currently we check if the __ICE_PREPARED_FOR_RESET bit is set prior to
calling ice_prepare_for_reset in ice_reset_subtask(), but we aren't
checking that bit in ice_do_reset() before calling
ice_prepare_for_reset(). This is not consistent and can cause issues if
ice_prepare_for_reset() is called prior to ice_do_reset(). Fix this by
checking if the __ICE_PREPARED_FOR_RESET bit is set internal to
ice_prepare_for_reset().
