kernel/sched/psi.c: expose pressure metrics on root cgroup

Pressure metrics are already recorded and exposed in procfs for the
entire system, but any tool which monitors cgroup pressure has to
special case the root cgroup to read from procfs.  This patch exposes
the already recorded pressure metrics on the root cgroup.
