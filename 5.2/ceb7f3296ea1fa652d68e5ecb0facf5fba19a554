kconfig: do not accept a directory for configuration output

Currently, conf_write() can be called with a directory name instead
of a file name. As far as I see, this can happen for menuconfig,
nconfig, gconfig.

If it is given with a directory path, conf_write() kindly appends
getenv("KCONFIG_CONFIG"), but this ends up with hacky dir/basename
handling, and screwed up in corner-cases like "what if KCONFIG_CONFIG
is an absolute path?" as discussed before:

  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9910037/

Since conf_write() is already messed up, I'd say "do not do it".
Please pass a file path all the time. If a directory path is specified
for the configuration output, conf_write() will simply error out.

Now that the tmp file is created in the same directory as the .config,
the previously reported "what if KCONFIG_CONFIG points to a different
file system?" has been solved.
