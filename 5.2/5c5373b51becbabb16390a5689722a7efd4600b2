drm: switch drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb888_dstclip to accept __iomem dst

Not all archs have the __io_virt() macro, so cirrus can't simply convert
pointers that way.  The drm format helpers have to use memcpy_toio()
instead.

This patch makes drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb888_dstclip() accept a __iomem
dst pointer and use memcpy_toio() instead of memcpy().  The helper
function (drm_fb_xrgb8888_to_rgb888_line) has been changed to process a
single scanline.
