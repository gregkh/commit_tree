ovl: check the capability before cred overridden

We found that it return success when we set IMMUTABLE_FL flag to a file in
docker even though the docker didn't have the capability
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE.

The commit d1d04ef8572b ("ovl: stack file ops") and dab5ca8fd9dd ("ovl: add
lsattr/chattr support") implemented chattr operations on a regular overlay
file. ovl_real_ioctl() overridden the current process's subjective
credentials with ofs->creator_cred which have the capability
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE so that it will return success in
vfs_ioctl()->cap_capable().

Fix this by checking the capability before cred overridden. And here we
only care about APPEND_FL and IMMUTABLE_FL, so get these information from
inode.

[SzM: move check and call to underlying fs inside inode locked region to
prevent two such calls from racing with each other]
