spi: gpio: Make sure spi_master_put() is called in every error path

There's a number of failure paths in spi_gpio_probe() that do not call
spi_master_put() potentially leaking memory. Fix this problem by
registering a cleanup funciont via devm_add_action_or_reset() right
after SPI controller is allocated.
