ASoC: core: move DAI pre-links initiation to snd_soc_instantiate_card

Kernel crashes when an ASoC component rebinding.

The dai_link->platforms has been reset to NULL by soc_cleanup_platform()
in soc_cleanup_card_resources() when un-registering component.  However,
it has no chance to re-allocate the dai_link->platforms when registering
the component again.

Move the DAI pre-links initiation from snd_soc_register_card() to
snd_soc_instantiate_card() to make sure all DAI pre-links get initiated
when component rebinding.

As an example, by using the following commands:
- echo -n max98357a > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/max98357a/unbind
- echo -n max98357a > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/max98357a/bind

Got the error message:
"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address".
