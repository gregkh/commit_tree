scsi: gdth: Only call dma_free_coherent when buf is not NULL in ioc_general

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

drivers/scsi/gdth.c:3662:6: warning: variable 'paddr' is used
uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

Don't attempt to call dma_free_coherent when buf is NULL (meaning that
we never called dma_alloc_coherent and initialized paddr), which avoids
this warning.
