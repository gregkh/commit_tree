lightnvm: prevent race condition on pblk remove

When we trigger nvm target remove during device hot unplug, there is
a probability to hit a general protection fault. This is caused by use
of nvm_dev thay may be freed from another (hot unplug) thread
(in the nvm_unregister function).

Introduce lock in nvme_ioctl_dev_remove function to prevent this
situation.
