coresight: Fix freeing up the coresight connections

With commit c2c729415b2d2132 ("coresight: platform: Cleanup coresight
connection handling"), we switched to re-using coresight_connections
for the coresight_device. However, that introduced a mismatch in the
alloc/free of the connections. The allocation is made using devm_*,
while we use kfree() to release the memory when a device is released
(even though we don't support this at the moment). Fix this by leaving
it to the automatic freeing of the memory.
