crypto: simd,testmgr - introduce crypto_simd_usable()

So that the no-SIMD fallback code can be tested by the crypto
self-tests, add a macro crypto_simd_usable() which wraps may_use_simd(),
but also returns false if the crypto self-tests have set a per-CPU bool
to disable SIMD in crypto code on the current CPU.
