Btrfs: fix race between send and deduplication that lead to failures and crashes

Send operates on read only trees and expects them to never change while it
is using them. This is part of its initial design, and this expection is
due to two different reasons:

1) When it was introduced, no operations were allowed to modifiy read-only
   subvolumes/snapshots (including defrag for example).

2) It keeps send from having an impact on other filesystem operations.
   Namely send does not need to keep locks on the trees nor needs to hold on
   to transaction handles and delay transaction commits. This ends up being
   a consequence of the former reason.

However the deduplication feature was introduced later (on September 2013,
while send was introduced in July 2012) and it allowed for deduplication
with destination files that belong to read-only trees (subvolumes and
snapshots).

That means that having a send operation (either full or incremental) running
in parallel with a deduplication that has the destination inode in one of
the trees used by the send operation, can result in tree nodes and leaves
getting freed and reused while send is using them. This problem is similar
to the problem solved for the root nodes getting freed and reused when a
snapshot is made against one tree that is currenly being used by a send
operation, fixed in commits [1] and [2]. These commits explain in detail
how the problem happens and the explanation is valid for any node or leaf
that is not the root of a tree as well. This problem was also discussed
and explained recently in a thread [3].

The problem is very easy to reproduce when using send with large trees
(snapshots) and just a few concurrent deduplication operations that target
files in the trees used by send. A stress test case is being sent for
fstests that triggers the issue easily. The most common error to hit is
the send ioctl return -EIO with the following messages in dmesg/syslog:

 [1631617.204075] BTRFS error (device sdc): did not find backref in send_root. inode=63292, offset=0, disk_byte=5228134400 found extent=5228134400
 [1631633.251754] BTRFS error (device sdc): parent transid verify failed on 32243712 wanted 24 found 27

The first one is very easy to hit while the second one happens much less
frequently, except for very large trees (in that test case, snapshots
with 100000 files having large xattrs to get deep and wide trees).
Less frequently, at least one BUG_ON can be hit:

That BUG_ON happens because while send is using a node, that node is COWed
by a concurrent deduplication, gets freed and gets reused as a leaf (because
a transaction commit happened in between), so when it attempts to read a
slot from the extent buffer, at ctree.c:read_node_slot(), the extent buffer
contents were wiped out and it now matches a leaf (which can even belong to
some other tree now), hitting the BUG_ON(level == 0).

Fix this concurrency issue by not allowing send and deduplication to run
in parallel if both operate on the same readonly trees, returning EAGAIN
to user space and logging an exlicit warning in dmesg/syslog.
