dm table: don't copy from a NULL pointer in realloc_argv()

For the first call to realloc_argv() in dm_split_args(), old_argv is
NULL and size is zero. Then memcpy is called, with the NULL old_argv
as the source argument and a zero size argument. AFAIK, this is
undefined behavior and generates the following warning when compiled
with UBSAN on ppc64le:
