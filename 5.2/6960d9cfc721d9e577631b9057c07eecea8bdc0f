drm/i915: Be precise in types for i915_gem_busy

Mixing u8 and -1u together leads to zero-extended integer expansion, and
comparing 0x000000ff against 0xffffffff, causing us to report a mixed
uabi-class request as not busy.

The input flag is a u8, and we want to generate a u32 uABI response,
mark our functions so.
