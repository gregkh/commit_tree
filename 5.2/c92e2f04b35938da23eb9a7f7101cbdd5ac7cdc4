block: disk_events: introduce event flags

Currently, an empty disk->events field tells the block layer not to
forward media change events to user space. This was done in commit
7c88a168da80 ("block: don't propagate unlisted DISK_EVENTs to userland")
in order to avoid events from "fringe" drivers to be forwarded to user
space. By doing so, the block layer lost the information which events
were supported by a particular block device, and most importantly,
whether or not a given device supports media change events at all.

Prepare for not interpreting the "events" field this way in the future
any more. This is done by adding an additional field "event_flags" to
struct gendisk, and two flag bits that can be set to have the device
treated like one that had the "events" field set to a non-zero value
before. This applies only to the sd and sr drivers, which are changed to
set the new flags.

The new flags are DISK_EVENT_FLAG_POLL to enforce polling of the device
for synchronous events, and DISK_EVENT_FLAG_UEVENT to tell the
blocklayer to generate udev events from kernel events.

In order to add the event_flags field to struct gendisk, the events
field is converted to an "unsigned short"; it doesn't need to hold
values bigger than 2 anyway.

This patch doesn't change behavior.
