selftests/bpf: synthetic tests to push verifier limits

Add a test to generate 1m ld_imm64 insns to stress the verifier.

Bump the size of fill_ld_abs_vlan_push_pop test from 4k to 29k
and jump_around_ld_abs from 4k to 5.5k.
Larger sizes are not possible due to 16-bit offset encoding
in jump instructions.
