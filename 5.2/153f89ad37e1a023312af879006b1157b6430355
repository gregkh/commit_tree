ARM: tegra: Update default configuration for v5.1-rc1

Most of the changes here are just symbols that are now enabled by
default, have been removed, or which have been moved around and now
appear in a different spot.

The only notable change here is that BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE is now
built-in. This is to allow BACKLIGHT_PWM to be built-in as well.
