x86/speculation/mds: Print SMT vulnerable on MSBDS with mitigations off

This code is only for CPUs which are affected by MSBDS, but are *not*
affected by the other two MDS issues.

For such CPUs, enabling the mds_idle_clear mitigation is enough to
mitigate SMT.

However if user boots with 'mds=off' and still has SMT enabled, we should
not report that SMT is mitigated:

$cat /sys//devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds
Vulnerable; SMT mitigated

But rather:
Vulnerable; SMT vulnerable
