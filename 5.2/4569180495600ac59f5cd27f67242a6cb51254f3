block: fix page leak when merging to same page

When multiple iovecs reference the same page, each get_user_page call
will add a reference to the page.  But once we've created the bio that
information gets lost and only a single reference will be dropped after
I/O completion.  Use the same_page information returned from
__bio_try_merge_page to drop additional references to pages that were
already present in the bio.

Based on a patch from Ming Lei.
