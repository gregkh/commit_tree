ice: Add function to program ethertype based filter rule on VSIs

This patch adds function to program VSI with ethertype based filter rule,
so that all flow control frames would be disallowed from being transmitted
to the client, in order to prevent malicious VSI, especially VF from
sending out PAUSE or PFC frames, and then control other VSIs traffic.
