RDMA/mlx5: Initialize roce port info before multiport master init

When working in mutliport RoCE mode it is possible to attach a slave
before the master. In that case the slave is waiting for a master to be
attached.  When the master is attached it goes over the list of waiting
slaves, finds a slave that is compatible and tries to bind it to itself.

The call stack is:
mlx5_ib_init_multiport_master() -> mlx5_ib_bind_slave_port()

In the bind function we will create a netdev notifier, but this is done
before we initialize the RoCE structure (this is done at a later stage by
the master in the ROCE stage).

Once events are delivered to that notifier we will use
mlx5_ib_get_native_port_mdev() to get the actual port and as the native
port is zero we will access an invalid index in the port structure.

Move the RoCE structure initialization to an earlier stage.
