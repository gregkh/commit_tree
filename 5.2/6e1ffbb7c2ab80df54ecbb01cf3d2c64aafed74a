PCI: Move ATS declarations outside of CONFIG_PCI

At the moment, the ATS functions are only defined when CONFIG_PCI is
enabled. Since we're about to use them in the Arm SMMUv3 driver, which
could be built with CONFIG_PCI disabled, and they are already guarded by
CONFIG_PCI_ATS which depends on CONFIG_PCI, move the definitions outside
of CONFIG_PCI.
