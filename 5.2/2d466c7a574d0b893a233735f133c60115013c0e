nvme: copy MTFA field from identify controller

We use the controller's reported maximum firmware activation time as our
timeout before resetting a controller for a failed activation notice,
but this value was never being read so we could only use the default
timeout. Copy the Identify Controller MTFA field to the corresponding
nvme_ctrl's mtfa field.

Fixes: b6dccf7fae433 (“nvme: add support for FW activation without reset”).
