afs: Implement sillyrename for unlink and rename

Implement sillyrename for AFS unlink and rename, using the NFS variant
implementation as a basis.

Note that the asynchronous file locking extender/releaser has to be
notified with a state change to stop it complaining if there's a race
between that and the actual file deletion.

A tracepoint, afs_silly_rename, is also added to note the silly rename and
the cleanup.  The afs_edit_dir tracepoint is given some extra reason
indicators and the afs_flock_ev tracepoint is given a silly-delete file
lock cancellation indicator.
