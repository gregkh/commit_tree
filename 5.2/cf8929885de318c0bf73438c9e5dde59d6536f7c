cgroup/bfq: revert bfq.weight symlink change

There's some discussion on how to do this the best, and Tejun prefers
that BFQ just create the file itself instead of having cgroups support
a symlink feature.

Hence revert commit 54b7b868e826 and 19e9da9e86c4 for 5.2, and this
can be done properly for 5.3.
