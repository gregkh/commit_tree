acpi/hmat: Register processor domain to its memory

If the HMAT Subsystem Address Range provides a valid processor proximity
domain for a memory domain, or a processor domain matches the performance
access of the valid processor proximity domain, register the memory
target with that initiator so this relationship will be visible under
the node's sysfs directory.

Since HMAT requires valid address ranges have an equivalent SRAT entry,
verify each memory target satisfies this requirement.
