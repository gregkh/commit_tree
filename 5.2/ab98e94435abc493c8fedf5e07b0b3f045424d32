drm/i915: Dump skl+ watermark changes

Currently we're only dumping out the ddb allocation changes, let's do
the same for the watermarks. This should help with debugging underruns
and whatnot.

First I tried one line per plane per wm level, but that resulted in
an obnoxious amount of lines printed. So as a compromise I settled
on a four line format, each line containing a single watermark related
value (enable,lines,blocks,min_ddb_alloc) for all 8 levels (+trans wm).
It still produces quite a lot of output but I can't really see a way
around that because we simply have a lot of data to dump.

Let's also pimp the ddb debug to print the size of the allocations
too, not just their bounds. Makes it a bit easier to compare against
the watermarks.
