ice: Fix issue reclaiming resources back to the pool after reset

This patch fixes issue reclaiming VF resources back to the pool after
reset - Since we only allocate HW vector for all VFs and track together
with resources allocation for PF with ice_search_res, we need to free VFs
resources separately, using first VF vector index to traverse the list.
Otherwise tracker starts from the last assigned vectors list and causes
maximum supported number of HW vectors, 1024 to be exhausted, depending on
the number of VFs enabled, which causes a lot of unwanted issues, and
failed to reassign vectors for VFs.
