mpls: fix warning with multi-label encap

If you configure a route with multiple labels, e.g.
  ip route add 10.10.3.0/24 encap mpls 16/100 via 10.10.2.2 dev ens4
A warning is logged:
  kernel: [  130.561819] netlink: 'ip': attribute type 1 has an invalid
  length.

This happens because mpls_iptunnel_policy has set the type of
MPLS_IPTUNNEL_DST to fixed size NLA_U32.
Change it to a minimum size.
nla_get_labels() does the remaining validation.
