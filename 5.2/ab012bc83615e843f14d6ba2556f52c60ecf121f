LSM: fix documentation for the msg_queue_* hooks

The msg_queue_* hooks were changed in the commit
"msg/security: Pass kern_ipc_perm not msg_queue into the msg_queue
security hooks" (d8c6e8543294). The type of the argument msq was changed
from msq_queue to kern_ipc_perm. This patch updates the documentation
for the hooks accordingly.
