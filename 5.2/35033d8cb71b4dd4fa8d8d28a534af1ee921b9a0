ALSA: firewire-motu: add support MOTU 8pre FireWire

This commit adds support for MOTU 8pre FireWire, which was shipped 2007
and nowadays already discontinued. Userspace applications can transmit
and receive PCM frames and MIDI messages for this model via ALSA PCM
interface and RawMidi/Sequencer interfaces.

Like the other models of MOTU FireWire series, this model has many
quirks in its CIP.

At first, data channels for two pairs of optical interfaces. At lower
sampling transmission frequency, i.e. 44.1 and 48.0 kHz, one pair is
available for ADAT data, thus 8 data chunks are transferred by CIP.
At middle sampling transmission frequency, i.e.  88.2 and 96.0 kHz,
two pairs are available to keep 8 chunks for ADAT data, thus CIP
still includes 8 data chunks.

Apart from data chunks for optical interface, CIP includes fixed number
of data chunks. In tx stream, two chunks for status message, eight
chunks for samples from analog 1-8 input, two chunks for mix-return.
In rx stream, two chunks for control message, two chunks for main 1-2
output, two chunks for phone 1-2 output, two chunks for dummy 1-2.

CIP header in tx stream includes quirks for its dbs and dbc fields.
The value of dbs field is fixed to 0x13, against its actual size.
The value of dbc field is firstly updated to 0x07 from zero, then
it's incremented continuously according to actual number of data h
blocks.

Finally, the model has own bits to disable frame fetch.

This commit uses several options to absorb the above quirks.
