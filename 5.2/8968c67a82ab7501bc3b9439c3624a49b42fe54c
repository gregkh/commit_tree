bpf, arm64: remove prefetch insn in xadd mapping

Prefetch-with-intent-to-write is currently part of the XADD mapping in
the AArch64 JIT and follows the kernel's implementation of atomic_add.
This may interfere with other threads executing the LDXR/STXR loop,
leading to potential starvation and fairness issues. Drop the optional
prefetch instruction.
