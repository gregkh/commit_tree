afs: Add more tracepoints

Add four more tracepoints:

 (1) afs_make_fs_call1 - Split from afs_make_fs_call but takes a filename
     to log also.

 (2) afs_make_fs_call2 - Like the above but takes two filenames to log.

 (3) afs_lookup - Log the result of doing a successful lookup, including a
     negative result (fid 0:0).

 (4) afs_get_tree - Log the set up of a volume for mounting.

It also extends the name buffer on the afs_edit_dir tracepoint to 24 chars
and puts quotes around the filename in the text representation.
