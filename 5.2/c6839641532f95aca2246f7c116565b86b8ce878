ASoC: mediatek: Reduce repititive code on mtk_regmap_update_bits.

Change the signature of mtk_regmap_update_bits to also take a shift, and
warn when reg >= 0 but shift < 0. This reduce the code repetition
on the calling side, and prevent future UBSAN warning when some of the
xxx_shift and xxx_reg are both set to -1.
