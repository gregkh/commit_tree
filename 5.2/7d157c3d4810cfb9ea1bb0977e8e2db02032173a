btrfs: use common file type conversion

Deduplicate the btrfs file type conversion implementation - file systems
that use the same file types as defined by POSIX do not need to define
their own versions and can use the common helper functions decared in
fs_types.h and implemented in fs_types.c

Common implementation can be found via commit:
bbe7449e2599 "fs: common implementation of file type"
