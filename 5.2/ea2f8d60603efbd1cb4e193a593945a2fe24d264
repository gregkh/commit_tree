x86/fault: Make fault messages more succinct

So we are going to be staring at those in the next years, let's make
them more succinct. In particular:

 - change "address = " to "address: "

 - "-privileged" reads funny. It should be simply "kernel" or "user"

 - "from kernel code" reads funny too. "kernel mode" or "user mode" is
   more natural.

An actual example says more than 1000 words, of course:

  [    0.248370] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000005b8
  [    0.249120] #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
  [    0.249717] #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
