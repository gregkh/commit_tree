afs: Fix application of the results of a inline bulk status fetch

Fix afs_do_lookup() such that when it does an inline bulk status fetch op,
it will update inodes that are already extant (something that afs_iget()
doesn't do) and to cache permits for each inode created (thereby avoiding a
follow up FS.FetchStatus call to determine this).

Extant inodes need looking up in advance so that their cb_break counters
before and after the operation can be compared.  To this end, the inode
pointers are cached so that they don't need looking up again after the op.
