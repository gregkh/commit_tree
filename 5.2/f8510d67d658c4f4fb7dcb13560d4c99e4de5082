iwlwifi: mvm: Change an 'else if' into an 'else' in iwl_mvm_send_add_bcast_sta

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/sta.c:2114:12: warning: variable
'queue' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
[-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

Clang can't evaluate at this point that WARN(1, ...) always returns true
because __ret_warn_on is defined as !!(condition), which isn't
immediately evaluated as 1. Change this branch to else so that it's
clear to Clang that we intend to bail out here.
