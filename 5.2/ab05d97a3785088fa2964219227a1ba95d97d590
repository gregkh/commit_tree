cpufreq: Don't find governor for setpolicy drivers in cpufreq_init_policy()

In cpufreq_init_policy() we will check if there's last_governor for target
and setpolicy type. However last_governor is set only if has_target() is
true in cpufreq_offline(). That means find last_governor for setpolicy
type is pointless. Also new_policy.governor will not be used if ->setpolicy
callback is set in cpufreq_set_policy().

Moreover, there's duplicate ->setpolicy check in using default policy path.
Let's add a new helper function to avoid it. Also update comments.
