net: Always descend into dsa/

Jiri reported that with a kernel built with CONFIG_FIXED_PHY=y,
CONFIG_NET_DSA=m and CONFIG_NET_DSA_LOOP=m, we would not get to a
functional state where the mock-up driver is registered. Turns out that
we are not descending into drivers/net/dsa/ unconditionally, and we
won't be able to link-in dsa_loop_bdinfo.o which does the actual mock-up
mdio device registration.
