percpu: introduce helper to determine if two regions overlap

While block hints were always accurate, it's possible when spanning
across blocks that we miss updating the chunk's contig_hint. Rather than
rely on correctness of the boundaries of hints, do a full overlap
comparison.

A future patch introduces the scan_hint which makes the contig_hint
slightly fuzzy as they can at times be smaller than the actual hint.
