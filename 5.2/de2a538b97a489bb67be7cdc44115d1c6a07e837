arm64: dts: imx8mq: Combine PCIE power domains

According to NXP's FAE feedback and a comment in ATF firmware, PCIE1
and PCIE2 power domains can't really be used independently. Due to
shared reset line both power domains have to be turned on at the same
time. Account for that quirk by combining PCIE power domains into a
single 'pgc_pcie' power domain.
