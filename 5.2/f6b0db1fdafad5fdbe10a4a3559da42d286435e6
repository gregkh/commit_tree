kvm: nVMX: Check "load IA32_PAT" VM-exit control on vmentry

According to section "Checks on Host Control Registers and MSRs" in Intel
SDM vol 3C, the following check is performed on vmentry:

    If the "load IA32_PAT" VM-exit control is 1, the value of the field
    for the IA32_PAT MSR must be one that could be written by WRMSR
    without fault at CPL 0. Specifically, each of the 8 bytes in the
    field must have one of the values 0 (UC), 1 (WC), 4 (WT), 5 (WP),
    6 (WB), or 7 (UC-).
