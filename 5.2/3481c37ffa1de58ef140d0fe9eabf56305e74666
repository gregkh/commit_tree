mm/vmscan: drop may_writepage and classzone_idx from direct reclaim begin template

There are three tracepoints using this template, which are
mm_vmscan_direct_reclaim_begin,
mm_vmscan_memcg_reclaim_begin,
mm_vmscan_memcg_softlimit_reclaim_begin.

Regarding mm_vmscan_direct_reclaim_begin,
sc.may_writepage is !laptop_mode, that's a static setting, and
reclaim_idx is derived from gfp_mask which is already show in this
tracepoint.

Regarding mm_vmscan_memcg_reclaim_begin,
may_writepage is !laptop_mode too, and reclaim_idx is (MAX_NR_ZONES-1),
which are both static value.

mm_vmscan_memcg_softlimit_reclaim_begin is the same with
mm_vmscan_memcg_reclaim_begin.

So we can drop them all.
