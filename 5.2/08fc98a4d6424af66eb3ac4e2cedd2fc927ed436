ext4: fix use-after-free in dx_release()

The buffer_head (frames[0].bh) and it's corresping page can be
potentially free'd once brelse() is done inside the for loop
but before the for loop exits in dx_release(). It can be free'd
in another context, when the page cache is flushed via
drop_caches_sysctl_handler(). This results into below data abort
when accessing info->indirect_levels in dx_release().
