efi/libstub: Refactor the cmd_stubcopy Makefile command

It took me a while to understand what is going on in the nested
if-blocks.

Simplify it by removing unneeded code.

  - if_changed automatically adds 'set -e', so any failure in the
    series of commands makes it immediately fail as a whole.
    So, the outer if block is entirely redundant.

  - Since commit 9c2af1c7377a ("kbuild: add .DELETE_ON_ERROR special target"),
    GNU Make automatically deletes the target on any failure
    in its recipe. The explicit 'rm -f $@' is redundant.

  - Surrounding commands with ( ) will spawn a subshell to execute them
    in it, but it is rarely useful to do so.
