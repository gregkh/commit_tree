percpu: do not search past bitmap when allocating an area

pcpu_find_block_fit() guarantees that a fit is found within
PCPU_BITMAP_BLOCK_BITS. Iteration is used to determine the first fit as
it compares against the block's contig_hint. This can lead to
incorrectly scanning past the end of the bitmap. The behavior was okay
given the check after for bit_off >= end and the correctness of the
hints from pcpu_find_block_fit().

This patch fixes this by bounding the end offset by the number of bits
in a chunk.
