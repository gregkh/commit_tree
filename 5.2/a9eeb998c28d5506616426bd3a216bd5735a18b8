hv_sock: Add support for delayed close

Currently, hvsock does not implement any delayed or background close
logic. Whenever the hvsock socket is closed, a FIN is sent to the peer, and
the last reference to the socket is dropped, which leads to a call to
.destruct where the socket can hang indefinitely waiting for the peer to
close it's side. The can cause the user application to hang in the close()
call.

This change implements proper STREAM(TCP) closing handshake mechanism by
sending the FIN to the peer and the waiting for the peer's FIN to arrive
for a given timeout. On timeout, it will try to terminate the connection
(i.e. a RST). This is in-line with other socket providers such as virtio.

This change does not address the hang in the vmbus_hvsock_device_unregister
where it waits indefinitely for the host to rescind the channel. That
should be taken up as a separate fix.
