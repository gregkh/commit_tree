wimax/i2400m/control: Mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warning:

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
