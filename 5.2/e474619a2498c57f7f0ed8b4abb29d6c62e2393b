net: sched: flower: don't check for rtnl on head dereference

Flower classifier only changes root pointer during init and destroy. Cls
API implements reference counting for tcf_proto, so there is no danger of
concurrent access to tp when it is being destroyed, even without protection
provided by rtnl lock.

Implement new function fl_head_dereference() to dereference tp->root
without checking for rtnl lock. Use it in all flower function that obtain
head pointer instead of rtnl_dereference().
