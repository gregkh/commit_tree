block: sed-opal: unify cmd start

Every step starts with resetting the cmd buffer as well as the comid and
constructs the appropriate OPAL_CALL command. Consequently, those
actions may be combined into one generic function. On should take care
that the opening and closing tokens for the argument list are already
emitted by cmd_start and cmd_finalize respectively and thus must not be
additionally added.
