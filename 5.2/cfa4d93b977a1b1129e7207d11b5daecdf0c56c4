csky: Add perf callchain support

This patch add support for perf callchain sampling on csky platform.
As fp is used to unwind the stack, the program being sampled and the
C library need to be compiled with -mbacktrace for user callchains,
kernel callchains require CONFIG_STACKTRACE = y.

Changelog:
 - Coding convention with Christoph's advice for riscv's.
