bpf: add map_lookup_elem_sys_only for lookups from syscall side

Add a callback map_lookup_elem_sys_only() that map implementations
could use over map_lookup_elem() from system call side in case the
map implementation needs to handle the latter differently than from
the BPF data path. If map_lookup_elem_sys_only() is set, this will
be preferred pick for map lookups out of user space. This hook is
used in a follow-up fix for LRU map, but once development window
opens, we can convert other map types from map_lookup_elem() (here,
the one called upon BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_ELEM cmd is meant) over to use
the callback to simplify and clean up the latter.
