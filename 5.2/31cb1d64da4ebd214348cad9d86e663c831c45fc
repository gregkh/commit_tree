block: Don't revalidate bdev of hidden gendisk

When hidden gendisk is revalidated, there's no point in revalidating
associated block device as there's none. We would thus just create new
bdev inode, report "detected capacity change from 0 to XXX" message and
evict the bdev inode again. Avoid this pointless dance and confusing
message in the kernel log.
