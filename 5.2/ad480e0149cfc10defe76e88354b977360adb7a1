arm64: dts: msm8998-mtp: thermal: Remove skin and battery thermal zones

The msm8998-mtp doesn't have TSENS-based sensors wired up for skin and
battery thermal zones. TSENS sensors should be common across all boards
using the SoC and shouldn't be board-specific as these entries.

They also show the following error when trying to read the temperature

   cat: read error: Invalid argument

Remove these board-specific erroneous thermal zones.
