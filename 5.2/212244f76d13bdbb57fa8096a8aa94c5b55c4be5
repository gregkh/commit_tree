hwmon: (max6650) Drop call to thermal_cdev_update

The call to thermal_cdev_update() causes any fan connected to the chip
to stop immediately. If the thermal subsystem is not set up to actually
handle the chip as cooling device, the remains stopped until is is
restarted manually with a write to a sysfs attribute.

There is evidence that thermal_cdev_update() should only be called from
thermal governors, not from thermal cooling device drivers. Drop the call.
