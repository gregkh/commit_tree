ext4: fix prefetchw of NULL page

In ext4_mpage_readpages(), if the parameter pages is not NULL, another
parameter page is NULL. At the first time prefetchw(&page->flags)
works on NULL. From second time, prefetchw(&page->flags) always works on
the last consumed page. This might do little improvment for handling
current page. So prefetchw() should be called while the page pointer
has just been updated.
