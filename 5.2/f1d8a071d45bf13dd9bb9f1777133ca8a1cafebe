counter: 104-quad-8: Add Generic Counter interface support

This patch adds support for the Generic Counter interface to the
104-QUAD-8 driver. The existing 104-QUAD-8 device interface should not
be affected by this patch; all changes are intended as supplemental
additions as perceived by the user.

Generic Counter Counts are created for the eight quadrature channel
counts, as well as their respective quadrature A and B Signals (which
are associated via respective Synapse structures) and respective index
Signals.

The new Generic Counter interface sysfs attributes are intended to
expose the same functionality and data available via the existing
104-QUAD-8 IIO device interface; the Generic Counter interface serves
to provide the respective functionality and data in a standard way
expected of counter devices.
