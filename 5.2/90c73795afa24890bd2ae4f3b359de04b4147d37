KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add a new KVM device for the XIVE native exploitation mode

This is the basic framework for the new KVM device supporting the XIVE
native exploitation mode. The user interface exposes a new KVM device
to be created by QEMU, only available when running on a L0 hypervisor.
Support for nested guests is not available yet.

The XIVE device reuses the device structure of the XICS-on-XIVE device
as they have a lot in common. That could possibly change in the future
if the need arise.
