drm/i915/icl: Default to Thread Group preemption for compute workloads

We assumed that the default preemption granularity is fine for ICL.
Unfortunately, it turns out that some drivers don't support mid-thread
preemption for compute workloads.
If a workload that doesn't support mid-thread preemption gets mid-thread
preempted, we're going to observe a GPU hang.
While I'm here, let's also update the "workaround" naming.
