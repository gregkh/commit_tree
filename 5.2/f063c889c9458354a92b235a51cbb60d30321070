bpf: add specification for BTF Var and DataSec kinds

This adds the BTF specification and UAPI bits for supporting BTF Var
and DataSec kinds. This is following LLVM upstream commit ac4082b77e07
("[BPF] Add BTF Var and DataSec Support") which has been merged recently.
Var itself is for describing a global variable and DataSec to describe
ELF sections e.g. data/bss/rodata sections that hold one or multiple
global variables.
