btrfs: Optimize unallocated chunks discard

Currently unallocated chunks are always trimmed. For example
2 consecutive trims on large storage would trim freespace twice
irrespective of whether the space was actually allocated or not between
those trims.

Optimise this behavior by exploiting the newly introduced alloc_state
tree of btrfs_device. A new CHUNK_TRIMMED bit is used to mark
those unallocated chunks which have been trimmed and have not been
allocated afterwards. On chunk allocation the respective underlying devices'
physical space will have its CHUNK_TRIMMED flag cleared. This avoids
submitting discards for space which hasn't been changed since the last
time discard was issued.

This applies to the single mount period of the filesystem as the
information is not stored permanently.
