KVM: lapic: Busy wait for timer to expire when using hv_timer

...now that VMX's preemption timer, i.e. the hv_timer, also adjusts its
programmed time based on lapic_timer_advance_ns.  Without the delay, a
guest can see a timer interrupt arrive before the requested time when
KVM is using the hv_timer to emulate the guest's interrupt.
