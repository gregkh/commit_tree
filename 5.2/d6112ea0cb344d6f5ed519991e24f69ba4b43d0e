crypto: ccp - introduce SEV_GET_ID2 command

The current definition and implementation of the SEV_GET_ID command
does not provide the length of the unique ID returned by the firmware.
As per the firmware specification, the firmware may return an ID
length that is not restricted to 64 bytes as assumed by the SEV_GET_ID
command.

Introduce the SEV_GET_ID2 command to overcome with the SEV_GET_ID
limitations. Deprecate the SEV_GET_ID in the favor of SEV_GET_ID2.

At the same time update SEV API web link.
