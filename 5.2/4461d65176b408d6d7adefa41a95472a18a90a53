pps: descriptor-based gpio

This patch changes the GPIO access for the pps-gpio driver from the
integer based API to the descriptor based API.

The integer based API is considered deprecated and the descriptor based
API is the preferred way to access GPIOs as per
Documentation/driver-api/gpio/intro.rst

No changes are made to userspace interfaces.
