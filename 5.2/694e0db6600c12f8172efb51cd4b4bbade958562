crypto: vmx - return correct error code on failed setkey

In the VMX implementations of AES and AES modes, return -EINVAL when an
invalid key length is provided, rather than some unusual error code
determined via a series of additions.  This makes the behavior match the
other AES implementations in the kernel's crypto API.
