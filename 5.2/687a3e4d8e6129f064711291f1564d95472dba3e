treewide: remove SPDX "WITH Linux-syscall-note" from kernel-space headers

The "WITH Linux-syscall-note" should be added to headers exported to the
user-space.

Some kernel-space headers have "WITH Linux-syscall-note", which seems a
mistake.

[1] arch/x86/include/asm/hyperv-tlfs.h

Commit 5a4858032217 ("x86/hyper-v: move hyperv.h out of uapi") moved
this file out of uapi, but missed to update the SPDX License tag.

[2] include/asm-generic/shmparam.h

Commit 76ce2a80a28e ("Rename include/{uapi => }/asm-generic/shmparam.h
really") moved this file out of uapi, but missed to update the SPDX
License tag.

[3] include/linux/qcom-geni-se.h

Commit eddac5af0654 ("soc: qcom: Add GENI based QUP Wrapper driver")
added this file, but I do not see a good reason why its license tag must
include "WITH Linux-syscall-note".
