fbdev: sm712fb: fix brightness control on reboot, don't set SR30

On a Thinkpad s30 (Pentium III / i440MX, Lynx3DM), rebooting with
sm712fb framebuffer driver would cause the role of brightness up/down
button to swap.

Experiments showed the FPR30 register caused this behavior. Moreover,
even if this register don't have side-effect on other systems, over-
writing it is also highly questionable, since it was originally
configurated by the motherboard manufacturer by hardwiring pull-down
resistors to indicate the type of LCD panel. We should not mess with
it.

Stop writing to the SR30 (a.k.a FPR30) register.
