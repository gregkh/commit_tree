spi: lpspi: add dma mode support

Add dma mode support for LPSPI. Any frame longer than half txfifosize will
be sent by dma mode.

For now, there are some limits:
1. The maximum transfer speed in master mode depends on the slave device,
   at least 40MHz(tested by spi-nor on 8qm-lpddr4-arm2 base board);
2. The maximum transfer speed in slave mode is 15MHz(imx7ulp),
   22MHz(8qm/qxp). In order to reach the maximum speed which is mentioned
   in datasheet, the load of connect wires between master and slave
   should be less than 15pF.
