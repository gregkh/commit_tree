arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7796: remove unneeded sound #address/size-cells

commit 78bc93b3ffb2 ("arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7796: Add address
properties to rcar_sound port nodes") added missing #address-cells
and #size-cells for sound ports.
But, these are based on platform, not on SoC. This patch cleanups it.
