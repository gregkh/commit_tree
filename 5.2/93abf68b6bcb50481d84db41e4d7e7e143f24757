mfd: cros_ec: Update the EC feature codes

Update the feature enum for the Chromebook Embedded Controller to the
latest version. Some of these enums are still not used in the kernel but
we might be also interested on have these enums up to date. Userspace
can use them to query the features to the EC via the cros-ec character
device.

While here, also fix a typo in one comment in the enum.
