btrfs: extent_io: Handle errors better in extent_writepages()

We can only get <=0 from extent_write_cache_pages, add an ASSERT() for
it just in case.

Then instead of submitting the write bio even if we got some error,
check the return value first.
If we have already hit some error, just clean up the corrupted or
half-baked bio, and return error.

If there is no error so far, then call flush_write_bio() and return the
result.
