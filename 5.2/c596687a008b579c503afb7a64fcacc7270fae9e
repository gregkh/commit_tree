cgroup: Fix css_task_iter_advance_css_set() cset skip condition

While adding handling for dying task group leaders c03cd7738a83
("cgroup: Include dying leaders with live threads in PROCS
iterations") added an inverted cset skip condition to
css_task_iter_advance_css_set().  It should skip cset if it's
completely empty but was incorrectly testing for the inverse condition
for the dying_tasks list.  Fix it.
