drm/arm/malidp:- Use the newly introduced malidp_format_get_bpp() instead of relying on cpp for calculating framebuffer size

Formats like DRM_FORMAT_VUY101010, DRM_FORMAT_YUV420_8BIT and
DRM_FORMAT_YUV420_10BIT are expressed in bits per pixel as they have a non
integer value of cpp (thus denoted as '0' in drm_format_info[]). Therefore,
the calculation of AFBC framebuffer size needs to use malidp_format_get_bpp().

Changes since v3 (series):
- Added the ack
- Rebased on the latest drm-misc-next
