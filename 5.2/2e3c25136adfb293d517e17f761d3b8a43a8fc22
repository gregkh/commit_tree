btrfs: extent_io: add proper error handling to lock_extent_buffer_for_io()

This function needs some extra checks on locked pages and eb.  For error
handling we need to unlock locked pages and the eb.

There is a rare >0 return value branch, where all pages get locked
while write bio is not flushed.

Thankfully it's handled by the only caller, btree_write_cache_pages(),
as later write_one_eb() call will trigger submit_one_bio().  So there
shouldn't be any problem.
