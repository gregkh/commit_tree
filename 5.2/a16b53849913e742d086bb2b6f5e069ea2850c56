list: add function list_rotate_to_front()

Patch series "mm: Use slab_list list_head instead of lru", v5.

Currently the slab allocators (ab)use the struct page 'lru' list_head.  We
have a list head for slab allocators to use, 'slab_list'.

During v2 it was noted by Christoph that the SLOB allocator was reaching
into a list_head, this version adds 2 patches to the front of the set to
fix that.

Clean up all three allocators by using the 'slab_list' list_head instead
of overloading the 'lru' list_head.

This patch (of 7):

Currently if we wish to rotate a list until a specific item is at the
front of the list we can call list_move_tail(head, list).  Note that the
arguments are the reverse way to the usual use of list_move_tail(list,
head).  This is a hack, it depends on the developer knowing how the
list_head operates internally which violates the layer of abstraction
offered by the list_head.  Also, it is not intuitive so the next developer
to come along must study list.h in order to fully understand what is meant
by the call, while this is 'good for' the developer it makes reading the
code harder.  We should have an function appropriately named that does
this if there are users for it intree.

By grep'ing the tree for list_move_tail() and list_tail() and attempting
to guess the argument order from the names it seems there is only one
place currently in the tree that does this - the slob allocatator.

Add function list_rotate_to_front() to rotate a list until the specified
item is at the front of the list.
