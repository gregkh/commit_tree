perf/x86/intel/ds: Fix EVENT vs. UEVENT PEBS constraints

This patch fixes an bug revealed by the following commit:

  6b89d4c1ae85 ("perf/x86/intel: Fix INTEL_FLAGS_EVENT_CONSTRAINT* masking")

That patch modified INTEL_FLAGS_EVENT_CONSTRAINT() to only look at the event code
when matching a constraint. If code+umask were needed, then the
INTEL_FLAGS_UEVENT_CONSTRAINT() macro was needed instead.
This broke with some of the constraints for PEBS events.

Several of them, including the one used for cycles:p, cycles:pp, cycles:ppp
fell in that category and caused the event to be rejected in PEBS mode.
In other words, on some platforms a cmdline such as:

  $ perf top -e cycles:pp

would fail with -EINVAL.

This patch fixes this bug by properly using INTEL_FLAGS_UEVENT_CONSTRAINT()
when needed in the PEBS constraint tables.
