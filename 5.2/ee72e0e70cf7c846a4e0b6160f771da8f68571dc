riscv: Add the support for c.ebreak check in is_valid_bugaddr()

The macro __BUG_INSN currently is defined as the "ebreak" opcode.
The is_valid_bugaddr() function compares the instruction pointed to by
$sepc with macro __BUG_INSN to check whether the current trap exception
is caused by an "ebreak" instruction. However, this check flow is possibly
erroneous because if C extension is supported, the expected trap
instruction "ebreak" is possibly translated to "c.ebreak" by the assembler.
Therefore, it requires a mechanism to distinguish the length of the
instruction in $spec and compare it to the correct trap instruction.
