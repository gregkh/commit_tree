scsi: target/core: Fix a race condition in the LUN lookup code

The rcu_dereference(deve->se_lun) expression occurs twice in the LUN lookup
functions. Since these expressions are not serialized against deve->se_lun
assignments each of these expressions may yield a different result. Avoid
that the wrong LUN pointer is stored in se_cmd by reading deve->se_lun only
once.
