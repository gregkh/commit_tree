ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Add headphone/headset detection

This device can detect the insertion/removal of headphones and headsets.
Enable reporting this status by enabling this interrupt and forwarding
this to upper-layers if a jack has been defined.

This jack definition and the resulting operation from a jack detection
event must currently be defined by sound card platform code until CODEC
outputs to jack mappings can be defined generically.
