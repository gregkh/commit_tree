fbdev: sm712fb: fix support for 1024x768-16 mode

In order to support the 1024x600 panel on Yeeloong Loongson MIPS
laptop, the original 1024x768-16 table was modified to 1024x600-16,
without leaving the original. It causes problem on x86 laptop as
the 1024x768-16 support was still claimed but not working.

Fix it by introducing the 1024x768-16 mode.
