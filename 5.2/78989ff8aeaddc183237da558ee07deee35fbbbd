ASoC: SOF: xtensa: fix undefined references

The SND_SOC_INTEL_COMMON Kconfig was removed months ago from SOF
Kconfig files but is still selected instead of the correct
SND_SOC_SOF_INTEL_COMMON kconfig which does select xtensa stuff,
leading to the following errors.

ld: sound/soc/sof/sof-acpi-dev.o:(.rodata+0x120): undefined reference
to `sof_xtensa_arch_ops'
ld: sound/soc/sof/sof-acpi-dev.o:(.rodata+0x180): undefined reference
