bpf: Document BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SYSCTL

Add documentation for BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SYSCTL, including general
info, attach type, context, return code, helpers, example and usage
considerations.

A separate file prog_cgroup_sysctl.rst is added to Documentation/bpf/.

In the future more program types can be documented in their own
prog_<name>.rst files.

Another way to place program type specific documentation would be to
group program types somehow (e.g. cgroup.rst for all cgroup-bpf
programs), but it may not scale well since some program types may belong
to different groups, e.g. BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB can be documented
together with either cgroup-bpf programs or programs that access skb.

The new file is added to the index and verified by `make htmldocs` /
sanity-check by lynx.
