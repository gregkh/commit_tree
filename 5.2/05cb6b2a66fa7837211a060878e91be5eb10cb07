mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add erratum eSDHC-A001 and A-008358 support

eSDHC-A001: The data timeout counter (SYSCTL[DTOCV]) is not
reliable for DTOCV values 0x4(2^17 SD clock), 0x8(2^21 SD clock),
and 0xC(2^25 SD clock). The data timeout counter can count from
2^13â€“2^27, but for values 2^17, 2^21, and 2^25, the timeout
counter counts for only 2^13 SD clocks.
A-008358: The data timeout counter value loaded into the timeout
counter is less than expected and can result into early timeout
error in case of eSDHC data transactions. The table below shows
the expected vs actual timeout period for different values of
SYSCTL[DTOCV]:
these two erratum has the same quirk to control it, and set
SDHCI_QUIRK_RESET_AFTER_REQUEST to fix above issue.
