vxlan: Don't assume linear buffers in error handler

In commit c3a43b9fec8a ("vxlan: ICMP error lookup handler") I wrongly
assumed buffers from icmp_socket_deliver() would be linear. This is not
the case: icmp_socket_deliver() only guarantees we have 8 bytes of linear
data.

Eric fixed this same issue for fou and fou6 in commits 26fc181e6cac
("fou, fou6: do not assume linear skbs") and 5355ed6388e2 ("fou, fou6:
avoid uninit-value in gue_err() and gue6_err()").

Use pskb_may_pull() instead of checking skb->len, and take into account
the fact we later access the VXLAN header with udp_hdr(), so we also
need to sum skb_transport_header() here.
