arm64: imx: Fix build error without CONFIG_SOC_BUS

During randconfig builds, I occasionally run into an invalid configuration

drivers/soc/imx/soc-imx8.o: In function `imx8_soc_init':
soc-imx8.c:(.init.text+0x144): undefined reference to `soc_device_register'

while CONFIG_SOC_BUS is not set, the building failed like this. This patch
selects SOC_BUS to fix it.
