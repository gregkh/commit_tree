ice: Fix issue when adding more than allowed VLANs

This patch fixes issue with non trusted VFs being able to add more than
permitted number of VLANs by adding a check in ice_vc_process_vlan_msg.
Also don't return an error in this case as the VF does not need to know
that it is not trusted.

Also rework ice_vsi_kill_vlan to use the right types.
