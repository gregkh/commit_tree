Input: synaptics - enable SMBus on ThinkPad E480 and E580

They are capable of using intertouch and it works well with
psmouse.synaptics_intertouch=1, so add them to the list.

Without it, scrolling and gestures are jumpy, three-finger pinch gesture
doesn't work and three- or four-finger swipes sometimes get stuck.
