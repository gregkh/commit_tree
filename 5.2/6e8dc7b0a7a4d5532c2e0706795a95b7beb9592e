drm/amd/display: Don't warn when DC update type > DM guess

[Why]
DM thinks that the update type should be full whenever a stream or
plane is added or removed (including recreations).

This won't match in the case where DC thinks what looks like a fast
update to DM is actually a medium or full - like scaling changes that
affect bandwidth and clocks.

[How]
Drop this warning. DC knows better than the DM does for determining
cases like this.

The other warning can be kept for now since it would warn on a pretty
serious DC or DM bug.
