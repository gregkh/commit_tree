net: hns3: fix for tunnel type handling in hns3_rx_checksum

According to hardware user manual, the tunnel packet type is
available in the rx.ol_info field of struct hns3_desc. Currently
the tunnel packet type is decided by the rx.l234_info, which may
cause RX checksum handling error.

This patch fixes it by using the correct field in struct hns3_desc
to decide the tunnel packet type.
