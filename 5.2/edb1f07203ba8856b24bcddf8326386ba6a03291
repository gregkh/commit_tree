sparc/iommu: use __sbus_iommu_map_page to implement the map_sg path

This means we handle > PAGE_SIZE offsets fine, and grow the size check
so far only performed in the map_page path.  We lose the optimization
to not double flush a page if it apears in multiple consecutive SG list
entries.  But at least for block I/O those don't happen anymore since
we properly merge in higher layers anyway.
