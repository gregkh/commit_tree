f2fs: fix to do sanity check on free nid

As Jungyeon reported in bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203225

- Overview
When mounting the attached crafted image and unmounting it, following errors are reported.
Additionally, it hangs on sync after unmounting.

The image is intentionally fuzzed from a normal f2fs image for testing.
Compile options for F2FS are as follows.
CONFIG_F2FS_FS=y
CONFIG_F2FS_STAT_FS=y
CONFIG_F2FS_FS_XATTR=y
CONFIG_F2FS_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
CONFIG_F2FS_CHECK_FS=y

- Reproduces
mkdir test
mount -t f2fs tmp.img test
touch test/t
umount test
sync

NAT table is corrupted, so reserved meta/node inode ids were added into
free list incorrectly, during file creation, since reserved id has cached
in inode hash, so it fails the creation and preallocated nid can not be
released later, result in kernel panic.

To fix this issue, let's do nid boundary check during free nid loading.
