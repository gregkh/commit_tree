net: phy: micrel: make sure the factory test bit is cleared

The KSZ8081 PHY has a factory test mode which is set at the de-assertion
of the reset line based on the RXER (KSZ8081RNA/RND) or TXC
(KSZ8081MNX/RNB) pin. If a pull-down is missing, or if the pin has a
pull-up, the factory test mode should be cleared by manually writing a 0
(according to the datasheet). This patch makes sure this factory test
bit is cleared in config_init().
