  based on the gnu mp library actually it s the same code with only
  minor changes in the way the data is stored this is to support the
  abstraction of an optional secure memory allocation which may be
  used to avoid revealing of sensitive data due to paging etc the gnu
  mp library itself is published under the lgpl however i decided to
  publish this code under the plain gpl
