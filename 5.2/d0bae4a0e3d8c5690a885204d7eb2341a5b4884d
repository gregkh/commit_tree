net: remove duplicate fetch in sock_getsockopt

In sock_getsockopt(), 'optlen' is fetched the first time from userspace.
'len < 0' is then checked. Then in condition 'SO_MEMINFO', 'optlen' is
fetched the second time from userspace.

If change it between two fetches may cause security problems or unexpected
behaivor, and there is no reason to fetch it a second time.

To fix this, we need to remove the second fetch.
