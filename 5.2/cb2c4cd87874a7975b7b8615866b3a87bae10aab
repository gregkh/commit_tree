cgroup: prevent spurious transition into non-frozen state

If freezing of a cgroup races with waking of a task from
the frozen state (like waiting in vfork() or in do_signal_stop()),
a spurious transition of the cgroup state can happen.

The task enters cgroup_leave_frozen(true), the cgroup->nr_frozen_tasks
counter decrements, and the cgroup is switched to the unfrozen state.

To prevent it, let's reserve cgroup_leave_frozen(true) for
terminating processes and use cgroup_leave_frozen(false) otherwise.

To avoid busy-looping in the signal handling loop waiting
for JOBCTL_TRAP_FREEZE set from the cgroup freezing path,
let's do it explicitly in cgroup_leave_frozen(), if the task
is going to stay frozen.
