unicode: implement higher level API for string handling

This patch integrates the utf8n patches with some higher level API to
perform UTF-8 string comparison, normalization and casefolding
operations.  Implemented is a variation of NFD, and casefold is
performed by doing full casefold on top of NFD.  These algorithms are
based on the core implemented by Olaf Weber from SGI.
