tipc: Avoid copying bytes beyond the supplied data

TLV_SET is called with a data pointer and a len parameter that tells us
how many bytes are pointed to by data. When invoking memcpy() we need
to careful to only copy len bytes.

Previously we would copy TLV_LENGTH(len) bytes which would copy an extra
4 bytes past the end of the data pointer which newer GCC versions
complain about.

 In file included from test.c:17:
 In function 'TLV_SET',
     inlined from 'test' at test.c:186:5:
 /usr/include/linux/tipc_config.h:317:3:
 warning: 'memcpy' forming offset [33, 36] is out of the bounds [0, 32]
 of object 'bearer_name' with type 'char[32]' [-Warray-bounds]
     memcpy(TLV_DATA(tlv_ptr), data, tlv_len);
     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 test.c: In function 'test':
 test.c::161:10: note:
 'bearer_name' declared here
     char bearer_name[TIPC_MAX_BEARER_NAME];
          ^~~~~~~~~~~

We still want to ensure any padding bytes at the end are initialised, do
this with a explicit memset() rather than copy bytes past the end of
data. Apply the same logic to TCM_SET.
