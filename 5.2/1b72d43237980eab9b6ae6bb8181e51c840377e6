tick: Remove outgoing CPU from broadcast masks

Valentin reported that unplugging a CPU occasionally results in a warning
in the tick broadcast code which is triggered when an offline CPU is in the
broadcast mask.

This happens because the outgoing CPU is not removing itself from the
broadcast masks, especially not from the broadcast_force_mask. The removal
happens on the control CPU after the outgoing CPU is dead. It's a long
standing issue, but the warning is harmless.

Rework the hotplug mechanism so that the outgoing CPU removes itself from
the broadcast masks after disabling interrupts and removing itself from the
online mask.
