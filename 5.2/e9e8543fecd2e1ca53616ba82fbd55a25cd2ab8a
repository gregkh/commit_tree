sh/mmiowb: Add unconditional mmiowb() to arch_spin_unlock()

The mmiowb() macro is horribly difficult to use and drivers will continue
to work most of the time if they omit a call when it is required.

Rather than rely on driver authors getting this right, push mmiowb() into
arch_spin_unlock() for sh. If this is deemed to be a performance issue,
a subsequent optimisation could make use of ARCH_HAS_MMIOWB to elide
the barrier in cases where no I/O writes were performed inside the
critical section.
