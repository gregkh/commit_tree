drm/meson: fix primary plane disabling

The primary plane disable logic is flawed, when the primary plane is
disabled, it is re-enabled in the vsync irq when another plane is updated.

Handle the plane disabling correctly by handling the primary plane
enable flag in the primary plane update & disable callbacks.
