powerpc/xmon: add read-only mode

Operations which write to memory and special purpose registers should be
restricted on systems with integrity guarantees (such as Secure Boot)
and, optionally, to avoid self-destructive behaviors.

Add a config option, XMON_DEFAULT_RO_MODE, to set default xmon behavior.
The kernel cmdline options xmon=ro and xmon=rw override this default.

The following xmon operations are affected:
memops:
	disable memmove
	disable memset
	disable memzcan
memex:
	no-op'd mwrite
super_regs:
	no-op'd write_spr
bpt_cmds:
	disable
proc_call:
	disable
