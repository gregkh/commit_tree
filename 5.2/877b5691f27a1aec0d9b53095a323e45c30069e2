crypto: shash - remove shash_desc::flags

The flags field in 'struct shash_desc' never actually does anything.
The only ostensibly supported flag is CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP.
However, no shash algorithm ever sleeps, making this flag a no-op.

With this being the case, inevitably some users who can't sleep wrongly
pass MAY_SLEEP.  These would all need to be fixed if any shash algorithm
actually started sleeping.  For example, the shash_ahash_*() functions,
which wrap a shash algorithm with the ahash API, pass through MAY_SLEEP
from the ahash API to the shash API.  However, the shash functions are
called under kmap_atomic(), so actually they're assumed to never sleep.

Even if it turns out that some users do need preemption points while
hashing large buffers, we could easily provide a helper function
crypto_shash_update_large() which divides the data into smaller chunks
and calls crypto_shash_update() and cond_resched() for each chunk.  It's
not necessary to have a flag in 'struct shash_desc', nor is it necessary
to make individual shash algorithms aware of this at all.

Therefore, remove shash_desc::flags, and document that the
crypto_shash_*() functions can be called from any context.
