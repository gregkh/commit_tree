HID: logitech-dj: do not schedule the dj report itself

This is a preparatory patch for handling non DJ (HID++ only) receivers,
through this module. We can not use the dj_report in the delayed work
callback as the HID++ notifications are different both in size and meaning.

There should be no functional change.
