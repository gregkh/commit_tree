rhashtable: Remove RCU marking from rhash_lock_head

The opaque type rhash_lock_head should not be marked with __rcu
because it can never be dereferenced.  We should apply the RCU
marking when we turn it into a pointer which can be dereferenced.

This patch does exactly that.  This fixes a number of sparse
warnings as well as getting rid of some unnecessary RCU checking.
