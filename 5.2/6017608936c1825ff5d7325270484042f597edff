perf/x86/intel: Add Icelake support

Add Icelake core PMU perf code, including constraint tables and the main
enable code.

Icelake expanded the generic counters to always 8 even with HT on, but a
range of events cannot be scheduled on the extra 4 counters.
Add new constraint ranges to describe this to the scheduler.
The number of constraints that need to be checked is larger now than
with earlier CPUs.
At some point we may need a new data structure to look them up more
efficiently than with linear search. So far it still seems to be
acceptable however.

Icelake added a new fixed counter SLOTS. Full support for it is added
later in the patch series.

The cache events table is identical to Skylake.

Compare to PEBS instruction event on generic counter, fixed counter 0
has less skid. Force instruction:ppp always in fixed counter 0.
