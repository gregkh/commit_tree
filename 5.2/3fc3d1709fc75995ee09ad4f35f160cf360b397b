rcu: Move RCU CPU stall-warning code out of tree_plugin.h

The RCU CPU stall-warning code for normal grace periods is currently
scattered across two files, due to earlier Tiny RCU support for RCU
CPU stall warnings and for old Kconfig options that have long since
been retired.  Given that it is hard for the lead RCU maintainer to
find relevant stall-warning code, it would be good to consolidate it.
This commit continues this process by moving stall-warning code from
kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.c to a new kernel/rcu/tree_stall.h file.
