clk: imx: correct pfdv2 gate_bit/vld_bit operations

The operations of pfdv2 gate_bit/valid_bit are incorrect,
they are defined as u8 for bit offset, but gate_bit is
actually assigned as mask which could be 32 bit long and
it causes overflow, and vld_bit is assigned as bit offset
based on incorrect gate_bit value, it causes incorrect
pfd clock gate status in clock tree, this patch fixes the
issue by assigning them as correct bit offset.
