perf vendor events intel: Add uncore_upi JSON support

Perf cannot parse UPI (Intel's "Ultra Path Interconnect" [1]) events.

    # perf stat -e UPI_DATA_BANDWIDTH_TX
    event syntax error: 'UPI_DATA_BANDWIDTH_TX'
                     \___ parser error
    Run 'perf list' for a list of valid events

The JSON lists call the box UPI LL, while perf calls it upi.  Add
conversion support to JSON to convert the unit properly.

Committer notes:

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Ultra_Path_Interconnect

"The Intel Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI) is a point-to-point processor
interconnect developed by Intel which replaced the Intel QuickPath
Interconnect (QPI) in Xeon Skylake-SP platforms starting in 2017.

UPI is a low-latency coherent interconnect for scalable multiprocessor
systems with a shared address space. It uses a directory-based home
snoop coherency protocol with a transfer speed of up to 10.4 GT/s.
Supporting processors typically have two or three UPI links."
