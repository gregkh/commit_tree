staging: fieldbus: anybus-s: support HMS Anybus-S bus

The Anybus-S/Anybus-M is a series of interchangeable fieldbus communication
modules featuring on board memory and processing power. All software and
hardware functionality required to communicate on the fieldbus is
incorporated in the module itself, allowing the application to focus on
other tasks.

Typical applications are frequency inverters, HMI and visualization
devices, instruments, scales, robotics, PLCâ€™s and intelligent measuring
devices.
