fanotify: update connector fsid cache on add mark

When implementing connector fsid cache, we only initialized the cache
when the first mark added to object was added by FAN_REPORT_FID group.
We forgot to update conn->fsid when the second mark is added by
FAN_REPORT_FID group to an already attached connector without fsid
cache.
