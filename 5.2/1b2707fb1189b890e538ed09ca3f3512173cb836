csky: remove redundant generic-y

Since commit 7cbbbb8bc297 ("kbuild: warn redundant generic-y"),
redundant generic-y is reported. I missed to delete this one.

scripts/Makefile.asm-generic:25: redundant generic-y found in arch/csky/include/asm/Kbuild: ftrace.h

In this case, csky-specific implementation exists in
arch/csky/include/asm/ftrace.h
