scsi: lpfc: Resolve inconsistent check of hdwq in lpfc_scsi_cmd_iocb_cmpl

A prior patch which added support for non-uniform allocation of MSIX
vectors now causes a smatch complaint:

 drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_scsi.c:3674 lpfc_scsi_cmd_iocb_cmpl()
   error: we previously assumed 'phba->sli4_hba.hdwq' could be
          null (see line 3667)

Resolve by removing the unnecessary check for a NULL hdwq table.

Fixes 6a828b0f6192: ("scsi: lpfc: Support non-uniform allocation of MSIX vectors to hardware queues")
