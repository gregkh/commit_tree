block: change how we get page references in bio_iov_iter_get_pages

Instead of needing a special macro to iterate over all pages in
a bvec just do a second passs over the whole bio.  This also matches
what we do on the release side.  The release side helper is moved
up to where we need the get helper to clearly express the symmetry.
