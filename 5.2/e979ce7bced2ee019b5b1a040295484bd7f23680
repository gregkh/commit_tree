s390/pci: provide support for CPU directed interrupts

Up until now all interrupts on s390 have been floating. For MSI interrupts
we've used a global summary bit vector (with a bit for each function) and
a per-function interrupt bit vector (with a bit per MSI).

This patch introduces a new IRQ delivery mode: CPU directed interrupts.
In this new mode a per-CPU interrupt bit vector is used (with a bit per
MSI per function). Further it is now possible to direct an IRQ to a
specific CPU so we can finally support IRQ affinity.

If an interrupt can't be delivered because the appointed CPU is occupied
by a hypervisor the interrupt is delivered floating. For this a global
summary bit vector is used (with a bit per CPU).
