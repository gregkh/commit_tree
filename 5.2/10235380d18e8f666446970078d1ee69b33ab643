HID: rmi: Use SET_REPORT request on control endpoint for Acer Switch 3 and 5

The touchpad on the cover keyboard for the Acer Switch 3 and 5 does not
work as-is under Linux. Both devices have the same usb id for the cover
keyboard.

The kernel correctly assigns the hid-rmi driver to the device using usbhid
for transport.
Any attempts of hid-rmi to talk to the device using hid_hw_output_report
fail however as usbhid does not have a working urbout due to the lack of
any out endpoints.

Looking through Wireshark usbmon recordings from the Windows Synaptics
driver for this computer running inside of QEMU shows that it should be
using SET_REPORT requests instead.

This replaces the hid_hw_output_report in hid-rmi with a
hid_hw_raw_request for this device, which is at least enough to enable
the kernel to get working multi-touch input.
