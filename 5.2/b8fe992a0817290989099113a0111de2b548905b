drm/i915: Forcing a modeset when resetting HDMI link

With fastboot enabled in gen9+ it broke the HDMI reset as just
setting mode_changed to true causes a fastset and here we want a full
modeset that will disable and then enable the encoder of this HDMI
link actually, so setting connectors_changed instead that will cause
modeset as desired.
