KVM: arm64: Add userspace flag to enable pointer authentication

Now that the building blocks of pointer authentication are present, lets
add userspace flags KVM_ARM_VCPU_PTRAUTH_ADDRESS and
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PTRAUTH_GENERIC. These flags will enable pointer
authentication for the KVM guest on a per-vcpu basis through the ioctl
KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT.

This features will allow the KVM guest to allow the handling of
pointer authentication instructions or to treat them as undefined
if not set.

Necessary documentations are added to reflect the changes done.
