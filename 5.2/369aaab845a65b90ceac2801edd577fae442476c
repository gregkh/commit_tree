arm64: mm: don't call page table ctors for init_mm

init_mm doesn't require page table lock to be initialized at
any level. Add a separate page table allocator for it, and the
new one skips page table ctors.

The ctors allocate memory when ALLOC_SPLIT_PTLOCKS is set. Not
calling them avoids memory leak in case we call pte_free_kernel()
on init_mm.
