gfs2: Fix error path kobject memory leak

If a call to kobject_init_and_add() fails we must call kobject_put()
otherwise we leak memory.

Function gfs2_sys_fs_add always calls kobject_init_and_add() which
always calls kobject_init().

It is safe to leave object destruction up to the kobject release
function and never free it manually.

Remove call to kfree() and always call kobject_put() in the error path.
