locking/lock_events: Use this_cpu_add() when necessary

The kernel test robot has reported that the use of __this_cpu_add()
causes bug messages like:

  BUG: using __this_cpu_add() in preemptible [00000000] code: ...

Given the imprecise nature of the count and the possibility of resetting
the count and doing the measurement again, this is not really a big
problem to use the unprotected __this_cpu_*() functions.

To make the preemption checking code happy, the this_cpu_*() functions
will be used if CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is defined.

The imprecise nature of the locking counts are also documented with
the suggestion that we should run the measurement a few times with the
counts reset in between to get a better picture of what is going on
under the hood.
