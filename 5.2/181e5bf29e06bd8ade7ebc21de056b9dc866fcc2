drm/vc4: Make sure to emit a tile coordinates between two MSAA loads.

The HW only executes a load once the tile coordinates packet happens,
and only tracks one at a time, so by emitting our two MSAA loads back
to back we would end up with an undefined color or Z buffer.

Fixes dEQP-EGL.functional.render.multi_context.gles2.rgb888_window
