dsa: Rename dsa_resolve_tag_protocol() to _get ready for locking

dsa_resolve_tag_protocol() is used to find the tagging driver needed
by a switch driver. When the tagging drivers become modules, it will
be necassary to take a reference on the module to prevent it being
unloaded. So rename this function to _get() to indicate it has some
locking properties.
