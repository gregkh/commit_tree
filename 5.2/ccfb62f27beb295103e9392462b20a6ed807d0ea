mISDN: make sure device name is NUL terminated

The user can change the device_name with the IMSETDEVNAME ioctl, but we
need to ensure that the user's name is NUL terminated.  Otherwise it
could result in a buffer overflow when we copy the name back to the user
with IMGETDEVINFO ioctl.

I also changed two strcpy() calls which handle the name to strscpy().
Hopefully, there aren't any other ways to create a too long name, but
it's nice to do this as a kernel hardening measure.
