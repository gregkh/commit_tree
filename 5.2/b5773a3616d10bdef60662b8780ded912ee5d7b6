drm/i915/execlists: Suppress mere WAIT preemption

WAIT is occasionally suppressed by virtue of preempted requests being
promoted to NEWCLIENT if they have not all ready received that boost.
Make this consistent for all WAIT boosts that they are not allowed to
preempt executing contexts and are merely granted the right to be at the
front of the queue for the next execution slot. This is in keeping with
the desire that the WAIT boost be a minor tweak that does not give
excessive promotion to its user and open ourselves to trivial abuse.

The problem with the inconsistent WAIT preemption becomes more apparent
as the preemption is propagated across the engines, where one engine may
preempt and the other not, and we be relying on the exact execution
order being consistent across engines (e.g. using HW semaphores to
coordinate parallel execution).

v2: Also protect GuC submission from false preemption loops.
v3: Build bug safeguards and better debug messages for st.
v4: Do the priority bumping in unsubmit (i.e. on preemption/reset
unwind), applying it earlier during submit causes out-of-order execution
combined with execute fences.
v5: Call sw_fence_fini for our dummy request (Matthew)
