vfio/mdev: Fix aborting mdev child device removal if one fails

device_for_each_child() stops executing callback function for remaining
child devices, if callback hits an error.
Each child mdev device is independent of each other.
While unregistering parent device, mdev core must remove all child mdev
devices.
Therefore, mdev_device_remove_cb() always returns success so that
device_for_each_child doesn't abort if one child removal hits error.

While at it, improve remove and unregister functions for below simplicity.

There isn't need to pass forced flag pointer during mdev parent
removal which invokes mdev_device_remove(). So simplify the flow.

mdev_device_remove() is called from two paths.
1. mdev_unregister_driver()
     mdev_device_remove_cb()
       mdev_device_remove()
2. remove_store()
     mdev_device_remove()
