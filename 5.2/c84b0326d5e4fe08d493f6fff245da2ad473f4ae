reset: add acquired/released state for exclusive reset controls

There are cases where a driver needs explicit control over a reset line
that is exclusively conneted to its device, but this control has to be
temporarily handed over to the power domain controller to handle reset
requirements during power transitions.
Allow multiple exclusive reset controls to be requested in 'released'
state for the same physical reset line, only one of which can be
acquired at the same time.
