arm64: KVM: Avoid isb's by using direct pmxevtyper sysreg

Upon entering or exiting a guest we may modify multiple PMU counters to
enable of disable EL0 filtering. We presently do this via the indirect
PMXEVTYPER_EL0 system register (where the counter we modify is selected
by PMSELR). With this approach it is necessary to order the writes via
isb instructions such that we select the correct counter before modifying
it.

Let's avoid potentially expensive instruction barriers by using the
direct PMEVTYPER<n>_EL0 registers instead.

As the change to counter type relates only to EL0 filtering we can rely
on the implicit instruction barrier which occurs when we transition from
EL2 to EL1 on entering the guest. On returning to userspace we can, at the
latest, rely on the implicit barrier between EL2 and EL0. We can also
depend on the explicit isb in armv8pmu_select_counter to order our write
against any other kernel changes by the PMU driver to the type register as
a result of preemption.
