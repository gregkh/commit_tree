ipv6: Rename fib6_nh entries

Rename fib6_nh entries that will be moved to a fib_nh_common struct.
Specifically, the device, gateway, flags, and lwtstate are common
with all nexthop definitions. In some places new temporary variables
are declared or local variables renamed to maintain line lengths.

Rename only; no functional change intended.
