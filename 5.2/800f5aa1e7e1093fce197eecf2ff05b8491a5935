block: Replace all ktype default_attrs with groups

The kobj_type default_attrs field is being replaced by the
default_groups field. Replace all of the ktype default_attrs fields in
the block subsystem with default_groups and use the ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS
macro to create the default groups.

Remove default_ctx_attrs[] because it doesn't contain any attributes.

This patch was tested by verifying that the sysfs files for the
attributes in the default groups were created.
