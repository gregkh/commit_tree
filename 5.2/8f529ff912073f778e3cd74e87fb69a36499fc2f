ice: Separate if conditions for ice_set_features()

Set features can have multiple features turned on|off in a single
call.  Grouping these all in an if/else means after one condition
is met, other conditions/features will not be evaluated.  Break
the if/else statements by feature to ensure all features will be
handled properly.
