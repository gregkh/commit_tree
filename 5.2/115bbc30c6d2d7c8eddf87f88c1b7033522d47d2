ARM: shmobile: fix a leaked reference by adding missing of_node_put

The call to of_get_next_child returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented thus it must be explicitly decremented after the last
usage.

Detected by coccinelle with the following warnings:
./arch/arm/mach-shmobile/pm-rcar-gen2.c:77:2-8: ERROR: missing of_node_put; acquired a node pointer with refcount incremented on line 66, but without a corresponding object release within this function.
