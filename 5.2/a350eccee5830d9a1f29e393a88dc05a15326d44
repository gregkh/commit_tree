net: remove 'fallback' argument from dev->ndo_select_queue()

After the previous patch, all the callers of ndo_select_queue()
provide as a 'fallback' argument netdev_pick_tx.
The only exceptions are nested calls to ndo_select_queue(),
which pass down the 'fallback' available in the current scope
- still netdev_pick_tx.

We can drop such argument and replace fallback() invocation with
netdev_pick_tx(). This avoids an indirect call per xmit packet
in some scenarios (TCP syn, UDP unconnected, XDP generic, pktgen)
with device drivers implementing such ndo. It also clean the code
a bit.

Tested with ixgbe and CONFIG_FCOE=m

With pktgen using queue xmit:

 v1 -> v2:
 - rebased after helper's name change
