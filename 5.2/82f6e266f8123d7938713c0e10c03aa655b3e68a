powerpc/32: fix build failure on book3e with KVM

Build failure was introduced by the commit identified below,
due to missed macro expension leading to wrong called function's name.

arch/powerpc/kernel/head_fsl_booke.o: In function `SystemCall':
arch/powerpc/kernel/head_fsl_booke.S:416: undefined reference to `kvmppc_handler_BOOKE_INTERRUPT_SYSCALL_SPRN_SRR1'
Makefile:1052: recipe for target 'vmlinux' failed

The called function should be kvmppc_handler_8_0x01B(). This patch fixes it.
