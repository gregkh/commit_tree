scsi: lpfc: Fix deadlock due to nested hbalock call

If an adapter fails, causing a board reset, the board reset routine
lpfc_hba_down_s4() takes the hbalock out then calls
lpfc_nvmet_ctxbuf_post() who then tries to take out the same lock.  As the
context lists are now protected under the buf_list_locks, there is no need
for the hbalock to be held by the board reset routine.

Fix by no longer taking the hbalock in the board reset routine.
