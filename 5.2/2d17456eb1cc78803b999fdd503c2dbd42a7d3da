bcache: add comments for kobj release callback routine

Bcache has several routines to release resources in implicit way, they
are called when the associated kobj released. This patch adds code
comments to notice when and which release callback will be called,
- When dc->disk.kobj released:
  void bch_cached_dev_release(struct kobject *kobj)
- When d->kobj released:
  void bch_flash_dev_release(struct kobject *kobj)
- When c->kobj released:
  void bch_cache_set_release(struct kobject *kobj)
- When ca->kobj released
  void bch_cache_release(struct kobject *kobj)
