teach move_mount(2) to work with OPEN_TREE_CLONE

Allow a detached tree created by open_tree(..., OPEN_TREE_CLONE) to be
attached by move_mount(2).

If by the time of final fput() of OPEN_TREE_CLONE-opened file its tree is
not detached anymore, it won't be dissolved.  move_mount(2) is adjusted
to handle detached source.

That gives us equivalents of mount --bind and mount --rbind.

Thanks also to Alan Jenkins <alan.christopher.jenkins@gmail.com> for
providing a whole bunch of ways to break things using this interface.
