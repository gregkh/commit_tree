drm/i915: Introduce intel_context.pin_mutex for pin management

Introduce a mutex to start locking the HW contexts independently of
struct_mutex, with a view to reducing the coarse struct_mutex. The
intel_context.pin_mutex is used to guard the transition to and from being
pinned on the gpu, and so is required before starting to build any
request. The intel_context will then remain pinned until the request
completes, but the mutex can be released immediately unpin completion of
pinning the context.

A slight variant of the above is used by per-context sseu that wants to
inspect the pinned status of the context, and requires that it remains
stable (either !pinned or pinned) across its operation. By using the
pin_mutex to serialise operations while pin_count==0, we can take that
pin_mutex for stabilise the boolean pin status.

v2: for Tvrtko!
* Improved commit message.
* Dropped _gpu suffix from gen8_modify_rpcs_gpu.
v3: Repair the locking for sseu selftests
