uaccess: add noop untagged_addr definition

Architectures that support memory tagging have a need to perform untagging
(stripping the tag) in various parts of the kernel. This patch adds an
untagged_addr() macro, which is defined as noop for architectures that do
not support memory tagging. The oncoming patch series will define it at
least for sparc64 and arm64.
