mmiowb: Hook up mmiowb helpers to spinlocks and generic I/O accessors

Removing explicit calls to mmiowb() from driver code means that we must
now call into the generic mmiowb_spin_{lock,unlock}() functions from the
core spinlock code. In order to elide barriers following critical
sections without any I/O writes, we also hook into the asm-generic I/O
routines.
