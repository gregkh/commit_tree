m68k: Call timer_interrupt() with interrupts disabled

Some platforms execute their timer handler with the interrupt priority
level set below 6. That means the handler could be interrupted by another
driver and this could lead to re-entry of the timer core.

Avoid this by use of local_irq_save/restore for timer interrupt dispatch.
This provides mutual exclusion around the timer interrupt flag access
which is needed later in this series for the clocksource conversion.
