rndis_wlan: use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, replace code of the following form:

sizeof(*pmkids) + max_pmkids * sizeof(pmkids->bssid_info[0])

with:

struct_size(pmkids, bssid_info, num_pmkids)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
