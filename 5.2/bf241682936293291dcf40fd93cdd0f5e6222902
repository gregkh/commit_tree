csky: Reconstruct signal processing

Linux kernel has provided some apis for arch signal's implementation.
For example:
	restore_saved_sigmask()
	set_current_blocked()
	restore_altstack()

But in last version of csky signal.c didn't use them and some codes are
confusing, so reconstruct signal.c with reference to riscv's code.

Now csky signal.c implementation are very close to riscv and we can
get the following benefits:
 - Clear code structure
 - The signal code of riscv and csky can be reviewed together
 - Promoting the unification of arch's signal implementation

Also modified the related code in entry.S
