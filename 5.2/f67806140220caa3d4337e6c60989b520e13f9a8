iwlwifi: mvm: disconnect in case of bad channel switch parameters

In case we receive channel switch announcement with immediate
quiet and unknown switching time, we will switch when FW identifies
AP left channel. However, if AP remains on channel, we will
eventually get TX queue hang. Init a work to disconnect if
switch doesn't occur within 1500 milliseconds. Do it also
for a too long channel switch.
