RAS/CEC: Fix binary search function

Switch to using Donald Knuth's binary search algorithm (The Art of
Computer Programming, vol. 3, section 6.2.1). This should've been done
from the very beginning but the author must've been smoking something
very potent at the time.

The problem with the current one was that it would return the wrong
element index in certain situations:

and the noodling code after the loop was fishy at best.

So switch to using Knuth's binary search. The final result is much
cleaner and straightforward.
