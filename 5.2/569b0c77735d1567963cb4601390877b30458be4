tools/bpftool: show btf id in program information

Let's add a way to know whether a program has btf context.
Patch adds 'btf_id' in the output of program listing.
When btf_id is present, it means program has btf context.

Sample output:
user@test# bpftool prog list
25: xdp  name xdp_prog1  tag 539ec6ce11b52f98  gpl
	loaded_at 2019-04-10T11:44:20+0900  uid 0
	xlated 488B  not jited  memlock 4096B  map_ids 23
	btf_id 1
