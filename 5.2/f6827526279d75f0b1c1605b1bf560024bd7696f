selftests: bpf: modify urandom_read and link it non-statically

After some experiences I found that urandom_read does not need to be
linked statically. When the 'read' syscall call is moved to separate
non-inlined function then bpf_get_stackid() is able to find
the executable in stack trace and extract its build_id from it.
