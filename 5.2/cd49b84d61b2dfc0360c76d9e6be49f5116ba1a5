mfd: stmfx: Uninitialized variable in stmfx_irq_handler()

The problem is that on 64bit systems then we don't clear the higher
bits of the "pending" variable.  So when we do:

        ack = pending & ~BIT(STMFX_REG_IRQ_SRC_EN_GPIO);
        if (ack) {

the if (ack) condition relies on uninitialized data.  The fix it that
I've changed "pending" from an unsigned long to a u32.  I changed "n" as
well, because that's a number in the 0-10 range and it fits easily
inside an int.  We do need to add a cast to "pending" when we use it in
the for_each_set_bit() loop, but that doesn't cause a problem, it's
fine.
