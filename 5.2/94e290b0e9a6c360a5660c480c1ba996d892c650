i2c: rcar: wait for data empty before starting DMA

When sending with DMA, the driver transfers the first byte with PIO (as
documented). However, it started DMA right after the first byte was
written. This worked, but was not according to the datasheet which
suggests to wait until data register was empty again. Implement this.
