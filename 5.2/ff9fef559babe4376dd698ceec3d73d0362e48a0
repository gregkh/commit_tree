btrfs: start transaction in btrfs_ioctl_setflags()

Inode attribute can be set through the FS_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl.  This
flags also includes compression attribute for which we would set/reset
the compression extended attribute. While doing this there is a bit of
duplicate code, the following things happens twice:

- start/end_transaction
- inode_inc_iversion()
- current_time update to inode->i_ctime
- and btrfs_update_inode()

These are updated both at btrfs_ioctl_setflags() and btrfs_set_props()
as well.  This patch merges these two duplicate codes at
btrfs_ioctl_setflags().
