phy: rockchip-emmc: Allow to set drive impedance via DTS.

The rockchip-emmc PHY can be configured with different
drive impedance values. Currenlty a value of 50 Ohm is
hard coded into the driver.

This patch introduces the DTS property 'drive-impedance-ohm'
for the rockchip-emmc phy node, which uses the value from the DTS
to setup the drive impedance accordingly.
