perf/ring_buffer: Fix exposing a temporarily decreased data_head

In perf_output_put_handle(), an IRQ/NMI can happen in below location and
write records to the same ring buffer:

	...
	local_dec_and_test(&rb->nest)
	...                          <-- an IRQ/NMI can happen here
	rb->user_page->data_head = head;
	...

In this case, a value A is written to data_head in the IRQ, then a value
B is written to data_head after the IRQ. And A > B. As a result,
data_head is temporarily decreased from A to B. And a reader may see
data_head < data_tail if it read the buffer frequently enough, which
creates unexpected behaviors.

This can be fixed by moving dec(&rb->nest) to after updating data_head,
which prevents the IRQ/NMI above from updating data_head.
