crypto: run initcalls for generic implementations earlier

Use subsys_initcall for registration of all templates and generic
algorithm implementations, rather than module_init.  Then change
cryptomgr to use arch_initcall, to place it before the subsys_initcalls.

This is needed so that when both a generic and optimized implementation
of an algorithm are built into the kernel (not loadable modules), the
generic implementation is registered before the optimized one.
Otherwise, the self-tests for the optimized implementation are unable to
allocate the generic implementation for the new comparison fuzz tests.

Note that on arm, a side effect of this change is that self-tests for
generic implementations may run before the unaligned access handler has
been installed.  So, unaligned accesses will crash the kernel.  This is
arguably a good thing as it makes it easier to detect that type of bug.
