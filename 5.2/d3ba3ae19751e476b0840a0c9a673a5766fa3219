mm/memory_hotplug.c: fix the wrong usage of N_HIGH_MEMORY

In node_states_check_changes_online(), N_HIGH_MEMORY is used to substitute
ZONE_HIGHMEM directly.  This is not right.  N_HIGH_MEMORY is to mark the
memory state of node.  Here zone index is checked, which should be
compared with 'ZONE_HIGHMEM' accordingly.

Replace it with ZONE_HIGHMEM.

This is a code cleanup - no known runtime effects.
