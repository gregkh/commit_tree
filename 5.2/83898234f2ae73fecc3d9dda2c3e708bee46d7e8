HID: logitech-dj: reshuffle logi_dj_recv_forward_*

logi_dj_recv_forward_report() was only intended for DJ reports.
logi_dj_recv_forward_hidpp() is more generic at forwarding random HID
reports.

So rename logi_dj_recv_forward_report() into logi_dj_recv_forward_dj()
and logi_dj_recv_forward_hidpp() into logi_dj_recv_forward_report().
