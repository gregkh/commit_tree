crypto: crypto4xx - fix ctr-aes missing output IV

Commit 8efd972ef96a ("crypto: testmgr - support checking skcipher output IV")
caused the crypto4xx driver to produce the following error:

| ctr-aes-ppc4xx encryption test failed (wrong output IV)
| on test vector 0, cfg="in-place"

This patch fixes this by reworking the crypto4xx_setkey_aes()
function to:

 - not save the iv for ECB (as per 18.2.38 CRYP0_SA_CMD_0:
   "This bit mut be cleared for DES ECB mode or AES ECB mode,
   when no IV is used.")

 - instruct the hardware to save the generated IV for all
   other modes of operations that have IV and then supply
   it back to the callee in pretty much the same way as we
   do it for cbc-aes already.

 - make it clear that the DIR_(IN|OUT)BOUND is the important
   bit that tells the hardware to encrypt or decrypt the data.
   (this is cosmetic - but it hopefully prevents me from
    getting confused again).

 - don't load any bogus hash when we don't use any hash
   operation to begin with.
