media: vsp1: Add vsp1_dl_list argument to .configure_stream() operation

The WPF needs access to the current display list to configure writeback.
Add a display list pointer to the VSP1 entity .configure_stream()
operation.

Only display pipelines can make use of the display list there as
mem-to-mem pipelines don't have access to a display list at stream
configuration time. This is not an issue as writeback is only used for
display pipelines.
