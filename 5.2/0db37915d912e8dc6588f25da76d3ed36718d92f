leds: avoid races with workqueue

There are races between "main" thread and workqueue. They manifest
themselves on Thinkpad X60:

This should result in LED blinking, but it turns it off instead:

    root@amd:/data/pavel# cd /sys/class/leds/tpacpi\:\:power
    root@amd:/sys/class/leds/tpacpi::power# echo timer > trigger
    root@amd:/sys/class/leds/tpacpi::power# echo timer > trigger

It should be possible to transition from blinking to solid on by echo
0 > brightness; echo 1 > brightness... but that does not work, either,
if done too quickly.

Synchronization of the workqueue fixes both.
