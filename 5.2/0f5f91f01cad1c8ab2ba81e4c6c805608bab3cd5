arm64: dts: msm8996: thermal: Add temperature sensors near major peripherals

msm8996 has a total of 21 temperature sensors. Populate DT with
information about them.

There are 2 sensors on each of the cpus - one on the top, the other
below (we only expose one on the top in DT for now). For the GPU, we
expose both, the one on the top and the one below.

Depending on the version of the silicon, sensor 2 is either placed near
the L3 cache or the venus video decoder. It would've been nice to be
able to be version-specific but we don't have DTs that differentiate the
two versions of silicon yet.
