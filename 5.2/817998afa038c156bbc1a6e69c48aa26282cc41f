bpf: bpftool support for dumping data/bss/rodata sections

Add the ability to bpftool to handle BTF Var and DataSec kinds
in order to dump them out of btf_dumper_type(). The value has a
single object with the section name, which itself holds an array
of variables it dumps. A single variable is an object by itself
printed along with its name. From there further type information
is dumped along with corresponding value information.

Example output from .rodata:

  # ./bpftool m d i 150
  [{
          "value": {
              ".rodata": [{
                      "load_static_data.bar": 18446744073709551615
                  },{
                      "num2": 24
                  },{
                      "num5": 43947
                  },{
                      "num6": 171
                  },{
                      "str0": [97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,0,0,0,0,0,0
                      ]
                  },{
                      "struct0": {
                          "a": 42,
                          "b": 4278120431,
                          "c": 1229782938247303441
                      }
                  },{
                      "struct2": {
                          "a": 0,
                          "b": 0,
                          "c": 0
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
      }
  ]
