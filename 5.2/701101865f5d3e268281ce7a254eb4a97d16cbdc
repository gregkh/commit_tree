powerpc/mm: Reduce memory usage for mm_context_t for radix

Currently, our mm_context_t on book3s64 include all hash specific
context details like slice mask and subpage protection details. We
can skip allocating these with radix translation. This will help us to save
8K per mm_context with radix translation.

With the patch applied we have

sizeof(mm_context_t)  = 136
sizeof(struct hash_mm_context)  = 8288
