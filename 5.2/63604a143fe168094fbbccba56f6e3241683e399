media: seco-cec: fix building with RC_CORE=m

I previously added an RC_CORE dependency here, but missed the corner
case of CONFIG_VIDEO_SECO_CEC=y with CONFIG_RC_CORE=m, which still
causes a link error:

drivers/media/platform/seco-cec/seco-cec.o: In function `secocec_probe':
seco-cec.c:(.text+0x1b8): undefined reference to `devm_rc_allocate_device'
seco-cec.c:(.text+0x2e8): undefined reference to `devm_rc_register_device'
drivers/media/platform/seco-cec/seco-cec.o: In function `secocec_irq_handler':
seco-cec.c:(.text+0xa2c): undefined reference to `rc_keydown'

Refine the dependency to disallow building the RC subdriver in this case.
This is the same logic we apply in other drivers like it.
