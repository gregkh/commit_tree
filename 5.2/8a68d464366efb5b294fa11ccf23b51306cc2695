drm/i915: Store the BIT(engine->id) as the engine's mask

In the next patch, we are introducing a broad virtual engine to encompass
multiple physical engines, losing the 1:1 nature of BIT(engine->id). To
reflect the broader set of engines implied by the virtual instance, lets
store the full bitmask.

v2: Use intel_engine_mask_t (s/ring_mask/engine_mask/)
v3: Tvrtko voted for moah churn so teach everyone to not mention ring
and use $class$instance throughout.
v4: Comment upon the disparity in bspec for using VCS1,VCS2 in gen8 and
VCS[0-4] in later gen. We opt to keep the code consistent and use
0-index naming throughout.
