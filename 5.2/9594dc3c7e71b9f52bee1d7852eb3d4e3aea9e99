bpf: fix nested bpf tracepoints with per-cpu data

BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINTs can be executed nested on the same CPU, as
they do not increment bpf_prog_active while executing.

This enables three levels of nesting, to support
  - a kprobe or raw tp or perf event,
  - another one of the above that irq context happens to call, and
  - another one in nmi context
(at most one of which may be a kprobe or perf event).
