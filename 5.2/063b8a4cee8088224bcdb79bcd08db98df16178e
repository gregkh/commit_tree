drivers/base/memory.c: clean up relics in function parameters

The input parameter 'phys_index' of memory_block_action() is actually the
section number, but not the phys_index of memory_block.  This is a relic
from the past when one memory block could only contain one section.
Rename it to start_section_nr.

And also in remove_memory_section(), the 'node_id' and 'phys_device'
arguments are not used by anyone.  Remove them.
