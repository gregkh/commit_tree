acpi/hmat: Update acpi_hmat_type enum with ACPI_HMAT_TYPE_PROXIMITY

ACPI 6.3 changed the subtable "Memory Subsystem Address Range Structure"
to "Memory Proximity Domain Attributes Structure".

Updating and renaming of the structure was included in commit:
ACPICA: ACPI 6.3: HMAT updates (9a8d961f1ef835b0d338fbe13da03cb424e87ae5)

Rename the enum type to match the subtable and structure naming.
