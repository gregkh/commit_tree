dm ioctl: fix hang in early create error condition

The dm_early_create() function (which deals with "dm-mod.create=" kernel
command line option) calls dm_hash_insert() who gets an extra reference
to the md object.

In case of failure, this reference wasn't being released, causing
dm_destroy() to hang, thus hanging the whole boot process.

Fix this by calling __hash_remove() in the error path.
