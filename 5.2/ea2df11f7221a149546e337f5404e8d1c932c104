PCI: iproc: Allow outbound configuration for 32-bit I/O region

The IProc host controller has I/O memory windows allocated in
the AXI memory map that can be used to address PCI I/O memory
space.

Mapping from AXI memory windows to PCI outbound memory windows is
carried out in the host controller through OARR/OMAP registers pairs
that permit to define power of two region size AXI<->PCI mappings, the
smallest of which is 128MB.

Current code enables AXI memory window to PCI outbound memory window
mapping only for AXI windows matching one of the OARR/OMAP window sizes,
that are SoC dependent and the smallest of which is 128MB.

Some SoCs implementing the IProc host controller have a 32-bit AXI
memory window into PCI I/O memory space, eg:

    Base address | Size
-----------------------------
(1) 0x42000000   | 0x2000000
(2) 0x400000000  | 0x80000000

but its size (32MB - (1) above) is smaller than the smallest AXI<->PCI
region size provided by OARR (128MB), so the current driver rejects
mappings for the 32-bit region making the IProc host controller driver
unusable on 32-bit systems.

However, there is no reason why the 32-bit I/O memory window cannot be
enabled by mapping it through an OARR/OMAP region bigger in size (ie
32-bit AXI window size is 32MB but can be mapped using a 128MB OARR/OMAP
region).

Allow outbound window configuration of I/O memory windows that
are smaller in size than the host controller OARR/OMAP region, so
that the 32-bit AXI memory window can actually be enabled,
making the IProc host controller operational on 32-bit systems.
