ACPI: bus: change _ADR representation to 64 bits

Standards such as the MIPI DisCo for SoundWire 1.0 specification
assume the _ADR field is 64 bits.

_ADR is defined as an "Integer" represented as 64 bits since ACPI 2.0
released in 2002. The low levels already use _ADR as 64 bits, e.g. in
struct acpi_device_info.

This patch bumps the representation used for sysfs to 64 bits. To
avoid any compatibility/ABI issues, the printf format is only extended
to 16 characters when the actual _ADR value exceeds the 32 bit
maximum.

Example with a SoundWire device, the results show the complete
vendorID and linkID which were omitted before:

Before:
$ more /sys/bus/acpi/devices/device\:38/adr
0x5d070000
After:
$ more /sys/bus/acpi/devices/device\:38/adr
0x000010025d070000
