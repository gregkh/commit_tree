crypto: testmgr - add panic_on_fail module parameter

Add a module parameter cryptomgr.panic_on_fail which causes the kernel
to panic if any crypto self-tests fail.

Use cases:

- More easily detect crypto self-test failures by boot testing,
  e.g. on KernelCI.
- Get a bug report if syzkaller manages to use the template system to
  instantiate an algorithm that fails its self-tests.

The command-line option "fips=1" already does this, but it also makes
other changes not wanted for general testing, such as disabling
"unapproved" algorithms.  panic_on_fail just does what it says.
