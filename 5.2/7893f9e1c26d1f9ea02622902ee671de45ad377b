usb: typec: tcpm: Notify the tcpc to start connection-detection for SRPs

Some tcpc device-drivers need to explicitly be told to watch for connection
events, otherwise the tcpc will not generate any TCPM_CC_EVENTs and devices
being plugged into the Type-C port will not be noticed.

For dual-role ports tcpm_start_drp_toggling() is used to tell the tcpc to
watch for connection events. Sofar we lack a similar callback to the tcpc
for single-role ports. With some tcpc-s such as the fusb302 this means
no TCPM_CC_EVENTs will be generated when the port is configured as a
single-role port.

This commit renames start_drp_toggling to start_toggling and since the
device-properties are parsed by the tcpm-core, adds a port_type parameter
to the start_toggling callback so that the tcpc_dev driver knows the
port-type and can act accordingly when it starts toggling.

The new start_toggling callback now always gets called if defined, instead
of only being called for DRP ports.

To avoid this causing undesirable functional changes all existing
start_drp_toggling implementations are not only renamed to start_toggling,
but also get a port_type check added and return -EOPNOTSUPP when port_type
is not DRP.
