btrfs: start readahead also in seed devices

Currently, btrfs does not consult seed devices to start readahead. As a
result, if readahead zone is added to the seed devices, btrfs_reada_wait()
indefinitely wait for the reada_ctl to finish.

You can reproduce the hung by modifying btrfs/163 to have larger initial
file size (e.g. xfs_io pwrite 4M instead of current 256K).
