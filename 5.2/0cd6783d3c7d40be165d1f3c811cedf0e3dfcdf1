s390/qeth: check dst entry before use

While qeth_l3 uses netif_keep_dst() to hold onto the dst, a skb's dst
may still have been obsoleted (via dst_dev_put()) by the time that we
end up using it. The dst then points to the loopback interface, which
means the neighbour lookup in qeth_l3_get_cast_type() determines a bogus
cast type of RTN_BROADCAST.
For IQD interfaces this causes us to place such skbs on the wrong
HW queue, resulting in TX errors.

Fix-up the various call sites to first validate the dst entry with
dst_check(), and fall back accordingly.
