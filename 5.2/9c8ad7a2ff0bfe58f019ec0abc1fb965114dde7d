uapi, x86: Fix the syscall numbering of the mount API syscalls [ver #2]

Fix the syscall numbering of the mount API syscalls so that the numbers
match between i386 and x86_64 and that they're in the common numbering
scheme space.

Fixes: 24dcb3d90a1f ("vfs: syscall: Add fsopen() to prepare for superblock creation")
Fixes: ecdab150fddb ("vfs: syscall: Add fsconfig() for configuring and managing a context")
Fixes: 93766fbd2696 ("vfs: syscall: Add fsmount() to create a mount for a superblock")
Fixes: cf3cba4a429b ("vfs: syscall: Add fspick() to select a superblock for reconfiguration")
