scsi: qla2xxx: Avoid that qlt_send_resp_ctio() corrupts memory

The "(&ctio->u.status1.sense_data)[i]" where i >= 0 expressions in
qlt_send_resp_ctio() are probably typos and should have been
"(&ctio->u.status1.sense_data[4 * i])" instead. Instead of only fixing
these typos, modify the code for storing sense data such that it becomes
easy to read. This patch fixes a Coverity complaint about accessing an
array outside its bounds.
