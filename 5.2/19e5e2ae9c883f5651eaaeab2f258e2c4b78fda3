csky: Fixup libgcc unwind error

The struct rt_sigframe is also defined in libgcc/config/csky/linux-unwind.h
of gcc. Although there is no use for the first three word space, we must
keep them the same with linux-unwind.h for member position.

The BUG is found in glibc test with the tst-cancel02.
The BUG is from commit:bf2416829362 of linux-5.2-rc1 merge window.
