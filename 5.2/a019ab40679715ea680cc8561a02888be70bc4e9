arm64: defconfig: Enable FSL_EDMA driver

Enables the FSL EDMA driver by default.  This also works around an issue
that imx-i2c driver keeps deferring the probe because of the DMA is not
ready.  And currently the DMA engine framework can not correctly tell
if the DMA channels will truly become available later (it will never be
available if the DMA driver is not enabled).

This will cause indefinite messages like below:
[    3.335829] imx-i2c 2180000.i2c: can't get pinctrl, bus recovery not supported
[    3.344455] ina2xx 0-0040: power monitor ina220 (Rshunt = 1000 uOhm)
