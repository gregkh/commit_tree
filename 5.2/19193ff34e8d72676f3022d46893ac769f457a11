scsi: lpfc: Fix handling of trunk links state reporting

If all the trunk links drop and a single link resumes, the link_state is
not properly reported. When trunked, the driver receives two async
cqes. One acqe reports the trunk link states, which the driver records.
The other cqe reports the overall state of the trunk. In the failing case,
the trunk link state acqe preceeds the overall trunk link state acqe. The
trunk link state acqe, as it's an "up" transition, calls a code path which
ensures a down transition before moving to the up state.  The down
transition had a side effect of clearing the just-saved trunk link states.

Fix by not clearing the trunk link states if we've already transitioned
to a down state.
