hwmon: lm95245: Fix build warnings

The following build warning is seen if CONFIG_OF is disabled.

drivers/hwmon/lm95245.c:626:34: warning:
	‘lm95245_of_match’ defined but not used

Mark lm95245_of_match as __maybe_unused to fix the problem.

The following build warning is always seen.

drivers/hwmon/lm95245.c:95:17: warning:
	‘lm95245_reg_address’ defined but not used

The array is no longer used since commit c0a4b9ec1b43 ("hwmon: (lm95245)
Use new hwmon registration API"). Remove it.
