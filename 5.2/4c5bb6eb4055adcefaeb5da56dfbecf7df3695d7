intel_th: Only report useful IRQs to subdevices

The only type of IRQ triggering event that is useful to us at the moment
is the "last block" interrupt of the MSU. This interrupt can only be
enabled via "MINTCTL" register that doesn't exist in earlier version of
the Intel TH.

Enumerate the presence of MINTCTL via per-device driver data structure
and only instantiate the IRQ resource for subdevices if this capability
is present.
