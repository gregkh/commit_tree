ALSA: usb-audio: Fix a memory leak bug

In parse_audio_selector_unit(), the string array 'namelist' is allocated
through kmalloc_array(), and each string pointer in this array, i.e.,
'namelist[]', is allocated through kmalloc() in the following for loop.
Then, a control instance 'kctl' is created by invoking snd_ctl_new1(). If
an error occurs during the creation process, the string array 'namelist',
including all string pointers in the array 'namelist[]', should be freed,
before the error code ENOMEM is returned. However, the current code does
not free 'namelist[]', resulting in memory leaks.

To fix the above issue, free all string pointers 'namelist[]' in a loop.
