tools/memory-model: Add SRCU support

Add support for SRCU.  Herd creates srcu events and linux-kernel.def
associates them with three possible annotations (srcu-lock,
srcu-unlock, and sync-srcu) corresponding to the API routines
srcu_read_lock(), srcu_read_unlock(), and synchronize_srcu().

The linux-kernel.bell file now declares the annotations
and determines matching lock/unlock pairs delimiting SRCU read-side
critical sections, and it also checks for synchronize_srcu() calls
inside an RCU critical section (which would generate a "sleeping in
atomic context" error in real kernel code).  The linux-kernel.cat file
now adds SRCU-induced ordering, analogous to the existing RCU-induced
ordering, to the gp and rcu-fence relations.

Curiously enough, these small changes to the model's .cat code are all
that is needed to describe SRCU.

Portions of this patch (linux-kernel.def and the first hunk in
linux-kernel.bell) were written by Luc Maranget.
