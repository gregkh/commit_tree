drm/tinydrm: Fix fbdev pixel format

Due to copy/paste error, the fbdev format was changed to 32bpp = XRGB8888
which is an emulated format for the RGB565 drivers. Revert to to using the
fallback which is dev->mode_config.preferred_depth for the drivers that
set it or 32bpp for those that don't (repaper, st7586).
