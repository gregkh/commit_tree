net: sched: taprio: Refactor taprio_get_start_time()

This patch does a code refactoring to taprio_get_start_time() function
to improve readability and report error properly.

If 'base' time is later than 'now', the start time is equal to 'base'
and taprio_get_start_time() is done. That's the natural case so we move
that code to the beginning of the function. Also, if 'cycle' calculation
is zero, something went really wrong with taprio and we should log that
internal error properly.
