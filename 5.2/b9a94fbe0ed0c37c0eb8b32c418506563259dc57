HID: logitech-dj: add support for the Logitech MX5500's Bluetooth Mini-Receiver

Add support for the HID proxy mode of the Logitech Bluetooth Mini-Receiver
which comes with the Logitech MX5500 keyboard. This receiver works the same
as the Bluetooth Mini-Receiver coming with the MX5000 keyboard and also
presents itself as an USB-hub with 2 separate USB devices for the keyboard
(boot sub-class) interface and for the (boot sub-class) mouse interface.
