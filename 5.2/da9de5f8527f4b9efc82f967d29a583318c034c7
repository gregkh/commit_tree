IB/hfi1: Close PSM sdma_progress sleep window

The call to sdma_progress() is called outside the wait lock.

In this case, there is a race condition where sdma_progress() can return
false and the sdma_engine can idle.  If that happens, there will be no
more sdma interrupts to cause the wakeup and the user_sdma xmit will hang.

Fix by moving the lock to enclose the sdma_progress() call.

Also, delete busycount. The need for this was removed by:
