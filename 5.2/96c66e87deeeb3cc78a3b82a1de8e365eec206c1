KVM/nVMX: Use kvm_vcpu_map when mapping the virtual APIC page

Use kvm_vcpu_map when mapping the virtual APIC page since using
kvm_vcpu_gpa_to_page() and kmap() will only work for guest memory that has
a "struct page".

One additional semantic change is that the virtual host mapping lifecycle
has changed a bit. It now has the same lifetime of the pinning of the
virtual APIC page on the host side.
