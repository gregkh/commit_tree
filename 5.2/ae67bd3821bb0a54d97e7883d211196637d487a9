SUNRPC: Fix up task signalling

The RPC_TASK_KILLED flag should really not be set from another context
because it can clobber data in the struct task when task->tk_flags is
changed non-atomically.
Let's therefore swap out RPC_TASK_KILLED with an atomic flag, and add
a function to set that flag and safely wake up the task.
