uapi, fsopen: use square brackets around "fscontext" [ver #2]

Make the name of the anon inode fd "[fscontext]" instead of "fscontext".
This is minor but most core-kernel anon inode fds already carry square
brackets around their name:

[eventfd]
[eventpoll]
[fanotify]
[io_uring]
[pidfd]
[signalfd]
[timerfd]
[userfaultfd]

For the sake of consistency lets do the same for the fscontext anon inode
fd that comes with the new mount api.
