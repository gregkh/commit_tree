reiserfs: add comment to explain endianness issue in xattr_hash

csum_partial() gives different results for little-endian and big-endian
hosts.  This causes images created on little-endian hosts and mounted on
big endian hosts to see csum mismatches.  This causes an endianness bug.
Sparse gives a warning as csum_partial returns a restricted integer type
__wsum_t and xattr_hash expects __u32.  This warning acts as a reminder
for this bug and should not be suppressed.

This comment aims to convey these endianness issues.
