HID: logitech-hidpp: make .probe usbhid capable

The current custom solution for the G920 is not the best because
hid_hw_start() is not called at the end of the .probe().
It means that any configuration retrieved after the initial hid_hw_start
would not be exposed to user space without races.

We can simply force hid_hw_start to just enable the transport layer by
not using a connect_mask. This way, we can have a common path between
USB, Unifying and Bluetooth devices.

With this change, we can now support the non DJ receivers for low end
devices, which will allow us to fetch the actual names of the paired
device (instead of 'Logitech Wireless Receiver')

Tested with a M185 with the non unifying receiver, a T650 and many other
unifying devices, and the T651 over Bluetooth.
