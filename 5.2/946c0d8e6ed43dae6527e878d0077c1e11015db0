netfilter: nf_queue: fix reinject verdict handling

This patch fixes netfilter hook traversal when there are more than 1 hooks
returning NF_QUEUE verdict. When the first queue reinjects the packet,
'nf_reinject' starts traversing hooks with a proper hook_index. However,
if it again receives a NF_QUEUE verdict (by some other netfilter hook), it
queues the packet with a wrong hook_index. So, when the second queue
reinjects the packet, it re-executes hooks in between.
