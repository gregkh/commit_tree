KEYS: do not kmemdup digest in {public,tpm}_key_verify_signature

Treat (struct public_key_signature)'s digest same as its signature (s).
Since digest should be already in the kmalloc'd memory do not kmemdup
digest value before calling {public,tpm}_key_verify_signature.

Patch is split from the previous as suggested by Herbert Xu.
