drm/i915: Stop needlessly acquiring wakeref for debugfs/drop_caches_set

We only need to acquire a wakeref for ourselves for a few operations, as
most either already acquire their own wakeref or imply a wakeref. In
particular, it is i915_gem_set_wedged() that needed us to present it
with a wakeref, which is incongruous with its "use anywhere" ability.
