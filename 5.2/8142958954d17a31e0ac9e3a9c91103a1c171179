selftests/bpf: extend bpf tunnel test with tso

Segmentation offload takes a longer path. Verify that the feature
works with large packets.

The test succeeds if not setting dodgy in bpf_skb_adjust_room, as veth
TSO is permissive.

If not setting SKB_GSO_DODGY, this enables tunneled TSO offload on
supporting NICs.

The feature sets SKB_GSO_DODGY because the caller is untrusted. As a
result the packets traverse through the gso stack at least up to TCP.
And fail the gso_type validation, such as the skb->encapsulation check
in gre_gso_segment and the gso_type checks introduced in commit
418e897e0716 ("gso: validate gso_type on ipip style tunnel").

This will be addressed in a follow-on feature patch. In the meantime,
disable the new gso tests.

Changes v1->v2:
  - not all netcat versions support flag '-q', use timeout instead
