btrfs: Pass 0 for bio_offset to btrfs_wq_submit_bio

Buffered writeback always calls btrfs_csum_one_bio with the last 2
arguments being 0 irrespective of what the bio_offset has been passed to
btrfs_submit_bio_start. Make this apparent by explicitly passing 0 for
bio_offset when calling btrfs_wq_submit_bio from btrfs_submit_bio_hook.
This will allow for further simplifications down the line. No functional
changes.
