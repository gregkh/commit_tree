drm/i915: Use lockdep_pin_lock() over the construction of the request

During request construction, we take the timeline->mutex to ensure
exclusive access to the ringbuffer (for command emission) and the
timeline itself (for command ordering). The timeline->mutex should not
be dropped by callers until we release it in i915_request_add().

lockdep provides a pin/unpin lock facility to detect accidental unlocks
inside critical sections, so put it to use for request construction.
