IB: Pass only ib_udata in function prototypes

Now when ib_udata is passed to all the driver's object create/destroy APIs
the ib_udata will carry the ib_ucontext for every user command. There is
no need to also pass the ib_ucontext via the functions prototypes.

Make ib_udata the only argument psssed.
