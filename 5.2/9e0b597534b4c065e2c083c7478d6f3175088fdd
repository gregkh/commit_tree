dt-bindings: drm/panel: simple: add lg,acx467akm-7 panel

Add binding for the LG ACX467AKM-7 4.95" 1080Ã—1920 LCD panel that is
found on the LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone. This appears to be a JDI
panel based on some Internet searches, however a specific model number
could not be found. I disassembled an old Nexus 5 with a broken
screen and the LG part number is the only model number present on the
back of the panel, so I think that is probably the best ID to use.
