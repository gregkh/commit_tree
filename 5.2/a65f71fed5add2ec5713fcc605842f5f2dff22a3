ice: map Rx buffer pages with DMA attributes

Provide DMA_ATTR_WEAK_ORDERING and DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC attributes to
the DMA API during the mapping operations on Rx side. With this change
the non-x86 platforms will be able to sync only with what is being used
(2k buffer) instead of entire page. This should yield a slight
performance improvement.

Furthermore, DMA unmap may destroy the changes that were made to the
buffer by CPU when platform is not a x86 one. DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC
attribute usage fixes this issue.

Also add a sync_single_for_device call during the Rx buffer assignment,
to make sure that the cache lines are cleared before device attempting
to write to the buffer.
