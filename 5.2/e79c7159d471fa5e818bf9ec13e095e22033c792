media: media requests: return EBADR instead of EACCES

If requests are used when they shouldn't, or not used when they should,
then return EBADR (Invalid request descriptor) instead of EACCES.

The reason for this change is that EACCES has more to do with permissions
(not being the owner of the resource), but in this case the request file
descriptor is just wrong for the current mode of the device.

Update the documentation accordingly.
