LSM: add new hook for kernfs node initialization

This patch introduces a new security hook that is intended for
initializing the security data for newly created kernfs nodes, which
provide a way of storing a non-default security context, but need to
operate independently from mounts (and therefore may not have an
associated inode at the moment of creation).

The main motivation is to allow kernfs nodes to inherit the context of
the parent under SELinux, similar to the behavior of
security_inode_init_security(). Other LSMs may implement their own logic
for handling the creation of new nodes.

This patch also adds helper functions to <linux/kernfs.h> for
getting/setting security xattrs of a kernfs node so that LSMs hooks are
able to do their job. Other important attributes should be accessible
direcly in the kernfs_node fields (in case there is need for more, then
new helpers should be added to kernfs.h along with the patch that needs
them).
