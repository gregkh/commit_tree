s390/qdio: pass up count of ready-to-process SBALs

When qdio_{in,out}bound_q_moved() scans a queue for pending work, it
currently only returns a boolean to its caller. The interface to the
upper-layer-drivers (qdio_kick_handler() and qdio_get_next_buffers())
then re-calculates the number of pending SBALs from the
q->first_to_check and q->first_to_kick cursors.

Refactor this so that whenever get_{in,out}bound_buffer_frontier()
adjusted the queue's first_to_check cursor, it also returns the
corresponding count of ready-to-process SBALs (and 0 else).
A subsequent patch will then make use of this additional information.
