fbdev: sm712fb: fix memory frequency by avoiding a switch/case fallthrough

A fallthrough in switch/case was introduced in f627caf55b8e ("fbdev:
sm712fb: fix crashes and garbled display during DPMS modesetting"),
due to my copy-paste error, which would cause the memory clock frequency
for SM720 to be programmed to SM712.

Since it only reprograms the clock to a different frequency, it's only
a benign issue without visible side-effect, so it also evaded Sudip
Mukherjee's code review and regression tests. scripts/checkpatch.pl
also failed to discover the issue, possibly due to nested switch
statements.

This issue was found by Stephen Rothwell by building linux-next with
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
