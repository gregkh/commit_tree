ACPI/PCI: PM: Add missing wakeup.flags.valid checks

Both acpi_pci_need_resume() and acpi_dev_needs_resume() check if the
current ACPI wakeup configuration of the device matches what is
expected as far as system wakeup from sleep states is concerned, as
reflected by the device_may_wakeup() return value for the device.

However, they only should do that if wakeup.flags.valid is set for
the device's ACPI companion, because otherwise the wakeup.prepare_count
value for it is meaningless.

Add the missing wakeup.flags.valid checks to these functions.
