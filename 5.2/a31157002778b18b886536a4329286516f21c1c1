scsi: hisi_sas: Don't hard reset disk during controller reset

In the function of hisi_sas_init_device(), we added ops->hardreset() to
clear affiliation of STP target port or handle [STP pending] state.

Function hisi_sas_init_device() will be called when a device is found or
during controller reset. At controller reset, we call
hisi_sas_init_device() to re-init the disks, so calling hardreset() is
unnecessary and it also will cause some delay at controller reset.
