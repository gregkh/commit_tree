drm/amd/display: Read eDP link settings on detection

[Why]
Unlike external DP panels, internal eDP does not perform
verify link caps because the panel connection is fixed.

So if GOP enabled the eDP at boot, we can retain its
trained link settings to optimize.

[How]
Read the lane count and link rate by reading this
information from DPCD 100h, 101h, 115h
