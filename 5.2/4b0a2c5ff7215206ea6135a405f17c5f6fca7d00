virtio_console: initialize vtermno value for ports

For regular serial ports we do not initialize value of vtermno
variable. A garbage value is assigned for non console ports.
The value can be observed as a random integer with [1].

[1] vim /sys/kernel/debug/virtio-ports/vport*p*

This patch initialize the value of vtermno for console serial
ports to '1' and regular serial ports are initiaized to '0'.
