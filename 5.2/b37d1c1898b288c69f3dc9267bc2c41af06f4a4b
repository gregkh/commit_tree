parisc: Use per-pagetable spinlock

PA-RISC uses a global spinlock to protect pagetable updates in the TLB
fault handlers. When multiple cores are taking TLB faults simultaneously,
the cache line containing the spinlock becomes a bottleneck.

This patch embeds the spinlock in the top level page directory, so that
every process has its own lock. It improves performance by 30% when
doing parallel compilations.

At least on the N class systems, only one PxTLB inter processor
broadcast can be active at any one time on the Merced bus. If a Merced
bus is found, this patch serializes the TLB flushes with the
pa_tlb_flush_lock spinlock.
