ALSA: hda: Fix racy display power access

snd_hdac_display_power() doesn't handle the concurrent calls carefully
enough, and it may lead to the doubly get_power or put_power calls,
when a runtime PM and an async work get called in racy way.

This patch addresses it by reusing the bus->lock mutex that has been
used for protecting the link state change in ext bus code, so that it
can protect against racy display state changes.  The initialization of
bus->lock was moved from snd_hdac_ext_bus_init() to
snd_hdac_bus_init() as well accordingly.
