wil6210: fix report of rx packet checksum in edma mode

Update the rx packet checksum of received packet according to edma
HW spec:

No need to calculate checksum in the following cases:
L4_status=0 and L3_status=0 - No L3 and no L4 known protocols found
L4_status=0 and L3_status=1 - L3 was found, and checksum check passed.
No known L4 protocol was found.
L4_status=1 - L4 was found, and checksum check passed.

Recalculate checksum in the following cases:
L4_status=3 and L3_status=1 - It means that L3 protocol was found,
and checksum passed, but L4 checksum failed.
L4_status=3 and L3_status=2	- Both L3 and L4 checksum check failed.
