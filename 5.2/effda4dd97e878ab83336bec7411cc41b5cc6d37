ipv6: Pass fib6_result to fib lookups

Change fib6_lookup and fib6_table_lookup to take a fib6_result and set
f6i and nh rather than returning a fib6_info. For now both always
return 0.

A later patch set can make these more like the IPv4 counterparts and
return EINVAL, EACCESS, etc based on fib6_type.
