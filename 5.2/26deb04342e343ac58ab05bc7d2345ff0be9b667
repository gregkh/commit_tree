powerpc: prepare string/mem functions for KASAN

CONFIG_KASAN implements wrappers for memcpy() memmove() and memset()
Those wrappers are doing the verification then call respectively
__memcpy() __memmove() and __memset(). The arches are therefore
expected to rename their optimised functions that way.

For files on which KASAN is inhibited, #defines are used to allow
them to directly call optimised versions of the functions without
going through the KASAN wrappers.

See commit 393f203f5fd5 ("x86_64: kasan: add interceptors for
memset/memmove/memcpy functions") for details.

Other string / mem functions do not (yet) have kasan wrappers,
we therefore have to fallback to the generic versions when
KASAN is active, otherwise KASAN checks will be skipped.
