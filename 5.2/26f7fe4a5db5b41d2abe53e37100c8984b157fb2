selftests: netfilter: add ebtables broute test case

ebtables -t broute allows to redirect packets in a way that
they get pushed up the stack, even if the interface is part
of a bridge.

In case of IP packets to non-local address, this means
those IP packets are routed instead of bridged-forwarded, just
as if the bridge would not have existed.

Expected test output is:
PASS: netns connectivity: ns1 and ns2 can reach each other
PASS: ns1/ns2 connectivity with active broute rule
PASS: ns1/ns2 connectivity with active broute rule and bridge forward drop
