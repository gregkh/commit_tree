kvm, x86: Properly check whether a pfn is an MMIO or not

pfn_valid check is not sufficient because it only checks if a page has a struct
page or not, if "mem=" was passed to the kernel some valid pages won't have a
struct page. This means that if guests were assigned valid memory that lies
after the mem= boundary it will be passed uncached to the guest no matter what
the guest caching attributes are for this memory.

Introduce a new function e820__mapped_raw_any which is equivalent to
e820__mapped_any but uses the original e820 unmodified and use it to
identify real *RAM*.
