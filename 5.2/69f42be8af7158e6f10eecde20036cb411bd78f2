net: phy: marvell: add PHY tunable fast link down support for 88E1540

1000BaseT standard requires that a link is reported as down earliest
after 750ms. Several use case however require a much faster detecion
of a broken link. Fast Link Down supports this by intentionally
violating a the standard. This patch exposes the Fast Link Down
feature of 88E1540 and 88E6390. These PHY's can be found as internal
PHY's in several switches: 88E6352, 88E6240, 88E6176, 88E6172,
and 88E6390(X). Fast Link Down and EEE are mutually exclusive.
