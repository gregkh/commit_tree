media: atmel: atmel-isc: reworked driver and formats

This change is a redesign in the formats and the way the ISC is
configured w.r.t. sensor format and the output format from the ISC.
I have changed the splitting between sensor output (which is also ISC input)
and ISC output.
The sensor format represents the way the sensor is configured, and what ISC
is receiving.
The format configuration represents the way ISC is interpreting the data and
formatting the output to the subsystem.
Now it's much easier to figure out what is the ISC configuration for input, and
what is the configuration for output.
The non-raw format can be obtained directly from sensor or it can be done
inside the ISC. The controller format list will include a configuration for
each format.
The old supported formats are still in place, if we want to dump the sensor
format directly to the output, the try format routine will detect and
configure the pipeline accordingly.
This also fixes the previous issues when the raw format was NULL which
resulted in many crashes for sensors which did not have the expected/tested
formats.
