timer: Move trace point to get proper index

When placing the timer_start trace point before the timer wheel bucket
index is calculated, the index information in the trace point is useless.

It is not possible to simply move the debug_activate() call after the index
calculation, because debug_object_activate() needs to be called before
touching the object.

Therefore split debug_activate() and move the trace point into
enqueue_timer() after the new index has been calculated. The
debug_object_activate() call remains at the original place.
