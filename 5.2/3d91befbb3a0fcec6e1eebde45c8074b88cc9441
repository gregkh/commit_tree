arm64: KVM: Enable !VHE support for :G/:H perf event modifiers

Enable/disable event counters as appropriate when entering and exiting
the guest to enable support for guest or host only event counting.

For both VHE and non-VHE we switch the counters between host/guest at
EL2.

The PMU may be on when we change which counters are enabled however
we avoid adding an isb as we instead rely on existing context
synchronisation events: the eret to enter the guest (__guest_enter)
and eret in kvm_call_hyp for __kvm_vcpu_run_nvhe on returning.
