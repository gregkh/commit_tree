rcuperf: Fix cleanup path for invalid perf_type strings

If the specified rcuperf.perf_type is not in the rcu_perf_init()
function's perf_ops[] array, rcuperf prints some console messages and
then invokes rcu_perf_cleanup() to set state so that a future torture
test can run.  However, rcu_perf_cleanup() also attempts to end the
test that didn't actually start, and in doing so relies on the value
of cur_ops, a value that is not particularly relevant in this case.
This can result in confusing output or even follow-on failures due to
attempts to use facilities that have not been properly initialized.

This commit therefore sets the value of cur_ops to NULL in this case and
inserts a check near the beginning of rcu_perf_cleanup(), thus avoiding
relying on an irrelevant cur_ops value.
