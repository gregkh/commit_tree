Revert "ide: unexport DISK_EVENT_MEDIA_CHANGE for ide-gd and ide-cd"

This reverts commit 7eec77a1816a7042591a6cbdb4820e9e7ebffe0e.

Instead of leaving disk->events completely empty, we now export the
supported events again, and tell the block layer not to forward events
to user space by not setting DISK_EVENT_FLAG_UEVENT. This allows the
block layer to distinguish between devices that for which events should
be handled in kernel only, and devices which don't support any meda
change events at all.
