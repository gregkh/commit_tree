fscrypt: drop inode argument from fscrypt_get_ctx()

The only reason the inode is being passed to fscrypt_get_ctx() is to
verify that the encryption key is available.  However, all callers
already ensure this because if we get as far as trying to do I/O to an
encrypted file without the key, there's already a bug.

Therefore, remove this unnecessary argument.
