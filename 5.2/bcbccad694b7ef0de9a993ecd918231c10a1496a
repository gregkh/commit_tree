selftests/bpf: bring back (void *) cast to set_ipv4_csum in test_tc_tunnel

It was removed in commit 166b5a7f2ca3 ("selftests_bpf: extend
test_tc_tunnel for UDP encap") without any explanation.

Otherwise I see:
progs/test_tc_tunnel.c:160:17: warning: taking address of packed member 'ip' of class or structure
      'v4hdr' may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Waddress-of-packed-member]
        set_ipv4_csum(&h_outer.ip);
                       ^~~~~~~~~~
