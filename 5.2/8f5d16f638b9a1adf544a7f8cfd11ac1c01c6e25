net: dsa: Be aware of switches where VLAN filtering is a global setting

On some switches, the action of whether to parse VLAN frame headers and use
that information for ingress admission is configurable, but not per
port. Such is the case for the Broadcom BCM53xx and the NXP SJA1105
families, for example. In that case, DSA can prevent the bridge core
from trying to apply different VLAN filtering settings on net devices
that belong to the same switch.
