drm/i915: Pull sync_scru for device reset outside of wedge_mutex

We need to flush our srcu protecting resources about to be clobbered
by the reset, inside of our timer failsafe but outside of the
error->wedge_mutex, so that the failsafe can run in case the
synchronize_srcu() takes too long (hits a shrinker deadlock?).
