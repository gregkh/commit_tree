KVM: arm64: Clarify access behaviour for out-of-range SVE register slice IDs

The existing documentation for which SVE register slice IDs are
considered out-of-range, and what happens when userspace tries to
access them, is cryptic.

This patch rewords the text with the aim of making it a bit easier to
understand.

No functional change.
