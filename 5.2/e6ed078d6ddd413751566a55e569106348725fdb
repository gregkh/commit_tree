drm/i915/icl: Add degamma and gamma lut size to gen11 caps

Add the degamma and gamma lut sizes to gen11 capability

entries and this will be addressed with new segmented gamma ABI
in a future patch.

v2: Reorder the patch as per Maarten's suggestion.

v3: Rebase

v4: Updated commit message with a note as per Matt's suggestion.

v5: No Change.
