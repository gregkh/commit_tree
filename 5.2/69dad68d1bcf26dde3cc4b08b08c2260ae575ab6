net/mlx5e: Turn on HW tunnel offload in all TIRs

Hardware requires that all TIRs that steer traffic to the same RQ
should share identical tunneled_offload_en value.
For that, the tunneled_offload_en bit should be set/unset (according to
the HW capability) for all TIRs', not only the ones dedicated for
tunneled (inner) traffic.
