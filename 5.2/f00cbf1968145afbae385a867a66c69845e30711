net/sched: use the hardware intermediate representation for matchall

Extends matchall offload to make use of the hardware intermediate
representation. More specifically, this patch moves the native TC
actions in cls_matchall offload to the newer flow_action
representation. This ultimately allows us to avoid a direct
dependency on native TC actions for matchall.
