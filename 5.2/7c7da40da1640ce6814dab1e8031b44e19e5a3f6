Input: uinput - add compat ioctl number translation for UI_*_FF_UPLOAD

In the case of compat syscall ioctl numbers for UI_BEGIN_FF_UPLOAD and
UI_END_FF_UPLOAD need to be adjusted before being passed on
uinput_ioctl_handler() since code built with -m32 will be passing
slightly different values. Extend the code already covering
UI_SET_PHYS to cover UI_BEGIN_FF_UPLOAD and UI_END_FF_UPLOAD as well.
