staging: fieldbus: anybus-s: keep device bus id in bus endianness

"Normal" bus structures such as USB or PCI keep device bus ids
in bus endinanness, and driver bus ids in host endianness.
Endianness conversion happens each time bus_match() is called.

Modify anybus-s to conform to this pattern. As a pleasant side-
effect, sparse warnings will now disappear.

This was suggested by Al Viro.
