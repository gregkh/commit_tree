i40e: Introduce recovery mode support

This patch introduces "recovery mode" to the i40e driver. It is
part of a new Any2Any idea of upgrading the firmware. In this
approach, it is required for the driver to have support for
"transition firmware", that is used for migrating from structured
to flat firmware image. In this new, very basic mode, i40e driver
must be able to handle particular IOCTL calls from the NVM Update
Tool and run a small set of AQ commands.

These additional AQ commands are part of the interface used by
the NVMUpdate tool.  The NVMUpdate tool contains all of the
necessary logic to reference these new AQ commands.  The end user
experience remains the same, they are using the NVMUpdate tool to
update the NVM contents.
