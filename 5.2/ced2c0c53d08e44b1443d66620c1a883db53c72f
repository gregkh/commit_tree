HID: logitech-hidpp: add support for the MX5500 keyboard

The MX5500 keyboard needs the HIDPP_CONSUMER_VENDOR_KEYS quirk to report
events for the 'A' - 'D' Smart Keys and for the "Photo Gallery" and
"Gadgets" keys.

In addition to this adding the Bluetooth match, so that hid-logitech-hidpp
is used instead of the generic HID driver, also adds battery monitoring
support when the keyboard is connected over Bluetooth.
