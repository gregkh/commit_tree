kvm: x86: Include CPUID leaf 0x8000001e in kvm's supported CPUID

Kvm now supports extended CPUID functions through 0x8000001f.  CPUID
leaf 0x8000001e is AMD's Processor Topology Information leaf. This
contains similar information to CPUID leaf 0xb (Intel's Extended
Topology Enumeration leaf), and should be included in the output of
KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID, even though userspace is likely to override
some of this information based upon the configuration of the
particular VM.
