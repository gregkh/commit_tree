parisc: Use implicit space register selection for loading the coherence index of I/O pdirs

We only support I/O to kernel space. Using %sr1 to load the coherence
index may be racy unless interrupts are disabled. This patch changes the
code used to load the coherence index to use implicit space register
selection. This saves one instruction and eliminates the race.

Tested on rp3440, c8000 and c3750.
