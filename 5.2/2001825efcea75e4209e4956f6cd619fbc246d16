KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Avoid lockdep debugging in TCE realmode handlers

The kvmppc_tce_to_ua() helper is called from real and virtual modes
and it works fine as long as CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKDEP is not enabled.
However if the lockdep debugging is on, the lockdep will most likely break
in kvm_memslots() because of srcu_dereference_check() so we need to use
PPC-own kvm_memslots_raw() which uses realmode safe
rcu_dereference_raw_notrace().

This creates a realmode copy of kvmppc_tce_to_ua() which replaces
kvm_memslots() with kvm_memslots_raw().

Since kvmppc_rm_tce_to_ua() becomes static and can only be used inside
HV KVM, this moves it earlier under CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_HV_POSSIBLE.

This moves truly virtual-mode kvmppc_tce_to_ua() to where it belongs and
drops the prmap parameter which was never used in the virtual mode.
