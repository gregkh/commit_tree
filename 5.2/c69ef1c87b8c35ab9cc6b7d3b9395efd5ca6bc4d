scripts/tags.sh: fix direct execution of scripts/tags.sh

I thought this script was run via "make tags" etc. but some people
run it directly.

Prior to commit a9a49c2ad9b9 ("kbuild: use $(srctree) instead of
KBUILD_SRC to check out-of-tree build"), in such a usecase, "tree"
was set empty since KBUILD_SRC is undefined. Now, "tree" is set to
"${srctree}/", which is evaluated to "/".

Fix it by taking into account the case where "srctree" is unset.
