include/linux/generic-radix-tree.h: fix kerneldoc comment

The DOC comment block section in include/linux/generic-radix-tree.h
contained a spurious colon, causing this warning in the documentation
build:

  include/linux/generic-radix-tree.h:1: warning: no structured comments found

Remove the colon and make the docs build happy.
