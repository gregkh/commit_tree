arm64: dts: msm8998: thermal: split address space into two

We've earlier added support to split the register address space into TM
and SROT regions. Split up the regmap address space into two for msm8998
that has a similar register layout.

The order is important (TM before SROT) because we make an assumption
that SROT is always the second address space in order to support legacy
DTs.
