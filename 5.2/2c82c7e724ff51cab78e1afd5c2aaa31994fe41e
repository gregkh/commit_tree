netfilter: nf_tables: fix oops during rule dump

We can oops in nf_tables_fill_rule_info().

Its not possible to fetch previous element in rcu-protected lists
when deletions are not prevented somehow: list_del_rcu poisons
the ->prev pointer value.

Before rcu-conversion this was safe as dump operations did hold
nfnetlink mutex.

Pass previous rule as argument, obtained by keeping a pointer to
the previous rule during traversal.
