bpf, libbpf: add support for BTF Var and DataSec

This adds libbpf support for BTF Var and DataSec kinds. Main point
here is that libbpf needs to do some preparatory work before the
whole BTF object can be loaded into the kernel, that is, fixing up
of DataSec size taken from the ELF section size and non-static
variable offset which needs to be taken from the ELF's string section.

Upstream LLVM doesn't fix these up since at time of BTF emission
it is too early in the compilation process thus this information
isn't available yet, hence loader needs to take care of it.

Note, deduplication handling has not been in the scope of this work
and needs to be addressed in a future commit.
