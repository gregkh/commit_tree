spi/spi-bcm2835: Split transfers that exceed DLEN

Split spi transfers into chunks of <=65532 to enable the driver to
perform DMA transfer on big buffers. The DLEN register specifies the
number of bytes to transfer in DMA mode. It is 16-bit wide and thus the
maximum DMA transfer is 65535 bytes. Set the maximum to 65532 (4 byte
aligned) since the FIFO in DMA mode is accessed in 4 byte chunks.

->max_dma_len is the value the spi core uses when splitting the buffer
into scatter gather entries.
The BCM2835 DMA block has 2 types of channels/engines:
- Normal: Max length: 1G
- Lite: Max length: 65535

Even when using a Lite channel we will not exceed the max length, so
let's drop setting ->max_dma_len.
