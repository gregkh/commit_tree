cxgb4: Revert "cxgb4: Remove SGE_HOST_PAGE_SIZE dependency on page size"

This reverts commit 2391b0030e241386d710df10e53e2cfc3c5d4fc1 which has
introduced regression. Now SGE's BAR2 Doorbell/GTS Page Size is
interpreted correctly in the firmware itself by using actual host
page size. Hence previous commit needs to be reverted.
