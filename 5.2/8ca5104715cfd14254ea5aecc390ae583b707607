ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Fix clang warning without CONFIG_PM

Building with clang shows a variable that is only used by the
suspend/resume functions but defined outside of their #ifdef block:

sound/soc/ti/davinci-mcasp.c:48:12: error: variable 'context_regs' is not needed and will not be emitted

We commonly fix these by marking the PM functions as __maybe_unused,
but here that would grow the davinci_mcasp structure, so instead
add another #ifdef here.
