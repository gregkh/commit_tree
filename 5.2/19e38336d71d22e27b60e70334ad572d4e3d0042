KVM: VMX: Include architectural defs header in capabilities.h

The capabilities header depends on asm/vmx.h but doesn't explicitly
include said file.  This currently doesn't cause problems as all users
of capbilities.h first include asm/vmx.h, but the issue often results in
build errors if someone starts moving things around the VMX files.
