net/mlx5: E-Switch, add a new prio to be used by the RDMA side

Create a new prio in the FDB, it will be used when inserting steering rules
into the FDB from the RDMA side. We create a new PRIO so rules from the
net side and rules from the RDMA side won't be inserted to the same PRIO,
each side has it's own sandbox to play in.
