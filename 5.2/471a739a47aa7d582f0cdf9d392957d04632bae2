PCI: PM: Avoid skipping bus-level PM on platforms without ACPI

There are platforms that do not call pm_set_suspend_via_firmware(),
so pm_suspend_via_firmware() returns 'false' on them, but the power
states of PCI devices (PCIe ports in particular) are changed as a
result of powering down core platform components during system-wide
suspend.  Thus the pm_suspend_via_firmware() checks in
pci_pm_suspend_noirq() and pci_pm_resume_noirq() introduced by
commit 3e26c5feed2a ("PCI: PM: Skip devices in D0 for suspend-to-
idle") are not sufficient to determine that devices left in D0
during suspend will remain in D0 during resume and so the bus-level
power management can be skipped for them.

For this reason, introduce a new global suspend flag,
PM_SUSPEND_FLAG_NO_PLATFORM, set it for suspend-to-idle only
and replace the pm_suspend_via_firmware() checks mentioned above
with checks against this flag.
