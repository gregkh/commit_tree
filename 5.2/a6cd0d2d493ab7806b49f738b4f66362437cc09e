Documentation: net-sysfs: Remove duplicate PHY device documentation

Both sysfs-bus-mdio and sysfs-class-net-phydev contain the same
duplication information. There is not currently any MDIO bus specific
attribute, but there are PHY device (struct phy_device) specific
attributes. Use the more precise description from sysfs-bus-mdio and
carry that over to sysfs-class-net-phydev.
