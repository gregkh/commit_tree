vfs: syscall: Add fspick() to select a superblock for reconfiguration

Provide an fspick() system call that can be used to pick an existing
mountpoint into an fs_context which can thereafter be used to reconfigure a
superblock (equivalent of the superblock side of -o remount).

This looks like:

	int fd = fspick(AT_FDCWD, "/mnt",
			FSPICK_CLOEXEC | FSPICK_NO_AUTOMOUNT);
	fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_SET_FLAG, "intr", NULL, 0);
	fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_SET_FLAG, "noac", NULL, 0);
	fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_CMD_RECONFIGURE, NULL, NULL, 0);

At the point of fspick being called, the file descriptor referring to the
filesystem context is in exactly the same state as the one that was created
by fsopen() after fsmount() has been successfully called.
