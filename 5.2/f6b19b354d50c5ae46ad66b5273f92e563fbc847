net: devlink: select NET_DEVLINK from drivers

Some drivers are becoming more dependent on NET_DEVLINK being selected
in configuration. With upcoming compat functions, the behavior would be
wrong in case devlink was not compiled in. So make the drivers select
NET_DEVLINK and rely on the functions being there, not just stubs.
