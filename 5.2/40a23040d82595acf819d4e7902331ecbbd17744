i40e: Setting VF to VLAN 0 requires restart

This patch fixes a bug where changing VLAN to 0 was not set until VF
restart.

Now we are setting pvid info to 0 when we have to change VLAN to 0.
Without this change when VF VLAN was changed to 0 nothing happened until
VF restart. For changing to VLAN different than 0 it worked correctly.
