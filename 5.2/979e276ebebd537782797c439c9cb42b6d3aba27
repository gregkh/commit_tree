net: Use common nexthop init and release helpers

With fib_nh_common in place, move common initialization and release
code into helpers used by both ipv4 and ipv6. For the moment, the init
is just the lwt encap and the release is both the netdev reference and
the the lwt state reference. More will be added later.
