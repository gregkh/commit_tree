scsi: ufs: Remove unused min_uA field in struct ufs_vreg

There are two fields related to regulator current limit in struct ufs_vreg:
"min_uA" and "max_uA".

"max_uA" is probed by "<name>-max-microamp" property from device tree and
used for

 - regulator_set_load operations
 - icc_level configuration in device

However "min_uA" field is not used anywhere, thus we can remove it.
