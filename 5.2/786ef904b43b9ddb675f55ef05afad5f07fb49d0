net/mlx5: Reuse mlx5_esw_for_each_vf_vport macro in two files

Currently mlx5_esw_for_each_vf_vport iterates over mlx5_vport entries in
eswitch.c
Same macro in eswitch_offloads.c iterates over vport number in
eswitch_offloads.c

Instead of duplicate macro names, to avoid confusion and to reuse the
same macro in both files, move it to eswitch.h.

To iterate over vport numbers where there is no need to iterate over
mlx5_vport, but only a vport number is needed, rename those macros in
eswitch_offloads.c to mlx5_esw_for_each_vf_num_vport*.

While at it, keep all vport and vport rep iterators together.
