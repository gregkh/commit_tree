ice: Fix issue with VF reset and multiple VFs support on PFs

This patch fixes issues with VF queues being disabled, and VF netdev
network carrier being lost after reset. Basically, we need to check if VF
is enabled, and queue configured in reset_all_vfs flow, and disable/enable
those queues appropriately whenever the function is called after
Global/CORER/PFR reset/rebuild/replay.
