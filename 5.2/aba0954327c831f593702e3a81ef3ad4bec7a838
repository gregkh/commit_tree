tick/broadcast: Fix warning about undefined tick_broadcast_oneshot_offline()

Randconfig builds with

  CONFIG_TICK_ONESHOT=y
  CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n

trigger

  kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c:39:13: warning: ‘tick_broadcast_oneshot_offline’ \
	  declared ‘static’ but never defined [-Wunused-function]

due to that function's definition missing.

Move the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU ifdeffery around its declaration too.
