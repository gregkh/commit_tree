parisc: Update huge TLB page support to use per-pagetable spinlock

This patch updates the parisc huge TLB page support to use per-pagetable spinlocks.

This patch requires Mikulas' per-pagetable spinlock patch and the revised TLB
serialization patch from Helge and myself.  With Mikulas' patch, we need to use
the per-pagetable spinlock for page table updates.  The TLB lock is only used
to serialize TLB flushes on machines with the Merced bus.
