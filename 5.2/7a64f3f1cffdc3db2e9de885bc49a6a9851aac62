riscv/signal: Fixup additional syscall restarting

The function of do_notify_resume called by entry.S could be entered
in loop when SIGPENDING was setted again before sret. So we must add
prevent code to make syscall restart (regs->sepc -= 0x4) or it may
re-execute unexpected instructions.

Just like in_syscall & forget_syscall used by arm.
