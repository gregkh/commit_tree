mac80211: when using iTXQ, select the queue in ieee80211_subif_start_xmit

When using iTXQ, the network stack does not need the real queue number, since
mac80211 is using its internal queues anyway. In that case we can defer
selecting the queue and remove a redundant station lookup in the tx path to save
some CPU cycles.
