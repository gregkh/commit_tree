bcache: avoid potential memleak of list of journal_replay(s) in the CACHE_SYNC branch of run_cache_set

In the CACHE_SYNC branch of run_cache_set(), LIST_HEAD(journal) is used
to collect journal_replay(s) and filled by bch_journal_read().

If all goes well, bch_journal_replay() will release the list of
jounal_replay(s) at the end of the branch.

If something goes wrong, code flow will jump to the label "err:" and leave
the list unreleased.

This patch will release the list of journal_replay(s) in the case of
error detected.

v1 -> v2:
* Move the release code to the location after label 'err:' to
  simply the change.
