drm/i915/gtt: Rename i915_vm_is_48b to i915_vm_is_4lvl

Large ppGTT are differentiated by the requirement to go to four levels
to address more than 32b. Given the introduction of more 4 level ppGTT
with different sizes of addressable bits, rename i915_vm_is_48b() to
better reflect the commonality of using 4 levels.

Based on a patch by Bob Paauwe.
