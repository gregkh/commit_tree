perf/x86/intel: Fix INTEL_FLAGS_EVENT_CONSTRAINT* masking

On Intel Westmere, a cmdline as follows:

  $ perf record -e cpu/event=0xc4,umask=0x2,name=br_inst_retired.near_call/p ....

was failing. Yet the event+ umask support PEBS.

It turns out this is due to a bug in the the PEBS event constraint table for
westmere. All forms of BR_INST_RETIRED.* support PEBS. Therefore the constraint
mask should ignore the umask. The name of the macro INTEL_FLAGS_EVENT_CONSTRAINT()
hint that this is the case but it was not. That macros was checking both the
event code and event umask. Therefore, it was only matching on 0x00c4.
There are code+umask macros, they all have *UEVENT*.

This bug fixes the issue by checking only the event code in the mask.
Both single and range version are modified.
