xfs: fix use after free in buf log item unlock assert

The xfs_buf_log_item ->iop_unlock() callback asserts that the buffer
is unlocked when either non-stale or aborted. This assert occurs
after the bli refcount has been dropped and the log item potentially
freed. The aborted check is thus a potential use after free. This
problem has been reproduced with KASAN enabled via generic/475.

Fix up xfs_buf_item_unlock() to query aborted state before the bli
reference is dropped to prevent a potential use after free.
