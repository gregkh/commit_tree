nfp: flower: support fallback packets from internal ports

FW may receive a packet with its ingress port marked as an internal port.
If a rule does not exist to match on this port, the packet will be sent to
the NFP driver. Modify the flower app to detect packets from such internal
ports and convert the ingress port to the correct kernel space netdev.

At this point, it is assumed that fallback packets from internal ports are
to be sent out said port. Therefore, set the redir_egress bool to true on
detection of these ports.
