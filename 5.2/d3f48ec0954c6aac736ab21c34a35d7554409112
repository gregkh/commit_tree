backlight: lm3630a: Return 0 on success in update_status functions

lm3630a_bank_a_update_status() and lm3630a_bank_b_update_status()
both return the brightness value if the brightness was successfully
updated. Writing to these attributes via sysfs would cause a 'Bad
address' error to be returned. These functions should return 0 on
success, so let's change it to correct that error.
