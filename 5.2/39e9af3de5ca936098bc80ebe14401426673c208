KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Add a TIMA mapping

Each thread has an associated Thread Interrupt Management context
composed of a set of registers. These registers let the thread handle
priority management and interrupt acknowledgment. The most important
are :

    - Interrupt Pending Buffer     (IPB)
    - Current Processor Priority   (CPPR)
    - Notification Source Register (NSR)

They are exposed to software in four different pages each proposing a
view with a different privilege. The first page is for the physical
thread context and the second for the hypervisor. Only the third
(operating system) and the fourth (user level) are exposed the guest.

A custom VM fault handler will populate the VMA with the appropriate
pages, which should only be the OS page for now.
