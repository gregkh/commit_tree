tun: wake up waitqueues after IFF_UP is set

Currently after setting tap0 link up, the tun code wakes tx/rx waited
queues up in tun_net_open() when .ndo_open() is called, however the
IFF_UP flag has not been set yet. If there's already a wait queue, it
would fail to transmit when checking the IFF_UP flag in tun_sendmsg().
Then the saving vhost_poll_start() will add the wq into wqh until it
is waken up again. Although this works when IFF_UP flag has been set
when tun_chr_poll detects; this is not true if IFF_UP flag has not
been set at that time. Sadly the latter case is a fatal error, as
the wq will never be waken up in future unless later manually
setting link up on purpose.

Fix this by moving the wakeup process into the NETDEV_UP event
notifying process, this makes sure IFF_UP has been set before all
waited queues been waken up.
