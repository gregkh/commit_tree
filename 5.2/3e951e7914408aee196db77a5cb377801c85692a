ASoC: Intel: Baytrail: add quirk for Aegex 10 (RU2) tablet

This tablet has an incorrect acpi identifier just like
Thinkpad10 tablet, which is why it is trying to load the RT5640 driver
instead of the RT5762 driver. The RT5640 driver, on the other hand, checks
the hardware ID, so no driver are loaded during boot. This fix resolves to
load the RT5672 driver on this tablet during boot. It also provides the
correct IO configuration, like the jack detect mode 3, for 1.8V pullup. I
would like to thank Pierre-Louis Bossart for helping with this patch.
