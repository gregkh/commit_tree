mlxsw: spectrum: Use different seeds for ECMP and LAG hash

The same hash function and seed are used for both ECMP and LAG hash.
Therefore, when a LAG device is used as a nexthop device as part of an
ECMP group, hash polarization can occur and all the traffic will be
hashed to a single LAG slave.

Fix this by using a different seed for the LAG hash.
