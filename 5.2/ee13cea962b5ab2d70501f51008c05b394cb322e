drm/amd/display: Refactor dp vendor parsing logic to a function

Refactor dp vendor parsing int to a new function, and call it before
get_active_converter_info().

Also, add a flag to skip parsing of Display ID 2.0. Some devices fail on
readind DID2, but we shouldn't fail EDID read because of it. Add this
flag to facilitate the logic.
