brcmfmac: fix leak of mypkt on error return path

Currently if the call to brcmf_sdiod_set_backplane_window fails then
error return path leaks mypkt. Fix this by returning by a new
error path labelled 'out' that calls brcmu_pkt_buf_free_skb to free
mypkt.  Also remove redundant check on err before calling
brcmf_sdiod_skbuff_write.
