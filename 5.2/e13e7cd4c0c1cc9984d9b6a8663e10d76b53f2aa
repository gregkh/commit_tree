powerpc/64s/exception: Fix machine check early corrupting AMR

The early machine check runs in real mode, so locking is unnecessary.
Worse, the windup does not restore AMR, so this can result in a false
KUAP fault after a recoverable machine check hits inside a user copy
operation.

Fix this similarly to HMI by just avoiding the kuap lock in the
early machine check handler (it will be set by the late handler that
runs in virtual mode if that runs). If the virtual mode handler is
reached, it will lock and restore the AMR.
