btrfs: Don't panic when we can't find a root key

When we failed to find a root key in btrfs_update_root(), we just panic.

That's definitely not cool, fix it by outputting an unique error
message, aborting current transaction and return -EUCLEAN. This should
not normally happen as the root has been used by the callers in some
way.
