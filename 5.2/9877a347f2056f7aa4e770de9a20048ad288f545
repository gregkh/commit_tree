spi: tegra114: add dual mode support

This patch adds support for dual mode SPI transfer.

Dual mode uses both MOSI and MISO lines in parallel where the data
is interleaved on MOSI and MISO lines increasing the throughput.

Packet from Tx FIFO is transmitted on both MOSI and MISO lines and
packet to Rx FIFO is received from both MOSI and MISO lines. Even
bits are transmitted or received on the MOSI data line and odd bits
are transmitted or received on the MISO data line.
