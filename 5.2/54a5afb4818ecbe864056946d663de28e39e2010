net: stmmac: socfpga: Use shared System Manager driver

The ARM64 System Manager requires a different method of reading
the System Manager than ARM32. A new System Manager driver was
created to steer ARM32 System Manager calls to regmap_mmio and
ARM64 System Manager calls to the new access method.

Convert from syscon to the shared System Manager driver so that
both ARM64 and ARM32 are supported.
