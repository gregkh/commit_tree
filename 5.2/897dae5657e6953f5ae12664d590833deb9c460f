drm/bridge: ti-tfp410: Report input bus config through bridge timings

The TFP410 supports configurable pixel clock sampling edge and data
de-skew adjustments. The configuration can be set through I2C or
dedicated chip pins.

Report the configuration through the drm_bridge timings. As the
ti-tftp410 driver doesn't support configuring the chip through I2C, we
simply use the default configuration in that case. When the chip is
configured through dedicated pins, we parse the configuration from DT.
