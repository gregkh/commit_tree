s390/qdio: clean up pci_out_supported()

pci_out_supported() currently takes a single queue as parameter, even
though Output IRQ support is a per-device feature. Adjust the parameter,
so that the macro can also be used in code paths with no access to a queue
struct. This allows us to remove the remaining open-coded checks for
QIB_AC_OUTBOUND_PCI_SUPPORTED.
