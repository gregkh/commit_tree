scsi: qla2xxx: Avoid that Coverity complains about dereferencing a NULL rport pointer

Since Coverity cannot know that rport != NULL in qla2xxx_queuecommand() and
since there is code in that function that dereferences the rport pointer,
modify qla2xxx_queuecommand() such that it fails SCSI commands if rport ==
NULL.
