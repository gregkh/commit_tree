drm/i915: Implement split/10bit gamma for ivb/hsw

Reuse the bdw+ code to get split/10bit gamma for
ivb/hsw. The hardware is nearly identical. The
only slight snag is that on ivb/hsw the precision
palette auto increment mode does not work. So we
must increment the index manually. We'll probably
want to stick to the auto increment mode on bdw+
in the name of efficiency.

Also we want to avoid using the CSC for limited range
RGB output as PIPECONF will take care of that on IVB.

v2: Rebase due to EXT_GC_MAX/EXT2_GC_MAX changes
