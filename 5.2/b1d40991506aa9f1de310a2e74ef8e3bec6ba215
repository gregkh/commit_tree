ipv6: Rename fib6_multipath_select and pass fib6_result

Add 'struct fib6_result' to hold the fib entry and fib6_nh from a fib
lookup as separate entries, similar to what IPv4 now has with fib_result.

Rename fib6_multipath_select to fib6_select_path, pass fib6_result to
it, and set f6i and nh in the result once a path selection is done.
Call fib6_select_path unconditionally for path selection which means
moving the sibling and oif check to fib6_select_path. To handle the two
different call paths (2 only call multipath_select if flowi6_oif == 0 and
the other always calls it), add a new have_oif_match that controls the
sibling walk if relevant.

Update callers of fib6_multipath_select accordingly and have them use the
fib6_info and fib6_nh from the result.

This is needed for multipath nexthop objects where a single f6i can
point to multiple fib6_nh (similar to IPv4).
