drm/komeda: Add d71_enum_resources and d71_cleanup

D71 consists of a number of Register Blocks, every Block controls a
specific HW function, every block has a common block_header to represent
its type and pipeline information.

GCU (Global Control Unit) is the first Block which describe the global
information of D71 HW, Like number of block contained and the number of
pipeline supported.

So the d71_enum_resources parsed GCU and create pipeline according
the GCU configuration, and then iterate and detect the blocks that
indicated by the GCU and block_header.

And this change also added two struct d71_dev/d71_pipeline to extend
komeda_dev/komeda_pipeline to add some d71 only members.

v2:
- Return the specific errno not -1.
- Use DRM_DEBUG as default debug msg printer.
