ALSA: hdea/realtek - Headset fixup for System76 Gazelle (gaze14)

On the System76 Gazelle (gaze14), there is a headset microphone input
attached to 0x1a that does not have a jack detect. In order to get it
working, the pin configuration needs to be set correctly, and the
ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE_NO_HP_MIC fixup needs to be applied. This is
identical to the patch already applied for the System76 Darter Pro
(darp5).
