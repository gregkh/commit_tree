gpiolib: acpi: Set pin value, based on bias, more accurately

ACPI GpioIo() resource may have different bias settings.
For now, we distinguish only PullUp() setting in order to configure
the initial state of a pin.

Take into consideration the rest of the possible choices as well,
i.e. PullDown, PullNone and PullDefault, when configuring the initial state
of the pin.
