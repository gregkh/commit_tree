drm/i915/icl: use previous pll hw readout

By the time icl_ddi_clock_get() is called we've just got the hw state
from the pll registers. We don't need to read them again: we can rather
reuse what was cached in the dpll_hw_state.

While at it, s/refclk/ref_clock/ just to be consistent with the name
used in code nearby.
