iwlwifi: pcie: don't crash on invalid RX interrupt

If for some reason the device gives us an RX interrupt before we're
ready for it, perhaps during device power-on with misconfigured IRQ
causes mapping or so, we can crash trying to access the queues.

Prevent that by checking that we actually have RXQs and that they
were properly allocated.
