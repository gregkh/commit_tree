libbpf: fix invalid munmap call

When unmapping the AF_XDP memory regions used for the rings, an
invalid address was passed to the munmap() calls. Instead of passing
the beginning of the memory region, the descriptor region was passed
to munmap.

When the userspace application tried to tear down an AF_XDP socket,
the operation failed and the application would still have a reference
to socket it wished to get rid of.
