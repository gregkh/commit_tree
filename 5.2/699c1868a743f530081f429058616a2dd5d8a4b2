audit: purge unnecessary list_empty calls

The original conditions that led to the use of list_empty() to optimize
list_for_each_entry_rcu() in auditfilter.c and auditsc.c code have been
removed without removing the list_empty() call, but this code example
has been copied several times.  Remove the unnecessary list_empty()
calls.
