ARM: dts: dra76x: Update MMC2_HS200_MANUAL1 iodelay values

Update the MMC2_HS200_MANUAL1 iodelay values to match with the latest
dra76x data manual[1]. The new iodelay values will have better marginality
and should prevent issues in corner cases.

Also this particular pinctrl-array is using spaces instead of tabs for
spacing between the values and the comments. Fix this as well.
