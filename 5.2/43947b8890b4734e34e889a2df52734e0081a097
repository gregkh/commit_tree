ARM: 8853/1: drop WASM to work around LLVM issue

Currently LLVM's integrated assembler does not recognize .w form
of the pld instructions (LLVM Bug 40972 [0]):

  ./arch/arm/include/asm/processor.h:133:5: error: invalid instruction
                          "pldw.wt%a0 n"
                           ^
  <inline asm>:2:1: note: instantiated into assembly here
  pldw.w  [r0]
  ^
  1 error generated.

The W macro for generating wide instructions when targeting Thumb-2
is not strictly required for the preload data instructions (pld, pldw)
since they are only available as wide instructions. The GNU assembler
works with or without the .w appended when compiling an Thumb-2 kernel.

Drop the macro to work around LLVM Bug 40972 issue.
