afs: Log more information for "kAFS: AFS vnode with undefined type\n"

Log more information when "kAFS: AFS vnode with undefined type\n" is
displayed due to a vnode record being retrieved from the server that
appears to have a duff file type (usually 0).  This prints more information
to try and help pin down the problem.
