net: sched: flower: set unlocked flag for flower proto ops

Set TCF_PROTO_OPS_DOIT_UNLOCKED for flower classifier to indicate that its
ops callbacks don't require caller to hold rtnl lock. Don't take rtnl lock
in fl_destroy_filter_work() that is executed on workqueue instead of being
called by cls API and is not affected by setting
TCF_PROTO_OPS_DOIT_UNLOCKED. Rtnl mutex is still manually taken by flower
classifier before calling hardware offloads API that has not been updated
for unlocked execution.
