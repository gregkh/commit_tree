bpf, x64: fix stack layout of JITed bpf code

Since commit 177366bf7ceb the %rbp stopped pointing to %rbp of the
previous stack frame. That broke frame pointer based stack unwinding.
This commit is a partial revert of it.
Note that the location of tail_call_cnt is fixed, since the verifier
enforces MAX_BPF_STACK stack size for programs with tail calls.
