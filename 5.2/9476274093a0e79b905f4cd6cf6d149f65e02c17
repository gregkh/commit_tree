net: lio_core: fix potential sign-extension overflow on large shift

Left shifting the signed int value 1 by 31 bits has undefined behaviour
and the shift amount oq_no can be as much as 63.  Fix this by using
BIT_ULL(oq_no) instead.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Bad shift operation")
Fixes: f21fb3ed364b ("Add support of Cavium Liquidio ethernet adapters")
