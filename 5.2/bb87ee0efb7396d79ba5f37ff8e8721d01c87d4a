ice: Create framework for VSI queue context

This patch introduces a framework to store queue specific information
in VSI queue contexts. Currently VSI queue context (represented by
struct ice_q_ctx) only has q_handle as a member. In future patches,
this structure will be updated to hold queue specific information.
