gpio: pca953x: hack to fix 24 bit gpio expanders

24 bit expanders use REG_ADDR_AI in combination with register addressing. This
conflicts with regmap which takes this bit as part of the register number,
i.e. a second cache entry is defined for accessed with REG_ADDR_AI being
set although on the chip it is the same register as with REG_ADDR_AI being
cleared.

The problem was introduced by

	commit b32cecb46bdc ("gpio: pca953x: Extract the register address mangling to single function")

but only became visible by

	commit 8b9f9d4dc511 ("regmap: verify if register is writeable before writing operations")

because before, the regmap size was effectively ignored and
pca953x_writeable_register() did know to ignore REG_ADDR_AI. Still, there
were two separate cache entries created.

Since the use of REG_ADDR_AI seems to be static we can work around this
issue by simply increasing the size of the regmap to cover the "virtual"
registers with REG_ADDR_AI being set. This only means that half of the
regmap buffer will be unused.
