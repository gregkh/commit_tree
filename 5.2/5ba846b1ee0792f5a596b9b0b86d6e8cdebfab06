dmaengine: idma64: Use actual device for DMA transfers

Intel IOMMU, when enabled, tries to find the domain of the device,
assuming it's a PCI one, during DMA operations, such as mapping or
unmapping. Since we are splitting the actual PCI device to couple of
children via MFD framework (see drivers/mfd/intel-lpss.c for details),
the DMA device appears to be a platform one, and thus not an actual one
that performs DMA. In a such situation IOMMU can't find or allocate
a proper domain for its operations. As a result, all DMA operations are
failed.

In order to fix this, supply parent of the platform device
to the DMA engine framework and fix filter functions accordingly.

We may rely on the fact that parent is a real PCI device, because no
other configuration is present in the wild.
