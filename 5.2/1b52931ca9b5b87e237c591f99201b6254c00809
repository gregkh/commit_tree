ceph: remove duplicated filelock ref increase

Inode i_filelock_ref is increased in ceph_lock or ceph_flock, but it is
increased again in ceph_lock_message. This results in this ref won't
become zero. If CEPH_I_ERROR_FILELOCK flag is set in
remove_session_caps once, this flag can't be cleared even if client is
back to normal. So further file lock will return EIO.
