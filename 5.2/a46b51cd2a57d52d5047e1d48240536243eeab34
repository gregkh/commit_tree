soc/tegra: pmc: Remove reset sysfs entries on error

Commit 5f84bb1a4099 ("soc/tegra: pmc: Add sysfs entries for reset info")
added sysfs entries for Tegra reset source and level. However, these
sysfs are not removed on error and so if the registering of PMC device
is probe deferred, then the next time we attempt to probe the PMC device
warnings such as the following will be displayed on boot ...

  sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/platform/7000e400.pmc/reset_reason'

Fix this by calling device_remove_file() for each sysfs entry added on
failure. Note that we call device_remove_file() unconditionally without
checking if the sysfs entry was created in the first place, but this
should be OK because kernfs_remove_by_name_ns() will fail silently.
