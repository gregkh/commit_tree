drm: msm: Switch to use drm_gem_object reservation_object

Now that the base struct drm_gem_object has a reservation_object, use it
and remove the private BO one.

We can't use the drm_gem_reservation_object_wait() helper for MSM
because (in theory) msm_gem_cpu_prep() will also do some cache
maintenance on the GEM object.
