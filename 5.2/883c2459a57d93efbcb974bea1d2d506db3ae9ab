habanalabs: re-factor goya_parse_cb_no_ext_queue()

This patch re-factors goya_parse_cb_no_ext_queue() to make it more
readable by inverting the check inside the first if statement so the bulk
of the function won't be inside an if statement.

The patch also fixes a spelling error in the name of the function.
