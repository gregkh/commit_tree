ARM: OMAP2+: sleep43xx: Run EMIF HW leveling on resume path

When returning from DeepSleep mode on AM437x platforms the EMIF must run
DDR hardware leveling, same as done during u-boot, to properly restore the
EMIF PHY to it's operational state on platforms using DDR3.

Call the ti-emif-sram-pm run_hw_leveling routine to perform this. This
happens after all other EMIF values are restored so the exact same
configuration used at boot is used at the end of EMIF resume as well.
