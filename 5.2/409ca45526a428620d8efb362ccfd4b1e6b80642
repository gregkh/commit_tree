x86/kconfig: Disable CONFIG_GENERIC_HWEIGHT and remove __HAVE_ARCH_SW_HWEIGHT

Remove an unnecessary arch complication:

arch/x86/include/asm/arch_hweight.h uses __sw_hweight{32,64} as
alternatives, and they are implemented in arch/x86/lib/hweight.S

x86 does not rely on the generic C implementation lib/hweight.c
at all, so CONFIG_GENERIC_HWEIGHT should be disabled.

__HAVE_ARCH_SW_HWEIGHT is not necessary either.

No change in functionality intended.
