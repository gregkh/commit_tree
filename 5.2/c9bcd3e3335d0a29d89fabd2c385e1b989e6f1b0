kvm: svm/avic: fix off-by-one in checking host APIC ID

Current logic does not allow VCPU to be loaded onto CPU with
APIC ID 255. This should be allowed since the host physical APIC ID
field in the AVIC Physical APIC table entry is an 8-bit value,
and APIC ID 255 is valid in system with x2APIC enabled.
Instead, do not allow VCPU load if the host APIC ID cannot be
represented by an 8-bit value.

Also, use the more appropriate AVIC_PHYSICAL_ID_ENTRY_HOST_PHYSICAL_ID_MASK
instead of AVIC_MAX_PHYSICAL_ID_COUNT.
