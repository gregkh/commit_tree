RDMA/uverbs: Initialize udata struct on destroy flows

Cited commit introduced the udata parameter to different destroy flows
but the uapi method definition does not have udata (i.e has_udata flag
is not set). As a result, an uninitialized udata struct is being passed
down to the driver callbacks.

Fix that by clearing the driver udata even in cases where has_udata flag
is not set.
