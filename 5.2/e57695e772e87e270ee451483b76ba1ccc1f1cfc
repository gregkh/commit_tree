docs: hwmon: convert three docs to ReST format

Those three new drivers were missed on the initial conversion
to ReST format. So:

- Rename them to .rst;
- Add them to the hwmon index.rst index;
- add some blank lines at the "Supported systems:" part, in
  order to allow Sphinx to properly identify new lines,
  suppressing warnings and avoid it to output some random
  lines in bold;
- When multiple authors are involved, change the authors
  part to a list, in order to avoid adding blank lines.
- adjust the table cells (one of the tables seemed to be
  assuming that tab is 4 positions instead of 8) and add
  the table markup.
- be sure that the section markups have the same number of
  characters as the section title.
