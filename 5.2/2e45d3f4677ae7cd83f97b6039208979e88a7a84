i40e: Add support for X710 B/P & SFP+ cards

New device ids are created to support X710 backplane and SFP+ cards.

This patch adds in i40e driver support for 2.5GbaseT and 5GbaseT speed.
It's implemented by checking I40E_CAP_PHY_TYPE_2_5GBASE_T,
I40E_CAP_PHY_TYPE_5GBASE_T bits from f/w and setting corresponding bits
in ethtool link ksettings supported and advertising masks.
