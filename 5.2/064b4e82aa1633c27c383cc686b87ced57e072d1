perf tools: Add a 'percore' event qualifier

Add a 'percore' event qualifier, like cpu/event=0,umask=0x3,percore=1/,
that sums up the event counts for both hardware threads in a core.

We can already do this with --per-core, but it's often useful to do
this together with other metrics that are collected per hardware thread.
So we need to support this per-core counting on a event level.

This can be implemented in only the user tool, no kernel support needed.

 v4:
 ---
 1. Add Arnaldo's patch which updates the documentation for
    this new qualifier.
 2. Rebase to latest perf/core branch

 v3:
 ---
 Simplify the code according to Jiri's comments.
 Before:
   "return term->val.percore ? true : false;"
 Now:
   "return term->val.percore;"

 v2:
 ---
 Change the qualifier name from 'coresum' to 'percore' according to
 comments from Jiri and Andi.
