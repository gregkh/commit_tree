ARM: dts: sun4i: lime: Fix the USB PHY ID detect GPIO properties

While the USB PHY Device Tree mandates that the name of the ID detect pin
should be usb0_id_det-gpios, a significant number of device tree use
usb0_id_det-gpio instead.

This was functional because the GPIO framework falls back to the gpio
suffix that is legacy, but we should fix this. Commit 2c515b0d05a9
("ARM: sunxi: Fix the USB PHY ID detect GPIO properties") was supposed to
fix this, but one fell through the cracks.
