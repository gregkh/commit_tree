drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Add quirk for GPD pocket2

GPD has done it again, make a nice device (good), use way too generic
DMI strings (bad) and use a portrait screen rotated 90 degrees (ugly).

Because of the too generic DMI strings this entry is also doing bios-date
matching, so the gpd_pocket2 data struct may very well need to be updated
with some extra bios-dates in the future.

Changes in v2:
-Add one more known BIOS date to the list of BIOS dates
