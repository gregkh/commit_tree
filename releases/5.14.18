    rsi: fix control-message timeout
    
    commit 541fd20c3ce5b0bc39f0c6a52414b6b92416831c upstream.
    
    USB control-message timeouts are specified in milliseconds and should
    specifically not vary with CONFIG_HZ.
    
    Use the common control-message timeout define for the five-second
    timeout.

    media: staging/intel-ipu3: css: Fix wrong size comparison imgu_css_fw_init
    
    commit a44f9d6f9dc1fb314a3f1ed2dcd4fbbcc3d9f892 upstream.
    
    There is a wrong comparison of the total size of the loaded firmware
    css->fw->size with the size of a pointer to struct imgu_fw_header.
    
    Turn binary_header into a flexible-array member[1][2], use the
    struct_size() helper and fix the wrong size comparison. Notice
    that the loaded firmware needs to contain at least one 'struct
    imgu_fw_info' item in the binary_header[] array.
    
    It's also worth mentioning that
    
            "css->fw->size < struct_size(css->fwp, binary_header, 1)"
    
    with binary_header declared as a flexible-array member is equivalent
    to
    
            "css->fw->size < sizeof(struct imgu_fw_header)"
    
    with binary_header declared as a one-element array (as in the original
    code).
    
    The replacement of the one-element array with a flexible-array member
    also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    comedi: vmk80xx: fix bulk and interrupt message timeouts
    
    commit a56d3e40bda460edf3f8d6aac00ec0b322b4ab83 upstream.
    
    USB bulk and interrupt message timeouts are specified in milliseconds
    and should specifically not vary with CONFIG_HZ.
    
    Note that the bulk-out transfer timeout was set to the endpoint
    bInterval value, which should be ignored for bulk endpoints and is
    typically set to zero. This meant that a failing bulk-out transfer
    would never time out.
    
    Assume that the 10 second timeout used for all other transfers is more
    than enough also for the bulk-out endpoint.

    commit a23461c47482fc232ffc9b819539d1f837adf2b1 upstream.
    
    The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until
    recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.
    
    Commit e1f13c879a7c ("staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize
    of usb endpoints found") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences
    when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a
    zero wMaxPacketSize.
    
    Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other
    accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in
    vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond
    the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.
    
    The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.
    Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is
    presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.

    staging: rtl8712: fix use-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw
    
    commit c052cc1a069c3e575619cf64ec427eb41176ca70 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported use-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw(). The problem was in
    race condition between r871xu_dev_remove() ->ndo_open() callback.
    
    It's easy to see from crash log, that driver accesses released firmware
    in ->ndo_open() callback. It may happen, since driver was releasing
    firmware _before_ unregistering netdev. Fix it by moving
    unregister_netdev() before cleaning up resources.

    binder: don't detect sender/target during buffer cleanup
    
    commit 32e9f56a96d8d0f23cb2aeb2a3cd18d40393e787 upstream.
    
    When freeing txn buffers, binder_transaction_buffer_release()
    attempts to detect whether the current context is the target by
    comparing current->group_leader to proc->tsk. This is an unreliable
    test. Instead explicitly pass an 'is_failure' boolean.
    
    Detecting the sender was being used as a way to tell if the
    transaction failed to be sent.  When cleaning up after
    failing to send a transaction, there is no need to close
    the fds associated with a BINDER_TYPE_FDA object. Now
    'is_failure' can be used to accurately detect this case.

    binder: use cred instead of task for selinux checks
    
    commit 52f88693378a58094c538662ba652aff0253c4fe upstream.
    
    Since binder was integrated with selinux, it has passed
    'struct task_struct' associated with the binder_proc
    to represent the source and target of transactions.
    The conversion of task to SID was then done in the hook
    implementations. It turns out that there are race conditions
    which can result in an incorrect security context being used.
    
    Fix by using the 'struct cred' saved during binder_open and pass
    it to the selinux subsystem.

    usb-storage: Add compatibility quirk flags for iODD 2531/2541
    
    commit 05c8f1b67e67dcd786ae3fe44492bbc617b4bd12 upstream.
    
    These drive enclosures have firmware bugs that make it impossible to mount
    a new virtual ISO image after Linux ejects the old one if the device is
    locked by Linux. Windows bypasses this problem by the fact that they do
    not lock the device. Add a quirk to disable device locking for these
    drive enclosures.

    usb: musb: Balance list entry in musb_gadget_queue
    
    commit 21b5fcdccb32ff09b6b63d4a83c037150665a83f upstream.
    
    musb_gadget_queue() adds the passed request to musb_ep::req_list. If the
    endpoint is idle and it is the first request then it invokes
    musb_queue_resume_work(). If the function returns an error then the
    error is passed to the caller without any clean-up and the request
    remains enqueued on the list. If the caller enqueues the request again
    then the list corrupts.
    
    Remove the request from the list on error.

    commit 1e254d0d86a0f2efd4190a89d5204b37c18c6381 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 76b4f357d0e7d8f6f0013c733e6cba1773c266d3.
    
    The commit has the wrong reasoning, as KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID is not defining the
    maximum allowed vcpu-id as its name suggests, but the number of vcpu-ids.
    So revert this patch again.

    ALSA: pci: cs46xx: Fix set up buffer type properly
    
    commit 4d9e9153f1c64d91a125c6967bc0bfb0bb653ea0 upstream.
    
    CS46xx driver switches the buffer depending on the number of periods,
    and in some cases it switches to the own buffer without updating the
    buffer type properly.  This may cause a problem with the mmap on
    exotic architectures that require the own mmap call for the coherent
    DMA buffer.
    
    This patch addresses the potential breakage by replacing the buffer
    setup with the proper macro.  It also simplifies the source code,
    too.

    ALSA: pcm: Check mmap capability of runtime dma buffer at first
    
    commit cbea6e5a7772b7a5b80baa8f98fd77853487fd2a upstream.
    
    Currently we check only the substream->dma_buffer as the preset of the
    buffer configuration for verifying the availability of mmap.  But a
    few drivers rather set up the buffer in the own way without the
    standard buffer preallocation using substream->dma_buffer, and they
    miss the proper checks.  (Now it's working more or less fine as most
    of them are running only on x86).
    
    Actually, they may set up the runtime dma_buffer (referred via
    snd_pcm_get_dma_buf()) at the open callback, though.  That is, this
    could have been used as the primary source.
    
    This patch changes the hw_support_mmap() function to check the runtime
    dma buffer at first.  It's usually NULL with the standard buffer
    preallocation, and in that case, we continue checking
    substream->dma_buffer as fallback.
