    memfd: Use radix_tree_deref_slot_protected to avoid the warning.
    
    The commit 99b45e7a1ba1 ("memfd: Fix locking when tagging pins")
    introduces the following warning messages.
    
    *WARNING: suspicious RCU usage in memfd_wait_for_pins*
    
    It is because we still use radix_tree_deref_slot without read_rcu_lock.
    We should use radix_tree_deref_slot_protected instead in the case.

    [ Upstream commit 9b97123a584f60a5bca5a2663485768a1f6cd0a4 ]
    
    The newly added runtime-pm support causes a harmless warning
    when CONFIG_PM is disabled:

     static int unimac_mdio_suspend(struct device *d)
    
    Marking the functions as __maybe_unused is the easiest workaround
    and avoids adding #ifdef checks.

    s390/vdso: correct vdso mapping for compat tasks
    
    [ Upstream commit 190f056fba230abee80712eb810939ef9a8c462f ]
    
    While "s390/vdso: avoid 64-bit vdso mapping for compat tasks" fixed
    64-bit vdso mapping for compat tasks under gdb it introduced another
    problem. "compat_mm" flag is not inherited during fork and when
    31-bit process forks a child (but does not perform exec) it ends up
    with 64-bit vdso. To address that, init_new_context (which is called
    during fork and exec) now initialize compat_mm based on thread TIF_31BIT
    flag. Later compat_mm is adjusted in arch_setup_additional_pages, which
    is called during exec.

    netfilter: masquerade: don't flush all conntracks if only one address deleted on device
    
    [ Upstream commit 097f95d319f817e651bd51f8846aced92a55a6a1 ]
    
    We configured iptables as below, which only allowed incoming data on
    established connections:
    
    iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t mangle -P PREROUTING DROP
    
    When deleting a secondary address, current masquerade implements would
    flush all conntracks on this device. All the established connections on
    primary address also be deleted, then subsequent incoming data on the
    connections would be dropped wrongly because it was identified as NEW
    connection.
    
    So when an address was delete, it should only flush connections related
    with the address.

    When it is detected, the right thing to do is to drop all connected and

    [ Upstream commit 7ef55f6744c45e3d7c85a3f74ada39b67ac741dd ]
    
    The X3T9.2 specification (draft) says, under "6.1.4.1 RESELECTION", that "the
    initiator shall not respond to a RESELECTION phase if other than two SCSI ID
    bits are on the DATA BUS." This issue (too many bits set) has been observed in
    the wild, so add a check.

    iwlwifi: dbg: don't crash if the firmware crashes in the middle of a debug dump
    
    [ Upstream commit 79f25b10c9da3dbc953e47033d0494e51580ac3b ]
    
    We can dump data from the firmware either when it crashes,
    or when the firmware is alive.
    Not all the data is available if the firmware is running
    (like the Tx / Rx FIFOs which are available only when the
    firmware is halted), so we first check that the firmware
    is alive to compute the required size for the dump and then
    fill the buffer with the data.
    
    When we allocate the buffer, we test the STATUS_FW_ERROR
    bit to check if the firmware is alive or not. This bit
    can be changed during the course of the dump since it is
    modified in the interrupt handler.
    
    We hit a case where we allocate the buffer while the
    firmware is sill working, and while we start to fill the
    buffer, the firmware crashes. Then we test STATUS_FW_ERROR
    again and decide to fill the buffer with data like the
    FIFOs even if no room was allocated for this data in the
    buffer. This means that we overflow the buffer that was
    allocated leading to memory corruption.
    
    To fix this, test the STATUS_FW_ERROR bit only once and
    rely on local variables to check if we should dump fifos
    or other firmware components.

    firmware: dell_rbu: Make payload memory uncachable
    
    [ Upstream commit 6aecee6ad41cf97c0270f72da032c10eef025bf0 ]
    
    The dell_rbu driver takes firmware update payloads and puts them in memory so
    the system BIOS can find them after a reboot.  This sometimes fails (though
    rarely), because the memory containing the payload is in the CPU cache but
    never gets written back to main memory before the system is rebooted (CPU
    cache contents are lost on reboot).
    
    With this patch, the payload memory will be changed to uncachable to ensure
    that the payload is actually in main memory before the system is rebooted.

    EDAC: Raise the maximum number of memory controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b58859419554fb824e09cfdd73151a195473cbc ]
    
    We observe an oops in the skx_edac module during boot:
    
      EDAC MC0: Giving out device to module skx_edac controller Skylake Socket#0 IMC#0
      EDAC MC1: Giving out device to module skx_edac controller Skylake Socket#0 IMC#1
      EDAC MC2: Giving out device to module skx_edac controller Skylake Socket#1 IMC#0
      ...
      EDAC MC13: Giving out device to module skx_edac controller Skylake Socket#0 IMC#1
      EDAC MC14: Giving out device to module skx_edac controller Skylake Socket#1 IMC#0
      EDAC MC15: Giving out device to module skx_edac controller Skylake Socket#1 IMC#1
      Too many memory controllers: 16
      EDAC MC: Removed device 0 for skx_edac Skylake Socket#0 IMC#0
    
    We observe there are two memory controllers per socket, with a limit
    of 16. Raise the maximum number of memory controllers from 16 to 2 *
    MAX_NUMNODES (1024).
    
    [ bp: This is just a band-aid fix until we've sorted out the whole issue
      with the bus_type association and handling in EDAC and can get rid of
      this arbitrary limit. ]

    RDMA: Fix dependencies for rdma_user_mmap_io
    
    [ Upstream commit 46bdf777685677c1cc6b3da9220aace9da690731 ]
    
    The mlx4 driver produces a link error when it is configured
    as built-in while CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_ACCESS is set to =m:
    
    drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/main.o: In function `mlx4_ib_mmap':
    main.c:(.text+0x1af4): undefined reference to `rdma_user_mmap_io'
    
    The same function is called from mlx5, which already has a
    dependency to ensure we can call it, and from hns, which
    appears to suffer from the same problem.
    
    This adds the same dependency that mlx5 uses to the other two.

    f2fs: fix to recover inode's project id during POR
    
    [ Upstream commit f4474aa6e5e901ee4af21f39f1b9115aaaaec503 ]
    
    Testcase to reproduce this bug:
    1. mkfs.f2fs -O extra_attr -O project_quota /dev/sdd
    2. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
    3. touch /mnt/f2fs/file
    4. sync
    5. chattr -p 1 /mnt/f2fs/file
    6. xfs_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "fsync"
    7. godown /mnt/f2fs
    8. umount /mnt/f2fs
    9. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
    10. lsattr -p /mnt/f2fs/file
    
        0 -----------------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
    
    But actually, we expect the correct result is:
    
        1 -----------------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
    
    The reason is we didn't recover inode.i_projid field during mount,
    fix it.

    PCI/ERR: Run error recovery callbacks for all affected devices
    
    [ Upstream commit bfcb79fca19d267712e425af1dd48812c40dec0c ]
    
    If an Endpoint reported an error with ERR_FATAL, we previously ran driver
    error recovery callbacks only for the Endpoint's driver.  But if we reset a
    Link to recover from the error, all downstream components are affected,
    including the Endpoint, any multi-function peers, and children of those
    peers.
    
    Initiate the Link reset from the deepest Downstream Port that is
    reliable, and call the error recovery callbacks for all its children.
    
    If a Downstream Port (including a Root Port) reports an error, we assume
    the Port itself is reliable and we need to reset its downstream Link.  In
    all other cases (Switch Upstream Ports, Endpoints, Bridges, etc), we assume
    the Link leading to the component needs to be reset, so we initiate the
    reset at the parent Downstream Port.
    
    This allows two other clean-ups.  First, we currently only use a Link
    reset, which can only be initiated using a Downstream Port, so we can
    remove checks for Endpoints.  Second, the Downstream Port where we initiate
    the Link reset is reliable (unlike components downstream from it), so the
    special cases for error detect and resume are no longer necessary.

    And although if the sas address is not changed, we always have to unregister
    the old device when we are going to register a new one. We cannot just leave

    vfio/pci: Mask buggy SR-IOV VF INTx support
    
    [ Upstream commit db04264fe9bc0f2b62e036629f9afb530324b693 ]
    
    The SR-IOV spec requires that VFs must report zero for the INTx pin
    register as VFs are precluded from INTx support.  It's much easier for
    the host kernel to understand whether a device is a VF and therefore
    whether a non-zero pin register value is bogus than it is to do the
    same in userspace.  Override the INTx count for such devices and
    virtualize the pin register to provide a consistent view of the device
    to the user.
    
    As this is clearly a spec violation, warn about it to support hardware
    validation, but also provide a known whitelist as it doesn't do much
    good to continue complaining if the hardware vendor doesn't plan to
    fix it.

    coresight: dynamic-replicator: Handle multiple connections
    
    [ Upstream commit 30af4fb619e5126cb3152072e687b377fc9398d6 ]
    
    When a replicator port is enabled, we block the traffic
    on the other port and route all traffic to the new enabled
    port. If there are two active trace sessions each targeting
    the two different paths from the replicator, the second session
    will disable the first session and route all the data to the
    second path.
                        ETR
                     /
    e.g, replicator
                     \
                        ETB
    
    If CPU0 is operated in sysfs mode to ETR and CPU1 is operated
    in perf mode to ETB, depending on the order in which the
    replicator is enabled one device is blocked.
    
    Ideally we need trace-id for the session to make the
    right choice. That implies we need a trace-id allocation
    logic for the coresight subsystem and use that to route
    the traffic. The short term solution is to only manage
    the "target port" and leave the other port untouched.
    That leaves both the paths unaffected, except that some
    unwanted traffic may be pushed to the paths (if the Trace-IDs
    are not far enough), which is still fine and can be filtered
    out while processing rather than silently blocking the data.

    coresight: tmc: Fix byte-address alignment for RRP
    
    [ Upstream commit e7753f3937610633a540f2be81be87531f96ff04 ]
    
    >From the comment in the code, it claims the requirement for byte-address
    alignment for RRP register: 'for 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit wide trace
    memory, the four LSBs must be 0s. For 256-bit wide trace memory, the
    five LSBs must be 0s'.  This isn't consistent with the program, the
    program sets five LSBs as zeros for 32/64/128-bit wide trace memory and
    set six LSBs zeros for 256-bit wide trace memory.
    
    After checking with the CoreSight Trace Memory Controller technical
    reference manual (ARM DDI 0461B, section 3.3.4 RAM Read Pointer
    Register), it proves the comment is right and the program does wrong
    setting.
    
    This patch fixes byte-address alignment for RRP by following correct
    definition in the technical reference manual.

    [ Upstream commit b860801e3237ec4c74cf8de0be4816996757ae5c ]
    
    For non-VHE systems host kernel runs at EL1 and jumps to EL2 whenever
    hypervisor code should be executed. In this case ETM4x driver must
    restrict configuration to EL1 when it setups kernel tracing.
    However, there is no separate hypervisor privilege level when VHE
    is enabled, the host kernel runs at EL2.
    
    This patch fixes configuration of TRCACATRn register for VHE systems
    so that ETM_EXLEVEL_NS_HYP bit is used instead of ETM_EXLEVEL_NS_OS
    to on/off kernel tracing. At the same time, it moves common code
    to new helper.

    coresight: tmc-etr: Handle driver mode specific ETR buffers
    
    [ Upstream commit 96a7f644006ecc05eaaa1a5d09373d0ee63beb0a ]
    
    Since the ETR could be driven either by SYSFS or by perf, it
    becomes complicated how we deal with the buffers used for each
    of these modes. The ETR driver cannot simply free the current
    attached buffer without knowing the provider (i.e, sysfs vs perf).
    
    To solve this issue, we provide:
    1) the driver-mode specific etr buffer to be retained in the drvdata
    2) the etr_buf for a session should be passed on when enabling the
       hardware, which will be stored in drvdata->etr_buf. This will be
       replaced (not free'd) as soon as the hardware is disabled, after
       necessary sync operation.
    
    The advantages of this are :
    
    1) The common code path doesn't need to worry about how to dispose
       an existing buffer, if it is about to start a new session with a
       different buffer, possibly in a different mode.
    2) The driver mode can control its buffers and can get access to the
       saved session even when the hardware is operating in a different
       mode. (e.g, we can still access a trace buffer from a sysfs mode
       even if the etr is now used in perf mode, without disrupting the
       current session.)
    
    Towards this, we introduce a sysfs specific data which will hold the
    etr_buf used for sysfs mode of operation, controlled solely by the
    sysfs mode handling code.

    coresight: perf: Fix per cpu path management
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ecabe4a76e8cdb61fa3e24862d9ca240a1c4ddf ]
    
    We create a coresight trace path for each online CPU when
    we start the event. We rely on the number of online CPUs
    and then go on to allocate an array matching the "number of
    online CPUs" for holding the path and then uses normal
    CPU id as the index to the array. This is problematic as
    we could have some offline CPUs causing us to access beyond
    the actual array size (e.g, on a dual SMP system, if CPU0 is
    offline, CPU1 could be really accessing beyond the array).
    The solution is to switch to per-cpu array for holding the path.

    coresight: Fix handling of sinks
    
    [ Upstream commit c71369de02b285d9da526a526d8f2affc7b17c59 ]
    
    The coresight components could be operated either in sysfs mode or in perf
    mode. For some of the components, the mode of operation doesn't matter as
    they simply relay the data to the next component in the trace path. But for
    sinks, they need to be able to provide the trace data back to the user.
    Thus we need to make sure that "mode" is handled appropriately. e.g,
    the sysfs mode could have multiple sources driving the trace data, while
    perf mode doesn't allow sharing the sink.
    
    The coresight_enable_sink() however doesn't really allow this check to
    trigger as it skips the "enable_sink" callback if the component is
    already enabled, irrespective of the mode. This could cause mixing
    of data from different modes or even same mode (in perf), if the
    sources are different. Also, if we fail to enable the sink while
    enabling a path (where sink is the first component enabled),
    we could end up in disabling the components in the "entire"
    path which were not enabled in this trial, causing disruptions
    in the existing trace paths.

    [ Upstream commit 8dbf9c7abefd5c1434a956d5c6b25e11183061a3 ]
    
    When USB requests for video data fail to be submitted, the driver
    signals a problem to the host by halting the video streaming endpoint.
    This is only valid in bulk mode, as isochronous transfers have no
    handshake phase and can't thus report a stall. The usb_ep_set_halt()
    call returns an error when using isochronous endpoints, which we happily
    ignore, but some UDCs complain in the kernel log. Fix this by only
    trying to halt the endpoint in bulk mode.

    Practically this happens when the device is woken up from suspend by
    plugging in usb.

    This patch fixes and issue that the vbus_ctrl is disabled by
    rcar_gen3_init_from_a_peri_to_a_host(), so a usb host cannot
    supply the vbus.
    
    Note that this condition will exit when the otg irq happens

    There is an issue where the host is unable to tell the gadget what frame

    ARM: dts: rockchip: explicitly set vcc_sd0 pin to gpio on rk3188-radxarock
    
    [ Upstream commit a2df0984e73fd9e1dad5fc3f1c307ec3de395e30 ]
    
    It is good practice to make the setting of gpio-pinctrls explicitly in the
    devicetree, and in this case even necessary.
    Rockchip boards start with iomux settings set to gpio for most pins and
    while the linux pinctrl driver also implicitly sets the gpio function if
    a pin is requested as gpio that is not necessarily true for other drivers.
    
    The issue in question stems from uboot, where the sdmmc_pwr pin is set
    to function 1 (sdmmc-power) by the bootrom when reading the 1st-stage
    loader. The regulator controlled by the pin is active-low though, so
    when the dwmmc hw-block sets its enabled bit, it actually disables the
    regulator. By changing the pin back to gpio we fix that behaviour.

    I spent some more time digging in this time, and think I have a better
    fix, bailing out of the function that either initializes or errors
    out here, which simplifies the code enough for gcc to figure out
    what is going on. The earlier partial workaround can be removed now,
    as the new workaround is better.

    mlxsw: Make MLXSW_SP1_FWREV_MINOR a hard requirement
    
    [ Upstream commit 12ba7e1045521ec9f251c93ae0a6735cc3f42337 ]
    
    Up until now, mlxsw tolerated firmware versions that weren't exactly
    matching the required version, if the branch number matched. That
    allowed the users to test various firmware versions as long as they were
    on the right branch.
    
    On the other hand, it made it impossible for mlxsw to put a hard lower
    bound on a version that fixes all problems known to date. If a user had
    a somewhat older FW version installed, mlxsw would start up just fine,
    possibly performing non-optimally as it would use features that trigger
    problematic behavior.
    
    Therefore tweak the check to accept any FW version that is:
    
    - on the same branch as the preferred version, and
    - the same as or newer than the preferred version.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix microSD in rk3399 sapphire board
    
    [ Upstream commit 88a20edf76091ee7f1bb459b89d714d53f0f8940 ]
    
    The microSD card slot in the Sapphire board is not working because of
    several issues:
     1.- The vmmc power supply is missing in the DTS. It is capable of 3.0V
     and has a GPIO-based enable control.
     2.- The vqmmc power supply can provide up to 3.3V, but it is capped in
     the DTS to just 3.0V because of the vmmc capability. This results in a
     conflict from the mmc driver requesting an unsupportable voltage range
     from 3.3V to 3.0V (min > max) as reported in dmesg. So, extend the
     range up to 3.3V. The hw should be able to stand this 0.3V tolerance.
     See mmc_regulator_set_vqmmc in drivers/mmc/core/core.c.
     3.- The card detect signal is non-working. There is a known conflict
     with jtag, but the workaround in drivers/soc/rockchip/grf.c does not
     work. Adding the broken-cd attribute to the DTS fixes the issue.

    x86/CPU: Change query logic so CPUID is enabled before testing
    
    [ Upstream commit 2893cc8ff892fa74972d8dc0e1d0dc65116daaa3 ]
    
    Presently we check first if CPUID is enabled. If it is not already
    enabled, then we next call identify_cpu_without_cpuid() and clear
    X86_FEATURE_CPUID.
    
    Unfortunately, identify_cpu_without_cpuid() is the function where CPUID
    becomes _enabled_ on Cyrix 6x86/6x86L CPUs.
    
    Reverse the calling sequence so that CPUID is first enabled, and then
    check a second time to see if the feature has now been activated.

    x86/CPU: Use correct macros for Cyrix calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 03b099bdcdf7125d4a63dc9ddeefdd454e05123d ]
    
    There are comments in processor-cyrix.h advising you to _not_ make calls
    using the deprecated macros in this style:
    
      setCx86_old(CX86_CCR4, getCx86_old(CX86_CCR4) | 0x80);
    
    This is because it expands the macro into a non-functioning calling
    sequence. The calling order must be:
    
      outb(CX86_CCR2, 0x22);
      inb(0x23);
    
    From the comments:
    
     * When using the old macros a line like
     *   setCx86(CX86_CCR2, getCx86(CX86_CCR2) | 0x88);
     * gets expanded to:
     *  do {
     *    outb((CX86_CCR2), 0x22);
     *    outb((({
     *        outb((CX86_CCR2), 0x22);
     *        inb(0x23);
     *    }) | 0x88), 0x23);
     *  } while (0);
    
    The new macros fix this problem, so use them instead.

    following commit:
    commit d58e468b1112 ("flow_dissector: implements flow dissector BPF hook")
    added struct bpf_flow_keys which conflicts with the struct with

    similar to commit:
    commit 534e0e52bc23 ("samples/bpf: fix a compilation failure")
    we tried the rename it "flow_keys" but it also conflicted with struct
    having same name in include/net/flow_dissector.h. Hence renaming the
    struct to "flow_key_record". Also, this commit doesn't fix the
    compilation error completely because the similar struct is present in
    sockex3_kern.c. Hence renaming it in both files sockex3_user.c and
    sockex3_kern.c

    PCI/AER: Don't read upstream ports below fatal errors
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d938ea53b265ed6df6cdd1715d971f0235fdbfc ]
    
    The AER driver has never read the config space of an endpoint that reported
    a fatal error because the link to that device is considered unreliable.
    
    An ERR_FATAL from an upstream port almost certainly indicates an error on
    its upstream link, so we can't expect to reliably read its config space for
    the same reason.

    crypto: chacha20 - Fix chacha20_block() keystream alignment (again)
    
    [ Upstream commit a5e9f557098e54af44ade5d501379be18435bfbf ]
    
    In commit 9f480faec58c ("crypto: chacha20 - Fix keystream alignment for
    chacha20_block()"), I had missed that chacha20_block() can be called
    directly on the buffer passed to get_random_bytes(), which can have any
    alignment.  So, while my commit didn't break anything, it didn't fully
    solve the alignment problems.
    
    Revert my solution and just update chacha20_block() to use
    put_unaligned_le32(), so the output buffer need not be aligned.
    This is simpler, and on many CPUs it's the same speed.
    
    But, I kept the 'tmp' buffers in extract_crng_user() and
    _get_random_bytes() 4-byte aligned, since that alignment is actually
    needed for _crng_backtrack_protect() too.

    6. godown /mnt;
    7. umount /mnt;
    8. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt;
    
    After step 8) we will expect file's uid/gid are all system, but during
    recovery, these two fields were not been recovered, fix it.

    PCI: portdrv: Initialize service drivers directly
    
    [ Upstream commit c29de84149aba5f74e87b6491c13ac7203c12f55 ]
    
    The PCI port driver saves the PCI state after initializing the device with
    the applicable service devices.  This was, however, before the service
    drivers were even registered because PCI probe happens before the
    device_initcall initialized those service drivers.  The config space state
    that the services set up were not being saved.  The end result would cause
    PCI devices to not react to events that the drivers think they did if the
    PCI state ever needed to be restored.
    
    Fix this by changing the service drivers from using the init calls to
    having the portdrv driver calling the services directly.  This will get the
    state saved as desired, while making the relationship between the port
    driver and the services under it more explicit in the code.

    mlxsw: spectrum: Init shaper for TCs 8..15
    
    [ Upstream commit a9f36656b519a9a21309793c306941a3cd0eeb8f ]
    
    With introduction of MC-aware mode to mlxsw, it became necessary to
    configure TCs above 7 as well. There is now code in mlxsw to disable ETS
    for these higher classes, but disablement of max shaper was neglected.
    
    By default, max shaper is currently disabled to begin with, so the
    problem is just cosmetic. However, for symmetry, do like we do for ETS
    configuration, and call mlxsw_sp_port_ets_maxrate_set() for both TC i
    and i + 8.

    brcmsmac: Use kvmalloc() for ucode allocations
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c3efbe77bc78bf49db851aec7f385be475afca6 ]
    
    The ucode chunk might be relatively large and the allocation with
    kmalloc() may fail occasionally.  Since the data isn't DMA-transferred
    but by manual loops, we can use vmalloc instead of kmalloc.
    For a better performance, though, kvmalloc() would be the best choice
    in such a case, so let's replace with it.

    s390/vdso: avoid 64-bit vdso mapping for compat tasks
    
    [ Upstream commit d1befa65823e9c6d013883b8a41d081ec338c489 ]
    
    vdso_fault used is_compat_task function (on s390 it tests "current"
    thread_info flags) to distinguish compat tasks and map 31-bit vdso
    pages. But "current" task might not correspond to mm context.
    
    When 31-bit compat inferior is executed under gdb, gdb does
    PTRACE_PEEKTEXT on vdso page, causing vdso_fault with "current" being
    64-bit gdb process. So, 31-bit inferior ends up with 64-bit vdso mapped.
    
    To avoid this problem a new compat_mm flag has been introduced into
    mm context. This flag is used in vdso_fault and vdso_mremap instead
    of is_compat_task.

    [ Upstream commit 1c472d46283263497adccd7a0bec64ee2f9c09e5 ]
    
    The AP bus scan is aborted before doing anything worth mentioning if
    ap_select_domain() fails, e.g. if the ap_rights.aqm mask is all zeros.
    As the result of this the ap bus fails to manage (e.g. create and
    register) devices like it is supposed to.
    
    Let us make ap_scan_bus() work even if ap_select_domain() can't select a
    default domain. Let's also make ap_select_domain() return void, as there
    are no more callers interested in its return value.

    overcurrent is low active, the overcurrent detection is never enabled
    again and events cannot be reported as expected. Because imx usb
    overcurrent polarity is low active by default, only detection needs
    to be enable in usbmisc init function.

    nfp: provide a better warning when ring allocation fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 23d9f5531c7c28546954b0bf332134a9b8a38c0a ]
    
    NFP supports fairly enormous ring sizes (up to 256k descriptors).
    In commit 466271703867 ("nfp: use kvcalloc() to allocate SW buffer
    descriptor arrays") we have started using kvcalloc() functions to
    make sure the allocation of software state arrays doesn't hit
    the MAX_ORDER limit.  Unfortunately, we can't use virtual mappings
    for the DMA region holding HW descriptors.  In case this allocation
    fails instead of the generic (and fairly scary) warning/splat in
    the logs print a helpful message explaining what happened and
    suggesting how to fix it.

    net: hns3: Fix parameter type for q_id in hclge_tm_q_to_qs_map_cfg()
    
    [ Upstream commit 32c7fbc8ffd752c6aa05d2dd7c13b0f0aa00ddaa ]
    
    So far all the places calling hclge_tm_q_to_qs_map_cfg() are assigning
    an u16 type value to "q_id", and in the processing of
    hclge_tm_q_to_qs_map_cfg(), it also converts the "q_id" to le16.
    
    The max tqp number for pf can be more than 256, we should use "u16" to
    store the queue id, instead of "u8", which may cause data lost.

    net: hns3: Fix client initialize state issue when roce client initialize failed
    
    [ Upstream commit d9f28fc23d544f673d087b00a6c7132d972f89ea ]
    
    When roce is loaded before nic, the roce client will not be initialized
    until nic client is initialized, but roce init flag is set before it.
    Furthermore, in this case of nic initialized success and roce failed,
    the nic init flag is not set, and roce init flag is not cleared.
    
    This patch fixes it by set init flag only after the client is initialized
    successfully.

    net: hns3: Fix for setting speed for phy failed problem
    
    [ Upstream commit fd8133148eb6a733f9cfdaecd4d99f378e21d582 ]
    
    The function of genphy_read_status is that reading phy information
    from HW and using these information to update SW variable. If user
    is using ethtool to setting the speed of phy and service task is calling
    by hclge_get_mac_phy_link, the result of speed setting is uncertain.
    Because ethtool cmd will modified phydev and hclge_get_mac_phy_link also
    will modified phydev.
    
    Because phy state machine will update phy link periodically, we can
    just use phydev->link to check the link status. This patch removes
    function call of genphy_read_status. To ensure accuracy, this patch
    adds a phy state check. If phy state is not PHY_RUNNING, we consider
    link is down. Because in some scenarios, phydev->link may be link up,
    but phy state is not PHY_RUNNING. This is just an intermediate state.
    In fact, the link is not ready yet.

    [ Upstream commit e00d93ac9a189673028ac125a74b9bc8ae73eebc ]
    
    This re-applies commit b91c1e3e7a6f ("powerpc: Fix duplicate const
    clang warning in user access code") (Jun 2015) which was undone in
    commits:
      f2ca80905929 ("powerpc/sparse: Constify the address pointer in __get_user_nosleep()") (Feb 2017)
      d466f6c5cac1 ("powerpc/sparse: Constify the address pointer in __get_user_nocheck()") (Feb 2017)
      f84ed59a612d ("powerpc/sparse: Constify the address pointer in __get_user_check()") (Feb 2017)
    
    We see a large number of duplicate const errors in the user access
    code when building with llvm/clang:
    
      include/linux/pagemap.h:576:8: warning: duplicate 'const' declaration specifier [-Wduplicate-decl-specifier]
            ret = __get_user(c, uaddr);
    
    The problem is we are doing const __typeof__(*(ptr)), which will hit
    the warning if ptr is marked const.
    
    Removing const does not seem to have any effect on GCC code
    generation.

    powerpc/pseries: Disable CPU hotplug across migrations
    
    [ Upstream commit 85a88cabad57d26d826dd94ea34d3a785824d802 ]
    
    When performing partition migrations all present CPUs must be online
    as all present CPUs must make the H_JOIN call as part of the migration
    process. Once all present CPUs make the H_JOIN call, one CPU is returned
    to make the rtas call to perform the migration to the destination system.
    
    During testing of migration and changing the SMT state we have found
    instances where CPUs are offlined, as part of the SMT state change,
    before they make the H_JOIN call. This results in a hung system where
    every CPU is either in H_JOIN or offline.
    
    To prevent this this patch disables CPU hotplug during the migration
    process.

    powerpc/pseries/memory-hotplug: Only update DT once per memory DLPAR request
    
    [ Upstream commit 063b8b1251fd069f3740339fca56119d218f11ba ]
    
    The updates to powerpc numa and memory hotplug code now use the
    in-kernel LMB array instead of the device tree. This change allows the
    pseries memory DLPAR code to only update the device tree once after
    successfully handling a DLPAR request.
    
    Prior to the in-kernel LMB array, the numa code looked up the affinity
    for memory being added in the device tree, the code now looks this up
    in the LMB array. This change means the memory hotplug code can just
    update the affinity for an LMB in the LMB array instead of updating
    the device tree.
    
    This also provides a savings in kernel memory. When updating the
    device tree old properties are never free'ed since there is no
    usecount on properties. This behavior leads to a new copy of the
    property being allocated every time a LMB is added or removed (i.e. a
    request to add 100 LMBs creates 100 new copies of the property). With
    this update only a single new property is created when a DLPAR request
    completes successfully.

    selftests/powerpc: Do not fail with reschedule
    
    [ Upstream commit 44d947eff19d64384efc06069509db7a0a1103b0 ]
    
    There are cases where the test is not expecting to have the transaction
    aborted, but, the test process might have been rescheduled, either in the
    OS level or by KVM (if it is running on a KVM guest machine). The process
    reschedule will cause a treclaim/recheckpoint which will cause the
    transaction to doom, aborting the transaction as soon as the process is
    rescheduled back to the CPU. This might cause the test to fail, but this is
    not a failure in essence.
    
    If that is the case, TEXASR[FC] is indicated with either
    TM_CAUSE_RESCHEDULE or TM_CAUSE_KVM_RESCHEDULE for KVM interruptions.
    
    In this scenario, ignore these two failures and avoid the whole test to
    return failure.

    Shifting unsigned char b by an int type can lead to sign-extension
    overflow. For example, if b is 0xff and the shift is 24, then top
    bit is sign-extended so the final value passed to writeq has all
    the upper 32 bits set.  Fix this by casting b to a 64 bit unsigned
    before the shift.

    tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Fix serial when not used as console
    
    [ Upstream commit c362272bdea32bf048d6916b0a2dc485eb9cf787 ]
    
    If you've got the "console" serial port setup to use just as a UART
    (AKA there is no "console=ttyMSMX" on the kernel command line) then
    certain initialization is skipped.  When userspace later tries to do
    something with the port then things go boom (specifically, on my
    system, some sort of exception hit that caused the system to reboot
    itself w/ no error messages).
    
    Let's cleanup / refactor the init so that we always run the same init
    code regardless of whether we're using the console.
    
    To make this work, we make rely on qcom_geni_serial_pm doing its job
    to turn resources on.
    
    For the record, here is a trace of the order of things (after this
    patch) when console= is specified on the command line and we have an
    agetty on the port:
      qcom_geni_serial_pm: 4 (undefined) => 0 (on)
      qcom_geni_console_setup
      qcom_geni_serial_port_setup
      qcom_geni_serial_console_write
      qcom_geni_serial_startup
      qcom_geni_serial_start_tx
    
    ...and here is the order of things (after this patch) when console= is
    _NOT_ specified on the command line and we have an agetty port:
      qcom_geni_serial_pm: 4 => 0

    On the error path of mxs_auart_request_gpio_irq() is performed
    backward iterating with index i of enum type. Underline enum type
    may be unsigned char. In this case check (--i >= 0) will be always
    true and error handling goes into infinite loop.
    
    The patch changes the check so that it is valid for signed and unsigned
    types.

    [ Upstream commit 4b9d33c6a30688344a3e95179654ea31b07f59b7 ]
    
    The driver's suspend/resume functions were buggy.
    If UART node contains any child node in the DT and
    the child is established a communication path with
    the parent UART. The relevant /dev/ttyPS* node will
    be not available for other operations.
    If the driver is trying to do any operations like
    suspend/resume without checking the tty->dev status
    it leads to the kernel crash/hang.
    
    This patch fix this issue by call the device_may_wake()
    with the generic parameter of type struct device.
    in the uart suspend and resume paths.
    
    It also fixes a race condition in the uart suspend

    [ Upstream commit b7a417628abf49dae98cb80a272dc133b0e4d1a3 ]
    
    The driver registers the v4l2 subdevice before attempting to power on the
    chip and checking its ID. This means that a media device driver that it's
    waiting for this subdevice to be bound, will prematurely expose its media
    device node to userspace because if something goes wrong the media entity
    will be cleaned up again on the ov2680 probe function.
    
    This also simplifies the probe function error path since no initialization
    is made before attempting to enable the resources or checking the chip ID.

    s390/qeth: invoke softirqs after napi_schedule()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d19db777a2f32c9b76f6fd517ed8960576cb43e ]
    
    Calling napi_schedule() from process context does not ensure that the
    NET_RX softirq is run in a timely fashion. So trigger it manually.
    
    This is no big issue with current code. A call to ndo_open() is usually
    followed by a ndo_set_rx_mode() call, and for qeth this contains a
    spin_unlock_bh(). Except for OSN, where qeth_l2_set_rx_mode() bails out
    early.
    Nevertheless it's best to not depend on this behaviour, and just fix
    the issue at its source like all other drivers do. For instance see
    commit 83a0c6e58901 ("i40e: Invoke softirqs after napi_reschedule").

    [ Upstream commit 121ca39aa5585def682a2c8592983442438b84dc ]
    
    When setting up, qeth installs its IRQ handler on the ccw devices. But
    the IRQ handler is not cleared on removal - so even after qeth yields
    control of the ccw devices, spurious interrupts would still be presented
    to us.
    
    Make (de-)installation of the IRQ handler part of the ccw channel
    setup/removal helpers, and while at it also add the appropriate locking.
    Shift around qeth_setup_channel() to avoid a forward declaration for
    qeth_irq().

    ACPI / LPSS: Exclude I2C busses shared with PUNIT from pmc_atom_d3_mask
    
    [ Upstream commit 86b62e5cd8965d3056f9e9ccdec51631c37add81 ]
    
    lpss_iosf_enter_d3_state() checks if all hw-blocks using the DMA
    controllers are in d3 before powering down the DMA controllers.
    
    But on devices, where the I2C bus connected to the PMIC is shared by
    the PUNIT, the controller for that bus will never reach d3 since it has
    an effectively empty _PS3 method. Instead it appears to automatically
    power-down during S0i3 and we never see it as being in d3.
    
    This causes the DMA controllers to never be powered-down on these devices,
    causing them to never reach S0i3. This commit uses the ACPI _SEM method
    to detect if an I2C bus is shared with the PUNIT and if it is, it removes
    it from the mask of devices which lpss_iosf_enter_d3_state() checks for.
    
    This fixes these devices never reaching any S0ix states.

    ip_gre: fix parsing gre header in ipgre_err
    
    [ Upstream commit b0350d51f001e6edc13ee4f253b98b50b05dd401 ]
    
    gre_parse_header stops parsing when csum_err is encountered, which means
    tpi->key is undefined and ip_tunnel_lookup will return NULL improperly.
    
    This patch introduce a NULL pointer as csum_err parameter. Even when
    csum_err is encountered, it won't return error and continue parsing gre
    header as expected.

    The terminating NUL byte is only there because the buffer is

    component: fix loop condition to call unbind() if bind() fails
    
    [ Upstream commit bdae566d5d9733b6e32b378668b84eadf28a94d4 ]
    
    During component_bind_all(), if bind() fails for any
    particular component associated with a master, unbind()
    should be called for all previous components in that
    master's match array, whose bind() might have completed
    successfully. As per the current logic, if bind() fails
    for the component at position 'n' in the master's match
    array, it would start calling unbind() from component in
    'n'th position itself and work backwards, and will always
    skip calling unbind() for component in 0th position in the
    master's match array.
    Fix this by updating the loop condition, and the logic to
    refer to the components in master's match array, so that
    unbind() is called for all components starting from 'n-1'st
    position in the array, until (and including) component in
    0th position.

    blok, bfq: do not plug I/O if all queues are weight-raised
    
    [ Upstream commit c8765de0adfcaaf4ffb2d951e07444f00ffa9453 ]
    
    To reduce latency for interactive and soft real-time applications, bfq
    privileges the bfq_queues containing the I/O of these
    applications. These privileged queues, referred-to as weight-raised
    queues, get a much higher share of the device throughput
    w.r.t. non-privileged queues. To preserve this higher share, the I/O
    of any non-weight-raised queue must be plugged whenever a sync
    weight-raised queue, while being served, remains temporarily empty. To
    attain this goal, bfq simply plugs any I/O (from any queue), if a sync
    weight-raised queue remains empty while in service.
    
    Unfortunately, this plugging typically lowers throughput with random
    I/O, on devices with internal queueing (because it reduces the filling
    level of the internal queues of the device).
    
    This commit addresses this issue by restricting the cases where
    plugging is performed: if a sync weight-raised queue remains empty
    while in service, then I/O plugging is performed only if some of the
    active bfq_queues are *not* weight-raised (which is actually the only
    circumstance where plugging is needed to preserve the higher share of
    the throughput of weight-raised queues). This restriction proved able
    to boost throughput in really many use cases needing only maximum
    throughput.

    block, bfq: inject other-queue I/O into seeky idle queues on NCQ flash
    
    [ Upstream commit d0edc2473be9d70f999282e1ca7863ad6ae704dc ]
    
    The Achilles' heel of BFQ is its failing to reach a high throughput
    with sync random I/O on flash storage with internal queueing, in case
    the processes doing I/O have differentiated weights.
    
    The cause of this failure is as follows. If at least two processes do
    sync I/O, and have a different weight from each other, then BFQ plugs
    I/O dispatching every time one of these processes, while it is being
    served, remains temporarily without pending I/O requests. This
    plugging is necessary to guarantee that every process enjoys a
    bandwidth proportional to its weight; but it empties the internal
    queue(s) of the drive. And this kills throughput with random I/O. So,
    if some processes have differentiated weights and do both sync and
    random I/O, the end result is a throughput collapse.
    
    This commit tries to counter this problem by injecting the service of
    other processes, in a controlled way, while the process in service
    happens to have no I/O. This injection is performed only if the medium
    is non rotational and performs internal queueing, and the process in
    service does random I/O (service injection might be beneficial for
    sequential I/O too, we'll work on that).
    
    As an example of the benefits of this commit, on a PLEXTOR PX-256M5S
    SSD, and with five processes having differentiated weights and doing
    sync random 4KB I/O, this commit makes the throughput with bfq grow by
    400%, from 25 to 100MB/s. This higher throughput is 10MB/s lower than
    that reached with none. As some less random I/O is added to the mix,
    the throughput becomes equal to or higher than that with none.
    
    This commit is a very first attempt to recover throughput without
    losing control, and certainly has many limitations. One is, e.g., that
    the processes whose service is injected are not chosen so as to
    distribute the extra bandwidth they receive in accordance to their
    weights. Thus there might be loss of weighted fairness in some
    cases. Anyway, this loss concerns extra service, which would not have
    been received at all without this commit. Other limitations and issues
    will probably show up with usage.

    [ Upstream commit e4ba15debcfd27f60d43da940a58108783bff2a6 ]
    
    The bad_mode() handler is called if we encounter an uunknown exception,
    with the expectation that the subsequent call to panic() will halt the
    system. Unfortunately, if the exception calling bad_mode() is taken from
    EL0, then the call to die() can end up killing the current user task and
    calling schedule() instead of falling through to panic().
    
    Remove the die() call altogether, since we really want to bring down the
    machine in this "impossible" case.

    android: binder: no outgoing transaction when thread todo has transaction
    
    [ Upstream commit 44b73962cb25f1c8170ea695c4564b05a75e1fd4 ]
    
    When a process dies, failed reply is sent to the sender of any transaction
    queued on a dead thread's todo list. The sender asserts that the
    received failed reply corresponds to the head of the transaction stack.
    This assert can fail if the dead thread is allowed to send outgoing
    transactions when there is already a transaction on its todo list,
    because this new transaction can end up on the transaction stack of the
    original sender. The following steps illustrate how this assertion can
    fail.
    
    1. Thread1 sends txn19 to Thread2
       (T1->transaction_stack=txn19, T2->todo+=txn19)
    2. Without processing todo list, Thread2 sends txn20 to Thread1
       (T1->todo+=txn20, T2->transaction_stack=txn20)
    3. T1 processes txn20 on its todo list
       (T1->transaction_stack=txn20->txn19, T1->todo=<empty>)
    4. T2 dies, T2->todo cleanup attempts to send failed reply for txn19, but
       T1->transaction_stack points to txn20 -- assertion failes
    
    Step 2. is the incorrect behavior. When there is a transaction on a
    thread's todo list, this thread should not be able to send any outgoing
    synchronous transactions. Only the head of the todo list needs to be
    checked because only threads that are waiting for proc work can directly
    receive work from another thread, and no work is allowed to be queued
    on such a thread without waking up the thread. This patch also enforces
    that a thread is not waiting for proc work when a work is directly
    enqueued to its todo list.

    powerpc/vdso: Correct call frame information
    
    [ Upstream commit 56d20861c027498b5a1112b4f9f05b56d906fdda ]
    
    Call Frame Information is used by gdb for back-traces and inserting
    breakpoints on function return for the "finish" command.  This failed
    when inside __kernel_clock_gettime.  More concerning than difficulty
    debugging is that CFI is also used by stack frame unwinding code to
    implement exceptions.  If you have an app that needs to handle
    asynchronous exceptions for some reason, and you are unlucky enough to
    get one inside the VDSO time functions, your app will crash.
    
    What's wrong:  There is control flow in __kernel_clock_gettime that
    reaches label 99 without saving lr in r12.  CFI info however is
    interpreted by the unwinder without reference to control flow: It's a
    simple matter of "Execute all the CFI opcodes up to the current
    address".  That means the unwinder thinks r12 contains the return
    address at label 99.  Disabuse it of that notion by resetting CFI for
    the return address at label 99.
    
    Note that the ".cfi_restore lr" could have gone anywhere from the
    "mtlr r12" a few instructions earlier to the instruction at label 99.
    I put the CFI as late as possible, because in general that's best
    practice (and if possible grouped with other CFI in order to reduce
    the number of CFI opcodes executed when unwinding).  Using r12 as the
    return address is perfectly fine after the "mtlr r12" since r12 on
    that code path still contains the return address.
    
    __get_datapage also has a CFI error.  That function temporarily saves
    lr in r0, and reflects that fact with ".cfi_register lr,r0".  A later
    use of r0 means the CFI at that point isn't correct, as r0 no longer
    contains the return address.  Fix that too.

    soc: qcom: geni: geni_se_clk_freq_match() should always accept multiples
    
    [ Upstream commit 867d4aa7013fdee8b962cde1711f96c8dd86d926 ]
    
    The geni_se_clk_freq_match() has some strange semantics.  Specifically
    it is defined with two modes:
    1. It can find a clock that's an exact multiple of the requested rate
    2. It can find a non-exact match but it can't handle multiples then
    
    ...but callers should always be able to handle a clock that is a
    multiple of the requested clock so mode #2 doesn't really make sense.
    Let's change the semantics so that the non-exact match can also accept
    multiples and then change the code to handle that.
    
    The only caller of this code is the unlanded SPI driver [1] which
    currently passes "exact = True", thus it should be safe to change the
    semantics in this way.  ...and, in fact, the SPI driver should likely
    be modified to pass "exact = False" (with the new semantics) since
    that will allow it to work with SPI devices that request a clock rate
    that doesn't exactly match a rate we can make.

    soc: qcom: geni: Don't ignore clk_round_rate() errors in geni_se_clk_tbl_get()
    
    [ Upstream commit e11bbcedecae85ce60a5d99ea03528c2d6f867e0 ]
    
    The function clk_round_rate() is defined to return a "long", not an
    "unsigned long".  That's because it might return a negative error
    code.  Change the call in geni_se_clk_tbl_get() to check for errors.
    
    While we're at it, get rid of a useless init of "freq".
    
    NOTE: overall the idea that we should iterate over clk_round_rate() to
    try to reconstruct a table already present in the clock driver is
    questionable.  Specifically:
    - This method relies on "clk_round_rate()" rounding up.
    - This method only works if the table is sorted and has no duplicates.
    ...this patch doesn't try to fix those problems, it just makes the
    error handling more correct.

    The interrupt handler has to be acquired after the other resource
    initialization when allocated with IRQF_SHARED.  Otherwise it's
    triggered before the resource gets ready, and may lead to unpleasant

    The VIDEO_GET_EVENT and VIDEO_STILLPICTURE was added back in 2005 but
    it never worked because the command number is wrong.
    
    Using the right command number means we have a better chance of them
    actually doing the right thing, though clearly nobody has ever tried
    it successfully.
    
    I noticed these while auditing the remaining users of compat_time_t
    for y2038 bugs. This one is fine in that regard, it just never did
    anything.

    f2fs: fix setattr project check upon fssetxattr ioctl
    
    [ Upstream commit c8e927579e00a182eda07e4c45df9c8c699c8ded ]
    
    Currently, project quota could be changed by fssetxattr
    ioctl, and existed permission check inode_owner_or_capable()
    is obviously not enough, just think that common users could
    change project id of file, that could make users to
    break project quota easily.
    
    This patch try to follow same regular of xfs project
    quota:
    
    "Project Quota ID state is only allowed to change from
    within the init namespace. Enforce that restriction only
    if we are trying to change the quota ID state.
    Everything else is allowed in user namespaces."
    
    Besides that, check and set project id'state should
    be an atomic operation, protect whole operation with
    inode lock.

    signal: Properly deliver SIGSEGV from x86 uprobes
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a63c1ffd384ebdce40aac9c997dab68379137be ]
    
    For userspace to tell the difference between an random signal
    and an exception, the exception must include siginfo information.
    
    Using SEND_SIG_FORCED for SIGSEGV is thus wrong, and it will result in
    userspace seeing si_code == SI_USER (like a random signal) instead of
    si_code == SI_KERNEL or a more specific si_code as all exceptions
    deliver.
    
    Therefore replace force_sig_info(SIGSEGV, SEND_SIG_FORCE, current)
    with force_sig(SIG_SEGV, current) which gets this right and is shorter
    and easier to type.

    ath9k: add back support for using active monitor interfaces for tx99
    
    [ Upstream commit 6df0580be8bc30803c4d8b2ed9c2230a2740c795 ]
    
    Various documented examples on how to set up tx99 with ath9k rely
    on setting up a regular monitor interface for setting the channel.
    My previous patch "ath9k: fix tx99 with monitor mode interface" made
    it possible to set it up this way again. However, it was removing support
    for using an active monitor interface, which is required for controlling
    the bitrate as well, since the bitrate is not passed down with a regular
    monitor interface.
    
    This patch partially reverts the previous one, but keeps support for using
    a regular monitor interface to keep documented steps working in cases
    where the bitrate does not matter

    EDAC, sb_edac: Return early on ADDRV bit and address type test
    
    [ Upstream commit dcc960b225ceb2bd66c45e0845d03e577f7010f9 ]
    
    Users of the mce_register_decode_chain() are called for every logged
    error. EDAC drivers should check:
    
    1) Is this a memory error? [bit 7 in status register]
    2) Is there a valid address? [bit 58 in status register]
    3) Is the address a system address? [bitfield 8:6 in misc register]
    
    The sb_edac driver performed test "1" twice. Waited far too long to
    perform check "2". Didn't do check "3" at all.
    
    Fix it by moving the test for valid address from
    sbridge_mce_output_error() into sbridge_mce_check_error() and add a test
    for the type immediately after. Delete the redundant check for the type
    of the error from sbridge_mce_output_error().

    dmaengine: dma-jz4780: Further residue status fix
    
    [ Upstream commit 83ef4fb7556b6a673f755da670cbacab7e2c7f1b ]
    
    Func jz4780_dma_desc_residue() expects the index to the next hw
    descriptor as its last parameter. Caller func jz4780_dma_tx_status(),
    however, applied modulus before passing it. When the current hw
    descriptor was last in the list, the index passed became zero.
    
    The resulting excess of reported residue especially caused problems
    with cyclic DMA transfer clients, i.e. ALSA AIC audio output, which
    rely on this for determining current DMA location within buffer.
    
    Combined with the recent and related residue-reporting fixes, spurious
    ALSA audio underruns on jz4770 hardware are now fixed.

    software-controlled connect by pullup(), but UDC wants to keep
    disconnect until usb_gadget_activate() is called which calls
    pullup() if needed. So we disable vbus rise & fall interrupts
    and just use pullup() to enable & disable U3 function, and reset
    mtu3 state when disconnect instead when vbus fall.

    ARM: dts: exynos: Disable pull control for PMIC IRQ line on Artik5 board
    
    [ Upstream commit 62623718fd31d08b26ebea6c8b40f24924153ab7 ]
    
    S2MPS14 PMIC interrupt line on Exynos3250-based Artik5 evaluation board
    has external pull-up resistors, so disable any pull control for it in
    controller node. This fixes support for S2MPS14 PMIC interrupts and
    enables operation of wakeup from S2MPS14 RTC alarm.

    [ Upstream commit ca64b719a1e665ac7449b6a968059176af7365a8 ]
    
    Replace all the memcpy() for copying name strings from the firmware with
    strlcpy() to make sure we are bounded by the source buffer size and we
    also always have NULL-terminated strings.
    
    This is needed to avoid out of bounds accesses if the firmware returns
    a non-terminated string.

    mdev->state device state is not protected by the QP for which WRs are

    Given that device fatal error is unlikely situation, wrap the condition
    check with unlikely().
    
    Additionally, kernel QP1 is also a kernel ULP for which soft CQEs needs
    to be generated. Therefore, check for device fatal error before
    processing QP1 work requests.

    ath10k: wmi: disable softirq's while calling ieee80211_rx
    
    [ Upstream commit 37f62c0d5822f631b786b29a1b1069ab714d1a28 ]
    
    This is done in order not to trig the below warning in
    ieee80211_rx_napi:
    
    WARN_ON_ONCE(softirq_count() == 0);
    
    ieee80211_rx_napi requires that softirq's are disabled during
    execution.
    
    The High latency bus drivers (SDIO and USB) sometimes call the wmi
    ep_rx_complete callback from non softirq context, resulting in a trigger
    of the above warning.
    
    Calling ieee80211_rx_ni with softirq's already disabled (e.g., from
    softirq context) should be safe as the local_bh_disable and
    local_bh_enable functions (called from ieee80211_rx_ni) are fully
    reentrant.

    qxl: fix null-pointer crash during suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 7948a2b15873319d1bff4d37c09b9f2bf87b9021 ]
    
    "crtc->helper_private" is not initialized by the QXL driver and thus the
    "crtc_funcs->disable" call would crash (resulting in suspend failure).
    Fix this by converting the suspend/resume functions to use the
    drm_mode_config_helper_* helpers.
    
    Tested system sleep with QEMU 3.0 using "echo mem > /sys/power/state".
    During suspend the following message is visible from QEMU:
    
        spice/server/display-channel.c:2425:display_channel_validate_surface: canvas address is 0x7fd05da68308 for 0 (and is NULL)
        spice/server/display-channel.c:2426:display_channel_validate_surface: failed on 0
    
    This seems to be triggered by QXL_IO_NOTIFY_CMD after
    QXL_IO_DESTROY_PRIMARY_ASYNC, but aside from the warning things still
    seem to work (tested with both the GTK and -spice options).

    IB/mlx5: Change TX affinity assignment in RoCE LAG mode
    
    [ Upstream commit c6a21c3864fc7f5febae7d096cd136f397c791f2 ]
    
    In the current code, the TX affinity is per RoCE device, which can cause
    unfairness between different contexts. e.g. if we open two contexts, and
    each open 10 QPs concurrently, all of the QPs of the first context might
    end up on the first port instead of distributed on the two ports as
    expected
    
    To overcome this unfairness between processes, we maintain per device TX
    affinity, and per process TX affinity.
    
    The allocation algorithm is as follow:
    
    1. Hold two tx_port_affinity atomic variables, one per RoCE device and one
       per ucontext. Both initialized to 0.
    
    2. In mlx5_ib_alloc_ucontext do:
     2.1. ucontext.tx_port_affinity = device.tx_port_affinity
     2.2. device.tx_port_affinity += 1
    
    3. In modify QP INIT2RST:
     3.1. qp.tx_port_affinity = ucontext.tx_port_affinity % MLX5_PORT_NUM
     3.2. ucontext.tx_port_affinity += 1

    [ Upstream commit 88aa3bbfc020d14b13d67af3f5c08aa992d82cd8 ]
    
    The marvell_nfc_init() function fiddles with some bits of a system
    controller on Armada 7K/8K. However, it does a read/modify/write
    sequence on GENCONF_CLK_GATING_CTRL and GENCONF_ND_CLK_CTRL, which
    isn't safe from a concurrency point of view, as the regmap lock isn't
    taken accross the read/modify/write sequence. To solve this issue, use
    regmap_update_bits().
    
    While at it, since the "reg" variable is no longer needed for the
    read/modify/write sequences, get rid of it for the regmap_write() to
    GENCONF_SOC_DEVICE_MUX, and directly pass the value to be written as
    argument.

    Currently, the dst mac addr of loopback packet is the same as
    the host' mac addr, the SSU component may loop back the packet
    to host before the packet reaches mac or serdes, which will defect
    the purpose of mac or serdes selftest.
    
    This patch changes it by adding 0x1f to the last byte of dst mac
    addr.

    net: hns3: Fix for loopback selftest failed problem
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f29fc23b21d3cbd966537bfabba07c00466b787 ]
    
    Tqp and mac need to be enabled when doing loopback selftest,
    ae_algo->ops->start/stop is used to do the job, there is a
    time window between ae_algo->ops->start/stop and loopback setup,
    which will cause selftest failed problem when there is frame
    coming in during that time window.
    
    This patch fixes it by enabling the tqp and mac during loopback
    setup process.

    brcmfmac: fix wrong strnchr usage
    
    [ Upstream commit cb18e2e9ec71d42409a51b83546686c609780dde ]
    
    strnchr takes arguments in the order of its name: string, max bytes to
    read, character to search for. Here we're passing '\n' aka 10 as the
    buffer size, and searching for sizeof(buf) aka BRCMF_DCMD_SMLEN aka
    256 (aka '\0', since it's implicitly converted to char) within those 10
    bytes.
    
    Just interchanging the last two arguments would still leave a bug,
    because if we've been successful once, there are not sizeof(buf)
    characters left after the new value of p.
    
    Since clmver is immediately afterwards passed as a %s argument, I assume
    that it is actually a properly nul-terminated string. For that case, we
    have strreplace().

    mwifex: free rx_cmd skb in suspended state
    
    [ Upstream commit 33a164fa8a4c91408e0b7738f754cb1a7827c5f2 ]
    
    USB suspend handler will kill the presubmitted rx_cmd URB. This
    triggers a call to the corresponding URB complete handler, which
    will free the rx_cmd skb, associated with rx_cmd URB. Due to a
    possible race betwen suspend handler and main thread, depicted in
    'commit bfcacac6c84b ("mwifiex: do no submit URB in suspended
    state")', it is possible that the rx_cmd skb will fail to get
    freed. This causes a memory leak, since the resume handler will
    always allocate a new rx_cmd skb.
    
    To fix this, free the rx_cmd skb in mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb, if
    the device is in suspended state.

    mwifiex: do no submit URB in suspended state
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bd4628c2f31c51254aa39628ecae521d00d0b90 ]
    
    There is a possible race between USB suspend and main thread:
    
    1. After processing the command response, main thread will submit
    rx_cmd URB back so as to process next command response, by
    calling mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb.
    
    2. During USB suspend, the suspend handler will check if rx_cmd
    URB is pending(submitted) and if true, kill this URB.
    
    There is a possible race between #1 and #2, where rx_cmd URB will
    be submitted by main thread(#1) after the suspend handler check
    in #2.
    
    To fix this, check if device is already suspended in
    mwifiex_usb_submit_rx_urb, in which case do not submit the URB.

    pm_runtime_get_if_in_use() returns -EINVAL if runtime PM is disabled. This

    IB/rxe: fixes for rdma read retry
    
    [ Upstream commit 030e46e495af855a13964a0aab9753ea82a96edc ]
    
    When a read request is retried for the remaining partial
    data, the response may restart from read response first
    or read response only. So support those cases.
    
    Do not advance the comp psn beyond the current wqe's last_psn
    as that could skip over an entire read wqe and will cause the
    req_retry() logic to set an incorrect req psn.
    An example sequence is as follows:
    Write        PSN 40 -- this is the current WQE.
    Read request PSN 41
    Write        PSN 42
    Receive ACK  PSN 42 -- this will complete the current WQE
    for PSN 40, and set the comp psn to 42 which is a problem
    because the read request at PSN 41 has been skipped over.
    So when req_retry() tries to retransmit the read request,
    it sets the req psn to 42 which is incorrect.
    
    When retrying a read request, calculate the number of psns
    completed based on the dma resid instead of the wqe first_psn.
    The wqe first_psn could have moved if the read request was
    retried multiple times.
    
    Set the reth length to the dma resid to handle read retries for
    the remaining partial data.

    To prevent VF from deleting MAC address that was assigned by the

    [ Upstream commit babbcc60040abfb7a9e3caa1c58fe182ae73762a ]
    
    If a VF is being removed, there is no need to continue with the
    workqueue sync for the adminq task, thus cancel it. Without this call,
    when VFs are created and removed right away, there might be a chance for
    the driver to crash with events stuck in the adminq.

    Regulators, which are marked as 'on-in-suspend' seems to be critical for
    board operation, thus they must not be disabled anytime. This can be
    only assured by marking them as 'always-on', because otherwise some
    actions of their clients might result in turning them off. This patch

    partially reverts 'always-on' property removal done by the commit

    such update the setting of rate_max in dpcm_init_runtime_hw
    to be consistent with the non-DPCM cases and set rate_max to

    gfs2: Don't set GFS2_RDF_UPTODATE when the lvb is updated
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f36cb36c9d14340bb200d2ad9117b03ce992cfe ]
    
    The GFS2_RDF_UPTODATE flag in the rgrp is used to determine when
    a rgrp buffer is valid. It's cleared when the glock is invalidated,
    signifying that the buffer data is now invalid. But before this
    patch, function update_rgrp_lvb was setting the flag when it
    determined it had a valid lvb. But that's an invalid assumption:
    just because you have a valid lvb doesn't mean you have valid
    buffers. After all, another node may have made the lvb valid,
    and this node just fetched it from the glock via dlm.
    
    Consider this scenario:
    1. The file system is mounted with RGRPLVB option.
    2. In gfs2_inplace_reserve it locks the rgrp glock EX, but thanks
       to GL_SKIP, it skips the gfs2_rgrp_bh_get.
    3. Since loops == 0 and the allocation target (ap->target) is
       bigger than the largest known chunk of blocks in the rgrp
       (rs->rs_rbm.rgd->rd_extfail_pt) it skips that rgrp and bypasses
       the call to gfs2_rgrp_bh_get there as well.
    4. update_rgrp_lvb sees the lvb MAGIC number is valid, so bypasses
       gfs2_rgrp_bh_get, but it still sets sets GFS2_RDF_UPTODATE due
       to this invalid assumption.
    5. The next time update_rgrp_lvb is called, it sees the bit is set
       and just returns 0, assuming both the lvb and rgrp are both
       uptodate. But since this is a smaller allocation, or space has
       been freed by another node, thus adjusting the lvb values,
       it decides to use the rgrp for allocations, with invalid rd_free
       due to the fact it was never updated.
    
    This patch changes update_rgrp_lvb so it doesn't set the UPTODATE
    flag anymore. That way, it has no choice but to fetch the latest
    values.

    [ Upstream commit fd2a981777d911b2e94cdec50779c85c58a0dec9 ]
    
    Once reset is issued, the driver loses all control queue interfaces.
    Exercising control queue operations during reset is incorrect and
    may result in long timeouts.
    
    This patch introduces a new field 'reset_ongoing' in the hw structure.
    This is set to 1 by the core driver when it receives a reset interrupt.
    ice_sq_send_cmd checks reset_ongoing before actually issuing the control
    queue operation. If a reset is in progress, it returns a soft error code
    (ICE_ERR_RESET_PENDING) to the caller. The caller may or may not have to
    take any action based on this return. Once the driver knows that the
    reset is done, it has to set reset_ongoing back to 0. This will allow
    control queue operations to be posted to the hardware again.
    
    This "bail out" logic was specifically added to ice_sq_send_cmd (which
    is pretty low level function) so that we have one solution in one place
    that applies to all types of control queues.

    ath10k: limit available channels via DT ieee80211-freq-limit
    
    [ Upstream commit 34d5629d2ca89d847b7040762b87964c696c14da ]
    
    Tri-band devices (1x 2.4GHz + 2x 5GHz) often incorporate special filters in
    the RX and TX path. These filtered channel can in theory still be used by
    the hardware but the signal strength is reduced so much that it makes no
    sense.
    
    There is already a DT property to limit the available channels but ath10k
    has to manually call this functionality to limit the currrently set wiphy
    channels further.

    cfg80211: Avoid regulatory restore when COUNTRY_IE_IGNORE is set
    
    [ Upstream commit 7417844b63d4b0dc8ab23f88259bf95de7d09b57 ]
    
    When REGULATORY_COUNTRY_IE_IGNORE is set,  __reg_process_hint_country_ie()
    ignores the country code change request from __cfg80211_connect_result()
    via regulatory_hint_country_ie().
    
    After Disconnect, similar to above, country code should not be reset to
    world when country IE ignore is set. But this is violated and restore of
    regulatory settings is invoked by cfg80211_disconnect_work via
    regulatory_hint_disconnect().
    
    To address this, avoid regulatory restore from regulatory_hint_disconnect()
    when COUNTRY_IE_IGNORE is set.
    
    Note: Currently, restore_regulatory_settings() takes care of clearing
    beacon hints. But in the proposed change, regulatory restore is avoided.
    Therefore, explicitly clear beacon hints when DISABLE_BEACON_HINTS
    is not set.

    arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Orange Pi Win: Fix SD card node
    
    [ Upstream commit 09b964afca14d0594b2b2f265df3d987e2f43867 ]
    
    The Orange Pi Win has a microSD card slot which is connected via all
    four SD data lines. As the DT was not mentioning this fact, we got the
    default single bit transfers, losing out on performance.
    Also, as microSD does not have a write protect switch, we disable this
    feature in the DT node.

    Deferred messages are async messages used to synchronize
    transitions mostly while doing a bank switch on multi links.
    On successful transitions these messages are marked complete
    and thereby confirming that all the buses performed bank switch
    successfully.
    
    So, initialize the completion structure for the same.

    ath10k: fix kernel panic by moving pci flush after napi_disable
    
    [ Upstream commit bd1d395070cca4f42a93e520b0597274789274a4 ]
    
    When continuously running wifi up/down sequence, the napi poll
    can be scheduled after the CE buffers being freed by ath10k_pci_flush
    
    Steps:
      In a certain condition, during wifi down below scenario might occur.
    
    ath10k_stop->ath10k_hif_stop->napi_schedule->ath10k_pci_flush->napi_poll(napi_synchronize).
    
    In the above scenario, CE buffer entries will be freed up and become NULL in
    ath10k_pci_flush. And the napi_poll has been invoked after the flush process
    and it will try to get the skb from the CE buffer entry and perform some action on that.
    Since the CE buffer already cleaned by pci flush this action will create NULL
    pointer dereference and trigger below kernel panic.

    mm: hugetlb: switch to css_tryget() in hugetlb_cgroup_charge_cgroup()
    
    commit 0362f326d86c645b5e96b7dbc3ee515986ed019d upstream.
    
    An exiting task might belong to an offline cgroup.  In this case an
    attempt to grab a cgroup reference from the task can end up with an
    infinite loop in hugetlb_cgroup_charge_cgroup(), because neither the
    cgroup will become online, neither the task will be migrated to a live
    cgroup.
    
    Fix this by switching over to css_tryget().  As css_tryget_online()
    can't guarantee that the cgroup won't go offline, in most cases the
    check doesn't make sense.  In this particular case users of
    hugetlb_cgroup_charge_cgroup() are not affected by this change.
    
    A similar problem is described by commit 18fa84a2db0e ("cgroup: Use
    css_tryget() instead of css_tryget_online() in task_get_css()").

    The problem is caused by an exiting task which is associated with an
    offline memcg.  We're iterating over and over in the do {} while
    (!css_tryget_online()) loop, but obviously the memcg won't become online
    and the exiting task won't be migrated to a live memcg.
    
    Let's fix it by switching from css_tryget_online() to css_tryget().
    
    As css_tryget_online() cannot guarantee that the memcg won't go offline,
    the check is usually useless, except some rare cases when for example it
    determines if something should be presented to a user.
    
    A similar problem is described by commit 18fa84a2db0e ("cgroup: Use
    css_tryget() instead of css_tryget_online() in task_get_css()").
    
    Johannes:
    
    : The bug aside, it doesn't matter whether the cgroup is online for the
    : callers.  It used to matter when offlining needed to evacuate all charges
    : from the memcg, and so needed to prevent new ones from showing up, but we
    : don't care now.

    mm: mempolicy: fix the wrong return value and potential pages leak of mbind
    
    commit a85dfc305a21acfc48fa28a0fa0a0cb6ad496120 upstream.
    
    Commit d883544515aa ("mm: mempolicy: make the behavior consistent when
    MPOL_MF_MOVE* and MPOL_MF_STRICT were specified") fixed the return value
    of mbind() for a couple of corner cases.  But, it altered the errno for
    some other cases, for example, mbind() should return -EFAULT when part
    or all of the memory range specified by nodemask and maxnode points
    outside your accessible address space, or there was an unmapped hole in
    the specified memory range specified by addr and len.
    
    Fix this by preserving the errno returned by queue_pages_range().  And,
    the pagelist may be not empty even though queue_pages_range() returns
    error, put the pages back to LRU since mbind_range() is not called to
    really apply the policy so those pages should not be migrated, this is
    also the old behavior before the problematic commit.

    ecryptfs_lookup_interpose(): lower_dentry->d_parent is not stable either
    
    commit 762c69685ff7ad5ad7fee0656671e20a0c9c864d upstream.
    
    We need to get the underlying dentry of parent; sure, absent the races
    it is the parent of underlying dentry, but there's nothing to prevent
    losing a timeslice to preemtion in the middle of evaluation of
    lower_dentry->d_parent->d_inode, having another process move lower_dentry
    around and have its (ex)parent not pinned anymore and freed on memory
    pressure.  Then we regain CPU and try to fetch ->d_inode from memory
    that is freed by that point.
    
    dentry->d_parent *is* stable here - it's an argument of ->lookup() and
    we are guaranteed that it won't be moved anywhere until we feed it
    to d_add/d_splice_alias.  So we safely go that way to get to its
    underlying dentry.

    lower_dentry can't go from positive to negative (we have it pinned),
    but it *can* go from negative to positive.  So fetching ->d_inode
    into a local variable, doing a blocking allocation, checking that
    now ->d_inode is non-NULL and feeding the value we'd fetched
    earlier to a function that won't accept NULL is not a good idea.

    i2c: acpi: Force bus speed to 400KHz if a Silead touchscreen is present
    
    commit 7574c0db2e68c4d0bae9d415a683bdd8b2a761e9 upstream.
    
    Many cheap devices use Silead touchscreen controllers. Testing has shown
    repeatedly that these touchscreen controllers work fine at 400KHz, but for
    unknown reasons do not work properly at 100KHz. This has been seen on
    both ARM and x86 devices using totally different i2c controllers.
    
    On some devices the ACPI tables list another device at the same I2C-bus
    as only being capable of 100KHz, testing has shown that these other
    devices work fine at 400KHz (as can be expected of any recent I2C hw).
    
    This commit makes i2c_acpi_find_bus_speed() always return 400KHz if a
    Silead touchscreen controller is present, fixing the touchscreen not
    working on devices which ACPI tables' wrongly list another device on the
    same bus as only being capable of 100KHz.
    
    Specifically this fixes the touchscreen on the Jumper EZpad 6 m4 not
    working.

    IB/hfi1: Ensure full Gen3 speed in a Gen4 system
    
    commit a9c3c4c597704b3a1a2b9bef990e7d8a881f6533 upstream.
    
    If an hfi1 card is inserted in a Gen4 systems, the driver will avoid the
    gen3 speed bump and the card will operate at half speed.
    
    This is because the driver avoids the gen3 speed bump when the parent bus
    speed isn't identical to gen3, 8.0GT/s.  This is not compatible with gen4
    and newer speeds.
    
    Fix by relaxing the test to explicitly look for the lower capability
    speeds which inherently allows for gen4 and all future speeds.

    commit ba60cf9f78f0d7c8e73c7390608f7f818ee68aa0 upstream.
    
    The driver forgets to destroy workqueue in remove() similarly to what is
    done when probe() fails. Add a call to destroy_workqueue() to fix it.
    
    Since unregistration will wait for the work to finish, we do not need to
    cancel/flush the work instance in remove().

    Input: synaptics-rmi4 - disable the relative position IRQ in the F12 driver
    
    commit f6aabe1ff1d9d7bad0879253011216438bdb2530 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue seen on HID touchpads which report finger
    positions using RMI4 Function 12. The issue manifests itself as
    spurious button presses as described in:
    https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-input/msg58618.html
    
    Commit 24d28e4f1271 ("Input: synaptics-rmi4 - convert irq distribution
    to irq_domain") switched the RMI4 driver to using an irq_domain to handle
    RMI4 function interrupts. Functions with more then one interrupt now have
    each interrupt mapped to their own IRQ and IRQ handler. The result of
    this change is that the F12 IRQ handler was now getting called twice. Once
    for the absolute data interrupt and once for the relative data interrupt.
    For HID devices, calling rmi_f12_attention() a second time causes the
    attn_data data pointer and size to be set incorrectly. When the touchpad
    button is pressed, F30 will generate an interrupt and attempt to read the
    F30 data from the invalid attn_data data pointer and report incorrect
    button events.
    
    This patch disables the F12 relative interrupt which prevents
    rmi_f12_attention() from being called twice.

    Btrfs: fix log context list corruption after rename exchange operation
    
    commit e6c617102c7e4ac1398cb0b98ff1f0727755b520 upstream.
    
    During rename exchange we might have successfully log the new name in the
    source root's log tree, in which case we leave our log context (allocated
    on stack) in the root's list of log contextes. However we might fail to
    log the new name in the destination root, in which case we fallback to
    a transaction commit later and never sync the log of the source root,
    which causes the source root log context to remain in the list of log
    contextes. This later causes invalid memory accesses because the context
    was allocated on stack and after rename exchange finishes the stack gets
    reused and overwritten for other purposes.
    
    The kernel's linked list corruption detector (CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y) can
    detect this and report something like the following:

    This started happening recently when running some test cases from fstests
    like btrfs/004 for example, because support for rename exchange was added
    last week to fsstress from fstests.
    
    So fix this by deleting the log context for the source root from the list
    if we have logged the new name in the source root.

    The recently introduced unit descriptor validation had some bug for
    processing and extension units, it counts a bControlSize byte twice so
    it expected a bigger size than it should have been.  This seems
    resulting in a probe error on a few devices.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix incorrect NULL check in create_yamaha_midi_quirk()
    
    commit cc9dbfa9707868fb0ca864c05e0c42d3f4d15cf2 upstream.
    
    The commit 60849562a5db ("ALSA: usb-audio: Fix possible NULL
    dereference at create_yamaha_midi_quirk()") added NULL checks in
    create_yamaha_midi_quirk(), but there was an overlook.  The code
    allows one of either injd or outjd is NULL, but the second if check
    made returning -ENODEV if any of them is NULL.  Fix it in a proper
    form.

    ALSA: usb-audio: not submit urb for stopped endpoint
    
    commit 528699317dd6dc722dccc11b68800cf945109390 upstream.
    
    While output urb's snd_complete_urb() is executing, calling
    prepare_outbound_urb() may cause endpoint stopped before
    prepare_outbound_urb() returns and result in next urb submitted
    to stopped endpoint. usb-audio driver cannot re-use it afterwards as
    the urb is still hold by usb stack.
    
    This change checks EP_FLAG_RUNNING flag after prepare_outbound_urb() again
    to let snd_complete_urb() know the endpoint already stopped and does not
    submit next urb. Below kind of error will be fixed:
    
    [  213.153103] usb 1-2: timeout: still 1 active urbs on EP #1
    [  213.164121] usb 1-2: cannot submit urb 0, error -16: unknown error

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix missing error check at mixer resolution test
    
    commit 167beb1756791e0806365a3f86a0da10d7a327ee upstream.
    
    A check of the return value from get_cur_mix_raw() is missing at the
    resolution test code in get_min_max_with_quirks(), which may leave the
    variable untouched, leading to a random uninitialized value, as
    detected by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    Add the missing return error check for fixing that.

    ipmr: Fix skb headroom in ipmr_get_route().
    
    [ Upstream commit 7901cd97963d6cbde88fa25a4a446db3554c16c6 ]
    
    In route.c, inet_rtm_getroute_build_skb() creates an skb with no
    headroom. This skb is then used by inet_rtm_getroute() which may pass
    it to rt_fill_info() and, from there, to ipmr_get_route(). The later
    might try to reuse this skb by cloning it and prepending an IPv4
    header. But since the original skb has no headroom, skb_push() triggers
    skb_under_panic():

    Actually the original skb used to have enough headroom, but the

    inet_rtm_getroute_build_skb() by commit 404eb77ea766 ("ipv4: support
    sport, dport and ip_proto in RTM_GETROUTE").
    
    We could reserve some headroom again in inet_rtm_getroute_build_skb(),
    but this function shouldn't be responsible for handling the special
    case of ipmr_get_route(). Let's handle that directly in
    ipmr_get_route() by calling skb_realloc_headroom() instead of
    skb_clone().

    scsi: core: Handle drivers which set sg_tablesize to zero
    
    commit 9393c8de628cf0968d81a17cc11841e42191e041 upstream.
    
    In scsi_mq_setup_tags(), cmd_size is calculated based on zero size for the
    scatter-gather list in case the low level driver uses SG_NONE in its host
    template.
    
    cmd_size is passed on to the block layer for calculation of the request
    size, and we've seen NULL pointer dereference errors from the block layer
    in drivers where SG_NONE is used and a mq IO scheduler is active,
    apparently as a consequence of this (see commit 68ab2d76e4be ("scsi:
    cxlflash: Set sg_tablesize to 1 instead of SG_NONE"), and a recent patch by
    Finn Thain converting the three m68k NFR5380 drivers to avoid setting
    SG_NONE).
    
    Try to avoid these errors by accounting for at least one sg list entry when
    calculating cmd_size, regardless of whether the low level driver set a zero
    sg_tablesize.
    
    Tested on 030 m68k with the atari_scsi driver - setting sg_tablesize to
    SG_NONE no longer results in a crash when loading this driver.

    KVM: x86: introduce is_pae_paging
    
    [ Upstream commit bf03d4f9334728bf7c8ffc7de787df48abd6340e ]
    
    Checking for 32-bit PAE is quite common around code that fiddles with
    the PDPTRs.  Add a function to compress all checks into a single
    invocation.
    
    Moving to the common helper also fixes a subtle bug in kvm_set_cr3()
    where it fails to check is_long_mode() and results in KVM incorrectly
    attempting to load PDPTRs for a 64-bit guest.
