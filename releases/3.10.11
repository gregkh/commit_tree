    regmap: rbtree: Fix overlapping rbnodes.
    
    commit 4e67fb5f5e336250db944921e3c68057d6203034 upstream.
    
    Avoid overlapping register regions by making the initial blklen of a new
    node 1. If a register write occurs to a yet uncached register, that is
    lower than but near an existing node's base_reg, a new node is created
    and it's blklen is set to an arbitrary value (sizeof(*rbnode)). That may
    cause this node to overlap with another node. Those nodes should be merged,
    but this merge doesn't happen yet, so this patch at least makes the initial
    blklen small enough to avoid hitting the wrong node, which may otherwise
    lead to severe breakage.

    The ECDT of ASUSTEK L4R doesn't provide correct command and data
    I/O ports.  The DSDT provides the correct information instead.
    
    For this reason, add this machine to quirk list for ECDT validation

    1. Assert H_IS to clear the interrupts during hw reset
    and use mei_me_reg_write instead of mei_hcsr_set as the later
    strips down the H_IS
    
    2. fix interrupt disablement embarrassing typo
      hcsr |= ~H_IE -> hcsr &= ~H_IE;
    this will remove the unwanted interrupt on power down
    
    3. remove useless debug print outs

    iscsi-target: Fix potential NULL pointer in solicited NOPOUT reject
    
    commit 28aaa950320fc7b8df3f6d2d34fa7833391a9b72 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference regression in
    iscsit_setup_nop_out() code, specifically for two cases when a solicited
    NOPOUT triggers a ISCSI_REASON_PROTOCOL_ERROR reject to be generated.
    
    This is because iscsi_cmd is expected to be NULL for solicited NOPOUT
    case before iscsit_process_nop_out() locates the descriptor via TTT
    using iscsit_find_cmd_from_ttt().
    
    This regression was originally introduced in:

    iscsi-target: Fix iscsit_transport reference leak during NP thread reset
    
    commit c9a03c12464c851e691e8d5b6c9deba779c512e0 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a bug in __iscsi_target_login_thread() where an explicit
    network portal thread reset ends up leaking the iscsit_transport module
    reference, along with the associated iscsi_conn allocation.
    
    This manifests itself with iser-target where a NP reset causes the extra
    iscsit_transport reference to be taken in iscsit_conn_set_transport()
    during the reset, which prevents the ib_isert module from being unloaded
    after the NP thread shutdown has finished.

    iscsi-target: Fix ImmediateData=Yes failure regression in >= v3.10
    
    commit 9d86a2befceb06ee83c1a588915e6d6e0abef797 upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a regression bug within ImmediateData=Yes failure
    handling that ends up triggering an OOPs within >= v3.10 iscsi-target
    code.
    
    The problem occurs when iscsit_process_scsi_cmd() does the call to
    target_put_sess_cmd(), and once again in iscsit_get_immediate_data()
    that is triggered during two different cases:
    
     - When iscsit_sequence_cmd() returns CMDSN_LOWER_THAN_EXP, for which
       the descriptor state will already have been set to ISTATE_REMOVE
       by iscsit_sequence_cmd(), and
     - When iscsi_cmd->sense_reason is set, for which iscsit_execute_cmd()
       will have already called transport_send_check_condition_and_sense()
       to queue the exception response.
    
    It changes iscsit_process_scsi_cmd() to drop the early call, and makes
    iscsit_get_immediate_data() call target_put_sess_cmd() from a single
    location after dumping the immediate data for the failed command.
    
    The regression was initially introduced in commit:

    target: Fix trailing ASCII space usage in INQUIRY vendor+model
    
    commit ee60bddba5a5f23e39598195d944aa0eb2d455e5 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes spc_emulate_inquiry_std() to add trailing ASCII
    spaces for INQUIRY vendor + model fields following SPC-4 text:
    
      "ASCII data fields described as being left-aligned shall have any

       the unused bytes shall be filled with ASCII space characters (20h)."

    The PLL hang workaround is required only for AR9330 and
    AR9340. This issue was first observed on an AP121 and the WAR
    is enabled for AR9340 also (DB120 etc.), since it uses a PLL
    design identical to AR9330. This is not required for AR9485 and AR9550.

    ath9k_htc: Restore skb headroom when returning skb to mac80211
    
    commit d2e9fc141e2aa21f4b35ee27072d84e9aa6e2ba0 upstream.
    
    ath9k_htc adds padding between the 802.11 header and the payload during
    TX by moving the header. When handing the frame back to mac80211 for TX
    status handling the header is not moved back into its original position.
    This can result in a too small skb headroom when entering ath9k_htc
    again (due to a soft retransmission for example) causing an
    skb_under_panic oops.
    
    Fix this by moving the 802.11 header back into its original position
    before returning the frame to mac80211 as other drivers like rt2x00
    or ath5k do.

    It turns out that we missed increasing needed pages in BRK to
    mapping initial 2M and [0,1M) when we switched to use the #PF
    handler to set memory mappings:

    Before that, we had the maping from [0,512M) in head_64.S, and we
    can spare two pages [0-1M).  After that change, we can not reuse
    pages anymore.
    
    When we have more than 512M ram, we need an extra page for pgd page
    with [512G, 1024g).
    
    Increase pages in BRK for page table to solve the boot crash.

    SUNRPC: Fix memory corruption issue on 32-bit highmem systems
    
    commit 347e2233b7667e336d9f671f1a52dfa3f0416e2c upstream.
    
    Some architectures, such as ARM-32 do not return the same base address
    when you call kmap_atomic() twice on the same page.
    This causes problems for the memmove() call in the XDR helper routine
    "_shift_data_right_pages()", since it defeats the detection of
    overlapping memory ranges, and has been seen to corrupt memory.
    
    The fix is to distinguish between the case where we're doing an
    inter-page copy or not. In the former case of we know that the memory
    ranges cannot possibly overlap, so we can additionally micro-optimise
    by replacing memmove() with memcpy().

    This fixes eDP link-training failures and cases where all voltage swing

    as a fallback - we go on to do channel equalization with the last voltage

    workqueue: cond_resched() after processing each work item
    
    commit b22ce2785d97423846206cceec4efee0c4afd980 upstream.
    
    If !PREEMPT, a kworker running work items back to back can hog CPU.
    This becomes dangerous when a self-requeueing work item which is
    waiting for something to happen races against stop_machine.  Such
    self-requeueing work item would requeue itself indefinitely hogging
    the kworker and CPU it's running on while stop_machine would wait for
    that CPU to enter stop_machine while preventing anything else from
    happening on all other CPUs.  The two would deadlock.
    
    Jamie Liu reports that this deadlock scenario exists around
    scsi_requeue_run_queue() and libata port multiplier support, where one
    port may exclude command processing from other ports.  With the right
    timing, scsi_requeue_run_queue() can end up requeueing itself trying
    to execute an IO which is asked to be retried while another device has
    an exclusive access, which in turn can't make forward progress due to
    stop_machine.
    
    Fix it by invoking cond_resched() after executing each work item.

    memcg: check that kmem_cache has memcg_params before accessing it
    
    commit 6f6b8951897e487ea6f77b90ea01f70a9c363770 upstream.
    
    If the system had a few memory groups and all of them were destroyed,
    memcg_limited_groups_array_size has non-zero value, but all new caches
    are created without memcg_params, because memcg_kmem_enabled() returns
    false.
    
    We try to enumirate child caches in a few places and all of them are
    potentially dangerous.
    
    For example my kernel is compiled with CONFIG_SLAB and it crashed when I
    tryed to mount a NFS share after a few experiments with kmemcg.

    drivers/base/memory.c: fix show_mem_removable() to handle missing sections
    
    commit 21ea9f5ace3a7317cc3ba1fbc749758021a83136 upstream.
    
    "cat /sys/devices/system/memory/memory*/removable" crashed the system.
    
    The problem is that show_mem_removable() is passing a
    bad pfn to is_mem_section_removable(), which causes
    
        if (!node_online(page_to_nid(page)))
    
    to blow up.  Why is it passing in a bad pfn?
    
    The reason is that show_mem_removable() will loop sections_per_block
    times.  sections_per_block is 16, but mem->section_count is 8,
    indicating holes in this memory block.  Checking that the memory section
    is present before checking to see if the memory section is removable
    fixes the problem.

    IPC: bugfix for msgrcv with msgtyp < 0
    
    commit 368ae537e056acd3f751fa276f48423f06803922 upstream.
    
    According to 'man msgrcv': "If msgtyp is less than 0, the first message of
    the lowest type that is less than or equal to the absolute value of msgtyp
    shall be received."
    
    Bug: The kernel only returns a message if its type is 1; other messages
    with type < abs(msgtype) will never get returned.
    
    Fix: After having traversed the list to find the first message with the
    lowest type, we need to actually return that message.
    
    This regression was introduced by commit daaf74cf0867 ("ipc: refactor
    msg list search into separate function")

    SCSI: pm80xx: fix Adaptec 71605H hang
    
    commit 9504a923924d663e1953f872f0a828e6454a6cfc upstream.
    
    The IO command size is 128 bytes for these new controllers as opposed to 64
    for the old 8001 controller.
    
    The Adaptec out-of-tree driver did this correctly. After comparing the two
    this turned out to be the crucial difference.
    
    So don't hardcode the IO command size, instead use pm8001_ha->iomb_size as
    that is the correct value for both old and new controllers.

    powerpc/hvsi: Increase handshake timeout from 200ms to 400ms.
    
    commit d220980b701d838560a70de691b53be007e99e78 upstream.
    
    This solves a problem observed in kexec'ed kernel where 200ms timeout is
    too short and bootconsole fails to initialize. Console did eventually
    become workable but much later into the boot process.
    
    Observed timeout was around 260ms, but I decided to make it a little bigger
    for more reliability.
    
    This has been tested on Power7 machine with Petitboot as a primary
    bootloader and PowerNV firmware.

    commit f5f6cbb61610b7bf9d9d96db9c3979d62a424bab upstream.
    
    /proc/powerpc/lparcfg is an ancient facility (though still actively used)
    which allows access to some informations relative to the partition when
    running underneath a PAPR compliant hypervisor.
    
    It makes no sense on non-pseries machines. However, currently, not only
    can it be created on these if the kernel has pseries support, but accessing
    it on such a machine will crash due to trying to do hypervisor calls.
    
    In fact, it should also not do HV calls on older pseries that didn't have
    an hypervisor either.
    
    Finally, it has the plumbing to be a module but is a "bool" Kconfig option.
    
    This fixes the whole lot by turning it into a machine_device_initcall
    that is only created on pseries, and adding the necessary hypervisor
    check before calling the H_GET_EM_PARMS hypercall

    powerpc: Work around gcc miscompilation of __pa() on 64-bit
    
    commit bdbc29c19b2633b1d9c52638fb732bcde7a2031a upstream.
    
    On 64-bit, __pa(&static_var) gets miscompiled by recent versions of
    gcc as something like:
    
            addis 3,2,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@ha
            addi 3,3,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@l
    
    This ends up effectively ignoring the offset, since its bottom 32 bits
    are zero, and means that the result of __pa() still has 0xC in the top
    nibble.  This happens with gcc 4.8.1, at least.
    
    To work around this, for 64-bit we make __pa() use an AND operator,
    and for symmetry, we make __va() use an OR operator.  Using an AND
    operator rather than a subtraction ends up with slightly shorter code
    since it can be done with a single clrldi instruction, whereas it
    takes three instructions to form the constant (-PAGE_OFFSET) and add
    it on.  (Note that MEMORY_START is always 0 on 64-bit.)

    ALSA: opti9xx: Fix conflicting driver object name
    
    commit fb615499f0ad28ed74201c1cdfddf9e64e205424 upstream.
    
    The recent commit to delay the release of kobject triggered NULL
    dereferences of opti9xx drivers.  The cause is that all
    snd-opti92x-ad1848, snd-opti92x-cs4231 and snd-opti93x drivers
    register the PnP card driver with the very same name, and also
    snd-opti92x-ad1848 and -cs4231 drivers register the ISA driver with
    the same name, too.  When these drivers are built in, quick
    "register-release-and-re-register" actions occur, and this results in
    Oops because of the same name is assigned to the kobject.
    
    The fix is simply to assign individual names.  As a bonus, by using
    KBUILD_MODNAME, the patch reduces more lines than it adds.
    
    The fix is based on the suggestion by Russell King.

    commit 2ca320e294a738c9134a71b5029de05edbfc7aad upstream.
    
    Without the dynamic minor assignment, HDMI codec may have less PCM
    instances than the number of pins, which eventually leads to Oops.

    jfs: fix readdir cookie incompatibility with NFSv4
    
    commit 44512449c0ab368889dd13ae0031fba74ee7e1d2 upstream.
    
    NFSv4 reserves readdir cookie values 0-2 for special entries (. and ..),
    but jfs allows a value of 2 for a non-special entry. This incompatibility
    can result in the nfs client reporting a readdir loop.
    
    This patch doesn't change the value stored internally, but adds one to
    the value exposed to the iterate method.
