    net: ethernet: pcnet32: Setup the SRAM and NOUFLO on Am79C97{3, 5}
    
    commit 87f966d97b89774162df04d2106c6350c8fe4cb3 upstream.
    
    On a MIPS Malta board, tons of fifo underflow errors have been observed
    when using u-boot as bootloader instead of YAMON. The reason for that
    is that YAMON used to set the pcnet device to SRAM mode but u-boot does
    not. As a result, the default Tx threshold (64 bytes) is now too small to
    keep the fifo relatively used and it can result to Tx fifo underflow errors.
    As a result of which, it's best to setup the SRAM on supported controllers
    so we can always use the NOUFLO bit.

    Commit 746c9e9f92dd "of/base: Fix PowerPC address parsing hack" limited
    the applicability of the workaround whereby a missing ranges is treated
    as an empty ranges.  This workaround was hiding a bug in the etsec2
    device tree nodes, which have children with reg, but did not have
    ranges.

    hfsplus: fix B-tree corruption after insertion at position 0
    
    commit 98cf21c61a7f5419d82f847c4d77bf6e96a76f5f upstream.
    
    Fix B-tree corruption when a new record is inserted at position 0 in the
    node in hfs_brec_insert().  In this case a hfs_brec_update_parent() is
    called to update the parent index node (if exists) and it is passed
    hfs_find_data with a search_key containing a newly inserted key instead
    of the key to be updated.  This results in an inconsistent index node.
    The bug reproduces on my machine after an extents overflow record for
    the catalog file (CNID=4) is inserted into the extents overflow B-tree.
    Because of a low (reserved) value of CNID=4, it has to become the first
    record in the first leaf node.
    
    The resulting first leaf node is correct:
    
      ----------------------------------------------------
      | key0.CNID=4 | key1.CNID=123 | key2.CNID=456, ... |
      ----------------------------------------------------
    
    But the parent index key0 still contains the previous key CNID=123:
    
      -----------------------
      | key0.CNID=123 | ... |
      -----------------------
    
    A change in hfs_brec_insert() makes hfs_brec_update_parent() work
    correctly by preventing it from getting fd->record=-1 value from
    __hfs_brec_find().
    
    Along the way, I removed duplicate code with unification of the if
    condition.  The resulting code is equivalent to the original code
    because node is never 0.
    
    Also hfs_brec_update_parent() will now return an error after getting a
    negative fd->record value.  However, the return value of
    hfs_brec_update_parent() is not checked anywhere in the file and I'm
    leaving it unchanged by this patch.  brec.c lacks error checking after
    some other calls too, but this issue is of less importance than the one
    being fixed by this patch.

    perf: Fix irq_work 'tail' recursion
    
    commit d525211f9d1be8b523ec7633f080f2116f5ea536 upstream.
    
    Vince reported a watchdog lockup like:
    
            [<ffffffff8115e114>] perf_tp_event+0xc4/0x210
            [<ffffffff810b4f8a>] perf_trace_lock+0x12a/0x160
            [<ffffffff810b7f10>] lock_release+0x130/0x260
            [<ffffffff816c7474>] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x24/0x40
            [<ffffffff8107bb4d>] do_send_sig_info+0x5d/0x80
            [<ffffffff811f69df>] send_sigio_to_task+0x12f/0x1a0
            [<ffffffff811f71ce>] send_sigio+0xae/0x100
            [<ffffffff811f72b7>] kill_fasync+0x97/0xf0
            [<ffffffff8115d0b4>] perf_event_wakeup+0xd4/0xf0
            [<ffffffff8115d103>] perf_pending_event+0x33/0x60
            [<ffffffff8114e3fc>] irq_work_run_list+0x4c/0x80
            [<ffffffff8114e448>] irq_work_run+0x18/0x40
            [<ffffffff810196af>] smp_trace_irq_work_interrupt+0x3f/0xc0
            [<ffffffff816c99bd>] trace_irq_work_interrupt+0x6d/0x80
    
    Which is caused by an irq_work generating new irq_work and therefore
    not allowing forward progress.
    
    This happens because processing the perf irq_work triggers another
    perf event (tracepoint stuff) which in turn generates an irq_work ad
    infinitum.
    
    Avoid this by raising the recursion counter in the irq_work -- which
    effectively disables all software events (including tracepoints) from
    actually triggering again.

    mac80211: disable u-APSD queues by default
    
    commit aa75ebc275b2a91b193654a177daf900ad6703f0 upstream.
    
    Some APs experience problems when working with
    U-APSD. Decreasing the probability of that
    happening by using legacy mode for all ACs but VO
    isn't enough.
    
    Cisco 4410N originally forced us to enable VO by
    default only because it treated non-VO ACs as
    legacy.
    
    However some APs (notably Netgear R7000) silently
    reclassify packets to different ACs. Since u-APSD
    ACs require trigger frames for frame retrieval
    clients would never see some frames (e.g. ARP
    responses) or would fetch them accidentally after
    a long time.
    
    It makes little sense to enable u-APSD queues by
    default because it needs userspace applications to
    be aware of it to actually take advantage of the
    possible additional powersavings. Implicitly
    depending on driver autotrigger frame support
    doesn't make much sense.

    nl80211: ignore HT/VHT capabilities without QoS/WMM
    
    commit 496fcc294daab18799e190c0264863d653588d1f upstream.
    
    As HT/VHT depend heavily on QoS/WMM, it's not a good idea to
    let userspace add clients that have HT/VHT but not QoS/WMM.
    Since it does so in certain cases we've observed (client is
    using HT IEs but not QoS/WMM) just ignore the HT/VHT info at
    this point and don't pass it down to the drivers which might
    unconditionally use it.

    tcm_qla2xxx: Fix incorrect use of __transport_register_session
    
    commit 75c3d0bf9caebb502e96683b2bc37f9692437e68 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes the incorrect use of __transport_register_session()
    in tcm_qla2xxx_check_initiator_node_acl() code, that does not perform
    explicit se_tpg->session_lock when accessing se_tpg->tpg_sess_list
    to add new se_sess nodes.
    
    Given that tcm_qla2xxx_check_initiator_node_acl() is not called with
    qla_hw->hardware_lock held for all accesses of ->tpg_sess_list, the
    code should be using transport_register_session() instead.

    ASoC: tas5086: Fix wrong value references for boolean kctl
    
    commit 4c523ef61160b7d478371ddc9f48c8ce0a00d675 upstream.
    
    The correct values referred by a boolean control are
    value.integer.value[], not value.enumerated.item[].
    The former is long while the latter is int, so it's even incompatible
    on 64bit architectures.

    ASoC: sgtl5000: remove useless register write clearing CHRGPUMP_POWERUP
    
    commit c7d910b87d3c8e9fcf4077089ca4327c12eee099 upstream.
    
    The SGTL5000_CHIP_ANA_POWER register is cached. Update the cached
    value instead of writing it directly.
    
    Patch inspired by Russell King's more colorful remarks in this
    patch:
