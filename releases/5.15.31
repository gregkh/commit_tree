    btrfs: skip reserved bytes warning on unmount after log cleanup failure
    
    commit 40cdc509877bacb438213b83c7541c5e24a1d9ec upstream.
    
    After the recent changes made by commit c2e39305299f01 ("btrfs: clear
    extent buffer uptodate when we fail to write it") and its followup fix,
    commit 651740a5024117 ("btrfs: check WRITE_ERR when trying to read an
    extent buffer"), we can now end up not cleaning up space reservations of
    log tree extent buffers after a transaction abort happens, as well as not
    cleaning up still dirty extent buffers.
    
    This happens because if writeback for a log tree extent buffer failed,
    then we have cleared the bit EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE from the extent buffer
    and we have also set the bit EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR on it. Later on,
    when trying to free the log tree with free_log_tree(), which iterates
    over the tree, we can end up getting an -EIO error when trying to read
    a node or a leaf, since read_extent_buffer_pages() returns -EIO if an
    extent buffer does not have EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE set and has the
    EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR bit set. Getting that -EIO means that we return
    immediately as we can not iterate over the entire tree.
    
    In that case we never update the reserved space for an extent buffer in
    the respective block group and space_info object.
    
    When this happens we get the following traces when unmounting the fs:

    This also means that in case we have log tree extent buffers that are
    still dirty, we can end up not cleaning them up in case we find an
    extent buffer with EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR set on it, as in that case
    we have no way for iterating over the rest of the tree.
    
    This issue is very often triggered with test cases generic/475 and
    generic/648 from fstests.
    
    The issue could almost be fixed by iterating over the io tree attached to
    each log root which keeps tracks of the range of allocated extent buffers,
    log_root->dirty_log_pages, however that does not work and has some
    inconveniences:
    
    1) After we sync the log, we clear the range of the extent buffers from
       the io tree, so we can't find them after writeback. We could keep the
       ranges in the io tree, with a separate bit to signal they represent
       extent buffers already written, but that means we need to hold into
       more memory until the transaction commits.
    
       How much more memory is used depends a lot on whether we are able to
       allocate contiguous extent buffers on disk (and how often) for a log
       tree - if we are able to, then a single extent state record can
       represent multiple extent buffers, otherwise we need multiple extent
       state record structures to track each extent buffer.
       In fact, my earlier approach did that:
    
       https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/3aae7c6728257c7ce2279d6660ee2797e5e34bbd.1641300250.git.fdmanana@suse.com/
    
       However that can cause a very significant negative impact on
       performance, not only due to the extra memory usage but also because
       we get a larger and deeper dirty_log_pages io tree.
       We got a report that, on beefy machines at least, we can get such
       performance drop with fsmark for example:
    
       https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20220117082426.GE32491@xsang-OptiPlex-9020/
    
    2) We would be doing it only to deal with an unexpected and exceptional
       case, which is basically failure to read an extent buffer from disk
       due to IO failures. On a healthy system we don't expect transaction
       aborts to happen after all;
    
    3) Instead of relying on iterating the log tree or tracking the ranges
       of extent buffers in the dirty_log_pages io tree, using the radix
       tree that tracks extent buffers (fs_info->buffer_radix) to find all
       log tree extent buffers is not reliable either, because after writeback
       of an extent buffer it can be evicted from memory by the release page
       callback of the btree inode (btree_releasepage()).
    
    Since there's no way to be able to properly cleanup a log tree without
    being able to read its extent buffers from disk and without using more
    memory to track the logical ranges of the allocated extent buffers do
    the following:
    
    1) When we fail to cleanup a log tree, setup a flag that indicates that
       failure;
    
    2) Trigger writeback of all log tree extent buffers that are still dirty,
       and wait for the writeback to complete. This is just to cleanup their
       state, page states, page leaks, etc;
    
    3) When unmounting the fs, ignore if the number of bytes reserved in a
       block group and in a space_info is not 0 if, and only if, we failed to
       cleanup a log tree. Also ignore only for metadata block groups and the
       metadata space_info object.
    
    This is far from a perfect solution, but it serves to silence test
    failures such as those from generic/475 and generic/648. However having
    a non-zero value for the reserved bytes counters on unmount after a
    transaction abort, is not such a terrible thing and it's completely
    harmless, it does not affect the filesystem integrity in any way.

    perf symbols: Fix symbol size calculation condition
    
    commit 3cf6a32f3f2a45944dd5be5c6ac4deb46bcd3bee upstream.
    
    Before this patch, the symbol end address fixup to be called, needed two
    conditions being met:
    
      if (prev->end == prev->start && prev->end != curr->start)
    
    Where
      "prev->end == prev->start" means that prev is zero-long
                                 (and thus needs a fixup)
    and
      "prev->end != curr->start" means that fixup hasn't been applied yet
    
    However, this logic is incorrect in the following situation:
    
    *curr  = {rb_node = {__rb_parent_color = 278218928,
      rb_right = 0x0, rb_left = 0x0},
      start = 0xc000000000062354,
      end = 0xc000000000062354, namelen = 40, type = 2 '\002',
      binding = 0 '\000', idle = 0 '\000', ignore = 0 '\000',
      inlined = 0 '\000', arch_sym = 0 '\000', annotate2 = false,
      name = 0x1159739e "kprobe_optinsn_page\t[__builtin__kprobes]"}
    
    *prev = {rb_node = {__rb_parent_color = 278219041,
      rb_right = 0x109548b0, rb_left = 0x109547c0},
      start = 0xc000000000062354,
      end = 0xc000000000062354, namelen = 12, type = 2 '\002',
      binding = 1 '\001', idle = 0 '\000', ignore = 0 '\000',
      inlined = 0 '\000', arch_sym = 0 '\000', annotate2 = false,
      name = 0x1095486e "optinsn_slot"}
    
    In this case, prev->start == prev->end == curr->start == curr->end,
    thus the condition above thinks that "we need a fixup due to zero
    length of prev symbol, but it has been probably done, since the
    prev->end == curr->start", which is wrong.
    
    After the patch, the execution path proceeds to arch__symbols__fixup_end
    function which fixes up the size of prev symbol by adding page_size to
    its end offset.

    Input: aiptek - properly check endpoint type
    
    commit 5600f6986628dde8881734090588474f54a540a8 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported warning in usb_submit_urb() which is caused by wrong
    endpoint type. There was a check for the number of endpoints, but not
    for the type of endpoint.
    
    Fix it by replacing old desc.bNumEndpoints check with
    usb_find_common_endpoints() helper for finding endpoints

    usb: gadget: Fix use-after-free bug by not setting udc->dev.driver

    Although the bug manifested in the driver core, the real cause was a
    race with the gadget core.  dev_uevent() does:
    
            if (dev->driver)
                    add_uevent_var(env, "DRIVER=%s", dev->driver->name);
    
    and between the test and the dereference of dev->driver, the gadget
    core sets dev->driver to NULL.
    
    The race wouldn't occur if the gadget core registered its devices on
    a real bus, using the standard synchronization techniques of the
    driver core.  However, it's not necessary to make such a large change
    in order to fix this bug; all we need to do is make sure that
    udc->dev.driver is always NULL.
    
    In fact, there is no reason for udc->dev.driver ever to be set to
    anything, let alone to the value it currently gets: the address of the
    gadget's driver.  After all, a gadget driver only knows how to manage
    a gadget, not how to manage a UDC.
    
    This patch simply removes the statements in the gadget core that touch
    udc->dev.driver.

    iavf: Fix hang during reboot/shutdown
    
    [ Upstream commit b04683ff8f0823b869c219c78ba0d974bddea0b5 ]
    
    Recent commit 974578017fc1 ("iavf: Add waiting so the port is
    initialized in remove") adds a wait-loop at the beginning of
    iavf_remove() to ensure that port initialization is finished
    prior unregistering net device. This causes a regression
    in reboot/shutdown scenario because in this case callback
    iavf_shutdown() is called and this callback detaches the device,
    makes it down if it is running and sets its state to __IAVF_REMOVE.
    Later shutdown callback of associated PF driver (e.g. ice_shutdown)
    is called. That callback calls among other things sriov_disable()
    that calls indirectly iavf_remove() (see stack trace below).
    As the adapter state is already __IAVF_REMOVE then the mentioned
    loop is end-less and shutdown process hangs.
    
    The patch fixes this by checking adapter's state at the beginning
    of iavf_remove() and skips the rest of the function if the adapter
    is already in remove state (shutdown is in progress).
    
    Reproducer:
    1. Create VF on PF driven by ice or i40e driver
    2. Ensure that the VF is bound to iavf driver
    3. Reboot

    net: mscc: ocelot: fix backwards compatibility with single-chain tc-flower offload
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e0341aefcc9133f3f48683873284b169581315b ]
    
    ACL rules can be offloaded to VCAP IS2 either through chain 0, or, since
    the blamed commit, through a chain index whose number encodes a specific
    PAG (Policy Action Group) and lookup number.
    
    The chain number is translated through ocelot_chain_to_pag() into a PAG,
    and through ocelot_chain_to_lookup() into a lookup number.
    
    The problem with the blamed commit is that the above 2 functions don't
    have special treatment for chain 0. So ocelot_chain_to_pag(0) returns
    filter->pag = 224, which is in fact -32, but the "pag" field is an u8.
    
    So we end up programming the hardware with VCAP IS2 entries having a PAG
    of 224. But the way in which the PAG works is that it defines a subset
    of VCAP IS2 filters which should match on a packet. The default PAG is
    0, and previous VCAP IS1 rules (which we offload using 'goto') can
    modify it. So basically, we are installing filters with a PAG on which
    no packet will ever match. This is the hardware equivalent of adding
    filters to a chain which has no 'goto' to it.
    
    Restore the previous functionality by making ACL filters offloaded to
    chain 0 go to PAG 0 and lookup number 0. The choice of PAG is clearly
    correct, but the choice of lookup number isn't "as before" (which was to
    leave the lookup a "don't care"). However, lookup 0 should be fine,
    since even though there are ACL actions (policers) which have a
    requirement to be used in a specific lookup, that lookup is 0.

    [ Upstream commit 0f643c88c8d240eba0ea25c2e095a46515ff46e9 ]
    
    The RXCHK block will return a partial checksum of 0 if it encounters
    a problem while receiving a packet. Since a 1's complement sum can
    only produce this result if no bits are set in the received data
    stream it is fair to treat it as an invalid partial checksum and
    not pass it up the stack.

    bnx2x: fix built-in kernel driver load failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 424e7834e293936a54fcf05173f2884171adc5a3 ]
    
    Commit b7a49f73059f ("bnx2x: Utilize firmware 7.13.21.0")
    added request_firmware() logic in probe() which caused
    load failure when firmware file is not present in initrd (below),
    as access to firmware file is not feasible during probe.
    
      Direct firmware load for bnx2x/bnx2x-e2-7.13.15.0.fw failed with error -2
      Direct firmware load for bnx2x/bnx2x-e2-7.13.21.0.fw failed with error -2
    
    This patch fixes this issue by -
    
    1. Removing request_firmware() logic from the probe()
       such that .ndo_open() handle it as it used to handle
       it earlier
    
    2. Given request_firmware() is removed from probe(), so
       driver has to relax FW version comparisons a bit against
       the already loaded FW version (by some other PFs of same
       adapter) to allow different compatible/close enough FWs with which
       multiple PFs may run with (in different environments), as the
       given PF who is in probe flow has no idea now with which firmware
       file version it is going to initialize the device in ndo_open()

    drm: Don't make DRM_PANEL_BRIDGE dependent on DRM_KMS_HELPERS

      drm_dp_mst_topology.c:(.text+0x82e0): undefined reference to `drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event'
    
    This happens if panel-edp.ko has been configured with
    
      DRM_PANEL_EDP=y
      DRM_DP_HELPER=y
      DRM_KMS_HELPER=m
    
    which builds DP helpers into the kernel and KMS helpers sa a module.
    Making DRM_PANEL_EDP select DRM_KMS_HELPER resolves this problem.
    
    To avoid a resulting cyclic dependency with DRM_PANEL_BRIDGE, don't
    make the latter depend on DRM_KMS_HELPER and fix the one DRM bridge
    drivers that doesn't already select DRM_KMS_HELPER. As KMS helpers
    cannot be selected directly by the user, config symbols should avoid
    depending on it anyway.

    Currently the panel description mixes both, BPP from 1) and bus
    format from 2), which triggers a warning at panel-simple.c:615.
    
    Pick the later, set bpp=8, fix the warning.

    drm/imx: parallel-display: Remove bus flags check in imx_pd_bridge_atomic_check()

    If display timings were read from the devicetree using
    of_get_display_timing() and pixelclk-active is defined
    there, the flag DISPLAY_FLAGS_SYNC_POSEDGE/NEGEDGE is
    automatically generated. Through the function
    drm_bus_flags_from_videomode() e.g. called in the
    panel-simple driver this flag got into the bus flags,
    but then in imx_pd_bridge_atomic_check() the bus flag
    check failed and will not initialize the display. The
    original commit fe141cedc433 does not explain why this
    check was introduced. So remove the bus flags check,
    because it stops the initialization of the display with
    valid bus flags.

    to clear 12 bytes that might be copied to user space later.

    esp6: fix check on ipv6_skip_exthdr's return value
    
    [ Upstream commit 4db4075f92af2b28f415fc979ab626e6b37d67b6 ]
    
    Commit 5f9c55c8066b ("ipv6: check return value of ipv6_skip_exthdr")
    introduced an incorrect check, which leads to all ESP packets over
    either TCPv6 or UDPv6 encapsulation being dropped. In this particular
    case, offset is negative, since skb->data points to the ESP header in
    the following chain of headers, while skb->network_header points to
    the IPv6 header:
    
        IPv6 | ext | ... | ext | UDP | ESP | ...
    
    That doesn't seem to be a problem, especially considering that if we
    reach esp6_input_done2, we're guaranteed to have a full set of headers
    available (otherwise the packet would have been dropped earlier in the
    stack). However, it means that the return value will (intentionally)
    be negative. We can make the test more specific, as the expected
    return value of ipv6_skip_exthdr will be the (negated) size of either
    a UDP header, or a TCP header with possible options.
    
    In the future, we should probably either make ipv6_skip_exthdr
    explicitly accept negative offsets (and adjust its return value for
    error cases), or make ipv6_skip_exthdr only take non-negative
    offsets (and audit all callers).

    vsock: each transport cycles only on its own sockets
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e6ed963763fe21429eabfc76c69ce2b0163a3dd ]
    
    When iterating over sockets using vsock_for_each_connected_socket, make
    sure that a transport filters out sockets that don't belong to the
    transport.
    
    There actually was an issue caused by this; in a nested VM
    configuration, destroying the nested VM (which often involves the
    closing of /dev/vhost-vsock if there was h2g connections to the nested
    VM) kills not only the h2g connections, but also all existing g2h
    connections to the (outmost) host which are totally unrelated.
    
    Tested: Executed the following steps on Cuttlefish (Android running on a
    VM) [1]: (1) Enter into an `adb shell` session - to have a g2h
    connection inside the VM, (2) open and then close /dev/vhost-vsock by
    `exec 3< /dev/vhost-vsock && exec 3<&-`, (3) observe that the adb
    session is not reset.

    alx: acquire mutex for alx_reinit in alx_change_mtu
    
    [ Upstream commit 46b348fd2d81a341b15fb3f3f986204b038f5c42 ]
    
    alx_reinit has a lockdep assertion that the alx->mtx mutex must be held.
    alx_reinit is called from two places: alx_reset and alx_change_mtu.
    alx_reset does acquire alx->mtx before calling alx_reinit.
    alx_change_mtu does not acquire this mutex, nor do its callers or any
    path towards alx_change_mtu.
    Acquire the mutex in alx_change_mtu.
    
    The issue was introduced when the fine-grained locking was introduced
    to the code to replace the RTNL. The same commit also introduced the
    lockdep assertion.

    [ Upstream commit 9feaf8b387ee0ece9c1d7add308776b502a35d0c ]
    
    When "dump_apple_properties" is used on the kernel boot command line,
    it causes an Unknown parameter message and the string is added to init's
    argument strings:
    
      Unknown kernel command line parameters "dump_apple_properties
        BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/bzImage-517rc6 efivar_ssdt=newcpu_ssdt", will be
        passed to user space.
    
     Run /sbin/init as init process
       with arguments:
         /sbin/init
         dump_apple_properties
       with environment:
         HOME=/
         TERM=linux
         BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/bzImage-517rc6
         efivar_ssdt=newcpu_ssdt
    
    Similarly when "efivar_ssdt=somestring" is used, it is added to the
    Unknown parameter message and to init's environment strings, polluting
    them (see examples above).
    
    Change the return value of the __setup functions to 1 to indicate
    that the __setup options have been handled.

    block: release rq qos structures for queue without disk
    
    commit daaca3522a8e67c46e39ef09c1d542e866f85f3b upstream.
    
    blkcg_init_queue() may add rq qos structures to request queue, previously
    blk_cleanup_queue() calls rq_qos_exit() to release them, but commit
    8e141f9eb803 ("block: drain file system I/O on del_gendisk")
    moves rq_qos_exit() into del_gendisk(), so memory leak is caused
    because queues may not have disk, such as un-present scsi luns, nvme
    admin queue, ...
    
    Fixes the issue by adding rq_qos_exit() to blk_cleanup_queue() back.
    
    BTW, v5.18 won't need this patch any more since we move
    blkcg_init_queue()/blkcg_exit_queue() into disk allocation/release
    handler, and patches have been in for-5.18/block.

    mm: swap: get rid of livelock in swapin readahead
    
    commit 029c4628b2eb2ca969e9bf979b05dc18d8d5575e upstream.
    
    In our testing, a livelock task was found.  Through sysrq printing, same
    stack was found every time, as follows:
    
      __swap_duplicate+0x58/0x1a0
      swapcache_prepare+0x24/0x30
      __read_swap_cache_async+0xac/0x220
      read_swap_cache_async+0x58/0xa0
      swapin_readahead+0x24c/0x628
      do_swap_page+0x374/0x8a0
      __handle_mm_fault+0x598/0xd60
      handle_mm_fault+0x114/0x200
      do_page_fault+0x148/0x4d0
      do_translation_fault+0xb0/0xd4
      do_mem_abort+0x50/0xb0
    
    The reason for the livelock is that swapcache_prepare() always returns
    EEXIST, indicating that SWAP_HAS_CACHE has not been cleared, so that it
    cannot jump out of the loop.  We suspect that the task that clears the
    SWAP_HAS_CACHE flag never gets a chance to run.  We try to lower the
    priority of the task stuck in a livelock so that the task that clears
    the SWAP_HAS_CACHE flag will run.  The results show that the system
    returns to normal after the priority is lowered.
    
    In our testing, multiple real-time tasks are bound to the same core, and
    the task in the livelock is the highest priority task of the core, so
    the livelocked task cannot be preempted.
    
    Although cond_resched() is used by __read_swap_cache_async, it is an
    empty function in the preemptive system and cannot achieve the purpose
    of releasing the CPU.  A high-priority task cannot release the CPU
    unless preempted by a higher-priority task.  But when this task is
    already the highest priority task on this core, other tasks will not be
    able to be scheduled.  So we think we should replace cond_resched() with
    schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1), schedule_timeout_interruptible will
    call set_current_state first to set the task state, so the task will be
    removed from the running queue, so as to achieve the purpose of giving
    up the CPU and prevent it from running in kernel mode for too long.
    
    (akpm: ugly hack becomes uglier.  But it fixes the issue in a
    backportable-to-stable fashion while we hopefully work on something
    better)

    crypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled
    
    commit a680b1832ced3b5fa7c93484248fd221ea0d614b upstream.
    
    The generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destination
    buffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()
    can run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled with
    randomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed since
    qcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue can
    be reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:
    
        kcapi-rng -b 9000000 > OUTFILE
    
    The generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all
    zeros, and this is caused by the code where the test
    'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.
    
    Let's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns
    with a full buffer if the function returns success. Let's also have
    qcom_rng_generate() return the correct value.
    
    Here's some statistics from the ent project
    (https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about the
    quality of the generated numbers:
    
        $ ent -c qcom-random-before
        Value Char Occurrences Fraction
          0           606748   0.067416
          1            33104   0.003678
          2            33001   0.003667
        ...
        253   �        32883   0.003654
        254   �        33035   0.003671
        255   �        33239   0.003693
    
        Total:       9000000   1.000000
    
        Entropy = 7.811590 bits per byte.
    
        Optimum compression would reduce the size
        of this 9000000 byte file by 2 percent.
    
        Chi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 9329962.81, and
        randomly would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the
        times.
    
        Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 119.3731 (127.5 = random).
        Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.197293333 (error 1.77 percent).
        Serial correlation coefficient is 0.159130 (totally uncorrelated =
        0.0).
    
    Without this patch, the results of the chi-square test is 0.01%, and
    the numbers are certainly not random according to ent's project page.
    The results improve with this patch:
    
        $ ent -c qcom-random-after
        Value Char Occurrences Fraction
          0            35432   0.003937
          1            35127   0.003903
          2            35424   0.003936
        ...
        253   �        35201   0.003911
        254   �        34835   0.003871
        255   �        35368   0.003930
    
        Total:       9000000   1.000000
    
        Entropy = 7.999979 bits per byte.
    
        Optimum compression would reduce the size
        of this 9000000 byte file by 0 percent.
    
        Chi square distribution for 9000000 samples is 258.77, and randomly
        would exceed this value 42.24 percent of the times.
    
        Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5006 (127.5 = random).
        Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141277333 (error 0.01 percent).
        Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000468 (totally uncorrelated =
        0.0).
    
    This change was tested on a Nexus 5 phone (msm8974 SoC).
