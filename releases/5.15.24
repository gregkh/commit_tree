    iommu: Fix potential use-after-free during probe
    
    commit b54240ad494300ff0994c4539a531727874381f4 upstream.
    
    Kasan has reported the following use after free on dev->iommu.
    when a device probe fails and it is in process of freeing dev->iommu
    in dev_iommu_free function, a deferred_probe_work_func runs in parallel
    and tries to access dev->iommu->fwspec in of_iommu_configure path thus
    causing use after free.

    perf: Fix list corruption in perf_cgroup_switch()
    
    commit 5f4e5ce638e6a490b976ade4a40017b40abb2da0 upstream.
    
    There's list corruption on cgrp_cpuctx_list. This happens on the
    following path:
    
      perf_cgroup_switch: list_for_each_entry(cgrp_cpuctx_list)
          cpu_ctx_sched_in
             ctx_sched_in
                ctx_pinned_sched_in

                      perf_cgroup_event_disable: remove the event from the list
    
    Use list_for_each_entry_safe() to allow removing an entry during
    iteration.

    scsi: lpfc: Reduce log messages seen after firmware download
    
    commit 5852ed2a6a39c862c8a3fdf646e1f4e01b91d710 upstream.
    
    Messages around firmware download were incorrectly tagged as being related
    to discovery trace events. Thus, firmware download status ended up dumping
    the trace log as well as the firmware update message. As there were a
    couple of log messages in this state, the trace log was dumped multiple
    times.
    
    Resolve this by converting from trace events to SLI events.

    scsi: lpfc: Remove NVMe support if kernel has NVME_FC disabled
    
    commit c80b27cfd93ba9f5161383f798414609e84729f3 upstream.
    
    The driver is initiating NVMe PRLIs to determine device NVMe support.  This
    should not be occurring if CONFIG_NVME_FC support is disabled.
    
    Correct this by changing the default value for FC4 support. Currently it
    defaults to FCP and NVMe. With change, when NVME_FC support is not enabled
    in the kernel, the default value is just FCP.

    Makefile.extrawarn: Move -Wunaligned-access to W=1
    
    commit 1cf5f151d25fcca94689efd91afa0253621fb33a upstream.
    
    -Wunaligned-access is a new warning in clang that is default enabled for
    arm and arm64 under certain circumstances within the clang frontend (see
    LLVM commit below). On v5.17-rc2, an ARCH=arm allmodconfig build shows
    1284 total/70 unique instances of this warning (most of the instances
    are in header files), which is quite noisy.
    
    To keep a normal build green through CONFIG_WERROR, only show this
    warning with W=1, which will allow automated build systems to catch new
    instances of the warning so that the total number can be driven down to
    zero eventually since catching unaligned accesses at compile time would
    be generally useful.

    x86/sgx: Silence softlockup detection when releasing large enclaves
    
    commit 8795359e35bc33bf86b6d0765aa7f37431db3b9c upstream.
    
    Vijay reported that the "unclobbered_vdso_oversubscribed" selftest
    triggers the softlockup detector.
    
    Actual SGX systems have 128GB of enclave memory or more.  The
    "unclobbered_vdso_oversubscribed" selftest creates one enclave which
    consumes all of the enclave memory on the system. Tearing down such a
    large enclave takes around a minute, most of it in the loop where
    the EREMOVE instruction is applied to each individual 4k enclave page.
    
    Spending one minute in a loop triggers the softlockup detector.
    
    Add a cond_resched() to give other tasks a chance to run and placate
    the softlockup detector.

    hwmon: (dell-smm) Speed up setting of fan speed
    
    commit c0d79987a0d82671bff374c07f2201f9bdf4aaa2 upstream.
    
    When setting the fan speed, i8k_set_fan() calls i8k_get_fan_status(),
    causing an unnecessary SMM call since from the two users of this
    function, only i8k_ioctl_unlocked() needs to know the new fan status
    while dell_smm_write() ignores the new fan status.
    Since SMM calls can be very slow while also making error reporting
    difficult for dell_smm_write(), remove the function call from
    i8k_set_fan() and call it separately in i8k_ioctl_unlocked().
    
    Tested on a Dell Inspiron 3505.

    signal: HANDLER_EXIT should clear SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE
    
    commit 5c72263ef2fbe99596848f03758ae2dc593adf2c upstream.
    
    Fatal SIGSYS signals (i.e. seccomp RET_KILL_* syscall filter actions)
    were not being delivered to ptraced pid namespace init processes. Make
    sure the SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE doesn't get set for these cases.

    If seccomp tries to kill a process, it should never see that process
    again. To enforce this proactively, switch the mode to something
    impossible. If encountered: WARN, reject all syscalls, and attempt to
    kill the process again even harder.

              INFO: lockdep is turned off.
    
    In this example a slab allocation from __send_signal() caused a
    refilling and draining of a percpu objcg stock, resulted in a releasing
    of another non-related objcg.  Objcg release path requires taking the
    css_set_lock, which is used to synchronize objcg lists.
    
    This can create a circular dependency with the sighandler lock, which is
    taken with the locked css_set_lock by the freezer code (to freeze a
    task).
    
    In general it seems that using css_set_lock to synchronize objcg lists
    makes any slab allocations and deallocation with the locked css_set_lock
    and any intervened locks risky.
    
    To fix the problem and make the code more robust let's stop using
    css_set_lock to synchronize objcg lists and use a new dedicated spinlock
    instead.

    iio: buffer: Fix file related error handling in IIO_BUFFER_GET_FD_IOCTL
    
    commit c72ea20503610a4a7ba26c769357d31602769c01 upstream.
    
    If we fail to copy the just created file descriptor to userland, we
    try to clean up by putting back 'fd' and freeing 'ib'. The code uses
    put_unused_fd() for the former which is wrong, as the file descriptor
    was already published by fd_install() which gets called internally by
    anon_inode_getfd().
    
    This makes the error handling code leaving a half cleaned up file
    descriptor table around and a partially destructed 'file' object,
    allowing userland to play use-after-free tricks on us, by abusing
    the still usable fd and making the code operate on a dangling
    'file->private_data' pointer.
    
    Instead of leaving the kernel in a partially corrupted state, don't
    attempt to explicitly clean up and leave this to the process exit
    path that'll release any still valid fds, including the one created
    by the previous call to anon_inode_getfd(). Simply return -EFAULT to
    indicate the error.

    USB: serial: ch341: add support for GW Instek USB2.0-Serial devices
    
    commit fa77ce201f7f2d823b07753575122d1ae5597fbe upstream.
    
    Programmable lab power supplies made by GW Instek, such as the
    GPP-2323, have a USB port exposing a serial port to control the device.
    
    Stringing the supplied Windows driver, references to the ch341 chip are
    found. Binding the existing ch341 driver to the VID/PID of the GPP-2323
    ("GW Instek USB2.0-Serial" as per the USB product name) works out of the
    box, communication and control is now possible.
    
    This patch should work with any GPP series power supply due to
    similarities in the product line.

    usb: raw-gadget: fix handling of dual-direction-capable endpoints
    
    commit 292d2c82b105d92082c2120a44a58de9767e44f1 upstream.
    
    Under dummy_hcd, every available endpoint is *either* IN or OUT capable.
    But with some real hardware, there are endpoints that support both IN and
    OUT. In particular, the PLX 2380 has four available endpoints that each
    support both IN and OUT.
    
    raw-gadget currently gets confused and thinks that any endpoint that is
    usable as an IN endpoint can never be used as an OUT endpoint.
    
    Fix it by looking at the direction in the configured endpoint descriptor
    instead of looking at the hardware capabilities.
    
    With this change, I can use the PLX 2380 with raw-gadget.

    usb: gadget: f_uac2: Define specific wTerminalType
    
    commit 5432184107cd0013761bdfa6cb6079527ef87b95 upstream.
    
    Several users have reported that their Win10 does not enumerate UAC2
    gadget with the existing wTerminalType set to
    UAC_INPUT_TERMINAL_UNDEFINED/UAC_INPUT_TERMINAL_UNDEFINED, e.g.
    https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/4587#issuecomment-926567213.
    While the constant is officially defined by the USB terminal types
    document, e.g. XMOS firmware for UAC2 (commonly used for Win10) defines
    no undefined output terminal type in its usbaudio20.h header.
    
    Therefore wTerminalType of EP-IN is set to
    UAC_INPUT_TERMINAL_MICROPHONE and wTerminalType of EP-OUT to
    UAC_OUTPUT_TERMINAL_SPEAKER for the UAC2 gadget.

    commit 117b4e96c7f362eb6459543883fc07f77662472c upstream.
    
    With CPU re-ordering on write instructions, there might
    be a chance that the HWO is set before the TRB is updated
    with the new mapped buffer address.
    And in the case where core is processing a list of TRBs
    it is possible that it fetched the TRBs when the HWO is set
    but before the buffer address is updated.
    Prevent this by adding a memory barrier before the HWO
    is updated to ensure that the core always process the
    updated TRBs.

    net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup
    
    commit 57bc3d3ae8c14df3ceb4e17d26ddf9eeab304581 upstream.
    
    ax88179_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can be
    triggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular:
    
     - The metadata array (hdr_off..hdr_off+2*pkt_cnt) can be out of bounds,
       causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips.
     - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB
       endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already
       been handed off into the network stack.
     - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end,
       causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB's
       data.
    
    I have tested that this can be used by a malicious USB device to send a
    bogus ICMPv6 Echo Request and receive an ICMPv6 Echo Reply in response
    that contains random kernel heap data.
    It's probably also possible to get OOB writes from this on a
    little-endian system somehow - maybe by triggering skb_cow() via IP
    options processing -, but I haven't tested that.

    usb: dwc2: drd: fix soft connect when gadget is unconfigured
    
    commit 269cbcf7b72de6f0016806d4a0cec1d689b55a87 upstream.
    
    When the gadget driver hasn't been (yet) configured, and the cable is
    connected to a HOST, the SFTDISCON gets cleared unconditionally, so the
    HOST tries to enumerate it.
    At the host side, this can result in a stuck USB port or worse. When
    getting lucky, some dmesg can be observed at the host side:
     new high-speed USB device number ...
     device descriptor read/64, error -110
    
    Fix it in drd, by checking the enabled flag before calling
    dwc2_hsotg_core_connect(). It will be called later, once configured,
    by the normal flow:
    - udc_bind_to_driver
     - usb_gadget_connect
       - dwc2_hsotg_pullup
         - dwc2_hsotg_core_connect

    offset and page boundary, the cast to u8 overflows.  And this is common
    when user space tries to read the entire EEPROM at once.
    
    To fix it, limit each read to I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX (32) bytes, already
    the maximum length i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated() allows.

    n_tty: wake up poll(POLLRDNORM) on receiving data
    
    commit c816b2e65b0e86b95011418cad334f0524fc33b8 upstream.
    
    The poll man page says POLLRDNORM is equivalent to POLLIN when used as
    an event.
    $ man poll
    <snip>
                  POLLRDNORM
                         Equivalent to POLLIN.
    
    However, in n_tty driver, POLLRDNORM does not return until timeout even
    if there is terminal input, whereas POLLIN returns.
    
    The following test program works until kernel-3.17, but the test stops
    in poll() after commit 57087d515441 ("tty: Fix spurious poll() wakeups").
    
    [Steps to run test program]
      $ cc -o test-pollrdnorm test-pollrdnorm.c
      $ ./test-pollrdnorm
      foo          <-- Type in something from the terminal followed by [RET].
                       The string should be echoed back.
    
      ------------------------< test-pollrdnorm.c >------------------------
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <errno.h>
      #include <poll.h>
      #include <unistd.h>
    
      void main(void)
      {
            int             n;
            unsigned char   buf[8];
            struct pollfd   fds[1] = {{ 0, POLLRDNORM, 0 }};
    
            n = poll(fds, 1, -1);
            if (n < 0)
                    perror("poll");
            n = read(0, buf, 8);
            if (n < 0)
                    perror("read");
            if (n > 0)
                    write(1, buf, n);
      }
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The attached patch fixes this problem.  Many calls to
    wake_up_interruptible_poll() in the kernel source code already specify
    "POLLIN | POLLRDNORM".

    commit 28cb138f559f8c1a1395f5564f86b8bbee83631b upstream.
    
    in vt_setactivate an almost identical code path has been patched
    with array_index_nospec. In the VT_ACTIVATE path the user input
    is from a system call argument instead of a usercopy.
    For consistency both code paths should have the same mitigations
    applied.

    commit 61cc70d9e8ef5b042d4ed87994d20100ec8896d9 upstream.
    
    array_index_nospec ensures that an out-of-bounds value is set to zero
    on the transient path. Decreasing the value by one afterwards causes
    a transient integer underflow. vsa.console should be decreased first
    and then sanitized with array_index_nospec.

    [ Upstream commit 51a04ebf21122d5c76a716ecd9bfc33ea44b2b39 ]
    
    Since struct mv88e6xxx_mdio_bus *mdio_bus is the bus->priv of something
    allocated with mdiobus_alloc_size(), this means that mdiobus_free(bus)
    will free the memory backing the mdio_bus as well. Therefore, the
    mdio_bus->list element is freed memory, but we continue to iterate
    through the list of MDIO buses using that list element.
    
    To fix this, use the proper list iterator that handles element deletion
    by keeping a copy of the list element next pointer.

    ice: Avoid RTNL lock when re-creating auxiliary device
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dbbbd01cbba831233c6ea9a3e6bfa133606d3c0 ]
    
    If a call to re-create the auxiliary device happens in a context that has
    already taken the RTNL lock, then the call flow that recreates auxiliary
    device can hang if there is another attempt to claim the RTNL lock by the
    auxiliary driver.
    
    To avoid this, any call to re-create auxiliary devices that comes from
    an source that is holding the RTNL lock (e.g. netdev notifier when
    interface exits a bond) should execute in a separate thread.  To
    accomplish this, add a flag to the PF that will be evaluated in the
    service task and dealt with there.

    ice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler
    
    [ Upstream commit bea1898f65b9b7096cb4e73e97c83b94718f1fa1 ]
    
    Currently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO
    LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is
    causing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has
    a different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem
    manifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.
    
    Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only
    is passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the
    NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.
    
    Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev
    and related braces.

    ice: fix IPIP and SIT TSO offload
    
    [ Upstream commit 46b699c50c0304cdbd725d7740073a7f9d5edb10 ]
    
    The driver was avoiding offload for IPIP (at least) frames due to
    parsing the inner header offsets incorrectly when trying to check
    lengths.
    
    This length check works for VXLAN frames but fails on IPIP frames
    because skb_transport_offset points to the inner header in IPIP
    frames, which meant the subtraction of transport_header from
    inner_network_header returns a negative value (-20).
    
    With the code before this patch, everything continued to work, but GSO
    was being used to segment, causing throughputs of 1.5Gb/s per thread.
    After this patch, throughput is more like 10Gb/s per thread for IPIP
    traffic.

    net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata
    
    [ Upstream commit 9eeabdf17fa0ab75381045c867c370f4cc75a613 ]
    
    When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata, a new
    dst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb.
    This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific
    skb.
    
    The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of
    1, which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. When
    tun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from a
    single place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never
    drop to 0 (when the skb is consumed), leading to a memory leak.
    
    Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as the
    dst+metadata refcount is already 1.

    net: do not keep the dst cache when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata
    
    [ Upstream commit cfc56f85e72f5b9c5c5be26dc2b16518d36a7868 ]
    
    When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata a new dst+metadata
    is allocated and the tunnel information from the old metadata is copied
    over there.
    
    The issue is the tunnel metadata has references to cached dst, which are
    copied along the way. When a dst+metadata refcount drops to 0 the
    metadata is freed including the cached dst entries. As they are also
    referenced in the initial dst+metadata, this ends up in UaFs.
    
    In practice the above did not happen because of another issue, the
    dst+metadata was never freed because its refcount never dropped to 0
    (this will be fixed in a subsequent patch).
    
    Fix this by initializing the dst cache after copying the tunnel
    information from the old metadata to also unshare the dst cache.

    nfp: flower: fix ida_idx not being released
    
    [ Upstream commit 7db788ad627aabff2b74d4f1a3b68516d0fee0d7 ]
    
    When looking for a global mac index the extra NFP_TUN_PRE_TUN_IDX_BIT
    that gets set if nfp_flower_is_supported_bridge is true is not taken
    into account. Consequently the path that should release the ida_index
    in cleanup is never triggered, causing messages like:
    
        nfp 0000:02:00.0: nfp: Failed to offload MAC on br-ex.
        nfp 0000:02:00.0: nfp: Failed to offload MAC on br-ex.
        nfp 0000:02:00.0: nfp: Failed to offload MAC on br-ex.
    
    after NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX number of reconfigs. Ultimately this lead to
    new tunnel flows not being offloaded.
    
    Fix this by unsetting the NFP_TUN_PRE_TUN_IDX_BIT before checking if
    the port is of type OTHER.

    net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: don't use devres for mdiobus
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d120dfb5d67edc5bcd1804e167dba2b30809afd ]
    
    As explained in commits:
    74b6d7d13307 ("net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres")
    5135e96a3dd2 ("net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres")
    
    mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-
    devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus was
    not previously unregistered.
    
    The GSWIP switch is a platform device, so the initial set of constraints
    that I thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call ->remove on
    ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which applies here.
    
    If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown
    (like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link
    between the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()
    will unbind the GSWIP switch driver on shutdown.
    
    So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which
    is: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,
    or don't use devres at all.
    
    The gswip driver has the code structure in place for orderly mdiobus
    removal, so just replace devm_mdiobus_alloc() with the non-devres
    variant, and add manual free where necessary, to ensure that we don't
    let devres free a still-registered bus.

    net: dsa: mt7530: fix kernel bug in mdiobus_free() when unbinding
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ffe3d09e32da45bb5a29cf2e80ec8d7534010c5 ]
    
    Nobody in this driver calls mdiobus_unregister(), which is necessary if
    mdiobus_register() completes successfully. So if the devres callbacks
    that free the mdiobus get invoked (this is the case when unbinding the
    driver), mdiobus_free() will BUG if the mdiobus is still registered,
    which it is.
    
    My speculation is that this is due to the fact that prior to commit
    ac3a68d56651 ("net: phy: don't abuse devres in devm_mdiobus_register()")
    from June 2020, _devm_mdiobus_free() used to call mdiobus_unregister().
    But at the time that the mt7530 support was introduced in May 2021, the
    API was already changed. It's therefore likely that the blamed patch was
    developed on an older tree, and incorrectly adapted to net-next. This
    makes the Fixes: tag correct.
    
    Fix the problem by using the devres variant of mdiobus_register.

    [ Upstream commit 209bdb7ec6a28c7cdf580a0a98afbc9fc3b98932 ]
    
    As explained in commits:
    74b6d7d13307 ("net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres")
    5135e96a3dd2 ("net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres")
    
    mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-
    devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus was
    not previously unregistered.
    
    The Felix VSC9959 switch is a PCI device, so the initial set of
    constraints that I thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call
    ->remove on ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which
    applies here.
    
    If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown
    (like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link
    between the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()
    will unbind the felix switch driver on shutdown.
    
    So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which
    is: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,
    or don't use devres at all.
    
    The felix driver has the code structure in place for orderly mdiobus
    removal, so just replace devm_mdiobus_alloc_size() with the non-devres
    variant, and add manual free where necessary, to ensure that we don't
    let devres free a still-registered bus.

    bonding: pair enable_port with slave_arr_updates
    
    [ Upstream commit 23de0d7b6f0e3f9a6283a882594c479949da1120 ]
    
    When 803.2ad mode enables a participating port, it should update
    the slave-array. I have observed that the member links are participating
    and are part of the active aggregator while the traffic is egressing via
    only one member link (in a case where two links are participating). Via
    kprobes I discovered that slave-arr has only one link added while
    the other participating link wasn't part of the slave-arr.
    
    I couldn't see what caused that situation but the simple code-walk
    through provided me hints that the enable_port wasn't always associated
    with the slave-array update.

    Setting the output of a GPIO to 1 using gpiod_set_value(), followed by
    reading the same GPIO using gpiod_get_value(), will currently yield an
    incorrect result.
    
    This is because the SiFive GPIO device stores the output values in reg_set,
    not reg_dat.
    
    Supply the flag BGPIOF_READ_OUTPUT_REG_SET to bgpio_init() so that the

    ixgbevf: Require large buffers for build_skb on 82599VF
    
    [ Upstream commit fe68195daf34d5dddacd3f93dd3eafc4beca3a0e ]
    
    From 4.17 onwards the ixgbevf driver uses build_skb() to build an skb
    around new data in the page buffer shared with the ixgbe PF.
    This uses either a 2K or 3K buffer, and offsets the DMA mapping by
    NET_SKB_PAD + NET_IP_ALIGN. When using a smaller buffer RXDCTL is set to
    ensure the PF does not write a full 2K bytes into the buffer, which is
    actually 2K minus the offset.
    
    However on the 82599 virtual function, the RXDCTL mechanism is not
    available. The driver attempts to work around this by using the SET_LPE
    mailbox method to lower the maximm frame size, but the ixgbe PF driver
    ignores this in order to keep the PF and all VFs in sync[0].
    
    This means the PF will write up to the full 2K set in SRRCTL, causing it
    to write NET_SKB_PAD + NET_IP_ALIGN bytes past the end of the buffer.
    With 4K pages split into two buffers, this means it either writes
    NET_SKB_PAD + NET_IP_ALIGN bytes past the first buffer (and into the
    second), or NET_SKB_PAD + NET_IP_ALIGN bytes past the end of the DMA
    mapping.
    
    Avoid this by only enabling build_skb when using "large" buffers (3K).
    These are placed in each half of an order-1 page, preventing the PF from
    writing past the end of the mapping.
    
    [0]: Technically it only ever raises the max frame size, see
    ixgbe_set_vf_lpe() in ixgbe_sriov.c

    [ Upstream commit 323ca765bfe9d637fa774373baec0bc41e51fcfa ]
    
    The interrupt pin of the external ethernet phy is used, instead of the
    enable-gpio pin of the tf-io regulator. The GPIOE_2 pin is located in
    the gpio_ao bank.
    
    This causes phy interrupt problems at system startup.

    netfilter: ctnetlink: disable helper autoassign
    
    [ Upstream commit d1ca60efc53d665cf89ed847a14a510a81770b81 ]
    
    When userspace, e.g. conntrackd, inserts an entry with a specified helper,
    its possible that the helper is lost immediately after its added:
    
    ctnetlink_create_conntrack
      -> nf_ct_helper_ext_add + assign helper
        -> ctnetlink_setup_nat
          -> ctnetlink_parse_nat_setup
             -> parse_nat_setup -> nfnetlink_parse_nat_setup
                                   -> nf_nat_setup_info
                                     -> nf_conntrack_alter_reply
                                       -> __nf_ct_try_assign_helper
    
    ... and __nf_ct_try_assign_helper will zero the helper again.
    
    Set IPS_HELPER bit to bypass auto-assign logic, its unwanted, just like
    when helper is assigned via ruleset.
    
    Dropped old 'not strictly necessary' comment, it referred to use of
    rcu_assign_pointer() before it got replaced by RCU_INIT_POINTER().
    
    NB: Fixes tag intentionally incorrect, this extends the referenced commit,
    but this change won't build without IPS_HELPER introduced there.

    misc: fastrpc: avoid double fput() on failed usercopy
    
    [ Upstream commit 46963e2e0629cb31c96b1d47ddd89dc3d8990b34 ]
    
    If the copy back to userland fails for the FASTRPC_IOCTL_ALLOC_DMA_BUFF
    ioctl(), we shouldn't assume that 'buf->dmabuf' is still valid. In fact,
    dma_buf_fd() called fd_install() before, i.e. "consumed" one reference,
    leaving us with none.
    
    Calling dma_buf_put() will therefore put a reference we no longer own,
    leading to a valid file descritor table entry for an already released
    'file' object which is a straight use-after-free.
    
    Simply avoid calling dma_buf_put() and rely on the process exit code to
    do the necessary cleanup, if needed, i.e. if the file descriptor is
    still valid.

    such modes.
    
    Modes with DRM_MODE_FLAG_DBLCLK double all the horizontal timing
    values before programming them into the PV. The PV values,
    therefore, can not be odd, and so the modes can be supported.
    
    Amend the filtering appropriately.

    gpio: aggregator: Fix calling into sleeping GPIO controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 2cba05451a6d0c703bb74f1a250691404f27c4f1 ]
    
    If the parent GPIO controller is a sleeping controller (e.g. a GPIO
    controller connected to I2C), getting or setting a GPIO triggers a
    might_sleep() warning.  This happens because the GPIO Aggregator takes
    the can_sleep flag into account only for its internal locking, not for
    calling into the parent GPIO controller.
    
    Fix this by using the gpiod_[gs]et*_cansleep() APIs when calling into a
    sleeping GPIO controller.

    phy: dphy: Correct clk_pre parameter
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a8406ba1a9a2965c27e0db1d7753471d12ee9ff ]
    
    The D-PHY specification (v1.2) explicitly mentions that the T-CLK-PRE
    parameter's unit is Unit Interval(UI) and the minimum value is 8.  Also,
    kernel doc of the 'clk_pre' member of struct phy_configure_opts_mipi_dphy
    mentions that it should be in UI.  However, the dphy core driver wrongly
    sets 'clk_pre' to 8000, which seems to hint that it's in picoseconds.
    
    So, let's fix the dphy core driver to correctly reflect the T-CLK-PRE
    parameter's minimum value according to the D-PHY specification.
    
    I'm assuming that all impacted custom drivers shall program values in
    TxByteClkHS cycles into hardware for the T-CLK-PRE parameter.  The D-PHY
    specification mentions that the frequency of TxByteClkHS is exactly 1/8
    the High-Speed(HS) bit rate(each HS bit consumes one UI).  So, relevant
    custom driver code is changed to program those values as
    DIV_ROUND_UP(cfg->clk_pre, BITS_PER_BYTE), then.
    
    Note that I've only tested the patch with RM67191 DSI panel on i.MX8mq EVK.
    Help is needed to test with other i.MX8mq, Meson and Rockchip platforms,
    as I don't have the hardwares.

    usb: f_fs: Fix use-after-free for epfile
    
    [ Upstream commit ebe2b1add1055b903e2acd86b290a85297edc0b3 ]
    
    Consider a case where ffs_func_eps_disable is called from
    ffs_func_disable as part of composition switch and at the
    same time ffs_epfile_release get called from userspace.
    ffs_epfile_release will free up the read buffer and call
    ffs_data_closed which in turn destroys ffs->epfiles and
    mark it as NULL. While this was happening the driver has
    already initialized the local epfile in ffs_func_eps_disable
    which is now freed and waiting to acquire the spinlock. Once
    spinlock is acquired the driver proceeds with the stale value
    of epfile and tries to free the already freed read buffer
    causing use-after-free.
    
    Following is the illustration of the race:
    
          CPU1                                  CPU2
    
       ffs_func_eps_disable
       epfiles (local copy)
                                            ffs_epfile_release
                                            ffs_data_closed
                                            if (last file closed)
                                            ffs_data_reset
                                            ffs_data_clear
                                            ffs_epfiles_destroy
    spin_lock
    dereference epfiles
    
    Fix this races by taking epfiles local copy & assigning it under
    spinlock and if epfiles(local) is null then update it in ffs->epfiles
    then finally destroy it.
    Extending the scope further from the race, protecting the ep related
    structures, and concurrent accesses.

    TX_PROT_BUS_WIDTH and RX_PROT_BUS_WIDTH are single registers with

    the PHY in SGMII mode on one lane zeroed out the settings for all other
    lanes, causing other PS-GTR peripherals such as USB3 to malfunction.
    
    Use xpsgtr_clr_set to only manipulate the desired bits in the register.

    ARM: dts: Fix timer regression for beagleboard revision c
    
    [ Upstream commit 23885389dbbbbc698986e77a45c1fc44a6e3632e ]
    
    Commit e428e250fde6 ("ARM: dts: Configure system timers for omap3")
    caused a timer regression for beagleboard revision c where the system
    clockevent stops working if omap3isp module is unloaded.
    
    Turns out we still have beagleboard revisions a-b4 capacitor c70 quirks
    applied that limit the usable timers for no good reason. This also affects
    the power management as we use the system clock instead of the 32k clock
    source.
    
    Let's fix the issue by adding a new omap3-beagle-ab4.dts for the old timer
    quirks. This allows us to remove the timer quirks for later beagleboard
    revisions. We also need to update the related timer quirk check for the
    correct compatible property.

    drm/i915: Populate pipe dbuf slices more accurately during readout
    
    commit 85bb289215cf37e05e9581b39b114db1293f9ecd upstream.
    
    During readout we cannot assume the planes are actually using the
    slices they are supposed to use. The BIOS may have misprogrammed
    things and put the planes onto the wrong dbuf slices. So let's
    do the readout more carefully to make sure we really know which
    dbuf slices are actually in use by the pipe at the time.

    drm/i915: Allow !join_mbus cases for adlp+ dbuf configuration
    
    commit 8fd5a26e43859547790a7995494c952b708ab3b5 upstream.
    
    Reintroduce the !join_mbus single pipe cases for adlp+.
    
    Due to the mbus relative dbuf offsets in PLANE_BUF_CFG we
    need to know the actual slices used by the pipe when doing
    readout, even when mbus joining isn't enabled. Accurate
    readout will be needed to properly sanitize invalid BIOS
    dbuf configurations.
    
    This will also make it much easier to play around with the
    !join_mbus configs for testin/workaround purposes.

    drm/rockchip: vop: Correct RK3399 VOP register fields
    
    commit 9da1e9ab82c92d0e89fe44cad2cd7c2d18d64070 upstream.
    
    Commit 7707f7227f09 ("drm/rockchip: Add support for afbc") switched up
    the rk3399_vop_big[] register windows, but it did so incorrectly.
    
    The biggest problem is in rk3288_win23_data[] vs.
    rk3368_win23_data[] .format field:
    
      RK3288's format: VOP_REG(RK3288_WIN2_CTRL0, 0x7, 1)
      RK3368's format: VOP_REG(RK3368_WIN2_CTRL0, 0x3, 5)
    
    Bits 5:6 (i.e., shift 5, mask 0x3) are correct for RK3399, according to
    the TRM.
    
    There are a few other small differences between the 3288 and 3368
    definitions that were swapped in commit 7707f7227f09. I reviewed them to
    the best of my ability according to the RK3399 TRM and fixed them up.
    
    This fixes IOMMU issues (and display errors) when testing with BG24
    color formats.

    PM: s2idle: ACPI: Fix wakeup interrupts handling
    
    commit cb1f65c1e1424a4b5e4a86da8aa3b8fd8459c8ec upstream.
    
    After commit e3728b50cd9b ("ACPI: PM: s2idle: Avoid possible race
    related to the EC GPE") wakeup interrupts occurring immediately after
    the one discarded by acpi_s2idle_wake() may be missed.  Moreover, if
    the SCI triggers again immediately after the rearming in
    acpi_s2idle_wake(), that wakeup may be missed too.
    
    The problem is that pm_system_irq_wakeup() only calls pm_system_wakeup()
    when pm_wakeup_irq is 0, but that's not the case any more after the
    interrupt causing acpi_s2idle_wake() to run until pm_wakeup_irq is
    cleared by the pm_wakeup_clear() call in s2idle_loop().  However,
    there may be wakeup interrupts occurring in that time frame and if
    that happens, they will be missed.
    
    To address that issue first move the clearing of pm_wakeup_irq to
    the point at which it is known that the interrupt causing
    acpi_s2idle_wake() to tun will be discarded, before rearming the SCI
    for wakeup.  Moreover, because that only reduces the size of the
    time window in which the issue may manifest itself, allow
    pm_system_irq_wakeup() to register two second wakeup interrupts in
    a row and, when discarding the first one, replace it with the second
    one.  [Of course, this assumes that only one wakeup interrupt can be
    discarded in one go, but currently that is the case and I am not
    aware of any plans to change that.]

    ACPI/IORT: Check node revision for PMCG resources
    
    commit da5fb9e1ad3fbf632dce735f1bdad257ca528499 upstream.
    
    The original version of the IORT PMCG definition had an oversight
    wherein there was no way to describe the second register page for an
    implementation using the recommended RELOC_CTRS feature. Although the
    spec was fixed, and the final patches merged to ACPICA and Linux written
    against the new version, it seems that some old firmware based on the
    original revision has survived and turned up in the wild.
    
    Add a check for the original PMCG definition, and avoid filling in the
    second memory resource with nonsense if so. Otherwise it is likely that
    something horrible will happen when the PMCG driver attempts to probe.

    nvme-tcp: fix bogus request completion when failing to send AER
    
    commit 63573807b27e0faf8065a28b1bbe1cbfb23c0130 upstream.
    
    AER is not backed by a real request, hence we should not incorrectly
    assume that when failing to send a nvme command, it is a normal request
    but rather check if this is an aer and if so complete the aer (similar
    to the normal completion path).

    ARM: socfpga: fix missing RESET_CONTROLLER
    
    commit 3037b174b1876aae6b2d1a27a878c681c78ccadc upstream.
    
    The SocFPGA machine since commit b3ca9888f35f ("reset: socfpga: add an
    early reset driver for SoCFPGA") uses reset controller, so it should
    select RESET_CONTROLLER explicitly.  Selecting ARCH_HAS_RESET_CONTROLLER
    is not enough because it affects only default choice still allowing a
    non-buildable configuration:

    commit 42c9b28e6862d16db82a56f5667cf4d1f6658cf6 upstream.
    
    Currently, SD card fails to mount due to the following pinctrl error:

    Fix it by removing the MX23_PAD_SSP1_DETECT pin from the hog group as it
    is already been used by the mmc0-pins-fixup pinctrl group.
    
    With this change the rootfs can be mounted and the imx23-evk board can
    boot successfully.

    gfs2: Fix gfs2_release for non-writers regression
    
    commit d3add1a9519dcacd6e644ecac741c56cf18b67f5 upstream.
    
    When a file is opened for writing, the vfs code (do_dentry_open)
    calls get_write_access for the inode, thus incrementing the inode's write
    count. That writer normally then creates a multi-block reservation for
    the inode (i_res) that can be re-used by other writers, which speeds up
    writes for applications that stupidly loop on open/write/close.
    When the writes are all done, the multi-block reservation should be
    deleted when the file is closed by the last "writer."
    
    Commit 0ec9b9ea4f83 broke that concept when it moved the call to
    gfs2_rs_delete before the check for FMODE_WRITE.  Non-writers have no
    business removing the multi-block reservations of writers. In fact, if
    someone opens and closes the file for RO while a writer has a
    multi-block reservation, the RO closer will delete the reservation
    midway through the write, and this results in:
    
    kernel BUG at fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:677! (or thereabouts) which is:
    BUG_ON(rs->rs_requested); from function gfs2_rs_deltree.
    
    This patch moves the check back inside the check for FMODE_WRITE.

    riscv: eliminate unreliable __builtin_frame_address(1)
    
    commit 6a00ef4493706a23120057fafbc62379bcde11ec upstream.
    
    I tried different pieces of code which uses __builtin_frame_address(1)
    (with both gcc version 7.5.0 and 10.3.0) to verify whether it works as
    expected on riscv64. The result is negative.
    
    What the compiler had generated is as below:
    31                      fp = (unsigned long)__builtin_frame_address(1);
       0xffffffff80006024 <+200>:   ld      s1,0(s0)
    
    It takes '0(s0)' as the address of frame 1 (caller), but the actual address
    should be '-16(s0)'.
    
              |       ...       | <-+
              +-----------------+   |
              | return address  |   |
              | previous fp     |   |
              | saved registers |   |
              | local variables |   |
      $fp --> |       ...       |   |
              +-----------------+   |
              | return address  |   |
              | previous fp --------+
              | saved registers |
      $sp --> | local variables |
              +-----------------+
    
    This leads the kernel can not dump the full stack trace on riscv.
    
    [    7.222126][    T1] Call Trace:
    [    7.222804][    T1] [<ffffffff80006058>] dump_backtrace+0x2c/0x3a
    
    This problem is not exposed on most riscv builds just because the '0(s0)'
    occasionally is the address frame 2 (caller's caller), if only ra and fp
    are stored in frame 1 (caller).
    
              |       ...       | <-+
              +-----------------+   |
              | return address  |   |
      $fp --> | previous fp     |   |
              +-----------------+   |

              | saved registers |
      $sp --> | local variables |
              +-----------------+
    
    This could be a *bug* of gcc that should be fixed. But as noted in gcc
    manual "Calling this function with a nonzero argument can have
    unpredictable effects, including crashing the calling program.", let's
    remove the '__builtin_frame_address(1)' in backtrace code.
    
    With this fix now it can show full stack trace:

    riscv: fix build with binutils 2.38
    
    commit 6df2a016c0c8a3d0933ef33dd192ea6606b115e3 upstream.
    
    From version 2.38, binutils default to ISA spec version 20191213. This
    means that the csr read/write (csrr*/csrw*) instructions and fence.i
    instruction has separated from the `I` extension, become two standalone
    extensions: Zicsr and Zifencei. As the kernel uses those instruction,
    this causes the following build failure:
    
      CC      arch/riscv/kernel/vdso/vgettimeofday.o
      <<BUILDDIR>>/arch/riscv/include/asm/vdso/gettimeofday.h: Assembler messages:

      <<BUILDDIR>>/arch/riscv/include/asm/vdso/gettimeofday.h:71: Error: unrecognized opcode `csrr a5,0xc01'
    
    The fix is to specify those extensions explicitely in -march. However as
    older binutils version do not support this, we first need to detect
    that.

    KVM: x86: Report deprecated x87 features in supported CPUID
    
    [ Upstream commit e3bcfda012edd3564e12551b212afbd2521a1f68 ]
    
    CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):EBX.FDP_EXCPTN_ONLY[bit 6] and
    CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):EBX.ZERO_FCS_FDS[bit 13] are "defeature"
    bits. Unlike most of the other CPUID feature bits, these bits are
    clear if the features are present and set if the features are not
    present. These bits should be reported in KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID,
    because if these bits are set on hardware, they cannot be cleared in
    the guest CPUID. Doing so would claim guest support for a feature that
    the hardware doesn't support and that can't be efficiently emulated.
    
    Of course, any software (e.g WIN87EM.DLL) expecting these features to
    be present likely predates these CPUID feature bits and therefore
    doesn't know to check for them anyway.
    
    Aaron Lewis added the corresponding X86_FEATURE macros in
    commit cbb99c0f5887 ("x86/cpufeatures: Add FDP_EXCPTN_ONLY and
    ZERO_FCS_FDS"), with the intention of reporting these bits in
    KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID, but I was unable to find a proposed patch on
    the kvm list.
    
    Opportunistically reordered the CPUID_7_0_EBX capability bits from
    least to most significant.

    KVM: VMX: Set vmcs.PENDING_DBG.BS on #DB in STI/MOVSS blocking shadow
    
    [ Upstream commit b9bed78e2fa9571b7c983b20666efa0009030c71 ]
    
    Set vmcs.GUEST_PENDING_DBG_EXCEPTIONS.BS, a.k.a. the pending single-step
    breakpoint flag, when re-injecting a #DB with RFLAGS.TF=1, and STI or
    MOVSS blocking is active.  Setting the flag is necessary to make VM-Entry
    consistency checks happy, as VMX has an invariant that if RFLAGS.TF is
    set and STI/MOVSS blocking is true, then the previous instruction must
    have been STI or MOV/POP, and therefore a single-step #DB must be pending
    since the RFLAGS.TF cannot have been set by the previous instruction,
    i.e. the one instruction delay after setting RFLAGS.TF must have already
    expired.
    
    Normally, the CPU sets vmcs.GUEST_PENDING_DBG_EXCEPTIONS.BS appropriately
    when recording guest state as part of a VM-Exit, but #DB VM-Exits
    intentionally do not treat the #DB as "guest state" as interception of
    the #DB effectively makes the #DB host-owned, thus KVM needs to manually
    set PENDING_DBG.BS when forwarding/re-injecting the #DB to the guest.
    
    Note, although this bug can be triggered by guest userspace, doing so
    requires IOPL=3, and guest userspace running with IOPL=3 has full access
    to all I/O ports (from the guest's perspective) and can crash/reboot the
    guest any number of ways.  IOPL=3 is required because STI blocking kicks
    in if and only if RFLAGS.IF is toggled 0=>1, and if CPL>IOPL, STI either
    takes a #GP or modifies RFLAGS.VIF, not RFLAGS.IF.
    
    MOVSS blocking can be initiated by userspace, but can be coincident with
    a #DB if and only if DR7.GD=1 (General Detect enabled) and a MOV DR is
    executed in the MOVSS shadow.  MOV DR #GPs at CPL>0, thus MOVSS blocking
    is problematic only for CPL0 (and only if the guest is crazy enough to
    access a DR in a MOVSS shadow).  All other sources of #DBs are either
    suppressed by MOVSS blocking (single-step, code fetch, data, and I/O),
    are mutually exclusive with MOVSS blocking (T-bit task switch), or are
    already handled by KVM (ICEBP, a.k.a. INT1).
    
    This bug was originally found by running tests[1] created for XSA-308[2].
    Note that Xen's userspace test emits ICEBP in the MOVSS shadow, which is
    presumably why the Xen bug was deemed to be an exploitable DOS from guest
    userspace.  KVM already handles ICEBP by skipping the ICEBP instruction
    and thus clears MOVSS blocking as a side effect of its "emulation".

    Inject a #GP instead of synthesizing triple fault to try to avoid killing
    the guest if emulation of an SEV guest fails due to encountering the SMAP
    erratum.  The injected #GP may still be fatal to the guest, e.g. if the

    KVM: nVMX: eVMCS: Filter out VM_EXIT_SAVE_VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a601e2cf61558dfd534a9ecaad09f5853ad8204 ]
    
    Enlightened VMCS v1 doesn't have VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER_VALUE field,
    PIN_BASED_VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER is also filtered out already so it makes
    sense to filter out VM_EXIT_SAVE_VMX_PREEMPTION_TIMER too.
    
    Note, none of the currently existing Windows/Hyper-V versions are known
    to enable 'save VMX-preemption timer value' when eVMCS is in use, the
    change is aimed at making the filtering future proof.

    perf: Always wake the parent event
    
    [ Upstream commit 961c39121759ad09a89598ec4ccdd34ae0468a19 ]
    
    When using per-process mode and event inheritance is set to true,
    forked processes will create a new perf events via inherit_event() ->
    perf_event_alloc(). But these events will not have ring buffers
    assigned to them. Any call to wakeup will be dropped if it's called on
    an event with no ring buffer assigned because that's the object that
    holds the wakeup list.
    
    If the child event is disabled due to a call to
    perf_aux_output_begin() or perf_aux_output_end(), the wakeup is
    dropped leaving userspace hanging forever on the poll.
    
    Normally the event is explicitly re-enabled by userspace after it
    wakes up to read the aux data, but in this case it does not get woken
    up so the event remains disabled.
    
    This can be reproduced when using Arm SPE and 'stress' which forks once
    before running the workload. By looking at the list of aux buffers read,
    it's apparent that they stop after the fork:
    
      perf record -e arm_spe// -vvv -- stress -c 1
    
    With this patch applied they continue to be printed. This behaviour
    doesn't happen when using systemwide or per-cpu mode.

    [ Upstream commit 62afb379a0fee7e9c2f9f68e1abeb85ceddf51b9 ]
    
    According to the comment in check_fw_ready() we should not check the
    IOP1_READY field in register SCRATCH_PAD_1 for 8008 or 8009 controllers.
    
    However we check this very field in process_oq() for processing the highest
    index interrupt vector. The highest interrupt vector is checked as the FW
    is programmed to signal fatal errors through this irq.
    
    Change that function to not check IOP1_READY for those mentioned
    controllers, but do check ILA_READY in both cases.
    
    The reason I assume that this was not hit earlier was because we always
    allocated 64 MSI(X), and just did not pass the vector index check in
    process_oq(), i.e.  the handler never ran for vector index 63.

    devm_kstrdup() returns pointer to allocated string on success, NULL on
    failure. So it is better to check the return value of it.

    [ Upstream commit a861790afaa8b6369eee8a88c5d5d73f5799c0c6 ]
    
    iscsit_tpg_check_network_portal() has nested for_each loops and is supposed
    to return true when a match is found. However, the tpg loop will still
    continue after existing the tpg_np loop. If this tpg_np is not the last the
    match value will be changed.
    
    Break the outer loop after finding a match and make sure the np under each
    tpg is unique.

    Unmapping a fixmap entry is done by calling __set_fixmap()
    with FIXMAP_PAGE_CLEAR as flags.
    
    Today, powerpc __set_fixmap() calls map_kernel_page().
    
    map_kernel_page() is not happy when called a second time
    for the same page.

    net: sched: Clarify error message when qdisc kind is unknown
    
    [ Upstream commit 973bf8fdd12f0e70ea351c018e68edd377a836d1 ]
    
    When adding a tc rule with a qdisc kind that is not supported or not
    compiled into the kernel, the kernel emits the following error: "Error:
    Specified qdisc not found.". Found via tdc testing when ETS qdisc was not
    compiled in and it was not obvious right away what the message meant
    without looking at the kernel code.
    
    Change the error message to be more explicit and say the qdisc kind is
    unknown.

    DSI device attach to DSI host will be done with host device's lock
    held.
    
    Un-registering host in "device attach" error path (ex: probe retry)

    sched: Avoid double preemption in __cond_resched_*lock*()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e406d1ff39b8ee574036418a5043c86723170cf ]
    
    For PREEMPT/DYNAMIC_PREEMPT the *_unlock() will already trigger a
    preemption, no point in then calling preempt_schedule_common()
    *again*.
    
    Use _cond_resched() instead, since this is a NOP for the preemptible
    configs while it provide a preemption point for the others.

    perf/x86/rapl: fix AMD event handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 0036fb00a756a2f6e360d44e2e3d2200a8afbc9b ]
    
    The RAPL events exposed under /sys/devices/power/events should only reflect
    what the underlying hardware actually support. This is how it works on Intel
    RAPL and Intel core/uncore PMUs in general.
    But on AMD, this was not the case. All possible RAPL events were advertised.
    
    This is what it showed on an AMD Fam17h:
    $ ls /sys/devices/power/events/
    energy-cores        energy-gpu          energy-pkg          energy-psys
    energy-ram          energy-cores.scale  energy-gpu.scale    energy-pkg.scale
    energy-psys.scale   energy-ram.scale    energy-cores.unit   energy-gpu.unit
    energy-pkg.unit     energy-psys.unit    energy-ram.unit
    
    Yet, on AMD Fam17h, only energy-pkg is supported.
    
    This patch fixes the problem. Given the way perf_msr_probe() works, the
    amd_rapl_msrs[] table has to have all entries filled out and in particular
    the group field, otherwise perf_msr_probe() defaults to making the event
    visible.
    
    With the patch applied, the kernel now only shows was is actually supported:
    
    $ ls /sys/devices/power/events/
    energy-pkg  energy-pkg.scale  energy-pkg.unit
    
    The patch also uses the RAPL_MSR_MASK because only the 32-bits LSB of the
    RAPL counters are relevant when reading power consumption.

    Instead of only servicing the lowest pending interrupt line, make sure

    net/sunrpc: fix reference count leaks in rpc_sysfs_xprt_state_change
    
    [ Upstream commit 776d794f28c95051bc70405a7b1fa40115658a18 ]
    
    The refcount leak issues take place in an error handling path. When the
    3rd argument buf doesn't match with "offline", "online" or "remove", the
    function simply returns -EINVAL and forgets to decrease the reference
    count of a rpc_xprt object and a rpc_xprt_switch object increased by
    rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt() and
    rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt_switch(), causing reference count leaks of
    both unused objects.
    
    Fix this issue by jumping to the error handling path labelled with
    out_put when buf matches none of "offline", "online" or "remove".

    thermal/drivers/int340x: Fix RFIM mailbox write commands
    
    commit 2685c77b80a80c57e2a25a726b82fb31e6e212ab upstream.
    
    The existing mail mechanism only supports writing of workload types.
    
    However, mailbox command for RFIM (cmd = 0x08) also requires write
    operation which is ignored. This results in failing to store RFI
    restriction.
    
    Fixint this requires enhancing mailbox writes for non workload
    commands too, so remove the check for MBOX_CMD_WORKLOAD_TYPE_WRITE
    in mailbox write to allow this other write commands to be supoorted.
    
    At the same time, however, we have to make sure that there is no
    impact on read commands, by avoiding to write anything into the
    mailbox data register.
    
    To properly implement that, add two separate functions for mbox read
    and write commands for the processor thermal workload command type.
    This helps to distinguish the read and write workload command types
    from each other while sending mbox commands.

    thermal/drivers/int340x: Improve the tcc offset saving for suspend/resume
    
    commit c4fcf1ada4ae63e0aab6afd19ca2e7d16833302c upstream.
    
    When the driver resumes, the tcc offset is set back to its previous
    value. But this only works if the value was user defined as otherwise
    the offset isn't saved. This asymmetric logic is harder to maintain and
    introduced some issues.
    
    Improve the logic by saving the tcc offset in a suspend op, so the right
    value is always restored after a resume.

    NFSD: Fix the behavior of READ near OFFSET_MAX
    
    commit 0cb4d23ae08c48f6bf3c29a8e5c4a74b8388b960 upstream.
    
    Dan Aloni reports:
    > Due to commit 8cfb9015280d ("NFS: Always provide aligned buffers to
    > the RPC read layers") on the client, a read of 0xfff is aligned up
    > to server rsize of 0x1000.
    >
    > As a result, in a test where the server has a file of size
    > 0x7fffffffffffffff, and the client tries to read from the offset
    > 0x7ffffffffffff000, the read causes loff_t overflow in the server
    > and it returns an NFS code of EINVAL to the client. The client as
    > a result indefinitely retries the request.
    
    The Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all
    NFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a
    READ.
    
    Instead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed
    and return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent
    the client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to
    be consistent with Solaris NFS servers.
    
    Note that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These
    must be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit
    type cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks
    against sb->s_maxbytes do not work properly.

    Ensure that a client cannot specify a WRITE range that falls in a
    byte range outside what the kernel's internal types (such as loff_t,
    which is signed) can represent. The kiocb iterators, invoked in
    nfsd_vfs_write(), should properly limit write operations to within
    the underlying file system's s_maxbytes.

    NFSD: Fix ia_size underflow
    
    commit e6faac3f58c7c4176b66f63def17a34232a17b0e upstream.
    
    iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 and
    NFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there
    is a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that is
    already larger than Linux can handle.
    
    Currently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If
    that value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_size
    underflows. I'm about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let's
    catch the underflow in the common code path: nfsd_setattr().

    NFSD: Fix NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE's handling of large file sizes
    
    commit a648fdeb7c0e17177a2280344d015dba3fbe3314 upstream.
    
    iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, so these NFSv3 procedures must be
    careful to deal with incoming client size values that are larger
    than s64_max without corrupting the value.
    
    Silently capping the value results in storing a different value
    than the client passed in which is unexpected behavior, so remove
    the min_t() check in decode_sattr3().
    
    Note that RFC 1813 permits only the WRITE procedure to return
    NFS3ERR_FBIG. We believe that NFSv3 reference implementations
    also return NFS3ERR_FBIG when ia_size is too large.

    commit aec12836e7196e4d360b2cbf20cf7aa5139ad2ec upstream.
    
    When setting up autonegotiation for 88E1118R and compatible PHYs,
    a software reset of PHY is issued before setting up polarity.
    This is incorrect as changes of MDI Crossover Mode bits are
    disruptive to the normal operation and must be followed by a
    software reset to take effect. Let's patch m88e1118_config_aneg()
    to fix the issue mentioned before by invoking software reset
    of the PHY just after setting up MDI-x polarity.

    net: phy: marvell: Fix RGMII Tx/Rx delays setting in 88e1121-compatible PHYs
    
    commit fe4f57bf7b585dca58f1496c4e2481ecbae18126 upstream.
    
    It is mandatory for a software to issue a reset upon modifying RGMII
    Receive Timing Control and RGMII Transmit Timing Control bit fields of MAC
    Specific Control register 2 (page 2, register 21) otherwise the changes
    won't be perceived by the PHY (the same is applicable for a lot of other
    registers). Not setting the RGMII delays on the platforms that imply it'
    being done on the PHY side will consequently cause the traffic loss. We
    discovered that the denoted soft-reset is missing in the
    m88e1121_config_aneg() method for the case if the RGMII delays are
    modified but the MDIx polarity isn't changed or the auto-negotiation is
    left enabled, thus causing the traffic loss on our platform with Marvell
    Alaska 88E1510 installed. Let's fix that by issuing the soft-reset if the
    delays have been actually set in the m88e1121_config_aneg_rgmii_delays()
    method.

    The following syz problem is one of the scenarios. so->rx.len is

    ima: Allow template selection with ima_template[_fmt]= after ima_hash=
    
    commit bb8e52e4906f148c2faf6656b5106cf7233e9301 upstream.
    
    Commit c2426d2ad5027 ("ima: added support for new kernel cmdline parameter
    ima_template_fmt") introduced an additional check on the ima_template
    variable to avoid multiple template selection.
    
    Unfortunately, ima_template could be also set by the setup function of the
    ima_hash= parameter, when it calls ima_template_desc_current(). This causes
    attempts to choose a new template with ima_template= or with
    ima_template_fmt=, after ima_hash=, to be ignored.
    
    Achieve the goal of the commit mentioned with the new static variable
    template_setup_done, so that template selection requests after ima_hash=
    are not ignored.
    
    Finally, call ima_init_template_list(), if not already done, to initialize
    the list of templates before lookup_template_desc() is called.

    ima: Remove ima_policy file before directory
    
    commit f7333b9572d0559e00352a926c92f29f061b4569 upstream.
    
    The removal of ima_dir currently fails since ima_policy still exists, so
    remove the ima_policy file before removing the directory.

    integrity: check the return value of audit_log_start()
    
    commit 83230351c523b04ff8a029a4bdf97d881ecb96fc upstream.
    
    audit_log_start() returns audit_buffer pointer on success or NULL on
    error, so it is better to check the return value of it.
    
    Fixes: 3323eec921ef ("integrity: IMA as an integrity service provider")
