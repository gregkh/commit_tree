    perf/core: Fix unconditional security_locked_down() call
    
    commit 08ef1af4de5fe7de9c6d69f1e22e51b66e385d9b upstream.
    
    Currently, the lockdown state is queried unconditionally, even though
    its result is used only if the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR bit is set in
    attr.sample_type. While that doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown LSM,
    it causes trouble with the SELinux's lockdown hook implementation.
    
    SELinux implements the locked_down hook with a check whether the current
    task's type has the corresponding "lockdown" class permission
    ("integrity" or "confidentiality") allowed in the policy. This means
    that calling the hook when the access control decision would be ignored
    generates a bogus permission check and audit record.
    
    Fix this by checking sample_type first and only calling the hook when
    its result would be honored.

    platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Correct thermal sensor allocation
    
    commit 6759e18e5cd8745a5dfc5726e4a3db5281ec1639 upstream.
    
    On recent Thinkpad platforms it was reported that temp sensor 11 was
    always incorrectly displaying 66C. It turns out the reason for this is
    that this location in EC RAM is not a temperature sensor but is the
    power supply ID (offset 0xC2).
    
    Based on feedback from the Lenovo firmware team the EC RAM version can
    be determined and for the current version (3) only the 0x78 to 0x7F
    range is used for temp sensors. I don't have any details for earlier
    versions so I have left the implementation unaltered there.
    
    Note - in this block only 0x78 and 0x79 are officially designated (CPU &
    GPU sensors). The use of the other locations in the block will vary from
    platform to platform; but the existing logic to detect a sensor presence
    holds.

    USB: Add reset-resume quirk for WD19's Realtek Hub
    
    commit ca91fd8c7643d93bfc18a6fec1a0d3972a46a18a upstream.
    
    Realtek Hub (0bda:5487) in Dell Dock WD19 sometimes fails to work
    after the system resumes from suspend with remote wakeup enabled
    device connected:
    [ 1947.640907] hub 5-2.3:1.0: hub_ext_port_status failed (err = -71)
    [ 1947.641208] usb 5-2.3-port5: cannot disable (err = -71)
    [ 1947.641401] hub 5-2.3:1.0: hub_ext_port_status failed (err = -71)
    [ 1947.641450] usb 5-2.3-port4: cannot reset (err = -71)
    
    Information of this hub:
    T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#= 10 Spd=480  MxCh= 5
    D:  Ver= 2.10 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=02 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1
    P:  Vendor=0bda ProdID=5487 Rev= 1.47
    S:  Manufacturer=Dell Inc.
    S:  Product=Dell dock
    C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=e0 MxPwr=  0mA
    I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=hub
    E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   1 Ivl=256ms
    I:* If#= 0 Alt= 1 #EPs= 1 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=02 Driver=hub
    E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   1 Ivl=256ms
    
    The failure results from the ETIMEDOUT by chance when turning on
    the suspend feature for the specified port of the hub. The port
    seems to be in an unknown state so the hub_activate during resume
    fails the hub_port_status, then the hub will fail to work.
    
    The quirky hub needs the reset-resume quirk to function correctly.

    ovl: allow upperdir inside lowerdir
    
    commit 708fa01597fa002599756bf56a96d0de1677375c upstream.
    
    Commit 146d62e5a586 ("ovl: detect overlapping layers") made sure we don't
    have overlapping layers, but it also broke the arguably valid use case of
    
     mount -olowerdir=/,upperdir=/subdir,..
    
    where upperdir overlaps lowerdir on the same filesystem.  This has been
    causing regressions.
    
    Revert the check, but only for the specific case where upperdir and/or
    workdir are subdirectories of lowerdir.  Any other overlap (e.g. lowerdir
    is subdirectory of upperdir, etc) case is crazy, so leave the check in
    place for those.
    
    Overlaps are detected at lookup time too, so reverting the mount time check
    should be safe.

    ovl: fix leaked dentry
    
    commit eaab1d45cdb4bb0c846bd23c3d666d5b90af7b41 upstream.
    
    Since commit 6815f479ca90 ("ovl: use only uppermetacopy state in

    commit: 3d2d861eb03e8ee96dc430a54361c900cbe28afd
    
    The PRP addressing scheme requires all PRP entries except for the
    first one to have a zero offset into the NVMe controller pages (which
    can be different from the Linux PAGE_SIZE).  Use the min_align_mask
    device parameter to ensure that swiotlb does not change the address
    of the buffer modulo the device page size to ensure that the PRPs
    won't be malformed.

    swiotlb: respect min_align_mask
    
    Respect the min_align_mask in struct device_dma_parameters in swiotlb.
    
    There are two parts to it:
     1) for the lower bits of the alignment inside the io tlb slot, just
        extent the size of the allocation and leave the start of the slot
         empty
     2) for the high bits ensure we find a slot that matches the high bits
        of the alignment to avoid wasting too much memory

    driver core: add a min_align_mask field to struct device_dma_parameters
    
    commit: 36950f2da1ea4cb683be174f6f581e25b2d33e71
    
    Some devices rely on the address offset in a page to function
    correctly (NVMe driver as an example). These devices may use
    a different page size than the Linux kernel. The address offset
    has to be preserved upon mapping, and in order to do so, we
    need to record the page_offset_mask first.

    capabilities: require CAP_SETFCAP to map uid 0
    
    [ Upstream commit db2e718a47984b9d71ed890eb2ea36ecf150de18 ]
    
    cap_setfcap is required to create file capabilities.
    
    Since commit 8db6c34f1dbc ("Introduce v3 namespaced file capabilities"),
    a process running as uid 0 but without cap_setfcap is able to work
    around this as follows: unshare a new user namespace which maps parent
    uid 0 into the child namespace.
    
    While this task will not have new capabilities against the parent
    namespace, there is a loophole due to the way namespaced file
    capabilities are represented as xattrs.  File capabilities valid in
    userns 1 are distinguished from file capabilities valid in userns 2 by
    the kuid which underlies uid 0.  Therefore the restricted root process
    can unshare a new self-mapping namespace, add a namespaced file
    capability onto a file, then use that file capability in the parent
    namespace.
    
    To prevent that, do not allow mapping parent uid 0 if the process which
    opened the uid_map file does not have CAP_SETFCAP, which is the
    capability for setting file capabilities.
    
    As a further wrinkle: a task can unshare its user namespace, then open
    its uid_map file itself, and map (only) its own uid.  In this case we do
    not have the credential from before unshare, which was potentially more
    restricted.  So, when creating a user namespace, we record whether the
    creator had CAP_SETFCAP.  Then we can use that during map_write().
    
    With this patch:
    
    1. Unprivileged user can still unshare -Ur
    
       ubuntu@caps:~$ unshare -Ur
       root@caps:~# logout
    
    2. Root user can still unshare -Ur
    
       ubuntu@caps:~$ sudo bash
       root@caps:/home/ubuntu# unshare -Ur
       root@caps:/home/ubuntu# logout
    
    3. Root user without CAP_SETFCAP cannot unshare -Ur:
    
       root@caps:/home/ubuntu# /sbin/capsh --drop=cap_setfcap --
       root@caps:/home/ubuntu# /sbin/setcap cap_setfcap=p /sbin/setcap
       unable to set CAP_SETFCAP effective capability: Operation not permitted
       root@caps:/home/ubuntu# unshare -Ur
       unshare: write failed /proc/self/uid_map: Operation not permitted
    
    Note: an alternative solution would be to allow uid 0 mappings by
    processes without CAP_SETFCAP, but to prevent such a namespace from
    writing any file capabilities.  This approach can be seen at [1].
    
    Background history: commit 95ebabde382 ("capabilities: Don't allow
    writing ambiguous v3 file capabilities") tried to fix the issue by
    preventing v3 fscaps to be written to disk when the root uid would map
    to the same uid in nested user namespaces.  This led to regressions for
    various workloads.  For example, see [2].  Ultimately this is a valid
    use-case we have to support meaning we had to revert this change in
    3b0c2d3eaa83 ("Revert 95ebabde382c ("capabilities: Don't allow writing
    ambiguous v3 file capabilities")").

    It is possible that the MHI ul_callback will be invoked immediately
    following the queueing of the skb for transmission, leading to the
    callback decrementing the refcount of the associated sk and freeing the
    skb.
    
    As such the dereference of skb and the increment of the sk refcount must
    happen before the skb is queued, to avoid the skb to be used after free
    and potentially the sk to drop its last refcount..

    bpf: Fix leakage of uninitialized bpf stack under speculation
    
    commit 801c6058d14a82179a7ee17a4b532cac6fad067f upstream.
    
    The current implemented mechanisms to mitigate data disclosure under
    speculation mainly address stack and map value oob access from the
    speculative domain. However, Piotr discovered that uninitialized BPF
    stack is not protected yet, and thus old data from the kernel stack,
    potentially including addresses of kernel structures, could still be
    extracted from that 512 bytes large window. The BPF stack is special
    compared to map values since it's not zero initialized for every
    program invocation, whereas map values /are/ zero initialized upon
    their initial allocation and thus cannot leak any prior data in either
    domain. In the non-speculative domain, the verifier ensures that every
    stack slot read must have a prior stack slot write by the BPF program
    to avoid such data leaking issue.
    
    However, this is not enough: for example, when the pointer arithmetic
    operation moves the stack pointer from the last valid stack offset to
    the first valid offset, the sanitation logic allows for any intermediate
    offsets during speculative execution, which could then be used to
    extract any restricted stack content via side-channel.
    
    Given for unprivileged stack pointer arithmetic the use of unknown
    but bounded scalars is generally forbidden, we can simply turn the
    register-based arithmetic operation into an immediate-based arithmetic
    operation without the need for masking. This also gives the benefit
    of reducing the needed instructions for the operation. Given after
    the work in 7fedb63a8307 ("bpf: Tighten speculative pointer arithmetic
    mask"), the aux->alu_limit already holds the final immediate value for
    the offset register with the known scalar. Thus, a simple mov of the
    immediate to AX register with using AX as the source for the original
    instruction is sufficient and possible now in this case.

    bpf: Fix masking negation logic upon negative dst register
    
    commit b9b34ddbe2076ade359cd5ce7537d5ed019e9807 upstream.
    
    The negation logic for the case where the off_reg is sitting in the
    dst register is not correct given then we cannot just invert the add
    to a sub or vice versa. As a fix, perform the final bitwise and-op
    unconditionally into AX from the off_reg, then move the pointer from
    the src to dst and finally use AX as the source for the original
    pointer arithmetic operation such that the inversion yields a correct
    result. The single non-AX mov in between is possible given constant
    blinding is retaining it as it's not an immediate based operation.

    igb: Enable RSS for Intel I211 Ethernet Controller
    
    commit 6e6026f2dd2005844fb35c3911e8083c09952c6c upstream.
    
    The Intel I211 Ethernet Controller supports 2 Receive Side Scaling (RSS)
    queues. It should not be excluded from having this feature enabled.
    
    Via commit c883de9fd787 ("igb: rename igb define to be more generic")
    E1000_MRQC_ENABLE_RSS_4Q was renamed to E1000_MRQC_ENABLE_RSS_MQ to
    indicate that this is a generic bit flag to enable queues and not
    a flag that is specific to devices that support 4 queues
    
    The bit flag enables 2, 4 or 8 queues appropriately depending on the part.
    
    Tested with a multicore CPU and frames were then distributed as expected.
    
    This issue appears to have been introduced because of confusion caused
    by the prior name.

    netfilter: conntrack: Make global sysctls readonly in non-init netns
    
    commit 2671fa4dc0109d3fb581bc3078fdf17b5d9080f6 upstream.
    
    These sysctls point to global variables:
    - NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX (&nf_conntrack_max)
    - NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX (&nf_ct_expect_max)
    - NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS (&nf_conntrack_htable_size_user)
    
    Because their data pointers are not updated to point to per-netns
    structures, they must be marked read-only in a non-init_net ns.
    Otherwise, changes in any net namespace are reflected in (leaked into)
    all other net namespaces. This problem has existed since the
    introduction of net namespaces.
    
    The current logic marks them read-only only if the net namespace is
    owned by an unprivileged user (other than init_user_ns).
    
    Commit d0febd81ae77 ("netfilter: conntrack: re-visit sysctls in
    unprivileged namespaces") "exposes all sysctls even if the namespace is
    unpriviliged." Since we need to mark them readonly in any case, we can
    forego the unprivileged user check altogether.

    mips: Do not include hi and lo in clobber list for R6
    
    commit 1d7ba0165d8206ac073f7ac3b14fc0836b66eae7 upstream.
    
    From [1]
    "GCC 10 (PR 91233) won't silently allow registers that are not
    architecturally available to be present in the clobber list anymore,
    resulting in build failure for mips*r6 targets in form of:
    ...

      146 |  __asm__ volatile (      \
          |  ^~~~~~~
    
    This is because base R6 ISA doesn't define hi and lo registers w/o DSP
    extension. This patch provides the alternative clobber list for r6 targets
    that won't include those registers."
    
    Since kernel 5.4 and mips support for generic vDSO [2], the kernel fail to
    build for mips r6 cpus with gcc 10 for the same reason as glibc.
