    powernow-k6: reorder frequencies
    
    commit 22c73795b101597051924556dce019385a1e2fa0 upstream.
    
    This patch reorders reported frequencies from the highest to the lowest,
    just like in other frequency drivers.

    powernow-k6: correctly initialize default parameters
    
    commit d82b922a4acc1781d368aceac2f9da43b038cab2 upstream.
    
    The powernow-k6 driver used to read the initial multiplier from the
    powernow register. However, there is a problem with this:
    
    * If there was a frequency transition before, the multiplier read from the
      register corresponds to the current multiplier.
    * If there was no frequency transition since reset, the field in the
      register always reads as zero, regardless of the current multiplier that
      is set using switches on the mainboard and that the CPU is running at.
    
    The zero value corresponds to multiplier 4.5, so as a consequence, the
    powernow-k6 driver always assumes multiplier 4.5.
    
    For example, if we have 550MHz CPU with bus frequency 100MHz and
    multiplier 5.5, the powernow-k6 driver thinks that the multiplier is 4.5
    and bus frequency is 122MHz. The powernow-k6 driver then sets the
    multiplier to 4.5, underclocking the CPU to 450MHz, but reports the
    current frequency as 550MHz.
    
    There is no reliable way how to read the initial multiplier. I modified
    the driver so that it contains a table of known frequencies (based on
    parameters of existing CPUs and some common overclocking schemes) and sets
    the multiplier according to the frequency. If the frequency is unknown
    (because of unusual overclocking or underclocking), the user must supply
    the bus speed and maximum multiplier as module parameters.
    
    This patch should be backported to all stable kernels. If it doesn't
    apply cleanly, change it, or ask me to change it.

    powernow-k6: disable cache when changing frequency
    
    commit e20e1d0ac02308e2211306fc67abcd0b2668fb8b upstream.
    
    I found out that a system with k6-3+ processor is unstable during network
    server load. The system locks up or the network card stops receiving. The
    reason for the instability is the CPU frequency scaling.
    
    During frequency transition the processor is in "EPM Stop Grant" state.
    The documentation says that the processor doesn't respond to inquiry
    requests in this state. Consequently, coherency of processor caches and
    bus master devices is not maintained, causing the system instability.
    
    This patch flushes the cache during frequency transition. It fixes the
    instability.
    
    Other minor changes:
    * u64 invalue changed to unsigned long because the variable is 32-bit
    * move the logic to set the multiplier to a separate function
      powernow_k6_set_cpu_multiplier
    * preserve lower 5 bits of the powernow port instead of 4 (the voltage
      field has 5 bits)
    * mask interrupts when reading the multiplier, so that the port is not
      open during other activity (running other kernel code with the port open
      shouldn't cause any misbehavior, but we should better be safe and keep
      the port closed)
    
    This patch should be backported to all stable kernels. If it doesn't
    apply cleanly, change it, or ask me to change it.

    commit 2e923a0527ac439e135b9961e58d3acd876bba10 upstream.
    
    free_buff_list and rec_buff_list are initialized in the middle of hdpvr_probe(),
    but if something bad happens before that, error handling code calls hdpvr_delete(),
    which contains iteration over the lists (via hdpvr_free_buffers()).
    The patch moves the lists initialization to the beginning and by the way fixes
    goto label in error handling of registering videodev.

    media: dmxdev: remove dvb_ringbuffer_flush() on writer side
    
    commit 414abbd2cd4c2618895f02ed3a76ec6647281436 upstream.
    
    In dvb_ringbuffer lock-less synchronizationof reader and writer threads is done
    with separateread and write pointers. Sincedvb_ringbuffer_flush() modifies the
    read pointer, this function must not be called from the writer thread.
    This patch removes the dvb_ringbuffer_flush() calls in the dmxdev ringbuffer
    write functions, this fixes Oopses "Unable to handle kernel paging request"
    I could observe for the call chaindvb_demux_read ->dvb_dmxdev_buffer_read ->
    dvb_ringbuffer_read_user -> __copy_to_user (the reader side of the ringbuffer).
    The flush calls at the write side are not necessary anyway since ringbuffer_flush
    is also called in dvb_dmxdev_buffer_read() when an error condition is set in the
    ringbuffer.
    This patch should also be applied to stable kernels.

    media: omap_vout: find_vma() needs ->mmap_sem held
    
    commit 55ee64b30a38d688232e5eb2860467dddc493573 upstream.
    
    Walking rbtree while it's modified is a Bad Idea(tm); besides,
    the result of find_vma() can be freed just as it's getting returned
    to caller.  Fortunately, it's easy to fix - just take ->mmap_sem a bit
    earlier (and don't bother with find_vma() at all if virtp >= PAGE_OFFSET -
    in that case we don't even look at its result).
    
    While we are at it, what prevents VIDIOC_PREPARE_BUF calling
    v4l_prepare_buf() -> (e.g) vb2_ioctl_prepare_buf() -> vb2_prepare_buf() ->
    __buf_prepare() -> __qbuf_userptr() -> vb2_vmalloc_get_userptr() -> find_vma(),
    AFAICS without having taken ->mmap_sem anywhere in process?  The code flow
    is bloody convoluted and depends on a bunch of things done by initialization,
    so I certainly might've missed something...

    commit 317efce991620adc589b3005b9baed433dcb2a56 upstream.
    
    When subdev registration fails the subdev v4l2_dev field is left to a
    non-NULL value. Later calls to v4l2_device_unregister_subdev() will
    consider the subdev as registered and will module_put() the subdev
    module without any matching module_get().

    v4l2_device_register_subdev() when the function fails.

    sb_edac: Avoid overflow errors at memory size calculation
    
    commit deb09ddaff1435f72dd598d38f9b58354c68a5ec upstream.
    
    Sandy bridge EDAC is calculating the memory size with overflow.
    Basically, the size field and the integer calculation is using 32 bits.
    More bits are needed, when the DIMM memories have high density.
    
    The net result is that memories are improperly reported there, when
    high-density DIMMs are used:
    
    EDAC DEBUG: in drivers/edac/sb_edac.c, line at 591: mc#0: channel 0, dimm 0, -16384 Mb (-4194304 pages) bank: 8, rank: 2, row: 0x10000, col: 0x800
    EDAC DEBUG: in drivers/edac/sb_edac.c, line at 591: mc#0: channel 1, dimm 0, -16384 Mb (-4194304 pages) bank: 8, rank: 2, row: 0x10000, col: 0x800
    
    As the number of pages value is handled at the EDAC core as unsigned
    ints, the driver shows the 16 GB memories at sysfs interface as 16760832
    MB! The fix is simple: calculate the number of pages as unsigned 64-bits
    integer.
    
    After the patch, the memory size (16 GB) is properly detected:
    
    EDAC DEBUG: in drivers/edac/sb_edac.c, line at 592: mc#0: channel 0, dimm 0, 16384 Mb (4194304 pages) bank: 8, rank: 2, row: 0x10000, col: 0x800

    omapfb does not currently set pseudo palette correctly for color depths
    above 16bpp, making red text invisible, command like
      echo -e '\e[0;31mRED' > /dev/tty1
    will display nothing on framebuffer console in 24bpp mode.
    This is because temporary variable is declared incorrectly, fix it.

    tg3: Wait for boot code to finish after power on
    
    commit df465abfe06f7dc4f33f4a96d17f096e9e8ac917 upstream.
    
    Some systems that don't need wake-on-lan may choose to power down the
    chip on system standby. Upon resume, the power on causes the boot code
    to startup and initialize the hardware. On one new platform, this is
    causing the device to go into a bad state due to a race between the
    driver and boot code, once every several hundred resumes. The same race
    exists on open since we come up from a power on.
    
    This patch adds a wait for boot code signature at the beginning of
    tg3_init_hw() which is common to both cases. If there has not been a
    power-off or the boot code has already completed, the signature will be
    present and poll_fw() returns immediately. Also return immediately if
    the device does not have firmware.

    After Power-on-reset, the 5719's TX DMA length registers may contain
    uninitialized values and cause TX DMA to stall.  Check for invalid

    hwmon: (applesmc) Always read until end of data
    
    commit 25f2bd7f5add608c1d1405938f39c96927b275ca upstream.
    
    The crash reported and investigated in commit 5f4513 turned out to be
    caused by a change to the read interface on newer (2012) SMCs.
    
    Tests by Chris show that simply reading the data valid line is enough
    for the problem to go away. Additional tests show that the newer SMCs
    no longer wait for the number of requested bytes, but start sending
    data right away.  Apparently the number of bytes to read is no longer
    specified as before, but instead found out by reading until end of
    data. Failure to read until end of data confuses the state machine,
    which eventually causes the crash.
    
    As a remedy, assuming bit0 is the read valid line, make sure there is
    nothing more to read before leaving the read function.
    
    Tested to resolve the original problem, and runtested on MBA3,1,
    MBP4,1, MBP8,2, MBP10,1, MBP10,2. The patch seems to have no effect on
    machines before 2012.

    ALSA: hda - hdmi: Fallback to ALSA allocation when selecting CA
    
    commit 18e391862cceaf43ddb8eb5cca05e1a83abdebaa upstream.
    
    hdmi_channel_allocation() tries to find a HDMI channel allocation that
    matches the number channels in the playback stream and contains only
    speakers that the HDMI sink has reported as available via EDID. If no
    such allocation is found, 0 (stereo audio) is used.
    
    Using CA 0 causes the audio causes the sink to discard everything except
    the first two channels (front left and front right).
    
    However, the sink may be capable of receiving more channels than it has
    speakers (and then perform downmix or discard the extra channels), in
    which case it is preferable to use a CA that contains extra channels
    than to use CA 0 which discards all the non-stereo channels.
    
    Additionally, it seems that HBR (HD) passthrough output does not work on
    Intel HDMI codecs when CA is set to 0 (possibly the codec zeroes
    channels not present in CA). This happens with all receivers that report
    a 5.1 speaker mask since a HBR stream is carried on 8 channels to the
    codec.
    
    Add a fallback in the CA selection so that the CA channel count at least
    matches the stream channel count, even if the stream contains channels
    not present in the sink speaker descriptor.
    
    Thanks to GrimGriefer at OpenELEC forums for discovering that changing
    the sink speaker mask allowed HBR output.

    commit 61ac51301e6c6d4ed977d7674ce2b8e713619a9b upstream.
    
    UAC2_EXTENSION_UNIT_V2 differs from UAC1_EXTENSION_UNIT, but can be handled in
    the same way when parsing the unit. Otherwise parse_audio_unit() fails when it
    sees an extension unit on a UAC2 device.
    
    UAC2_EXTENSION_UNIT_V2 is outside the range allocated by UAC1.

    ALSA: usb-audio: skip UAC2 EFFECT_UNIT
    
    commit 5dae5fd24071319bb67d3375217d5b0b6d16cb0b upstream.
    
    Current code mishandles the case where the device is a UAC2
    and the bDescriptorSubtype is a UAC2 Effect Unit (0x07).
    It tries to parse it as a Processing Unit (which is similar to two
    other UAC1 units with overlapping subtypes), but since the structure
    is different (See: 4.7.2.10, 4.7.2.11 in UAC2 standard), the parsing
    is done incorrectly and prevents the device from initializing.
    For now, just ignore the unit.

    xhci: Limit the spurious wakeup fix only to HP machines
    
    commit 6962d914f317b119e0db7189199b21ec77a4b3e0 upstream.
    
    We've got regression reports that my previous fix for spurious wakeups
    after S5 on HP Haswell machines leads to the automatic reboot at
    shutdown on some machines.  It turned out that the fix for one side
    triggers another BIOS bug in other side.  So, it's exclusive.
    
    Since the original S5 wakeups have been confirmed only on HP machines,
    it'd be safer to apply it only to limited machines.  As a wild guess,
    limiting to machines with HP PCI SSID should suffice.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.12, that
    contain the commit 638298dc66ea36623dbc2757a24fc2c4ab41b016 "xhci: Fix
    spurious wakeups after S5 on Haswell".

    xhci: Fix spurious wakeups after S5 on Haswell
    
    commit 638298dc66ea36623dbc2757a24fc2c4ab41b016 upstream.
    
    Haswell LynxPoint and LynxPoint-LP with the recent Intel BIOS show
    mysterious wakeups after shutdown occasionally.  After discussing with
    BIOS engineers, they explained that the new BIOS expects that the
    wakeup sources are cleared and set to D3 for all wakeup devices when
    the system is going to sleep or power off, but the current xhci driver
    doesn't do this properly (partly intentionally).
    
    This patch introduces a new quirk, XHCI_SPURIOUS_WAKEUP, for
    fixing the spurious wakeups at S5 by calling xhci_reset() in the xhci
    shutdown ops as done in xhci_stop(), and setting the device to PCI D3
    at shutdown and remove ops.
    
    The PCI D3 call is based on the initial fix patch by Oliver Neukum.
    
    [Note: Sarah changed the quirk name from XHCI_HSW_SPURIOUS_WAKEUP to
    XHCI_SPURIOUS_WAKEUP, since none of the other quirks have system names
    in them.  Sarah also fixed a collision with a quirk submitted around the
    same time, by changing the xhci->quirks bit from 17 to 18.]
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that
    contain the commit 1c12443ab8eba71a658fae4572147e56d1f84f66 "xhci: Add

    usb: hub: Clear Port Reset Change during init/resume
    
    commit e92aee330837e4911553761490a8fb843f2053a6 upstream.
    
    This patch adds the Port Reset Change flag to the set of bits that are
    preemptively cleared on init/resume of a hub. In theory this bit should
    never be set unexpectedly... in practice it can still happen if BIOS,
    SMM or ACPI code plays around with USB devices without cleaning up
    correctly. This is especially dangerous for XHCI root hubs, which don't
    generate any more Port Status Change Events until all change bits are
    cleared, so this is a good precaution to have (similar to how it's
    already done for the Warm Port Reset Change flag).

    xhci: Don't enable/disable RWE on bus suspend/resume.
    
    commit f217c980ca980e3a645b7485ea5eae9a747f4945 upstream.
    
    The RWE bit of the USB 2.0 PORTPMSC register is supposed to enable
    remote wakeup for devices in the lower power link state L1.  It has
    nothing to do with the device suspend remote wakeup from L2.  The RWE
    bit is designed to be set once (when USB 2.0 LPM is enabled for the
    port) and cleared only when USB 2.0 LPM is disabled for the port.
    
    The xHCI bus suspend method was setting the RWE bit erroneously, and the
    bus resume method was clearing it.  The xHCI 1.0 specification with
    errata up to Aug 12, 2012 says in section 4.23.5.1.1.1 "Hardware
    Controlled LPM":
    
    "While Hardware USB2 LPM is enabled, software shall not modify the
    HIRDBESL or RWE fields of the USB2 PORTPMSC register..."
    
    If we have previously enabled USB 2.0 LPM for a device, that means when
    the USB 2.0 bus is resumed, we violate the xHCI specification by
    clearing RWE.  It also means that after a bus resume, the host would
    think remote wakeup is disabled from L1 for ports with USB 2.0 Link PM
    enabled, which is not what we want.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that
    contain the commit 65580b4321eb36f16ae8b5987bfa1bb948fc5112 "xHCI: set
    USB2 hardware LPM".  That was the first kernel that supported USB 2.0
    Link PM.

    USB: ftdi_sio: fixed handling of unsupported CSIZE setting
    
    commit 8704211f65a2106ba01b6ac9727cdaf9ca11594c upstream.
    
    FTDI UARTs support only 7 or 8 data bits. Until now the ftdi_sio driver would
    only report this limitation for CS6 to dmesg and fail to reflect this fact to
    tcgetattr.
    
    This patch reverts the unsupported CSIZE setting and reports the fact with less
    severance to dmesg for both CS5 and CS6.
    
    To test the patch it's sufficient to call
    
        stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 cs5
    
    which will succeed without the patch and report an error with the patch
    applied.
    
    As an additional fix this patch ensures that the control request will always
    include a data bit size.

    usb: Disable USB 2.0 Link PM before device reset.
    
    commit dcc01c0864823f91c3bf3ffca6613e2351702b87 upstream.
    
    Before the USB core resets a device, we need to disable the L1 timeout
    for the roothub, if USB 2.0 Link PM is enabled.  Otherwise the port may
    transition into L1 in between descriptor fetches, before we know if the
    USB device descriptors changed.  LPM will be re-enabled after the
    full device descriptors are fetched, and we can confirm the device still
    supports USB 2.0 LPM after the reset.
    
    We don't need to wait for the USB device to exit L1 before resetting the
    device, since the xHCI roothub port diagrams show a transition to the
    Reset state from any of the Ux states (see Figure 34 in the 2012-08-14
    xHCI specification update).
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, that contain
    the commit 65580b4321eb36f16ae8b5987bfa1bb948fc5112 "xHCI: set USB2
    hardware LPM".  That was the first commit to enable USB 2.0

    USB: fix PM config symbol in uhci-hcd, ehci-hcd, and xhci-hcd
    
    commit f875fdbf344b9fde207f66b392c40845dd7e5aa6 upstream.
    
    Since uhci-hcd, ehci-hcd, and xhci-hcd support runtime PM, the .pm
    field in their pci_driver structures should be protected by CONFIG_PM
    rather than CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.  The corresponding change has already
    been made for ohci-hcd.
    
    Without this change, controllers won't do runtime suspend if system
    suspend or hibernation isn't enabled.

    USB: fix build error when CONFIG_PM_SLEEP isn't enabled
    
    commit 9d8924297cd9c256c23c02abae40202563452453 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a build error that occurs when CONFIG_PM is enabled
    and CONFIG_PM_SLEEP isn't:
    
    >> drivers/usb/host/ohci-pci.c:294:10: error: 'usb_hcd_pci_pm_ops' undeclared here (not in a function)
          .pm = &usb_hcd_pci_pm_ops
    
    Since the usb_hcd_pci_pm_ops structure is defined and used when
    CONFIG_PM is enabled, its declaration should not be protected by
    CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.

    USB: ftdi_sio: fix use-after-free in TIOCMIWAIT
    
    commit 71ccb9b01981fabae27d3c98260ea4613207618e upstream.
    
    Use the port wait queue and make sure to check the serial disconnected
    flag before accessing private port data after waking up.
    
    This is is needed as the private port data (including the wait queue
    itself) can be gone when waking up after a disconnect.
    
    When switching to tty ports, some lifetime assumptions were changed.
    Specifically, close can now be called before the final tty reference is
    dropped as part of hangup at device disconnect. Even with the ftdi
    private-data refcounting this means that the port private data can be
    freed while a process is sleeping on modem-status changes and thus
    cannot be relied on to detect disconnects when woken up.

    commit e5b33dc9d16053c2ae4c2c669cf008829530364b upstream.
    
    Add modem-status-change wait queue to struct usb_serial_port that
    subdrivers can use to implement TIOCMIWAIT.
    
    Currently subdrivers use a private wait queue which may have been
    released when waking up after device disconnected.
    
    Note that we're adding a new wait queue rather than reusing the tty-port
    one as we do not want to get woken up at hangup (yet).

    commit 6169b673618bf0b2518ce413b54925782a603f06 upstream.
    
    We've seen the broken HDMI *video* output on some machines with GM965,
    and the debugging session pointed that the culprit is the disabled
    audio output pins.  Toggling these pins dynamically on demand caused
    flickering of HDMI TV.
    
    This patch changes the behavior to keep the pin ON constantly.

    commit 9ddf1aeb2134e72275c97a2c6ff2e3eb04f2f27a upstream.
    
    For non-snoop mode, we fiddle with the page attributes of CORB/RIRB
    and the position buffer, but also the ring buffers.  The problem is
    that the current code blindly assumes that the buffer is contiguous.
    However, the ring buffers may be SG-buffers, thus a wrong vmapped
    address is passed there, leading to Oops.
    
    This patch fixes the handling for SG-buffers.

    ALSA: usb: Add quirk for 192KHz recording on E-Mu devices
    
    commit 1539d4f82ad534431cc67935e8e442ccf107d17d upstream.
    
    When recording at 176.2KHz or 192Khz, the device adds a 32-bit length
    header to the capture packets, which obviously needs to be ignored for
    recording to work properly.
    
    Userspace expected:  L0 L1 L2 R0 R1 R2
    ...but actually got: R2 L0 L1 L2 R0 R1
    
    Also, the last byte of the length header being interpreted as L0 of
    the first sample caused spikes every 0.5ms, resulting in a loud 16KHz
    tone (about the highest 'B' on a piano) being present throughout
    captures.
    
    Tested at all sample rates on an E-Mu 0404USB, and tested for
    regressions on a generic USB headset.

    USB: EHCI: bugfix: urb->hcpriv should not be NULL
    
    commit 2656a9abcf1ec8dd5fee6a75d6997a0f2fa0094e upstream.
    
    This patch (as1632b) fixes a bug in ehci-hcd.  The USB core uses
    urb->hcpriv to determine whether or not an URB is active; host
    controller drivers are supposed to set this pointer to a non-NULL
    value when an URB is queued.  However ehci-hcd sets it to NULL for
    isochronous URBs, which defeats the check in usbcore.
    
    In itself this isn't a big deal.  But people have recently found that
    certain sequences of actions will cause the snd-usb-audio driver to
    reuse URBs without waiting for them to complete.  In the absence of
    proper checking by usbcore, the URBs get added to their endpoint list
    twice.  This leads to list corruption and a system freeze.
    
    The patch makes ehci-hcd assign a meaningful value to urb->hcpriv for
    isochronous URBs.  Improving robustness always helps.

    commit 838f427955dcfd16858b0108ce29029da0d56a4e upstream.
    
    The ath9k commit 2ef167557c0a26c88162ecffb017bfcc51eb7b29
    (ath9k: fix signal strength reporting issues) fixed an issue where the
    reported per-frame signal strength reported to mac80211 was being
    overwritten with an internal average. The same issue is also present
    in ath9k_htc.
    In addition to preventing the driver from overwriting the value, this
    commit also ensures that the internal average (which is used for ANI)
    only tracks beacons of the AP that we're connected to.

    ath9k: fill channel mode in caldata
    
    commit 77d848372875d2e4cbdbf07030f0e08cab5e7f4d upstream.
    
    It is useful to have channel mode in caldata to find out
    whether operaing channel is in HT40/20 when we are currently
    on offchannel. It will be used by BTCOEX to enable/disable
    concurrent tx mechanism later.

    ath9k: Fix noisefloor calibration
    
    commit 696df78509d1f81b651dd98ecdc1aecab616db6b upstream.
    
    The commits,
    
    "ath9k: Fix regression in channelwidth switch at the same channel"
    "ath9k: Fix invalid noisefloor reading due to channel update"
    
    attempted to fix noisefloor calibration when a channel switch
    happens due to HT20/HT40 bandwidth change. This is causing invalid
    readings resulting in messages like:
    
    "ath: phy16: NF[0] (-45) > MAX (-95), correcting to MAX".
    
    This results in an incorrect noise being used initially for reporting
    the signal level of received packets, until NF calibration is done
    and the history buffer is updated via the ANI timer, which happens
    much later.
    
    When a bandwidth change happens, it is appropriate to reset
    the internal history data for the channel. Do this correctly in the
    reset() routine by checking the "chanmode" variable.

    ARM: 7791/1: a.out: remove partial a.out support
    
    commit acfdd4b1f7590d02e9bae3b73bdbbc4a31b05d38 upstream.
    
    a.out support on ARM requires that argc, argv and envp are passed in
    r0-r2 respectively, which requires hacking load_aout_binary to
    prevent argc being clobbered by the return code. Whilst mainline kernels
    do set the registers up in start_thread, the aout loader has never
    carried the hack in mainline.
    
    Initialising the registers in this way actually goes against the libc
    expectations for ELF binaries, where argc, argv and envp are passed on
    the stack, with r0 being used to hold a pointer to an exit function for
    cleaning up after the dynamic linker if required. If the pointer is
    NULL, then it is ignored. When execing an ELF binary, Linux currently
    zeroes r0, then sets it to argc and then finally clobbers it with the
    return value of the execve syscall, so we actually end up with:
    
            r0 = 0
            stack[0] = argc
            r1 = stack[1] = argv
            r2 = stack[2] = envp
    
    libc treats r1 and r2 as undefined. The clobbering of r0 by sys_execve
    works for user-spawned threads, but when executing an ELF binary from a
    kernel thread (via call_usermodehelper), the execve is performed on the
    ret_from_fork path, which restores r0 from the saved pt_regs, resulting
    in argc being presented to the C library. This has horrible consequences
    when the application exits, since we have an exit function registered
    using argc, resulting in a jump to hyperspace.
    
    This patch solves the problem by removing the partial a.out support from
    arch/arm/ altogether.

    ARM: 7628/1: head.S: map one extra section for the ATAG/DTB area
    
    commit 6f16f4998f98e42e3f2dedf663cfb691ff0324af upstream.
    
    We currently use a temporary 1MB section aligned to a 1MB boundary for
    mapping the provided device tree until the final page table is created.
    However, if the device tree happens to cross that 1MB boundary, the end
    of it remains unmapped and the kernel crashes when it attempts to access
    it.  Given no restriction on the location of that DTB, it could end up
    with only a few bytes mapped at the end of a section.
    
    Solve this issue by mapping two consecutive sections.

    ARM: pxa: prevent PXA270 occasional reboot freezes

    Erratum 71 of PXA270M Processor Family Specification Update

    8us insead of 10ms in EMTS.
    
    If SDRAM is not reset, it causes memory bus congestion and
    the device hangs. We put SDRAM in selfresh mode before watchdog
    reset, removing potential freezes.
    
    Without this patch PXA270-based ICP DAS LP-8x4x hangs after up to 40
    reboots. With this patch it has successfully rebooted 500 times.

    ARM: 7743/1: compressed/head.S: work around new binutils warning
    
    commit da94a829305f1c217cfdf6771cb1faca0917e3b9 upstream.
    
    In August 2012, Matthew Gretton-Dann checked a change into binutils
    labelled "Error on obsolete & warn on deprecated registers", apparently as
    part of ARMv8 support. Apparently, this was supposed to emit the message
    "Warning: This coprocessor register access is deprecated in ARMv8" when
    using certain mcr/mrc instructions and building for ARMv8. Unfortunately,
    the message that is actually emitted appears to be '(null)', which is
    less helpful in comparison.
    
    Even more unfortunately, this is biting us on every single kernel
    build with a new gas, because arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S and some
    other files in that directory are built with -march=all since kernel
    commit 80cec14a8 "[ARM] Add -march=all to assembly file build in
    arch/arm/boot/compressed" back in v2.6.28.
    
    This patch reverts Russell's nice solution and instead marks the head.S
    file to be built for armv7-a, which fortunately lets us build all
    instructions in that file without warnings even on the broken binutils.
    
    Without this patch, building anything results in:
    
    arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S: Assembler messages:

    When a device is unplugged, wait for all processes that
    have opened the device to close before deallocating the device.
    
    This commit was solving kernel crash because of the corruption in
    rb tree of vmalloc. The rootcause was the device data pointer was
    geting excessed after the memory associated with hidraw was freed.
    
    The commit 4fe9f8e203f was buggy as it was also freeing the hidraw
    first and then calling delete operation on the list associated with
    that hidraw leading to slab corruption.

    HID: clean up quirk for Sony RF receivers
    
    commit 99d249021abd4341771523ed8dd7946276103432 upstream.
    
    Document what the fix-up is does and make it more robust by ensuring
    that it is only applied to the USB interface that corresponds to the
    mouse (sony_report_fixup() is called once per interface during probing).

    HID: add support for Sony RF receiver with USB product id 0x0374
    
    commit a464918419f94a0043d2f549d6defb4c3f69f68a upstream.
    
    Some Vaio desktop computers, among them the VGC-LN51JGB multimedia PC, have
    a RF receiver, multi-interface USB device 054c:0374, that is used to connect
    a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse.
    
    The keyboard works flawlessly, but the mouse (VGP-WMS3 in my case) does not
    seem to be generating any pointer events. The problem is that the mouse pointer
    is wrongly declared as a constant non-data variable in the report descriptor
    (see lsusb and usbhid-dump output below), with the consequence that it is
    ignored by the HID code.
    
    Add this device to the have-special-driver list and fix up the report
    descriptor in the Sony-specific driver which happens to already have a fixup
    for a similar firmware bug.

    - check for error code of cdev_add()
    - use unregister_chrdev_region() instead of unregister_chrdev()
      if class_create() failed

    selinux: correctly label /proc inodes in use before the policy is loaded
    
    commit f64410ec665479d7b4b77b7519e814253ed0f686 upstream.
    
    This patch is based on an earlier patch by Eric Paris, he describes
    the problem below:
    
      "If an inode is accessed before policy load it will get placed on a
       list of inodes to be initialized after policy load.  After policy
       load we call inode_doinit() which calls inode_doinit_with_dentry()
       on all inodes accessed before policy load.  In the case of inodes
       in procfs that means we'll end up at the bottom where it does:
    
         /* Default to the fs superblock SID. */
         isec->sid = sbsec->sid;
    
         if ((sbsec->flags & SE_SBPROC) && !S_ISLNK(inode->i_mode)) {
                 if (opt_dentry) {
                         isec->sclass = inode_mode_to_security_class(...)
                         rc = selinux_proc_get_sid(opt_dentry,
                                                   isec->sclass,
                                                   &sid);
                         if (rc)
                                 goto out_unlock;
                         isec->sid = sid;
                 }
         }
    
       Since opt_dentry is null, we'll never call selinux_proc_get_sid()
       and will leave the inode labeled with the label on the superblock.
       I believe a fix would be to mimic the behavior of xattrs.  Look
       for an alias of the inode.  If it can't be found, just leave the
       inode uninitialized (and pick it up later) if it can be found, we
       should be able to call selinux_proc_get_sid() ..."
    
    On a system exhibiting this problem, you will notice a lot of files in
    /proc with the generic "proc_t" type (at least the ones that were
    accessed early in the boot), for example:
    
       # ls -Z /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax | awk '{ print $4 " " $5 }'
       system_u:object_r:proc_t:s0 /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
    
    However, with this patch in place we see the expected result:
    
       # ls -Z /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax | awk '{ print $4 " " $5 }'
       system_u:object_r:sysctl_kernel_t:s0 /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

    pps: Fix a use-after free bug when unregistering a source.
    
    commit d953e0e837e65ecc1ddaa4f9560f7925878a0de6 upstream.
    
    Remove the cdev from the system (with cdev_del) *before* deallocating it
    (in pps_device_destruct, called via kobject_put from device_destroy).
    
    Also prevent deallocating a device with open file handles.
    
    A better long-term fix is probably to remove the cdev from the pps_device
    entirely, and instead have all devices reference one global cdev.  Then
    the deallocation ordering becomes simpler.
    
    But that's more complex and invasive change, so we leave that
    for later.

    commit 03a7ffe4e542310838bac70ef85acc17536b6d7c upstream.
    
    Now that N_TTY uses tty->disc_data for its private data,
    'subclass' ldiscs cannot use ->disc_data for their own private data.
    (This is a regression is v3.8-rc1)
    
    Use pps_lookup_dev to associate the tty with the pps source instead.
    
    This fixes a crashing regression in 3.8-rc1.

    pps: Add pps_lookup_dev() function
    
    commit 513b032c98b4b9414aa4e9b4a315cb1bf0380101 upstream.
    
    The PPS serial line discipline wants to attach a PPS device to a tty
    without changing the tty code to add a struct pps_device * pointer.
    
    Since the number of PPS devices in a typical system is generally very low
    (n=1 is by far the most common), it's practical to search the entire list
    of allocated pps devices.  (We capture the timestamp before the lookup,
    so the timing isn't affected.)
    
    It is a bit ugly that this function, which is part of the in-kernel
    PPS API, has to be in pps.c as opposed to kapi,c, but that's not
    something that affects users.

    ipc, msg: fix message length check for negative values
    
    commit 4e9b45a19241354daec281d7a785739829b52359 upstream.
    
    On 64 bit systems the test for negative message sizes is bogus as the
    size, which may be positive when evaluated as a long, will get truncated
    to an int when passed to load_msg().  So a long might very well contain a
    positive value but when truncated to an int it would become negative.
    
    That in combination with a small negative value of msg_ctlmax (which will
    be promoted to an unsigned type for the comparison against msgsz, making
    it a big positive value and therefore make it pass the check) will lead to
    two problems: 1/ The kmalloc() call in alloc_msg() will allocate a too
    small buffer as the addition of alen is effectively a subtraction.  2/ The
    copy_from_user() call in load_msg() will first overflow the buffer with
    userland data and then, when the userland access generates an access
    violation, the fixup handler copy_user_handle_tail() will try to fill the
    remainder with zeros -- roughly 4GB.  That almost instantly results in a
    system crash or reset.
    
      ,-[ Reproducer (needs to be run as root) ]--
      | #include <sys/stat.h>
      | #include <sys/msg.h>
      | #include <unistd.h>
      | #include <fcntl.h>
      |
      | int main(void) {
      |     long msg = 1;
      |     int fd;
      |
      |     fd = open("/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax", O_WRONLY);
      |     write(fd, "-1", 2);
      |     close(fd);
      |
      |     msgsnd(0, &msg, 0xfffffff0, IPC_NOWAIT);
      |
      |     return 0;
      | }
      '---
    
    Fix the issue by preventing msgsz from getting truncated by consistently
    using size_t for the message length.  This way the size checks in
    do_msgsnd() could still be passed with a negative value for msg_ctlmax but
    we would fail on the buffer allocation in that case and error out.
    
    Also change the type of m_ts from int to size_t to avoid similar nastiness
    in other code paths -- it is used in similar constructs, i.e.  signed vs.
    unsigned checks.  It should never become negative under normal
    circumstances, though.
    
    Setting msg_ctlmax to a negative value is an odd configuration and should
    be prevented.  As that might break existing userland, it will be handled
    in a separate commit so it could easily be reverted and reworked without
    reintroducing the above described bug.
    
    Hardening mechanisms for user copy operations would have catched that bug
    early -- e.g.  checking slab object sizes on user copy operations as the
    usercopy feature of the PaX patch does.  Or, for that matter, detect the
    long vs.  int sign change due to truncation, as the size overflow plugin
    of the very same patch does.

    compiler-gcc.h: Add gcc-recommended GCC_VERSION macro
    
    commit 3f3f8d2f48acfd8ed3b8e6b7377935da57b27b16 upstream.
    
    Throughout compiler*.h, many version checks are made.  These can be
    simplified by using the macro that gcc's documentation recommends.
    However, my primary reason for adding this is that I need bug-check
    macros that are enabled at certain gcc versions and it's cleaner to use
    this macro than the tradition method:
    
      #if __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ => 2)
    
    If you add patch level, it gets this ugly:
    
      #if __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && (__GNUC_MINOR__ > 2 || \
          __GNUC_MINOR__ == 2 __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ >= 1))
    
    As opposed to:
    
      #if GCC_VERSION >= 40201
    
    While having separate headers for gcc 3 & 4 eliminates some of this
    verbosity, they can still be cleaned up by this.

    workqueue: cond_resched() after processing each work item
    
    commit b22ce2785d97423846206cceec4efee0c4afd980 upstream.
    
    If !PREEMPT, a kworker running work items back to back can hog CPU.
    This becomes dangerous when a self-requeueing work item which is
    waiting for something to happen races against stop_machine.  Such
    self-requeueing work item would requeue itself indefinitely hogging
    the kworker and CPU it's running on while stop_machine would wait for
    that CPU to enter stop_machine while preventing anything else from
    happening on all other CPUs.  The two would deadlock.
    
    Jamie Liu reports that this deadlock scenario exists around
    scsi_requeue_run_queue() and libata port multiplier support, where one
    port may exclude command processing from other ports.  With the right
    timing, scsi_requeue_run_queue() can end up requeueing itself trying
    to execute an IO which is asked to be retried while another device has
    an exclusive access, which in turn can't make forward progress due to
    stop_machine.
    
    Fix it by invoking cond_resched() after executing each work item.

    idr: fix top layer handling
    
    commit 326cf0f0f308933c10236280a322031f0097205d upstream.
    
    Most functions in idr fail to deal with the high bits when the idr
    tree grows to the maximum height.
    
    * idr_get_empty_slot() stops growing idr tree once the depth reaches
      MAX_IDR_LEVEL - 1, which is one depth shallower than necessary to
      cover the whole range.  The function doesn't even notice that it
      didn't grow the tree enough and ends up allocating the wrong ID
      given sufficiently high @starting_id.
    
      For example, on 64 bit, if the starting id is 0x7fffff01,
      idr_get_empty_slot() will grow the tree 5 layer deep, which only
      covers the 30 bits and then proceed to allocate as if the bit 30
      wasn't specified.  It ends up allocating 0x3fffff01 without the bit
      30 but still returns 0x7fffff01.
    
    * __idr_remove_all() will not remove anything if the tree is fully
      grown.
    
    * idr_find() can't find anything if the tree is fully grown.
    
    * idr_for_each() and idr_get_next() can't iterate anything if the tree
      is fully grown.
    
    Fix it by introducing idr_max() which returns the maximum possible ID
    given the depth of tree and replacing the id limit checks in all
    affected places.
    
    As the idr_layer pointer array pa[] needs to be 1 larger than the
    maximum depth, enlarge pa[] arrays by one.
    
    While this plugs the discovered issues, the whole code base is
    horrible and in desparate need of rewrite.  It's fragile like hell,

    proc: pid/status: show all supplementary groups
    
    commit 8d238027b87e654be552eabdf492042a34c5c300 upstream.
    
    We display a list of supplementary group for each process in
    /proc/<pid>/status.  However, we show only the first 32 groups, not all of
    them.
    
    Although this is rare, but sometimes processes do have more than 32
    supplementary groups, and this kernel limitation breaks user-space apps
    that rely on the group list in /proc/<pid>/status.
    
    Number 32 comes from the internal NGROUPS_SMALL macro which defines the
    length for the internal kernel "small" groups buffer.  There is no
    apparent reason to limit to this value.
    
    This patch removes the 32 groups printing limit.
    
    The Linux kernel limits the amount of supplementary groups by NGROUPS_MAX,
    which is currently set to 65536.  And this is the maximum count of groups
    we may possibly print.
