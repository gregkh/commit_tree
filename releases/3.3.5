    hfsplus: Fix potential buffer overflows
    
    commit 6f24f892871acc47b40dd594c63606a17c714f77 upstream.
    
    Commit ec81aecb2966 ("hfs: fix a potential buffer overflow") fixed a few
    potential buffer overflows in the hfs filesystem.  But as Timo Warns
    pointed out, these changes also need to be made on the hfsplus
    filesystem as well.

    iwlwifi: fix hardware queue programming
    
    commit 5ef4acd58ab2abd0dd0c8e3cacd61a0dc5d73646 upstream.
    
    Newer devices have 20 (5000 series) or 30 (6000 series)
    hardware queues, rather than the 16 that 4965 had. This
    was added to the driver a long time ago, but improperly:
    the queue registers for the higher queues aren't just
    continuations of the registers for the first 16 queues,
    they are in other places. Therefore, the hardware would
    lock up when trying to activate queue 16 or above and
    the device would have to be restarted.
    
    Thanks goes to Emmanuel who identified this and told me
    how the queue programming should be done.
    
    Note that we don't use queues 20 and higher today and
    doing so needs more work than this.

    This should address at least one of the possible reasons of WARNING at

    commit 4c1bcdb5a3354b250b82a67549f57ac27a3bb85f upstream.
    
    This driver currently leaves elp_work behind when stopping, which
    occasionally results in data corruption because work function ends
    up accessing freed memory, typical symptoms of this are various
    worker_thread crashes. Fix it by cancelling elp_work.

    wl1251: fix crash on remove due to premature kfree
    
    commit 328c32f0f85467af5a6c4c3289e168d9ad2555af upstream.
    
    Currently SDIO glue frees it's own structure before calling
    wl1251_free_hw(), which in turn calls ieee80211_unregister_hw().
    The later call may result in a need to communicate with the chip
    to stop it (as it happens now if the interface is still up before
    rmmod), which means calls are made back to the glue, resulting in
    freed memory access.
    
    Fix this by freeing glue data last.

    mac80211: fix AP mode EAP tx for VLAN stations
    
    commit 66f2c99af3d6f2d0aa1120884cf1c60613ef61c0 upstream.
    
    EAP frames for stations in an AP VLAN are sent on the main AP interface
    to avoid race conditions wrt. moving stations.
    For that to work properly, sta_info_get_bss must be used instead of
    sta_info_get when sending EAP packets.
    Previously this was only done for cooked monitor injected packets, so
    this patch adds a check for tx->skb->protocol to the same place.

    ipw2200: Fix race condition in the command completion acknowledge
    
    commit dd447319895d0c0af423e483d9b63f84f3f8869a upstream.
    
    Driver incorrectly validates command completion: instead of waiting
    for a command to be acknowledged it continues execution.  Most of the
    time driver gets acknowledge of the command completion in a tasklet
    before it executes the next one. But sometimes it sends the next
    command before it gets acknowledge for the previous one. In such a
    case one of the following error messages appear in the log:
    
    Failed to send SYSTEM_CONFIG: Already sending a command.
    Failed to send ASSOCIATE: Already sending a command.
    Failed to send TX_POWER: Already sending a command.
    
    After that you need to reload the driver to get it working again.
    
    This bug occurs during roaming (reported by Sam Varshavchik)
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=738508
    and machine booting (reported by Tom Gundersen and Mads Kiilerich)
    https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/28097
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802106
    
    This patch doesn't fix the delay issue during firmware load.
    But at least device now works as usual after boot.

    b43: only reload config after successful initialization
    
    commit dbdedbdf4fbff3d4962a0786f37aa86dfdc48a7e upstream.
    
    Commit 2a19032 (b43: reload phy and bss settings after core restarts)
    introduced an unconditional call to b43_op_config() at the end of
    b43_op_start(). When firmware fails to load this can wedge the system.
    There's no need to reload the configuration after a failed
    initialization anyway, so only make the call if initialization was
    successful.

    libata: skip old error history when counting probe trials

    Commit d902747("[libata] Add ATA transport class") introduced
    ATA_EFLAG_OLD_ER to mark entries in the error ring as cleared.
    
    But ata_count_probe_trials_cb() didn't check this flag and it still
    counts the old error history. So wrong probe trials count is returned
    and it causes problem, for example, SATA link speed is slowed down from
    3.0Gbps to 1.5Gbps.
    
    Fix it by checking ATA_EFLAG_OLD_ER in ata_count_probe_trials_cb().

    md/raid5: Fix a bug about judging if the operation is syncing or replacing
    
    commit c6d2e084c7411f61f2b446d94989e5aaf9879b0f upstream.
    
    When create a raid5 using assume-clean and echo check or repair to
    sync_action.Then component disks did not operated IO but the raid
    check/resync faster than normal.
    Because the judgement in function analyse_stripe():
                    if (do_recovery ||
                        sh->sector >= conf->mddev->recovery_cp)
                            s->syncing = 1;
                    else
                            s->replacing = 1;
    When check or repair,the recovery_cp == MaxSectore,so syncing equal zero
    not one.
    
    This bug was introduced by commit 9a3e1101b827
        md/raid5:  detect and handle replacements during recovery.
    so this patch is suitable for 3.3-stable.

    exit_signal: fix the "parent has changed security domain" logic
    
    commit b6e238dceed36891cc633167afe7151f1f3d83c5 upstream.
    
    exit_notify() changes ->exit_signal if the parent already did exec.
    This doesn't really work, we are not going to send the signal now
    if there is another live thread or the exiting task is traced. The
    parent can exec before the last dies or the tracer detaches.
    
    Move this check into do_notify_parent() which actually sends the
    signal.
    
    The user-visible change is that we do not change ->exit_signal,
    and thus the exiting task is still "clone children" for
    do_wait()->eligible_child(__WCLONE). Hopefully this is fine, the
    current logic is racy anyway.

    exit_signal: simplify the "we have changed execution domain" logic
    
    commit e636825346b36a07ccfc8e30946d52855e21f681 upstream.
    
    exit_notify() checks "tsk->self_exec_id != tsk->parent_exec_id"
    to handle the "we have changed execution domain" case.
    
    We can change do_thread() to always set ->exit_signal = SIGCHLD
    and remove this check to simplify the code.
    
    We could change setup_new_exec() instead, this looks more logical
    because it increments ->self_exec_id. But note that de_thread()
    already resets ->exit_signal if it changes the leader, let's keep
    both changes close to each other.
    
    Note that we change ->exit_signal lockless, this changes the rules.
    Thereafter ->exit_signal is not stable under tasklist but this is
    fine, the only possible change is OLDSIG -> SIGCHLD. This can race
    with eligible_child() but the race is harmless. We can race with
    reparent_leader() which changes our ->exit_signal in parallel, but
    it does the same change to SIGCHLD.
    
    The noticeable user-visible change is that the execing task is not
    "visible" to do_wait()->eligible_child(__WCLONE) right after exec.
    To me this looks more logical, and this is consistent with mt case.

    So instead of playing catch-up up-front, always do a single load-fold
    with whatever state we encounter and only then fold the nohz remainder
    and play catch-up.

    PM / Hibernate: fix the number of pages used for hibernate/thaw buffering
    
    commit f8262d476823a7ea1eb497ff9676d1eab2393c75 upstream.
    
    Hibernation regression fix, since 3.2.
    
    Calculate the number of required free pages based on non-high memory
    pages only, because that is where the buffers will come from.
    
    Commit 081a9d043c983f161b78fdc4671324d1342b86bc introduced a new buffer
    page allocation logic during hibernation, in order to improve the
    performance. The amount of pages allocated was calculated based on total
    amount of pages available, although only non-high memory pages are
    usable for this purpose. This caused hibernation code to attempt to over
    allocate pages on platforms that have high memory, which led to hangs.

    powerpc/85xx: don't call of_platform_bus_probe() twice
    
    commit 8a95bc8dfe06982fc2b8a0a2adda7baa2346a17b upstream.
    
    Commit 46d026ac ("powerpc/85xx: consolidate of_platform_bus_probe calls")
    replaced platform-specific of_device_id tables with a single function
    that probes the most of the busses in 85xx device trees.  If a specific
    platform needed additional busses probed, then it could call
    of_platform_bus_probe() again.  Typically, the additional platform-specific
    busses are children of existing busses that have already been probed.
    of_platform_bus_probe() does not handle those child busses automatically.
    
    Unfortunately, this doesn't actually work.  The second (platform-specific)
    call to of_platform_bus_probe() never finds any of the busses it's asked
    to find.
    
    To remedy this, the platform-specific of_device_id tables are eliminated,
    and their entries are merged into mpc85xx_common_ids[], so that all busses
    are probed at once.

    x86, efi: Add dedicated EFI stub entry point
    
    commit b1994304fc399f5d3a5368c81111d713490c4799 upstream.
    
    The method used to work out whether we were booted by EFI firmware or
    via a boot loader is broken. Because efi_main() is always executed
    when booting from a boot loader we will dereference invalid pointers
    either on the stack (CONFIG_X86_32) or contained in %rdx
    (CONFIG_X86_64) when searching for an EFI System Table signature.
    
    Instead of dereferencing these invalid system table pointers, add a
    new entry point that is only used when booting from EFI firmware, when
    we know the pointer arguments will be valid. With this change legacy
    boot loaders will no longer execute efi_main(), but will instead skip
    EFI stub initialisation completely.

    x86, boot: Correct CFLAGS for hostprogs
    
    commit 446e1c86d51d0823e003a43a2b85c430efce2733 upstream.
    
    This is a partial revert of commit:
        d40f833 "Restrict CFLAGS for hostprogs"
    
    The endian-manipulation macros in tools/include need <linux/types.h>,
    but the hostprogs in arch/x86/boot need several headers from the
    kernel build tree, which means we have to add the kernel headers to
    the include path.  This picks up <linux/types.h> from the kernel tree,
    which gives a warning.
    
    Since this use of <linux/types.h> is intentional, add
    -D__EXPORTED_HEADERS__ to the command line to silence the warning.
    
    A better way to fix this would be to always install the exported
    kernel headers into $(objtree)/usr/include as a standard part of the
    kernel build, but that is a lot more involved.

    x86, efi: Fix endian issues and unaligned accesses
    
    commit 92f42c50f227ad228f815a8f4eec872524dae3a5 upstream.
    
    We may need to convert the endianness of the data we read from/write
    to 'buf', so let's use {get,put}_unaligned_le32() to do that. Failure
    to do so can result in accessing invalid memory, leading to a
    segfault.  Stephen Rothwell noticed this bug while cross-building an
    x86_64 allmodconfig kernel on PowerPC.
    
    We need to read from and write to 'buf' a byte at a time otherwise
    it's possible we'll perform an unaligned access, which can lead to bus
    errors when cross-building an x86 kernel on risc architectures.

    x86, boot: Restrict CFLAGS for hostprogs
    
    commit d40f833630a1299fd377408dc8d8fac370d621b0 upstream.
    
    Currently tools/build has access to all the kernel headers in
    $(srctree). This is unnecessary and could potentially allow
    tools/build to erroneously include kernel headers when it should only
    be including userspace-exported headers.
    
    Unfortunately, mkcpustr still needs access to some of the asm kernel
    headers, so explicitly special case that hostprog.

    efi: Validate UEFI boot variables
    
    commit fec6c20b570bcf541e581fc97f2e0cbdb9725b98 upstream.
    
    A common flaw in UEFI systems is a refusal to POST triggered by a malformed
    boot variable. Once in this state, machines may only be restored by
    reflashing their firmware with an external hardware device. While this is
    obviously a firmware bug, the serious nature of the outcome suggests that
    operating systems should filter their variable writes in order to prevent
    a malicious user from rendering the machine unusable.

    ARM: 7406/1: hotplug: copy the affinity mask when forcefully migrating IRQs
    
    commit 5e7371ded05adfcfcee44a8bc070bfc37979b8f2 upstream.
    
    When a CPU is hotplugged off, we migrate any IRQs currently affine to it
    away and onto another online CPU by calling the irq_set_affinity
    function of the relevant interrupt controller chip. This function
    returns either IRQ_SET_MASK_OK or IRQ_SET_MASK_OK_NOCOPY, to indicate
    whether irq_data.affinity was updated.
    
    If we are forcefully migrating an interrupt (because the affinity mask
    no longer identifies any online CPUs) then we should update the IRQ
    affinity mask to reflect the new CPU set. Failure to do so can
    potentially leave /proc/irq/n/smp_affinity identifying only offline
    CPUs, which may confuse userspace IRQ balancing daemons.
    
    This patch updates migrate_one_irq to copy the affinity mask when
    the interrupt chip returns IRQ_SET_MASK_OK after forcefully changing the
    affinity of an interrupt.

    ARM: 7403/1: tls: remove covert channel via TPIDRURW
    
    commit 6a1c53124aa161eb624ce7b1e40ade728186d34c upstream.
    
    TPIDRURW is a user read/write register forming part of the group of
    thread registers in more recent versions of the ARM architecture (~v6+).
    
    Currently, the kernel does not touch this register, which allows tasks
    to communicate covertly by reading and writing to the register without
    context-switching affecting its contents.
    
    This patch clears TPIDRURW when TPIDRURO is updated via the set_tls
    macro, which is called directly from __switch_to. Since the current
    behaviour makes the register useless to userspace as far as thread
    pointers are concerned, simply clearing the register (rather than saving
    and restoring it) will not cause any problems to userspace.

    ARM: 7396/1: errata: only handle ARM erratum #326103 on affected cores
    
    commit f0c4b8d653f5ee091fb8d4d02ed7eaad397491bb upstream.
    
    Erratum #326103 ("FSR write bit incorrect on a SWP to read-only memory")
    only affects the ARM 1136 core prior to r1p0. The workaround
    disassembles the faulting instruction to determine whether it was a read
    or write access on all v6 cores.
    
    An issue has been reported on the ARM 11MPCore whereby loading the
    faulting instruction may happen in parallel with that page being
    unmapped, resulting in a deadlock due to the lack of TLB broadcasting
    in hardware:
    
    http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2012-March/091561.html
    
    This patch limits the workaround so that it is only used on affected
    cores, which are known to be UP only. Other v6 cores can rely on the
    FSR to indicate the access type correctly.

    autofs: make the autofsv5 packet file descriptor use a packetized pipe
    
    commit 64f371bc3107e69efce563a3d0f0e6880de0d537 upstream.
    
    The autofs packet size has had a very unfortunate size problem on x86:
    because the alignment of 'u64' differs in 32-bit and 64-bit modes, and
    because the packet data was not 8-byte aligned, the size of the autofsv5
    packet structure differed between 32-bit and 64-bit modes despite
    looking otherwise identical (300 vs 304 bytes respectively).
    
    We first fixed that up by making the 64-bit compat mode know about this
    problem in commit a32744d4abae ("autofs: work around unhappy compat
    problem on x86-64"), and that made a 32-bit 'systemd' work happily on a
    64-bit kernel because everything then worked the same way as on a 32-bit
    kernel.
    
    But it turned out that 'automount' had actually known and worked around
    this problem in user space, so fixing the kernel to do the proper 32-bit
    compatibility handling actually *broke* 32-bit automount on a 64-bit
    kernel, because it knew that the packet sizes were wrong and expected
    those incorrect sizes.
    
    As a result, we ended up reverting that compatibility mode fix, and
    thus breaking systemd again, in commit fcbf94b9dedd.
    
    With both automount and systemd doing a single read() system call, and
    verifying that they get *exactly* the size they expect but using
    different sizes, it seemed that fixing one of them inevitably seemed to
    break the other.  At one point, a patch I seriously considered applying
    from Michael Tokarev did a "strcmp()" to see if it was automount that
    was doing the operation.  Ugly, ugly.
    
    However, a prettier solution exists now thanks to the packetized pipe
    mode.  By marking the communication pipe as being packetized (by simply
    setting the O_DIRECT flag), we can always just write the bigger packet
    size, and if user-space does a smaller read, it will just get that
    partial end result and the extra alignment padding will simply be thrown
    away.
    
    This makes both automount and systemd happy, since they now get the size
    they asked for, and the kernel side of autofs simply no longer needs to
    care - it could pad out the packet arbitrarily.
    
    Of course, if there is some *other* user of autofs (please, please,
    please tell me it ain't so - and we haven't heard of any) that tries to
    read the packets with multiple writes, that other user will now be
    broken - the whole point of the packetized mode is that one system call
    gets exactly one packet, and you cannot read a packet in pieces.

    pipes: add a "packetized pipe" mode for writing
    
    commit 9883035ae7edef3ec62ad215611cb8e17d6a1a5d upstream.
    
    The actual internal pipe implementation is already really about
    individual packets (called "pipe buffers"), and this simply exposes that
    as a special packetized mode.
    
    When we are in the packetized mode (marked by O_DIRECT as suggested by
    Alan Cox), a write() on a pipe will not merge the new data with previous
    writes, so each write will get a pipe buffer of its own.  The pipe
    buffer is then marked with the PIPE_BUF_FLAG_PACKET flag, which in turn
    will tell the reader side to break the read at that boundary (and throw
    away any partial packet contents that do not fit in the read buffer).
    
    End result: as long as you do writes less than PIPE_BUF in size (so that
    the pipe doesn't have to split them up), you can now treat the pipe as a
    packet interface, where each read() system call will read one packet at
    a time.  You can just use a sufficiently big read buffer (PIPE_BUF is
    sufficient, since bigger than that doesn't guarantee atomicity anyway),
    and the return value of the read() will naturally give you the size of
    the packet.
    
    NOTE! We do not support zero-sized packets, and zero-sized reads and
    writes to a pipe continue to be no-ops.  Also note that big packets will
    currently be split at write time, but that the size at which that
    happens is not really specified (except that it's bigger than PIPE_BUF).
    Currently that limit is the system page size, but we might want to
    explicitly support bigger packets some day.
    
    The main user for this is going to be the autofs packet interface,
    allowing us to stop having to care so deeply about exact packet sizes
    (which have had bugs with 32/64-bit compatibility modes).  But user
    space can create packetized pipes with "pipe2(fd, O_DIRECT)", which will
    fail with an EINVAL on kernels that do not support this interface.

    USB: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS computers
    
    commit 151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 upstream.
    
    This patch (as1545) fixes a problem affecting several ASUS computers:
    The machine crashes or corrupts memory when going into suspend if the
    ehci-hcd driver is bound to any controllers.  Users have been forced
    to unbind or unload ehci-hcd before putting their systems to sleep.
    
    After extensive testing, it was determined that the machines don't
    like going into suspend when any EHCI controllers are in the PCI D3
    power state.  Presumably this is a firmware bug, but there's nothing
    we can do about it except to avoid putting the controllers in D3
    during system sleep.
    
    The patch adds a new flag to indicate whether the problem is present,
    and avoids changing the controller's power state if the flag is set.
    Runtime suspend is unaffected; this matters only for system suspend.
    However as a side effect, the controller will not respond to remote
    wakeup requests while the system is asleep.  Hence USB wakeup is not
    functional -- but of course, this is already true in the current state
    of affairs.
    
    This fixes Bugzilla #42728.

    nl80211: ensure interface is up in various APIs
    
    commit 2b5f8b0b44e17e625cfba1e7b88db44f4dcc0441 upstream.
    [backported by Ben Greear]
    
    The nl80211 handling code should ensure as much as
    it can that the interface is in a valid state, it
    can certainly ensure the interface is running.
    
    Not doing so can cause calls through mac80211 into
    the driver that result in warnings and unspecified
    behaviour in the driver.

    i387: ptrace breaks the lazy-fpu-restore logic
    
    commit 089f9fba56faf33cc6dd2a6442b7ac92c58b8209 upstream.
    
    Starting from 7e16838d "i387: support lazy restore of FPU state"
    we assume that fpu_owner_task doesn't need restore_fpu_checking()
    on the context switch, its FPU state should match what we already
    have in the FPU on this CPU.
    
    However, debugger can change the tracee's FPU state, in this case
    we should reset fpu.last_cpu to ensure fpu_lazy_restore() can't
    return true.
    
    Change init_fpu() to do this, it is called by user_regset->set()
    methods.

    drm/i915: Set the Stencil Cache eviction policy to non-LRA mode.
    
    commit 3a69ddd6f872180b6f61fda87152b37202118fbc upstream.
    
    Clearing bit 5 of CACHE_MODE_0 is necessary to prevent GPU hangs in
    OpenGL programs such as Google MapsGL, Google Earth, and gzdoom when
    using separate stencil buffers.  Without it, the GPU tries to use the
    LRA eviction policy, which isn't supported.  This was supposed to be off
    by default, but seems to be on for many machines.
    
    This cannot be done in gen6_init_clock_gating with most of the other
    workaround bits; the render ring needs to exist.  Otherwise, the
    register write gets dropped on the floor (one printk will show it
    changed, but a second printk immediately following shows the value
    reverts to the old one).

    drm/i915: handle input/output sdvo timings separately in mode_set
    
    commit 6651819b4b4fc3caa6964c5d825eb4bb996f3905 upstream.
    
    We seem to have a decent confusion between the output timings and the
    input timings of the sdvo encoder. If I understand the code correctly,
    we use the original mode unchanged for the output timings, safe for
    the lvds case. And we should use the adjusted mode for input timings.
    
    Clarify the situation by adding an explicit output_dtd to the sdvo
    mode_set function and streamline the code-flow by moving the input and
    output mode setting in the sdvo encode together.
    
    Furthermore testing showed that the sdvo input timing needs the
    unadjusted dotclock, the sdvo chip will automatically compute the
    required pixel multiplier to get a dotclock above 100 MHz.
    
    Fix this up when converting a drm mode to an sdvo dtd.
    
    This regression was introduced in

    #             * Otherwise, the output timing is equal to the input timing.
    
    Due to questions raised in review, below a more elaborate analysis of
    the bug at hand:
    
    Sdvo seems to have two timings, one is the output timing which will be
    sent over whatever is connected on the other side of the sdvo chip (panel,
    hdmi screen, tv), the other is the input timing which will be generated by
    the gmch pipe. It looks like sdvo is expected to scale between the two.
    
    To make things slightly more complicated, we have a bunch of special
    cases:
    - For lvds panel we always use a fixed output timing, namely
      intel_sdvo->sdvo_lvds_fixed_mode, hence that special case.
    - Sdvo has an interface to generate a preferred input timing for a given
      output timing. This is the confusing thing that I've tried to clear up
      with the follow-on patches.
    - A special requirement is that the input pixel clock needs to be between
      100MHz and 200MHz (likely to keep it within the electromechanical design
      range of PCIe), 270MHz on later gen4+. Lower pixel clocks are
      doubled/quadrupled.
    
    The thing this patch tries to fix is that the pipe needs to be
    explicitly instructed to double/quadruple the pixels and needs the
    correspondingly higher pixel clock, whereas the sdvo adaptor seems to
    do that itself and needs the unadjusted pixel clock. For the sdvo
    encode side we already set the pixel mutliplier with a different
    command (0x21).
    
    This patch tries to fix this mess by:
    - Keeping the output mode timing in the unadjusted plain mode, safe
      for the lvds case.
    - Storing the input timing in the adjusted_mode with the adjusted
      pixel clock. This way we don't need to frob around with the core
      crtc mode set code.
    - Fixing up the pixelclock when constructing the sdvo dtd timing
      struct. This is why the first hunk of the patch is an integral part
      of the series.
    - Dropping the is_tv special case because input_dtd is equivalent to
      adjusted_mode after these changes. Follow-up patches clear this up
      further (by simply ripping out intel_sdvo->input_dtd because it's
      not needed).

    hwmon: fam15h_power: fix bogus values with current BIOSes
    
    commit 00250ec90963b7ef6678438888f3244985ecde14 upstream.
    
    Newer BKDG[1] versions recommend a different initialization value for
    the running average range register in the northbridge. This improves
    the power reading by avoiding counter saturations resulting in bogus
    values for anything below about 80% of TDP power consumption.
    Updated BIOSes will have this new value set up from the beginning,
    but meanwhile we correct this value ourselves.
    This needs to be done on all northbridges, even on those where the
    driver itself does not register at.
    
    This fixes the driver on all current machines to provide proper
    values for idle load.

    tracing: Fix stacktrace of latency tracers (irqsoff and friends)
    
    commit db4c75cbebd7e5910cd3bcb6790272fcc3042857 upstream.
    
    While debugging a latency with someone on IRC (mirage335) on #linux-rt (OFTC),
    we discovered that the stacktrace output of the latency tracers
    (preemptirqsoff) was empty.
    
    This bug was caused by the creation of the dynamic length stack trace
    again (like commit 12b5da3 "tracing: Fix ent_size in trace output" was).
    
    This bug is caused by the latency tracers requiring the next event
    to determine the time between the current event and the next. But by
    grabbing the next event, the iter->ent_size is set to the next event
    instead of the current one. As the stacktrace event is the last event,
    this makes the ent_size zero and causes nothing to be printed for
    the stack trace. The dynamic stacktrace uses the ent_size to determine
    how much of the stack can be printed. The ent_size of zero means
    no stack.
    
    The simple fix is to save the iter->ent_size before finding the next event.
    
    Note, mirage335 asked to remain anonymous from LKML and git, so I will
    not add the Reported-by and Tested-by tags, even though he did report
    the issue and tested the fix.

    dmaengine: at_hdmac: remove clear-on-read in atc_dostart()
    
    commit ed8b0d67f33518a16c6b2450fe5ebebf180c2d04 upstream.
    
    This loop on EBCISR register was designed to clear IRQ sources before enabling
    a DMA channel. This register is clear-on-read so a race condition can appear if
    another channel is already active and has just finished its transfer.
    Removing this read on EBCISR is fixing the issue as there is no case where an IRQ
    could be pending: we already make sure that this register is drained at probe()
    time and during resume.

    are using 'dom0_max_vcpus=X' on the Xen hypervisor line
    to clip the amount of CPUs available to the initial domain,
    we get this:

    With this patch, we cap the amount of vCPUS that the initial domain
    can run, to exactly what dom0_max_vcpus=X has specified.
    
    In the future, if there is a hypercall that will allow a running
    domain to expand past its initial set of vCPUS, this patch should
    be re-evaluated.

    xen: correctly check for pending events when restoring irq flags
    
    commit 7eb7ce4d2e8991aff4ecb71a81949a907ca755ac upstream.
    
    In xen_restore_fl_direct(), xen_force_evtchn_callback() was being
    called even if no events were pending.  This resulted in (depending on
    workload) about a 100 times as many xen_version hypercalls as
    necessary.
    
    Fix this by correcting the sense of the conditional jump.
    
    This seems to give a significant performance benefit for some
    workloads.
    
    There is some subtle tricksy "..since the check here is trying to
    check both pending and masked in a single cmpw, but I think this is
    correct. It will call check_events now only when the combined
    mask+pending word is 0x0001 (aka unmasked, pending)." (Ian)

    Revert "autofs: work around unhappy compat problem on x86-64"
    
    commit fcbf94b9dedd2ce08e798a99aafc94fec8668161 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit a32744d4abae24572eff7269bc17895c41bd0085.
    
    While that commit was technically the right thing to do, and made the
    x86-64 compat mode work identically to native 32-bit mode (and thus
    fixing the problem with a 32-bit systemd install on a 64-bit kernel), it
    turns out that the automount binaries had workarounds for this compat
    problem.
    
    Now, the workarounds are disgusting: doing an "uname()" to find out the
    architecture of the kernel, and then comparing it for the 64-bit cases
    and fixing up the size of the read() in automount for those.  And they
    were confused: it's not actually a generic 64-bit issue at all, it's
    very much tied to just x86-64, which has different alignment for an
    'u64' in 64-bit mode than in 32-bit mode.
    
    But the end result is that fixing the compat layer actually breaks the
    case of a 32-bit automount on a x86-64 kernel.
    
    There are various approaches to fix this (including just doing a
    "strcmp()" on current->comm and comparing it to "automount"), but I
    think that I will do the one that teaches pipes about a special "packet
    mode", which will allow user space to not have to care too deeply about
    the padding at the end of the autofs packet.
    
    That change will make the compat workaround unnecessary, so let's revert
    it first, and get automount working again in compat mode.  The
    packetized pipes will then fix autofs for systemd.

    x86/platform: Remove incorrect error message in x86_default_fixup_cpu_id()
    
    commit 68894632afb2729a1d8785c877840953894c7283 upstream.
    
    It's only called from amd.c:srat_detect_node(). The introduced
    condition for calling the fixup code is true for all AMD
    multi-node processors, e.g. Magny-Cours and Interlagos. There we
    have 2 NUMA nodes on one socket. Thus there are cores having
    different numa-node-id but with equal phys_proc_id.
    
    There is no point to print error messages in such a situation.
    
    The confusing/misleading error message was introduced with
    commit 64be4c1c2428e148de6081af235e2418e6a66dda ("x86: Add
    x86_init platform override to fix up NUMA core numbering").
    
    Remove the default fixup function (especially the error message)
    and replace it by a NULL pointer check, move the
    Numascale-specific condition for calling the fixup into the
    fixup-function itself and slightly adapt the comment.

    x86, apic: APIC code touches invalid MSR on P5 class machines
    
    commit cbf2829b61c136edcba302a5e1b6b40e97d32c00 upstream.
    
    Current APIC code assumes MSR_IA32_APICBASE is present for all systems.
    Pentium Classic P5 and friends didn't have this MSR. MSR_IA32_APICBASE
    was introduced as an architectural MSR by Intel @ P6.
    
    Code paths that can touch this MSR invalidly are when vendor == Intel &&
    cpu-family == 5 and APIC bit is set in CPUID - or when you simply pass
    lapic on the kernel command line, on a P5.
    
    The below patch stops Linux incorrectly interfering with the
    MSR_IA32_APICBASE for P5 class machines. Other code paths exist that
    touch the MSR - however those paths are not currently reachable for a
    conformant P5.

    nfs: Enclose hostname in brackets when needed in nfs_do_root_mount
    
    commit 98a2139f4f4d7b5fcc3a54c7fddbe88612abed20 upstream.
    
    When hostname contains colon (e.g. when it is an IPv6 address) it needs
    to be enclosed in brackets to make parsing of NFS device string possible.
    Fix nfs_do_root_mount() to enclose hostname properly when needed. NFS code
    actually does not need this as it does not parse the string passed by
    nfs_do_root_mount() but the device string is exposed to userspace in
    /proc/mounts.
