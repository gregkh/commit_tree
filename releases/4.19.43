    Documentation: Correct the possible MDS sysfs values
    
    commit ea01668f9f43021b28b3f4d5ffad50106a1e1301 upstream
    
    Adjust the last two rows in the table that display possible values when
    MDS mitigation is enabled. They both were slightly innacurate.
    
    In addition, convert the table of possible values and their descriptions
    to a list-table. The simple table format uses the top border of equals
    signs to determine cell width which resulted in the first column being
    far too wide in comparison to the second column that contained the
    majority of the text.

    x86/mds: Add MDSUM variant to the MDS documentation
    
    commit e672f8bf71c66253197e503f75c771dd28ada4a0 upstream
    
    Updated the documentation for a new CVE-2019-11091 Microarchitectural Data
    Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM) which is a variant of
    Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). MDS is a family of side channel
    attacks on internal buffers in Intel CPUs.
    
    MDSUM is a special case of MSBDS, MFBDS and MLPDS. An uncacheable load from
    memory that takes a fault or assist can leave data in a microarchitectural
    structure that may later be observed using one of the same methods used by
    MSBDS, MFBDS or MLPDS. There are no new code changes expected for MDSUM.
    The existing mitigation for MDS applies to MDSUM as well.

    cpu/speculation: Add 'mitigations=' cmdline option
    
    commit 98af8452945c55652de68536afdde3b520fec429 upstream
    
    Keeping track of the number of mitigations for all the CPU speculation
    bugs has become overwhelming for many users.  It's getting more and more
    complicated to decide which mitigations are needed for a given
    architecture.  Complicating matters is the fact that each arch tends to
    have its own custom way to mitigate the same vulnerability.
    
    Most users fall into a few basic categories:
    
    a) they want all mitigations off;
    
    b) they want all reasonable mitigations on, with SMT enabled even if
       it's vulnerable; or
    
    c) they want all reasonable mitigations on, with SMT disabled if
       vulnerable.
    
    Define a set of curated, arch-independent options, each of which is an
    aggregation of existing options:
    
    - mitigations=off: Disable all mitigations.
    
    - mitigations=auto: [default] Enable all the default mitigations, but
      leave SMT enabled, even if it's vulnerable.
    
    - mitigations=auto,nosmt: Enable all the default mitigations, disabling
      SMT if needed by a mitigation.
    
    Currently, these options are placeholders which don't actually do
    anything.  They will be fleshed out in upcoming patches.

    x86/speculation/mds: Print SMT vulnerable on MSBDS with mitigations off
    
    commit e2c3c94788b08891dcf3dbe608f9880523ecd71b upstream
    
    This code is only for CPUs which are affected by MSBDS, but are *not*
    affected by the other two MDS issues.
    
    For such CPUs, enabling the mds_idle_clear mitigation is enough to
    mitigate SMT.
    
    However if user boots with 'mds=off' and still has SMT enabled, we should
    not report that SMT is mitigated:
    
    $cat /sys//devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds
    Vulnerable; SMT mitigated
    
    But rather:
    Vulnerable; SMT vulnerable

    commit 22dd8365088b6403630b82423cf906491859b65e upstream
    
    In virtualized environments it can happen that the host has the microcode
    update which utilizes the VERW instruction to clear CPU buffers, but the
    hypervisor is not yet updated to expose the X86_FEATURE_MD_CLEAR CPUID bit
    to guests.
    
    Introduce an internal mitigation mode VMWERV which enables the invocation
    of the CPU buffer clearing even if X86_FEATURE_MD_CLEAR is not set. If the
    system has no updated microcode this results in a pointless execution of
    the VERW instruction wasting a few CPU cycles. If the microcode is updated,
    but not exposed to a guest then the CPU buffers will be cleared.
    
    That said: Virtual Machines Will Eventually Receive Vaccine

    x86/speculation/mds: Add mitigation control for MDS
    
    commit bc1241700acd82ec69fde98c5763ce51086269f8 upstream
    
    Now that the mitigations are in place, add a command line parameter to
    control the mitigation, a mitigation selector function and a SMT update
    mechanism.
    
    This is the minimal straight forward initial implementation which just
    provides an always on/off mode. The command line parameter is:
    
      mds=[full|off]
    
    This is consistent with the existing mitigations for other speculative
    hardware vulnerabilities.
    
    The idle invocation is dynamically updated according to the SMT state of
    the system similar to the dynamic update of the STIBP mitigation. The idle
    mitigation is limited to CPUs which are only affected by MSBDS and not any
    other variant, because the other variants cannot be mitigated on SMT
    enabled systems.

    x86/speculation/mds: Conditionally clear CPU buffers on idle entry
    
    commit 07f07f55a29cb705e221eda7894dd67ab81ef343 upstream
    
    Add a static key which controls the invocation of the CPU buffer clear
    mechanism on idle entry. This is independent of other MDS mitigations
    because the idle entry invocation to mitigate the potential leakage due to
    store buffer repartitioning is only necessary on SMT systems.
    
    Add the actual invocations to the different halt/mwait variants which
    covers all usage sites. mwaitx is not patched as it's not available on
    Intel CPUs.
    
    The buffer clear is only invoked before entering the C-State to prevent
    that stale data from the idling CPU is spilled to the Hyper-Thread sibling
    after the Store buffer got repartitioned and all entries are available to
    the non idle sibling.
    
    When coming out of idle the store buffer is partitioned again so each
    sibling has half of it available. Now CPU which returned from idle could be
    speculatively exposed to contents of the sibling, but the buffers are
    flushed either on exit to user space or on VMENTER.
    
    When later on conditional buffer clearing is implemented on top of this,
    then there is no action required either because before returning to user
    space the context switch will set the condition flag which causes a flush
    on the return to user path.
    
    Note, that the buffer clearing on idle is only sensible on CPUs which are
    solely affected by MSBDS and not any other variant of MDS because the other
    MDS variants cannot be mitigated when SMT is enabled, so the buffer
    clearing on idle would be a window dressing exercise.
    
    This intentionally does not handle the case in the acpi/processor_idle
    driver which uses the legacy IO port interface for C-State transitions for
    two reasons:
    
     - The acpi/processor_idle driver was replaced by the intel_idle driver
       almost a decade ago. Anything Nehalem upwards supports it and defaults
       to that new driver.
    
     - The legacy IO port interface is likely to be used on older and therefore
       unaffected CPUs or on systems which do not receive microcode updates
       anymore, so there is no point in adding that.

    x86/speculation/mds: Add mds_clear_cpu_buffers()
    
    commit 6a9e529272517755904b7afa639f6db59ddb793e upstream
    
    The Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) vulernabilities are mitigated by
    clearing the affected CPU buffers. The mechanism for clearing the buffers
    uses the unused and obsolete VERW instruction in combination with a
    microcode update which triggers a CPU buffer clear when VERW is executed.
    
    Provide a inline function with the assembly magic. The argument of the VERW
    instruction must be a memory operand as documented:
    
      "MD_CLEAR enumerates that the memory-operand variant of VERW (for
       example, VERW m16) has been extended to also overwrite buffers affected
       by MDS. This buffer overwriting functionality is not guaranteed for the
       register operand variant of VERW."
    
    Documentation also recommends to use a writable data segment selector:
    
      "The buffer overwriting occurs regardless of the result of the VERW
       permission check, as well as when the selector is null or causes a
       descriptor load segment violation. However, for lowest latency we
       recommend using a selector that indicates a valid writable data
       segment."
    
    Add x86 specific documentation about MDS and the internal workings of the
    mitigation.

    x86/speculation/mds: Add BUG_MSBDS_ONLY
    
    commit e261f209c3666e842fd645a1e31f001c3a26def9 upstream
    
    This bug bit is set on CPUs which are only affected by Microarchitectural
    Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS) and not by any other MDS variant.
    
    This is important because the Store Buffers are partitioned between
    Hyper-Threads so cross thread forwarding is not possible. But if a thread
    enters or exits a sleep state the store buffer is repartitioned which can
    expose data from one thread to the other. This transition can be mitigated.
    
    That means that for CPUs which are only affected by MSBDS SMT can be
    enabled, if the CPU is not affected by other SMT sensitive vulnerabilities,
    e.g. L1TF. The XEON PHI variants fall into that category. Also the
    Silvermont/Airmont ATOMs, but for them it's not really relevant as they do
    not support SMT, but mark them for completeness sake.

    x86/speculation/mds: Add basic bug infrastructure for MDS
    
    commit ed5194c2732c8084af9fd159c146ea92bf137128 upstream
    
    Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS), is a class of side channel attacks
    on internal buffers in Intel CPUs. The variants are:
    
     - Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS) (CVE-2018-12126)
     - Microarchitectural Fill Buffer Data Sampling (MFBDS) (CVE-2018-12130)
     - Microarchitectural Load Port Data Sampling (MLPDS) (CVE-2018-12127)
    
    MSBDS leaks Store Buffer Entries which can be speculatively forwarded to a
    dependent load (store-to-load forwarding) as an optimization. The forward
    can also happen to a faulting or assisting load operation for a different
    memory address, which can be exploited under certain conditions. Store
    buffers are partitioned between Hyper-Threads so cross thread forwarding is
    not possible. But if a thread enters or exits a sleep state the store
    buffer is repartitioned which can expose data from one thread to the other.
    
    MFBDS leaks Fill Buffer Entries. Fill buffers are used internally to manage
    L1 miss situations and to hold data which is returned or sent in response
    to a memory or I/O operation. Fill buffers can forward data to a load
    operation and also write data to the cache. When the fill buffer is
    deallocated it can retain the stale data of the preceding operations which
    can then be forwarded to a faulting or assisting load operation, which can
    be exploited under certain conditions. Fill buffers are shared between
    Hyper-Threads so cross thread leakage is possible.
    
    MLDPS leaks Load Port Data. Load ports are used to perform load operations
    from memory or I/O. The received data is then forwarded to the register
    file or a subsequent operation. In some implementations the Load Port can
    contain stale data from a previous operation which can be forwarded to
    faulting or assisting loads under certain conditions, which again can be
    exploited eventually. Load ports are shared between Hyper-Threads so cross
    thread leakage is possible.
    
    All variants have the same mitigation for single CPU thread case (SMT off),
    so the kernel can treat them as one MDS issue.
    
    Add the basic infrastructure to detect if the current CPU is affected by
    MDS.

    commit d7b09c827a6cf291f66637a36f46928dd1423184 upstream
    
    Months ago, we have added code to allow direct access to MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL
    to the guest, which makes STIBP available to guests.  This was implemented
    by commits d28b387fb74d ("KVM/VMX: Allow direct access to
    MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL") and b2ac58f90540 ("KVM/SVM: Allow direct access to
    MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL").
    
    However, we never updated GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID to let userspace know that
    STIBP can be enabled in CPUID.  Fix that by updating
    kvm_cpuid_8000_0008_ebx_x86_features and kvm_cpuid_7_0_edx_x86_features.
