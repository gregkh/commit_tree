    usb: musb: da8xx: fix babble condition handling
    
    commit bd3486ded7a0c313a6575343e6c2b21d14476645 upstream.
    
    When babble condition happens, the musb controller might automatically
    turns off VBUS. On DA8xx platform, the controller generates drvvbus
    interrupt for turning off VBUS along with the babble interrupt.
    
    In this case, we should handle the babble interrupt first and recover
    from the babble condition.
    
    This change ignores the drvvbus interrupt if babble interrupt is also
    generated at the same time, so the babble recovery routine works
    properly.

    ath9k: fix tx99 potential info leak
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ee0a47186e2fa9aa1c56cadcea470ca0ba8c8692 ]
    
    When the user sets count to zero the string buffer would remain
    completely uninitialized which causes the kernel to parse its
    own stack data, potentially leading to an info leak. In addition
    to that, the string might be not terminated properly when the
    user data does not contain a 0-terminator.

    macvlan: Only deliver one copy of the frame to the macvlan interface
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dd6b9c2c332b40f142740d1b11fb77c653ff98ea ]
    
    This patch intoduces a slight adjustment for macvlan to address the fact
    that in source mode I was seeing two copies of any packet addressed to the
    macvlan interface being delivered where there should have been only one.
    
    The issue appears to be that one copy was delivered based on the source MAC
    address and then the second copy was being delivered based on the
    destination MAC address. To fix it I am just treating a unicast address
    match as though it is not a match since source based macvlan isn't supposed
    to be matching based on the destination MAC anyway.

    We could allocate less memory than intended because we do:

    The shift can overflow leading to a crash.  This is debugfs code so the

    raid5: Set R5_Expanded on parity devices as well as data.
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 235b6003fb28f0dd8e7ed8fbdb088bb548291766 ]
    
    When reshaping a fully degraded raid5/raid6 to a larger
    nubmer of devices, the new device(s) are not in-sync
    and so that can make the newly grown stripe appear to be
    "failed".
    To avoid this, we set the R5_Expanded flag to say "Even though
    this device is not fully in-sync, this block is safe so
    don't treat the device as failed for this stripe".
    This flag is set for data devices, not not for parity devices.
    
    Consequently, if you have a RAID6 with two devices that are partly
    recovered and a spare, and start a reshape to include the spare,
    then when the reshape gets past the point where the recovery was
    up to, it will think the stripes are failed and will get into
    an infinite loop, failing to make progress.
    
    So when contructing parity on an EXPAND_READY stripe,
    set R5_Expanded.

    pinctrl: adi2: Fix Kconfig build problem
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c363531dd814dc4fe10865722bf6b0f72ce4673 ]
    
    The build robot is complaining on Blackfin:
    
    drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c: In function 'port_setup':
    >> drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c:221:21: error: dereferencing
       pointer to incomplete type 'struct gpio_port_t'
          writew(readw(&regs->port_fer) & ~BIT(offset),
                            ^~
    drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c: In function 'adi_gpio_ack_irq':
    >> drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-adi2.c:266:18: error: dereferencing
    pointer to incomplete type 'struct bfin_pint_regs'
          if (readl(&regs->invert_set) & pintbit)
                         ^~
    It seems the driver need to include <asm/gpio.h> and <asm/irq.h>
    to compile.
    
    The Blackfin architecture was re-defining the Kconfig
    PINCTRL symbol which is not OK, so replaced this with
    PINCTRL_BLACKFIN_ADI2 which selects PINCTRL and PINCTRL_ADI2
    just like most arches do.
    
    Further, the old GPIO driver symbol GPIO_ADI was possible to
    select at the same time as selecting PINCTRL. This was not
    working because the arch-local <asm/gpio.h> header contains
    an explicit #ifndef PINCTRL clause making compilation break
    if you combine them. The same is true for DEBUG_MMRS.
    
    Make sure the ADI2 pinctrl driver is not selected at the same
    time as the old GPIO implementation. (This should be converted
    to use gpiolib or pincontrol and move to drivers/...) Also make
    sure the old GPIO_ADI driver or DEBUG_MMRS is not selected at
    the same time as the new PINCTRL implementation, and only make
    PINCTRL_ADI2 selectable for the Blackfin families that actually
    have it.
    
    This way it is still possible to add e.g. I2C-based pin
    control expanders on the Blackfin.

    PCI: Detach driver before procfs & sysfs teardown on device remove
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 16b6c8bb687cc3bec914de09061fcb8411951fda ]
    
    When removing a device, for example a VF being removed due to SR-IOV
    teardown, a "soft" hot-unplug via 'echo 1 > remove' in sysfs, or an actual
    hot-unplug, we first remove the procfs and sysfs attributes for the device
    before attempting to release the device from any driver bound to it.
    Unbinding the driver from the device can take time.  The device might need
    to write out data or it might be actively in use.  If it's in use by
    userspace through a vfio driver, the unbind might block until the user
    releases the device.  This leads to a potentially non-trivial amount of
    time where the device exists, but we've torn down the interfaces that
    userspace uses to examine devices, for instance lspci might generate this
    sort of error:
    
      pcilib: Cannot open /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:0a.3/config
      lspci: Unable to read the standard configuration space header of device 0000:01:0a.3
    
    We don't seem to have any dependence on this teardown ordering in the
    kernel, so let's unbind the driver first, which is also more symmetric with
    the instantiation of the device in pci_bus_add_device().

    xfs: fix log block underflow during recovery cycle verification
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f2a4505800607e537e9dd9dea4f55c4b0c30c7a ]
    
    It is possible for mkfs to format very small filesystems with too
    small of an internal log with respect to the various minimum size
    and block count requirements. If this occurs when the log happens to
    be smaller than the scan window used for cycle verification and the
    scan wraps the end of the log, the start_blk calculation in
    xlog_find_head() underflows and leads to an attempt to scan an
    invalid range of log blocks. This results in log recovery failure
    and a failed mount.
    
    Since there may be filesystems out in the wild with this kind of
    geometry, we cannot simply refuse to mount. Instead, cap the scan
    window for cycle verification to the size of the physical log. This
    ensures that the cycle verification proceeds as expected when the
    scan wraps the end of the log.

    bcache: fix wrong cache_misses statistics
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c157313791a999646901b3e3c6888514ebc36d62 ]
    
    Currently, Cache missed IOs are identified by s->cache_miss, but actually,
    there are many situations that missed IOs are not assigned a value for
    s->cache_miss in cached_dev_cache_miss(), for example, a bypassed IO
    (s->iop.bypass = 1), or the cache_bio allocate failed. In these situations,
    it will go to out_put or out_submit, and s->cache_miss is null, which leads
    bch_mark_cache_accounting() to treat this IO as a hit IO.

    [ Upstream commit 330a4db89d39a6b43f36da16824eaa7a7509d34d ]
    
    mutex_destroy does nothing most of time, but it's better to call
    it to make the code future proof and it also has some meaning
    for like mutex debug.
    
    As Coly pointed out in a previous review, bcache_exit() may not be
    able to handle all the references properly if userspace registers
    cache and backing devices right before bch_debug_init runs and
    bch_debug_init failes later. So not exposing userspace interface
    until everything is ready to avoid that issue.

    on the ordered write list, log_flush calls gfs2_ordered_write which
    calls filemap_fdatawrite. But since the inode had the jdata flag
    set, that calls gfs2_jdata_writepages, which tries to start a new
    transaction. A new transaction cannot be started because it tries
    to acquire the log_flush rwsem which is already locked by the log
    flush operation.
    
    The bottom line is: We cannot switch an inode from ordered to jdata
    until we eliminate any ordered data pages (via log flush) or any
    log_flush operation afterward will create the circular dependency
    above. So we need to flush the log before setting the diskflags to
    switch the file mode, then we need to remove the inode from the
    ordered writes list.
    
    Before this patch, the log flush was done for jdata->ordered, but
    that's wrong. If we're going from jdata to ordered, we don't need
    to call gfs2_log_flush because the call to filemap_fdatawrite will
    do it for us:
    
       filemap_fdatawrite() -> __filemap_fdatawrite_range()
          __filemap_fdatawrite_range() -> do_writepages()
             do_writepages() -> gfs2_jdata_writepages()
                gfs2_jdata_writepages() -> gfs2_log_flush()
    
    This patch modifies function do_gfs2_set_flags so that if a file
    has its jdata flag set, and it's already on the ordered write list,
    the log will be flushed and it will be removed from the list
    before setting the flag.

    thermal/drivers/step_wise: Fix temperature regulation misbehavior
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 07209fcf33542c1ff1e29df2dbdf8f29cdaacb10 ]
    
    There is a particular situation when the cooling device is cpufreq and the heat
    dissipation is not efficient enough where the temperature increases little by
    little until reaching the critical threshold and leading to a SoC reset.
    
    The behavior is reproducible on a hikey6220 with bad heat dissipation (eg.
    stacked with other boards).
    
    Running a simple C program doing while(1); for each CPU of the SoC makes the
    temperature to reach the passive regulation trip point and ends up to the
    maximum allowed temperature followed by a reset.
    
    This issue has been also reported by running the libhugetlbfs test suite.
    
    What is observed is a ping pong between two cpu frequencies, 1.2GHz and 900MHz
    while the temperature continues to grow.
    
    It appears the step wise governor calls get_target_state() the first time with
    the throttle set to true and the trend to 'raising'. The code selects logically
    the next state, so the cpu frequency decreases from 1.2GHz to 900MHz, so far so
    good. The temperature decreases immediately but still stays greater than the
    trip point, then get_target_state() is called again, this time with the
    throttle set to true *and* the trend to 'dropping'. From there the algorithm
    assumes we have to step down the state and the cpu frequency jumps back to
    1.2GHz. But the temperature is still higher than the trip point, so
    get_target_state() is called with throttle=1 and trend='raising' again, we jump
    to 900MHz, then get_target_state() is called with throttle=1 and
    trend='dropping', we jump to 1.2GHz, etc ... but the temperature does not
    stabilizes and continues to increase.
    
    [  237.922654] thermal thermal_zone0: Trip0[type=1,temp=65000]:trend=1,throttle=1
    [  237.922678] thermal thermal_zone0: Trip1[type=1,temp=75000]:trend=1,throttle=1
    [  237.922690] thermal cooling_device0: cur_state=0
    [  237.922701] thermal cooling_device0: old_target=0, target=1
    [  238.026656] thermal thermal_zone0: Trip0[type=1,temp=65000]:trend=2,throttle=1

    [  238.134679] thermal cooling_device0: cur_state=0
    [  238.134690] thermal cooling_device0: old_target=0, target=1
    
    In this situation the temperature continues to increase while the trend is
    oscillating between 'dropping' and 'raising'. We need to keep the current state
    untouched if the throttle is set, so the temperature can decrease or a higher
    state could be selected, thus preventing this oscillation.
    
    Keeping the next_target untouched when 'throttle' is true at 'dropping' time
    fixes the issue.
    
    The following traces show the governor does not change the next state if
    trend==2 (dropping) and throttle==1.

    After a while, if the temperature continues to increase, the next state becomes
    2 which is 720MHz on the hikey. That results in the temperature stabilizing
    around the trip point.

    IOW, this change is needed to keep the state for a cooling device if the
    temperature trend is oscillating while the temperature increases slightly.
    
    Without this change, the situation above leads to a catastrophic crash by a
    hardware reset on hikey. This issue has been reported to happen on an OMAP
    dra7xx also.

    _calc_vm_trans() does not handle the situation when some of the passed
    flags are 0 (which can happen if these VM flags do not make sense for
    the architecture). Improve the _calc_vm_trans() macro to return 0 in
    such situation. Since all passed flags are constant, this does not add
    any runtime overhead.

    powerpc/opal: Fix EBUSY bug in acquiring tokens
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 71e24d7731a2903b1ae2bba2b2971c654d9c2aa6 ]
    
    The current code checks the completion map to look for the first token
    that is complete. In some cases, a completion can come in but the
    token can still be on lease to the caller processing the completion.
    If this completed but unreleased token is the first token found in the
    bitmap by another tasks trying to acquire a token, then the
    __test_and_set_bit call will fail since the token will still be on
    lease. The acquisition will then fail with an EBUSY.
    
    This patch reorganizes the acquisition code to look at the
    opal_async_token_map for an unleased token. If the token has no lease
    it must have no outstanding completions so we should never see an
    EBUSY, unless we have leased out too many tokens. Since
    opal_async_get_token_inrerruptible is protected by a semaphore, we
    will practically never see EBUSY anymore.

    PCIe PME and native hotplug share the same interrupt number, so hotplug
    interrupts are also processed by PME.  In some cases, e.g., a Link Down
    interrupt, a device may be present but unreachable, so when we try to
    read its Root Status register, the read fails and we get all ones data
    (0xffffffff).
    
    Previously, we interpreted that data as PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME being set, i.e.,
    "some device has asserted PME," so we scheduled pcie_pme_work_fn().  This
    caused an infinite loop because pcie_pme_work_fn() tried to handle PME
    requests until PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME is cleared, but with the link down,
    PCI_EXP_RTSTA_PME can't be cleared.
    
    Check for the invalid 0xffffffff data everywhere we read the Root Status
    register.
    
    1469d17dd341 ("PCI: pciehp: Handle invalid data when reading from
    non-existent devices") added similar checks in the hotplug driver.

    target: Use system workqueue for ALUA transitions
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 207ee84133c00a8a2a5bdec94df4a5b37d78881c ]
    
    If tcmu-runner is processing a STPG and needs to change the kernel's
    ALUA state then we cannot use the same work queue for task management
    requests and ALUA transitions, because we could deadlock. The problem
    occurs when a STPG times out before tcmu-runner is able to
    call into target_tg_pt_gp_alua_access_state_store->
    core_alua_do_port_transition -> core_alua_do_transition_tg_pt ->
    queue_work. In this case, the tmr is on the work queue waiting for
    the STPG to complete, but the STPG transition is now queued behind
    the waiting tmr.
    
    Note:
    This bug will also be fixed by this patch:
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/target-devel/msg14560.html
    which switches the tmr code to use the system workqueues.
    
    For both, I am not sure if we need a dedicated workqueue since
    it is not a performance path and I do not think we need WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
    to make forward progress to free up memory like the block layer does.

    btrfs: add missing memset while reading compressed inline extents
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e1699d2d7bf6e6cce3e1baff19f9dd4595a58664 ]
    
    This is a story about 4 distinct (and very old) btrfs bugs.
    
    Commit c8b978188c ("Btrfs: Add zlib compression support") added
    three data corruption bugs for inline extents (bugs #1-3).
    
    Commit 93c82d5750 ("Btrfs: zero page past end of inline file items")
    fixed bug #1:  uncompressed inline extents followed by a hole and more
    extents could get non-zero data in the hole as they were read.  The fix
    was to add a memset in btrfs_get_extent to zero out the hole.
    
    Commit 166ae5a418 ("btrfs: fix inline compressed read err corruption")
    fixed bug #2:  compressed inline extents which contained non-zero bytes
    might be replaced with zero bytes in some cases.  This patch removed an
    unhelpful memset from uncompress_inline, but the case where memset is
    required was missed.
    
    There is also a memset in the decompression code, but this only covers
    decompressed data that is shorter than the ram_bytes from the extent
    ref record.  This memset doesn't cover the region between the end of the
    decompressed data and the end of the page.  It has also moved around a
    few times over the years, so there's no single patch to refer to.
    
    This patch fixes bug #3:  compressed inline extents followed by a hole
    and more extents could get non-zero data in the hole as they were read
    (i.e. bug #3 is the same as bug #1, but s/uncompressed/compressed/).
    The fix is the same:  zero out the hole in the compressed case too,
    by putting a memset back in uncompress_inline, but this time with
    correct parameters.
    
    The last and oldest bug, bug #0, is the cause of the offending inline
    extent/hole/extent pattern.  Bug #0 is a subtle and mostly-harmless quirk
    of behavior somewhere in the btrfs write code.  In a few special cases,
    an inline extent and hole are allowed to persist where they normally
    would be combined with later extents in the file.
    
    A fast reproducer for bug #0 is presented below.  A few offending extents
    are also created in the wild during large rsync transfers with the -S
    flag.  A Linux kernel build (git checkout; make allyesconfig; make -j8)
    will produce a handful of offending files as well.  Once an offending
    file is created, it can present different content to userspace each
    time it is read.
    
    Bug #0 is at least 4 and possibly 8 years old.  I verified every vX.Y
    kernel back to v3.5 has this behavior.  There are fossil records of this
    bug's effects in commits all the way back to v2.6.32.  I have no reason
    to believe bug #0 wasn't present at the beginning of btrfs compression
    support in v2.6.29, but I can't easily test kernels that old to be sure.
    
    It is not clear whether bug #0 is worth fixing.  A fix would likely
    require injecting extra reads into currently write-only paths, and most
    of the exceptional cases caused by bug #0 are already handled now.
    
    Whether we like them or not, bug #0's inline extents followed by holes
    are part of the btrfs de-facto disk format now, and we need to be able
    to read them without data corruption or an infoleak.  So enough about
    bug #0, let's get back to bug #3 (this patch).
    
    An example of on-disk structure leading to data corruption found in
    the wild:
    
            item 61 key (606890 INODE_ITEM 0) itemoff 9662 itemsize 160
                    inode generation 50 transid 50 size 47424 nbytes 49141
                    block group 0 mode 100644 links 1 uid 0 gid 0
                    rdev 0 flags 0x0(none)
            item 62 key (606890 INODE_REF 603050) itemoff 9642 itemsize 20
                    inode ref index 3 namelen 10 name: DB_File.so
            item 63 key (606890 EXTENT_DATA 0) itemoff 8280 itemsize 1362
                    inline extent data size 1341 ram 4085 compress(zlib)
            item 64 key (606890 EXTENT_DATA 4096) itemoff 8227 itemsize 53
                    extent data disk byte 5367308288 nr 20480
                    extent data offset 0 nr 45056 ram 45056
                    extent compression(zlib)
    
    Different data appears in userspace during each read of the 11 bytes
    between 4085 and 4096.  The extent in item 63 is not long enough to
    fill the first page of the file, so a memset is required to fill the
    space between item 63 (ending at 4085) and item 64 (beginning at 4096)
    with zero.
    
    Here is a reproducer from Liu Bo, which demonstrates another method
    of creating the same inline extent and hole pattern:
    
    Using 'page_poison=on' kernel command line (or enable
    CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING) run the following:
    
            # touch foo
            # chattr +c foo
            # xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -W 0 1000" foo
            # xfs_io -f -c "falloc 4 8188" foo
            # od -x foo
            # echo 3 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
            # od -x foo
    
    This produce the following on my box:
    
    Correct output:  file contains 1000 data bytes followed
    by zeros:
    
            0000000 cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd
            *
            0001740 cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd 0000 0000 0000 0000
            0001760 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
            *
            0020000
    
    Actual output:  the data after the first 1000 bytes
    will be different each run:
    
            0000000 cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd cdcd
            *

    perf symbols: Fix symbols__fixup_end heuristic for corner cases
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e7ede72a6d40cb3a30c087142d79381ca8a31dab ]
    
    The current symbols__fixup_end() heuristic for the last entry in the rb
    tree is suboptimal as it leads to not being able to recognize the symbol
    in the call graph in a couple of corner cases, for example:
    
     i) If the symbol has a start address (f.e. exposed via kallsyms)
        that is at a page boundary, then the roundup(curr->start, 4096)
        for the last entry will result in curr->start == curr->end with
        a symbol length of zero.
    
    ii) If the symbol has a start address that is shortly before a page
        boundary, then also here, curr->end - curr->start will just be
        very few bytes, where it's unrealistic that we could perform a
        match against.
    
    Instead, change the heuristic to roundup(curr->start, 4096) + 4096, so
    that we can catch such corner cases and have a better chance to find
    that specific symbol. It's still just best effort as the real end of the
    symbol is unknown to us (and could even be at a larger offset than the
    current range), but better than the current situation.
    
    Alexei reported that he recently run into case i) with a JITed eBPF
    program (these are all page aligned) as the last symbol which wasn't
    properly shown in the call graph (while other eBPF program symbols in
    the rb tree were displayed correctly). Since this is a generic issue,
    lets try to improve the heuristic a bit.

    afs: Fix afs_kill_pages()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7286a35e893176169b09715096a4aca557e2ccd2 ]
    
    Fix afs_kill_pages() in two ways:
    
     (1) If a writeback has been partially flushed, then if we try and kill the
         pages it contains, some of them may no longer be undergoing writeback
         and end_page_writeback() will assert.
    
         Fix this by checking to see whether the page in question is actually
         undergoing writeback before ending that writeback.
    
     (2) The loop that scans for pages to kill doesn't increase the first page
         index, and so the loop may not terminate, but it will try to process
         the same pages over and over again.
    
         Fix this by increasing the first page index to one after the last page
         we processed.

    [ Upstream commit ab94f5d0dd6fd82e7eeca5e7c8096eaea0a0261f ]
    
    The inode timestamps should be set from the client time
    in the status received from the server, rather than the
    server time which is meant for internal server use.
    
    Set AFS_SET_MTIME and populate the mtime for operations
    that take an input status, such as file/dir creation
    and StoreData.  If an input time is not provided the
    server will set the vnode times based on the current server
    time.
    
    In a situation where the server has some skew with the
    client, this could lead to the client seeing a timestamp
    in the future for a file that it just created or wrote.

    afs: Fix the maths in afs_fs_store_data()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 146a1192783697810b63a1e41c4d59fc93387340 ]
    
    afs_fs_store_data() works out of the size of the write it's going to make,
    but it uses 32-bit unsigned subtraction in one place that gets
    automatically cast to loff_t.
    
    However, if to < offset, then the number goes negative, but as the result
    isn't signed, this doesn't get sign-extended to 64-bits when placed in a
    loff_t.
    
    Fix by casting the operands to loff_t.

    [ Upstream commit 627f46943ff90bcc32ddeb675d881c043c6fa2ae ]
    
    Mode bits for an afs file should not be enforced in the usual
    way.
    
    For files, the absence of user bits can restrict file access
    with respect to what is granted by the server.
    
    These bits apply regardless of the owner or the current uid; the
    rest of the mode bits (group, other) are ignored.

    sched/deadline: Use deadline instead of period when calculating overflow
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2317d5f1c34913bac5971d93d69fb6c31bb74670 ]
    
    I was testing Daniel's changes with his test case, and tweaked it a
    little. Instead of having the runtime equal to the deadline, I
    increased the deadline ten fold.
    
    Daniel's test case had:
    
            attr.sched_runtime  = 2 * 1000 * 1000;          /* 2 ms */
            attr.sched_deadline = 2 * 1000 * 1000;          /* 2 ms */
            attr.sched_period   = 2 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000;   /* 2 s */
    
    To make it more interesting, I changed it to:
    
            attr.sched_runtime  =  2 * 1000 * 1000;         /* 2 ms */
            attr.sched_deadline = 20 * 1000 * 1000;         /* 20 ms */
            attr.sched_period   =  2 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000;  /* 2 s */
    
    The results were rather surprising. The behavior that Daniel's patch
    was fixing came back. The task started using much more than .1% of the
    CPU. More like 20%.
    
    Looking into this I found that it was due to the dl_entity_overflow()
    constantly returning true. That's because it uses the relative period
    against relative runtime vs the absolute deadline against absolute
    runtime.
    
      runtime / (deadline - t) > dl_runtime / dl_period
    
    There's even a comment mentioning this, and saying that when relative
    deadline equals relative period, that the equation is the same as using
    deadline instead of period. That comment is backwards! What we really
    want is:
    
      runtime / (deadline - t) > dl_runtime / dl_deadline
    
    We care about if the runtime can make its deadline, not its period. And
    then we can say "when the deadline equals the period, the equation is
    the same as using dl_period instead of dl_deadline".
    
    After correcting this, now when the task gets enqueued, it can throttle
    correctly, and Daniel's fix to the throttling of sleeping deadline
    tasks works even when the runtime and deadline are not the same.

    NFSD: fix nfsd_reset_versions for NFSv4.

    If you write "-2 -3 -4" to the "versions" file, it will
    notice that no versions are enabled, and nfsd_reset_versions()
    is called.
    This enables all major versions, not no minor versions.
    So we lose the invariant that NFSv4 is only advertised when
    at least one minor is enabled.

    net: bcmgenet: Power up the internal PHY before probing the MII
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6be371b053dc86f11465cc1abce2e99bda0a0574 ]
    
    When using the internal PHY it must be powered up when the MII is probed
    or the PHY will not be detected.  Since the PHY is powered up at reset
    this has not been a problem.  However, when the kernel is restarted with
    kexec the PHY will likely be powered down when the kernel starts so it
    will not be detected and the Ethernet link will not be established.
    
    This commit explicitly powers up the internal PHY when the GENET driver
    is probed to correct this behavior.

    [ Upstream commit fd567653bdb908009b650f079bfd4b63169e2ac4 ]
    
    The driver doesn't have a struct of_device_id table but supported devices
    are registered via Device Trees. This is working on the assumption that a
    I2C device registered via OF will always match a legacy I2C device ID and
    that the MODALIAS reported will always be of the form i2c:<device>.
    
    But this could change in the future so the correct approach is to have an
    OF device ID table if the devices are registered via OF.

    mac80211: Fix addition of mesh configuration element
    
    commit 57629915d568c522ac1422df7bba4bee5b5c7a7c upstream.
    
    The code was setting the capabilities byte to zero,
    after it was already properly set previously. Fix it.
    
    The bug was found while debugging hwsim mesh tests failures
    that happened since the commit mentioned below.

    KEYS: Don't permit request_key() to construct a new keyring
    
    commit 911b79cde95c7da0ec02f48105358a36636b7a71 upstream.
    
    If request_key() is used to find a keyring, only do the search part - don't
    do the construction part if the keyring was not found by the search.  We
    don't really want keyrings in the negative instantiated state since the
    rejected/negative instantiation error value in the payload is unioned with
    keyring metadata.
    
    Now the kernel gives an error:
    
            request_key("keyring", "#selinux,bdekeyring", "keyring", KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)

    Don't leak a key reference if request_key() tries to use a revoked keyring
    
    commit d0709f1e66e8066c4ac6a54620ec116aa41937c0 upstream.
    
    If a request_key() call to allocate and fill out a key attempts to insert the
    key structure into a revoked keyring, the key will leak, using memory and part
    of the user's key quota until the system reboots. This is from a failure of
    construct_alloc_key() to decrement the key's reference count after the attempt
    to insert into the requested keyring is rejected.
    
    key_put() needs to be called in the link_prealloc_failed callpath to ensure
    the unused key is released.

    ext4: fix crash when a directory's i_size is too small
    
    commit 9d5afec6b8bd46d6ed821aa1579634437f58ef1f upstream.
    
    On a ppc64 machine, when mounting a fuzzed ext2 image (generated by
    fsfuzzer) the following call trace is seen,
    
    VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6913 at /root/repos/linux/fs/buffer.c:1165 .__brelse.part.6+0x24/0x40

    system_call+0x58/0x6c
    
    This happens because the directory that ext4_find_entry() looks up has
    inode->i_size that is less than the block size of the filesystem. This
    causes 'nblocks' to have a value of zero. ext4_bread_batch() ends up not
    reading any of the directory file's blocks. This renders the entries in
    bh_use[] array to continue to have garbage data. buffer_uptodate() on
    bh_use[0] can then return a zero value upon which brelse() function is
    invoked.
    
    This commit fixes the bug by returning -ENOENT when the directory file
    has no associated blocks.

    USB: core: prevent malicious bNumInterfaces overflow
    
    commit 48a4ff1c7bb5a32d2e396b03132d20d552c0eca7 upstream.
    
    A malicious USB device with crafted descriptors can cause the kernel
    to access unallocated memory by setting the bNumInterfaces value too
    high in a configuration descriptor.  Although the value is adjusted
    during parsing, this adjustment is skipped in one of the error return
    paths.
    
    This patch prevents the problem by setting bNumInterfaces to 0
    initially.  The existing code already sets it to the proper value
    after parsing is complete.

    USB: uas and storage: Add US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for another JMicron JMS567 ID
    
    commit 62354454625741f0569c2cbe45b2d192f8fd258e upstream.
    
    There is another JMS567-based USB3 UAS enclosure (152d:0578) that fails
    with the following error:
    
    [sda] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE
    [sda] tag#0 Sense Key : Illegal Request [current]
    [sda] tag#0 Add. Sense: Invalid field in cdb
    
    The issue occurs both with UAS (occasionally) and mass storage
    (immediately after mounting a FS on a disk in the enclosure).
    
    Enabling US_FL_BROKEN_FUA quirk solves this issue.
    
    This patch adds an UNUSUAL_DEV with US_FL_BROKEN_FUA for the enclosure
    for both UAS and mass storage.

    crypto: salsa20 - fix blkcipher_walk API usage
    
    commit ecaaab5649781c5a0effdaf298a925063020500e upstream.
    
    When asked to encrypt or decrypt 0 bytes, both the generic and x86
    implementations of Salsa20 crash in blkcipher_walk_done(), either when
    doing 'kfree(walk->buffer)' or 'free_page((unsigned long)walk->page)',
    because walk->buffer and walk->page have not been initialized.
    
    The bug is that Salsa20 is calling blkcipher_walk_done() even when
    nothing is in 'walk.nbytes'.  But blkcipher_walk_done() is only meant to
    be called when a nonzero number of bytes have been provided.
    
    The broken code is part of an optimization that tries to make only one
    call to salsa20_encrypt_bytes() to process inputs that are not evenly
    divisible by 64 bytes.  To fix the bug, just remove this "optimization"
    and use the blkcipher_walk API the same way all the other users do.
    
    Reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int main()
        {

                };
                char key[16] = { 0 };
    
                algfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);

    crypto: hmac - require that the underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed
    
    commit af3ff8045bbf3e32f1a448542e73abb4c8ceb6f1 upstream.
    
    Because the HMAC template didn't check that its underlying hash
    algorithm is unkeyed, trying to use "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))"
    through AF_ALG or through KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE resulted in the inner HMAC
    being used without having been keyed, resulting in sha3_update() being
    called without sha3_init(), causing a stack buffer overflow.
    
    This is a very old bug, but it seems to have only started causing real
    problems when SHA-3 support was added (requires CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA3)
    because the innermost hash's state is ->import()ed from a zeroed buffer,
    and it just so happens that other hash algorithms are fine with that,
    but SHA-3 is not.  However, there could be arch or hardware-dependent
    hash algorithms also affected; I couldn't test everything.
    
    Fix the bug by introducing a function crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
    which tests whether a shash algorithm is keyed.  Then update the HMAC
    template to require that its underlying hash algorithm is unkeyed.
    
    Here is a reproducer:
    
        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>
    
        int main()
        {
            int algfd;
            struct sockaddr_alg addr = {
                .salg_type = "hash",
                .salg_name = "hmac(hmac(sha3-512-generic))",
            };
            char key[4096] = { 0 };
    
            algfd = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
            bind(algfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
            setsockopt(algfd, SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, key, sizeof(key));
