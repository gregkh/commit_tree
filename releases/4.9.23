    dma-buf: add support for compat ioctl
    
    commit 888022c0473d079bff9b47fb50434b1f20f8f37f upstream.
    
    Add compat ioctl support to dma-buf. This lets one to use DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC
    ioctl from 32bit application on 64bit kernel. Data structures for both 32
    and 64bit modes are same, so there is no need for additional translation
    layer.

    net/mlx4_core: Fix when to save some qp context flags for dynamic VST to VGT transitions
    
    commit 7c3945bc2073554bb2ecf983e073dee686679c53 upstream.
    
    Save the qp context flags byte containing the flag disabling vlan stripping
    in the RESET to INIT qp transition, rather than in the INIT to RTR
    transition. Per the firmware spec, the flags in this byte are active
    in the RESET to INIT transition.
    
    As a result of saving the flags in the incorrect qp transition, when
    switching dynamically from VGT to VST and back to VGT, the vlan
    remained stripped (as is required for VST) and did not return to
    not-stripped (as is required for VGT).

    net/mlx4_core: Fix racy CQ (Completion Queue) free
    
    commit 291c566a28910614ce42d0ffe82196eddd6346f4 upstream.
    
    In function mlx4_cq_completion() and mlx4_cq_event(), the
    radix_tree_lookup requires a rcu_read_lock.
    This is mandatory: if another core frees the CQ, it could
    run the radix_tree_node_rcu_free() call_rcu() callback while
    its being used by the radix tree lookup function.
    
    Additionally, in function mlx4_cq_event(), since we are adding
    the rcu lock around the radix-tree lookup, we no longer need to take
    the spinlock. Also, the synchronize_irq() call for the async event
    eliminates the need for incrementing the cq reference count in
    mlx4_cq_event().
    
    Other changes:
    1. In function mlx4_cq_free(), replace spin_lock_irq with spin_lock:
       we no longer take this spinlock in the interrupt context.
       The spinlock here, therefore, simply protects against different
       threads simultaneously invoking mlx4_cq_free() for different cq's.
    
    2. In function mlx4_cq_free(), we move the radix tree delete to before
       the synchronize_irq() calls. This guarantees that we will not
       access this cq during any subsequent interrupts, and therefore can
       safely free the CQ after the synchronize_irq calls. The rcu_read_lock
       in the interrupt handlers only needs to protect against corrupting the
       radix tree; the interrupt handlers may access the cq outside the
       rcu_read_lock due to the synchronize_irq calls which protect against
       premature freeing of the cq.
    
    3. In function mlx4_cq_event(), we change the mlx_warn message to mlx4_dbg.
    
    4. We leave the cq reference count mechanism in place, because it is
       still needed for the cq completion tasklet mechanism.

    usb: hub: Wait for connection to be reestablished after port reset
    
    commit 22547c4cc4fe20698a6a85a55b8788859134b8e4 upstream.
    
    On a system with a defective USB device connected to an USB hub,
    an endless sequence of port connect events was observed. The sequence
    of events as observed is as follows:
    
    - Port reports connected event (port status=USB_PORT_STAT_CONNECTION).
    - Event handler debounces port and resets it by calling hub_port_reset().
    - hub_port_reset() calls hub_port_wait_reset() to wait for the reset
      to complete.
    - The reset completes, but USB_PORT_STAT_CONNECTION is not immediately
      set in the port status register.
    - hub_port_wait_reset() returns -ENOTCONN.
    - Port initialization sequence is aborted.
    - A few milliseconds later, the port again reports a connected event,
      and the sequence repeats.
    
    This continues either forever or, randomly, stops if the connection
    is already re-established when the port status is read. It results in
    a high rate of udev events. This in turn destabilizes userspace since
    the above sequence holds the device mutex pretty much continuously
    and prevents userspace from actually reading the device status.
    
    To prevent the problem from happening, let's wait for the connection
    to be re-established after a port reset. If the device was actually
    disconnected, the code will still return an error, but it will do so
    only after the long reset timeout.

    blk-mq: Avoid memory reclaim when remapping queues
    
    commit 36e1f3d107867b25c616c2fd294f5a1c9d4e5d09 upstream.
    
    While stressing memory and IO at the same time we changed SMT settings,
    we were able to consistently trigger deadlocks in the mm system, which
    froze the entire machine.
    
    I think that under memory stress conditions, the large allocations
    performed by blk_mq_init_rq_map may trigger a reclaim, which stalls
    waiting on the block layer remmaping completion, thus deadlocking the
    system.  The trace below was collected after the machine stalled,
    waiting for the hotplug event completion.
    
    The simplest fix for this is to make allocations in this path
    non-reclaimable, with GFP_NOIO.  With this patch, We couldn't hit the
    issue anymore.
    
    This should apply on top of Jens's for-next branch cleanly.
    
    Changes since v1:
      - Use GFP_NOIO instead of GFP_NOWAIT.

    MIPS: IRQ Stack: Fix erroneous jal to plat_irq_dispatch
    
    commit c25f8064c1d5731a2ce5664def890140dcdd3e5c upstream.
    
    Commit dda45f701c9d ("MIPS: Switch to the irq_stack in interrupts")
    changed both the normal and vectored interrupt handlers. Unfortunately
    the vectored version, "except_vec_vi_handler", was incorrectly modified
    to unconditionally jal to plat_irq_dispatch, rather than doing a jalr to
    the vectored handler that has been set up. This is ok for many platforms
    which set the vectored handler to plat_irq_dispatch anyway, but will
    cause problems with platforms that use other handlers.

    MIPS: Switch to the irq_stack in interrupts
    
    commit dda45f701c9d7ad4ac0bb446e3a96f6df9a468d9 upstream.
    
    When enterring interrupt context via handle_int or except_vec_vi, switch
    to the irq_stack of the current CPU if it is not already in use.
    
    The current stack pointer is masked with the thread size and compared to
    the base or the irq stack. If it does not match then the stack pointer
    is set to the top of that stack, otherwise this is a nested irq being
    handled on the irq stack so the stack pointer should be left as it was.
    
    The in-use stack pointer is placed in the callee saved register s1. It
    will be saved to the stack when plat_irq_dispatch is invoked and can be
    restored once control returns here.

    MIPS: Only change $28 to thread_info if coming from user mode
    
    commit 510d86362a27577f5ee23f46cfb354ad49731e61 upstream.
    
    The SAVE_SOME macro is used to save the execution context on all
    exceptions.
    If an exception occurs while executing user code, the stack is switched
    to the kernel's stack for the current task, and register $28 is switched
    to point to the current_thread_info, which is at the bottom of the stack
    region.
    If the exception occurs while executing kernel code, the stack is left,
    and this change ensures that register $28 is not updated. This is the
    correct behaviour when the kernel can be executing on the separate irq
    stack, because the thread_info will not be at the base of it.
    
    With this change, register $28 is only switched to it's kernel
    conventional usage of the currrent thread info pointer at the point at
    which execution enters kernel space. Doing it on every exception was
    redundant, but OK without an IRQ stack, but will be erroneous once that
    is introduced.

    mtd: bcm47xxpart: fix parsing first block after aligned TRX
    
    commit bd5d21310133921021d78995ad6346f908483124 upstream.
    
    After parsing TRX we should skip to the first block placed behind it.
    Our code was working only with TRX with length not aligned to the
    blocksize. In other cases (length aligned) it was missing the block
    places right after TRX.
    
    This fixes calculation and simplifies the comment.

    i2c: bcm2835: Fix hang for writing messages larger than 16 bytes
    
    commit e2474541032db65d02bf88b6a8c2f954654b443f upstream.
    
    Writing messages larger than the FIFO size results in a hang, rendering
    the machine unusable. This is because the RXD status flag is set on the
    first interrupt which results in bcm2835_drain_rxfifo() stealing bytes
    from the buffer. The controller continues to trigger interrupts waiting
    for the missing bytes, but bcm2835_fill_txfifo() has none to give.
    In this situation wait_for_completion_timeout() apparently is unable to
    stop the madness.
    
    The BCM2835 ARM Peripherals datasheet has this to say about the flags:
      TXD: is set when the FIFO has space for at least one byte of data.
      RXD: is set when the FIFO contains at least one byte of data.
      TXW: is set during a write transfer and the FIFO is less than full.
      RXR: is set during a read transfer and the FIFO is or more full.
    
    Implementing the logic from the downstream i2c-bcm2708 driver solved
    the hang problem.

    orangefs: fix buffer size mis-match between kernel space and user space.
    
    commit eb68d0324dc4d88ab0d6159bdcd98c247a3a8954 upstream.
    
    The deamon through which the kernel module communicates with the userspace
    part of Orangefs, the "client-core", sends initialization data to the
    kernel module with ioctl. The initialization data was built by the
    client-core in a 2k buffer and copy_from_user'd into a 1k buffer
    in the kernel module. When more than 1k of initialization data needed
    to be sent, some was lost, reducing the usability of the control by which
    debug levels are set. This patch sets the kernel side buffer to 2K to
    match the userspace side...

    drm/i915: Stop using RP_DOWN_EI on Baytrail
    
    commit 8f68d591d4765b2e1ce9d916ac7bc5583285c4ad upstream.
    
    On Baytrail, we manually calculate busyness over the evaluation interval
    to avoid issues with miscaluations with RC6 enabled. However, it turns
    out that the DOWN_EI interrupt generator is completely bust - it
    operates in two modes, continuous or never. Neither of which are
    conducive to good behaviour. Stop unmask the DOWN_EI interrupt and just
    compute everything from the UP_EI which does seem to correspond to the
    desired interval.
    
    v2: Fixup gen6_rps_pm_mask() as well
    v3: Inline vlv_c0_above() to combine the now identical elapsed
    calculation for up/down and simplify the threshold testing

    drm/i915: Drop support for I915_EXEC_CONSTANTS_* execbuf parameters.
    
    commit 0f5418e564ac6452b9086295646e602a9addc4bf upstream.
    
    This patch makes the I915_PARAM_HAS_EXEC_CONSTANTS getparam return 0
    (indicating the optional feature is not supported), and makes execbuf
    always return -EINVAL if the flags are used.
    
    Apparently, no userspace ever shipped which used this optional feature:
    I checked the git history of Mesa, xf86-video-intel, libva, and Beignet,
    and there were zero commits showing a use of these flags.  Kernel commit
    72bfa19c8deb4 apparently introduced the feature prematurely.  According
    to Chris, the intention was to use this in cairo-drm, but "the use was
    broken for gen6", so I don't think it ever happened.
    
    'relative_constants_mode' has always been tracked per-device, but this
    has actually been wrong ever since hardware contexts were introduced, as
    the INSTPM register is saved (and automatically restored) as part of the
    render ring context. The software per-device value could therefore get
    out of sync with the hardware per-context value.  This meant that using
    them is actually unsafe: a client which tried to use them could damage
    the state of other clients, causing the GPU to interpret their BO
    offsets as absolute pointers, leading to bogus memory reads.
    
    These flags were also never ported to execlist mode, making them no-ops
    on Gen9+ (which requires execlists), and Gen8 in the default mode.
    
    On Gen8+, userspace can write these registers directly, achieving the
    same effect.  On Gen6-7.5, it likely makes sense to extend the command
    parser to support them.  I don't think anyone wants this on Gen4-5.
    
    Based on a patch by Dave Gordon.
    
    v3: Return -ENODEV for the getparam, as this is what we do for other
        obsolete features.  Suggested by Chris Wilson.

    drm/i915: Avoid tweaking evaluation thresholds on Baytrail v3
    
    commit 34dc8993eef63681b062871413a9484008a2a78f upstream.
    
    Certain Baytrails, namely the 4 cpu core variants, have been
    plaqued by spurious system hangs, mostly occurring with light loads.
    
    Multiple bisects by various people point to a commit which changes the
    reclocking strategy for Baytrail to follow its bigger brethen:
    commit 8fb55197e64d ("drm/i915: Agressive downclocking on Baytrail")
    
    There is also a review comment attached to this commit from Deepak S
    on avoiding punit access on Cherryview and thus it was excluded on
    common reclocking path. By taking the same approach and omitting
    the punit access by not tweaking the thresholds when the hardware
    has been asked to move into different frequency, considerable gains
    in stability have been observed.
    
    With J1900 box, light render/video load would end up in system hang
    in usually less than 12 hours. With this patch applied, the cumulative
    uptime has now been 34 days without issues. To provoke system hang,
    light loads on both render and bsd engines in parallel have been used:
    glxgears >/dev/null 2>/dev/null &
    mpv --vo=vaapi --hwdec=vaapi --loop=inf vid.mp4
    
    So far, author has not witnessed system hang with above load
    and this patch applied. Reports from the tenacious people at
    kernel bugzilla are also promising.
    
    Considering that the punit access frequency with this patch is
    considerably less, there is a possibility that this will push
    the, still unknown, root cause past the triggering point on most loads.
    
    But as we now can reliably reproduce the hang independently,
    we can reduce the pain that users are having and use a
    static thresholds until a root cause is found.

    drm/i915: Nuke debug messages from the pipe update critical section
    
    commit edd06b8353772dca7afcd4640dafa83b521edd55 upstream.
    
    printks are slow so we should not be doing them from the vblank evade
    critical section. These could explain why we sometimes seem to
    blow past our 100 usec deadline.
    
    The problem has been there ever since commit bfd16b2a23dc ("drm/i915:
    Make updating pipe without modeset atomic.") but it may not have
    been readily visible until commit e1edbd44e23b ("drm/i915: Complain
    if we take too long under vblank evasion.") increased our chances
    of noticing it.

        drm/i915/gen9: Fix PCODE polling during CDCLK change notification
    
    there is still one report of the CDCLK-change request timing out on a
    KBL machine, see the Reference link. On that machine the maximum time
    the request took to succeed was 34ms, so increase the timeout to 50ms.
    
    v2:
    - Change timeout from 100 to 50 ms to maintain the current 50 ms limit
      for atomic waits in the driver. (Chris, Tvrtko)
