    ARC: signal handling robustify
    
    commit e4140819dadc3624accac8294881bca8a3cba4ed upstream.
    
    A malicious signal handler / restorer can DOS the system by fudging the
    user regs saved on stack, causing weird things such as sigreturn returning
    to user mode PC but cpu state still being kernel mode....
    
    Ensure that in sigreturn path status32 always has U bit; any other bogosity
    (gargbage PC etc) will be taken care of by normal user mode exceptions mechanisms.
    
    Reproducer signal handler:
    
        void handle_sig(int signo, siginfo_t *info, void *context)
        {
            ucontext_t *uc = context;
            struct user_regs_struct *regs = &(uc->uc_mcontext.regs);
    
            regs->scratch.status32 = 0;
        }
    
    Before the fix, kernel would go off to weeds like below:

    UBI: fix soft lockup in ubi_check_volume()
    
    commit 9aa272b492e7551a9ee0e2c83c720ea013698485 upstream.
    
    Running mtd-utils/tests/ubi-tests/io_basic.c could cause
    soft lockup or watchdog reset. It is because *updatevol*
    will perform ubi_check_volume() after updating finish
    and this function will full scan the updated lebs if the
    volume is initialized as STATIC_VOLUME.
    
    This patch adds *cond_resched()* in the loop of lebs scan
    to avoid soft lockup.

    registering of hwmon device to resource-managed version. It mostly did
    it except the main thing - it forgot to use devm-like function so the
    hwmon device leaked after device removal or probe failure.

    staging: panel: fix lcd type
    
    commit 2c20d92dad5db6440cfa88d811b69fd605240ce4 upstream.
    
    the lcd type as defined in the Kconfig is not matching in the code.
    as a result the rs, rw and en pins were getting interchanged.
    Kconfig defines the value of PANEL_LCD to be 1 if we select custom
    configuration but in the code LCD_TYPE_CUSTOM is defined as 5.
    
    my hardware is LCD_TYPE_CUSTOM, but the pins were assigned to it
    as pins of LCD_TYPE_OLD, and it was not working.
    Now values are corrected with referenece to the values defined in
    Kconfig and it is working.
    checked on JHD204A lcd with LCD_TYPE_CUSTOM configuration.

    usb: gadget: printer: enqueue printer's response for setup request
    
    commit eb132ccbdec5df46e29c9814adf76075ce83576b upstream.
    
    Function-specific setup requests should be handled in such a way, that
    apart from filling in the data buffer, the requests are also actually
    enqueued: if function-specific setup is called from composte_setup(),
    the "usb_ep_queue()" block of code in composite_setup() is skipped.
    
    The printer function lacks this part and it results in e.g. get device id
    requests failing: the host expects some response, the device prepares it
    but does not equeue it for sending to the host, so the host finally asserts
    timeout.
    
    This patch adds enqueueing the prepared responses.

    ext4: fix data corruption caused by unwritten and delayed extents
    
    commit d2dc317d564a46dfc683978a2e5a4f91434e9711 upstream.
    
    Currently it is possible to lose whole file system block worth of data
    when we hit the specific interaction with unwritten and delayed extents
    in status extent tree.
    
    The problem is that when we insert delayed extent into extent status
    tree the only way to get rid of it is when we write out delayed buffer.
    However there is a limitation in the extent status tree implementation
    so that when inserting unwritten extent should there be even a single
    delayed block the whole unwritten extent would be marked as delayed.
    
    At this point, there is no way to get rid of the delayed extents,
    because there are no delayed buffers to write out. So when a we write
    into said unwritten extent we will convert it to written, but it still
    remains delayed.
    
    When we try to write into that block later ext4_da_map_blocks() will set
    the buffer new and delayed and map it to invalid block which causes
    the rest of the block to be zeroed loosing already written data.
    
    For now we can fix this by simply not allowing to set delayed status on
    written extent in the extent status tree. Also add WARN_ON() to make
    sure that we notice if this happens in the future.
    
    This problem can be easily reproduced by running the following xfs_io.
    
    xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa 4096 2048" \
              -c "falloc 0 131072" \
              -c "pwrite -S 0xbb 65536 2048" \
              -c "fsync" /mnt/test/fff
    
    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xdd 67584 2048" /mnt/test/fff
    
    This can be theoretically also reproduced by at random by running fsx,
    but it's not very reliable, though on machines with bigger page size
    (like ppc) this can be seen more often (especially xfstest generic/127)

    rbd: end I/O the entire obj_request on error
    
    commit 082a75dad84d79d1c15ea9e50f31cb4bb4fa7fd6 upstream.
    
    When we end I/O struct request with error, we need to pass
    obj_request->length as @nr_bytes so that the entire obj_request worth
    of bytes is completed.  Otherwise block layer ends up confused and we
    trip on
    
        rbd_assert(more ^ (which == img_request->obj_request_count));
    
    in rbd_img_obj_callback() due to more being true no matter what.  We
    already do it in most cases but we are missing some, in particular
    those where we don't even get a chance to submit any obj_requests, due
    to an early -ENOMEM for example.
    
    A number of obj_request->xferred assignments seem to be redundant but
    I haven't touched any of obj_request->xferred stuff to keep this small
    and isolated.

    tty/serial: at91: maxburst was missing for dma transfers
    
    commit a8d4e01637902311c5643b69a5c80e2805f04054 upstream.
    
    Maxburst was not set when doing the dma slave configuration. This value
    is checked by the recently introduced xdmac. It causes an error when
    doing the slave configuration and so prevents from using dma.

    serial: of-serial: Remove device_type = "serial" registration
    
    commit 6befa9d883385c580369a2cc9e53fbf329771f6d upstream.
    
    Do not probe all serial drivers by of_serial.c which are using
    device_type = "serial"; property. Only drivers which have valid
    compatible strings listed in the driver should be probed.
    
    When PORT_UNKNOWN is setup probe will fail anyway.
    
    Arnd quotation about driver historical background:
    "when I wrote that driver initially, the idea was that it would
    get used as a stub to hook up all other serial drivers but after
    that, the common code learned to create platform devices from DT"
    
    This patch fix the problem with on the system with xilinx_uartps and
    16550a where of_serial failed to register for xilinx_uartps and because
    of irq_dispose_mapping() removed irq_desc. Then when xilinx_uartps was asking
    for irq with request_irq() EINVAL is returned.

    ALSA: hda - Fix mute-LED fixed mode
    
    commit ee52e56e7b12834476cd0031c5986254ba1b6317 upstream.
    
    The mute-LED mode control has the fixed on/off states that are
    supposed to remain on/off regardless of the master switch.  However,
    this doesn't work actually because the vmaster hook is called in the
    vmaster code itself.
    
    This patch fixes it by calling the hook indirectly after checking the
    mute LED mode.

    commit 7241ea558c6715501e777396b5fc312c372e11d9 upstream.
    
    Looks like audigy emu10k2 (probably emu10k1 - sb live too) support two
    modes for DMA. Second mode is useful for 64 bit os with more then 2 GB
    of ram (fixes problems with big soundfont loading)
    
    1) 32MB from 2 GB address space using 8192 pages (used now as default)
    2) 16MB from 4 GB address space using 4096 pages
    
    Mode is set using HCFG_EXPANDED_MEM flag in HCFG register.
    Also format of emu10k2 page table is then different.

    ALSA: emu10k1: Fix card shortname string buffer overflow
    
    commit d02260824e2cad626fb2a9d62e27006d34b6dedc upstream.
    
    Some models provide too long string for the shortname that has 32bytes
    including the terminator, and it results in a non-terminated string
    exposed to the user-space.  This isn't too critical, though, as the
    string is stopped at the succeeding longname string.
    
    This patch fixes such entries by dropping "SB" prefix (it's enough to
    fit within 32 bytes, so far).  Meanwhile, it also changes strcpy()
    with strlcpy() to make sure that this kind of problem won't happen in
    future, too.

    ALSA: emux: Fix mutex deadlock in OSS emulation
    
    commit 1c94e65c668f44d2c69ae7e7fc268ab3268fba3e upstream.
    
    The OSS emulation in synth-emux helper has a potential AB/BA deadlock
    at the simultaneous closing and opening:
    
      close ->
        snd_seq_release() ->
          sne_seq_free_client() ->
            snd_seq_delete_all_ports(): takes client->ports_mutex ->
              port_delete() ->
                snd_emux_unuse(): takes emux->register_mutex
    
      open ->
        snd_seq_oss_open() ->
          snd_emux_open_seq_oss(): takes emux->register_mutex ->
            snd_seq_event_port_attach() ->
              snd_seq_create_port(): takes client->ports_mutex
    
    This patch addresses the deadlock by reducing the rance taking
    emux->register_mutex in snd_emux_open_seq_oss().  The lock is needed
    for the refcount handling, so move it locally.  The calls in
    emux_seq.c are already with the mutex, thus they are replaced with the
    version without mutex lock/unlock.

    ALSA: emux: Fix mutex deadlock at unloading
    
    commit 07b0e5d49d227e3950cb13a3e8caf248ef2a310e upstream.
    
    The emux-synth driver has a possible AB/BA mutex deadlock at unloading
    the emu10k1 driver:
    
      snd_emux_free() ->
        snd_emux_detach_seq(): mutex_lock(&emu->register_mutex) ->
          snd_seq_delete_kernel_client() ->
            snd_seq_free_client(): mutex_lock(&register_mutex)
    
      snd_seq_release() ->
        snd_seq_free_client(): mutex_lock(&register_mutex) ->
          snd_seq_delete_all_ports() ->
            snd_emux_unuse(): mutex_lock(&emu->register_mutex)
    
    Basically snd_emux_detach_seq() doesn't need a protection of
    emu->register_mutex as it's already being unregistered.  So, we can
    get rid of this for avoiding the deadlock.

    This can cause crashes if we do a disconnect, followed by a connect().
