    media: videobuf2-dma-sg: Fix buf->vb NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit d55c3ee6b4c7b76326eb257403762f8bd7cc48c2 upstream.
    
    Commit a4b83deb3e76 ("media: videobuf2: rework vb2_mem_ops API")
    added a new vb member to struct vb2_dma_sg_buf, but it only added
    code setting this to the vb2_dma_sg_alloc() function and not to the
    vb2_dma_sg_get_userptr() and vb2_dma_sg_attach_dmabuf() which also
    create vb2_dma_sg_buf objects.
    
    This is causing a crash due to a NULL pointer deref when using
    libcamera on devices with an Intel IPU3 (qcam app).
    
    Fix these crashes by assigning buf->vb in the other 2 functions too,
    note libcamera tests the vb2_dma_sg_get_userptr() path, the change
    to the vb2_dma_sg_attach_dmabuf() path is untested.

    x86/sev: Make the #VC exception stacks part of the default stacks storage
    
    commit 541ac97186d9ea88491961a46284de3603c914fd upstream.
    
    The size of the exception stacks was increased by the commit in Fixes,
    resulting in stack sizes greater than a page in size. The #VC exception
    handling was only mapping the first (bottom) page, resulting in an
    SEV-ES guest failing to boot.
    
    Make the #VC exception stacks part of the default exception stacks
    storage and allocate them with a CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT=y .config. Map
    them only when a SEV-ES guest has been detected.
    
    Rip out the custom VC stacks mapping and storage code.

    arch/cc: Introduce a function to check for confidential computing features
    
    commit 46b49b12f3fc5e1347dba37d4639e2165f447871 upstream.
    
    In preparation for other confidential computing technologies, introduce
    a generic helper function, cc_platform_has(), that can be used to
    check for specific active confidential computing attributes, like
    memory encryption. This is intended to eliminate having to add multiple
    technology-specific checks to the code (e.g. if (sev_active() ||
    tdx_active() || ... ).

    IMA: reject unknown hash algorithms in ima_get_hash_algo
    
    commit cb181da161963eddc9de0000de6ab2c7942be219 upstream.
    
    The new function validate_hash_algo() assumed that ima_get_hash_algo()
    always return a valid 'enum hash_algo', but it returned the

    Previous fix aded bpf_clamp_umax() helper use to re-validate boundaries.
    While that works correctly, it introduces more branches, which blows up
    past 1 million instructions in no-alu32 variant of strobemeta selftests.
    
    Switching len variable from u32 to u64 also fixes the issue and reduces
    the number of validated instructions, so use that instead. Fix this

    selftests/x86/iopl: Adjust to the faked iopl CLI/STI usage
    
    commit a72fdfd21e01c626273ddcf5ab740d4caef4be54 upstream.
    
    Commit in Fixes changed the iopl emulation to not #GP on CLI and STI
    because it would break some insane luserspace tools which would toggle
    interrupts.
    
    The corresponding selftest would rely on the fact that executing CLI/STI
    would trigger a #GP and thus detect it this way but since that #GP is
    not happening anymore, the detection is now wrong too.
    
    Extend the test to actually look at the IF flag and whether executing
    those insns had any effect on it. The STI detection needs to have the
    fact that interrupts were previously disabled, passed in so do that from
    the previous CLI test, i.e., STI test needs to follow a previous CLI one
    for it to make sense.

    ath10k: fix invalid dma_addr_t token assignment
    
    commit 937e79c67740d1d84736730d679f3cb2552f990e upstream.
    
    Using a kernel pointer in place of a dma_addr_t token can
    lead to undefined behavior if that makes it into cache
    management functions. The compiler caught one such attempt
    in a cast:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/mac.c: In function 'ath10k_add_interface':
    drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/mac.c:5586:47: error: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast]
     5586 |                         arvif->beacon_paddr = (dma_addr_t)arvif->beacon_buf;
          |                                               ^
    
    Looking through how this gets used down the way, I'm fairly
    sure that beacon_paddr is never accessed again for ATH10K_DEV_TYPE_HL
    devices, and if it was accessed, that would be a bug.
    
    Change the assignment to use a known-invalid address token
    instead, which avoids the warning and makes it easier to catch
    bugs if it does end up getting used.

    drm/amd/display: Look at firmware version to determine using dmub on dcn21
    
    commit 91adec9e07097e538691daed5d934e7886dd1dc3 upstream.
    
    commit 652de07addd2 ("drm/amd/display: Fully switch to dmub for all dcn21
    asics") switched over to using dmub on Renoir to fix Gitlab 1735, but this
    implied a new dependency on newer firmware which might not be met on older
    kernel versions.
    
    Since sw_init runs before hw_init, there is an opportunity to determine
    whether or not the firmware version is new to adjust the behavior.

    pinctrl: amd: Add irq field data
    
    commit 7e6f8d6f4a42ef9b693ff1b49267c546931d4619 upstream.
    
    pinctrl_amd use gpiochip_get_data() to get their local state containers
    back from the gpiochip passed as amd_gpio chip data.
    
    Hence added irq field data to get directly using amd_gpio chip data.

    SUNRPC: Partial revert of commit 6f9f17287e78
    
    commit ea7a1019d8baf8503ecd6e3ec8436dec283569e6 upstream.
    
    The premise of commit 6f9f17287e78 ("SUNRPC: Mitigate cond_resched() in
    xprt_transmit()") was that cond_resched() is expensive and unnecessary
    when there has been just a single send.
    The point of cond_resched() is to ensure that tasks that should pre-empt
    this one get a chance to do so when it is safe to do so. The code prior
    to commit 6f9f17287e78 failed to take into account that it was keeping a
    rpc_task pinned for longer than it needed to, and so rather than doing a
    full revert, let's just move the cond_resched.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix PCIe Max Payload Size setting
    
    commit a4e17d65dafdd3513042d8f00404c9b6068a825c upstream.
    
    Change PCIe Max Payload Size setting in PCIe Device Control register to 512
    bytes to align with PCIe Link Initialization sequence as defined in Marvell
    Armada 3700 Functional Specification. According to the specification,
    maximal Max Payload Size supported by this device is 512 bytes.
    
    Without this kernel prints suspicious line:
    
        pci 0000:01:00.0: Upstream bridge's Max Payload Size set to 256 (was 16384, max 512)
    
    With this change it changes to:

    powerpc/85xx: fix timebase sync issue when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n
    
    commit c45361abb9185b1e172bd75eff51ad5f601ccae4 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_SMP=y, timebase synchronization is required when the second
    kernel is started.
    
    arch/powerpc/kernel/smp.c:
      int __cpu_up(unsigned int cpu, struct task_struct *tidle)
      {
            ...
            if (smp_ops->give_timebase)
                    smp_ops->give_timebase();
            ...
      }
    
      void start_secondary(void *unused)
      {
            ...
            if (smp_ops->take_timebase)
                    smp_ops->take_timebase();
            ...
      }
    
    When CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n and CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE=n,
     smp_85xx_ops.give_timebase is NULL,
     smp_85xx_ops.take_timebase is NULL,
    As a result, the timebase is not synchronized.
    
    Timebase  synchronization does not depend on CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.

    powerpc/pseries/mobility: ignore ibm, platform-facilities updates
    
    commit 319fa1a52e438a6e028329187783a25ad498c4e6 upstream.
    
    On VMs with NX encryption, compression, and/or RNG offload, these
    capabilities are described by nodes in the ibm,platform-facilities device
    tree hierarchy:
    
      $ tree -d /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,platform-facilities/
      /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,platform-facilities/
      ├── ibm,compression-v1
      ├── ibm,random-v1
      └── ibm,sym-encryption-v1
    
      3 directories
    
    The acceleration functions that these nodes describe are not disrupted by
    live migration, not even temporarily.
    
    But the post-migration ibm,update-nodes sequence firmware always sends
    "delete" messages for this hierarchy, followed by an "add" directive to
    reconstruct it via ibm,configure-connector (log with debugging statements
    enabled in mobility.c):
    
      mobility: removing node /ibm,platform-facilities/ibm,random-v1:4294967285
      mobility: removing node /ibm,platform-facilities/ibm,compression-v1:4294967284
      mobility: removing node /ibm,platform-facilities/ibm,sym-encryption-v1:4294967283
      mobility: removing node /ibm,platform-facilities:4294967286
      ...
      mobility: added node /ibm,platform-facilities:4294967286
    
    Note we receive a single "add" message for the entire hierarchy, and what
    we receive from the ibm,configure-connector sequence is the top-level
    platform-facilities node along with its three children. The debug message
    simply reports the parent node and not the whole subtree.
    
    Also, significantly, the nodes added are almost completely equivalent to
    the ones removed; even phandles are unchanged. ibm,shared-interrupt-pool in
    the leaf nodes is the only property I've observed to differ, and Linux does
    not use that. So in practice, the sum of update messages Linux receives for
    this hierarchy is equivalent to minor property updates.
    
    We succeed in removing the original hierarchy from the device tree. But the
    vio bus code is ignorant of this, and does not unbind or relinquish its
    references. The leaf nodes, still reachable through sysfs, of course still
    refer to the now-freed ibm,platform-facilities parent node, which makes
    use-after-free possible:
    
      refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
      WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 1706 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0x164/0x1f0

      new_sync_read+0x120/0x190
      vfs_read+0x1d0/0x240
    
    Moreover, the "new" replacement subtree is not correctly added to the
    device tree, resulting in ibm,platform-facilities parent node without the
    appropriate leaf nodes, and broken symlinks in the sysfs device hierarchy:
    
      $ tree -d /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,platform-facilities/
      /sys/firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,platform-facilities/
    
      0 directories
    
      $ cd /sys/devices/vio ; find . -xtype l -exec file {} +
      ./ibm,sym-encryption-v1/of_node: broken symbolic link to
        ../../../firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,platform-facilities/ibm,sym-encryption-v1
      ./ibm,random-v1/of_node:         broken symbolic link to
        ../../../firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,platform-facilities/ibm,random-v1
      ./ibm,compression-v1/of_node:    broken symbolic link to
        ../../../firmware/devicetree/base/ibm,platform-facilities/ibm,compression-v1
    
    This is because add_dt_node() -> dlpar_attach_node() attaches only the
    parent node returned from configure-connector, ignoring any children. This
    should be corrected for the general case, but fixing that won't help with
    the stale OF node references, which is the more urgent problem.
    
    One way to address that would be to make the drivers respond to node
    removal notifications, so that node references can be dropped
    appropriately. But this would likely force the drivers to disrupt active
    clients for no useful purpose: equivalent nodes are immediately re-added.
    And recall that the acceleration capabilities described by the nodes remain
    available throughout the whole process.
    
    The solution I believe to be robust for this situation is to convert
    remove+add of a node with an unchanged phandle to an update of the node's
    properties in the Linux device tree structure. That would involve changing
    and adding a fair amount of code, and may take several iterations to land.
    
    Until that can be realized we have a confirmed use-after-free and the
    possibility of memory corruption. So add a limited workaround that
    discriminates on the node type, ignoring adds and removes. This should be
    amenable to backporting in the meantime.

    powerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix check_return_regs_valid() false positive
    
    commit 4a5cb51f3db4be547225a4bce7a43d41b231382b upstream.
    
    The check_return_regs_valid() can cause a false positive if the return
    regs are marked as norestart and they are an HSRR type interrupt,
    because the low bit in the bottom of regs->trap causes interrupt type
    matching to fail.
    
    This can occcur for example on bare metal with a HV privileged doorbell
    interrupt that causes a signal, but do_signal returns early because
    get_signal() fails, and takes the "No signal to deliver" path. In this
    case no signal was delivered so the return location is not changed so
    return SRRs are not invalidated, yet set_trap_norestart is called, which
    messes up the match. Building go-1.16.6 is known to reproduce this.
    
    Fix it by using the TRAP() accessor which masks out the low bit.

    powerpc/security: Use a mutex for interrupt exit code patching
    
    commit 3c12b4df8d5e026345a19886ae375b3ebc33c0b6 upstream.
    
    The mitigation-patching.sh script in the powerpc selftests toggles
    all mitigations on and off simultaneously, revealing that rfi_flush
    and stf_barrier cannot safely operate at the same time due to races
    in updating the static key.
    
    On some systems, the static key code throws a warning and the kernel
    remains functional.  On others, the kernel will hang or crash.
    
    Fix this by slapping on a mutex.

    powerpc/32e: Ignore ESR in instruction storage interrupt handler
    
    commit 81291383ffde08b23bce75e7d6b2575ce9d3475c upstream.
    
    A e5500 machine running a 32-bit kernel sometimes hangs at boot,
    seemingly going into an infinite loop of instruction storage interrupts.
    
    The ESR (Exception Syndrome Register) has a value of 0x800000 (store)
    when this happens, which is likely set by a previous store. An
    instruction TLB miss interrupt would then leave ESR unchanged, and if no
    PTE exists it calls directly to the instruction storage interrupt
    handler without changing ESR.
    
    access_error() does not cause a segfault due to a store to a read-only
    vma because is_exec is true. Most subsequent fault handling does not
    check for a write fault on a read-only vma, and might do strange things
    like create a writeable PTE or call page_mkwrite on a read only vma or
    file. It's not clear what happens here to cause the infinite faulting in
    this case, a fault handler failure or low level PTE or TLB handling.
    
    In any case this can be fixed by having the instruction storage
    interrupt zero regs->dsisr rather than storing the ESR value to it.

    powerpc/bpf: Fix write protecting JIT code
    
    commit 44a8214de96bafb5210e43bfa2c97c19bf75af3d upstream.
    
    Running program with bpf-to-bpf function calls results in data access
    exception (0x300) with the below call trace:
    
      bpf_int_jit_compile+0x238/0x750 (unreliable)
      bpf_check+0x2008/0x2710
      bpf_prog_load+0xb00/0x13a0

      system_call_exception+0x164/0x330
      system_call_vectored_common+0xe8/0x278
    
    as bpf_int_jit_compile() tries writing to write protected JIT code
    location during the extra pass.
    
    Fix it by holding off write protection of JIT code until the extra
    pass, where branch target addresses fixup happens.

    commit 61cb9ac66b30374c7fd8a8b2a3c4f8f432c72e36 upstream.
    
    (!ptr && !ptr->foo) strikes again. :)
    
    The expression (!ptr && !ptr->foo) is bogus and in case ptr is NULL,
    it leads to a NULL pointer dereference: ptr->foo.
    
    Fix this by converting && to ||
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle, and audited and
    fixed manually.

    mtd: rawnand: au1550nd: Keep the driver compatible with on-die ECC engines
    
    commit 7e3cdba176ba59eaf4d463d273da0718e3626140 upstream.
    
    Following the introduction of the generic ECC engine infrastructure, it
    was necessary to reorganize the code and move the ECC configuration in
    the ->attach_chip() hook. Failing to do that properly lead to a first
    series of fixes supposed to stabilize the situation. Unfortunately, this
    only fixed the use of software ECC engines, preventing any other kind of
    engine to be used, including on-die ones.
    
    It is now time to (finally) fix the situation by ensuring that we still
    provide a default (eg. software ECC) but will still support different
    ECC engines such as on-die ECC engines if properly described in the
    device tree.
    
    There are no changes needed on the core side in order to do this, but we
    just need to leverage the logic there which allows:
    1- a subsystem default (set to Host engines in the raw NAND world)
    2- a driver specific default (here set to software ECC engines)
    3- any type of engine requested by the user (ie. described in the DT)
    
    As the raw NAND subsystem has not yet been fully converted to the ECC
    engine infrastructure, in order to provide a default ECC engine for this
    driver we need to set chip->ecc.engine_type *before* calling
    nand_scan(). During the initialization step, the core will consider this
    entry as the default engine for this driver. This value may of course
    be overloaded by the user if the usual DT properties are provided.

    engine internals. Problem: the fsmc driver does not instantiate (yet) a
    real ECC engine object so we had to use a 'bare' ECC helper instead of
    the shiny rawnand functions. However, when not intializing this engine
    properly and using the bare helpers, we do not get the SM ORDER feature
    handled automatically. It looks like this was lost in the process so
    let's ensure we use the right SM ORDER now.

    s390/cio: make ccw_device_dma_* more robust
    
    commit ad9a14517263a16af040598c7920c09ca9670a31 upstream.
    
    Since commit 48720ba56891 ("virtio/s390: use DMA memory for ccw I/O and
    classic notifiers") we were supposed to make sure that
    virtio_ccw_release_dev() completes before the ccw device and the
    attached dma pool are torn down, but unfortunately we did not.  Before
    that commit it used to be OK to delay cleaning up the memory allocated
    by virtio-ccw indefinitely (which isn't really intuitive for guys used
    to destruction happens in reverse construction order), but now we
    trigger a BUG_ON if the genpool is destroyed before all memory allocated
    from it is deallocated. Which brings down the guest. We can observe this
    problem, when unregister_virtio_device() does not give up the last
    reference to the virtio_device (e.g. because a virtio-scsi attached scsi
    disk got removed without previously unmounting its previously mounted
    partition).
    
    To make sure that the genpool is only destroyed after all the necessary
    freeing is done let us take a reference on the ccw device on each
    ccw_device_dma_zalloc() and give it up on each ccw_device_dma_free().
    
    Actually there are multiple approaches to fixing the problem at hand
    that can work. The upside of this one is that it is the safest one while
    remaining simple. We don't crash the guest even if the driver does not
    pair allocations and frees. The downside is the reference counting
    overhead, that the reference counting for ccw devices becomes more
    complex, in a sense that we need to pair the calls to the aforementioned
    functions for it to be correct, and that if we happen to leak, we leak
    more than necessary (the whole ccw device instead of just the genpool).
    
    Some alternatives to this approach are taking a reference in
    virtio_ccw_online() and giving it up in virtio_ccw_release_dev() or
    making sure virtio_ccw_release_dev() completes its work before
    virtio_ccw_remove() returns. The downside of these approaches is that
    these are less safe against programming errors.

    s390/ap: Fix hanging ioctl caused by orphaned replies
    
    commit 3826350e6dd435e244eb6e47abad5a47c169ebc2 upstream.
    
    When a queue is switched to soft offline during heavy load and later
    switched to soft online again and now used, it may be that the caller
    is blocked forever in the ioctl call.
    
    The failure occurs because there is a pending reply after the queue(s)
    have been switched to offline. This orphaned reply is received when
    the queue is switched to online and is accidentally counted for the
    outstanding replies. So when there was a valid outstanding reply and
    this orphaned reply is received it counts as the outstanding one thus
    dropping the outstanding counter to 0. Voila, with this counter the
    receive function is not called any more and the real outstanding reply
    is never received (until another request comes in...) and the ioctl
    blocks.
    
    The fix is simple. However, instead of readjusting the counter when an
    orphaned reply is detected, I check the queue status for not empty and
    compare this to the outstanding counter. So if the queue is not empty
    then the counter must not drop to 0 but at least have a value of 1.

    s390/cpumf: cpum_cf PMU displays invalid value after hotplug remove
    
    commit 9d48c7afedf91a02d03295837ec76b2fb5e7d3fe upstream.
    
    When a CPU is hotplugged while the perf stat -e cycles command is
    running, a wrong (very large) value is displayed immediately after the
    CPU removal:
    
      Check the values, shouldn't be too high as in
                time             counts unit events
         1.001101919           29261846      cycles
         2.002454499           17523405      cycles
         3.003659292           24361161      cycles
         4.004816983 18446744073638406144      cycles
         5.005671647      <not counted>      cycles
         ...
    
    The CPU hotplug off took place after 3 seconds.
    The issue is the read of the event count value after 4 seconds when
    the CPU is not available and the read of the counter returns an
    error. This is treated as a counter value of zero. This results
    in a very large value (0 - previous_value).
    
    Fix this by detecting the hotplugged off CPU and report 0 instead
    of a very large number.

    PM: sleep: Avoid calling put_device() under dpm_list_mtx
    
    commit 2aa36604e8243698ff22bd5fef0dd0c6bb07ba92 upstream.
    
    It is generally unsafe to call put_device() with dpm_list_mtx held,
    because the given device's release routine may carry out an action
    depending on that lock which then may deadlock, so modify the
    system-wide suspend and resume of devices to always drop dpm_list_mtx
    before calling put_device() (and adjust white space somewhat while
    at it).
    
    For instance, this prevents the following splat from showing up in
    the kernel log after a system resume in certain configurations:

    video: backlight: Drop maximum brightness override for brightness zero
    
    commit 33a5471f8da976bf271a1ebbd6b9d163cb0cb6aa upstream.
    
    The note in c2adda27d202f ("video: backlight: Add of_find_backlight helper
    in backlight.c") says that gpio-backlight uses brightness as power state.
    This has been fixed since in ec665b756e6f7 ("backlight: gpio-backlight:
    Correct initial power state handling") and other backlight drivers do not
    require this workaround. Drop the workaround.
    
    This fixes the case where e.g. pwm-backlight can perfectly well be set to
    brightness 0 on boot in DT, which without this patch leads to the display
    brightness to be max instead of off.

    mfd: dln2: Add cell for initializing DLN2 ADC
    
    commit 313c84b5ae4104e48c661d5d706f9f4c425fd50f upstream.
    
    This patch extends the DLN2 driver; adding cell for adc_dln2 module.
    
    The original patch[1] fell through the cracks when the driver was added
    so ADC has never actually been usable. That patch did not have ACPI
    support which was added in v5.9, so the oldest supported version this
    current patch can be backported to is 5.10.

    mm, oom: do not trigger out_of_memory from the #PF
    
    commit 60e2793d440a3ec95abb5d6d4fc034a4b480472d upstream.
    
    Any allocation failure during the #PF path will return with VM_FAULT_OOM
    which in turn results in pagefault_out_of_memory.  This can happen for 2
    different reasons.  a) Memcg is out of memory and we rely on
    mem_cgroup_oom_synchronize to perform the memcg OOM handling or b)
    normal allocation fails.
    
    The latter is quite problematic because allocation paths already trigger
    out_of_memory and the page allocator tries really hard to not fail
    allocations.  Anyway, if the OOM killer has been already invoked there
    is no reason to invoke it again from the #PF path.  Especially when the
    OOM condition might be gone by that time and we have no way to find out
    other than allocate.
    
    Moreover if the allocation failed and the OOM killer hasn't been invoked
    then we are unlikely to do the right thing from the #PF context because
    we have already lost the allocation context and restictions and
    therefore might oom kill a task from a different NUMA domain.
    
    This all suggests that there is no legitimate reason to trigger
    out_of_memory from pagefault_out_of_memory so drop it.  Just to be sure
    that no #PF path returns with VM_FAULT_OOM without allocation print a
    warning that this is happening before we restart the #PF.
    
    [VvS: #PF allocation can hit into limit of cgroup v1 kmem controller.
    This is a local problem related to memcg, however, it causes unnecessary
    global OOM kills that are repeated over and over again and escalate into a
    real disaster.  This has been broken since kmem accounting has been
    introduced for cgroup v1 (3.8).  There was no kmem specific reclaim for
    the separate limit so the only way to handle kmem hard limit was to return
    with ENOMEM.  In upstream the problem will be fixed by removing the
    outdated kmem limit, however stable and LTS kernels cannot do it and are
    still affected.  This patch fixes the problem and should be backported
    into stable/LTS.]

    mm, oom: pagefault_out_of_memory: don't force global OOM for dying tasks
    
    commit 0b28179a6138a5edd9d82ad2687c05b3773c387b upstream.
    
    Patch series "memcg: prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks", v3.
    
    Memory cgroup charging allows killed or exiting tasks to exceed the hard
    limit.  It can be misused and allowed to trigger global OOM from inside
    a memcg-limited container.  On the other hand if memcg fails allocation,
    called from inside #PF handler it triggers global OOM from inside
    pagefault_out_of_memory().
    
    To prevent these problems this patchset:
     (a) removes execution of out_of_memory() from
         pagefault_out_of_memory(), becasue nobody can explain why it is
         necessary.
     (b) allow memcg to fail allocation of dying/killed tasks.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    Any allocation failure during the #PF path will return with VM_FAULT_OOM
    which in turn results in pagefault_out_of_memory which in turn executes
    out_out_memory() and can kill a random task.
    
    An allocation might fail when the current task is the oom victim and
    there are no memory reserves left.  The OOM killer is already handled at
    the page allocator level for the global OOM and at the charging level
    for the memcg one.  Both have much more information about the scope of
    allocation/charge request.  This means that either the OOM killer has
    been invoked properly and didn't lead to the allocation success or it
    has been skipped because it couldn't have been invoked.  In both cases
    triggering it from here is pointless and even harmful.
    
    It makes much more sense to let the killed task die rather than to wake
    up an eternally hungry oom-killer and send him to choose a fatter victim
    for breakfast.

    io-wq: serialize hash clear with wakeup
    
    commit d3e3c102d107bb84251455a298cf475f24bab995 upstream.
    
    We need to ensure that we serialize the stalled and hash bits with the
    wait_queue wait handler, or we could be racing with someone modifying
    the hashed state after we find it busy, but before we then give up and
    wait for it to be cleared. This can cause random delays or stalls when
    handling buffered writes for many files, where some of these files cause
    hash collisions between the worker threads.

    memcg: prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks
    
    commit a4ebf1b6ca1e011289677239a2a361fde4a88076 upstream.
    
    Memory cgroup charging allows killed or exiting tasks to exceed the hard
    limit.  It is assumed that the amount of the memory charged by those
    tasks is bound and most of the memory will get released while the task
    is exiting.  This is resembling a heuristic for the global OOM situation
    when tasks get access to memory reserves.  There is no global memory
    shortage at the memcg level so the memcg heuristic is more relieved.
    
    The above assumption is overly optimistic though.  E.g.  vmalloc can
    scale to really large requests and the heuristic would allow that.  We
    used to have an early break in the vmalloc allocator for killed tasks
    but this has been reverted by commit b8c8a338f75e ("Revert "vmalloc:
    back off when the current task is killed"").  There are likely other
    similar code paths which do not check for fatal signals in an
    allocation&charge loop.  Also there are some kernel objects charged to a
    memcg which are not bound to a process life time.
    
    It has been observed that it is not really hard to trigger these
    bypasses and cause global OOM situation.
    
    One potential way to address these runaways would be to limit the amount
    of excess (similar to the global OOM with limited oom reserves).  This
    is certainly possible but it is not really clear how much of an excess
    is desirable and still protects from global OOMs as that would have to
    consider the overall memcg configuration.
    
    This patch is addressing the problem by removing the heuristic
    altogether.  Bypass is only allowed for requests which either cannot
    fail or where the failure is not desirable while excess should be still
    limited (e.g.  atomic requests).  Implementation wise a killed or dying
    task fails to charge if it has passed the OOM killer stage.  That should
    give all forms of reclaim chance to restore the limit before the failure
    (ENOMEM) and tell the caller to back off.
    
    In addition, this patch renames should_force_charge() helper to
    task_is_dying() because now its use is not associated witch forced
    charging.
    
    This patch depends on pagefault_out_of_memory() to not trigger
    out_of_memory(), because then a memcg failure can unwind to VM_FAULT_OOM
    and cause a global OOM killer.

    mm/filemap.c: remove bogus VM_BUG_ON
    
    commit d417b49fff3e2f21043c834841e8623a6098741d upstream.
    
    It is not safe to check page->index without holding the page lock.  It
    can be changed if the page is moved between the swap cache and the page
    cache for a shmem file, for example.  There is a VM_BUG_ON below which
    checks page->index is correct after taking the page lock.

    bpf, cgroup: Assign cgroup in cgroup_sk_alloc when called from interrupt
    
    [ Upstream commit 78cc316e9583067884eb8bd154301dc1e9ee945c ]
    
    If cgroup_sk_alloc() is called from interrupt context, then just assign the
    root cgroup to skcd->cgroup. Prior to commit 8520e224f547 ("bpf, cgroups:
    Fix cgroup v2 fallback on v1/v2 mixed mode") we would just return, and later
    on in sock_cgroup_ptr(), we were NULL-testing the cgroup in fast-path, and
    iff indeed NULL returning the root cgroup (v ?: &cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp). Rather
    than re-adding the NULL-test to the fast-path we can just assign it once from
    cgroup_sk_alloc() given v1/v2 handling has been simplified. The migration from
    NULL test with returning &cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp to assigning &cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp
    directly does /not/ change behavior for callers of sock_cgroup_ptr().
    
    syzkaller was able to trigger a splat in the legacy netrom code base, where
    the RX handler in nr_rx_frame() calls nr_make_new() which calls sk_alloc()
    and therefore cgroup_sk_alloc() with in_interrupt() condition. Thus the NULL
    skcd->cgroup, where it trips over on cgroup_sk_free() side given it expects
    a non-NULL object. There are a few other candidates aside from netrom which
    have similar pattern where in their accept-like implementation, they just call
    to sk_alloc() and thus cgroup_sk_alloc() instead of sk_clone_lock() with the
    corresponding cgroup_sk_clone() which then inherits the cgroup from the parent
    socket. None of them are related to core protocols where BPF cgroup programs
    are running from. However, in future, they should follow to implement a similar
    inheritance mechanism.
    
    Additionally, with a !CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_PRIO and !CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_CLASSID
    configuration, the same issue was exposed also prior to 8520e224f547 due to
    commit e876ecc67db8 ("cgroup: memcg: net: do not associate sock with unrelated
    cgroup") which added the early in_interrupt() return back then.

    bpf, cgroups: Fix cgroup v2 fallback on v1/v2 mixed mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 8520e224f547cd070c7c8f97b1fc6d58cff7ccaa ]
    
    Fix cgroup v1 interference when non-root cgroup v2 BPF programs are used.
    Back in the days, commit bd1060a1d671 ("sock, cgroup: add sock->sk_cgroup")
    embedded per-socket cgroup information into sock->sk_cgrp_data and in order
    to save 8 bytes in struct sock made both mutually exclusive, that is, when
    cgroup v1 socket tagging (e.g. net_cls/net_prio) is used, then cgroup v2
    falls back to the root cgroup in sock_cgroup_ptr() (&cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp).
    
    The assumption made was "there is no reason to mix the two and this is in line
    with how legacy and v2 compatibility is handled" as stated in bd1060a1d671.
    However, with Kubernetes more widely supporting cgroups v2 as well nowadays,
    this assumption no longer holds, and the possibility of the v1/v2 mixed mode
    with the v2 root fallback being hit becomes a real security issue.
    
    Many of the cgroup v2 BPF programs are also used for policy enforcement, just
    to pick _one_ example, that is, to programmatically deny socket related system
    calls like connect(2) or bind(2). A v2 root fallback would implicitly cause
    a policy bypass for the affected Pods.
    
    In production environments, we have recently seen this case due to various
    circumstances: i) a different 3rd party agent and/or ii) a container runtime
    such as [0] in the user's environment configuring legacy cgroup v1 net_cls
    tags, which triggered implicitly mentioned root fallback. Another case is
    Kubernetes projects like kind [1] which create Kubernetes nodes in a container
    and also add cgroup namespaces to the mix, meaning programs which are attached
    to the cgroup v2 root of the cgroup namespace get attached to a non-root
    cgroup v2 path from init namespace point of view. And the latter's root is
    out of reach for agents on a kind Kubernetes node to configure. Meaning, any
    entity on the node setting cgroup v1 net_cls tag will trigger the bypass
    despite cgroup v2 BPF programs attached to the namespace root.
    
    Generally, this mutual exclusiveness does not hold anymore in today's user
    environments and makes cgroup v2 usage from BPF side fragile and unreliable.
    This fix adds proper struct cgroup pointer for the cgroup v2 case to struct
    sock_cgroup_data in order to address these issues; this implicitly also fixes
    the tradeoffs being made back then with regards to races and refcount leaks
    as stated in bd1060a1d671, and removes the fallback, so that cgroup v2 BPF
    programs always operate as expected.

    net, neigh: Enable state migration between NUD_PERMANENT and NTF_USE
    
    [ Upstream commit 3dc20f4762c62d3b3f0940644881ed818aa7b2f5 ]
    
    Currently, it is not possible to migrate a neighbor entry between NUD_PERMANENT
    state and NTF_USE flag with a dynamic NUD state from a user space control plane.
    Similarly, it is not possible to add/remove NTF_EXT_LEARNED flag from an existing
    neighbor entry in combination with NTF_USE flag.
    
    This is due to the latter directly calling into neigh_event_send() without any
    meta data updates as happening in __neigh_update(). Thus, to enable this use
    case, extend the latter with a NEIGH_UPDATE_F_USE flag where we break the
    NUD_PERMANENT state in particular so that a latter neigh_event_send() is able
    to re-resolve a neighbor entry.
    
    Before fix, NUD_PERMANENT -> NUD_* & NTF_USE:
    
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a PERMANENT
      [...]
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 use extern_learn
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a PERMANENT
      [...]
    
    As can be seen, despite the admin-triggered replace, the entry remains in the
    NUD_PERMANENT state.
    
    After fix, NUD_PERMANENT -> NUD_* & NTF_USE:
    
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a PERMANENT
      [...]
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 use extern_learn
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a extern_learn REACHABLE
      [...]
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a extern_learn STALE
      [...]
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a PERMANENT
      [...]
    
    After the fix, the admin-triggered replace switches to a dynamic state from
    the NTF_USE flag which triggered a new neighbor resolution. Likewise, we can
    transition back from there, if needed, into NUD_PERMANENT.
    
    Similar before/after behavior can be observed for below transitions:
    
    Before fix, NTF_USE -> NTF_USE | NTF_EXT_LEARNED -> NTF_USE:
    
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 use
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a REACHABLE
      [...]
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 use extern_learn
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a REACHABLE
      [...]
    
    After fix, NTF_USE -> NTF_USE | NTF_EXT_LEARNED -> NTF_USE:
    
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 use
      # ./ip/ip n
      192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 lladdr f4:8c:50:5e:71:9a REACHABLE

    erofs: fix unsafe pagevec reuse of hooked pclusters
    
    commit 86432a6dca9bed79111990851df5756d3eb5f57c upstream.
    
    There are pclusters in runtime marked with Z_EROFS_PCLUSTER_TAIL
    before actual I/O submission. Thus, the decompression chain can be
    extended if the following pcluster chain hooks such tail pcluster.
    
    As the related comment mentioned, if some page is made of a hooked
    pcluster and another followed pcluster, it can be reused for in-place
    I/O (since I/O should be submitted anyway):
     _______________________________________________________________
    |  tail (partial) page |          head (partial) page           |
    |_____PRIMARY_HOOKED___|____________PRIMARY_FOLLOWED____________|
    
    However, it's by no means safe to reuse as pagevec since if such
    PRIMARY_HOOKED pclusters finally move into bypass chain without I/O
    submission. It's somewhat hard to reproduce with LZ4 and I just found
    it (general protection fault) by ro_fsstressing a LZMA image for long
    time.
    
    I'm going to actively clean up related code together with multi-page
    folio adaption in the next few months. Let's address it directly for
    easier backporting for now.

    sbi->nm_info. However, if issue_discard_thread accesses sbi->nm_info
    after the deallocation, but before the f2fs_stop_discard_thread, it will
    cause UAF(Use-after-free).
    
    -> f2fs_destroy_segment_manager
       -> destroy_discard_cmd_control
          -> f2fs_stop_discard_thread
    
    Fix this by stopping discard thread before f2fs_destroy_node_manager.
    
    Note that, the commit d6d2b491a82e1 introduces the call of
    f2fs_available_free_memory into issue_discard_thread.

    irqchip/sifive-plic: Fixup EOI failed when masked
    
    commit 69ea463021be0d159ab30f96195fb0dd18ee2272 upstream.
    
    When using "devm_request_threaded_irq(,,,,IRQF_ONESHOT,,)" in a driver,
    only the first interrupt is handled, and following interrupts are never
    delivered (initially reported in [1]).
    
    That's because the RISC-V PLIC cannot EOI masked interrupts, as explained
    in the description of Interrupt Completion in the PLIC spec [2]:
    
    <quote>
    The PLIC signals it has completed executing an interrupt handler by
    writing the interrupt ID it received from the claim to the claim/complete
    register. The PLIC does not check whether the completion ID is the same
    as the last claim ID for that target. If the completion ID does not match
    an interrupt source that *is currently enabled* for the target, the
    completion is silently ignored.
    </quote>
    
    Re-enable the interrupt before completion if it has been masked during
    the handling, and remask it afterwards.

    posix-cpu-timers: Clear task::posix_cputimers_work in copy_process()
    
    commit ca7752caeaa70bd31d1714af566c9809688544af upstream.
    
    copy_process currently copies task_struct.posix_cputimers_work as-is. If a
    timer interrupt arrives while handling clone and before dup_task_struct
    completes then the child task will have:
    
    1. posix_cputimers_work.scheduled = true
    2. posix_cputimers_work.work queued.
    
    copy_process clears task_struct.task_works, so (2) will have no effect and
    posix_cpu_timers_work will never run (not to mention it doesn't make sense
    for two tasks to share a common linked list).
    
    Since posix_cpu_timers_work never runs, posix_cputimers_work.scheduled is
    never cleared. Since scheduled is set, future timer interrupts will skip
    scheduling work, with the ultimate result that the task will never receive
    timer expirations.
    
    Together, the complete flow is:
    
    1. Task 1 calls clone(), enters kernel.
    2. Timer interrupt fires, schedules task work on Task 1.
       2a. task_struct.posix_cputimers_work.scheduled = true
       2b. task_struct.posix_cputimers_work.work added to
           task_struct.task_works.
    3. dup_task_struct() copies Task 1 to Task 2.
    4. copy_process() clears task_struct.task_works for Task 2.
    5. Future timer interrupts on Task 2 see
       task_struct.posix_cputimers_work.scheduled = true and skip scheduling
       work.
    
    Fix this by explicitly clearing contents of task_struct.posix_cputimers_work
    in copy_process(). This was never meant to be shared or inherited across
    tasks in the first place.

    MIPS: Fix assembly error from MIPSr2 code used within MIPS_ISA_ARCH_LEVEL
    
    commit a923a2676e60683aee46aa4b93c30aff240ac20d upstream.
    
    Fix assembly errors like:
    
    {standard input}: Assembler messages:
    {standard input}:287: Error: opcode not supported on this processor: mips3 (mips3) `dins $10,$7,32,32'

    make[1]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:277: mm/highmem.o] Error 1
    
    with code produced from `__cmpxchg64' for MIPS64r2 CPU configurations
    using CONFIG_32BIT and CONFIG_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT.
    
    This is due to MIPS_ISA_ARCH_LEVEL downgrading the assembly architecture
    to `r4000' i.e. MIPS III for MIPS64r2 configurations, while there is a
    block of code containing a DINS MIPS64r2 instruction conditionalized on
    MIPS_ISA_REV >= 2 within the scope of the downgrade.
    
    The assembly architecture override code pattern has been put there for
    LL/SC instructions, so that code compiles for configurations that select
    a processor to build for that does not support these instructions while
    still providing run-time support for processors that do, dynamically
    switched by non-constant `cpu_has_llsc'.  It went in with linux-mips.org
    commit aac8aa7717a2 ("Enable a suitable ISA for the assembler around
    ll/sc so that code builds even for processors that don't support the
    instructions. Plus minor formatting fixes.") back in 2005.
    
    Fix the problem by wrapping these instructions along with the adjacent
    SYNC instructions only, following the practice established with commit
    cfd54de3b0e4 ("MIPS: Avoid move psuedo-instruction whilst using
    MIPS_ISA_LEVEL") and commit 378ed6f0e3c5 ("MIPS: Avoid using .set mips0
    to restore ISA").  Strictly speaking the SYNC instructions do not have
    to be wrapped as they are only used as a Loongson3 erratum workaround,
    so they will be enabled in the assembler by default, but do this so as
    to keep code consistent with other places.

    parisc: Flush kernel data mapping in set_pte_at() when installing pte for user page
    
    commit 38860b2c8bb1b92f61396eb06a63adff916fc31d upstream.
    
    For years, there have been random segmentation faults in userspace on
    SMP PA-RISC machines.  It occurred to me that this might be a problem in
    set_pte_at().  MIPS and some other architectures do cache flushes when
    installing PTEs with the present bit set.
    
    Here I have adapted the code in update_mmu_cache() to flush the kernel
    mapping when the kernel flush is deferred, or when the kernel mapping
    may alias with the user mapping.  This simplifies calls to
    update_mmu_cache().
    
    I also changed the barrier in set_pte() from a compiler barrier to a
    full memory barrier.  I know this change is not sufficient to fix the
    problem.  It might not be needed.
    
    I have had a few days of operation with 5.14.16 to 5.15.1 and haven't
    seen any random segmentation faults on rp3440 or c8000 so far.

    parisc: Fix backtrace to always include init funtion names
    
    commit 279917e27edc293eb645a25428c6ab3f3bca3f86 upstream.
    
    I noticed that sometimes at kernel startup the backtraces did not
    included the function names of init functions. Their address were not
    resolved to function names and instead only the address was printed.
    
    Debugging shows that the culprit is is_ksym_addr() which is called
    by the backtrace functions to check if an address belongs to a function in
    the kernel. The problem occurs only for CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=y.
    
    When looking at is_ksym_addr() one can see that for CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=y
    the function only tries to resolve the address via is_kernel() function,
    which checks like this:
            if (addr >= _stext && addr <= _end)
                    return 1;
    On parisc the init functions are located before _stext, so this check fails.
    Other platforms seem to have all functions (including init functions)
    behind _stext.
    
    The following patch moves the _stext symbol at the beginning of the
    kernel and thus includes the init section. This fixes the check and does
    not seem to have any negative side effects on where the kernel mapping
    happens in the map_pages() function in arch/parisc/mm/init.c.

    ARM: 9156/1: drop cc-option fallbacks for architecture selection
    
    commit 418ace9992a7647c446ed3186df40cf165b67298 upstream.
    
    Naresh and Antonio ran into a build failure with latest Debian
    armhf compilers, with lots of output like
    
     tmp/ccY3nOAs.s:2215: Error: selected processor does not support `cpsid i' in ARM mode
    
    As it turns out, $(cc-option) fails early here when the FPU is not
    selected before CPU architecture is selected, as the compiler
    option check runs before enabling -msoft-float, which causes
    a problem when testing a target architecture level without an FPU:
    
    cc1: error: '-mfloat-abi=hard': selected architecture lacks an FPU
    
    Passing e.g. -march=armv6k+fp in place of -march=armv6k would avoid this
    issue, but the fallback logic is already broken because all supported
    compilers (gcc-5 and higher) are much more recent than these options,
    and building with -march=armv5t as a fallback no longer works.
    
    The best way forward that I see is to just remove all the checks, which
    also has the nice side-effect of slightly improving the startup time for
    'make'.
    
    The -mtune=marvell-f option was apparently never supported by any mainline
    compiler, and the custom Codesourcery gcc build that did support is
    now too old to build kernels, so just use -mtune=xscale unconditionally
    for those.
    
    This should be safe to apply on all stable kernels, and will be required
    in order to keep building them with gcc-11 and higher.

    ARM: 9155/1: fix early early_iounmap()
    
    commit 0d08e7bf0d0d1a29aff7b16ef516f7415eb1aa05 upstream.
    
    Currently __set_fixmap() bails out with a warning when called in early boot
    from early_iounmap(). Fix it, and while at it, make the comment a bit easier
    to understand.

    smb3: do not error on fsync when readonly
    
    commit 71e6864eacbef0b2645ca043cdfbac272cb6cea3 upstream.
    
    Linux allows doing a flush/fsync on a file open for read-only,
    but the protocol does not allow that.  If the file passed in
    on the flush is read-only try to find a writeable handle for
    the same inode, if that is not possible skip sending the
    fsync call to the server to avoid breaking the apps.

    The below commit added optional support for passing a bind address.
    It configures the sockaddr bind arguments before parsing options and
    reconfigures on options -b and -4.
    
    This broke support for passing port (-p) on its own.

    net/smc: fix sk_refcnt underflow on linkdown and fallback
    
    [ Upstream commit e5d5aadcf3cd59949316df49c27cb21788d7efe4 ]
    
    We got the following WARNING when running ab/nginx
    test with RDMA link flapping (up-down-up).
    The reason is when smc_sock fallback and at linkdown
    happens simultaneously, we may got the following situation:
    
    __smc_lgr_terminate()
     --> smc_conn_kill()
        --> smc_close_active_abort()
               smc_sock->sk_state = SMC_CLOSED
               sock_put(smc_sock)
    
    smc_sock was set to SMC_CLOSED and sock_put() been called
    when terminate the link group. But later application call
    close() on the socket, then we got:
    
    __smc_release():
        if (smc_sock->fallback)
            smc_sock->sk_state = SMC_CLOSED
            sock_put(smc_sock)
    
    Again we set the smc_sock to CLOSED through it's already
    in CLOSED state, and double put the refcnt, so the following
    warning happens:
    
    refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

    vsock: prevent unnecessary refcnt inc for nonblocking connect
    
    [ Upstream commit c7cd82b90599fa10915f41e3dd9098a77d0aa7b6 ]
    
    Currently vosck_connect() increments sock refcount for nonblocking
    socket each time it's called, which can lead to memory leak if
    it's called multiple times because connect timeout function decrements
    sock refcount only once.
    
    Fixes it by making vsock_connect() return -EALREADY immediately when
    sock state is already SS_CONNECTING.

    net: marvell: mvpp2: Fix wrong SerDes reconfiguration order
    
    [ Upstream commit bb7bbb6e36474933540c24ae1f1ad651b843981f ]
    
    Commit bfe301ebbc94 ("net: mvpp2: convert to use
    mac_prepare()/mac_finish()") introduced a bug wherein it leaves the MAC
    RESET register asserted after mac_finish(), due to wrong order of
    function calls.
    
    Before it was:
      .mac_config()
        mvpp22_mode_reconfigure()
          assert reset
        mvpp2_xlg_config()
          deassert reset
    
    Now it is:
      .mac_prepare()
      .mac_config()
        mvpp2_xlg_config()
          deassert reset
      .mac_finish()
        mvpp2_xlg_config()
          assert reset
    
    Obviously this is wrong.
    
    This bug is triggered when phylink tries to change the PHY interface
    mode from a GMAC mode (sgmii, 1000base-x, 2500base-x) to XLG mode
    (10gbase-r, xaui). The XLG mode does not work since reset is left
    asserted. Only after
      ifconfig down && ifconfig up
    is called will the XLG mode work.
    
    Move the call to mvpp22_mode_reconfigure() to .mac_prepare()
    implementation. Since some of the subsequent functions need to know
    whether the interface is being changed, we unfortunately also need to
    pass around the new interface mode before setting port->phy_interface.

    [ Upstream commit 0b653a81a26d66ffe526a54c2177e24fb1400301 ]
    
    Currently, driver will send command to firmware to query pfc packet number
    when user uses dcb tool to get pfc parameters. However, the periodic
    service task will also periodically query and record MAC statistics,
    including pfc packet number.
    
    As the hardware registers of statistics is cleared after reading, it will
    cause pfc packet number of MAC statistics are not correct after using dcb
    tool to get pfc parameters.
    
    To fix this problem, when user uses dcb tool to get pfc parameters, driver
    updates MAC statistics firstly and then get pfc packet number from MAC
    statistics.

    net: hns3: fix ROCE base interrupt vector initialization bug
    
    [ Upstream commit beb27ca451a57a1c0e52b5268703f3c3173c1f8c ]
    
    Currently, NIC init ROCE interrupt vector with MSIX interrupt. But ROCE use
    pci_irq_vector() to get interrupt vector, which adds the relative interrupt
    vector again and gets wrong interrupt vector.
    
    So fixes it by assign relative interrupt vector to ROCE instead of MSIX
    interrupt vector and delete the unused struct member base_msi_vector
    declaration of hclgevf_dev.

    DEFINE_PROC_SHOW_ATTRIBUTE() is supposed to be used to define a series
    of functions and variables to register proc file easily. And the users
    can use proc_create_data() to pass their own private data and get it
    via seq->private in the callback. Unfortunately, the proc file system
    use PDE_DATA() to get private data instead of inode->i_private. So fix
    it. Fortunately, there only one user of it which does not pass any
    private data, so this bug does not break any in-tree codes.

    dmaengine: stm32-dma: avoid 64-bit division in stm32_dma_get_max_width
    
    [ Upstream commit 2498363310e9b5e5de0e104709adc35c9f3ff7d9 ]
    
    Using the % operator on a 64-bit variable is expensive and can
    cause a link failure:
    
    arm-linux-gnueabi-ld: drivers/dma/stm32-dma.o: in function `stm32_dma_get_max_width':

    As we know that we just want to check the alignment in
    stm32_dma_get_max_width(), there is no need for a full division, and
    using a simple mask is a faster replacement.
    
    Same in stm32_dma_set_xfer_param(), change this to only allow burst
    transfers if the address is a multiple of the length.
    stm32_dma_get_best_burst just after will take buf_len into account to fix
    burst in case of misalignment.

    [ Upstream commit af229d2c2557b5cf2a3b1eb39847ec1de7446873 ]
    
    Theorically, address pointers used by STM32 DMA must be chosen so as to
    ensure that all transfers within a burst block are aligned on the address
    boundary equal to the size of the transfer.
    If this is always the case for peripheral addresses on STM32, it is not for
    memory addresses if the user doesn't respect this alignment constraint.
    To avoid a weird behavior of the DMA controller in this case (no error
    triggered but data are not transferred as expected), force no burst.

    bpf, sockmap: sk_skb data_end access incorrect when src_reg = dst_reg
    
    [ Upstream commit b2c4618162ec615a15883a804cce7e27afecfa58 ]
    
    The current conversion of skb->data_end reads like this:
    
      ; data_end = (void*)(long)skb->data_end;
       559: (79) r1 = *(u64 *)(r2 +200)   ; r1  = skb->data
       560: (61) r11 = *(u32 *)(r2 +112)  ; r11 = skb->len
       561: (0f) r1 += r11
       562: (61) r11 = *(u32 *)(r2 +116)
       563: (1f) r1 -= r11
    
    But similar to the case in 84f44df664e9 ("bpf: sock_ops sk access may stomp
    registers when dst_reg = src_reg"), the code will read an incorrect skb->len
    when src == dst. In this case we end up generating this xlated code:
    
      ; data_end = (void*)(long)skb->data_end;
       559: (79) r1 = *(u64 *)(r1 +200)   ; r1  = skb->data
       560: (61) r11 = *(u32 *)(r1 +112)  ; r11 = (skb->data)->len
       561: (0f) r1 += r11
       562: (61) r11 = *(u32 *)(r1 +116)
       563: (1f) r1 -= r11
    
    ... where line 560 is the reading 4B of (skb->data + 112) instead of the
    intended skb->len Here the skb pointer in r1 gets set to skb->data and the
    later deref for skb->len ends up following skb->data instead of skb.
    
    This fixes the issue similarly to the patch mentioned above by creating an
    additional temporary variable and using to store the register when dst_reg =
    src_reg. We name the variable bpf_temp_reg and place it in the cb context for
    sk_skb. Then we restore from the temp to ensure nothing is lost.

    bpf: sockmap, strparser, and tls are reusing qdisc_skb_cb and colliding
    
    [ Upstream commit e0dc3b93bd7bcff8c3813d1df43e0908499c7cf0 ]
    
    Strparser is reusing the qdisc_skb_cb struct to stash the skb message handling
    progress, e.g. offset and length of the skb. First this is poorly named and
    inherits a struct from qdisc that doesn't reflect the actual usage of cb[] at
    this layer.
    
    But, more importantly strparser is using the following to access its metadata.
    
      (struct _strp_msg *)((void *)skb->cb + offsetof(struct qdisc_skb_cb, data))
    
    Where _strp_msg is defined as:
    
      struct _strp_msg {
            struct strp_msg            strp;                 /*     0     8 */
            int                        accum_len;            /*     8     4 */
    
            /* size: 12, cachelines: 1, members: 2 */
            /* last cacheline: 12 bytes */
      };
    
    So we use 12 bytes of ->data[] in struct. However in BPF code running parser
    and verdict the user has read capabilities into the data[] array as well. Its
    not too problematic, but we should not be exposing internal state to BPF
    program. If its really needed then we can use the probe_read() APIs which allow
    reading kernel memory. And I don't believe cb[] layer poses any API breakage by
    moving this around because programs can't depend on cb[] across layers.
    
    In order to fix another issue with a ctx rewrite we need to stash a temp
    variable somewhere. To make this work cleanly this patch builds a cb struct
    for sk_skb types called sk_skb_cb struct. Then we can use this consistently
    in the strparser, sockmap space. Additionally we can start allowing ->cb[]
    write access after this.

    bpf, sockmap: Fix race in ingress receive verdict with redirect to self
    
    [ Upstream commit c5d2177a72a1659554922728fc407f59950aa929 ]
    
    A socket in a sockmap may have different combinations of programs attached
    depending on configuration. There can be no programs in which case the socket
    acts as a sink only. There can be a TX program in this case a BPF program is
    attached to sending side, but no RX program is attached. There can be an RX
    program only where sends have no BPF program attached, but receives are hooked
    with BPF. And finally, both TX and RX programs may be attached. Giving us the
    permutations:
    
     None, Tx, Rx, and TxRx
    
    To date most of our use cases have been TX case being used as a fast datapath
    to directly copy between local application and a userspace proxy. Or Rx cases
    and TxRX applications that are operating an in kernel based proxy. The traffic
    in the first case where we hook applications into a userspace application looks
    like this:
    
      AppA  redirect   AppB
       Tx <-----------> Rx
       |                |
       +                +
       TCP <--> lo <--> TCP
    
    In this case all traffic from AppA (after 3whs) is copied into the AppB
    ingress queue and no traffic is ever on the TCP recieive_queue.
    
    In the second case the application never receives, except in some rare error
    cases, traffic on the actual user space socket. Instead the send happens in
    the kernel.
    
               AppProxy       socket pool
           sk0 ------------->{sk1,sk2, skn}
            ^                      |
            |                      |
            |                      v
           ingress              lb egress
           TCP                  TCP
    
    Here because traffic is never read off the socket with userspace recv() APIs
    there is only ever one reader on the sk receive_queue. Namely the BPF programs.
    
    However, we've started to introduce a third configuration where the BPF program
    on receive should process the data, but then the normal case is to push the
    data into the receive queue of AppB.
    
           AppB
           recv()                (userspace)
         -----------------------
           tcp_bpf_recvmsg()     (kernel)
             |             |
             |             |
             |             |
           ingress_msgQ    |
             |             |
           RX_BPF          |
             |             |
             v             v
           sk->receive_queue
    
    This is different from the App{A,B} redirect because traffic is first received
    on the sk->receive_queue.
    
    Now for the issue. The tcp_bpf_recvmsg() handler first checks the ingress_msg
    queue for any data handled by the BPF rx program and returned with PASS code
    so that it was enqueued on the ingress msg queue. Then if no data exists on
    that queue it checks the socket receive queue. Unfortunately, this is the same
    receive_queue the BPF program is reading data off of. So we get a race. Its
    possible for the recvmsg() hook to pull data off the receive_queue before the
    BPF hook has a chance to read it. It typically happens when an application is
    banging on recv() and getting EAGAINs. Until they manage to race with the RX
    BPF program.
    
    To fix this we note that before this patch at attach time when the socket is
    loaded into the map we check if it needs a TX program or just the base set of
    proto bpf hooks. Then it uses the above general RX hook regardless of if we
    have a BPF program attached at rx or not. This patch now extends this check to
    handle all cases enumerated above, TX, RX, TXRX, and none. And to fix above
    race when an RX program is attached we use a new hook that is nearly identical
    to the old one except now we do not let the recv() call skip the RX BPF program.
    Now only the BPF program pulls data from sk->receive_queue and recv() only
    pulls data from the ingress msgQ post BPF program handling.
    
    With this resolved our AppB from above has been up and running for many hours
    without detecting any errors. We do this by correlating counters in RX BPF
    events and the AppB to ensure data is never skipping the BPF program. Selftests,
    was not able to detect this because we only run them for a short period of time
    on well ordered send/recvs so we don't get any of the noise we see in real
    application environments.

    bpf, sockmap: Remove unhash handler for BPF sockmap usage
    
    [ Upstream commit b8b8315e39ffaca82e79d86dde26e9144addf66b ]
    
    We do not need to handle unhash from BPF side we can simply wait for the
    close to happen. The original concern was a socket could transition from
    ESTABLISHED state to a new state while the BPF hook was still attached.
    But, we convinced ourself this is no longer possible and we also improved
    BPF sockmap to handle listen sockets so this is no longer a problem.
    
    More importantly though there are cases where unhash is called when data is
    in the receive queue. The BPF unhash logic will flush this data which is
    wrong. To be correct it should keep the data in the receive queue and allow
    a receiving application to continue reading the data. This may happen when
    tcp_abort() is received for example. Instead of complicating the logic in
    unhash simply moving all this to tcp_close() hook solves this.

    arm64: arm64_ftr_reg->name may not be a human-readable string
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dc232a8ab18bb20f1dcb03c8e049e3607f3ed15 ]
    
    The id argument of ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE() is used for two purposes:
    one as the system register encoding (used for the sys_id field of
    __ftr_reg_entry), and the other as the register name (stringified
    and used for the name field of arm64_ftr_reg), which is debug
    information. The id argument is supposed to be a macro that
    indicates an encoding of the register (eg. SYS_ID_AA64PFR0_EL1, etc).
    
    ARM64_FTR_REG(), which also has the same id argument,
    uses ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE() and passes the id to the macro.
    Since the id argument is completely macro-expanded before it is
    substituted into a macro body of ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE(),
    the stringified id in the body of ARM64_FTR_REG_OVERRIDE is not
    a human-readable register name, but a string of numeric bitwise
    operations.
    
    Fix this so that human-readable register names are available as
    debug information.

    mm/zsmalloc.c: close race window between zs_pool_dec_isolated() and zs_unregister_migration()
    
    [ Upstream commit afe8605ca45424629fdddfd85984b442c763dc47 ]
    
    There is one possible race window between zs_pool_dec_isolated() and
    zs_unregister_migration() because wait_for_isolated_drain() checks the
    isolated count without holding class->lock and there is no order inside
    zs_pool_dec_isolated().  Thus the below race window could be possible:
    
      zs_pool_dec_isolated          zs_unregister_migration
        check pool->destroying != 0
                                      pool->destroying = true;
                                      smp_mb();
                                      wait_for_isolated_drain()
                                        wait for pool->isolated_pages == 0
        atomic_long_dec(&pool->isolated_pages);
        atomic_long_read(&pool->isolated_pages) == 0
    
    Since we observe the pool->destroying (false) before atomic_long_dec()
    for pool->isolated_pages, waking pool->migration_wait up is missed.
    
    Fix this by ensure checking pool->destroying happens after the
    atomic_long_dec(&pool->isolated_pages).

    In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode() fails, the function
    directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the

    let the function continue.

    drm: fb_helper: improve CONFIG_FB dependency
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d6366e743f37d36ef69347924ead7bcc596076e ]
    
    My previous patch correctly addressed the possible link failure, but as
    Jani points out, the dependency is now stricter than it needs to be.
    
    Change it again, to allow DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION to be used when
    DRM_KMS_HELPER and FB are both loadable modules and DRM is linked into
    the kernel.
    
    As a side-effect, the option is now only visible when at least one DRM
    driver makes use of DRM_KMS_HELPER. This is better, because the option
    has no effect otherwise.

    selftests/bpf/xdp_redirect_multi: Limit the tests in netns
    
    [ Upstream commit 8955c1a329873385775081e029d9a7c6aa9037e1 ]
    
    As I want to test both DEVMAP and DEVMAP_HASH in XDP multicast redirect, I
    limited DEVMAP max entries to a small value for performace. When the test
    runs after amount of interface creating/deleting tests. The interface index
    will exceed the map max entries and xdp_redirect_multi will error out with
    "Get interfacesInterface index to large".
    
    Fix this issue by limit the tests in netns and specify the ifindex when
    creating interfaces.

    [ Upstream commit fae2570d629cdd72f0611d015fc4ba705ae5422b ]
    
    The resource_size defines that:
            res->end - res->start + 1;
    The origin original code is:
            sysmgr_config.max_register = res->end - res->start - 3;
    
    So, the correct fix is that:
            sysmgr_config.max_register = resource_size(res) - 4;

    Put new_slave in bond_sysfs_slave_add() will cause use-after-free problems
    when new_slave is accessed in the subsequent error handling process. Since
    new_slave will be put in the subsequent error handling process, remove the
    unnecessary put to fix it.
    In addition, when sysfs_create_file() fails, if some files have been crea-
    ted successfully, we need to call sysfs_remove_file() to remove them.
    Since there are sysfs_create_files() & sysfs_remove_files() can be used,
    use these two functions instead.

    drm/ttm: remove ttm_bo_vm_insert_huge()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d979509539ed1df883a30d442177ca7be609565 ]
    
    The huge page functionality in TTM does not work safely because PUD and
    PMD entries do not have a special bit.
    
    get_user_pages_fast() considers any page that passed pmd_huge() as
    usable:
    
            if (unlikely(pmd_trans_huge(pmd) || pmd_huge(pmd) ||
                         pmd_devmap(pmd))) {
    
    And vmf_insert_pfn_pmd_prot() unconditionally sets
    
            entry = pmd_mkhuge(pfn_t_pmd(pfn, prot));
    
    eg on x86 the page will be _PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_PSE.
    
    As such gup_huge_pmd() will try to deref a struct page:
    
            head = try_grab_compound_head(pmd_page(orig), refs, flags);
    
    and thus crash.
    
    Thomas further notices that the drivers are not expecting the struct page
    to be used by anything - in particular the refcount incr above will cause
    them to malfunction.
    
    Thus everything about this is not able to fully work correctly considering
    GUP_fast. Delete it entirely. It can return someday along with a proper
    PMD/PUD_SPECIAL bit in the page table itself to gate GUP_fast.

    net: phy: fix duplex out of sync problem while changing settings
    
    [ Upstream commit a4db9055fdb9cf607775c66d39796caf6439ec92 ]
    
    As reported by Zhang there's a small issue if in forced mode the duplex
    mode changes with the link staying up [0]. In this case the MAC isn't
    notified about the change.
    
    The proposed patch relies on the phylib state machine and ignores the
    fact that there are drivers that uses phylib but not the phylib state
    machine. So let's don't change the behavior for such drivers and fix
    it w/o re-adding state PHY_FORCING for the case that phylib state
    machine is used.

    Commit a365ab6b9dfb ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Implement the
    ->adjust_perf() callback") caused intel_pstate to use nonzero HWP
    desired values in certain usage scenarios, but it did not prevent
    them from being leaked into the confugirations in which HWP desired
    is expected to be 0.
    
    The failing scenarios are switching the driver from the passive
    mode to the active mode and starting a new kernel via kexec() while
    intel_pstate is running in the passive mode.
    
    To address this issue, ensure that HWP desired will be cleared on
    offline and suspend/shutdown.

    ataflop: remove ataflop_probe_lock mutex
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ddb85d36613c45bde00d368bf9f357bd0708a0c ]
    
    Commit bf9c0538e485b591 ("ataflop: use a separate gendisk for each media
    format") introduced ataflop_probe_lock mutex, but forgot to unlock the
    mutex when atari_floppy_init() (i.e. module loading) succeeded. This will
    result in double lock deadlock if ataflop_probe() is called. Also,
    unregister_blkdev() must not be called from atari_floppy_init() with
    ataflop_probe_lock held when atari_floppy_init() failed, for
    ataflop_probe() waits for ataflop_probe_lock with major_names_lock held
    (i.e. AB-BA deadlock).
    
    __register_blkdev() needs to be called last in order to avoid calling
    ataflop_probe() when atari_floppy_init() is about to fail, for memory for
    completing already-started ataflop_probe() safely will be released as soon
    as atari_floppy_init() released ataflop_probe_lock mutex.
    
    As with commit 8b52d8be86d72308 ("loop: reorder loop_exit"),
    unregister_blkdev() needs to be called first in order to avoid calling
    ataflop_alloc_disk() from ataflop_probe() after del_gendisk() from
    atari_floppy_exit().
    
    By relocating __register_blkdev() / unregister_blkdev() as explained above,
    we can remove ataflop_probe_lock mutex, for probe function and __exit
    function are serialized by major_names_lock mutex.

    [ Upstream commit deae1138d04758c7f8939fcb8aee330bc37e3015 ]
    
    Instead of using two separate code paths for cleaning up an atari disk,
    use one. We take the more careful approach to check for *all* disk
    types, as is done on exit. The init path didn't have that check as
    the alternative disk types are only probed for later, they are not
    initialized by default.
    
    Yes, there is a shared tag for all disks.

    The ataflop assumes del_gendisk() is safe to call, this is only
    true because add_disk() does not return a failure, but that will
    change soon. And so, before we get to adding error handling for
    that case, let's make sure we keep track of which disks actually
    get registered. Then we use this to only call del_gendisk for them.

    [ Upstream commit 6bb8c2d51811eb5e6504f49efe3b089d026009d2 ]
    
    The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of

    to decrease the refcount of mm increased by get_task_mm(), causing a
    refcount leak.

    Also, the function forgets to do check against null when get mm
    by get_task_mm().

    ACPI: PMIC: Fix intel_pmic_regs_handler() read accesses
    
    [ Upstream commit 009a789443fe4c8e6b1ecb7c16b4865c026184cd ]
    
    The handling of PMIC register reads through writing 0 to address 4
    of the OpRegion is wrong. Instead of returning the read value
    through the value64, which is a no-op for function == ACPI_WRITE calls,
    store the value and then on a subsequent function == ACPI_READ with
    address == 3 (the address for the value field of the OpRegion)
    return the stored value.
    
    This has been tested on a Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 and makes the ACPI battery dev
    there mostly functional (unfortunately there are still other issues).
    
    Here are the SET() / GET() functions of the PMIC ACPI device,
    which use this OpRegion, which clearly show the new behavior to
    be correct:
    
    OperationRegion (REGS, 0x8F, Zero, 0x50)
    Field (REGS, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
    {
        CLNT,   8,
        SA,     8,
        OFF,    8,
        VAL,    8,
        RWM,    8
    }
    
    Method (GET, 3, Serialized)
    {
        If ((AVBE == One))
        {
            CLNT = Arg0
            SA = Arg1
            OFF = Arg2
            RWM = Zero
            If ((AVBG == One))
            {
                GPRW = Zero
            }

    ice: Fix not stopping Tx queues for VFs
    
    [ Upstream commit b385cca47363316c6d9a74ae9db407bbc281f815 ]
    
    When a VF is removed and/or reset its Tx queues need to be
    stopped from the PF. This is done by calling the ice_dis_vf_qs()
    function, which calls ice_vsi_stop_lan_tx_rings(). Currently
    ice_dis_vf_qs() is protected by the VF state bit ICE_VF_STATE_QS_ENA.
    Unfortunately, this is causing the Tx queues to not be disabled in some
    cases and when the VF tries to re-enable/reconfigure its Tx queues over
    virtchnl the op is failing. This is because a VF can be reset and/or
    removed before the ICE_VF_STATE_QS_ENA bit is set, but the Tx queues
    were already configured via ice_vsi_cfg_single_txq() in the
    VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES op. However, the ICE_VF_STATE_QS_ENA bit
    is set on a successful VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES, which will always
    happen after the VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES op.
    
    This was causing the following error message when loading the ice
    driver, creating VFs, and modifying VF trust in an endless loop:
    
    [35274.192484] ice 0000:88:00.0: Failed to set LAN Tx queue context, error: ICE_ERR_PARAM
    [35274.193074] ice 0000:88:00.0: VF 0 failed opcode 6, retval: -5
    [35274.193640] iavf 0000:88:01.0: PF returned error -5 (IAVF_ERR_PARAM) to our request 6
    
    Fix this by always calling ice_dis_vf_qs() and silencing the error
    message in ice_vsi_stop_tx_ring() since the calling code ignores the
    return anyway. Also, all other places that call ice_vsi_stop_tx_ring()
    catch the error, so this doesn't affect those flows since there was no
    change to the values the function returns.
    
    Other solutions were considered (i.e. tracking which VF queues had been
    "started/configured" in VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES, but it seemed
    more complicated than it was worth. This solution also brings in the
    chance for other unexpected conditions due to invalid state bit checks.
    So, the proposed solution seemed like the best option since there is no
    harm in failing to stop Tx queues that were never started.
    
    This issue can be seen using the following commands:
    
    for i in {0..50}; do
            rmmod ice
            modprobe ice
    
            sleep 1
    
            echo 1 > /sys/class/net/ens785f0/device/sriov_numvfs
            echo 1 > /sys/class/net/ens785f1/device/sriov_numvfs

            ip link set ens785f0 vf 0 trust on

    net: dsa: felix: fix broken VLAN-tagged PTP under VLAN-aware bridge
    
    [ Upstream commit 92f62485b3715882cd397b0cbd80a96d179b86d6 ]
    
    Normally it is expected that the dsa_device_ops :: rcv() method finishes
    parsing the DSA tag and consumes it, then never looks at it again.
    
    But commit c0bcf537667c ("net: dsa: ocelot: add hardware timestamping
    support for Felix") added support for RX timestamping in a very
    unconventional way. On this switch, a partial timestamp is available in
    the DSA header, but the driver got away with not parsing that timestamp
    right away, but instead delayed that parsing for a little longer:
    
    dsa_switch_rcv():
            nskb = cpu_dp->rcv(skb, dev); <------------- not here
            -> ocelot_rcv()
            ...
    
            skb = nskb;
            skb_push(skb, ETH_HLEN);
            skb->pkt_type = PACKET_HOST;
            skb->protocol = eth_type_trans(skb, skb->dev);
    
            ...
    
            if (dsa_skb_defer_rx_timestamp(p, skb)) <--- but here
            -> felix_rxtstamp()
                    return 0;
    
    When in felix_rxtstamp(), this driver accounted for the fact that
    eth_type_trans() happened in the meanwhile, so it got a hold of the
    extraction header again by subtracting (ETH_HLEN + OCELOT_TAG_LEN) bytes
    from the current skb->data.
    
    This worked for quite some time but was quite fragile from the very
    beginning. Not to mention that having DSA tag parsing split in two
    different files, under different folders (net/dsa/tag_ocelot.c vs
    drivers/net/dsa/ocelot/felix.c) made it quite non-obvious for patches to
    come that they might break this.
    
    Finally, the blamed commit does the following: at the end of
    ocelot_rcv(), it checks whether the skb payload contains a VLAN header.
    If it does, and this port is under a VLAN-aware bridge, that VLAN ID
    might not be correct in the sense that the packet might have suffered
    VLAN rewriting due to TCAM rules (VCAP IS1). So we consume the VLAN ID
    from the skb payload using __skb_vlan_pop(), and take the classified
    VLAN ID from the DSA tag, and construct a hwaccel VLAN tag with the
    classified VLAN, and the skb payload is VLAN-untagged.
    
    The big problem is that __skb_vlan_pop() does:
    
            memmove(skb->data + VLAN_HLEN, skb->data, 2 * ETH_ALEN);
            __skb_pull(skb, VLAN_HLEN);
    
    aka it moves the Ethernet header 4 bytes to the right, and pulls 4 bytes
    from the skb headroom (effectively also moving skb->data, by definition).
    So for felix_rxtstamp()'s fragile logic, all bets are off now.
    Instead of having the "extraction" pointer point to the DSA header,
    it actually points to 4 bytes _inside_ the extraction header.
    Corollary, the last 4 bytes of the "extraction" header are in fact 4
    stale bytes of the destination MAC address from the Ethernet header,
    from prior to the __skb_vlan_pop() movement.
    
    So of course, RX timestamps are completely bogus when the system is
    configured in this way.
    
    The fix is actually very simple: just don't structure the code like that.
    For better or worse, the DSA PTP timestamping API does not offer a
    straightforward way for drivers to present their RX timestamps, but
    other drivers (sja1105) have established a simple mechanism to carry
    their RX timestamp from dsa_device_ops :: rcv() all the way to
    dsa_switch_ops :: port_rxtstamp() and even later. That mechanism is to
    simply save the partial timestamp to the skb->cb, and complete it later.
    
    Question: why don't we simply populate the skb's struct
    skb_shared_hwtstamps from ocelot_rcv(), and bother with this
    complication of propagating the timestamp to felix_rxtstamp()?
    
    Answer: dsa_switch_ops :: port_rxtstamp() answers the question whether
    PTP packets need sleepable context to retrieve the full RX timestamp.
    Currently felix_rxtstamp() answers "no, thanks" to that question, and
    calls ocelot_ptp_gettime64() from softirq atomic context. This is
    understandable, since Felix VSC9959 is a PCIe memory-mapped switch, so
    hardware access does not require sleeping. But the felix driver is
    preparing for the introduction of other switches where hardware access
    is over a slow bus like SPI or MDIO:
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210814025003.2449143-1-colin.foster@in-advantage.com/
    
    So I would like to keep this code structure, so the rework needed when
    that driver will need PTP support will be minimal (answer "yes, I need
    deferred context for this skb's RX timestamp", then the partial
    timestamp will still be found in the skb->cb.

    net: dsa: tag_ocelot: break circular dependency with ocelot switch lib driver
    
    [ Upstream commit deab6b1cd9789bb9bd466d5e76aecb8b336259b4 ]
    
    As explained here:
    https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210908220834.d7gmtnwrorhharna@skbuf/
    DSA tagging protocol drivers cannot depend on symbols exported by switch
    drivers, because this creates a circular dependency that breaks module
    autoloading.
    
    The tag_ocelot.c file depends on the ocelot_ptp_rew_op() function
    exported by the common ocelot switch lib. This function looks at
    OCELOT_SKB_CB(skb) and computes how to populate the REW_OP field of the
    DSA tag, for PTP timestamping (the command: one-step/two-step, and the
    TX timestamp identifier).
    
    None of that requires deep insight into the driver, it is quite
    stateless, as it only depends upon the skb->cb. So let's make it a
    static inline function and put it in include/linux/dsa/ocelot.h, a
    file that despite its name is used by the ocelot switch driver for
    populating the injection header too - since commit 40d3f295b5fe ("net:
    mscc: ocelot: use common tag parsing code with DSA").
    
    With that function declared as static inline, its body is expanded
    inside each call site, so the dependency is broken and the DSA tagger
    can be built without the switch library, upon which the felix driver
    depends.

    openrisc: fix SMP tlb flush NULL pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit 27dff9a9c247d4e38d82c2e7234914cfe8499294 ]
    
    Throughout the OpenRISC kernel port VMA is passed as NULL when flushing
    kernel tlb entries.  Somehow this was missed when I was testing
    c28b27416da9 ("openrisc: Implement proper SMP tlb flushing") and now the
    SMP kernel fails to completely boot.
    
    In OpenRISC VMA is used only to determine which cores need to have their
    TLB entries flushed.
    
    This patch updates the logic to flush tlbs on all cores when the VMA is
    passed as NULL.  Also, we update places VMA is passed as NULL to use
    flush_tlb_kernel_range instead.  Now, the only place VMA is passed as
    NULL is in the implementation of flush_tlb_kernel_range.

    [ Upstream commit e4c4871a73944353ea23e319de27ef73ce546623 ]
    
    commit b1a811633f73 ("block: nbd: add sanity check for first_minor")
    checks that 'first_minor' should not be greater than 0xff, which is
    wrong. Whitout the commit, the details that when user pass 0x100000,
    it ends up create sysfs dir "/sys/block/43:0" are as follows:
    
    nbd_dev_add
     disk->first_minor = index << part_shift
      -> default part_shift is 5, first_minor is 0x2000000
      device_add_disk
       ddev->devt = MKDEV(disk->major, disk->first_minor)
        -> (0x2b << 20) | (0x2000000) = 0x2b00000
       device_add
        device_create_sys_dev_entry
             format_dev_t
              sprintf(buffer, "%u:%u", MAJOR(dev), MINOR(dev));
               -> got 43:0
              sysfs_create_link -> /sys/block/43:0
    
    By the way, with the wrong fix, when part_shift is the default value,
    only 8 ndb devices can be created since 8 << 5 is greater than 0xff.
    
    Since the max bits for 'first_minor' should be the same as what
    MKDEV() does, which is 20. Change the upper bound of 'first_minor'
    from 0xff to 0xfffff.

    [ Upstream commit 7f98960c046ee1136e7096aee168eda03aef8a5d ]
    
    A successful 'clk_prepare()' call should be balanced by a corresponding
    'clk_unprepare()' call in the error handling path of the probe, as already
    done in the remove function.
    
    More specifically, 'clk_prepare_enable()' is used, but 'clk_disable()' is
    also already called. So just the unprepare step has still to be done.
    
    Update the error handling path accordingly.

    If we already hold open state on the client, yet the server gives us a

    currently treat it as if it were an out-of-sequence update, and wait for

    This commit fixes the behaviour so that we immediately start processing
    of the new stateid, and then leave it to the call to
    nfs4_test_and_free_stateid() to decide what to do with the old stateid.

    scsi: target: core: Remove from tmr_list during LUN unlink
    
    [ Upstream commit 12b6fcd0ea7f3cb7c3b34668fc678779924123ae ]
    
    Currently TMF commands are removed from de_device.dev_tmf_list at the very
    end of se_cmd lifecycle. However, se_lun unlinks from se_cmd upon a command
    status (response) being queued in transport layer. This means that LUN and
    backend device can be deleted in the meantime and a panic will occur:
    
    target_tmr_work()
            cmd->se_tfo->queue_tm_rsp(cmd); // send abort_rsp to a wire
            transport_lun_remove_cmd(cmd) // unlink se_cmd from se_lun
    - // - // - // -
    <<<--- lun remove
    <<<--- core backend device remove
    - // - // - // -
    qlt_handle_abts_completion()
      tfo->free_mcmd()
        transport_generic_free_cmd()
          target_put_sess_cmd()
            core_tmr_release_req() {
              if (dev) { // backend device, can not be null
                spin_lock_irqsave(&dev->se_tmr_lock, flags); //<<<--- CRASH
    
    Call Trace:

    process_one_work+0x2c4/0x5c0
    worker_thread+0x88/0x690
    
    For the iSCSI protocol this is easily reproduced:
    
     - Send some SCSI sommand
    
     - Send Abort of that command over iSCSI
    
     - Remove LUN on target
    
     - Send next iSCSI command to acknowledge the Abort_Response
    
     - Target panics
    
    There is no need to keep the command in tmr_list until response completion,
    so move the removal from tmr_list from the response completion to the
    response queueing when the LUN is unlinked.  Move the removal from state
    list too as it is a subject to the same race condition.

    m68k: set a default value for MEMORY_RESERVE
    
    [ Upstream commit 1aaa557b2db95c9506ed0981bc34505c32d6b62b ]
    
    'make randconfig' can produce a .config file with
    "CONFIG_MEMORY_RESERVE=" (no value) since it has no default.
    When a subsequent 'make all' is done, kconfig restarts the config
    and prompts for a value for MEMORY_RESERVE. This breaks
    scripting/automation where there is no interactive user input.
    
    Add a default value for MEMORY_RESERVE. (Any integer value will
    work here for kconfig.)

    signal/sh: Use force_sig(SIGKILL) instead of do_group_exit(SIGKILL)
    
    [ Upstream commit ce0ee4e6ac99606f3945f4d47775544edc3f7985 ]
    
    Today the sh code allocates memory the first time a process uses
    the fpu.  If that memory allocation fails, kill the affected task
    with force_sig(SIGKILL) rather than do_group_exit(SIGKILL).
    
    Calling do_group_exit from an exception handler can potentially lead
    to dead locks as do_group_exit is not designed to be called from
    interrupt context.  Instead use force_sig(SIGKILL) to kill the
    userspace process.  Sending signals in general and force_sig in
    particular has been tested from interrupt context so there should be
    no problems.

    With the introduction of `callback_result` two helpers where introduced to
    transparently handle both types of callbacks. And drivers where updated to
    look like this:
    
            if (dmaengine_desc_callback_valid(cb)) {
                    spin_unlock(&dma->lock);
                    dmaengine_desc_callback_invoke(cb, ...);
                    spin_lock(&dma->lock);
            }
    
    dmaengine_desc_callback_invoke() correctly handles both `callback_result`
    and `callback`. But we forgot to update the dmaengine_desc_callback_valid()
    function to check for `callback_result`. As a result DMA descriptors that
    use the `callback_result` rather than `callback` don't have their callback
    invoked by drivers that follow the pattern above.
    
    Fix this by checking for both `callback` and `callback_result` in
    dmaengine_desc_callback_valid().

    netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: fix OOB when mac header was cleared
    
    [ Upstream commit 5648b5e1169ff1d6d6a46c35c0b5fbebd2a5cbb2 ]
    
    On 64bit platforms the MAC header is set to 0xffff on allocation and
    also when a helper like skb_unset_mac_header() is called.
    
    dev_parse_header may call skb_mac_header() which assumes valid mac offset:

    [ Upstream commit 840fe258332544aa7321921e1723d37b772af7a9 ]
    
    As the ht16k33 frame buffer sub-driver does not register an

        $ echo 1 > /sys/class/graphics/fb0/blank
        sh: write error: Invalid argument
    
    Fix this by providing a handler that always returns zero, to make sure
    blank events will be sent to the actual device handling the backlight.

    [ Upstream commit afcb5a811ff3ab3969f09666535eb6018a160358 ]
    
    While writing an empty string to a device attribute is a no-op, and thus
    does not need explicit safeguards, the user can still write a single
    newline to an attribute file:
    
        echo > .../message
    
    If that happens, img_ascii_lcd_display() trims the newline, yielding an
    empty string, and causing an infinite loop in img_ascii_lcd_scroll().
    
    Fix this by adding a check for empty strings.  Clear the display in case
    one is encountered.

    PCI: uniphier: Serialize INTx masking/unmasking and fix the bit operation
    
    [ Upstream commit 4caab28a6215da5f3c1b505ff08810bc6acfe365 ]
    
    The condition register PCI_RCV_INTX is used in irq_mask() and irq_unmask()
    callbacks. Accesses to register can occur at the same time without a lock.
    Add a lock into each callback to prevent the issue.
    
    And INTX mask and unmask fields in PCL_RCV_INTX register should only be
    set/reset for each bit. Clearing by PCL_RCV_INTX_ALL_MASK should be
    removed.
    
    INTX status fields in PCL_RCV_INTX register only indicates each INTX
    interrupt status, so the handler can't clear by writing 1 to the field.
    The status is expected to be cleared by the interrupt origin.
    The ack function has no meaning, so should remove it.

    [ Upstream commit 78e4d342187625585932bb437ec26e1060f7fc6f ]
    
    hisi_spi_nor_probe() invokes clk_disable_unprepare() on all paths after
    successful call of clk_prepare_enable(). Besides, the clock is enabled by
    hispi_spi_nor_prep() and disabled by hispi_spi_nor_unprep(). So at remove
    time it is not possible to have the clock enabled. The patch removes
    excessive clk_disable_unprepare() from hisi_spi_nor_remove().

    Input: st1232 - increase "wait ready" timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit 2667f6b7af99e81958fa97c03bb519fcb09d0055 ]
    
    I have a ST1633 touch controller which fails to probe due to a timeout
    waiting for the controller to become ready.  Increasing the minimum
    delay to 100ms ensures that the probe sequence completes successfully.
    
    The ST1633 datasheet says nothing about the maximum delay here and the
    ST1232 I2C protocol document says "wait until" with no notion of a
    timeout.
    
    Since this only runs once during probe, being generous with the timout
    seems reasonable and most likely the device will become ready
    eventually.
    
    (It may be worth noting that I saw this issue with a PREEMPT_RT patched
    kernel which probably has tighter wakeups from usleep_range() than other
    preemption models.)

    PCI: aardvark: Fix preserving PCI_EXP_RTCTL_CRSSVE flag on emulated bridge
    
    [ Upstream commit d419052bc6c60fa4ab2b5a51d5f1e55a66e2b4ff ]
    
    Commit 43f5c77bcbd2 ("PCI: aardvark: Fix reporting CRS value") started
    using CRSSVE flag for handling CRS responses.
    
    PCI_EXP_RTCTL_CRSSVE flag is stored only in emulated config space buffer
    and there is handler for PCI_EXP_RTCTL register. So every read operation
    from config space automatically clears CRSSVE flag as it is not defined in
    PCI_EXP_RTCTL read handler.
    
    Fix this by reading current CRSSVE bit flag from emulated space buffer and
    appending it to PCI_EXP_RTCTL read response.

    [ Upstream commit eea413308f2e6deb00f061f18081a53f3ecc8cc6 ]
    
    Both NFSv3 and NFSv2 generate their change attribute from the ctime
    value that was supplied by the server. However the problem is that there
    are plenty of servers out there with ctime resolutions of 1ms or worse.
    In a modern performance system, this is insufficient when trying to
    decide which is the most recent set of attributes when, for instance, a
    READ or GETATTR call races with a WRITE or SETATTR.
    
    For this reason, let's revert to labelling the NFSv2/v3 change
    attributes as NFS4_CHANGE_TYPE_IS_UNDEFINED. This will ensure we protect
    against such races.

    Currently autoloading for SPI devices does not use the DT ID table, it uses
    SPI modalises. Supporting OF modalises is going to be difficult if not
    impractical, an attempt was made but has been reverted, so ensure that
    module autoloading works for this driver by adding an id_table listing the

    RDMA/core: Require the driver to set the IOVA correctly during rereg_mr
    
    [ Upstream commit f1a090f09f42be5a5542009f0be310fdb3e768fc ]
    
    If the driver returns a new MR during rereg it has to fill it with the
    IOVA from the proper source. If IB_MR_REREG_TRANS is set then the IOVA is
    cmd.hca_va, otherwise the IOVA comes from the old MR. mlx5 for example has
    two calls inside rereg_mr:
    
                    return create_real_mr(new_pd, umem, mr->ibmr.iova,
                                          new_access_flags);
    and
                    return create_real_mr(new_pd, new_umem, iova, new_access_flags);
    
    Unconditionally overwriting the iova in the newly allocated MR will
    corrupt the iova if the first path is used.
    
    Remove the redundant initializations from ib_uverbs_rereg_mr().

    mips: cm: Convert to bitfield API to fix out-of-bounds access
    
    [ Upstream commit 18b8f5b6fc53d097cadb94a93d8d6566ba88e389 ]
    
    mips_cm_error_report() extracts the cause and other cause from the error
    register using shifts.  This works fine for the former, as it is stored
    in the top bits, and the shift will thus remove all non-related bits.
    However, the latter is stored in the bottom bits, hence thus needs masking
    to get rid of non-related bits.  Without such masking, using it as an
    index into the cm2_causes[] array will lead to an out-of-bounds access,
    probably causing a crash.
    
    Fix this by using FIELD_GET() instead.  Bite the bullet and convert all
    MIPS CM handling to the bitfield API, to improve readability and safety.

    ASoC: cs42l42: Correct configuring of switch inversion from ts-inv
    
    [ Upstream commit 778a0cbef5fb76bf506f84938517bb77e7a1c478 ]
    
    The setting from the cirrus,ts-inv property should be applied to the
    TIP_SENSE_INV bit, as this is the one that actually affects the jack
    detect block. The TS_INV bit only swaps the meaning of the PLUG and
    UNPLUG interrupts and should always be 1 for the interrupts to have
    the normal meaning.
    
    Due to some misunderstanding the driver had been implemented to
    configure the TS_INV bit based on the jack switch polarity. This made
    the interrupts behave the correct way around, but left the jack detect
    block, button detect and analogue circuits always interpreting an open
    switch as unplugged.
    
    The signal chain inside the codec is:
    
    SENSE pin -> TIP_SENSE_INV -> TS_INV -> (invert) -> interrupts
                      |
                      v
                 Jack detect,
              button detect and
                analog control
    
    As the TIP_SENSE_INV already performs the necessary inversion the
    TS_INV bit never needs to change. It must always be 1 to yield the
    expected interrupt behaviour.
    
    Some extra confusion has arisen because of the additional invert in the
    interrupt path, meaning that a value applied to the TS_INV bit produces
    the opposite effect of applying it to the TIP_SENSE_INV bit. The ts-inv
    property has therefore always had the opposite effect to what might be
    expected (0 = inverted, 1 = not inverted). To maintain the meaning of
    the ts-inv property it must be inverted when applied to TIP_SENSE_INV.

    powerpc: Don't provide __kernel_map_pages() without ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC

    When ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is not selected, the user can
    still select CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC in which case __kernel_map_pages()
    is provided by mm/page_poison.c
    
    So only define __kernel_map_pages() when both
    CONFIG_ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
    are defined.

    ALSA: oxfw: fix functional regression for Mackie Onyx 1640i in v5.14 or later
    
    [ Upstream commit cddcd5472abb7b8a9c37ccbcf0908b79740a01b5 ]
    
    A user reports functional regression for Mackie Onyx 1640i that the device
    generates slow sound with ALSA oxfw driver which supports media clock
    recovery. Although the device is based on OXFW971 ASIC, it does not
    transfer isochronous packet with own event frequency as expected. The
    device seems to adjust event frequency according to events in received
    isochronous packets in the beginning of packet streaming. This is
    unknown quirk.
    
    This commit fixes the regression to turn the recovery off in driver
    side. As a result, nominal frequency is used in duplex packet streaming
    between device and driver. For stability of sampling rate in events of
    transferred isochronous packet, 4,000 isochronous packets are skipped
    in the beginning of packet streaming.

    powerpc/book3e: Fix set_memory_x() and set_memory_nx()
    
    [ Upstream commit b6cb20fdc2735f8b2e082937066c33fe376c2ee2 ]
    
    set_memory_x() calls pte_mkexec() which sets _PAGE_EXEC.
    set_memory_nx() calls pte_exprotec() which clears _PAGE_EXEC.
    
    Book3e has 2 bits, UX and SX, which defines the exec rights
    resp. for user (PR=1) and for kernel (PR=0).
    
    _PAGE_EXEC is defined as UX only.
    
    An executable kernel page is set with either _PAGE_KERNEL_RWX
    or _PAGE_KERNEL_ROX, which both have SX set and UX cleared.
    
    So set_memory_nx() call for an executable kernel page does
    nothing because UX is already cleared.
    
    And set_memory_x() on a non-executable kernel page makes it
    executable for the user and keeps it non-executable for kernel.
    
    Also, pte_exec() always returns 'false' on kernel pages, because
    it checks _PAGE_EXEC which doesn't include SX, so for instance
    the W+X check doesn't work.
    
    To fix this:
      - change tlb_low_64e.S to use _PAGE_BAP_UX instead of _PAGE_USER
      - sets both UX and SX in _PAGE_EXEC so that pte_exec() returns
        true whenever one of the two bits is set and pte_exprotect()
        clears both bits.
      - Define a book3e specific version of pte_mkexec() which sets
        either SX or UX based on UR.

    powerpc/nohash: Fix __ptep_set_access_flags() and ptep_set_wrprotect()
    
    [ Upstream commit b1b93cb7e794e914787bf7d9936b57a149cdee4f ]
    
    Commit 26973fa5ac0e ("powerpc/mm: use pte helpers in generic code")
    changed those two functions to use pte helpers to determine which
    bits to clear and which bits to set.
    
    This change was based on the assumption that bits to be set/cleared
    are always the same and can be determined by applying the pte
    manipulation helpers on __pte(0).
    
    But on platforms like book3e, the bits depend on whether the page
    is a user page or not.
    
    For the time being it more or less works because of _PAGE_EXEC being
    used for user pages only and exec right being set at all time on
    kernel page. But following patch will clean that and output of
    pte_mkexec() will depend on the page being a user or kernel page.
    
    Instead of trying to make an even more complicated helper where bits
    would become dependent on the final pte value, come back to a more
    static situation like before commit 26973fa5ac0e ("powerpc/mm: use
    pte helpers in generic code"), by introducing an 8xx specific
    version of __ptep_set_access_flags() and ptep_set_wrprotect().

    HID: u2fzero: clarify error check and length calculations
    
    [ Upstream commit b7abf78b7a6c4a29a6e0ba0bb883fe44a2f3d693 ]
    
    The previous commit fixed handling of incomplete packets but broke error
    handling: offsetof returns an unsigned value (size_t), but when compared
    against the signed return value, the return value is interpreted as if
    it were unsigned, so negative return values are never less than the
    offset.
    
    To make the code easier to read, calculate the minimal packet length
    once and separately, and assign it to a signed int variable to eliminate
    unsigned math and the need for type casts. It then becomes immediately
    obvious how the actual data length is calculated and why the return
    value cannot be less than the minimal length.

    serial: xilinx_uartps: Fix race condition causing stuck TX
    
    [ Upstream commit 88b20f84f0fe47409342669caf3e58a3fc64c316 ]
    
    xilinx_uartps .start_tx() clears TXEMPTY when enabling TXEMPTY to avoid
    any previous TXEVENT event asserting the UART interrupt. This clear
    operation is done immediately after filling the TX FIFO.
    
    However, if the bytes inserted by cdns_uart_handle_tx() are consumed by
    the UART before the TXEMPTY is cleared, the clear operation eats the new
    TXEMPTY event as well, causing cdns_uart_isr() to never receive the
    TXEMPTY event. If there are bytes still queued in circbuf, TX will get
    stuck as they will never get transferred to FIFO (unless new bytes are
    queued to circbuf in which case .start_tx() is called again).
    
    While the racy missed TXEMPTY occurs fairly often with short data
    sequences (e.g. write 1 byte), in those cases circbuf is usually empty
    so no action on TXEMPTY would have been needed anyway. On the other
    hand, longer data sequences make the race much more unlikely as UART
    takes longer to consume the TX FIFO. Therefore it is rare for this race
    to cause visible issues in general.
    
    Fix the race by clearing the TXEMPTY bit in ISR *before* filling the
    FIFO.
    
    The TXEMPTY bit in ISR will only get asserted at the exact moment the
    TX FIFO *becomes* empty, so clearing the bit before filling FIFO does
    not cause an extra immediate assertion even if the FIFO is initially
    empty.
    
    This is hard to reproduce directly on a normal system, but inserting
    e.g. udelay(200) after cdns_uart_handle_tx(port), setting 4000000 baud,
    and then running "dd if=/dev/zero bs=128 of=/dev/ttyPS0 count=50"
    reliably reproduces the issue on my ZynqMP test system unless this fix
    is applied.

    In commit 3e482859f1ef ("dts: qcom: sdm845: Add dt entries

    by constant RPMH_CE_CLK rather than using it directly.
    
    Now that the same RPMH clock value might be used for other

    RPMH_CE_CLK to make sure that this dtsi is compatible with the
    other qcom ones.

    If role is changed without the "none" step, A- and B- valid session could
    be set at the same time. It is an issue.
    This patch resets A-session if role switch sets B-session, and resets
    B-session if role switch sets A-session.
    Then, it is possible to change the role without the "none" step.

    usb: dwc2: drd: fix dwc2_drd_role_sw_set when clock could be disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d387f61b0240854e81450c261beb775065bad5d ]
    
    In case of USB_DR_MODE_PERIPHERAL, the OTG clock is disabled at the end of
    the probe (it is not the case if USB_DR_MODE_HOST or USB_DR_MODE_OTG).
    The clock is then enabled on udc_start.
    If dwc2_drd_role_sw_set is called before udc_start (it is the case if the
    usb cable is plugged at boot), GOTGCTL and GUSBCFG registers cannot be
    read/written, so session cannot be overridden.
    To avoid this case, check the ll_hw_enabled value and enable the clock if
    it is available, and disable it after the override.

    [ Upstream commit b2cab2a24fb5d13ce1d384ecfb6de827fa08a048 ]
    
    Instead of forcing the role to Device, check the dr_mode configuration.
    If the core is Host only, force the mode to Host, this to avoid the
    dwc2_force_mode warning:
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 21 at drivers/usb/dwc2/core.c:615 dwc2_drd_init+0x104/0x17c
    
    When forcing mode to Host, dwc2_force_mode may sleep the time the host
    role is applied. To avoid sleeping while atomic context, move the call
    to dwc2_force_mode after spin_unlock_irqrestore. It is safe, as
    interrupts are not yet unmasked here.

    scsi: lpfc: Wait for successful restart of SLI3 adapter during host sg_reset
    
    [ Upstream commit d305c253af693e69a36cedec880aca6d0c6d789d ]
    
    A prior patch introduced HBA_NEEDS_CFG_PORT flag logic, but in
    lpfc_sli_brdrestart_s3() code path, right after HBA_NEEDS_CFG_PORT is set,
    the phba->hba_flag is cleared in lpfc_sli_brdreset().
    
    Fix by calling lpfc_sli_chipset_init() to wait for successful restart of
    the HBA in lpfc_host_reset_handler() after lpfc_sli_brdrestart().
    
    lpfc_sli_chipset_init() sets the HBA_NEEDS_CFG_PORT flag so that the
    lpfc_sli_hba_setup() routine from lpfc_online() will execute
    lpfc_sli_config_port() initialization step when the brdrestart is
    successful.

    [ Upstream commit b6ca770ae7f2c560a29bbd02c4e3d734fafaf804 ]
    
    UFS drivers that probe defer will end up leaking memory allocated for clk
    and regulator names via kstrdup() because the structure that is holding
    this memory is allocated via devm_* variants which will be freed during
    probe defer but the names are never freed.
    
    Use same devm_* variant of kstrdup to free the memory allocated to name
    when driver probe defers.

    iio: adis: do not disabe IRQs in 'adis_init()'
    
    [ Upstream commit b600bd7eb333554518b4dd36b882b2ae58a5149e ]
    
    With commit ecb010d441088 ("iio: imu: adis: Refactor adis_initial_startup")
    we are doing a HW or SW reset to the device which means that we'll get
    the default state of the data ready pin (which is enabled). Hence there's
    no point in disabling the IRQ in the init function. Moreover, this
    function is intended to initialize internal data structures and not
    really do anything on the device.
    
    As a result of this, some devices were left with the data ready pin enabled
    after probe which was not the desired behavior. Thus, we move the call to
    'adis_enable_irq()' to the initial startup function where it makes more
    sense for it to be.
    
    Note that for devices that cannot mask/unmask the pin, it makes no sense
    to call the function at this point since the IRQ should not have been
    yet requested. This will be improved in a follow up change.

    soc: qcom: rpmhpd: Make power_on actually enable the domain
    
    [ Upstream commit e3e56c050ab6e3f1bd811f0787f50709017543e4 ]
    
    The general expectation is that powering on a power-domain should make
    the power domain deliver some power, and if a specific performance state
    is needed further requests has to be made.
    
    But in contrast with other power-domain implementations (e.g. rpmpd) the
    RPMh does not have an interface to enable the power, so the driver has
    to vote for a particular corner (performance level) in rpmh_power_on().
    
    But the corner is never initialized, so a typical request to simply
    enable the power domain would not actually turn on the hardware. Further
    more, when no more clients vote for a performance state (i.e. the
    aggregated vote is 0) the power domain would be turned off.
    
    Fix both of these issues by always voting for a corner with non-zero
    value, when the power domain is enabled.
    
    The tracking of the lowest non-zero corner is performed to handle the
    corner case if there's ever a domain with a non-zero lowest corner, in
    which case both rpmh_power_on() and rpmh_rpmhpd_set_performance_state()
    would be allowed to use this lowest corner.

    ASoC: cs42l42: Always configure both ASP TX channels
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e6825801ab926360f7f4f2dbcfd107d5ab8f025 ]
    
    An I2S frame always has two slots (left and right) even when sending
    mono. The right channel (channel 2) of ASP TX will always have the
    same bit width as the left channel and will always be on the high
    phase of LRCLK.
    
    The previous implementation always passed the field masks for both
    channels to snd_soc_component_update_bits() but for mono the written value
    only contained the settings for channel 1. The result was that for mono
    channel 2 was set to 8-bit (which is an invalid configuration) with both
    channels on the low phase of LRCLK.

    ARM: dts: stm32: Reduce DHCOR SPI NOR frequency to 50 MHz
    
    [ Upstream commit 2012579b31293d0a8cf2024e9dab66810bf1a15e ]
    
    The SPI NOR is a bit further away from the SoC on DHCOR than on DHCOM,
    which causes additional signal delay. At 108 MHz, this delay triggers
    a sporadic issue where the first bit of RX data is not received by the
    QSPI controller.
    
    There are two options of addressing this problem, either by using the
    DLYB block to compensate the extra delay, or by reducing the QSPI bus
    clock frequency. The former requires calibration and that is overly
    complex, so opt for the second option.

    powerpc/perf: Fix cycles/instructions as PM_CYC/PM_INST_CMPL in power10
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f6aca0e0f26eaaee670cd27896993a45cdc8f9e ]
    
    On power9 and earlier platforms, the default event used for cyles and
    instructions is PM_CYC (0x0001e) and PM_INST_CMPL (0x00002)
    respectively. These events use two programmable PMCs and by default will
    count irrespective of the run latch state (idle state). But since they
    use programmable PMCs, these events can lead to multiplexing with other
    events, because there are only 4 programmable PMCs. Hence in power10,
    performance monitoring unit (PMU) driver uses performance monitor
    counter 5 (PMC5) and performance monitor counter6 (PMC6) for counting
    instructions and cycles.
    
    Currently on power10, the event used for cycles is PM_RUN_CYC (0x600F4)
    and instructions uses PM_RUN_INST_CMPL (0x500fa). But counting of these
    events in idle state is controlled by the CC56RUN bit setting in Monitor
    Mode Control Register0 (MMCR0). If the CC56RUN bit is zero, PMC5/6 will
    not count when CTRL[RUN] (run latch) is zero. This could lead to missing
    some counts if a thread is in idle state during system wide profiling.
    
    To fix it, set the CC56RUN bit in MMCR0 for power10, which makes PMC5
    and PMC6 count instructions and cycles regardless of the run latch
    state. Since this change make PMC5/6 count as PM_INST_CMPL/PM_CYC,
    rename the event code 0x600f4 as PM_CYC instead of PM_RUN_CYC and event
    code 0x500fa as PM_INST_CMPL instead of PM_RUN_INST_CMPL. The changes
    are only for PMC5/6 event codes and will not affect the behaviour of
    PM_RUN_CYC/PM_RUN_INST_CMPL if progammed in other PMC's.

    dyndbg: make dyndbg a known cli param

    Right now dyndbg shows up as an unknown parameter if used on boot:

    That's because it is unknown, it doesn't sit in the __param
    section, so the processing done to warn users supplying an unknown
    parameter doesn't think it is legitimate.
    
    Install a dummy handler to register it. dynamic debug needs to search
    the whole command line for modules listed that are currently builtin,
    so there's no real work to be done in this callback.

    serial: 8250_dw: Drop wrong use of ACPI_PTR()
    
    [ Upstream commit ebabb77a2a115b6c5e68f7364b598310b5f61fb2 ]
    
    ACPI_PTR() is more harmful than helpful. For example, in this case
    if CONFIG_ACPI=n, the ID table left unused which is not what we want.
    
    Instead of adding ifdeffery here and there, drop ACPI_PTR().

    vcpu_is_preempted() can be used outside of preempt-disabled critical

    powerpc: fix unbalanced node refcount in check_kvm_guest()
    
    [ Upstream commit 56537faf8821e361d739fc5ff58c9c40f54a1d4c ]
    
    When check_kvm_guest() succeeds in looking up a /hypervisor OF node, it
    returns without performing a matching put for the lookup, leaving the
    node's reference count elevated.
    
    Add the necessary call to of_node_put(), rearranging the code slightly to
    avoid repetition or goto.

    [ Upstream commit f2719b26ae27282c145202ffd656d5ff1fe737cc ]
    
    While investigating a lockup at startup on Powerbook 3400C, it was
    identified that the fbdev driver generates alignment exception at
    startup:

    This is due to 'dcbz' instruction being used on non-cached memory.
    'dcbz' instruction is used by memset() to zeroize a complete
    cacheline at once, and memset() is not expected to be used on non
    cached memory.
    
    When performing a 'sparse' check on fbdev driver, it also appears
    that the use of memset() is unexpected:
    
      drivers/video/fbdev/chipsfb.c:334:17: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)

    Use fb_memset() instead of memset(). fb_memset() is defined as
    memset_io() for powerpc.

    Currently, at91 pmc driver always register the syscore_ops whatever
    the status of the pmc node that has been found. When set as secure
    and disabled, the pmc should not be accessed or this will generate
    abort exceptions.
    To avoid this, add a check on node availability before registering

    memory: fsl_ifc: fix leak of irq and nand_irq in fsl_ifc_ctrl_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ed2f3545c2e5acfbccd7f85fea5b1a82e9862d7 ]
    
    The error handling code of fsl_ifc_ctrl_probe is problematic. When
    fsl_ifc_ctrl_init fails or request_irq of fsl_ifc_ctrl_dev->irq fails,
    it forgets to free the irq and nand_irq. Meanwhile, if request_irq of
    fsl_ifc_ctrl_dev->nand_irq fails, it will still free nand_irq even if
    the request_irq is not successful.
    
    Fix this by refactoring the error handling code.

    scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix concurrent access to ISR between IRQ polling and real interrupt
    
    [ Upstream commit e7dcc514a49e74051b869697d5ab0370f6301d57 ]
    
    IRQ polling thread calls ISR after enable_irq() to handle any missed I/O
    completion. The atomic flag "in_used" was added to have the synchronization
    between the IRQ polling thread and the interrupt context. There is a bug
    around it leading to a race condition.
    
    Below is the sequence:
    
     - IRQ polling thread accesses ISR, fetches the reply descriptor.
    
     - Real interrupt arrives and pre-empts polling thread (enable_irq() is
       already called).
    
     - Interrupt context picks the same reply descriptor as fetched by polling
       thread, processes it, and exits.
    
     - Polling thread resumes and processes the descriptor which is already
       processed by interrupt thread leads to kernel crash.
    
    Setting the "in_used" flag before fetching the reply descriptor ensures
    synchronized access to ISR.

    ALSA: hda: Reduce udelay() at SKL+ position reporting
    
    [ Upstream commit 46243b85b0ec5d2cee7545e5ce18c015ce91957e ]
    
    The position reporting on Intel Skylake and later chips via
    azx_get_pos_skl() contains a udelay(20) call for the capture streams.
    A call for this alone doesn't sound too harmful.  However, as the
    pointer PCM ops is one of the hottest path in the PCM operations --
    especially for the timer-scheduled operations like PulseAudio -- such
    a delay hogs CPU usage significantly in the total performance.
    
    The code there was taken from the original code in ASoC SST Skylake
    driver blindly.  The udelay() is a workaround for the case where the
    reported position is behind the period boundary at the timing
    triggered from interrupts; applications often expect that the full
    data is available for the whole period when returned (and also that's
    the definition of the ALSA PCM period).
    
    OTOH, HD-audio (legacy) driver has already some workarounds for the
    delayed position reporting due to its relatively large FIFO, such as
    the BDL position adjustment and the delayed period-elapsed call in the
    work.  That said, the udelay() is almost superfluous for HD-audio
    driver unlike SST, and we can drop the udelay().
    
    Though, the current code doesn't guarantee the full period readiness
    as mentioned in the above, but rather it checks the wallclock and
    detects the unexpected jump.  That's one missing piece, and the drop
    of udelay() needs a bit more sanity checks for the delayed handling.
    
    This patch implements those: the drop of udelay() call in
    azx_get_pos_skl() and the more proper check of hwptr in
    azx_position_ok().  The latter change is applied only for the case
    where the stream is running in the normal mode without
    no_period_wakeup flag.  When no_period_wakeup is set, it essentially
    ignores the period handling and rather concentrates only on the
    current position; which implies that we don't need to care about the
    period boundary at all.

    iommu/dma: Fix arch_sync_dma for map
    
    [ Upstream commit 06e620345d544e559b2961cb5a676ec9c80c8950 ]
    
    When calling arch_sync_dma, we need to pass it the memory that's
    actually being used for dma. When using swiotlb bounce buffers, this is
    the bounce buffer. Move arch_sync_dma into the __iommu_dma_map_swiotlb
    helper, so it can use the bounce buffer address if necessary.
    
    Now that iommu_dma_map_sg delegates to a function which takes care of
    architectural syncing in the untrusted device case, the call to
    iommu_dma_sync_sg_for_device can be moved so it only occurs for trusted
    devices. Doing the sync for untrusted devices before mapping never
    really worked, since it needs to be able to target swiotlb buffers.
    
    This also moves the architectural sync to before the call to
    __iommu_dma_map, to guarantee that untrusted devices can't see stale
    data they shouldn't see.

    arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Fix Secondary MI2S bit clock
    
    [ Upstream commit 8199a0b31e76d158ac14841e7119890461f8c595 ]
    
    At the moment, playing audio on Secondary MI2S will just end up getting
    stuck, without actually playing any audio. This happens because the wrong
    bit clock is configured when playing audio on Secondary MI2S.
    
    The PRI_I2S_CLK (better name: SPKR_I2S_CLK) is used by the SPKR audio mux
    block that provides both Primary and Secondary MI2S.
    
    The SEC_I2S_CLK (better name: MIC_I2S_CLK) is used by the MIC audio mux
    block that provides Tertiary MI2S. Quaternary MI2S is also part of the
    MIC audio mux but has its own clock (AUX_I2S_CLK).
    
    This means that (quite confusingly) the SEC_I2S_CLK is not actually
    used for Secondary MI2S as the name would suggest. Secondary MI2S
    needs to have the same clock as Primary MI2S configured.
    
    Fix the clock list for the lpass node in the device tree and add
    a comment to clarify this confusing naming. With these changes,
    audio can be played correctly on Secondary MI2S.

    arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Base dynamic CPU power coefficients in reality
    
    [ Upstream commit 82ea7d411d43f60dce878252558e926f957109f0 ]
    
    The sc7180's dynamic-power-coefficient violates the device tree bindings.
    The bindings (arm/cpus.yaml) say that the units for the
    dynamic-power-coefficient are supposed to be "uW/MHz/V^2". The ones for
    sc7180 aren't this. Qualcomm arbitrarily picked 100 for the "little" CPUs
    and then picked a number for the big CPU based on this.
    
    At the time, there was a giant dicussion about this. Apparently Qualcomm
    Engineers were instructed not to share the actual numbers here. As part
    of the discussion, I pointed out [1] that these numbers shouldn't really
    be secret since once a device is shipping anyone can just run a script
    and produce them. This patch is the result of running the script I posted
    in that discussion on sc7180-trogdor-coachz, which is currently available
    for purchase by consumers.
    
    [1] https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAD=FV=U1FP0e3_AVHpauUUZtD-5X3XCwh5aT9fH_8S_FFML2Uw@mail.gmail.com/
    
    I ran the script four times, measuring little, big, little, big. I used
    the 64-bit version of dhrystone 2.2 in my test. I got these results:
    
    576 kHz, 596 mV, 20 mW, 88 Cx

    2323 kHz, 940 mV, 1063 mW, 520 Cx
    2400 kHz, 956 mV, 1135 mW, 519 Cx
    Your dynamic-power-coefficient for cpu 6: 489
    
    As you can see, the calculations aren't perfectly consistent but
    roughly you could say about 480 for big and 137 for little.
    
    The ratio between these numbers isn't quite the same as the ratio
    between the two numbers that Qualcomm used. Perhaps this is because
    Qualcomm measured something slightly different than the 64-bit version
    of dhrystone 2.2 or perhaps it's because they fudged these numbers a
    bit (and fudged the capacity-dmips-mhz). As per discussion [2], let's
    use the numbers I came up with and also un-fudge
    capacity-dmips-mhz. While unfudging capacity-dmips-mhz, let's scale it
    so that bigs are 1024 which seems to be the common practice.
    
    In general these numbers don't need to be perfectly exact. In fact,
    they can't be since the CPU power depends a lot on what's being run on
    the CPU and the big/little CPUs are each more or less efficient in
    different operations. Historically running the 32-bit vs. 64-bit
    versions of dhrystone produced notably different numbers, though I
    didn't test this time.
    
    We also need to scale all of the sustainable-power numbers by the same
    amount. I scale ones related to the big CPUs by the adjustment I made
    to the big dynamic-power-coefficient and the ones related to the
    little CPUs by the adjustment I made to the little
    dynamic-power-coefficient.

    On resume we can get a warning at kernel/time/timekeeping.c:824 for
    timekeeping_suspended.
    
    Let's fix this by adding separate functions for sysc_poll_reset_sysstatus()
    and sysc_poll_reset_sysconfig() and have the new functions handle also
    timekeeping_suspended.
    
    If iopoll at some point supports timekeeping_suspended, we can just drop
    the custom handling from these functions.

    scsi: pm80xx: Fix lockup in outbound queue management
    
    [ Upstream commit b27a40534ef76a22628a5c12f98ea489823a8ba5 ]
    
    Commit 1f02beff224e ("scsi: pm80xx: Remove global lock from outbound queue
    processing") introduced a lock per outbound queue. Prior to that change the
    driver was using a global lock for all outbound queues.
    
    While processing the I/O responses and events the driver takes the outbound
    queue spinlock and is supposed to release it in pm8001_ccb_task_free_done()
    before calling command done(). Since the older code was using a global
    lock, pm8001_ccb_task_free_done() was releasing the global spin lock. The
    change that split the lock per outbound queue did not consider this and
    pm8001_ccb_task_free_done() was still releasing the global lock.

    iio: st_sensors: disable regulators after device unregistration
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f0b3e0cc0c88618aa9e5cecef747b1337ae0a5d ]
    
    Up until commit ea7e586bdd331 ("iio: st_sensors: move regulator retrieveal
    to core") only the ST pressure driver seems to have had any regulator
    disable. After that commit, the regulator handling was moved into the
    common st_sensors logic.
    
    In all instances of this regulator handling, the regulators were disabled
    before unregistering the IIO device.
    This can cause issues where the device would be powered down and still be
    available to userspace, allowing it to send invalid/garbage data.
    
    This change moves the st_sensors_power_disable() after the common probe
    functions. These common probe functions also handle unregistering the IIO
    device.

    bpf: Fix propagation of bounds from 64-bit min/max into 32-bit and var_off.
    
    [ Upstream commit b9979db8340154526d9ab38a1883d6f6ba9b6d47 ]
    
    Before this fix:
    166: (b5) if r2 <= 0x1 goto pc+22
    from 166 to 189: R2=invP(id=1,umax_value=1,var_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff))
    
    After this fix:
    166: (b5) if r2 <= 0x1 goto pc+22
    from 166 to 189: R2=invP(id=1,umax_value=1,var_off=(0x0; 0x1))
    
    While processing BPF_JLE the reg_set_min_max() would set true_reg->umax_value = 1
    and call __reg_combine_64_into_32(true_reg).
    
    Without the fix it would not pass the condition:
    if (__reg64_bound_u32(reg->umin_value) && __reg64_bound_u32(reg->umax_value))
    
    since umin_value == 0 at this point.

    skmsg: Lose offset info in sk_psock_skb_ingress

    If sockmap enable strparser, there are lose offset info in

    skb->len, the skb will be converted to sk_msg multiple times, and userspace
    app will get the data multiple times.

    add one bit in skb->_sk_redir to distinguish enable or disable strparser.

    ibmvnic: delay complete()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b278c0cb378079f3c0c61ae4a369c09ff1a4188 ]
    
    If we get CRQ_INIT, we set errno to -EIO and first call complete() to
    notify the waiter. Then we try to schedule a FAILOVER reset. If this
    occurs while adapter is in PROBING state, ibmvnic_reset() changes the
    error code to EAGAIN and returns without scheduling the FAILOVER. The
    purpose of setting error code to EAGAIN is to ask the waiter to retry.
    
    But due to the earlier complete() call, the waiter may already have seen
    the -EIO response and decided not to retry. This can cause intermittent
    failures when bringing up ibmvnic adapters during boot, specially in
    in kexec/kdump kernels.
    
    Defer the complete() call until after scheduling the reset.
    
    Also streamline the error code to EAGAIN. Don't see why we need EIO
    sometimes. All 3 callers of ibmvnic_reset_init() can handle EAGAIN.

    ibmvnic: don't stop queue in xmit
    
    [ Upstream commit 8878e46fcfd46b19964bd90e13b25dd94cbfc9be ]
    
    If adapter's resetting bit is on, discard the packet but don't stop the
    transmit queue - instead leave that to the reset code. With this change,
    it is possible that we may get several calls to ibmvnic_xmit() that simply
    discard packets and return.
    
    But if we stop the queue here, we might end up doing so just after
    __ibmvnic_open() started the queues (during a hard/soft reset) and before
    the ->resetting bit was cleared. If that happens, there will be no one to
    restart queue and transmissions will be blocked indefinitely.
    
    This can cause a TIMEOUT reset and with auto priority failover enabled,
    an unnecessary FAILOVER reset to less favored backing device and then a
    FAILOVER back to the most favored backing device. If we hit the window
    repeatedly, we can get stuck in a loop of TIMEOUT, FAILOVER, FAILOVER
    resets leaving the adapter unusable for extended periods of time.

    crypto: pcrypt - Delay write to padata->info
    
    [ Upstream commit 68b6dea802cea0dbdd8bd7ccc60716b5a32a5d8a ]
    
    These three events can race when pcrypt is used multiple times in a
    template ("pcrypt(pcrypt(...))"):
    
      1.  [taskA] The caller makes the crypto request via crypto_aead_encrypt()
      2.  [kworkerB] padata serializes the inner pcrypt request
      3.  [kworkerC] padata serializes the outer pcrypt request
    
    3 might finish before the call to crypto_aead_encrypt() returns in 1,
    resulting in two possible issues.
    
    First, a use-after-free of the crypto request's memory when, for
    example, taskA writes to the outer pcrypt request's padata->info in
    pcrypt_aead_enc() after kworkerC completes the request.
    
    Second, the outer pcrypt request overwrites the inner pcrypt request's
    return code with -EINPROGRESS, making a successful request appear to
    fail.  For instance, kworkerB writes the outer pcrypt request's
    padata->info in pcrypt_aead_done() and then taskA overwrites it
    in pcrypt_aead_enc().
    
    Avoid both situations by delaying the write of padata->info until after
    the inner crypto request's return code is checked.  This prevents the
    use-after-free by not touching the crypto request's memory after the
    next-inner crypto request is made, and stops padata->info from being
    overwritten.

    [ Upstream commit fd8d9731bcdfb22d28e45bce789bcb211c868c78 ]
    
    mvneta does not support asymetric pause modes, and it flags this by the
    lack of AsymPause in the supported field. When setting pause modes, we
    check that pause->rx_pause == pause->tx_pause, but only when pause
    autoneg is enabled. When pause autoneg is disabled, we still allow
    pause->rx_pause != pause->tx_pause, which is incorrect when the MAC
    does not support asymetric pause, and causes mvneta to issue a warning.
    
    Fix this by removing the test for pause->autoneg, so we always check
    that pause->rx_pause == pause->tx_pause for network devices that do not
    support AsymPause.

    sctp: allow IP fragmentation when PLPMTUD enters Error state
    
    [ Upstream commit 40171248bb8934537fec8fbaf718e57c8add187c ]
    
    Currently when PLPMTUD enters Error state, transport pathmtu will be set
    to MIN_PLPMTU(512) while probe is continuing with BASE_PLPMTU(1200). It
    will cause pathmtu to stay in a very small value, even if the real pmtu
    is some value like 1000.
    
    RFC8899 doesn't clearly say how to set the value in Error state. But one
    possibility could be keep using BASE_PLPMTU for the real pmtu, but allow
    to do IP fragmentation when it's in Error state.
    
    As it says in rfc8899#section-5.4:
    
       Some paths could be unable to sustain packets of the BASE_PLPMTU
       size.  The Error State could be implemented to provide robustness to
       such paths.  This allows fallback to a smaller than desired PLPMTU
       rather than suffer connectivity failure.  This could utilize methods
       such as endpoint IP fragmentation to enable the PL sender to
       communicate using packets smaller than the BASE_PLPMTU.
    
    This patch is to set pmtu to BASE_PLPMTU instead of MIN_PLPMTU for Error
    state in sctp_transport_pl_send/toobig(), and set packet ipfragok for
    non-probe packets when it's in Error state.

    Similar to the fix in commit:

    We use designated initializer to set fds to -1 without breaking on
    future changes to MAX_SERVER constant denoting the array size.
    
    The particular close(0) occurs on non-reuseport tests, so it can be seen
    with -n 115/{2,3} but not 115/4. This can cause problems with future
    tests if they depend on BTF fd never being acquired as fd 0, breaking
    internal libbpf assumptions.

    The channel scan list must be updated before triggering a hardware scan
    so that firmware takes into account the regulatory info for each single
    channel such as active/passive config, power, DFS, etc... Without this
    the firmware uses its own internal default channel configuration, which
    is not aligned with mac80211 regulatory rules, and misses several
    channels (e.g. 144).

    wcn36xx: Fix discarded frames due to wrong sequence number
    
    [ Upstream commit 113f304dbc1627c6ec9d5329d839964095768980 ]
    
    The firmware is offering features such as ARP offload, for which
    firmware crafts its own (QoS)packets without waking up the host.
    Point is that the sequence numbers generated by the firmware are
    not in sync with the host mac80211 layer and can cause packets
    such as firmware ARP reponses to be dropped by the AP (too old SN).
    
    To fix this we need to let the firmware manages the sequence
    numbers by its own (except for QoS null frames). There is a SN
    counter for each QoS queue and one global/baseline counter for
    Non-QoS.

    wcn36xx: add proper DMA memory barriers in rx path
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bfe38e064af5decba2ffce66a2958ab8b10eaa4 ]
    
    This is essentially exactly following the dma_wmb()/dma_rmb() usage
    instructions in Documentation/memory-barriers.txt.
    
    The theoretical races here are:
    
    1. DXE (the DMA Transfer Engine in the Wi-Fi subsystem) seeing the
    dxe->ctrl & WCN36xx_DXE_CTRL_VLD write before the dxe->dst_addr_l
    write, thus performing DMA into the wrong address.
    
    2. CPU reading dxe->dst_addr_l before DXE unsets dxe->ctrl &
    WCN36xx_DXE_CTRL_VLD. This should generally be harmless since DXE
    doesn't write dxe->dst_addr_l (no risk of freeing the wrong skb).

    If handle_sske cannot set the storage key, because there is no

    fixup_user_fault.
    However, currently, if the call succeeds, handle_sske returns
    -EAGAIN, without having set the storage key.
    Instead, retry by continue'ing the loop without incrementing the
    address.

    tcp: don't free a FIN sk_buff in tcp_remove_empty_skb()
    
    [ Upstream commit cf12e6f9124629b18a6182deefc0315f0a73a199 ]
    
    v1: Implement a more general statement as recommended by Eric Dumazet. The
    sequence number will be advanced, so this check will fix the FIN case and
    other cases.
    
    A customer reported sockets stuck in the CLOSING state. A Vmcore revealed that
    the write_queue was not empty as determined by tcp_write_queue_empty() but the
    sk_buff containing the FIN flag had been freed and the socket was zombied in
    that state. Corresponding pcaps show no FIN from the Linux kernel on the wire.
    
    Some instrumentation was added to the kernel and it was found that there is a
    timing window where tcp_sendmsg() can run after tcp_send_fin().
    
    tcp_sendmsg() will hit an error, for example:
    
    1269 ▹       if (sk->sk_err || (sk->sk_shutdown & SEND_SHUTDOWN))↩
    1270 ▹       ▹       goto do_error;↩
    
    tcp_remove_empty_skb() will then free the FIN sk_buff as "skb->len == 0". The
    TCP socket is now wedged in the FIN-WAIT-1 state because the FIN is never sent.
    
    If the other side sends a FIN packet the socket will transition to CLOSING and
    remain that way until the system is rebooted.
    
    Fix this by checking for the FIN flag in the sk_buff and don't free it if that
    is the case. Testing confirmed that fixed the issue.

    In commit c46ed2281bbe ("tpm_tis_spi: add missing SPI device ID entries")
    we added SPI IDs for all the DT aliases to handle the fact that we always
    use SPI modaliases to load modules even when probed via DT however the
    mentioned commit missed that the SPI and OF device ID entries did not
    match and were different and so DT nodes with compatible
    "tcg,tpm_tis-spi" will not match.  Add an extra ID for tpm_tis-spi
    rather than just fix the existing one since what's currently there is
    going to be better for anyone actually using SPI IDs to instantiate.

    tpm: fix Atmel TPM crash caused by too frequent queries
    
    [ Upstream commit 79ca6f74dae067681a779fd573c2eb59649989bc ]
    
    The Atmel TPM 1.2 chips crash with error
    `tpm_try_transmit: send(): error -62` since kernel 4.14.
    It is observed from the kernel log after running `tpm_sealdata -z`.
    The error thrown from the command is as follows
    ```
    $ tpm_sealdata -z
    Tspi_Key_LoadKey failed: 0x00001087 - layer=tddl,
    code=0087 (135), I/O error
    ```
    
    The issue was reproduced with the following Atmel TPM chip:
    ```
    $ tpm_version
    T0  TPM 1.2 Version Info:
      Chip Version:        1.2.66.1
      Spec Level:          2
      Errata Revision:     3
      TPM Vendor ID:       ATML
      TPM Version:         01010000
      Manufacturer Info:   41544d4c
    ```
    
    The root cause of the issue is due to the TPM calls to msleep()
    were replaced with usleep_range() [1], which reduces
    the actual timeout. Via experiments, it is observed that
    the original msleep(5) actually sleeps for 15ms.
    Because of a known timeout issue in Atmel TPM 1.2 chip,
    the shorter timeout than 15ms can cause the error described above.
    
    A few further changes in kernel 4.16 [2] and 4.18 [3, 4] further
    reduced the timeout to less than 1ms. With experiments,
    the problematic timeout in the latest kernel is the one
    for `wait_for_tpm_stat`.
    
    To fix it, the patch reverts the timeout of `wait_for_tpm_stat`
    to 15ms for all Atmel TPM 1.2 chips, but leave it untouched
    for Ateml TPM 2.0 chip, and chips from other vendors.
    As explained above, the chosen 15ms timeout is
    the actual timeout before this issue introduced,
    thus the old value is used here.
    Particularly, TPM_ATML_TIMEOUT_WAIT_STAT_MIN is set to 14700us,
    TPM_ATML_TIMEOUT_WAIT_STAT_MIN is set to 15000us according to
    the existing TPM_TIMEOUT_RANGE_US (300us).
    The fixed has been tested in the system with the affected Atmel chip
    with no issues observed after boot up.

    block: ataflop: more blk-mq refactoring fixes
    
    [ Upstream commit d28e4dff085c5a87025c9a0a85fb798bd8e9ca17 ]
    
    As it turns out, my earlier patch in commit 86d46fdaa12a (block:
    ataflop: fix breakage introduced at blk-mq refactoring) was
    incomplete. This patch fixes any remaining issues found during
    more testing and code review.
    
    Requests exceeding 4 k are handled in 4k segments but
    __blk_mq_end_request() is never called on these (still
    sectors outstanding on the request). With redo_fd_request()
    removed, there is no provision to kick off processing of the
    next segment, causing requests exceeding 4k to hang. (By
    setting /sys/block/fd0/queue/max_sectors_k <= 4 as workaround,
    this behaviour can be avoided).
    
    Instead of reintroducing redo_fd_request(), requeue the remainder
    of the request by calling blk_mq_requeue_request() on incomplete
    requests (i.e. when blk_update_request() still returns true), and
    rely on the block layer to queue the residual as new request.
    
    Both error handling and formatting needs to release the
    ST-DMA lock, so call finish_fdc() on these (this was previously
    handled by redo_fd_request()). finish_fdc() may be called
    legitimately without the ST-DMA lock held - make sure we only
    release the lock if we actually held it. In a similar way,
    early exit due to errors in ataflop_queue_rq() must release
    the lock.
    
    After minor errors, fd_error sets up to recalibrate the drive
    but never re-runs the current operation (another task handled by
    redo_fd_request() before). Call do_fd_action() to get the next
    steps (seek, retry read/write) underway.

    ath10k: fix module load regression with iram-recovery feature
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f8c8bf4c7c9be1c42088689fd4370e06b46608a ]
    
    Commit 9af7c32ceca8 ("ath10k: add target IRAM recovery feature support")
    introduced a new firmware feature flag ATH10K_FW_FEATURE_IRAM_RECOVERY. But
    this caused ath10k_pci module load to fail if ATH10K_FW_CRASH_DUMP_RAM_DATA bit
    was not enabled in the ath10k coredump_mask module parameter:
    
    [ 2209.328190] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: qca9984/qca9994 hw1.0 target 0x01000000 chip_id 0x00000000 sub 168c:cafe

    [ 2213.933910] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: could not probe fw (-12)
    
    And by default coredump_mask does not have ATH10K_FW_CRASH_DUMP_RAM_DATA
    enabled so anyone using a firmware with iram-recovery feature would fail. To my
    knowledge only QCA9984 firmwares starting from release 10.4-3.9.0.2-00099
    enabled the feature.
    
    The reason for regression was that ath10k_core_copy_target_iram() used
    ath10k_coredump_get_mem_layout() to get the memory layout, but when
    ATH10K_FW_CRASH_DUMP_RAM_DATA was disabled it would get just NULL and bail out
    with an error.
    
    While looking at all this I noticed another bug: if CONFIG_DEV_COREDUMP is
    disabled but the firmware has iram-recovery enabled the module load fails with
    similar error messages. I fixed that by returning 0 from
    ath10k_core_copy_target_iram() when _ath10k_coredump_get_mem_layout() returns
    NULL.
    
    Tested-on: QCA9984 hw2.0 PCI 10.4-3.9.0.2-00139

    However, the way in which we do this is suspicious to the checker in
    lib/refcount.c, who thinks it is buggy to increment a refcount that
    became zero, and that this is indicative of a use-after-free.

    irq: mips: avoid nested irq_enter()
    
    [ Upstream commit c65b52d02f6c1a06ddb20cba175ad49eccd6410d ]
    
    As bcm6345_l1_irq_handle() is a chained irqchip handler, it will be
    invoked within the context of the root irqchip handler, which must have
    entered IRQ context already.
    
    When bcm6345_l1_irq_handle() calls arch/mips's do_IRQ() , this will nest
    another call to irq_enter(), and the resulting nested increment to
    `rcu_data.dynticks_nmi_nesting` will cause rcu_is_cpu_rrupt_from_idle()
    to fail to identify wakeups from idle, resulting in failure to preempt,
    and RCU stalls.
    
    Chained irqchip handlers must invoke IRQ handlers by way of thee core
    irqchip code, i.e. generic_handle_irq() or generic_handle_domain_irq()
    and should not call do_IRQ(), which is intended only for root irqchip
    handlers.
    
    Fix bcm6345_l1_irq_handle() by calling generic_handle_irq() directly.

    [ Upstream commit d4074324b07a94a1fca476d452dfbb3a4e7bf656 ]
    
    If kvm_s390_pv_destroy_cpu is called more than once, we risk calling
    free_page on a random page, since the sidad field is aliased with the
    gbea, which is not guaranteed to be zero.
    
    This can happen, for example, if userspace calls the KVM_PV_DISABLE
    IOCTL, and it fails, and then userspace calls the same IOCTL again.
    This scenario is only possible if KVM has some serious bug or if the
    hardware is broken.
    
    The solution is to simply return successfully immediately if the vCPU
    was already non secure.

    s390/mm: fix VMA and page table handling code in storage key handling functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 949f5c1244ee6c36d2e81c588d1200eaa83a3df6 ]
    
    There are multiple things broken about our storage key handling
    functions:
    
    1. We should not walk/touch page tables outside of VMA boundaries when
       holding only the mmap sem in read mode. Evil user space can modify the
       VMA layout just before this function runs and e.g., trigger races with
       page table removal code since commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages
       with read mmap_sem in munmap"). gfn_to_hva() will only translate using
       KVM memory regions, but won't validate the VMA.
    
    2. We should not allocate page tables outside of VMA boundaries: if
       evil user space decides to map hugetlbfs to these ranges, bad things
       will happen because we suddenly have PTE or PMD page tables where we
       shouldn't have them.
    
    3. We don't handle large PUDs that might suddenly appeared inside our page
       table hierarchy.
    
    Don't manually allocate page tables, properly validate that we have VMA and
    bail out on pud_large().
    
    All callers of page table handling functions, except
    get_guest_storage_key(), call fixup_user_fault() in case they
    receive an -EFAULT and retry; this will allocate the necessary page tables
    if required.
    
    To keep get_guest_storage_key() working as expected and not requiring
    kvm_s390_get_skeys() to call fixup_user_fault() distinguish between
    "there is simply no page table or huge page yet and the key is assumed
    to be 0" and "this is a fault to be reported".
    
    Although commit 637ff9efe5ea ("s390/mm: Add huge pmd storage key handling")
    introduced most of the affected code, it was actually already broken
    before when using get_locked_pte() without any VMA checks.
    
    Note: Ever since commit 637ff9efe5ea ("s390/mm: Add huge pmd storage key
    handling") we can no longer set a guest storage key (for example from
    QEMU during VM live migration) without actually resolving a fault.
    Although we would have created most page tables, we would choke on the
    !pmd_present(), requiring a call to fixup_user_fault(). I would
    have thought that this is problematic in combination with postcopy life
    migration ... but nobody noticed and this patch doesn't change the
    situation. So maybe it's just fine.

    [ Upstream commit b159f94c86b43cf7e73e654bc527255b1f4eafc4 ]
    
    ... otherwise we will try unlocking a spinlock that was never locked via a
    garbage pointer.
    
    At the time we reach this code path, we usually successfully looked up
    a PGSTE already; however, evil user space could have manipulated the VMA
    layout in the meantime and triggered removal of the page table.

    s390/gmap: validate VMA in __gmap_zap()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d8fb8f3914b40e3cc12f8cbb74daefd5245349d ]
    
    We should not walk/touch page tables outside of VMA boundaries when
    holding only the mmap sem in read mode. Evil user space can modify the
    VMA layout just before this function runs and e.g., trigger races with
    page table removal code since commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages
    with read mmap_sem in munmap"). The pure prescence in our guest_to_host
    radix tree does not imply that there is a VMA.
    
    Further, we should not allocate page tables (via get_locked_pte()) outside
    of VMA boundaries: if evil user space decides to map hugetlbfs to these
    ranges, bad things will happen because we suddenly have PTE or PMD page
    tables where we shouldn't have them.
    
    Similarly, we have to check if we suddenly find a hugetlbfs VMA, before
    calling get_locked_pte().
    
    Note that gmap_discard() is different:
    zap_page_range()->unmap_single_vma() makes sure to stay within VMA
    boundaries.

    mt76: mt7615: mt7622: fix ibss and meshpoint
    
    [ Upstream commit 753453afacc0243bd45de45e34218a8d17493e8f ]
    
    commit 7f4b7920318b ("mt76: mt7615: add ibss support") introduced IBSS
    and commit f4ec7fdf7f83 ("mt76: mt7615: enable support for mesh")
    meshpoint support.
    
    Both used in the "get_omac_idx"-function:
    
            if (~mask & BIT(HW_BSSID_0))
                    return HW_BSSID_0;
    
    With commit d8d59f66d136 ("mt76: mt7615: support 16 interfaces") the
    ibss and meshpoint mode should "prefer hw bssid slot 1-3". However,
    with that change the ibss or meshpoint mode will not send any beacon on
    the mt7622 wifi anymore. Devices were still able to exchange data but
    only if a bssid already existed. Two mt7622 devices will never be able
    to communicate.
    
    This commits reverts the preferation of slot 1-3 for ibss and
    meshpoint. Only NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION will still prefer slot 1-3.
    
    Tested on Banana Pi R64.

    is freed if any metadata has been found and printed, but it leaks

    writer is created only after we have found program metadata to print.

    KVM: selftests: Fix nested SVM tests when built with clang
    
    [ Upstream commit ed290e1c20da19fa100a3e0f421aa31b65984960 ]
    
    Though gcc conveniently compiles a simple memset to "rep stos," clang
    prefers to call the libc version of memset. If a test is dynamically
    linked, the libc memset isn't available in L1 (nor is the PLT or the
    GOT, for that matter). Even if the test is statically linked, the libc
    memset may choose to use some CPU features, like AVX, which may not be
    enabled in L1. Note that __builtin_memset doesn't solve the problem,
    because (a) the compiler is free to call memset anyway, and (b)
    __builtin_memset may also choose to use features like AVX, which may
    not be available in L1.
    
    To avoid a myriad of problems, use an explicit "rep stos" to clear the
    VMCB in generic_svm_setup(), which is called both from L0 and L1.

    PM: hibernate: fix sparse warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit 01de5fcd8b1ac0ca28d2bb0921226a54fdd62684 ]
    
    When building the kernel with sparse enabled 'C=1' the following
    warnings shows up:
    
    kernel/power/swap.c:390:29: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
    kernel/power/swap.c:390:29:    expected int ret
    kernel/power/swap.c:390:29:    got restricted blk_status_t
    
    This is due to function hib_wait_io() returns a 'blk_status_t' which is
    a bitwise u8. Commit 5416da01ff6e ("PM: hibernate: Remove
    blk_status_to_errno in hib_wait_io") seemed to have mixed up the return
    type. However, the 4e4cbee93d56 ("block: switch bios to blk_status_t")
    actually broke the behaviour by returning the wrong type.
    
    Rework so function hib_wait_io() returns a 'int' instead of
    'blk_status_t' and make sure to call function
    blk_status_to_errno(hb->error)' when returning from function
    hib_wait_io() a int gets returned.

    Reproduce this issue as follows:

    2. nbd-client localhost 8000 /dev/nbd1
    3. cat /sys/block/nbd1/pid
    Then trigger use-after-free in pid_show.
    
    Reason is after do step '2', nbd-client progress is already exit. So
    it's task_struct already freed.
    To solve this issue, revert part of 6521d39a64b3's modify and remove
    useless 'recv_task' member of nbd_device.

    phy: micrel: ksz8041nl: do not use power down mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 2641b62d2fab52648e34cdc6994b2eacde2d27c1 ]
    
    Some Micrel KSZ8041NL PHY chips exhibit continuous RX errors after using
    the power down mode bit (0.11). If the PHY is taken out of power down
    mode in a certain temperature range, the PHY enters a weird state which
    leads to continuously reporting RX errors. In that state, the MAC is not
    able to receive or send any Ethernet frames and the activity LED is
    constantly blinking. Since Linux is using the suspend callback when the
    interface is taken down, ending up in that state can easily happen
    during a normal startup.
    
    Micrel confirmed the issue in errata DS80000700A [*], caused by abnormal
    clock recovery when using power down mode. Even the latest revision (A4,
    Revision ID 0x1513) seems to suffer that problem, and according to the
    errata is not going to be fixed.
    
    Remove the suspend/resume callback to avoid using the power down mode
    completely.

    net: enetc: unmap DMA in enetc_send_cmd()
    
    [ Upstream commit cd4bc63de774eee95e9bac26a565cd80e0fca421 ]
    
    Coverity complains of a possible dereference of a null return value.
    
            5. returned_null: kzalloc returns NULL. [show details]
            6. var_assigned: Assigning: si_data = NULL return value from kzalloc.
    488        si_data = kzalloc(data_size, __GFP_DMA | GFP_KERNEL);
    489        cbd.length = cpu_to_le16(data_size);
    490
    491        dma = dma_map_single(&priv->si->pdev->dev, si_data,
    492                             data_size, DMA_FROM_DEVICE);
    
    While this kzalloc() is unlikely to fail, I did notice that the function
    returned without unmapping si_data.
    
    Fix this by refactoring the error paths and checking for kzalloc()
    failure.

    setting the initiator bit when sending DELBA requests to the AP: While
    we set the bit on our del_ba_param_set bitmask, we forget to actually
    copy that bitmask over to the command struct, which means we never
    actually set the initiator bit.
    
    Fix that and copy the bitmask over to the host_cmd_ds_11n_delba command
    struct.

    [ Upstream commit 781f62960c635cfed55a8f8c0f909bdaf8268257 ]
    
    Update the proper firmware programming sequence to fix GTK rekey
    offload failure on WPA mixed mode.
    
    In the mt76_connac_mcu_key_iter,
    gtk_tlv->proto should be only set up on pairwise key
    and gtk_tlk->group_cipher should be only set up on the group key.
    
    Otherwise, those parameters required by firmware would be set
    incorrectly to cause GTK rekey offload failure on WPA mixed mode
    and then disconnection follows.

    ACPI: PM: Fix sharing of wakeup power resources
    
    [ Upstream commit a2d7b2e004af6b09f21ac3d10f8f4456c16a8ddf ]
    
    If an ACPI wakeup power resource is shared between multiple devices,
    it may not be managed correctly.
    
    Suppose, for example, that two devices, A and B, share a wakeup power
    resource P whose wakeup_enabled flag is 0 initially.  Next, suppose
    that wakeup power is enabled for A and B, in this order, and disabled
    for B.  When wakeup power is enabled for A, P will be turned on and
    its wakeup_enabled flag will be set.  Next, when wakeup power is
    enabled for B, P will not be touched, because its wakeup_enabled flag
    is set.  Now, when wakeup power is disabled for B, P will be turned
    off which is incorrect, because A will still need P in order to signal
    wakeup.
    
    Moreover, if wakeup power is enabled for A and then disabled for B,
    the latter will cause P to be turned off incorrectly (it will be still
    needed by A), because acpi_disable_wakeup_device_power() is allowed
    to manipulate power resources when the wakeup.prepare_count counter
    of the given device is 0.
    
    While the first issue could be addressed by changing the
    wakeup_enabled power resource flag into a counter, addressing the
    second one requires modifying acpi_disable_wakeup_device_power() to
    do nothing when the target device's wakeup.prepare_count reference
    counter is zero and that would cause the new counter to be redundant.
    Namely, if acpi_disable_wakeup_device_power() is modified as per the
    above, every change of the new counter following a wakeup.prepare_count
    change would be reflected by the analogous change of the main reference
    counter of the given power resource.
    
    Accordingly, modify acpi_disable_wakeup_device_power() to do nothing
    when the target device's wakeup.prepare_count reference counter is
    zero and drop the power resource wakeup_enabled flag altogether.
    
    While at it, ensure that all of the power resources that can be
    turned off will be turned off when disabling device wakeup due to
    a power resource manipulation error, to prevent energy from being
    wasted.

    ACPI: PM: Turn off unused wakeup power resources
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a63296d6f579a02b2675b4b0fe5b1cd3235e8d3 ]
    
    If an ACPI power resource is found to be "on" during the
    initialization of the list of wakeup power resources of a device,
    it is reference counted and its wakeup_enabled flag is set, which is
    problematic if the deivce in question is the only user of the given
    power resource, it is never runtime-suspended and it is not allowed
    to wake up the system from sleep, because in that case the given
    power resource will stay "on" until the system reboots and energy
    will be wasted.
    
    It is better to simply turn off wakeup power resources that are "on"
    during the initialization unless their reference counters are not
    zero, because that may be the only opportunity to prevent them from
    staying in the "on" state all the time.

    block: ataflop: fix breakage introduced at blk-mq refactoring
    
    [ Upstream commit 86d46fdaa12ae5befc16b8d73fc85a3ca0399ea6 ]
    
    Refactoring of the Atari floppy driver when converting to blk-mq
    has broken the state machine in not-so-subtle ways:
    
    finish_fdc() must be called when operations on the floppy device
    have completed. This is crucial in order to relase the ST-DMA
    lock, which protects against concurrent access to the ST-DMA
    controller by other drivers (some DMA related, most just related
    to device register access - broken beyond compare, I know).
    
    When rewriting the driver's old do_request() function, the fact
    that finish_fdc() was called only when all queued requests had
    completed appears to have been overlooked. Instead, the new
    request function calls finish_fdc() immediately after the last
    request has been queued. finish_fdc() executes a dummy seek after
    most requests, and this overwrites the state machine's interrupt
    hander that was set up to wait for completion of the read/write
    request just prior. To make matters worse, finish_fdc() is called
    before device interrupts are re-enabled, making certain that the
    read/write interupt is missed.
    
    Shifting the finish_fdc() call into the read/write request
    completion handler ensures the driver waits for the request to
    actually complete. With a queue depth of 2, we won't see long
    request sequences, so calling finish_fdc() unconditionally just
    adds a little overhead for the dummy seeks, and keeps the code
    simple.
    
    While we're at it, kill ataflop_commit_rqs() which does nothing
    but run finish_fdc() unconditionally, again likely wiping out an
    in-flight request.

    net: stream: don't purge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()
    
    [ Upstream commit 24bcbe1cc69fa52dc4f7b5b2456678ed464724d8 ]
    
    sk_stream_kill_queues() can be called on close when there are
    still outstanding skbs to transmit. Those skbs may try to queue
    notifications to the error queue (e.g. timestamps).
    If sk_stream_kill_queues() purges the queue without taking
    its lock the queue may get corrupted, and skbs leaked.
    
    This shows up as a warning about an rmem leak:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 24 PID: 0 at net/ipv4/af_inet.c:154 inet_sock_destruct+0x...
    
    The leak is always a multiple of 0x300 bytes (the value is in
    %rax on my builds, so RAX: 0000000000000300). 0x300 is truesize of
    an empty sk_buff. Indeed if we dump the socket state at the time
    of the warning the sk_error_queue is often (but not always)
    corrupted. The ->next pointer points back at the list head,
    but not the ->prev pointer. Indeed we can find the leaked skb
    by scanning the kernel memory for something that looks like
    an skb with ->sk = socket in question, and ->truesize = 0x300.
    The contents of ->cb[] of the skb confirms the suspicion that
    it is indeed a timestamp notification (as generated in
    __skb_complete_tx_timestamp()).
    
    Removing purging of sk_error_queue should be okay, since
    inet_sock_destruct() does it again once all socket refs
    are gone. Eric suggests this may cause sockets that go
    thru disconnect() to maintain notifications from the
    previous incarnations of the socket, but that should be
    okay since the race was there anyway, and disconnect()
    is not exactly dependable.
    
    Thanks to Jonathan Lemon and Omar Sandoval for help at various
    stages of tracing the issue.

    drm/msm: uninitialized variable in msm_gem_import()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2203bd0e5c12ffc53ffdd4fbd7b12d6ba27e0424 ]
    
    The msm_gem_new_impl() function cleans up after itself so there is no
    need to call drm_gem_object_put().  Conceptually, it does not make sense
    to call a kref_put() function until after the reference counting has
    been initialized which happens immediately after this call in the
    drm_gem_(private_)object_init() functions.
    
    In the msm_gem_import() function the "obj" pointer is uninitialized, so
    it will lead to a crash.

    When device_register() return failed, program will goto out_kfree_type
    to release 'cdev->device' by put_device(). That will call thermal_release()

    tcp: switch orphan_count to bare per-cpu counters
    
    [ Upstream commit 19757cebf0c5016a1f36f7fe9810a9f0b33c0832 ]
    
    Use of percpu_counter structure to track count of orphaned
    sockets is causing problems on modern hosts with 256 cpus
    or more.
    
    Stefan Bach reported a serious spinlock contention in real workloads,
    that I was able to reproduce with a netfilter rule dropping
    incoming FIN packets.

    As explained in commit cf86a086a180 ("net/dst: use a smaller percpu_counter
    batch for dst entries accounting"), default batch size is too big
    for the default value of tcp_max_orphans (262144).
    
    But even if we reduce batch sizes, there would still be cases
    where the estimated count of orphans is beyond the limit,
    and where tcp_too_many_orphans() has to call the expensive
    percpu_counter_sum_positive().
    
    One solution is to use plain per-cpu counters, and have
    a timer to periodically refresh this cache.
    
    Updating this cache every 100ms seems about right, tcp pressure
    state is not radically changing over shorter periods.
    
    percpu_counter was nice 15 years ago while hosts had less
    than 16 cpus, not anymore by current standards.

    x86: Fix get_wchan() to support the ORC unwinder
    
    [ Upstream commit bc9bbb81730ea667c31c5b284f95ee312bab466f ]
    
    Currently, the kernel CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC option is enabled by default
    on x86, but the implementation of get_wchan() is still based on the frame
    pointer unwinder, so the /proc/<pid>/wchan usually returned 0 regardless
    of whether the task <pid> is running.
    
    Reimplement get_wchan() by calling stack_trace_save_tsk(), which is
    adapted to the ORC and frame pointer unwinders.

    net: tulip: winbond-840: fix build for UML
    
    [ Upstream commit a3d708925fcca1a2f7219bc9ce93e6341f85c1e0 ]
    
    On i386, when builtin (not a loadable module), the winbond-840 driver
    inspects boot_cpu_data to see what CPU family it is running on, and
    then acts on that data. The "family" struct member (x86) does not exist
    when running on UML, so prevent that test and do the default action.
    
    Prevents this build error on UML + i386:

    kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid sched_task_group
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ef0c5c6b5ba1f38f0ea1cedad0cad722f00c14a ]
    
    There is a small race between copy_process() and sched_fork()
    where child->sched_task_group point to an already freed pointer.
    
            parent doing fork()      | someone moving the parent
                                     | to another cgroup
      -------------------------------+-------------------------------
      copy_process()
          + dup_task_struct()<1>
                                      parent move to another cgroup,
                                      and free the old cgroup. <2>
          + sched_fork()
            + __set_task_cpu()<3>
            + task_fork_fair()
              + sched_slice()<4>
    
    In the worst case, this bug can lead to "use-after-free" and
    cause panic as shown above:
    
      (1) parent copy its sched_task_group to child at <1>;
    
      (2) someone move the parent to another cgroup and free the old
          cgroup at <2>;
    
      (3) the sched_task_group and cfs_rq that belong to the old cgroup
          will be accessed at <3> and <4>, which cause a panic:

    ath10k: fix max antenna gain unit
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a491167fe0cf9f26062462de2a8688b96125d48 ]
    
    Most of the txpower for the ath10k firmware is stored as twicepower (0.5 dB
    steps). This isn't the case for max_antenna_gain - which is still expected
    by the firmware as dB.
    
    The firmware is converting it from dB to the internal (twicepower)
    representation when it calculates the limits of a channel. This can be seen
    in tpc_stats when configuring "12" as max_antenna_gain. Instead of the
    expected 12 (6 dB), the tpc_stats shows 24 (12 dB).
    
    Tested on QCA9888 and IPQ4019 with firmware 10.4-3.5.3-00057.

    net, neigh: Fix NTF_EXT_LEARNED in combination with NTF_USE
    
    [ Upstream commit e4400bbf5b15750e1b59bf4722d18d99be60c69f ]
    
    The NTF_EXT_LEARNED neigh flag is usually propagated back to user space
    upon dump of the neighbor table. However, when used in combination with
    NTF_USE flag this is not the case despite exempting the entry from the
    garbage collector. This results in inconsistent state since entries are
    typically marked in neigh->flags with NTF_EXT_LEARNED, but here they are
    not. Fix it by propagating the creation flag to ___neigh_create().
    
    Before fix:
    
      # ./ip/ip n replace 192.168.178.30 dev enp5s0 use extern_learn
      # ./ip/ip n

    The "msh" pointer is device managed, meaning that memstick_alloc_host()
    calls device_initialize() on it.  That means that it can't be free
    using kfree() but must instead be freed with memstick_free_host().
    Otherwise it leads to a tiny memory leak of device resources.

    And for PM runtime and SDIO cards, we need to also save SYSCTL, IE and

    This should not be a problem currently, and these patches can be applied

    b43: fix a lower bounds test
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b793db5fca44d01f72d3564a168171acf7c4076 ]
    
    The problem is that "channel" is an unsigned int, when it's less 5 the
    value of "channel - 5" is not a negative number as one would expect but
    is very high positive value instead.
    
    This means that "start" becomes a very high positive value.  The result
    of that is that we never enter the "for (i = start; i <= end; i++) {"
    loop.  Instead of storing the result from b43legacy_radio_aci_detect()

    hwrng: mtk - Force runtime pm ops for sleep ops
    
    [ Upstream commit b6f5f0c8f72d348b2d07b20d7b680ef13a7ffe98 ]
    
    Currently mtk_rng_runtime_suspend/resume is called for both runtime pm
    and system sleep operations.
    
    This is wrong as these should only be runtime ops as the name already
    suggests. Currently freezing the system will lead to a call to
    mtk_rng_runtime_suspend even if the device currently isn't active. This
    leads to a clock warning because it is disabled/unprepared although it
    isn't enabled/prepared currently.
    
    This patch fixes this by only setting the runtime pm ops and forces to
    call the runtime pm ops from the system sleep ops as well if active but
    not otherwise.

    EDAC/amd64: Handle three rank interleaving mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f4873fb6af7966de8fcbd95c36b61351c1c4b1f ]
    
    AMD Rome systems and later support interleaving between three identical
    ranks within a channel.
    
    Check for this mode by counting the number of enabled chip selects and
    comparing their masks. If there are exactly three enabled chip selects
    and their masks are identical, then three rank interleaving is enabled.
    
    The size of a rank is determined from its mask value. However, three
    rank interleaving doesn't follow the method of swapping an interleave
    bit with the most significant bit. Rather, the interleave bit is flipped
    and the most significant bit remains the same. There is only a single
    interleave bit in this case.
    
    Account for this when determining the chip select size by keeping the
    most significant bit at its original value and ignoring any zero bits.
    This will return a full bitmask in [MSB:1].

    [ Upstream commit f96b4675839b66168f5a07bf964dde6c2f1c4885 ]
    
    Use get_unaligned() instead of memcpy() to access potentially unaligned
    memory, which, when accessed through a pointer, leads to undefined
    behavior. get_unaligned() describes much better what is happening there
    anyway even if memcpy() does the job.

    ath9k: Fix potential interrupt storm on queue reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 4925642d541278575ad1948c5924d71ffd57ef14 ]
    
    In tests with two Lima boards from 8devices (QCA4531 based) on OpenWrt
    19.07 we could force a silent restart of a device with no serial
    output when we were sending a high amount of UDP traffic (iperf3 at 80
    MBit/s in both directions from external hosts, saturating the wifi and
    causing a load of about 4.5 to 6) and were then triggering an
    ath9k_queue_reset().
    
    Further debugging showed that the restart was caused by the ath79
    watchdog. With disabled watchdog we could observe that the device was
    constantly going into ath_isr() interrupt handler and was returning
    early after the ATH_OP_HW_RESET flag test, without clearing any
    interrupts. Even though ath9k_queue_reset() calls
    ath9k_hw_kill_interrupts().
    
    With JTAG we could observe the following race condition:
    
    1) ath9k_queue_reset()
       ...
       -> ath9k_hw_kill_interrupts()
       -> set_bit(ATH_OP_HW_RESET, &common->op_flags);
       ...
       <- returns
    
          2) ath9k_tasklet()
             ...
             -> ath9k_hw_resume_interrupts()
             ...
             <- returns
    
                     3) loops around:
                        ...
                        handle_int()
                        -> ath_isr()
                           ...
                           -> if (test_bit(ATH_OP_HW_RESET,
                                           &common->op_flags))
                                return IRQ_HANDLED;
    
                        x) ath_reset_internal():
                           => never reached <=
    
    And in ath_isr() we would typically see the following interrupts /
    interrupt causes:
    
    * status: 0x00111030 or 0x00110030
    * async_cause: 2 (AR_INTR_MAC_IPQ)
    * sync_cause: 0
    
    So the ath9k_tasklet() reenables the ath9k interrupts
    through ath9k_hw_resume_interrupts() which ath9k_queue_reset() had just
    disabled. And ath_isr() then keeps firing because it returns IRQ_HANDLED
    without actually clearing the interrupt.
    
    To fix this IRQ storm also clear/disable the interrupts again when we
    are in reset state.

    ath10k: Don't always treat modem stop events as crashes
    
    [ Upstream commit 747ff7d3d7424876111b7559b7f6704762f89796 ]
    
    When rebooting on sc7180 Trogdor devices I see the following crash from
    the wifi driver.
    
     ath10k_snoc 18800000.wifi: firmware crashed! (guid 83493570-29a2-4e98-a83e-70048c47669c)
    
    This is because a modem stop event looks just like a firmware crash to
    the driver, the qmi connection is closed in both cases. Use the qcom ssr
    notifier block to stop treating the qmi connection close event as a
    firmware crash signal when the modem hasn't actually crashed. See
    ath10k_qmi_event_server_exit() for more details.
    
    This silences the crash message seen during every reboot.

    kprobes: Do not use local variable when creating debugfs file
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f7262cd66699a4b02eb7549b35c81b2116aad95 ]
    
    debugfs_create_file() takes a pointer argument that can be used during
    file operation callbacks (accessible via i_private in the inode
    structure). An obvious requirement is for the pointer to refer to
    valid memory when used.
    
    When creating the debugfs file to dynamically enable / disable
    kprobes, a pointer to local variable is passed to
    debugfs_create_file(); which will go out of scope when the init
    function returns. The reason this hasn't triggered random memory
    corruption is because the pointer is not accessed during the debugfs
    file callbacks.
    
    Since the enabled state is managed by the kprobes_all_disabled global
    variable, the local variable is not needed. Fix the incorrect (and
    unnecessary) usage of local variable during debugfs_file_create() by
    passing NULL instead.

    scs: Release kasan vmalloc poison in scs_free process
    
    [ Upstream commit 528a4ab45300fa6283556d9b48e26b45a8aa15c4 ]
    
    Since scs allocation is moved to vmalloc region, the
    shadow stack is protected by kasan_posion_vmalloc.
    However, the vfree_atomic operation needs to access
    its context for scs_free process and causes kasan error
    as the dump info below.
    
    This patch Adds kasan_unpoison_vmalloc() before vfree_atomic,
    which aligns to the prior flow as using kmem_cache.
    The vmalloc region will go back posioned in the following
    vumap() operations.

    media: atmel: fix the ispck initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit d7f26849ed7cc875d0ff7480c2efebeeccea2bad ]
    
    The runtime enabling of the ISPCK (internally clocks the pipeline inside
    the ISC) has to be done after the pm_runtime for the ISC dev has been
    started.
    
    After the commit by Mauro:
    the ISC failed to probe with the error:
    
    atmel-sama5d2-isc f0008000.isc: failed to enable ispck: -13
    atmel-sama5d2-isc: probe of f0008000.isc failed with error -13
    
    This is because the enabling of the ispck is done too early in the probe,
    and the PM runtime returns invalid request.
    Thus, moved this clock enabling after pm_runtime_idle is called.
    
    The ISPCK is required only for sama5d2 type of ISC.
    Thus, add a bool inside the isc struct that is platform dependent.
    For the sama7g5-isc, the enabling of the ISPCK is wrong and does not make
    sense. Removed it from the sama7g5 probe. In sama7g5-isc, there is only
    one clock, the MCK, which also clocks the internal pipeline of the ISC.
    
    Adapted the clk_prepare and clk_unprepare to request the runtime PM
    for both clocks (MCK and ISPCK) in case of sama5d2-isc, and the single
    clock (MCK) in case of sama7g5-isc.

    [ Upstream commit 48d219f9cc667bc6fbc3e3af0b1bfd75db94fce4 ]
    
    Static analysis reports this representative problem
    
    tda1997x.c:1939: warning: 7th function call argument is an uninitialized
    value
    
    The 7th argument is buffer[0], which is set in the earlier call to
    io_readn().  When io_readn() call to io_read() fails with the first
    read, buffer[0] is not set and 0 is returned and stored in len.
    
    The later call to hdmi_infoframe_unpack()'s size parameter is the
    static size of buffer, always 40, so a short read is not caught
    in hdmi_infoframe_unpacks()'s checking.  The variable len should be
    used instead.
    
    Zero initialize buffer to 0 so it is in a known start state.

    libbpf: Fix skel_internal.h to set errno on loader retval < 0
    
    [ Upstream commit e68ac0082787f4e8ee6ae5b19076ec7709ce715b ]
    
    When the loader indicates an internal error (result of a checked bpf
    system call), it returns the result in attr.test.retval. However, tests
    that rely on ASSERT_OK_PTR on NULL (returned from light skeleton) may
    miss that NULL denotes an error if errno is set to 0. This would result
    in skel pointer being NULL, while ASSERT_OK_PTR returning 1, leading to
    a SEGV on dereference of skel, because libbpf_get_error relies on the
    assumption that errno is always set in case of error for ptr == NULL.
    
    In particular, this was observed for the ksyms_module test. When
    executed using `./test_progs -t ksyms`, prior tests manipulated errno
    and the test didn't crash when it failed at ksyms_module load, while
    using `./test_progs -t ksyms_module` crashed due to errno being
    untouched.

    we added the vm_access hook, where we also directly call tt_swapin for
    some reason. If something is swapped-out then the ttm_tt must also be
    unpopulated, and since access_kmap should also call tt_populate, if
    needed, then swapping-in will already be handled there.
    
    If anything, calling tt_swapin directly here would likely always fail
    since the tt->pages won't yet be populated, or worse since the tt->pages
    array is never actually cleared in unpopulate this might lead to a nasty
    uaf.

    ath10k: Fix missing frame timestamp for beacon/probe-resp
    
    [ Upstream commit e6dfbc3ba90cc2b619229be56b485f085a0a8e1c ]
    
    When receiving a beacon or probe response, we should update the
    boottime_ns field which is the timestamp the frame was received at.
    (cf mac80211.h)
    
    This fixes a scanning issue with Android since it relies on this
    timestamp to determine when the AP has been seen for the last time
    (via the nl80211 BSS_LAST_SEEN_BOOTTIME parameter).

    gve: DQO: avoid unused variable warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e0083bd0777e4a418a6710d9ee04b979cdbe5cc ]
    
    The use of dma_unmap_addr()/dma_unmap_len() in the driver causes
    multiple warnings when these macros are defined as empty, e.g.
    in an ARCH=i386 allmodconfig build:
    
    drivers/net/ethernet/google/gve/gve_tx_dqo.c: In function 'gve_tx_add_skb_no_copy_dqo':
    drivers/net/ethernet/google/gve/gve_tx_dqo.c:494:40: error: unused variable 'buf' [-Werror=unused-variable]
      494 |                 struct gve_tx_dma_buf *buf =
    
    This is not how the NEED_DMA_MAP_STATE macros are meant to work,
    as they rely on never using local variables or a temporary structure
    like gve_tx_dma_buf.
    
    Remote the gve_tx_dma_buf definition and open-code the contents
    in all places to avoid the warning. This causes some rather long
    lines but otherwise ends up making the driver slightly smaller.

    ath11k: Avoid race during regd updates
    
    [ Upstream commit 1db2b0d0a39102238fcbf9092cefa65a710642e9 ]
    
    Whenever ath11k is bootup with a user country already set, cfg80211
    notifies this country info to ath11k soon after registration, where the
    notification is sent to the firmware for fetching the rules of this user
    country input.
    
    Multiple race conditions could be seen in this scenario where a new
    request is either lost as pointed in [1] or a new regd overwrites the
    default regd provided by the firmware during bootup. Note that, the
    default regd is used for intersection purpose and hence it should not be
    overwritten.
    
    The main reason as pointed by [1] is the usage of ATH11K_FLAG_REGISTERED
    flag which is updated after completion of core registration, whereas the
    reg notification from cfg80211 and wmi events for the corresponding
    request can happen much before that. Since the ATH11K_FLAG_REGISTERED is
    currently used to determine if the event containing reg rules belong to
    default regd or for user request, there is a possibility of the default
    regd getting overwritten.
    
    Since the default reg rules will be received only once per pdev on
    firmware load, the above flag based check can be replaced with a check
    to see if default_regd is already set, so that we can now always update
    the new_regd. Also if the new_regd is set, this will be always used to
    update the reg rules for the registered phy.

    cfg80211: always free wiphy specific regdomain
    
    [ Upstream commit e53e9828a8d2c6545e01ff9711f1221f2fd199ce ]
    
    In the (somewhat unlikely) event that we allocate a wiphy, then
    add a regdomain to it, and then fail registration, we leak the
    regdomain. Fix this by just always freeing it at the end, in the
    normal cases we'll free (and NULL) it during wiphy_unregister().
    This happened when the wiphy settings were bad, and since they
    can be controlled by userspace with hwsim, syzbot was able to
    find this issue.

    it is still reported as available, that is the number of instances is
    non-zero, but it has limited functionality. In particular it doesn't
    support encryption and decryption, but just signing and verifying. This
    is indicated by a bit in the PKHA_MISC field. Take this bit into account
    if we are checking for availability.

    wcn36xx: Fix Antenna Diversity Switching
    
    [ Upstream commit 701668d3bfa03dabc5095fc383d5315544ee5b31 ]
    
    We have been tracking a strange bug with Antenna Diversity Switching (ADS)
    on wcn3680b for a while.
    
    ADS is configured like this:
       A. Via a firmware configuration table baked into the NV area.
           1. Defines if ADS is enabled.
           2. Defines which GPIOs are connected to which antenna enable pin.
           3. Defines which antenna/GPIO is primary and which is secondary.
    
       B. WCN36XX_CFG_VAL(ANTENNA_DIVERSITY, N)
          N is a bitmask of available antenna.
    
          Setting N to 3 indicates a bitmask of enabled antenna (1 | 2).
    
          Obviously then we can set N to 1 or N to 2 to fix to a particular
          antenna and disable antenna diversity.
    
       C. WCN36XX_CFG_VAL(ASD_PROBE_INTERVAL, XX)
          XX is the number of beacons between each antenna RSSI check.
          Setting this value to 50 means, every 50 received beacons, run the
          ADS algorithm.
    
       D. WCN36XX_CFG_VAL(ASD_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD, YY)
          YY is a two's complement integer which specifies the RSSI decibel
          threshold below which ADS will run.
          We default to -60db here, meaning a measured RSSI <= -60db will
          trigger an ADS probe.
    
       E. WCN36XX_CFG_VAL(ASD_RTT_RSSI_HYST_THRESHOLD, Z)
          Z is a hysteresis value, indicating a delta which the RSSI must
          exceed for the antenna switch to be valid.
    
          For example if HYST_THRESHOLD == 3 AntennaId1-RSSI == -60db and
          AntennaId-2-RSSI == -58db then firmware will not switch antenna.
          The threshold needs to be -57db or better to satisfy the criteria.
    
       F. A firmware feature bit also exists ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SELECTION.
          This feature bit is used by the firmware to report if
          ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SELECTION is supported. The host is not required to
          toggle this bit to enable or disable ADS.
    
    ADS works like this:
    
        A. Every XX beacons the firmware switches to or remains on the primary
           antenna.
    
        B. The firmware then sends a Request-To-Send (RTS) packet to the AP.
    
        C. The firmware waits for a Clear-To-Send (CTS) response from the AP.
    
        D. The firmware then notes the received RSSI on the CTS packet.
    
        E. The firmware then repeats steps A-D on the secondary antenna.
    
        F. Subsequently if the RSSI on the measured antenna is better than
           ASD_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD + the active antenna's RSSI then the
           measured antenna becomes the active antenna.
    
        G. If RSSI rises past ASD_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD then ADS doesn't run at
           all even if there is a substantially better RSSI on the alternative
           antenna.
    
    What we have been observing is that the RTS packet is being sent but the
    MAC address is a byte-swapped version of the target MAC. The ADS/RTS MAC is
    corrupted only when the link is encrypted, if the AP is open the RTS MAC is
    correct. Similarly if we configure the firmware to an RTS/CTS sequence for
    regular data - the transmitted RTS MAC is correctly formatted.
    
    Internally the wcn36xx firmware uses the indexes in the SMD commands to
    populate and extract data from specific entries in an STA lookup table. The
    AP's MAC appears a number of times in different indexes within this lookup
    table, so the MAC address extracted for the data-transmit RTS and the MAC
    address extracted for the ADS/RTS packet are not the same STA table index.
    
    Our analysis indicates the relevant firmware STA table index is
    "bssSelfStaIdx".
    
    There is an STA populate function responsible for formatting the MAC
    address of the bssSelfStaIdx including byte-swapping the MAC address.
    
    Its clear then that the required STA populate command did not run for
    bssSelfStaIdx.
    
    So taking a look at the sequence of SMD commands sent to the firmware we
    see the following downstream when moving from an unencrypted to encrypted
    BSS setup.
    
    - WLAN_HAL_CONFIG_BSS_REQ
    - WLAN_HAL_CONFIG_STA_REQ
    - WLAN_HAL_SET_STAKEY_REQ
    
    Upstream in wcn36xx we have
    
    - WLAN_HAL_CONFIG_BSS_REQ
    - WLAN_HAL_SET_STAKEY_REQ
    
    The solution then is to add the missing WLAN_HAL_CONFIG_STA_REQ between
    WLAN_HAL_CONFIG_BSS_REQ and WLAN_HAL_SET_STAKEY_REQ.
    
    No surprise WLAN_HAL_CONFIG_STA_REQ is the routine responsible for
    populating the STA lookup table in the firmware and once done the MAC sent
    by the ADS routine is in the correct byte-order.
    
    This bug is apparent with ADS but it is also the case that any other
    firmware routine that depends on the "bssSelfStaIdx" would retrieve
    malformed data on an encrypted link.

    It was caused by the fact that rebind_subsystem() disables
    controllers to be rebound one by one. If more than one disabled
    controllers are originally from the default hierarchy, it means that
    cgroup_apply_control_disable() will be called multiple times for the
    same default hierarchy. A controller may be killed by css_kill() in
    the first round. In the second round, the killed controller may not be
    completely dead yet leading to the warning.
    
    To avoid this problem, we collect all the ssid's of controllers that
    needed to be disabled from the default hierarchy and then disable them
    in one go instead of one by one.

    drm: bridge: it66121: Fix return value it66121_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit f3bc07eba481942a246926c5b934199e7ccd567b ]
    
    Currently it66121_probe returns -EPROBE_DEFER if the there is no remote
    endpoint found in the device tree which doesn't seem helpful, since this
    is not going to change later and it is never checked if the next bridge
    has been initialized yet. It will fail in that case later while doing
    drm_bridge_attach for the next bridge in it66121_bridge_attach.
    
    Since the bindings documentation for it66121 bridge driver states
    there has to be a remote endpoint defined, its safe to return -EINVAL
    in that case.
    This additonally adds a check, if the remote endpoint is enabled and
    returns -EPROBE_DEFER, if the remote bridge hasn't been initialized
    (yet).

    x86/xen: Mark cpu_bringup_and_idle() as dead_end_function
    
    [ Upstream commit 9af9dcf11bda3e2c0e24c1acaacb8685ad974e93 ]
    
    The asm_cpu_bringup_and_idle() function is required to push the return
    value on the stack in order to make ORC happy, but the only reason
    objtool doesn't complain is because of a happy accident.
    
    The thing is that asm_cpu_bringup_and_idle() doesn't return, so
    validate_branch() never terminates and falls through to the next
    function, which in the normal case is the hypercall_page. And that, as
    it happens, is 4095 NOPs and a RET.
    
    Make asm_cpu_bringup_and_idle() terminate on it's own, by making the
    function it calls as a dead-end. This way we no longer rely on what

    The current definition of 2W burst length is invalid.
    This patch fixes it. Current downstream DEU driver doesn't
    use DMA. An incorrect burst length value doesn't cause any

    rcu: Fix existing exp request check in sync_sched_exp_online_cleanup()
    
    [ Upstream commit f0b2b2df5423fb369ac762c77900bc7765496d58 ]
    
    The sync_sched_exp_online_cleanup() checks to see if RCU needs
    an expedited quiescent state from the incoming CPU, sending it
    an IPI if so. Before sending IPI, it checks whether expedited
    qs need has been already requested for the incoming CPU, by
    checking rcu_data.cpu_no_qs.b.exp for the current cpu, on which
    sync_sched_exp_online_cleanup() is running. This works for the
    case where incoming CPU is same as self. However, for the case
    where incoming CPU is different from self, expedited request
    won't get marked, which can potentially delay reporting of
    expedited quiescent state for the incoming CPU.

    Bluetooth: fix init and cleanup of sco_conn.timeout_work
    
    [ Upstream commit 49d8a5606428ca0962d09050a5af81461ff90fbb ]
    
    Before freeing struct sco_conn, all delayed timeout work should be
    cancelled. Otherwise, sco_sock_timeout could potentially use the
    sco_conn after it has been freed.
    
    Additionally, sco_conn.timeout_work should be initialized when the
    connection is allocated, not when the channel is added. This is
    because an sco_conn can create channels with multiple sockets over its
    lifetime, which happens if sockets are released but the connection
    isn't deleted.

    fbdev/efifb: Release PCI device's runtime PM ref during FB destroy
    
    [ Upstream commit 55285e21f04517939480966164a33898c34b2af2 ]
    
    Atm the EFI FB platform driver gets a runtime PM reference for the
    associated GFX PCI device during probing the EFI FB platform device and
    releases it only when the platform device gets unbound.
    
    When fbcon switches to the FB provided by the PCI device's driver (for
    instance i915/drmfb), the EFI FB will get only unregistered without the
    EFI FB platform device getting unbound, keeping the runtime PM reference
    acquired during the platform device probing. This reference will prevent
    the PCI driver from runtime suspending the device.
    
    Fix this by releasing the RPM reference from the EFI FB's destroy hook,
    called when the FB gets unregistered.
    
    While at it assert that pm_runtime_get_sync() didn't fail.
    
    v2:
    - Move pm_runtime_get_sync() before register_framebuffer() to avoid its
      race wrt. efifb_destroy()->pm_runtime_put(). (Daniel)
    - Assert that pm_runtime_get_sync() didn't fail.
    - Clarify commit message wrt. platform/PCI device/driver and driver
      removal vs. device unbinding.

      R1 unbounded memory access, make sure to bounds check any such access
    
    In the above code r0 and r1 are implicitly related. Clang knows that,
    but verifier isn't able to infer this relationship.
    
    Yonghong Song narrowed down this "regression" in code generation to
    a recent Clang optimization change ([0]), which for BPF target generates
    code pattern that BPF verifier can't handle and loses track of register
    boundaries.
    
    This patch works around the issue by adding an BPF assembly-based helper
    that helps to prove to the verifier that upper bound of the register is
    a given constant by controlling the exact share of generated BPF
    instruction sequence. This fixes the immediate issue for strobemeta
    selftest.

    Before this patch, short-lived UDP flows never entered IPS_ASSURED, so
    they were already candidate flow to be deleted by early_drop under
    stress.
    
    Before this patch, IPS_ASSURED is set on regardless the internal stream
    state, attach this internal stream state to IPS_ASSURED.
    
    packet #1 (original direction) enters NEW state
    packet #2 (reply direction) enters ESTABLISHED state, sets on IPS_SEEN_REPLY
    paclet #3 (any direction) sets on IPS_ASSURED (if 2 seconds since the
              creation has passed by).

    [ Upstream commit 66e29fcda1824f0427966fbee2bd2c85bf362c82 ]
    
    With idle polling, IPIs are not sent when a CPU idle, but queued
    and run later from do_idle(). The default kgdb_call_nmi_hook()
    implementation gets the pointer to struct pt_regs from get_irq_reqs(),
    which doesn't work in that case because it was not called from the
    IPI interrupt handler. Fix it by defining our own kgdb_roundup()
    function which sents an IPI_ENTER_KGDB. When that IPI is received
    on the target CPU kgdb_nmicallback() is called.

    return the pointer to the highest address in the stack.

    perf/x86/intel: Fix ICL/SPR INST_RETIRED.PREC_DIST encodings
    
    [ Upstream commit 2de71ee153efa93099d2ab864acffeec70a8dcd5 ]
    
    This patch fixes the encoding for INST_RETIRED.PREC_DIST as published by Intel
    (download.01.org/perfmon/) for Icelake. The official encoding
    is event code 0x00 umask 0x1, a change from Skylake where it was code 0xc0
    umask 0x1.
    
    With this patch applied it is possible to run:
    $ perf record -a -e cpu/event=0x00,umask=0x1/pp .....
    
    Whereas before this would fail.
    
    To avoid problems with tools which may use the old code, we maintain the old
    encoding for Icelake.

    drm/amd/display: dcn20_resource_construct reduce scope of FPU enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit bc39a69a2ac484e6575a958567c162ef56c9f278 ]
    
    Limit when FPU is enabled to only functions that does FPU operations for
    dcn20_resource_construct, which gets called during driver
    initialization.
    
    Enabling FPU operation disables preemption.  Sleeping functions(mutex
    (un)lock, memory allocation using GFP_KERNEL, etc.) should not be called
    when preemption is disabled.
    
    Fixes the following case caught by enabling

    set_hv_tscchange_cb() can get preempted in between acquiring
    smp_processor_id() and writing to HV_X64_MSR_REENLIGHTENMENT_CONTROL. This
    is not an issue by itself: HV_X64_MSR_REENLIGHTENMENT_CONTROL is a
    partition-wide MSR and it doesn't matter which particular CPU will be
    used to receive reenlightenment notifications. The only real problem can
    (in theory) be observed if the CPU whose id was acquired with
    smp_processor_id() goes offline before we manage to write to the MSR,
    the logic in hv_cpu_die() won't be able to reassign it correctly.

    This telling us the CPU could be changed after task is preempted, and
    the checking on CPU before preemption will be invalid.
    
    Since now ftrace_test_recursion_trylock() will help to disable the
    preemption, this patch just do the checking after trylock() to address
    the issue.

    Revert "wcn36xx: Enable firmware link monitoring"
    
    [ Upstream commit 43ea9bd84f27d06482cc823d9749cc9dd2993bc8 ]
    
    Firmware link offload monitoring can be made to work in 3/4 cases by
    switching on firmware feature bit WLANACTIVE_OFFLOAD
    
    - Secure power-save on
    - Secure power-save off
    - Open power-save on
    
    However, with an open AP if we switch off power-saving - thus never
    entering Beacon Mode Power Save - BMPS, firmware never forwards loss
    of beacon upwards.
    
    We had hoped that WLANACTIVE_OFFLOAD and some fixes for sequence numbers
    would unblock this but, it hasn't and further investigation is required.
    
    Its possible to have a complete set of Secure power-save on/off and Open
    power-save on/off provided we use Linux' link monitoring mechanism.
    
    While we debug the Open AP failure we need to fix upstream.
    
    This reverts commit c973fdad79f6eaf247d48b5fc77733e989eb01e1.

    wcn36xx: Fix packet drop on resume
    
    [ Upstream commit df0697801d8aa2eebfe7f0b7388879639f8fe7cc ]
    
    If the system is resumed because of an incoming packet, the wcn36xx RX
    interrupts is fired before actual resuming of the wireless/mac80211
    stack, causing any received packets to be simply dropped. E.g. a ping
    request causes a system resume, but is dropped and so never forwarded
    to the IP stack.
    
    This change fixes that, disabling DMA interrupts on suspend to no pass
    packets until mac80211 is resumed and ready to handle them.
    
    Note that it's not incompatible with RX irq wake.

    wcn36xx: Correct band/freq reporting on RX
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a27ca39478270e07baf9c09aa0c99709769ba03 ]
    
    For packets originating from hardware scan, the channel and band is
    included in the buffer descriptor (bd->rf_band & bd->rx_ch).
    
    For 2Ghz band the channel value is directly reported in the 4-bit
    rx_ch field. For 5Ghz band, the rx_ch field contains a mapping
    index (given the 4-bit limitation).
    
    The reserved0 value field is also used to extend 4-bit mapping to
    5-bit mapping to support more than 16 5Ghz channels.
    
    This change adds correct reporting of the frequency/band, that is
    used in scan mechanism. And is required for 5Ghz hardware scan
    support.

    Usually the uuid_mutex exists to protect the fs_devices that map
    together all of the devices that match a specific uuid.  In rm_device
    we're messing with the uuid of a device, so it makes sense to protect
    that here.
    
    However in doing that it pulls in a whole host of lockdep dependencies,
    as we call mnt_may_write() on the sb before we grab the uuid_mutex, thus
    we end up with the dependency chain under the uuid_mutex being added
    under the normal sb write dependency chain, which causes problems with
    loop devices.
    
    We don't need the uuid mutex here however.  If we call
    btrfs_scan_one_device() before we scratch the super block we will find
    the fs_devices and not find the device itself and return EBUSY because
    the fs_devices is open.  If we call it after the scratch happens it will
    not appear to be a valid btrfs file system.
    
    We do not need to worry about other fs_devices modifying operations here
    because we're protected by the exclusive operations locking.
    
    So drop the uuid_mutex here in order to fix the lockdep splat.
    
    A more detailed explanation from the discussion:
    
    We are worried about rm and scan racing with each other, before this
    change we'll zero the device out under the UUID mutex so when scan does
    run it'll make sure that it can go through the whole device scan thing
    without rm messing with us.
    
    We aren't worried if the scratch happens first, because the result is we
    don't think this is a btrfs device and we bail out.
    
    The only case we are concerned with is we scratch _after_ scan is able
    to read the superblock and gets a seemingly valid super block, so lets
    consider this case.
    
    Scan will call device_list_add() with the device we're removing.  We'll
    call find_fsid_with_metadata_uuid() and get our fs_devices for this
    UUID.  At this point we lock the fs_devices->device_list_mutex.  This is
    what protects us in this case, but we have two cases here.
    
    1. We aren't to the device removal part of the RM.  We found our device,
       and device name matches our path, we go down and we set total_devices
       to our super number of devices, which doesn't affect anything because
       we haven't done the remove yet.
    
    2. We are past the device removal part, which is protected by the
       device_list_mutex.  Scan doesn't find the device, it goes down and
       does the
    
       if (fs_devices->opened)
               return -EBUSY;
    
       check and we bail out.
    
    Nothing about this situation is ideal, but the lockdep splat is real,
    and the fix is safe, tho admittedly a bit scary looking.

    Fix a warning reported by smatch that ret could be returned without
    initialized.  The dedupe operations are supposed to to return 0 for a 0
    length range but the caller does not pass olen == 0. To keep this
    behaviour and also fix the warning initialize ret to 0.

    The Medion s17 series laptops have the same issue on the keyboard
    as the s15 series, if skipping to call acpi_get_override_irq(), the
    keyboard could work well. So put the DMI info of s17 series in the
    IRQ override quirk table as well.

    Let GK45 not go into BIOS for determining the AC power state.
    
    The BIOS wrongly returns 0, so hardcode the power state to 1.
    
    The mini PC GK45 by Besstar Tech Lld. (aka Kodlix) just runs
    off AC. It does not include any batteries. Nevertheless BIOS
    reports AC off:

    net: annotate data-race in neigh_output()
    
    [ Upstream commit d18785e213866935b4c3dc0c33c3e18801ce0ce8 ]
    
    neigh_output() reads n->nud_state and hh->hh_len locklessly.
    
    This is fine, but we need to add annotations and document this.
    
    We evaluate skip_cache first to avoid reading these fields
    if the cache has to by bypassed.

    vrf: run conntrack only in context of lower/physdev for locally generated packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c9c296adfae9ea05f655d69e9f6e13daa86fb4a ]
    
    The VRF driver invokes netfilter for output+postrouting hooks so that users
    can create rules that check for 'oif $vrf' rather than lower device name.
    
    This is a problem when NAT rules are configured.
    
    To avoid any conntrack involvement in round 1, tag skbs as 'untracked'
    to prevent conntrack from picking them up.
    
    This gets cleared before the packet gets handed to the ip stack so
    conntrack will be active on the second iteration.
    
    One remaining issue is that a rule like
    
      output ... oif $vrfname notrack
    
    won't propagate to the second round because we can't tell
    'notrack set via ruleset' and 'notrack set by vrf driver' apart.
    However, this isn't a regression: the 'notrack' removal happens
    instead of unconditional nf_reset_ct().
    I'd also like to avoid leaking more vrf specific conditionals into the
    netfilter infra.
    
    For ingress, conntrack has already been done before the packet makes it
    to the vrf driver, with this patch egress does connection tracking with
    lower/physical device as well.

    tools/latency-collector: Use correct size when writing queue_full_warning
    
    [ Upstream commit f604de20c0a47e0e9518940a1810193678c92fa8 ]
    
    queue_full_warning is a pointer, so it is wrong to use sizeof to calculate
    the number of characters of the string it points to. The effect is that we
    only print out the first few characters of the warning string.
    
    The correct way is to use strlen(). We don't need to add 1 to the strlen()
    because we don't want to write the terminating null character to stdout.

    ARM: 9136/1: ARMv7-M uses BE-8, not BE-32
    
    [ Upstream commit 345dac33f58894a56d17b92a41be10e16585ceff ]
    
    When configuring the kernel for big-endian, we set either BE-8 or BE-32
    based on the CPU architecture level. Until linux-4.4, we did not have
    any ARMv7-M platform allowing big-endian builds, but now i.MX/Vybrid
    is in that category, adn we get a build error because of this:
    
    arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c: In function 'get_module_plt':
    arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c:60:46: error: implicit declaration of function '__opcode_to_mem_thumb32' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    
    This comes down to picking the wrong default, ARMv7-M uses BE8
    like ARMv7-A does. Changing the default gets the kernel to compile
    and presumably works.

    gfs2: Fix glock_hash_walk bugs
    
    [ Upstream commit 7427f3bb49d81525b7dd1d0f7c5f6bbc752e6f0e ]
    
    So far, glock_hash_walk took a reference on each glock it iterated over, and it
    was the examiner's responsibility to drop those references.  Dropping the final
    reference to a glock can sleep and the examiners are called in a RCU critical
    section with spin locks held, so examiners that didn't need the extra reference
    had to drop it asynchronously via gfs2_glock_queue_put or similar.  This wasn't
    done correctly in thaw_glock which did call gfs2_glock_put, and not at all in
    dump_glock_func.
    
    Change glock_hash_walk to not take glock references at all.  That way, the
    examiners that don't need them won't have to bother with slow asynchronous
    puts, and the examiners that do need references can take them themselves.

    gfs2: Cancel remote delete work asynchronously
    
    [ Upstream commit 486408d690e130c3adacf816754b97558d715f46 ]
    
    In gfs2_inode_lookup and gfs2_create_inode, we're calling
    gfs2_cancel_delete_work which currently cancels any remote delete work
    (delete_work_func) synchronously.  This means that if the work is
    currently running, it will wait for it to finish.  We're doing this to
    pevent a previous instance of an inode from having any influence on the
    next instance.
    
    However, delete_work_func uses gfs2_inode_lookup internally, and we can
    end up in a deadlock when delete_work_func gets interrupted at the wrong
    time.  For example,
    
      (1) An inode's iopen glock has delete work queued, but the inode
          itself has been evicted from the inode cache.
    
      (2) The delete work is preempted before reaching gfs2_inode_lookup.
    
      (3) Another process recreates the inode (gfs2_create_inode).  It tries
          to cancel any outstanding delete work, which blocks waiting for
          the ongoing delete work to finish.
    
      (4) The delete work calls gfs2_inode_lookup, which blocks waiting for
          gfs2_create_inode to instantiate and unlock the new inode =>
          deadlock.
    
    It turns out that when the delete work notices that its inode has been
    re-instantiated, it will do nothing.  This means that it's safe to
    cancel the delete work asynchronously.  This prevents the kind of
    deadlock described above.

    ARM: clang: Do not rely on lr register for stacktrace
    
    [ Upstream commit b3ea5d56f212ad81328c82454829a736197ebccc ]
    
    Currently the stacktrace on clang compiled arm kernel uses the 'lr'
    register to find the first frame address from pt_regs. However, that
    is wrong after calling another function, because the 'lr' register
    is used by 'bl' instruction and never be recovered.
    
    As same as gcc arm kernel, directly use the frame pointer (r11) of
    the pt_regs to find the first frame address.
    
    Note that this fixes kretprobe stacktrace issue only with
    CONFIG_UNWINDER_FRAME_POINTER=y. For the CONFIG_UNWINDER_ARM,
    we need another fix.

           Thread1                       Thread2
    mount /dev/sda /home/test
    get s_mmp_bh  --> has mapped flag
    start kmmpd thread
                                    echo "/dev/sda" > /sys/power/resume
                                      resume_store
                                        software_resume
                                          swsusp_check
                                            set_blocksize
                                              truncate_inode_pages_range
                                                truncate_cleanup_page
                                                  block_invalidatepage
                                                    discard_buffer --> clean mapped flag
    write_mmp_block
      submit_bh
        submit_bh_wbc
          BUG_ON(!buffer_mapped(bh))
    
    To address this issue, modify swsusp_check() to open the target block
    device with exclusive access.

    arm64: vdso32: suppress error message for 'make mrproper'
    
    [ Upstream commit 14831fad73f5ac30ac61760487d95a538e6ab3cb ]
    
    When running the following command without arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc in
    one's $PATH, the following warning is observed:
    
    $ ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT=arm-linux-gnueabi- make -j72 LLVM=1 mrproper
    make[1]: arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc: No such file or directory
    
    This is because KCONFIG is not run for mrproper, so CONFIG_CC_IS_CLANG
    is not set, and we end up eagerly evaluating various variables that try
    to invoke CC_COMPAT.
    
    This is a similar problem to what was observed in
    commit dc960bfeedb0 ("h8300: suppress error messages for 'make clean'")

    nvme: drop scan_lock and always kick requeue list when removing namespaces
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b81a5f015199f3d585ce710190a9e87714d3c1e ]
    
    When reading the partition table on initial scan hits an I/O error the
    I/O will hang with the scan_mutex held:
    
    [<0>] do_read_cache_page+0x49b/0x790

    [<0>] process_one_work+0x231/0x420
    
    and trying to delete the controller will deadlock as it tries to grab
    the scan mutex:
    
    [<0>] nvme_mpath_clear_ctrl_paths+0x25/0x80 [nvme_core]
    [<0>] nvme_remove_namespaces+0x31/0xf0 [nvme_core]
    [<0>] nvme_do_delete_ctrl+0x4b/0x80 [nvme_core]
    
    As we're now properly ordering the namespace list there is no need to
    hold the scan_mutex in nvme_mpath_clear_ctrl_paths() anymore.
    And we always need to kick the requeue list as the path will be marked
    as unusable and I/O will be requeued _without_ a current path.

    nvmet: fix use-after-free when a port is removed
    
    [ Upstream commit e3e19dcc4c416d65f99f13d55be2b787f8d0050e ]
    
    When a port is removed through configfs, any connected controllers
    are starting teardown flow asynchronously and can still send commands.
    This causes a use-after-free bug for any command that dereferences
    req->port (like in nvmet_parse_io_cmd).
    
    To fix this, wait for all the teardown scheduled works to complete
    (like release_work at rdma/tcp drivers). This ensures there are no
    active controllers when the port is eventually removed.

    media: allegro: ignore interrupt if mailbox is not initialized
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ecda6393db4be44aba27a243e648dc98c9b92e3 ]
    
    The mailbox is initialized after the interrupt handler is installed. As
    the firmware is loaded and started even later, it should not happen that
    the interrupt occurs without the mailbox being initialized.
    
    As the Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org) keeps
    reporting this as an error, add a check to ignore interrupts before the
    mailbox is initialized to fix this potential null pointer dereference.

    block: remove inaccurate requeue check
    
    [ Upstream commit 037057a5a979c7eeb2ee5d12cf4c24b805192c75 ]
    
    This check is meant to catch cases where a requeue is attempted on a
    request that is still inserted. It's never really been useful to catch any
    misuse, and now it's actively wrong. Outside of that, this should not be a
    BUG_ON() to begin with.
    
    Remove the check as it's now causing active harm, as requeue off the plug
    path will trigger it even though the request state is just fine.

    mwl8k: Fix use-after-free in mwl8k_fw_state_machine()

    When the driver fails to request the firmware, it calls its error
    handler. In the error handler, the driver detaches device from driver
    first before releasing the firmware, which can cause a use-after-free bug.

    tracing/cfi: Fix cmp_entries_* functions signature mismatch
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ce1bb83a14019f8c396d57ec704d19478747716 ]
    
    If CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y, attempting to read an event histogram will cause
    the kernel to panic due to failed CFI check.
    
        1. echo 'hist:keys=common_pid' >> events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
        2. cat events/sched/sched_switch/hist
        3. kernel panics on attempting to read hist
    
    This happens because the sort() function expects a generic
    int (*)(const void *, const void *) pointer for the compare function.
    To prevent this CFI failure, change tracing map cmp_entries_* function
    signatures to match this.
    
    Also, fix the build error reported by the kernel test robot [1].

    lib/xz: Validate the value before assigning it to an enum variable
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f8d7abaa413c34da9d751289849dbfb7c977d05 ]
    
    This might matter, for example, if the underlying type of enum xz_check
    was a signed char. In such a case the validation wouldn't have caught an
    unsupported header. I don't know if this problem can occur in the kernel
    on any arch but it's still good to fix it because some people might copy
    the XZ code to their own projects from Linux instead of the upstream
    XZ Embedded repository.
    
    This change may increase the code size by a few bytes. An alternative
    would have been to use an unsigned int instead of enum xz_check but
    using an enumeration looks cleaner.

    lib/xz: Avoid overlapping memcpy() with invalid input with in-place decompression
    
    [ Upstream commit 83d3c4f22a36d005b55f44628f46cc0d319a75e8 ]
    
    With valid files, the safety margin described in lib/decompress_unxz.c
    ensures that these buffers cannot overlap. But if the uncompressed size
    of the input is larger than the caller thought, which is possible when
    the input file is invalid/corrupt, the buffers can overlap. Obviously
    the result will then be garbage (and usually the decoder will return
    an error too) but no other harm will happen when such an over-run occurs.
    
    This change only affects uncompressed LZMA2 chunks and so this
    should have no effect on performance.

    locking/rwsem: Disable preemption for spinning region
    
    [ Upstream commit 7cdacc5f52d68a9370f182c844b5b3e6cc975cc1 ]
    
    The spinning region rwsem_spin_on_owner() should not be preempted,
    however the rwsem_down_write_slowpath() invokes it and don't disable
    preemption. Fix it by adding a pair of preempt_disable/enable().

    floppy: fix calling platform_device_unregister() on invalid drives
    
    [ Upstream commit 662167e59d2f3c15a44a88088fc6c1a67c8a3650 ]
    
    platform_device_unregister() should only be called when
    a respective platform_device_register() is called. However
    the floppy driver currently allows failures when registring
    a drive and a bail out could easily cause an invalid call
    to platform_device_unregister() where it was not intended.
    
    Fix this by adding a bool to keep track of when the platform
    device was registered for a drive.
    
    This does not fix any known panic / bug. This issue was found
    through code inspection while preparing the driver to use the
    up and coming support for device_add_disk() error handling.
    From what I can tell from code inspection, chances of this
    ever happening should be insanely small, perhaps OOM.

    block: bump max plugged deferred size from 16 to 32
    
    [ Upstream commit ba0ffdd8ce48ad7f7e85191cd29f9674caca3745 ]
    
    Particularly for NVMe with efficient deferred submission for many
    requests, there are nice benefits to be seen by bumping the default max
    plug count from 16 to 32. This is especially true for virtualized setups,
    where the submit part is more expensive. But can be noticed even on
    native hardware.
    
    Reduce the multiple queue factor from 4 to 2, since we're changing the
    default size.
    
    While changing it, move the defines into the block layer private header.
    These aren't values that anyone outside of the block layer uses, or
    should use.

    thermal/drivers/tsens: Add timeout to get_temp_tsens_valid
    
    [ Upstream commit d012f9189fda0f3a1b303780ba0bbc7298d0d349 ]
    
    The function can loop and lock the system if for whatever reason the bit
    for the target sensor is NEVER valid. This is the case if a sensor is
    disabled by the factory and the valid bit is never reported as actually
    valid. Add a timeout check and exit if a timeout occurs. As this is
    a very rare condition, handle the timeout only if the first read fails.
    While at it also rework the function to improve readability and convert
    to poll_timeout generic macro.

    ACPI: scan: Release PM resources blocked by unused objects
    
    [ Upstream commit c10383e8ddf4810b9a5c1595404c2724d925a0a6 ]
    
    On some systems the ACPI namespace contains device objects that are
    not used in certain configurations of the system.  If they start off
    in the D0 power state configuration, they will stay in it until the
    system reboots, because of the lack of any mechanism possibly causing
    their configuration to change.  If that happens, they may prevent
    some power resources from being turned off or generally they may
    prevent the platform from getting into the deepest low-power states
    thus causing some energy to be wasted.
    
    Address this issue by changing the configuration of unused ACPI
    device objects to the D3cold power state one after carrying out
    the ACPI-based enumeration of devices.

    Some buggy firmware and/or brand new batteries can support a charge that's
    slightly over the reported design capacity. In such cases, the kernel will
    report to userspace that the charging state of the battery is "Unknown",
    when in reality the battery charge is "Full", at least from the design
    capacity point of view. Make the fallback condition accepts capacities
    over the designed capacity so userspace knows that is full.

      struct pri_detector *de = cd->detectors[i];
    
    To fix this possible null-pointer dereference, check cd->detectors before
    the for loop to dereference cd->detectors.

    tracing: Disable "other" permission bits in the tracefs files
    
    [ Upstream commit 21ccc9cd72116289469e5519b6159c675a2fa58f ]
    
    When building the files in the tracefs file system, do not by default set
    any permissions for OTH (other). This will make it easier for admins who
    want to define a group for accessing tracefs and not having to first
    disable all the permission bits for "other" in the file system.
    
    As tracing can leak sensitive information, it should never by default
    allowing all users access. An admin can still set the permission bits for
    others to have access, which may be useful for creating a honeypot and
    seeing who takes advantage of it and roots the machine.

    tracefs: Have tracefs directories not set OTH permission bits by default
    
    [ Upstream commit 49d67e445742bbcb03106b735b2ab39f6e5c56bc ]
    
    The tracefs file system is by default mounted such that only root user can
    access it. But there are legitimate reasons to create a group and allow
    those added to the group to have access to tracing. By changing the
    permissions of the tracefs mount point to allow access, it will allow
    group access to the tracefs directory.
    
    There should not be any real reason to allow all access to the tracefs
    directory as it contains sensitive information. Have the default
    permission of directories being created not have any OTH (other) bits set,
    such that an admin that wants to give permission to a group has to first
    disable all OTH bits in the file system.

    drm/amdkfd: rm BO resv on validation to avoid deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit ec6abe831a843208e99a59adf108adba22166b3f ]
    
    This fix the deadlock with the BO reservations during SVM_BO evictions
    while allocations in VRAM are concurrently performed. More specific,
    while the ttm waits for the fence to be signaled (ttm_bo_wait), it
    already has the BO reserved. In parallel, the restore worker might be
    running, prefetching memory to VRAM. This also requires to reserve the
    BO, but blocks the mmap semaphore first. The deadlock happens when the
    SVM_BO eviction worker kicks in and waits for the mmap semaphore held
    in restore worker. Preventing signal the fence back, causing the
    deadlock until the ttm times out.
    
    We don't need to hold the BO reservation anymore during validation
    and mapping. Now the physical addresses are taken from hmm_range_fault.
    We also take migrate_mutex to prevent range migration while
    validate_and_map update GPU page table.

    net-sysfs: try not to restart the syscall if it will fail eventually
    
    [ Upstream commit 146e5e733310379f51924111068f08a3af0db830 ]
    
    Due to deadlocks in the networking subsystem spotted 12 years ago[1],
    a workaround was put in place[2] to avoid taking the rtnl lock when it
    was not available and restarting the syscall (back to VFS, letting
    userspace spin). The following construction is found a lot in the net
    sysfs and sysctl code:
    
      if (!rtnl_trylock())
              return restart_syscall();
    
    This can be problematic when multiple userspace threads use such
    interfaces in a short period, making them to spin a lot. This happens
    for example when adding and moving virtual interfaces: userspace
    programs listening on events, such as systemd-udevd and NetworkManager,
    do trigger actions reading files in sysfs. It gets worse when a lot of
    virtual interfaces are created concurrently, say when creating
    containers at boot time.
    
    Returning early without hitting the above pattern when the syscall will
    fail eventually does make things better. While it is not a fix for the
    issue, it does ease things.

    ice: Move devlink port to PF/VF struct
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ae0aa4758b0f4a247d45cb3bf01548a7f396751 ]
    
    Keeping devlink port inside VSI data structure causes some issues.
    Since VF VSI is released during reset that means that we have to
    unregister devlink port and register it again every time reset is
    triggered. With the new changes in devlink API it
    might cause deadlock issues. After calling
    devlink_port_register/devlink_port_unregister devlink API is going to
    lock rtnl_mutex. It's an issue when VF reset is triggered in netlink
    operation context (like setting VF MAC address or VLAN),
    because rtnl_lock is already taken by netlink. Another call of
    rtnl_lock from devlink API results in dead-lock.
    
    By moving devlink port to PF/VF we avoid creating/destroying it
    during reset. Since this patch, devlink ports are created during
    ice_probe, destroyed during ice_remove for PF and created during
    ice_repr_add, destroyed during ice_repr_rem for VF.

    cpufreq: Make policy min/max hard requirements
    
    [ Upstream commit 15171769069408789a72f9aa9a52cc931b839b56 ]
    
    When applying the policy min/max limits, the requested frequency is
    simply clamped to not be out of range. It means, however, if one of the
    boundaries isn't an available frequency, the frequency resolution can
    return a value out of those limits, depending on the relation used.
    
    e.g. freq{0,1,2} being available frequencies.
    
              freq0  policy->min  freq1  policy->max   freq2
                |        |          |        |           |
              17kHz     18kHz     19kHz     20kHz      21kHz
    
         __resolve_freq(21kHz, CPUFREQ_RELATION_L) -> 21kHz (out of bounds)
         __resolve_freq(17kHz, CPUFREQ_RELATION_H) -> 17kHz (out of bounds)
    
    If, during the policy init, we resolve the requested min/max to existing
    frequencies, we ensure that any CPUFREQ_RELATION_* would resolve to a
    frequency which is inside the policy min/max range.
    
    Making the policy limits rigid helps to introduce the inefficient
    frequencies support. Resolving an inefficient frequency to an efficient
    one should not transgress policy->max (which can be set for thermal
    reason) and having a value we can trust simplify this comparison.

    ACPICA: Avoid evaluating methods too early during system resume
    
    [ Upstream commit d3c4b6f64ad356c0d9ddbcf73fa471e6a841cc5c ]
    
    ACPICA commit 0762982923f95eb652cf7ded27356b247c9774de
    
    During wakeup from system-wide sleep states, acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
    is called and it tries to get memory from the slab allocator in order
    to evaluate a control method, but if KFENCE is enabled in the kernel,
    the memory allocation attempt causes an IRQ work to be queued and a
    self-IPI to be sent to the CPU running the code which requires the
    memory controller to be ready, so if that happens too early in the
    wakeup path, it doesn't work.
    
    Prevent that from taking place by calling acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
    for S0 upfront, when preparing to enter a given sleep state, and
    saving the data obtained by it for later use during system wakeup.

    fs/proc/uptime.c: Fix idle time reporting in /proc/uptime
    
    [ Upstream commit a130e8fbc7de796eb6e680724d87f4737a26d0ac ]
    
    /proc/uptime reports idle time by reading the CPUTIME_IDLE field from
    the per-cpu kcpustats. However, on NO_HZ systems, idle time is not
    continually updated on idle cpus, leading this value to appear
    incorrectly small.
    
    /proc/stat performs an accounting update when reading idle time; we
    can use the same approach for uptime.
    
    With this patch, /proc/stat and /proc/uptime now agree on idle time.
    Additionally, the following shows idle time tick up consistently on an
    idle machine:
    
      (while true; do cat /proc/uptime; sleep 1; done) | awk '{print $2-prev; prev=$2}'

    brcmfmac: Add DMI nvram filename quirk for Cyberbook T116 tablet
    
    [ Upstream commit 49c3eb3036e6359c5c20fe76c611a2c0e0d4710e ]
    
    The Cyberbook T116 tablet contains quite generic names in the sys_vendor
    and product_name DMI strings, without this patch brcmfmac will try to load:
    "brcmfmac43455-sdio.Default string-Default string.txt" as nvram file which
    is way too generic.
    
    The nvram file shipped on the factory Android image contains the exact
    same settings as those used on the AcePC T8 mini PC, so point the new
    DMI nvram filename quirk to the acepc-t8 nvram file.

    ia64: don't do IA64_CMPXCHG_DEBUG without CONFIG_PRINTK
    
    [ Upstream commit c15b5fc054c3d6c97e953617605235c5cb8ce979 ]
    
    When CONFIG_PRINTK is not set, the CMPXCHG_BUGCHECK() macro calls
    _printk(), but _printk() is a static inline function, not available
    as an extern.
    Since the purpose of the macro is to print the BUGCHECK info,
    make this config option depend on PRINTK.
    
    Fixes multiple occurrences of this build error:

    The error seems to be an error in mceusb_dev_recv(). In the case of
    -EPROTO error, the routine immediately resubmits the URB. Instead it
    should return without resubmitting URB.

    media: rcar-vin: Use user provided buffers when starting
    
    [ Upstream commit a5991c4e947153418f71f4689614b87ca0551b81 ]
    
    When adding an internal scratch buffer to improve buffer handling when
    stopping it was also erroneously used when syncing at capture start.
    This led to that the first three buffers captured were always dropped
    as they were captured in the scratch buffer instead of in a buffer
    provided by the user.
    
    Allow the hardware to be given user provided buffers when preparing for
    capture in the stopped state. This still allows the driver to sync with
    the hardware and always completes the buffers to user-space in the
    correct order as no buffers are completed before the sync is complete.
    This change improves the driver as buffers are completed and given to
    the user three frames earlier than before.
    
    The change also fixes a warning produced by v4l2-compliance,
    
        warn: v4l2-test-buffers.cpp(448): got sequence number 3, expected 0

    media: videobuf2: rework vb2_mem_ops API
    
    [ Upstream commit a4b83deb3e76fb9385ca58e2c072a145b3a320d6 ]
    
    With the new DMA API we need an extension of the videobuf2 API.
    Previously, videobuf2 core would set the non-coherent DMA bit
    in the vb2_queue dma_attr field (if user-space would pass a
    corresponding memory hint); the vb2 core then would pass the
    vb2_queue dma_attrs to the vb2 allocators. The vb2 allocator
    would use the queue's dma_attr and the DMA API would allocate
    either coherent or non-coherent memory.
    
    But we cannot do this anymore, since there is no corresponding DMA
    attr flag and, hence, there is no way for the allocator to become
    aware of what type of allocation user-space has requested. So we
    need to pass more context from videobuf2 core to the allocators.
    
    Fix this by changing the call_ptr_memop() macro to pass the
    vb2 pointer to the corresponding op callbacks.

    [ Upstream commit 8515965e5e33f4feb56134348c95953f3eadfb26 ]
    
    The variable pdev is assigned to dev->plat_dev, and dev->plat_dev is
    checked in:
      if (!dev->plat_dev)
    
    This indicates both dev->plat_dev and pdev can be NULL. If so, the
    function dev_err() is called to print error information.
      dev_err(&pdev->dev, "No platform data specified\n");
    
    However, &pdev->dev is an illegal address, and it is dereferenced in
    dev_err().
    
    To fix this possible null-pointer dereference, replace dev_err() with
    mfc_err().

    media: mt9p031: Fix corrupted frame after restarting stream
    
    [ Upstream commit 0961ba6dd211a4a52d1dd4c2d59be60ac2dc08c7 ]
    
    To prevent corrupted frames after starting and stopping the sensor its
    datasheet specifies a specific pause sequence to follow:
    
    Stopping:
            Set Pause_Restart Bit -> Set Restart Bit -> Set Chip_Enable Off
    
    Restarting:
            Set Chip_Enable On -> Clear Pause_Restart Bit
    
    The Restart Bit is cleared automatically and must not be cleared
    manually as this would cause undefined behavior.

    octeontx2-pf: Enable promisc/allmulti match MCAM entries.
    
    [ Upstream commit ffd2f89ad05cd620d822112a07b0c5669fa9e333 ]
    
    Whenever the interface is brought up/down then set_rx_mode
    function is called by the stack which enables promisc/allmulti
    MCAM entries. But there are cases when driver brings
    interface down and then up such as while changing number
    of channels. In these cases promisc/allmulti MCAM entries
    are left disabled as set_rx_mode callback is not called.
    This patch enables these MCAM entries in all such cases.

    Beacon buffer for high latency devices does not use DMA. other similar
    buffer allocation methods in the driver have already been modified for
    high latency path. Fix the beacon buffer allocation left out in the
    earlier high latency changes.

    ath11k: Change DMA_FROM_DEVICE to DMA_TO_DEVICE when map reinjected packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 86a03dad0f5ad8182ed5fcf7bf3eec71cd96577c ]
    
    For fragmented packets, ath11k reassembles each fragment as a normal
    packet and then reinjects it into HW ring. In this case, the DMA
    direction should be DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE, otherwise
    invalid payload will be reinjected to HW and then delivered to host.
    What is more, since arbitrary memory could be allocated to the frame, we
    don't know what kind of data is contained in the buffer reinjected.
    Thus, as a bad result, private info may be leaked.
    
    Note that this issue is only found on Intel platform.

    ath11k: add handler for scan event WMI_SCAN_EVENT_DEQUEUED
    
    [ Upstream commit 441b3b5911f8ead7f2fe2336587b340a33044d58 ]
    
    When wlan interface is up, 11d scan is sent to the firmware, and the
    firmware needs to spend couple of seconds to complete the 11d scan. If
    immediately a normal scan from user space arrives to ath11k, then the
    normal scan request is also sent to the firmware, but the scan started
    event will be reported to ath11k until the 11d scan complete. When timed
    out for the scan started in ath11k, ath11k stops the normal scan and the
    firmware reports WMI_SCAN_EVENT_DEQUEUED to ath11k for the normal scan.
    ath11k has no handler for the event and then timed out for the scan
    completed in ath11k_scan_stop(), and ath11k prints the following error
    message.
    
    [ 1491.604750] ath11k_pci 0000:02:00.0: failed to receive scan abort comple: timed out

    Add a handler for WMI_SCAN_EVENT_DEQUEUED and then complete the scan to
    get rid of the above error message.

    In the above, the user configured country 'FR' is overwritten

    during firmware recovery as they have been already applied during
    driver registration or after last set user country is configured.
    
    This scenario applies for both AP and STA devices basically because
    cfg80211 is not aware of the recovery and only the driver recovers, but
    changing or resetting of the reg domain during recovery is not needed so
    as to continue with the configured regdomain currently in use.

    selftests: net: fib_nexthops: Wait before checking reported idle time
    
    [ Upstream commit b69c99463d414cc263411462d52f25205657e9af ]
    
    The purpose of this test is to verify that after a short activity passes,
    the reported time is reasonable: not zero (which could be reported by
    mistake), and not something outrageous (which would be indicative of an
    issue in used units).
    
    However, the idle time is reported in units of clock_t, or hundredths of
    second. If the initial sequence of commands is very quick, it is possible
    that the idle time is reported as just flat-out zero. When this test was
    recently enabled in our nightly regression, we started seeing spurious
    failures for exactly this reason.
    
    Therefore buffer the delay leading up to the test with a sleep, to make
    sure there is no legitimate way of reporting 0.

    fscrypt: allow 256-bit master keys with AES-256-XTS
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f595d6a6cdc336834552069a2e0a4f6d4756ddf ]
    
    fscrypt currently requires a 512-bit master key when AES-256-XTS is
    used, since AES-256-XTS keys are 512-bit and fscrypt requires that the
    master key be at least as long any key that will be derived from it.
    
    However, this is overly strict because AES-256-XTS doesn't actually have
    a 512-bit security strength, but rather 256-bit.  The fact that XTS
    takes twice the expected key size is a quirk of the XTS mode.  It is
    sufficient to use 256 bits of entropy for AES-256-XTS, provided that it
    is first properly expanded into a 512-bit key, which HKDF-SHA512 does.
    
    Therefore, relax the check of the master key size to use the security
    strength of the derived key rather than the size of the derived key
    (except for v1 encryption policies, which don't use HKDF).
    
    Besides making things more flexible for userspace, this is needed in
    order for the use of a KDF which only takes a 256-bit key to be
    introduced into the fscrypt key hierarchy.  This will happen with
    hardware-wrapped keys support, as all known hardware which supports that
    feature uses an SP800-108 KDF using AES-256-CMAC, so the wrapped keys
    are wrapped 256-bit AES keys.  Moreover, there is interest in fscrypt
    supporting the same type of AES-256-CMAC based KDF in software as an
    alternative to HKDF-SHA512.  There is no security problem with such
    features, so fix the key length check to work properly with them.

    spi: Check we have a spi_device_id for each DT compatible
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fa6863ba69265cb7e45567d12614790ff26bd56 ]
    
    Currently for SPI devices we use the spi_device_id for module autoloading
    even on systems using device tree, meaning that listing a compatible string
    in the of_match_table isn't enough to have the module for a SPI driver
    autoloaded.
    
    We attempted to fix this by generating OF based modaliases for devices
    instantiated from DT in 3ce6c9e2617e ("spi: add of_device_uevent_modalias
    support") but this meant we no longer reported spi_device_id based aliases
    which broke drivers such as spi-nor which don't list all the compatible
    strings they support directly for DT, and in at least that case it's not
    super practical to do so given the very large number of compatibles
    needed, much larger than the number spi_device_ids due to vendor strings.
    As a result fell back to using spi_device_id based modalises.
    
    Try to close the gap by printing a warning when a SPI driver has a DT
    compatible that won't be matched as a SPI device ID with the goal of having
    drivers provide both. Given fallback compatibles this check is going to be
    excessive but it should be robust which is probably more important here.

    mwifiex: Properly initialize private structure on interface type changes
    
    [ Upstream commit c606008b70627a2fc485732a53cc22f0f66d0981 ]
    
    When creating a new virtual interface in mwifiex_add_virtual_intf(), we
    update our internal driver states like bss_type, bss_priority, bss_role
    and bss_mode to reflect the mode the firmware will be set to.
    
    When switching virtual interface mode using
    mwifiex_init_new_priv_params() though, we currently only update bss_mode
    and bss_role. In order for the interface mode switch to actually work,
    we also need to update bss_type to its proper value, so do that.
    
    This fixes a crash of the firmware (because the driver tries to execute
    commands that are invalid in AP mode) when switching from station mode
    to AP mode.

    mwifiex: Run SET_BSS_MODE when changing from P2P to STATION vif-type
    
    [ Upstream commit c2e9666cdffd347460a2b17988db4cfaf2a68fb9 ]
    
    We currently handle changing from the P2P to the STATION virtual
    interface type slightly different than changing from P2P to ADHOC: When
    changing to STATION, we don't send the SET_BSS_MODE command. We do send
    that command on all other type-changes though, and it probably makes
    sense to send the command since after all we just changed our BSS_MODE.
    Looking at prior changes to this part of the code, it seems that this is
    simply a leftover from old refactorings.
    
    Since sending the SET_BSS_MODE command is the only difference between
    mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() and the current code, we can now use
    mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() for both switching to ADHOC and
    STATION interface type.
    
    This does not fix any particular bug and just "looked right", so there's
    a small chance it might be a regression.

    crypto: aesni - check walk.nbytes instead of err
    
    [ Upstream commit a2d3cbc80d2527b435154ff0f89b56ef4b84370f ]
    
    In the code for xts_crypt(), we check for the err value returned by
    skcipher_walk_virt() and return from the function if it is non zero.
    However, skcipher_walk_virt() can set walk.nbytes to 0, which would cause
    us to call kernel_fpu_begin(), and then skip the kernel_fpu_end() call.
    
    This patch checks for the walk.nbytes value instead, and returns if
    walk.nbytes is 0. This prevents us from calling kernel_fpu_begin() in
    the first place and also covers the case of having a non zero err value
    returned from skcipher_walk_virt().

    net: sched: update default qdisc visibility after Tx queue cnt changes
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e080f17750d1083e8a32f7b350584ae1cd7ff20 ]
    
    mq / mqprio make the default child qdiscs visible. They only do
    so for the qdiscs which are within real_num_tx_queues when the
    device is registered. Depending on order of calls in the driver,
    or if user space changes config via ethtool -L the number of
    qdiscs visible under tc qdisc show will differ from the number
    of queues. This is confusing to users and potentially to system
    configuration scripts which try to make sure qdiscs have the
    right parameters.
    
    Add a new Qdisc_ops callback and make relevant qdiscs TTRT.
    
    Note that this uncovers the "shortcut" created by
    commit 1f27cde313d7 ("net: sched: use pfifo_fast for non real queues")
    The default child qdiscs beyond initial real_num_tx are always
    pfifo_fast, no matter what the sysfs setting is. Fixing this
    gets a little tricky because we'd need to keep a reference
    on whatever the default qdisc was at the time of creation.
    In practice this is likely an non-issue the qdiscs likely have
    to be configured to non-default settings, so whatever user space
    is doing such configuration can replace the pfifos... now that
    it will see them.

    MIPS: lantiq: dma: reset correct number of channel
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ca9ce2ba4d5884cd94d1a856c675ab1242cd242 ]
    
    Different SoCs have a different number of channels, e.g .:
    * amazon-se has 10 channels,
    * danube+ar9 have 20 channels,
    * vr9 has 28 channels,
    * ar10 has 24 channels.
    
    We can read the ID register and, depending on the reported
    number of channels, reset the appropriate number of channels.

    Previously, `__query_block()` would fail if the
    second WCxx method call failed. However, the
    WQxx method might have succeeded, and potentially
    allocated memory for the result. Instead of
    throwing away the result and potentially
    leaking memory, ignore the result of
    the second WCxx call.

    rcutorture: Avoid problematic critical section nesting on PREEMPT_RT
    
    [ Upstream commit 71921a9606ddbcc1d98c00eca7ae82c373d1fecd ]
    
    rcutorture is generating some nesting scenarios that are not compatible on PREEMPT_RT.
    For example:
            preempt_disable();
            rcu_read_lock_bh();
            preempt_enable();
            rcu_read_unlock_bh();
    
    The problem here is that on PREEMPT_RT the bottom halves have to be
    disabled and enabled in preemptible context.
    
    Reorder locking: start with BH locking and continue with then with
    disabling preemption or interrupts. In the unlocking do it reverse by
    first enabling interrupts and preemption and BH at the very end.
    Ensure that on PREEMPT_RT BH locking remains unchanged if in
    non-preemptible context.

    In our case, there are two Thread A and B:
    
    Context: Thread A:              Context: Thread B:
    
    l2cap_chan_timeout()            __se_sys_shutdown()
      l2cap_chan_close()              l2cap_sock_shutdown()

          l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()        l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()
    
    Once l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() excuted, this sock will be marked as SOCK_ZAPPED,
    and can be treated as killable in l2cap_sock_kill() if sock_orphan() has
    excuted, at this time we close sock through sock_close() which end to call
    l2cap_sock_kill() like Thread C:
    
    Context: Thread C:
    
    sock_close()
      l2cap_sock_release()
        sock_orphan()
        l2cap_sock_kill()  #free sock if refcnt is 1
    
    If C completed, Once A or B reaches l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() again,
    use-after-free happened.
    
    We should set chan->data to NULL if sock is destructed, for telling teardown
    operation is not allowed in l2cap_sock_teardown_cb(), and also we should
    avoid killing an already killed socket in l2cap_sock_close_cb().

    Bluetooth: sco: Fix lock_sock() blockage by memcpy_from_msg()
    
    [ Upstream commit 99c23da0eed4fd20cae8243f2b51e10e66aa0951 ]
    
    The sco_send_frame() also takes lock_sock() during memcpy_from_msg()
    call that may be endlessly blocked by a task with userfaultd
    technique, and this will result in a hung task watchdog trigger.
    
    Just like the similar fix for hci_sock_sendmsg() in commit
    92c685dc5de0 ("Bluetooth: reorganize functions..."), this patch moves
    the  memcpy_from_msg() out of lock_sock() for addressing the hang.
    
    This should be the last piece for fixing CVE-2021-3640 after a few
    already queued fixes.

    [ Upstream commit 820a2ab23d5eab4ccfb82581eda8ad4acf18458f ]
    
    2 improvements to the Lenovo Ideapad D330 panel-orientation quirks:
    
    1. Some versions of the Lenovo Ideapad D330 have a DMI_PRODUCT_NAME of
    "81H3" and others have "81MD". Testing has shown that the "81MD" also has
    a 90 degree mounted panel. Drop the DMI_PRODUCT_NAME from the existing
    quirk so that the existing quirk matches both variants.
    
    2. Some of the Lenovo Ideapad D330 models have a HD (800x1280) screen
    instead of a FHD (1200x1920) screen (both are mounted right-side-up) add
    a second Lenovo Ideapad D330 quirk for the HD version.
    
    Changes in v2:
    - Add a new quirk for Lenovo Ideapad D330 models with a HD screen instead
      of a FHD screen

    dma-buf: WARN on dmabuf release with pending attachments
    
    [ Upstream commit f492283b157053e9555787262f058ae33096f568 ]
    
    It is expected from the clients to follow the below steps on an imported
    dmabuf fd:
    a) dmabuf = dma_buf_get(fd) // Get the dmabuf from fd
    b) dma_buf_attach(dmabuf); // Clients attach to the dmabuf
       o Here the kernel does some slab allocations, say for
    dma_buf_attachment and may be some other slab allocation in the
    dmabuf->ops->attach().
    c) Client may need to do dma_buf_map_attachment().
    d) Accordingly dma_buf_unmap_attachment() should be called.
    e) dma_buf_detach () // Clients detach to the dmabuf.
       o Here the slab allocations made in b) are freed.
    f) dma_buf_put(dmabuf) // Can free the dmabuf if it is the last
    reference.
    
    Now say an erroneous client failed at step c) above thus it directly
    called dma_buf_put(), step f) above. Considering that it may be the last
    reference to the dmabuf, buffer will be freed with pending attachments
    left to the dmabuf which can show up as the 'memory leak'. This should
    at least be reported as the WARN().

    component: do not leave master devres group open after bind
    
    commit c87761db2100677a69be551365105125d872af5b upstream.
    
    In current code, the devres group for aggregate master is left open
    after call to component_master_add_*(). This leads to problems when the
    master does further managed allocations on its own. When any
    participating driver calls component_del(), this leads to immediate
    release of resources.
    
    This came up when investigating a page fault occurring with i915 DRM
    driver unbind with 5.15-rc1 kernel. The following sequence occurs:
    
     i915_pci_remove()
       -> intel_display_driver_unregister()
         -> i915_audio_component_cleanup()
           -> component_del()
             -> component.c:take_down_master()
               -> hdac_component_master_unbind() [via master->ops->unbind()]
               -> devres_release_group(master->parent, NULL)
    
    With older kernels this has not caused issues, but with audio driver
    moving to use managed interfaces for more of its allocations, this no

    audio driver completes its PCI probe()

    So the "devres_release_group(master->parent, NULL)" ends up freeing the
    pcim_iomap allocation. Upon next runtime resume, the audio driver will
    cause a page fault as the iomap alloc was released without the driver
    knowing about it.
    
    Fix this issue by using the "struct master" pointer as identifier for
    the devres group, and by closing the devres group after
    the master->ops->bind() call is done. This allows devres allocations
    done by the driver acting as master to be isolated from the binding state
    of the aggregate driver. This modifies the logic originally introduced in
    commit 9e1ccb4a7700 ("drivers/base: fix devres handling for master device")

    power: supply: max17042_battery: Clear status bits in interrupt handler
    
    commit 0cf48167b87e388fa1268c9fe6d2443ae7f43d8a upstream.
    
    The gauge requires us to clear the status bits manually for some alerts
    to be properly dismissed. Previously the IRQ was configured to react only
    on falling edge, which wasn't technically correct (the ALRT line is active
    low), but it had a happy side-effect of preventing interrupt storms
    on uncleared alerts from happening.

    USB: chipidea: fix interrupt deadlock
    
    commit 9aaa81c3366e8393a62374e3a1c67c69edc07b8a upstream.
    
    Chipidea core was calling the interrupt handler from non-IRQ context
    with interrupts enabled, something which can lead to a deadlock if
    there's an actual interrupt trying to take a lock that's already held
    (e.g. the controller lock in udc_irq()).
    
    Add a wrapper that can be used to fake interrupts instead of calling the
    handler directly.

    Commit 868f3ee6e452 ("serial: 8250: Add 8250 port clock update method")
    added a hack to support SoCs where the UART reference clock can
    change behind the back of the driver but failed to add the proper
    locking.
    
    First, make sure to take a reference to the tty struct to avoid
    dereferencing a NULL pointer if the clock change races with a hangup.
    
    Second, the termios semaphore must be held during the update to prevent
    a racing termios change.

    iio: ad5770r: make devicetree property reading consistent
    
    commit 26df977a909f818b7d346b3990735513e7e0bf93 upstream.
    
    The bindings file for this driver is defining the property as 'reg' but
    the driver was reading it with the 'num' name. The bindings actually had
    the 'num' property when added in
    commit ea52c21268e6 ("dt-bindings: iio: dac: Add docs for AD5770R DAC")
    and then changed it to 'reg' in
    commit 2cf3818f18b2 ("dt-bindings: iio: dac: AD5570R fix bindings errors").
    However, both these commits landed in v5.7 so the assumption is
    that either 'num' is not being used or if it is, the validations were not
    done.
    
    Anyways, if someone comes back yelling about this, we might just support
    both of the properties in the future. Not ideal, but that's life...

    commit 558df982d4ead9cac628153d0d7b60feae05ddc8 upstream.
    
    On success i2c_master_send() returns the number of bytes written. The
    call from iio_write_channel_info(), however, expects the return value to
    be zero on success.
    
    This bug causes incorrect consumption of the sysfs buffer in
    iio_write_channel_info(). When writing more than two characters to
    out_voltage0_raw, the ad5446 write handler is called multiple times
    causing unexpected behavior.

    iio: buffer: Fix memory leak in iio_buffers_alloc_sysfs_and_mask()

    coresight: trbe: Defer the probe on offline CPUs
    
    commit a08025b3fe56185290a1ea476581f03ca733f967 upstream.
    
    If a CPU is offline during the driver init, we could end up causing
    a kernel crash trying to register the coresight device for the TRBE
    instance. The trbe_cpudata for the TRBE instance is initialized only
    when it is probed. Otherwise, we could end up dereferencing a NULL
    cpudata->drvdata.

    commit bb5293e334af51b19b62d8bef1852ea13e935e9b upstream.
    
    The TRBE driver wrongly treats the aux private data as the TRBE driver
    specific buffer for a given perf handle, while it is the ETM PMU's
    event specific data. Fix this by correcting the instance to use
    appropriate helper.

    cifs: set a minimum of 120s for next dns resolution
    
    commit 4ac0536f8874a903a72bddc57eb88db774261e3a upstream.
    
    With commit 506c1da44fee ("cifs: use the expiry output of dns_query to
    schedule next resolution") and after triggering the first reconnect,
    the next async dns resolution of tcp server's hostname would be
    scheduled based on dns_resolver's key expiry default, which happens to
    default to 5s on most systems that use key.dns_resolver for upcall.
    
    As per key.dns_resolver.conf(5):
    
           default_ttl=<number>
                  The  number  of  seconds  to  set  as the expiration on a cached
                  record.  This will be overridden if the program manages  to  re-
                  trieve  TTL  information along with the addresses (if, for exam-
                  ple, it accesses the DNS directly).  The default is  5  seconds.
                  The value must be in the range 1 to INT_MAX.
    
    Make the next async dns resolution no shorter than 120s as we do not
    want to be upcalling too often.

    commit 7be3248f313930ff3d3436d4e9ddbe9fccc1f541 upstream.
    
    We generally rely on a bunch of factors to differentiate between servers.
    For example, IP address, port etc.
    
    For certain server types (like Azure), it is important to make sure
    that the server hostname matches too, even if the both hostnames currently
    resolve to the same IP address.

    quota: check block number when reading the block in quota file
    
    commit 9bf3d20331295b1ecb81f4ed9ef358c51699a050 upstream.
    
    The block number in the quota tree on disk should be smaller than the
    v2_disk_dqinfo.dqi_blocks. If the quota file was corrupted, we may be
    allocating an 'allocated' block and that would lead to a loop in a tree,
    which will probably trigger oops later. This patch adds a check for the
    block number in the quota tree to prevent such potential issue.

    PCI: aardvark: Set PCI Bridge Class Code to PCI Bridge
    
    commit 84e1b4045dc887b78bdc87d92927093dc3a465aa upstream.
    
    Aardvark controller has something like config space of a Root Port
    available at offset 0x0 of internal registers - these registers are used
    for implementation of the emulated bridge.
    
    The default value of Class Code of this bridge corresponds to a RAID Mass
    storage controller, though. (This is probably intended for when the
    controller is used as Endpoint.)
    
    Change the Class Code to correspond to a PCI Bridge.
    
    Add comment explaining this change.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix support for PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_BUS_RESET on emulated bridge
    
    commit bc4fac42e5f8460af09c0a7f2f1915be09e20c71 upstream.
    
    Aardvark supports PCIe Hot Reset via PCIE_CORE_CTRL1_REG.
    
    Use it for implementing PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_BUS_RESET bit of PCI_BRIDGE_CONTROL
    register on emulated bridge.
    
    With this, the function pci_reset_secondary_bus() starts working and can
    reset connected PCIe card. Custom userspace script [1] which uses setpci
    can trigger PCIe Hot Reset and reset the card manually.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix support for bus mastering and PCI_COMMAND on emulated bridge
    
    commit 771153fc884f566a89af2d30033b7f3bc6e24e84 upstream.
    
    From very vague, ambiguous and incomplete information from Marvell we
    deduced that the 32-bit Aardvark register at address 0x4
    (PCIE_CORE_CMD_STATUS_REG), which is not documented for Root Complex mode
    in the Functional Specification (only for Endpoint mode), controls two
    16-bit PCIe registers: Command Register and Status Registers of PCIe Root
    Port.
    
    This means that bit 2 controls bus mastering and forwarding of memory and
    I/O requests in the upstream direction. According to PCI specifications
    bits [0:2] of Command Register, this should be by default disabled on
    reset. So explicitly disable these bits at early setup of the Aardvark
    driver.
    
    Remove code which unconditionally enables all 3 bits and let kernel code
    (via pci_set_master() function) to handle bus mastering of Root PCIe
    Bridge via emulated PCI_COMMAND on emulated bridge.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix configuring Reference clock
    
    commit 46ef6090dbf590711cb12680b6eafde5fa21fe87 upstream.
    
    Commit 366697018c9a ("PCI: aardvark: Add PHY support") introduced
    configuration of PCIe Reference clock via PCIE_CORE_REF_CLK_REG register,
    but did it incorrectly.
    
    PCIe Reference clock differential pair is routed from system board to
    endpoint card, so on CPU side it has output direction. Therefore it is
    required to enable transmitting and disable receiving.
    
    Default configuration according to Armada 3700 Functional Specifications is
    enabled receiver part and disabled transmitter.
    
    We need this change because otherwise PCIe Reference clock is configured to
    some undefined state when differential pair is used for both transmitting
    and receiving.
    
    Fix this by disabling receiver part.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix checking for link up via LTSSM state
    
    commit 661c399a651c11aaf83c45cbfe0b4a1fb7bc3179 upstream.
    
    Current implementation of advk_pcie_link_up() is wrong as it marks also
    link disabled or hot reset states as link up.
    
    Fix it by marking link up only to those states which are defined in PCIe
    Base specification 3.0, Table 4-14: Link Status Mapped to the LTSSM.
    
    To simplify implementation, Define macros for every LTSSM state which
    aardvark hardware can return in CFG_REG register.
    
    Fix also checking for link training according to the same Table 4-14.
    Define a new function advk_pcie_link_training() for this purpose.

    PCI: aardvark: Do not clear status bits of masked interrupts
    
    commit a7ca6d7fa3c02c032db5440ff392d96c04684c21 upstream.
    
    The PCIE_ISR1_REG says which interrupts are currently set / active,
    including those which are masked.
    
    The driver currently reads this register and looks if some unmasked
    interrupts are active, and if not, it clears status bits of _all_
    interrupts, including the masked ones.
    
    This is incorrect, since, for example, some drivers may poll these bits.
    
    Remove this clearing, and also remove this early return statement
    completely, since it does not change functionality in any way.

    commit 7a41ae80bdcb17e14dd7d83239b8a0cf368f18be upstream.
    
    The pci_bridge_emul_conf_write() function correctly clears W1C bits in

    about the clear request: the .write_op() method is given the value with

    W1C bits set, so that it can clear them.

    xen/balloon: add late_initcall_sync() for initial ballooning done
    
    commit 40fdea0284bb20814399da0484a658a96c735d90 upstream.
    
    When running as PVH or HVM guest with actual memory < max memory the
    hypervisor is using "populate on demand" in order to allow the guest
    to balloon down from its maximum memory size. For this to work
    correctly the guest must not touch more memory pages than its target
    memory size as otherwise the PoD cache will be exhausted and the guest
    is crashed as a result of that.
    
    In extreme cases ballooning down might not be finished today before
    the init process is started, which can consume lots of memory.
    
    In order to avoid random boot crashes in such cases, add a late init
    call to wait for ballooning down having finished for PVH/HVM guests.
    
    Warn on console if initial ballooning fails, panic() after stalling
    for more than 3 minutes per default. Add a module parameter for
    changing this timeout.

    serial: core: Fix initializing and restoring termios speed
    
    commit 027b57170bf8bb6999a28e4a5f3d78bf1db0f90c upstream.
    
    Since commit edc6afc54968 ("tty: switch to ktermios and new framework")
    termios speed is no longer stored only in c_cflag member but also in new
    additional c_ispeed and c_ospeed members. If BOTHER flag is set in c_cflag
    then termios speed is stored only in these new members.
    
    Therefore to correctly restore termios speed it is required to store also
    ispeed and ospeed members, not only cflag member.
    
    In case only cflag member with BOTHER flag is restored then functions
    tty_termios_baud_rate() and tty_termios_input_baud_rate() returns baudrate
    stored in c_ospeed / c_ispeed member, which is zero as it was not restored
    too. If reported baudrate is invalid (e.g. zero) then serial core functions
    report fallback baudrate value 9600. So it means that in this case original
    baudrate is lost and kernel changes it to value 9600.
    
    Simple reproducer of this issue is to boot kernel with following command
    line argument: "console=ttyXXX,86400" (where ttyXXX is the device name).
    For speed 86400 there is no Bnnn constant and therefore kernel has to
    represent this speed via BOTHER c_cflag. Which means that speed is stored
    only in c_ospeed and c_ispeed members, not in c_cflag anymore.
    
    If bootloader correctly configures serial device to speed 86400 then kernel
    prints boot log to early console at speed speed 86400 without any issue.
    But after kernel starts initializing real console device ttyXXX then speed
    is changed to fallback value 9600 because information about speed was lost.
    
    This patch fixes above issue by storing and restoring also ispeed and
    ospeed members, which are required for BOTHER flag.

    ring-buffer: Protect ring_buffer_reset() from reentrancy
    
    commit 51d157946666382e779f94c39891e8e9a020da78 upstream.
    
    The resetting of the entire ring buffer use to simply go through and reset
    each individual CPU buffer that had its own protection and synchronization.
    But this was very slow, due to performing a synchronization for each CPU.
    The code was reshuffled to do one disabling of all CPU buffers, followed
    by a single RCU synchronization, and then the resetting of each of the CPU
    buffers. But unfortunately, the mutex that prevented multiple occurrences
    of resetting the buffer was not moved to the upper function, and there is
    nothing to protect from it.
    
    Take the ring buffer mutex around the global reset.

    KVM: nVMX: Handle dynamic MSR intercept toggling
    
    commit 67f4b9969c305be515e47f809ecacfd86bd20a9c upstream.
    
    Always check vmcs01's MSR bitmap when merging L0 and L1 bitmaps for L2,
    and always update the relevant bits in vmcs02.  This fixes two distinct,
    but intertwined bugs related to dynamic MSR bitmap modifications.
    
    The first issue is that KVM fails to enable MSR interception in vmcs02
    for the FS/GS base MSRs if L1 first runs L2 with interception disabled,
    and later enables interception.
    
    The second issue is that KVM fails to honor userspace MSR filtering when
    preparing vmcs02.
    
    Fix both issues simultaneous as fixing only one of the issues (doesn't
    matter which) would create a mess that no one should have to bisect.
    Fixing only the first bug would exacerbate the MSR filtering issue as
    userspace would see inconsistent behavior depending on the whims of L1.
    Fixing only the second bug (MSR filtering) effectively requires fixing
    the first, as the nVMX code only knows how to transition vmcs02's
    bitmap from 1->0.
    
    Move the various accessor/mutators that are currently buried in vmx.c
    into vmx.h so that they can be shared by the nested code.

    KVM: nVMX: Query current VMCS when determining if MSR bitmaps are in use
    
    commit 7dfbc624eb5726367900c8d86deff50836240361 upstream.
    
    Check the current VMCS controls to determine if an MSR write will be
    intercepted due to MSR bitmaps being disabled.  In the nested VMX case,
    KVM will disable MSR bitmaps in vmcs02 if they're disabled in vmcs12 or
    if KVM can't map L1's bitmaps for whatever reason.
    
    Note, the bad behavior is relatively benign in the current code base as
    KVM sets all bits in vmcs02's MSR bitmap by default, clears bits if and
    only if L0 KVM also disables interception of an MSR, and only uses the
    buggy helper for MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL.  Because KVM explicitly tests WRMSR
    before disabling interception of MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL, the flawed check
    will only result in KVM reading MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL from hardware when it
    isn't strictly necessary.
    
    Tag the fix for stable in case a future fix wants to use
    msr_write_intercepted(), in which case a buggy implementation in older
    kernels could prove subtly problematic.

    KVM: x86: Fix recording of guest steal time / preempted status
    
    commit 7e2175ebd695f17860c5bd4ad7616cce12ed4591 upstream.
    
    In commit b043138246a4 ("x86/KVM: Make sure KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB flag is
    not missed") we switched to using a gfn_to_pfn_cache for accessing the
    guest steal time structure in order to allow for an atomic xchg of the
    preempted field. This has a couple of problems.
    
    Firstly, kvm_map_gfn() doesn't work at all for IOMEM pages when the
    atomic flag is set, which it is in kvm_steal_time_set_preempted(). So a
    guest vCPU using an IOMEM page for its steal time would never have its
    preempted field set.
    
    Secondly, the gfn_to_pfn_cache is not invalidated in all cases where it
    should have been. There are two stages to the GFN->PFN conversion;
    first the GFN is converted to a userspace HVA, and then that HVA is
    looked up in the process page tables to find the underlying host PFN.
    Correct invalidation of the latter would require being hooked up to the
    MMU notifiers, but that doesn't happen---so it just keeps mapping and
    unmapping the *wrong* PFN after the userspace page tables change.
    
    In the !IOMEM case at least the stale page *is* pinned all the time it's
    cached, so it won't be freed and reused by anyone else while still
    receiving the steal time updates. The map/unmap dance only takes care
    of the KVM administrivia such as marking the page dirty.
    
    Until the gfn_to_pfn cache handles the remapping automatically by
    integrating with the MMU notifiers, we might as well not get a
    kernel mapping of it, and use the perfectly serviceable userspace HVA
    that we already have.  We just need to implement the atomic xchg on
    the userspace address with appropriate exception handling, which is
    fairly trivial.

    KVM: arm64: Extract ESR_ELx.EC only
    
    commit 8bb084119f1acc2ec55ea085a97231e3ddb30782 upstream.
    
    Since ARMv8.0 the upper 32 bits of ESR_ELx have been RES0, and recently
    some of the upper bits gained a meaning and can be non-zero. For
    example, when FEAT_LS64 is implemented, ESR_ELx[36:32] contain ISS2,
    which for an ST64BV or ST64BV0 can be non-zero. This can be seen in ARM
    DDI 0487G.b, page D13-3145, section D13.2.37.
    
    Generally, we must not rely on RES0 bit remaining zero in future, and
    when extracting ESR_ELx.EC we must mask out all other bits.
    
    All C code uses the ESR_ELx_EC() macro, which masks out the irrelevant
    bits, and therefore no alterations are required to C code to avoid
    consuming irrelevant bits.
    
    In a couple of places the KVM assembly extracts ESR_ELx.EC using LSR on
    an X register, and so could in theory consume previously RES0 bits. In
    both cases this is for comparison with EC values ESR_ELx_EC_HVC32 and
    ESR_ELx_EC_HVC64, for which the upper bits of ESR_ELx must currently be
    zero, but this could change in future.
    
    This patch adjusts the KVM vectors to use UBFX rather than LSR to
    extract ESR_ELx.EC, ensuring these are robust to future additions to
    ESR_ELx.

    Set iio_dev_opaque->groups to NULL when it's freed to fix this double free.
    
    Not this is a local work around for a more general mess around life time
    management that will get cleaned up and should make this handling
    unnecesarry.

    power: supply: max17042_battery: use VFSOC for capacity when no rsns
    
    commit 223a3b82834f036a62aa831f67cbf1f1d644c6e2 upstream.
    
    On Galaxy S3 (i9300/i9305), which has the max17047 fuel gauge and no
    current sense resistor (rsns), the RepSOC register does not provide an
    accurate state of charge value. The reported value is wrong, and does
    not change over time. VFSOC however, which uses the voltage fuel gauge
    to determine the state of charge, always shows an accurate value.
    
    For devices without current sense, VFSOC is already used for the
    soc-alert (0x0003 is written to MiscCFG register), so with this change
    the source of the alert and the PROP_CAPACITY value match.

    mtd: rawnand: socrates: Keep the driver compatible with on-die ECC engines
    
    commit b4ebddd6540d78a7f977b3fea0261bd575c6ffe2 upstream.
    
    Following the introduction of the generic ECC engine infrastructure, it
    was necessary to reorganize the code and move the ECC configuration in
    the ->attach_chip() hook. Failing to do that properly lead to a first
    series of fixes supposed to stabilize the situation. Unfortunately, this
    only fixed the use of software ECC engines, preventing any other kind of
    engine to be used, including on-die ones.
    
    It is now time to (finally) fix the situation by ensuring that we still
    provide a default (eg. software ECC) but will still support different
    ECC engines such as on-die ECC engines if properly described in the
    device tree.
    
    There are no changes needed on the core side in order to do this, but we
    just need to leverage the logic there which allows:
    1- a subsystem default (set to Host engines in the raw NAND world)
    2- a driver specific default (here set to software ECC engines)
    3- any type of engine requested by the user (ie. described in the DT)
    
    As the raw NAND subsystem has not yet been fully converted to the ECC
    engine infrastructure, in order to provide a default ECC engine for this
    driver we need to set chip->ecc.engine_type *before* calling
    nand_scan(). During the initialization step, the core will consider this
    entry as the default engine for this driver. This value may of course
    be overloaded by the user if the usual DT properties are provided.

    signal/mips: Update (_save|_restore)_fp_context to fail with -EFAULT
    
    commit 95bf9d646c3c3f95cb0be7e703b371db8da5be68 upstream.
    
    When an instruction to save or restore a register from the stack fails
    in _save_fp_context or _restore_fp_context return with -EFAULT.  This
    change was made to r2300_fpu.S[1] but it looks like it got lost with
    the introduction of EX2[2].  This is also what the other implementation
    of _save_fp_context and _restore_fp_context in r4k_fpu.S does, and
    what is needed for the callers to be able to handle the error.
    
    Furthermore calling do_exit(SIGSEGV) from bad_stack is wrong because
    it does not terminate the entire process it just terminates a single
    thread.
    
    As the changed code was the only caller of arch/mips/kernel/syscall.c:bad_stack
    remove the problematic and now unused helper function.

    memory: renesas-rpc-if: Correct QSPI data transfer in Manual mode
    
    commit fff53a551db50f5edecaa0b29a64056ab8d2bbca upstream.
    
    This patch fixes 2 problems:
    [1] The output warning logs and data loss when performing
    mount/umount then remount the device with jffs2 format.
    [2] The access width of SMWDR[0:1]/SMRDR[0:1] register is wrong.
    
    This is the sample warning logs when performing mount/umount then
    remount the device with jffs2 format:
    jffs2: jffs2_scan_inode_node(): CRC failed on node at 0x031c51d4:
    Read 0x00034e00, calculated 0xadb272a7
    
    The reason for issue [1] is that the writing data seems to
    get messed up.
    Data is only completed when the number of bytes is divisible by 4.
    If you only have 3 bytes of data left to write, 1 garbage byte
    is inserted after the end of the write stream.
    If you only have 2 bytes of data left to write, 2 bytes of '00'
    are added into the write stream.
    If you only have 1 byte of data left to write, 2 bytes of '00'
    are added into the write stream. 1 garbage byte is inserted after
    the end of the write stream.
    
    To solve problem [1], data must be written continuously in serial
    and the write stream ends when data is out.
    
    Following HW manual 62.2.15, access to SMWDR0 register should be
    in the same size as the transfer size specified in the SPIDE[3:0]
    bits in the manual mode enable setting register (SMENR).
    Be sure to access from address 0.
    
    So, in 16-bit transfer (SPIDE[3:0]=b'1100), SMWDR0 should be
    accessed by 16-bit width.
    Similar to SMWDR1, SMDDR0/1 registers.
    In current code, SMWDR0 register is accessed by regmap_write()
    that only set up to do 32-bit width.
    
    To solve problem [2], data must be written 16-bit or 8-bit when
    transferring 1-byte or 2-byte.

    signal: Remove the bogus sigkill_pending in ptrace_stop
    
    commit 7d613f9f72ec8f90ddefcae038fdae5adb8404b3 upstream.
    
    The existence of sigkill_pending is a little silly as it is
    functionally a duplicate of fatal_signal_pending that is used in
    exactly one place.
    
    Checking for pending fatal signals and returning early in ptrace_stop
    is actively harmful.  It casues the ptrace_stop called by
    ptrace_signal to return early before setting current->exit_code.
    Later when ptrace_signal reads the signal number from
    current->exit_code is undefined, making it unpredictable what will
    happen.
    
    Instead rely on the fact that schedule will not sleep if there is a
    pending signal that can awaken a task.
    
    Removing the explict sigkill_pending test fixes fixes ptrace_signal
    when ptrace_stop does not stop because current->exit_code is always
    set to to signr.

    rsi: Fix module dev_oper_mode parameter description
    
    commit 31f97cf9f0c31143a2a6fcc89c4a1286ce20157e upstream.
    
    The module parameters are missing dev_oper_mode 12, BT classic alone,
    add it. Moreover, the parameters encode newlines, which ends up being
    printed malformed e.g. by modinfo, so fix that too.
    
    However, the module parameter string is duplicated in both USB and SDIO
    modules and the dev_oper_mode mode enumeration in those module parameters
    is a duplicate of macros used by the driver. Furthermore, the enumeration
    is confusing.
    
    So, deduplicate the module parameter string and use __stringify() to
    encode the correct mode enumeration values into the module parameter
    string. Finally, replace 'Wi-Fi' with 'Wi-Fi alone' and 'BT' with
    'BT classic alone' to clarify what those modes really mean.

    rsi: fix rate mask set leading to P2P failure
    
    commit b515d097053a71d624e0c5840b42cd4caa653941 upstream.
    
    P2P client mode was only working the first time.
    On subsequent connection attempts the group was successfully created but
    no data was sent (no transmitted data packets were seen with a sniffer).
    
    The reason for this was that the hardware was being configured in fixed
    rate mode with rate RSI_RATE_1 (1Mbps) which is not valid in the 5GHz band.
    
    In P2P mode wpa_supplicant uses NL80211_CMD_SET_TX_BITRATE_MASK to disallow
    the 11b rates in the 2.4GHz band which updated common->fixedrate_mask.
    
    rsi_set_min_rate() then used the fixedrate_mask to calculate the minimum
    allowed rate, or 0xffff = auto if none was found.
    However that calculation did not account for the different rate sets
    allowed in the different bands leading to the error.
    
    Fixing set_min_rate() would result in 6Mb/s being used all the time
    which is not what we want either.
    
    The reason the problem did not occur on the first connection is that
    rsi_mac80211_set_rate_mask() only updated the fixedrate_mask for
    the *current* band. When it was called that was still 2.4GHz as the
    switch is done later. So the when set_min_rate() was subsequently
    called after the switch to 5GHz it still had a mask of zero, leading
    to defaulting to auto mode.
    
    Fix this by differentiating the case of a single rate being
    requested, in which case the hardware will be used in fixed rate
    mode with just that rate, and multiple rates being requested,
    in which case we remain in auto mode but the firmware rate selection
    algorithm is configured with a restricted set of rates.

    rsi: fix key enabled check causing unwanted encryption for vap_id > 0
    
    commit 99ac6018821253ec67f466086afb63fc18ea48e2 upstream.
    
    My previous patch checked if encryption should be enabled by directly
    checking info->control.hw_key (like the downstream driver).
    However that missed that the control and driver_info members of
    struct ieee80211_tx_info are union fields.
    
    Due to this when rsi_core_xmit() updates fields in "tx_params"
    (driver_info) it can overwrite the control.hw_key, causing the result
    of the later test to be incorrect.
    
    With the current structure layout the first byte of control.hw_key is
    overlayed with the vap_id so, since we only test if control.hw_key is
    NULL / non NULL, a non zero vap_id will incorrectly enable encryption.
    
    In basic STA and AP modes the vap_id is always zero so it works but in
    P2P client mode a second VIF is created causing vap_id to be non zero
    and hence encryption to be enabled before keys have been set.
    
    Fix this by extracting the key presence flag to a new field in the driver
    private tx_params structure and populating it first.

    rsi: fix occasional initialisation failure with BT coex
    
    commit 9b14ed6e11b72dd4806535449ca6c6962cb2369d upstream.
    
    When BT coexistence is enabled (eg oper mode 13, which is the default)
    the initialisation on startup sometimes silently fails.
    
    In a normal initialisation we see
            usb 1-1.3: Product: Wireless USB Network Module
            usb 1-1.3: Manufacturer: Redpine Signals, Inc.

            rsi_91x: Max Stations Allowed = 1
    
    But sometimes the last log is missing and the wlan net device is
    not created.
    
    Running a userspace loop that resets the hardware via a GPIO shows the
    problem occurring ~5/100 resets.
    
    The problem does not occur in oper mode 1 (wifi only).
    
    Adding logs shows that the initialisation state machine requests a MAC
    reset via rsi_send_reset_mac() but the firmware does not reply, leading
    to the initialisation sequence being incomplete.
    
    Fix this by delaying attaching the BT adapter until the wifi
    initialisation has completed.
    
    With this applied I have done > 300 reset loops with no errors.

    libata: fix checking of DMA state
    
    commit f971a85439bd25dc7b4d597cf5e4e8dc7ffc884b upstream.
    
    Checking if DMA is enabled should be done via the
    ata_dma_enabled helper function, since the init state
    0xff indicates disabled.
    This meant that ATA_CMD_READ_LOG_DMA_EXT was used and probed
    for before DMA was enabled, which caused hangs for some combinations
    of controllers and devices.
    It might also have caused it to be incorrectly disabled as broken,
    but there have been no reports of that.

    mwifiex: Try waking the firmware until we get an interrupt
    
    commit 8e3e59c31fea5de95ffc52c46f0c562c39f20c59 upstream.
    
    It seems that the PCIe+USB firmware (latest version 15.68.19.p21) of the
    88W8897 card sometimes ignores or misses when we try to wake it up by
    writing to the firmware status register. This leads to the firmware
    wakeup timeout expiring and the driver resetting the card because we
    assume the firmware has hung up or crashed.
    
    Turns out that the firmware actually didn't hang up, but simply "missed"
    our wakeup request and didn't send us an interrupt with an AWAKE event.
    
    Trying again to read the firmware status register after a short timeout
    usually makes the firmware wake up as expected, so add a small retry
    loop to mwifiex_pm_wakeup_card() that looks at the interrupt status to
    check whether the card woke up.
    
    The number of tries and timeout lengths for this were determined
    experimentally: The firmware usually takes about 500 us to wake up
    after we attempt to read the status register. In some cases where the
    firmware is very busy (for example while doing a bluetooth scan) it
    might even miss our requests for multiple milliseconds, which is why
    after 15 tries the waiting time gets increased to 10 ms. The maximum
    number of tries it took to wake the firmware when testing this was
    around 20, so a maximum number of 50 tries should give us plenty of
    safety margin.
    
    Here's a reproducer for those firmware wakeup failures I've found:
    
    1) Make sure wifi powersaving is enabled (iw dev wlp1s0 set power_save on)
    2) Connect to any wifi network (makes firmware go into wifi powersaving
    mode, not deep sleep)
    3) Make sure bluetooth is turned off (to ensure the firmware actually
    enters powersave mode and doesn't keep the radio active doing bluetooth
    stuff)
    4) To confirm that wifi powersaving is entered ping a device on the LAN,
    pings should be a few ms higher than without powersaving
    5) Run "while true; do iwconfig; sleep 0.0001; done", this wakes and
    suspends the firmware extremely often
    6) Wait until things explode, for me it consistently takes <5 minutes

    mwifiex: Read a PCI register after writing the TX ring write pointer
    
    commit e5f4eb8223aa740237cd463246a7debcddf4eda1 upstream.
    
    On the 88W8897 PCIe+USB card the firmware randomly crashes after setting
    the TX ring write pointer. The issue is present in the latest firmware
    version 15.68.19.p21 of the PCIe+USB card.
    
    Those firmware crashes can be worked around by reading any PCI register
    of the card after setting that register, so read the PCI_VENDOR_ID
    register here. The reason this works is probably because we keep the bus
    from entering an ASPM state for a bit longer, because that's what causes
    the cards firmware to crash.
    
    This fixes a bug where during RX/TX traffic and with ASPM L1 substates
    enabled (the specific substates where the issue happens appear to be
    platform dependent), the firmware crashes and eventually a command
    timeout appears in the logs.

    PM: sleep: Do not let "syscore" devices runtime-suspend during system transitions
    
    commit 928265e3601cde78c7e0a3e518a93b27defed3b1 upstream.
    
    There is no reason to allow "syscore" devices to runtime-suspend
    during system-wide PM transitions, because they are subject to the
    same possible failure modes as any other devices in that respect.
    
    Accordingly, change device_prepare() and device_complete() to call
    pm_runtime_get_noresume() and pm_runtime_put(), respectively, for
    "syscore" devices too.

    wcn36xx: Fix (QoS) null data frame bitrate/modulation
    
    commit d3fd2c95c1c13ec217d43ebef3c61cfa00a6cd37 upstream.
    
    We observe unexpected connection drops with some APs due to
    non-acked mac80211 generated null data frames (keep-alive).
    After debugging and capture, we noticed that null frames are
    submitted at standard data bitrate and that the given APs are
    in trouble with that.
    
    After setting the null frame bitrate to control bitrate, all
    null frames are acked as expected and connection is maintained.
    
    Not sure if it's a requirement of the specification, but it seems
    the right thing to do anyway, null frames are mostly used for control
    purpose (power-saving, keep-alive...), and submitting them with
    a slower/simpler bitrate/modulation is more robust.

    wcn36xx: Fix tx_status mechanism
    
    commit a9e79b116cc4d0057e912be8f40b2c2e5bdc7c43 upstream.
    
    This change fix the TX ack mechanism in various ways:
    
    - For NO_ACK tagged packets, we don't need to wait for TX_ACK indication
    and so are not subject to the single packet ack limitation. So we don't
    have to stop the tx queue, and can call the tx status callback as soon
    as DMA transfer has completed.
    
    - Fix skb ownership/reference. Only start status indication timeout
    once the DMA transfer has been completed. This avoids the skb to be
    both referenced in the DMA tx ring and by the tx_ack_skb pointer,
    preventing any use-after-free or double-free.
    
    - This adds a sanity (paranoia?) check on the skb tx ack pointer.
    
    - Resume TX queue if TX status tagged packet TX fails.

    HID: surface-hid: Use correct event registry for managing HID events
    
    commit dc0fd0acb6e0e8025a0a43ada54513b216254fac upstream.
    
    Until now, we have only ever seen the REG-category registry being used
    on devices addressed with target ID 2. In fact, we have only ever seen
    Surface Aggregator Module (SAM) HID devices with target ID 2. For those
    devices, the registry also has to be addressed with target ID 2.
    
    Some devices, like the new Surface Laptop Studio, however, address their
    HID devices on target ID 1. As a result of this, any target ID 2
    commands time out. This includes event management commands addressed to
    the target ID 2 REG-category registry. For these devices, the registry
    has to be addressed via target ID 1 instead.
    
    We therefore assume that the target ID of the registry to be used
    depends on the target ID of the respective device. Implement this
    accordingly.
    
    Note that we currently allow the surface HID driver to only load against
    devices with target ID 2, so these timeouts are not happening (yet).
    This is just a preparation step before we allow the driver to load
    against all target IDs.

    fail.

    regulator: s5m8767: do not use reset value as DVS voltage if GPIO DVS is disabled
    
    commit b16bef60a9112b1e6daf3afd16484eb06e7ce792 upstream.
    
    The driver and its bindings, before commit 04f9f068a619 ("regulator:
    s5m8767: Modify parsing method of the voltage table of buck2/3/4") were
    requiring to provide at least one safe/default voltage for DVS registers
    if DVS GPIO is not being enabled.
    
    IOW, if s5m8767,pmic-buck2-uses-gpio-dvs is missing, the
    s5m8767,pmic-buck2-dvs-voltage should still be present and contain one
    voltage.
    
    This requirement was coming from driver behavior matching this condition
    (none of DVS GPIO is enabled): it was always initializing the DVS
    selector pins to 0 and keeping the DVS enable setting at reset value
    (enabled).  Therefore if none of DVS GPIO is enabled in devicetree,
    driver was configuring the first DVS voltage for buck[234].
    
    Mentioned commit 04f9f068a619 ("regulator: s5m8767: Modify parsing
    method of the voltage table of buck2/3/4") broke it because DVS voltage
    won't be parsed from devicetree if DVS GPIO is not enabled.  After the
    change, driver will configure bucks to use the register reset value as
    voltage which might have unpleasant effects.
    
    Fix this by relaxing the bindings constrain: if DVS GPIO is not enabled
    in devicetree (therefore DVS voltage is also not parsed), explicitly
    disable it.

    md/raid1: only allocate write behind bio for WriteMostly device
    
    commit fd3b6975e9c11c4fa00965f82a0bfbb3b7b44101 upstream.
    
    Commit 6607cd319b6b91bff94e90f798a61c031650b514 ("raid1: ensure write
    behind bio has less than BIO_MAX_VECS sectors") tried to guarantee the
    size of behind bio is not bigger than BIO_MAX_VECS sectors.
    
    Unfortunately the same calltrace still could happen since an array could
    enable write-behind without write mostly device.
    
    To match the manpage of mdadm (which says "write-behind is only attempted
    on drives marked as write-mostly"), we need to check WriteMostly flag to
    avoid such unexpected behavior.

    selinux: fix race condition when computing ocontext SIDs
    
    commit cbfcd13be5cb2a07868afe67520ed181956579a7 upstream.
    
    Current code contains a lot of racy patterns when converting an
    ocontext's context structure to an SID. This is being done in a "lazy"
    fashion, such that the SID is looked up in the SID table only when it's
    first needed and then cached in the "sid" field of the ocontext
    structure. However, this is done without any locking or memory barriers
    and is thus unsafe.
    
    Between commits 24ed7fdae669 ("selinux: use separate table for initial
    SID lookup") and 66f8e2f03c02 ("selinux: sidtab reverse lookup hash
    table"), this race condition lead to an actual observable bug, because a
    pointer to the shared sid field was passed directly to
    sidtab_context_to_sid(), which was using this location to also store an
    intermediate value, which could have been read by other threads and
    interpreted as an SID. In practice this caused e.g. new mounts to get a
    wrong (seemingly random) filesystem context, leading to strange denials.
    This bug has been spotted in the wild at least twice, see [1] and [2].
    
    Fix the race condition by making all the racy functions use a common
    helper that ensures the ocontext::sid accesses are made safely using the
    appropriate SMP constructs.
    
    Note that security_netif_sid() was populating the sid field of both
    contexts stored in the ocontext, but only the first one was actually
    used. The SELinux wiki's documentation on the "netifcon" policy
    statement [3] suggests that using only the first context is intentional.
    I kept only the handling of the first context here, as there is really
    no point in doing the SID lookup for the unused one.
    
    I wasn't able to reproduce the bug mentioned above on any kernel that
    includes commit 66f8e2f03c02, even though it has been reported that the
    issue occurs with that commit, too, just less frequently. Thus, I wasn't
    able to verify that this patch fixes the issue, but it makes sense to
    avoid the race condition regardless.

    KVM: PPC: Tick accounting should defer vtime accounting 'til after IRQ handling
    
    commit 235cee162459d96153d63651ce7ff51752528c96 upstream.
    
    Commit 112665286d08 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Context tracking exit guest
    context before enabling irqs") moved guest_exit() into the interrupt
    protected area to avoid wrong context warning (or worse). The problem is
    that tick-based time accounting has not yet been updated at this point
    (because it depends on the timer interrupt firing), so the guest time
    gets incorrectly accounted to system time.
    
    To fix the problem, follow the x86 fix in commit 160457140187 ("Defer
    vtime accounting 'til after IRQ handling"), and allow host IRQs to run
    before accounting the guest exit time.
    
    In the case vtime accounting is enabled, this is not required because TB
    is used directly for accounting.
    
    Before this patch, with CONFIG_TICK_CPU_ACCOUNTING=y in the host and a
    guest running a kernel compile, the 'guest' fields of /proc/stat are
    stuck at zero. With the patch they can be observed increasing roughly as
    expected.

    btrfs: call btrfs_check_rw_degradable only if there is a missing device
    
    commit 5c78a5e7aa835c4f08a7c90fe02d19f95a776f29 upstream.
    
    In open_ctree() in btrfs_check_rw_degradable() [1], we check each block
    group individually if at least the minimum number of devices is available
    for that profile. If all the devices are available, then we don't have to
    check degradable.
    
    [1]
    open_ctree()
    ::
    3559 if (!sb_rdonly(sb) && !btrfs_check_rw_degradable(fs_info, NULL)) {
    
    Also before calling btrfs_check_rw_degradable() in open_ctee() at the
    line number shown below [2] we call btrfs_read_chunk_tree() and down to
    add_missing_dev() to record number of missing devices.
    
    [2]
    open_ctree()
    ::
    3454         ret = btrfs_read_chunk_tree(fs_info);
    
    btrfs_read_chunk_tree()
      read_one_chunk() / read_one_dev()
        add_missing_dev()
    
    So, check if there is any missing device before btrfs_check_rw_degradable()
    in open_ctree().
    
    Also, with this the mount command could save ~16ms.[3] in the most
    common case, that is no device is missing.

    btrfs: fix lost error handling when replaying directory deletes
    
    commit 10adb1152d957a4d570ad630f93a88bb961616c1 upstream.
    
    At replay_dir_deletes(), if find_dir_range() returns an error we break out
    of the main while loop and then assign a value of 0 (success) to the 'ret'
    variable, resulting in completely ignoring that an error happened. Fix
    that by jumping to the 'out' label when find_dir_range() returns an error
    (negative value).

    btrfs: clear MISSING device status bit in btrfs_close_one_device
    
    commit 5d03dbebba2594d2e6fbf3b5dd9060c5a835de3b upstream.
    
    Reported bug: https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/issues/389
    
    There's a problem with scrub reporting aborted status but returning
    error code 0, on a filesystem with missing and readded device.
    
    Roughly these steps:
    
    - mkfs -d raid1 dev1 dev2
    - fill with data
    - unmount
    - make dev1 disappear
    - mount -o degraded
    - copy more data
    - make dev1 appear again
    
    Running scrub afterwards reports that the command was aborted, but the
    system log message says the exit code was 0.
    
    It seems that the cause of the error is decrementing
    fs_devices->missing_devices but not clearing device->dev_state.  Every
    time we umount filesystem, it would call close_ctree, And it would
    eventually involve btrfs_close_one_device to close the device, but it
    only decrements fs_devices->missing_devices but does not clear the
    device BTRFS_DEV_STATE_MISSING bit. Worse, this bug will cause Integer
    Overflow, because every time umount, fs_devices->missing_devices will
    decrease. If fs_devices->missing_devices value hit 0, it would overflow.
    
    With added debugging:

    MTU change is refused whenever the value of new MTU is bigger than

    However, an eBPF program doesn't always need to access the whole
    packet data.
    
    The maximum direct packet access (DPA) offset has always been
    caculated by verifier and stored in the max_pkt_offset field of prog

    Currently, the workqueue of hclge/hclgevf is executed on
    the CPU that initiates scheduling requests by default. In
    stress scenarios, the CPU may be busy and workqueue scheduling
    is completed after a long period of time. To avoid this
    situation and implement proper scheduling, use the WQ_UNBOUND
    mode instead. In this way, the workqueue can be performed on
    a relatively idle CPU.

    block: schedule queue restart after BLK_STS_ZONE_RESOURCE
    
    [ Upstream commit 9586e67b911c95ba158fcc247b230e9c2d718623 ]
    
    When dispatching a zone append write request to a SCSI zoned block device,
    if the target zone of the request is already locked, the device driver will
    return BLK_STS_ZONE_RESOURCE and the request will be pushed back to the
    hctx dipatch queue. The queue will be marked as RESTART in
    dd_finish_request() and restarted in __blk_mq_free_request(). However, this
    restart applies to the hctx of the completed request. If the requeued
    request is on a different hctx, dispatch will no be retried until another
    request is submitted or the next periodic queue run triggers, leading to up
    to 30 seconds latency for the requeued request.
    
    Fix this problem by scheduling a queue restart similarly to the
    BLK_STS_RESOURCE case or when we cannot get the budget.
    
    Also, consolidate the checks into the "need_resource" variable to simplify
    the condition.

    net: multicast: calculate csum of looped-back and forwarded packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 9122a70a6333705c0c35614ddc51c274ed1d3637 ]
    
    During a testing of an user-space application which transmits UDP
    multicast datagrams and utilizes multicast routing to send the UDP
    datagrams out of defined network interfaces, I've found a multicast
    router does not fill-in UDP checksum into locally produced, looped-back
    and forwarded UDP datagrams, if an original output NIC the datagrams
    are sent to has UDP TX checksum offload enabled.
    
    The datagrams are sent malformed out of the NIC the datagrams have been
    forwarded to.
    
    It is because:
    
    1. If TX checksum offload is enabled on the output NIC, UDP checksum
       is not calculated by kernel and is not filled into skb data.
    
    2. dev_loopback_xmit(), which is called solely by
       ip_mc_finish_output(), sets skb->ip_summed = CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY
       unconditionally.
    
    3. Since 35fc92a9 ("[NET]: Allow forwarding of ip_summed except
       CHECKSUM_COMPLETE"), the ip_summed value is preserved during
       forwarding.
    
    4. If ip_summed != CHECKSUM_PARTIAL, checksum is not calculated during
       a packet egress.
    
    The minimum fix in dev_loopback_xmit():
    
    1. Preserves skb->ip_summed CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. This is the
       case when the original output NIC has TX checksum offload enabled.
       The effects are:
    
         a) If the forwarding destination interface supports TX checksum
            offloading, the NIC driver is responsible to fill-in the
            checksum.
    
         b) If the forwarding destination interface does NOT support TX
            checksum offloading, checksums are filled-in by kernel before
            skb is submitted to the NIC driver.
    
         c) For local delivery, checksum validation is skipped as in the
            case of CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY, thanks to skb_csum_unnecessary().
    
    2. Translates ip_summed CHECKSUM_NONE to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY. It
       means, for CHECKSUM_NONE, the behavior is unmodified and is there
       to skip a looped-back packet local delivery checksum validation.

    xen/netfront: stop tx queues during live migration
    
    [ Upstream commit 042b2046d0f05cf8124c26ff65dbb6148a4404fb ]
    
    The tx queues are not stopped during the live migration. As a result, the
    ndo_start_xmit() may access netfront_info->queues which is freed by
    talk_to_netback()->xennet_destroy_queues().
    
    This patch is to netif_device_detach() at the beginning of xen-netfront
    resuming, and netif_device_attach() at the end of resuming.
    
         CPU A                                CPU B
    
     talk_to_netback()
     -> if (info->queues)
            xennet_destroy_queues(info);
        to free netfront_info->queues
    
                                            xennet_start_xmit()
                                            to access netfront_info->queues
    
      -> err = xennet_create_queues(info, &num_queues);
    
    The idea is borrowed from virtio-net.

    spi: altera: Change to dynamic allocation of spi id
    
    [ Upstream commit f09f6dfef8ce7b70a240cf83811e2b1909c3e47b ]
    
    The spi-altera driver has two flavors: platform and dfl. I'm seeing
    a case where I have both device types in the same machine, and they
    are conflicting on the SPI ID:
    
    ... kernel: couldn't get idr
    ... kernel: WARNING: CPU: 28 PID: 912 at drivers/spi/spi.c:2920 spi_register_controller.cold+0x84/0xc0a
    
    Both the platform and dfl drivers use the parent's driver ID as the SPI
    ID. In the error case, the parent devices are dfl_dev.4 and
    subdev_spi_altera.4.auto. When the second spi-master is created, the
    failure occurs because the SPI ID of 4 has already been allocated.
    
    Change the ID allocation to dynamic (by initializing bus_num to -1) to
    avoid duplicate SPI IDs.

    sfc: Export fibre-specific supported link modes
    
    [ Upstream commit c62041c5baa9ded3bc6fd38d3f724de70683b489 ]
    
    The 1/10GbaseT modes were set up for cards with SFP+ cages in
    3497ed8c852a5 ("sfc: report supported link speeds on SFP connections").
    10GbaseT was likely used since no 10G fibre mode existed.
    
    The missing fibre modes for 1/10G were added to ethtool.h in 5711a9822144
    ("net: ethtool: add support for 1000BaseX and missing 10G link modes")
    shortly thereafter.
    
    The user guide available at https://support-nic.xilinx.com/wp/drivers
    lists support for the following cable and transceiver types in section 2.9:
    - QSFP28 100G Direct Attach Cables
    - QSFP28 100G SR Optical Transceivers (with SR4 modules listed)
    - SFP28 25G Direct Attach Cables
    - SFP28 25G SR Optical Transceivers
    - QSFP+ 40G Direct Attach Cables
    - QSFP+ 40G Active Optical Cables
    - QSFP+ 40G SR4 Optical Transceivers
    - QSFP+ to SFP+ Breakout Direct Attach Cables
    - QSFP+ to SFP+ Breakout Active Optical Cables
    - SFP+ 10G Direct Attach Cables
    - SFP+ 10G SR Optical Transceivers
    - SFP+ 10G LR Optical Transceivers
    - SFP 1000BASE‐T Transceivers
    - 1G Optical Transceivers
    (From user guide issue 28. Issue 16 which also includes older cards like
    SFN5xxx/SFN6xxx has matching lists for 1/10/40G transceiver types.)
    
    Regarding SFP+ 10GBASE‐T transceivers the latest guide says:
    "Solarflare adapters do not support 10GBASE‐T transceiver modules."
    
    Tested using SFN5122F-R7 (with 2 SFP+ ports). Supported link modes do not change
    depending on module used (tested with 1000BASE-T, 1000BASE-BX10, 10GBASE-LR).

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix unmap of already freed sgl
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a8f71014b4d56c4fb287607e844c0a9f68f46d9 ]
    
    The sgl is freed in the target stack in target_release_cmd_kref() before
    calling qlt_free_cmd() but there is an unmap of sgl in qlt_free_cmd() that
    causes a panic if sgl is not yet DMA unmapped:
    
    NIP dma_direct_unmap_sg+0xdc/0x180
    LR  dma_direct_unmap_sg+0xc8/0x180

    The sgl may be left unmapped in error cases of response sending.  For
    instance, qlt_rdy_to_xfer() maps sgl and exits when session is being
    deleted keeping the sgl mapped.
    
    This patch removes use-after-free of the sgl and ensures that the sgl is
    unmapped for any command that was not sent to firmware.

    ptp: fix error print of ptp_kvm on X86_64 platform
    
    [ Upstream commit c2402d43d183b11445aed921e7bebcd47ef222f1 ]
    
    Commit a86ed2cfa13c5 ("ptp: Don't print an error if ptp_kvm is not supported")
    fixes the error message print on ARM platform by only concerning about
    the case that the error returned from kvm_arch_ptp_init() is not -EOPNOTSUPP.
    Although the ARM platform returns -EOPNOTSUPP if ptp_kvm is not supported
    while X86_64 platform returns -KVM_EOPNOTSUPP, both error codes share the
    same value 95.
    
    Actually kvm_arch_ptp_init() on X86_64 platform can return three kinds of
    errors (-KVM_ENOSYS, -KVM_EOPNOTSUPP and -KVM_EFAULT). The problem is that
    -KVM_EOPNOTSUPP is masked out and -KVM_EFAULT is ignored among them.
    This patch fixes this by returning them to ptp_kvm_init() respectively.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fixes HP Spectre x360 15-eb1xxx speakers
    
    [ Upstream commit d94befbb5ae379f6dfd4fa6d460eacc09fa7b9c3 ]
    
    In laptop 'HP Spectre x360 Convertible 15-eb1xxx/8811' both front and
    rear speakers are silent, this patch fixes that by overriding the pin
    layout and by initializing the amplifier which needs a GPIO pin to be
    set to 1 then 0, similar to the existing HP Spectre x360 14 model.
    
    In order to have volume control, both front and rear speakers were
    forced to use the DAC1.
    
    This patch also correctly map the mute LED but since there is no
    microphone on/off switch exposed by the alsa subsystem it never turns
    on by itself.
    
    There are still known audio issues in this laptop: headset microphone
    doesn't work, the button to mute/unmute microphone is not yet mapped,
    the LED of the mute/unmute speakers doesn't seems to be exposed via
    GPIO and never turns on.

    x86/iopl: Fake iopl(3) CLI/STI usage
    
    commit b968e84b509da593c50dc3db679e1d33de701f78 upstream.
    
    Since commit c8137ace5638 ("x86/iopl: Restrict iopl() permission
    scope") it's possible to emulate iopl(3) using ioperm(), except for
    the CLI/STI usage.
    
    Userspace CLI/STI usage is very dubious (read broken), since any
    exception taken during that window can lead to rescheduling anyway (or
    worse). The IOPL(2) manpage even states that usage of CLI/STI is highly
    discouraged and might even crash the system.
    
    Of course, that won't stop people and HP has the dubious honour of
    being the first vendor to be found using this in their hp-health
    package.
    
    In order to enable this 'software' to still 'work', have the #GP treat
    the CLI/STI instructions as NOPs when iopl(3). Warn the user that
    their program is doing dubious things.

    x86/irq: Ensure PI wakeup handler is unregistered before module unload
    
    commit 6ff53f6a438f72998f56e82e76694a1df9d1ea2c upstream.
    
    Add a synchronize_rcu() after clearing the posted interrupt wakeup handler
    to ensure all readers, i.e. in-flight IRQ handlers, see the new handler
    before returning to the caller.  If the caller is an exiting module and
    is unregistering its handler, failure to wait could result in the IRQ
    handler jumping into an unloaded module.
    
    The registration path doesn't require synchronization, as it's the
    caller's responsibility to not generate interrupts it cares about until
    after its handler is registered.

    x86/cpu: Fix migration safety with X86_BUG_NULL_SEL
    
    commit 415de44076640483648d6c0f6d645a9ee61328ad upstream.
    
    Currently, Linux probes for X86_BUG_NULL_SEL unconditionally which
    makes it unsafe to migrate in a virtualised environment as the
    properties across the migration pool might differ.
    
    To be specific, the case which goes wrong is:
    
    1. Zen1 (or earlier) and Zen2 (or later) in a migration pool
    2. Linux boots on Zen2, probes and finds the absence of X86_BUG_NULL_SEL
    3. Linux is then migrated to Zen1
    
    Linux is now running on a X86_BUG_NULL_SEL-impacted CPU while believing
    that the bug is fixed.
    
    The only way to address the problem is to fully trust the "no longer
    affected" CPUID bit when virtualised, because in the above case it would
    be clear deliberately to indicate the fact "you might migrate to
    somewhere which has this behaviour".
    
    Zen3 adds the NullSelectorClearsBase CPUID bit to indicate that loading
    a NULL segment selector zeroes the base and limit fields, as well as
    just attributes. Zen2 also has this behaviour but doesn't have the NSCB
    bit.

    x86/sme: Use #define USE_EARLY_PGTABLE_L5 in mem_encrypt_identity.c
    
    commit e7d445ab26db833d6640d4c9a08bee176777cc82 upstream.
    
    When runtime support for converting between 4-level and 5-level pagetables
    was added to the kernel, the SME code that built pagetables was updated
    to use the pagetable functions, e.g. p4d_offset(), etc., in order to
    simplify the code. However, the use of the pagetable functions in early
    boot code requires the use of the USE_EARLY_PGTABLE_L5 #define in order to
    ensure that the proper definition of pgtable_l5_enabled() is used.
    
    Without the #define, pgtable_l5_enabled() is #defined as
    cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57). In early boot, the CPU features
    have not yet been discovered and populated, so pgtable_l5_enabled() will
    return false even when 5-level paging is enabled. This causes the SME code
    to always build 4-level pagetables to perform the in-place encryption.
    If 5-level paging is enabled, switching to the SME pagetables results in
    a page-fault that kills the boot.
    
    Adding the #define results in pgtable_l5_enabled() using the
    __pgtable_l5_enabled variable set in early boot and the SME code building
    pagetables for the proper paging level.

    fuse: fix page stealing
    
    commit 712a951025c0667ff00b25afc360f74e639dfabe upstream.
    
    It is possible to trigger a crash by splicing anon pipe bufs to the fuse
    device.
    
    The reason for this is that anon_pipe_buf_release() will reuse buf->page if
    the refcount is 1, but that page might have already been stolen and its
    flags modified (e.g. PG_lru added).
    
    This happens in the unlikely case of fuse_dev_splice_write() getting around
    to calling pipe_buf_release() after a page has been stolen, added to the
    page cache and removed from the page cache.
    
    Fix by calling pipe_buf_release() right after the page was inserted into
    the page cache.  In this case the page has an elevated refcount so any
    release function will know that the page isn't reusable.

    commit 1811bc401aa58c7bdb0df3205aa6613b49d32127 upstream.
    
    After we drop i_data sem, we need to reload the ext4_ext_path
    structure since the extent tree can change once i_data_sem is
    released.

    ext4: fix lazy initialization next schedule time computation in more granular unit
    
    commit 39fec6889d15a658c3a3ebb06fd69d3584ddffd3 upstream.
    
    Ext4 file system has default lazy inode table initialization setup once
    it is mounted. However, it has issue on computing the next schedule time
    that makes the timeout same amount in jiffies but different real time in
    secs if with various HZ values. Therefore, fix by measuring the current
    time in a more granular unit nanoseconds and make the next schedule time
    independent of the HZ value.

    ALSA: timer: Unconditionally unlink slave instances, too
    
    commit ffdd98277f0a1d15a67a74ae09bee713df4c0dbc upstream.
    
    Like the previous fix (commit c0317c0e8709 "ALSA: timer: Fix
    use-after-free problem"), we have to unlink slave timer instances
    immediately at snd_timer_stop(), too.  Otherwise it may leave a stale

    ALSA: timer: Fix use-after-free problem
    
    commit c0317c0e87094f5b5782b6fdef5ae0a4b150496c upstream.
    
    When the timer instance was add into ack_list but was not currently in
    process, the user could stop it via snd_timer_stop1() without delete it
    from the ack_list. Then the user could free the timer instance and when
    it was actually processed UAF occurred.
    
    This issue could be reproduced via testcase snd_timer01 in ltp - running
    several instances of that testcase at the same time.
    
    What I actually met was that the ack_list of the timer broken and the
    kernel went into deadloop with irqoff. That could be detected by
    hardlockup detector on board or when we run it on qemu, we could use gdb
    to dump the ack_list when the console has no response.
    
    To fix this issue, we delete the timer instance from ack_list and
    active_list unconditionally in snd_timer_stop1().

    ALSA: hda: Free card instance properly at probe errors
    
    commit 39173303c83859723dab32c2abfb97296d6af3bf upstream.
    
    The recent change in hda-intel driver to allow repeated probes
    surfaced a problem that has been hidden until; the probe process in
    the work calls azx_free() at the error path, and this skips the card
    free process that eventually releases codec instances.  As a result,
    we get a kernel WARNING like:
    
      snd_hda_intel 0000:00:1f.3: Cannot probe codecs, giving up
      ------------[ cut here ]------------
      WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 186 at sound/hda/hdac_bus.c:73
      ....
    
    For fixing this, we need to call snd_card_free() instead of
    azx_free().  Additionally, the device drvdata has to be cleared, as
    the driver binding itself is still active.  Then the PM and other
    driver callbacks will ignore the procedure.

    The OSS mixer can reassign the mapping slots dynamically via proc

    commit c058493df7edcef8f48c1494d9a84218519f966b upstream.
    
    The mute and micmute LEDs don't work on HP EliteBook 840 G7. The same
    quirk for other HP laptops can let LEDs work, so apply it.

    commit 1278cc5ac2f96bab50dd55c8c05e0a6a77ce323e upstream.
    
    On Clevo NH77HJ, NH77HP, and their 15" variants, there is a headset
    microphone input attached to 0x19 that does not have a jack detect. In
    order to get it working, the pin configuration needs to be set
    correctly, and a new ALC256_FIXUP_SYSTEM76_MIC_NO_PRESENCE fixup is
    applied. This is similar to the existing System76 quirk for ALC293, but
    for ALC256.

    media: v4l2-ioctl: Fix check_ext_ctrls
    
    commit 861f92cb9160b14beef0ada047384c2340701ee2 upstream.
    
    Drivers that do not use the ctrl-framework use this function instead.
    
    Fix the following issues:
    
    - Do not check for multiple classes when getting the DEF_VAL.
    - Return -EINVAL for request_api calls
    - Default value cannot be changed, return EINVAL as soon as possible.
    - Return the right error_idx
    [If an error is found when validating the list of controls passed with
    VIDIOC_G_EXT_CTRLS, then error_idx shall be set to ctrls->count to
    indicate to userspace that no actual hardware was touched.
    It would have been much nicer of course if error_idx could point to the
    control index that failed the validation, but sadly that's not how the
    API was designed.]
    
    Fixes v4l2-compliance:
    Control ioctls (Input 0):
            warn: v4l2-test-controls.cpp(834): error_idx should be equal to count
            warn: v4l2-test-controls.cpp(855): error_idx should be equal to count

    media: rkvdec: Support dynamic resolution changes
    
    commit 0887e9e152efbd3601d6c907e90033d25067277d upstream.
    
    The mem-to-mem stateless decoder API specifies support for dynamic
    resolution changes. In particular, the decoder should accept format
    changes on the OUTPUT queue even when buffers have been allocated,
    as long as it is not streaming.
    
    Relax restrictions for S_FMT as described in the previous paragraph,
    and as long as the codec format remains the same. This aligns it with
    the Hantro and Cedrus decoders. This change was mostly based on commit
    ae02d49493b5 ("media: hantro: Fix s_fmt for dynamic resolution changes").
    
    Since rkvdec_s_fmt() is now just a wrapper around the output/capture
    variants without any additional shared functionality, drop the wrapper
    and call the respective functions directly.

    media: rkvdec: Do not override sizeimage for output format
    
    commit 298d8e8f7bcf023aceb60232d59b983255fec0df upstream.
    
    The rkvdec H.264 decoder currently overrides sizeimage for the output
    format. This causes issues when userspace requires and requests a larger
    buffer, but ends up with one of insufficient size.
    
    Instead, only provide a default size if none was requested. This fixes
    the video_decode_accelerator_tests from Chromium failing on the first
    frame due to insufficient buffer space. It also aligns the behavior
    of the rkvdec driver with the Hantro and Cedrus drivers.

    mmc: dw_mmc: Dont wait for DRTO on Write RSP error
    
    commit 43592c8736e84025d7a45e61a46c3fa40536a364 upstream.
    
    Only wait for DRTO on reads, otherwise the driver hangs.
    
    The driver prevents sending CMD12 on response errors like CRCs. According
    to the comment this is because some cards have problems with this during
    the UHS tuning sequence. Unfortunately this workaround currently also
    applies for any command with data. On reads this will set the drto timer,
    which then triggers after a while. On writes this will not set any timer
    and the tasklet will not be scheduled again.
    
    I cannot test for the UHS workarounds need, but even if so, it should at
    most apply to reads. I have observed many hangs when CMD25 response
    contained a CRC error. This patch fixes this without touching the actual
    UHS tuning workaround.

    mmc: mtk-sd: Add wait dma stop done flow
    
    commit 43e5fee317f4b0a48992b8b07935b1a3ac20ce84 upstream.
    
    We found this issue on a 5G platform, during CMDQ error handling, if DMA
    status is active when it call msdc_reset_hw(), it means mmc host hw reset
    and DMA transfer will be parallel, mmc host may access sram region
    unexpectedly. According to the programming guide of mtk-sd host, it needs
    to wait for dma stop done after set dma stop.
    
    This change should be applied to all SoCs.

    char: xillybus: fix msg_ep UAF in xillyusb_probe()
    
    commit 15c9a359094ec6251578b02387436bc64f11a477 upstream.
    
    When endpoint_alloc() return failed in xillyusb_setup_base_eps(),
    'xdev->msg_ep' will be freed but not set to NULL. That lets program
    enter fail handling to cleanup_dev() in xillyusb_probe(). Check for
    'xdev->msg_ep' is invalid in cleanup_dev() because 'xdev->msg_ep' did
    not set to NULL when was freed. So the UAF problem for 'xdev->msg_ep'
    is triggered.

    ce/gf100: fix incorrect CE0 address calculation on some GPUs
    
    commit 93f43ed81abec8c805e1b77eb1d20dbc51a24dc4 upstream.
    
    The code which constructs the modules for each engine present on the GPU
    passes -1 for 'instance' on non-instanced engines, which affects how the
    name for a sub-device is generated.  This is then stored as 'instance 0'
    in nvkm_subdev.inst, so code can potentially be shared with earlier GPUs
    that only had a single instance of an engine.
    
    However, GF100's CE constructor uses this value to calculate the address
    of its falcon before it's translated, resulting in CE0 getting the wrong
    address.
    
    This slightly modifies the approach, always passing a valid instance for
    engines that *can* have multiple copies, and having the code for earlier
    GPUs explicitly ask for non-instanced name generation.

    commit cd8a36a90babf958082b87bc6b4df5dd70901eba upstream.

    lpfc_reset_flush_io_context() called from any TMF routine does not properly

    an invalid scsi_cmnd->request pointer.

    scsi: lpfc: Don't release final kref on Fport node while ABTS outstanding
    
    commit 982fc3965d1350d3332e04046b0e101006184ba9 upstream.
    
    In a rarely executed path, FLOGI failure, there is a refcounting error.  If
    FLOGI completed with an error, typically a timeout, the initial completion
    handler would remove the job reference. However, the job completion isn't
    the actual end of the job/exchange as the timeout usually initiates an
    ABTS, and upon that ABTS completion, a final completion is sent. The driver
    removes the reference again in the final completion. Thus the imbalance.
    
    In the buggy cases, if there was a link bounce while the delayed response
    is outstanding, the fport node may be referenced again but there was no
    additional reference as it is already present. The delayed completion then
    occurs and removes the last reference freeing the node and causing issues
    in the link up processed that is using the node.
    
    Fix this scenario by removing the snippet that removed the reference in the
    initial FLOGI completion. The bad snippet was poorly trying to identify the
    FLOGI as OK to do so by realizing the node was not registered with either
    SCSI or NVMe transport.

    scsi: core: Remove command size deduction from scsi_setup_scsi_cmnd()
    
    commit 703535e6ae1e94c89a9c1396b4c7b6b41160ef0c upstream.
    
    No need to deduce command size in scsi_setup_scsi_cmnd() anymore as
    appropriate checks have been added to scsi_fill_sghdr_rq() function and the
    cmd_len should never be zero here.  The code to do that wasn't correct
    anyway, as it used uninitialized cmd->cmnd, which caused a null-ptr-deref
    if the command size was zero as in the trace below. Fix this by removing
    the unneeded code.

    scsi: core: Avoid leaving shost->last_reset with stale value if EH does not run
    
    commit 5ae17501bc62a49b0b193dcce003f16375f16654 upstream.
    
    The changes to issue the abort from the scmd->abort_work instead of the EH
    thread introduced a problem if eh_deadline is used.  If aborting the
    command(s) is successful, and there are never any scmds added to the
    shost->eh_cmd_q, there is no code path which will reset the ->last_reset
    value back to zero.
    
    The effect of this is that after a successful abort with no EH thread
    activity, a subsequent timeout, perhaps a long time later, might
    immediately be considered past a user-set eh_deadline time, and the host
    will be reset with no attempt at recovery.
    
    Fix this by resetting ->last_reset back to zero in scmd_eh_abort_handler()
    if it is determined that the EH thread will not run to do this.
    
    Thanks to Gopinath Marappan for investigating this problem.

    ocfs2: fix data corruption on truncate
    
    commit 839b63860eb3835da165642923120d305925561d upstream.
    
    Patch series "ocfs2: Truncate data corruption fix".
    
    As further testing has shown, commit 5314454ea3f ("ocfs2: fix data
    corruption after conversion from inline format") didn't fix all the data
    corruption issues the customer started observing after 6dbf7bb55598
    ("fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in block_write_full_page()") This
    time I have tracked them down to two bugs in ocfs2 truncation code.
    
    One bug (truncating page cache before clearing tail cluster and setting
    i_size) could cause data corruption even before 6dbf7bb55598, but before
    that commit it needed a race with page fault, after 6dbf7bb55598 it
    started to be pretty deterministic.
    
    Another bug (zeroing pages beyond old i_size) used to be harmless
    inefficiency before commit 6dbf7bb55598.  But after commit 6dbf7bb55598
    in combination with the first bug it resulted in deterministic data
    corruption.
    
    Although fixing only the first problem is needed to stop data
    corruption, I've fixed both issues to make the code more robust.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    ocfs2_truncate_file() did unmap invalidate page cache pages before
    zeroing partial tail cluster and setting i_size.  Thus some pages could
    be left (and likely have left if the cluster zeroing happened) in the
    page cache beyond i_size after truncate finished letting user possibly
    see stale data once the file was extended again.  Also the tail cluster
    zeroing was not guaranteed to finish before truncate finished causing
    possible stale data exposure.  The problem started to be particularly
    easy to hit after commit 6dbf7bb55598 "fs: Don't invalidate page buffers
    in block_write_full_page()" stopped invalidation of pages beyond i_size
    from page writeback path.
    
    Fix these problems by unmapping and invalidating pages in the page cache
    after the i_size is reduced and tail cluster is zeroed out.

    libata: fix read log timeout value
    
    commit 68dbbe7d5b4fde736d104cbbc9a2fce875562012 upstream.
    
    Some ATA drives are very slow to respond to READ_LOG_EXT and
    READ_LOG_DMA_EXT commands issued from ata_dev_configure() when the
    device is revalidated right after resuming a system or inserting the
    ATA adapter driver (e.g. ahci). The default 5s timeout
    (ATA_EH_CMD_DFL_TIMEOUT) used for these commands is too short, causing
    errors during the device configuration. Ex:
    
    ...
    ata9: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m524288@0x9d200000 port 0x9d200400 irq 209
    ata9: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
    ata9.00: ATA-9: XXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX, max UDMA/133
    ata9.00: qc timeout (cmd 0x2f)
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x00 failed, Emask 0x4
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x00 failed, Emask 0x40
    ata9.00: NCQ Send/Recv Log not supported
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x08 failed, Emask 0x40
    ata9.00: 27344764928 sectors, multi 16: LBA48 NCQ (depth 32), AA
    ata9.00: Read log page 0x00 failed, Emask 0x40
    ata9.00: ATA Identify Device Log not supported
    ata9.00: failed to set xfermode (err_mask=0x40)
    ata9: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
    ata9.00: configured for UDMA/133
    ...
    
    The timeout error causes a soft reset of the drive link, followed in
    most cases by a successful revalidation as that give enough time to the
    drive to become fully ready to quickly process the read log commands.
    However, in some cases, this also fails resulting in the device being
    dropped.
    
    Fix this by using adding the ata_eh_revalidate_timeouts entries for the
    READ_LOG_EXT and READ_LOG_DMA_EXT commands. This defines a timeout
    increased to 15s, retriable one time.

    xhci: Fix USB 3.1 enumeration issues by increasing roothub power-on-good delay
    
    commit e1959faf085b004e6c3afaaaa743381f00e7c015 upstream.
    
    Some USB 3.1 enumeration issues were reported after the hub driver removed
    the minimum 100ms limit for the power-on-good delay.
    
    Since commit 90d28fb53d4a ("usb: core: reduce power-on-good delay time of
    root hub") the hub driver sets the power-on-delay based on the
    bPwrOn2PwrGood value in the hub descriptor.
    
    xhci driver has a 20ms bPwrOn2PwrGood value for both roothubs based
    on xhci spec section 5.4.8, but it's clearly not enough for the
    USB 3.1 devices, causing enumeration issues.
    
    Tests indicate full 100ms delay is needed.
