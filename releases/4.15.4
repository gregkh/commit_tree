    rcu: Export init_rcu_head() and destroy_rcu_head() to GPL modules
    
    commit 156baec39732f025dc778e00da95fc10d6e45885 upstream.
    
    Use of init_rcu_head() and destroy_rcu_head() from modules results in
    the following build-time error with CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_RCU_HEAD=y:
    
            ERROR: "init_rcu_head" [drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko] undefined!
            ERROR: "destroy_rcu_head" [drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko] undefined!
    
    This commit therefore adds EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() for each to allow them to
    be used by GPL-licensed kernel modules.

    scsi: cxlflash: Reset command ioasc
    
    commit 96cf727fe8f102bf92150b741db71ee39fb8c521 upstream.
    
    In the event of a command failure, cxlflash returns the failure to the upper
    layers to process. After processing the error, when the command is queued
    again, the private command structure will not be zeroed and the ioasc could be
    stale. Per the SISLite specification, the AFU only sets the ioasc in the
    presence of a failure. Thus, even though the original command succeeds the
    second time, the command is considered a failure due to stale ioasc. This
    cycle repeats indefinitely and can cause a hang or IO failure.
    
    To fix the issue, clear the ioasc before queuing any command.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix crash after bad bar setup on driver attachment
    
    commit e4b9794efdce13242f4af6682f3ed48ce3864a87 upstream.
    
    In test cases where an instance of the driver is detached and
    reattached, the driver will crash on reattachment. There is a compound
    if statement that will skip over the bar setup if the pci_resource_start
    call is not successful. The driver erroneously returns success to its
    bar setup in this scenario even though the bars aren't properly
    configured.
    
    Rework the offending code segment for proper initialization steps.  If
    the pci_resource_start call fails, -ENOMEM is now returned.

    scsi: core: Ensure that the SCSI error handler gets woken up
    
    commit 3bd6f43f5cb3714f70c591514f344389df593501 upstream.
    
    If scsi_eh_scmd_add() is called concurrently with
    scsi_host_queue_ready() while shost->host_blocked > 0 then it can
    happen that neither function wakes up the SCSI error handler. Fix
    this by making every function that decreases the host_busy counter
    wake up the error handler if necessary and by protecting the
    host_failed checks with the SCSI host lock.

    ftrace: Remove incorrect setting of glob search field
    
    commit 7b6586562708d2b3a04fe49f217ddbadbbbb0546 upstream.
    
    __unregister_ftrace_function_probe() will incorrectly parse the glob filter
    because it resets the search variable that was setup by filter_parse_regex().
    
    Al Viro reported this:
    
        After that call of filter_parse_regex() we could have func_g.search not
        equal to glob only if glob started with '!' or '*'.  In the former case
        we would've buggered off with -EINVAL (not = 1).  In the latter we
        would've set func_g.search equal to glob + 1, calculated the length of
        that thing in func_g.len and proceeded to reset func_g.search back to
        glob.
    
        Suppose the glob is e.g. *foo*.  We end up with
                func_g.type = MATCH_MIDDLE_ONLY;
                func_g.len = 3;
                func_g.search = "*foo";
        Feeding that to ftrace_match_record() will not do anything sane - we
        will be looking for names containing "*foo" (->len is ignored for that
        one).

    commit 6ac1dc736b323011a55ecd1fc5897c24c4f77cbd upstream.
    
    Setting si_code to 0 is the same a setting si_code to SI_USER which is definitely
    not correct.  With si_code set to SI_USER si_pid and si_uid will be copied to
    userspace instead of si_addr.  Which is very wrong.
    
    So fix this by using a sensible si_code (SEGV_MAPERR) for this failure.

    ovl: hash directory inodes for fsnotify
    
    commit 31747eda41ef3c30c09c5c096b380bf54013746a upstream.
    
    fsnotify pins a watched directory inode in cache, but if directory dentry
    is released, new lookup will allocate a new dentry and a new inode.
    Directory events will be notified on the new inode, while fsnotify listener
    is watching the old pinned inode.
    
    Hash all directory inodes to reuse the pinned inode on lookup. Pure upper
    dirs are hashes by real upper inode, merge and lower dirs are hashed by
    real lower inode.
    
    The reference to lower inode was being held by the lower dentry object
    in the overlay dentry (oe->lowerstack[0]). Releasing the overlay dentry
    may drop lower inode refcount to zero. Add a refcount on behalf of the
    overlay inode to prevent that.
    
    As a by-product, hashing directory inodes also detects multiple
    redirected dirs to the same lower dir and uncovered redirected dir
    target on and returns -ESTALE on lookup.
    
    The reported issue dates back to initial version of overlayfs, but this
    patch depends on ovl_inode code that was introduced in kernel v4.13.

    ovl: fix failure to fsync lower dir
    
    commit d796e77f1dd541fe34481af2eee6454688d13982 upstream.
    
    As a writable mount, it is not expected for overlayfs to return
    EINVAL/EROFS for fsync, even if dir/file is not changed.
    
    This commit fixes the case of fsync of directory, which is easier to
    address, because overlayfs already implements fsync file operation for
    directories.
    
    The problem reported by Raphael is that new PostgreSQL 10.0 with a
    database in overlayfs where lower layer in squashfs fails to start.
    The failure is due to fsync error, when PostgreSQL does fsync on all
    existing db directories on startup and a specific directory exists
    lower layer with no changes.

    ovl: force r/o mount when index dir creation fails
    
    commit 972d0093c2f7b1bd57e47a1780a552dde528fd16 upstream.
    
    When work dir creation fails, a warning is emitted and overlay is
    mounted r/o. Trying to remount r/w will fail with no work dir.
    
    When index dir creation fails, the same warning is emitted and overlay
    is mounted r/o, but trying to remount r/w will succeed. This may cause
    unintentional corruption of filesystem consistency.
    
    Adjust the behavior of index dir creation failure to that of work dir
    creation failure and do not allow to remount r/w. User needs to state
    an explicitly intention to work without an index by mounting with
    option 'index=off' to allow r/w mount with no index dir.
    
    When mounting with option 'index=on' and no 'upperdir', index is
    implicitly disabled, so do not warn about no file handle support.
    
    The issue was introduced with inodes index feature in v4.13, but this
    patch will not apply cleanly before ovl_fill_super() re-factoring in
    v4.15.

    drm/i915: Avoid PPS HW/SW state mismatch due to rounding
    
    commit 5643205c6340b565a3be0fe0e7305dc4aa551c74 upstream.
    
    We store a SW state of the t11_t12 timing in 100usec units but have to
    program it in 100msec as required by HW. The rounding used during
    programming means there will be a mismatch between the SW and HW states
    of this value triggering a "PPS state mismatch" error. Avoid this by
    storing the already rounded-up value in the SW state.
    
    Note that we still calculate panel_power_cycle_delay with the finer
    100usec granularity to avoid any needless waits using that version of
    the delay.

    arm64: dts: marvell: add Ethernet aliases
    
    commit 474c5885582c4a79c21bcf01ed98f98c935f1f4a upstream.
    
    This patch adds Ethernet aliases in the Marvell Armada 7040 DB, 8040 DB
    and 8040 mcbin device trees so that the bootloader setup the MAC
    addresses correctly.

    objtool: Fix switch-table detection
    
    commit 99ce7962d52d1948ad6f2785e308d48e76e0a6ef upstream.
    
    Linus reported that GCC-7.3 generated a switch-table construct that
    confused objtool. It turns out that, in particular due to KASAN, it is
    possible to have unrelated .rodata usage in between the .rodata setup
    for the switch-table and the following indirect jump.
    
    The simple linear reverse search from the indirect jump would hit upon
    the KASAN .rodata usage first and fail to find a switch_table,
    resulting in a spurious 'sibling call with modified stack frame'
    warning.
    
    Fix this by creating a 'jump-stack' which we can 'unwind' during
    reversal, thereby skipping over much of the in-between code.
    
    This is not fool proof by any means, but is sufficient to make the
    known cases work. Future work would be to construct more comprehensive
    flow analysis code.

    lib/ubsan: add type mismatch handler for new GCC/Clang
    
    commit 42440c1f9911b4b7b8ba3dc4e90c1197bc561211 upstream.
    
    UBSAN=y fails to build with new GCC/clang:
    
        arch/x86/kernel/head64.o: In function `sanitize_boot_params':
        arch/x86/include/asm/bootparam_utils.h:37: undefined reference to `__ubsan_handle_type_mismatch_v1'
    
    because Clang and GCC 8 slightly changed ABI for 'type mismatch' errors.
    Compiler now uses new __ubsan_handle_type_mismatch_v1() function with
    slightly modified 'struct type_mismatch_data'.
    
    Let's add new 'struct type_mismatch_data_common' which is independent from
    compiler's layout of 'struct type_mismatch_data'.  And make
    __ubsan_handle_type_mismatch[_v1]() functions transform compiler-dependent
    type mismatch data to our internal representation.  This way, we can
    support both old and new compilers with minimal amount of change.

    clocksource/drivers/stm32: Fix kernel panic with multiple timers
    
    commit e0aeca3d8cbaea514eb98df1149faa918f9ec42d upstream.
    
    The current code hides a couple of bugs:
    
     - The global variable 'clock_event_ddata' is overwritten each time the
       init function is invoked.
    
    This is fixed with a kmemdup() instead of assigning the global variable. That
    prevents a memory corruption when several timers are defined in the DT.
    
     - The clockevent's event_handler is NULL if the time framework does
       not select the clockevent when registering it, this is fine but the init
       code generates in any case an interrupt leading to dereference this
       NULL pointer.
    
    The stm32 timer works with shadow registers, a mechanism to cache the
    registers. When a change is done in one buffered register, we need to
    artificially generate an event to force the timer to copy the content
    of the register to the shadowed register.
    
    The auto-reload register (ARR) is one of the shadowed register as well as
    the prescaler register (PSC), so in order to force the copy, we issue an
    event which in turn leads to an interrupt and the NULL dereference.
    
    This is fixed by inverting two lines where we clear the status register
    before enabling the update event interrupt.
    
    As this kernel crash is resulting from the combination of these two bugs,
    the fixes are grouped into a single patch.

    blk-mq: quiesce queue before freeing queue
    
    commit c2856ae2f315d754a0b6a268e4c6745b332b42e7 upstream.
    
    After queue is frozen, dispatch still may happen, for example:
    
    1) requests are submitted from several contexts
    2) requests from all these contexts are inserted to queue, but may dispatch
    to LLD in one of these paths, but other paths sill need to move on even all
    these requests are completed(that means blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait() returns
    at that time)
    3) dispatch after queue freezing still moves on and causes use-after-free,
    because request queue is freed
    
    This patch quiesces queue after it is frozen, and makes sure all
    in-progress dispatch are completed.
    
    This patch fixes the following kernel crash when running heavy IOs vs.
    deleting device:

    pktcdvd: Fix pkt_setup_dev() error path
    
    commit 5a0ec388ef0f6e33841aeb810d7fa23f049ec4cd upstream.
    
    Commit 523e1d399ce0 ("block: make gendisk hold a reference to its queue")
    modified add_disk() and disk_release() but did not update any of the
    error paths that trigger a put_disk() call after disk->queue has been
    assigned. That introduced the following behavior in the pktcdvd driver
    if pkt_new_dev() fails:
    
    Kernel BUG at 00000000e98fd882 [verbose debug info unavailable]
    
    Since disk_release() calls blk_put_queue() anyway if disk->queue != NULL,
    fix this by removing the blk_cleanup_queue() call from the pkt_setup_dev()
    error path.

    pinctrl: mcp23s08: fix irq setup order
    
    commit 02e389e63e3523828fc3832f27e0341885f60f6f upstream.
    
    When using mcp23s08 module with gpio-keys, often (50% of boots)
    it fails to get irq numbers with message:
    "gpio-keys keys: Unable to get irq number for GPIO 0, error -6".
    Seems that irqs must be setup before devm_gpiochip_add_data().

    pinctrl: intel: Initialize GPIO properly when used through irqchip
    
    commit f5a26acf0162477af6ee4c11b4fb9cffe5d3e257 upstream.
    
    When a GPIO is requested using gpiod_get_* APIs the intel pinctrl driver
    switches the pin to GPIO mode and makes sure interrupts are routed to
    the GPIO hardware instead of IOAPIC. However, if the GPIO is used
    directly through irqchip, as is the case with many I2C-HID devices where
    I2C core automatically configures interrupt for the device, the pin is
    not initialized as GPIO. Instead we rely that the BIOS configures the
    pin accordingly which seems not to be the case at least in Asus X540NA
    SKU3 with Focaltech touchpad.
    
    When the pin is not properly configured it might result weird behaviour
    like interrupts suddenly stop firing completely and the touchpad stops
    responding to user input.
    
    Fix this by properly initializing the pin to GPIO mode also when it is
    used directly through irqchip.

    genirq: Make legacy autoprobing work again
    
    commit 1beaeacdc88b537703d04d5536235d0bbb36db93 upstream.
    
    Meelis reported the following warning on a quad P3 HP NetServer museum piece:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 258 at kernel/irq/chip.c:244 __irq_startup+0x80/0x100

    This is caused by the rewrite of the irq activation/startup sequence which
    missed to convert a callsite in the irq legacy auto probing code.
    
    To fix this irq_activate_and_startup() needs to gain a return value so the
    pending logic can work proper.

    alpha: fix crash if pthread_create races with signal delivery
    
    commit 21ffceda1c8b3807615c40d440d7815e0c85d366 upstream.
    
    On alpha, a process will crash if it attempts to start a thread and a
    signal is delivered at the same time. The crash can be reproduced with
    this program: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-11/msg00473.html
    
    The reason for the crash is this:
    * we call the clone syscall
    * we go to the function copy_process
    * copy process calls copy_thread_tls, it is a wrapper around copy_thread
    * copy_thread sets the tls pointer: childti->pcb.unique = regs->r20
    * copy_thread sets regs->r20 to zero
    * we go back to copy_process
    * copy process checks "if (signal_pending(current))" and returns
      -ERESTARTNOINTR
    * the clone syscall is restarted, but this time, regs->r20 is zero, so
      the new thread is created with zero tls pointer
    * the new thread crashes in start_thread when attempting to access tls
    
    The comment in the code says that setting the register r20 is some
    compatibility with OSF/1. But OSF/1 doesn't use the CLONE_SETTLS flag, so
    we don't have to zero r20 if CLONE_SETTLS is set. This patch fixes the bug
    by zeroing regs->r20 only if CLONE_SETTLS is not set.

    signal/openrisc: Fix do_unaligned_access to send the proper signal
    
    commit 500d58300571b6602341b041f97c082a461ef994 upstream.
    
    While reviewing the signal sending on openrisc the do_unaligned_access
    function stood out because it is obviously wrong.  A comment about an
    si_code set above when actually si_code is never set.  Leading to a
    random si_code being sent to userspace in the event of an unaligned
    access.
    
    Looking further SIGBUS BUS_ADRALN is the proper pair of signal and
    si_code to send for an unaligned access. That is what other
    architectures do and what is required by posix.
    
    Given that do_unaligned_access is broken in a way that no one can be
    relying on it on openrisc fix the code to just do the right thing.

    Bluetooth: btusb: Restore QCA Rome suspend/resume fix with a "rewritten" version
    
    commit 61f5acea8737d9b717fcc22bb6679924f3c82b98 upstream.
    
    Commit 7d06d5895c15 ("Revert "Bluetooth: btusb: fix QCA...suspend/resume"")
    removed the setting of the BTUSB_RESET_RESUME quirk for QCA Rome devices,
    instead favoring adding USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME quirks in usb/core/quirks.c.
    
    This was done because the DIY BTUSB_RESET_RESUME reset-resume handling
    has several issues (see the original commit message). An added advantage
    of moving over to the USB-core reset-resume handling is that it also
    disables autosuspend for these devices, which is similarly broken on these.
    
    But there are 2 issues with this approach:
    1) It leaves the broken DIY BTUSB_RESET_RESUME code in place for Realtek
       devices.
    2) Sofar only 2 of the 10 QCA devices known to the btusb code have been
       added to usb/core/quirks.c and if we fix the Realtek case the same way
       we need to add an additional 14 entries. So in essence we need to
       duplicate a large part of the usb_device_id table in btusb.c in
       usb/core/quirks.c and manually keep them in sync.
    
    This commit instead restores setting a reset-resume quirk for QCA devices
    in the btusb.c code, avoiding the duplicate usb_device_id table problem.
    
    This commit avoids the problems with the original DIY BTUSB_RESET_RESUME
    code by simply setting the USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME quirk directly on the
    usb_device.
    
    This commit also moves the BTUSB_REALTEK case over to directly setting the
    USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME on the usb_device and removes the now unused
    BTUSB_RESET_RESUME code.

    Revert "Bluetooth: btusb: fix QCA Rome suspend/resume"
    
    commit 7d06d5895c159f64c46560dc258e553ad8670fe0 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit fd865802c66bc451dc515ed89360f84376ce1a56.
    
    This commit causes a regression on some QCA ROME chips. The USB device
    reset happens in btusb_open(), hence firmware loading gets interrupted.
    
    Furthermore, this commit stops working after commit
    ("a0085f2510e8976614ad8f766b209448b385492f Bluetooth: btusb: driver to
    enable the usb-wakeup feature"). Reset-resume quirk only gets enabled in
    btusb_suspend() when it's not a wakeup source.
    
    If we really want to reset the USB device, we need to do it before
    btusb_open(). Let's handle it in drivers/usb/core/quirks.c.

    Bluetooth: btsdio: Do not bind to non-removable BCM43341
    
    commit b4cdaba274247c9c841c6a682c08fa91fb3aa549 upstream.
    
    BCM43341 devices soldered onto the PCB (non-removable) always (AFAICT)
    use an UART connection for bluetooth. But they also advertise btsdio
    support on their 3th sdio function, this causes 2 problems:
    
    1) A non functioning BT HCI getting registered
    
    2) Since the btsdio driver does not have suspend/resume callbacks,
    mmc_sdio_pre_suspend will return -ENOSYS, causing mmc_pm_notify()
    to react as if the SDIO-card is removed and since the slot is
    marked as non-removable it will never get detected as inserted again.
    Which results in wifi no longer working after a suspend/resume.
    
    This commit fixes both by making btsdio ignore BCM43341 devices
    when connected to a slot which is marked non-removable.

    HID: quirks: Fix keyboard + touchpad on Toshiba Click Mini not working
    
    commit edfc3722cfef4217c7fe92b272cbe0288ba1ff57 upstream.
    
    The Toshiba Click Mini uses an i2c attached keyboard/touchpad combo
    (single i2c_hid device for both) which has a vid:pid of 04F3:0401,
    which is also used by a bunch of Elan touchpads which are handled by the
    drivers/input/mouse/elan_i2c driver, but that driver deals with pure
    touchpads and does not work for a combo device such as the one on the
    Toshiba Click Mini.
    
    The combo on the Mini has an ACPI id of ELAN0800, which is not claimed
    by the elan_i2c driver, so check for that and if it is found do not ignore
    the device. This fixes the keyboard/touchpad combo on the Mini not working
    (although with the touchpad in mouse emulation mode).

    pipe: actually allow root to exceed the pipe buffer limits
    
    commit 85c2dd5473b2718b4b63e74bfeb1ca876868e11f upstream.
    
    pipe-user-pages-hard and pipe-user-pages-soft are only supposed to apply
    to unprivileged users, as documented in both Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt
    and the pipe(7) man page.
    
    However, the capabilities are actually only checked when increasing a
    pipe's size using F_SETPIPE_SZ, not when creating a new pipe.  Therefore,
    if pipe-user-pages-hard has been set, the root user can run into it and be
    unable to create pipes.  Similarly, if pipe-user-pages-soft has been set,
    the root user can run into it and have their pipes limited to 1 page each.
    
    Fix this by allowing the privileged override in both cases.

    kernel/async.c: revert "async: simplify lowest_in_progress()"
    
    commit 4f7e988e63e336827f4150de48163bed05d653bd upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 92266d6ef60c ("async: simplify lowest_in_progress()")
    which was simply wrong: In the case where domain is NULL, we now use the
    wrong offsetof() in the list_first_entry macro, so we don't actually
    fetch the ->cookie value, but rather the eight bytes located
    sizeof(struct list_head) further into the struct async_entry.
    
    On 64 bit, that's the data member, while on 32 bit, that's a u64 built
    from func and data in some order.
    
    I think the bug happens to be harmless in practice: It obviously only
    affects callers which pass a NULL domain, and AFAICT the only such
    caller is
    
      async_synchronize_full() ->
      async_synchronize_full_domain(NULL) ->
      async_synchronize_cookie_domain(ASYNC_COOKIE_MAX, NULL)
    
    and the ASYNC_COOKIE_MAX means that in practice we end up waiting for
    the async_global_pending list to be empty - but it would break if
    somebody happened to pass (void*)-1 as the data element to
    async_schedule, and of course also if somebody ever does a
    async_synchronize_cookie_domain(, NULL) with a "finite" cookie value.
    
    Maybe the "harmless in practice" means this isn't -stable material.  But
    I'm not completely confident my quick git grep'ing is enough, and there
    might be affected code in one of the earlier kernels that has since been
    removed, so I'll leave the decision to the stable guys.

    fs/proc/kcore.c: use probe_kernel_read() instead of memcpy()
    
    commit d0290bc20d4739b7a900ae37eb5d4cc3be2b393f upstream.
    
    Commit df04abfd181a ("fs/proc/kcore.c: Add bounce buffer for ktext
    data") added a bounce buffer to avoid hardened usercopy checks.  Copying
    to the bounce buffer was implemented with a simple memcpy() assuming
    that it is always valid to read from kernel memory iff the
    kern_addr_valid() check passed.
    
    A simple, but pointless, test case like "dd if=/proc/kcore of=/dev/null"
    now can easily crash the kernel, since the former execption handling on
    invalid kernel addresses now doesn't work anymore.
    
    Also adding a kern_addr_valid() implementation wouldn't help here.  Most
    architectures simply return 1 here, while a couple implemented a page
    table walk to figure out if something is mapped at the address in
    question.
    
    With DEBUG_PAGEALLOC active mappings are established and removed all the
    time, so that relying on the result of kern_addr_valid() before
    executing the memcpy() also doesn't work.
    
    Therefore simply use probe_kernel_read() to copy to the bounce buffer.
    This also allows to simplify read_kcore().
    
    At least on s390 this fixes the observed crashes and doesn't introduce
    warnings that were removed with df04abfd181a ("fs/proc/kcore.c: Add
    bounce buffer for ktext data"), even though the generic
    probe_kernel_read() implementation uses uaccess functions.
    
    While looking into this I'm also wondering if kern_addr_valid() could be
    completely removed...(?)

    commit 0fa2c5f954c41e870fe327907c01cb8f7ea8d5a2 upstream.
    
    If the framebuffer is enabled and error injection is disabled, then
    creating the controls for the video output device would fail with an
    error.
    
    This is because the Clear Framebuffer control uses the 'vivid control
    class' and that control class isn't added if error injection is disabled.
    
    In addition, this control was added to e.g. vbi devices as well, which
    makes no sense.
    
    Move this control to its own control handler and handle it correctly.

    commit 3cd890dbe2a4f14cc44c85bb6cf37e5e22d4dd0e upstream.
    
    A typical code fragment was copied across many dvb-frontend drivers and
    causes large stack frames when built with with CONFIG_KASAN on gcc-5/6/7:
    
    drivers/media/dvb-frontends/cxd2841er.c:3225:1: error: the frame size of 3992 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

    gcc-8 now solves this by consolidating the stack slots for the argument
    variables, but on older compilers we can get the same behavior by taking
    the pointer of a local variable rather than the inline function argument.

    media: dvb_frontend: be sure to init dvb_frontend_handle_ioctl() return code
    
    commit a9cb97c3e628902e37583d8a40bb28cf76522cf1 upstream.
    
    As smatch warned:
            drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c:2468 dvb_frontend_handle_ioctl() error: uninitialized symbol 'err'.
    
    The ioctl handler actually got a regression here: before changeset
    d73dcf0cdb95 ("media: dvb_frontend: cleanup ioctl handling logic"),
    the code used to return -EOPNOTSUPP if an ioctl handler was not
    implemented on a driver. After the change, it may return a random
    value.

    kasan: rework Kconfig settings
    
    commit e7c52b84fb18f08ce49b6067ae6285aca79084a8 upstream.
    
    We get a lot of very large stack frames using gcc-7.0.1 with the default
    -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope --param asan-stack=1 options, which can
    easily cause an overflow of the kernel stack, e.g.
    
      drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/handlers.c:2434:1: warning: the frame size of 46176 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes
      drivers/net/wireless/ralink/rt2x00/rt2800lib.c:5650:1: warning: the frame size of 23632 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes
      lib/atomic64_test.c:250:1: warning: the frame size of 11200 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes
      drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/handlers.c:2621:1: warning: the frame size of 9208 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes
      drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv090x.c:3431:1: warning: the frame size of 6816 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes
      fs/fscache/stats.c:287:1: warning: the frame size of 6536 bytes is larger than 3072 bytes
    
    To reduce this risk, -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope is now split out
    into a separate CONFIG_KASAN_EXTRA Kconfig option, leading to stack
    frames that are smaller than 2 kilobytes most of the time on x86_64.  An
    earlier version of this patch also prevented combining KASAN_EXTRA with
    KASAN_INLINE, but that is no longer necessary with gcc-7.0.1.
    
    All patches to get the frame size below 2048 bytes with CONFIG_KASAN=y
    and CONFIG_KASAN_EXTRA=n have been merged by maintainers now, so we can
    bring back that default now.  KASAN_EXTRA=y still causes lots of
    warnings but now defaults to !COMPILE_TEST to disable it in
    allmodconfig, and it remains disabled in all other defconfigs since it
    is a new option.  I arbitrarily raise the warning limit for KASAN_EXTRA
    to 3072 to reduce the noise, but an allmodconfig kernel still has around
    50 warnings on gcc-7.
    
    I experimented a bit more with smaller stack frames and have another
    follow-up series that reduces the warning limit for 64-bit architectures
    to 1280 bytes (without CONFIG_KASAN).
    
    With earlier versions of this patch series, I also had patches to address
    the warnings we get with KASAN and/or KASAN_EXTRA, using a
    "noinline_if_stackbloat" annotation.
    
    That annotation now got replaced with a gcc-8 bugfix (see
    https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=81715) and a workaround for
    older compilers, which means that KASAN_EXTRA is now just as bad as
    before and will lead to an instant stack overflow in a few extreme
    cases.
    
    This reverts parts of commit 3f181b4d8652 ("lib/Kconfig.debug: disable
    -Wframe-larger-than warnings with KASAN=y").  Two patches in linux-next
    should be merged first to avoid introducing warnings in an allmodconfig
    build:
      3cd890dbe2a4 ("media: dvb-frontends: fix i2c access helpers for KASAN")
      16c3ada89cff ("media: r820t: fix r820t_write_reg for KASAN")
    
    Do we really need to backport this?
    
    I think we do: without this patch, enabling KASAN will lead to
    unavoidable kernel stack overflow in certain device drivers when built
    with gcc-7 or higher on linux-4.10+ or any version that contains a
    backport of commit c5caf21ab0cf8.  Most people are probably still on
    older compilers, but it will get worse over time as they upgrade their
    distros.
    
    The warnings we get on kernels older than this should all be for code
    that uses dangerously large stack frames, though most of them do not
    cause an actual stack overflow by themselves.The asan-stack option was
    added in linux-4.0, and commit 3f181b4d8652 ("lib/Kconfig.debug:
    disable -Wframe-larger-than warnings with KASAN=y") effectively turned
    off the warning for allmodconfig kernels, so I would like to see this
    fix backported to any kernels later than 4.0.
    
    I have done dozens of fixes for individual functions with stack frames
    larger than 2048 bytes with asan-stack, and I plan to make sure that
    all those fixes make it into the stable kernels as well (most are
    already there).
    
    Part of the complication here is that asan-stack (from 4.0) was
    originally assumed to always require much larger stacks, but that
    turned out to be a combination of multiple gcc bugs that we have now
    worked around and fixed, but sanitize-address-use-after-scope (from
    v4.10) has a much higher inherent stack usage and also suffers from at
    least three other problems that we have analyzed but not yet fixed
    upstream, each of them makes the stack usage more severe than it should
    be.

    kasan: don't emit builtin calls when sanitization is off
    
    commit 0e410e158e5baa1300bdf678cea4f4e0cf9d8b94 upstream.
    
    With KASAN enabled the kernel has two different memset() functions, one
    with KASAN checks (memset) and one without (__memset).  KASAN uses some
    macro tricks to use the proper version where required.  For example
    memset() calls in mm/slub.c are without KASAN checks, since they operate
    on poisoned slab object metadata.
    
    The issue is that clang emits memset() calls even when there is no
    memset() in the source code.  They get linked with improper memset()
    implementation and the kernel fails to boot due to a huge amount of KASAN
    reports during early boot stages.
    
    The solution is to add -fno-builtin flag for files with KASAN_SANITIZE :=
    n marker.

    Btrfs: raid56: iterate raid56 internal bio with bio_for_each_segment_all
    
    commit 0198e5b707cfeb5defbd1b71b1ec6e71580d7db9 upstream.
    
    Bio iterated by set_bio_pages_uptodate() is raid56 internal one, so it
    will never be a BIO_CLONED bio, and since this is called by end_io
    functions, bio->bi_iter.bi_size is zero, we mustn't use
    bio_for_each_segment() as that is a no-op if bi_size is zero.

    afs: Fix server list handling
    
    commit 45df8462730d2149834980d3db16e2d2b9daaf60 upstream.
    
    Fix server list handling in the following ways:
    
     (1) In afs_alloc_volume(), remove duplicate server list build code.  This
         was already done by afs_alloc_server_list() which afs_alloc_volume()
         previously called.  This just results in twice as many VL RPCs.
    
     (2) In afs_deliver_vl_get_entry_by_name_u(), use the number of server
         records indicated by ->nServers in the UVLDB record returned by the
         VL.GetEntryByNameU RPC call rather than scanning all NMAXNSERVERS
         slots.  Unused slots may contain garbage.
    
     (3) In afs_alloc_server_list(), don't stop converting a UVLDB record into
         a server list just because we can't look up one of the servers.  Just
         skip that server and go on to the next.  If we can't look up any of
         the servers then we'll fail at the end.
    
    Without this patch, an attempt to view the umich.edu root cell using
    something like "ls /afs/umich.edu" on a dynamic root (future patch) mount
    or an autocell mount will result in ENOMEDIUM.  The failure is due to kafs
    not stopping after nServers'worth of records have been read, but then
    trying to access a server with a garbage UUID and getting an error, which
    aborts the server list build.

    afs: Fix missing cursor clearance
    
    commit fe4d774c847398c2a45c10a780ccfde069840793 upstream.
    
    afs_select_fileserver() ends the address cursor it is using in the case in
    which we get some sort of network error and run out of addresses to iterate
    through, before it jumps to try the next server.  This also needs to be
    done when the server aborts with some sort of error that means we should
    try the next server.
    
    Fix this by:
    
     (1) Move the iterate_address afs_end_cursor() call to the next_server
         case.
    
     (2) End the cursor in the failed case.
    
     (3) Make afs_end_cursor() clear the ->begun flag and ->addr pointer in the
         address cursor.
    
     (4) Make afs_end_cursor() able to be called on an already cleared cursor.
    
    Without this, something like the following oops may occur:

    afs_alloc_volume() needs to release the cell ref it obtained in the case of

    watchdog: imx2_wdt: restore previous timeout after suspend+resume
    
    commit 0be267255cef64e1c58475baa7b25568355a3816 upstream.
    
    When the watchdog device is suspended, its timeout is set to the maximum
    value. During resume, the previously set timeout should be restored.
    This does not work at the moment.
    
    The suspend function calls
    
    imx2_wdt_set_timeout(wdog, IMX2_WDT_MAX_TIME);
    
    and resume reverts this by calling
    
    imx2_wdt_set_timeout(wdog, wdog->timeout);
    
    However, imx2_wdt_set_timeout() updates wdog->timeout. Therefore,
    wdog->timeout is set to IMX2_WDT_MAX_TIME when we enter the resume
    function.
    
    Fix this by adding a new function __imx2_wdt_set_timeout() which
    only updates the hardware settings. imx2_wdt_set_timeout() now calls
    __imx2_wdt_set_timeout() and then saves the new timeout to
    wdog->timeout.
    
    During suspend, we call __imx2_wdt_set_timeout() directly so that
    wdog->timeout won't be updated and we can restore the previous value
    during resume. This approach makes wdog->timeout different from the
    actual setting in the hardware which is usually not a good thing.
    However, the two differ only while we're suspended and no kernel code is
    running, so it should be ok in this case.

    ASoC: compress: Correct handling of copy callback
    
    commit 290df4d3ab192821b66857c05346b23056ee9545 upstream.
    
    The soc_compr_copy callback is currently broken. Since the
    changes to move the compr_ops over to the component the return
    value is not correctly propagated, always returning zero on
    success rather than the number of bytes copied. This causes
    user-space to stall continuously reading as it does not believe
    it has received any data.
    
    Furthermore, the changes to move the compr_ops over to the
    component iterate through the list of components and will call
    the copy callback for any that have compressed ops. There isn't
    currently any consensus on the mechanism to combine the results
    of multiple copy callbacks.
    
    To fix this issue for now halt searching the component list when
    we locate a copy callback and return the result of that single
    callback. Additional work should probably be done to look at the
    other ops, tidy things up, and work out if we want to support
    multiple components on a single compressed, but this is the only
    fix required to get things working again.

    ASoC: rockchip: i2s: fix playback after runtime resume
    
    commit c66234cfedfc3e6e3b62563a5f2c1562be09a35d upstream.
    
    When restoring registers during runtime resume, we must not write to
    I2S_TXDR which is the transmit FIFO as this queues up a sample to be
    output and pushes all of the output channels down by one.
    
    This can be demonstrated with the speaker-test utility:
    
            for i in a b c; do speaker-test -c 2 -s 1; done
    
    which should play a test through the left speaker three times but if the
    I2S hardware starts runtime suspended the first sample will be played
    through the right speaker.
    
    Fix this by marking I2S_TXDR as volatile (which also requires marking it
    as readble, even though it technically isn't).  This seems to be the
    most robust fix, the alternative of giving I2S_TXDR a default value is
    more fragile since it does not prevent regcache writing to the register
    in all circumstances.
    
    While here, also fix the configuration of I2S_RXDR and I2S_FIFOLR; these
    are not writable so they do not suffer from the same problem as I2S_TXDR
    but reading from I2S_RXDR does suffer from a similar problem.

    ASoC: acpi: fix machine driver selection based on quirk
    
    commit 5c256045b87b8aa8e5bc9d2e2fdc0802351c1f99 upstream.
    
    The ACPI/machine-driver code refactoring introduced in 4.13 introduced
    a regression for cases where we need a DMI-based quirk to select the
    machine driver (the BIOS reports an invalid HID). The fix is just to
    make sure the results of the quirk are actually used.

    KVM: arm/arm64: Handle CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED
    
    commit 58d6b15e9da5042a99c9c30ad725792e4569150e upstream.
    
    cpu_pm_enter() calls the pm notifier chain with CPU_PM_ENTER, then if
    there is a failure: CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED.
    
    When KVM receives CPU_PM_ENTER it calls cpu_hyp_reset() which will
    return us to the hyp-stub. If we subsequently get a CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED,
    KVM does nothing, leaving the CPU running with the hyp-stub, at odds
    with kvm_arm_hardware_enabled.
    
    Add CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED as a fallthrough for CPU_PM_EXIT, this reloads
    KVM based on kvm_arm_hardware_enabled. This is safe even if CPU_PM_ENTER
    never gets as far as KVM, as cpu_hyp_reinit() calls cpu_hyp_reset()
    to make sure the hyp-stub is loaded before reloading KVM.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Drop locks before reading guest memory
    
    commit 36ee41d161c67a6fcf696d4817a0da31f778938c upstream.
    
    Running with CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP reveals that HV KVM tries to
    read guest memory, in order to emulate guest instructions, while
    preempt is disabled and a vcore lock is held.  This occurs in
    kvmppc_handle_exit_hv(), called from post_guest_process(), when
    emulating guest doorbell instructions on POWER9 systems, and also
    when checking whether we have hit a hypervisor breakpoint.
    Reading guest memory can cause a page fault and thus cause the
    task to sleep, so we need to avoid reading guest memory while
    holding a spinlock or when preempt is disabled.
    
    To fix this, we move the preempt_enable() in kvmppc_run_core() to
    before the loop that calls post_guest_process() for each vcore that
    has just run, and we drop and re-take the vcore lock around the calls
    to kvmppc_emulate_debug_inst() and kvmppc_emulate_doorbell_instr().
    
    Dropping the lock is safe with respect to the iteration over the
    runnable vcpus in post_guest_process(); for_each_runnable_thread
    is actually safe to use locklessly.  It is possible for a vcpu
    to become runnable and add itself to the runnable_threads array
    (code near the beginning of kvmppc_run_vcpu()) and then get included
    in the iteration in post_guest_process despite the fact that it
    has not just run.  This is benign because vcpu->arch.trap and
    vcpu->arch.ceded will be zero.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make sure we don't re-enter guest without XIVE loaded
    
    commit 43ff3f65234061e08d234bdef5a9aadc19832b74 upstream.
    
    This fixes a bug where it is possible to enter a guest on a POWER9
    system without having the XIVE (interrupt controller) context loaded.
    This can happen because we unload the XIVE context from the CPU
    before doing the real-mode handling for machine checks.  After the
    real-mode handler runs, it is possible that we re-enter the guest
    via a fast path which does not load the XIVE context.
    
    To fix this, we move the unloading of the XIVE context to come after
    the real-mode machine check handler is called.

    KVM: nVMX: Fix bug of injecting L2 exception into L1
    
    commit 5c7d4f9ad39d980728b39752304ce10bb2960cbf upstream.
    
    kvm_clear_exception_queue() should clear pending exception.
    This also includes exceptions which were only marked pending but not
    yet injected. This is because exception.pending is used for both L1
    and L2 to determine if an exception should be raised to guest.
    Note that an exception which is pending but not yet injected will
    be raised again once the guest will be resumed.
    
    Consider the following scenario:
    1) L0 KVM with ignore_msrs=false.
    2) L1 prepare vmcs12 with the following:
        a) No intercepts on MSR (MSR_BITMAP exist and is filled with 0).
        b) No intercept for #GP.
        c) vmx-preemption-timer is configured.
    3) L1 enters into L2.
    4) L2 reads an unhandled MSR that exists in MSR_BITMAP
    (such as 0x1fff).
    
    L2 RDMSR could be handled as described below:
    1) L2 exits to L0 on RDMSR and calls handle_rdmsr().
    2) handle_rdmsr() calls kvm_inject_gp() which sets
    KVM_REQ_EVENT, exception.pending=true and exception.injected=false.
    3) vcpu_enter_guest() consumes KVM_REQ_EVENT and calls
    inject_pending_event() which calls vmx_check_nested_events()
    which sees that exception.pending=true but
    nested_vmx_check_exception() returns 0 and therefore does nothing at
    this point. However let's assume it later sees vmx-preemption-timer
    expired and therefore exits from L2 to L1 by calling
    nested_vmx_vmexit().
    4) nested_vmx_vmexit() calls prepare_vmcs12()
    which calls vmcs12_save_pending_event() but it does nothing as
    exception.injected is false. Also prepare_vmcs12() calls
    kvm_clear_exception_queue() which does nothing as
    exception.injected is already false.
    5) We now return from vmx_check_nested_events() with 0 while still
    having exception.pending=true!
    6) Therefore inject_pending_event() continues
    and we inject L2 exception to L1!...
    
    This commit will fix above issue by changing step (4) to
    clear exception.pending in kvm_clear_exception_queue().

    KVM: nVMX: Fix races when sending nested PI while dest enters/leaves L2
    
    commit 6b6977117f50d60455ace86b2d256f6fb4f3de05 upstream.
    
    Consider the following scenario:
    1. CPU A calls vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() to send an IPI
    to CPU B via virtual posted-interrupt mechanism.
    2. CPU B is currently executing L2 guest.
    3. vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() calls
    kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() which will note that
    vcpu->mode == IN_GUEST_MODE.
    4. Assume that before CPU A sends the physical POSTED_INTR_NESTED_VECTOR
    IPI, CPU B exits from L2 to L0 during event-delivery
    (valid IDT-vectoring-info).
    5. CPU A now sends the physical IPI. The IPI is received in host and
    it's handler (smp_kvm_posted_intr_nested_ipi()) does nothing.
    6. Assume that before CPU A sets pi_pending=true and KVM_REQ_EVENT,
    CPU B continues to run in L0 and reach vcpu_enter_guest(). As
    KVM_REQ_EVENT is not set yet, vcpu_enter_guest() will continue and resume
    L2 guest.
    7. At this point, CPU A sets pi_pending=true and KVM_REQ_EVENT but
    it's too late! CPU B already entered L2 and KVM_REQ_EVENT will only be
    consumed at next L2 entry!
    
    Another scenario to consider:
    1. CPU A calls vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() to send an IPI
    to CPU B via virtual posted-interrupt mechanism.
    2. Assume that before CPU A calls kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt(),
    CPU B is at L0 and is about to resume into L2. Further assume that it is
    in vcpu_enter_guest() after check for KVM_REQ_EVENT.
    3. At this point, CPU A calls kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() which
    will note that vcpu->mode != IN_GUEST_MODE. Therefore, do nothing and
    return false. Then, will set pi_pending=true and KVM_REQ_EVENT.
    4. Now CPU B continue and resumes into L2 guest without processing
    the posted-interrupt until next L2 entry!
    
    To fix both issues, we just need to change
    vmx_deliver_nested_posted_interrupt() to set pi_pending=true and
    KVM_REQ_EVENT before calling kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt().
    
    It will fix the first scenario by chaging step (6) to note that
    KVM_REQ_EVENT and pi_pending=true and therefore process
    nested posted-interrupt.
    
    It will fix the second scenario by two possible ways:
    1. If kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() is called while CPU B has changed
    vcpu->mode to IN_GUEST_MODE, physical IPI will be sent and will be received
    when CPU resumes into L2.
    2. If kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt() is called while CPU B hasn't yet
    changed vcpu->mode to IN_GUEST_MODE, then after CPU B will change
    vcpu->mode it will call kvm_request_pending() which will return true and
    therefore force another round of vcpu_enter_guest() which will note that
    KVM_REQ_EVENT and pi_pending=true and therefore process nested
    posted-interrupt.

    commit 20e8175d246e9f9deb377f2784b3e7dfb2ad3e86 upstream.
    
    KVM doesn't follow the SMCCC when it comes to unimplemented calls,
    and inject an UNDEF instead of returning an error. Since firmware
    calls are now used for security mitigation, they are becoming more
    common, and the undef is counter productive.
    
    Instead, let's follow the SMCCC which states that -1 must be returned
    to the caller when getting an unknown function number.

    crypto: sha512-mb - initialize pending lengths correctly
    
    commit eff84b379089cd8b4e83599639c1f5f6e34ef7bf upstream.
    
    The SHA-512 multibuffer code keeps track of the number of blocks pending
    in each lane.  The minimum of these values is used to identify the next
    lane that will be completed.  Unused lanes are set to a large number
    (0xFFFFFFFF) so that they don't affect this calculation.
    
    However, it was forgotten to set the lengths to this value in the
    initial state, where all lanes are unused.  As a result it was possible
    for sha512_mb_mgr_get_comp_job_avx2() to select an unused lane, causing
    a NULL pointer dereference.  Specifically this could happen in the case
    where ->update() was passed fewer than SHA512_BLOCK_SIZE bytes of data,
    so it then called sha_complete_job() without having actually submitted
    any blocks to the multi-buffer code.  This hit a NULL pointer
    dereference if another task happened to have submitted blocks
    concurrently to the same CPU and the flush timer had not yet expired.
    
    Fix this by initializing sha512_mb_mgr->lens correctly.
    
    As usual, this bug was found by syzkaller.

    crypto: caam - fix endless loop when DECO acquire fails
    
    commit 225ece3e7dad4cfc44cca38ce7a3a80f255ea8f1 upstream.
    
    In case DECO0 cannot be acquired - i.e. run_descriptor_deco0() fails
    with -ENODEV, caam_probe() enters an endless loop:
    
    run_descriptor_deco0
            ret -ENODEV
            -> instantiate_rng
                    -ENODEV, overwritten by -EAGAIN
                    ret -EAGAIN
                    -> caam_probe
                            -EAGAIN results in endless loop
    
    It turns out the error path in instantiate_rng() is incorrect,
    the checks are done in the wrong order.

    commit 273caa260035c03d89ad63d72d8cd3d9e5c5e3f1 upstream.
    
    If the device is of type VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV then vdev->ioctl_ops
    is NULL so the 'if (!ops->vidioc_query_ext_ctrl)' check would crash.
    Add a test for !ops to the condition.
    
    All sub-devices that have controls will use the control framework,
    so they do not have an equivalent to ops->vidioc_query_ext_ctrl.
    Returning false if ops is NULL is the correct thing to do here.

    media: v4l2-compat-ioctl32.c: refactor compat ioctl32 logic
    
    commit a1dfb4c48cc1e64eeb7800a27c66a6f7e88d075a upstream.
    
    The 32-bit compat v4l2 ioctl handling is implemented based on its 64-bit
    equivalent. It converts 32-bit data structures into its 64-bit
    equivalents and needs to provide the data to the 64-bit ioctl in user
    space memory which is commonly allocated using
    compat_alloc_user_space().
    
    However, due to how that function is implemented, it can only be called
    a single time for every syscall invocation.
    
    Supposedly to avoid this limitation, the existing code uses a mix of
    memory from the kernel stack and memory allocated through
    compat_alloc_user_space().
    
    Under normal circumstances, this would not work, because the 64-bit
    ioctl expects all pointers to point to user space memory. As a
    workaround, set_fs(KERNEL_DS) is called to temporarily disable this
    extra safety check and allow kernel pointers. However, this might
    introduce a security vulnerability: The result of the 32-bit to 64-bit
    conversion is writeable by user space because the output buffer has been
    allocated via compat_alloc_user_space(). A malicious user space process
    could then manipulate pointers inside this output buffer, and due to the
    previous set_fs(KERNEL_DS) call, functions like get_user() or put_user()
    no longer prevent kernel memory access.
    
    The new approach is to pre-calculate the total amount of user space
    memory that is needed, allocate it using compat_alloc_user_space() and
    then divide up the allocated memory to accommodate all data structures
    that need to be converted.
    
    An alternative approach would have been to retain the union type karg
    that they allocated on the kernel stack in do_video_ioctl(), copy all
    data from user space into karg and then back to user space. However, we
    decided against this approach because it does not align with other
    compat syscall implementations. Instead, we tried to replicate the
    get_user/put_user pairs as found in other places in the kernel:
    
        if (get_user(clipcount, &up->clipcount) ||
            put_user(clipcount, &kp->clipcount)) return -EFAULT;
    
    Notes from hans.verkuil@cisco.com:
    
    This patch was taken from:
        https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_samsung_apq8084/commit/97b733953c06e4f0398ade18850f0817778255f7
    
    Clearly nobody could be bothered to upstream this patch or at minimum
    tell us :-( We only heard about this a week ago.
    
    This patch was rebased and cleaned up. Compared to the original I
    also swapped the order of the convert_in_user arguments so that they
    matched copy_in_user. It was hard to review otherwise. I also replaced
    the ALLOC_USER_SPACE/ALLOC_AND_GET by a normal function.

    crypto: hash - prevent using keyed hashes without setting key
    
    commit 9fa68f620041be04720d0cbfb1bd3ddfc6310b24 upstream.
    
    Currently, almost none of the keyed hash algorithms check whether a key
    has been set before proceeding.  Some algorithms are okay with this and
    will effectively just use a key of all 0's or some other bogus default.
    However, others will severely break, as demonstrated using
    "hmac(sha3-512-generic)", the unkeyed use of which causes a kernel crash
    via a (potentially exploitable) stack buffer overflow.
    
    A while ago, this problem was solved for AF_ALG by pairing each hash
    transform with a 'has_key' bool.  However, there are still other places
    in the kernel where userspace can specify an arbitrary hash algorithm by
    name, and the kernel uses it as unkeyed hash without checking whether it
    is really unkeyed.  Examples of this include:
    
        - KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE, via the KDF extension
        - dm-verity
        - dm-crypt, via the ESSIV support
        - dm-integrity, via the "internal hash" mode with no key given
        - drbd (Distributed Replicated Block Device)
    
    This bug is especially bad for KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE as that requires no
    privileges to call.
    
    Fix the bug for all users by adding a flag CRYPTO_TFM_NEED_KEY to the
    ->crt_flags of each hash transform that indicates whether the transform
    still needs to be keyed or not.  Then, make the hash init, import, and
    digest functions return -ENOKEY if the key is still needed.
    
    The new flag also replaces the 'has_key' bool which algif_hash was
    previously using, thereby simplifying the algif_hash implementation.

    crypto: hash - annotate algorithms taking optional key
    
    commit a208fa8f33031b9e0aba44c7d1b7e68eb0cbd29e upstream.
    
    We need to consistently enforce that keyed hashes cannot be used without
    setting the key.  To do this we need a reliable way to determine whether
    a given hash algorithm is keyed or not.  AF_ALG currently does this by
    checking for the presence of a ->setkey() method.  However, this is
    actually slightly broken because the CRC-32 algorithms implement
    ->setkey() but can also be used without a key.  (The CRC-32 "key" is not
    actually a cryptographic key but rather represents the initial state.
    If not overridden, then a default initial state is used.)
    
    Prepare to fix this by introducing a flag CRYPTO_ALG_OPTIONAL_KEY which
    indicates that the algorithm has a ->setkey() method, but it is not
    required to be called.  Then set it on all the CRC-32 algorithms.
    
    The same also applies to the Adler-32 implementation in Lustre.
    
    Also, the cryptd and mcryptd templates have to pass through the flag
    from their underlying algorithm.

    crypto: poly1305 - remove ->setkey() method
    
    commit a16e772e664b9a261424107784804cffc8894977 upstream.
    
    Since Poly1305 requires a nonce per invocation, the Linux kernel
    implementations of Poly1305 don't use the crypto API's keying mechanism
    and instead expect the key and nonce as the first 32 bytes of the data.
    But ->setkey() is still defined as a stub returning an error code.  This
    prevents Poly1305 from being used through AF_ALG and will also break it
    completely once we start enforcing that all crypto API users (not just
    AF_ALG) call ->setkey() if present.
    
    Fix it by removing crypto_poly1305_setkey(), leaving ->setkey as NULL.

    crypto: mcryptd - pass through absence of ->setkey()
    
    commit fa59b92d299f2787e6bae1ff078ee0982e80211f upstream.
    
    When the mcryptd template is used to wrap an unkeyed hash algorithm,
    don't install a ->setkey() method to the mcryptd instance.  This change
    is necessary for mcryptd to keep working with unkeyed hash algorithms
    once we start enforcing that ->setkey() is called when present.

    crypto: hash - introduce crypto_hash_alg_has_setkey()
    
    commit cd6ed77ad5d223dc6299fb58f62e0f5267f7e2ba upstream.
    
    Templates that use an shash spawn can use crypto_shash_alg_has_setkey()
    to determine whether the underlying algorithm requires a key or not.
    But there was no corresponding function for ahash spawns.  Add it.
    
    Note that the new function actually has to support both shash and ahash
    algorithms, since the ahash API can be used with either.

    commit ca1b4974bd237f2373b0e980b11957aac3499b56 upstream.
    
    Intel uses different SATA PCI ids for the Desktop and Mobile SKUs of their
    chipsets. For older models the comment describing which chipset the PCI id
    is for, aksi indicates when we're dealing with a mobile SKU. Extend the
    comments for recent chipsets to also indicate mobile SKUs.
    
    The information this commit adds comes from Intel's chipset datasheets.
    
    This commit is a preparation patch for allowing a different default

    kernfs: fix regression in kernfs_fop_write caused by wrong type

    nfsd: Detect unhashed stids in nfsd4_verify_open_stid()
    
    commit 4f1764172a0aa7395d12b96cae640ca1438c5085 upstream.
    
    The state of the stid is guaranteed by 2 locks:
    - The nfs4_client 'cl_lock' spinlock
    - The nfs4_ol_stateid 'st_mutex' mutex
    
    so it is quite possible for the stid to be unhashed after lookup,
    but before calling nfsd4_lock_ol_stateid(). So we do need to check
    for a zero value for 'sc_type' in nfsd4_verify_open_stid().

    NFS: reject request for id_legacy key without auxdata
    
    commit 49686cbbb3ebafe42e63868222f269d8053ead00 upstream.
    
    nfs_idmap_legacy_upcall() is supposed to be called with 'aux' pointing
    to a 'struct idmap', via the call to request_key_with_auxdata() in
    nfs_idmap_request_key().
    
    However it can also be reached via the request_key() system call in
    which case 'aux' will be NULL, causing a NULL pointer dereference in
    nfs_idmap_prepare_pipe_upcall(), assuming that the key description is
    valid enough to get that far.
    
    Fix this by making nfs_idmap_legacy_upcall() negate the key if no
    auxdata is provided.
    
    As usual, this bug was found by syzkaller.  A simple reproducer using
    the command-line keyctl program is:
    
        keyctl request2 id_legacy uid:0 '' @s

    If some of the WRITE calls making up an O_DIRECT write syscall fail,
    we neglect to commit, even if some of the WRITEs succeed.
    
    We also depend on the commit code to free the reference count on the
    nfs_page taken in the "if (request_commit)" case at the end of
    nfs_direct_write_completion().  The problem was originally noticed
    because ENOSPC's encountered partway through a write would result in a
    closed file being sillyrenamed when it should have been unlinked.

    commit 8634ef5e05311f32d7f2aee06f6b27a8834a3bd6 upstream.
    
    The LOOKUPP operation was inserted into the nfs4_procedures array
    rather than being appended, which put /proc/net/rpc/nfs out of
    whack, and broke the nfsstat utility.
    Fix by moving the LOOKUPP operation to the end of the array, and

    commit 7ff4cff637aa0bd2abbd81f53b2a6206c50afd95 upstream.
    
    A pNFS server may return LAYOUTUNAVAILABLE error on LAYOUTGET for files
    which don't have any layout. In this situation pnfs_update_layout
    currently returns NULL. As this NULL is converted into ENOMEM, IO

    Do not return ENOMEM on LAYOUTUNAVAILABLE and let client retry through

    nfs/pnfs: fix nfs_direct_req ref leak when i/o falls back to the mds
    
    commit ba4a76f703ab7eb72941fdaac848502073d6e9ee upstream.
    
    Currently when falling back to doing I/O through the MDS (via
    pnfs_{read|write}_through_mds), the client frees the nfs_pgio_header
    without releasing the reference taken on the dreq
    via pnfs_generic_pg_{read|write}pages -> nfs_pgheader_init ->
    nfs_direct_pgio_init.  It then takes another reference on the dreq via
    nfs_generic_pg_pgios -> nfs_pgheader_init -> nfs_direct_pgio_init and
    as a result the requester will become stuck in inode_dio_wait.  Once
    that happens, other processes accessing the inode will become stuck as
    well.
    
    Ensure that pnfs_read_through_mds() and pnfs_write_through_mds() clean
    up correctly by calling hdr->completion_ops->completion() instead of
    calling hdr->release() directly.
    
    This can be reproduced (sometimes) by performing "storage failover
    takeover" commands on NetApp filer while doing direct I/O from a client.
    
    This can also be reproduced using SystemTap to simulate a failure while
    doing direct I/O from a client (from Dave Wysochanski
    <dwysocha@redhat.com>):
    
    stap -v -g -e 'probe module("nfs_layout_nfsv41_files").function("nfs4_fl_prepare_ds").return { $return=NULL; exit(); }'

    This fixes a race with idr_alloc where gd->first_minor can be set to the

    calls device_add_disk with the same first_minor.  device_add_disk calls
    bdi_register_owner which generates several warnings.

    ubi: fastmap: Erase outdated anchor PEBs during attach
    
    commit f78e5623f45bab2b726eec29dc5cefbbab2d0b1c upstream.
    
    The fastmap update code might erase the current fastmap anchor PEB
    in case it doesn't find any new free PEB. When a power cut happens
    in this situation we must not have any outdated fastmap anchor PEB
    on the device, because that would be used to attach during next
    boot.
    The easiest way to make that sure is to erase all outdated fastmap
    anchor PEBs synchronously during attach.

    mtd: nand: sunxi: Fix ECC strength choice
    
    commit f4c6cd1a7f2275d5bc0e494b21fff26f8dde80f0 upstream.
    
    When the requested ECC strength does not exactly match the strengths
    supported by the ECC engine, the driver is selecting the closest
    strength meeting the 'selected_strength > requested_strength'
    constraint. Fix the fact that, in this particular case, ecc->strength
    value was not updated to match the 'selected_strength'.
    
    For instance, one can encounter this issue when no ECC requirement is
    filled in the device tree while the NAND chip minimum requirement is not
    a strength/step_size combo natively supported by the ECC engine.

    mtd: nand: Fix nand_do_read_oob() return value
    
    commit 87e89ce8d0d14f573c068c61bec2117751fb5103 upstream.
    
    Starting from commit 041e4575f034 ("mtd: nand: handle ECC errors in
    OOB"), nand_do_read_oob() (from the NAND core) did return 0 or a
    negative error, and the MTD layer expected it.
    
    However, the trend for the NAND layer is now to return an error or a
    positive number of bitflips. Deciding which status to return to the user
    belongs to the MTD layer.
    
    Commit e47f68587b82 ("mtd: check for max_bitflips in mtd_read_oob()")
    brought this logic to the mtd_read_oob() function while the return value
    coming from nand_do_read_oob() (called by the ->_read_oob() hook) was
    left unchanged.

    mtd: cfi: convert inline functions to macros
    
    commit 9e343e87d2c4c707ef8fae2844864d4dde3a2d13 upstream.
    
    The map_word_() functions, dating back to linux-2.6.8, try to perform
    bitwise operations on a 'map_word' structure. This may have worked
    with compilers that were current then (gcc-3.4 or earlier), but end
    up being rather inefficient on any version I could try now (gcc-4.4 or
    higher). Specifically we hit a problem analyzed in gcc PR81715 where we
    fail to reuse the stack space for local variables.
    
    This can be seen immediately in the stack consumption for
    cfi_staa_erase_varsize() and other functions that (with CONFIG_KASAN)
    can be up to 2200 bytes. Changing the inline functions into macros brings
    this down to 1280 bytes.  Without KASAN, the same problem exists, but
    the stack consumption is lower to start with, my patch shrinks it from
    920 to 496 bytes on with arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-5.4, and saves around
    1KB in .text size for cfi_cmdset_0020.c, as it avoids copying map_word
    structures for each call to one of these helpers.
    
    With the latest gcc-8 snapshot, the problem is fixed in upstream gcc,
    but nobody uses that yet, so we should still work around it in mainline
    kernels and probably backport the workaround to stable kernels as well.
    We had a couple of other functions that suffered from the same gcc bug,
    and all of those had a simpler workaround involving dummy variables
    in the inline function. Unfortunately that did not work here, the
    macro hack was the best I could come up with.
    
    It would also be helpful to have someone to a little performance testing
    on the patch, to see how much it helps in terms of CPU utilitzation.

    If vendors haven't updated their firmware to do SMCCC 1.1, they
    haven't updated PSCI either, so we don't loose anything.

    arm/arm64: smccc: Implement SMCCC v1.1 inline primitive
    
    
    Commit f2d3b2e8759a upstream.
    
    One of the major improvement of SMCCC v1.1 is that it only clobbers
    the first 4 registers, both on 32 and 64bit. This means that it
    becomes very easy to provide an inline version of the SMC call
    primitive, and avoid performing a function call to stash the
    registers that would otherwise be clobbered by SMCCC v1.0.

    Function identifiers are a 32bit, unsigned quantity. But we never

     4ac:   b26187e0        mov     x0, #0xffffffff80000001
    
    We thus rely on the firmware narrowing it for us, which is not
    always a reasonable expectation.

    arm64: Branch predictor hardening for Cavium ThunderX2
    
    
    Commit f3d795d9b360 upstream.
    
    Use PSCI based mitigation for speculative execution attacks targeting
    the branch predictor. We use the same mechanism as the one used for
    Cortex-A CPUs, we expect the PSCI version call to have a side effect
    of clearing the BTBs.

    Commit 30d88c0e3ace upstream.
    
    It is possible to take an IRQ from EL0 following a branch to a kernel
    address in such a way that the IRQ is prioritised over the instruction
    abort. Whilst an attacker would need to get the stars to align here,
    it might be sufficient with enough calibration so perform BP hardening
    in the rare case that we see a kernel address in the ELR when handling
    an IRQ from EL0.

    arm64: Move BP hardening to check_and_switch_context
    
    
    Commit a8e4c0a919ae upstream.
    
    We call arm64_apply_bp_hardening() from post_ttbr_update_workaround,
    which has the unexpected consequence of being triggered on every
    exception return to userspace when ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN is selected,
    even if no context switch actually occured.
    
    This is a bit suboptimal, and it would be more logical to only
    invalidate the branch predictor when we actually switch to
    a different mm.
    
    In order to solve this, move the call to arm64_apply_bp_hardening()
    into check_and_switch_context(), where we're guaranteed to pick
    a different mm context.

    Commit 0f15adbb2861 upstream.
    
    Aliasing attacks against CPU branch predictors can allow an attacker to

    arm64: Run enable method for errata work arounds on late CPUs
    
    
    Commit 55b35d070c25 upstream.
    
    When a CPU is brought up after we have finalised the system
    wide capabilities (i.e, features and errata), we make sure the
    new CPU doesn't need a new errata work around which has not been
    detected already. However we don't run enable() method on the new
    CPU for the errata work arounds already detected. This could
    cause the new CPU running without potential work arounds.
    It is upto the "enable()" method to decide if this CPU should
    do something about the errata.

    Commit edf298cfce47 upstream.
    
    this_cpu_has_cap() tests caps->desc not caps->matches, so it stops

    walking to the end of the list.
    
    Prior to v4.6's 644c2ae198412 ("arm64: cpufeature: Test 'matches' pointer
    to find the end of the list") we always tested desc to find the end of
    a capability list. This was changed for dubious things like PAN_NOT_UAO.
    v4.7's e3661b128e53e ("arm64: Allow a capability to be checked on
    single CPU") added this_cpu_has_cap() using the old desc style test.

    arm64: uaccess: Don't bother eliding access_ok checks in __{get, put}_user
    
    
    Commit 84624087dd7e upstream.
    
    access_ok isn't an expensive operation once the addr_limit for the current
    thread has been loaded into the cache. Given that the initial access_ok
    check preceding a sequence of __{get,put}_user operations will take
    the brunt of the miss, we can make the __* variants identical to the
    full-fat versions, which brings with it the benefits of address masking.
    
    The likely cost in these sequences will be from toggling PAN/UAO, which
    we can address later by implementing the *_unsafe versions.

    Similarly to x86, mitigate speculation past an access_ok() check by

    Even if we don't expect speculative writes per se, it is plausible that
    a CPU may still speculate at least as far as fetching a cache line for

    arm64: Make USER_DS an inclusive limit
    
    
    Commit 51369e398d0d upstream.
    
    Currently, USER_DS represents an exclusive limit while KERNEL_DS is
    inclusive. In order to do some clever trickery for speculation-safe
    masking, we need them both to behave equivalently - there aren't enough
    bits to make KERNEL_DS exclusive, so we have precisely one option. This
    also happens to correct a longstanding false negative for a range
    ending on the very top byte of kernel memory.
    
    Mark Rutland points out that we've actually got the semantics of
    addresses vs. segments muddled up in most of the places we need to
    amend, so shuffle the {USER,KERNEL}_DS definitions around such that we
    can correct those properly instead of just pasting "-1"s everywhere.

    perf: arm_spe: Fail device probe when arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0()
    
    
    Commit 7a4a0c1555b8 upstream.
    
    When running with the kernel unmapped whilst at EL0, the virtually-addressed
    SPE buffer is also unmapped, which can lead to buffer faults if userspace
    profiling is enabled and potentially also when writing back kernel samples
    unless an expensive drain operation is performed on exception return.
    
    For now, fail the SPE driver probe when arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0().

    Cavium ThunderX's erratum 27456 results in a corruption of icache

    arm64: kpti: Add ->enable callback to remap swapper using nG mappings
    
    
    Commit f992b4dfd58b upstream.
    
    Defaulting to global mappings for kernel space is generally good for
    performance and appears to be necessary for Cavium ThunderX. If we
    subsequently decide that we need to enable kpti, then we need to rewrite
    our existing page table entries to be non-global. This is fiddly, and
    made worse by the possible use of contiguous mappings, which require
    a strict break-before-make sequence.
    
    Since the enable callback runs on each online CPU from stop_machine
    context, we can have all CPUs enter the idmap, where secondaries can
    wait for the primary CPU to rewrite swapper with its MMU off. It's all
    fairly horrible, but at least it only runs once.

    arm64: kpti: Fix the interaction between ASID switching and software PAN
    
    
    Commit 6b88a32c7af6 upstream.
    
    With ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN enabled, the exception entry code checks the
    active ASID to decide whether user access was enabled (non-zero ASID)
    when the exception was taken. On return from exception, if user access
    was previously disabled, it re-instates TTBR0_EL1 from the per-thread
    saved value (updated in switch_mm() or efi_set_pgd()).
    
    Commit 7655abb95386 ("arm64: mm: Move ASID from TTBR0 to TTBR1") makes a
    TTBR0_EL1 + ASID switching non-atomic. Subsequently, commit 27a921e75711
    ("arm64: mm: Fix and re-enable ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN") changes the
    __uaccess_ttbr0_disable() function and asm macro to first write the
    reserved TTBR0_EL1 followed by the ASID=0 update in TTBR1_EL1. If an
    exception occurs between these two, the exception return code will
    re-instate a valid TTBR0_EL1. Similar scenario can happen in
    cpu_switch_mm() between setting the reserved TTBR0_EL1 and the ASID
    update in cpu_do_switch_mm().
    
    This patch reverts the entry.S check for ASID == 0 to TTBR0_EL1 and
    disables the interrupts around the TTBR0_EL1 and ASID switching code in
    __uaccess_ttbr0_disable(). It also ensures that, when returning from the
    EFI runtime services, efi_set_pgd() doesn't leave a non-zero ASID in
    TTBR1_EL1 by using uaccess_ttbr0_{enable,disable}.
    
    The accesses to current_thread_info()->ttbr0 are updated to use
    READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE.
    
    As a safety measure, __uaccess_ttbr0_enable() always masks out any
    existing non-zero ASID TTBR1_EL1 before writing in the new ASID.

    Sometimes a single capability could be listed multiple times with

    This breaks verify_local_cpu_feature() and this_cpu_has_cap() as
    we stop checking for a capability on a CPU with the first
    entry in the given table, which is not sufficient. Make sure we
    run the checks for all entries of the same capability. We do
    this by fixing __this_cpu_has_cap() to run through all the
    entries in the given table for a match and reuse it for
    verify_local_cpu_feature().

    arm64: use RET instruction for exiting the trampoline
    
    
    Commit be04a6d1126b upstream.
    
    Speculation attacks against the entry trampoline can potentially resteer
    the speculative instruction stream through the indirect branch and into
    arbitrary gadgets within the kernel.
    
    This patch defends against these attacks by forcing a misprediction
    through the return stack: a dummy BL instruction loads an entry into
    the stack, so that the predicted program flow of the subsequent RET
    instruction is to a branch-to-self instruction which is finally resolved
    as a branch to the kernel vectors with speculation suppressed.

    can issue a TLB invalidation to invalidate the walk cache prior to
    jumping into the kernel. There is still the possibility of a TLB conflict
    here due to conflicting walk cache entries prior to the invalidation, but
    this doesn't appear to be the case on these CPUs in practice.

    arm64: entry: Hook up entry trampoline to exception vectors
    
    
    Commit 4bf3286d29f3 upstream.
    
    Hook up the entry trampoline to our exception vectors so that all
    exceptions from and returns to EL0 go via the trampoline, which swizzles
    the vector base register accordingly. Transitioning to and from the
    kernel clobbers x30, so we use tpidrro_el0 and far_el1 as scratch
    registers for native tasks.

    arm64: mm: Map entry trampoline into trampoline and kernel page tables
    
    
    Commit 51a0048beb44 upstream.
    
    The exception entry trampoline needs to be mapped at the same virtual
    address in both the trampoline page table (which maps nothing else)
    and also the kernel page table, so that we can swizzle TTBR1_EL1 on
    exceptions from and return to EL0.
    
    This patch maps the trampoline at a fixed virtual address in the fixmap
    area of the kernel virtual address space, which allows the kernel proper
    to be randomized with respect to the trampoline when KASLR is enabled.

    Commit c7b9adaf85f8 upstream.
    
    To allow unmapping of the kernel whilst running at EL0, we need to
    point the exception vectors at an entry trampoline that can map/unmap
    the kernel on entry/exit respectively.
    
    This patch adds the trampoline page, although it is not yet plugged

    Commit fc0e1299da54 upstream.
    
    In order for code such as TLB invalidation to operate efficiently when
    the decision to map the kernel at EL0 is determined at runtime, this

    Currently, this just reports the value of CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0,
    but will later be hooked up to a fake CPU capability using a static key.

    Commit 85d13c001497 upstream.
    
    The pre_ttbr0_update_workaround hook is called prior to context-switching
    TTBR0 because Falkor erratum E1003 can cause TLB allocation with the wrong
    ASID if both the ASID and the base address of the TTBR are updated at
    the same time.
    
    With the ASID sitting safely in TTBR1, we no longer update things
    atomically, so we can remove the pre_ttbr0_update_workaround macro as
    it's no longer required. The erratum infrastructure and documentation
    is left around for #E1003, as it will be required by the entry
    trampoline code in a future patch.

    sched/rt: Up the root domain ref count when passing it around via IPIs
    
    commit 364f56653708ba8bcdefd4f0da2a42904baa8eeb upstream.
    
    When issuing an IPI RT push, where an IPI is sent to each CPU that has more
    than one RT task scheduled on it, it references the root domain's rto_mask,
    that contains all the CPUs within the root domain that has more than one RT
    task in the runable state. The problem is, after the IPIs are initiated, the
    rq->lock is released. This means that the root domain that is associated to
    the run queue could be freed while the IPIs are going around.
    
    Add a sched_get_rd() and a sched_put_rd() that will increment and decrement
    the root domain's ref count respectively. This way when initiating the IPIs,
    the scheduler will up the root domain's ref count before releasing the
    rq->lock, ensuring that the root domain does not go away until the IPI round
    is complete.

    sched/rt: Use container_of() to get root domain in rto_push_irq_work_func()
    
    commit ad0f1d9d65938aec72a698116cd73a980916895e upstream.
    
    When the rto_push_irq_work_func() is called, it looks at the RT overloaded
    bitmask in the root domain via the runqueue (rq->rd). The problem is that
    during CPU up and down, nothing here stops rq->rd from changing between
    taking the rq->rd->rto_lock and releasing it. That means the lock that is
    released is not the same lock that was taken.
    
    Instead of using this_rq()->rd to get the root domain, as the irq work is
    part of the root domain, we can simply get the root domain from the irq work
    that is passed to the routine:
    
     container_of(work, struct root_domain, rto_push_work)
    
    This keeps the root domain consistent.

    watchdog: gpio_wdt: set WDOG_HW_RUNNING in gpio_wdt_stop
    
    commit bc137dfdbec27c0ec5731a89002daded4a4aa1ea upstream.
    
    The first patch above (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9970181/)
    makes the oops go away, but it just papers over the problem. The real
    problem is that the watchdog core clears WDOG_HW_RUNNING in
    watchdog_stop, and the gpio driver fails to set it in its stop
    function when it doesn't actually stop it. This means that the core
    doesn't know that it now has responsibility for petting the device, in
    turn causing the device to reset the system (I hadn't noticed this
    because the board I'm working on has that reset logic disabled).
    
    How about this (other drivers may of course have the same problem, I
    haven't checked). One might say that ->stop should return an error
    when the device can't be stopped, but OTOH this brings parity between
    a device without a ->stop method and a GPIO wd that has always-running
    set. IOW, I think ->stop should only return an error when an actual
    attempt to stop the hardware failed.
    
    From: Rasmus Villemoes <rasmus.villemoes@prevas.dk>
    
    The watchdog framework clears WDOG_HW_RUNNING before calling
    ->stop. If the driver is unable to stop the device, it is supposed to
    set that bit again so that the watchdog core takes care of sending
    heart-beats while the device is not open from user-space. Update the
    gpio_wdt driver to honour that contract (and get rid of the redundant
    clearing of WDOG_HW_RUNNING).

    ssb: Do not disable PCI host on non-Mips
    
    commit a9e6d44ddeccd3522670e641f1ed9b068e746ff7 upstream.
    
    After upgrading an old laptop to 4.15-rc9, I found that the eth0 and
    wlan0 interfaces had disappeared.  It turns out that the b43 and b44
    drivers require SSB_PCIHOST_POSSIBLE which depends on
    PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY, a config option that only exists on Mips.

    cifs: Fix autonegotiate security settings mismatch
    
    commit 9aca7e454415f7878b28524e76bebe1170911a88 upstream.
    
    Autonegotiation gives a security settings mismatch error if the SMB
    server selects an SMBv3 dialect that isn't SMB3.02. The exact error is
    "protocol revalidation - security settings mismatch".
    This can be tested using Samba v4.2 or by setting the global Samba
    setting max protocol = SMB3_00.
    
    The check that fails in smb3_validate_negotiate is the dialect
    verification of the negotiate info response. This is because it tries
    to verify against the protocol_id in the global smbdefault_values. The
    protocol_id in smbdefault_values is SMB3.02.
    In SMB2_negotiate the protocol_id in smbdefault_values isn't updated,
    it is global so it probably shouldn't be, but server->dialect is.
    
    This patch changes the check in smb3_validate_negotiate to use
    server->dialect instead of server->vals->protocol_id. The patch works
    with autonegotiate and when using a specific version in the vers mount
    option.

    watchdog: indydog: Add dependency on SGI_HAS_INDYDOG
    
    commit 24f8d233074badd4c18e4dafd2fb97d65838afed upstream.
    
    Commit da2a68b3eb47 ("watchdog: Enable COMPILE_TEST where possible")
    enabled building the Indy watchdog driver when COMPILE_TEST is enabled.
    However, the driver makes reference to symbols that are only defined for
    certain platforms are selected in the config. These platforms select
    SGI_HAS_INDYDOG. Without this, link time errors result, for example
    when building a MIPS allyesconfig.
    
    drivers/watchdog/indydog.o: In function `indydog_write':
    indydog.c:(.text+0x18): undefined reference to `sgimc'
    indydog.c:(.text+0x1c): undefined reference to `sgimc'
    drivers/watchdog/indydog.o: In function `indydog_start':

    make: *** [Makefile:1005: vmlinux] Error 1
    
    Fix this by ensuring that CONFIG_INDIDOG can only be selected when the
    necessary dependent platform symbols are built in.
