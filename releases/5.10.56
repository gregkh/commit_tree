    can: j1939: j1939_session_deactivate(): clarify lifetime of session object
    
    commit 0c71437dd50dd687c15d8ca80b3b68f10bb21d63 upstream.
    
    The j1939_session_deactivate() is decrementing the session ref-count and
    potentially can free() the session. This would cause use-after-free
    situation.
    
    However, the code calling j1939_session_deactivate() does always hold
    another reference to the session, so that it would not be free()ed in
    this code path.
    
    This patch adds a comment to make this clear and a WARN_ON, to ensure
    that future changes will not violate this requirement. Further this
    patch avoids dereferencing the session pointer as a precaution to avoid
    use-after-free if the session is actually free()ed.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix regression while building external modules
    
    commit 333cf507465fbebb3727f5b53e77538467df312a upstream.
    
    With commit c9f3401313a5 ("powerpc: Always enable queued spinlocks for
    64s, disable for others") CONFIG_PPC_QUEUED_SPINLOCKS is always
    enabled on ppc64le, external modules that use spinlock APIs are
    failing.
    
      ERROR: modpost: GPL-incompatible module XXX.ko uses GPL-only symbol 'shared_processor'
    
    Before the above commit, modules were able to build without any
    issues. Also this problem is not seen on other architectures. This
    problem can be workaround if CONFIG_UNINLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK is enabled in
    the config. However CONFIG_UNINLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK is not enabled by
    default and only enabled in certain conditions like
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCKS is set in the kernel config.
    
      #include <linux/module.h>
      spinlock_t spLock;
    
      static int __init spinlock_test_init(void)
      {
              spin_lock_init(&spLock);
              spin_lock(&spLock);
              spin_unlock(&spLock);
              return 0;
      }
    
      static void __exit spinlock_test_exit(void)
      {
            printk("spinlock_test unloaded\n");
      }
      module_init(spinlock_test_init);
      module_exit(spinlock_test_exit);
    
      MODULE_DESCRIPTION ("spinlock_test");
      MODULE_LICENSE ("non-GPL");
      MODULE_AUTHOR ("Srikar Dronamraju");
    
    Given that spin locks are one of the basic facilities for module code,
    this effectively makes it impossible to build/load almost any non GPL
    modules on ppc64le.
    
    This was first reported at https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/11172
    
    Currently shared_processor is exported as GPL only symbol.
    Fix this for parity with other architectures by exposing
    shared_processor to non-GPL modules too.

    SMB3: fix readpage for large swap cache
    
    commit f2a26a3cff27dfa456fef386fe5df56dcb4b47b6 upstream.
    
    readpage was calculating the offset of the page incorrectly
    for the case of large swapcaches.
    
        loff_t offset = (loff_t)page->index << PAGE_SHIFT;
    
    As pointed out by Matthew Wilcox, this needs to use
    page_file_offset() to calculate the offset instead.
    Pages coming from the swap cache have page->index set
    to their index within the swapcache, not within the backing
    file.  For a sufficiently large swapcache, we could have
    overlapping values of page->index within the same backing file.

    bpf: Fix pointer arithmetic mask tightening under state pruning
    
    commit e042aa532c84d18ff13291d00620502ce7a38dda upstream.
    
    In 7fedb63a8307 ("bpf: Tighten speculative pointer arithmetic mask") we
    narrowed the offset mask for unprivileged pointer arithmetic in order to
    mitigate a corner case where in the speculative domain it is possible to
    advance, for example, the map value pointer by up to value_size-1 out-of-
    bounds in order to leak kernel memory via side-channel to user space.
    
    The verifier's state pruning for scalars leaves one corner case open
    where in the first verification path R_x holds an unknown scalar with an
    aux->alu_limit of e.g. 7, and in a second verification path that same
    register R_x, here denoted as R_x', holds an unknown scalar which has
    tighter bounds and would thus satisfy range_within(R_x, R_x') as well as
    tnum_in(R_x, R_x') for state pruning, yielding an aux->alu_limit of 3:
    Given the second path fits the register constraints for pruning, the final
    generated mask from aux->alu_limit will remain at 7. While technically
    not wrong for the non-speculative domain, it would however be possible
    to craft similar cases where the mask would be too wide as in 7fedb63a8307.
    
    One way to fix it is to detect the presence of unknown scalar map pointer
    arithmetic and force a deeper search on unknown scalars to ensure that
    we do not run into a masking mismatch.

    commit c9e73e3d2b1eb1ea7ff068e05007eec3bd8ef1c9 upstream.
    
    func_states_equal makes a very short lived allocation for idmap,
    probably because it's too large to fit on the stack. However the
    function is called quite often, leading to a lot of alloc / free
    churn. Replace the temporary allocation with dedicated scratch

    bpf: Remove superfluous aux sanitation on subprog rejection
    
    commit 59089a189e3adde4cf85f2ce479738d1ae4c514d upstream.
    
    Follow-up to fe9a5ca7e370 ("bpf: Do not mark insn as seen under speculative
    path verification"). The sanitize_insn_aux_data() helper does not serve a
    particular purpose in today's code. The original intention for the helper
    was that if function-by-function verification fails, a given program would
    be cleared from temporary insn_aux_data[], and then its verification would
    be re-attempted in the context of the main program a second time.
    
    However, a failure in do_check_subprogs() will skip do_check_main() and
    propagate the error to the user instead, thus such situation can never occur.
    Given its interaction is not compatible to the Spectre v1 mitigation (due to
    comparing aux->seen with env->pass_cnt), just remove sanitize_insn_aux_data()
    to avoid future bugs in this area.

    bpf: Fix leakage due to insufficient speculative store bypass mitigation
    
    [ Upstream commit 2039f26f3aca5b0e419b98f65dd36481337b86ee ]
    
    Spectre v4 gadgets make use of memory disambiguation, which is a set of
    techniques that execute memory access instructions, that is, loads and
    stores, out of program order; Intel's optimization manual, section 2.4.4.5:
    
      A load instruction micro-op may depend on a preceding store. Many
      microarchitectures block loads until all preceding store addresses are
      known. The memory disambiguator predicts which loads will not depend on
      any previous stores. When the disambiguator predicts that a load does
      not have such a dependency, the load takes its data from the L1 data
      cache. Eventually, the prediction is verified. If an actual conflict is
      detected, the load and all succeeding instructions are re-executed.
    
    af86ca4e3088 ("bpf: Prevent memory disambiguation attack") tried to mitigate
    this attack by sanitizing the memory locations through preemptive "fast"
    (low latency) stores of zero prior to the actual "slow" (high latency) store
    of a pointer value such that upon dependency misprediction the CPU then
    speculatively executes the load of the pointer value and retrieves the zero
    value instead of the attacker controlled scalar value previously stored at
    that location, meaning, subsequent access in the speculative domain is then
    redirected to the "zero page".
    
    The sanitized preemptive store of zero prior to the actual "slow" store is
    done through a simple ST instruction based on r10 (frame pointer) with
    relative offset to the stack location that the verifier has been tracking
    on the original used register for STX, which does not have to be r10. Thus,
    there are no memory dependencies for this store, since it's only using r10
    and immediate constant of zero; hence af86ca4e3088 /assumed/ a low latency
    operation.
    
    However, a recent attack demonstrated that this mitigation is not sufficient
    since the preemptive store of zero could also be turned into a "slow" store
    and is thus bypassed as well:
    
      [...]

      550: (85) call bpf_ringbuf_output#194288

      551: (7a) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = 0            | /both/ are now slow stores here
      // storing map value pointer r7 at fp-16   | since value of r10 is "slow".
      552: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r7           /
      // following "fast" read to the same memory location, but due to dependency

      // in speculative domain contains attacker controlled r2. in non-speculative
      // domain this contains r7, and thus accesses r7 +0 below.
      554: (71) r3 = *(u8 *)(r2 +0)
      // leak r3
    
    As can be seen, the current speculative store bypass mitigation which the
    verifier inserts at line 551 is insufficient since /both/, the write of
    the zero sanitation as well as the map value pointer are a high latency
    instruction due to prior memory access via push/pop of r10 (rbp) in contrast
    to the low latency read in line 553 as r9 (r15) which stays in hardware
    registers. Thus, architecturally, fp-16 is r7, however, microarchitecturally,
    fp-16 can still be r2.
    
    Initial thoughts to address this issue was to track spilled pointer loads
    from stack and enforce their load via LDX through r10 as well so that /both/
    the preemptive store of zero /as well as/ the load use the /same/ register
    such that a dependency is created between the store and load. However, this
    option is not sufficient either since it can be bypassed as well under
    speculation. An updated attack with pointer spill/fills now _all_ based on
    r10 would look as follows:
    
      [...]
      // r2 = oob address (e.g. scalar)
      // r7 = pointer to map value
      [...]
      // longer store forward prediction training sequence than before.

      2102: (71) r3 = *(u8 *)(r2 +0)
      // leak r3
      [...]
    
    Looking at the CPU microarchitecture, the scheduler might issue loads (such
    as seen in line 2101) before stores (line 2099,2100) because the load execution
    units become available while the store execution unit is still busy with the
    sequence of dummy stores (line 2069-2098). And so the load may use the prior
    stored scalar from r2 at address r10 -16 for speculation. The updated attack
    may work less reliable on CPU microarchitectures where loads and stores share
    execution resources.
    
    This concludes that the sanitizing with zero stores from af86ca4e3088 ("bpf:
    Prevent memory disambiguation attack") is insufficient. Moreover, the detection
    of stack reuse from af86ca4e3088 where previously data (STACK_MISC) has been
    written to a given stack slot where a pointer value is now to be stored does
    not have sufficient coverage as precondition for the mitigation either; for
    several reasons outlined as follows:
    
     1) Stack content from prior program runs could still be preserved and is
        therefore not "random", best example is to split a speculative store
        bypass attack between tail calls, program A would prepare and store the
        oob address at a given stack slot and then tail call into program B which
        does the "slow" store of a pointer to the stack with subsequent "fast"
        read. From program B PoV such stack slot type is STACK_INVALID, and
        therefore also must be subject to mitigation.
    
     2) The STACK_SPILL must not be coupled to register_is_const(&stack->spilled_ptr)
        condition, for example, the previous content of that memory location could
        also be a pointer to map or map value. Without the fix, a speculative
        store bypass is not mitigated in such precondition and can then lead to
        a type confusion in the speculative domain leaking kernel memory near
        these pointer types.
    
    While brainstorming on various alternative mitigation possibilities, we also
    stumbled upon a retrospective from Chrome developers [0]:
    
      [...] For variant 4, we implemented a mitigation to zero the unused memory
      of the heap prior to allocation, which cost about 1% when done concurrently
      and 4% for scavenging. Variant 4 defeats everything we could think of. We
      explored more mitigations for variant 4 but the threat proved to be more
      pervasive and dangerous than we anticipated. For example, stack slots used
      by the register allocator in the optimizing compiler could be subject to
      type confusion, leading to pointer crafting. Mitigating type confusion for
      stack slots alone would have required a complete redesign of the backend of
      the optimizing compiler, perhaps man years of work, without a guarantee of
      completeness. [...]
    
    From BPF side, the problem space is reduced, however, options are rather
    limited. One idea that has been explored was to xor-obfuscate pointer spills
    to the BPF stack:
    
      [...]
      // preoccupy the CPU store port by running sequence of dummy stores.
      [...]
      2106: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29796) = r0
      2107: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29800) = r0
      2108: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29804) = r0
      2109: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29808) = r0
      2110: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +29812) = r0
      // overwrite scalar with dummy pointer; xored with random 'secret' value
      // of 943576462 before store ...
      2111: (b4) w11 = 943576462
      2112: (af) r11 ^= r7
      2113: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -16) = r11
      2114: (79) r11 = *(u64 *)(r10 -16)
      2115: (b4) w2 = 943576462
      2116: (af) r2 ^= r11
      // ... and restored with the same 'secret' value with the help of AX reg.
      2117: (71) r3 = *(u8 *)(r2 +0)
      [...]
    
    While the above would not prevent speculation, it would make data leakage
    infeasible by directing it to random locations. In order to be effective
    and prevent type confusion under speculation, such random secret would have
    to be regenerated for each store. The additional complexity involved for a
    tracking mechanism that prevents jumps such that restoring spilled pointers
    would not get corrupted is not worth the gain for unprivileged. Hence, the
    fix in here eventually opted for emitting a non-public BPF_ST | BPF_NOSPEC
    instruction which the x86 JIT translates into a lfence opcode. Inserting the
    latter in between the store and load instruction is one of the mitigations
    options [1]. The x86 instruction manual notes:
    
      [...] An LFENCE that follows an instruction that stores to memory might
      complete before the data being stored have become globally visible. [...]
    
    The latter meaning that the preceding store instruction finished execution
    and the store is at minimum guaranteed to be in the CPU's store queue, but
    it's not guaranteed to be in that CPU's L1 cache at that point (globally
    visible). The latter would only be guaranteed via sfence. So the load which
    is guaranteed to execute after the lfence for that local CPU would have to
    rely on store-to-load forwarding. [2], in section 2.3 on store buffers says:
    
      [...] For every store operation that is added to the ROB, an entry is
      allocated in the store buffer. This entry requires both the virtual and
      physical address of the target. Only if there is no free entry in the store
      buffer, the frontend stalls until there is an empty slot available in the
      store buffer again. Otherwise, the CPU can immediately continue adding
      subsequent instructions to the ROB and execute them out of order. On Intel
      CPUs, the store buffer has up to 56 entries. [...]
    
    One small upside on the fix is that it lifts constraints from af86ca4e3088
    where the sanitize_stack_off relative to r10 must be the same when coming
    from different paths. The BPF_ST | BPF_NOSPEC gets emitted after a BPF_STX
    or BPF_ST instruction. This happens either when we store a pointer or data
    value to the BPF stack for the first time, or upon later pointer spills.
    The former needs to be enforced since otherwise stale stack data could be
    leaked under speculation as outlined earlier. For non-x86 JITs the BPF_ST |
    BPF_NOSPEC mapping is currently optimized away, but others could emit a
    speculation barrier as well if necessary. For real-world unprivileged
    programs e.g. generated by LLVM, pointer spill/fill is only generated upon
    register pressure and LLVM only tries to do that for pointers which are not
    used often. The program main impact will be the initial BPF_ST | BPF_NOSPEC
    sanitation for the STACK_INVALID case when the first write to a stack slot
    occurs e.g. upon map lookup. In future we might refine ways to mitigate
    the latter cost.

    bpf: Introduce BPF nospec instruction for mitigating Spectre v4
    
    [ Upstream commit f5e81d1117501546b7be050c5fbafa6efd2c722c ]
    
    In case of JITs, each of the JIT backends compiles the BPF nospec instruction
    /either/ to a machine instruction which emits a speculation barrier /or/ to
    /no/ machine instruction in case the underlying architecture is not affected
    by Speculative Store Bypass or has different mitigations in place already.
    
    This covers both x86 and (implicitly) arm64: In case of x86, we use 'lfence'
    instruction for mitigation. In case of arm64, we rely on the firmware mitigation
    as controlled via the ssbd kernel parameter. Whenever the mitigation is enabled,
    it works for all of the kernel code with no need to provide any additional
    instructions here (hence only comment in arm64 JIT). Other archs can follow
    as needed. The BPF nospec instruction is specifically targeting Spectre v4
    since i) we don't use a serialization barrier for the Spectre v1 case, and
    ii) mitigation instructions for v1 and v4 might be different on some archs.
    
    The BPF nospec is required for a future commit, where the BPF verifier does
    annotate intermediate BPF programs with speculation barriers.

    The result of __dev_get_by_index() is not checked for NULL and then gets
    dereferenced immediately.
    
    Also, __dev_get_by_index() must be called while holding either RTNL lock

    check for possible PTR_ERR() result.

    Fix a bug when flow table is created in priority that already
    has other flow tables as shown in the below diagram.
    If the new flow table (FT-B) has the lowest level in the priority,
    we need to connect the flow tables from the previous priority (p0)
    to this new table. In addition when this flow table is destroyed
    (FT-B), we need to connect the flow tables from the previous
    priority (p0) to the next level flow table (FT-C) in the same
    priority of the destroyed table (if exists).

    net: llc: fix skb_over_panic
    
    [ Upstream commit c7c9d2102c9c098916ab9e0ab248006107d00d6c ]
    
    Syzbot reported skb_over_panic() in llc_pdu_init_as_xid_cmd(). The
    problem was in wrong LCC header manipulations.
    
    Syzbot's reproducer tries to send XID packet. llc_ui_sendmsg() is
    doing following steps:
    
            1. skb allocation with size = len + header size
                    len is passed from userpace and header size
                    is 3 since addr->sllc_xid is set.
    
            2. skb_reserve() for header_len = 3
            3. filling all other space with memcpy_from_msg()
    
    Ok, at this moment we have fully loaded skb, only headers needs to be
    filled.
    
    Then code comes to llc_sap_action_send_xid_c(). This function pushes 3
    bytes for LLC PDU header and initializes it. Then comes
    llc_pdu_init_as_xid_cmd(). It initalizes next 3 bytes *AFTER* LLC PDU
    header and call skb_push(skb, 3). This looks wrong for 2 reasons:
    
            1. Bytes rigth after LLC header are user data, so this function
               was overwriting payload.
    
            2. skb_push(skb, 3) call can cause skb_over_panic() since
               all free space was filled in llc_ui_sendmsg(). (This can
               happen is user passed 686 len: 686 + 14 (eth header) + 3 (LLC
               header) = 703. SKB_DATA_ALIGN(703) = 704)
    
    So, in this patch I added 2 new private constansts: LLC_PDU_TYPE_U_XID
    and LLC_PDU_LEN_U_XID. LLC_PDU_LEN_U_XID is used to correctly reserve
    header size to handle LLC + XID case. LLC_PDU_TYPE_U_XID is used by
    llc_pdu_header_init() function to push 6 bytes instead of 3. And finally
    I removed skb_push() call from llc_pdu_init_as_xid_cmd().
    
    This changes should not affect other parts of LLC, since after
    all steps we just transmit buffer.

    [ Upstream commit 69f0aeb13bb548e2d5710a350116e03f0273302e ]
    
    In the existing code while changing the number of TX/RX
    queues using ethtool the PF/VF interface resources are
    freed and reallocated (otx2_stop and otx2_open is called)
    if the device is in running state. If any resource allocation
    fails in otx2_open, driver free already allocated resources
    and return. But again, when the number of queues changes
    as the device state still running oxt2_stop is called.
    In which we try to free already freed resources leading
    to driver crash.
    This patch fixes the issue by setting the INTF_DOWN flag on
    error and free the resources in otx2_stop only if the flag is
    not set.

    tipc: do not write skb_shinfo frags when doing decrytion
    
    [ Upstream commit 3cf4375a090473d240281a0d2b04a3a5aaeac34b ]
    
    One skb's skb_shinfo frags are not writable, and they can be shared with
    other skbs' like by pskb_copy(). To write the frags may cause other skb's
    data crash.
    
    So before doing en/decryption, skb_cow_data() should always be called for
    a cloned or nonlinear skb if req dst is using the same sg as req src.
    While at it, the likely branch can be removed, as it will be covered
    by skb_cow_data().
    
    Note that esp_input() has the same issue, and I will fix it in another
    patch. tipc_aead_encrypt() doesn't have this issue, as it only processes
    linear data in the unlikely branch.

    net: qrtr: fix memory leaks
    
    [ Upstream commit 52f3456a96c06760b9bfae460e39596fec7af22e ]
    
    Syzbot reported memory leak in qrtr. The problem was in unputted
    struct sock. qrtr_local_enqueue() function calls qrtr_port_lookup()
    which takes sock reference if port was found. Then there is the following
    check:
    
    if (!ipc || &ipc->sk == skb->sk) {
            ...
            return -ENODEV;
    }
    
    Since we should drop the reference before returning from this function and
    ipc can be non-NULL inside this if, we should add qrtr_port_put() inside
    this if.
    
    The similar corner case is in qrtr_endpoint_post() as Manivannan
    reported. In case of sock_queue_rcv_skb() failure we need to put
    port reference to avoid leaking struct sock pointer.

    net: Set true network header for ECN decapsulation
    
    [ Upstream commit 227adfb2b1dfbc53dfc53b9dd7a93a6298ff7c56 ]
    
    In cases where the header straight after the tunnel header was
    another ethernet header (TEB), instead of the network header,
    the ECN decapsulation code would treat the ethernet header as if
    it was an IP header, resulting in mishandling and possible
    wrong drops or corruption of the IP header.
    
    In this case, ECT(1) is sent, so IP_ECN_decapsulate tries to copy it to the
    inner IPv4 header, and correct its checksum.
    
    The offset of the ECT bits in an IPv4 header corresponds to the
    lower 2 bits of the second octet of the destination MAC address
    in the ethernet header.
    The IPv4 checksum corresponds to end of the source address.
    
    In order to reproduce:
    
        $ ip netns add A
        $ ip netns add B
        $ ip -n A link add _v0 type veth peer name _v1 netns B

        $ ip -n A route add default dev _v0 scope global
        $ ip -n B link set _v1 up
        $ ip -n B addr add dev _v1 10.254.1.6/24

    tipc: fix implicit-connect for SYN+
    
    [ Upstream commit f8dd60de194817c86bf812700980762bb5a8d9a4 ]
    
    For implicit-connect, when it's either SYN- or SYN+, an ACK should
    be sent back to the client immediately. It's not appropriate for
    the client to enter established state only after receiving data
    from the server.
    
    On client side, after the SYN is sent out, tipc_wait_for_connect()
    should be called to wait for the ACK if timeout is set.
    
    This patch also restricts __tipc_sendstream() to call __sendmsg()
    only when it's in TIPC_OPEN state, so that the client can program
    in a single loop doing both connecting and data sending like:
    
      for (...)
          sendmsg(dest, buf);
    
    This makes the implicit-connect more implicit.

    constructed correctly and put into tx_ring, but UP is later remapped by
    HW on the basis of TCTUPR register contents according to Tx queue
    selected, and BW used is consistent with the new UP values. This is
    caused by Tx queue selection in kernel not taking into account DCB
    configuration. This patch fixes the issue by implementing the

    i40e: Fix firmware LLDP agent related warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 71d6fdba4b2d82fdd883fec31dee77fbcf59773a ]
    
    Make warning meaningful for the user.
    
    Previously the trace:
    "Starting FW LLDP agent failed: error: I40E_ERR_ADMIN_QUEUE_ERROR, I40E_AQ_RC_EAGAIN"
    was produced when user tried to start Firmware LLDP agent,
    just after it was stopped with sequence:
    ethtool --set-priv-flags <dev> disable-fw-lldp on
    ethtool --set-priv-flags <dev> disable-fw-lldp off
    (without any delay between the commands)
    At that point the firmware is still processing stop command, the behavior
    is expected.

    i40e: Fix logic of disabling queues
    
    [ Upstream commit 65662a8dcdd01342b71ee44234bcfd0162e195af ]
    
    Correct the message flow between driver and firmware when disabling
    queues.
    
    Previously in case of PF reset (due to required reinit after reconfig),
    the error like: "VSI seid 397 Tx ring 60 disable timeout" could show up
    occasionally. The error was not a real issue of hardware or firmware,
    it was caused by wrong sequence of messages invoked by the driver.

    Statistical counters are not incrementing in some adapter versions with

    the stats context.

    When we exceed the limit of BSS entries, this function will free the
    new entry, however, at this time, it is the last door to access the
    inputed ies, so these ies will be unreferenced objects and cause memory
    leak.
    Therefore we should free its ies before deallocating the new entry, beside
    of dropping it from hidden_list.

    nfc: nfcsim: fix use after free during module unload
    
    commit 5e7b30d24a5b8cb691c173b45b50e3ca0191be19 upstream.
    
    There is a use after free memory corruption during module exit:
     - nfcsim_exit()
      - nfcsim_device_free(dev0)
        - nfc_digital_unregister_device()
          This iterates over command queue and frees all commands,
        - dev->up = false
        - nfcsim_link_shutdown()
          - nfcsim_link_recv_wake()
            This wakes the sleeping thread nfcsim_link_recv_skb().
    
     - nfcsim_link_recv_skb()
       Wake from wait_event_interruptible_timeout(),
       call directly the deb->cb callback even though (dev->up == false),
       - digital_send_cmd_complete()
         Dereference of "struct digital_cmd" cmd which was freed earlier by
         nfc_digital_unregister_device().
    
    This causes memory corruption shortly after (with unrelated stack
    trace):

    This flow of calling digital_send_cmd_complete() callback on driver exit
    is specific to nfcsim which implements reading and sending work queues.
    Since the NFC digital device was unregistered, the callback should not
    be called.

    blk-iocost: fix operation ordering in iocg_wake_fn()
    
    commit 5ab189cf3abbc9994bae3be524c5b88589ed56e2 upstream.
    
    iocg_wake_fn() open-codes wait_queue_entry removal and wakeup because it
    wants the wq_entry to be always removed whether it ended up waking the
    task or not. finish_wait() tests whether wq_entry needs removal without
    grabbing the wait_queue lock and expects the waker to use
    list_del_init_careful() after all waking operations are complete, which
    iocg_wake_fn() didn't do. The operation order was wrong and the regular
    list_del_init() was used.
    
    The result is that if a waiter wakes up racing the waker, it can free pop
    the wq_entry off stack before the waker is still looking at it, which can
    lead to a backtrace like the following.

    drm/amdgpu: Fix resource leak on probe error path
    
    commit d47255d3f87338164762ac56df1f28d751e27246 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 4192f7b5768912ceda82be2f83c87ea7181f9980.
    
    It is not true (as stated in the reverted commit changelog) that we never
    unmap the BAR on failure; it actually does happen properly on
    amdgpu_driver_load_kms() -> amdgpu_driver_unload_kms() ->
    amdgpu_device_fini() error path.
    
    What's worse, this commit actually completely breaks resource freeing on
    probe failure (like e.g. failure to load microcode), as
    amdgpu_driver_unload_kms() notices adev->rmmio being NULL and bails too
    early, leaving all the resources that'd normally be freed in
    amdgpu_acpi_fini() and amdgpu_device_fini() still hanging around, leading
    to all sorts of oopses when someone tries to, for example, access the
    sysfs and procfs resources which are still around while the driver is
    gone.

    drm/amdgpu: Avoid printing of stack contents on firmware load error
    
    commit 6aade587d329ebe88319dfdb8e8c7b6aede80417 upstream.
    
    In case when psp_init_asd_microcode() fails to load ASD microcode file,
    psp_v12_0_init_microcode() tries to print the firmware filename that
    failed to load before bailing out.
    
    This is wrong because:
    
    - the firmware filename it would want it print is an incorrect one as
      psp_init_asd_microcode() and psp_v12_0_init_microcode() are loading
      different filenames
    - it tries to print fw_name, but that's not yet been initialized by that
      time, so it prints random stack contents, e.g.
    
        amdgpu 0000:04:00.0: Direct firmware load for amdgpu/renoir_asd.bin failed with error -2

    drm/amd/display: ensure dentist display clock update finished in DCN20
    
    commit b53e041d8e4308f7324999398aec092dbcb130f5 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    We don't check DENTIST_DISPCLK_CHG_DONE to ensure dentist
    display clockis updated to target value. In some scenarios with large
    display clock margin, it will deliver unfinished display clock and cause
    issues like display black screen.
    
    [How]
    Checking DENTIST_DISPCLK_CHG_DONE to ensure display clock
    has been update to target value before driver do other clock related
    actions.

    NIU: fix incorrect error return, missed in previous revert
    
    commit 15bbf8bb4d4ab87108ecf5f4155ec8ffa3c141d6 upstream.
    
    Commit 7930742d6, reverting 26fd962, missed out on reverting an incorrect
    change to a return value.  The niu_pci_vpd_scan_props(..) == 1 case appears
    to be a normal path - treating it as an error and return -EINVAL was
    breaking VPD_SCAN and causing the driver to fail to load.
    
    Fix, so my Neptune card works again.

    HID: wacom: Re-enable touch by default for Cintiq 24HDT / 27QHDT
    
    commit 6ca2350e11f09d5d3e53777d1eff8ff6d300ed93 upstream.
    
    Commit 670e90924bfe ("HID: wacom: support named keys on older devices")
    added support for sending named events from the soft buttons on the
    24HDT and 27QHDT. In the process, however, it inadvertantly disabled the
    touchscreen of the 24HDT and 27QHDT by default. The
    `wacom_set_shared_values` function would normally enable touch by default
    but because it checks the state of the non-shared `has_mute_touch_switch`
    flag and `wacom_setup_touch_input_capabilities` sets the state of the
    /shared/ version, touch ends up being disabled by default.
    
    This patch sets the non-shared flag, letting `wacom_set_shared_values`
    take care of copying the value over to the shared version and setting
    the default touch state to "on".

    alpha: register early reserved memory in memblock
    
    commit 640b7ea5f888b521dcf28e2564ce75d08a783fd7 upstream.
    
    The memory reserved by console/PALcode or non-volatile memory is not added
    to memblock.memory.
    
    Since commit fa3354e4ea39 (mm: free_area_init: use maximal zone PFNs rather
    than zone sizes) the initialization of the memory map relies on the
    accuracy of memblock.memory to properly calculate zone sizes. The holes in
    memblock.memory caused by absent regions reserved by the firmware cause
    incorrect initialization of struct pages which leads to BUG() during the
    initial page freeing:

    can: esd_usb2: fix memory leak
    
    commit 928150fad41ba16df7fcc9f7f945747d0f56cbb6 upstream.
    
    In esd_usb2_setup_rx_urbs() MAX_RX_URBS coherent buffers are allocated
    and there is nothing, that frees them:
    
    1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all
    2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER
       is not set (see esd_usb2_setup_rx_urbs) and this flag cannot be used
       with coherent buffers.
    
    So, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent()
    explicitly.
    
    Side note: This code looks like a copy-paste of other can drivers. The
    same patch was applied to mcba_usb driver and it works nice with real
    hardware. There is no change in functionality, only clean-up code for
    coherent buffers.

    can: mcba_usb_start(): add missing urb->transfer_dma initialization
    
    commit fc43fb69a7af92839551f99c1a96a37b77b3ae7a upstream.
    
    Yasushi reported, that his Microchip CAN Analyzer stopped working
    since commit 91c02557174b ("can: mcba_usb: fix memory leak in
    mcba_usb"). The problem was in missing urb->transfer_dma
    initialization.
    
    In my previous patch to this driver I refactored mcba_usb_start() code
    to avoid leaking usb coherent buffers. To archive it, I passed local
    stack variable to usb_alloc_coherent() and then saved it to private
    array to correctly free all coherent buffers on ->close() call. But I
    forgot to initialize urb->transfer_dma with variable passed to
    usb_alloc_coherent().
    
    All of this was causing device to not work, since dma addr 0 is not
    valid and following log can be found on bug report page, which points
    exactly to problem described above.

    BUG
    
    After unlist_netdevice(), dev_get_by_index() return NULL in
    raw_setsockopt(). Function raw_enable_filters() will add sock
    and can_filter to net->can.rx_alldev_list. Then the sock is closed.
    Followed by, we sock_sendmsg() to a new vcan device use the same
    can_filter. Protocol stack match the old receiver whose sock has
    been released on net->can.rx_alldev_list in can_rcv_filter().
    Function raw_rcv() uses the freed sock. UAF BUG is triggered.
    
    We can find that the key issue is that net_device has not been
    protected in raw_setsockopt(). Use rtnl_lock to protect net_device
    in raw_setsockopt().

    ocfs2: issue zeroout to EOF blocks
    
    commit 9449ad33be8480f538b11a593e2dda2fb33ca06d upstream.
    
    For punch holes in EOF blocks, fallocate used buffer write to zero the
    EOF blocks in last cluster.  But since ->writepage will ignore EOF
    pages, those zeros will not be flushed.
    
    This "looks" ok as commit 6bba4471f0cc ("ocfs2: fix data corruption by
    fallocate") will zero the EOF blocks when extend the file size, but it
    isn't.  The problem happened on those EOF pages, before writeback, those
    pages had DIRTY flag set and all buffer_head in them also had DIRTY flag
    set, when writeback run by write_cache_pages(), DIRTY flag on the page
    was cleared, but DIRTY flag on the buffer_head not.
    
    When next write happened to those EOF pages, since buffer_head already
    had DIRTY flag set, it would not mark page DIRTY again.  That made
    writeback ignore them forever.  That will cause data corruption.  Even
    directio write can't work because it will fail when trying to drop pages
    caches before direct io, as it found the buffer_head for those pages
    still had DIRTY flag set, then it will fall back to buffer io mode.
    
    To make a summary of the issue, as writeback ingores EOF pages, once any
    EOF page is generated, any write to it will only go to the page cache,
    it will never be flushed to disk even file size extends and that page is
    not EOF page any more.  The fix is to avoid zero EOF blocks with buffer
    write.
    
    The following code snippet from qemu-img could trigger the corruption.
    
      656   open("6b3711ae-3306-4bdd-823c-cf1c0060a095.conv.2", O_RDWR|O_DIRECT|O_CLOEXEC) = 11

    ocfs2: fix zero out valid data
    
    commit f267aeb6dea5e468793e5b8eb6a9c72c0020d418 upstream.
    
    If append-dio feature is enabled, direct-io write and fallocate could
    run in parallel to extend file size, fallocate used "orig_isize" to
    record i_size before taking "ip_alloc_sem", when
    ocfs2_zeroout_partial_cluster() zeroout EOF blocks, i_size maybe already
    extended by ocfs2_dio_end_io_write(), that will cause valid data zeroed
    out.

    KVM: add missing compat KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG
    
    commit 8750f9bbda115f3f79bfe43be85551ee5e12b6ff upstream.
    
    The arguments to the KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG ioctl include a pointer,
    therefore it needs a compat ioctl implementation.  Otherwise,
    32-bit userspace fails to invoke it on 64-bit kernels; for x86
    it might work fine by chance if the padding is zero, but not
    on big-endian architectures.

    x86/kvm: fix vcpu-id indexed array sizes
    
    commit 76b4f357d0e7d8f6f0013c733e6cba1773c266d3 upstream.
    
    KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID is the maximum vcpu-id of a guest, and not the number
    of vcpu-ids. Fix array indexed by vcpu-id to have KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID+1
    elements.
    
    Note that this is currently no real problem, as KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID is
    an odd number, resulting in always enough padding being available at
    the end of those arrays.
    
    Nevertheless this should be fixed in order to avoid rare problems in
    case someone is using an even number for KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID.

    ACPI: DPTF: Fix reading of attributes
    
    commit 41a8457f3f6f829be1f8f8fa7577a46b9b7223ef upstream.
    
    The current assumption that methods to read PCH FIVR attributes will
    return integer, is not correct. There is no good way to return integer
    as negative numbers are also valid.
    
    These read methods return a package of integers. The first integer returns
    status, which is 0 on success and any other value for failure. When the
    returned status is zero, then the second integer returns the actual value.
    
    This change fixes this issue by replacing acpi_evaluate_integer() with
    acpi_evaluate_object() and use acpi_extract_package() to extract results.

    In compression write endio sequence, the range which the compressed_bio
    writes is marked as uptodate if the last bio of the compressed (sub)bios
    is completed successfully. There could be previous bio which may
    have failed which is recorded in cb->errors.
    
    Set the writeback range as uptodate only if cb->errors is zero, as opposed
    to checking only the last bio's status.
    
    Backporting notes: in all versions up to 4.4 the last argument is always
    replaced by "!cb->errors".

    As a note, prior to commit cf89af146b7e ("btrfs: dev-replace: fail
    mount if we don't have replace item with target device"), rw_devices
    was decremented on removing a writable device in
    __btrfs_free_extra_devids only if the BTRFS_DEV_STATE_REPLACE_TGT bit
    was not set for the device. However, this check does not need to be
    reinstated as it is now redundant and incorrect.
    
    In __btrfs_free_extra_devids, we skip removing the device if it is the
    target for replacement. This is done by checking whether device->devid
    == BTRFS_DEV_REPLACE_DEVID. Since BTRFS_DEV_STATE_REPLACE_TGT is set
    only on the device with devid BTRFS_DEV_REPLACE_DEVID, no devices
    should have the BTRFS_DEV_STATE_REPLACE_TGT bit set after the check,
    and so it's redundant to test for that bit.
    
    Additionally, following commit 82372bc816d7 ("Btrfs: make
    the logic of source device removing more clear"), rw_devices is
    incremented whenever a writeable device is added to the alloc
    list (including the target device in btrfs_dev_replace_finishing), so
    all removals of writable devices from the alloc list should also be
    accompanied by a decrement to rw_devices.

    pipe: make pipe writes always wake up readers
    
    commit 3a34b13a88caeb2800ab44a4918f230041b37dd9 upstream.
    
    Since commit 1b6b26ae7053 ("pipe: fix and clarify pipe write wakeup
    logic") we have sanitized the pipe write logic, and would only try to
    wake up readers if they needed it.
    
    In particular, if the pipe already had data in it before the write,
    there was no point in trying to wake up a reader, since any existing
    readers must have been aware of the pre-existing data already.  Doing
    extraneous wakeups will only cause potential thundering herd problems.
    
    However, it turns out that some Android libraries have misused the EPOLL
    interface, and expected "edge triggered" be to "any new write will
    trigger it".  Even if there was no edge in sight.
    
    Quoting Sandeep Patil:
     "The commit 1b6b26ae7053 ('pipe: fix and clarify pipe write wakeup
      logic') changed pipe write logic to wakeup readers only if the pipe
      was empty at the time of write. However, there are libraries that
      relied upon the older behavior for notification scheme similar to
      what's described in [1]
    
      One such library 'realm-core'[2] is used by numerous Android
      applications. The library uses a similar notification mechanism as GNU
      Make but it never drains the pipe until it is full. When Android moved
      to v5.10 kernel, all applications using this library stopped working.
    
      The library has since been fixed[3] but it will be a while before all
      applications incorporate the updated library"
    
    Our regression rule for the kernel is that if applications break from
    new behavior, it's a regression, even if it was because the application
    did something patently wrong.  Also note the original report [4] by
    Michal Kerrisk about a test for this epoll behavior - but at that point
    we didn't know of any actual broken use case.
    
    So add the extraneous wakeup, to approximate the old behavior.
    
    [ I say "approximate", because the exact old behavior was to do a wakeup
      not for each write(), but for each pipe buffer chunk that was filled
      in. The behavior introduced by this change is not that - this is just
      "every write will cause a wakeup, whether necessary or not", which
      seems to be sufficient for the broken library use. ]
    
    It's worth noting that this adds the extraneous wakeup only for the
    write side, while the read side still considers the "edge" to be purely
    about reading enough from the pipe to allow further writes.
    
    See commit f467a6a66419 ("pipe: fix and clarify pipe read wakeup logic")
    for the pipe read case, which remains that "only wake up if the pipe was
    full, and we read something from it".

    If io_allocate_scq_urings() fails in io_uring_create(), 'ctx->sq_data'
    is not set yet, when calling io_sq_offload_start() in io_disable_sqo_submit()
    in error path, it will lead a null-ptr-deref.
    
    The io_disable_sqo_submit() has been removed in mainline by commit
    70aacfe66136 ("io_uring: kill sqo_dead and sqo submission halting"),
    so the bug has been eliminated in mainline, it's a fix only for stable-5.10.
