    s390/mm: make pmdp_invalidate() do invalidation only
    
    commit 91c575b335766effa6103eba42a82aea560c365f upstream.
    
    Commit 227be799c39a ("s390/mm: uninline pmdp_xxx functions from pgtable.h")
    inadvertently changed the behavior of pmdp_invalidate(), so that it now
    clears the pmd instead of just marking it as invalid. Fix this by restoring
    the original behavior.
    
    A possible impact of the misbehaving pmdp_invalidate() would be the
    MADV_DONTNEED races (see commits ced10803 and 58ceeb6b), although we
    should not have any negative impact on the related dirty/young flags,
    since those flags are not set by the hardware on s390.

    ttpci: address stringop overflow warning
    
    commit 69d3973af1acd4c0989ec8218c05f12d303cd7cf upstream.
    
    gcc-7.0.1 warns about old code in ttpci:

    In function 'irdebi.isra.2',

       memcpy(av7110->debi_virt, (char *) &res, count);
    
    Apparently, 'count' can be negative here, which will then get turned
    into a giant size argument for memcpy. Changing the sizes to 'unsigned
    int' instead seems safe as we already check for maximum sizes, and it
    also simplifies the code a bit.

    ALSA: au88x0: avoid theoretical uninitialized access
    
    commit 13f99ebdd602ebdafb909e15ec6ffb1e34690167 upstream.
    
    The latest gcc-7.0.1 snapshot points out that we if nr_ch is zero, we never
    initialize some variables:
    
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c: In function 'vortex_adb_allocroute':
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2304:68: error: 'mix[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2305:58: error: 'src[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    
    I assume this can never happen in practice, but adding a check here doesn't
    hurt either and avoids the warning. The code has been unchanged since
    the start of git history.

    tools/power turbostat: bugfix: GFXMHz column not changing
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 22048c5485503749754b3b5daf9d99ef89fcacdc ]
    
    turbostat displays a GFXMHz column, which comes from reading
    /sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/drm/card0/gt_cur_freq_mhz
    
    But GFXMHz was not changing, even when a manual
    cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/drm/card0/gt_cur_freq_mhz
    showed a new value.
    
    It turns out that a rewind() on the open file is not sufficient,
    fflush() (or a close/open) is needed to read fresh values.

    [ Upstream commit d85fc67dd11e9a32966140677d4d6429ca540b25 ]
    
    Without this patch, failed probe would not free resources like irq.
    
    ata port tdev object currently hold a reference to the ata port
    object.  Therefore the ata port object release function will not get
    called until the ata_tport_release is called. But that would never
    happen, releasing the last reference of ata port dev is done by
    scsi_host_release, which is called by ata_host_release when the ata
    port object is released.
    
    The ata device objects actually do not need to explicitly hold a
    reference to their real counterpart, given the transport objects are
    the children of these objects and device_add() is call for each child.
    We know the parent will not be deleted until we call the child's
    device_del().

    [ Upstream commit 08b005f1333154ae5b404ca28766e0ffb9f1c150 ]
    
    The sole remaining caller of kmem_zalloc_greedy is bulkstat, which uses
    it to grab 1-4 pages for staging of inobt records.  The infinite loop in
    the greedy allocation function is causing hangs[1] in generic/269, so
    just get rid of the greedy allocator in favor of kmem_zalloc_large.
    This makes bulkstat somewhat more likely to ENOMEM if there's really no
    pages to spare, but eliminates a source of hangs.

    netfilter: nf_tables: set pktinfo->thoff at AH header if found
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 568af6de058cb2b0c5b98d98ffcf37cdc6bc38a7 ]
    
    Phil Sutter reports that IPv6 AH header matching is broken. From
    userspace, nft generates bytecode that expects to find the AH header at
    NFT_PAYLOAD_TRANSPORT_HEADER both for IPv4 and IPv6. However,
    pktinfo->thoff is set to the inner header after the AH header in IPv6,
    while in IPv4 pktinfo->thoff points to the AH header indeed. This
    behaviour is inconsistent. This patch fixes this problem by updating
    ipv6_find_hdr() to get the IP6_FH_F_AUTH flag so this function stops at
    the AH header, so both IPv4 and IPv6 pktinfo->thoff point to the AH
    header.
    
    This is also inconsistent when trying to match encapsulated headers:
    
    1) A packet that looks like IPv4 + AH + TCP dport 22 will *not* match.
    2) A packet that looks like IPv6 + AH + TCP dport 22 will match.

    mm/cgroup: avoid panic when init with low memory
    
    
    [ Upstream commit bfc7228b9a9647e1c353e50b40297a2929801759 ]
    
    The system may panic when initialisation is done when almost all the
    memory is assigned to the huge pages using the kernel command line
    parameter hugepage=xxxx.  Panic may occur like this:
    
      Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0x00000000

    This is a chicken and egg issue where the kernel try to get free memory
    when allocating per node data in mem_cgroup_init(), but in that path
    mem_cgroup_soft_limit_reclaim() is called which assumes that these data
    are allocated.
    
    As mem_cgroup_soft_limit_reclaim() is best effort, it should return when
    these data are not yet allocated.
    
    This patch also fixes potential null pointer access in
    mem_cgroup_remove_from_trees() and mem_cgroup_update_tree().

    x86/acpi: Restore the order of CPU IDs
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b85b3d22920db7473e5fed5719e7955c0ec323e ]
    
    The following commits:
    
      f7c28833c2 ("x86/acpi: Enable acpi to register all possible cpus at
    boot time") and 8f54969dc8 ("x86/acpi: Introduce persistent storage
    for cpuid <-> apicid mapping")
    
    ... registered all the possible CPUs at boot time via ACPI tables to
    make the mapping of cpuid <-> apicid fixed. Both enabled and disabled
    CPUs could have a logical CPU ID after boot time.
    
    But, ACPI tables are unreliable. the number amd order of Local APIC
    entries which depends on the firmware is often inconsistent with the
    physical devices. Even if they are consistent, The disabled CPUs which
    take up some logical CPU IDs will also make the order discontinuous.
    
    Revert the part of disabled CPUs registration, keep the allocation
    logic of logical CPU IDs and also keep some code location changes.

    netfilter: nfnl_cthelper: fix incorrect helper->expect_class_max
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ae5c682113f9f94cc5e76f92cf041ee624c173ee ]
    
    The helper->expect_class_max must be set to the total number of
    expect_policy minus 1, since we will use the statement "if (class >
    helper->expect_class_max)" to validate the CTA_EXPECT_CLASS attr in
    ctnetlink_alloc_expect.
    
    So for compatibility, set the helper->expect_class_max to the
    NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM attr's value minus 1.
    
    Also: it's invalid when the NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM attr's value is zero.
    1. this will result "expect_policy = kzalloc(0, GFP_KERNEL);";
    2. we cannot set the helper->expect_class_max to a proper value.
    
    So if nla_get_be32(tb[NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM]) is zero, report -EINVAL to
    the userspace.

    MIPS: smp-cps: Fix retrieval of VPE mask on big endian CPUs
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fb2155e3c30dc2043b52020e26965067a3e7779c ]
    
    The vpe_mask member of struct core_boot_config is of type atomic_t,
    which is a 32bit type. In cps-vec.S this member was being retrieved by a
    PTR_L macro, which on 64bit systems is a 64bit load. On little endian
    systems this is OK, since the double word that is retrieved will have
    the required less significant word in the correct position. However, on
    big endian systems the less significant word of the load is retrieved
    from address+4, and the more significant from address+0. The destination
    register therefore ends up with the required word in the more
    significant word
    e.g. when starting the second VP of a big endian 64bit system, the load
    
    PTR_L    ta2, COREBOOTCFG_VPEMASK(a0)
    
    ends up setting register ta2 to 0x0000000300000000
    
    When this value is written to the CPC it is ignored, since it is
    invalid to write anything larger than 4 bits. This results in any VP
    other than VP0 in a core failing to start in 64bit big endian systems.
    
    Change the load to a 32bit load word instruction to fix the bug.

    MIPS: IRQ Stack: Unwind IRQ stack onto task stack
    
    
    [ Upstream commit db8466c581cca1a08b505f1319c3ecd246f16fa8 ]
    
    When the separate IRQ stack was introduced, stack unwinding only
    proceeded as far as the top of the IRQ stack, leading to kernel
    backtraces being less useful, lacking the trace of what was interrupted.
    
    Fix this by providing a means for the kernel to unwind the IRQ stack
    onto the interrupted task stack. The processor state is saved to the
    kernel task stack on interrupt. The IRQ_STACK_START macro reserves an
    unsigned long at the top of the IRQ stack where the interrupted task
    stack pointer can be saved. After the active stack is switched to the
    IRQ stack, save the interrupted tasks stack pointer to the reserved
    location.
    
    Fix the stack unwinding code to look for the frame being the top of the
    IRQ stack and if so get the next frame from the saved location. The
    existing test does not work with the separate stack since the ra is no
    longer pointed at ret_from_{irq,exception}.
    
    The test to stop unwinding the stack 32 bytes from the top of a stack
    must be modified to allow unwinding to continue up to the location of
    the saved task stack pointer when on the IRQ stack. The low / high marks
    of the stack are set depending on whether the sp is on an irq stack or
    not.

    Otherwise, another CPU may access the invalid pointer. For example:
        CPU0                CPU1
         -              rcu_read_lock();
         -              pfunc = _hook_;
      _hook_ = NULL;          -
      mod unload              -
         -                 pfunc(); // invalid, panic
         -             rcu_read_unlock();
    
    So we must call synchronize_rcu() to wait the rcu reader to finish.
    
    Also note, in nf_nat_snmp_basic_fini, synchronize_rcu() will be invoked
    by later nf_conntrack_helper_unregister, but I'm inclined to add a
    explicit synchronize_rcu after set the nf_nat_snmp_hook to NULL. Depend
    on such obscure assumptions is not a good idea.
    
    Last, in nfnetlink_cttimeout, we use kfree_rcu to free the time object,
    so in cttimeout_exit, invoking rcu_barrier() is not necessary at all,
    remove it too.

    drivers/rapidio/devices/tsi721.c: make module parameter variable name unique
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4785603bd05b0b029c647080937674d9991600f9 ]
    
    kbuild test robot reported a non-static variable name collision between
    a staging driver and a RapidIO driver, with a generic variable name of
    'dbg_level'.
    
    Both drivers should be changed so that they don't use this generic
    public variable name.  This patch fixes the RapidIO driver but does not
    change the user interface (name) for the module parameter.

      drivers/rapidio/built-in.o:(.bss+0x16c): first defined here

    hugetlbfs: initialize shared policy as part of inode allocation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 4742a35d9de745e867405b4311e1aac412f0ace1 ]
    
    Any time after inode allocation, destroy_inode can be called.  The
    hugetlbfs inode contains a shared_policy structure, and
    mpol_free_shared_policy is unconditionally called as part of
    hugetlbfs_destroy_inode.  Initialize the policy as part of inode
    allocation so that any quick (error path) calls to destroy_inode will be
    handed an initialized policy.

    Commit 57e5568fda27 ("sata_via: Implement hotplug for VT6421") adds
    hotplug IRQ handler for VT6421 but enables hotplug on all chips. This
    is a bug because it causes "irq xx: nobody cared" error on VT6420 when
    hot-(un)plugging a drive:

    Seems that VT6420 can do hotplug too (there's no documentation) but the
    comments say that SCR register access (required for detecting hotplug
    events) can cause problems on these chips.
    
    For now, just keep hotplug disabled on anything other than VT6421.

    Btrfs: fix potential use-after-free for cloned bio
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a967efb30b3afa3d858edd6a17f544f9e9e46eea ]
    
    KASAN reports that there is a use-after-free case of bio in btrfs_map_bio.
    
    If we need to submit IOs to several disks at a time, the original bio
    would get cloned and mapped to the destination disk, but we really should
    use the original bio instead of a cloned bio to do the sanity check
    because cloned bios are likely to be freed by its endio.

    Btrfs: fix segmentation fault when doing dio read
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 97bf5a5589aa3a59c60aa775fc12ec0483fc5002 ]
    
    Commit 2dabb3248453 ("Btrfs: Direct I/O read: Work on sectorsized blocks")
    introduced this bug during iterating bio pages in dio read's endio hook,
    and it could end up with segment fault of the dio reading task.
    
    So the reason is 'if (nr_sectors--)', and it makes the code assume that
    there is one more block in the same page, so page offset is increased and
    the bio which is created to repair the bad block then has an incorrect
    bvec.bv_offset, and a later access of the page content would throw a
    segmentation fault.
    
    This also adds ASSERT to check page offset against page size.

    The problem is that the bridge's VLAN group is created after setting the
    default PVID, when registering the netdevice and executing its
    ndo_init().
    
    Fix this by changing the order of both operations, so that
    br_changelink() is only processed after the netdevice is registered,
    when the VLAN group is already initialized.

    mmc: sdio: fix alignment issue in struct sdio_func
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ef1ecf060f28ecef313b5723f1fd39bf5a35f56 ]
    
    Certain 64-bit systems (e.g. Amlogic Meson GX) require buffers to be
    used for DMA to be 8-byte-aligned. struct sdio_func has an embedded
    small DMA buffer not meeting this requirement.
    When testing switching to descriptor chain mode in meson-gx driver
    SDIO is broken therefore. Fix this by allocating the small DMA buffer
    separately as kmalloc ensures that the returned memory area is
    properly aligned for every basic data type.

    net: dsa: b53: Include IMP/CPU port in dumb forwarding mode
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a424f0de61638cbb5047e0a888c54da9cf471f90 ]
    
    Since Broadcom tags are not enabled in b53 (DSA_PROTO_TAG_NONE), we need
    to make sure that the IMP/CPU port is included in the forwarding
    decision.
    
    Without this change, switching between non-management ports would work,

    udp: disable inner UDP checksum offloads in IPsec case
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b40c5f4fde22fb98eff205b3aece05b471c24eed ]
    
    Otherwise, UDP checksum offloads could corrupt ESP packets by attempting
    to calculate UDP checksum when this inner UDP packet is already protected
    by IPsec.
    
    One way to reproduce this bug is to have a VM with virtio_net driver (UFO
    set to ON in the guest VM); and then encapsulate all guest's Ethernet
    frames in Geneve; and then further encrypt Geneve with IPsec.  In this
    case following symptoms are observed:
    1. If using ixgbe NIC, then it will complain with following error message:
       ixgbe 0000:01:00.1: partial checksum but l4 proto=32!
    2. Receiving IPsec stack will drop all the corrupted ESP packets and
       increase XfrmInStateProtoError counter in /proc/net/xfrm_stat.
    3. iperf UDP test from the VM with packet sizes above MTU will not work at
       all.
    4. iperf TCP test from the VM will get ridiculously low performance because.

    In the general case, the resources are properly released by devm without
    needing to do anything. However, when unplugging the wireless receiver,
    the kernel segfaults from time to time while calling devres_release_all().
    
    I think in that case the resources attempt to access hid_get_drvdata(hdev)
    which has been set to null while leaving wacom_remove().

    ath10k: prevent sta pointer rcu violation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a744d927406389e00687560d9ce3c5ab0e58db9 ]
    
    Station pointers are RCU protected so driver must
    be extra careful if it tries to store them
    internally for later use outside of the RCU
    section it obtained it in.
    
    It was possible for station teardown to race with
    some htt events. The possible outcome could be a
    use-after-free and a crash.
    
    Only peer-flow-control capable firmware was
    affected (so hardware-wise qca99x0 and qca4019).
    
    This could be done in sta_state() itself via
    explicit synchronize_net() call but there's
    already a convenient sta_pre_rcu_remove() op that
    can be hooked up to avoid extra rcu stall.
    
    The peer->sta pointer itself can't be set to
    NULL/ERR_PTR because it is later used in
    sta_state() for extra sanity checks.

    ASoC: dapm: handle probe deferrals
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 37e1df8c95e2c8a57c77eafc097648f6e40a60ff ]
    
    This starts to handle probe deferrals on regulators and clocks
    on the ASoC DAPM.
    
    I came to this patch after audio stopped working on Ux500 ages
    ago and I finally looked into it to see what is wrong. I had
    messages like this in the console since a while back:
    
    ab8500-codec.0: ASoC: Failed to request audioclk: -517
    ab8500-codec.0: ASoC: Failed to create DAPM control audioclk
    ab8500-codec.0: Failed to create new controls -12
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -12
    snd-soc-mop500.0: Error: snd_soc_register_card failed (-12)!
    snd-soc-mop500: probe of snd-soc-mop500.0 failed with error -12
    
    Apparently because the widget table for the codec looks like
    this (sound/soc/codecs/ab8500-codec.c):
    
    static const struct snd_soc_dapm_widget ab8500_dapm_widgets[] = {
    
            /* Clocks */
            SND_SOC_DAPM_CLOCK_SUPPLY("audioclk"),
    
            /* Regulators */

    So when we call snd_soc_register_codec() and any of these widgets
    get a deferred probe we do not get an -EPROBE_DEFER (-517) back as
    we should and instead we just fail. Apparently the code assumes
    that clocks and regulators must be available at this point and
    not defer.
    
    After this patch it rather looks like this:
    
    ab8500-codec.0: Failed to create new controls -517
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -517
    snd-soc-mop500.0: Error: snd_soc_register_card failed (-517)!
    (...)
    abx500-clk.0: registered clocks for ab850x
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ab8500-codec-dai.0 <-> ux500-msp-i2s.1 mapping ok
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ab8500-codec-dai.1 <-> ux500-msp-i2s.3 mapping ok
    
    I'm pretty happy about the patch as it it, but I'm a bit
    uncertain on how to proceed: there are a lot of users of the
    external functions snd_soc_dapm_new_control() (111 sites)
    and that will now return an occassional error pointer, which
    is not handled in the calling sites.
    
    I want an indication from the maintainers whether I should just
    go in and augment all these call sites, or if deferred probe
    is frowned upon when it leads to this much overhead.

    partitions/efi: Fix integer overflow in GPT size calculation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c5082b70adfe8e1ea1cf4a8eff92c9f260e364d2 ]
    
    If a GUID Partition Table claims to have more than 2**25 entries, the
    calculation of the partition table size in alloc_read_gpt_entries() will
    overflow a 32-bit integer and not enough space will be allocated for the
    table.
    
    Nothing seems to get written out of bounds, but later efi_partition() will
    read up to 32768 bytes from a 128 byte buffer, possibly OOPSing or exposing
    information to /proc/partitions and uevents.
    
    The problem exists on both 64-bit and 32-bit platforms.
    
    Fix the overflow and also print a meaningful debug message if the table
    size is too large.

    [ Upstream commit 89a3987ab7a923c047c6dec008e60ad6f41fac22 ]
    
    The ipoib_vlan_add function calls rtnl_unlock after free_netdev,
    rtnl_unlock not only releases the lock, but also calls netdev_run_todo.
    The latter function browses the net_todo_list array and completes the
    unregistration of all its net_device instances. If we call free_netdev
    before rtnl_unlock, then netdev_run_todo call over the freed device causes
    panic.
    To fix, move rtnl_unlock call before free_netdev call.

    [ Upstream commit 1c3098cdb05207e740715857df7b0998e372f527 ]
    
    This patch fixes Deadlock while executing ipoib_vlan_delete.
    
    The function takes the vlan_rwsem semaphore and calls
    unregister_netdevice. The later function calls
    ipoib_mcast_stop_thread that cause workqueue flush.
    
    When the queue has one of the ipoib_ib_dev_flush_xxx events,
    a deadlock occur because these events also tries to catch the
    same vlan_rwsem semaphore.
    
    To fix, unregister_netdevice should be called after releasing
    the semaphore.

    serial: 8250_port: Remove dangerous pr_debug()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 699a11ba7ec869b006623182881f2f1f5b4aea53 ]
    
    With CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG if dyndbg enables debug output in
    8250_port.c deadlock happens inevitably on UART IRQ handling.
    
    That's the problematic execution path:
    ---------------------------->8------------------------
    UART IRQ:
      serial8250_interrupt() ->
        serial8250_handle_irq(): lock "port->lock" ->
          pr_debug() ->
            serial8250_console_write(): bump in locked "port->lock".
    
          OR (if above pr_debug() gets removed):
          serial8250_tx_chars() ->
            pr_debug() ->
              serial8250_console_write(): bump in locked "port->lock".
    ---------------------------->8------------------------
    
    So let's get rid of those not that much useful debug entries.
    
    Discussed problem could be easily reproduced with QEMU for x86_64.
    As well as this fix could be mimicked with muting of dynamic debug for
    the problematic lines as simple as:
    ---------------------------->8------------------------
    dyndbg="+p; file 8250_port.c line 1756 -p; file 8250_port.c line 1822 -p"
    ---------------------------->8------------------------

    [ Upstream commit fa2849e9649b5180ffc4cb3c3b005261c403093a ]
    
    For some reason the axp288_adc driver was modifying the
    AXP288_ADC_TS_PIN_CTRL register, changing bits 0-1 depending on
    whether the GP_ADC channel or another channel was written.
    
    These bits control when a bias current is send to the TS_PIN, the
    GP_ADC has its own pin and a separate bit in another register to
    control the bias current.
    
    Not only does changing when to enable the TS_PIN bias current
    (always or only when sampling) when reading the GP_ADC make no sense
    at all, the code is modifying these bits is writing the entire register,
    assuming that all the other bits have their default value.
    
    So if the firmware has configured a different bias-current for either
    pin, then that change gets clobbered by the write, likewise if the
    firmware has set bit 2 to indicate that the battery has no thermal sensor,
    this will get clobbered by the write.
    
    This commit fixes all this, by simply removing all writes to the
    AXP288_ADC_TS_PIN_CTRL register, they are not needed to read the
    GP_ADC pin, and can actually be harmful.

    iio: adc: imx25-gcq: Fix module autoload
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f0d7daf53972da0004f7a5a4d938c85333db300 ]
    
    If the driver is built as a module, autoload won't work because the module
    alias information is not filled. So user-space can't match the registered
    device with the corresponding module.
    
    Export the module alias information using the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro.
    
    Before this patch:
    
    $ modinfo drivers/iio/adc/fsl-imx25-gcq.ko | grep alias
    $
    
    After this patch:

    extcon: axp288: Use vbus-valid instead of -present to determine cable presence
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5757aca10146061befd168dab37fb0db1ccd8f73 ]
    
    The vbus-present bit in the power status register also gets set to 1
    when a usb-host cable (id-pin shorted to ground) is plugged in and a 5v
    boost converter is supplying 5v to the otg usb bus.
    
    This causes a "disconnect or unknown or ID event" warning in dmesg as
    well as the extcon device to report the last detected charger cable
    type as being connected even though none is connected.
    
    This commit switches to checking the vbus-valid bit instead, which is
    only 1 when both vbus is present and the vbus-path is enabled in the
    vbus-path control register (the vbus-path gets disabled when a usb-host
    cable is detected, to avoid the pmic drawing power from the 5v boost
    converter).

    igb: re-assign hw address pointer on reset after PCI error
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 69b97cf6dbce7403845a28bbc75d57f5be7b12ac ]
    
    Whenever the igb driver detects the result of a read operation returns
    a value composed only by F's (like 0xFFFFFFFF), it will detach the
    net_device, clear the hw_addr pointer and warn to the user that adapter's
    link is lost - those steps happen on igb_rd32().
    
    In case a PCI error happens on Power architecture, there's a recovery
    mechanism called EEH, that will reset the PCI slot and call driver's
    handlers to reset the adapter and network functionality as well.
    
    We observed that once hw_addr is NULL after the error is detected on
    igb_rd32(), it's never assigned back, so in the process of resetting
    the network functionality we got a NULL pointer dereference in both
    igb_configure_tx_ring() and igb_configure_rx_ring(). In order to avoid
    such bug, this patch re-assigns the hw_addr value in the slot_reset
    handler.

    [ Upstream commit ca244a83ecc7f0a9242ee2116e622cb6d7ec2a90 ]
    
    On chiliSOM TPS65217 nWAKEUP pin is connected to AM335x internal RTC
    EXT_WAKEUP input. In RTC-only state TPS65217 is notifying about power on
    events (such as power buton presses) by setting nWAKEUP output
    low. After that it waits 5s for proper device boot. Currently it doesn't
    happen, as the processor doesn't listen for such events. Consequently
    TPS65217 changes state from SLEEP (RTC-only state) to OFF.
    
    Enable EXT_WAKEUP input of AM335x's RTC, so the processor can properly
    detect power on events and recover immediately from RTC-only states,
    without powering off RTC and losing time.

    MIPS: Ensure bss section ends on a long-aligned address
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f00f4d8f083bc61005d0a1ef592b149f5c88bbd ]
    
    When clearing the .bss section in kernel_entry we do so using LONG_S
    instructions, and branch whilst the current write address doesn't equal
    the end of the .bss section minus the size of a long integer. The .bss
    section always begins at a long-aligned address and we always increment
    the write pointer by the size of a long integer - we therefore rely upon
    the .bss section ending at a long-aligned address. If this is not the
    case then the long-aligned write address can never be equal to the
    non-long-aligned end address & we will continue to increment past the
    end of the .bss section, attempting to zero the rest of memory.
    
    Despite this requirement that .bss end at a long-aligned address we pass
    0 as the end alignment requirement to the BSS_SECTION macro and thus
    don't guarantee any particular alignment, allowing us to hit the error
    condition described above.
    
    Fix this by instead passing 8 bytes as the end alignment argument to
    the BSS_SECTION macro, ensuring that the end of the .bss section is
    always at least long-aligned.

    Thanks to Venkat for debug and root casuing the issue
    where only first part of the message(RDMA) was
    successfully delivered but remainder payload delivery failed.
    In that case, application should not be notified with

    drm/i915: Fix the overlay frontbuffer tracking
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 58d09ebdb4edf5d3ab3a2aee851ab0168bc83ec6 ]
    
    Do the overlay frontbuffer tracking properly so that it matches
    the state of the overlay on/off/continue requests.
    
    One slight problem is that intel_frontbuffer_flip_complete()
    may get delayed by an arbitrarily liong time due to the fact that
    the overlay code likes to bail out when a signal occurs. So the
    flip may not get completed until the ioctl is restarted. But fixing
    that would require bigger surgery, so I decided to ignore it for now.
