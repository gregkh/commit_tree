    media/rc: Send sync space information on the lirc device
    
    commit a8f29e89f2b54fbf2c52be341f149bc195b63a8b upstream.
    
    Userspace expects to see a long space before the first pulse is sent on
    the lirc device.  Currently, if a long time has passed and a new packet
    is started, the lirc codec just returns and doesn't send anything.  This
    makes lircd ignore many perfectly valid signals unless they are sent in
    quick sucession.  When a reset event is delivered, we cannot know
    anything about the duration of the space.  But it should be safe to
    assume it has been a long time and we just set the duration to maximum.

    net: sctp: fix passing wrong parameter header to param_type2af in sctp_process_param
    
    [ Upstream commit cfbf654efc6d78dc9812e030673b86f235bf677d ]
    
    When making use of RFC5061, section 4.2.4. for setting the primary IP
    address, we're passing a wrong parameter header to param_type2af(),
    resulting always in NULL being returned.
    
    At this point, param.p points to a sctp_addip_param struct, containing
    a sctp_paramhdr (type = 0xc004, length = var), and crr_id as a correlation
    id. Followed by that, as also presented in RFC5061 section 4.2.4., comes
    the actual sctp_addr_param, which also contains a sctp_paramhdr, but
    this time with the correct type SCTP_PARAM_IPV{4,6}_ADDRESS that
    param_type2af() can make use of. Since we already hold a pointer to
    addr_param from previous line, just reuse it for param_type2af().

    ppp: deflate: never return len larger than output buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit e2a4800e75780ccf4e6c2487f82b688ba736eb18 ]
    
    When we've run out of space in the output buffer to store more data, we
    will call zlib_deflate with a NULL output buffer until we've consumed
    remaining input.
    
    When this happens, olen contains the size the output buffer would have
    consumed iff we'd have had enough room.
    
    This can later cause skb_over_panic when ppp_generic skb_put()s
    the returned length.

    ipv4: tcp: get rid of ugly unicast_sock
    
    [ Upstream commit bdbbb8527b6f6a358dbcb70dac247034d665b8e4 ]
    
    In commit be9f4a44e7d41 ("ipv4: tcp: remove per net tcp_sock")
    I tried to address contention on a socket lock, but the solution
    I chose was horrible :
    
    commit 3a7c384ffd57e ("ipv4: tcp: unicast_sock should not land outside
    of TCP stack") addressed a selinux regression.
    
    commit 0980e56e506b ("ipv4: tcp: set unicast_sock uc_ttl to -1")
    took care of another regression.
    
    commit b5ec8eeac46 ("ipv4: fix ip_send_skb()") fixed another regression.
    
    commit 811230cd85 ("tcp: ipv4: initialize unicast_sock sk_pacing_rate")
    was another shot in the dark.
    
    Really, just use a proper socket per cpu, and remove the skb_orphan()
    call, to re-enable flow control.
    
    This solves a serious problem with FQ packet scheduler when used in
    hostile environments, as we do not want to allocate a flow structure
    for every RST packet sent in response to a spoofed packet.

    bridge: dont send notification when skb->len == 0 in rtnl_bridge_notify

    Reported in: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92081
    
    This patch avoids calling rtnl_notify if the device ndo_bridge_getlink
    handler does not return any bytes in the skb.
    
    Alternately, the skb->len check can be moved inside rtnl_notify.
    
    For the bridge vlan case described in 92081, there is also a fix needed
    in bridge driver to generate a proper notification. Will fix that in
    subsequent patch.

    ping: Fix race in free in receive path
    
    [ Upstream commit fc752f1f43c1c038a2c6ae58cc739ebb5953ccb0 ]
    
    An exception is seen in ICMP ping receive path where the skb
    destructor sock_rfree() tries to access a freed socket. This happens
    because ping_rcv() releases socket reference with sock_put() and this
    internally frees up the socket. Later icmp_rcv() will try to free the
    skb and as part of this, skb destructor is called and which leads
    to a kernel panic as the socket is freed already in ping_rcv().
    
    -->|exception

    udp_diag: Fix socket skipping within chain
    
    [ Upstream commit 86f3cddbc3037882414c7308973530167906b7e9 ]
    
    While working on rhashtable walking I noticed that the UDP diag
    dumping code is buggy.  In particular, the socket skipping within
    a chain never happens, even though we record the number of sockets
    that should be skipped.
    
    As this code was supposedly copied from TCP, this patch does what
    TCP does and resets num before we walk a chain.

    ipv4: try to cache dst_entries which would cause a redirect
    
    [ Upstream commit df4d92549f23e1c037e83323aff58a21b3de7fe0 ]
    
    Not caching dst_entries which cause redirects could be exploited by hosts
    on the same subnet, causing a severe DoS attack. This effect aggravated
    since commit f88649721268999 ("ipv4: fix dst race in sk_dst_get()").
    
    Lookups causing redirects will be allocated with DST_NOCACHE set which
    will force dst_release to free them via RCU.  Unfortunately waiting for
    RCU grace period just takes too long, we can end up with >1M dst_entries
    waiting to be released and the system will run OOM. rcuos threads cannot
    catch up under high softirq load.
    
    Attaching the flag to emit a redirect later on to the specific skb allows
    us to cache those dst_entries thus reducing the pressure on allocation
    and deallocation.
    
    This issue was discovered by Marcelo Leitner.

    Since this only triggers in some collision-cases with AUTH, the problem at
    heart is that sctp_auth_key_put() on asoc->asoc_shared_key is called twice
    when having refcnt 1, once directly in sctp_assoc_update() and yet again
    from within sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() via sctp_assoc_update() on
    the already kzfree'd memory, which is also consistent with the observation
    of the poison decrease from 0x6b to 0x6a (note: the overwrite is detected
    at a later point in time when poison is checked on new allocation).
    
    Reference counting of auth keys revisited:
    
    Shared keys for AUTH chunks are being stored in endpoints and associations
    in endpoint_shared_keys list. On endpoint creation, a null key is being
    added; on association creation, all endpoint shared keys are being cached
    and thus cloned over to the association. struct sctp_shared_key only holds
    a pointer to the actual key bytes, that is, struct sctp_auth_bytes which
    keeps track of users internally through refcounting. Naturally, on assoc
    or enpoint destruction, sctp_shared_key are being destroyed directly and
    the reference on sctp_auth_bytes dropped.
    
    User space can add keys to either list via setsockopt(2) through struct
    sctp_authkey and by passing that to sctp_auth_set_key() which replaces or
    adds a new auth key. There, sctp_auth_create_key() creates a new sctp_auth_bytes
    with refcount 1 and in case of replacement drops the reference on the old
    sctp_auth_bytes. A key can be set active from user space through setsockopt()
    on the id via sctp_auth_set_active_key(), which iterates through either
    endpoint_shared_keys and in case of an assoc, invokes (one of various places)
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key().
    
    sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() computes the actual secret from local's
    and peer's random, hmac and shared key parameters and returns a new key
    directly as sctp_auth_bytes, that is asoc->asoc_shared_key, plus drops
    the reference if there was a previous one. The secret, which where we
    eventually double drop the ref comes from sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret() with
    intitial refcount of 1, which also stays unchanged eventually in
    sctp_assoc_update(). This key is later being used for crypto layer to
    set the key for the hash in crypto_hash_setkey() from sctp_auth_calculate_hmac().
    
    To close the loop: asoc->asoc_shared_key is freshly allocated secret
    material and independant of the sctp_shared_key management keeping track
    of only shared keys in endpoints and assocs. Hence, also commit 4184b2a79a76
    ("net: sctp: fix memory leak in auth key management") is independant of
    this bug here since it concerns a different layer (though same structures
    being used eventually). asoc->asoc_shared_key is reference dropped correctly
    on assoc destruction in sctp_association_free() and when active keys are
    being replaced in sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key(), it always has a refcount
    of 1. Hence, it's freed prematurely in sctp_assoc_update(). Simple fix is
    to remove that sctp_auth_key_put() from there which fixes these panics.

    netxen: fix netxen_nic_poll() logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 6088beef3f7517717bd21d90b379714dd0837079 ]
    
    NAPI poll logic now enforces that a poller returns exactly the budget
    when it wants to be called again.
    
    If a driver limits TX completion, it has to return budget as well when
    the limit is hit, not the number of received packets.

    ipv6: stop sending PTB packets for MTU < 1280
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d289715eb5c252ae15bd547cb252ca547a3c4f2 ]
    
    Reduce the attack vector and stop generating IPv6 Fragment Header for
    paths with an MTU smaller than the minimum required IPv6 MTU
    size (1280 byte) - called atomic fragments.
    
    See IETF I-D "Deprecating the Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments" [1]
    for more information and how this "feature" can be misused.

    net: rps: fix cpu unplug
    
    [ Upstream commit ac64da0b83d82abe62f78b3d0e21cca31aea24fa ]
    
    softnet_data.input_pkt_queue is protected by a spinlock that
    we must hold when transferring packets from victim queue to an active
    one. This is because other cpus could still be trying to enqueue packets
    into victim queue.
    
    A second problem is that when we transfert the NAPI poll_list from
    victim to current cpu, we absolutely need to special case the percpu
    backlog, because we do not want to add complex locking to protect
    process_queue : Only owner cpu is allowed to manipulate it, unless cpu
    is offline.
    
    Based on initial patch from Prasad Sodagudi & Subash Abhinov
    Kasiviswanathan.
    
    This version is better because we do not slow down packet processing,
    only make migration safer.

    ip: zero sockaddr returned on error queue
    
    [ Upstream commit f812116b174e59a350acc8e4856213a166a91222 ]
    
    The sockaddr is returned in IP(V6)_RECVERR as part of errhdr. That
    structure is defined and allocated on the stack as
    
        struct {
                struct sock_extended_err ee;
                struct sockaddr_in(6)    offender;
        } errhdr;
    
    The second part is only initialized for certain SO_EE_ORIGIN values.
    Always initialize it completely.
    
    An MTU exceeded error on a SOCK_RAW/IPPROTO_RAW is one example that
    would return uninitialized bytes.
