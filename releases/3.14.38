    net: ethernet: pcnet32: Setup the SRAM and NOUFLO on Am79C97{3, 5}
    
    commit 87f966d97b89774162df04d2106c6350c8fe4cb3 upstream.
    
    On a MIPS Malta board, tons of fifo underflow errors have been observed
    when using u-boot as bootloader instead of YAMON. The reason for that
    is that YAMON used to set the pcnet device to SRAM mode but u-boot does
    not. As a result, the default Tx threshold (64 bytes) is now too small to
    keep the fifo relatively used and it can result to Tx fifo underflow errors.
    As a result of which, it's best to setup the SRAM on supported controllers
    so we can always use the NOUFLO bit.

    Commit 746c9e9f92dd "of/base: Fix PowerPC address parsing hack" limited
    the applicability of the workaround whereby a missing ranges is treated
    as an empty ranges.  This workaround was hiding a bug in the etsec2

    powerpc/pseries: Little endian fixes for post mobility device tree update
    
    commit f6ff04149637723261aa4738958b0098b929ee9e upstream.
    
    We currently use the device tree update code in the kernel after resuming
    from a suspend operation to re-sync the kernels view of the device tree with
    that of the hypervisor. The code as it stands is not endian safe as it relies
    on parsing buffers returned by RTAS calls that thusly contains data in big
    endian format.
    
    This patch annotates variables and structure members with __be types as well
    as performing necessary byte swaps to cpu endian for data that needs to be
    parsed.

    powerpc/book3s: Fix the MCE code to use CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER
    
    commit 44d5f6f5901e996744858c175baee320ccf1eda3 upstream.
    
    commit id 2ba9f0d has changed CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV to tristate to allow
    HV/PR bits to be built as modules. But the MCE code still depends on
    CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV which is wrong. When user selects
    CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV=m to build HV/PR bits as a separate module the
    relevant MCE code gets excluded.
    
    This patch fixes the MCE code to use CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER. This
    makes sure that the relevant MCE code is included when HV/PR bits
    are built as a separate modules.

    hfsplus: fix B-tree corruption after insertion at position 0
    
    commit 98cf21c61a7f5419d82f847c4d77bf6e96a76f5f upstream.
    
    Fix B-tree corruption when a new record is inserted at position 0 in the
    node in hfs_brec_insert().  In this case a hfs_brec_update_parent() is
    called to update the parent index node (if exists) and it is passed
    hfs_find_data with a search_key containing a newly inserted key instead
    of the key to be updated.  This results in an inconsistent index node.
    The bug reproduces on my machine after an extents overflow record for
    the catalog file (CNID=4) is inserted into the extents overflow B-tree.
    Because of a low (reserved) value of CNID=4, it has to become the first
    record in the first leaf node.
    
    The resulting first leaf node is correct:
    
      ----------------------------------------------------
      | key0.CNID=4 | key1.CNID=123 | key2.CNID=456, ... |
      ----------------------------------------------------
    
    But the parent index key0 still contains the previous key CNID=123:
    
      -----------------------
      | key0.CNID=123 | ... |
      -----------------------
    
    A change in hfs_brec_insert() makes hfs_brec_update_parent() work
    correctly by preventing it from getting fd->record=-1 value from
    __hfs_brec_find().
    
    Along the way, I removed duplicate code with unification of the if
    condition.  The resulting code is equivalent to the original code
    because node is never 0.
    
    Also hfs_brec_update_parent() will now return an error after getting a
    negative fd->record value.  However, the return value of
    hfs_brec_update_parent() is not checked anywhere in the file and I'm
    leaving it unchanged by this patch.  brec.c lacks error checking after
    some other calls too, but this issue is of less importance than the one
    being fixed by this patch.

    spi: trigger trace event for message-done before mesg->complete
    
    commit 391949b6f02121371e3d7d9082c6d17fd9853034 upstream.
    
    With spidev the mesg->complete callback points to spidev_complete.
    Calling this unblocks spidev_sync and so spidev_sync_write finishes. As
    the struct spi_message just read is a local variable in
    spidev_sync_write and recording the trace event accesses this message
    the recording is better done first. The same can happen for
    spidev_sync_read.
    
    This fixes an oops observed on a 3.14-rt system with spidev activity
    after
    
            echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/spi/enable

    perf: Fix irq_work 'tail' recursion
    
    commit d525211f9d1be8b523ec7633f080f2116f5ea536 upstream.
    
    Vince reported a watchdog lockup like:
    
            [<ffffffff8115e114>] perf_tp_event+0xc4/0x210
            [<ffffffff810b4f8a>] perf_trace_lock+0x12a/0x160

            [<ffffffff8107bb4d>] do_send_sig_info+0x5d/0x80
            [<ffffffff811f69df>] send_sigio_to_task+0x12f/0x1a0
            [<ffffffff811f71ce>] send_sigio+0xae/0x100
            [<ffffffff811f72b7>] kill_fasync+0x97/0xf0
            [<ffffffff8115d0b4>] perf_event_wakeup+0xd4/0xf0
            [<ffffffff8115d103>] perf_pending_event+0x33/0x60
            [<ffffffff8114e3fc>] irq_work_run_list+0x4c/0x80
            [<ffffffff8114e448>] irq_work_run+0x18/0x40
            [<ffffffff810196af>] smp_trace_irq_work_interrupt+0x3f/0xc0
            [<ffffffff816c99bd>] trace_irq_work_interrupt+0x6d/0x80
    
    Which is caused by an irq_work generating new irq_work and therefore
    not allowing forward progress.
    
    This happens because processing the perf irq_work triggers another
    perf event (tracepoint stuff) which in turn generates an irq_work ad
    infinitum.
    
    Avoid this by raising the recursion counter in the irq_work -- which
    effectively disables all software events (including tracepoints) from
    actually triggering again.

    being returned instead of the expected -EINVAL value. Fix it.

    mac80211: disable u-APSD queues by default
    
    commit aa75ebc275b2a91b193654a177daf900ad6703f0 upstream.
    
    Some APs experience problems when working with
    U-APSD. Decreasing the probability of that
    happening by using legacy mode for all ACs but VO
    isn't enough.
    
    Cisco 4410N originally forced us to enable VO by
    default only because it treated non-VO ACs as
    legacy.
    
    However some APs (notably Netgear R7000) silently
    reclassify packets to different ACs. Since u-APSD
    ACs require trigger frames for frame retrieval
    clients would never see some frames (e.g. ARP
    responses) or would fetch them accidentally after
    a long time.
    
    It makes little sense to enable u-APSD queues by
    default because it needs userspace applications to
    be aware of it to actually take advantage of the
    possible additional powersavings. Implicitly
    depending on driver autotrigger frame support
    doesn't make much sense.

    nl80211: ignore HT/VHT capabilities without QoS/WMM
    
    commit 496fcc294daab18799e190c0264863d653588d1f upstream.
    
    As HT/VHT depend heavily on QoS/WMM, it's not a good idea to
    let userspace add clients that have HT/VHT but not QoS/WMM.
    Since it does so in certain cases we've observed (client is
    using HT IEs but not QoS/WMM) just ignore the HT/VHT info at
    this point and don't pass it down to the drivers which might
    unconditionally use it.

    tcm_qla2xxx: Fix incorrect use of __transport_register_session
    
    commit 75c3d0bf9caebb502e96683b2bc37f9692437e68 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes the incorrect use of __transport_register_session()
    in tcm_qla2xxx_check_initiator_node_acl() code, that does not perform
    explicit se_tpg->session_lock when accessing se_tpg->tpg_sess_list
    to add new se_sess nodes.
    
    Given that tcm_qla2xxx_check_initiator_node_acl() is not called with
    qla_hw->hardware_lock held for all accesses of ->tpg_sess_list, the
    code should be using transport_register_session() instead.

    commit d556546e7ecd9fca199df4698943024d40044f8e upstream.
    
    This patch adds a missing set of conditional check braces in
    ft_invl_hw_context() originally introduced by commit dcd998ccd
    when handling DDP failures in ft_recv_write_data() code.

    clocksource: efm32: Fix a NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit 7b8f10da3bf1056546133c9f54f49ce389fd95ab upstream.
    
    The initialisation of the efm32 clocksource first sets up the irq and only
    after that initialises the data needed for irq handling. In case this
    initialisation is delayed the irq handler would dereference a NULL pointer.
    
    I'm not aware of anything that could delay the process in such a way, but it's
    better to be safe than sorry, so setup the irq only when the clock event device
    is ready.

    regmap: regcache-rbtree: Fix present bitmap resize
    
    commit 328f494d95aac8bd4896aea2328bc281053bcb71 upstream.
    
    When inserting a new register into a block at the lower end the present
    bitmap is currently shifted into the wrong direction. The effect of this is
    that the bitmap becomes corrupted and registers which are present might be
    reported as not present and vice versa.
    
    Fix this by shifting left rather than right.

    commit 1096be084ac59927158ce80ff1d31c33eed0e565 upstream.
    
    The interrupt is enabled before the handler is set. Even this bug
    did not appear, it is potentially dangerous as it can lead to a
    NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Fix the error by enabling the interrupt after
    clockevents_config_and_register() is called.
