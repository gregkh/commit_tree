    staging: vt6656: Fix inconsistent structure packing
    
    commit 1ee4c55fc9620451b2a825d793042a7e0775391b upstream.
    
    vt6656 has several headers that use the #pragma pack(1) directive to
    enable structure packing, but never disable it.  The layout of
    structures defined in other headers can then depend on which order the
    various headers are included in, breaking the One Definition Rule.
    
    In practice this resulted in crashes on x86_64 until the order of header
    inclusion was changed for some files in commit 11d404cb56ecd ('staging:
    vt6656: fix headers and add cfg80211.').  But we need a proper fix that
    won't be affected by future changes to the order of inclusion.
    
    This removes the #pragma pack(1) directives and adds __packed to the
    structure definitions for which packing appears to have been intended.

    xen: Fix stack corruption in xen_failsafe_callback for 32bit PVOPS guests.
    
    commit 9174adbee4a9a49d0139f5d71969852b36720809 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2013-0190 / XSA-40
    
    There has been an error on the xen_failsafe_callback path for failed
    iret, which causes the stack pointer to be wrong when entering the
    iret_exc error path.  This can result in the kernel crashing.
    
    In the classic kernel case, the relevant code looked a little like:
    
            popl %eax      # Error code from hypervisor
            jz 5f
            addl $16,%esp
            jmp iret_exc   # Hypervisor said iret fault
    5:      addl $16,%esp
                           # Hypervisor said segment selector fault
    
    Here, there are two identical addls on either option of a branch which
    appears to have been optimised by hoisting it above the jz, and
    converting it to an lea, which leaves the flags register unaffected.
    
    In the PVOPS case, the code looks like:
    
            popl_cfi %eax         # Error from the hypervisor
            lea 16(%esp),%esp     # Add $16 before choosing fault path
            CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET -16
            jz 5f
            addl $16,%esp         # Incorrectly adjust %esp again
            jmp iret_exc
    
    It is possible unprivileged userspace applications to cause this
    behaviour, for example by loading an LDT code selector, then changing
    the code selector to be not-present.  At this point, there is a race
    condition where it is possible for the hypervisor to return back to
    userspace from an interrupt, fault on its own iret, and inject a
    failsafe_callback into the kernel.
    
    This bug has been present since the introduction of Xen PVOPS support
    in commit 5ead97c84 (xen: Core Xen implementation), in 2.6.23.

    xhci: fix null-pointer dereference when destroying half-built segment rings
    
    commit 68e5254adb88bede68285f11fb442a4d34fb550c upstream.
    
    xhci_alloc_segments_for_ring() builds a list of xhci_segments and links
    the tail to head at the end (forming a ring). When it bails out for OOM
    reasons half-way through, it tries to destroy its half-built list with
    xhci_free_segments_for_ring(), even though it is not a ring yet. This
    causes a null-pointer dereference upon hitting the last element.
    
    Furthermore, one of its callers (xhci_ring_alloc()) mistakenly believes
    the output parameters to be valid upon this kind of OOM failure, and
    calls xhci_ring_free() on them. Since the (incomplete) list/ring should
    already be destroyed in that case, this would lead to a use after free.
    
    This patch fixes those issues by having xhci_alloc_segments_for_ring()
    destroy its half-built, non-circular list manually and destroying the
    invalid struct xhci_ring in xhci_ring_alloc() with a plain kfree().
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that
    contains the commit 0ebbab37422315a5d0cb29792271085bafdf38c0 "USB: xhci:
    Ring allocation and initialization."
    
    A separate patch will need to be developed for kernels older than 3.4,
    since the ring allocation code was refactored in that kernel.

    USB: fix endpoint-disabling for failed config changes
    
    commit 36caff5d795429c572443894e8789c2150dd796b upstream.
    
    This patch (as1631) fixes a bug that shows up when a config change
    fails for a device under an xHCI controller.  The controller needs to
    be told to disable the endpoints that have been enabled for the new
    config.  The existing code does this, but before storing the
    information about which endpoints were enabled!  As a result, any
    second attempt to install the new config is doomed to fail because
    xhci-hcd will refuse to enable an endpoint that is already enabled.
    
    The patch optimistically initializes the new endpoints' device
    structures before asking the device to switch to the new config.  If
    the request fails then the endpoint information is already stored, so
    we can use usb_hcd_alloc_bandwidth() to disable the endpoints with no
    trouble.  The rest of the error path is slightly more complex now; we
    have to disable the new interfaces and call put_device() rather than
    simply deallocating them.

    x86/Sandy Bridge: reserve pages when integrated graphics is present
    
    commit a9acc5365dbda29f7be2884efb63771dc24bd815 upstream.
    
    SNB graphics devices have a bug that prevent them from accessing certain
    memory ranges, namely anything below 1M and in the pages listed in the
    table.  So reserve those at boot if set detect a SNB gfx device on the
    CPU to avoid GPU hangs.
    
    Stephane Marchesin had a similar patch to the page allocator awhile
    back, but rather than reserving pages up front, it leaked them at
    allocation time.

    s390/time: fix sched_clock() overflow
    
    commit ed4f20943cd4c7b55105c04daedf8d63ab6d499c upstream.
    
    Converting a 64 Bit TOD format value to nanoseconds means that the value
    must be divided by 4.096. In order to achieve that we multiply with 125
    and divide by 512.
    When used within sched_clock() this triggers an overflow after appr.
    417 days. Resulting in a sched_clock() return value that is much smaller
    than previously and therefore may cause all sort of weird things in
    subsystems that rely on a monotonic sched_clock() behaviour.
    
    To fix this implement a tod_to_ns() helper function which converts TOD
    values without overflow and call this function from both places that
    open coded the conversion: sched_clock() and kvm_s390_handle_wait().
