    libata: Add ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_ATI for Samsung 860 and 870 SSD.
    
    commit 7a8526a5cd51cf5f070310c6c37dd7293334ac49 upstream.
    
    Many users are reporting that the Samsung 860 and 870 SSD are having
    various issues when combined with AMD/ATI (vendor ID 0x1002)  SATA
    controllers and only completely disabling NCQ helps to avoid these
    issues.
    
    Always disabling NCQ for Samsung 860/870 SSDs regardless of the host
    SATA adapter vendor will cause I/O performance degradation with well
    behaved adapters. To limit the performance impact to ATI adapters,
    introduce the ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_ATI flag to force disable NCQ
    only for these adapters.
    
    Also, two libata.force parameters (noncqati and ncqati) are introduced
    to disable and enable the NCQ for the system which equipped with ATI
    SATA adapter and Samsung 860 and 870 SSDs. The user can determine NCQ
    function to be enabled or disabled according to the demand.
    
    After verifying the chipset from the user reports, the issue appears
    on AMD/ATI SB7x0/SB8x0/SB9x0 SATA Controllers and does not appear on
    recent AMD SATA adapters. The vendor ID of ATI should be 0x1002.
    Therefore, ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_AMD was modified to
    ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_ON_ATI.

    usb: testusb: Fix for showing the connection speed
    
    [ Upstream commit f81c08f897adafd2ed43f86f00207ff929f0b2eb ]
    
    testusb' application which uses 'usbtest' driver reports 'unknown speed'
    from the function 'find_testdev'. The variable 'entry->speed' was not
    updated from  the application. The IOCTL mentioned in the FIXME comment can
    only report whether the connection is low speed or not. Speed is read using
    the IOCTL USBDEVFS_GET_SPEED which reports the proper speed grade.  The
    call is implemented in the function 'handle_testdev' where the file
    descriptor was availble locally. Sample output is given below where 'high
    speed' is printed as the connected speed.
    
    sudo ./testusb -a

    ext2: fix sleeping in atomic bugs on error
    
    [ Upstream commit 372d1f3e1bfede719864d0d1fbf3146b1e638c88 ]
    
    The ext2_error() function syncs the filesystem so it sleeps.  The caller
    is holding a spinlock so it's not allowed to sleep.
    
       ext2_statfs() <- disables preempt
       -> ext2_count_free_blocks()
          -> ext2_get_group_desc()
    
    Fix this by using WARN() to print an error message and a stack trace
    instead of using ext2_error().

    sparc64: fix pci_iounmap() when CONFIG_PCI is not set
    
    [ Upstream commit d8b1e10a2b8efaf71d151aa756052fbf2f3b6d57 ]
    
    Guenter reported [1] that the pci_iounmap() changes remain problematic,
    with sparc64 allnoconfig and tinyconfig still not building due to the
    header file changes and confusion with the arch-specific pci_iounmap()
    implementation.
    
    I'm pretty convinced that sparc should just use GENERIC_IOMAP instead of
    doing its own thing, since it turns out that the sparc64 version of
    pci_iounmap() is somewhat buggy (see [2]).  But in the meantime, this
    just fixes the build by avoiding the trivial re-definition of the empty
    case.

    [ Upstream commit 3ede7f84c7c21f93c5eac611d60eba3f2c765e0f ]
    
    When re-entering the main loop of xenvif_tx_check_gop() a 2nd time, the
    special considerations for the head of the SKB no longer apply. Don't
    mistakenly report ERROR to the frontend for the first entry in the list,
    even if - from all I can tell - this shouldn't matter much as the overall
    transmit will need to be considered failed anyway.

    af_unix: fix races in sk_peer_pid and sk_peer_cred accesses
    
    commit 35306eb23814444bd4021f8a1c3047d3cb0c8b2b upstream.
    
    Jann Horn reported that SO_PEERCRED and SO_PEERGROUPS implementations
    are racy, as af_unix can concurrently change sk_peer_pid and sk_peer_cred.
    
    In order to fix this issue, this patch adds a new spinlock that needs
    to be used whenever these fields are read or written.
    
    Jann also pointed out that l2cap_sock_get_peer_pid_cb() is currently
    reading sk->sk_peer_pid which makes no sense, as this field
    is only possibly set by AF_UNIX sockets.
    We will have to clean this in a separate patch.
    This could be done by reverting b48596d1dc25 "Bluetooth: L2CAP: Add get_peer_pid callback"
    or implementing what was truly expected.
