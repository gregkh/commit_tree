    block: Fix wrong offset in bio_truncate()
    
    commit 3ee859e384d453d6ac68bfd5971f630d9fa46ad3 upstream.
    
    bio_truncate() clears the buffer outside of last block of bdev, however
    current bio_truncate() is using the wrong offset of page. So it can
    return the uninitialized data.
    
    This happened when both of truncated/corrupted FS and userspace (via
    bdev) are trying to read the last of bdev.

    KVM: nVMX: Allow VMREAD when Enlightened VMCS is in use
    
    commit 6cbbaab60ff33f59355492c241318046befd9ffc upstream.
    
    Hyper-V TLFS explicitly forbids VMREAD and VMWRITE instructions when
    Enlightened VMCS interface is in use:
    
    "Any VMREAD or VMWRITE instructions while an enlightened VMCS is
    active is unsupported and can result in unexpected behavior.""
    
    Windows 11 + WSL2 seems to ignore this, attempts to VMREAD VMCS field
    0x4404 ("VM-exit interruption information") are observed. Failing
    these attempts with nested_vmx_failInvalid() makes such guests
    unbootable.
    
    Microsoft confirms this is a Hyper-V bug and claims that it'll get fixed
    eventually but for the time being we need a workaround. (Temporary) allow
    VMREAD to get data from the currently loaded Enlightened VMCS.
    
    Note: VMWRITE instructions remain forbidden, it is not clear how to
    handle them properly and hopefully won't ever be needed.

    KVM: nVMX: Implement evmcs_field_offset() suitable for handle_vmread()
    
    commit 892a42c10ddb945d3a4dcf07dccdf9cb98b21548 upstream.
    
    In preparation to allowing reads from Enlightened VMCS from
    handle_vmread(), implement evmcs_field_offset() to get the correct
    read offset. get_evmcs_offset(), which is being used by KVM-on-Hyper-V,
    is almost what's needed but a few things need to be adjusted. First,
    WARN_ON() is unacceptable for handle_vmread() as any field can (in
    theory) be supplied by the guest and not all fields are defined in
    eVMCS v1. Second, we need to handle 'holes' in eVMCS (missing fields).
    It also sounds like a good idea to WARN_ON() if such fields are ever
    accessed by KVM-on-Hyper-V.
    
    Implement dedicated evmcs_field_offset() helper.
    
    No functional change intended.

    KVM: nVMX: Rename vmcs_to_field_offset{,_table}
    
    commit 2423a4c0d17418eca1ba1e3f48684cb2ab7523d5 upstream.
    
    vmcs_to_field_offset{,_table} may sound misleading as VMCS is an opaque
    blob which is not supposed to be accessed directly. In fact,
    vmcs_to_field_offset{,_table} are related to KVM defined VMCS12 structure.
    
    Rename vmcs_field_to_offset() to get_vmcs12_field_offset() for clarity.

    perf/core: Fix cgroup event list management
    
    commit c5de60cd622a2607c043ba65e25a6e9998a369f9 upstream.
    
    The active cgroup events are managed in the per-cpu cgrp_cpuctx_list.
    This list is only accessed from current cpu and not protected by any
    locks.  But from the commit ef54c1a476ae ("perf: Rework
    perf_event_exit_event()"), it's possible to access (actually modify)
    the list from another cpu.
    
    In the perf_remove_from_context(), it can remove an event from the
    context without an IPI when the context is not active.  This is not
    safe with cgroup events which can have some active events in the
    context even if ctx->is_active is 0 at the moment.  The target cpu
    might be in the middle of list iteration at the same time.
    
    If the event is enabled when it's about to be closed, it might call
    perf_cgroup_event_disable() and list_del() with the cgrp_cpuctx_list
    on a different cpu.
    
    This resulted in a crash due to an invalid list pointer access during
    the cgroup list traversal on the cpu which the event belongs to.
    
    Let's fallback to IPI to access the cgrp_cpuctx_list from that cpu.
    Similarly, perf_install_in_context() should use IPI for the cgroup
    events too.

    irqchip/realtek-rtl: Fix off-by-one in routing
    
    commit 91351b5dd0fd494eb2d85e1bb6aca77b067447e0 upstream.
    
    There is an offset between routing values (1..6) and the connected MIPS
    CPU interrupts (2..7), but no distinction was made between these two
    values.
    
    This issue was previously hidden during testing, because an interrupt
    mapping was used where for each required interrupt another (unused)
    routing was configured, with an offset of +1.
    
    Offset the CPU IRQ numbers by -1 to retrieve the correct routing value.

    irqchip/realtek-rtl: Map control data to virq
    
    commit 291e79c7e2eb6fdc016453597b78482e06199d0f upstream.
    
    The driver assigned the irqchip and irq handler to the hardware irq,
    instead of the virq. This is incorrect, and only worked because these
    irq numbers happened to be the same on the devices used for testing the
    original driver.

    When using per-vlan state, if vlan snooping and stats are disabled,
    untagged or priority-tagged ingress frame will go to check pvid state.
    If the port state is forwarding and the pvid state is not
    learning/forwarding, untagged or priority-tagged frame will be dropped
    but skb memory is not freed.
    Should free skb when __allowed_ingress returns false.

    ipv4: tcp: send zero IPID in SYNACK messages
    
    [ Upstream commit 970a5a3ea86da637471d3cd04d513a0755aba4bf ]
    
    In commit 431280eebed9 ("ipv4: tcp: send zero IPID for RST and
    ACK sent in SYN-RECV and TIME-WAIT state") we took care of some
    ctl packets sent by TCP.
    
    It turns out we need to use a similar strategy for SYNACK packets.
    
    By default, they carry IP_DF and IPID==0, but there are ways
    to ask them to use the hashed IP ident generator and thus
    be used to build off-path attacks.
    (Ref: Off-Path TCP Exploits of the Mixed IPID Assignment)
    
    One of this way is to force (before listener is started)
    echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc
    
    Another way is using forged ICMP ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED
    with a very small MTU (like 68) to force a false return from
    ip_dont_fragment()
    
    In this patch, ip_build_and_send_pkt() uses the following
    heuristics.
    
    1) Most SYNACK packets are smaller than IPV4_MIN_MTU and therefore
    can use IP_DF regardless of the listener or route pmtu setting.
    
    2) In case the SYNACK packet is bigger than IPV4_MIN_MTU,
    we use prandom_u32() generator instead of the IPv4 hashed ident one.

    When dumping vlan options for a single net device we send the same
    entries infinitely because user-space expects a 0 return at the end but
    we keep returning skb->len and restarting the dump on retry. Fix it by
    returning the value from br_vlan_dump_dev() if it completed or there was
    an error. The only case that must return skb->len is when the dump was
    incomplete and needs to continue (-EMSGSIZE).

    KVM: selftests: Don't skip L2's VMCALL in SMM test for SVM guest
    
    [ Upstream commit 4cf3d3ebe8794c449af3e0e8c1d790c97e461d20 ]
    
    Don't skip the vmcall() in l2_guest_code() prior to re-entering L2, doing
    so will result in L2 running to completion, popping '0' off the stack for
    RET, jumping to address '0', and ultimately dying with a triple fault
    shutdown.
    
    It's not at all obvious why the test re-enters L2 and re-executes VMCALL,
    but presumably it serves a purpose.  The VMX path doesn't skip vmcall(),
    and the test can't possibly have passed on SVM, so just do what VMX does.

    sch_htb: Fail on unsupported parameters when offload is requested
    
    [ Upstream commit 429c3be8a5e2695b5b92a6a12361eb89eb185495 ]
    
    The current implementation of HTB offload doesn't support some
    parameters. Instead of ignoring them, actively return the EINVAL error
    when they are set to non-defaults.
    
    As this patch goes to stable, the driver API is not changed here. If
    future drivers support more offload parameters, the checks can be moved
    to the driver side.
    
    Note that the buffer and cbuffer parameters are also not supported, but
    the tc userspace tool assigns some default values derived from rate and
    ceil, and identifying these defaults in sch_htb would be unreliable, so
    they are still ignored.

    video: hyperv_fb: Fix validation of screen resolution
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ff5549b1d1d3c3a9d71220d44bd246586160f1d ]
    
    In the WIN10 version of the Synthetic Video protocol with Hyper-V,
    Hyper-V reports a list of supported resolutions as part of the protocol
    negotiation. The driver calculates the maximum width and height from
    the list of resolutions, and uses those maximums to validate any screen
    resolution specified in the video= option on the kernel boot line.
    
    This method of validation is incorrect. For example, the list of
    supported resolutions could contain 1600x1200 and 1920x1080, both of
    which fit in an 8 Mbyte frame buffer.  But calculating the max width
    and height yields 1920 and 1200, and 1920x1200 resolution does not fit
    in an 8 Mbyte frame buffer.  Unfortunately, this resolution is accepted,
    causing a kernel fault when the driver accesses memory outside the
    frame buffer.
    
    Instead, validate the specified screen resolution by calculating
    its size, and comparing against the frame buffer size.  Delete the
    code for calculating the max width and height from the list of
    resolutions, since these max values have no use.  Also add the
    frame buffer size to the info message to aid in understanding why
    a resolution might be rejected.

    ibmvnic: don't spin in tasklet
    
    [ Upstream commit 48079e7fdd0269d66b1d7d66ae88bd03162464ad ]
    
    ibmvnic_tasklet() continuously spins waiting for responses to all
    capability requests. It does this to avoid encountering an error
    during initialization of the vnic. However if there is a bug in the
    VIOS and we do not receive a response to one or more queries the
    tasklet ends up spinning continuously leading to hard lock ups.
    
    If we fail to receive a message from the VIOS it is reasonable to
    timeout the login attempt rather than spin indefinitely in the tasklet.

    ibmvnic: init ->running_cap_crqs early
    
    [ Upstream commit 151b6a5c06b678687f64f2d9a99fd04d5cd32b72 ]
    
    We use ->running_cap_crqs to determine when the ibmvnic_tasklet() should
    send out the next protocol message type. i.e when we get back responses
    to all our QUERY_CAPABILITY CRQs we send out REQUEST_CAPABILITY crqs.
    Similiary, when we get responses to all the REQUEST_CAPABILITY crqs, we
    send out the QUERY_IP_OFFLOAD CRQ.
    
    We currently increment ->running_cap_crqs as we send out each CRQ and
    have the ibmvnic_tasklet() send out the next message type, when this
    running_cap_crqs count drops to 0.
    
    This assumes that all the CRQs of the current type were sent out before
    the count drops to 0. However it is possible that we send out say 6 CRQs,
    get preempted and receive all the 6 responses before we send out the
    remaining CRQs. This can result in ->running_cap_crqs count dropping to
    zero before all messages of the current type were sent and we end up
    sending the next protocol message too early.
    
    Instead initialize the ->running_cap_crqs upfront so the tasklet will
    only send the next protocol message after all responses are received.
    
    Use the cap_reqs local variable to also detect any discrepancy (either
    now or in future) in the number of capability requests we actually send.
    
    Currently only send_query_cap() is affected by this behavior (of sending
    next message early) since it is called from the worker thread (during
    reset) and from application thread (during ->ndo_open()) and they can be
    preempted. send_request_cap() is only called from the tasklet  which
    processes CRQ responses sequentially, is not be affected.  But to
    maintain the existing symmtery with send_query_capability() we update
    send_request_capability() also.

    ibmvnic: Allow extra failures before disabling
    
    [ Upstream commit db9f0e8bf79e6da7068b5818fea0ffd9d0d4b4da ]
    
    If auto-priority-failover (APF) is enabled and there are at least two
    backing devices of different priorities, some resets like fail-over,
    change-param etc can cause at least two back to back failovers. (Failover
    from high priority backing device to lower priority one and then back
    to the higher priority one if that is still functional).
    
    Depending on the timimg of the two failovers it is possible to trigger
    a "hard" reset and for the hard reset to fail due to failovers. When this
    occurs, the driver assumes that the network is unstable and disables the
    VNIC for a 60-second "settling time". This in turn can cause the ethtool
    command to fail with "No such device" while the vnic automatically recovers
    a little while later.
    
    Given that it's possible to have two back to back failures, allow for extra
    failures before disabling the vnic for the settling time.

    ipv4: fix ip option filtering for locally generated fragments
    
    [ Upstream commit 27a8caa59babb96c5890569e131bc0eb6d45daee ]
    
    During IP fragmentation we sanitize IP options. This means overwriting
    options which should not be copied with NOPs. Only the first fragment
    has the original, full options.
    
    ip_fraglist_prepare() copies the IP header and options from previous
    fragment to the next one. Commit 19c3401a917b ("net: ipv4: place control
    buffer handling away from fragmentation iterators") moved sanitizing
    options before ip_fraglist_prepare() which means options are sanitized
    and then overwritten again with the old values.
    
    Fixing this is not enough, however, nor did the sanitization work
    prior to aforementioned commit.
    
    ip_options_fragment() (which does the sanitization) uses ipcb->opt.optlen
    for the length of the options. ipcb->opt of fragments is not populated
    (it's 0), only the head skb has the state properly built. So even when
    called at the right time ip_options_fragment() does nothing. This seems
    to date back all the way to v2.5.44 when the fast path for pre-fragmented
    skbs had been introduced. Prior to that ip_options_build() would have been
    called for every fragment (in fact ever since v2.5.44 the fragmentation
    handing in ip_options_build() has been dead code, I'll clean it up in
    -next).
    
    In the original patch (see Link) caixf mentions fixing the handling
    for fragments other than the second one, but I'm not sure how _any_
    fragment could have had their options sanitized with the code
    as it stood.
    
    Tested with python (MTU on lo lowered to 1000 to force fragmentation):
    
      import socket
      s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
      s.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_OPTIONS,
                   bytearray([7,4,5,192, 20|0x80,4,1,0]))
      s.sendto(b'1'*2000, ('127.0.0.1', 1234))
    
    Before:
    
    IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1053, offset 0, flags [+], proto UDP (17), length 996, options (RR [bad length 4] [bad ptr 5] 192.148.4.1,,RA value 256))

        localhost > localhost: udp
    
    After:

    The warning indicates that MSR_EE being set(interrupt enabled) when
    there was an overflown PMC detected. This could happen in
    power_pmu_disable since it runs under interrupt soft disable
    condition ( local_irq_save ) and not with interrupts hard disabled.
    commit 2c9ac51b850d ("powerpc/perf: Fix PMU callbacks to clear
    pending PMI before resetting an overflown PMC") intended to clear
    PMI pending bit in Paca when disabling the PMU. It could happen
    that PMC gets overflown while code is in power_pmu_disable
    callback function. Hence add a check to see if PMI pending bit
    is set in Paca before clearing it via clear_pmi_pending.

    [ Upstream commit bc341a1a98827925082e95db174734fc8bd68af6 ]
    
    If alert handling is broken, interrupts are disabled after an alert and
    re-enabled after the alert clears. However, if there is an interrupt
    handler, this does not apply if alerts were originally disabled and enabled
    when the driver was loaded. In that case, interrupts will stay disabled
    after an alert was handled though the alert handler even after the alert
    condition clears. Address the situation by always re-enabling interrupts
    after the alert condition clears if there is an interrupt handler.

    Drivers: hv: balloon: account for vmbus packet header in max_pkt_size
    
    [ Upstream commit 96d9d1fa5cd505078534113308ced0aa56d8da58 ]
    
    Commit adae1e931acd ("Drivers: hv: vmbus: Copy packets sent by Hyper-V
    out of the ring buffer") introduced a notion of maximum packet size in
    vmbus channel and used that size to initialize a buffer holding all
    incoming packet along with their vmbus packet header. hv_balloon uses
    the default maximum packet size VMBUS_DEFAULT_MAX_PKT_SIZE which matches
    its maximum message size, however vmbus_open expects this size to also
    include vmbus packet header. This leads to 4096 bytes
    dm_unballoon_request messages being truncated to 4080 bytes. When the
    driver tries to read next packet it starts from a wrong read_index,
    receives garbage and prints a lot of "Unhandled message: type:
    <garbage>" in dmesg.
    
    Allocate the buffer with HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE more bytes to make room for
    the header.

    io_uring: fix bug in slow unregistering of nodes
    
    [ Upstream commit b36a2050040b2d839bdc044007cdd57101d7f881 ]
    
    In some cases io_rsrc_ref_quiesce will call io_rsrc_node_switch_start,
    and then immediately flush the delayed work queue &ctx->rsrc_put_work.
    
    However the percpu_ref_put does not immediately destroy the node, it
    will be called asynchronously via RCU. That ends up with
    io_rsrc_node_ref_zero only being called after rsrc_put_work has been
    flushed, and so the process ends up sleeping for 1 second unnecessarily.
    
    This patch executes the put code immediately if we are busy
    quiescing.

    efi/libstub: arm64: Fix image check alignment at entry
    
    [ Upstream commit e9b7c3a4263bdcfd31bc3d03d48ce0ded7a94635 ]
    
    The kernel is aligned at SEGMENT_SIZE and this is the size populated in the PE
    headers:
    
    arch/arm64/kernel/efi-header.S: .long   SEGMENT_ALIGN // SectionAlignment
    
    EFI_KIMG_ALIGN is defined as: (SEGMENT_ALIGN > THREAD_ALIGN ? SEGMENT_ALIGN :
    THREAD_ALIGN)
    
    So it depends on THREAD_ALIGN. On newer builds this message started to appear
    even though the loader is taking into account the PE header (which is stating
    SEGMENT_ALIGN).

    rxrpc: Adjust retransmission backoff
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c13c05c5ff4b9fc907b07f7311821910ebaaf8a ]
    
    Improve retransmission backoff by only backing off when we retransmit data
    packets rather than when we set the lost ack timer.
    
    To this end:
    
     (1) In rxrpc_resend(), use rxrpc_get_rto_backoff() when setting the
         retransmission timer and only tell it that we are retransmitting if we
         actually have things to retransmit.
    
         Note that it's possible for the retransmission algorithm to race with
         the processing of a received ACK, so we may see no packets needing
         retransmission.
    
     (2) In rxrpc_send_data_packet(), don't bump the backoff when setting the
         ack_lost_at timer, as it may then get bumped twice.
    
    With this, when looking at one particular packet, the retransmission
    intervals were seen to be 1.5ms, 2ms, 3ms, 5ms, 9ms, 17ms, 33ms, 71ms,
    136ms, 264ms, 544ms, 1.088s, 2.1s, 4.2s and 8.3s.

    octeontx2-pf: Forward error codes to VF
    
    [ Upstream commit a8db854be28622a2477cb21cdf7f829adbb2c42d ]
    
    PF forwards its VF messages to AF and corresponding
    replies from AF to VF. AF sets proper error code in the
    replies after processing message requests. Currently PF
    checks the error codes in replies and sends invalid
    message to VF. This way VF lacks the information of
    error code set by AF for its messages. This patch
    changes that such that PF simply forwards AF replies
    so that VF can handle error codes.

    [ Upstream commit 1581d61b42d985cefe7b71eea67ab3bfcbf34d0f ]
    
    It's been observed that sometimes link credit restore takes
    a lot of time than the current timeout. This patch increases
    the default timeout value and return the proper error value
    on failure.

    [ Upstream commit d225c449ab2be25273a3674f476c6c0b57c50254 ]
    
    AF modifies all the rules destined for VF to use

    was needed because AF only installs default rules with
    RSS action. But the action in rules installed by a PF
    for its VFs should not be changed by this fixup.
    This is because action can be drop or direct to
    queue as specified by user(ntuple filters).

    net: phy: broadcom: hook up soft_reset for BCM54616S
    
    [ Upstream commit d15c7e875d44367005370e6a82e8f3a382a04f9b ]
    
    A problem was encountered with the Bel-Fuse 1GBT-SFP05 SFP module (which
    is a 1 Gbps copper module operating in SGMII mode with an internal
    BCM54616S PHY device) using the Xilinx AXI Ethernet MAC core, where the
    module would work properly on the initial insertion or boot of the
    device, but after the device was rebooted, the link would either only
    come up at 100 Mbps speeds or go up and down erratically.
    
    I found no meaningful changes in the PHY configuration registers between
    the working and non-working boots, but the status registers seemed to
    have a lot of error indications set on the SERDES side of the device on
    the non-working boot. I suspect the problem is that whatever happens on
    the SGMII link when the device is rebooted and the FPGA logic gets
    reloaded ends up putting the module's onboard PHY into a bad state.
    
    Since commit 6e2d85ec0559 ("net: phy: Stop with excessive soft reset")
    the genphy_soft_reset call is not made automatically by the PHY core
    unless the callback is explicitly specified in the driver structure. For
    most of these Broadcom devices, there is probably a hardware reset that
    gets asserted to reset the PHY during boot, however for SFP modules
    (where the BCM54616S is commonly found) no such reset line exists, so if
    the board keeps the SFP cage powered up across a reboot, it will end up
    with no reset occurring during reboots.
    
    Hook up the genphy_soft_reset callback for BCM54616S to ensure that a
    PHY reset is performed before the device is initialized. This appears to
    fix the issue with erratic operation after a reboot with this SFP
    module.

    sched/pelt: Relax the sync of util_sum with util_avg
    
    [ Upstream commit 98b0d890220d45418cfbc5157b3382e6da5a12ab ]
    
    Rick reported performance regressions in bugzilla because of cpu frequency
    being lower than before:
        https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215045
    
    He bisected the problem to:
    commit 1c35b07e6d39 ("sched/fair: Ensure _sum and _avg values stay consistent")
    
    This commit forces util_sum to be synced with the new util_avg after
    removing the contribution of a task and before the next periodic sync. By
    doing so util_sum is rounded to its lower bound and might lost up to
    LOAD_AVG_MAX-1 of accumulated contribution which has not yet been
    reflected in util_avg.
    
    Instead of always setting util_sum to the low bound of util_avg, which can
    significantly lower the utilization of root cfs_rq after propagating the
    change down into the hierarchy, we revert the change of util_sum and
    propagate the difference.
    
    In addition, we also check that cfs's util_sum always stays above the
    lower bound for a given util_avg as it has been observed that
    sched_entity's util_sum is sometimes above cfs one.

    perf: Fix perf_event_read_local() time
    
    [ Upstream commit 09f5e7dc7ad705289e1b1ec065439aa3c42951c4 ]
    
    Time readers that cannot take locks (due to NMI etc..) currently make
    use of perf_event::shadow_ctx_time, which, for that event gives:
    
      time' = now + (time - timestamp)
    
    or, alternatively arranged:
    
      time' = time + (now - timestamp)
    
    IOW, the progression of time since the last time the shadow_ctx_time
    was updated.
    
    There's problems with this:
    
     A) the shadow_ctx_time is per-event, even though the ctx_time it
        reflects is obviously per context. The direct concequence of this
        is that the context needs to iterate all events all the time to
        keep the shadow_ctx_time in sync.
    
     B) even with the prior point, the context itself might not be active
        meaning its time should not advance to begin with.
    
     C) shadow_ctx_time isn't consistently updated when ctx_time is
    
    There are 3 users of this stuff, that suffer differently from this:
    
     - calc_timer_values()
       - perf_output_read()
       - perf_event_update_userpage()       /* A */
    
     - perf_event_read_local()              /* A,B */
    
    In particular, perf_output_read() doesn't suffer at all, because it's
    sample driven and hence only relevant when the event is actually
    running.
    
    This same was supposed to be true for perf_event_update_userpage(),
    after all self-monitoring implies the context is active *HOWEVER*, as
    per commit f79256532682 ("perf/core: fix userpage->time_enabled of
    inactive events") this goes wrong when combined with counter
    overcommit, in that case those events that do not get scheduled when
    the context becomes active (task events typically) miss out on the
    EVENT_TIME update and ENABLED time is inflated (for a little while)
    with the time the context was inactive. Once the event gets rotated
    in, this gets corrected, leading to a non-monotonic timeflow.
    
    perf_event_read_local() made things even worse, it can request time at
    any point, suffering all the problems perf_event_update_userpage()
    does and more. Because while perf_event_update_userpage() is limited
    by the context being active, perf_event_read_local() users have no
    such constraint.
    
    Therefore, completely overhaul things and do away with
    perf_event::shadow_ctx_time. Instead have regular context time updates
    keep track of this offset directly and provide perf_event_time_now()
    to complement perf_event_time().
    
    perf_event_time_now() will, in adition to being context wide, also
    take into account if the context is active. For inactive context, it
    will not advance time.
    
    This latter property means the cgroup perf_cgroup_info context needs
    to grow addition state to track this.
    
    Additionally, since all this is strictly per-cpu, we can use barrier()
    to order context activity vs context time.

    powerpc/64s: Mask SRR0 before checking against the masked NIP
    
    [ Upstream commit aee101d7b95a03078945681dd7f7ea5e4a1e7686 ]
    
    Commit 314f6c23dd8d ("powerpc/64s: Mask NIP before checking against
    SRR0") masked off the low 2 bits of the NIP value in the interrupt
    stack frame in case they are non-zero and mis-compare against a SRR0
    register value of a CPU which always reads back 0 from the 2 low bits
    which are reserved.
    
    This now causes the opposite problem that an implementation which does
    implement those bits in SRR0 will mis-compare against the masked NIP
    value in which they have been cleared. QEMU is one such implementation,
    and this is allowed by the architecture.
    
    This can be triggered by sigfuz by setting low bits of PT_NIP in the
    signal context.
    
    Fix this for now by masking the SRR0 bits as well. Cleaner is probably
    to sanitise these values before putting them in registers or stack, but
    this is the quick and backportable fix.

    [ Upstream commit eee412e968f7b950564880bc6a7a9f00f49034da ]
    
    When CONFIG_QCOM_AOSS_QMP=m and CONFIG_QCOM_Q6V5_MSS=y, the builtin
    driver cannot call into the loadable module's low-level service
    functions. Trying to build with that config combo causes linker errors.
    
    There are two problems here. First, drivers/remoteproc/qcom_q6v5.c
    should #include <linux/soc/qcom/qcom_aoss.h> for the definitions of
    the service functions, depending on whether CONFIG_QCOM_AOSS_QMP is
    set/enabled or not. Second, the qcom remoteproc drivers should depend
    on QCOM_AOSS_QMP iff it is enabled (=y or =m) so that the qcom
    remoteproc drivers can be built properly.
    
    This prevents these build errors:

    netfilter: conntrack: don't increment invalid counter on NF_REPEAT
    
    [ Upstream commit 830af2eba40327abec64325a5b08b1e85c37a2e0 ]
    
    The packet isn't invalid, REPEAT means we're trying again after cleaning
    out a stale connection, e.g. via tcp tracker.
    
    This caused increases of invalid stat counter in a test case involving
    frequent connection reuse, even though no packet is actually invalid.

    After commit:7866a621043f ("dev: add per net_device packet type chains"),
    we can not get packet types that are bound to a specified net device by

    NFSv4: Handle case where the lookup of a directory fails
    
    commit ac795161c93699d600db16c1a8cc23a65a1eceaf upstream.
    
    If the application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a
    regular file, nfs_atomic_open() will punt to doing a regular lookup.
    If the server then returns a regular file, we will happily return a
    file descriptor with uninitialised open state.
    
    The fix is to return the expected ENOTDIR error in these cases.

    hwmon: (lm90) Reduce maximum conversion rate for G781
    
    [ Upstream commit a66c5ed539277b9f2363bbace0dba88b85b36c26 ]
    
    According to its datasheet, G781 supports a maximum conversion rate value
    of 8 (62.5 ms). However, chips labeled G781 and G780 were found to only
    support a maximum conversion rate value of 7 (125 ms). On the other side,
    chips labeled G781-1 and G784 were found to support a conversion rate value
    of 8. There is no known means to distinguish G780 from G781 or G784; all
    chips report the same manufacturer ID and chip revision.
    Setting the conversion rate register value to 8 on chips not supporting
    it causes unexpected behavior since the real conversion rate is set to 0
    (16 seconds) if a value of 8 is written into the conversion rate register.
    Limit the conversion rate register value to 7 for all G78x chips to avoid
    the problem.

    ipv4: avoid using shared IP generator for connected sockets
    
    commit 23f57406b82de51809d5812afd96f210f8b627f3 upstream.
    
    ip_select_ident_segs() has been very conservative about using
    the connected socket private generator only for packets with IP_DF
    set, claiming it was needed for some VJ compression implementations.
    
    As mentioned in this referenced document, this can be abused.
    (Ref: Off-Path TCP Exploits of the Mixed IPID Assignment)
    
    Before switching to pure random IPID generation and possibly hurt
    some workloads, lets use the private inet socket generator.
    
    Not only this will remove one vulnerability, this will also
    improve performance of TCP flows using pmtudisc==IP_PMTUDISC_DONT

    ping: fix the sk_bound_dev_if match in ping_lookup
    
    commit 2afc3b5a31f9edf3ef0f374f5d70610c79c93a42 upstream.
    
    When 'ping' changes to use PING socket instead of RAW socket by:
    
       # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 100"
    
    the selftests 'router_broadcast.sh' will fail, as such command
    
      # ip vrf exec vrf-h1 ping -I veth0 198.51.100.255 -b
    
    can't receive the response skb by the PING socket. It's caused by mismatch
    of sk_bound_dev_if and dif in ping_rcv() when looking up the PING socket,
    as dif is vrf-h1 if dif's master was set to vrf-h1.
    
    This patch is to fix this regression by also checking the sk_bound_dev_if
    against sdif so that the packets can stil be received even if the socket
    is not bound to the vrf device but to the real iif.

    net: fix information leakage in /proc/net/ptype
    
    commit 47934e06b65637c88a762d9c98329ae6e3238888 upstream.
    
    In one net namespace, after creating a packet socket without binding
    it to a device, users in other net namespaces can observe the new
    `packet_type` added by this packet socket by reading `/proc/net/ptype`
    file. This is minor information leakage as packet socket is
    namespace aware.
    
    Add a net pointer in `packet_type` to keep the net namespace of
    of corresponding packet socket. In `ptype_seq_show`, this net pointer
    must be checked when it is not NULL.

    ARM: 9170/1: fix panic when kasan and kprobe are enabled
    
    commit 8b59b0a53c840921b625378f137e88adfa87647e upstream.
    
    arm32 uses software to simulate the instruction replaced
    by kprobe. some instructions may be simulated by constructing
    assembly functions. therefore, before executing instruction
    simulation, it is necessary to construct assembly function
    execution environment in C language through binding registers.
    after kasan is enabled, the register binding relationship will
    be destroyed, resulting in instruction simulation errors and
    causing kernel panic.
    
    the kprobe emulate instruction function is distributed in three
    files: actions-common.c actions-arm.c actions-thumb.c, so disable
    KASAN when compiling these files.
    
    for example, use kprobe insert on cap_capable+20 after kasan
    enabled, the cap_capable assembly code is as follows:
    <cap_capable>:
    e92d47f0        push    {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, sl, lr}
    e1a05000        mov     r5, r0
    e280006c        add     r0, r0, #108    ; 0x6c
    e1a04001        mov     r4, r1
    e1a06002        mov     r6, r2
    e59fa090        ldr     sl, [pc, #144]  ;
    ebfc7bf8        bl      c03aa4b4 <__asan_load4>
    e595706c        ldr     r7, [r5, #108]  ; 0x6c
    e2859014        add     r9, r5, #20
    ......
    The emulate_ldr assembly code after enabling kasan is as follows:
    c06f1384 <emulate_ldr>:
    e92d47f0        push    {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, sl, lr}

    e1a00008        mov     r0, r8
    e1a09001        mov     r9, r1
    e1a04002        mov     r4, r2

    e7e36655        ubfx    r6, r5, #12, #4
    e205a00f        and     sl, r5, #15
    0a000001        beq     c06f13bc <emulate_ldr+0x38>
    e0840107        add     r0, r4, r7, lsl #2
    ebf3545c        bl      c03c6530 <__asan_load4>
    e084010a        add     r0, r4, sl, lsl #2
    ebf3545a        bl      c03c6530 <__asan_load4>
    e2890010        add     r0, r9, #16
    ebf35458        bl      c03c6530 <__asan_load4>

    scsi: bnx2fc: Flush destroy_work queue before calling bnx2fc_interface_put()
    
    commit 847f9ea4c5186fdb7b84297e3eeed9e340e83fce upstream.
    
    The bnx2fc_destroy() functions are removing the interface before calling
    destroy_work. This results multiple WARNings from sysfs_remove_group() as
    the controller rport device attributes are removed too early.

    The problem is easily reproducible with the following steps.
    
    Example:

    commit 61263b3a11a2594b4e898f166c31162236182b5c upstream.
    
    GFP_KERNEL/GFP_DMA can't be used under a spin lock. According the comment,
    els_ios_lock is used to protect els ios list so we can move down the spin
    lock to avoid using this flag under the lock.

    rpmsg: char: Fix race between the release of rpmsg_eptdev and cdev
    
    commit 7a534ae89e34e9b51acb5a63dd0f88308178b46a upstream.
    
    struct rpmsg_eptdev contains a struct cdev. The current code frees
    the rpmsg_eptdev struct in rpmsg_eptdev_destroy(), but the cdev is
    a managed object, therefore its release is not predictable and the
    rpmsg_eptdev could be freed before the cdev is entirely released.
    
    The cdev_device_add/del() API was created to address this issue
    (see commit '233ed09d7fda ("chardev: add helper function to register
    char devs with a struct device")'), use it instead of cdev add/del().

    commit 0f344c8129a5337dae50e31b817dd50a60ff238c upstream.
    
    Fix for failed to init adminq: -53 while VF is resetting via MAC
    address changing procedure.
    Added sync module to avoid reading deadbeef value in reinit adminq
    during software reset.
    Without this patch it is possible to trigger VF reset procedure
    during reinit adminq. This resulted in an incorrect reading of
    value from the AQP registers and generated the -53 error.

    This was caused by PF queue pile fragmentation due to
    flow director VSI queue being placed right after main VSI.
    Because of this main VSI was not able to resize its
    queue allocation for XDP resulting in no queues allocated
    for main VSI when XDP was turned on.
    
    Fix this by always allocating last queue in PF queue pile
    for a flow director VSI.

    i40e: Fix issue when maximum queues is exceeded
    
    commit d701658a50a471591094b3eb3961b4926cc8f104 upstream.
    
    Before this patch VF interface vanished when
    maximum queue number was exceeded. Driver tried
    to add next queues even if there was not enough
    space. PF sent incorrect number of queues to
    the VF when there were not enough of them.
    
    Add an additional condition introduced to check
    available space in 'qp_pile' before proceeding.
    This condition makes it impossible to add queues
    if they number is greater than the number resulting
    from available space.
    Also add the search for free space in PF queue
    pair piles.
    
    Without this patch VF interfaces are not seen
    when available space for queues has been
    exceeded and following logs appears permanently
    in dmesg:
    "Unable to get VF config (-32)".
    "VF 62 failed opcode 3, retval: -5"
    "Unable to get VF config due to PF error condition, not retrying"

    powerpc/32: Fix boot failure with GCC latent entropy plugin
    
    commit bba496656a73fc1d1330b49c7f82843836e9feb1 upstream.
    
    Boot fails with GCC latent entropy plugin enabled.
    
    This is due to early boot functions trying to access 'latent_entropy'
    global data while the kernel is not relocated at its final
    destination yet.
    
    As there is no way to tell GCC to use PTRRELOC() to access it,
    disable latent entropy plugin in early_32.o and feature-fixups.o and
    code-patching.o

            0: 0xc0000000-0xcfffffff 0x00000000       256M Kernel rw      m
            1: 0xd0000000-0xdfffffff 0x10000000       256M Kernel rw      m
            2: 0xe0000000-0xefffffff 0x20000000       256M Kernel rw      m
            3: 0xf8000000-0xf9ffffff 0x2a000000        32M Kernel rw      m
            4: 0xfa000000-0xfdffffff 0x2c000000        64M Kernel rw      m
    
    A BAT must have both virtual and physical addresses alignment matching
    the size of the BAT. This is not the case for BAT 4 above.
    
    Fix kasan_init_region() by using block_size() function that is in
    book3s32/mmu.c. To be able to reuse it here, make it non static and
    change its name to bat_block_size() in order to avoid name conflict
    with block_size() defined in <linux/blkdev.h>
    
    Also reuse find_free_bat() to avoid an error message from setbat()
    when no BAT is available.
    
    And allocate memory outside of linear memory mapping to avoid
    wasting that precious space.
    
    With this change we get correct alignment for BATs and KASAN shadow
    memory is allocated outside the linear memory space.

    powerpc/32s: Allocate one 256k IBAT instead of two consecutives 128k IBATs
    
    commit 37eb7ca91b692e8e49e7dd50158349a6c8fb5b09 upstream.
    
    Today we have the following IBATs allocated:
    
            ---[ Instruction Block Address Translation ]---
            0: 0xc0000000-0xc03fffff 0x00000000         4M Kernel   x     m
            1: 0xc0400000-0xc05fffff 0x00400000         2M Kernel   x     m
            2: 0xc0600000-0xc06fffff 0x00600000         1M Kernel   x     m
            3: 0xc0700000-0xc077ffff 0x00700000       512K Kernel   x     m
            4: 0xc0780000-0xc079ffff 0x00780000       128K Kernel   x     m
            5: 0xc07a0000-0xc07bffff 0x007a0000       128K Kernel   x     m
            6:         -
            7:         -
    
    The two 128K should be a single 256K instead.
    
    When _etext is not aligned to 128Kbytes, the system will allocate
    all necessary BATs to the lower 128Kbytes boundary, then allocate
    an additional 128Kbytes BAT for the remaining block.
    
    Instead, align the top to 128Kbytes so that the function directly
    allocates a 256Kbytes last block:

    commit 1f52b0aba6fd37653416375cb8a1ca673acf8d5f upstream.
    
    Changes to the AMD Thresholding sysfs code prevents sysfs writes from
    updating the underlying registers once CPU init is completed, i.e.
    "threshold_banks" is set.
    
    Allow the registers to be updated if the thresholding interface is
    already initialized or if in the init path. Use the "set_lvt_off" value
    to indicate if running in the init path, since this value is only set
    during init.

    PCI/sysfs: Find shadow ROM before static attribute initialization
    
    commit 66d28b21fe6b3da8d1e9f0a7ba38bc61b6c547e1 upstream.
    
    Ville reported that the sysfs "rom" file for VGA devices disappeared after
    527139d738d7 ("PCI/sysfs: Convert "rom" to static attribute").
    
    Prior to 527139d738d7, FINAL fixups, including pci_fixup_video() where we
    find shadow ROMs, were run before pci_create_sysfs_dev_files() created the
    sysfs "rom" file.
    
    After 527139d738d7, "rom" is a static attribute and is created before FINAL
    fixups are run, so we didn't create "rom" files for shadow ROMs:
    
      acpi_pci_root_add
        ...
          pci_scan_single_device
            pci_device_add
              pci_fixup_video                    # <-- new HEADER fixup
              device_add
                ...
                  if (grp->is_visible())
                    pci_dev_rom_attr_is_visible  # after 527139d738d7
        pci_bus_add_devices
          pci_bus_add_device
            pci_fixup_device(pci_fixup_final)
              pci_fixup_video                    # <-- previous FINAL fixup
            pci_create_sysfs_dev_files
              if (pci_resource_len(pdev, PCI_ROM_RESOURCE))
                sysfs_create_bin_file("rom")     # before 527139d738d7
    
    Change pci_fixup_video() to be a HEADER fixup so it runs before sysfs
    static attributes are initialized.
    
    Rename the Loongson pci_fixup_radeon() to pci_fixup_video() and make its
    dmesg logging identical to the others since it is doing the same job.

    sched/membarrier: Fix membarrier-rseq fence command missing from query bitmask
    
    commit 809232619f5b15e31fb3563985e705454f32621f upstream.
    
    The membarrier command MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY allows querying the
    available membarrier commands. When the membarrier-rseq fence commands
    were added, a new MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK was
    introduced with the intent to expose them with the MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY
    command, the but it was never added to MEMBARRIER_CMD_BITMASK.
    
    The membarrier-rseq fence commands are therefore not wired up with the
    query command.
    
    Rename MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK to
    MEMBARRIER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK (the bitmask is not a command
    per-se), and change the erroneous
    MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK (which does not
    actually exist) to MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ.
    
    Wire up MEMBARRIER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_RSEQ_BITMASK in
    MEMBARRIER_CMD_BITMASK. Fixing this allows discovering availability of
    the membarrier-rseq fence feature.

    ocfs2: fix a deadlock when commit trans
    
    commit ddf4b773aa40790dfa936bd845c18e735a49c61c upstream.
    
    commit 6f1b228529ae introduces a regression which can deadlock as
    follows:
    
      Task1:                              Task2:
      jbd2_journal_commit_transaction     ocfs2_test_bg_bit_allocatable
      spin_lock(&jh->b_state_lock)        jbd_lock_bh_journal_head
      __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint    spin_lock(&jh->b_state_lock)
      jbd2_journal_put_journal_head
      jbd_lock_bh_journal_head
    
    Task1 and Task2 lock bh->b_state and jh->b_state_lock in different
    order, which finally result in a deadlock.
    
    So use jbd2_journal_[grab|put]_journal_head instead in
    ocfs2_test_bg_bit_allocatable() to fix it.

    mm, kasan: use compare-exchange operation to set KASAN page tag
    
    commit 27fe73394a1c6d0b07fa4d95f1bca116d1cc66e9 upstream.
    
    It has been reported that the tag setting operation on newly-allocated
    pages can cause the page flags to be corrupted when performed
    concurrently with other flag updates as a result of the use of
    non-atomic operations.
    
    Fix the problem by using a compare-exchange loop to update the tag.

    mt76: connac: introduce MCU_CE_CMD macro
    
    commit 680a2ead741ad9b479a53adf154ed5eee74d2b9a upstream.
    
    Similar to MCU_EXT_CMD, introduce MCU_CE_CMD for CE commands
    
    Stable kernel notes:
    
    Upstream commit 547224024579 (mt76: connac: introduce MCU_UNI_CMD macro,
    2021-12-09) introduced a bug by removing MCU_UNI_PREFIX, but not
    updating MCU_CMD_MASK accordingly, so when commands are compared in
    mt7921_mcu_parse_response() one has the extra bit __MCU_CMD_FIELD_UNI
    set and the comparison fails:
    
      if (mcu_cmd != event->cid)
      if (20001 != 1)
    
    The fix was sneaked by in the next commit 680a2ead741a (mt76: connac:
    introduce MCU_CE_CMD macro, 2021-12-09):
    
    -       int mcu_cmd = cmd & MCU_CMD_MASK;
    +       int mcu_cmd = FIELD_GET(__MCU_CMD_FIELD_ID, cmd);
    
    But it was never merged into linux-stable.
    
    We need either both commits, or none.

    ucsi_ccg: Check DEV_INT bit only when starting CCG4
    
    commit 825911492eb15bf8bb7fb94bc0c0421fe7a6327d upstream.
    
    CCGx clears Bit 0:Device Interrupt in the INTR_REG
    if CCGx is reset successfully. However, there might
    be a chance that other bits in INTR_REG are not
    cleared due to internal data queued in PPM. This case
    misleads the driver that CCGx reset failed.
    
    The commit checks bit 0 in INTR_REG and ignores other
    bits. The ucsi driver would reset PPM later.

    usb: typec: tcpci: don't touch CC line if it's Vconn source
    
    commit 5638b0dfb6921f69943c705383ff40fb64b987f2 upstream.
    
    With the AMS and Collision Avoidance, tcpm often needs to change the CC's
    termination. When one CC line is sourcing Vconn, if we still change its
    termination, the voltage of the another CC line is likely to be fluctuant
    and unstable.
    
    Therefore, we should verify whether a CC line is sourcing Vconn before
    changing its termination and only change the termination that is not
    a Vconn line. This can be done by reading the Vconn Present bit of
    POWER_ STATUS register. To determine the polarity, we can read the
    Plug Orientation bit of TCPC_CONTROL register. Since Vconn can only be
    sourced if Plug Orientation is set.

    USB: core: Fix hang in usb_kill_urb by adding memory barriers
    
    commit 26fbe9772b8c459687930511444ce443011f86bf upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzer has identified a bug in which processes hang waiting
    for usb_kill_urb() to return.  It turns out the issue is not unlinking
    the URB; that works just fine.  Rather, the problem arises when the
    wakeup notification that the URB has completed is not received.
    
    The reason is memory-access ordering on SMP systems.  In outline form,
    usb_kill_urb() and __usb_hcd_giveback_urb() operating concurrently on
    different CPUs perform the following actions:
    
    CPU 0                                   CPU 1
    ----------------------------            ---------------------------------
    usb_kill_urb():                         __usb_hcd_giveback_urb():
      ...                                     ...
      atomic_inc(&urb->reject);               atomic_dec(&urb->use_count);
      ...                                     ...
      wait_event(usb_kill_urb_queue,
            atomic_read(&urb->use_count) == 0);
                                              if (atomic_read(&urb->reject))
                                                    wake_up(&usb_kill_urb_queue);
    
    Confining your attention to urb->reject and urb->use_count, you can
    see that the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 0 is:
    
            write urb->reject, then read urb->use_count;
    
    whereas the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 1 is:
    
            write urb->use_count, then read urb->reject.
    
    This pattern is referred to in memory-model circles as SB (for "Store
    Buffering"), and it is well known that without suitable enforcement of
    the desired order of accesses -- in the form of memory barriers -- it
    is entirely possible for one or both CPUs to execute their reads ahead
    of their writes.  The end result will be that sometimes CPU 0 sees the
    old un-decremented value of urb->use_count while CPU 1 sees the old
    un-incremented value of urb->reject.  Consequently CPU 0 ends up on
    the wait queue and never gets woken up, leading to the observed hang
    in usb_kill_urb().
    
    The same pattern of accesses occurs in usb_poison_urb() and the
    failure pathway of usb_hcd_submit_urb().
    
    The problem is fixed by adding suitable memory barriers.  To provide
    proper memory-access ordering in the SB pattern, a full barrier is
    required on both CPUs.  The atomic_inc() and atomic_dec() accesses
    themselves don't provide any memory ordering, but since they are
    present, we can use the optimized smp_mb__after_atomic() memory
    barrier in the various routines to obtain the desired effect.
    
    This patch adds the necessary memory barriers.

    commit 2cc9b1c93b1c4caa2d971856c0780fb5f7d04692 upstream.
    
    The code that looked up the USB3 PHY was ignoring all errors other than
    EPROBE_DEFER in an attempt to handle the PHY not being present. Fix and
    simplify the code by using devm_phy_optional_get and dev_err_probe so
    that a missing PHY is not treated as an error and unexpected errors
    are handled properly.

    usb: dwc3: xilinx: Skip resets and USB3 register settings for USB2.0 mode
    
    commit 9678f3361afc27a3124cd2824aec0227739986fb upstream.
    
    It appears that the PIPE clock should not be selected when only USB 2.0
    is being used in the design and no USB 3.0 reference clock is used.
    Also, the core resets are not required if a USB3 PHY is not in use, and
    will break things if USB3 is actually used but the PHY entry is not
    listed in the device tree.
    
    Skip core resets and register settings that are only required for
    USB3 mode when no USB3 PHY is specified in the device tree.

    usb: common: ulpi: Fix crash in ulpi_match()
    
    commit 2e3dd4a6246945bf84ea6f478365d116e661554c upstream.
    
    Commit 7495af930835 ("ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable drivers for
    DragonBoard 410c") enables the CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_USB_HS for the ARM
    multi_v7_defconfig. Enabling this Kconfig is causing the kernel to crash
    on the Tegra20 Ventana platform in the ulpi_match() function.
    
    The Qualcomm USB HS PHY driver that is enabled by CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_USB_HS,
    registers a ulpi_driver but this driver does not provide an 'id_table',
    so when ulpi_match() is called on the Tegra20 Ventana platform, it
    crashes when attempting to deference the id_table pointer which is not
    valid. The Qualcomm USB HS PHY driver uses device-tree for matching the
    ULPI driver with the device and so fix this crash by using device-tree
    for matching if the id_table is not valid.

            3. xhci_suspend call xhci_disable_hub_port_wake, which access register,
               but clock already gated by run time suspend.
    
    This problem was hidden by power domain driver, which call run time resume before it.
    
    But the below commit remove it and make this issue happen.
            commit c1df456d0f06e ("PM: domains: Don't runtime resume devices at genpd_prepare()")
    
    This patch call run time resume before suspend to make sure clock is on
    before access register.

    usb-storage: Add unusual-devs entry for VL817 USB-SATA bridge
    
    commit 5b67b315037250a61861119683e7fcb509deea25 upstream.
    
    Two people have reported (and mentioned numerous other reports on the
    web) that VIA's VL817 USB-SATA bridge does not work with the uas
    driver.  Typical log messages are:
    
    [ 3606.232149] sd 14:0:0:0: [sdg] tag#2 uas_zap_pending 0 uas-tag 1 inflight: CMD
    [ 3606.232154] sd 14:0:0:0: [sdg] tag#2 CDB: Write(16) 8a 00 00 00 00 00 18 0c c9 80 00 00 00 80 00 00
    [ 3606.306257] usb 4-4.4: reset SuperSpeed Plus Gen 2x1 USB device number 11 using xhci_hcd
    [ 3606.328584] scsi host14: uas_eh_device_reset_handler success
    
    Surprisingly, the devices do seem to work okay for some other people.
    The cause of the differing behaviors is not known.
    
    In the hope of getting the devices to work for the most users, even at
    the possible cost of degraded performance for some, this patch adds an
    unusual_devs entry for the VL817 to block it from binding to the uas
    driver by default.  Users will be able to override this entry by means
    of a module parameter, if they want.

    commit f23653fe64479d96910bfda2b700b1af17c991ac upstream.
    
    Fix a user API regression introduced with commit f76edd8f7ce0 ("tty:
    cyclades, remove this orphan"), which removed a part of the API and
    caused compilation errors for user programs using said part, such as
    GCC 9 in its libsanitizer component[1]:

    As the absolute minimum required bring `struct cyclades_monitor' and
    ioctl numbers back then so as to make the library build again.  Add a
    preprocessor warning as to the obsolescence of the features provided.

    tty: n_gsm: fix SW flow control encoding/handling
    
    commit 8838b2af23caf1ff0610caef2795d6668a013b2d upstream.
    
    n_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
    See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
    The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
    the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.2.7.3 states that DC1 (XON) and DC3 (XOFF)
    are the control characters defined in ISO/IEC 646. These shall be quoted if
    seen in the data stream to avoid interpretation as flow control characters.
    
    ISO/IEC 646 refers to the set of ISO standards described as the ISO
    7-bit coded character set for information interchange. Its final version
    is also known as ITU T.50.
    See https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.50-199209-I/en
    
    To abide the standard it is needed to quote DC1 and DC3 correctly if these
    are seen as data bytes and not as control characters. The current
    implementation already tries to enforce this but fails to catch all
    defined cases. 3GPP 27.010 chapter 5.2.7.3 clearly states that the most
    significant bit shall be ignored for DC1 and DC3 handling. The current
    implementation handles only the case with the most significant bit set 0.
    Cases in which DC1 and DC3 have the most significant bit set 1 are left
    unhandled.
    
    This patch fixes this by masking the data bytes with ISO_IEC_646_MASK (only
    the 7 least significant bits set 1) before comparing them with XON
    (a.k.a. DC1) and XOFF (a.k.a. DC3) when testing which byte values need
    quotation via byte stuffing.

    tty: rpmsg: Fix race condition releasing tty port
    
    commit db7f19c0aa0abcb751ff0ed694a071363f702b1d upstream.
    
    The tty_port struct is part of the rpmsg_tty_port structure.
    The issue is that the rpmsg_tty_port structure is freed on
    rpmsg_tty_remove while it is still referenced in the tty_struct.
    Its release is not predictable due to workqueues.
    
    For instance following ftrace shows that rpmsg_tty_close is called after
    rpmsg_tty_release_cport:
    
         nr_test.sh-389     [000] .....   212.093752: rpmsg_tty_remove <-rpmsg_dev_
    remove
                 cat-1191    [001] .....   212.095697: tty_release <-__fput
          nr_test.sh-389     [000] .....   212.099166: rpmsg_tty_release_cport <-rpm
    sg_tty_remove
                 cat-1191    [001] .....   212.115352: rpmsg_tty_close <-tty_release
                 cat-1191    [001] .....   212.115371: release_tty <-tty_release_str
    
    As consequence, the port must be free only when user has released the TTY
    interface.
    
    This path :
    - Introduce the .destruct port tty ops function to release the allocated
      rpmsg_tty_port structure.
    - Introduce the .hangup tty ops function to call tty_port_hangup.
    - Manages the tty port refcounting to trig the .destruct port ops,
    - Introduces the rpmsg_tty_cleanup function to ensure that the TTY is
      removed before decreasing the port refcount.

    serial: 8250: of: Fix mapped region size when using reg-offset property
    
    commit d06b1cf28297e27127d3da54753a3a01a2fa2f28 upstream.
    
    8250_of supports a reg-offset property which is intended to handle
    cases where the device registers start at an offset inside the region
    of memory allocated to the device. The Xilinx 16550 UART, for which this
    support was initially added, requires this. However, the code did not
    adjust the overall size of the mapped region accordingly, causing the
    driver to request an area of memory past the end of the device's
    allocation. For example, if the UART was allocated an address of
    0xb0130000, size of 0x10000 and reg-offset of 0x1000 in the device
    tree, the region of memory reserved was b0131000-b0140fff, which caused
    the driver for the region starting at b0140000 to fail to probe.
    
    Fix this by subtracting reg-offset from the mapped region size.

    commit b879f915bc48a18d4f4462729192435bb0f17052 upstream.
    
    Record the start_time for a bio but defer the starting block core's IO
    accounting until after IO is submitted using bio_start_io_acct_time().
    
    This approach avoids the need to mess around with any of the
    individual IO stats in response to a bio_split() that follows bio
    submission.

    arm64: extable: fix load_unaligned_zeropad() reg indices
    
    commit 3758a6c74e08bdc15ccccd6872a6ad37d165239a upstream.
    
    In ex_handler_load_unaligned_zeropad() we erroneously extract the data and
    addr register indices from ex->type rather than ex->data. As ex->type will
    contain EX_TYPE_LOAD_UNALIGNED_ZEROPAD (i.e. 4):
     * We'll always treat X0 as the address register, since EX_DATA_REG_ADDR is
       extracted from bits [9:5]. Thus, we may attempt to dereference an
       arbitrary address as X0 may hold an arbitrary value.
     * We'll always treat X4 as the data register, since EX_DATA_REG_DATA is
       extracted from bits [4:0]. Thus we will corrupt X4 and cause arbitrary
       behaviour within load_unaligned_zeropad() and its caller.
    
    Fix this by extracting both values from ex->data as originally intended.
    
    On an MTE-enabled QEMU image we are hitting the following crash:
     Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

    Core of the problem is that ceph checks for return code from
    security_dentry_init_security() and if return code is 0, it assumes
    everything is fine and continues to call strlen(name), which crashes.
    
    Typically SELinux LSM returns 0 and sets name to "security.selinux" and
    it is not a problem. Or if selinux is not compiled in or disabled, it
    returns -EOPNOTSUP and ceph deals with it.
    
    But somehow in this configuration, 0 is being returned and "name" is
    not being initialized and that's creating the problem.
    
    Our suspicion is that BPF LSM is registering a hook for
    dentry_init_security() and returns hook default of 0.
    
    LSM_HOOK(int, 0, dentry_init_security, struct dentry *dentry,...)
    
    I have not been able to reproduce it just by doing CONFIG_BPF_LSM=y.
    Stephen has tested the patch though and confirms it solves the problem
    for him.
    
    dentry_init_security() is written in such a way that it expects only one
    LSM to register the hook. Atleast that's the expectation with current code.
    
    If another LSM returns a hook and returns default, it will simply return
    0 as of now and that will break ceph.
    
    Hence, suggestion is that change semantics of this hook a bit. If there
    are no LSMs or no LSM is taking ownership and initializing security context,
    then return -EOPNOTSUP. Also allow at max one LSM to initialize security
    context. This hook can't deal with multiple LSMs trying to init security
    context. This patch implements this new behavior.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Fix nested HFSCR being clobbered with multiple vCPUs
    
    commit 22f7ff0dea9491e90b6fe808ed40c30bd791e5c2 upstream.
    
    The L0 is storing HFSCR requested by the L1 for the L2 in struct
    kvm_nested_guest when the L1 requests a vCPU enter L2. kvm_nested_guest
    is not a per-vCPU structure. Hilarity ensues.
    
    Fix it by moving the nested hfscr into the vCPU structure together with
    the other per-vCPU nested fields.

    KVM: x86: Sync the states size with the XCR0/IA32_XSS at, any time
    
    commit 05a9e065059e566f218f8778c4d17ee75db56c55 upstream.
    
    XCR0 is reset to 1 by RESET but not INIT and IA32_XSS is zeroed by
    both RESET and INIT. The kvm_set_msr_common()'s handling of MSR_IA32_XSS
    also needs to update kvm_update_cpuid_runtime(). In the above cases, the
    size in bytes of the XSAVE area containing all states enabled by XCR0 or
    (XCRO | IA32_XSS) needs to be updated.
    
    For simplicity and consistency, existing helpers are used to write values
    and call kvm_update_cpuid_runtime(), and it's not exactly a fast path.

    KVM: x86: Forcibly leave nested virt when SMM state is toggled
    
    commit f7e570780efc5cec9b2ed1e0472a7da14e864fdb upstream.
    
    Forcibly leave nested virtualization operation if userspace toggles SMM
    state via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS or KVM_SYNC_X86_EVENTS.  If userspace
    forces the vCPU out of SMM while it's post-VMXON and then injects an SMI,
    vmx_enter_smm() will overwrite vmx->nested.smm.vmxon and end up with both
    vmxon=false and smm.vmxon=false, but all other nVMX state allocated.
    
    Don't attempt to gracefully handle the transition as (a) most transitions
    are nonsencial, e.g. forcing SMM while L2 is running, (b) there isn't
    sufficient information to handle all transitions, e.g. SVM wants access
    to the SMRAM save state, and (c) KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS must precede
    KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE during state restore as the latter disallows putting
    the vCPU into L2 if SMM is active, and disallows tagging the vCPU as
    being post-VMXON in SMM if SMM is not active.
    
    Abuse of KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS manifests as a WARN and memory leak in nVMX
    due to failure to free vmcs01's shadow VMCS, but the bug goes far beyond
    just a memory leak, e.g. toggling SMM on while L2 is active puts the vCPU
    in an architecturally impossible state.

    KVM: x86: Move CPUID.(EAX=0x12,ECX=1) mangling to __kvm_update_cpuid_runtime()

    Full equality check of CPUID data on update (kvm_cpuid_check_equal()) may
    fail for SGX enabled CPUs as CPUID.(EAX=0x12,ECX=1) is currently being
    mangled in kvm_vcpu_after_set_cpuid(). Move it to

    KVM: x86: nSVM: skip eax alignment check for non-SVM instructions
    
    commit 47c28d436f409f5b009dc82bd82d4971088aa391 upstream.
    
    The bug occurs on #GP triggered by VMware backdoor when eax value is
    unaligned. eax alignment check should not be applied to non-SVM
    instructions because it leads to incorrect omission of the instructions
    emulation.
    Apply the alignment check only to SVM instructions to fix.

    KVM: LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC
    
    commit 35fe7cfbab2e81f1afb23fc4212210b1de6d9633 upstream.
    
    The below warning is splatting during guest reboot.
    
      ------------[ cut here ]------------
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1931 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10322 kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]

      RIP: 0033:0x7fd39797350b
    
    This can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline mode and doing a reboot in
    the guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot path
    will not disarm the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown() clears
    APIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bit is 0, this can trigger timer-mode
    switch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic, which can result in preemption
    timer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on this when
    not exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated by preemption
    timer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemption timer
    under KVM_SET_LAPIC.

    drm/atomic: Add the crtc to affected crtc only if uapi.enable = true
    
    commit 5ec1cebd59300ddd26dbaa96c17c508764eef911 upstream.
    
    In case of a modeset where a mode gets split across multiple CRTCs
    in the driver specific implementation (bigjoiner in i915) we wrongly count
    the affected CRTCs based on the drm_crtc_mask and indicate the stolen CRTC as
    an affected CRTC in atomic_check_only().
    This triggers a warning since affected CRTCs doent match requested CRTC.
    
    To fix this in such bigjoiner configurations, we should only
    increment affected crtcs if that CRTC is enabled in UAPI not
    if it is just used internally in the driver to split the mode.

    perf/x86/intel: Add a quirk for the calculation of the number of counters on Alder Lake
    
    commit 7fa981cad216e9f64f49e22112f610c0bfed91bc upstream.
    
    For some Alder Lake machine with all E-cores disabled in a BIOS, the
    below warning may be triggered.
    
    [ 2.010766] hw perf events fixed 5 > max(4), clipping!
    
    Current perf code relies on the CPUID leaf 0xA and leaf 7.EDX[15] to
    calculate the number of the counters and follow the below assumption.
    
    For a hybrid configuration, the leaf 7.EDX[15] (X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU)
    is set. The leaf 0xA only enumerate the common counters. Linux perf has
    to manually add the extra GP counters and fixed counters for P-cores.
    For a non-hybrid configuration, the X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU should not
    be set. The leaf 0xA enumerates all counters.
    
    However, that's not the case when all E-cores are disabled in a BIOS.
    Although there are only P-cores in the system, the leaf 7.EDX[15]
    (X86_FEATURE_HYBRID_CPU) is still set. But the leaf 0xA is updated
    to enumerate all counters of P-cores. The inconsistency triggers the
    warning.
    
    Several software ways were considered to handle the inconsistency.
    - Drop the leaf 0xA and leaf 7.EDX[15] CPUID enumeration support.
      Hardcode the number of counters. This solution may be a problem for
      virtualization. A hypervisor cannot control the number of counters
      in a Linux guest via changing the guest CPUID enumeration anymore.
    - Find another CPUID bit that is also updated with E-cores disabled.
      There may be a problem in the virtualization environment too. Because
      a hypervisor may disable the feature/CPUID bit.
    - The P-cores have a maximum of 8 GP counters and 4 fixed counters on
      ADL. The maximum number can be used to detect the case.
      This solution is implemented in this patch.

    perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix CAS_COUNT_WRITE issue for ICX
    
    commit 96fd2e89fba1aaada6f4b1e5d25a9d9ecbe1943d upstream.
    
    The user recently report a perf issue in the ICX platform, when test by
    perf event “uncore_imc_x/cas_count_write”,the write bandwidth is always
    very small (only 0.38MB/s), it is caused by the wrong "umask" for the
    "cas_count_write" event. When double-checking, find "cas_count_read"
    also is wrong.
    
    The public document for ICX uncore:
    
    3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family, Codename Ice Lake,Uncore
    Performance Monitoring Reference Manual, Revision 1.00, May 2021
    
    On 2.4.7, it defines Unit Masks for CAS_COUNT:
    RD b00001111
    WR b00110000
    
    So corrected both "cas_count_read" and "cas_count_write" for ICX.
    
    Old settings:
     hswep_uncore_imc_events
            INTEL_UNCORE_EVENT_DESC(cas_count_read,  "event=0x04,umask=0x03")
            INTEL_UNCORE_EVENT_DESC(cas_count_write, "event=0x04,umask=0x0c")
    
    New settings:
     snr_uncore_imc_events
            INTEL_UNCORE_EVENT_DESC(cas_count_read,  "event=0x04,umask=0x0f")
            INTEL_UNCORE_EVENT_DESC(cas_count_write, "event=0x04,umask=0x30")

    With write operation on psi files replacing old trigger with a new one,
    the lifetime of its waitqueue is totally arbitrary. Overwriting an
    existing trigger causes its waitqueue to be freed and pending poll()
    will stumble on trigger->event_wait which was destroyed.
    Fix this by disallowing to redefine an existing psi trigger. If a write
    operation is used on a file descriptor with an already existing psi
    trigger, the operation will fail with EBUSY error.
    Also bypass a check for psi_disabled in the psi_trigger_destroy as the
    flag can be flipped after the trigger is created, leading to a memory
    leak.

    Revert "KVM: SVM: avoid infinite loop on NPF from bad address"
    
    commit 31c25585695abdf03d6160aa6d829e855b256329 upstream.
    
    Revert a completely broken check on an "invalid" RIP in SVM's workaround
    for the DecodeAssists SMAP errata.  kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_memslot() obviously
    expects a gfn, i.e. operates in the guest physical address space, whereas
    RIP is a virtual (not even linear) address.  The "fix" worked for the
    problematic KVM selftest because the test identity mapped RIP.
    
    Fully revert the hack instead of trying to translate RIP to a GPA, as the
    non-SEV case is now handled earlier, and KVM cannot access guest page
    tables to translate RIP.
    
    This reverts commit e72436bc3a5206f95bb384e741154166ddb3202e.

    fsnotify: fix fsnotify hooks in pseudo filesystems
    
    commit 29044dae2e746949ad4b9cbdbfb248994d1dcdb4 upstream.
    
    Commit 49246466a989 ("fsnotify: move fsnotify_nameremove() hook out of
    d_delete()") moved the fsnotify delete hook before d_delete() so fsnotify
    will have access to a positive dentry.
    
    This allowed a race where opening the deleted file via cached dentry
    is now possible after receiving the IN_DELETE event.
    
    To fix the regression in pseudo filesystems, convert d_delete() calls
    to d_drop() (see commit 46c46f8df9aa ("devpts_pty_kill(): don't bother
    with d_delete()") and move the fsnotify hook after d_drop().
    
    Add a missing fsnotify_unlink() hook in nfsdfs that was found during
    the audit of fsnotify hooks in pseudo filesystems.
    
    Note that the fsnotify hooks in simple_recursive_removal() follow
    d_invalidate(), so they require no change.

    fsnotify: invalidate dcache before IN_DELETE event
    
    commit a37d9a17f099072fe4d3a9048b0321978707a918 upstream.
    
    Apparently, there are some applications that use IN_DELETE event as an
    invalidation mechanism and expect that if they try to open a file with
    the name reported with the delete event, that it should not contain the
    content of the deleted file.
    
    Commit 49246466a989 ("fsnotify: move fsnotify_nameremove() hook out of
    d_delete()") moved the fsnotify delete hook before d_delete() so fsnotify
    will have access to a positive dentry.
    
    This allowed a race where opening the deleted file via cached dentry
    is now possible after receiving the IN_DELETE event.
    
    To fix the regression, create a new hook fsnotify_delete() that takes
    the unlinked inode as an argument and use a helper d_delete_notify() to
    pin the inode, so we can pass it to fsnotify_delete() after d_delete().
    
    Backporting hint: this regression is from v5.3. Although patch will
    apply with only trivial conflicts to v5.4 and v5.10, it won't build,
    because fsnotify_delete() implementation is different in each of those
    versions (see fsnotify_link()).
    
    A follow up patch will fix the fsnotify_unlink/rmdir() calls in pseudo
    filesystem that do not need to call d_delete().

    efi: runtime: avoid EFIv2 runtime services on Apple x86 machines
    
    commit f5390cd0b43c2e54c7cf5506c7da4a37c5cef746 upstream.
    
    Aditya reports [0] that his recent MacbookPro crashes in the firmware
    when using the variable services at runtime. The culprit appears to be a
    call to QueryVariableInfo(), which we did not use to call on Apple x86
    machines in the past as they only upgraded from EFI v1.10 to EFI v2.40
    firmware fairly recently, and QueryVariableInfo() (along with
    UpdateCapsule() et al) was added in EFI v2.00.
    
    The only runtime service introduced in EFI v2.00 that we actually use in
    Linux is QueryVariableInfo(), as the capsule based ones are optional,
    generally not used at runtime (all the LVFS/fwupd firmware update
    infrastructure uses helper EFI programs that invoke capsule update at
    boot time, not runtime), and not implemented by Apple machines in the
    first place. QueryVariableInfo() is used to 'safely' set variables,
    i.e., only when there is enough space. This prevents machines with buggy
    firmwares from corrupting their NVRAMs when they run out of space.
    
    Given that Apple machines have been using EFI v1.10 services only for
    the longest time (the EFI v2.0 spec was released in 2006, and Linux
    support for the newly introduced runtime services was added in 2011, but
    the MacbookPro12,1 released in 2015 still claims to be EFI v1.10 only),
    let's avoid the EFI v2.0 ones on all Apple x86 machines.

    commit 7fc3b7c2981bbd1047916ade327beccb90994eee upstream.
    
    udf_expand_file_adinicb() calls directly ->writepage to write data
    expanded into a page. This however misses to setup inode for writeback
    properly and so we can crash on inode->i_wb dereference when submitting
    page for IO like:
    
      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000158

    Fix the problem by marking the page dirty and going through the standard

    have to write the page but we want to catch e.g. ENOSPC errors early.

    scsi: zfcp: Fix failed recovery on gone remote port with non-NPIV FCP devices
    
    commit 8c9db6679be4348b8aae108e11d4be2f83976e30 upstream.
    
    Suppose we have an environment with a number of non-NPIV FCP devices
    (virtual HBAs / FCP devices / zfcp "adapter"s) sharing the same physical
    FCP channel (HBA port) and its I_T nexus. Plus a number of storage target
    ports zoned to such shared channel. Now one target port logs out of the
    fabric causing an RSCN. Zfcp reacts with an ADISC ELS and subsequent port
    recovery depending on the ADISC result. This happens on all such FCP
    devices (in different Linux images) concurrently as they all receive a copy
    of this RSCN. In the following we look at one of those FCP devices.
    
    Requests other than FSF_QTCB_FCP_CMND can be slow until they get a
    response.
    
    Depending on which requests are affected by slow responses, there are
    different recovery outcomes. Here we want to fix failed recoveries on port
    or adapter level by avoiding recovery requests that can be slow.
    
    We need the cached N_Port_ID for the remote port "link" test with ADISC.
    Just before sending the ADISC, we now intentionally forget the old cached
    N_Port_ID. The idea is that on receiving an RSCN for a port, we have to
    assume that any cached information about this port is stale.  This forces a
    fresh new GID_PN [FC-GS] nameserver lookup on any subsequent recovery for
    the same port. Since we typically can still communicate with the nameserver
    efficiently, we now reach steady state quicker: Either the nameserver still
    does not know about the port so we stop recovery, or the nameserver already
    knows the port potentially with a new N_Port_ID and we can successfully and
    quickly perform open port recovery.  For the one case, where ADISC returns
    successfully, we re-initialize port->d_id because that case does not
    involve any port recovery.
    
    This also solves a problem if the storage WWPN quickly logs into the fabric
    again but with a different N_Port_ID. Such as on virtual WWPN takeover
    during target NPIV failover.
    [https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp5477.html] In that case the
    RSCN from the storage FDISC was ignored by zfcp and we could not
    successfully recover the failover. On some later failback on the storage,
    we could have been lucky if the virtual WWPN got the same old N_Port_ID
    from the SAN switch as we still had cached.  Then the related RSCN
    triggered a successful port reopen recovery.  However, there is no
    guarantee to get the same N_Port_ID on NPIV FDISC.
    
    Even though NPIV-enabled FCP devices are not affected by this problem, this
    code change optimizes recovery time for gone remote ports as a side effect.
    The timely drop of cached N_Port_IDs prevents unnecessary slow open port
    attempts.
    
    While the problem might have been in code before v2.6.32 commit
    799b76d09aee ("[SCSI] zfcp: Decouple gid_pn requests from erp") this fix
    depends on the gid_pn_work introduced with that commit, so we mark it as
    culprit to satisfy fix dependencies.
    
    Note: Point-to-point remote port is already handled separately and gets its

    ucount: Make get_ucount a safe get_user replacement
    
    commit f9d87929d451d3e649699d0f1d74f71f77ad38f5 upstream.
    
    When the ucount code was refactored to create get_ucount it was missed
    that some of the contexts in which a rlimit is kept elevated can be
    the only reference to the user/ucount in the system.
    
    Ordinary ucount references exist in places that also have a reference
    to the user namspace, but in POSIX message queues, the SysV shm code,
    and the SIGPENDING code there is no independent user namespace
    reference.
    
    Inspection of the the user_namespace show no instance of circular
    references between struct ucounts and the user_namespace.  So
    hold a reference from struct ucount to i's user_namespace to
    resolve this problem.

    commit f094a39c6ba168f2df1edfd1731cca377af5f442 upstream.
    
    The machine check validity bit tells about the context. If a KVM guest
    was running the bit tells about the guest validity and the host state is

    machine check validity bits reflect the state of the machine check. If a
    guest does not make use of guarded storage, the validity bit might be
    off. We can not use the host CR bit to decide if the validity bit must
    be on. So ignore "invalid" guarded storage controls for KVM guests in
    the host and rely on the machine check being forwarded to the guest.  If
    no other errors happen from a host perspective everything is fine and no
    process must be killed and the host can continue to run.

    KVM: arm64: Use shadow SPSR_EL1 when injecting exceptions on !VHE
    
    commit 278583055a237270fac70518275ba877bf9e4013 upstream.
    
    Injecting an exception into a guest with non-VHE is risky business.
    Instead of writing in the shadow register for the switch code to
    restore it, we override the CPU register instead. Which gets
    overriden a few instructions later by said restore code.
    
    The result is that although the guest correctly gets the exception,
    it will return to the original context in some random state,
    depending on what was there the first place... Boo.
    
    Fix the issue by writing to the shadow register. The original code
    is absolutely fine on VHE, as the state is already loaded, and writing
    to the shadow register in that case would actually be a bug.

    ARM: 9180/1: Thumb2: align ALT_UP() sections in modules sufficiently
    
    commit 9f80ccda53b9417236945bc7ece4b519037df74d upstream.
    
    When building for Thumb2, the .alt.smp.init sections that are emitted by
    the ALT_UP() patching code may not be 32-bit aligned, even though the
    fixup_smp_on_up() routine expects that. This results in alignment faults
    at module load time, which need to be fixed up by the fault handler.
    
    So let's align those sections explicitly, and prevent this from occurring.

    commit 15420269b02a63ed8c1841905d8b8b2403246004 upstream.
    
    The helpers that are used to implement copy_from_kernel_nofault() and

    Only configurations that define CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS=y
    are affected, given that commit 2423de2e6f4d ("ARM: 9115/1: mm/maccess:
    fix unaligned copy_{from,to}_kernel_nofault") ensures that dst and src
    are sufficiently aligned otherwise.

    can: m_can: m_can_fifo_{read,write}: don't read or write from/to FIFO if length is 0
    
    commit db72589c49fd260bfc99c7160c079675bc7417af upstream.
    
    In order to optimize FIFO access, especially on m_can cores attached
    to slow busses like SPI, in patch
    
    | e39381770ec9 ("can: m_can: Disable IRQs on FIFO bus errors")
    
    bulk read/write support has been added to the m_can_fifo_{read,write}
    functions.
    
    That change leads to the tcan driver to call
    regmap_bulk_{read,write}() with a length of 0 (for CAN frames with 0
    data length). regmap treats this as an error:
    
    | tcan4x5x spi1.0 tcan4x5x0: FIFO write returned -22
    
    This patch fixes the problem by not calling the
    cdev->ops->{read,write)_fifo() in case of a 0 length read/write.

    btrfs: update writeback index when starting defrag
    
    commit 27cdfde181bcacd226c230b2fd831f6f5b8c215f upstream.
    
    When starting a defrag, we should update the writeback index of the
    inode's mapping in case it currently has a value beyond the start of the
    range we are defragging. This can help performance and often result in
    getting less extents after writeback - for e.g., if the current value
    of the writeback index sits somewhere in the middle of a range that
    gets dirty by the defrag, then after writeback we can get two smaller
    extents instead of a single, larger extent.
    
    We used to have this before the refactoring in 5.16, but it was removed
    without any reason to do so. Originally it was added in kernel 3.1, by
    commit 2a0f7f5769992b ("Btrfs: fix recursive auto-defrag"), in order to
    fix a loop with autodefrag resulting in dirtying and writing pages over
    and over, but some testing on current code did not show that happening,
    at least with the test described in that commit.
    
    So add back the behaviour, as at the very least it is a nice to have
    optimization.

    btrfs: add back missing dirty page rate limiting to defrag
    
    commit 3c9d31c715948aaff0ee6d322a91a2dec07770bf upstream.
    
    A defrag operation can dirty a lot of pages, specially if operating on
    the entire file or a large file range. Any task dirtying pages should
    periodically call balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited(), as stated in that
    function's comments, otherwise they can leave too many dirty pages in
    the system. This is what we did before the refactoring in 5.16, and
    it should have remained, just like in the buffered write path and
    relocation. So restore that behaviour.

    btrfs: fix deadlock when reserving space during defrag
    
    commit 0cb5950f3f3b51a4e8657d106f897f2b913e0586 upstream.
    
    When defragging we can end up collecting a range for defrag that has
    already pages under delalloc (dirty), as long as the respective extent
    map for their range is not mapped to a hole, a prealloc extent or
    the extent map is from an old generation.
    
    Most of the time that is harmless from a functional perspective at
    least, however it can result in a deadlock:
    
    1) At defrag_collect_targets() we find an extent map that meets all
       requirements but there's delalloc for the range it covers, and we add
       its range to list of ranges to defrag;
    
    2) The defrag_collect_targets() function is called at defrag_one_range(),
       after it locked a range that overlaps the range of the extent map;
    
    3) At defrag_one_range(), while the range is still locked, we call
       defrag_one_locked_target() for the range associated to the extent
       map we collected at step 1);
    
    4) Then finally at defrag_one_locked_target() we do a call to
       btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space(), which will reserve data and metadata
       space. If the space reservations can not be satisfied right away, the
       flusher might be kicked in and start flushing delalloc and wait for
       the respective ordered extents to complete. If this happens we will
       deadlock, because both flushing delalloc and finishing an ordered
       extent, requires locking the range in the inode's io tree, which was
       already locked at defrag_collect_targets().
    
    So fix this by skipping extent maps for which there's already delalloc.

    btrfs: defrag: properly update range->start for autodefrag
    
    commit c080b4144b9dd3b7af838a194ffad3204ca15166 upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    After commit 7b508037d4ca ("btrfs: defrag: use defrag_one_cluster() to
    implement btrfs_defrag_file()") autodefrag no longer properly re-defrag
    the file from previously finished location.
    
    [CAUSE]
    The recent refactoring of defrag only focuses on defrag ioctl subpage
    support, doesn't take autodefrag into consideration.
    
    There are two problems involved which prevents autodefrag to restart its
    scan:
    
    - No range.start update
      Previously when one defrag target is found, range->start will be
      updated to indicate where next search should start from.
    
      But now btrfs_defrag_file() doesn't update it anymore, making all
      autodefrag to rescan from file offset 0.
    
      This would also make autodefrag to mark the same range dirty again and
      again, causing extra IO.
    
    - No proper quick exit for defrag_one_cluster()
      Currently if we reached or exceed @max_sectors limit, we just exit
      defrag_one_cluster(), and let next defrag_one_cluster() call to do a
      quick exit.
      This makes @cur increase, thus no way to properly know which range is
      defragged and which range is skipped.
    
    [FIX]
    The fix involves two modifications:
    
    - Update range->start to next cluster start
      This is a little different from the old behavior.
      Previously range->start is updated to the next defrag target.
    
      But in the end, the behavior should still be pretty much the same,
      as now we skip to next defrag target inside btrfs_defrag_file().
    
      Thus if auto-defrag determines to re-scan, then we still do the skip,
      just at a different timing.
    
    - Make defrag_one_cluster() to return >0 to indicate a quick exit
      So that btrfs_defrag_file() can also do a quick exit, without
      increasing @cur to the range end, and re-use @cur to update
      @range->start.
    
    - Add comment for btrfs_defrag_file() to mention the range->start update
      Currently only autodefrag utilize this behavior, as defrag ioctl won't
      set @max_to_defrag parameter, thus unless interrupted it will always
      try to defrag the whole range.

    btrfs: defrag: fix wrong number of defragged sectors
    
    commit 484167da77739a8d0e225008c48e697fd3f781ae upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    There are users using autodefrag mount option reporting obvious increase
    in IO:
    
    > If I compare the write average (in total, I don't have it per process)
    > when taking idle periods on the same machine:
    >     Linux 5.16:
    >         without autodefrag: ~ 10KiB/s
    >         with autodefrag: between 1 and 2MiB/s.
    >
    >     Linux 5.15:
    >         with autodefrag:~ 10KiB/s (around the same as without
    > autodefrag on 5.16)
    
    [CAUSE]
    When autodefrag mount option is enabled, btrfs_defrag_file() will be
    called with @max_sectors = BTRFS_DEFRAG_BATCH (1024) to limit how many
    sectors we can defrag in one try.
    
    And then use the number of sectors defragged to determine if we need to
    re-defrag.
    
    But commit b18c3ab2343d ("btrfs: defrag: introduce helper to defrag one
    cluster") uses wrong unit to increase @sectors_defragged, which should
    be in unit of sector, not byte.
    
    This means, if we have defragged any sector, then @sectors_defragged
    will be >= sectorsize (normally 4096), which is larger than
    BTRFS_DEFRAG_BATCH.
    
    This makes the @max_sectors check in defrag_one_cluster() to underflow,
    rendering the whole @max_sectors check useless.
    
    Thus causing way more IO for autodefrag mount options, as now there is
    no limit on how many sectors can really be defragged.
    
    [FIX]
    Fix the problems by:
    
    - Use sector as unit when increasing @sectors_defragged
    
    - Include @sectors_defragged > @max_sectors case to break the loop
    
    - Add extra comment on the return value of btrfs_defrag_file()

    btrfs: allow defrag to be interruptible
    
    commit b767c2fc787e992daeadfff40d61c05f66c82da0 upstream.
    
    During defrag, at btrfs_defrag_file(), we have this loop that iterates
    over a file range in steps no larger than 256K subranges. If the range
    is too long, there's no way to interrupt it. So make the loop check in
    each iteration if there's signal pending, and if there is, break and
    return -AGAIN to userspace.
    
    Before kernel 5.16, we used to allow defrag to be cancelled through a
    signal, but that was lost with commit 7b508037d4cac3 ("btrfs: defrag:
    use defrag_one_cluster() to implement btrfs_defrag_file()").
    
    This change adds back the possibility to cancel a defrag with a signal
    and keeps the same semantics, returning -EAGAIN to user space (and not
    the usually more expected -EINTR).
    
    This is also motivated by a recent bug on 5.16 where defragging a 1 byte
    file resulted in iterating from file range 0 to (u64)-1, as hitting the
    bug triggered a too long loop, basically requiring one to reboot the
    machine, as it was not possible to cancel defrag.

    btrfs: fix too long loop when defragging a 1 byte file
    
    commit 6b34cd8e175bfbf4f3f01b6d19eae18245e1a8cc upstream.
    
    When attempting to defrag a file with a single byte, we can end up in a
    too long loop, which is nearly infinite because at btrfs_defrag_file()
    we end up with the variable last_byte assigned with a value of
    18446744073709551615 (which is (u64)-1). The problem comes from the fact
    we end up doing:
    
        last_byte = round_up(last_byte, fs_info->sectorsize) - 1;
    
    So if last_byte was assigned 0, which is i_size - 1, we underflow and
    end up with the value 18446744073709551615.
    
    This is trivial to reproduce and the following script triggers it:
    
      $ cat test.sh
      #!/bin/bash
    
      DEV=/dev/sdj
      MNT=/mnt/sdj
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
      mount $DEV $MNT
    
      echo -n "X" > $MNT/foobar
    
      btrfs filesystem defragment $MNT/foobar
    
      umount $MNT
    
    So fix this by not decrementing last_byte by 1 before doing the sector
    size round up. Also, to make it easier to follow, make the round up right
    after computing last_byte.
