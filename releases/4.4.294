    serial: pl011: Add ACPI SBSA UART match id
    
    commit ac442a077acf9a6bf1db4320ec0c3f303be092b3 upstream.
    
    The document 'ACPI for Arm Components 1.0' defines the following
    _HID mappings:
    -'Prime cell UART (PL011)': ARMH0011
    -'SBSA UART': ARMHB000
    
    Use the sbsa-uart driver when a device is described with
    the 'ARMHB000' _HID.
    
    Note:
    PL011 devices currently use the sbsa-uart driver instead of the
    uart-pl011 driver. Indeed, PL011 devices are not bound to a clock
    in ACPI. It is not possible to change their baudrate.

    tty: serial: msm_serial: Deactivate RX DMA for polling support
    
    commit 7492ffc90fa126afb67d4392d56cb4134780194a upstream.
    
    The CONSOLE_POLLING mode is used for tools like k(g)db. In this kind of
    setup, it is often sharing a serial device with the normal system console.
    This is usually no problem because the polling helpers can consume input
    values directly (when in kgdb context) and the normal Linux handlers can
    only consume new input values after kgdb switched back.
    
    This is not true anymore when RX DMA is enabled for UARTDM controllers.
    Single input values can no longer be received correctly. Instead following
    seems to happen:
    
    * on 1. input, some old input is read (continuously)
    * on 2. input, two old inputs are read (continuously)
    * on 3. input, three old input values are read (continuously)
    * on 4. input, 4 previous inputs are received
    
    This repeats then for each group of 4 input values.
    
    This behavior changes slightly depending on what state the controller was
    when the first input was received. But this makes working with kgdb
    basically impossible because control messages are always corrupted when
    kgdboc tries to parse them.
    
    RX DMA should therefore be off when CONSOLE_POLLING is enabled to avoid
    these kind of problems. No such problem was noticed for TX DMA.

    vgacon: Propagate console boot parameters before calling `vc_resize'
    
    commit 3dfac26e2ef29ff2abc2a75aa4cd48fce25a2c4b upstream.
    
    Fix a division by zero in `vgacon_resize' with a backtrace like:
    
    vgacon_resize
    vc_do_resize
    vgacon_init
    do_bind_con_driver
    do_unbind_con_driver
    fbcon_fb_unbind
    do_unregister_framebuffer
    do_register_framebuffer
    register_framebuffer
    __drm_fb_helper_initial_config_and_unlock
    drm_helper_hpd_irq_event
    dw_hdmi_irq
    irq_thread
    kthread
    
    caused by `c->vc_cell_height' not having been initialized.  This has
    only started to trigger with commit 860dafa90259 ("vt: Fix character
    height handling with VT_RESIZEX"), however the ultimate offender is
    commit 50ec42edd978 ("[PATCH] Detaching fbcon: fix vgacon to allow
    retaking of the console").
    
    Said commit has added a call to `vc_resize' whenever `vgacon_init' is
    called with the `init' argument set to 0, which did not happen before.
    And the call is made before a key vgacon boot parameter retrieved in
    `vgacon_startup' has been propagated in `vgacon_init' for `vc_resize' to
    use to the console structure being worked on.  Previously the parameter
    was `c->vc_font.height' and now it is `c->vc_cell_height'.
    
    In this particular scenario the registration of fbcon has failed and vt
    resorts to vgacon.  Now fbcon does have initialized `c->vc_font.height'
    somehow, unlike `c->vc_cell_height', which is why this code did not
    crash before, but either way the boot parameters should have been copied
    to the console structure ahead of the call to `vc_resize' rather than
    afterwards, so that first the call has a chance to use them and second
    they do not change the console structure to something possibly different
    from what was used by `vc_resize'.
    
    Move the propagation of the vgacon boot parameters ahead of the call to
    `vc_resize' then.  Adjust the comment accordingly.

    siphash: use _unaligned version by default
    
    commit f7e5b9bfa6c8820407b64eabc1f29c9a87e8993d upstream.
    
    On ARM v6 and later, we define CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
    because the ordinary load/store instructions (ldr, ldrh, ldrb) can
    tolerate any misalignment of the memory address. However, load/store
    double and load/store multiple instructions (ldrd, ldm) may still only
    be used on memory addresses that are 32-bit aligned, and so we have to
    use the CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS macro with care, or we
    may end up with a severe performance hit due to alignment traps that
    require fixups by the kernel. Testing shows that this currently happens
    with clang-13 but not gcc-11. In theory, any compiler version can
    produce this bug or other problems, as we are dealing with undefined
    behavior in C99 even on architectures that support this in hardware,
    see also https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100363.
    
    Fortunately, the get_unaligned() accessors do the right thing: when
    building for ARMv6 or later, the compiler will emit unaligned accesses
    using the ordinary load/store instructions (but avoid the ones that
    require 32-bit alignment). When building for older ARM, those accessors
    will emit the appropriate sequence of ldrb/mov/orr instructions. And on
    architectures that can truly tolerate any kind of misalignment, the
    get_unaligned() accessors resolve to the leXX_to_cpup accessors that
    operate on aligned addresses.
    
    Since the compiler will in fact emit ldrd or ldm instructions when
    building this code for ARM v6 or later, the solution is to use the
    unaligned accessors unconditionally on architectures where this is
    known to be fast. The _aligned version of the hash function is
    however still needed to get the best performance on architectures
    that cannot do any unaligned access in hardware.
    
    This new version avoids the undefined behavior and should produce
    the fastest hash on all architectures we support.

    net: qlogic: qlcnic: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings()
    
    commit e2dabc4f7e7b60299c20a36d6a7b24ed9bf8e572 upstream.
    
    In qlcnic_83xx_add_rings(), the indirect function of
    ahw->hw_ops->alloc_mbx_args will be called to allocate memory for
    cmd.req.arg, and there is a dereference of it in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings(),
    which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of the
    indirect function like qlcnic_83xx_alloc_mbx_args().
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of alloc_mbx_args(), this patch
    imitates the logic of mbx_cmd()'s failure handling.
    
    This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
    differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
    (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
    inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
    the callers, so they constitute bugs.
    
    Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
    positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
    the bug.
    
    Builds with CONFIG_QLCNIC=m show no new warnings, and our
    static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

    fget: check that the fd still exists after getting a ref to it
    
    commit 054aa8d439b9185d4f5eb9a90282d1ce74772969 upstream.
    
    Jann Horn points out that there is another possible race wrt Unix domain
    socket garbage collection, somewhat reminiscent of the one fixed in
    commit cbcf01128d0a ("af_unix: fix garbage collect vs MSG_PEEK").
    
    See the extended comment about the garbage collection requirements added
    to unix_peek_fds() by that commit for details.
    
    The race comes from how we can locklessly look up a file descriptor just
    as it is in the process of being closed, and with the right artificial
    timing (Jann added a few strategic 'mdelay(500)' calls to do that), the
    Unix domain socket garbage collector could see the reference count
    decrement of the close() happen before fget() took its reference to the
    file and the file was attached onto a new file descriptor.
    
    This is all (intentionally) correct on the 'struct file *' side, with
    RCU lookups and lockless reference counting very much part of the
    design.  Getting that reference count out of order isn't a problem per
    se.
    
    But the garbage collector can get confused by seeing this situation of
    having seen a file not having any remaining external references and then
    seeing it being attached to an fd.
    
    In commit cbcf01128d0a ("af_unix: fix garbage collect vs MSG_PEEK") the
    fix was to serialize the file descriptor install with the garbage
    collector by taking and releasing the unix_gc_lock.
    
    That's not really an option here, but since this all happens when we are
    in the process of looking up a file descriptor, we can instead simply
    just re-check that the file hasn't been closed in the meantime, and just
    re-do the lookup if we raced with a concurrent close() of the same file
    descriptor.

    commit 091141a42e15fe47ada737f3996b317072afcefb upstream.
    
    Some uses cases repeatedly get and put references to the same file, but
    the only exposed interface is doing these one at the time. As each of
    these entail an atomic inc or dec on a shared structure, that cost can
    add up.
    
    Add fget_many(), which works just like fget(), except it takes an
    argument for how many references to get on the file. Ditto fput_many(),
    which can drop an arbitrary number of references to a file.

    The driver creates the mapping by calling irq_of_parse_and_map(),
    so it also has to dispose the mapping. But the easy way out is to
    simply use platform_get_irq() instead of irq_of_parse_map(). Also
    we should adapt return value checking and propagate error values.
    
    In this case the mapping is not managed by the device but by
    the of core, so the device has not to dispose the mapping.

    The iounmap(host_priv->hcr_base) and kfree(host_priv) functions should
    not be executed in drv->remove. These functions should be executed in
    host_stop after port_stop. Therefore, we move these functions to the

    kprobes: Limit max data_size of the kretprobe instances
    
    commit 6bbfa44116689469267f1a6e3d233b52114139d2 upstream.
    
    The 'kprobe::data_size' is unsigned, thus it can not be negative.  But if
    user sets it enough big number (e.g. (size_t)-8), the result of 'data_size
    + sizeof(struct kretprobe_instance)' becomes smaller than sizeof(struct
    kretprobe_instance) or zero. In result, the kretprobe_instance are
    allocated without enough memory, and kretprobe accesses outside of
    allocated memory.
    
    To avoid this issue, introduce a max limitation of the
    kretprobe::data_size. 4KB per instance should be OK.

    net: ethernet: dec: tulip: de4x5: fix possible array overflows in type3_infoblock()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fa68da72c3be09e06dd833258ee89c33374195f ]
    
    The definition of macro MOTO_SROM_BUG is:
      #define MOTO_SROM_BUG    (lp->active == 8 && (get_unaligned_le32(
      dev->dev_addr) & 0x00ffffff) == 0x3e0008)
    
    and the if statement
      if (MOTO_SROM_BUG) lp->active = 0;
    
    using this macro indicates lp->active could be 8. If lp->active is 8 and
    the second comparison of this macro is false. lp->active will remain 8 in:
      lp->phy[lp->active].gep = (*p ? p : NULL); p += (2 * (*p) + 1);
      lp->phy[lp->active].rst = (*p ? p : NULL); p += (2 * (*p) + 1);
      lp->phy[lp->active].mc  = get_unaligned_le16(p); p += 2;
      lp->phy[lp->active].ana = get_unaligned_le16(p); p += 2;
      lp->phy[lp->active].fdx = get_unaligned_le16(p); p += 2;
      lp->phy[lp->active].ttm = get_unaligned_le16(p); p += 2;
      lp->phy[lp->active].mci = *p;
    
    However, the length of array lp->phy is 8, so array overflows can occur.
    To fix these possible array overflows, we first check lp->active and then
    return -EINVAL if it is greater or equal to ARRAY_SIZE(lp->phy) (i.e. 8).

    scsi: iscsi: Unblock session then wake up error handler
    
    [ Upstream commit a0c2f8b6709a9a4af175497ca65f93804f57b248 ]
    
    We can race where iscsi_session_recovery_timedout() has woken up the error
    handler thread and it's now setting the devices to offline, and
    session_recovery_timedout()'s call to scsi_target_unblock() is also trying
    to set the device's state to transport-offline. We can then get a mix of
    states.
    
    For the case where we can't relogin we want the devices to be in
    transport-offline so when we have repaired the connection
    __iscsi_unblock_session() can set the state back to running.
    
    Set the device state then call into libiscsi to wake up the error handler.

    s390/setup: avoid using memblock_enforce_memory_limit
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dbc4cb4667457b0c53bcd7bff11500b3c362975 ]
    
    There is a difference in how architectures treat "mem=" option. For some
    that is an amount of online memory, for s390 and x86 this is the limiting
    max address. Some memblock api like memblock_enforce_memory_limit()
    take limit argument and explicitly treat it as the size of online memory,
    and use __find_max_addr to convert it to an actual max address. Current
    s390 usage:
    
    memblock_enforce_memory_limit(memblock_end_of_DRAM());
    
    yields different results depending on presence of memory holes (offline
    memory blocks in between online memory). If there are no memory holes
    limit == max_addr in memblock_enforce_memory_limit() and it does trim
    online memory and reserved memory regions. With memory holes present it
    actually does nothing.
    
    Since we already use memblock_remove() explicitly to trim online memory
    regions to potential limit (think mem=, kdump, addressing limits, etc.)
    drop the usage of memblock_enforce_memory_limit() altogether. Trimming
    reserved regions should not be required, since we now use
    memblock_set_current_limit() to limit allocations and any explicit memory
    reservations above the limit is an actual problem we should not hide.

    platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Fix WWAN device disabled issue after S3 deep
    
    [ Upstream commit 39f53292181081d35174a581a98441de5da22bc9 ]
    
    When WWAN device wake from S3 deep, under thinkpad platform,
    WWAN would be disabled. This disable status could be checked
    by command 'nmcli r wwan' or 'rfkill list'.
    
    Issue analysis as below:
      When host resume from S3 deep, thinkpad_acpi driver would
    call hotkey_resume() function. Finnaly, it will use
    wan_get_status to check the current status of WWAN device.
    During this resume progress, wan_get_status would always
    return off even WWAN boot up completely.
      In patch V2, Hans said 'sw_state should be unchanged
    after a suspend/resume. It's better to drop the
    tpacpi_rfk_update_swstate call all together from the
    resume path'.
      And it's confimed by Lenovo that GWAN is no longer
     available from WHL generation because the design does not
     match with current pin control.

    issue with cache and tlb flushing.
    
    Use the routine adjust_range_if_pmd_sharing_possible() to calculate worst
    case ranges for mmu notifiers.  Ensure that this range is flushed if
    huge_pmd_unshare succeeds and unmaps a PUD_SUZE area.

    xen/netfront: don't trust the backend response data blindly
    
    commit a884daa61a7d91650987e855464526aef219590f upstream.
    
    Today netfront will trust the backend to send only sane response data.
    In order to avoid privilege escalations or crashes in case of malicious
    backends verify the data to be within expected limits. Especially make
    sure that the response always references an outstanding request.
    
    Note that only the tx queue needs special id handling, as for the rx
    queue the id is equal to the index in the ring page.
    
    Introduce a new indicator for the device whether it is broken and let
    the device stop working when it is set. Set this indicator in case the
    backend sets any weird data.

    xen/netfront: disentangle tx_skb_freelist
    
    commit 21631d2d741a64a073e167c27769e73bc7844a2f upstream.
    
    The tx_skb_freelist elements are in a single linked list with the
    request id used as link reference. The per element link field is in a
    union with the skb pointer of an in use request.
    
    Move the link reference out of the union in order to enable a later
    reuse of it for requests which need a populated skb pointer.
    
    Rename add_id_to_freelist() and get_id_from_freelist() to
    add_id_to_list() and get_id_from_list() in order to prepare using
    those for other lists as well. Define ~0 as value to indicate the end
    of a list and place that value into the link for a request not being
    on the list.
    
    When freeing a skb zero the skb pointer in the request. Use a NULL
    value of the skb pointer instead of skb_entry_is_link() for deciding
    whether a request has a skb linked to it.
    
    Remove skb_entry_set_link() and open code it instead as it is really
    trivial now.

    shm: extend forced shm destroy to support objects from several IPC nses
    
    commit 85b6d24646e4125c591639841169baa98a2da503 upstream.
    
    Currently, the exit_shm() function not designed to work properly when
    task->sysvshm.shm_clist holds shm objects from different IPC namespaces.
    
    This is a real pain when sysctl kernel.shm_rmid_forced = 1, because it
    leads to use-after-free (reproducer exists).
    
    This is an attempt to fix the problem by extending exit_shm mechanism to
    handle shm's destroy from several IPC ns'es.
    
    To achieve that we do several things:
    
    1. add a namespace (non-refcounted) pointer to the struct shmid_kernel
    
    2. during new shm object creation (newseg()/shmget syscall) we
       initialize this pointer by current task IPC ns
    
    3. exit_shm() fully reworked such that it traverses over all shp's in
       task->sysvshm.shm_clist and gets IPC namespace not from current task
       as it was before but from shp's object itself, then call
       shm_destroy(shp, ns).
    
    Note: We need to be really careful here, because as it was said before
    (1), our pointer to IPC ns non-refcnt'ed.  To be on the safe side we
    using special helper get_ipc_ns_not_zero() which allows to get IPC ns
    refcounter only if IPC ns not in the "state of destruction".
    
    Q/A
    
    Q: Why can we access shp->ns memory using non-refcounted pointer?
    A: Because shp object lifetime is always shorther than IPC namespace
       lifetime, so, if we get shp object from the task->sysvshm.shm_clist
       while holding task_lock(task) nobody can steal our namespace.
    
    Q: Does this patch change semantics of unshare/setns/clone syscalls?
    A: No. It's just fixes non-covered case when process may leave IPC
       namespace without getting task->sysvshm.shm_clist list cleaned up.

    fuse: release pipe buf after last use
    
    commit 473441720c8616dfaf4451f9c7ea14f0eb5e5d65 upstream.
    
    Checking buf->flags should be done before the pipe_buf_release() is called
    on the pipe buffer, since releasing the buffer might modify the flags.
    
    This is exactly what page_cache_pipe_buf_release() does, and which results
    in the same VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PageLRU(page)) that the original patch was
    trying to fix.

    fuse: fix page stealing
    
    commit 712a951025c0667ff00b25afc360f74e639dfabe upstream.
    
    It is possible to trigger a crash by splicing anon pipe bufs to the fuse
    device.
    
    The reason for this is that anon_pipe_buf_release() will reuse buf->page if
    the refcount is 1, but that page might have already been stolen and its
    flags modified (e.g. PG_lru added).
    
    This happens in the unlikely case of fuse_dev_splice_write() getting around
    to calling pipe_buf_release() after a page has been stolen, added to the
    page cache and removed from the page cache.
    
    Fix by calling pipe_buf_release() right after the page was inserted into
    the page cache.  In this case the page has an elevated refcount so any
    release function will know that the page isn't reusable.

    NFC: add NCI_UNREG flag to eliminate the race
    
    commit 48b71a9e66c2eab60564b1b1c85f4928ed04e406 upstream.
    
    There are two sites that calls queue_work() after the
    destroy_workqueue() and lead to possible UAF.
    
    The first site is nci_send_cmd(), which can happen after the
    nci_close_device as below
    
    nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev   |  nfc_genl_dev_up
      nci_close_device           |
        flush_workqueue          |
        del_timer_sync           |
      nci_unregister_device      |    nfc_get_device
        destroy_workqueue        |    nfc_dev_up
        nfc_unregister_device    |      nci_dev_up
          device_del             |        nci_open_device
                                 |          __nci_request
                                 |            nci_send_cmd
                                 |              queue_work !!!
    
    Another site is nci_cmd_timer, awaked by the nci_cmd_work from the
    nci_send_cmd.
    
      ...                        |  ...
      nci_unregister_device      |  queue_work
        destroy_workqueue        |
        nfc_unregister_device    |  ...
          device_del             |  nci_cmd_work
                                 |  mod_timer
                                 |  ...
                                 |  nci_cmd_timer
                                 |    queue_work !!!
    
    For the above two UAF, the root cause is that the nfc_dev_up can race
    between the nci_unregister_device routine. Therefore, this patch
    introduce NCI_UNREG flag to easily eliminate the possible race. In
    addition, the mutex_lock in nci_close_device can act as a barrier.

    proc/vmcore: fix clearing user buffer by properly using clear_user()
    
    commit c1e63117711977cc4295b2ce73de29dd17066c82 upstream.

    hugetlbfs: flush TLBs correctly after huge_pmd_unshare
    
    commit a4a118f2eead1d6c49e00765de89878288d4b890 upstream.
    
    When __unmap_hugepage_range() calls to huge_pmd_unshare() succeed, a TLB
    flush is missing.  This TLB flush must be performed before releasing the
    i_mmap_rwsem, in order to prevent an unshared PMDs page from being
    released and reused before the TLB flush took place.
    
    Arguably, a comprehensive solution would use mmu_gather interface to
    batch the TLB flushes and the PMDs page release, however it is not an
    easy solution: (1) try_to_unmap_one() and try_to_migrate_one() also call
    huge_pmd_unshare() and they cannot use the mmu_gather interface; and (2)
    deferring the release of the page reference for the PMDs page until
    after i_mmap_rwsem is dropeed can confuse huge_pmd_unshare() into
    thinking PMDs are shared when they are not.
    
    Fix __unmap_hugepage_range() by adding the missing TLB flush, and
    forcing a flush when unshare is successful.

    tcp_cubic: fix spurious Hystart ACK train detections for not-cwnd-limited flows
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e1fddc98d2585ddd4792b5e44433dcee7ece001 ]
    
    While testing BIG TCP patch series, I was expecting that TCP_RR workloads
    with 80KB requests/answers would send one 80KB TSO packet,
    then being received as a single GRO packet.
    
    It turns out this was not happening, and the root cause was that
    cubic Hystart ACK train was triggering after a few (2 or 3) rounds of RPC.
    
    Hystart was wrongly setting CWND/SSTHRESH to 30, while my RPC
    needed a budget of ~20 segments.
    
    Ideally these TCP_RR flows should not exit slow start.
    
    Cubic Hystart should reset itself at each round, instead of assuming
    every TCP flow is a bulk one.
    
    Note that even after this patch, Hystart can still trigger, depending
    on scheduling artifacts, but at a higher CWND/SSTHRESH threshold,
    keeping optimal TSO packet sizes.
    
    Tested:
    
    ip link set dev eth0 gro_ipv6_max_size 131072 gso_ipv6_max_size 131072
    nstat -n; netperf -H ... -t TCP_RR  -l 5  -- -r 80000,80000 -K cubic; nstat|egrep "Ip6InReceives|Hystart|Ip6OutRequests"
    
    Before:

    Ip6InReceives                   87541              0.0

    scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ee4ba13e09c9d9c1cb6abb59da8295d9952328b ]
    
    While looping over shost's sdev list it is possible that one
    of the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is
    freed but its sdev object remains intact.
    
    Consequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is trying to access
    the sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the
    sas_target object for NULL.

    ARM: socfpga: Fix crash with CONFIG_FORTIRY_SOURCE
    
    [ Upstream commit 187bea472600dcc8d2eb714335053264dd437172 ]
    
    When CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE is set, memcpy() checks the potential
    buffer overflow and panics.  The code in sofcpga bootstrapping
    contains the memcpy() calls are mistakenly translated as the shorter
    size, hence it triggers a panic as if it were overflowing.
    
    This patch changes the secondary_trampoline and *_end definitions
    to arrays for avoiding the false-positive crash above.

    The failure to retrieve post-op attributes has no bearing on whether or

    net: ieee802154: handle iftypes as u32
    
    [ Upstream commit 451dc48c806a7ce9fbec5e7a24ccf4b2c936e834 ]
    
    This patch fixes an issue that an u32 netlink value is handled as a
    signed enum value which doesn't fit into the range of u32 netlink type.
    If it's handled as -1 value some BIT() evaluation ends in a
    shift-out-of-bounds issue. To solve the issue we set the to u32 max which
    is s32 "-1" value to keep backwards compatibility and let the followed enum
    values start counting at 0. This brings the compiler to never handle the
    enum as signed and a check if the value is above NL802154_IFTYPE_MAX should
    filter -1 out.

    xen: detect uninitialized xenbus in xenbus_init
    
    commit 36e8f60f0867d3b70d398d653c17108459a04efe upstream.
    
    If the xenstore page hasn't been allocated properly, reading the value
    of the related hvm_param (HVM_PARAM_STORE_PFN) won't actually return
    error. Instead, it will succeed and return zero. Instead of attempting
    to xen_remap a bad guest physical address, detect this condition and
    return early.
    
    Note that although a guest physical address of zero for
    HVM_PARAM_STORE_PFN is theoretically possible, it is not a good choice
    and zero has never been validly used in that capacity.
    
    Also recognize all bits set as an invalid value.
    
    For 32-bit Linux, any pfn above ULONG_MAX would get truncated. Pfns
    above ULONG_MAX should never be passed by the Xen tools to HVM guests
    anyway, so check for this condition and return early.

    xen: don't continue xenstore initialization in case of errors
    
    commit 08f6c2b09ebd4b326dbe96d13f94fee8f9814c78 upstream.
    
    In case of errors in xenbus_init (e.g. missing xen_store_gfn parameter),
    we goto out_error but we forget to reset xen_store_domain_type to
    XS_UNKNOWN. As a consequence xenbus_probe_initcall and other initcalls
    will still try to initialize xenstore resulting into a crash at boot.

    ALSA: ctxfi: Fix out-of-range access
    
    commit 76c47183224c86e4011048b80f0e2d0d166f01c2 upstream.
    
    The master and next_conj of rcs_ops are used for iterating the
    resource list entries, and currently those are supposed to return the
    current value.  The problem is that next_conf may go over the last
    entry before the loop abort condition is evaluated, and it may return
    the "current" value that is beyond the array size.  It was caught
    recently as a GPF, for example.
    
    Those return values are, however, never actually evaluated, hence
    basically we don't have to consider the current value as the return at
    all.  By dropping those return values, the potential out-of-range
    access above is also fixed automatically.
    
    This patch changes the return type of master and next_conj callbacks
    to void and drop the superfluous code accordingly.

    usb: hub: Fix usb enumeration issue due to address0 race
    
    commit 6ae6dc22d2d1ce6aa77a6da8a761e61aca216f8b upstream.
    
    xHC hardware can only have one slot in default state with address 0
    waiting for a unique address at a time, otherwise "undefined behavior
    may occur" according to xhci spec 5.4.3.4
    
    The address0_mutex exists to prevent this across both xhci roothubs.
    
    If hub_port_init() fails, it may unlock the mutex and exit with a xhci
    slot in default state. If the other xhci roothub calls hub_port_init()
    at this point we end up with two slots in default state.
    
    Make sure the address0_mutex protects the slot default state across
    hub_port_init() retries, until slot is addressed or disabled.
    
    Note, one known minor case is not fixed by this patch.
    If device needs to be reset during resume, but fails all hub_port_init()
    retries in usb_reset_and_verify_device(), then it's possible the slot is
    still left in default state when address0_mutex is unlocked.
