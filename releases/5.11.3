    net_sched: fix RTNL deadlock again caused by request_module()
    
    commit d349f997686887906b1183b5be96933c5452362a upstream.
    
    tcf_action_init_1() loads tc action modules automatically with
    request_module() after parsing the tc action names, and it drops RTNL
    lock and re-holds it before and after request_module(). This causes a
    lot of troubles, as discovered by syzbot, because we can be in the
    middle of batch initializations when we create an array of tc actions.
    
    One of the problem is deadlock:
    
    CPU 0                                   CPU 1
    rtnl_lock();
    for (...) {
      tcf_action_init_1();
        -> rtnl_unlock();
        -> request_module();
                                    rtnl_lock();
                                    for (...) {
                                      tcf_action_init_1();
                                        -> tcf_idr_check_alloc();
                                       // Insert one action into idr,
                                       // but it is not committed until
                                       // tcf_idr_insert_many(), then drop
                                       // the RTNL lock in the _next_
                                       // iteration
                                       -> rtnl_unlock();
        -> rtnl_lock();
        -> a_o->init();
          -> tcf_idr_check_alloc();
          // Now waiting for the same index
          // to be committed
                                        -> request_module();
                                        -> rtnl_lock()
                                        // Now waiting for RTNL lock
                                    }
                                    rtnl_unlock();
    }
    rtnl_unlock();
    
    This is not easy to solve, we can move the request_module() before
    this loop and pre-load all the modules we need for this netlink
    message and then do the rest initializations. So the loop breaks down
    to two now:
    
            for (i = 1; i <= TCA_ACT_MAX_PRIO && tb[i]; i++) {
                    struct tc_action_ops *a_o;
    
                    a_o = tc_action_load_ops(name, tb[i]...);
                    ops[i - 1] = a_o;
            }
    
            for (i = 1; i <= TCA_ACT_MAX_PRIO && tb[i]; i++) {
                    act = tcf_action_init_1(ops[i - 1]...);
            }
    
    Although this looks serious, it only has been reported by syzbot, so it
    seems hard to trigger this by humans. And given the size of this patch,
    I'd suggest to make it to net-next and not to backport to stable.
    
    This patch has been tested by syzbot and tested with tdc.py by me.

    net: sched: fix police ext initialization
    
    commit 396d7f23adf9e8c436dd81a69488b5b6a865acf8 upstream.
    
    When police action is created by cls API tcf_exts_validate() first
    conditional that calls tcf_action_init_1() directly, the action idr is not
    updated according to latest changes in action API that require caller to
    commit newly created action to idr with tcf_idr_insert_many(). This results
    such action not being accessible through act API and causes crash reported
    by syzbot:

    wireguard: queueing: get rid of per-peer ring buffers
    
    commit 8b5553ace83cced775eefd0f3f18b5c6214ccf7a upstream.
    
    Having two ring buffers per-peer means that every peer results in two
    massive ring allocations. On an 8-core x86_64 machine, this commit
    reduces the per-peer allocation from 18,688 bytes to 1,856 bytes, which
    is an 90% reduction. Ninety percent! With some single-machine
    deployments approaching 500,000 peers, we're talking about a reduction
    from 7 gigs of memory down to 700 megs of memory.
    
    In order to get rid of these per-peer allocations, this commit switches
    to using a list-based queueing approach. Currently GSO fragments are
    chained together using the skb->next pointer (the skb_list_* singly
    linked list approach), so we form the per-peer queue around the unused
    skb->prev pointer (which sort of makes sense because the links are
    pointing backwards). Use of skb_queue_* is not possible here, because
    that is based on doubly linked lists and spinlocks. Multiple cores can
    write into the queue at any given time, because its writes occur in the
    start_xmit path or in the udp_recv path. But reads happen in a single
    workqueue item per-peer, amounting to a multi-producer, single-consumer
    paradigm.
    
    The MPSC queue is implemented locklessly and never blocks. However, it
    is not linearizable (though it is serializable), with a very tight and
    unlikely race on writes, which, when hit (some tiny fraction of the
    0.15% of partial adds on a fully loaded 16-core x86_64 system), causes
    the queue reader to terminate early. However, because every packet sent
    queues up the same workqueue item after it is fully added, the worker
    resumes again, and stopping early isn't actually a problem, since at
    that point the packet wouldn't have yet been added to the encryption
    queue. These properties allow us to avoid disabling interrupts or
    spinning. The design is based on Dmitry Vyukov's algorithm [1].
    
    Performance-wise, ordinarily list-based queues aren't preferable to
    ringbuffers, because of cache misses when following pointers around.
    However, we *already* have to follow the adjacent pointers when working
    through fragments, so there shouldn't actually be any change there. A
    potential downside is that dequeueing is a bit more complicated, but the
    ptr_ring structure used prior had a spinlock when dequeueing, so all and
    all the difference appears to be a wash.
    
    Actually, from profiling, the biggest performance hit, by far, of this
    commit winds up being atomic_add_unless(count, 1, max) and atomic_
    dec(count), which account for the majority of CPU time, according to
    perf. In that sense, the previous ring buffer was superior in that it
    could check if it was full by head==tail, which the list-based approach
    cannot do.
    
    But all and all, this enables us to get massive memory savings, allowing
    WireGuard to scale for real world deployments, without taking much of a
    performance hit.

    In order to test ndo_start_xmit being called in parallel, explicitly add
    separate tests, which should all run on different cores. This should
    help tease out bugs associated with queueing up packets from different
    cores in parallel. Currently, it hasn't found those types of bugs, but
    given future planned work, this is a useful regression to avoid.

    net: icmp: pass zeroed opts from icmp{,v6}_ndo_send before sending
    
    commit ee576c47db60432c37e54b1e2b43a8ca6d3a8dca upstream.
    
    The icmp{,v6}_send functions make all sorts of use of skb->cb, casting
    it with IPCB or IP6CB, assuming the skb to have come directly from the
    inet layer. But when the packet comes from the ndo layer, especially
    when forwarded, there's no telling what might be in skb->cb at that
    point. As a result, the icmp sending code risks reading bogus memory
    contents, which can result in nasty stack overflows such as this one
    reported by a user:
    
        panic+0x108/0x2ea

        icmp_ndo_send+0x148/0x160
    
    In icmp_send, skb->cb is cast with IPCB and an ip_options struct is read
    from it. The optlen parameter there is of particular note, as it can
    induce writes beyond bounds. There are quite a few ways that can happen
    in __ip_options_echo. For example:
    
        // sptr/skb are attacker-controlled skb bytes
        sptr = skb_network_header(skb);
        // dptr/dopt points to stack memory allocated by __icmp_send
        dptr = dopt->__data;
        // sopt is the corrupt skb->cb in question
        if (sopt->rr) {
            optlen  = sptr[sopt->rr+1]; // corrupt skb->cb + skb->data
            soffset = sptr[sopt->rr+2]; // corrupt skb->cb + skb->data
            // this now writes potentially attacker-controlled data, over
            // flowing the stack:
            memcpy(dptr, sptr+sopt->rr, optlen);
        }
    
    In the icmpv6_send case, the story is similar, but not as dire, as only
    IP6CB(skb)->iif and IP6CB(skb)->dsthao are used. The dsthao case is
    worse than the iif case, but it is passed to ipv6_find_tlv, which does
    a bit of bounds checking on the value.
    
    This is easy to simulate by doing a `memset(skb->cb, 0x41,
    sizeof(skb->cb));` before calling icmp{,v6}_ndo_send, and it's only by
    good fortune and the rarity of icmp sending from that context that we've
    avoided reports like this until now. For example, in KASAN:
    
        BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in __ip_options_echo+0xa0e/0x12b0
        Write of size 38 at addr ffff888006f1f80e by task ping/89

         __icmp_send+0x744/0x1700
    
    Actually, out of the 4 drivers that do this, only gtp zeroed the cb for
    the v4 case, while the rest did not. So this commit actually removes the
    gtp-specific zeroing, while putting the code where it belongs in the
    shared infrastructure of icmp{,v6}_ndo_send.
    
    This commit fixes the issue by passing an empty IPCB or IP6CB along to
    the functions that actually do the work. For the icmp_send, this was
    already trivial, thanks to __icmp_send providing the plumbing function.
    For icmpv6_send, this required a tiny bit of refactoring to make it
    behave like the v4 case, after which it was straight forward.

    dm era: only resize metadata in preresume
    
    commit cca2c6aebe86f68103a8615074b3578e854b5016 upstream.
    
    Metadata resize shouldn't happen in the ctr. The ctr loads a temporary
    (inactive) table that will only become active upon resume. That is why
    resize should always be done in terms of resume. Otherwise a load (ctr)
    whose inactive table never becomes active will incorrectly resize the
    metadata.
    
    Also, perform the resize directly in preresume, instead of using the
    worker to do it.
    
    The worker might run other metadata operations, e.g., it could start
    digestion, before resizing the metadata. These operations will end up
    using the old size.
    
    This could lead to errors, like:
    
      device-mapper: era: metadata_digest_transcribe_writeset: dm_array_set_value failed
      device-mapper: era: process_old_eras: digest step failed, stopping digestion
    
    The reason of the above error is that the worker started the digestion
    of the archived writeset using the old, larger size.
    
    As a result, metadata_digest_transcribe_writeset tried to write beyond
    the end of the era array.

    dm era: Reinitialize bitset cache before digesting a new writeset
    
    commit 2524933307fd0036d5c32357c693c021ab09a0b0 upstream.
    
    In case of devices with at most 64 blocks, the digestion of consecutive
    eras uses the writeset of the first era as the writeset of all eras to
    digest, leading to lost writes. That is, we lose the information about
    what blocks were written during the affected eras.
    
    The digestion code uses a dm_disk_bitset object to access the archived
    writesets. This structure includes a one word (64-bit) cache to reduce
    the number of array lookups.
    
    This structure is initialized only once, in metadata_digest_start(),
    when we kick off digestion.
    
    But, when we insert a new writeset into the writeset tree, before the
    digestion of the previous writeset is done, or equivalently when there
    are multiple writesets in the writeset tree to digest, then all these
    writesets are digested using the same cache and the cache is not
    re-initialized when moving from one writeset to the next.
    
    For devices with more than 64 blocks, i.e., the size of the cache, the
    cache is indirectly invalidated when we move to a next set of blocks, so
    we avoid the bug.
    
    But for devices with at most 64 blocks we end up using the same cached
    data for digesting all archived writesets, i.e., the cache is loaded
    when digesting the first writeset and it never gets reloaded, until the
    digestion is done.
    
    As a result, the writeset of the first era to digest is used as the
    writeset of all the following archived eras, leading to lost writes.
    
    Fix this by reinitializing the dm_disk_bitset structure, and thus
    invalidating the cache, every time the digestion code starts digesting a
    new writeset.

    dm era: Update in-core bitset after committing the metadata
    
    commit 2099b145d77c1d53f5711f029c37cc537897cee6 upstream.
    
    In case of a system crash, dm-era might fail to mark blocks as written
    in its metadata, although the corresponding writes to these blocks were
    passed down to the origin device and completed successfully.
    
    Consider the following sequence of events:
    
    1. We write to a block that has not been yet written in the current era
    2. era_map() checks the in-core bitmap for the current era and sees
       that the block is not marked as written.
    3. The write is deferred for submission after the metadata have been
       updated and committed.
    4. The worker thread processes the deferred write
       (process_deferred_bios()) and marks the block as written in the
       in-core bitmap, **before** committing the metadata.
    5. The worker thread starts committing the metadata.
    6. We do more writes that map to the same block as the write of step (1)
    7. era_map() checks the in-core bitmap and sees that the block is marked
       as written, **although the metadata have not been committed yet**.
    8. These writes are passed down to the origin device immediately and the
       device reports them as completed.
    9. The system crashes, e.g., power failure, before the commit from step
       (5) finishes.
    
    When the system recovers and we query the dm-era target for the list of
    written blocks it doesn't report the aforementioned block as written,
    although the writes of step (6) completed successfully.
    
    The issue is that era_map() decides whether to defer or not a write
    based on non committed information. The root cause of the bug is that we
    update the in-core bitmap, **before** committing the metadata.
    
    Fix this by updating the in-core bitmap **after** successfully
    committing the metadata.

    dm era: Recover committed writeset after crash
    
    commit de89afc1e40fdfa5f8b666e5d07c43d21a1d3be0 upstream.
    
    Following a system crash, dm-era fails to recover the committed writeset
    for the current era, leading to lost writes. That is, we lose the
    information about what blocks were written during the affected era.
    
    dm-era assumes that the writeset of the current era is archived when the
    device is suspended. So, when resuming the device, it just moves on to
    the next era, ignoring the committed writeset.
    
    This assumption holds when the device is properly shut down. But, when
    the system crashes, the code that suspends the target never runs, so the
    writeset for the current era is not archived.
    
    There are three issues that cause the committed writeset to get lost:
    
    1. dm-era doesn't load the committed writeset when opening the metadata
    2. The code that resizes the metadata wipes the information about the
       committed writeset (assuming it was loaded at step 1)
    3. era_preresume() starts a new era, without taking into account that
       the current era might not have been archived, due to a system crash.
    
    To fix this:
    
    1. Load the committed writeset when opening the metadata
    2. Fix the code that resizes the metadata to make sure it doesn't wipe
       the loaded writeset
    3. Fix era_preresume() to check for a loaded writeset and archive it,
       before starting a new era.

    dm table: fix iterate_devices based device capability checks
    
    commit a4c8dd9c2d0987cf542a2a0c42684c9c6d78a04e upstream.
    
    According to the definition of dm_iterate_devices_fn:
     * This function must iterate through each section of device used by the
     * target until it encounters a non-zero return code, which it then returns.
     * Returns zero if no callout returned non-zero.
    
    For some target type (e.g. dm-stripe), one call of iterate_devices() may
    iterate multiple underlying devices internally, in which case a non-zero
    return code returned by iterate_devices_callout_fn will stop the iteration
    in advance. No iterate_devices_callout_fn should return non-zero unless
    device iteration should stop.
    
    Rename dm_table_requires_stable_pages() to dm_table_any_dev_attr() and
    elevate it for reuse to stop iterating (and return non-zero) on the
    first device that causes iterate_devices_callout_fn to return non-zero.
    Use dm_table_any_dev_attr() to properly iterate through devices.
    
    Rename device_is_nonrot() to device_is_rotational() and invert logic
    accordingly to fix improper disposition.

    dm: fix deadlock when swapping to encrypted device
    
    commit a666e5c05e7c4aaabb2c5d58117b0946803d03d2 upstream.
    
    The system would deadlock when swapping to a dm-crypt device. The reason
    is that for each incoming write bio, dm-crypt allocates memory that holds
    encrypted data. These excessive allocations exhaust all the memory and the
    result is either deadlock or OOM trigger.
    
    This patch limits the number of in-flight swap bios, so that the memory
    consumed by dm-crypt is limited. The limit is enforced if the target set
    the "limit_swap_bios" variable and if the bio has REQ_SWAP set.
    
    Non-swap bios are not affected becuase taking the semaphore would cause
    performance degradation.
    
    This is similar to request-based drivers - they will also block when the
    number of requests is over the limit.

    gfs2: Recursive gfs2_quota_hold in gfs2_iomap_end
    
    commit 7009fa9cd9a5262944b30eb7efb1f0561d074b68 upstream.
    
    When starting an iomap write, gfs2_quota_lock_check -> gfs2_quota_lock
    -> gfs2_quota_hold is called from gfs2_iomap_begin.  At the end of the
    write, before unlocking the quotas, punch_hole -> gfs2_quota_hold can be
    called again in gfs2_iomap_end, which is incorrect and leads to a failed
    assertion.  Instead, move the call to gfs2_quota_unlock before the call
    to punch_hole to fix that.

    gfs2: Don't skip dlm unlock if glock has an lvb
    
    commit 78178ca844f0eb88f21f31c7fde969384be4c901 upstream.
    
    Patch fb6791d100d1 was designed to allow gfs2 to unmount quicker by
    skipping the step where it tells dlm to unlock glocks in EX with lvbs.
    This was done because when gfs2 unmounts a file system, it destroys the
    dlm lockspace shortly after it destroys the glocks so it doesn't need to
    unlock them all: the unlock is implied when the lockspace is destroyed
    by dlm.
    
    However, that patch introduced a use-after-free in dlm: as part of its
    normal dlm_recoverd process, it can call ls_recovery to recover dead
    locks. In so doing, it can call recover_rsbs which calls recover_lvb for
    any mastered rsbs. Func recover_lvb runs through the list of lkbs queued
    to the given rsb (if the glock is cached but unlocked, it will still be
    queued to the lkb, but in NL--Unlocked--mode) and if it has an lvb,
    copies it to the rsb, thus trying to preserve the lkb. However, when
    gfs2 skips the dlm unlock step, it frees the glock and its lvb, which
    means dlm's function recover_lvb references the now freed lvb pointer,
    copying the freed lvb memory to the rsb.
    
    This patch changes the check in gdlm_put_lock so that it calls
    dlm_unlock for all glocks that contain an lvb pointer.

    spi: fsl: invert spisel_boot signal on MPC8309
    
    commit 9d2aa6dbf87af89c13cac2d1b4cccad83fb14a7e upstream.
    
    Commit 7a2da5d7960a ("spi: fsl: Fix driver breakage when SPI_CS_HIGH
    is not set in spi->mode") broke our MPC8309 board by effectively
    inverting the boolean value passed to fsl_spi_cs_control. The
    SPISEL_BOOT signal is used as chipselect, but it's not a gpio, so
    we cannot rely on gpiolib handling the polarity.
    
    Adapt to the new world order by inverting the logic here. This does
    assume that the slave sitting at the SPISEL_BOOT is active low, but
    should that ever turn out not to be the case, one can create a stub
    gpiochip driver controlling a single gpio (or rather, a single "spo",
    special-purpose output).

    sparc32: fix a user-triggerable oops in clear_user()
    
    commit 7780918b36489f0b2f9a3749d7be00c2ceaec513 upstream.
    
    Back in 2.1.29 the clear_user() guts (__bzero()) had been merged
    with memset().  Unfortunately, while all exception handlers had been
    copied, one of the exception table entries got lost.  As the result,
    clear_user() starting at 128*n bytes before the end of page and
    spanning between 8 and 127 bytes into the next page would oops when
    the second page is unmapped.  It's trivial to reproduce - all
    it takes is
    
    main()
    {
            int fd = open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY);
            char *p = mmap(NULL, 16384, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                            MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON, -1, 0);
            munmap(p + 8192, 8192);
            read(fd, p + 8192 - 128, 192);
    }
    
    which had been oopsing since March 1997.  Says something about
    the quality of test coverage... ;-/  And while today sparc32 port
    is nearly dead, back in '97 it had been very much alive; in fact,
    sparc64 had only been in mainline for 3 months by that point...

    commit 5ff2836ed3a5c24420a7235be25a462594cdc4ea upstream.
    
    Some servers seem to mistakenly report different values for

    f2fs: enforce the immutable flag on open files
    
    commit e0fcd01510ad025c9bbce704c5c2579294056141 upstream.
    
    This patch ports commit 02b016ca7f99 ("ext4: enforce the immutable
    flag on open files") to f2fs.
    
    According to the chattr man page, "a file with the 'i' attribute
    cannot be modified..."  Historically, this was only enforced when the
    file was opened, per the rest of the description, "... and the file
    can not be opened in write mode".
    
    There is general agreement that we should standardize all file systems
    to prevent modifications even for files that were opened at the time
    the immutable flag is set.  Eventually, a change to enforce this at
    the VFS layer should be landing in mainline.

    irqchip/loongson-pch-msi: Use bitmap_zalloc() to allocate bitmap
    
    commit c1f664d2400e73d5ca0fcd067fa5847d2c789c11 upstream.
    
    Currently we use bitmap_alloc() to allocate msi bitmap which should be
    initialized with zero. This is obviously wrong but it works because msi
    can fallback to legacy interrupt mode. So use bitmap_zalloc() instead.

    um: defer killing userspace on page table update failures
    
    commit a7d48886cacf8b426e0079bca9639d2657cf2d38 upstream.
    
    In some cases we can get to fix_range_common() with mmap_sem held,
    and in others we get there without it being held. For example, we
    get there with it held from sys_mprotect(), and without it held
    from fork_handler().
    
    Avoid any issues in this and simply defer killing the task until
    it runs the next time. Do it on the mm so that another task that
    shares the same mm can't continue running afterwards.

    If userspace tries to change the stub, we need to kill it,
    because otherwise it can escape the virtual machine. In a
    few cases the stub checks weren't good, e.g. if userspace
    just tries to
    
            mmap(0x100000 - 0x1000, 0x3000, ...)
    
    it could succeed to get a new private/anonymous mapping
    replacing the stubs. Fix this by checking everywhere, and
    checking for _overlap_, not just direct changes.

    virtio/s390: implement virtio-ccw revision 2 correctly
    
    commit 182f709c5cff683e6732d04c78e328de0532284f upstream.
    
    CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS was introduced with revision 2 of virtio-ccw,
    and drivers should only rely on it being implemented when they
    negotiated at least that revision with the device.
    
    However, virtio_ccw_get_status() issued READ_STATUS for any
    device operating at least at revision 1. If the device accepts
    READ_STATUS regardless of the negotiated revision (which some
    implementations like QEMU do, even though the spec currently does
    not allow it), everything works as intended. While a device
    rejecting the command should also be handled gracefully, we will
    not be able to see any changes the device makes to the status,
    such as setting NEEDS_RESET or setting the status to zero after
    a completed reset.
    
    We negotiated the revision to at most 1, as we never bumped the
    maximum revision; let's do that now and properly send READ_STATUS
    only if we are operating at least at revision 2.

    s390/vtime: fix inline assembly clobber list
    
    commit b29c5093820d333eef22f58cd04ec0d089059c39 upstream.
    
    The stck/stckf instruction used within the inline assembly within
    do_account_vtime() changes the condition code. This is not reflected
    with the clobber list, and therefore might result in incorrect code
    generation.
    
    It seems unlikely that the compiler could generate incorrect code
    considering the surrounding C code, but it must still be fixed.

    cpufreq: intel_pstate: Get per-CPU max freq via MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES if available
    
    commit 6f67e060083a84a4cc364eab6ae40c717165fb0c upstream.
    
    Currently, when turbo is disabled (either by BIOS or by the user),
    the intel_pstate driver reads the max non-turbo frequency from the
    package-wide MSR_PLATFORM_INFO(0xce) register.
    
    However, on asymmetric platforms it is possible in theory that small
    and big core with HWP enabled might have different max non-turbo CPU
    frequency, because MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES is per-CPU scope according
    to Intel Software Developer Manual.
    
    The turbo max freq is already per-CPU in current code, so make
    similar change to the max non-turbo frequency as well.

    cpufreq: qcom-hw: drop devm_xxx() calls from init/exit hooks
    
    commit 67fc209b527d023db4d087c68e44e9790aa089ef upstream.
    
    Commit f17b3e44320b ("cpufreq: qcom-hw: Use
    devm_platform_ioremap_resource() to simplify code") introduces
    a regression on platforms using the driver, by failing to initialise
    a policy, when one is created post hotplug.
    
    When all the CPUs of a policy are hoptplugged out, the call to .exit()
    and later to devm_iounmap() does not release the memory region that was
    requested during devm_platform_ioremap_resource().  Therefore,
    a subsequent call to .init() will result in the following error, which
    will prevent a new policy to be initialised:
    
    [ 3395.915416] CPU4: shutdown
    [ 3395.938185] psci: CPU4 killed (polled 0 ms)

    With that being said, the original code was tricky and skipping memory
    region request intentionally to hide this issue.  The true cause is that
    those devm_xxx() device managed functions shouldn't be used for cpufreq
    init/exit hooks, because &pdev->dev is alive across the hooks and will
    not trigger auto resource free-up.  Let's drop the use of device managed
    functions and manually allocate/free resources, so that the issue can be
    fixed properly.

    thermal: cpufreq_cooling: freq_qos_update_request() returns < 0 on error
    
    commit a51afb13311cd85b2f638c691b2734622277d8f5 upstream.
    
    freq_qos_update_request() returns 1 if the effective constraint value
    has changed, 0 if the effective constraint value has not changed, or a
    negative error code on failures.
    
    The frequency constraints for CPUs can be set by different parts of the
    kernel. If the maximum frequency constraint set by other parts of the
    kernel are set at a lower value than the one corresponding to cooling
    state 0, then we will never be able to cool down the system as
    freq_qos_update_request() will keep on returning 0 and we will skip
    updating cpufreq_state and thermal pressure.
    
    Fix that by doing the updates even in the case where
    freq_qos_update_request() returns 0, as we have effectively set the
    constraint to a new value even if the consolidated value of the
    actual constraint is unchanged because of external factors.

    kcmp: Support selection of SYS_kcmp without CHECKPOINT_RESTORE
    
    commit bfe3911a91047557eb0e620f95a370aee6a248c7 upstream.
    
    Userspace has discovered the functionality offered by SYS_kcmp and has
    started to depend upon it. In particular, Mesa uses SYS_kcmp for
    os_same_file_description() in order to identify when two fd (e.g. device
    or dmabuf) point to the same struct file. Since they depend on it for
    core functionality, lift SYS_kcmp out of the non-default
    CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE into the selectable syscall category.
    
    Rasmus Villemoes also pointed out that systemd uses SYS_kcmp to
    deduplicate the per-service file descriptor store.
    
    Note that some distributions such as Ubuntu are already enabling
    CHECKPOINT_RESTORE in their configs and so, by extension, SYS_kcmp.

    zonefs: Fix file size of zones in full condition
    
    commit 059c01039c0185dbee7ed080f1f2bd22cb1e4dab upstream.
    
    Per ZBC/ZAC/ZNS specifications, write pointers may not have valid values
    when zones are in full condition. However, when zonefs mounts a zoned
    block device, zonefs refers write pointers to set file size even when
    the zones are in full condition. This results in wrong file size. To fix
    this, refer maximum file size in place of write pointers for zones in

    printk: fix deadlock when kernel panic
    
    commit 8a8109f303e25a27f92c1d8edd67d7cbbc60a4eb upstream.
    
    printk_safe_flush_on_panic() caused the following deadlock on our
    server:
    
    CPU0:                                         CPU1:
    panic                                         rcu_dump_cpu_stacks
      kdump_nmi_shootdown_cpus                      nmi_trigger_cpumask_backtrace
        register_nmi_handler(crash_nmi_callback)      printk_safe_flush
                                                        __printk_safe_flush
                                                          raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&read_lock)
        // send NMI to other processors
        apic_send_IPI_allbutself(NMI_VECTOR)
                                                            // NMI interrupt, dead loop
                                                            crash_nmi_callback
      printk_safe_flush_on_panic
        printk_safe_flush
          __printk_safe_flush
            // deadlock
            raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&read_lock)
    
    DEADLOCK: read_lock is taken on CPU1 and will never get released.
    
    It happens when panic() stops a CPU by NMI while it has been in
    the middle of printk_safe_flush().
    
    Handle the lock the same way as logbuf_lock. The printk_safe buffers
    are flushed only when both locks can be safely taken. It can avoid
    the deadlock _in this particular case_ at expense of losing contents
    of printk_safe buffers.
    
    Note: It would actually be safe to re-init the locks when all CPUs were
          stopped by NMI. But it would require passing this information
          from arch-specific code. It is not worth the complexity.
          Especially because logbuf_lock and printk_safe buffers have been
          obsoleted by the lockless ring buffer.

    gpio: pcf857x: Fix missing first interrupt
    
    commit a8002a35935aaefcd6a42ad3289f62bab947f2ca upstream.
    
    If no n_latch value will be provided at driver probe then all pins will
    be used as an input:
    
        gpio->out = ~n_latch;
    
    In that case initial state for all pins is "one":
    
        gpio->status = gpio->out;
    
    So if pcf857x IRQ happens with change pin value from "zero" to "one"
    then we miss it, because of "one" from IRQ and "one" from initial state
    leaves corresponding pin unchanged:
    change = (gpio->status ^ status) & gpio->irq_enabled;
    
    The right solution will be to read actual state at driver probe.

    spmi: spmi-pmic-arb: Fix hw_irq overflow
    
    commit d19db80a366576d3ffadf2508ed876b4c1faf959 upstream.
    
    Currently, when handling the SPMI summary interrupt, the hw_irq
    number is calculated based on SID, Peripheral ID, IRQ index and
    APID. This is then passed to irq_find_mapping() to see if a
    mapping exists for this hw_irq and if available, invoke the
    interrupt handler. Since the IRQ index uses an "int" type, hw_irq
    which is of unsigned long data type can take a large value when
    SID has its MSB set to 1 and the type conversion happens. Because
    of this, irq_find_mapping() returns 0 as there is no mapping
    for this hw_irq. This ends up invoking cleanup_irq() as if
    the interrupt is spurious whereas it is actually a valid
    interrupt. Fix this by using the proper data type (u32) for id.

    locked in the same way as on exception entry.

    powerpc/kexec_file: fix FDT size estimation for kdump kernel
    
    commit 2377c92e37fe97bc5b365f55cf60f56dfc4849f5 upstream.
    
    On systems with large amount of memory, loading kdump kernel through
    kexec_file_load syscall may fail with the below error:
    
        "Failed to update fdt with linux,drconf-usable-memory property"
    
    This happens because the size estimation for kdump kernel's FDT does
    not account for the additional space needed to setup usable memory
    properties. Fix it by accounting for the space needed to include
    linux,usable-memory & linux,drconf-usable-memory properties while
    estimating kdump kernel's FDT size.

    powerpc/32: Preserve cr1 in exception prolog stack check to fix build error
    
    commit 3642eb21256a317ac14e9ed560242c6d20cf06d9 upstream.
    
    THREAD_ALIGN_SHIFT = THREAD_SHIFT + 1 = PAGE_SHIFT + 1
    Maximum PAGE_SHIFT is 18 for 256k pages so
    THREAD_ALIGN_SHIFT is 19 at the maximum.
    
    No need to clobber cr1, it can be preserved when moving r1
    into CR when we check stack overflow.
    
    This reduces the number of instructions in Machine Check Exception
    prolog and fixes a build failure reported by the kernel test robot
    on v5.10 stable when building with RTAS + VMAP_STACK + KVM. That
    build failure is due to too many instructions in the prolog hence
    not fitting between 0x200 and 0x300. Allthough the problem doesn't
    show up in mainline, it is still worth the change.

    module: Ignore _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ when warning for undefined symbols
    
    commit ebfac7b778fac8b0e8e92ec91d0b055f046b4604 upstream.
    
    clang-12 -fno-pic (since
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a084c0388e2a59b9556f2de0083333232da3f1d6)
    can emit `call __stack_chk_fail@PLT` instead of `call __stack_chk_fail`
    on x86.  The two forms should have identical behaviors on x86-64 but the
    former causes GNU as<2.37 to produce an unreferenced undefined symbol
    _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_.
    
    (On x86-32, there is an R_386_PC32 vs R_386_PLT32 difference but the
    linker behavior is identical as far as Linux kernel is concerned.)
    
    Simply ignore _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ for now, like what
    scripts/mod/modpost.c:ignore_undef_symbol does. This also fixes the
    problem for gcc/clang -fpie and -fpic, which may emit `call foo@PLT` for
    external function calls on x86.
    
    Note: ld -z defs and dynamic loaders do not error for unreferenced
    undefined symbols so the module loader is reading too much.  If we ever
    need to ignore more symbols, the code should be refactored to ignore
    unreferenced symbols.

    KVM: nSVM: fix running nested guests when npt=0
    
    commit a04aead144fd938c2d9869eb187e5b9ea0009bae upstream.
    
    In case of npt=0 on host, nSVM needs the same .inject_page_fault tweak
    as VMX has, to make sure that shadow mmu faults are injected as vmexits.
    
    It is not clear why this is needed at all, but for now keep the same
    code as VMX and we'll fix it for both.
    
    Based on a patch by Maxim Levitsky <mlevitsk@redhat.com>.

    mm, compaction: make fast_isolate_freepages() stay within zone
    
    commit 6e2b7044c199229a3d20cefbd3184968238c4184 upstream.
    
    Compaction always operates on pages from a single given zone when
    isolating both pages to migrate and freepages.  Pageblock boundaries are
    intersected with zone boundaries to be safe in case zone starts or ends in
    the middle of pageblock.  The use of pageblock_pfn_to_page() protects
    against non-contiguous pageblocks.
    
    The functions fast_isolate_freepages() and fast_isolate_around() don't
    currently protect the fast freepage isolation thoroughly enough against
    these corner cases, and can result in freepage isolation operate outside
    of zone boundaries:
    
     - in fast_isolate_freepages() if we get a pfn from the first pageblock
       of a zone that starts in the middle of that pageblock, 'highest' can
       be a pfn outside of the zone.
    
       If we fail to isolate anything in this function, we may then call
       fast_isolate_around() on a pfn outside of the zone and there
       effectively do a set_pageblock_skip(page_to_pfn(highest)) which may
       currently hit a VM_BUG_ON() in some configurations
    
     - fast_isolate_around() checks only the zone end boundary and not
       beginning, nor that the pageblock is contiguous (with
       pageblock_pfn_to_page()) so it's possible that we end up calling
       isolate_freepages_block() on a range of pfn's from two different
       zones and end up e.g. isolating freepages under the wrong zone's
       lock.
    
    This patch should fix the above issues.

    mm/vmscan: restore zone_reclaim_mode ABI
    
    commit 519983645a9f2ec339cabfa0c6ef7b09be985dd0 upstream.
    
    I went to go add a new RECLAIM_* mode for the zone_reclaim_mode sysctl.
    Like a good kernel developer, I also went to go update the
    documentation.  I noticed that the bits in the documentation didn't
    match the bits in the #defines.
    
    The VM never explicitly checks the RECLAIM_ZONE bit.  The bit is,
    however implicitly checked when checking 'node_reclaim_mode==0'.  The
    RECLAIM_ZONE #define was removed in a cleanup.  That, by itself is fine.
    
    But, when the bit was removed (bit 0) the _other_ bit locations also got
    changed.  That's not OK because the bit values are documented to mean
    one specific thing.  Users surely do not expect the meaning to change
    from kernel to kernel.
    
    The end result is that if someone had a script that did:
    
            sysctl vm.zone_reclaim_mode=1
    
    it would have gone from enabling node reclaim for clean unmapped pages
    to writing out pages during node reclaim after the commit in question.
    That's not great.
    
    Put the bits back the way they were and add a comment so something like
    this is a bit harder to do again.  Update the documentation to make it
    clear that the first bit is ignored.

    hugetlb: fix copy_huge_page_from_user contig page struct assumption
    
    commit 3272cfc2525b3a2810a59312d7a1e6f04a0ca3ef upstream.
    
    page structs are not guaranteed to be contiguous for gigantic pages.  The
    routine copy_huge_page_from_user can encounter gigantic pages, yet it
    assumes page structs are contiguous when copying pages from user space.
    
    Since page structs for the target gigantic page are not contiguous, the
    data copied from user space could overwrite other pages not associated
    with the gigantic page and cause data corruption.
    
    Non-contiguous page structs are generally not an issue.  However, they can
    exist with a specific kernel configuration and hotplug operations.  For
    example: Configure the kernel with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM and
    !CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.  Then, hotplug add memory for the area where
    the gigantic page will be allocated.

    page structs are not guaranteed to be contiguous for gigantic pages.  The

    mm: memcontrol: fix swap undercounting in cgroup2
    
    commit cae3af62b33aa931427a0f211e04347b22180b36 upstream.
    
    When pages are swapped in, the VM may retain the swap copy to avoid
    repeated writes in the future.  It's also retained if shared pages are
    faulted back in some processes, but not in others.  During that time we
    have an in-memory copy of the page, as well as an on-swap copy.  Cgroup1
    and cgroup2 handle these overlapping lifetimes slightly differently due to
    the nature of how they account memory and swap:
    
    Cgroup1 has a unified memory+swap counter that tracks a data page
    regardless whether it's in-core or swapped out.  On swapin, we transfer
    the charge from the swap entry to the newly allocated swapcache page, even
    though the swap entry might stick around for a while.  That's why we have
    a mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap() call inside mem_cgroup_charge().
    
    Cgroup2 tracks memory and swap as separate, independent resources and thus
    has split memory and swap counters.  On swapin, we charge the newly
    allocated swapcache page as memory, while the swap slot in turn must
    remain charged to the swap counter as long as its allocated too.
    
    The cgroup2 logic was broken by commit 2d1c498072de ("mm: memcontrol: make
    swap tracking an integral part of memory control"), because it
    accidentally removed the do_memsw_account() check in the branch inside
    mem_cgroup_uncharge() that was supposed to tell the difference between the
    charge transfer in cgroup1 and the separate counters in cgroup2.
    
    As a result, cgroup2 currently undercounts retained swap to varying
    degrees: swap slots are cached up to 50% of the configured limit or total
    available swap space; partially faulted back shared pages are only limited
    by physical capacity.  This in turn allows cgroups to significantly
    overconsume their alloted swap space.
    
    Add the do_memsw_account() check back to fix this problem.

    x86: fix seq_file iteration for pat/memtype.c
    
    commit 3d2fc4c082448e9c05792f9b2a11c1d5db408b85 upstream.
    
    The memtype seq_file iterator allocates a buffer in the ->start and ->next
    functions and frees it in the ->show function.  The preferred handling for
    such resources is to free them in the subsequent ->next or ->stop function
    call.
    
    Since Commit 1f4aace60b0e ("fs/seq_file.c: simplify seq_file iteration
    code and interface") there is no guarantee that ->show will be called
    after ->next, so this function can now leak memory.
    
    So move the freeing of the buffer to ->next and ->stop.

    seq_file: document how per-entry resources are managed.
    
    commit b3656d8227f4c45812c6b40815d8f4e446ed372a upstream.
    
    Patch series "Fix some seq_file users that were recently broken".
    
    A recent change to seq_file broke some users which were using seq_file
    in a non-"standard" way ...  though the "standard" isn't documented, so
    they can be excused.  The result is a possible leak - of memory in one
    case, of references to a 'transport' in the other.
    
    These three patches:
     1/ document and explain the problem
     2/ fix the problem user in x86
     3/ fix the problem user in net/sctp
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    Users of seq_file will sometimes find it convenient to take a resource,
    such as a lock or memory allocation, in the ->start or ->next operations.
    These are per-entry resources, distinct from per-session resources which
    are taken in ->start and released in ->stop.
    
    The preferred management of these is release the resource on the
    subsequent call to ->next or ->stop.
    
    However prior to Commit 1f4aace60b0e ("fs/seq_file.c: simplify seq_file
    iteration code and interface") it happened that ->show would always be
    called after ->start or ->next, and a few users chose to release the
    resource in ->show.
    
    This is no longer reliable.  Since the mentioned commit, ->next will
    always come after a successful ->show (to ensure m->index is updated
    correctly), so the original ordering cannot be maintained.
    
    This patch updates the documentation to clearly state the required
    behaviour.  Other patches will fix the few problematic users.

    commit 58fa22f68fcaff20ce4d08a6adffa64f65ccd37d upstream.
    
    Even if erase type is same as previous region, erase size can be different
    if the previous region is overlaid region. Since 'region->size' is assigned
    to 'cmd->size' for overlaid region, comparing 'erase->size' and 'cmd->size'
    can detect previous overlaid region.

    mtd: spi-nor: core: Fix erase type discovery for overlaid region
    
    commit 969b276718de37dfe66fce3a5633f611e8cd58fd upstream.
    
    In case of overlaid regions in which their biggest erase size command
    overpasses in size the region's size, only the non-overlaid portion of
    the sector gets erased. For example, if a Sector Erase command is applied
    to a 256-kB range that is overlaid by 4-kB sectors, the overlaid 4-kB
    sectors are not affected by the erase.
    For overlaid regions, 'region->size' is assigned to 'cmd->size' later in
    spi_nor_init_erase_cmd(), so 'erase->size' can be greater than 'len'.

    watchdog: mei_wdt: request stop on unregister
    
    commit 740c0a57b8f1e36301218bf549f3c9cc833a60be upstream.
    
    The MEI bus has a special behavior on suspend it destroys
    all the attached devices, this is due to the fact that also
    firmware context is not persistent across power flows.
    
    If watchdog on MEI bus is ticking before suspending the firmware
    times out and reports that the OS is missing watchdog tick.
    Send the stop command to the firmware on watchdog unregistered
    to eliminate the false event on suspend.
    This does not make the things worse from the user-space perspective
    as a user-space should re-open watchdog device after
    suspending before this patch.

    As per register documentation, QCOM_WDT_ENABLE_IRQ which is BIT(1)

    not related to bark interrupt at all, BIT(0) is used for that.
    So remove incorrect usage of this bit when supporting bark irq for

    interrupt specified, pre-timeout notification and/or watchdog
    reset/bite does not occur.

    commit f3d60f2a25e4417e1676161fe42115de3e3f98a2 upstream.
    
    We use the generic C VDSO implementations of a handful of clock-related
    functions.  When kasan is enabled this results in asan stub calls that
    are unlikely to be resolved by userspace, this just disables KASAN
    when building the VDSO.
    
    Verified the fix on a kernel with KASAN enabled using vDSO selftests.

    arm64: spectre: Prevent lockdep splat on v4 mitigation enable path
    
    commit a2c42bbabbe260b7626d8459093631a6e16ee0ee upstream.
    
    The Spectre-v4 workaround is re-configured when resuming from suspend,
    as the firmware may have re-enabled the mitigation despite the user
    previously asking for it to be disabled.
    
    Enabling or disabling the workaround can result in an undefined
    instruction exception on CPUs which implement PSTATE.SSBS but only allow
    it to be configured by adjusting the SPSR on exception return. We handle
    this by installing an 'undef hook' which effectively emulates the access.
    
    Installing this hook requires us to take a couple of spinlocks both to
    avoid corrupting the internal list of hooks but also to ensure that we
    don't run into an unhandled exception. Unfortunately, when resuming from
    suspend, we haven't yet called rcu_idle_exit() and so lockdep gets angry
    about "suspicious RCU usage". In doing so, it tries to print a warning,
    which leads it to get even more suspicious, this time about itself:
    
     |  rcu_scheduler_active = 2, debug_locks = 1

    arm64 module: set plt* section addresses to 0x0
    
    commit f5c6d0fcf90ce07ee0d686d465b19b247ebd5ed7 upstream.
    
    These plt* and .text.ftrace_trampoline sections specified for arm64 have
    non-zero addressses. Non-zero section addresses in a relocatable ELF would
    confuse GDB when it tries to compute the section offsets and it ends up
    printing wrong symbol addresses. Therefore, set them to zero, which mirrors
    the change in commit 5d8591bc0fba ("module: set ksymtab/kcrctab* section
    addresses to 0x0").

    iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Fix mask extraction for bootloader programmed SMRs
    
    commit dead723e6f049e9fb6b05e5b93456982798ea961 upstream.
    
    When extracting the mask for a SMR that was programmed by the
    bootloader, the SMR's valid bit is also extracted and is treated
    as part of the mask, which is not correct. Consider the scenario
    where an SMMU master whose context is determined by a bootloader
    programmed SMR is removed (omitting parts of device/driver core):
    
    ->iommu_release_device()
     -> arm_smmu_release_device()
      -> arm_smmu_master_free_smes()
       -> arm_smmu_free_sme() /* Assume that the SME is now free */
       -> arm_smmu_write_sme()
        -> arm_smmu_write_smr() /* Construct SMR value using mask and SID */
    
    Since the valid bit was considered as part of the mask, the SMR will
    be programmed as valid.
    
    Fix the SMR mask extraction step for bootloader programmed SMRs
    by masking out the valid bit when we know that we're already
    working with a valid SMR.

    kprobes: Fix to delay the kprobes jump optimization
    
    commit c85c9a2c6e368dc94907e63babb18a9788e5c9b6 upstream.
    
    Commit 36dadef23fcc ("kprobes: Init kprobes in early_initcall")
    moved the kprobe setup in early_initcall(), which includes kprobe
    jump optimization.
    The kprobes jump optimizer involves synchronize_rcu_tasks() which
    depends on the ksoftirqd and rcu_spawn_tasks_*(). However, since
    those are setup in core_initcall(), kprobes jump optimizer can not
    run at the early_initcall().
    
    To avoid this issue, make the kprobe optimization disabled in the
    early_initcall() and enables it in subsys_initcall().
    
    Note that non-optimized kprobes is still available after
    early_initcall(). Only jump optimization is delayed.

    rcu/nocb: Trigger self-IPI on late deferred wake up before user resume
    
    commit f8bb5cae9616224a39cbb399de382d36ac41df10 upstream.
    
    Entering RCU idle mode may cause a deferred wake up of an RCU NOCB_GP
    kthread (rcuog) to be serviced.
    
    Unfortunately the call to rcu_user_enter() is already past the last
    rescheduling opportunity before we resume to userspace or to guest mode.
    We may escape there with the woken task ignored.
    
    The ultimate resort to fix every callsites is to trigger a self-IPI
    (nohz_full depends on arch to implement arch_irq_work_raise()) that will
    trigger a reschedule on IRQ tail or guest exit.
    
    Eventually every site that want a saner treatment will need to carefully
    place a call to rcu_nocb_flush_deferred_wakeup() before the last explicit
    need_resched() check upon resume.

    rcu/nocb: Perform deferred wake up before last idle's need_resched() check
    
    commit 43789ef3f7d61aa7bed0cb2764e588fc990c30ef upstream.
    
    Entering RCU idle mode may cause a deferred wake up of an RCU NOCB_GP
    kthread (rcuog) to be serviced.
    
    Usually a local wake up happening while running the idle task is handled
    in one of the need_resched() checks carefully placed within the idle
    loop that can break to the scheduler.
    
    Unfortunately the call to rcu_idle_enter() is already beyond the last
    generic need_resched() check and we may halt the CPU with a resched
    request unhandled, leaving the task hanging.
    
    Fix this with splitting the rcuog wakeup handling from rcu_idle_enter()
    and place it before the last generic need_resched() check in the idle
    loop. It is then assumed that no call to call_rcu() will be performed
    after that in the idle loop until the CPU is put in low power mode.

    powerpc/prom: Fix "ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support" scan
    
    commit ed5b00a05c2ae95b59adc3442f45944ec632e794 upstream.
    
    The "ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support" property is a list of pairs of
    bytes representing the options and values supported by the platform
    firmware. At boot time, Linux scans this list and activates the
    available features it recognizes : Radix and XIVE.
    
    A recent change modified the number of entries to loop on and 8 bytes,
    4 pairs of { options, values } entries are always scanned. This is
    fine on KVM but not on PowerVM which can advertises less. As a
    consequence on this platform, Linux reads extra entries pointing to
    random data, interprets these as available features and tries to
    activate them, leading to a firmware crash in
    ibm,client-architecture-support.
    
    Fix that by using the property length of "ibm,arch-vec-5-platform-support".

    x86/fault: Fix AMD erratum #91 errata fixup for user code
    
    commit 35f1c89b0cce247bf0213df243ed902989b1dcda upstream.
    
    The recent rework of probe_kernel_address() and its conversion to
    get_kernel_nofault() inadvertently broke is_prefetch(). Before this
    change, probe_kernel_address() was used as a sloppy "read user or
    kernel memory" helper, but it doesn't do that any more. The new
    get_kernel_nofault() reads *kernel* memory only, which completely broke
    is_prefetch() for user access.
    
    Adjust the code to the correct accessor based on access mode. The
    manual address bounds check is no longer necessary, since the accessor
    helpers (get_user() / get_kernel_nofault()) do the right thing all by
    themselves. As a bonus, by using the correct accessor, the open-coded
    address bounds check is not needed anymore.

    x86/reboot: Force all cpus to exit VMX root if VMX is supported
    
    commit ed72736183c45a413a8d6974dd04be90f514cb6b upstream.
    
    Force all CPUs to do VMXOFF (via NMI shootdown) during an emergency
    reboot if VMX is _supported_, as VMX being off on the current CPU does
    not prevent other CPUs from being in VMX root (post-VMXON).  This fixes
    a bug where a crash/panic reboot could leave other CPUs in VMX root and
    prevent them from being woken via INIT-SIPI-SIPI in the new kernel.

    x86/virt: Eat faults on VMXOFF in reboot flows
    
    commit aec511ad153556640fb1de38bfe00c69464f997f upstream.
    
    Silently ignore all faults on VMXOFF in the reboot flows as such faults
    are all but guaranteed to be due to the CPU not being in VMX root.
    Because (a) VMXOFF may be executed in NMI context, e.g. after VMXOFF but
    before CR4.VMXE is cleared, (b) there's no way to query the CPU's VMX
    state without faulting, and (c) the whole point is to get out of VMX
    root, eating faults is the simplest way to achieve the desired behaior.
    
    Technically, VMXOFF can fault (or fail) for other reasons, but all other
    fault and failure scenarios are mode related, i.e. the kernel would have
    to magically end up in RM, V86, compat mode, at CPL>0, or running with
    the SMI Transfer Monitor active.  The kernel is beyond hosed if any of
    those scenarios are encountered; trying to do something fancy in the

    media: smipcie: fix interrupt handling and IR timeout
    
    commit 6532923237b427ed30cc7b4486f6f1ccdee3c647 upstream.
    
    After the first IR message, interrupts are no longer received. In addition,
    the code generates a timeout IR message of 10ms but sets the timeout value
    to 100ms, so no timeout was ever generated.

    commit fb18802a338b36f675a388fc03d2aa504a0d0899 upstream.
    
    When an IOCTL with argument size larger than 128 that also used array
    arguments were handled, two memory allocations were made but alas, only
    the latter one of them was released. This happened because there was only
    a single local variable to hold such a temporary allocation.
    
    Fix this by adding separate variables to hold the pointers to the
    temporary allocations.

    floppy: reintroduce O_NDELAY fix
    
    commit 8a0c014cd20516ade9654fc13b51345ec58e7be8 upstream.
    
    This issue was originally fixed in 09954bad4 ("floppy: refactor open()
    flags handling").
    
    The fix as a side-effect, however, introduce issue for open(O_ACCMODE)
    that is being used for ioctl-only open. I wrote a fix for that, but
    instead of it being merged, full revert of 09954bad4 was performed,
    re-introducing the O_NDELAY / O_NONBLOCK issue, and it strikes again.
    
    This is a forward-port of the original fix to current codebase; the
    original submission had the changelog below:
    
    ====
    Commit 09954bad4 ("floppy: refactor open() flags handling"), as a
    side-effect, causes open(/dev/fdX, O_ACCMODE) to fail. It turns out that
    this is being used setfdprm userspace for ioctl-only open().
    
    Reintroduce back the original behavior wrt !(FMODE_READ|FMODE_WRITE)
    modes, while still keeping the original O_NDELAY bug fixed.

    arm64: ptrace: Fix seccomp of traced syscall -1 (NO_SYSCALL)
    
    commit df84fe94708985cdfb78a83148322bcd0a699472 upstream.
    
    Since commit f086f67485c5 ("arm64: ptrace: add support for syscall
    emulation"), if system call number -1 is called and the process is being
    traced with PTRACE_SYSCALL, for example by strace, the seccomp check is
    skipped and -ENOSYS is returned unconditionally (unless altered by the
    tracer) rather than carrying out action specified in the seccomp filter.
    
    The consequence of this is that it is not possible to reliably strace
    a seccomp based implementation of a foreign system call interface in
    which r7/x8 is permitted to be -1 on entry to a system call.
    
    Also trace_sys_enter and audit_syscall_entry are skipped if a system
    call is skipped.
    
    Fix by removing the in_syscall(regs) check restoring the previous
    behaviour which is like AArch32, x86 (which uses generic code) and
    everything else.

    crypto: michael_mic - fix broken misalignment handling
    
    commit e1b2d980f03b833442768c1987d5ad0b9a58cfe7 upstream.
    
    The Michael MIC driver uses the cra_alignmask to ensure that pointers
    presented to its update and finup/final methods are 32-bit aligned.
    However, due to the way the shash API works, this is no guarantee that
    the 32-bit reads occurring in the update method are also aligned, as the
    size of the buffer presented to update may be of uneven length. For
    instance, an update() of 3 bytes followed by a misaligned update() of 4
    or more bytes will result in a misaligned access using an accessor that
    is not suitable for this.
    
    On most architectures, this does not matter, and so setting the
    cra_alignmask is pointless. On architectures where this does matter,
    setting the cra_alignmask does not actually solve the problem.
    
    So let's get rid of the cra_alignmask, and use unaligned accessors
    instead, where appropriate.

    crypto: aesni - prevent misaligned buffers on the stack
    
    commit a13ed1d15b07a04b1f74b2df61ff7a5e47f45dd8 upstream.
    
    The GCM mode driver uses 16 byte aligned buffers on the stack to pass
    the IV to the asm helpers, but unfortunately, the x86 port does not
    guarantee that the stack pointer is 16 byte aligned upon entry in the
    first place. Since the compiler is not aware of this, it will not emit
    the additional stack realignment sequence that is needed, and so the
    alignment is not guaranteed to be more than 8 bytes.
    
    So instead, allocate some padding on the stack, and realign the IV
    pointer by hand.

    crypto: arm64/sha - add missing module aliases
    
    commit 0df07d8117c3576f1603b05b84089742a118d10a upstream.
    
    The accelerated, instruction based implementations of SHA1, SHA2 and
    SHA3 are autoloaded based on CPU capabilities, given that the code is
    modest in size, and widely used, which means that resolving the algo
    name, loading all compatible modules and picking the one with the
    highest priority is taken to be suboptimal.
    
    However, if these algorithms are requested before this CPU feature
    based matching and autoloading occurs, these modules are not even
    considered, and we end up with suboptimal performance.
    
    So add the missing module aliases for the various SHA implementations.

    At btrfs_copy_root(), if the call to btrfs_inc_ref() fails we end up
    returning without unlocking and releasing our reference on the extent
    buffer named "cow" we previously allocated with btrfs_alloc_tree_block().
    
    So fix that by unlocking the extent buffer and dropping our reference on
    it before returning.

    btrfs: account for new extents being deleted in total_bytes_pinned
    
    commit 81e75ac74ecba929d1e922bf93f9fc467232e39f upstream.
    
    My recent patch set "A variety of lock contention fixes", found here
    
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/cover.1608319304.git.josef@toxicpanda.com/
    (Tracked in https://github.com/btrfs/linux/issues/86)
    
    that reduce lock contention on the extent root by running delayed refs
    less often resulted in a regression in generic/371.  This test
    fallocate()'s the fs until it's full, deletes all the files, and then
    tries to fallocate() until full again.
    
    Before these patches we would run all of the delayed refs during
    flushing, and then would commit the transaction because we had plenty of
    pinned space to recover in order to allocate.  However my patches made
    it so we weren't running the delayed refs as aggressively, which meant
    that we appeared to have less pinned space when we were deciding to
    commit the transaction.
    
    We use the space_info->total_bytes_pinned to approximate how much space
    we have pinned.  It's approximate because if we remove a reference to an
    extent we may free it, but there may be more references to it than we
    know of at that point, but we account it as pinned at the creation time,
    and then it's properly accounted when the delayed ref runs.
    
    The way we account for pinned space is if the
    delayed_ref_head->total_ref_mod is < 0, because that is clearly a
    freeing option.  However there is another case, and that is where
    ->total_ref_mod == 0 && ->must_insert_reserved == 1.
    
    When we allocate a new extent, we have ->total_ref_mod == 1 and we have
    ->must_insert_reserved == 1.  This is used to indicate that it is a
    brand new extent and will need to have its extent entry added before we
    modify any references on the delayed ref head.  But if we subsequently
    remove that extent reference, our ->total_ref_mod will be 0, and that
    space will be pinned and freed.  Accounting for this case properly
    allows for generic/371 to pass with my delayed refs patches applied.
    
    It's important to note that this problem exists without the referenced
    patches, it just was uncovered by them.

    btrfs: handle space_info::total_bytes_pinned inside the delayed ref itself
    
    commit 2187374f35fe9cadbddaa9fcf0c4121365d914e8 upstream.
    
    Currently we pass things around to figure out if we maybe freeing data
    based on the state of the delayed refs head.  This makes the accounting
    sort of confusing and hard to follow, as it's distinctly separate from
    the delayed ref heads stuff, but also depends on it entirely.
    
    Fix this by explicitly adjusting the space_info->total_bytes_pinned in
    the delayed refs code.  We now have two places where we modify this
    counter, once where we create the delayed and destroy the delayed refs,
    and once when we pin and unpin the extents.  This means there is a
    slight overlap between delayed refs and the pin/unpin mechanisms, but
    this is simply used by the ENOSPC infrastructure to determine if we need
    to commit the transaction, so there's no adverse affect from this, we
    might simply commit thinking it will give us enough space when it might
    not.

    This happened because I injected an error in btrfs_cow_block() while
    running the dirty block groups.  When we run the dirty block groups, we
    splice the list onto a local list to process.  However if an error
    occurs, we only cleanup the transactions dirty block group list, not any
    pending block groups we have on our locally spliced list.
    
    In fact if we fail to allocate a path in this function we'll also fail
    to clean up the splice list.
    
    Fix this by splicing the list back onto the transaction dirty block
    group list so that the block groups are cleaned up.  Then add a 'out'
    label and have the error conditions jump to out so that the errors are
    handled properly.  This also has the side-effect of fixing a problem
    where we would clear 'ret' on error because we unconditionally ran
    btrfs_run_delayed_refs().

    btrfs: fix reloc root leak with 0 ref reloc roots on recovery
    
    commit c78a10aebb275c38d0cfccae129a803fe622e305 upstream.
    
    When recovering a relocation, if we run into a reloc root that has 0
    refs we simply add it to the reloc_control->reloc_roots list, and then
    clean it up later.  The problem with this is __del_reloc_root() doesn't
    do anything if the root isn't in the radix tree, which in this case it
    won't be because we never call __add_reloc_root() on the reloc_root.
    
    This exit condition simply isn't correct really.  During normal
    operation we can remove ourselves from the rb tree and then we're meant
    to clean up later at merge_reloc_roots() time, and this happens
    correctly.  During recovery we're depending on free_reloc_roots() to
    drop our references, but we're short-circuiting.
    
    Fix this by continuing to check if we're on the list and dropping
    ourselves from the reloc_control root list and dropping our reference
    appropriately.  Change the corresponding BUG_ON() to an ASSERT() that
    does the correct thing if we aren't in the rb tree.

    btrfs: abort the transaction if we fail to inc ref in btrfs_copy_root
    
    commit 867ed321f90d06aaba84e2c91de51cd3038825ef upstream.
    
    While testing my error handling patches, I added a error injection site
    at btrfs_inc_extent_ref, to validate the error handling I added was
    doing the correct thing.  However I hit a pretty ugly corruption while
    doing this check, with the following error injection stack trace:
    
    btrfs_inc_extent_ref
      btrfs_copy_root
        create_reloc_root
          btrfs_init_reloc_root
            btrfs_record_root_in_trans
              btrfs_start_transaction
                btrfs_update_inode
                  btrfs_update_time
                    touch_atime
                      file_accessed
                        btrfs_file_mmap
    
    This is because we do not catch the error from btrfs_inc_extent_ref,
    which in practice would be ENOMEM, which means we lose the extent
    references for a root that has already been allocated and inserted,
    which is the problem.  Fix this by aborting the transaction if we fail
    to do the reference modification.

    btrfs: add asserts for deleting backref cache nodes
    
    commit eddda68d97732ce05ca145f8e85e8a447f65cdad upstream.
    
    A weird KASAN problem that Zygo reported could have been easily caught
    if we checked for basic things in our backref freeing code.  We have two
    methods of freeing a backref node
    
    - btrfs_backref_free_node: this just is kfree() essentially.
    - btrfs_backref_drop_node: this actually unlinks the node and cleans up
      everything and then calls btrfs_backref_free_node().
    
    We should mostly be using btrfs_backref_drop_node(), to make sure the
    node is properly unlinked from the backref cache, and only use
    btrfs_backref_free_node() when we know the node isn't actually linked to
    the backref cache.  We made a mistake here and thus got the KASAN splat.
    
    Make this style of issue easier to find by adding some ASSERT()'s to
    btrfs_backref_free_node() and adjusting our deletion stuff to properly
    init the list so we can rely on list_empty() checks working properly.

    btrfs: do not warn if we can't find the reloc root when looking up backref
    
    commit f78743fbdae1bb31bc9c9233c3590a5048782381 upstream.
    
    The backref code is looking for a reloc_root that corresponds to the
    given fs root.  However any number of things could have gone wrong while
    initializing that reloc_root, like ENOMEM while trying to allocate the
    root itself, or EIO while trying to write the root item.  This would
    result in no corresponding reloc_root being in the reloc root cache, and
    thus would return NULL when we do the find_reloc_root() call.
    
    Because of this we do not want to WARN_ON().  This presumably was meant
    to catch developer errors, cases where we messed up adding the reloc
    root.  However we can easily hit this case with error injection, and
    thus should not do a WARN_ON().

    This occurs because of this check
    
      if (RB_EMPTY_NODE(&upper->rb_node))
              BUG_ON(!list_empty(&node->upper));
    
    As we are dropping the backref node, if we discover that our upper node
    in the edge we just cleaned up isn't linked into the cache that we are
    now done with this node, thus the BUG_ON().
    
    However this is an erroneous assumption, as we will look up all the
    references for a node first, and then process the pending edges.  All of
    the 'upper' nodes in our pending edges won't be in the cache's rb_tree
    yet, because they haven't been processed.  We could very well have many
    edges still left to cleanup on this node.
    
    The fact is we simply do not need this check, we can just process all of
    the edges only for this node, because below this check we do the
    following
    
      if (list_empty(&upper->lower)) {
              list_add_tail(&upper->lower, &cache->leaves);
              upper->lowest = 1;
      }
    
    If the upper node truly isn't used yet, then we add it to the
    cache->leaves list to be cleaned up later.  If it is still used then the
    last child node that has it linked into its node will add it to the
    leaves list and then it will be cleaned up.
    
    Fix this problem by dropping this logic altogether.  With this fix I no
    longer see the panic when testing with error injection in the backref
    code.

    commit 8c657a0590de585b1115847c17b34a58025f2f4b upstream.
    
    When TPM 2.0 trusted keys code was moved to the trusted keys subsystem,
    the operations were unwrapped from tpm_try_get_ops() and tpm_put_ops(),
    which are used to take temporarily the ownership of the TPM chip. The
    ownership is only taken inside tpm_send(), but this is not sufficient,
    as in the key load TPM2_CC_LOAD, TPM2_CC_UNSEAL and TPM2_FLUSH_CONTEXT
    need to be done as a one single atom.
    
    Take the TPM chip ownership before sending anything with
    tpm_try_get_ops() and tpm_put_ops(), and use tpm_transmit_cmd() to send
    TPM commands instead of tpm_send(), reverting back to the old behaviour.

    KEYS: trusted: Fix migratable=1 failing
    
    commit 8da7520c80468c48f981f0b81fc1be6599e3b0ad upstream.
    
    Consider the following transcript:
    
    $ keyctl add trusted kmk "new 32 blobauth=helloworld keyhandle=80000000 migratable=1" @u
    add_key: Invalid argument
    
    The documentation has the following description:
    
      migratable=   0|1 indicating permission to reseal to new PCR values,
                    default 1 (resealing allowed)
    
    The consequence is that "migratable=1" should succeed. Fix this by
    allowing this condition to pass instead of return -EINVAL.

    KEYS: trusted: Fix incorrect handling of tpm_get_random()
    
    commit 5df16caada3fba3b21cb09b85cdedf99507f4ec1 upstream.
    
    When tpm_get_random() was introduced, it defined the following API for the
    return value:
    
    1. A positive value tells how many bytes of random data was generated.
    2. A negative value on error.
    
    However, in the call sites the API was used incorrectly, i.e. as it would
    only return negative values and otherwise zero. Returning he positive read
    counts to the user space does not make any possible sense.
    
    Fix this by returning -EIO when tpm_get_random() returns a positive value.

    tpm_tis: Clean up locality release
    
    commit e42acf104d6e0bd7ccd2f09103d5be5e6d3c637c upstream.
    
    The current release locality code seems to be based on the
    misunderstanding that the TPM interrupts when a locality is released:
    it doesn't, only when the locality is acquired.
    
    Furthermore, there seems to be no point in waiting for the locality to
    be released.  All it does is penalize the last TPM user.  However, if
    there's no next TPM user, this is a pointless wait and if there is a
    next TPM user, they'll pay the penalty waiting for the new locality
    (or possibly not if it's the same as the old locality).
    
    Fix the code by making release_locality as simple write to release
    with no waiting for completion.

    tpm_tis: Fix check_locality for correct locality acquisition
    
    commit 3d9ae54af1d02a7c0edc55c77d7df2b921e58a87 upstream.
    
    The TPM TIS specification says the TPM signals the acquisition of locality
    when the TMP_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE bit goes to one *and* the
    TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE bit goes to zero.  Currently we only check the
    former not the latter, so check both.  Adding the check on
    TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE should fix the case where the locality is
    re-requested before the TPM has released it.  In this case the locality may
    get released briefly before it is reacquired, which causes all sorts of
    problems. However, with the added check, TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE should
    remain 1 until the second request for the locality is granted.

    Currently, although set_bit() & test_bit() pairs are used as a fast-
    path for initialized configurations. However, these atomic ops are
    actually relaxed forms. Instead, load-acquire & store-release form is
    needed to make sure uninitialized fields won't be observed in advance
    here (yet no such corresponding bitops so use full barriers instead.)

    selinux: fix inconsistency between inode_getxattr and inode_listsecurity
    
    commit a9ffe682c58aaff643764547f5420e978b6e0830 upstream.
    
    When inode has no listxattr op of its own (e.g. squashfs) vfs_listxattr
    calls the LSM inode_listsecurity hooks to list the xattrs that LSMs will
    intercept in inode_getxattr hooks.
    
    When selinux LSM is installed but not initialized, it will list the
    security.selinux xattr in inode_listsecurity, but will not intercept it
    in inode_getxattr.  This results in -ENODATA for a getxattr call for an
    xattr returned by listxattr.
    
    This situation was manifested as overlayfs failure to copy up lower
    files from squashfs when selinux is built-in but not initialized,
    because ovl_copy_xattr() iterates the lower inode xattrs by
    vfs_listxattr() and vfs_getxattr().
    
    Match the logic of inode_listsecurity to that of inode_getxattr and
    do not list the security.selinux xattr if selinux is not initialized.

    drm/rockchip: Require the YTR modifier for AFBC
    
    commit 5f94e3571459abb626077aedb65d71264c2a58c0 upstream.
    
    The AFBC decoder used in the Rockchip VOP assumes the use of the
    YUV-like colourspace transform (YTR). YTR is lossless for RGB(A)
    buffers, which covers the RGBA8 and RGB565 formats supported in
    vop_convert_afbc_format. Use of YTR is signaled with the
    AFBC_FORMAT_MOD_YTR modifier, which prior to this commit was missing. As
    such, a producer would have to generate buffers that do not use YTR,
    which the VOP would erroneously decode as YTR, leading to severe visual
    corruption.
    
    The upstream AFBC support was developed against a captured frame, which
    failed to exercise modifier support. Prior to bring-up of AFBC in Mesa
    (in the Panfrost driver), no open userspace respected modifier
    reporting. As such, this change is not expected to affect broken
    userspaces.
    
    Tested on RK3399 with Panfrost and Weston.

    The panel is able to work when dsi clock is non-continuous, thus

    Also the flag actually becomes necessary after
    commit c6d94e37bdbb ("drm/bridge/synopsys: dsi: add support for non-continuous HS clock")
    and without it the panel only emits stripes instead of output.

    drm/amdkfd: Fix recursive lock warnings
    
    commit 1fb8b1fc4dd1035a264c81d15d41f05884cc8058 upstream.
    
    memalloc_nofs_save/restore are no longer sufficient to prevent recursive
    lock warnings when holding locks that can be taken in MMU notifiers. Use
    memalloc_noreclaim_save/restore instead.

    drm/amd/display: Add vupdate_no_lock interrupts for DCN2.1
    
    commit 688f97ed3f5e339c0c2c09d9ee7ff23d5807b0a7 upstream.
    
    When run igt@kms_vrr in a device that uses DCN2.1 architecture, we
    noticed multiple failures. Furthermore, when we tested a VRR demo, we
    noticed a system hang where the mouse pointer still works, but the
    entire system freezes; in this case, we don't see any dmesg warning or
    failure messages kernel. This happens due to a lack of vupdate_no_lock
    interrupt, making the userspace wait eternally to get the event back.
    For fixing this issue, we need to add the vupdate_no_lock interrupt in
    the interrupt list.

    [Why]
    In some cases, this function is called when DIG BE is not
    connected to DIG FE, in which case a value of zero isn't
    invalid and assert should not be hit.

    drm/amd/display: Add FPU wrappers to dcn21_validate_bandwidth()
    
    commit 41401ac67791810dd880345962339aa1bedd3c0d upstream.
    
    dcn21_validate_bandwidth() calls functions that use floating point math.
    On my machine this sometimes results in simd exceptions when there are
    other FPU users such as KVM virtual machines running. The screen freezes
    completely in this case.
    
    Wrapping the function with DC_FP_START()/DC_FP_END() seems to solve the
    problem. This mirrors the approach used for dcn20_validate_bandwidth.
    
    Tested on a AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 4750U (Renoir).

    bcache: Move journal work to new flush wq
    
    commit afe78ab46f638ecdf80a35b122ffc92c20d9ae5d upstream.
    
    This is potentially long running and not latency sensitive, let's get
    it out of the way of other latency sensitive events.
    
    As observed in the previous commit, the `system_wq` comes easily
    congested by bcache, and this fixes a few more stalls I was observing
    every once in a while.
    
    Let's not make this `WQ_MEM_RECLAIM` as it showed to reduce performance
    of boot and file system operations in my tests. Also, without
    `WQ_MEM_RECLAIM`, I no longer see desktop stalls. This matches the
    previous behavior as `system_wq` also does no memory reclaim:
    
    > // workqueue.c:
    > system_wq = alloc_workqueue("events", 0, 0);

    bcache: Give btree_io_wq correct semantics again
    
    commit d797bd9897e3559eb48d68368550d637d32e468c upstream.
    
    Before killing `btree_io_wq`, the queue was allocated using
    `create_singlethread_workqueue()` which has `WQ_MEM_RECLAIM`. After
    killing it, it no longer had this property but `system_wq` is not
    single threaded.
    
    Let's combine both worlds and make it multi threaded but able to
    reclaim memory.

    Revert "bcache: Kill btree_io_wq"
    
    commit 9f233ffe02e5cef611100cd8c5bcf4de26ca7bef upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 56b30770b27d54d68ad51eccc6d888282b568cee.
    
    With the btree using the `system_wq`, I seem to see a lot more desktop
    latency than I should.
    
    After some more investigation, it looks like the original assumption
    of 56b3077 no longer is true, and bcache has a very high potential of
    congesting the `system_wq`. In turn, this introduces laggy desktop
    performance, IO stalls (at least with btrfs), and input events may be
    delayed.
    
    So let's revert this. It's important to note that the semantics of
    using `system_wq` previously mean that `btree_io_wq` should be created
    before and destroyed after other bcache wqs to keep the same
    assumptions.

    MIPS: compressed: fix build with enabled UBSAN

    For the OCTEON boards, it need to patch the built-in DTB before using
    it. Previously it judges if it is a built-in DTB by checking
    fw_passed_dtb. But after commit 37e5c69ffd41 ("MIPS: head.S: Init
    fw_passed_dtb to builtin DTB", the fw_passed_dtb is initialized even
    when using built-in DTB. This causes the OCTEON boards boot broken due
    to an unpatched built-in DTB is used. Revert the commit d9df9fb901d2 to
    restore the codes before the fw_passed_dtb is used and then fix this
    issue.

    MIPS: VDSO: Use CLANG_FLAGS instead of filtering out '--target='
    
    commit 76d7fff22be3e4185ee5f9da2eecbd8188e76b2c upstream.
    
    Commit ee67855ecd9d ("MIPS: vdso: Allow clang's --target flag in VDSO
    cflags") allowed the '--target=' flag from the main Makefile to filter
    through to the vDSO. However, it did not bring any of the other clang
    specific flags for controlling the integrated assembler and the GNU
    tools locations (--prefix=, --gcc-toolchain=, and -no-integrated-as).
    Without these, we will get a warning (visible with tinyconfig):
    
    arch/mips/vdso/elf.S:14:1: warning: DWARF2 only supports one section per
    compilation unit
    .pushsection .note.Linux, "a",@note ; .balign 4 ; .long 2f - 1f ; .long
    4484f - 3f ; .long 0 ; 1:.asciz "Linux" ; 2:.balign 4 ; 3:
    ^
    arch/mips/vdso/elf.S:34:2: warning: DWARF2 only supports one section per
    compilation unit
     .section .mips_abiflags, "a"
     ^
    
    All of these flags are bundled up under CLANG_FLAGS in the main Makefile
    and exported so that they can be added to Makefiles that set their own
    CFLAGS. Use this value instead of filtering out '--target=' so there is
    no warning and all of the tools are properly used.

    MIPS: Support binutils configured with --enable-mips-fix-loongson3-llsc=yes
    
    commit 5373ae67c3aad1ab306cc722b5a80b831eb4d4d1 upstream.
    
    From version 2.35, binutils can be configured with
    --enable-mips-fix-loongson3-llsc=yes, which means it defaults to
    -mfix-loongson3-llsc. This breaks labels which might then point at the
    wrong instruction.
    
    The workaround to explicitly pass -mno-fix-loongson3-llsc has been
    added in Linux version 5.1, but is only enabled when building a Loongson
    64 kernel. As vendors might use a common toolchain for building Loongson
    and non-Loongson kernels, just move that workaround to
    arch/mips/Makefile. At the same time update the comments to reflect the
    current status.

    HP Spectre x360 14 model (PCI SSID 103c:87f7) seems requiring a unique

    ALSA: hda/hdmi: Drop bogus check at closing a stream
    
    commit 056a3da5d07fc5d3ceacfa2cdf013c9d8df630bd upstream.
    
    Some users reported the kernel WARNING with stack traces from
    hdmi_pcm_close(), and it's the line checking the per_cvt->assigned
    flag.  This used to be a valid check in the past because the flag was
    turned on/off only at opening and closing a PCM stream.  Meanwhile,
    since the introduction of the silent-stream mode, this flag may be
    turned on/off at the monitor connection/disconnection time, which
    isn't always associated with the PCM open/close.  Hence this may lead
    to the inconsistent per_cvt->assigned flag at closing.
    
    As the check itself became almost useless and confuses users as if it

    ALSA: fireface: fix to parse sync status register of latter protocol
    
    commit c50bfc8a6866775be39d7e747e83e8a5a9051e2e upstream.
    
    Fireface UCX, UFX, and FF802 are categorized for latter protocol of the
    series. Current support for FF802 (and UFX) includes failure to parse
    sync status register and results in EIO.
    
    Further investigation figures out that the content of register differs
    depending on models. This commit adds tables specific to FF802 and UFX
    to fix it.

    commit 257d2d7e9e798305d65825cb82b0a7d1c0511e89 upstream.
    
    In the later patch, we're going to issue the PCM sync_stop calls at
    disconnection.  But currently the USB-audio driver can't handle it
    because it has a check of shutdown flag for stopping the URBs.  This
    is basically superfluous (the stopping URBs are safe at disconnection
    state), so let's drop the check.

    ALSA: usb-audio: More strict state change in EP
    
    commit 5c2b301476ec493be15546f05e23414e2aa9d472 upstream.
    
    The endpoint management has bit flags to indicate the current state,
    and we're dealing two things: the running bit and the stopping bit.
    There is a thin window in transition from the running to the stopping
    in stop_urbs(), and as long as the bit flags are used, it's difficult
    to plug.
    
    This patch modifies the state management code to use the atomic int
    and follow the explicit three states, STOPPED, RUNNING and STOPPING.
    The state change is done via atomic_cmpxhg() for avoiding possible
    races, and check the state change more strictly.  The unexpected state
    change is now handled as an error.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Handle invalid running state at releasing EP
    
    commit d6cda4655e2a7612a1e48c49795a5330abc01c5a upstream.
    
    When we stop an endpoint in release_urbs(), it ignores the
    inconsistent endpoint state and tries to release the resources.
    This shouldn't happen in theory, but it's still safer to abort the
    release and let the caller proper error handling.
    
    Also, stop_and_unlink_urbs() called from release_urbs() does two step
    works, and it's more straightforward to split this to two functions
    again, so that the call from the PCM trigger won't take the path with
    sleeping.
    
    This patch modifies the EP management code to adapt two points above.

    usb: musb: Fix runtime PM race in musb_queue_resume_work
    
    commit 0eaa1a3714db34a59ce121de5733c3909c529463 upstream.
    
    musb_queue_resume_work() would call the provided callback if the runtime
    PM status was 'active'. Otherwise, it would enqueue the request if the
    hardware was still suspended (musb->is_runtime_suspended is true).
    
    This causes a race with the runtime PM handlers, as it is possible to be
    in the case where the runtime PM status is not yet 'active', but the
    hardware has been awaken (PM resume function has been called).
    
    When hitting the race, the resume work was not enqueued, which probably
    triggered other bugs further down the stack. For instance, a telnet
    connection on Ingenic SoCs would result in a 50/50 chance of a
    segmentation fault somewhere in the musb code.
    
    Rework the code so that either we call the callback directly if
    (musb->is_runtime_suspended == 0), or enqueue the query otherwise.

    USB: serial: option: update interface mapping for ZTE P685M
    
    commit 6420a569504e212d618d4a4736e2c59ed80a8478 upstream.
    
    This patch prepares for qmi_wwan driver support for the device.
    Previously "option" driver mapped itself to interfaces 0 and 3 (matching
    ff/ff/ff), while interface 3 is in fact a QMI port.
    Interfaces 1 and 2 (matching ff/00/00) expose AT commands,
    and weren't supported previously at all.
    Without this patch, a possible conflict would exist if device ID was
    added to qmi_wwan driver for interface 3.
    
    Update and simplify device ID to match interfaces 0-2 directly,
    to expose QCDM (0), PCUI (1), and modem (2) ports and avoid conflict
    with QMI (3), and ADB (4).
    
    The modem is used inside ZTE MF283+ router and carriers identify it as
    such.
    Interface mapping is:
    0: QCDM, 1: AT (PCUI), 2: AT (Modem), 3: QMI, 4: ADB

    ir->txports_cabled comes from response data, and isn't validated.
    
    As ir->txports_cabled is a u8, nothing should be done if the bit index
    is greater than 7.

    Input: i8042 - add ASUS Zenbook Flip to noselftest list
    
    commit b5d6e7ab7fe7d186878142e9fc1a05e4c3b65eb9 upstream.
    
    After commit 77b425399f6d ("Input: i8042 - use chassis info to skip
    selftest on Asus laptops"), all modern Asus laptops have the i8042
    selftest disabled. It has done by using chassys type "10" (laptop).
    
    The Asus Zenbook Flip suffers from similar suspend/resume issues, but
    it _sometimes_ work and sometimes it doesn't. Setting noselftest makes
    it work reliably. In this case, we need to add chassis type "31"
    (convertible) in order to avoid selftest in this device.

    HID: wacom: Ignore attempts to overwrite the touch_max value from HID
    
    commit 88f38846bfb1a452a3d47e38aeab20a4ceb74294 upstream.
    
    The `wacom_feature_mapping` function is careful to only set the the
    touch_max value a single time, but this care does not extend to the
    `wacom_wac_finger_event` function. In particular, if a device sends
    multiple HID_DG_CONTACTMAX items in a single feature report, the
    driver will end up retaining the value of last item.
    
    The HID descriptor for the Cintiq Companion 2 does exactly this. It
    incorrectly sets a "Report Count" of 2, which will cause the driver
    to process two HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT items. The first item has the actual
    count, while the second item should have been declared as a constant
    zero. The constant zero is the value the driver ends up using, however,
    since it is the last HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT in the report.
    
        Report ID (16),
        Usage (Contact Count Maximum),  ; Contact count maximum (55h, static value)
        Report Count (2),
        Logical Maximum (10),
        Feature (Variable),
    
    To address this, we add a check that the touch_max is not already set
    within the `wacom_wac_finger_event` function that processes the
    HID_DG_TOUCHMAX item. We emit a warning if the value is set and ignore
    the updated value.
    
    This could potentially cause problems if there is a tablet which has
    a similar issue but requires the last item to be used. This is unlikely,
    however, since it would have to have a different non-zero value for
    HID_DG_CONTACTMAX earlier in the same report, which makes no sense
    except in the case of a firmware bug. Note that cases where the
    HID_DG_CONTACTMAX items are in different reports is already handled
    (and similarly ignored) by `wacom_feature_mapping` as mentioned above.

    HID: logitech-dj: add support for keyboard events in eQUAD step 4 Gaming
    
    commit ef07c116d98772952807492bd32a61f5af172a94 upstream.
    
    In e400071a805d6229223a98899e9da8c6233704a1 I added support for the
    receiver that comes with the G602 device, but unfortunately I screwed up
    during testing and it seems the keyboard events were actually not being
    sent to userspace.
    This resulted in keyboard events being broken in userspace, please
    backport the fix.
    
    The receiver uses the normal 0x01 Logitech keyboard report descriptor,
    as expected, so it is just a matter of flagging it as supported.

    cpufreq: ACPI: Set cpuinfo.max_freq directly if max boost is known
    
    commit 538b0188da4653b9f4511a114f014354fb6fb7a5 upstream.
    
    Commit 3c55e94c0ade ("cpufreq: ACPI: Extend frequency tables to cover
    boost frequencies") attempted to address a performance issue involving
    acpi-cpufreq, the schedutil governor and scale-invariance on x86 by
    extending the frequency tables created by acpi-cpufreq to cover the
    entire range of "turbo" (or "boost") frequencies, but that caused
    frequencies reported via /proc/cpuinfo and the scaling_cur_freq
    attribute in sysfs to change which may confuse users and monitoring
    tools.
    
    For this reason, revert the part of commit 3c55e94c0ade adding the
    extra entry to the frequency table and use the observation that
    in principle cpuinfo.max_freq need not be equal to the maximum
    frequency listed in the frequency table for the given policy.
    
    Namely, modify cpufreq_frequency_table_cpuinfo() to allow cpufreq
    drivers to set their own cpuinfo.max_freq above that frequency and
    change  acpi-cpufreq to set cpuinfo.max_freq to the maximum boost
    frequency found via CPPC.
    
    This should be sufficient to let all of the cpufreq subsystem know
    the real maximum frequency of the CPU without changing frequency
    reporting.

    ACPI: property: Fix fwnode string properties matching
    
    commit e1e6bd2995ac0e1ad0c2a2d906a06f59ce2ed293 upstream.
    
    Property matching does not work for ACPI fwnodes if the value of the
    given property is not represented as a package in the _DSD package
    containing it.  For example, the "compatible" property in the _DSD
    below
    
      Name (_DSD, Package () {
        ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
        Package () {
          Package () {"compatible", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45"}
        }
      })
    
    will not be found by fwnode_property_match_string(), because the ACPI
    code handling device properties does not regard the single value as a
    "list" in that case.
    
    Namely, fwnode_property_match_string() invoked to match a given
    string property value first calls fwnode_property_read_string_array()
    with the last two arguments equal to NULL and 0, respectively, in
    order to count the items in the value of the given property, with the
    assumption that this value may be an array.  For ACPI fwnodes, that
    operation is carried out by acpi_node_prop_read() which calls
    acpi_data_prop_read() for this purpose.  However, when the return
    (val) pointer is NULL, that function only looks for a property whose
    value is a package without checking the single-value case at all.
    
    To fix that, make acpi_data_prop_read() check the single-value
    case if its return pointer argument is NULL and modify
    acpi_data_prop_read_single() handling that case to attempt to
    read the value of the property if the return pointer is NULL
    and return 1 if that succeeds.

    soundwire: intel: fix possible crash when no device is detected
    
    commit 957e3f797917b36355766807b1d8a54a1ba0cfc9 upstream.
    
    acpi_walk_namespace can return success without executing our
    callback which initializes info->handle.
    If the random value in this structure is a valid address (which
    is on the stack, so it's quite possible), then nothing bad will
    happen, because:
    sdw_intel_scan_controller
     -> acpi_bus_get_device
     -> acpi_get_device_data
     -> acpi_get_data_full
     -> acpi_ns_validate_handle
    will reject this handle.
    
    However, if the value from the stack doesn't point to a valid
    address, we get this:

    The ramdisk device has logical_block_size 512 and max_sectors 255. The
    dm-integrity device uses logical_block_size 4096 and it doesn't affect the
    "max_sectors" value - thus, it inherits 255 from the ramdisk. So, we have
    a device with max_sectors not aligned on logical_block_size.
    
    The md-raid device sees that the underlying leg has max_sectors 255 and it
    will split the bios on 255-sector boundary, making the bios unaligned on
    logical_block_size.
    
    In order to fix the bug, we round down max_sectors to logical_block_size.

    scsi: sd: Fix Opal support
    
    commit aaf15f8c6de932861f1fce6aeec6a89ac0e354b6 upstream.
    
    The SCSI core has been modified recently such that it only processes PM
    requests if rpm_status != RPM_ACTIVE. Since some Opal requests are
    submitted while rpm_status != RPM_ACTIVE, set flag RQF_PM for Opal
    requests.

    Historically the BLKRRPART ioctls called into the now defunct ->revalidate
    method, which caused the sd driver to check if any media is present.
    When the ->revalidate method was removed this revalidation was lost,
    leading to lots of I/O errors when using the eject command.  Fix this by
    reopening the device to rescan the partitions, and thus calling the
    revalidation logic in the sd driver.

    Dan reported we're passing in GFP_NOIO to kvmalloc() which will then
    fallback to doing kmalloc() instead of an optional vmalloc() if the size
    exceeds kmalloc()s limits. This will break with drives that have zone
    numbers exceeding PAGE_SIZE/sizeof(u32).
    
    Instead of passing in GFP_NOIO, enter an implicit GFP_NOIO allocation
    scope.

      sysctl: pass kernel pointers to ->proc_handler
    
    we have been pre-allocating a buffer to copy the data from the proc
    handlers into, and then copying that to userspace.  The problem is this
    just blindly kzalloc()'s the buffer size passed in from the read, which in
    the case of our 'cat' binary was 64kib.  Order-4 allocations are not
    awesome, and since we can potentially allocate up to our maximum order, so
    use kvzalloc for these buffers.

    mm/rmap: fix potential pte_unmap on an not mapped pte
    
    [ Upstream commit 5d5d19eda6b0ee790af89c45e3f678345be6f50f ]
    
    For PMD-mapped page (usually THP), pvmw->pte is NULL.  For PTE-mapped THP,
    pvmw->pte is mapped.  But for HugeTLB pages, pvmw->pte is not mapped and
    set to the relevant page table entry.  So in page_vma_mapped_walk_done(),
    we may do pte_unmap() for HugeTLB pte which is not mapped.  Fix this by
    checking pvmw->page against PageHuge before trying to do pte_unmap().

    mm: fix memory_failure() handling of dax-namespace metadata
    
    [ Upstream commit 34dc45be4563f344d59ba0428416d0d265aa4f4d ]
    
    Given 'struct dev_pagemap' spans both data pages and metadata pages be
    careful to consult the altmap if present to delineate metadata.  In fact
    the pfn_first() helper already identifies the first valid data pfn, so
    export that helper for other code paths via pgmap_pfn_valid().
    
    Other usage of get_dev_pagemap() are not a concern because those are
    operating on known data pfns having been looked up by get_user_pages().
    I.e.  metadata pfns are never user mapped.

    i2c: exynos5: Preserve high speed master code
    
    [ Upstream commit f4ff0104d4c807a7f96aa3358c03d694895ee8ea ]
    
    When the driver starts to send a message with the MASTER_ID field
    set (high speed), the whole I2C_ADDR register is overwritten including
    MASTER_ID as the SLV_ADDR_MAS field is set.
    
    This patch preserves already written fields in I2C_ADDR when writing
    SLV_ADDR_MAS.

    arm64: Add missing ISB after invalidating TLB in __primary_switch
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d41053e8dc115c92b8002c3db5f545d7602498b ]
    
    Although there has been a bit of back and forth on the subject, it
    appears that invalidating TLBs requires an ISB instruction when FEAT_ETS
    is not implemented by the CPU.
    
    From the bible:
    
      | In an implementation that does not implement FEAT_ETS, a TLB
      | maintenance instruction executed by a PE, PEx, can complete at any
      | time after it is issued, but is only guaranteed to be finished for a
      | PE, PEx, after the execution of DSB by the PEx followed by a Context
      | synchronization event
    
    Add the missing ISB in __primary_switch, just in case.

    Following a similar reinstate for the KSZ9031.
    
    Older kernels would use the genphy_soft_reset if the PHY did not implement
    a .soft_reset.
    
    Bluntly removing that default may expose a lot of situations where various
    PHYs/board implementations won't recover on various changes.
    Like with this implementation during a 4.9.x to 5.4.x LTS transition.
    I think it's a good thing to remove unwanted soft resets but wonder if it
    did open a can of worms?
    
    Atleast this fixes one iMX6 FEC/RMII/8081 combo.

    mm/compaction: fix misbehaviors of fast_find_migrateblock()

    In the fast_find_migrateblock(), it iterates ocer the freelist to find the
    proper pageblock.  But there are some misbehaviors.
    
    First, if the page we found is equal to cc->migrate_pfn, it is considered
    that we didn't find a suitable pageblock.  Secondly, if the loop was
    terminated because order is less than PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER, it could be
    considered that we found a suitable one.  Thirdly, if the skip bit is set
    on the page block and we goto continue, it doesn't check nr_scanned.
    Fourthly, if the page block's skip bit is set, it checks that page block
    is the last of list, which is unnecessary.

    mm: memcontrol: fix NR_ANON_THPS accounting in charge moving
    
    [ Upstream commit b0ba3bff3e7bb6b58bb248bdd2f3d8ad52fd10c3 ]
    
    Patch series "Convert all THP vmstat counters to pages", v6.
    
    This patch series is aimed to convert all THP vmstat counters to pages.
    
    The unit of some vmstat counters are pages, some are bytes, some are
    HPAGE_PMD_NR, and some are KiB. When we want to expose these vmstat
    counters to the userspace, we have to know the unit of the vmstat counters
    is which one. When the unit is bytes or kB, both clearly distinguishable
    by the B/KB suffix. But for the THP vmstat counters, we may make mistakes.
    
    For example, the below is some bug fix for the THP vmstat counters:
    
      - 7de2e9f195b9 ("mm: memcontrol: correct the NR_ANON_THPS counter of hierarchical memcg")
      - The first commit in this series ("fix NR_ANON_THPS accounting in charge moving")
    
    This patch series can make the code clear. And make all the unit of the THP
    vmstat counters in pages. Finally, the unit of the vmstat counters are
    pages, kB and bytes. The B/KB suffix can tell us that the unit is bytes
    or kB. The rest which is without suffix are pages.
    
    In this series, I changed the following vmstat counters unit from HPAGE_PMD_NR
    to pages. However, there is no change to the print format of output to user
    space.
    
      - NR_ANON_THPS
      - NR_FILE_THPS
      - NR_SHMEM_THPS
      - NR_SHMEM_PMDMAPPED
      - NR_FILE_PMDMAPPED
    
    Doing this also can make the statistics more accuracy for the THP vmstat
    counters. This series is consistent with 8f182270dfec ("mm/swap.c: flush lru
    pvecs on compound page arrival").
    
    Because we use struct per_cpu_nodestat to cache the vmstat counters, which
    leads to inaccurate statistics especially THP vmstat counters. In the systems
    with hundreds of processors it can be GBs of memory. For example, for a 96
    CPUs system, the threshold is the maximum number of 125. And the per cpu
    counters can cache 23.4375 GB in total.
    
    The THP page is already a form of batched addition (it will add 512 worth of
    memory in one go) so skipping the batching seems like sensible. Although every
    THP stats update overflows the per-cpu counter, resorting to atomic global
    updates. But it can make the statistics more accuracy for the THP vmstat
    counters. From this point of view, I think that do this converting is
    reasonable.
    
    Thanks Hugh for mentioning this. This was inspired by Johannes and Roman.
    Thanks to them.
    
    This patch (of 7):

    ocfs2: fix a use after free on error
    
    [ Upstream commit c57d117f2b2f2a19b570c36f2819ef8d8210af20 ]
    
    The error handling in this function frees "reg" but it is still on the
    "o2hb_all_regions" list so it will lead to a use after freew.  Joseph Qi
    points out that we need to clear the bit in the "o2hb_region_bitmap" as
    well

    net: stmmac: fix CBS idleslope and sendslope calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 24877687b375f2c476ffb726ea915fc85df09e3d ]
    
    When link speed is not 100 Mbps, port transmit rate and speed divider
    are set to 8 and 1000000 respectively. These values are incorrect for
    CBS idleslope and sendslope HW values calculation if the link speed is
    not 1 Gbps.
    
    This patch adds switch statement to set the values of port transmit rate
    and speed divider for 10 Gbps, 5 Gbps, 2.5 Gbps, 1 Gbps, and 100 Mbps.
    Note that CBS is not supported at 10 Mbps.

    ice: Account for port VLAN in VF max packet size calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit a6aa7c8f998f4afddd73410aa043dad38162ce9e ]
    
    Currently if an AVF driver doesn't account for the possibility of a
    port VLAN when determining its max packet size then packets at MTU will
    be dropped. It is not the VF driver's responsibility to account for a
    port VLAN so fix this. To fix this, do the following:
    
    1. Add a function that determines the max packet size a VF is allowed by
       using the port's max packet size and whether the VF is in a port
       VLAN. If a port VLAN is configured then a VF's max packet size will
       always be the port's max packet size minus VLAN_HLEN. Otherwise it
       will be the port's max packet size.
    
    2. Use this function to verify the max packet size from the VF.
    
    3. If there is a port VLAN configured then add 4 bytes (VLAN_HLEN) to
       the VF's max packet size configuration.
    
    Also, the VIRTCHNL_OP_GET_VF_RESOURCES message provides the capability
    to communicate a VF's max packet size. Use the new function for this
    purpose.

    pwm: iqs620a: Fix overflow and optimize calculations
    
    [ Upstream commit 72d6b2459dbd539c1369149e501fdc3dc8ddef16 ]
    
    If state->duty_cycle is 0x100000000000000, the previous calculation of
    duty_scale overflows and yields a duty cycle ratio of 0% instead of
    100%. Fix this by clamping the requested duty cycle to the maximal
    possible duty cycle first. This way it is possible to use a native
    integer division instead of a (depending on the architecture) more
    expensive 64bit division.
    
    With this change in place duty_scale cannot be bigger than 256 which
    allows to simplify the calculation of duty_val.

    When creating VFs they were sometimes not getting resources.
    It was caused by not executing i40e_reset_all_vfs due to
    flag __I40E_VF_DISABLE being set on PF. Because of this
    IAVF was never able to finish setup sequence never
    getting reset indication from PF.
    Changed test_and_set_bit __I40E_VF_DISABLE in
    i40e_sync_filters_subtask to test_bit and removed clear_bit.
    This function should not set this bit it should only check

    i40e: Fix flow for IPv6 next header (extension header)
    
    [ Upstream commit 92c6058024e87087cf1b99b0389d67c0a886360e ]
    
    When a packet contains an IPv6 header with next header which is
    an extension header and not a protocol one, the kernel function
    skb_transport_header called with such sk_buff will return a
    pointer to the extension header and not to the TCP one.
    
    The above explained call caused a problem with packet processing
    for skb with encapsulation for tunnel with I40E_TX_CTX_EXT_IP_IPV6.
    The extension header was not skipped at all.
    
    The ipv6_skip_exthdr function does check if next header of the IPV6
    header is an extension header and doesn't modify the l4_proto pointer
    if it points to a protocol header value so its safe to omit the
    comparison of exthdr and l4.hdr pointers. The ipv6_skip_exthdr can
    return value -1. This means that the skipping process failed
    and there is something wrong with the packet so it will be dropped.

    regmap: sdw: use _no_pm functions in regmap_read/write
    
    [ Upstream commit d288a5712ef961e16d588bbdb2d846e00b5ef154 ]
    
    sdw_update_slave_status will be invoked when a codec is attached,
    and the codec driver will initialize the codec with regmap functions
    while the codec device is pm_runtime suspended.
    
    regmap routines currently rely on regular SoundWire IO functions,
    which will call pm_runtime_get_sync()/put_autosuspend.
    
    This causes a deadlock where the resume routine waits for an
    initialization complete signal that while the initialization complete
    can only be reached when the resume completes.
    
    The only solution if we allow regmap functions to be used in resume
    operations as well as during codec initialization is to use _no_pm
    routines. The duty of making sure the bus is operational needs to be
    handled above the regmap level.

    soundwire: bus: fix confusion on device used by pm_runtime
    
    [ Upstream commit 973794e85610d9a716a897baa9007ff56e192826 ]
    
    Intel stress-tests routinely report IO timeouts and invalid power
    management transitions. Upon further analysis, we seem to be using the
    wrong devices in pm_runtime calls.
    
    Before reading and writing registers, we first need to make sure the
    Slave is fully resumed. The existing code attempts to do such that,
    however because of a confusion dating from 2017 and copy/paste, we
    end-up resuming the parent only instead of resuming the codec device.
    
    This can lead to accesses to the Slave registers while the bus is
    still being configured and the Slave not enumerated, and as a result
    IO errors occur.
    
    This is a classic problem, similar confusions happened for HDaudio
    between bus and codec device, leading to power management issues.
    
    Fix by using the relevant device for all uses of pm_runtime functions.

    nvmem: core: skip child nodes not matching binding
    
    [ Upstream commit 0445efacec75b85c2a3c176957ee050ba9be53f0 ]
    
    The nvmem cell binding applies to all eeprom child nodes matching
    "^.*@[0-9a-f]+$" without taking a compatible into account.
    
    Linux drivers, like at24, are even more extensive and assume
    _all_ at24 eeprom child nodes to be nvmem cells since e888d445ac33
    ("nvmem: resolve cells from DT at registration time").
    
    Since df5f3b6f5357 ("dt-bindings: nvmem: stm32: new property for
    data access"), the additionalProperties: True means it's Ok to have
    other properties as long as they don't match "^.*@[0-9a-f]+$".
    
    The barebox bootloader extends the MTD partitions binding to
    EEPROM and can fix up following device tree node:
    
      &eeprom {
        partitions {
          compatible = "fixed-partitions";
        };
      };
    
    This is allowed binding-wise, but drivers using nvmem_register()
    like at24 will fail to parse because the function expects all child
    nodes to have a reg property present. This results in the whole
    EEPROM driver probe failing despite the device tree being correct.
    
    Fix this by skipping nodes lacking a reg property instead of
    returning an error. This effectively makes the drivers adhere
    to the binding because all nodes with a unit address must have
    a reg property and vice versa.

    ext4: fix potential htree index checksum corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit b5776e7524afbd4569978ff790864755c438bba7 ]
    
    In the case where we need to do an interior node split, and
    immediately afterwards, we are unable to allocate a new directory leaf
    block due to ENOSPC, the directory index checksum's will not be filled
    in correctly (and indeed, will not be correctly journalled).
    
    This looks like a bug that was introduced when we added largedir
    support.  The original code doesn't make any sense (and should have
    been caught in code review), but it was hidden because most of the
    time, the index node checksum will be set by do_split().  But if
    do_split bails out due to ENOSPC, then ext4_handle_dirty_dx_node()
    won't get called, and so the directory index checksum field will not
    get set, leading to:
    
    EXT4-fs error (device sdb): dx_probe:858: inode #6635543: block 4022: comm nfsd: Directory index failed checksum

    1. Trigger the unplug event in msm_dp_display_disable() to shutdown audio
       properly.
    2. Reset the completion before signal the disconnect event.

    This is because lockdep thinks all the locks taken in lock_crtcs() are
    the same lock, when they actually aren't. That's because we call
    mutex_init() in msm_kms_init() and that assigns one static key for every
    lock initialized in this loop. Let's allocate a dynamic number of
    lock_class_keys and assign them to each lock so that lockdep can figure
    out an AA deadlock isn't possible here.

    drm/msm: Fix races managing the OOB state for timestamp vs timestamps.
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f98b33b04c02c0d9088c7486c59d058696782f9 ]
    
    Now that we're not racing with GPU setup, also fix races of timestamps
    against other timestamps.  In freedreno CI, we were seeing this path trigger
    timeouts on setting the GMU bit, producing:
    
    [drm:_a6xx_gmu_set_oob] *ERROR* Timeout waiting for GMU OOB set GPU_SET: 0x0
    
    and this triggered especially on the first set of tests right after
    boot (it's probably easier to lose the race than one might think,
    given that we start many tests in parallel, and waiting for NFS to
    page in code probably means that lots of tests hit the same point of
    screen init at the same time).  As of this patch, the message seems to
    have completely gone away.

    [ Upstream commit 68e4f01fddb4ead80e8c7084db489307f22c9cbb ]
    
    Before the offending commit in msm_atomic_commit_tail wait_flush was
    called once per frame, after the commit was submitted. After it
    wait_flush is also called at the beginning to ensure previous
    potentially async commits are done.
    
    For cmd panels the source of wait_flush is a ping-pong irq notifying
    a completion. The completion needs to be notified with complete_all so
    multiple waiting parties (new async committers) can proceed.

    Domain attribute setting for LLCC is guarded by !IS_ERR
    check which works fine only when CONFIG_QCOM_LLCC=y but
    when it is disabled, the LLCC apis return NULL and that
    is not handled by IS_ERR check. Due to this, domain attribute
    for LLCC will be set even on GPUs which do not support it
    and cause issues, so correct this by using IS_ERR_OR_NULL
    checks appropriately. Meanwhile also cleanup comment block
    and remove unwanted blank line.

    pwm: rockchip: Eliminate potential race condition when probing
    
    [ Upstream commit d21ba5d6217bd5a6a696678385906ed1994b380b ]
    
    Commit 48cf973cae33 ("pwm: rockchip: Avoid glitches on already running
    PWMs") introduced a potential race condition in rockchip_pwm_probe(): A
    consumer could enable an inactive PWM, or disable a running one, between
    rockchip_pwm_probe() registering the device via pwmchip_add() and checking
    whether it is enabled (to determine whether it was started by a
    bootloader). This could result in a device's PWM clock being either enabled
    once more than necessary, potentially causing it to continue running when
    no longer needed, or disabled once more than necessary, producing a warning
    from the kernel.
    
    Eliminate these possibilities by modifying rockchip_pwm_probe() so it
    checks whether a device is enabled before registering it rather than after.

    [ Upstream commit d5d8d675865ccddfe4da26c85f22c55cec663bf2 ]
    
    If rockchip_pwm_probe() fails to register a PWM device it calls
    clk_unprepare() for the device's PWM clock, without having first disabled
    the clock and before jumping to an error handler that also unprepares
    it. This is likely to produce warnings from the kernel about the clock
    being unprepared when it is still enabled, and then being unprepared when
    it has already been unprepared.
    
    Prevent these warnings by removing this unnecessary call to
    clk_unprepare().

    Commit 457f74abbed0 ("pwm: rockchip: Keep enabled PWMs running while
    probing") modified rockchip_pwm_probe() to access a PWM device's registers
    directly to check whether or not the device is enabled, but did not also
    change the function so it first enables the device's APB clock to be
    certain the device can respond. This risks hanging the kernel on systems
    with PWM devices that use more than a single clock.
    
    Avoid this by enabling the device's APB clock before accessing its
    registers (and disabling the clock when register access is complete).

    soundwire: cadence: fix ACK/NAK handling
    
    [ Upstream commit db9d9f944f95e7f3aa60ac00cbd502415152c421 ]
    
    The existing code reports a NAK only when ACK=0
    This is not aligned with the SoundWire 1.x specifications.
    
    Table 32 in the SoundWire 1.2 specification shows that a Device shall
    not set NAK=1 if ACK=1. But Table 33 shows the Combined Response
    may very well be NAK=1/ACK=1, e.g. if another Device than the one
    addressed reports a parity error.
    
    NAK=1 signals a 'Command_Aborted', regardless of the ACK bit value.
    
    Move the tests for NAK so that the NAK=1/ACK=1 combination is properly
    detected according to the specification.

    misc: eeprom_93xx46: Add module alias to avoid breaking support for non device tree users
    
    [ Upstream commit 4540b9fbd8ebb21bb3735796d300a1589ee5fbf2 ]
    
    Module alias "spi:93xx46" is used by non device tree users like
    drivers/misc/eeprom/digsy_mtc_eeprom.c  and removing it will
    break support for them.
    
    Fix this by adding back the module alias "spi:93xx46".

    NORMAL (0x0) and IDLE (0x4) are really two different states.  Hence you

    dwfl_report_elf().

    perf record: Fix continue profiling after draining the buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit e16c2ce7c5ed5de881066c1fd10ba5c09af69559 ]
    
    Commit da231338ec9c0987 ("perf record: Use an eventfd to wakeup when
    done") uses eventfd() to solve a rare race where the setting and
    checking of 'done' which add done_fd to pollfd.  When draining buffer,
    revents of done_fd is 0 and evlist__filter_pollfd function returns a
    non-zero value.  As a result, perf record does not stop profiling.
    
    The following simple scenarios can trigger this condition:
    
      # sleep 10 &
      # perf record -p $!
    
    After the sleep process exits, perf record should stop profiling and exit.
    However, perf record keeps running.
    
    If pollfd revents contains only POLLERR or POLLHUP, perf record
    indicates that buffer is draining and need to stop profiling.  Use
    fdarray_flag__nonfilterable() to set done eventfd to nonfilterable
    objects, so that evlist__filter_pollfd() does not filter and check done
    eventfd.

    RDMA/rtrs-srv: Do not pass a valid pointer to PTR_ERR()
    
    [ Upstream commit ed408529679737a9a7ad816c8de5d59ba104bb11 ]
    
    smatch gives the warning:
    
      drivers/infiniband/ulp/rtrs/rtrs-srv.c:1805 rtrs_rdma_connect() warn: passing zero to 'PTR_ERR'
    
    Which is trying to say smatch has shown that srv is not an error pointer
    and thus cannot be passed to PTR_ERR.
    
    The solution is to move the list_add() down after full initilization of
    rtrs_srv. To avoid holding the srv_mutex too long, only hold it during the
    list operation as suggested by Leon.

    It is caused by the not-freed kobject of rtrs_srv_sess.  The kobject
    embedded in rtrs_srv_sess has ref-counter 2 after calling
    process_info_req(). Therefore it must call kobject_put twice.  Currently
    it calls kobject_put only once at rtrs_srv_destroy_sess_files because
    kobject_del removes the state_in_sysfs flag and then kobject_put in
    free_sess() is not called.
    
    This patch moves kobject_del() into free_sess() so that the kobject of
    rtrs_srv_sess can be freed. And also this patch adds the missing call of
    sysfs_remove_group() to clean-up the sysfs directory.

    RDMA/rtrs: Only allow addition of path to an already established session
    
    [ Upstream commit 03e9b33a0fd677f554b03352646c13459bf60458 ]
    
    While adding a path from the client side to an already established
    session, it was possible to provide the destination IP to a different
    server. This is dangerous.
    
    This commit adds an extra member to the rtrs_msg_conn_req structure, named
    first_conn; which is supposed to notify if the connection request is the
    first for that session or not.
    
    On the server side, if a session does not exist but the first_conn
    received inside the rtrs_msg_conn_req structure is 1, the connection
    request is failed. This signifies that the connection request is for an
    already existing session, and since the server did not find one, it is an
    wrong connection request.

    RDMA/ucma: Fix use-after-free bug in ucma_create_uevent
    
    [ Upstream commit fe454dc31e84f8c14cb8942fcb61666c9f40745b ]
    
    ucma_process_join() allocates struct ucma_multicast mc and frees it if an
    error occurs during its run.  Specifically, if an error occurs in
    copy_to_user(), a use-after-free might happen in the following scenario:
    
    1. mc struct is allocated.
    2. rdma_join_multicast() is called and succeeds. During its run,
       cma_iboe_join_multicast() enqueues a work that will later use the
       aforementioned mc struct.
    3. copy_to_user() is called and fails.
    4. mc struct is deallocated.
    5. The work that was enqueued by cma_iboe_join_multicast() is run and
       calls ucma_create_uevent() which tries to access mc struct (which is
       freed by now).
    
    Fix this bug by cancelling the work enqueued by cma_iboe_join_multicast().
    Since cma_work_handler() frees struct cma_work, we don't use it in
    cma_iboe_join_multicast() so we can safely cancel the work later.
    
    The following syzkaller report revealed it:

    ceph: fix flush_snap logic after putting caps
    
    [ Upstream commit 64f36da5625f7f9853b86750eaa89d499d16a2e9 ]
    
    A primary reason for skipping ceph_check_caps after putting the
    references was to avoid the locking in ceph_check_caps during a
    reconnect. __ceph_put_cap_refs can still call ceph_flush_snaps in that
    case though, and that takes many of the same inconvenient locks.
    
    Fix the logic in __ceph_put_cap_refs to skip flushing snaps when the
    skip_checking_caps flag is set.

    svcrdma: Hold private mutex while invoking rdma_accept()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ac24c320c4d89a9de6ec802591398b8675c7b3c ]
    
    RDMA core mutex locking was restructured by commit d114c6feedfe
    ("RDMA/cma: Add missing locking to rdma_accept()") [Aug 2020]. When
    lock debugging is enabled, the RPC/RDMA server trips over the new
    lockdep assertion in rdma_accept() because it doesn't call
    rdma_accept() from its CM event handler.
    
    As a temporary fix, have svc_rdma_accept() take the handler_mutex
    explicitly. In the meantime, let's consider how to restructure the
    RPC/RDMA transport to invoke rdma_accept() from the proper context.
    
    Calls to svc_rdma_accept() are serialized with calls to
    svc_rdma_free() by the generic RPC server layer.

    nfsd: register pernet ops last, unregister first
    
    [ Upstream commit bd5ae9288d6451bd346a1b4a59d4fe7e62ba29b7 ]
    
    These pernet operations may depend on stuff set up or torn down in the
    module init/exit functions.  And they may be called at any time in
    between.  So it makes more sense for them to be the last to be
    registered in the init function, and the first to be unregistered in the
    exit function.
    
    In particular, without this, the drc slab is being destroyed before all
    the per-net drcs are shut down, resulting in an "Objects remaining in
    nfsd_drc on __kmem_cache_shutdown()" warning in exit_nfsd.

    [ Upstream commit 77771a97011fa9146ccfaf2983a3a2885dc57b6f ]
    
    The first time dso__load() was called on a PE file it always returned -1
    error. This caused the first call to map__find_symbol() to always fail
    on a PE file so the first sample from each PE file always had symbol
    <unknown>. Subsequent samples succeed however because the DSO is already
    loaded.
    
    This fixes dso__load() to return 0 when successfully loading a DSO with
    libbfd.

    printk: avoid prb_first_valid_seq() where possible
    
    [ Upstream commit 13791c80b0cdf54d92fc54221cdf490683b109de ]
    
    If message sizes average larger than expected (more than 32
    characters), the data_ring will wrap before the desc_ring. Once the
    data_ring wraps, it will start invalidating descriptors. These
    invalid descriptors hang around until they are eventually recycled
    when the desc_ring wraps. Readers do not care about invalid
    descriptors, but they still need to iterate past them. If the
    average message size is much larger than 32 characters, then there
    will be many invalid descriptors preceding the valid descriptors.
    
    The function prb_first_valid_seq() always begins at the oldest
    descriptor and searches for the first valid descriptor. This can
    be rather expensive for the above scenario. And, in fact, because
    of its heavy usage in /dev/kmsg, there have been reports of long
    delays and even RCU stalls.
    
    For code that does not need to search from the oldest record,
    replace prb_first_valid_seq() usage with prb_read_valid_*()
    functions, which provide a start sequence number to search from.

    regulator: bd718x7, bd71828, Fix dvs voltage levels
    
    [ Upstream commit c294554111a835598b557db789d9ad2379b512a2 ]
    
    The ROHM BD718x7 and BD71828 drivers support setting HW state
    specific voltages from device-tree. This is used also by various
    in-tree DTS files.
    
    These drivers do incorrectly try to compose bit-map using enum
    values. By a chance this works for first two valid levels having
    values 1 and 2 - but setting values for the rest of the levels
    do indicate capability of setting values for first levels as
    well. Luckily the regulators which support setting values for
    SUSPEND/LPSR do usually also support setting values for RUN
    and IDLE too - thus this has not been such a fatal issue.
    
    Fix this by defining the old enum values as bits and fixing the
    parsing code. This allows keeping existing IC specific drivers
    intact and only slightly changing the rohm-regulator.c

    [ Upstream commit 60a707d0c99aff4eadb7fd334c5fd21df386723e ]
    
    Since de78a9c42a79 ("powerpc: Add a framework for Kernel Userspace
    Access Protection"), user access helpers call user_{read|write}_access_{begin|end}
    when user space access is allowed.
    
    Commit 890274c2dc4c ("powerpc/64s: Implement KUAP for Radix MMU") made
    the mentioned helpers program a AMR special register to allow such
    access for a short period of time, most of the time AMR is expected to
    block user memory access by the kernel.
    
    Since the code accesses the user space memory, unsafe_get_user() calls
    might_fault() which calls arch_local_irq_restore() if either
    CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING or CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is enabled.
    arch_local_irq_restore() then attempts to replay pending soft
    interrupts as KUAP regions have hardware interrupts enabled.
    
    If a pending interrupt happens to do user access (performance
    interrupts do that), it enables access for a short period of time so
    after returning from the replay, the user access state remains blocked
    and if a user page fault happens - "Bug: Read fault blocked by AMR!"
    appears and SIGSEGV is sent.
    
    An example trace:
      Bug: Read fault blocked by AMR!

    powerpc/uaccess: Avoid might_fault() when user access is enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d506ca97b665b95e698a53697dad99fae813c1a ]
    
    The amount of code executed with enabled user space access (unlocked
    KUAP) should be minimal. However with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING or
    CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP enabled, might_fault() calls into various
    parts of the kernel, and may even end up replaying interrupts which in
    turn may access user space and forget to restore the KUAP state.
    
    The problem places are:
      1. strncpy_from_user (and similar) which unlock KUAP and call
         unsafe_get_user -> __get_user_allowed -> __get_user_nocheck()
         with do_allow=false to skip KUAP as the caller took care of it.
      2. __unsafe_put_user_goto() which is called with unlocked KUAP.
    
    eg:
      WARNING: CPU: 30 PID: 1 at arch/powerpc/include/asm/book3s/64/kup.h:324 arch_local_irq_restore+0x160/0x190
      NIP arch_local_irq_restore+0x160/0x190
      LR  lock_is_held_type+0x140/0x200
      Call Trace:
        0xc00000007f392ff8 (unreliable)
        ___might_sleep+0x180/0x320
        __might_fault+0x50/0xe0
        filldir64+0x2d0/0x5d0
        call_filldir+0xc8/0x180
        ext4_readdir+0x948/0xb40
        iterate_dir+0x1ec/0x240
        sys_getdents64+0x80/0x290
        system_call_exception+0x160/0x280
        system_call_common+0xf0/0x27c
    
    Change __get_user_nocheck() to look at `do_allow` to decide whether to
    skip might_fault(). Since strncpy_from_user/etc call might_fault()
    anyway before unlocking KUAP, there should be no visible change.
    
    Drop might_fault() in __unsafe_put_user_goto() as it is only called
    from unsafe_put_user(), which already has KUAP unlocked.
    
    Since keeping might_fault() is still desirable for debugging, add
    calls to it in user_[read|write]_access_begin(). That also allows us
    to drop the is_kernel_addr() test, because there should be no code
    using user_[read|write]_access_begin() in order to access a kernel
    address.

    If a driver registers a divider clock with a parent_hw instead of the
    parent_name, the parent_hw is ignored and the clock does not have a
    parent.

    RDMA/hns: Avoid filling sgid index when modifying QP to RTR
    
    [ Upstream commit 773f841ab1aeb0134e3872eb3545592732db8218 ]
    
    ULP usually set IB(V)_QP_AV when trying to modify QP to RTR if they want
    to record sgid index into QPC. For UD QPs, it is useless because it will
    be included in WQE. For RC QPs, it will be filled in
    hns_roce_set_path(). So sgid index shouldn't be filled by default. Then
    hns_get_gid_index() is moved to hns_roce_hw_v1.c because it is only called
    in it.

    RDMA/hns: Allocate one more recv SGE for HIP08
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dd052474a2645b2a6171d19ad17b05b180d446d ]
    
    The RQ/SRQ of HIP08 needs one special sge to stop receive reliably. So the
    driver needs to allocate at least one SGE when creating RQ/SRQ and ensure
    that at least one SGE is filled with the special value during post_recv.
    
    Besides, the kernel driver should only do this for kernel ULP. For
    userspace ULP, the userspace driver will allocate the reserved SGE in
    buffer, and the kernel driver just needs to pin the corresponding size of
    memory based on the userspace driver's requirements.

    kselftests: dmabuf-heaps: Fix Makefile's inclusion of the kernel's usr/include dir
    
    [ Upstream commit 64ba3d591c9d2be2a9c09e99b00732afe002ad0d ]
    
    Copied in from somewhere else, the makefile was including
    the kerne's usr/include dir, which caused the asm/ioctl.h file
    to be used.
    
    Unfortunately, that file has different values for _IOC_SIZEBITS
    and _IOC_WRITE than include/uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h which then
    causes the _IOCW macros to give the wrong ioctl numbers,
    specifically for DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC.
    
    This patch simply removes the extra include from the Makefile

    clk: qcom: gcc-msm8998: Fix Alpha PLL type for all GPLLs
    
    [ Upstream commit 292f75ecff07e8a07fe2e3e19b4b567d0b698842 ]
    
    All of the GPLLs in the MSM8998 Global Clock Controller are Fabia PLLs
    and not generic alphas: this was producing bad effects over the entire
    clock tree of MSM8998, where any GPLL child clock was declaring a false
    clock rate, due to their parent also showing the same.
    
    The issue resides in the calculation of the clock rate for the specific
    Alpha PLL type, where Fabia has a different register layout; switching
    the MSM8998 GPLLs to the correct Alpha Fabia PLL type fixes the rate
    (calculation) reading. While at it, also make these PLLs fixed since
    their rate is supposed to *never* be changed while the system runs, as
    this would surely crash the entire SoC.
    
    Now all the children of all the PLLs are also complying with their
    specified clock table and system stability is improved.

    powerpc/sstep: Fix load-store and update emulation
    
    [ Upstream commit bbda4b6c7d7c7f79da71f95c92a5d76be22c3efd ]
    
    The Power ISA says that the fixed-point load and update instructions
    must neither use R0 for the base address (RA) nor have the
    destination (RT) and the base address (RA) as the same register.
    Similarly, for fixed-point stores and floating-point loads and stores,
    the instruction is invalid when R0 is used as the base address (RA).
    
    This is applicable to the following instructions.
      * Load Byte and Zero with Update (lbzu)
      * Load Byte and Zero with Update Indexed (lbzux)
      * Load Halfword and Zero with Update (lhzu)
      * Load Halfword and Zero with Update Indexed (lhzux)
      * Load Halfword Algebraic with Update (lhau)
      * Load Halfword Algebraic with Update Indexed (lhaux)
      * Load Word and Zero with Update (lwzu)
      * Load Word and Zero with Update Indexed (lwzux)
      * Load Word Algebraic with Update Indexed (lwaux)
      * Load Doubleword with Update (ldu)
      * Load Doubleword with Update Indexed (ldux)
      * Load Floating Single with Update (lfsu)
      * Load Floating Single with Update Indexed (lfsux)
      * Load Floating Double with Update (lfdu)
      * Load Floating Double with Update Indexed (lfdux)
      * Store Byte with Update (stbu)
      * Store Byte with Update Indexed (stbux)
      * Store Halfword with Update (sthu)
      * Store Halfword with Update Indexed (sthux)
      * Store Word with Update (stwu)
      * Store Word with Update Indexed (stwux)
      * Store Doubleword with Update (stdu)
      * Store Doubleword with Update Indexed (stdux)
      * Store Floating Single with Update (stfsu)
      * Store Floating Single with Update Indexed (stfsux)
      * Store Floating Double with Update (stfdu)
      * Store Floating Double with Update Indexed (stfdux)
    
    E.g. the following behaviour is observed for an invalid load and
    update instruction having RA = RT.
    
    While a userspace program having an instruction word like 0xe9ce0001,
    i.e. ldu r14, 0(r14), runs without getting receiving a SIGILL on a
    Power system (observed on P8 and P9), the outcome of executing that
    instruction word varies and its behaviour can be considered to be
    undefined.
    
    Attaching an uprobe at that instruction's address results in emulation
    which currently performs the load as well as writes the effective
    address back to the base register. This might not match the outcome
    from hardware.
    
    To remove any inconsistencies, this adds additional checks for the
    aforementioned instructions to make sure that the emulation
    infrastructure treats them as unknown. The kernel can then fallback to
    executing such instructions on hardware.

    [ Upstream commit 768d70e19ba525debd571b36e6d0ab19956c63d7 ]
    
    dlpar_configure_connector() has two problems in its handling of

    1. When the status is -2 (busy, call again), we call
       ibm,configure-connector again immediately without checking whether
       to schedule, which can result in monopolizing the CPU.
    2. Extended delay status (9900..9905) goes completely unhandled,
       causing the configuration to unnecessarily terminate.
    
    Fix both of these issues by using rtas_busy_delay().

    A recent fix improved the way the resource gets passed to
    the low-level accessors, but left one warning that appears
    in configurations with a resource_size_t that is wider than
    a pointer:
    
    In file included from drivers/mfd/altera-sysmgr.c:19:
    drivers/mfd/altera-sysmgr.c: In function 'sysmgr_probe':

    I had tried a different approach that would store the address
    in the private data as a phys_addr_t, but the easiest solution
    now seems to be to add a double cast to shut up the warning.
    
    As the address is passed to an inline assembly, it is guaranteed
    to not be wider than a register anyway.

    RDMA/rxe: Correct skb on loopback path
    
    [ Upstream commit 5120bf0a5fc15dec210a0fe0f39e4a256bb6e349 ]
    
    rxe_net.c sends packets at the IP layer with skb->data pointing at the IP
    header but receives packets from a UDP tunnel with skb->data pointing at
    the UDP header.  On the loopback path this was not correctly accounted
    for.  This patch corrects for this by using sbk_pull() to strip the IP
    header from the skb on received packets.

    RDMA/rxe: Fix coding error in rxe_rcv_mcast_pkt
    
    [ Upstream commit 8fc1b7027fc162738d5a85c82410e501a371a404 ]
    
    rxe_rcv_mcast_pkt() in rxe_recv.c can leak SKBs in error path code. The
    loop over the QPs attached to a multicast group creates new cloned SKBs
    for all but the last QP in the list and passes the SKB and its clones to
    rxe_rcv_pkt() for further processing. Any QPs that do not pass some checks
    are skipped.  If the last QP in the list fails the tests the SKB is
    leaked.  This patch checks if the SKB for the last QP was used and if not
    frees it. Also removes a redundant loop invariant assignment.

    perf tools: Fix DSO filtering when not finding a map for a sampled address
    
    [ Upstream commit c69bf11ad3d30b6bf01cfa538ddff1a59467c734 ]
    
    When we lookup an address and don't find a map we should filter that
    sample if the user specified a list of --dso entries to filter on, fix
    it.
    
    Before:
    
      $ perf script
                 sleep 274800  2843.556162:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb26bff4 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556168:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b047d [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556171:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2706b2 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556174:          6 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b0267 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556176:         59 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b03b1 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556180:        691 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb26bff4 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556189:       9160 cycles:u:      7fa9550eeaa3 __GI___tunables_init+0xf3 (/usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so)
                 sleep 274800  2843.556312:      86937 cycles:u:      7fa9550e157b _dl_lookup_symbol_x+0x4b (/usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so)
      $
    
    So we have some samples we somehow didn't find in a map for, if we now
    do:
    
      $ perf report --stdio --dso /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      # dso: /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      #
      # Total Lost Samples: 0
      #
      # Samples: 8  of event 'cycles:u'
      # Event count (approx.): 96856
      #
      # Overhead  Command  Symbol
      # ........  .......  ........................
      #
          89.76%  sleep    [.] _dl_lookup_symbol_x
           9.46%  sleep    [.] __GI___tunables_init
           0.71%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb26bff4
           0.06%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b03b1
           0.01%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b0267
           0.00%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2706b2
           0.00%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b047d
      $
    
    After this patch we get the right output with just entries for the DSOs
    specified in --dso:
    
      $ perf report --stdio --dso /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      # dso: /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      #
      # Total Lost Samples: 0
      #
      # Samples: 8  of event 'cycles:u'
      # Event count (approx.): 96856
      #

      # ........  .......  ........................
      #
          89.76%  sleep    [.] _dl_lookup_symbol_x
           9.46%  sleep    [.] __GI___tunables_init
      $
      #

    [ Upstream commit ddd0521549a975e6148732d6ca6b89ffa862c0e5 ]
    
    The Xilinx zynqmp RTC driver makes use of IOMEM functions like
    devm_platform_ioremap_resource(), which are only available if
    CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM is defined.
    
    This causes the driver not to be enable under make ARCH=um allyesconfig,
    even though it won't build.
    
    By adding a dependency on HAS_IOMEM, the driver will not be enabled on
    architectures which don't support it.

    tracepoint: Do not fail unregistering a probe due to memory failure
    
    [ Upstream commit befe6d946551d65cddbd32b9cb0170b0249fd5ed ]
    
    The list of tracepoint callbacks is managed by an array that is protected
    by RCU. To update this array, a new array is allocated, the updates are
    copied over to the new array, and then the list of functions for the
    tracepoint is switched over to the new array. After a completion of an RCU
    grace period, the old array is freed.
    
    This process happens for both adding a callback as well as removing one.
    But on removing a callback, if the new array fails to be allocated, the
    callback is not removed, and may be used after it is freed by the clients
    of the tracepoint.
    
    There's really no reason to fail if the allocation for a new array fails
    when removing a function. Instead, the function can simply be replaced by a
    stub function that could be cleaned up on the next modification of the
    array. That is, instead of calling the function registered to the
    tracepoint, it would call a stub function in its place.

    Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20201118093405.7a6d2290@gandalf.local.home
    
    [ Note, this version does use undefined compiler behavior (assuming that
      a stub function with no parameters or return, can be called by a location
      that thinks it has parameters but still no return value. Static calls
      do the same thing, so this trick is not without precedent.
    
      There's another solution that uses RCU tricks and is more complex, but
      can be an alternative if this solution becomes an issue.

    In the end of __iommu_map, It alway call iotlb_sync_map.
    
    This patch moves iotlb_sync_map out from __iommu_map since it is

    is flush tlb all currently. Add a little helper _iommu_map for this.

    amba: Fix resource leak for drivers without .remove
    
    [ Upstream commit de5d7adb89367bbc87b4e5ce7afe7ae9bd86dc12 ]
    
    Consider an amba driver with a .probe but without a .remove callback (e.g.
    pl061_gpio_driver). The function amba_probe() is called to bind a device
    and so dev_pm_domain_attach() and others are called. As there is no remove
    callback amba_remove() isn't called at unbind time however and so calling
    dev_pm_domain_detach() is missed and the pm domain keeps active.
    
    To fix this always use the core driver callbacks and handle missing amba
    callbacks there. For probe refuse registration as a driver without probe
    doesn't make sense.

    [ Upstream commit 9d909f1b1e91b4aa7d016ed14b7b76dbf2675414 ]
    
    The MIPI i3c HCI driver makes use of IOMEM functions like
    devm_platform_ioremap_resource(), which are only available if
    CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM is defined.
    
    This causes the driver to be enabled under make ARCH=um allyesconfig,
    even though it won't build.
    
    By adding a dependency on HAS_IOMEM, the driver will not be enabled on
    architectures which don't support it.

    ARM: 9046/1: decompressor: Do not clear SCTLR.nTLSMD for ARMv7+ cores
    
    [ Upstream commit 2acb909750431030b65a0a2a17fd8afcbd813a84 ]
    
    It was observed that decompressor running on hardware implementing ARM v8.2
    Load/Store Multiple Atomicity and Ordering Control (LSMAOC), say, as guest,
    would stuck just after:
    
    Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.
    
    The reason is that it clears nTLSMD bit when disabling caches:
    
      nTLSMD, bit [3]
    
      When ARMv8.2-LSMAOC is implemented:
    
        No Trap Load Multiple and Store Multiple to
        Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory.
    
        0b0 All memory accesses by A32 and T32 Load Multiple and Store
            Multiple at EL1 or EL0 that are marked at stage 1 as
            Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory are trapped and
            generate a stage 1 Alignment fault.
    
        0b1 All memory accesses by A32 and T32 Load Multiple and Store
            Multiple at EL1 or EL0 that are marked at stage 1 as
            Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory are not trapped.
    
      This bit is permitted to be cached in a TLB.
    
      This field resets to 1.
    
      Otherwise:
    
      Reserved, RES1
    
    So as effect we start getting traps we are not quite ready for.
    
    Looking into history it seems that mask used for SCTLR clear came from
    the similar code for ARMv4, where bit[3] is the enable/disable bit for
    the write buffer. That not applicable to ARMv7 and onwards, so retire
    that bit from the masks.

    IB/umad: Return EPOLLERR in case of when device disassociated
    
    [ Upstream commit def4cd43f522253645b72c97181399c241b54536 ]
    
    Currently, polling a umad device will always works, even if the device was
    disassociated. A disassociated device should immediately return EPOLLERR
    from poll(). Otherwise userspace is endlessly hung on poll() with no idea
    that the device has been removed from the system.

    RDMA/mlx5: Allow creating all QPs even when non RDMA profile is used
    
    [ Upstream commit 2614488d1f3cd5989375042286b11424208e20c8 ]
    
    The cited commit disallowed creating any QP which isn't raw ethernet, reg
    umr or the special UD qp for testing WC, this proved too strict.
    
    While modify can't be done (no GIDS/GID table for example) just creating a
    QP is okay.
    
    This patch partially reverts the bellow mentioned commit and places the
    restriction at the modify QP stage and not at the creation.  DEVX commands
    should be used to manipulate such QPs.

    regulator: core: Avoid debugfs: Directory ... already present! error
    
    [ Upstream commit dbe954d8f1635f949a1d9a5d6e6fb749ae022b47 ]
    
    Sometimes regulator_get() gets called twice for the same supply on the
    same device. This may happen e.g. when a framework / library is used
    which uses the regulator; and the driver itself also needs to enable
    the regulator in some cases where the framework will not enable it.
    
    Commit ff268b56ce8c ("regulator: core: Don't spew backtraces on
    duplicate sysfs") already takes care of the backtrace which would
    trigger when creating a duplicate consumer symlink under
    /sys/class/regulator/regulator.%d in this scenario.
    
    Commit c33d442328f5 ("debugfs: make error message a bit more verbose")
    causes a new error to get logged in this scenario:
    
    [   26.938425] debugfs: Directory 'wm5102-codec-MICVDD' with parent 'spi-WM510204:00-MICVDD' already present!
    
    There is no _nowarn variant of debugfs_create_dir(), but we can detect
    and avoid this problem by checking the return value of the earlier
    sysfs_create_link_nowarn() call.
    
    Add a check for the earlier sysfs_create_link_nowarn() failing with
    -EEXIST and skip the debugfs_create_dir() call in that case, avoiding
    this error getting logged.

    power: supply: smb347-charger: Fix interrupt usage if interrupt is unavailable
    
    [ Upstream commit 6996312642d2dad3070c3d276c7621f35e721f30 ]
    
    The IRQ=0 could be a valid interrupt number in kernel because interrupt
    numbers are virtual in a modern kernel. Hence fix the interrupt usage in
    a case if interrupt is unavailable by not overriding the interrupt number
    which is used by the driver.
    
    Note that currently Nexus 7 is the only know device which uses SMB347
    kernel diver and it has a properly working interrupt, hence this patch
    doesn't fix any real problems, it's a minor cleanup/improvement.

    As can be seen from the "(*)" markers above, almost all the call-chains are
    atomic. The only exception, marked with "(+)", is a PCI ->remove() and
    PM_OPS ->suspend() cold path. Thus, pass GFP_ATOMIC to the libsas port
    event notifier.
    
    Note, the now-replaced libsas APIs used in_interrupt() to implicitly decide
    which memory allocation type to use.  This was only partially correct, as
    it fails to choose the correct GFP flags when just preemption or interrupts
    are disabled. Such buggy code paths are marked with "(@)" in the call
    chains above.

    are disabled. Such buggy code paths are marked with "(@)" in the call
    chains above.

    scsi: mvsas: Pass gfp_t flags to libsas event notifiers
    
    [ Upstream commit feb18e900f0048001ff375dca639eaa327ab3c1b ]
    
    mvsas calls the non _gfp version of the libsas event notifiers API, leading
    to the buggy call chains below:
    
      mvsas/mv_sas.c: mvs_work_queue() [process context]
      spin_lock_irqsave(mvs_info::lock, )
        -> libsas/sas_event.c: sas_notify_phy_event()
          -> sas_alloc_event()
            -> in_interrupt() = false
              -> invalid GFP_KERNEL allocation
        -> libsas/sas_event.c: sas_notify_port_event()
          -> sas_alloc_event()
            -> in_interrupt() = false
              -> invalid GFP_KERNEL allocation
    
    Use the new event notifiers API instead, which requires callers to
    explicitly pass the gfp_t memory allocation flags.
    
    Below are context analysis for the modified functions:
    
    => mvs_bytes_dmaed():
    
    Since it is invoked from both process and atomic contexts, let its callers
    pass the gfp_t flags. Call chains:
    
      scsi_scan.c: do_scsi_scan_host() [has msleep()]
        -> shost->hostt->scan_start()
        -> [mvsas/mv_init.c: Scsi_Host::scsi_host_template .scan_start = mvs_scan_start()]
        -> mvsas/mv_sas.c: mvs_scan_start()
          -> mvs_bytes_dmaed(..., GFP_KERNEL)
    
      mvsas/mv_sas.c: mvs_work_queue()
      spin_lock_irqsave(mvs_info::lock,)
        -> mvs_bytes_dmaed(..., GFP_ATOMIC)
    
      mvsas/mv_64xx.c: mvs_64xx_isr() || mvsas/mv_94xx.c: mvs_94xx_isr()
        -> mvsas/mv_chips.h: mvs_int_full()
          -> mvsas/mv_sas.c: mvs_int_port()
            -> mvs_bytes_dmaed(..., GFP_ATOMIC);
    
    => mvs_work_queue():
    
    Invoked from process context, but it calls all the libsas event notifier
    APIs under a spin_lock_irqsave(). Pass GFP_ATOMIC.

    scsi: libsas: Introduce a _gfp() variant of event notifiers
    
    [ Upstream commit c2d0f1a65ab9fbabebb463bf36f50ea8f4633386 ]
    
    sas_alloc_event() uses in_interrupt() to decide which allocation should be
    used.
    
    The usage of in_interrupt() in drivers is phased out and Linus clearly
    requested that code which changes behaviour depending on context should
    either be separated or the context be conveyed in an argument passed by the
    caller, which usually knows the context.
    
    The in_interrupt() check is also only partially correct, because it fails
    to choose the correct code path when just preemption or interrupts are
    disabled. For example, as in the following call chain:
    
      mvsas/mv_sas.c: mvs_work_queue() [process context]
      spin_lock_irqsave(mvs_info::lock, )
        -> libsas/sas_event.c: sas_notify_phy_event()
          -> sas_alloc_event()
            -> in_interrupt() = false
              -> invalid GFP_KERNEL allocation
        -> libsas/sas_event.c: sas_notify_port_event()
          -> sas_alloc_event()
            -> in_interrupt() = false
              -> invalid GFP_KERNEL allocation
    
    Introduce sas_alloc_event_gfp(), sas_notify_port_event_gfp(), and
    sas_notify_phy_event_gfp(), which all behave like the non _gfp() variants
    but use a caller-passed GFP mask for allocations.
    
    For bisectability, all callers will be modified first to pass GFP context,
    then the non _gfp() libsas API variants will be modified to take a gfp_t by
    default.

    scsi: libsas: Remove notifier indirection
    
    [ Upstream commit 121181f3f839c29d8dd9fdc3cc9babbdc74227f8 ]
    
    LLDDs report events to libsas with .notify_port_event and .notify_phy_event
    callbacks.
    
    These callbacks are fixed and so there is no reason why the functions
    cannot be called directly, so do that.
    
    This neatens the code slightly, makes it more obvious, and reduces function
    pointer usage, which is generally a good thing. Downside is that there are
    2x more symbol exports.

    certs: Fix blacklist flag type confusion
    
    [ Upstream commit 4993e1f9479a4161fd7d93e2b8b30b438f00cb0f ]
    
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP is not meant to be passed to keyring_alloc() or key_alloc(),
    as these only take KEY_ALLOC_* flags.  KEY_FLAG_KEEP has the same value as
    KEY_ALLOC_BYPASS_RESTRICTION, but fortunately only key_create_or_update()
    uses it.  LSMs using the key_alloc hook don't check that flag.
    
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP is then ignored but fortunately (again) the root user cannot
    write to the blacklist keyring, so it is not possible to remove a key/hash
    from it.
    
    Fix this by adding a KEY_ALLOC_SET_KEEP flag that tells key_alloc() to set
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP on the new key.  blacklist_init() can then, correctly, pass
    this to keyring_alloc().
    
    We can also use this in ima_mok_init() rather than setting the flag
    manually.
    
    Note that this doesn't fix an observable bug with the current
    implementation but it is required to allow addition of new hashes to the
    blacklist in the future without making it possible for them to be removed.

    [ Upstream commit 852405d8efcbca0e02f14592fb1d1dcd0d3fb508 ]
    
    After 'platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Use EC_HOST_EVENT_MASK not BIT'
    some of the flags are not quite correct.
    LID_CLOSED is used to suspend the device, so it makes sense to ignore that.

    [ Upstream commit 0944ea07baa748741563c8842122010fa9017d16 ]
    
    The host_event_code enum is 1-based, use EC_HOST_EVENT_MASK not BIT to
    generate the intended mask. This patch changes the behaviour of the
    mask, a following patch will restore the intended behaviour:

    clk: sunxi-ng: h6: Fix clock divider range on some clocks
    
    [ Upstream commit 04ef679591c76571a9e7d5ca48316cc86fa0ef12 ]
    
    While comparing clocks between the H6 and H616, some of the M factor
    ranges were found to be wrong: the manual says they are only covering
    two bits [1:0], but our code had "5" in the number-of-bits field.
    
    By writing 0xff into that register in U-Boot and via FEL, it could be
    confirmed that bits [4:2] are indeed masked off, so the manual is right.
    
    Change to number of bits in the affected clock's description.

    module: harden ELF info handling
    
    [ Upstream commit ec2a29593c83ed71a7f16e3243941ebfcf75fdf6 ]
    
    5fdc7db644 ("module: setup load info before module_sig_check()")
    moved the ELF setup, so that it was done before the signature
    check. This made the module name available to signature error
    messages.
    
    However, the checks for ELF correctness in setup_load_info
    are not sufficient to prevent bad memory references due to
    corrupted offset fields, indices, etc.
    
    So, there's a regression in behavior here: a corrupt and unsigned
    (or badly signed) module, which might previously have been rejected
    immediately, can now cause an oops/crash.
    
    Harden ELF handling for module loading by doing the following:
    
    - Move the signature check back up so that it comes before ELF
      initialization. It's best to do the signature check to see
      if we can trust the module, before using the ELF structures
      inside it. This also makes checks against info->len
      more accurate again, as this field will be reduced by the
      length of the signature in mod_check_sig().
    
      The module name is now once again not available for error
      messages during the signature check, but that seems like
      a fair tradeoff.
    
    - Check if sections have offset / size fields that at least don't
      exceed the length of the module.
    
    - Check if sections have section name offsets that don't fall
      outside the section name table.
    
    - Add a few other sanity checks against invalid section indices,
      etc.
    
    This is not an exhaustive consistency check, but the idea is to
    at least get through the signature and blacklist checks without
    crashing because of corrupted ELF info, and to error out gracefully
    for most issues that would have caused problems later on.

    Fix up wr_avail accounting. if wr_cnt is 0, then we do SIGNAL for first
    wr, in completion we add queue_depth back, which is not right in the
    sense of tracking for available wr.
    
    So fix it by init wr_cnt to 1.

    of/fdt: Make sure no-map does not remove already reserved regions
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a5a75e5e9e55de1cef5d83ca3589cb4899193ef ]
    
    If the device tree is incorrectly configured, and attempts to
    define a "no-map" reserved memory that overlaps with the kernel
    data/code, the kernel would crash quickly after boot, with no
    obvious clue about the nature of the issue.
    
    For example, this would happen if we have the kernel mapped at
    these addresses (from /proc/iomem):
    40000000-41ffffff : System RAM
      40080000-40dfffff : Kernel code
      40e00000-411fffff : reserved
      41200000-413e0fff : Kernel data
    
    And we declare a no-map shared-dma-pool region at a fixed address
    within that range:
    mem_reserved: mem_region {
            compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
            reg = <0 0x40000000 0 0x01A00000>;
            no-map;
    };
    
    To fix this, when removing memory regions at early boot (which is
    what "no-map" regions do), we need to make sure that the memory
    is not already reserved. If we do, __reserved_mem_reserve_reg
    will throw an error:
    [    0.000000] OF: fdt: Reserved memory: failed to reserve memory
       for node 'mem_region': base 0x0000000040000000, size 26 MiB
    and the code that will try to use the region should also fail,
    later on.
    
    We do not do anything for non-"no-map" regions, as memblock
    explicitly allows reserved regions to overlap, and the commit
    that this fixes removed the check for that precise reason.

    [ Upstream commit 035b73b2b3b2e074a56489a7bf84b6a8012c0e0d ]
    
    On Intel Tangier B0 and Anniedale the interrupt line, disregarding
    to have different numbers, is shared between HSU DMA and UART IPs.
    Thus on such SoCs we are expecting that IRQ handler is called in
    UART driver only. hsu_pci_irq was handling the spurious interrupt
    from HSU DMA by returning immediately. This wastes CPU time and
    since HSU DMA and HSU UART interrupt occur simultaneously they race
    to be handled causing delay to the HSU UART interrupt handling.
    Fix this by disabling the interrupt entirely.

    dmaengine: qcom: Always inline gpi_update_reg
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a6d3038d914b51d6860f23ea2b508590e8340de ]
    
    When building with CONFIG_UBSAN_UNSIGNED_OVERFLOW, clang decides not to
    inline gpi_update_reg, which causes a linkage failure around __bad_mask:
    
    ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: __bad_mask
    >>> referenced by bitfield.h:119 (include/linux/bitfield.h:119)
    >>>               dma/qcom/gpi.o:(gpi_update_reg) in archive drivers/built-in.a
    >>> referenced by bitfield.h:119 (include/linux/bitfield.h:119)
    >>>               dma/qcom/gpi.o:(gpi_update_reg) in archive drivers/built-in.a
    
    If gpi_update_reg is not inlined, the mask value will not be known at
    compile time so the check in field_multiplier stays in the final
    object file, causing the above linkage failure. Always inline
    gpi_update_reg so that this check can never fail.

    RDMA/siw: Fix handling of zero-sized Read and Receive Queues.
    
    [ Upstream commit 661f385961f06f36da24cf408d461f988d0c39ad ]
    
    During connection setup, the application may choose to zero-size inbound
    and outbound READ queues, as well as the Receive queue.  This patch fixes
    handling of zero-sized queues, but not prevents it.
    
    Kamal Heib says in an initial error report:
    
     When running the blktests over siw the following shift-out-of-bounds is
     reported, this is happening because the passed IRD or ORD from the ulp
     could be zero which will lead to unexpected behavior when calling
     roundup_pow_of_two(), fix that by blocking zero values of ORD or IRD.

    HID: core: detect and skip invalid inputs to snto32()
    
    [ Upstream commit a0312af1f94d13800e63a7d0a66e563582e39aec ]
    
    Prevent invalid (0, 0) inputs to hid-core's snto32() function.
    
    Maybe it is just the dummy device here that is causing this, but
    there are hundreds of calls to snto32(0, 0). Having n (bits count)
    of 0 is causing the current UBSAN trap with a shift value of
    0xffffffff (-1, or n - 1 in this function).
    
    Either of the value to shift being 0 or the bits count being 0 can be
    handled by just returning 0 to the caller, avoiding the following
    complex shift + OR operations:
    
            return value & (1 << (n - 1)) ? value | (~0U << n) : value;

    l2nb is 32 or more this can lead to an overflow.  Avoid this by shifting
    the value 1LL instead.

    ASoC: simple-card-utils: Fix device module clock
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e30f642cf2939bbdac82ea0dd3071232670b5ab ]
    
    If "clocks = <&xxx>" is specified from the CPU or Codec component
    device node, the clock is not getting enabled. Thus audio playback
    or capture fails.
    
    Fix this by populating "simple_dai->clk" field when clocks property
    is specified from device node as well. Also tidy up by re-organising
    conditional statements of parsing logic.

    ima: Free IMA measurement buffer after kexec syscall
    
    [ Upstream commit f31e3386a4e92ba6eda7328cb508462956c94c64 ]
    
    IMA allocates kernel virtual memory to carry forward the measurement
    list, from the current kernel to the next kernel on kexec system call,
    in ima_add_kexec_buffer() function.  This buffer is not freed before
    completing the kexec system call resulting in memory leak.
    
    Add ima_buffer field in "struct kimage" to store the virtual address
    of the buffer allocated for the IMA measurement list.
    Free the memory allocated for the IMA measurement list in
    kimage_file_post_load_cleanup() function.

    nvmet-tcp: fix potential race of tcp socket closing accept_work
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fbcfb089a3f2f2a731d01f0aec8f7697a849c28 ]
    
    When we accept a TCP connection and allocate an nvmet-tcp queue we should
    make sure not to fully establish it or reference it as the connection may
    be already closing, which triggers queue release work, which does not
    fence against queue establishment.
    
    In order to address such a race, we make sure to check the sk_state and
    contain the queue reference to be done underneath the sk_callback_lock
    such that the queue release work correctly fences against it.

    As part of the enable sequence we might change the HSM clock rate if the
    pixel rate is different than the one we were already dealing with.
    
    On the BCM2835 however, the CEC clock derives from the HSM clock so any
    rate change will need to be reflected in the CEC clock divider to output
    40kHz.

    drm/vc4: hdmi: Fix register offset with longer CEC messages
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a59ed546c0511f01a4bf6b886fe34b6cce2513f ]
    
    The code prior to 311e305fdb4e ("drm/vc4: hdmi: Implement a register

    was incremented by 4 for each readl call. That worked since the register
    width is 4 bytes.
    
    However, since that commit the HDMI_READ macro is now taking an enum,
    and the offset doesn't increment by 4 but 1 now. Divide the index by 4
    to fix this.

    s390/zcrypt: return EIO when msg retry limit reached
    
    [ Upstream commit d39fae45c97c67b1b4da04773f2bb5a2f29088c4 ]
    
    When a msg is retried because the lower ap layer returns -EAGAIN
    there is a retry limit (currently 10). When this limit is reached
    the last return code from the lower layer is returned, causing
    the userspace to get -1 on the ioctl with errno EAGAIN.
    
    This EAGAIN is misleading here. After 10 retry attempts the
    userspace should receive a clear failure indication like EINVAL
    or EIO or ENODEV. However, the reason why these retries all
    fail is unclear. On an invalid message EINVAL would be returned
    by the lower layer, and if devices go away or are not available
    an ENODEV is seen. So this patch now reworks the retry loops
    to return EIO to userspace when the retry limit is reached.

    btrfs: fix double accounting of ordered extent for subpage case in btrfs_invalidapge
    
    [ Upstream commit 951c80f83d61bd4b21794c8aba829c3c1a45c2d0 ]
    
    Commit dbfdb6d1b369 ("Btrfs: Search for all ordered extents that could
    span across a page") make btrfs_invalidapage() to search all ordered
    extents.
    
    The offending code looks like this:
    
      again:
              start = page_start;
              ordered = btrfs_lookup_ordered_range(inode, start, page_end - start + 1);
              if (ordred) {
                      end = min(page_end,
                                ordered->file_offset + ordered->num_bytes - 1);
    
                      /* Do the cleanup */
    
                      start = end + 1;
                      if (start < page_end)
                              goto again;
              }
    
    The behavior is indeed necessary for the incoming subpage support, but
    when it iterates through all the ordered extents, it also resets the
    search range @start.
    
    This means, for the following cases, we can double account the ordered
    extents, causing its bytes_left underflow:
    
            Page offset
            0               16K             32K
            |<--- OE 1  --->|<--- OE 2 ---->|
    
    As the first iteration will find ordered extent (OE) 1, which doesn't
    cover the full page, thus after cleanup code, we need to retry again.
    But again label will reset start to page_start, and we got OE 1 again,
    which causes double accounting on OE 1, and cause OE 1's byte_left to
    underflow.
    
    This problem can only happen for subpage case, as for regular sectorsize
    == PAGE_SIZE case, we will always find a OE ends at or after page end,

    btrfs: clarify error returns values in __load_free_space_cache
    
    [ Upstream commit 3cc64e7ebfb0d7faaba2438334c43466955a96e8 ]
    
    Return value in __load_free_space_cache is not properly set after
    (unlikely) memory allocation failures and 0 is returned instead.
    This is not a problem for the caller load_free_space_cache because only
    value 1 is considered as 'cache loaded' but for clarity it's better
    to set the errors accordingly.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Avoid use-after-free in vmbus_onoffer_rescind()
    
    [ Upstream commit e3fa4b747f085d2cda09bba0533b86fa76038635 ]
    
    When channel->device_obj is non-NULL, vmbus_onoffer_rescind() could
    invoke put_device(), that will eventually release the device and free
    the channel object (cf. vmbus_device_release()).  However, a pointer
    to the object is dereferenced again later to load the primary_channel.
    The use-after-free can be avoided by noticing that this load/check is
    redundant if device_obj is non-NULL: primary_channel must be NULL if
    device_obj is non-NULL, cf. vmbus_add_channel_work().

    KVM: nSVM: Don't strip host's C-bit from guest's CR3 when reading PDPTRs
    
    [ Upstream commit 2732be90235347a3be4babdc9f88a1ea93970b0b ]
    
    Don't clear the SME C-bit when reading a guest PDPTR, as the GPA (CR3) is
    in the guest domain.
    
    Barring a bizarre paravirtual use case, this is likely a benign bug.  SME
    is not emulated by KVM, loading SEV guest PDPTRs is doomed as KVM can't
    use the correct key to read guest memory, and setting guest MAXPHYADDR
    higher than the host, i.e. overlapping the C-bit, would cause faults in
    the guest.
    
    Note, for SEV guests, stripping the C-bit is technically aligned with CPU
    behavior, but for KVM it's the greater of two evils.  Because KVM doesn't
    have access to the guest's encryption key, ignoring the C-bit would at
    best result in KVM reading garbage.  By keeping the C-bit, KVM will
    fail its read (unless userspace creates a memslot with the C-bit set).
    The guest will still undoubtedly die, as KVM will use '0' for the PDPTR
    value, but that's preferable to interpreting encrypted data as a PDPTR.

    This typo error causing to read registers from the regmap beyond the length

    The root cause is:
    If we open file w/ readonly flag, disk quota info won't be initialized
    for this file, however, following mmap() will force to convert inline
    inode via f2fs_convert_inline_inode(), which may increase block usage
    for this inode w/o updating quota data, it causes inconsistent disk quota
    info.
    
    The issue will happen in following stack:
    open(file, O_RDONLY)
    mmap(file)
    - f2fs_convert_inline_inode
     - f2fs_convert_inline_page
      - f2fs_reserve_block
       - f2fs_reserve_new_block
        - f2fs_reserve_new_blocks
         - f2fs_i_blocks_write
          - dquot_claim_block
    inode->i_blocks increase, but the dqb_curspace keep the size for the dquots
    is NULL.
    
    To fix this issue, let's call dquot_initialize() anyway in both
    f2fs_truncate() and f2fs_convert_inline_inode() functions to avoid potential
    inconsistent quota data issue.

    If 'dmaengine_prep_slave_single()' fails, we must undo a previous
    'dma_map_single()' call, as already done in all the other error handling

    In the case of failure while parsing the partitions, the iterator should
    be pre decremented by one before starting to free the memory allocated
    by kstrdup(). Because in the failure case, kstrdup() will not succeed
    and thus no memory will be allocated for the current iteration.

    ASoC: cpcap: fix microphone timeslot mask
    
    [ Upstream commit de5bfae2fd962a9da99f56382305ec7966a604b9 ]
    
    The correct mask is 0x1f8 (Bit 3-8), but due to missing BIT() 0xf (Bit
    0-3) was set instead. This means setting of CPCAP_BIT_MIC1_RX_TIMESLOT0
    (Bit 3) still worked (part of both masks). On the other hand the code
    does not properly clear the other MIC timeslot bits. I think this
    is not a problem, since they are probably initialized to 0 and not
    touched by the driver anywhere else. But the mask also contains some
    wrong bits, that will be cleared. Bit 0 (CPCAP_BIT_SMB_CDC) should be
    safe, since the driver enforces it to be 0 anyways.
    
    Bit 1-2 are CPCAP_BIT_FS_INV and CPCAP_BIT_CLK_INV. This means enabling
    audio recording forces the codec into SND_SOC_DAIFMT_NB_NF mode, which
    is obviously bad.
    
    The bug probably remained undetected, because there are not many use
    cases for routing microphone to the CPU on platforms using cpcap and
    user base is small. I do remember having some issues with bad sound
    quality when testing voice recording back when I wrote the driver.
    It probably was this bug.

    While reworking the resources management and departing from using
    ahci_platform_enable_resources() which did not allow a proper step
    separation like we need, we unfortunately lost the ability to control
    AHCI regulators. This broke some Broadcom STB systems that do expect
    regulators to be turned on to link up with attached hard drives.

    mm: proc: Invalidate TLB after clearing soft-dirty page state
    
    [ Upstream commit 912efa17e5121693dfbadae29768f4144a3f9e62 ]
    
    Since commit 0758cd830494 ("asm-generic/tlb: avoid potential double
    flush"), TLB invalidation is elided in tlb_finish_mmu() if no entries
    were batched via the tlb_remove_*() functions. Consequently, the
    page-table modifications performed by clear_refs_write() in response to
    a write to /proc/<pid>/clear_refs do not perform TLB invalidation.
    Although this is fine when simply aging the ptes, in the case of
    clearing the "soft-dirty" state we can end up with entries where
    pte_write() is false, yet a writable mapping remains in the TLB.
    
    Fix this by avoiding the mmu_gather API altogether: managing both the
    'tlb_flush_pending' flag on the 'mm_struct' and explicit TLB
    invalidation for the sort-dirty path, much like mprotect() does already.

    [ Upstream commit 43a942d27eaaf33bca560121cbe42f3637e92880 ]
    
    While ctr(aes) requires the use of a special descriptor on SEC2 (see

    special descriptor doesn't work on SEC1, see commit e738c5f15562

    However, the common nonsnoop descriptor works properly on SEC1 for
    ctr(aes).
    
    Add a second template for ctr(aes) that will be registered
    only on SEC1.

    data size that is not a multiple of 16 bytes to be an error.
    This is not a problem in general, except for Counter mode
    that is a stream cipher and can have an input of any size.
    
    Test Manager for ctr(aes) fails on 4th test vector which has
    a length of 499 while all previous vectors which have a 16 bytes
    multiple length succeed.
    
    As suggested by Freescale, round up the input data length to the
    nearest 16 bytes.

    [ Upstream commit 79d7c3dca99fa96033695ddf5d495b775a3a137b ]
    
    Although it's neat to avoid the suffix for the typical case of a
    single PMU, it means systems with multiple CMN instances end up with
    inconsistent naming. I think it also breaks perf tool's "uncore alias"
    logic if the common instance prefix is also the full name of one.
    
    Avoid any surprises by not trying to be clever and simply numbering
    every instance, even when it might technically prove redundant.

    sched/eas: Don't update misfit status if the task is pinned
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ae78eec8aa64e645866e75005162603a77a0f49 ]
    
    If the task is pinned to a cpu, setting the misfit status means that
    we'll unnecessarily continuously attempt to migrate the task but fail.
    
    This continuous failure will cause the balance_interval to increase to
    a high value, and eventually cause unnecessary significant delays in
    balancing the system when real imbalance happens.
    
    Caught while testing uclamp where rt-app calibration loop was pinned to
    cpu 0, shortly after which we spawn another task with high util_clamp
    value. The task was failing to migrate after over 40ms of runtime due to
    balance_interval unnecessary expanded to a very high value from the
    calibration loop.
    
    Not done here, but it could be useful to extend the check for pinning to
    verify that the affinity of the task has a cpu that fits. We could end
    up in a similar situation otherwise.

    The Renkforce RF AC4K 300 Action Cam 4K reports invalid bFormatIndex and

    The UVC descriptors report a single supported format and frame size,
    with bFormatIndex and bFrameIndex both equal to 2, but the video probe
    and commit controls report bFormatIndex and bFrameIndex set to 1.
    
    The device otherwise operates correctly, but the driver rejects the
    values and fails the format try operation. Fix it by ignoring the
    invalid indices, and assuming that the format and frame requested by the
    driver are accepted by the device.

    drm/amd/display: Fix HDMI deep color output for DCE 6-11.
    
    [ Upstream commit efa18405baa55a864c61d2f3cc6fe4d363818eb3 ]
    
    This fixes corrupted display output in HDMI deep color
    10/12 bpc mode at least as observed on AMD Mullins, DCE-8.3.
    
    It will hopefully also provide fixes for other DCE's up to
    DCE-11, assuming those will need similar fixes, but i could
    not test that for HDMI due to lack of suitable hw, so viewer
    discretion is advised.
    
    dce110_stream_encoder_hdmi_set_stream_attribute() is used for
    HDMI setup on all DCE's and is missing color_depth assignment.
    
    dce110_program_pix_clk() is used for pixel clock setup on HDMI
    for DCE 6-11, and is missing color_depth assignment.
    
    Additionally some of the underlying Atombios specific encoder
    and pixelclock setup functions are missing code which is in
    the classic amdgpu kms modesetting path and the in the radeon
    kms driver for DCE6/DCE8.
    
    encoder_control_digx_v3() - Was missing setup code wrt. amdgpu
    and radeon kms classic drivers. Added here, but untested due to
    lack of suitable test hw.
    
    encoder_control_digx_v4() - Added missing setup code.
    Successfully tested on AMD mullins / DCE-8.3 with HDMI deep color
    output at 10 bpc and 12 bpc.
    
    Note that encoder_control_digx_v5() has proper setup code in place
    and is used, e.g., by DCE-11.2, but this code wasn't used for deep
    color setup due to the missing cntl.color_depth setup in the calling
    function for HDMI.
    
    set_pixel_clock_v5() - Missing setup code wrt. classic amdgpu/radeon
    kms. Added here, but untested due to lack of hw.
    
    set_pixel_clock_v6() - Missing setup code added. Successfully tested
    on AMD mullins DCE-8.3. This fixes corrupted display output at HDMI
    deep color output with 10 bpc or 12 bpc.

    drm/amd/display: Fix 10/12 bpc setup in DCE output bit depth reduction.
    
    [ Upstream commit 1916866dfa4aaceba1a70db83fde569387649d93 ]
    
    In set_clamp(), the comments and definitions for the COLOR_DEPTH_101010
    and COLOR_DEPTH_121212 cases directly contradict the code comment which
    explains how this should work, whereas the COLOR_DEPTH_888 case
    is consistent with the code comments. Comment says the bitmask should
    be chosen to align to the top-most 10 or 12 MSB's on a 14 bit bus, but
    the implementation contradicts that: 10 bit case sets a mask for 12 bpc
    clamping, whereas 12 bit case sets a mask for 14 bpc clamping.
    
    Note that during my limited testing on DCE-8.3 (HDMI deep color)
    and DCE-11.2 (DP deep color), this didn't have any obvious ill
    effects, neither did fixing it change anything obvious for the
    better, so this fix may be inconsequential on DCE, and just
    reduce the confusion of innocent bystanders when reading the code
    and trying to investigate problems with 10 bpc+ output.

    As usual, the available documentation is inadequate and leaves endianness
    unspecified for message data. However, testing shows that this patch does
    improve correctness. The mistake should have been detected earlier but it
    was obscured by other bugs. In testing, this patch reinstated pre-v5.9

    -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables to KBUILD_CFLAGS to prevent compiler
    from emitting .eh_frame symbols.
    However, as MIPS heavily uses CFI, that's not enough. Use the
    approach taken for x86 (as it also uses CFI) and explicitly put CFI
    symbols into the .debug_frame section (except for VDSO).
    This allows us to drop .eh_frame from DISCARDS as it's no longer
    being generated.

    macros have been changed to avoid ambiguity but just because of this
    ambiguity previous DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_(POS/NEG)EDGE were used meaning
    _SAMPLE_ not _DRIVE_. This leads to DLCK inversion and need to fix but
    instead of swapping phase values, let's adopt an easier approach Maxime
    suggested:
    It turned out that bit 26 of SUN4I_TCON0_IO_POL_REG is dedicated to
    invert DCLK polarity and this makes things really easier than before. So
    let's handle DCLK polarity by adding SUN4I_TCON0_IO_POL_DCLK_DRIVE_NEGEDGE
    as bit 26 and activating according to bus_flags the same way it is done
    for all the other signals polarity.

    To mitigate the issue split the util_est update (2) into:
    
     (A) CPU_util_est update in util_est_dequeue()
     (B) task_util_est update in util_est_update()
    
    Place (A) before (1) and keep (B) where (2) is. The latter is necessary
    since (B) relies on task_util update in (1).

    crypto: bcm - Rename struct device_private to bcm_device_private
    
    [ Upstream commit f7f2b43eaf6b4cfe54c75100709be31d5c4b52c8 ]
    
    Renaming 'struct device_private' to 'struct bcm_device_private',
    because it clashes with 'struct device_private' from
    'drivers/base/base.h'.
    
    While it's not a functional problem, it's causing two distinct
    type hierarchies in BTF data. It also breaks build with options:
      CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y
      CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_BCM_SPU=y
    
    as reported by Qais Yousef [1].

    ASoC: qcom: qdsp6: Move frontend AIFs to q6asm-dai
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fd8d2d275f74baa7ac17b2656da1235f56dab99 ]
    
    At the moment it is necessary to set up the DAPM routes between
    front-end AIF<->DAI explicitly in the device tree, e.g. using
    
            audio-routing =
                    "MM_DL1", "MultiMedia1 Playback",
                    "MM_DL3", "MultiMedia3 Playback",
                    "MM_DL4", "MultiMedia4 Playback",
                    "MultiMedia2 Capture", "MM_UL2";
    
    This is prone to mistakes and (sadly) there is no clear error if one
    of these routes is missing. :(
    
    Actually, this should not be necessary because the ASoC core normally
    automatically links AIF<->DAI within snd_soc_dapm_link_dai_widgets().
    This is done using the "stname" parameter of SND_SOC_DAPM_AIF_IN/OUT.
    
    For SND_SOC_DAPM_AIF_IN("MM_DL1", "MultiMedia1 Playback", 0, 0, 0, 0),
    it should create the route from above: MM_DL1 <-> MultiMedia1 Playback.
    
    This does not work at the moment because the AIF widget (MM_DL1)
    and the DAI widget (MultiMedia1 Playback) belong to different
    DAPM contexts (q6routing / q6asm-dai).
    
    Fix this by declaring the AIF widgets in the same driver as the DAIs
    (q6asm-dai). Now the routes above are created automatically
    and no longer need to be specified in the device tree.
    
    This is also more consistent with the back-end AIFs which are already
    declared in q6afe-dais instead of q6routing. q6routing should only link
    the components together using mixers.

    media: imx: Fix csc/scaler unregister
    
    [ Upstream commit 89b14485caa4b7b2eaf70be0064f0978e68ebeee ]
    
    The csc/scaler device private struct is released by
    ipu_csc_scaler_video_device_release(), which can be called
    by video_unregister_device() if there are no users
    of the underlying struct video device.
    
    Therefore, the mutex can't be held when calling
    video_unregister_device() as its memory may be freed
    by it, leading to a kernel oops.
    
    Fortunately, the fix is quite simple as no locking
    is needed when calling video_unregister_device(): v4l2-core
    already has its own internal locking, and the structures
    are also properly refcounted.

    that take more than 4 bits, as this would silently drop the high
    bits.
    
    Make the masks consistent with the comment and the shift.

    drm: rcar-du: Fix crash when using LVDS1 clock for CRTC
    
    [ Upstream commit 53ced169373aab52d3b5da0fee6a342002d1876d ]
    
    On D3 and E3 platforms, the LVDS encoder includes a PLL that can
    generate a clock for the corresponding CRTC, used even when the CRTC
    output to a non-LVDS port. This mechanism is supported by the driver,
    but the implementation is broken in dual-link LVDS mode. In that case,
    the LVDS1 drm_encoder is skipped, which causes a crash when trying to
    access its bridge later on.
    
    Fix this by storing bridge pointers internally instead of retrieving
    them from the encoder. The rcar_du_device encoders field isn't used
    anymore and can be dropped.

    kcsan: Rewrite kcsan_prandom_u32_max() without prandom_u32_state()
    
    [ Upstream commit 71a076f4a61a6c779794ad286f356b39725edc3b ]
    
    Rewrite kcsan_prandom_u32_max() to not depend on code that might be
    instrumented, removing any dependency on lib/random32.c. The rewrite
    implements a simple linear congruential generator, that is sufficient
    for our purposes (for udelay() and skip_watch counter randomness).
    
    The initial motivation for this was to allow enabling KCSAN for
    kernel/sched (remove KCSAN_SANITIZE := n from kernel/sched/Makefile),
    with CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y. Without this change, we could observe
    recursion:
    
            check_access() [via instrumentation]
              kcsan_setup_watchpoint()
                reset_kcsan_skip()
                  kcsan_prandom_u32_max()
                    get_cpu_var()
                      preempt_disable()
                        preempt_count_add() [in kernel/sched/core.c]
                          check_access() [via instrumentation]
    
    Note, while this currently does not affect an unmodified kernel, it'd be
    good to keep a KCSAN kernel working when KCSAN_SANITIZE := n is removed
    from kernel/sched/Makefile to permit testing scheduler code with KCSAN
    if desired.

    crypto: sun4i-ss - fix kmap usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bc3dd24e7dccd50757db743a3635ad5b0497e6e ]
    
    With the recent kmap change, some tests which were conditional on
    CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM now are enabled by default.
    This permit to detect a problem in sun4i-ss usage of kmap.
    
    sun4i-ss uses two kmap via sg_miter (one for input, one for output), but
    using two kmap at the same time is hard:
    "the ordering has to be correct and with sg_miter that's probably hard to get
    right." (quoting Tlgx)
    
    So the easiest solution is to never have two sg_miter/kmap open at the same time.
    After each use of sg_miter, I store the current index, for being able to
    resume sg_miter to the right place.

    [ Upstream commit 47b1adc1d2a3b39233a56e183296b335222c9a6d ]
    
    The DSI version of the panel behaved instable and close
    scrutiny of the vendor driver from the Samsung
    GT-S8190 shows a different initialization sequence for
    the DSI mode panel than the DPI mode panel.
    
    Make the initialization depend on whether we are in
    DSI or DPI mode and handle the differences.
    
    After this the panel on the GT-I8190 becomes much more
    stable.
    
    Also spell out some more custom DCS commands found in
    the vendor source code to cut down a bit on magic
    where we can.

    It looks like SPARC64 requires FB_ATY_CT to build without errors,
    so have FB_ATY select FB_ATY_CT if both SPARC64 and PCI are enabled
    instead of using "default y if SPARC64 && PCI", which is not strong
    enough to prevent build errors.

    The 'coma mode' (configurable through sw or hw) provides an

    The typical usage is to synchronize the link-up time across
    all PHY instances. This patch releases coma mode if not done by hardware,
    otherwise the phys will not link-up.

    The current IB serdes calibration algorithm (performed by the onboard 8051)
    has proven to be unstable for the VSC8514 QSGMII phy.
    A new algorithm has been developed based on
    'Frequency-offset Jittered-Injection' or 'FoJi' method which solves
    all known issues.  This patch disables the 8051 algorithm and
    replaces it with the new FoJi algorithm.
    The calibration is now performed in a new file (mscc_serdes.c),
    which can act as an placeholder for future serdes configurations.

    net/mlx5e: Fix CQ params of ICOSQ and async ICOSQ
    
    [ Upstream commit ebf79b6be67c0a77a9ab7cdf74c43fd7d9619f0c ]
    
    The commit mentioned below has split the parameters of ICOSQ and async
    ICOSQ, but it contained a typo: the CQ parameters were swapped for ICOSQ
    and async ICOSQ. Async ICOSQ is longer than the normal ICOSQ, and the CQ
    size must be the same as the size of the corresponding SQ, but due to
    this bug, the CQ of async ICOSQ was much shorter than async ICOSQ
    itself. It led to overflows of the CQ with such messages in dmesg, in
    particular, when running multiple kTLS-offloaded streams:
    
    mlx5_core 0000:08:00.0: cq_err_event_notifier:529:(pid 9422): CQ error

    not support striding rq, for Connect-X this is no longer true.
    
    Fix by keeping this limitation only for Innova IPsec supporting devices,

    ARM: tegra: ouya: Fix eMMC on specific bootloaders
    
    [ Upstream commit 3029a563ac0ccd39b9dc53eadfb9c0e3fb57a449 ]
    
    Ouya fails to detect the eMMC module when booted via certain bootloaders.
    Fastboot and hard-kexec bootloaders fail while u-boot does not. It was
    discovered that the issue manifests if the sdmmc4 alternate configuration
    clock pin is input disabled.
    
    Ouya uses sdmmc4 in the primary pin configuration. It is unknown why this
    occurs, though it is likely related to other eMMC limitations experienced
    on Ouya.
    
    For now, fix it by enabling input on cam_mclk_pcc0.

    net: sfp: add workaround for Realtek RTL8672 and RTL9601C chips
    
    [ Upstream commit 426c6cbc409cbda9ab1a9dbf15d3c2ef947eb8c1 ]
    
    The workaround for VSOL V2801F brand based GPON SFP modules added in commit
    0d035bed2a4a ("net: sfp: VSOL V2801F / CarlitoxxPro CPGOS03-0490 v2.0
    workaround") works only for IDs added explicitly to the list. Since there
    are rebranded modules where OEM vendors put different strings into the
    vendor name field, we cannot base workaround on IDs only.
    
    Moreover the issue which the above mentioned commit tried to work around is
    generic not only to VSOL based modules, but rather to all GPON modules
    based on Realtek RTL8672 and RTL9601C chips.
    
    These include at least the following GPON modules:
    * V-SOL V2801F
    * C-Data FD511GX-RM0
    * OPTON GP801R
    * BAUDCOM BD-1234-SFM
    * CPGOS03-0490 v2.0
    * Ubiquiti U-Fiber Instant
    * EXOT EGS1
    
    These Realtek chips have broken EEPROM emulator which for N-byte read
    operation returns just the first byte of EEPROM data, followed by N-1
    zeros.
    
    Introduce a new function, sfp_id_needs_byte_io(), which detects SFP modules
    with broken EEPROM emulator based on N-1 zeros and switch to 1 byte EEPROM
    reading operation.
    
    Function sfp_i2c_read() now always uses single byte reading when it is
    required and when function sfp_hwmon_probe() detects single byte access,
    it disables registration of hwmon device, because in this case we cannot
    reliably and atomically read 2 bytes as is required by the standard for
    retrieving values from diagnostic area.
    
    (These Realtek chips are broken in a way that violates SFP standards for
    diagnostic interface. Kernel in this case simply cannot do anything less
    of skipping registration of the hwmon interface.)
    
    This patch fixes reading of EEPROM content from SFP modules based on
    Realtek RTL8672 and RTL9601C chips. Diagnostic interface of EEPROM stays
    broken and cannot be fixed.

    Now that the ldisc read() function takes kernel pointers, it's fairly
    straightforward to make the tty file operations use .read_iter() instead
    of .read().

    tty: convert tty_ldisc_ops 'read()' function to take a kernel pointer
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b830a9c34d5897be07176ce4e6f2d75e2c8cfd7 ]
    
    The tty line discipline .read() function was passed the final user
    pointer destination as an argument, which doesn't match the 'write()'
    function, and makes it very inconvenient to do a splice method for
    ttys.
    
    This is a conversion to use a kernel buffer instead.
    
    NOTE! It does this by passing the tty line discipline ->read() function
    an additional "cookie" to fill in, and an offset into the cookie data.
    
    The line discipline can fill in the cookie data with its own private
    information, and then the reader will repeat the read until either the
    cookie is cleared or it runs out of data.
    
    The only real user of this is N_HDLC, which can use this to handle big
    packets, even if the kernel buffer is smaller than the whole packet.

    selftests/bpf: Sync RCU before unloading bpf_testmod
    
    [ Upstream commit 635599bace259a2c42741c3ea61bfa7be6f15556 ]
    
    If some of the subtests use module BTFs through ksyms, they will cause
    bpf_prog to take a refcount on bpf_testmod module, which will prevent it from
    successfully unloading. Module's refcnt is decremented when bpf_prog is freed,
    which generally happens in RCU callback. So we need to trigger
    syncronize_rcu() in the kernel, which can be achieved nicely with
    membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED) or membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL) syscall.
    So do that in kernel_sync_rcu() and make it available to other test inside the
    test_progs. This synchronize_rcu() is called before attempting to unload
    bpf_testmod.

    net: enetc: fix destroyed phylink dereference during unbind
    
    [ Upstream commit 3af409ca278d4a8d50e91f9f7c4c33b175645cf3 ]
    
    The following call path suggests that calling unregister_netdev on an
    interface that is up will first bring it down.
    
    enetc_pf_remove
    -> unregister_netdev
       -> unregister_netdevice_queue
          -> unregister_netdevice_many
             -> dev_close_many
                -> __dev_close_many
                   -> enetc_close
                      -> enetc_stop
                         -> phylink_stop
    
    However, enetc first destroys the phylink instance, then calls
    unregister_netdev. This is already dissimilar to the setup (and error
    path teardown path) from enetc_pf_probe, but more than that, it is buggy
    because it is invalid to call phylink_stop after phylink_destroy.
    
    So let's first unregister the netdev (and let the .ndo_stop events
    consume themselves), then destroy the phylink instance, then free the
    netdev.

    net: mvneta: Remove per-cpu queue mapping for Armada 3700
    
    [ Upstream commit cf9bf871280d9e0a8869d98c2602d29caf69dfa3 ]
    
    According to Errata #23 "The per-CPU GbE interrupt is limited to Core
    0", we can't use the per-cpu interrupt mechanism on the Armada 3700
    familly.
    
    This is correctly checked for RSS configuration, but the initial queue
    mapping is still done by having the queues spread across all the CPUs in
    the system, both in the init path and in the cpu_hotplug path.

    [ Upstream commit 84fe68eb67f9499309cffd97c1ba269de125ff14 ]
    
    Normally, auto negotiation and reconnect should be automatically done by
    the hardware. But there seems to be an issue where auto negotiation has
    to be restarted manually. This happens because of link training and so
    even though still connected to the partner the link never "comes back".
    This needs an auto-negotiation restart.
    
    Also, a change in xgbe-mdio is needed to get ethtool to recognize the
    link down and get the link change message. This change is only
    required in a backplane connection mode.

    [ Upstream commit 186edbb510bd60e748f93975989ccba25ee99c50 ]

    ibmvnic: serialize access to work queue on remove
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a41c421f3676fdeea91733cf434dcf319c4c351 ]
    
    The work queue is used to queue reset requests like CHANGE-PARAM or
    FAILOVER resets for the worker thread. When the adapter is being removed
    the adapter state is set to VNIC_REMOVING and the work queue is flushed
    so no new work is added. However the check for adapter being removed is
    racy in that the adapter can go into REMOVING state just after we check
    and we might end up adding work just as it is being flushed (or after).
    
    The ->rwi_lock is already being used to serialize queue/dequeue work.
    Extend its usage ensure there is no race when scheduling/flushing work.

    bpf: Clear subreg_def for global function return values
    
    [ Upstream commit 45159b27637b0fef6d5ddb86fc7c46b13c77960f ]
    
    test_global_func4 fails on s390 as reported by Yauheni in [1].
    
    The immediate problem is that the zext code includes the instruction,
    whose result needs to be zero-extended, into the zero-extension
    patchlet, and if this instruction happens to be a branch, then its
    delta is not adjusted. As a result, the verifier rejects the program
    later.
    
    However, according to [2], as far as the verifier's algorithm is
    concerned and as specified by the insn_no_def() function, branching
    insns do not define anything. This includes call insns, even though
    one might argue that they define %r0.
    
    This means that the real problem is that zero extension kicks in at
    all. This happens because clear_caller_saved_regs() sets BPF_REG_0's
    subreg_def after global function calls. This can be fixed in many
    ways; this patch mimics what helper function call handling already
    does.

    if getting the clock returns -EPROBE_DEFER, then we need to abort and
    return that error from our driver initialization so that the probe can
    be retried later after the clock is set up.
    
    Move clock initialization to earlier in the process so we do not waste as
    much effort if the clock is not yet available. Switch to use
    devm_clk_get_optional and abort initialization on any error reported.
    Also enable the clock regardless of whether the controller is using an MDIO
    bus, as the clock is required in any case.

    tcp: fix SO_RCVLOWAT related hangs under mem pressure
    
    [ Upstream commit f969dc5a885736842c3511ecdea240fbb02d25d9 ]
    
    While commit 24adbc1676af ("tcp: fix SO_RCVLOWAT hangs with fat skbs")
    fixed an issue vs too small sk_rcvbuf for given sk_rcvlowat constraint,
    it missed to address issue caused by memory pressure.
    
    1) If we are under memory pressure and socket receive queue is empty.
    First incoming packet is allowed to be queued, after commit
    76dfa6082032 ("tcp: allow one skb to be received per socket under memory pressure")
    
    But we do not send EPOLLIN yet, in case tcp_data_ready() sees sk_rcvlowat
    is bigger than skb length.
    
    2) Then, when next packet comes, it is dropped, and we directly
    call sk->sk_data_ready().
    
    3) If application is using poll(), tcp_poll() will then use
    tcp_stream_is_readable() and decide the socket receive queue is
    not yet filled, so nothing will happen.
    
    Even when sender retransmits packets, phases 2) & 3) repeat
    and flow is effectively frozen, until memory pressure is off.
    
    Fix is to consider tcp_under_memory_pressure() to take care
    of global memory pressure or memcg pressure.

    bpf: Fix bpf_fib_lookup helper MTU check for SKB ctx
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c0a10af688c02adcf127aad29e923e0056c6b69 ]
    
    BPF end-user on Cilium slack-channel (Carlo Carraro) wants to use
    bpf_fib_lookup for doing MTU-check, but *prior* to extending packet size,
    by adjusting fib_params 'tot_len' with the packet length plus the expected
    encap size. (Just like the bpf_check_mtu helper supports). He discovered
    that for SKB ctx the param->tot_len was not used, instead skb->len was used
    (via MTU check in is_skb_forwardable() that checks against netdev MTU).
    
    Fix this by using fib_params 'tot_len' for MTU check. If not provided (e.g.
    zero) then keep existing TC behaviour intact. Notice that 'tot_len' for MTU
    check is done like XDP code-path, which checks against FIB-dst MTU.
    
    V16:
    - Revert V13 optimization, 2nd lookup is against egress/resulting netdev
    
    V13:
    - Only do ifindex lookup one time, calling dev_get_by_index_rcu().
    
    V10:
    - Use same method as XDP for 'tot_len' MTU check

    [ Upstream commit 7d4553b69fb335496c597c31590e982485ebe071 ]
    
    The devmap bulk queue is allocated with GFP_ATOMIC and the allocation
    may fail if there is no available space in existing percpu pool.
    
    Since commit 75ccae62cb8d42 ("xdp: Move devmap bulk queue into struct net_device")
    moved the bulk queue allocation to NETDEV_REGISTER callback, whose context
    is allowed to sleep, use GFP_KERNEL instead of GFP_ATOMIC to let percpu
    allocator extend the pool when needed and avoid possible failure of netdev
    registration.
    
    As the required alignment is natural, we can simply use alloc_percpu().

    bpf: Fix an unitialized value in bpf_iter
    
    [ Upstream commit 17d8beda277a36203585943e70c7909b60775fd5 ]
    
    Commit 15d83c4d7cef ("bpf: Allow loading of a bpf_iter program")
    cached btf_id in struct bpf_iter_target_info so later on
    if it can be checked cheaply compared to checking registered names.
    
    syzbot found a bug that uninitialized value may occur to
    bpf_iter_target_info->btf_id. This is because we allocated
    bpf_iter_target_info structure with kmalloc and never initialized
    field btf_id afterwards. This uninitialized btf_id is typically
    compared to a u32 bpf program func proto btf_id, and the chance
    of being equal is extremely slim.
    
    This patch fixed the issue by using kzalloc which will also
    prevent future likely instances due to adding new fields.

    libbpf: Ignore non function pointer member in struct_ops
    
    [ Upstream commit d2836dddc95d5dd82c7cb23726c97d8c9147f050 ]
    
    When libbpf initializes the kernel's struct_ops in
    "bpf_map__init_kern_struct_ops()", it enforces all
    pointer types must be a function pointer and rejects
    others.  It turns out to be too strict.  For example,
    when directly using "struct tcp_congestion_ops" from vmlinux.h,
    it has a "struct module *owner" member and it is set to NULL
    in a bpf_tcp_cc.o.
    
    Instead, it only needs to ensure the member is a function
    pointer if it has been set (relocated) to a bpf-prog.
    This patch moves the "btf_is_func_proto(kern_mtype)" check
    after the existing "if (!prog) { continue; }".  The original debug
    message in "if (!prog) { continue; }" is also removed since it is
    no longer valid.  Beside, there is a later debug message to tell
    which function pointer is set.
    
    The "btf_is_func_proto(mtype)" has already been guaranteed
    in "bpf_object__collect_st_ops_relos()" which has been run
    before "bpf_map__init_kern_struct_ops()".  Thus, this check
    is removed.
    
    v2:
    - Remove outdated debug message (Andrii)
      Remove because there is a later debug message to tell
      which function pointer is set.
    - Following mtype->type is no longer needed. Remove:
      "skip_mods_and_typedefs(btf, mtype->type, &mtype_id)"
    - Do "if (!prog)" test before skip_mods_and_typedefs.

    offload support of SWP in mlx5e_tunnel_features_check() and set features
    accordingly, this should be reflected in skb offload requested by the
    kernel and we should add the Software Parser offsets only if requested.
    Otherwise, in case HW doesn't support SWP for Geneve, data path will
    mistakenly try to offload Geneve SKBs with skb->encapsulation set,
    regardless of whether offload was requested or not on this specific SKB.

    wait_for_resync is unreliable - if it timeouts, priv_rx will be freed

    if a CQ error happened, and ICOSQ stopped, but later on the queues are
    destroyed, and ICOSQ is flushed with mlx5e_free_icosq_descs.

    deactivation, it accumulates to a significant amount, which causes
    timeouts in some applications (for example, when using bonding with
    NetworkManager).
    
    This commit replaces synchronize_rcu with synchronize_net, which is
    faster when called under rtnl_lock, allowing to speed up the described
    flow.

    net/mlx5: Fix health error state handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 51d138c2610a236c1ed0059d034ee4c74f452b86 ]
    
    Currently, when we discover a fatal error, we are queueing a work that
    will wait for a lock in order to enter the device to error state.
    Meanwhile, FW commands are still being processed, and gets timeouts.
    This can block the driver for few minutes before the work will manage
    to get the lock and enter to error state.
    
    Setting the device to error state before queueing health work, in order
    to avoid FW commands being processed while the work is waiting for the
    lock.

    net/mlx5e: Change interrupt moderation channel params also when channels are closed
    
    [ Upstream commit 65ba8594a238c20e458b3d2d39d91067cbffd0b1 ]
    
    struct mlx5e_params contains fields ({rx,tx}_cq_moderation) that depend
    on two things: whether DIM is enabled and the state of a private flag
    (MLX5E_PFLAG_{RX,TX}_CQE_BASED_MODER). Whenever the DIM state changes,
    mlx5e_reset_{rx,tx}_moderation is called to update the fields, however,
    only if the channels are open. The flow where the channels are closed
    misses the required update of the fields. This commit moves the calls of
    mlx5e_reset_{rx,tx}_moderation, so that they run in both flows.

    net/mlx5e: Don't change interrupt moderation params when DIM is enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 019f93bc4ba3a0dcb77f448ee77fc4c9c1b89565 ]
    
    When mlx5e_ethtool_set_coalesce doesn't change DIM state
    (enabled/disabled), it calls mlx5e_set_priv_channels_coalesce
    unconditionally, which in turn invokes a firmware command to set
    interrupt moderation parameters. It shouldn't happen while DIM manages
    those parameters dynamically (it might even be happening at the same
    time).
    
    This patch fixes it by splitting mlx5e_set_priv_channels_coalesce into
    two functions (for RX and TX) and calling them only when DIM is disabled
    (for RX and TX respectively).

    This limitation was inherited by previous Innova (FPGA) IPsec
    implementation, it uses its private set of RQ handlers which
    does not support XDP, for Connect-X this is no longer true.
    
    Fix by keeping this limitation only for Innova IPsec supporting devices,

    future Connect-X devices for all flows even if IPsec offload is not

    net: phy: consider that suspend2ram may cut off PHY power
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c0d2e96ba055bd8911bb8287def4f8ebbad15b6 ]
    
    Claudiu reported that on his system S2R cuts off power to the PHY and
    after resuming certain PHY settings are lost. The PM folks confirmed
    that cutting off power to selected components in S2R is a valid case.
    Therefore resuming from S2R, same as from hibernation, has to assume
    that the PHY has power-on defaults. As a consequence use the restore
    callback also as resume callback.
    In addition make sure that the interrupt configuration is restored.
    Let's do this in phy_init_hw() and ensure that after this call
    actual interrupt configuration is in sync with phydev->interrupts.
    Currently, if interrupt was enabled before hibernation, we would
    resume with interrupt disabled because that's the power-on default.
    
    This fix applies cleanly only after the commit marked as fixed.
    
    I don't have an affected system, therefore change is compile-tested
    only.

    The "REG_READ(ah, AR_PHY_AGC_CONTROL)" in ath9k_hw_loadnf() does not
    like being called when the hardware is asleep, leading to this crash.
    
    The easiest way to reproduce this is trying to set nf_override while
    the hardware is down:
    
      $ ip link set down dev wlan0
      $ echo "-85" > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/nf_override
    
    Fixing this crash by waking the hardware up before trying to set the
    noise floor. Similar to what other ath9k debugfs files do.
    
    Tested on a Lima board from 8devices, which has a QCA 4531 chipset.

    iwlwifi: pnvm: increment the pointer before checking the TLV
    
    [ Upstream commit ff11a8ee2d2d0f78514ac9b42fb50c525ca695c7 ]
    
    If the SKU_ID doesn't match, we don't increment the pointer and keep
    checking the same TLV over and over again.
    
    We need to increment the pointer in all situtations, namely if the TLV
    is not a SKU_ID, if the SKU_ID matched or if the SKU_ID didn't match.
    So we can increment the pointer already before checking for these
    conditions to solve the problem.

    iwlwifi: pnvm: set the PNVM again if it was already loaded
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a81598f0f39cffbf1c29c4a184063d513661c4a ]
    
    When the interface goes up, we have already loaded the PNVM during
    init, so we don't load it anymore.  But we still need to set the PNVM
    values in the context so that the FW can load it again.
    
    Call set_pnvm when the PNVM is already loaded and change the
    trans_pcie implementation to accept a second call to set_pnvm when we
    have already allocated and, in this case, only set the values without
    allocating again.

    bpf_lru_list: Read double-checked variable once without lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 6df8fb83301d68ea0a0c0e1cbcc790fcc333ed12 ]
    
    For double-checked locking in bpf_common_lru_push_free(), node->type is
    read outside the critical section and then re-checked under the lock.
    However, concurrent writes to node->type result in data races.
    
    For example, the following concurrent access was observed by KCSAN:
    
      write to 0xffff88801521bc22 of 1 bytes by task 10038 on cpu 1:
       __bpf_lru_node_move_in        kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:91
       __local_list_flush            kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:298
       ...
      read to 0xffff88801521bc22 of 1 bytes by task 10043 on cpu 0:
       bpf_common_lru_push_free      kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:507
       bpf_lru_push_free             kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:555
       ...
    
    Fix the data races where node->type is read outside the critical section
    (for double-checked locking) by marking the access with READ_ONCE() as
    well as ensuring the variable is only accessed once.

    iwlwifi: mvm: assign SAR table revision to the command later
    
    [ Upstream commit 28db1862067cb09ebfdccfbc129a52c6fdb4c4d7 ]
    
    The call to iwl_sar_geo_init() was moved to the end of the
    iwl_mvm_sar_geo_init() function, after the table revision is assigned
    to the FW command.  But the revision is only known after
    iwl_sar_geo_init() is called, so we were always assigning zero to it.
    
    Fix that by moving the assignment code after the iwl_sar_geo_init()
    function is called.

    iwlwifi: mvm: send stored PPAG command instead of local
    
    [ Upstream commit 659844d391826bfc5c8b4d9a06869ed51d859c76 ]
    
    Some change conflicts apparently cause a confusion between a local
    variable being used to send the PPAG command and the introduction of a
    union for this command.  Most parts of the local command were never
    copied from the stored data, so the FW was getting garbage in the
    tables instead of getting valid values.
    
    Fix this by completely removing the local and using only the union
    that we have stored in fwrt.

    [ Upstream commit 551d793f65364c904921ac168d4b4028bb51be69 ]
    
    When reading the PPAG table from ACPI, we should store everything in
    our fwrt structure, so it can be accessed later.  But we had a local
    ppag_table variable in the function and were erroneously storing the
    enabled/disabled flag in it instead of storing it in the fwrt.  Fix
    this by removing the local variable and storing everything directly in
    fwrt.

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix the type we use in the PPAG table validity checks
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a6842455c113920001df83cffa28accceeb0927 ]
    
    The value we receive from ACPI is a long long unsigned integer but the
    values should be treated as signed char.  When comparing the received
    value with ACPI_PPAG_MIN_LB/HB, we were doing an unsigned comparison,
    so the negative value would actually be treated as a very high number.
    
    To solve this issue, assign the value to our table of s8's before
    making the comparison, so the value is already converted when we do
    so.

    soc: aspeed: snoop: Add clock control logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f94cf15583be554df7aaa651b8ff8e1b68fbe51 ]
    
    If LPC SNOOP driver is registered ahead of lpc-ctrl module, LPC
    SNOOP block will be enabled without heart beating of LCLK until
    lpc-ctrl enables the LCLK. This issue causes improper handling on
    host interrupts when the host sends interrupt in that time frame.
    Then kernel eventually forcibly disables the interrupt with
    dumping stack and printing a 'nobody cared this irq' message out.
    
    To prevent this issue, all LPC sub-nodes should enable LCLK
    individually so this patch adds clock control logic into the LPC
    SNOOP driver.

    staging: wfx: fix possible panic with re-queued frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 26df933d9b83ea668304dc4ec641d52ea1fc4091 ]
    
    When the firmware rejects a frame (because station become asleep or
    disconnected), the frame is re-queued in mac80211. However, the
    re-queued frame was 8 bytes longer than the original one (the size of
    the ICV for the encryption). So, when mac80211 try to send this frame
    again, it is a little bigger than expected.
    If the frame is re-queued secveral time it end with a skb_over_panic
    because the skb buffer is not large enough.
    
    Note it only happens when device acts as an AP and encryption is
    enabled.
    
    This patch more or less reverts the commit 049fde130419 ("staging: wfx:

    Storing a bogus i2c_client structure on the stack adds overhead and

    Rename this parition to "a53-firmware" to avoid confusion for users,
    since they cannot simply build U-Boot from U-Boot repository and flash

    the sources from the mox-boot-builder repository [1] and flash the

    staging: rtl8723bs: wifi_regd.c: Fix incorrect number of regulatory rules
    
    [ Upstream commit 61834c967a929f6b4b7fcb91f43fa225cc29aa19 ]
    
    The custom regulatory ruleset in the rtl8723bs driver lists an incorrect
    number of rules: one too many. This results in an out-of-bounds access,
    as detected by KASAN. This was possible thanks to the newly added support
    for KASAN on ARMv7.
    
    Fix this by filling in the correct number of rules given.
    
    KASAN report:

    usb: dwc2: Make "trimming xfer length" a debug message
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a9e38cabd80356ffb98c2c88fec528ea9644fd5 ]
    
    With some USB network adapters, such as DM96xx, the following message
    is seen for each maximum size receive packet.
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_update_urb_state(): trimming xfer length
    
    This happens because the packet size requested by the driver is 1522
    bytes, wMaxPacketSize is 64, the dwc2 driver configures the chip to
    receive 24*64 = 1536 bytes, and the chip does indeed send more than
    1522 bytes of data. Since the event does not indicate an error condition,
    the message is just noise. Demote it to debug level.

    usb: dwc2: Abort transaction after errors with unknown reason
    
    [ Upstream commit f74b68c61cbc4b2245022fcce038509333d63f6f ]
    
    In some situations, the following error messages are reported.
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_hc_chhltd_intr_dma: Channel 1 - ChHltd set, but reason is unknown
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: hcint 0x00000002, intsts 0x04000021
    
    This is sometimes followed by:
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_update_urb_state_abn(): trimming xfer length
    
    and then:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/v4.19/drivers/usb/dwc2/hcd.c:2913
                            dwc2_assign_and_init_hc+0x98c/0x990
    
    The warning suggests that an odd buffer address is to be used for DMA.
    
    After an error is observed, the receive buffer may be full
    (urb->actual_length >= urb->length). However, the urb is still left in
    the queue unless three errors were observed in a row. When it is queued
    again, the dwc2 hcd code translates this into a 1-block transfer.
    If urb->actual_length (ie the total expected receive length) is not
    DMA-aligned, the buffer pointer programmed into the chip will be
    unaligned. This results in the observed warning.
    
    To solve the problem, abort input transactions after an error with
    unknown cause if the entire packet was already received. This may be
    a bit drastic, but we don't really know why the transfer was aborted
    even though the entire packet was received. Aborting the transfer in
    this situation is less risky than accepting a potentially corrupted
    packet.
    
    With this patch in place, the 'ChHltd set' and 'trimming xfer length'
    messages are still observed, but there are no more transfer attempts
    with odd buffer addresses.

    usb: dwc2: Do not update data length if it is 0 on inbound transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit 415fa1c7305dedbb345e2cc8ac91769bc1c83f1a ]
    
    The DWC2 documentation states that transfers with zero data length should
    set the number of packets to 1 and the transfer length to 0. This is not
    currently the case for inbound transfers: the transfer length is set to
    the maximum packet length. This can have adverse effects if the chip
    actually does transfer data as it is programmed to do. Follow chip
    documentation and keep the transfer length set to 0 in that situation.

    ARM: dts: Configure missing thermal interrupt for 4430
    
    [ Upstream commit 44f416879a442600b006ef7dec3a6dc98bcf59c6 ]
    
    We have gpio_86 wired internally to the bandgap thermal shutdown
    interrupt on 4430 like we have it on 4460 according to the TRM.
    This can be found easily by searching for TSHUT.
    
    For some reason the thermal shutdown interrupt was never added
    for 4430, let's add it. I believe this is needed for the thermal
    shutdown interrupt handler ti_bandgap_tshut_irq_handler() to call
    orderly_poweroff().

    usb: gadget: u_audio: Free requests only after callback
    
    [ Upstream commit 7de8681be2cde9f6953d3be1fa6ce05f9fe6e637 ]
    
    As per the kernel doc for usb_ep_dequeue(), it states that "this
    routine is asynchronous, that is, it may return before the completion
    routine runs". And indeed since v5.0 the dwc3 gadget driver updated
    its behavior to place dequeued requests on to a cancelled list to be
    given back later after the endpoint is stopped.
    
    The free_ep() was incorrectly assuming that a request was ready to
    be freed after calling dequeue which results in a use-after-free
    in dwc3 when it traverses its cancelled list. Fix this by moving
    the usb_ep_free_request() call to the callback itself in case the
    ep is disabled.

    ACPICA: Fix exception code class checks
    
    [ Upstream commit 3dfaea3811f8b6a89a347e8da9ab862cdf3e30fe ]
    
    ACPICA commit 1a3a549286ea9db07d7ec700e7a70dd8bcc4354e
    
    The macros to classify different AML exception codes are broken. For
    instance,
    
      ACPI_ENV_EXCEPTION(Status)
    
    will always evaluate to zero due to
    
      #define AE_CODE_ENVIRONMENTAL      0x0000
      #define ACPI_ENV_EXCEPTION(Status) (Status & AE_CODE_ENVIRONMENTAL)
    
    Similarly, ACPI_AML_EXCEPTION(Status) will evaluate to a non-zero
    value for error codes of type AE_CODE_PROGRAMMER, AE_CODE_ACPI_TABLES,
    as well as AE_CODE_AML, and not just AE_CODE_AML as the name suggests.
    
    This commit fixes those checks.

    [ Upstream commit c6433083f5930fdf52ad47c8c0459719c810dc89 ]
    
    The gmac2phy is integrated with the PHY within the SoC. Any properties
    related to this integration can be included in the .dtsi file, instead
    of having board dts files specify them separately.
    
    Add the clock_in_out property to specify the direction of the PHY clock.
    This is the minimum required to have gmac2phy working on Linux. Other
    examples include assigned-clocks, assigned-clock-rates, and
    assigned-clock-parents properties, but the hardware default plus the
    implementation requesting the appropriate clock rate also works.

    [ Upstream commit 3716a583fe0bbe3babf4ce260064a7fa13d6d989 ]
    
    When the BMC150 accelerometer/magnetometer was added to the device tree,
    the sensors were working without specifying any regulator supplies,
    likely because the regulators were on by default and then never turned off.
    
    For some reason, this is no longer the case for pm8916_l17, which prevents
    the sensors from working in some cases.
    
    Now that the bmc150_accel/bmc150_magn drivers can enable necessary
    regulators, declare the necessary regulator supplies to make the sensors
    work again.

    [ Upstream commit 948c657cc45e8ce48cb533d4e2106145fa765759 ]
    
    In contrast to the H6 (and later) manuals, the A64 datasheet does not
    specify any limitations in the maximum possible frequency for eMMC
    controllers.
    However experimentation has found that a 150 MHz limit similar to other
    SoCs and also the MMC0 and MMC1 controllers on the A64 seems to exist
    for the MMC2 controller.
    
    Limit the frequency for the MMC2 controller to 150 MHz in the SoC .dtsi.
    The Pinebook seems to be the an odd exception, since it apparently seems
    to work with 200 MHz as well, so overwrite this in its board .dts file.
    
    Tested on a Pine64-LTS: 200 MHz HS-200 fails, 150 MHz HS-200 works.

    [ Upstream commit cfe6c487b9a1abc6197714ec5605716a5428cf03 ]
    
    The H6 manual explicitly lists a frequency limit of 150 MHz for the bus
    frequency of the MMC controllers. So far we had no explicit limits in the
    DT, which limited eMMC to the spec defined frequencies, or whatever the
    driver defines (both Linux and FreeBSD use 52 MHz here).
    
    Put those maximum frequencies in the SoC .dtsi, to allow higher speed
    modes (which still would need to be explicitly enabled, per board).
    
    Tested with an eMMC using HS-200 on a Pine H64. Running at the spec'ed
    200 MHz indeed fails with I/O errors, but 150 MHz seems to work stably.

    [ Upstream commit 941432d007689f3774646e41a1439228b6c6ee0e ]
    
    The SD card on the SoPine SoM module is somewhat concealed, so was
    originally defined as "non-removable".
    However there is a working card-detect pin (tested on two different
    SoM versions), and in certain SoM base boards it might be actually
    accessible at runtime.
    Also the Pine64-LTS shares the SoPine base .dtsi, so inherited the
    non-removable flag, even though the SD card slot is perfectly accessible
    and usable there. (It turns out that just *my* board has a broken card
    detect switch, so I originally thought CD wouldn't work on the LTS.)
    
    Drop the "non-removable" flag to describe the SD card slot properly.

    [ Upstream commit da2fb8457f71138d455cba82edec0d34f858e506 ]
    
    In recent Allwinner SoCs the first USB host controller (HCI0) shares
    the first PHY with the MUSB controller. Probably to make this sharing
    work, we were avoiding to declare this in the DT. This has two
    shortcomings:
    - U-Boot (which uses the same .dts) cannot use this port in host mode
      without a PHY linked, so we were loosing one USB port there.
    - It requires the MUSB driver to be enabled and loaded, although we
      don't actually use it.
    
    To avoid those issues, let's add this PHY link to the H6 .dtsi file.
    After all PHY port 0 *is* connected to HCI0, so we should describe
    it as this.
    
    This makes it work in U-Boot, also improves compatiblity when no MUSB
    driver is loaded (for instance in distribution installers).

    [ Upstream commit 826e6faf49ae1eb065759a30832a2e34740bd8b1 ]
    
    Unlike most MSM8916 boards, samsung-a5u uses WCN3660B instead of
    WCN3620 to support the 5 GHz band additionally.
    
    WCN3660B has similar requirements as WCN3620, but it needs the XO
    clock to run at 48 MHz instead of 19.2 MHz. So far it was possible
    to describe that configuration using the qcom,wcn3680 compatible.
    
    However, as of commit 8490987bdb9a ("wcn36xx: Hook and identify RF_IRIS_WCN3680"),
    the wcn36xx driver will now use the qcom,wcn3680 compatible
    to enable functionality specific to WCN3680. In particular,
    WCN3680 supports 802.11ac, which is not available in WCN3660B.
    
    Use the new qcom,wcn3660b compatible to describe the chip properly.

    [ Upstream commit 88753cc19f087abe0d39644b844e67a59cfb5a3d ]
    
    The recent change to the bulk transfer compat function missed the fact
    the relevant ioctl command is VCHIQ_IOC_QUEUE_BULK_TRANSMIT32, not
    VCHIQ_IOC_QUEUE_BULK_TRANSMIT, as any attempt to send a bulk block
    to the VPU would have shown.

    The addition of the local 'userdata' pointer to

    WAITING modes are used, in which case the value provided by the

    Bluetooth: hci_uart: Fix a race for write_work scheduling
    
    [ Upstream commit afe0b1c86458f121b085271e4f3034017a90d4a3 ]
    
    In hci_uart_write_work, there is a loop/goto checking the value of
    HCI_UART_TX_WAKEUP. If HCI_UART_TX_WAKEUP is set again, it keeps trying
    hci_uart_dequeue; otherwise, it clears HCI_UART_SENDING and returns.
    
    In hci_uart_tx_wakeup, if HCI_UART_SENDING is already set, it sets
    HCI_UART_TX_WAKEUP, skips schedule_work and assumes the running/pending
    hci_uart_write_work worker will do hci_uart_dequeue properly.
    
    However, if the HCI_UART_SENDING check in hci_uart_tx_wakeup is done after
    the loop breaks, but before HCI_UART_SENDING is cleared in
    hci_uart_write_work, the schedule_work is skipped incorrectly.
    
    Fix this race by changing the order of HCI_UART_SENDING and
    HCI_UART_TX_WAKEUP modification.

    ALSA: pcm: Don't call sync_stop if it hasn't been stopped
    
    commit 700cb70730777c159a988e01daa93f20a1ae9b58 upstream.
    
    The PCM stop operation sets the stop_operating flag for indicating the
    sync_stop post-process.  This flag is, however, set unconditionally
    even if the PCM trigger weren't issued.  This may lead to
    inconsistency in the driver side.
    
    Correct the code to set stop_operating flag only after the trigger
    STOP is actually called.

    ALSA: pcm: Assure sync with the pending stop operation at suspend
    
    commit 2c87c1a49c9d113a9f3e8e951d7d64be5ff50ac1 upstream.
    
    The current PCM code calls the sync_stop at the resume action due to
    the analogy to the PCM prepare call pattern.  But, it makes little
    sense, as the sync should have been done rather at the suspend time,
    not at the resume time.
    
    This patch corrects the sync_stop call at suspend/resume to assure the
    sync before finishing the suspend.

    ALSA: pcm: Call sync_stop at disconnection
    
    commit 29bb274e94974669acb5186a75538f20df1508b6 upstream.
    
    The PCM core should perform the sync for the pending stop operations
    at disconnection.  Otherwise it may lead to unexpected access.
    
    Currently the old user of sync_stop, USB-audio driver, has its own
    sync, so this isn't needed, but it's better to guarantee the sync in
    the PCM core level.
    
    This patch adds the missing sync_stop call at PCM disconnection
    callback.  It also assures the IRQ sync if it's specified in the
    card.  snd_pcm_sync_stop() is slightly modified to be called also for
    any PCM substream object now.

    commit 8ac7c87acdcac156670f9920c8acbd84308ff4b1 upstream.

    zsmalloc: account the number of compacted pages correctly
    
    commit 2395928158059b8f9858365fce7713ce7fef62e4 upstream.
    
    There exists multiple path may do zram compaction concurrently.
    1. auto-compaction triggered during memory reclaim
    2. userspace utils write zram<id>/compaction node
    
    So, multiple threads may call zs_shrinker_scan/zs_compact concurrently.
    But pages_compacted is a per zsmalloc pool variable and modification
    of the variable is not serialized(through under class->lock).
    There are two issues here:
    1. the pages_compacted may not equal to total number of pages
    freed(due to concurrently add).
    2. zs_shrinker_scan may not return the correct number of pages
    freed(issued by current shrinker).
    
    The fix is simple:
    1. account the number of pages freed in zs_compact locally.
    2. use actomic variable pages_compacted to accumulate total number.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix PCM buffer allocation in non-vmalloc mode
    
    commit fb3c293b82c31a9a68fbcf4e7a45fadd8a47ea2b upstream.
    
    The commit f274baa49be6 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Allow non-vmalloc buffer
    for PCM buffers") introduced the mode to allocate coherent pages for
    PCM buffers, and it used bus->controller device as its DMA device.
    It turned out, however, that bus->sysdev is a more appropriate device
    to be used for DMA mapping in HCD code.
    
    This patch corrects the device reference accordingly.
    
    Note that, on most platforms, both point to the very same device,
    hence this patch doesn't change anything practically.  But on
    platforms like xhcd-plat hcd, the change becomes effective.

    bfq: Avoid false bfq queue merging
    
    commit 41e76c85660c022c6bf5713bfb6c21e64a487cec upstream.
    
    bfq_setup_cooperator() uses bfqd->in_serv_last_pos so detect whether it
    makes sense to merge current bfq queue with the in-service queue.
    However if the in-service queue is freshly scheduled and didn't dispatch
    any requests yet, bfqd->in_serv_last_pos is stale and contains value
    from the previously scheduled bfq queue which can thus result in a bogus
    decision that the two queues should be merged. This bug can be observed
    for example with the following fio jobfile:
    
    [global]
    direct=0
    ioengine=sync
    invalidate=1
    size=1g
    rw=read
    
    [reader]
    numjobs=4
    directory=/mnt
    
    where the 4 processes will end up in the one shared bfq queue although
    they do IO to physically very distant files (for some reason I was able to
    observe this only with slice_idle=1ms setting).
    
    Fix the problem by invalidating bfqd->in_serv_last_pos when switching
    in-service queue.

    kdb: Make memory allocations more robust
    
    commit 93f7a6d818deef69d0ba652d46bae6fbabbf365c upstream.
    
    Currently kdb uses in_interrupt() to determine whether its library
    code has been called from the kgdb trap handler or from a saner calling
    context such as driver init. This approach is broken because
    in_interrupt() alone isn't able to determine kgdb trap handler entry from
    normal task context. This can happen during normal use of basic features
    such as breakpoints and can also be trivially reproduced using:
    echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
    
    We can improve this by adding check for in_dbg_master() instead which
    explicitly determines if we are running in debugger context.

    driver core: auxiliary bus: Fix calling stage for auxiliary bus init
    
    commit 471b12c43f376d5203dbff0e91316eea11f6f4df upstream.
    
    When the auxiliary device code is built into the kernel, it can be executed
    before the auxiliary bus is registered. This causes bus->p to be not
    allocated and triggers a NULL pointer dereference when the auxiliary bus
    device gets added with bus_add_device(). Call the auxiliary_bus_init()
    under driver_init() so the bus is initialized before devices.
    
    Below is the kernel splat for the bug:

    debugfs: do not attempt to create a new file before the filesystem is initalized
    
    commit 56348560d495d2501e87db559a61de717cd3ab02 upstream.
    
    Some subsystems want to add debugfs files at early boot, way before
    debugfs is initialized.  This seems to work somehow as the vfs layer
    will not allow it to happen, but let's be explicit and test to ensure we
    are properly up and running before allowing files to be created.

    debugfs: be more robust at handling improper input in debugfs_lookup()
    
    commit bc6de804d36b3709d54fa22bd128cbac91c11526 upstream.
    
    debugfs_lookup() doesn't like it if it is passed an illegal name
    pointer, or if the filesystem isn't even initialized yet.  If either of
    these happen, it will crash the system, so fix it up by properly testing
    for valid input and that we are up and running before trying to find a
    file in the filesystem.

    vdpa/mlx5: fix param validation in mlx5_vdpa_get_config()
    
    commit dcfde1635e764fd69cc756c7780d144e288608e9 upstream.
    
    It's legal to have 'offset + len' equal to
    sizeof(struct virtio_net_config), since 'ndev->config' is a
    'struct virtio_net_config', so we can safely copy its content under
    this condition.

    vmlinux.lds.h: add DWARF v5 sections
    
    commit 3c4fa46b30c551b1df2fb1574a684f68bc22067c upstream.
    
    We expect toolchains to produce these new debug info sections as part of
    DWARF v5. Add explicit placements to prevent the linker warnings from
    --orphan-section=warn.
    
    Compilers may produce such sections with explicit -gdwarf-5, or based on
    the implicit default version of DWARF when -g is used via DEBUG_INFO.
    This implicit default changes over time, and has changed to DWARF v5
    with GCC 11.
    
    .debug_sup was mentioned in review, but without compilers producing it
    today, let's wait to add it until it becomes necessary.
