    can: m_can.c: fix setup of CCCR register: clear CCCR NISO bit before checking can.ctrlmode
    
    commit 393753b217f05474e714aea36c37501546ed1202 upstream.
    
    Inside m_can_chip_config(), when setting up the new value of the CCCR,
    the CCCR_NISO bit is not cleared like the others, CCCR_TEST, CCCR_MON,
    CCCR_BRSE and CCCR_FDOE, before checking the can.ctrlmode bits for
    CAN_CTRLMODE_FD_NON_ISO.
    
    This way once the controller was configured for CAN_CTRLMODE_FD_NON_ISO,
    this mode could never be cleared again.
    
    This fix is only relevant for controllers with version 3.1.x or 3.2.x.
    Older versions do not support NISO.

    can: m_can: Fix runtime resume call
    
    commit 1675bee3e732c2449e792feed9caff804f3bd42c upstream.
    
    pm_runtime_get_sync() returns a 1 if the state of the device is already
    'active'. This is not a failure case and should return a success.
    
    Therefore fix error handling for pm_runtime_get_sync() call such that
    it returns success when the value is 1.
    
    Also cleanup the TODO for using runtime PM for sleep mode as that is
    implemented.

    can: peak_canfd: fix firmware < v3.3.0: limit allocation to 32-bit DMA addr only
    
    commit 5d4c94ed9f564224d7b37dbee13f7c5d4a8a01ac upstream.
    
    The DMA logic in firmwares < v3.3.0 embedded in the PCAN-PCIe FD cards
    family is not capable of handling a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit logical
    addresses. If the board is equipped with 2 or 4 CAN ports, then such a
    situation might lead to a PCIe Bus Error "Malformed TLP" packet
    as well as "irq xx: nobody cared" issue.
    
    This patch adds a workaround that requests only 32-bit DMA addresses
    when these might be allocated outside of the 4 GB area.
    
    This issue has been fixed in firmware v3.3.0 and next.

    can: xilinx_can: keep only 1-2 frames in TX FIFO to fix TX accounting
    
    commit 620050d9c2be15c47017ba95efe59e0832e99a56 upstream.
    
    The xilinx_can driver assumes that the TXOK interrupt only clears after
    it has been acknowledged as many times as there have been successfully
    sent frames.
    
    However, the documentation does not mention such behavior, instead
    saying just that the interrupt is cleared when the clear bit is set.
    
    Similarly, testing seems to also suggest that it is immediately cleared
    regardless of the amount of frames having been sent. Performing some
    heavy TX load and then going back to idle has the tx_head drifting
    further away from tx_tail over time, steadily reducing the amount of
    frames the driver keeps in the TX FIFO (but not to zero, as the TXOK
    interrupt always frees up space for 1 frame from the driver's
    perspective, so frames continue to be sent) and delaying the local echo
    frames.
    
    The TX FIFO tracking is also otherwise buggy as it does not account for
    TX FIFO being cleared after software resets, causing
      BUG!, TX FIFO full when queue awake!
    messages to be output.
    
    There does not seem to be any way to accurately track the state of the
    TX FIFO for local echo support while using the full TX FIFO.
    
    The Zynq version of the HW (but not the soft-AXI version) has watermark
    programming support and with it an additional TX-FIFO-empty interrupt
    bit.
    
    Modify the driver to only put 1 frame into TX FIFO at a time on soft-AXI
    and 2 frames at a time on Zynq. On Zynq the TXFEMP interrupt bit is used
    to detect whether 1 or 2 frames have been sent at interrupt processing
    time.
    
    Tested with the integrated CAN on Zynq-7000 SoC. The 1-frame-FIFO mode
    was also tested.
    
    An alternative way to solve this would be to drop local echo support but
    keep using the full TX FIFO.
    
    v2: Add FIFO space check before TX queue wake with locking to
    synchronize with queue stop. This avoids waking the queue when xmit()
    had just filled it.
    
    v3: Keep local echo support and reduce the amount of frames in FIFO
    instead as suggested by Marc Kleine-Budde.

    commit 2574fe54515ed3487405de329e4e9f13d7098c10 upstream.
    
    The xilinx_can driver performs a software reset when an RX overrun is
    detected. This causes the device to enter Configuration mode where no
    messages are received or transmitted.
    
    The documentation does not mention any need to perform a reset on an RX
    overrun, and testing by inducing an RX overflow also indicated that the
    device continues to work just fine without a reset.
    
    Remove the software reset.

    commit 877e0b75947e2c7acf5624331bb17ceb093c98ae upstream.
    
    The xilinx_can driver contains no mechanism for propagating recovery
    from CAN_STATE_ERROR_WARNING and CAN_STATE_ERROR_PASSIVE.
    
    Add such a mechanism by factoring the handling of
    XCAN_STATE_ERROR_PASSIVE and XCAN_STATE_ERROR_WARNING out of
    xcan_err_interrupt and checking for recovery after RX and TX if the
    interface is in one of those states.

    can: xilinx_can: fix power management handling
    
    commit 8ebd83bdb027f29870d96649dba18b91581ea829 upstream.
    
    There are several issues with the suspend/resume handling code of the
    driver:
    
    - The device is attached and detached in the runtime_suspend() and
      runtime_resume() callbacks if the interface is running. However,
      during xcan_chip_start() the interface is considered running,
      causing the resume handler to incorrectly call netif_start_queue()
      at the beginning of xcan_chip_start(), and on xcan_chip_start() error
      return the suspend handler detaches the device leaving the user
      unable to bring-up the device anymore.
    
    - The device is not brought properly up on system resume. A reset is
      done and the code tries to determine the bus state after that.
      However, after reset the device is always in Configuration mode
      (down), so the state checking code does not make sense and
      communication will also not work.
    
    - The suspend callback tries to set the device to sleep mode (low-power
      mode which monitors the bus and brings the device back to normal mode
      on activity), but then immediately disables the clocks (possibly
      before the device reaches the sleep mode), which does not make sense
      to me. If a clean shutdown is wanted before disabling clocks, we can
      just bring it down completely instead of only sleep mode.
    
    Reorganize the PM code so that only the clock logic remains in the
    runtime PM callbacks and the system PM callbacks contain the device
    bring-up/down logic. This makes calling the runtime PM callbacks during
    e.g. xcan_chip_start() safe.
    
    The system PM callbacks now simply call common code to start/stop the
    HW if the interface was running, replacing the broken code from before.
    
    xcan_chip_stop() is updated to use the common reset code so that it will
    wait for the reset to complete. Reset also disables all interrupts so do
    not do that separately.
    
    Also, the device_may_wakeup() checks are removed as the driver does not
    have wakeup support.
    
    Tested on Zynq-7000 integrated CAN.

    can: xilinx_can: fix RX loop if RXNEMP is asserted without RXOK
    
    commit 32852c561bffd613d4ed7ec464b1e03e1b7b6c5c upstream.
    
    If the device gets into a state where RXNEMP (RX FIFO not empty)
    interrupt is asserted without RXOK (new frame received successfully)
    interrupt being asserted, xcan_rx_poll() will continue to try to clear
    RXNEMP without actually reading frames from RX FIFO. If the RX FIFO is
    not empty, the interrupt will not be cleared and napi_schedule() will
    just be called again.
    
    This situation can occur when:
    
    (a) xcan_rx() returns without reading RX FIFO due to an error condition.
    The code tries to clear both RXOK and RXNEMP but RXNEMP will not clear
    due to a frame still being in the FIFO. The frame will never be read
    from the FIFO as RXOK is no longer set.
    
    (b) A frame is received between xcan_rx_poll() reading interrupt status
    and clearing RXOK. RXOK will be cleared, but RXNEMP will again remain
    set as the new message is still in the FIFO.
    
    I'm able to trigger case (b) by flooding the bus with frames under load.
    
    There does not seem to be any benefit in using both RXNEMP and RXOK in
    the way the driver does, and the polling example in the reference manual
    (UG585 v1.10 18.3.7 Read Messages from RxFIFO) also says that either
    RXOK or RXNEMP can be used for detecting incoming messages.
    
    Fix the issue and simplify the RX processing by only using RXNEMP
    without RXOK.

    driver core: Partially revert "driver core: correct device's shutdown order"
    
    commit 722e5f2b1eec7de61117b7c0a7914761e3da2eda upstream.
    
    Commit 52cdbdd49853 (driver core: correct device's shutdown order)
    introduced a regression by breaking device shutdown on some systems.
    
    Namely, the devices_kset_move_last() call in really_probe() added by
    that commit is a mistake as it may cause parents to follow children
    in the devices_kset list which then causes shutdown to fail.  For
    example, if a device has children before really_probe() is called
    for it (which is not uncommon), that call will cause it to be
    reordered after the children in the devices_kset list and the
    ordering of that list will not reflect the correct device shutdown
    order any more.
    
    Also it causes the devices_kset list to be constantly reordered
    until all drivers have been probed which is totally pointless
    overhead in the majority of cases and it only covered an issue
    with system shutdown, while system-wide suspend/resume potentially
    had the same issue on the affected platforms (which was not covered).
    
    Moreover, the shutdown issue originally addressed by the change in
    really_probe() made by commit 52cdbdd49853 is not present in 4.18-rc
    any more, since dra7 started to use the sdhci-omap driver which
    doesn't disable any regulators during shutdown, so the really_probe()
    part of commit 52cdbdd49853 can be safely reverted.  [The original
    issue was related to the omap_hsmmc driver used by dra7 previously.]
    
    For the above reasons, revert the really_probe() modifications made
    by commit 52cdbdd49853.
    
    The other code changes made by commit 52cdbdd49853 are useful and
    they need not be reverted.

    ACPICA: AML Parser: ignore dispatcher error status during table load
    
    commit 73c2a01c52b657f4a0ead6c95f64c5279efbd000 upstream.
    
    The dispatcher and the executer process the parse nodes During table
    load. Error status from the evaluation confuses the AML parser. This
    results in the parser failing to complete parsing of the current
    scope op which becomes problematic. For the incorrect AML below, _ADR
    never gets created.
    
    definition_block(...)
    {
       Scope (\_SB)
       {
         Device (PCI0){...}
         Name (OBJ1, 0x0)
         OBJ1 = PCI0 + 5 // Results in an operand error.
       } // \_SB not closed
    
       // parser looks for \_SB._SB.PCI0, results in AE_NOT_FOUND error
       // Entire scope block gets skipped.
       Scope (\_SB.PCI0)
       {
           Name (_ADR, 0x0)
       }
    }
    
    Fix the above error by properly completing the initial \_SB scope
    after an error by clearing errors that occur during table load. In
    the above case, this means that OBJ1 = PIC0 + 5 is skipped.

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Only return delayed status when len is 0
    
    commit 4d644abf25698362bd33d17c9ddc8f7122c30f17 upstream.
    
    Commit 1b9ba000 ("Allow function drivers to pause control
    transfers") states that USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS is only
    supported if data phase is 0 bytes.
    
    It seems that when the length is not 0 bytes, there is no
    need to explicitly delay the data stage since the transfer
    is not completed until the user responds. However, when the
    length is 0, there is no data stage and the transfer is
    finished once setup() returns, hence there is a need to
    explicitly delay completion.
    
    This manifests as the following bugs:
    
    Prior to 946ef68ad4e4 ('Let setup() return
    USB_GADGET_DELAYED_STATUS'), when setup is 0 bytes, ffs
    would require user to queue a 0 byte request in order to
    clear setup state. However, that 0 byte request was actually
    not needed and would hang and cause errors in other setup
    requests.
    
    After the above commit, 0 byte setups work since the gadget
    now accepts empty queues to ep0 to clear the delay, but all
    other setups hang.

    The current code is broken as it re-defines "req" inside the
    if block, then goto out of it. Thus the request that ends
    up being sent is not the one that was populated by the
    code in question.
    
    This fixes RNDIS driver autodetect by Windows 10 for me.
    
    The bug was introduced by Chris rework to remove the local
    queuing inside the if { } block of the redefined request.

    usb: dwc2: Fix DMA alignment to start at allocated boundary
    
    commit 56406e017a883b54b339207b230f85599f4d70ae upstream.
    
    The commit 3bc04e28a030 ("usb: dwc2: host: Get aligned DMA in a more
    supported way") introduced a common way to align DMA allocations.
    The code in the commit aligns the struct dma_aligned_buffer but the
    actual DMA address pointed by data[0] gets aligned to an offset from
    the allocated boundary by the kmalloc_ptr and the old_xfer_buffer
    pointers.
    
    This is against the recommendation in Documentation/DMA-API.txt which
    states:
    
      Therefore, it is recommended that driver writers who don't take
      special care to determine the cache line size at run time only map
      virtual regions that begin and end on page boundaries (which are
      guaranteed also to be cache line boundaries).
    
    The effect of this is that architectures with non-coherent DMA caches
    may run into memory corruption or kernel crashes with Unhandled
    kernel unaligned accesses exceptions.
    
    Fix the alignment by positioning the DMA area in front of the allocation
    and use memory at the end of the area for storing the orginal
    transfer_buffer pointer. This may have the added benefit of increased
    performance as the DMA area is now fully aligned on all architectures.
    
    Tested with Lantiq xRX200 (MIPS) and RPi Model B Rev 2 (ARM).

    usb: core: handle hub C_PORT_OVER_CURRENT condition
    
    commit 249a32b7eeb3edb6897dd38f89651a62163ac4ed upstream.
    
    Based on USB2.0 Spec Section 11.12.5,
    
      "If a hub has per-port power switching and per-port current limiting,
      an over-current on one port may still cause the power on another port
      to fall below specific minimums. In this case, the affected port is
      placed in the Power-Off state and C_PORT_OVER_CURRENT is set for the
      port, but PORT_OVER_CURRENT is not set."
    
    so let's check C_PORT_OVER_CURRENT too for over current condition.

    If softsynthx_read() is called with `count < 3`, `count - 3` wraps, causing
    the loop to copy as much data as available to the provided buffer. If
    softsynthx_read() is invoked through sys_splice(), this causes an
    unbounded kernel write; but even when userspace just reads from it
    normally, a small size could cause userspace crashes.

    Commit b83b8b1881c4 ("staging:r8188eu: Use lib80211 to support TKIP")
    is causing 2 problems for me:
    
    1) One boot the wifi on a laptop with a r8188eu wifi device would not
       connect and dmesg contained an oops about scheduling while atomic
       pointing to the tkip code. This went away after reverting the commit.
    
    2) I reverted the revert to try and get the oops from 1. again to be able
       to add it to this commit message. But now the system did connect to the
       wifi only to print a whole bunch of oopses, followed by a hardfreeze a
       few seconds later. Subsequent reboots also all lead to scenario 2. Until
       I reverted the commit again.
    
    Revert the commit fixes both issues making the laptop usable again.

    tcp: detect malicious patterns in tcp_collapse_ofo_queue()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d4bf93ac12003f9b8e1e2de37fe27983deebdcf ]
    
    In case an attacker feeds tiny packets completely out of order,
    tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() might scan the whole rb-tree, performing
    expensive copies, but not changing socket memory usage at all.
    
    1) Do not attempt to collapse tiny skbs.
    2) Add logic to exit early when too many tiny skbs are detected.
    
    We prefer not doing aggressive collapsing (which copies packets)
    for pathological flows, and revert to tcp_prune_ofo_queue() which
    will be less expensive.
    
    In the future, we might add the possibility of terminating flows
    that are proven to be malicious.

    tcp: avoid collapses in tcp_prune_queue() if possible
    
    [ Upstream commit f4a3313d8e2ca9fd8d8f45e40a2903ba782607e7 ]
    
    Right after a TCP flow is created, receiving tiny out of order
    packets allways hit the condition :
    
    if (atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc) >= sk->sk_rcvbuf)
            tcp_clamp_window(sk);
    
    tcp_clamp_window() increases sk_rcvbuf to match sk_rmem_alloc
    (guarded by tcp_rmem[2])
    
    Calling tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() in this case is not useful,
    and offers a O(N^2) surface attack to malicious peers.
    
    Better not attempt anything before full queue capacity is reached,
    forcing attacker to spend lots of resource and allow us to more
    easily detect the abuse.

    tcp: free batches of packets in tcp_prune_ofo_queue()
    
    [ Upstream commit 72cd43ba64fc172a443410ce01645895850844c8 ]
    
    Juha-Matti Tilli reported that malicious peers could inject tiny
    packets in out_of_order_queue, forcing very expensive calls
    to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for
    every incoming packet. out_of_order_queue rb-tree can contain
    thousands of nodes, iterating over all of them is not nice.
    
    Before linux-4.9, we would have pruned all packets in ofo_queue
    in one go, every XXXX packets. XXXX depends on sk_rcvbuf and skbs
    truesize, but is about 7000 packets with tcp_rmem[2] default of 6 MB.
    
    Since we plan to increase tcp_rmem[2] in the future to cope with
    modern BDP, can not revert to the old behavior, without great pain.
    
    Strategy taken in this patch is to purge ~12.5 % of the queue capacity.

    vxlan: fix default fdb entry netlink notify ordering during netdev create
    
    [ Upstream commit e99465b952861533d9ba748fdbecc96d9a36da3e ]
    
    Problem:
    In vxlan_newlink, a default fdb entry is added before register_netdev.
    The default fdb creation function also notifies user-space of the
    fdb entry on the vxlan device which user-space does not know about yet.
    (RTM_NEWNEIGH goes before RTM_NEWLINK for the same ifindex).
    
    This patch fixes the user-space netlink notification ordering issue
    with the following changes:
    - decouple fdb notify from fdb create.
    - Move fdb notify after register_netdev.
    - Call rtnl_configure_link in vxlan newlink handler to notify
    userspace about the newlink before fdb notify and
    hence avoiding the user-space race.

    If a newlink handler wants to call rtnl_configure_link

    net/mlx5: Adjust clock overflow work period
    
    [ Upstream commit 33180bee86a8940a84950edca46315cd9dd6deb5 ]
    
    When driver converts HW timestamp to wall clock time it subtracts
    the last saved cycle counter from the HW timestamp and converts the
    difference to nanoseconds.
    The conversion is done by multiplying the cycles difference with the
    clock multiplier value as a first step and therefore the cycles
    difference should be small enough so that the multiplication product
    doesn't exceed 64bit.
    
    The overflow handling routine is in charge of updating the last saved
    cycle counter in driver and it is called periodically using kernel
    delayed workqueue.
    
    The delay period for this work is calculated using the max HW cycle
    counter value (a 41 bit mask) as a base which doesn't take the 64bit
    limit into account so the delay period may be incorrect and too
    long to prevent a large difference between the HW counter and the last
    saved counter in SW.
    
    This change adjusts the work period for the HW clock overflow work by
    taking the minimum between the previous value and the quotient of max
    u64 value and the clock multiplier value.

    net/ipv6: Fix linklocal to global address with VRF
    
    [ Upstream commit 24b711edfc34bc45777a3f068812b7d1ed004a5d ]
    
    Example setup:

               where eth1 is enslaved to a VRF

               ssh   2001:db8:104::4
    
    (NOTE: UDP works fine if the PKTINFO has the address set to the global
    address and ifindex is set to the index of eth1 with a destination an
    LLA).
    
    For ICMP, icmp6_iif needs to be updated to check if skb->dev is an
    L3 master. If it is then return the ifindex from rt6i_idev similar
    to what is done for loopback.
    
    For TCP, restore the original tcp_v6_iif definition which is needed in
    most places and add a new tcp_v6_iif_l3_slave that considers the
    l3_slave variability. This latter check is only needed for socket
    lookups.

    multicast: do not restore deleted record source filter mode to new one
    
    There are two scenarios that we will restore deleted records. The first is
    when device down and up(or unmap/remap). In this scenario the new filter
    mode is same with previous one. Because we get it from in_dev->mc_list and
    we do not touch it during device down and up.
    
    The other scenario is when a new socket join a group which was just delete
    and not finish sending status reports. In this scenario, we should use the
    current filter mode instead of restore old one. Here are 4 cases in total.

    tcp: do not cancel delay-AcK on DCTCP special ACK
    
    [ Upstream commit 27cde44a259c380a3c09066fc4b42de7dde9b1ad ]
    
    Currently when a DCTCP receiver delays an ACK and receive a
    data packet with a different CE mark from the previous one's, it
    sends two immediate ACKs acking previous and latest sequences
    respectly (for ECN accounting).
    
    Previously sending the first ACK may mark off the delayed ACK timer
    (tcp_event_ack_sent). This may subsequently prevent sending the
    second ACK to acknowledge the latest sequence (tcp_ack_snd_check).
    The culprit is that tcp_send_ack() assumes it always acknowleges
    the latest sequence, which is not true for the first special ACK.
    
    The fix is to not make the assumption in tcp_send_ack and check the
    actual ack sequence before cancelling the delayed ACK. Further it's
    safer to pass the ack sequence number as a local variable into
    tcp_send_ack routine, instead of intercepting tp->rcv_nxt to avoid
    future bugs like this.

    tcp: fix dctcp delayed ACK schedule
    
    [ Upstream commit b0c05d0e99d98d7f0cd41efc1eeec94efdc3325d ]
    
    Previously, when a data segment was sent an ACK was piggybacked
    on the data segment without generating a CA_EVENT_NON_DELAYED_ACK
    event to notify congestion control modules. So the DCTCP
    ca->delayed_ack_reserved flag could incorrectly stay set when
    in fact there were no delayed ACKs being reserved. This could result
    in sending a special ECN notification ACK that carries an older
    ACK sequence, when in fact there was no need for such an ACK.
    DCTCP keeps track of the delayed ACK status with its own separate
    state ca->delayed_ack_reserved. Previously it may accidentally cancel
    the delayed ACK without updating this field upon sending a special
    ACK that carries a older ACK sequence. This inconsistency would
    lead to DCTCP receiver never acknowledging the latest data until the
    sender times out and retry in some cases.

    net: skb_segment() should not return NULL
    
    [ Upstream commit ff907a11a0d68a749ce1a321f4505c03bf72190c ]
    
    syzbot caught a NULL deref [1], caused by skb_segment()
    
    skb_segment() has many "goto err;" that assume the @err variable
    contains -ENOMEM.
    
    A successful call to __skb_linearize() should not clear @err,
    otherwise a subsequent memory allocation error could return NULL.
    
    While we are at it, we might use -EINVAL instead of -ENOMEM when
    MAX_SKB_FRAGS limit is reached.

    net-next/hinic: fix a problem in hinic_xmit_frame()
    
    [ Upstream commit f7482683f1f4925c60941dbbd0813ceaa069d106 ]
    
    The calculation of "wqe_size" is not correct when the tx queue is busy in
    hinic_xmit_frame().
    
    When there are no free WQEs, the tx flow will unmap the skb buffer, then
    ring the doobell for the pending packets. But the "wqe_size" which used
    to calculate the doorbell address is not correct. The wqe size should be
    cleared to 0, otherwise, it will cause a doorbell error.
    
    This patch fixes the problem.

    net/mlx4_core: Save the qpn from the input modifier in RST2INIT wrapper
    
    [ Upstream commit 958c696f5a7274d9447a458ad7aa70719b29a50a ]
    
    Function mlx4_RST2INIT_QP_wrapper saved the qp number passed in the qp
    context, rather than the one passed in the input modifier.
    
    However, the qp number in the qp context is not defined as a
    required parameter by the FW. Therefore, drivers may choose to not
    specify the qp number in the qp context for the reset-to-init transition.
    
    Thus, we must save the qp number passed in the command input modifier --
    which is always present. (This saved qp number is used as the input
    modifier for command 2RST_QP when a slave's qp's are destroyed).

    net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix races between lock and irq freeing
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d82475ad46c0b65f2618b5f2bbb4cadbb5ac5d8 ]
    
    free_irq() waits until all handlers for this IRQ have completed. As the
    relevant handler (mv88e6xxx_g1_irq_thread_fn()) takes the chip's reg_lock
    it might never return if the thread calling free_irq() holds this lock.
    
    For the same reason kthread_cancel_delayed_work_sync() in the polling case
    must not hold this lock.
    
    Also first free the irq (or stop the worker respectively) such that
    mv88e6xxx_g1_irq_thread_work() isn't called any more before the irq
    mappings are dropped in mv88e6xxx_g1_irq_free_common() to prevent the
    worker thread to call handle_nested_irq(0) which results in a NULL-pointer
    exception.

    For the following frags the hash is usually computed via
    skb_get_hash().
    The above can cause OoO for unconnected IPv6 UDPv6 socket: in that
    scenario the egress tx queue can be selected on a per packet basis
    via the skb hash.
    It may also fool flow-oriented schedulers to place fragments belonging
    to the same datagram in different flows.
    
    Fix the issue by copying the skb hash from the head frag into
    the others at fragmentation time.

    bonding: set default miimon value for non-arp modes if not set
    
    [ Upstream commit c1f897ce186a529a494441642125479d38727a3d ]
    
    For some time now, if you load the bonding driver and configure bond
    parameters via sysfs using minimal config options, such as specifying
    nothing but the mode, relying on defaults for everything else, modes
    that cannot use arp monitoring (802.3ad, balance-tlb, balance-alb) all
    wind up with both arp_interval=0 (as it should be) and miimon=0, which
    means the miimon monitor thread never actually runs. This is particularly
    problematic for 802.3ad.
    
    For example, from an LNST recipe I've set up:
    
    $ modprobe bonding max_bonds=0"
    $ echo "+t_bond0" > /sys/class/net/bonding_masters"
    $ ip link set t_bond0 down"
    $ echo "802.3ad" > /sys/class/net/t_bond0/bonding/mode"
    $ ip link set ens1f1 down"
    $ echo "+ens1f1" > /sys/class/net/t_bond0/bonding/slaves"
    $ ip link set ens1f0 down"
    $ echo "+ens1f0" > /sys/class/net/t_bond0/bonding/slaves"
    $ ethtool -i t_bond0"
    $ ip link set ens1f1 up"
    $ ip link set ens1f0 up"
    $ ip link set t_bond0 up"
    $ ip addr add 192.168.9.1/24 dev t_bond0"
    $ ip addr add 2002::1/64 dev t_bond0"
    
    This bond comes up okay, but things look slightly suspect in
    /proc/net/bonding/t_bond0 output:
    
    $ grep -i mii /proc/net/bonding/t_bond0
    MII Status: up
    MII Polling Interval (ms): 0
    MII Status: up
    MII Status: up
    
    Now, pull a cable on one of the ports in the bond, then reconnect it, and
    you'll see:
    
    Slave Interface: ens1f0
    MII Status: down
    Speed: 1000 Mbps
    Duplex: full
    
    I believe this became a major issue as of commit 4d2c0cda0744, which for
    802.3ad bonds, sets slave->link = BOND_LINK_DOWN, with a comment about
    relying on link monitoring via miimon to set it correctly, but since the
    miimon work queue never runs, the link just stays marked down.
    
    If we simply tweak bond_option_mode_set() slightly, we can check for the
    non-arp modes having no miimon value set, and insert BOND_DEFAULT_MIIMON,
    which gets things back in full working order. This problem exists as far
    back as 4.14, and might be worth fixing in all stable trees since, though
    the work-around is to simply specify an miimon value yourself.

    clk: meson-gxbb: set fclk_div2 as CLK_IS_CRITICAL
    
    commit c987ac6f1f088663b6dad39281071aeb31d450a8 upstream.
    
    On Amlogic Meson GXBB & GXL platforms, the SCPI Cortex-M4 Co-Processor
    seems to be dependent on the FCLK_DIV2 to be operationnal.
    
    The issue occurred since v4.17-rc1 by freezing the kernel boot when
    the 'schedutil' cpufreq governor was selected as default :
    
      [   12.071837] scpi_protocol scpi: SCP Protocol 0.0 Firmware 0.0.0 version
      domain-0 init dvfs: 4
      [   12.087757] hctosys: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)
      [   12.087907] cfg80211: Loading compiled-in X.509 certificates for regulatory database
      [   12.102241] cfg80211: Loaded X.509 cert 'sforshee: 00b28ddf47aef9cea7'
    
    But when disabling the MMC driver, the boot finished but cpufreq failed to
    change the CPU frequency :
    
      [   12.153045] cpufreq: __target_index: Failed to change cpu frequency: -5
    
    A bisect between v4.16 and v4.16-rc1 gave
    05f814402d61 ("clk: meson: add fdiv clock gates") to be the first bad commit.
    This commit added support for the missing clock gates before the fixed PLL
    fixed dividers (FCLK_DIVx) and the clock framework basically disabled
    all the unused fixed dividers, thus disabled a critical clock path for
    the SCPI Co-Processor.
    
    This patch simply sets the FCLK_DIV2 gate as critical to ensure
    nobody can disable it.

    drm/nouveau: Set DRIVER_ATOMIC cap earlier to fix debugfs
    
    commit eb493fbc150f4a28151ae1ee84f24395989f3600 upstream.
    
    Currently nouveau doesn't actually expose the state debugfs file that's
    usually provided for any modesetting driver that supports atomic, even
    if nouveau is loaded with atomic=1. This is due to the fact that the
    standard debugfs files that DRM creates for atomic drivers is called
    when drm_get_pci_dev() is called from nouveau_drm.c. This happens well
    before we've initialized the display core, which is currently
    responsible for setting the DRIVER_ATOMIC cap.
    
    So, move the atomic option into nouveau_drm.c and just add the
    DRIVER_ATOMIC cap whenever it's enabled on the kernel commandline. This
    shouldn't cause any actual issues, as the atomic ioctl will still fail
    as expected even if the display core doesn't disable it until later in
    the init sequence. This also provides the added benefit of being able to
    use the state debugfs file to check the current display state even if
    clients aren't allowed to modify it through anything other than the
    legacy ioctls.
    
    Additionally, disable the DRIVER_ATOMIC cap in nv04's display core, as
    this was already disabled there previously.

    KVM: PPC: Check if IOMMU page is contained in the pinned physical page
    
    commit 76fa4975f3ed12d15762bc979ca44078598ed8ee upstream.
    
    A VM which has:
     - a DMA capable device passed through to it (eg. network card);
     - running a malicious kernel that ignores H_PUT_TCE failure;
     - capability of using IOMMU pages bigger that physical pages
    can create an IOMMU mapping that exposes (for example) 16MB of
    the host physical memory to the device when only 64K was allocated to the VM.
    
    The remaining 16MB - 64K will be some other content of host memory, possibly
    including pages of the VM, but also pages of host kernel memory, host
    programs or other VMs.
    
    The attacking VM does not control the location of the page it can map,
    and is only allowed to map as many pages as it has pages of RAM.
    
    We already have a check in drivers/vfio/vfio_iommu_spapr_tce.c that
    an IOMMU page is contained in the physical page so the PCI hardware won't
    get access to unassigned host memory; however this check is missing in
    the KVM fastpath (H_PUT_TCE accelerated code). We were lucky so far and
    did not hit this yet as the very first time when the mapping happens
    we do not have tbl::it_userspace allocated yet and fall back to
    the userspace which in turn calls VFIO IOMMU driver, this fails and
    the guest does not retry,
    
    This stores the smallest preregistered page size in the preregistered
    region descriptor and changes the mm_iommu_xxx API to check this against
    the IOMMU page size.
    
    This calculates maximum page size as a minimum of the natural region
    alignment and compound page size. For the page shift this uses the shift
    returned by find_linux_pte() which indicates how the page is mapped to
    the current userspace - if the page is huge and this is not a zero, then
    it is a leaf pte and the page is mapped within the range.

    commit 565b9937f44d5ab7956339b6c105c03471ce3243 upstream.
    
    The HPLL can be configured through a register (SCU24), however some
    platforms chose to configure it through the strapping settings and do
    not use the register. This was not noticed as the logic for bit 18 in
    SCU24 was confused: set means programmed, but the driver read it as set
    means strapped.
    
    This gives us the correct HPLL value on Palmetto systems, from which
    most of the peripheral clocks are generated.

    clk: mvebu: armada-37xx-periph: Fix switching CPU rate from 300Mhz to 1.2GHz
    
    commit 61c40f35f5cd6f67ccbd7319a1722eb78c815989 upstream.
    
    Switching the CPU from the L2 or L3 frequencies (300 and 200 Mhz
    respectively) to L0 frequency (1.2 Ghz) requires a significant amount
    of time to let VDD stabilize to the appropriate voltage. This amount of
    time is large enough that it cannot be covered by the hardware
    countdown register. Due to this, the CPU might start operating at L0
    before the voltage is stabilized, leading to CPU stalls.
    
    To work around this problem, we prevent switching directly from the
    L2/L3 frequencies to the L0 frequency, and instead switch to the L1
    frequency in-between. The sequence therefore becomes:
    
    1. First switch from L2/L3(200/300MHz) to L1(600MHZ)
    2. Sleep 20ms for stabling VDD voltage
    3. Then switch from L1(600MHZ) to L0(1200Mhz).
    
    It is based on the work done by Ken Ma <make@marvell.com>

    MIPS: Fix off-by-one in pci_resource_to_user()
    
    commit 38c0a74fe06da3be133cae3fb7bde6a9438e698b upstream.
    
    The MIPS implementation of pci_resource_to_user() introduced in v3.12 by
    commit 4c2924b725fb ("MIPS: PCI: Use pci_resource_to_user to map pci
    memory space properly") incorrectly sets *end to the address of the
    byte after the resource, rather than the last byte of the resource.
    
    This results in userland seeing resources as a byte larger than they
    actually are, for example a 32 byte BAR will be reported by a tool such
    as lspci as being 33 bytes in size:
    
        Region 2: I/O ports at 1000 [disabled] [size=33]
    
    Correct this by subtracting one from the calculated end address,
    reporting the correct address to userland.
