    block: Free queue resources at blk_release_queue()
    
    commit 777eb1bf15b8532c396821774bf6451e563438f5 upstream.
    
    A kernel crash is observed when a mounted ext3/ext4 filesystem is
    physically removed. The problem is that blk_cleanup_queue() frees up
    some resources eg by calling elevator_exit(), which are not checked for
    in normal operation. So we should rather move these calls to the
    destructor function blk_release_queue() as at that point all remaining
    references are gone. However, in doing so we have to ensure that any
    externally supplied queue_lock is disconnected as the driver might free
    up the lock after the call of blk_cleanup_queue(),

    iwlagn: fix dangling scan request
    
    commit 6c80c39d9a6986a566c30d797aae37bfb697eea3 upstream.
    
    If iwl_scan_initiate() fails for any reason,
    priv->scan_request and priv->scan_vif are left
    dangling. This can lead to a crash later when
    iwl_bg_scan_completed() tries to run a pending
    scan request.
    
    In practice, this seems to be very rare due to
    the STATUS_SCANNING check earlier. That check,
    however, is wrong -- it should allow a scan to
    be queued when a reset/roc scan is going on.
    When a normal scan is already going on, a new
    one can't be issued by mac80211, so that code
    can be removed completely. I introduced this
    bug when adding off-channel support in commit
    266af4c745952e9bebf687dd68af58df553cb59d.

    iwlegacy: do not use interruptible waits
    
    commit 65d0f19e583e80e42b1c67c166bfc4dfdf6ab693 upstream.
    
    iwlegacy version of fix:
    
    commit effd4d9aece9184f526e6556786a94d335e38b71

        iwlagn: do not use interruptible waits
    
        Since the dawn of its time, iwlwifi has used
        interruptible waits to wait for synchronous
        commands and firmware loading.
    
        This leads to "interesting" bugs, because it
        can't actually handle the interruptions; for
        example when a command sending is interrupted
        it will assume the command completed fully,
        and then leave it pending, which leads to all
        kinds of trouble when the command finishes
        later.
    
        Since there's no easy way to gracefully deal
        with interruptions, fix the driver to not use
        interruptible waits.
    
        This at least fixes the error
        iwlagn 0000:02:00.0: Error: Response NULL in  'REPLY_SCAN_ABORT_CMD'
    
        I have seen in P2P testing, but it is likely
        that there are other errors caused by this.

        iwlagn: fix command queue timeout
    
        If the command queue is constantly busy,
        which can happen in P2P, the hangcheck
        timer will frequently find a command in
        it and will eventually reset the device
        because nothing sets the timestamp for
        this queue when commands are processed.
    
        Fix this by setting the timestamp when
        a command completes.
    
    iwlegacy does not support P2P, but this patch fix possible
    unneeded hardware resets, hence is needed.

    cfg80211: Fix validation of AKM suites
    
    commit 1b9ca0272ffae212e726380f66777b30a56ed7a5 upstream.
    
    Incorrect variable was used in validating the akm_suites array from
    NL80211_ATTR_AKM_SUITES. In addition, there was no explicit
    validation of the array length (we only have room for
    NL80211_MAX_NR_AKM_SUITES).
    
    This can result in a buffer write overflow for stack variables with
    arbitrary data from user space. The nl80211 commands using the affected
    functionality require GENL_ADMIN_PERM, so this is only exposed to admin
    users.

    libsas: fix failure to revalidate domain for anything but the first expander child.
    
    commit 24926dadc41cc566e974022b0e66231b82c6375f upstream.
    
    In an enclosure model where there are chaining expanders to a large body
    of storage, it was discovered that libsas, responding to a broadcast
    event change, would only revalidate the domain of first child expander
    in the list.
    
    The issue is that the pointer value to the discovered source device was
    used to break out of the loop, rather than the content of the pointer.
    
    This still remains non-compliant as the revalidate domain code is
    supposed to loop through all child expanders, and not stop at the first
    one it finds that reports a change count. However, the design of this
    routine does not allow multiple device discoveries and that would be a
    more complicated set of patches reserved for another day. We are fixing
    the glaring bug rather than refactoring the code.

    3w-9xxx: fix iommu_iova leak
    
    commit 96067723e46b0dd24ae7b934085ab4eff4d26a1b upstream.
    
    Following reports on the list, it looks like the 3e-9xxx driver will leak dma
    mappings every time we get a transient queueing error back from the card.
    This is because it maps the sg list in the routine that sends the command, but
    doesn't unmap again in the transient failure path (even though the command is
    sent back to the block layer).  Fix by unmapping before returning the status.

    memcg: fix vmscan count in small memcgs
    
    commit 4508378b9523e22a2a0175d8bf64d932fb10a67d upstream.
    
    Commit 246e87a93934 ("memcg: fix get_scan_count() for small targets")
    fixes the memcg/kswapd behavior against small targets and prevent vmscan
    priority too high.
    
    But the implementation is too naive and adds another problem to small
    memcg.  It always force scan to 32 pages of file/anon and doesn't handle
    swappiness and other rotate_info.  It makes vmscan to scan anon LRU
    regardless of swappiness and make reclaim bad.  This patch fixes it by
    adjusting scanning count with regard to swappiness at el.

    the numbers of scanning anon are decreased(as expected), and elapsed time

    (*) Because the amount of file-cache is much bigger than anon,
        recalaim_stat's rotate-scan counter make scanning files more.

    ASoC: ssm2602: Re-enable oscillator after suspend
    
    commit 9058020cd9ae3423d6fe7de591698dc96b6701aa upstream.
    
    Currently the the internal oscillator is powered down when entering BIAS_OFF
    state, but not re-enabled when going back to BIAS_STANDBY. As a result the
    CODEC will stop working after suspend if the internal oscillator is used to
    generate the sysclock signal. This patch fixes it by clearing the appropriate
    bit in the power down register when the CODEC is re-enabled.

    ASoC: omap-mcbsp: Do not attempt to change DAI sysclk if stream is active
    
    commit 34c869855a28af3c6031d29e2267b5a3cce0d67d upstream.
    
    Attempt to change McBSP CLKS source while another stream is active is not
    safe after commit d135865 ("OMAP: McBSP: implement functional clock
    switching via clock framework") in 2.6.37.
    
    CLKS parent clock switching using clock framework have to idle the McBSP
    before switching and then activate it again. This short break can cause a
    DMA transaction error to already running stream which halts and recovers
    only by closing and restarting the stream.
    
    This goes more fatal after commit e2fa61d ("OMAP3: l3: Introduce
    l3-interconnect error handling driver") in 2.6.39 where l3 driver detects a
    severe timeout error and does BUG_ON().
    
    Fix this by not changing any configuration in omap_mcbsp_dai_set_dai_sysclk
    if the McBSP is already active. This test should have been here just from
    the beginning anyway.

    firmware loader: allow builtin firmware load even if usermodehelper is disabled
    
    commit caca9510ff4e5d842c0589110243d60927836222 upstream.
    
    In commit a144c6a6c924 ("PM: Print a warning if firmware is requested
    when tasks are frozen") we not only printed a warning if somebody tried
    to load the firmware when tasks are frozen - we also failed the load.
    
    But that check was done before the check for built-in firmware, and then
    when we disallowed usermode helpers during bootup (commit 288d5abec831:
    "Boot up with usermodehelper disabled"), that actually means that
    built-in modules can no longer load their firmware even if the firmware
    is built in too.  Which used to work, and some people depended on it for
    the R100 driver.
    
    So move the test for usermodehelper_is_disabled() down, to after
    checking the built-in firmware.
    
    This should fix:

    ARM: 7099/1: futex: preserve oldval in SMP __futex_atomic_op
    
    commit df77abcafc8dc881b6c9347548651777088e4b27 upstream.
    
    The SMP implementation of __futex_atomic_op clobbers oldval with the
    status flag from the exclusive store. This causes it to always read as
    zero when performing the FUTEX_OP_CMP_* operation.
    
    This patch updates the ARM __futex_atomic_op implementations to take a
    tmp argument, allowing us to store the strex status flag without
    overwriting the register containing oldval.

    commit f630c1bdfbf8fe423325beaf60027cfc7fd7c610 upstream.
    
    This patch implements a workaround for erratum 764369 affecting
    Cortex-A9 MPCore with two or more processors (all current revisions).
    Under certain timing circumstances, a data cache line maintenance
    operation by MVA targeting an Inner Shareable memory region may fail to
    proceed up to either the Point of Coherency or to the Point of
    Unification of the system. This workaround adds a DSB instruction before
    the relevant cache maintenance functions and sets a specific bit in the
    diagnostic control register of the SCU.

    bnx2fc: Fix kernel panic when deleting NPIV ports
    
    commit d36b3279e157641c345b12eddb3db78fb42da80f upstream.
    
    Deleting NPIV port causes a kernel panic when the NPIV port is in the same zone
    as the physical port and shares the same LUN. This happens due to the fact that
    vport destroy and unsolicited ELS are scheduled to run on the same workqueue,
    and vport destroy destroys the lport and the unsolicited ELS tries to access
    the invalid lport.  This patch fixes this issue by maintaining a list of valid
    lports and verifying if the lport is valid or not before accessing it.

    commit db1d350fcb156b58f66a67680617077bcacfe6fc upstream.
    
    During NETDEV_UP, we use symbol_get() to get the net driver's cnic
    probe function.  This sometimes doesn't work if NETDEV_UP happens
    right after NETDEV_REGISTER and the net driver is still running module
    init code.  As a result, the cnic device may not be discovered.  We

    btrfs: fix d_off in the first dirent
    
    commit 3765fefaee2da83f10829fa64a74e6b7360350cb upstream.
    
    Since the d_off in the first dirent for "." (that originates from
    the 4th argument "offset" of filldir() for the 2nd dirent for "..")
    is wrongly assigned in btrfs_real_readdir(), telldir returns same
    offset for different locations.
    
     | # mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb1
     | # mount /dev/sdb1 fs0
     | # cd fs0
     | # touch file0 file1
     | # ../test
     | telldir: 0
     | readdir: d_off = 2, d_name = "."
     | telldir: 2
     | readdir: d_off = 2, d_name = ".."
     | telldir: 2
     | readdir: d_off = 3, d_name = "file0"
     | telldir: 3
     | readdir: d_off = 2147483647, d_name = "file1"
     | telldir: 2147483647
    
    To fix this problem, pass filp->f_pos (which is loff_t) instead.
    
     | # ../test
     | telldir: 0
     | readdir: d_off = 1, d_name = "."
     | telldir: 1
     | readdir: d_off = 2, d_name = ".."
     | telldir: 2
     | readdir: d_off = 3, d_name = "file0"
     :
    
    At the moment the "offset" for "." is unused because there is no
    preceding dirent, however it is better to pass filp->f_pos to follow
    grammatical usage.

    drm/radeon/kms: fix DDIA enable on some rs690 systems
    
    commit fdfc61594e6de21c23f955818ef78bcab9bafe40 upstream.
    
    DVOOutputControl checks the value of of bios scratch reg 3
    on some tables and assumes the encoder is already enabled
    if the DFP2_ACTIVE bit is set.  Clear that bit so the table
    sets the DDIA enable bit properly.

    ALSA: usb-audio - clear chip->probing on error exit
    
    commit 362e4e49abe53e89d87455dfcd7c1bbaf08a839d upstream.
    
    The Terratec Aureon 5.1 USB sound card support is broken since kernel
    2.6.39.
    2.6.39 introduced power management support for USB sound cards that added
    a probing flag in struct snd_usb_audio.
    
    During the probe of the card it gives following error message :
    
    usb 7-2: new full speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd
    cannot find UAC_HEADER
    snd-usb-audio: probe of 7-2:1.3 failed with error -5
    input: USB Audio as
    /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1/usb7/7-2/7-2:1.3/input/input6
    generic-usb 0003:0CCD:0028.0001: input: USB HID v1.00 Device [USB Audio]
    on usb-0000:00:1d.1-2/input3
    
    I can not comment about that "cannot find UAC_HEADER" error, but until
    2.6.38 the card worked anyway.
    With 2.6.39 chip->probing remains 1 on error exit, and any later ioctl
    stops in snd_usb_autoresume with -ENODEV.

    perf symbols: Fix ppc64 SEGV in dso__load_sym with debuginfo files
    
    commit adb091846318f86e4f46c7d6a7b40d2f478abdbe upstream.
    
    64bit PowerPC debuginfo files have an empty function descriptor section.
    I hit a SEGV when perf tried to use this section for symbol resolution.
    
    To fix this we need to check the section is valid and we can do this by
    checking for type SHT_PROGBITS.

    usb/host/pci-quirks.c: correct annotation of `ehci_dmi_nohandoff_table'
    
    commit a7e6401e19aa54924ab11ee548afaad0a55ffdc6 upstream.
    
    ehci_bios_handoff() is marked __devinit, `ehci_dmi_nohandoff_table' should be
    marked __devinitconst, not __initconst. This fixes the following section
    mismatch:
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.devinit.text+0x4f08): Section mismatch in reference from the function ehci_bios_handoff() to the variable .init.rodata:ehci_dmi_nohandoff_table
    The function __devinit ehci_bios_handoff() references a variable __initconst ehci_dmi_nohandoff_table.
    If ehci_dmi_nohandoff_table is only used by ehci_bios_handoff then annotate ehci_dmi_nohandoff_table with a matching annotation.

    - Fix a bug in lpfc_prep_seq() where the size out of the first CQE was
      ONLY being used, even though multiple dmabufs make up the sequence,
      each have their own CQE with potentially different sizes.
    - Fix bug in lpfc_bsg_ct_unsol_event() where the ulpContext and ulpWord[3]
      fields of the XMIT_SEQUENCE64_CX IOCB were being calculated incorrectly.
    - Do physical to logical translation before indexing into the active
      XRI array.
    - Populate physical vpi in the iocb data structure.
    - Put the current accumulated total in each IOCB in the chain as we are
      walking thru then. The last IOCB in the chain should have the total
      length of the sequence.

    commit 6b07d30aca7e52f2881b8c8c20c8a2cd28e8b3d3 upstream.

    userspace buffer instead of TPM_BUFSIZE.
    
    This got assigned CVE-2011-1161.
    
    [The first hunk didn't make sense given one could expect
     way less data than TPM_BUFSIZE, so added tpm_transmit boundary
     check over bufsiz instead
     The last parameter of tpm_transmit() reflects the amount
     of data expected from the device, and not the buffer size
     being supplied to it. It isn't ideal to parse it directly,
     so we just set it to the maximum the input buffer can handle
     and let the userspace API to do such job.]

    zorro: Defer device_register() until all devices have been identified
    
    commit a7f4d00a82feb5b311f765bf9522bc55bee0684f upstream.
    
    As the Amiga Zorro II address space is limited to 8.5 MiB and Zorro
    devices can contain only one BAR, several Amiga Zorro II expansion
    boards (mainly graphics cards) contain multiple Zorro devices: a small
    one for the control registers and one (or more) for the graphics memory.
    
    The conversion of cirrusfb to the new driver framework introduced a
    regression: the driver contains a zorro_driver for the first Zorro
    device, and uses the (old) zorro_find_device() call to find the second
    Zorro device.
    
    However, as the Zorro core calls device_register() as soon as a Zorro
    device is identified, it may not have identified the second Zorro device
    belonging to the same physical Zorro expansion card.  Hence cirrusfb
    could no longer find the second part of the Picasso II graphics card,
    causing a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Defer the registration of Zorro devices with the driver framework until
    all Zorro devices have been identified to fix this.
    
    Note that the alternative solution (modifying cirrusfb to register a
    zorro_driver for all Zorro devices belonging to a graphics card, instead
    of only for the first one, and adding a synchronization mechanism to
    defer initialization until all have been found), is not an option, as on
    some cards one device may be optional (e.g.  the second bank of 2 MiB of
    graphics memory on the Picasso IV in Zorro II mode).

    bridge: Pseudo-header required for the checksum of ICMPv6
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b275d7efa1c4412f0d572fcd7f78ed0919370b3 ]
    
    Checksum of ICMPv6 is not properly computed because the pseudo header is not used.
    Thus, the MLD packet gets dropped by the bridge.

    xfrm: Perform a replay check after return from async codepaths
    
    [ Upstream commit bcf66bf54aabffc150acd1c99e0f4bc51935eada ]
    
    When asyncronous crypto algorithms are used, there might be many
    packets that passed the xfrm replay check, but the replay advance
    function is not called yet for these packets. So the replay check
    function would accept a replay of all of these packets. Also the
    system might crash if there are more packets in async processing
    than the size of the anti replay window, because the replay advance
    function would try to update the replay window beyond the bounds.
    
    This pach adds a second replay check after resuming from the async
    processing to fix these issues.

    vlan: reset headers on accel emulation path
    
    [ Upstream commit c5114cd59d2664f258b0d021d79b1532d94bdc2b ]
    
    It's after all necessary to do reset headers here. The reason is we
    cannot depend that it gets reseted in __netif_receive_skb once skb is
    reinjected. For incoming vlanids without vlan_dev, vlan_do_receive()
    returns false with skb != NULL and __netif_reveive_skb continues, skb is
    not reinjected.
    
    This might be good material for 3.0-stable as well

    [ Upstream commit f0e3d0689da401f7d1981c2777a714ba295ea5ff ]
    
    Using a gcc 4.4.3, warnings are emitted for a possibly uninitialized use
    of ecn_ok.
    
    This can happen if cookie_check_timestamp() returns due to not having
    seen a timestamp.  Defaulting to ecn off seems like a reasonable thing
    to do in this case, so initialized ecn_ok to false.

    (sch_sfq: fix peek() implementation) changed sfq to use generic
    peek helper.
    
    This makes HFSC complain about a non-work-conserving child qdisc, if
    prio with sfq child is used within hfsc:
    
    hfsc peeks into prio qdisc, which will then peek into sfq.
    returned skb is stashed in sch->gso_skb.
    
    Next, hfsc tries to dequeue from prio, but prio will call sfq dequeue
    directly, which may return NULL instead of previously peeked-at skb.
    
    Have prio call qdisc_dequeue_peeked, so sfq->dequeue() is
    not called in this case.

    netfilter: TCP and raw fix for ip_route_me_harder
    
    [ Upstream commit 797fd3913abf2f7036003ab8d3d019cbea41affd ]
    
    TCP in some cases uses different global (raw) socket
    to send RST and ACK. The transparent flag is not set there.
    Currently, it is a problem for rerouting after the previous
    change.
    
            Fix it by simplifying the checks in ip_route_me_harder
    and use FLOWI_FLAG_ANYSRC even for sockets. It looks safe
    because the initial routing allowed this source address to
    be used and now we just have to make sure the packet is rerouted.
    
            As a side effect this also allows rerouting for normal
    raw sockets that use spoofed source addresses which was not possible
    even before we eliminated the ip_route_input call.

    ipv4: some rt_iif -> rt_route_iif conversions
    
    [ Upstream commit 97a804102021431fa6fa33c21c85df762b0f5cb9 ]
    
    As rt_iif represents input device even for packets
    coming from loopback with output route, it is not an unique
    key specific to input routes. Now rt_route_iif has such role,
    it was fl.iif in 2.6.38, so better to change the checks at
    some places to save CPU cycles and to restore 2.6.38 semantics.
    
    compare_keys:
            - input routes: only rt_route_iif matters, rt_iif is same
            - output routes: only rt_oif matters, rt_iif is not
                    used for matching in __ip_route_output_key
            - now we are back to 2.6.38 state
    
    ip_route_input_common:
            - matching rt_route_iif implies input route
            - compared to 2.6.38 we eliminated one rth->fl.oif check
            because it was not needed even for 2.6.38
    
    compare_hash_inputs:
            Only the change here is not an optimization, it has
            effect only for output routes. I assume I'm restoring
            the original intention to ignore oif, it was using fl.iif
            - now we are back to 2.6.38 state

    arp: fix rcu lockdep splat in arp_process()
    
    [ Upstream commit 20e6074eb8e096b3a595c093d1cb222f378cd671 ]
    
    Dave Jones reported a lockdep splat triggered by an arp_process() call
    from parp_redo().
    
    Commit faa9dcf793be (arp: RCU changes) is the origin of the bug, since
    it assumed arp_process() was called under rcu_read_lock(), which is not
    true in this particular path.
    
    Instead of adding rcu_read_lock() in parp_redo(), I chose to add it in
    neigh_proxy_process() to take care of IPv6 side too.

    fcoe: Unable to select the exchangeID from offload pool for storage targets
    
    commit 1ff9918b625457ce20d450d00f9ed0a12ba191b7 upstream.
    
    Problem: When initiator sends write command to target, target tries to
    assign new sequence. It allocates new exchangeID (RX_ID)
    always from non-offloaded pool (Non-offload EMA)
    
    Fix: Enhanced fcoe_oem_match routine to look at F_CTL flags and if it
    is exchange responder and command type is WRITEDATA, then function
    returns TRUE instead of FALSE. This function is used to determine
    which pool to use (offload pool of exchange is used only if this
    function returns TRUE).

    libfc: Enhancement to RPORT state machine applicable only for VN2VN mode
    
    commit 480584818a4bb3655d8d0d875ed60b427fc61cc5 upstream.
    
    Problem: Existing RPORT state machine continues witg FLOGI/PLOGI
    process only after it receices beacon from other end. Once claiming
    stage is over (either clain notify or clain repose), beacon is sent
    and state machine enters into operational mode where it initiates the
    rlogin process (FLOGI/PLOGI) to the peer but before this rlogin is
    initiated, exitsing implementation checks if it received beacon from
    other end, it beacon is not received yet, rlogin process is not
    initiated. Other end initiates FLOGI but peer end keeps on rejecting
    FLOGI, hence after 3 retries other end deletes associated rport, then
    sends a beacon. Once the beacon is received, peer end now initiates
    rlogin to the peer end but since associated rport is deleted FLOGI is
    neither accepted nor the reject response send out because rport is
    deleted. Hence unable to proceed withg FLOGI/PLOGI process and fails
    to establish VN2VN connection.
    
    Fix: VN2VN spec is not standard yet but based on exitsing collateral
    on T11, it appears that, both end shall send beacon and enter into
    'operational mode' without explictly waiting for beacon from other
    end. Fix is to allow the RPORT login process as long as respective
    RPORT is created (as part of claim notification / claim response) even
    though state of RPORT is INIT. Means don't wait for beacon from peer
    end, if peer end initiates FLOGI (means peer end exist and
    responding).
    
    Notes: This patch is preparing the FCoE stack for target wrt
    offload. This is generic patch and harmless even if applied on storage
    initiator because 'else if' condition of function 'fcoe_oem_found'
    shall evaluate to TRUE only for targets.

    qdio: clear shared DSCI before scheduling the queue handler
    
    commit b02f0c2ea25781e0f94b4fc8f6f85582057857b3 upstream.
    
    The following race can occur with qdio devices that use the shared device
    state change indicator:
    
    Device (Shared DSCI)    CPU0                            CPU1
    ===============================================================================
    
    1. DSCI 0 => 1,
       INT pending

                            * Inbound tasklet_schedule
                            * DSCI 1 => 0
    
    3. DSCI 0 => 1,
       INT pending
    
                                                            4. Thinint handler
                                                            * si_used = 1
                                                            * Inbound tasklet_schedu

                                                               => NOP
    
                            5. Inbound tasklet run
    
    6. DSCI = 1,
       INT surpressed
    
                                                            7. DSCI 1 => 0
    
    The race would lead to a stall where new data in the input queue is
    not recognized so the device stops working in case of no further traffic.
    
    Fix the race by resetting the DSCI before scheduling the inbound tasklet
    so the device generates an interrupt if new data arrives in the above
    scenario in step 6.

    writeback: update dirtied_when for synced inode to prevent livelock
    
    commit 94c3dcbb0b0cdfd82cedd21705424d8044edc42c upstream.
    
    Explicitly update .dirtied_when on synced inodes, so that they are no
    longer considered for writeback in the next round.
    
    It can prevent both of the following livelock schemes:
    
    - while true; do echo data >> f; done
    - while true; do touch f;        done (in theory)
    
    The exact livelock condition is, during sync(1):
    
    (1) no new inodes are dirtied
    (2) an inode being actively dirtied
    
    On (2), the inode will be tagged and synced with .nr_to_write=LONG_MAX.
    When finished, it will be redirty_tail()ed because it's still dirty
    and (.nr_to_write > 0). redirty_tail() won't update its ->dirtied_when
    on condition (1). The sync work will then revisit it on the next
    queue_io() and find it eligible again because its old ->dirtied_when
    predates the sync work start time.
    
    We'll do more aggressive "keep writeback as long as we wrote something"
    logic in wb_writeback(). The "use LONG_MAX .nr_to_write" trick in commit
    b9543dac5bbc ("writeback: avoid livelocking WB_SYNC_ALL writeback") will
    no longer be enough to stop sync livelock.

    writeback: introduce .tagged_writepages for the WB_SYNC_NONE sync stage
    
    commit 6e6938b6d3130305a5960c86b1a9b21e58cf6144 upstream.
    
    sync(2) is performed in two stages: the WB_SYNC_NONE sync and the
    WB_SYNC_ALL sync. Identify the first stage with .tagged_writepages and
    do livelock prevention for it, too.
    
    Jan's commit f446daaea9 ("mm: implement writeback livelock avoidance
    using page tagging") is a partial fix in that it only fixed the
    WB_SYNC_ALL phase livelock.
    
    Although ext4 is tested to no longer livelock with commit f446daaea9,
    it may due to some "redirty_tail() after pages_skipped" effect which
    is by no means a guarantee for _all_ the file systems.
    
    Note that writeback_inodes_sb() is called by not only sync(), they are
    treated the same because the other callers also need livelock prevention.
    
    Impact:  It changes the order in which pages/inodes are synced to disk.
    Now in the WB_SYNC_NONE stage, it won't proceed to write the next inode
    until finished with the current inode.

    ipc/mqueue.c: fix mq_open() return value
    
    commit d40dcdb0172a1ba853464983a059fb45e0aaf61a upstream.
    
    We return ENOMEM from mqueue_get_inode even when we have enough memory.
    Namely in case the system rlimit of mqueue was reached.  This error
    propagates to mq_queue and user sees the error unexpectedly.  So fix
    this up to properly return EMFILE as described in the manpage:
    
            EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of files and
                   message queues open.
    
    instead of:
    
            ENOMEM Insufficient memory.
    
    With the previous patch we just switch to ERR_PTR/PTR_ERR/IS_ERR error
    handling here.

    If new_inode fails to allocate an inode we need only to return with

    unnecessary line breaks).

    iscsi_tcp: fix locking around iscsi sk user data
    
    commit 03adb5f91280b433c3685d0ee86b2e1424af3d88 upstream.
    
    iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_restore_callbacks could have set
    the sk_user_data field to NULL then iscsi_sw_tcp_data_ready
    could read that and try to access the NULL pointer. This
    adds some checks for NULL sk_user_data in the sk

    blk-cgroup: be able to remove the record of unplugged device
    
    commit d11bb4462c4cc6ddd45c6927c617ad79fa6fb8fc upstream.
    
    The bug is we're not able to remove the device from blkio cgroup's
    per-device control files if it gets unplugged.
    
    To reproduce the bug:
    
      # mount -t cgroup -o blkio xxx /cgroup
      # cd /cgroup
      # echo "8:0 1000" > blkio.throttle.read_bps_device
      # unplug the device
      # cat blkio.throttle.read_bps_device
      8:0   1000
      # echo "8:0 0" > blkio.throttle.read_bps_device
      -bash: echo: write error: No such device
    
    After patching, the device removal will succeed.

    wireless: Reset beacon_found while updating regulatory
    
    commit aa3d7eef398dd4f29045e9889b817d5161afe03e upstream.
    
    During the association, the regulatory is updated by country IE
    that reaps the previously found beacons. The impact is that
    after a STA disconnects *or* when for any reason a regulatory
    domain change happens the beacon hint flag is not cleared
    therefore preventing future beacon hints to be learned.
    This is important as a regulatory domain change or a restore
    of regulatory settings would set back the passive scan and no-ibss
    flags on the channel. This is the right place to do this given that
    it covers any regulatory domain change.

    xen/e820: if there is no dom0_mem=, don't tweak extra_pages.
    
    commit e3b73c4a25e9a5705b4ef28b91676caf01f9bc9f upstream.
    
    The patch "xen: use maximum reservation to limit amount of usable RAM"
    (d312ae878b6aed3912e1acaaf5d0b2a9d08a4f11) breaks machines that
    do not use 'dom0_mem=' argument with:
    
    reserve RAM buffer: 000000133f2e2000 - 000000133fffffff
    (XEN) mm.c:4976:d0 Global bit is set to kernel page fffff8117e
    (XEN) domain_crash_sync called from entry.S
    (XEN) Domain 0 (vcpu#0) crashed on cpu#0:
    ...
    
    The reason being that the last E820 entry is created using the
    'extra_pages' (which is based on how many pages have been freed).
    The mentioned git commit sets the initial value of 'extra_pages'
    using a hypercall which returns the number of pages (if dom0_mem
    has been used) or -1 otherwise. If the later we return with
    MAX_DOMAIN_PAGES as basis for calculation:
    
        return min(max_pages, MAX_DOMAIN_PAGES);
    
    and use it:
    
         extra_limit = xen_get_max_pages();
         if (extra_limit >= max_pfn)
                 extra_pages = extra_limit - max_pfn;
         else
                 extra_pages = 0;
    
    which means we end up with extra_pages = 128GB in PFNs (33554432)
    - 8GB in PFNs (2097152, on this specific box, can be larger or smaller),
    and then we add that value to the E820 making it:
    
      Xen: 00000000ff000000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
      Xen: 0000000100000000 - 000000133f2e2000 (usable)
    
    which is clearly wrong. It should look as so:
    
      Xen: 00000000ff000000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
      Xen: 0000000100000000 - 000000027fbda000 (usable)
    
    Naturally this problem does not present itself if dom0_mem=max:X
    is used.

    xen: use maximum reservation to limit amount of usable RAM
    
    commit d312ae878b6aed3912e1acaaf5d0b2a9d08a4f11 upstream.
    
    Use the domain's maximum reservation to limit the amount of extra RAM
    for the memory balloon. This reduces the size of the pages tables and
    the amount of reserved low memory (which defaults to about 1/32 of the
    total RAM).
    
    On a system with 8 GiB of RAM with the domain limited to 1 GiB the
    kernel reports:
    
    Before:
    
    Memory: 627792k/4472000k available
    
    After:
    
    Memory: 549740k/11132224k available
    
    A increase of about 76 MiB (~1.5% of the unused 7 GiB).  The reserved
    low memory is also reduced from 253 MiB to 32 MiB.  The total
    additional usable RAM is 329 MiB.
    
    For dom0, this requires at patch to Xen ('x86: use 'dom0_mem' to limit
    the number of pages for dom0') (c/s 23790)

    This is modeled after the smaps code.
    
    It detects transparent hugepages and then does a single gather_stats()
    for the page as a whole.  This has two benifits:
     1. It is more efficient since it does many pages in a single shot.
     2. It does not have to break down the huge page.

    gather_pte_stats() does a number of checks on a target page
    to see whether it should even be considered for statistics.

    make /proc/$pid/numa_maps gather_stats() take variable page size
    
    commit eb4866d0066ffd5446751c102d64feb3318d8bd1 upstream.
    
    We need to teach the numa_maps code about transparent huge pages.  The
    first step is to teach gather_stats() that the pte it is dealing with
    might represent more than one page.
    
    Note that will we use this in a moment for transparent huge pages since
    they have use a single pmd_t which _acts_ as a "surrogate" for a bunch
    of smaller pte_t's.
    
    I'm a _bit_ unhappy that this interface counts in hugetlbfs page sizes
    for hugetlbfs pages and PAGE_SIZE for normal pages.  That means that to
    figure out how many _bytes_ "dirty=1" means, you must first know the
    hugetlbfs page size.  That's easier said than done especially if you
    don't have visibility in to the mount.
    
    But, that's probably a discussion for another day especially since it
    would change behavior to fix it.  But, just in case anyone wonders why
    this patch only passes a '1' in the hugetlb case...

    XZ: Fix incorrect XZ_BUF_ERROR
    
    commit 9c1f8594df4814ebfd6822ca3c9444fb3445888d upstream.
    
    xz_dec_run() could incorrectly return XZ_BUF_ERROR if all of the
    following was true:
    
     - The caller knows how many bytes of output to expect and only provides
       that much output space.
    
     - When the last output bytes are decoded, the caller-provided input
       buffer ends right before the LZMA2 end of payload marker.  So LZMA2
       won't provide more output anymore, but it won't know it yet and thus
       won't return XZ_STREAM_END yet.
    
     - A BCJ filter is in use and it hasn't left any unfiltered bytes in the
       temp buffer.  This can happen with any BCJ filter, but in practice
       it's more likely with filters other than the x86 BCJ.
    
    This fixes <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735408> where
    Squashfs thinks that a valid file system is corrupt.
    
    This also fixes a similar bug in single-call mode where the uncompressed
    size of a block using BCJ + LZMA2 was 0 bytes and caller provided no
    output space.  Many empty .xz files don't contain any blocks and thus
    don't trigger this bug.
    
    This also tweaks a closely related detail: xz_dec_bcj_run() could call
    xz_dec_lzma2_run() to decode into temp buffer when it was known to be
    useless.  This was harmless although it wasted a minuscule number of CPU
    cycles.

    ixgbe: fix possible null buffer error
    
    commit b811ce9104a7f7663ddae4f7795a194a103b8f90 upstream.
    
    It seems that at least one PPC machine would occasionally give a (valid) 0 as
    the return value from dma_map, this caused the ixgbe code to not work
    correctly.  A fix is pending in the PPC tree to not return 0 from dma map, but
    we can also fix the driver to make sure we don't mess up in other arches as
    well.
    
    This patch is applicable to all current stable kernels.

    cifs: fix possible memory corruption in CIFSFindNext
    
    commit 9438fabb73eb48055b58b89fc51e0bc4db22fabd upstream.
    
    The name_len variable in CIFSFindNext is a signed int that gets set to
    the resume_name_len in the cifs_search_info. The resume_name_len however
    is unsigned and for some infolevels is populated directly from a 32 bit
    value sent by the server.
    
    If the server sends a very large value for this, then that value could
    look negative when converted to a signed int. That would make that
    value pass the PATH_MAX check later in CIFSFindNext. The name_len would
    then be used as a length value for a memcpy. It would then be treated
    as unsigned again, and the memcpy scribbles over a ton of memory.
    
    Fix this by making the name_len an unsigned value in CIFSFindNext.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix auto-mute with HP+LO configuration
    
    commit 8974bd51a77824d91010176f9a5da28513c2e1f5 upstream.
    
    When the system has only the headphone and the line-out jacks without
    speakers, the current auto-mute code doesn't work.  It's because the
    spec->automute_lines flag is wrongly referred in update_speakers().
    This flag must be meaningless when spec->automute_hp_lo isn't set, thus
    they should be always coupled.
    
    The patch fixes the problem and add a comment to indicate the
    relationship briefly.

    iwlagn: fix command queue timeout
    
    commit 282cdb325aea4ebbc42ce753b47cc96145eb54bc upstream.
    
    If the command queue is constantly busy,
    which can happen in P2P, the hangcheck
    timer will frequently find a command in
    it and will eventually reset the device
    because nothing sets the timestamp for
    this queue when commands are processed.
    
    Fix this by setting the timestamp when
    a command completes.

    USB: xhci: Set change bit when warm reset change is set.
    
    commit 44f4c3ed60fb21e1d2dd98304390ac121e6c7c6d upstream.
    
    Sometimes, when a USB 3.0 device is disconnected, the Intel Panther
    Point xHCI host controller will report a link state change with the
    state set to "SS.Inactive".  This causes the xHCI host controller to
    issue a warm port reset, which doesn't finish before the USB core times
    out while waiting for it to complete.
    
    When the warm port reset does complete, and the xHC gives back a port
    status change event, the xHCI driver kicks khubd.  However, it fails to
    set the bit indicating there is a change event for that port because the
    logic in xhci-hub.c doesn't check for the warm port reset bit.
    
    After that, the warm port status change bit is never cleared by the USB
    core, and the xHC stops reporting port status change bits.  (The xHCI
    spec says it shouldn't report more port events until all change bits are
    cleared.) This means any port changes when a new device is connected
    will never be reported, and the port will seem "dead" until the xHCI
    driver is unloaded and reloaded, or the computer is rebooted.  Fix this
    by making the xHCI driver set the port change bit when a warm port reset
    change bit is set.
    
    A better solution would be to make the USB core handle warm port reset
    in differently, merging the current code with the standard port reset
    code that does an incremental backoff on the timeout, and tries to
    complete the port reset two more times before giving up.  That more
    complicated fix will be merged next window, and this fix will be
    backported to stable.
    
    This should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, since that was the
    first kernel with commit a11496ebf375 ("xHCI: warm reset support").

    ALSA: pcm - fix race condition in wait_for_avail()
    
    commit 763437a9e7737535b2fc72175ad4974048769be6 upstream.
    
    wait_for_avail() in pcm_lib.c has a race in it (observed in practice by an
    Intel validation group).
    
    The function is supposed to return once space in the buffer has become
    available, or if some timeout happens.  The entity that creates space (irq
    handler of sound driver and some such) will do a wake up on a waitqueue
    that this function registers for.
    
    However there are two races in the existing code
    
    1) If space became available between the caller noticing there was no
       space and this function actually sleeping, the wakeup is missed and the
       timeout condition will happen instead
    
    2) If a wakeup happened but not sufficient space became available, the
       code will loop again and wait for more space.  However, if the second
       wake comes in prior to hitting the schedule_timeout_interruptible(), it
       will be missed, and potentially you'll wait out until the timeout
       happens.
    
    The fix consists of using more careful setting of the current state (so
    that if a wakeup happens in the main loop window, the schedule_timeout()
    falls through) and by checking for available space prior to going into the
    schedule_timeout() loop, but after being on the waitqueue and having the
    state set to interruptible.
    
    [tiwai: the following changes have been added to Arjan's original patch:
     - merged akpm's fix for waitqueue adding order into a single patch
     - reduction of duplicated code of avail check

    workqueue: lock cwq access in drain_workqueue
    
    commit fa2563e41c3d6d6e8af437643981ed28ae0cb56d upstream.
    
    Take cwq->gcwq->lock to avoid racing between drain_workqueue checking to

    and then incrementing nr_active when it activates a delayed work.
    
    We discovered this when a corner case in one of our drivers resulted in
    us trying to destroy a workqueue in which the remaining work would
    always requeue itself again in the same workqueue.  We would hit this
    race condition and trip the BUG_ON on workqueue.c:3080.

    mm: sync vmalloc address space page tables in alloc_vm_area()
    
    commit 461ae488ecb125b140d7ea29ceeedbcce9327003 upstream.
    
    Xen backend drivers (e.g., blkback and netback) would sometimes fail to
    map grant pages into the vmalloc address space allocated with
    alloc_vm_area().  The GNTTABOP_map_grant_ref would fail because Xen could
    not find the page (in the L2 table) containing the PTEs it needed to
    update.
    
    (XEN) mm.c:3846:d0 Could not find L1 PTE for address fbb42000
    
    netback and blkback were making the hypercall from a kernel thread where
    task->active_mm != &init_mm and alloc_vm_area() was only updating the page
    tables for init_mm.  The usual method of deferring the update to the page
    tables of other processes (i.e., after taking a fault) doesn't work as a
    fault cannot occur during the hypercall.
    
    This would work on some systems depending on what else was using vmalloc.
    
    Fix this by reverting ef691947d8a3 ("vmalloc: remove vmalloc_sync_all()
    from alloc_vm_area()") and add a comment to explain why it's needed.

    genirq: Make irq_shutdown() symmetric vs. irq_startup again
    
    commit ed585a651681e822089087b426e6ebfb6d3d9873 upstream.
    
    If an irq_chip provides .irq_shutdown(), but neither of .irq_disable() or
    .irq_mask(), free_irq() crashes when jumping to NULL.
    Fix this by only trying .irq_disable() and .irq_mask() if there's no
    .irq_shutdown() provided.
    
    This revives the symmetry with irq_startup(), which tries .irq_startup(),
    .irq_enable(), and irq_unmask(), and makes it consistent with the comment for
    irq_chip.irq_shutdown() in <linux/irq.h>, which says:
    
     * @irq_shutdown:       shut down the interrupt (defaults to ->disable if NULL)
    
    This is also how __free_irq() behaved before the big overhaul, cfr. e.g.
    3b56f0585fd4c02d047dc406668cb40159b2d340 ("genirq: Remove bogus conditional"),
    where the core interrupt code always overrode .irq_shutdown() to
    .irq_disable() if .irq_shutdown() was NULL.

    hpsa: fix physical device lun and target numbering problem
    
    commit 01350d05539d1c95ef3568d062d864ab76ae7670 upstream.
    
    If a physical device exposed to the OS by hpsa
    is replaced (e.g. one hot plug tape drive is replaced
    by another, or a tape drive is placed into "OBDR" mode
    in which it acts like a CD-ROM device) and a rescan is
    initiated, the replaced device will be added to the
    SCSI midlayer with target and lun numbers set to -1.
    After that, a panic is likely to ensue.  When a physical
    device is replaced, the lun and target number should be
    preserved.

    commit ee33e2b771f9e9e4aaba2bb2ace7b727fe451a8b upstream.
    
    The unsolicited frame control infrastructure requires a table of dma
    addresses for the hardware to lookup the frame buffer location by an
    index.  The hardware expects the elements of this table to be 64-bit
    quantities, so we cannot reference these elements as dma_addr_t.  All
    unsolicited frame protocols are affected, particularly SATA-PIO and SMP
    which prevented direct-attached SATA drives and expander-attached drives
    to not be discovered.

    fs/9p: Add OS dependent open flags in 9p protocol
    
    commit f88657ce3f9713a0c62101dffb0e972a979e77b9 upstream.
    
    Some of the flags are OS/arch dependent we add a 9p
    protocol value which maps to asm-generic/fcntl.h values in Linux
    Based on the original patch from Venkateswararao Jujjuri <jvrao@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
    
    [extra comments from author as to why this needs to go to stable:
    
    Earlier for different operation such as open we used the values of open
    flag as defined by the OS.  But some of these flags such as O_DIRECT are
    arch dependent. So if we have the 9p client and server running on
    different architectures, we end up with client sending client
    architecture value of these open flag and server will try to map these
    values to what its architecture states. For ex: O_DIRECT on a x86 client
    maps to
    
    #define O_DIRECT        00040000
    
    Where as on sparc server it will maps to
    
    #define O_DIRECT        0x100000
    
    Hence we need to map these open flags to OS/arch independent flag
    values.  Getting these changes to an early version of kernel ensures us
    that we work with different combination of client and server. We should
    ideally backport this patch to all possible kernel version.]

    fs/9p: Add fid before dentry instantiation
    
    commit 5441ae5eb3614d3c28f77073370738a2820c88e4 upstream.
    
    d_instantiate marks the dentry positive. So a parallel lookup and mkdir of
    the directory can find dentry that doesn't have fid attached. This can result
    in both the code path doing v9fs_fid_add which results in v9fs_dentry leak.

    ACPICA: Do not repair _TSS return package if _PSS is present
    
    commit 8f9c91273e36e5762c617c23e4fd48d5172e0dac upstream.
    
    We can only sort the _TSS return package if there is no _PSS
    in the same scope. This is because if _PSS is present, the ACPI
    specification dictates that the _TSS Power Dissipation field is
    to be ignored, and therefore some BIOSs leave garbage values in
    the _TSS Power field(s).  In this case, it is best to just return
    the _TSS package as-is.

    But this function is only called from update_domain() which

    vp7045: fix buffer setup
    
    commit fc61ccd35fd59d5362d37c8bf9c0526c85086c84 upstream.
    
    dvb_usb_device_init calls the frontend_attach method of this driver which
    uses vp7045_usb_ob. In order to have a buffer ready in vp7045_usb_op, it has to
    be allocated before that happens.
    
    Luckily we can use the whole private data as the buffer as it gets separately
    allocated on the heap via kzalloc in dvb_usb_device_init and is thus apt for
    use via usb_control_msg.
    
    This fixes a

    nuvoton-cir: simplify raw IR sample handling
    
    commit de4ed0c111ed078b8729a5cc49c23197740f5bad upstream.
    
    The nuvoton-cir driver was storing up consecutive pulse-pulse and
    space-space samples internally, for no good reason, since
    ir_raw_event_store_with_filter() already merges back to back like
    samples types for us. This should also fix a regression introduced late
    in 3.0 that related to a timeout change, which actually becomes correct
    when coupled with this change. Tested with RC6 and RC5 on my own
    nuvoton-cir hardware atop vanilla 3.0.0, after verifying quirky
    behavior in 3.0 due to the timeout change.

    md: Fix handling for devices from 2TB to 4TB in 0.90 metadata.
    
    commit 27a7b260f71439c40546b43588448faac01adb93 upstream.
    
    0.90 metadata uses an unsigned 32bit number to count the number of
    kilobytes used from each device.
    This should allow up to 4TB per device.
    However we multiply this by 2 (to get sectors) before casting to a
    larger type, so sizes above 2TB get truncated.
    
    Also we allow rdev->sectors to be larger than 4TB, so it is possible
    for the array to be resized larger than the metadata can handle.
    So make sure rdev->sectors never exceeds 4TB when 0.90 metadata is in
    used.
    
    Also the sanity check at the end of super_90_load should include level
    1 as it used ->size too. (RAID0 and Linear don't use ->size at all).

    Avoid dereferencing a 'request_queue' after last close.
    
    commit 94007751bb02797ba87bac7aacee2731ac2039a3 upstream.
    
    On the last close of an 'md' device which as been stopped, the device
    is destroyed and in particular the request_queue is freed.  The free
    is done in a separate thread so it might happen a short time later.
    
    __blkdev_put calls bdev_inode_switch_bdi *after* ->release has been
    called.
    
    Since commit f758eeabeb96f878c860e8f110f94ec8820822a9
    bdev_inode_switch_bdi will dereference the 'old' bdi, which lives
    inside a request_queue, to get a spin lock.  This causes the last
    close on an md device to sometime take a spin_lock which lives in
    freed memory - which results in an oops.
    
    So move the called to bdev_inode_switch_bdi before the call to
    ->release.

    commit 897a6a1a14837d6d582bfd1fd7aba00be44b6469 upstream.
    
    The TNET variant of DaVinci compiles some code that it shares
    with other DaVinci variants, however it has a V6 CPU rather than
    an ARM926T, thus the hardcoded call to arm926_flush_kern_cache_all()
    in sleep.S will obviously fail, and we need to build with the
    v6_flush_kern_cache_all() call instead. This was triggered by
    manually altering the DaVinci config to build the TNET version.

    ARM: davinci: da850 EVM: read mac address from SPI flash
    
    commit 810198bc9c109489dfadc57131c5183ce6ad2d7d upstream.
    
    DA850/OMAP-L138 EMAC driver uses random mac address instead of
    a fixed one because the mac address is not stuffed into EMAC
    platform data.
    
    This patch provides a function which reads the mac address
    stored in SPI flash (registered as MTD device) and populates the
    EMAC platform data. The function which reads the mac address is
    registered as a callback which gets called upon addition of MTD
    device.
    
    NOTE: In case the MAC address stored in SPI flash is erased, follow
    the instructions at [1] to restore it.
    
    [1] http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/GSG:_OMAP-L138_DVEVM_Additional_Procedures#Restoring_MAC_address_on_SPI_Flash
    
    Modifications in v2:
    Guarded registering the mtd_notifier only when MTD is enabled.
    Earlier this was handled using mtd_has_partitions() call, but
    this has been removed in Linux v3.0.
    
    Modifications in v3:
    a. Guarded da850_evm_m25p80_notify_add() function and
       da850evm_spi_notifier structure with CONFIG_MTD macros.
    b. Renamed da850_evm_register_mtd_user() function to
       da850_evm_setup_mac_addr() and removed the struct mtd_notifier
       argument to this function.
    c. Passed the da850evm_spi_notifier structure to register_mtd_user()
       function.
    
    Modifications in v4:
    Moved the da850_evm_setup_mac_addr() function within the first
    CONFIG_MTD ifdef construct.

    xen/smp: Warn user why they keel over - nosmp or noapic and what to use instead.
    
    commit ed467e69f16e6b480e2face7bc5963834d025f91 upstream.
    
    We have hit a couple of customer bugs where they would like to
    use those parameters to run an UP kernel - but both of those
    options turn of important sources of interrupt information so
    we end up not being able to boot. The correct way is to
    pass in 'dom0_max_vcpus=1' on the Xen hypervisor line and
    the kernel will patch itself to be a UP kernel.

    xen: x86_32: do not enable iterrupts when returning from exception in interrupt context
    
    commit d198d499148a0c64a41b3aba9e7dd43772832b91 upstream.
    
    If vmalloc page_fault happens inside of interrupt handler with interrupts
    disabled then on exit path from exception handler when there is no pending
    interrupts, the following code (arch/x86/xen/xen-asm_32.S:112):
    
            cmpw $0x0001, XEN_vcpu_info_pending(%eax)
            sete XEN_vcpu_info_mask(%eax)
    
    will enable interrupts even if they has been previously disabled according to
    eflags from the bounce frame (arch/x86/xen/xen-asm_32.S:99)
    
            testb $X86_EFLAGS_IF>>8, 8+1+ESP_OFFSET(%esp)
            setz XEN_vcpu_info_mask(%eax)
    
    Solution is in setting XEN_vcpu_info_mask only when it should be set
    according to
            cmpw $0x0001, XEN_vcpu_info_pending(%eax)
    but not clearing it if there isn't any pending events.

    mmc: sdhci-s3c: Fix mmc card I/O problem
    
    commit 49bb1e619568ec84785ceb366f07db2a6f0b64cc upstream.
    
    This patch fixes the problem in sdhci-s3c host driver for Samsung Soc's.
    During the card identification stage the mmc core driver enumerates for
    the best bus width in combination with the highest available data rate.
    It starts enumerating from the highest bus width (8) to lowest width (1).
    
    In case of few MMC cards the 4-bit bus enumeration fails and tries
    the 1-bit bus enumeration. When switched to 1-bit bus mode the host driver
    has to clear the previous bus width setting and apply the new setting.
    
    The current patch will clear the previous bus mode and apply the new
    mode setting.

    mmc: core: use non-reentrant workqueue for clock gating
    
    commit 50a50f9248497484c678631a9c1a719f1aaeab79 upstream.
    
    The default multithread workqueue can cause the same work to be executed
    concurrently on a different CPUs. This isn't really suitable for clock
    gating as it might already gated the clock and gating it twice results both
    host->clk_old and host->ios.clock to be set to 0.
    
    To prevent this from happening we use system_nrt_wq instead.

    mmc: core: prevent aggressive clock gating racing with ios updates
    
    commit 778e277cb82411c9002ca28ccbd216c4d9eb9158 upstream.
    
    We have seen at least two different races when clock gating kicks in in a
    middle of ios structure update.
    
    First one happens when ios->clock is changed outside of aggressive clock
    gating framework, for example via mmc_set_clock(). The race might happen
    when we run following code:
    
    mmc_set_ios():
            ...
            if (ios->clock > 0)
                    mmc_set_ungated(host);
    
    Now if gating kicks in right after the condition check we end up setting
    host->clk_gated to false even though we have just gated the clock. Next
    time a request is started we try to ungate and restore the clock in
    mmc_host_clk_hold(). However since we have host->clk_gated set to false the
    original clock is not restored.
    
    This eventually will cause the host controller to hang since its clock is
    disabled while we are trying to issue a request. For example on Intel
    Medfield platform we see:

    Second race might happen while running mmc_power_off():

            host->ios.clock = 0;
            host->ios.vdd = 0;
    
    [ clock gating kicks in here ]
    
            /*
             * Reset ocr mask to be the highest possible voltage supported for

             */
            host->ocr = 1 << (fls(host->ocr_avail) - 1);
    
            if (!mmc_host_is_spi(host)) {
                    host->ios.bus_mode = MMC_BUSMODE_OPENDRAIN;
                    host->ios.chip_select = MMC_CS_DONTCARE;
            }
            host->ios.power_mode = MMC_POWER_OFF;
            host->ios.bus_width = MMC_BUS_WIDTH_1;
            host->ios.timing = MMC_TIMING_LEGACY;
            mmc_set_ios(host);
    }
    
    If the clock gating worker kicks in while we are only partially updated the
    ios structure the host controller gets incomplete ios and might not work as
    supposed. Again on Intel Medfield platform we get:

    This BUG() comes from the fact that ios.power_mode was still in previous
    value (MMC_POWER_ON) and ios.vdd was set to zero.
    
    We prevent these by inhibiting the clock gating while we update the ios
    structure.
    
    Both problems can be reproduced by simply running the device in a reboot
    loop.

    sched: Move blk_schedule_flush_plug() out of __schedule()
    
    commit 9c40cef2b799f9b5e7fa5de4d2ad3a0168ba118c upstream.
    
    There is no real reason to run blk_schedule_flush_plug() with
    interrupts and preemption disabled.
    
    Move it into schedule() and call it when the task is going voluntarily
    to sleep. There might be false positives when the task is woken
    between that call and actually scheduling, but that's not really
    different from being woken immediately after switching away.
    
    This fixes a deadlock in the scheduler where the
    blk_schedule_flush_plug() callchain enables interrupts and thereby
    allows a wakeup to happen of the task that's going to sleep.

    sched: Separate the scheduler entry for preemption
    
    commit c259e01a1ec90063042f758e409cd26b2a0963c8 upstream.
    
    Block-IO and workqueues call into notifier functions from the
    scheduler core code with interrupts and preemption disabled. These
    calls should be made before entering the scheduler core.
    
    To simplify this, separate the scheduler core code into
    __schedule(). __schedule() is directly called from the places which
    set PREEMPT_ACTIVE and from schedule(). This allows us to add the work
    checks into schedule(), so they are only called when a task voluntary
    goes to sleep.

    rtc: Fix RTC PIE frequency limit
    
    commit 938f97bcf1bdd1b681d5d14d1d7117a2e22d4434 upstream.
    
    Thomas earlier submitted a fix to limit the RTC PIE freq, but
    picked 5000Hz out of the air. Willy noticed that we should
    instead use the 8192Hz max from the rtc man documentation.

    alarmtimers: Avoid possible denial of service with high freq periodic timers
    
    commit 6af7e471e5a7746b8024d70b4363d3dfe41d36b8 upstream.
    
    Its possible to jam up the alarm timers by setting very small interval
    timers, which will cause the alarmtimer subsystem to spend all of its time
    firing and restarting timers. This can effectivly lock up a box.
    
    A deeper fix is needed, closely mimicking the hrtimer code, but for now
    just cap the interval to 100us to avoid userland hanging the system.

    iomux-v3.c uses NO_PAD_CTRL as a 32 bit value

    Previously, anything requesting NO_PAD_CTRL would get
    their pad control register set to 0.
    
    Since it is a pad control mask, place it with the other mask values.

    mm: page allocator: reconsider zones for allocation after direct reclaim
    
    commit 76d3fbf8fbf6cc78ceb63549e0e0c5bc8a88f838 upstream.
    
    With zone_reclaim_mode enabled, it's possible for zones to be considered
    full in the zonelist_cache so they are skipped in the future.  If the
    process enters direct reclaim, the ZLC may still consider zones to be full
    even after reclaiming pages.  Reconsider all zones for allocation if
    direct reclaim returns successfully.

    mm: page allocator: initialise ZLC for first zone eligible for zone_reclaim
    
    commit cd38b115d5ad79b0100ac6daa103c4fe2c50a913 upstream.
    
    There have been a small number of complaints about significant stalls
    while copying large amounts of data on NUMA machines reported on a
    distribution bugzilla.  In these cases, zone_reclaim was enabled by
    default due to large NUMA distances.  In general, the complaints have not
    been about the workload itself unless it was a file server (in which case
    the recommendation was disable zone_reclaim).
    
    The stalls are mostly due to significant amounts of time spent scanning
    the preferred zone for pages to free.  After a failure, it might fallback
    to another node (as zonelists are often node-ordered rather than
    zone-ordered) but stall quickly again when the next allocation attempt
    occurs.  In bad cases, each page allocated results in a full scan of the
    preferred zone.
    
    Patch 1 checks the preferred zone for recent allocation failure
            which is particularly important if zone_reclaim has failed
            recently.  This avoids rescanning the zone in the near future and
            instead falling back to another node.  This may hurt node locality
            in some cases but a failure to zone_reclaim is more expensive than
            a remote access.
    
    Patch 2 clears the zlc information after direct reclaim.
            Otherwise, zone_reclaim can mark zones full, direct reclaim can
            reclaim enough pages but the zone is still not considered for
            allocation.
    
    This was tested on a 24-thread 2-node x86_64 machine.  The tests were
    focused on large amounts of IO.  All tests were bound to the CPUs on
    node-0 to avoid disturbances due to processes being scheduled on different
    nodes.  The kernels tested are

    This test downloads a large tarfile and copies it with dd a number of
    times - similar to the most recent bug report I've dealt with.  Time to
    completion is reduced.  The number of pages scanned directly is still
    disturbingly high with a low efficiency but this is likely due to the
    number of dirty pages encountered.  The figures could probably be improved
    with more work around how kswapd is used and how dirty pages are handled
    but that is separate work and this result is significant on its own.

    This test just creates a large file mapping and writes to it linearly.
    Time to completion is again reduced.
    
    The gains are mostly down to two things.  In many cases, there is less
    scanning as zone_reclaim simply gives up faster due to recent failures.
    The second reason is that memory is used more efficiently.  Instead of
    scanning the preferred zone every time, the allocator falls back to
    another zone and uses it instead improving overall memory utilisation.
    
    This patch: initialise ZLC for first zone eligible for zone_reclaim.
    
    The zonelist cache (ZLC) is used among other things to record if
    zone_reclaim() failed for a particular zone recently.  The intention is to
    avoid a high cost scanning extremely long zonelists or scanning within the
    zone uselessly.
    
    Currently the zonelist cache is setup only after the first zone has been
    considered and zone_reclaim() has been called.  The objective was to avoid
    a costly setup but zone_reclaim is itself quite expensive.  If it is
    failing regularly such as the first eligible zone having mostly mapped
    pages, the cost in scanning and allocation stalls is far higher than the
    ZLC initialisation step.
    
    This patch initialises ZLC before the first eligible zone calls
    zone_reclaim().  Once initialised, it is checked whether the zone failed
    zone_reclaim recently.  If it has, the zone is skipped.  As the first zone
    is now being checked, additional care has to be taken about zones marked
    full.  A zone can be marked "full" because it should not have enough
    unmapped pages for zone_reclaim but this is excessive as direct reclaim or
    kswapd may succeed where zone_reclaim fails.  Only mark zones "full" after
    zone_reclaim fails if it failed to reclaim enough pages after scanning.

    ARM: 7014/1: cache-l2x0: Fix L2 Cache size calculation.
    
    commit 43c734be5571a4daad9f0a3e0b3229a1c0049917 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes L2 Cache size calculations for L2C-210, L2C-310 and
    PL310, by changing the L2X0_AUX_CTRL_WAY_SIZE_MASK from 2 bits to 3
    bits.
    
    The Auxiliary Control Register for L2C-210, L2C-310 and PL310 has 3bits
    [19:17] for Way size, however the existing code only uses 2 bits to
    get this value. This results in incorrect cachesize calculations.
    
    It also results in performing operations on the whole cache when we
    erroneously decide that the range is big enough (due to l2x0_size being
    too small) and also prints incorrect cachesize.

    sparc32,sun4d: Change IPI IRQ level to prevent collision between IPI and timer interrupt
    
    commit 38f7f8f05e8239e9871f7e1c4b0a842080e85315 upstream.
    
    On Sun4d systems running in SMP mode, IRQ 14 is used for timer interrupts
    and has a specialized interrupt handler. IPI is currently set to use IRQ 14
    as well, which causes it to trigger the timer interrupt handler, and not the
    IPI interrupt handler.
    
    The IPI interrupt is therefore changed to IRQ 13, which is the highest
    normally handled interrupt. This IRQ is also used for SBUS interrupts,
    however there is nothing in the IPI/SBUS interrupt handlers that indicate
    that they will not handle sharing the interrupt.
    (IRQ 13 is indicated as audio interrupt, which is unlikely to be found in a
    sun4d system)

    If we can't push the pending register windows onto the user's stack,
    we disallow signal delivery even if the signal would be delivered on a
    valid seperate signal stack.
    
    Add a register window save area in the signal frame, and store any
    unsavable windows there.
    
    On sigreturn, if any windows are still queued up in the signal frame,
    try to push them back onto the stack and if that fails we kill the
    process immediately.
    
    This allows the debug/tst-longjmp_chk2 glibc test case to pass.

    sparc32: unbreak arch_write_unlock()
    
    commit 3f6aa0b113846a8628baa649af422cfc6fb1d786 upstream.
    
    The sparc32 version of arch_write_unlock() is just a plain assignment.
    Unfortunately this allows the compiler to schedule side-effects in a
    protected region to occur after the HW-level unlock, which is broken.
    E.g., the following trivial test case gets miscompiled:
    
            #include <linux/spinlock.h>
            rwlock_t lock;
            int counter;
            void foo(void) { write_lock(&lock); ++counter; write_unlock(&lock); }
    
    Fixed by adding a compiler memory barrier to arch_write_unlock().  The
    sparc64 version combines the barrier and assignment into a single asm(),
    and implements the operation as a static inline, so that's what I did too.
    
    Compile-tested with sparc32_defconfig + CONFIG_SMP=y.

    sparc64: remove unnecessary macros from spinlock_64.h
    
    commit a0fba3eb059e73fed2d376a901f8117734c12f1f upstream.
    
    The sparc64 spinlock_64.h contains a number of operations defined
    first as static inline functions, and then as macros with the same
    names and parameters as the functions.  Maybe this was needed at
    some point in the past, but now nothing seems to depend on these
    macros (checked with a recursive grep looking for ifdefs on these
    names).  Other archs don't define these identity-macros.
    
    So this patch deletes these unnecessary macros.
    
    Compile-tested with sparc64_defconfig.

    commit fbe5e29ec1886967255e76946aaf537b8cc9b81e upstream.
    
    This oops have been already fixed with commit

        atm: [br2684] Fix oops due to skb->dev being NULL
    
        It happens that if a packet arrives in a VC between the call to open it on
        the hardware and the call to change the backend to br2684, br2684_regvcc
        processes the packet and oopses dereferencing skb->dev because it is
        NULL before the call to br2684_push().

    commit 6d0e194d2eefcaab6dbdca1f639748660144acb5 upstream.
    
    On AVERATEC 3200, pata_via causes memory corruption with ATAPI DMA,
    which often leads to random kernel oops.  The cause of the problem is
    not well understood yet and only small subset of machines using the
    controller seem affected.  Blacklist ATAPI DMA on the machine.

    savagedb: Fix typo causing regression in savage4 series video chip detection
    
    commit 4b00e4b3940eabb38adeec0823751820fe2d6fda upstream.
    
    Two additional savage4 variants were added, but the S3_SAVAGE4_SERIES
    macro was incompletely modified, resulting in a false positive detection
    of a savage4 card regardless of which savage card is actually present.
    
    For non-savage4 series cards, such as a Savage/IX-MV card, this results
    in garbled video and/or a hard-hang at boot time.  Fix this by changing
    an '||' to an '&&' in the S3_SAVAGE4_SERIES macro.

    When hibernating ->resume may not be called by usb core, but disconnect
    and probe instead, so we do not increase the counter after decreasing
    it in ->supend. As a result we free memory early, and get crash when
    unplugging usb dongle.

    ath9k_hw: Fix STA (AR9485) bringup issue due to incorrect MAC address
    
    commit b503c7a273c0a3018ad11ea8c513c639120afbf4 upstream.
    
    Due to some recent optimization done in the way the mac address
    bytes are written into the OTP memory, some AR9485 chipsets were
    forced to use the first byte from the eeprom template and the
    remaining bytes are read from OTP.
    
    AR9485 happens to use generic eeprom template which has 0x1 as
    the first byte causes issues in bringing up the card.
    
    So fixed the eeprom template accordingly to address the issue.

    If is_main_vif(ar, vif) reports that we have to fall back

    sendmmsg/sendmsg: fix unsafe user pointer access
    
    commit bc909d9ddbf7778371e36a651d6e4194b1cc7d4c upstream.
    
    Dereferencing a user pointer directly from kernel-space without going
    through the copy_from_user family of functions is a bad idea. Two of
    such usages can be found in the sendmsg code path called from sendmmsg,
    added by
    
    commit c71d8ebe7a4496fb7231151cb70a6baa0cb56f9a upstream.
    commit 5b47b8038f183b44d2d8ff1c7d11a5c1be706b34 in the 3.0-stable tree.
    
    Usages are performed through memcmp() and memcpy() directly. Fix those
    by using the already copied msg_sys structure instead of the __user *msg
    structure. Note that msg_sys can be set to NULL by verify_compat_iovec()
    or verify_iovec(), which requires additional NULL pointer checks.

    xhci: Handle zero-length isochronous packets.
    
    commit 48df4a6fd8c40c0bbcbca2044f5f2bc75dcf6db1 upstream.
    
    For a long time, the xHCI driver has had this note:
            /* FIXME: Ignoring zero-length packets, can those happen? */
    
    It turns out that, yes, there are drivers that need to queue zero-length
    transfers for isochronous OUT transfers.  Without this patch, users will
    see kernel hang messages when a driver attempts to enqueue an isochronous
    URB with a zero length transfer (because count_isoc_trbs_needed will return
    zero for that TD, xhci_td->last_trb will never be set, and updating the
    dequeue pointer will cause an infinite loop).
    
    Matěj ran into this issue when using an NI Audio4DJ USB soundcard
    with the snd-usb-caiaq driver.  See
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40702
    
    Fix count_isoc_trbs_needed() to return 1 for zero-length transfers (thanks
    Alan on the math help).  Update the various TRB field calculations to deal
    with zero-length transfers.  We're still transferring one packet with a
    zero-length data payload, so the total_packet_count should be 1. The

    xhci: Remove TDs from TD lists when URBs are canceled.
    
    commit 585df1d90cb07a02ca6c7a7d339e56e46d50dafb upstream.
    
    When a driver tries to cancel an URB, and the host controller is dying,
    xhci_urb_dequeue will giveback the URB without removing the xhci_tds
    that comprise that URB from the td_list or the cancelled_td_list.  This
    can cause a race condition between the driver calling URB dequeue and
    the stop endpoint command watchdog timer.
    
    If the timer fires on a dying host, and a driver attempts to resubmit
    while the watchdog timer has dropped the xhci->lock to giveback a
    cancelled URB, URBs may be given back by the xhci_urb_dequeue() function.
    At that point, the URB's priv pointer will be freed and set to NULL, but
    the TDs will remain on the td_list.  This will cause an oops in
    xhci_giveback_urb_in_irq() when the watchdog timer attempts to loop
    through the endpoints' td_lists, giving back killed URBs.
    
    Make sure that xhci_urb_dequeue() removes TDs from the TD lists and
    canceled TD lists before it gives back the URB.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36.

    xhci: Fix failed enqueue in the middle of isoch TD.
    
    commit 522989a27c7badb608155b1f1dea3487ed431f74 upstream.
    
    When an isochronous transfer is enqueued, xhci_queue_isoc_tx_prepare()
    will ensure that there is enough room on the transfer rings for all of the
    isochronous TDs for that URB.  However, when xhci_queue_isoc_tx() is
    enqueueing individual isoc TDs, the prepare_transfer() function can fail
    if the endpoint state has changed to disabled, error, or some other
    unknown state.
    
    With the current code, if Nth TD (not the first TD) fails, the ring is
    left in a sorry state.  The partially enqueued TDs are left on the ring,
    and the first TRB of the TD is not given back to the hardware.  The
    enqueue pointer is left on the TRB after the last successfully enqueued
    TD.  This means the ring is basically useless.  Any new transfers will be
    enqueued after the failed TDs, which the hardware will never read because
    the cycle bit indicates it does not own them.  The ring will fill up with
    untransferred TDs, and the endpoint will be basically unusable.
    
    The untransferred TDs will also remain on the TD list.  Since the td_list
    is a FIFO, this basically means the ring handler will be waiting on TDs
    that will never be completed (or worse, dereference memory that doesn't
    exist any more).
    
    Change the code to clean up the isochronous ring after a failed transfer.
    If the first TD failed, simply return and allow the xhci_urb_enqueue
    function to free the urb_priv.  If the Nth TD failed, first remove the TDs
    from the td_list.  Then convert the TRBs that were enqueued into No-op
    TRBs.  Make sure to flip the cycle bit on all enqueued TRBs (including any
    link TRBs in the middle or between TDs), but leave the cycle bit of the
    first TRB (which will show software-owned) intact.  Then move the ring
    enqueue pointer back to the first TRB and make sure to change the
    xhci_ring's cycle state to what is appropriate for that ring segment.
    
    This ensures that the No-op TRBs will be overwritten by subsequent TDs,
    and the hardware will not start executing random TRBs because the cycle
    bit was left as hardware-owned.
    
    This bug is unlikely to be hit, but it was something I noticed while
    tracking down the watchdog timer issue.  I verified that the fix works by
    injecting some errors on the 250th isochronous URB queued, although I
    could not verify that the ring is in the correct state because uvcvideo
    refused to talk to the device after the first usb_submit_urb() failed.
    Ring debugging shows that the ring looks correct, however.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36.

    xhci: Fix memory leak during failed enqueue.
    
    commit d13565c12828ce0cd2a3862bf6260164a0653352 upstream.
    
    When the isochronous transfer support was introduced, and the xHCI driver
    switched to using urb->hcpriv to store an "urb_priv" pointer, a couple of
    memory leaks were introduced into the URB enqueue function in its error
    handling paths.
    
    xhci_urb_enqueue allocates urb_priv, but it doesn't free it if changing
    the control endpoint's max packet size fails or the bulk endpoint is in
    the middle of allocating or deallocating streams.
    
    xhci_urb_enqueue also doesn't free urb_priv if any of the four endpoint
    types' enqueue functions fail.  Instead, it expects those functions to
    free urb_priv if an error occurs.  However, the bulk, control, and
    interrupt enqueue functions do not free urb_priv if the endpoint ring is
    NULL.  It will, however, get freed if prepare_transfer() fails in those
    enqueue functions.
    
    Several of the error paths in the isochronous endpoint enqueue function
    also fail to free it.  xhci_queue_isoc_tx_prepare() doesn't free urb_priv
    if prepare_ring() indicates there is not enough room for all the
    isochronous TDs in this URB.  If individual isochronous TDs fail to be
    queued (perhaps due to an endpoint state change), urb_priv is also leaked.
    
    This argues that the freeing of urb_priv should be done in the function
    that allocated it, xhci_urb_enqueue.
    
    This patch looks rather ugly, but refactoring the code will have to wait
    because this patch needs to be backported to stable kernels.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36.

    xHCI: report USB2 port in resuming as suspend
    
    commit 8a8ff2f9399b23b968901f585ccb5a70a537c5ae upstream.
    
    When a USB2 port initiate a remote wakeup, software shall ensure that
    resume is signaled for at least 20ms, and then write '0' to the PLS field.
    According to this, xhci driver do the following things:
    
    1. When receive a remote wakeup event in irq_handler, set the resume_done
       value as jiffies + 20ms, and modify rh_timer to poll root hub status at
       that time;
    2. When receive a GetPortStatus request, if the jiffies is after the
       resume_done value, clear the resume signal and resume_done.
    
    However, if usb_port_resume() is called before the rh_timer triggered, it
    will indicate the port as Suspend Cleared and skip the clear resume signal
    part. The device will fail the usb_get_status request in finish_port_resume(),
    and usbcore will try a reset-resume instead. Device will work OK after
    reset-resume, but resume_done value is not cleared in this case, and
    xhci_bus_suspend() will fail because when it finds a non-zero resume_done
    value, it will regard the port as resuming and return -EBUSY.
    
    This causes issue on some platforms that the system fail to suspend
    after remote wakeup from suspend by USB2 devices connected to xHCI port.
    
    To fix this issue, report the port status as suspend if the resume is
    signaling less that 20ms, and usb_port_resume() will wait 25ms and check
    port status again, so xHCI driver can clear the resume signaling and
    resume_done value.

    TTY: pty, fix pty counting
    
    commit 24d406a6bf736f7aebdc8fa0f0ec86e0890c6d24 upstream.
    
    tty_operations->remove is normally called like:
    queue_release_one_tty
     ->tty_shutdown
       ->tty_driver_remove_tty
         ->tty_operations->remove
    
    However tty_shutdown() is called from queue_release_one_tty() only if
    tty_operations->shutdown is NULL. But for pty, it is not.
    pty_unix98_shutdown() is used there as ->shutdown.
    
    So tty_operations->remove of pty (i.e. pty_unix98_remove()) is never
    called. This results in invalid pty_count. I.e. what can be seen in
    /proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr.
    
    I see this was already reported at:
      https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/11/5/370
    But it was not fixed since then.
    
    This patch is kind of a hackish way. The problem lies in ->install. We
    allocate there another tty (so-called tty->link). So ->install is
    called once, but ->remove twice, for both tty and tty->link. The fix
    here is to count both tty and tty->link and divide the count by 2 for
    user.
    
    And to have ->remove called, let's make tty_driver_remove_tty() global
    and call that from pty_unix98_shutdown() (tty_operations->shutdown).
    
    While at it, let's document that when ->shutdown is defined,
    tty_shutdown() is not called.

    8250: Fix race condition in serial8250_backup_timeout().
    
    commit dbb3b1ca5609d1f3848cd387d06cc60aaacf7f98 upstream.
    
    This is to fix an issue where output will suddenly become very slow.
    The problem occurs on 8250 UARTS with the hardware bug UART_BUG_THRE.
    
    BACKGROUND
    For normal UARTs (without UART_BUG_THRE): When the serial core layer
    gets new transmit data and the transmitter is idle, it buffers the
    data and calls the 8250s' serial8250_start_tx() routine which will
    simply enable the TX interrupt in the IER register and return. This
    should immediately fire a THRE interrupt and begin transmitting the
    data.
    For buggy UARTs (with UART_BUG_THRE): merely enabling the TX interrupt
    in IER does not necessarily generate a new THRE interrupt.
    Therefore, a background timer periodically checks to see if there is
    pending data, and starts transmission if that is the case.
    
    The bug happens on SMP systems when the system has nothing to transmit,
    the transmit interrupt is disabled and the following sequence occurs:
    - CPU0: The background timer routine serial8250_backup_timeout()
      starts and saves the state of the interrupt enable register (IER)
      and then disables all interrupts in IER. NOTE: The transmit interrupt
      (TI) bit is saved as disabled.
    - CPU1: The serial core gets data to transmit, grabs the port lock and
      calls serial8250_start_tx() which enables the TI in IER.
    - CPU0: serial8250_backup_timeout() waits for the port lock.
    - CPU1: finishes (with TI enabled) and releases the port lock.
    - CPU0: serial8250_backup_timeout() calls the interrupt routine which
      will transmit the next fifo's worth of data and then restores the
      IER from the previously saved value (TI disabled).
    At this point, as long as the serial core has more transmit data
    buffered, it will not call serial8250_start_tx() again and the
    background timer routine will slowly transmit the data.
    
    The fix is to have serial8250_start_tx() get the port lock before
    it saves the IER state and release it after restoring IER. This will
    prevent serial8250_start_tx() from running in parallel.

    serial: 8250_pnp: add Intermec CV60 touchscreen device
    
    commit ab8ba3a2d2cba6a658ef596cd5b2e0905b6c8a9f upstream.
    
    It would have been nice if Intermec had supplied a PNP0501 _CID for the
    COM3 device, but they didn't, so we have to recognize it explicitly.

    omap-serial: Allow IXON and IXOFF to be disabled.
    
    commit b280a97d1caf6fe1d38b51ebb31219391f5ad1a0 upstream.
    
    Fixes logic bug that software flow control cannot be disabled, because
    serial_omap_configure_xonxoff() is not called if both IXON and IXOFF bits
    are cleared.

    arch/powerpc/sysdev/fsl_rio.c: correct IECSR register clear value
    
    commit 671ee7f0ce62e4b991b47fcf1c161c3f710dabbc upstream.
    
    This bug causes the IECSR register clear failure.  In this case, the RETE
    (retry error threshold exceeded) interrupt will be generated and cannot be
    cleared.  So the related ISR may be called persistently.
    
    The RETE bit in IECSR is cleared by writing a 1 to it.

    rapidio: fix use of non-compatible registers
    
    commit 284fb68d00c56e971ed01e0b4bac5ddd4d1b74ab upstream.
    
    Replace/remove use of RIO v.1.2 registers/bits that are not
    forward-compatible with newer versions of RapidIO specification.
    
    RapidIO specification v.1.3 removed Write Port CSR, Doorbell CSR,
    Mailbox CSR and Mailbox and Doorbell bits of the PEF CAR.
    
    Use of removed (since RIO v.1.3) register bits affects users of
    currently available 1.3 and 2.x compliant devices who may use not so
    recent kernel versions.
    
    Removing checks for unsupported bits makes corresponding routines
    compatible with all versions of RapidIO specification.  Therefore,
    backporting makes stable kernel versions compliant with RIO v.1.3 and
    later as well.

    kernel/printk: do not turn off bootconsole in printk_late_init() if keep_bootcon
    
    commit 4c30c6f566c0989ddaee3407da44751e340a63ed upstream.
    
    It seems that 7bf693951a8e ("console: allow to retain boot console via
    boot option keep_bootcon") doesn't always achieve what it aims, as when
    printk_late_init() runs it unconditionally turns off all boot consoles.
    With this patch, I am able to see more messages on the boot console in
    KVM guests than I can without, when keep_bootcon is specified.
    
    I think it is appropriate for the relevant -stable trees.  However, it's
    more of an annoyance than a serious bug (ideally you don't need to keep
    the boot console around as console handover should be working -- I was
    encountering a situation where the console handover wasn't working and
    not having the boot console available meant I couldn't see why).
