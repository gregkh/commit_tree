    crypto: ghash-clmulni-intel - use C implementation for setkey()
    
    commit 8ceee72808d1ae3fb191284afc2257a2be964725 upstream.
    
    The GHASH setkey() function uses SSE registers but fails to call
    kernel_fpu_begin()/kernel_fpu_end(). Instead of adding these calls, and
    then having to deal with the restriction that they cannot be called from
    interrupt context, move the setkey() implementation to the C domain.
    
    Note that setkey() does not use any particular SSE features and is not
    expected to become a performance bottleneck.

    ARC: [nsimosci] Unbork console
    
    commit 61fb4bfc010b0d2940f7fd87acbce6a0f03217cb upstream.
    
    Despite the switch to right UART driver (prev patch), serial console
    still doesn't work due to missing CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM
    
    Also fix the default cmdline in DT to not refer to out-of-tree
    ARC framebuffer driver for console.

    ARC: [nsimosci] Change .dts to use generic 8250 UART
    
    commit 6eda477b3c54b8236868c8784e5e042ff14244f0 upstream.
    
    The Synopsys APB DW UART has a couple of special features that are not
    in the System C model. In 3.8, the 8250_dw driver didn't really use these
    features, but from 3.9 onwards, the 8250_dw driver has become incompatible
    with our model.

    isdnloop: several buffer overflows
    
    [ Upstream commit 7563487cbf865284dcd35e9ef5a95380da046737 ]
    
    There are three buffer overflows addressed in this patch.
    
    1) In isdnloop_fake_err() we add an 'E' to a 60 character string and
    then copy it into a 60 character buffer.  I have made the destination
    buffer 64 characters and I'm changed the sprintf() to a snprintf().
    
    2) In isdnloop_parse_cmd(), p points to a 6 characters into a 60
    character buffer so we have 54 characters.  The ->eazlist[] is 11
    characters long.  I have modified the code to return if the source
    buffer is too long.
    
    3) In isdnloop_command() the cbuf[] array was 60 characters long but the
    max length of the string then can be up to 79 characters.  I made the
    cbuf array 80 characters long and changed the sprintf() to snprintf().
    I also removed the temporary "dial" buffer and changed it to use "p"
    directly.
    
    Unfortunately, we pass the "cbuf" string from isdnloop_command() to
    isdnloop_writecmd() which truncates anything over 60 characters to make
    it fit in card->omsg[].  (It can accept values up to 255 characters so
    long as there is a '\n' character every 60 characters).  For now I have
    just fixed the memory corruption bug and left the other problems in this
    driver alone.

    net: vxlan: fix crash when interface is created with no group
    
    [ Upstream commit 5933a7bbb5de66482ea8aa874a7ebaf8e67603c4 ]
    
    If the vxlan interface is created without explicit group definition,
    there are corner cases which may cause kernel panic.
    
    For instance, in the following scenario:
    
    node A:
    $ ip link add dev vxlan42  address 2c:c2:60:00:10:20 type vxlan id 42
    $ ip addr add dev vxlan42 10.0.0.1/24
    $ ip link set up dev vxlan42
    $ arp -i vxlan42 -s 10.0.0.2 2c:c2:60:00:01:02
    $ bridge fdb add dev vxlan42 to 2c:c2:60:00:01:02 dst <IPv4 address>
    $ ping 10.0.0.2
    
    node B:
    $ ip link add dev vxlan42 address 2c:c2:60:00:01:02 type vxlan id 42
    $ ip addr add dev vxlan42 10.0.0.2/24
    $ ip link set up dev vxlan42
    $ arp -i vxlan42 -s 10.0.0.1 2c:c2:60:00:10:20
    
    node B crashes:
    
     vxlan42: 2c:c2:60:00:10:20 migrated from 4011:eca4:c0a8:6466:c0a8:6415:8e09:2118 to (invalid address)

    When vxlan interface is created without explicit group definition, the
    default_dst protocol family is initialiazed to AF_UNSPEC and the driver
    assumes IPv4 configuration. On the other side, the default_dst protocol
    family is used to differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6 cases and, since,
    AF_UNSPEC != AF_INET, the processing takes the IPv6 path.
    
    Making the IPv4 assumption explicit by settting default_dst protocol
    family to AF_INET4 and preventing mixing of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in
    snooped fdb entries fixes the corner case crashes.

    xen-netback: disable rogue vif in kthread context
    
    [ Upstream commit e9d8b2c2968499c1f96563e6522c56958d5a1d0d ]
    
    When netback discovers frontend is sending malformed packet it will
    disables the interface which serves that frontend.
    
    However disabling a network interface involving taking a mutex which
    cannot be done in softirq context, so we need to defer this process to
    kthread context.
    
    This patch does the following:
    1. introduce a flag to indicate the interface is disabled.
    2. check that flag in TX path, don't do any work if it's true.
    3. check that flag in RX path, turn off that interface if it's true.
    
    The reason to disable it in RX path is because RX uses kthread. After
    this change the behavior of netback is still consistent -- it won't do
    any TX work for a rogue frontend, and the interface will be eventually
    turned off.
    
    Also change a "continue" to "break" after xenvif_fatal_tx_err, as it
    doesn't make sense to continue processing packets if frontend is rogue.
    
    This is a fix for XSA-90.

    netlink: don't compare the nul-termination in nla_strcmp
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b7b932434f5eee495b91a2804f5b64ebb2bc835 ]
    
    nla_strcmp compares the string length plus one, so it's implicitly
    including the nul-termination in the comparison.
    
     int nla_strcmp(const struct nlattr *nla, const char *str)
     {
            int len = strlen(str) + 1;
            ...
                    d = memcmp(nla_data(nla), str, len);
    
    However, if NLA_STRING is used, userspace can send us a string without
    the nul-termination. This is a problem since the string
    comparison will not match as the last byte may be not the
    nul-termination.
    
    Fix this by skipping the comparison of the nul-termination if the
    attribute data is nul-terminated. Suggested by Thomas Graf.

    ipv6: some ipv6 statistic counters failed to disable bh
    
    [ Upstream commit 43a43b6040165f7b40b5b489fe61a4cb7f8c4980 ]
    
    After commit c15b1ccadb323ea ("ipv6: move DAD and addrconf_verify
    processing to workqueue") some counters are now updated in process context
    and thus need to disable bh before doing so, otherwise deadlocks can
    happen on 32-bit archs. Fabio Estevam noticed this while while mounting
    a NFS volume on an ARM board.
    
    As a compensation for missing this I looked after the other *_STATS_BH
    and found three other calls which need updating:
    
    1) icmp6_send: ip6_fragment -> icmpv6_send -> icmp6_send (error handling)
    2) ip6_push_pending_frames: rawv6_sendmsg -> rawv6_push_pending_frames -> ...
       (only in case of icmp protocol with raw sockets in error handling)
    3) ping6_v6_sendmsg (error handling)

    xen-netback: remove pointless clause from if statement
    
    [ Upstream commit 0576eddf24df716d8570ef8ca11452a9f98eaab2 ]
    
    This patch removes a test in start_new_rx_buffer() that checks whether
    a copy operation is less than MAX_BUFFER_OFFSET in length, since
    MAX_BUFFER_OFFSET is defined to be PAGE_SIZE and the only caller of
    start_new_rx_buffer() already limits copy operations to PAGE_SIZE or less.

    vhost: fix total length when packets are too short
    
    [ Upstream commit d8316f3991d207fe32881a9ac20241be8fa2bad0 ]
    
    When mergeable buffers are disabled, and the
    incoming packet is too large for the rx buffer,
    get_rx_bufs returns success.
    
    This was intentional in order for make recvmsg
    truncate the packet and then handle_rx would
    detect err != sock_len and drop it.
    
    Unfortunately we pass the original sock_len to
    recvmsg - which means we use parts of iov not fully
    validated.
    
    Fix this up by detecting this overrun and doing packet drop
    immediately.

    vlan: Set hard_header_len according to available acceleration
    
    [ Upstream commit fc0d48b8fb449ca007b2057328abf736cb516168 ]
    
    Currently, if the card supports CTAG acceleration we do not
    account for the vlan header even if we are configuring an
    8021AD vlan.  This may not be best since we'll do software
    tagging for 8021AD which will cause data copy on skb head expansion
    Configure the length based on available hw offload capabilities and
    vlan protocol.

    usbnet: include wait queue head in device structure
    
    [ Upstream commit 14a0d635d18d0fb552dcc979d6d25106e6541f2e ]
    
    This fixes a race which happens by freeing an object on the stack.
    Quoting Julius:
    > The issue is
    > that it calls usbnet_terminate_urbs() before that, which temporarily
    > installs a waitqueue in dev->wait in order to be able to wait on the
    > tasklet to run and finish up some queues. The waiting itself looks

    > wake_up() call in usbnet_bh().
    
    The fix is to just not allocate the data structure on the stack.
    As dev->wait is abused as a flag it also takes a runtime PM change
    to fix this bug.

    Including hardware acceleration features in vlan_features breaks
    stacked vlans (Q-in-Q) by marking the bottom vlan interface as
    capable of acceleration.  This causes one of the tags to be lost

    The recursion occurs when subscr_terminate tries to grab the
    subscriber lock, which is already taken by subscr_conn_msg_event.
    We fix this by checking if the request to establish a new
    subscription was successful, and if not we initiate termination of
    the subscriber after we have released the subscriber lock.

    vxlan: fix nonfunctional neigh_reduce()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b29dba9c085a4fb79058fb1c45a2f6257ca3dfa ]
    
    The VXLAN neigh_reduce() code is completely non-functional since
    check-in. Specific errors:
    
    1) The original code drops all packets with a multicast destination address,
            even though neighbor solicitations are sent to the solicited-node
            address, a multicast address. The code after this check was never run.
    2) The neighbor table lookup used the IPv6 header destination, which is the
            solicited node address, rather than the target address from the
            neighbor solicitation. So neighbor lookups would always fail if it
            got this far. Also for L3MISSes.
    3) The code calls ndisc_send_na(), which does a send on the tunnel device.
            The context for neigh_reduce() is the transmit path, vxlan_xmit(),
            where the host or a bridge-attached neighbor is trying to transmit
            a neighbor solicitation. To respond to it, the tunnel endpoint needs
            to do a *receive* of the appropriate neighbor advertisement. Doing a
            send, would only try to send the advertisement, encapsulated, to the
            remote destinations in the fdb -- hosts that definitely did not do the
            corresponding solicitation.
    4) The code uses the tunnel endpoint IPv6 forwarding flag to determine the
            isrouter flag in the advertisement. This has nothing to do with whether
            or not the target is a router, and generally won't be set since the
            tunnel endpoint is bridging, not routing, traffic.
    
            The patch below creates a proxy neighbor advertisement to respond to
    neighbor solicitions as intended, providing proper IPv6 support for neighbor
    reduction.

    In ip6_append_data_mtu(), when the xfrm mode is not tunnel(such as
    transport),the ipsec header need to be added in the first fragment, so the mtu
    will decrease to reserve space for it, then the second fragment come, the mtu
    should be turn back, as the commit 0c1833797a5a6ec23ea9261d979aa18078720b74
    said.  however, in the commit a493e60ac4bbe2e977e7129d6d8cbb0dd236be, it use
    *mtu = min(*mtu, ...) to change the mtu, which lead to the new mtu is alway
    equal with the first fragment's. and cannot turn back.
    
    when I test through  ping6 -c1 -s5000 $ip (mtu=1280):
    ...frag (0|1232) ESP(spi=0x00002000,seq=0xb), length 1232
    ...frag (1232|1216)
    ...frag (2448|1216)
    ...frag (3664|1216)
    ...frag (4880|164)
    
    which should be:
    ...frag (0|1232) ESP(spi=0x00001000,seq=0x1), length 1232
    ...frag (1232|1232)
    ...frag (2464|1232)
    ...frag (3696|1232)
    ...frag (4928|116)
    
    so delete the min() when change back the mtu.

    ipv6: Avoid unnecessary temporary addresses being generated
    
    [ Upstream commit ecab67015ef6e3f3635551dcc9971cf363cc1cd5 ]
    
    tmp_prefered_lft is an offset to ifp->tstamp, not now. Therefore
    age needs to be added to the condition.
    
    Age calculation in ipv6_create_tempaddr is different from the one
    in addrconf_verify and doesn't consider ADDRCONF_TIMER_FUZZ_MINUS.
    This can cause age in ipv6_create_tempaddr to be less than the one
    in addrconf_verify and therefore unnecessary temporary address to
    be generated.
    Use age calculation as in addrconf_modify to avoid this.

    eth: fec: Fix lost promiscuous mode after reconnecting cable
    
    [ Upstream commit 84fe61821e4ebab6322eeae3f3c27f77f0031978 ]
    
    If the Freescale fec is in promiscuous mode and network cable is
    reconnected then the promiscuous mode get lost. The problem is caused
    by a too soon call of set_multicast_list to re-enable promisc mode.
    The FEC_R_CNTRL register changes are overwritten by fec_restart.
    
    This patch fixes this by moving the call behind the init of FEC_R_CNTRL
    register in fec_restart.

    bridge: multicast: enable snooping on general queries only
    
    [ Upstream commit 20a599bec95a52fa72432b2376a2ce47c5bb68fb ]
    
    Without this check someone could easily create a denial of service
    by injecting multicast-specific queries to enable the bridge
    snooping part if no real querier issuing periodic general queries
    is present on the link which would result in the bridge wrongly
    shutting down ports for multicast traffic as the bridge did not learn
    about these listeners.
    
    With this patch the snooping code is enabled upon receiving valid,
    general queries only.

    bridge: multicast: add sanity check for general query destination
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ed973cc40c588abeaa58aea0683ea665132d11d ]
    
    General IGMP and MLD queries are supposed to have the multicast
    link-local all-nodes address as their destination according to RFC2236
    section 9, RFC3376 section 4.1.12/9.1, RFC2710 section 8 and RFC3810
    section 5.1.15.
    
    Without this check, such malformed IGMP/MLD queries can result in a
    denial of service: The queries are ignored by most IGMP/MLD listeners
    therefore they will not respond with an IGMP/MLD report. However,
    without this patch these malformed MLD queries would enable the
    snooping part in the bridge code, potentially shutting down the
    according ports towards these hosts for multicast traffic as the
    bridge did not learn about these listeners.

    Lars trace involved a NIC without RX checksum support but other points
    are problematic as well, like the prequeue stuff.
    
    Problem is triggered by a timer, that found socket being owned by user.
    
    tcp_release_cb() should call tcp_write_timer_handler() or
    tcp_delack_timer_handler() in the appropriate context :
    
    BH disabled and socket lock held, but 'owned' field cleared,
    as if they were running from timer handlers.

    [ Upstream commit e588e2f286ed7da011ed357c24c5b9a554e26595 ]
    
    Quoting Alexander Aring:
      While fragmentation and unloading of 6lowpan module I got this kernel Oops
      after few seconds:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at f88bbc30
      [..]
      Modules linked in: ipv6 [last unloaded: 6lowpan]
      Call Trace:

       [<c012b66b>] run_timer_softirq+0x140/0x15f
    
    Problem is that incomplete frags are still around after unload; when
    their frag expire timer fires, we get crash.
    
    When a netns is removed (also done when unloading module), inet_frag
    calls the evictor with 'force' argument to purge remaining frags.
    
    The evictor loop terminates when accounted memory ('work') drops to 0
    or the lru-list becomes empty.  However, the mem accounting is done
    via percpu counters and may not be accurate, i.e. loop may terminate
    prematurely.
    
    Alter evictor to only stop once the lru list is empty when force is
    requested.

    tipc: fix memory leak during module removal
    
    [ Upstream commit 1bb8dce57f4d15233688c68990852a10eb1cd79f ]
    
    When the TIPC module is removed, the tasklet handler is disabled
    before all other subsystems. This will cause lingering publications
    in the name table because the node_down tasklets responsible to
    clean up publications from an unreachable node will never run.
    When the name table is shut down, these publications are detected
    and an error message is logged:
    tipc: nametbl_stop(): orphaned hash chain detected
    This is actually a memory leak, introduced with commit
    993b858e37b3120ee76d9957a901cca22312ffaa ("tipc: correct the order
    of stopping services at rmmod")
    
    Instead of just logging an error and leaking memory, we free
    the orphaned entries during nametable shutdown.

    tipc: drop subscriber connection id invalidation
    
    [ Upstream commit edcc0511b5ee7235282a688cd604e3ae7f9e1fc9 ]
    
    When a topology server subscriber is disconnected, the associated
    connection id is set to zero. A check vs zero is then done in the
    subscription timeout function to see if the subscriber have been
    shut down. This is unnecessary, because all subscription timers
    will be cancelled when a subscriber terminates. Setting the
    connection id to zero is actually harmful because id zero is the
    identity of the topology server listening socket, and can cause a
    race that leads to this socket being closed instead.

    tipc: fix connection refcount leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 4652edb70e8a7eebbe47fa931940f65522c36e8f ]
    
    When tipc_conn_sendmsg() calls tipc_conn_lookup() to query a
    connection instance, its reference count value is increased if
    it's found. But subsequently if it's found that the connection is
    closed, the work of sending message is not queued into its server
    send workqueue, and the connection reference count is not decreased.
    This will cause a reference count leak. To reproduce this problem,
    an application would need to open and closes topology server
    connections with high intensity.
    
    We fix this by immediately decrementing the connection reference
    count if a send fails due to the connection being closed.

    tipc: allow connection shutdown callback to be invoked in advance
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d4ebeb4df0176b1973875840a9f7e91394c0685 ]
    
    Currently connection shutdown callback function is called when
    connection instance is released in tipc_conn_kref_release(), and
    receiving packets and sending packets are running in different
    threads. Even if connection is closed by the thread of receiving
    packets, its shutdown callback may not be called immediately as
    the connection reference count is non-zero at that moment. So,
    although the connection is shut down by the thread of receiving
    packets, the thread of sending packets doesn't know it. Before
    its shutdown callback is invoked to tell the sending thread its
    connection has been closed, the sending thread may deliver
    messages by tipc_conn_sendmsg(), this is why the following error
    information appears:
    
    "Sending subscription event failed, no memory"
    
    To eliminate it, allow connection shutdown callback function to
    be called before connection id is removed in tipc_close_conn(),
    which makes the sending thread know the truth in time that its
    socket is closed so that it doesn't send message to it. We also
    remove the "Sending XXX failed..." error reporting for topology
    and config services.

    bridge: multicast: add sanity check for query source addresses
    
    [ Upstream commit 6565b9eeef194afbb3beec80d6dd2447f4091f8c ]
    
    MLD queries are supposed to have an IPv6 link-local source address
    according to RFC2710, section 4 and RFC3810, section 5.1.14. This patch
    adds a sanity check to ignore such broken MLD queries.
    
    Without this check, such malformed MLD queries can result in a
    denial of service: The queries are ignored by any MLD listener
    therefore they will not respond with an MLD report. However,
    without this patch these malformed MLD queries would enable the
    snooping part in the bridge code, potentially shutting down the
    according ports towards these hosts for multicast traffic as the
    bridge did not learn about these listeners.

    net: sctp: fix skb leakage in COOKIE ECHO path of chunk->auth_chunk
    
    [ Upstream commit c485658bae87faccd7aed540fd2ca3ab37992310 ]
    
    While working on ec0223ec48a9 ("net: sctp: fix sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce to

    memory leakage in the error path.
    
    Running the same reproducer as in ec0223ec48a9 and by unconditionally

    What happens is that commit bbd0d59809f9 clones the skb containing
    the AUTH chunk in sctp_endpoint_bh_rcv() when having the edge case
    that an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO chunks to be authenticated:
    
      ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
      <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
      ------------------ AUTH; COOKIE-ECHO ---------------->
      <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
    
    When we enter sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce() and before we actually get to
    the point where we process (and subsequently free) a non-NULL
    chunk->auth_chunk, we could hit the "goto nomem_init" path from
    an error condition and thus leave the cloned skb around w/o
    freeing it.
    
    The fix is to centrally free such clones in sctp_chunk_destroy()
    handler that is invoked from sctp_chunk_free() after all refs have
    dropped; and also move both kfree_skb(chunk->auth_chunk) there,
    so that chunk->auth_chunk is either NULL (since sctp_chunkify()
    allocs new chunks through kmem_cache_zalloc()) or non-NULL with
    a valid skb pointer. chunk->skb and chunk->auth_chunk are the
    only skbs in the sctp_chunk structure that need to be handeled.
    
    While at it, we should use consume_skb() for both. It is the same
    as dev_kfree_skb() but more appropriately named as we are not
    a device but a protocol. Also, this effectively replaces the
    kfree_skb() from both invocations into consume_skb(). Functions
    are the same only that kfree_skb() assumes that the frame was
    being dropped after a failure (e.g. for tools like drop monitor),
    usage of consume_skb() seems more appropriate in function
    sctp_chunk_destroy() though.

    net: fix for a race condition in the inet frag code
    
    [ Upstream commit 24b9bf43e93e0edd89072da51cf1fab95fc69dec ]
    
    I stumbled upon this very serious bug while hunting for another one,
    it's a very subtle race condition between inet_frag_evictor,
    inet_frag_intern and the IPv4/6 frag_queue and expire functions
    (basically the users of inet_frag_kill/inet_frag_put).
    
    What happens is that after a fragment has been added to the hash chain
    but before it's been added to the lru_list (inet_frag_lru_add) in
    inet_frag_intern, it may get deleted (either by an expired timer if
    the system load is high or the timer sufficiently low, or by the
    fraq_queue function for different reasons) before it's added to the
    lru_list, then after it gets added it's a matter of time for the
    evictor to get to a piece of memory which has been freed leading to a
    number of different bugs depending on what's left there.
    
    I've been able to trigger this on both IPv4 and IPv6 (which is normal
    as the frag code is the same), but it's been much more difficult to
    trigger on IPv4 due to the protocol differences about how fragments
    are treated.
    
    The setup I used to reproduce this is: 2 machines with 4 x 10G bonded
    in a RR bond, so the same flow can be seen on multiple cards at the
    same time. Then I used multiple instances of ping/ping6 to generate
    fragmented packets and flood the machines with them while running
    other processes to load the attacked machine.
    
    *It is very important to have the _same flow_ coming in on multiple CPUs
    concurrently. Usually the attacked machine would die in less than 30
    minutes, if configured properly to have many evictor calls and timeouts
    it could happen in 10 minutes or so.
    
    An important point to make is that any caller (frag_queue or timer) of
    inet_frag_kill will remove both the timer refcount and the
    original/guarding refcount thus removing everything that's keeping the
    frag from being freed at the next inet_frag_put.  All of this could
    happen before the frag was ever added to the LRU list, then it gets
    added and the evictor uses a freed fragment.
    
    An example for IPv6 would be if a fragment is being added and is at
    the stage of being inserted in the hash after the hash lock is
    released, but before inet_frag_lru_add executes (or is able to obtain
    the lru lock) another overlapping fragment for the same flow arrives
    at a different CPU which finds it in the hash, but since it's
    overlapping it drops it invoking inet_frag_kill and thus removing all
    guarding refcounts, and afterwards freeing it by invoking
    inet_frag_put which removes the last refcount added previously by
    inet_frag_find, then inet_frag_lru_add gets executed by
    inet_frag_intern and we have a freed fragment in the lru_list.
    
    The fix is simple, just move the lru_add under the hash chain locked
    region so when a removing function is called it'll have to wait for
    the fragment to be added to the lru_list, and then it'll remove it (it
    works because the hash chain removal is done before the lru_list one
    and there's no window between the two list adds when the frag can get
    dropped). With this fix applied I couldn't kill the same machine in 24
    hours with the same setup.

    rwlock")

    fb: reorder the lock sequence to fix potential dead lock

    drm: Prefer noninterlace cmdline mode unless explicitly specified
    
    commit c683f427bdc43525f61e26609d34e799e7ea4c12 upstream.
    
    Currently drm_pick_cmdline_mode() doesn't care about the interlace
    when the given mode line has no "i" suffix.  That is, when there are
    multiple entries for the same resolution, an interlace mode might be
    picked up just depending on the assigned order, and there is no way to
    exclude it.
    
    This patch changes the logic for the mode selection, to prefer the
    noninterlace mode unless the interlace mode is explicitly given.
    When no matching mode is found, it still tries the interlace mode as
    fallback.

    floppy: bail out in open() if drive is not responding to block0 read
    
    commit 7b7b68bba5ef23734c35ffb0d8d82079ed604d33 upstream.
    
    In case reading of block 0 during open() fails, it is not the right thing
    to let open() succeed.
    
    Fix this by introducing FD_OPEN_SHOULD_FAIL_BIT flag, and setting it in
    case the bio callback encounters an error while trying to read block 0.
    
    As a bonus, this works around certain broken userspace (blkid), which is
    not able to properly handle read()s returning IO errors. Hence be nice to
    those, and bail out during open() already; if block 0 is not readable,
    read()s are not going to provide any meaningful data anyway.

    ext4: Speedup WB_SYNC_ALL pass called from sync(2)
    
    commit 10542c229a4e8e25b40357beea66abe9dacda2c0 upstream.
    
    When doing filesystem wide sync, there's no need to force transaction
    commit (or synchronously write inode buffer) separately for each inode
    because ext4_sync_fs() takes care of forcing commit at the end (VFS
    takes care of flushing buffer cache, respectively). Most of the time
    this slowness doesn't manifest because previous WB_SYNC_NONE writeback
    doesn't leave much to write but when there are processes aggressively
    creating new files and several filesystems to sync, the sync slowness
    can be noticeable. In the following test script sync(1) takes around 6
    minutes when there are two ext4 filesystems mounted on a standard SATA
    drive. After this patch sync takes a couple of seconds so we have about
    two orders of magnitude improvement.
    
          function run_writers
          {
            for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )); do
              mkdir $1/dir$i
              for (( j = 0; j < 40000; j++ )); do

    to set the acl after the file has been created. If the operation

    selinux: correctly label /proc inodes in use before the policy is loaded
    
    commit f64410ec665479d7b4b77b7519e814253ed0f686 upstream.
    
    This patch is based on an earlier patch by Eric Paris, he describes
    the problem below:
    
      "If an inode is accessed before policy load it will get placed on a
       list of inodes to be initialized after policy load.  After policy
       load we call inode_doinit() which calls inode_doinit_with_dentry()
       on all inodes accessed before policy load.  In the case of inodes
       in procfs that means we'll end up at the bottom where it does:
    
         /* Default to the fs superblock SID. */
         isec->sid = sbsec->sid;
    
         if ((sbsec->flags & SE_SBPROC) && !S_ISLNK(inode->i_mode)) {
                 if (opt_dentry) {
                         isec->sclass = inode_mode_to_security_class(...)
                         rc = selinux_proc_get_sid(opt_dentry,
                                                   isec->sclass,
                                                   &sid);
                         if (rc)
                                 goto out_unlock;
                         isec->sid = sid;
                 }
         }
    
       Since opt_dentry is null, we'll never call selinux_proc_get_sid()
       and will leave the inode labeled with the label on the superblock.
       I believe a fix would be to mimic the behavior of xattrs.  Look
       for an alias of the inode.  If it can't be found, just leave the
       inode uninitialized (and pick it up later) if it can be found, we
       should be able to call selinux_proc_get_sid() ..."
    
    On a system exhibiting this problem, you will notice a lot of files in
    /proc with the generic "proc_t" type (at least the ones that were
    accessed early in the boot), for example:
    
       # ls -Z /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax | awk '{ print $4 " " $5 }'
       system_u:object_r:proc_t:s0 /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
    
    However, with this patch in place we see the expected result:
    
       # ls -Z /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax | awk '{ print $4 " " $5 }'
       system_u:object_r:sysctl_kernel_t:s0 /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

    PCI: mvebu: move clock enable before register access
    
    commit b42285f66f871a9898a0e79e2d74bc7e7a101995 upstream.
    
    The clock passed to PCI controller found on MVEBU SoCs may come from a
    clock gate. This requires the clock to be enabled before any registers
    are accessed. Therefore, move the clock enable before register iomap to
    ensure it is enabled.

    powernow-k6: reorder frequencies
    
    commit 22c73795b101597051924556dce019385a1e2fa0 upstream.
    
    This patch reorders reported frequencies from the highest to the lowest,
    just like in other frequency drivers.

    powernow-k6: correctly initialize default parameters
    
    commit d82b922a4acc1781d368aceac2f9da43b038cab2 upstream.
    
    The powernow-k6 driver used to read the initial multiplier from the
    powernow register. However, there is a problem with this:
    
    * If there was a frequency transition before, the multiplier read from the
      register corresponds to the current multiplier.
    * If there was no frequency transition since reset, the field in the
      register always reads as zero, regardless of the current multiplier that
      is set using switches on the mainboard and that the CPU is running at.
    
    The zero value corresponds to multiplier 4.5, so as a consequence, the
    powernow-k6 driver always assumes multiplier 4.5.
    
    For example, if we have 550MHz CPU with bus frequency 100MHz and
    multiplier 5.5, the powernow-k6 driver thinks that the multiplier is 4.5
    and bus frequency is 122MHz. The powernow-k6 driver then sets the
    multiplier to 4.5, underclocking the CPU to 450MHz, but reports the
    current frequency as 550MHz.
    
    There is no reliable way how to read the initial multiplier. I modified
    the driver so that it contains a table of known frequencies (based on
    parameters of existing CPUs and some common overclocking schemes) and sets
    the multiplier according to the frequency. If the frequency is unknown
    (because of unusual overclocking or underclocking), the user must supply
    the bus speed and maximum multiplier as module parameters.
    
    This patch should be backported to all stable kernels. If it doesn't
    apply cleanly, change it, or ask me to change it.

    powernow-k6: disable cache when changing frequency
    
    commit e20e1d0ac02308e2211306fc67abcd0b2668fb8b upstream.
    
    I found out that a system with k6-3+ processor is unstable during network
    server load. The system locks up or the network card stops receiving. The
    reason for the instability is the CPU frequency scaling.
    
    During frequency transition the processor is in "EPM Stop Grant" state.
    The documentation says that the processor doesn't respond to inquiry
    requests in this state. Consequently, coherency of processor caches and
    bus master devices is not maintained, causing the system instability.
    
    This patch flushes the cache during frequency transition. It fixes the
    instability.
    
    Other minor changes:
    * u64 invalue changed to unsigned long because the variable is 32-bit
    * move the logic to set the multiplier to a separate function
      powernow_k6_set_cpu_multiplier
    * preserve lower 5 bits of the powernow port instead of 4 (the voltage
      field has 5 bits)
    * mask interrupts when reading the multiplier, so that the port is not
      open during other activity (running other kernel code with the port open
      shouldn't cause any misbehavior, but we should better be safe and keep
      the port closed)
    
    This patch should be backported to all stable kernels. If it doesn't
    apply cleanly, change it, or ask me to change it.
