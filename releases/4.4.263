    genirq: Disable interrupts for force threaded handlers
    
    commit 81e2073c175b887398e5bca6c004efa89983f58d upstream.
    
    With interrupt force threading all device interrupt handlers are invoked
    from kernel threads. Contrary to hard interrupt context the invocation only
    disables bottom halfs, but not interrupts. This was an oversight back then
    because any code like this will have an issue:
    
    thread(irq_A)
      irq_handler(A)
        spin_lock(&foo->lock);
    
    interrupt(irq_B)
      irq_handler(B)
        spin_lock(&foo->lock);
    
    This has been triggered with networking (NAPI vs. hrtimers) and console
    drivers where printk() happens from an interrupt which interrupted the
    force threaded handler.
    
    Now people noticed and started to change the spin_lock() in the handler to
    spin_lock_irqsave() which affects performance or add IRQF_NOTHREAD to the
    interrupt request which in turn breaks RT.
    
    Fix the root cause and not the symptom and disable interrupts before
    invoking the force threaded handler which preserves the regular semantics
    and the usefulness of the interrupt force threading as a general debugging
    tool.
    
    For not RT this is not changing much, except that during the execution of
    the threaded handler interrupts are delayed until the handler
    returns. Vs. scheduling and softirq processing there is no difference.
    
    For RT kernels there is no issue.

    commit b7ff91fd030dc9d72ed91b1aab36e445a003af4f upstream.
    
    If we failed to add new entry on rename whiteout, we cannot reset the
    old->de entry directly, because the old->de could have moved from under
    us during make indexed dir. So find the old entry again before reset is
    needed, otherwise it may corrupt the filesystem as below.

    x86/ioapic: Ignore IRQ2 again
    
    commit a501b048a95b79e1e34f03cac3c87ff1e9f229ad upstream.
    
    Vitaly ran into an issue with hotplugging CPU0 on an Amazon instance where
    the matrix allocator claimed to be out of vectors. He analyzed it down to
    the point that IRQ2, the PIC cascade interrupt, which is supposed to be not
    ever routed to the IO/APIC ended up having an interrupt vector assigned
    which got moved during unplug of CPU0.
    
    The underlying issue is that IRQ2 for various reasons (see commit
    af174783b925 ("x86: I/O APIC: Never configure IRQ2" for details) is treated
    as a reserved system vector by the vector core code and is not accounted as
    a regular vector. The Amazon BIOS has an routing entry of pin2 to IRQ2
    which causes the IO/APIC setup to claim that interrupt which is granted by
    the vector domain because there is no sanity check. As a consequence the
    allocation counter of CPU0 underflows which causes a subsequent unplug to
    fail with:
    
      [ ... ] CPU 0 has 4294967295 vectors, 589 available. Cannot disable CPU
    
    There is another sanity check missing in the matrix allocator, but the
    underlying root cause is that the IO/APIC code lost the IRQ2 ignore logic
    during the conversion to irqdomains.
    
    For almost 6 years nobody complained about this wreckage, which might
    indicate that this requirement could be lifted, but for any system which
    actually has a PIC IRQ2 is unusable by design so any routing entry has no
    effect and the interrupt cannot be connected to a device anyway.
    
    Due to that and due to history biased paranoia reasons restore the IRQ2
    ignore logic and treat it as non existent despite a routing entry claiming
    otherwise.

    PCI: rpadlpar: Fix potential drc_name corruption in store functions
    
    commit cc7a0bb058b85ea03db87169c60c7cfdd5d34678 upstream.
    
    Both add_slot_store() and remove_slot_store() try to fix up the
    drc_name copied from the store buffer by placing a NUL terminator at
    nbyte + 1 or in place of a '\n' if present. However, the static buffer
    that we copy the drc_name data into is not zeroed and can contain
    anything past the n-th byte.
    
    This is problematic if a '\n' byte appears in that buffer after nbytes
    and the string copied into the store buffer was not NUL terminated to
    start with as the strchr() search for a '\n' byte will mark this
    incorrectly as the end of the drc_name string resulting in a drc_name
    string that contains garbage data after the n-th byte.
    
    Additionally it will cause us to overwrite that '\n' byte on the stack
    with NUL, potentially corrupting data on the stack.
    
    The following debugging shows an example of the drmgr utility writing
    "PHB 4543" to the add_slot sysfs attribute, but add_slot_store()
    logging a corrupted string value.
    
      drmgr: drmgr: -c phb -a -s PHB 4543 -d 1
      add_slot_store: drc_name = PHB 4543Â°|<82>!, rc = -19
    
    Fix this by using strscpy() instead of memcpy() to ensure the string
    is NUL terminated when copied into the static drc_name buffer.
    Further, since the string is now NUL terminated the code only needs to
    change '\n' to '\0' when present.

    usb: gadget: configfs: Fix KASAN use-after-free
    
    commit 98f153a10da403ddd5e9d98a3c8c2bb54bb5a0b6 upstream.

    . configfs_composite_bind
    
    In configfs_composite_bind, it has
    "cn->strings.s = cn->configuration;"
    
    When usb_string_copy is invoked. it would
    allocate memory, copy input string, release previous pointed memory space,
    and use new allocated memory.
    
    When gadget is connected, host sends down request to get information.
    Call trace:
      usb_gadget_get_string+0xec/0x168
      lookup_string+0x64/0x98
      composite_setup+0xa34/0x1ee8
    
    If gadget is disconnected and connected quickly, in the failed case,
    cn->configuration memory has been released by usb_string_copy kfree but
    configfs_composite_bind hasn't been run in time to assign new allocated
    "cn->configuration" pointer to "cn->strings.s".
    
    When "strlen(s->s) of usb_gadget_get_string is being executed, the dangling
    memory is accessed, "BUG: KASAN: use-after-free" error occurs.

    NFSD: Repair misuse of sv_lock in 5.10.16-rt30.
    
    commit c7de87ff9dac5f396f62d584f3908f80ddc0e07b upstream.
    
    [ This problem is in mainline, but only rt has the chops to be
    able to detect it. ]
    
    Lockdep reports a circular lock dependency between serv->sv_lock and
    softirq_ctl.lock on system shutdown, when using a kernel built with
    CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y, and a nfs mount exists.
    
    This is due to the definition of spin_lock_bh on rt:
    
            local_bh_disable();
            rt_spin_lock(lock);
    
    which forces a softirq_ctl.lock -> serv->sv_lock dependency.  This is
    not a problem as long as _every_ lock of serv->sv_lock is a:
    
            spin_lock_bh(&serv->sv_lock);
    
    but there is one of the form:
    
            spin_lock(&serv->sv_lock);
    
    This is what is causing the circular dependency splat.  The spin_lock()
    grabs the lock without first grabbing softirq_ctl.lock via local_bh_disable.
    If later on in the critical region,  someone does a local_bh_disable, we
    get a serv->sv_lock -> softirq_ctrl.lock dependency established.  Deadlock.
    
    Fix is to make serv->sv_lock be locked with spin_lock_bh everywhere, no
    exceptions.

    btrfs: fix race when cloning extent buffer during rewind of an old root
    
    commit dbcc7d57bffc0c8cac9dac11bec548597d59a6a5 upstream.
    
    While resolving backreferences, as part of a logical ino ioctl call or
    fiemap, we can end up hitting a BUG_ON() when replaying tree mod log
    operations of a root, triggering a stack trace like the following:

      1208                    switch (tm->op) {
      1209                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
      1210                            BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);
      1211                            fallthrough;
      1212                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_MOVING:
      1213                    case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE:
      1214                            btrfs_set_node_key(eb, &tm->key, tm->slot);
    
    Here's what happens to hit that BUG_ON():
    
    1) We have one tree mod log user (through fiemap or the logical ino ioctl),
       with a sequence number of 1, so we have fs_info->tree_mod_seq == 1;
    
    2) Another task is at ctree.c:balance_level() and we have eb X currently as
       the root of the tree, and we promote its single child, eb Y, as the new
       root.
    
       Then, at ctree.c:balance_level(), we call:
    
          tree_mod_log_insert_root(eb X, eb Y, 1);
    
    3) At tree_mod_log_insert_root() we create tree mod log elements for each
       slot of eb X, of operation type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING each
       with a ->logical pointing to ebX->start. These are placed in an array
       named tm_list.
       Lets assume there are N elements (N pointers in eb X);
    
    4) Then, still at tree_mod_log_insert_root(), we create a tree mod log
       element of operation type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, ->logical set to
       ebY->start, ->old_root.logical set to ebX->start, ->old_root.level set
       to the level of eb X and ->generation set to the generation of eb X;
    
    5) Then tree_mod_log_insert_root() calls tree_mod_log_free_eb() with
       tm_list as argument. After that, tree_mod_log_free_eb() calls
       __tree_mod_log_insert() for each member of tm_list in reverse order,
       from highest slot in eb X, slot N - 1, to slot 0 of eb X;
    
    6) __tree_mod_log_insert() sets the sequence number of each given tree mod
       log operation - it increments fs_info->tree_mod_seq and sets
       fs_info->tree_mod_seq as the sequence number of the given tree mod log
       operation.
    
       This means that for the tm_list created at tree_mod_log_insert_root(),
       the element corresponding to slot 0 of eb X has the highest sequence
       number (1 + N), and the element corresponding to the last slot has the
       lowest sequence number (2);
    
    7) Then, after inserting tm_list's elements into the tree mod log rbtree,
       the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE element is inserted, which gets the highest
       sequence number, which is N + 2;
    
    8) Back to ctree.c:balance_level(), we free eb X by calling
       btrfs_free_tree_block() on it. Because eb X was created in the current
       transaction, has no other references and writeback did not happen for
       it, we add it back to the free space cache/tree;
    
    9) Later some other task T allocates the metadata extent from eb X, since
       it is marked as free space in the space cache/tree, and uses it as a
       node for some other btree;
    
    10) The tree mod log user task calls btrfs_search_old_slot(), which calls
        get_old_root(), and finally that calls __tree_mod_log_oldest_root()
        with time_seq == 1 and eb_root == eb Y;
    
    11) First iteration of the while loop finds the tree mod log element with
        sequence number N + 2, for the logical address of eb Y and of type
        MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE;
    
    12) Because the operation type is MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE, we don't break out
        of the loop, and set root_logical to point to tm->old_root.logical
        which corresponds to the logical address of eb X;
    
    13) On the next iteration of the while loop, the call to
        tree_mod_log_search_oldest() returns the smallest tree mod log element
        for the logical address of eb X, which has a sequence number of 2, an
        operation type of MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING and corresponds to
        the old slot N - 1 of eb X (eb X had N items in it before being freed);
    
    14) We then break out of the while loop and return the tree mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (eb Y), and not the one for slot N - 1 of
        eb X, to get_old_root();
    
    15) At get_old_root(), we process the MOD_LOG_ROOT_REPLACE operation
        and set "logical" to the logical address of eb X, which was the old
        root. We then call tree_mod_log_search() passing it the logical
        address of eb X and time_seq == 1;
    
    16) Then before calling tree_mod_log_search(), task T adds a key to eb X,
        which results in adding a tree mod log operation of type
        MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD to the tree mod log - this is done at
        ctree.c:insert_ptr() - but after adding the tree mod log operation
        and before updating the number of items in eb X from 0 to 1...
    
    17) The task at get_old_root() calls tree_mod_log_search() and gets the
        tree mod log operation of type MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD just added by task T.
        Then it enters the following if branch:
    
        if (old_root && tm && tm->op != MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING) {
           (...)
        } (...)
    
        Calls read_tree_block() for eb X, which gets a reference on eb X but
        does not lock it - task T has it locked.
        Then it clones eb X while it has nritems set to 0 in its header, before
        task T sets nritems to 1 in eb X's header. From hereupon we use the
        clone of eb X which no other task has access to;
    
    18) Then we call __tree_mod_log_rewind(), passing it the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD
        mod log operation we just got from tree_mod_log_search() in the
        previous step and the cloned version of eb X;
    
    19) At __tree_mod_log_rewind(), we set the local variable "n" to the number
        of items set in eb X's clone, which is 0. Then we enter the while loop,
        and in its first iteration we process the MOD_LOG_KEY_ADD operation,
        which just decrements "n" from 0 to (u32)-1, since "n" is declared with
        a type of u32. At the end of this iteration we call rb_next() to find the
        next tree mod log operation for eb X, that gives us the mod log operation
        of type MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING, for slot 0, with a sequence
        number of N + 1 (steps 3 to 6);
    
    20) Then we go back to the top of the while loop and trigger the following
        BUG_ON():
    
            (...)
            switch (tm->op) {
            case MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
                     BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);
                     fallthrough;
            (...)
    
        Because "n" has a value of (u32)-1 (4294967295) and tm->slot is 0.
    
    Fix this by taking a read lock on the extent buffer before cloning it at
    ctree.c:get_old_root(). This should be done regardless of the extent
    buffer having been freed and reused, as a concurrent task might be
    modifying it (while holding a write lock on it).

    commit 5d749d0bbe811c10d9048cde6dfebc761713abfd upstream.
    
    Prevent memory scribble by checking that ioctl buffer size parameters
    are sane.
    Without this check, on 32 bits system, if .insize = 0xffffffff - 20 and
    .outsize the amount to scribble, we would overflow, allocate a small
    amounts and be able to write outside of the malloc'ed area.
    Adding a hard limit allows argument checking of the ioctl. With the
    current EC, it is expected .insize and .outsize to be at around 512 bytes
    or less.

    ext4: check journal inode extents more carefully
    
    commit ce9f24cccdc019229b70a5c15e2b09ad9c0ab5d1 upstream.
    
    Currently, system zones just track ranges of block, that are "important"
    fs metadata (bitmaps, group descriptors, journal blocks, etc.). This
    however complicates how extent tree (or indirect blocks) can be checked
    for inodes that actually track such metadata - currently the journal
    inode but arguably we should be treating quota files or resize inode
    similarly. We cannot run __ext4_ext_check() on such metadata inodes when
    loading their extents as that would immediately trigger the validity
    checks and so we just hack around that and special-case the journal
    inode. This however leads to a situation that a journal inode which has
    extent tree of depth at least one can have invalid extent tree that gets
    unnoticed until ext4_cache_extents() crashes.
    
    To overcome this limitation, track inode number each system zone belongs
    to (0 is used for zones not belonging to any inode). We can then verify
    inode number matches the expected one when verifying extent tree and
    thus avoid the false errors. With this there's no need to to
    special-case journal inode during extent tree checking anymore so remove
    it.

    ext4: don't allow overlapping system zones
    
    commit bf9a379d0980e7413d94cb18dac73db2bfc5f470 upstream.
    
    Currently, add_system_zone() just silently merges two added system zones
    that overlap. However the overlap should not happen and it generally
    suggests that some unrelated metadata overlap which indicates the fs is
    corrupted. We should have caught such problems earlier (e.g. in
    ext4_check_descriptors()) but add this check as another line of defense.
    In later patch we also use this for stricter checking of journal inode
    extent tree.
