    powerpc/booke64: set RI in default MSR
    
    commit 5266e58d6cd90ac85c187d673093ad9cb649e16d upstream.
    
    Set RI in the default kernel's MSR so that the architected way of
    detecting unrecoverable machine check interrupts has a chance to work.
    This is inline with the MSR setup of the rest of booke powerpc
    architectures configured here.

    powerpc/powernv/idle: Restore IAMR after idle
    
    commit a3f3072db6cad40895c585dce65e36aab997f042 upstream.
    
    Without restoring the IAMR after idle, execution prevention on POWER9
    with Radix MMU is overwritten and the kernel can freely execute
    userspace without faulting.
    
    This is necessary when returning from any stop state that modifies
    user state, as well as hypervisor state.
    
    To test how this fails without this patch, load the lkdtm driver and
    do the following:
    
      $ echo EXEC_USERSPACE > /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
    
    which won't fault, then boot the kernel with powersave=off, where it
    will fault. Applying this patch will fix this.

    drivers/virt/fsl_hypervisor.c: prevent integer overflow in ioctl
    
    commit 6a024330650e24556b8a18cc654ad00cfecf6c6c upstream.
    
    The "param.count" value is a u64 thatcomes from the user.  The code
    later in the function assumes that param.count is at least one and if
    it's not then it leads to an Oops when we dereference the ZERO_SIZE_PTR.
    
    Also the addition can have an integer overflow which would lead us to
    allocate a smaller "pages" array than required.  I can't immediately
    tell what the possible run times implications are, but it's safest to
    prevent the overflow.

    tipc: fix hanging clients using poll with EPOLLOUT flag
    
    [ Upstream commit ff946833b70e0c7f93de9a3f5b329b5ae2287b38 ]
    
    commit 517d7c79bdb398 ("tipc: fix hanging poll() for stream sockets")
    introduced a regression for clients using non-blocking sockets.
    After the commit, we send EPOLLOUT event to the client even in
    TIPC_CONNECTING state. This causes the subsequent send() to fail
    with ENOTCONN, as the socket is still not in TIPC_ESTABLISHED state.
    
    In this commit, we:
    - improve the fix for hanging poll() by replacing sk_data_ready()
      with sk_state_change() to wake up all clients.
    - revert the faulty updates introduced by commit 517d7c79bdb398
      ("tipc: fix hanging poll() for stream sockets").

    vrf: sit mtu should not be updated when vrf netdev is the link
    
    [ Upstream commit ff6ab32bd4e073976e4d8797b4d514a172cfe6cb ]
    
    VRF netdev mtu isn't typically set and have an mtu of 65536. When the
    link of a tunnel is set, the tunnel mtu is changed from 1480 to the link
    mtu minus tunnel header. In the case of VRF netdev is the link, then the
    tunnel mtu becomes 65516. So, fix it by not setting the tunnel mtu in
    this case.

    ipv4: Fix raw socket lookup for local traffic
    
    [ Upstream commit 19e4e768064a87b073a4b4c138b55db70e0cfb9f ]
    
    inet_iif should be used for the raw socket lookup. inet_iif considers
    rt_iif which handles the case of local traffic.
    
    As it stands, ping to a local address with the '-I <dev>' option fails
    ever since ping was changed to use SO_BINDTODEVICE instead of
    cmsg + IP_PKTINFO.
    
    IPv6 works fine.

    fib_rules: return 0 directly if an exactly same rule exists when NLM_F_EXCL not supplied
    
    [ Upstream commit e9919a24d3022f72bcadc407e73a6ef17093a849 ]
    
    With commit 153380ec4b9 ("fib_rules: Added NLM_F_EXCL support to
    fib_nl_newrule") we now able to check if a rule already exists. But this
    only works with iproute2. For other tools like libnl, NetworkManager,
    it still could add duplicate rules with only NLM_F_CREATE flag, like
    
    [localhost ~ ]# ip rule
    0:      from all lookup local
    32766:  from all lookup main
    32767:  from all lookup default
    100000: from 192.168.7.5 lookup 5
    100000: from 192.168.7.5 lookup 5
    
    As it doesn't make sense to create two duplicate rules, let's just return
    0 if the rule exists.

    bridge: Fix error path for kobject_init_and_add()
    
    [ Upstream commit bdfad5aec1392b93495b77b864d58d7f101dc1c1 ]
    
    Currently error return from kobject_init_and_add() is not followed by a
    call to kobject_put().  This means there is a memory leak.  We currently
    set p to NULL so that kfree() may be called on it as a noop, the code is
    arguably clearer if we move the kfree() up closer to where it is
    called (instead of after goto jump).
    
    Remove a goto label 'err1' and jump to call to kobject_put() in error
    return from kobject_init_and_add() fixing the memory leak.  Re-name goto
    label 'put_back' to 'err1' now that we don't use err1, following current
    nomenclature (err1, err2 ...).  Move call to kfree out of the error
    code at bottom of function up to closer to where memory was allocated.
    Add comment to clarify call to kfree().

    bonding: fix arp_validate toggling in active-backup mode
    
    [ Upstream commit a9b8a2b39ce65df45687cf9ef648885c2a99fe75 ]
    
    There's currently a problem with toggling arp_validate on and off with an
    active-backup bond. At the moment, you can start up a bond, like so:
    
    modprobe bonding mode=1 arp_interval=100 arp_validate=0 arp_ip_targets=192.168.1.1
    ip link set bond0 down
    echo "ens4f0" > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
    echo "ens4f1" > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
    ip link set bond0 up
    ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev bond0
    
    Pings to 192.168.1.1 work just fine. Now turn on arp_validate:
    
    echo 1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/arp_validate
    
    Pings to 192.168.1.1 continue to work just fine. Now when you go to turn
    arp_validate off again, the link falls flat on it's face:
    
    echo 0 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/arp_validate
    dmesg
    ...
    [133191.911987] bond0: Setting arp_validate to none (0)
    [133194.257793] bond0: bond_should_notify_peers: slave ens4f0
    [133194.258031] bond0: link status definitely down for interface ens4f0, disabling it
    [133194.259000] bond0: making interface ens4f1 the new active one
    [133197.330130] bond0: link status definitely down for interface ens4f1, disabling it
    [133197.331191] bond0: now running without any active interface!
    
    The problem lies in bond_options.c, where passing in arp_validate=0
    results in bond->recv_probe getting set to NULL. This flies directly in
    the face of commit 3fe68df97c7f, which says we need to set recv_probe =
    bond_arp_recv, even if we're not using arp_validate. Said commit fixed
    this in bond_option_arp_interval_set, but missed that we can get to that
    same state in bond_option_arp_validate_set as well.
    
    One solution would be to universally set recv_probe = bond_arp_recv here
    as well, but I don't think bond_option_arp_validate_set has any business
    touching recv_probe at all, and that should be left to the arp_interval
    code, so we can just make things much tidier here.

    powerpc/64s: Include cpu header
    
    commit 42e2acde1237878462b028f5a27d9cc5bea7502c upstream.
    
    Current powerpc security.c file is defining functions, as
    cpu_show_meltdown(), cpu_show_spectre_v{1,2} and others, that are being
    declared at linux/cpu.h header without including the header file that
    contains these declarations.
    
    This is being reported by sparse, which thinks that these functions are
    static, due to the lack of declaration:
    
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:105:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_meltdown' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:139:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spectre_v1' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:161:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spectre_v2' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:209:6: warning: symbol 'stf_barrier' was not declared. Should it be static?
            arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c:289:9: warning: symbol 'cpu_show_spec_store_bypass' was not declared. Should it be static?
    
    This patch simply includes the proper header (linux/cpu.h) to match
    function definition and declaration.

    Don't jump to compute_result state from check_result state
    
    commit 4f4fd7c5798bbdd5a03a60f6269cf1177fbd11ef upstream.
    
    Changing state from check_state_check_result to
    check_state_compute_result not only is unsafe but also doesn't
    appear to serve a valid purpose.  A raid6 check should only be
    pushing out extra writes if doing repair and a mis-match occurs.
    The stripe dev management will already try and do repair writes
    for failing sectors.
    
    This patch makes the raid6 check_state_check_result handling
    work more like raid5's.  If somehow too many failures for a
    check, just quit the check operation for the stripe.  When any
    checks pass, don't try and use check_state_compute_result for
    a purpose it isn't needed for and is unsafe for.  Just mark the
    stripe as in sync for passing its parity checks and let the
    stripe dev read/write code and the bad blocks list do their
    job handling I/O errors.
    
    Repro steps from Xiao:
    
    These are the steps to reproduce this problem:
    1. redefined OPT_MEDIUM_ERR_ADDR to 12000 in scsi_debug.c
    2. insmod scsi_debug.ko dev_size_mb=11000  max_luns=1 num_tgts=1
    3. mdadm --create /dev/md127 --level=6 --raid-devices=5 /dev/sde1 /dev/sde2 /dev/sde3 /dev/sde5 /dev/sde6
    sde is the disk created by scsi_debug
    4. echo "2" >/sys/module/scsi_debug/parameters/opts
    5. raid-check
    
    It panic:

    as the rate_idx is in this case erroneously set to 251 (0xfb). This fix
    simply converts previously used magic number to proper constant and
    guards against substraction which is leading to the currently observed
    underflow.

    x86/kprobes: Avoid kretprobe recursion bug
    
    [ Upstream commit b191fa96ea6dc00d331dcc28c1f7db5e075693a0 ]
    
    Avoid kretprobe recursion loop bg by setting a dummy
    kprobes to current_kprobe per-CPU variable.
    
    This bug has been introduced with the asm-coded trampoline
    code, since previously it used another kprobe for hooking
    the function return placeholder (which only has a nop) and
    trampoline handler was called from that kprobe.
    
    This revives the old lost kprobe again.
    
    With this fix, we don't see deadlock anymore.
    
    And you can see that all inner-called kretprobe are skipped.
    
      event_1                                  235               0
      event_2                                19375           19612
    
    The 1st column is recorded count and the 2nd is missed count.
    Above shows (event_1 rec) + (event_2 rec) ~= (event_2 missed)
    (some difference are here because the counter is racy)

    nfc: nci: Potential off by one in ->pipes[] array
    
    [ Upstream commit 6491d698396fd5da4941980a35ca7c162a672016 ]
    
    This is similar to commit e285d5bfb7e9 ("NFC: Fix the number of pipes")
    where we changed NFC_HCI_MAX_PIPES from 127 to 128.
    
    As the comment next to the define explains, the pipe identifier is 7
    bits long.  The highest possible pipe is 127, but the number of possible
    pipes is 128.  As the code is now, then there is potential for an
    out of bounds array access:

    corruption when handling SHDLC I-Frame commands").
    
    I'm not totally sure, but I think that commit description may have
    overstated the danger.  I was under the impression that this data came
    from the firmware?  If you can't trust your networking firmware, then
    you're already in trouble.
    
    Anyway, these days we add bounds checking where ever we can and we call
    it kernel hardening.  Better safe than sorry.

    This WARNING occurred because of calling phy_stop before phy_start.
    
    The root cause of the problem in commit '308c6cafde01' is:
    
    Reference to hns_nic_init_phy, the flag phydev->supported is changed after
    phy_connect_direct. The flag phydev->supported is 0x6ff when hns modules is
    loaded, so will not change Fiber Port power(Reference to marvell.c), which
    is power on at default.
    Then the flag phydev->supported is changed to 0x6f, so Fiber Port power is
    off when removing hns modules.
    When hns modules installed again, the flag phydev->supported is default
    value 0x6ff, so will not change Fiber Port power(now is off), causing mac
    link not up problem.
    
    So the solution is change phy flags before phy_connect_direct.

    x86/fpu: Don't export __kernel_fpu_{begin,end}()
    
    [ Upstream commit 12209993e98c5fa1855c467f22a24e3d5b8be205 ]
    
    There is one user of __kernel_fpu_begin() and before invoking it,
    it invokes preempt_disable(). So it could invoke kernel_fpu_begin()
    right away. The 32bit version of arch_efi_call_virt_setup() and
    arch_efi_call_virt_teardown() does this already.
    
    The comment above *kernel_fpu*() claims that before invoking
    __kernel_fpu_begin() preemption should be disabled and that KVM is a
    good example of doing it. Well, KVM doesn't do that since commit
    
      f775b13eedee2 ("x86,kvm: move qemu/guest FPU switching out to vcpu_run")
    
    so it is not an example anymore.
    
    With EFI gone as the last user of __kernel_fpu_{begin|end}(), both can
    be made static and not exported anymore.

    Such things need to be done in ->deactivate.
    As a transaction can fail, we need to make sure we can undo such
    operations, therefore ->activate() has to be provided too.
    
    So print a warning and refuse registration if expr->ops provides

    ACPICA: Namespace: remove address node from global list after method termination
    
    [ Upstream commit c5781ffbbd4f742a58263458145fe7f0ac01d9e0 ]
    
    ACPICA commit b233720031a480abd438f2e9c643080929d144c3
    
    ASL operation_regions declare a range of addresses that it uses. In a
    perfect world, the range of addresses should be used exclusively by
    the AML interpreter. The OS can use this information to decide which
    drivers to load so that the AML interpreter and device drivers use
    different regions of memory.
    
    During table load, the address information is added to a global
    address range list. Each node in this list contains an address range
    as well as a namespace node of the operation_region. This list is
    deleted at ACPI shutdown.
    
    Unfortunately, ASL operation_regions can be declared inside of control
    methods. Although this is not recommended, modern firmware contains
    such code. New module level code changes unintentionally removed the
    functionality of adding and removing nodes to the global address
    range list.
    
    A few months ago, support for adding addresses has been re-
    implemented. However, the removal of the address range list was
    missed and resulted in some systems to crash due to the address list
    containing bogus namespace nodes from operation_regions declared in
    control methods. In order to fix the crash, this change removes
    dynamic operation_regions after control method termination.

    Similarly to commit a7603ac1fc8c ("geneve: change NET_UDP_TUNNEL
    dependency to select"), GTP has a dependency on NET_UDP_TUNNEL which
    makes impossible to compile it if no other protocol depending on
    NET_UDP_TUNNEL is selected.
    
    Fix this by changing the depends to a select, and drop NET_IP_TUNNEL from
    the select list, as it already depends on NET_UDP_TUNNEL.

    just completely remove the exts part to fix this leak.

    released if not used by 'r' on success path.

    devres: Align data[] to ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN
    
    [ Upstream commit a66d972465d15b1d89281258805eb8b47d66bd36 ]
    
    Initially we bumped into problem with 32-bit aligned atomic64_t
    on ARC, see [1]. And then during quite lengthly discussion Peter Z.
    mentioned ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN which IMHO makes perfect sense.
    If allocation is done by plain kmalloc() obtained buffer will be
    ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN aligned and then why buffer obtained via
    devm_kmalloc() should have any other alignment?
    
    This way we at least get the same behavior for both types of
    allocation.

    arm64: KVM: Make VHE Stage-2 TLB invalidation operations non-interruptible
    
    [ Upstream commit c987876a80e7bcb98a839f10dca9ce7fda4feced ]
    
    Contrary to the non-VHE version of the TLB invalidation helpers, the VHE
    code  has interrupts enabled, meaning that we can take an interrupt in
    the middle of such a sequence, and start running something else with
    HCR_EL2.TGE cleared.
    
    That's really not a good idea.
    
    Take the heavy-handed option and disable interrupts in
    __tlb_switch_to_guest_vhe, restoring them in __tlb_switch_to_host_vhe.
    The latter also gain an ISB in order to make sure that TGE really has
    taken effect.

    Commit
    
      379d98ddf413 ("x86: vdso: Use $LD instead of $CC to link")
    
    accidentally broke unwinding from userspace, because ld would strip the
    .eh_frame sections when linking.
    
    Originally, the compiler would implicitly add --eh-frame-hdr when
    invoking the linker, but when this Makefile was converted from invoking
    ld via the compiler, to invoking it directly (like vmlinux does),
    the flag was missed. (The EH_FRAME section is important for the VDSO
    shared libraries, but not for vmlinux.)
    
    Fix the problem by explicitly specifying --eh-frame-hdr, which restores
    parity with the old method.

    Btrfs: fix missing delayed iputs on unmount
    
    [ Upstream commit d6fd0ae25c6495674dc5a41a8d16bc8e0073276d ]
    
    There's a race between close_ctree() and cleaner_kthread().
    close_ctree() sets btrfs_fs_closing(), and the cleaner stops when it
    sees it set, but this is racy; the cleaner might have already checked
    the bit and could be cleaning stuff. In particular, if it deletes unused
    block groups, it will create delayed iputs for the free space cache
    inodes. As of "btrfs: don't run delayed_iputs in commit", we're no
    longer running delayed iputs after a commit. Therefore, if the cleaner
    creates more delayed iputs after delayed iputs are run in
    btrfs_commit_super(), we will leak inodes on unmount and get a busy
    inode crash from the VFS.
    
    Fix it by parking the cleaner before we actually close anything. Then,
    any remaining delayed iputs will always be handled in
    btrfs_commit_super(). This also ensures that the commit in close_ctree()
    is really the last commit, so we can get rid of the commit in
    cleaner_kthread().
    
    The fstest/generic/475 followed by 476 can trigger a crash that
    manifests as a slab corruption caused by accessing the freed kthread
    structure by a wake up function. Sample trace:

    net: stmmac: Move debugfs init/exit to ->probe()/->remove()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f2b8b62786853341a20d4cd4948f9cbca3db002 ]
    
    Setting up and tearing down debugfs is current unbalanced, as seen by
    this error during resume from suspend:
    
        [  752.134067] dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: ERROR failed to create debugfs directory
        [  752.134347] dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: stmmac_hw_setup: failed debugFS registration
    
    The imbalance happens because the driver creates the debugfs hierarchy
    when the device is opened and tears it down when the device is closed.
    There's little gain in that, and it could be argued that it is even
    surprising because it's not usually done for other devices. Fix the
    imbalance by moving the debugfs creation and teardown to the driver's
    ->probe() and ->remove() implementations instead.
    
    Note that the ring descriptors cannot be read while the interface is
    down, so make sure to return an empty file when the descriptors_status
    debugfs file is read.

    tracing/fgraph: Fix set_graph_function from showing interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit 5cf99a0f3161bc3ae2391269d134d6bf7e26f00e ]
    
    The tracefs file set_graph_function is used to only function graph functions
    that are listed in that file (or all functions if the file is empty). The
    way this is implemented is that the function graph tracer looks at every
    function, and if the current depth is zero and the function matches
    something in the file then it will trace that function. When other functions
    are called, the depth will be greater than zero (because the original
    function will be at depth zero), and all functions will be traced where the
    depth is greater than zero.
    
    The issue is that when a function is first entered, and the handler that
    checks this logic is called, the depth is set to zero. If an interrupt comes
    in and a function in the interrupt handler is traced, its depth will be
    greater than zero and it will automatically be traced, even if the original
    function was not. But because the logic only looks at depth it may trace
    interrupts when it should not be.
    
    The recent design change of the function graph tracer to fix other bugs
    caused the depth to be zero while the function graph callback handler is
    being called for a longer time, widening the race of this happening. This
    bug was actually there for a longer time, but because the race window was so
    small it seldom happened. The Fixes tag below is for the commit that widen
    the race window, because that commit belongs to a series that will also help
    fix the original bug.

    net: don't keep lonely packets forever in the gro hash
    
    [ Upstream commit 605108acfe6233b72e2f803aa1cb59a2af3001ca ]
    
    Eric noted that with UDP GRO and NAPI timeout, we could keep a single
    UDP packet inside the GRO hash forever, if the related NAPI instance
    calls napi_gro_complete() at an higher frequency than the NAPI timeout.
    Willem noted that even TCP packets could be trapped there, till the
    next retransmission.
    This patch tries to address the issue, flushing the old packets -
    those with a NAPI_GRO_CB age before the current jiffy - before scheduling
    the NAPI timeout. The rationale is that such a timeout should be
    well below a jiffy and we are not flushing packets eligible for sane GRO.
    
    v1  -> v2:
     - clarified the commit message and comment
    
    RFC -> v1:
     - added 'Fixes tags', cleaned-up the wording.

    drm/i915: Disable LP3 watermarks on all SNB machines
    
    [ Upstream commit 03981c6ebec4fc7056b9b45f847393aeac90d060 ]
    
    I have a Thinkpad X220 Tablet in my hands that is losing vblank
    interrupts whenever LP3 watermarks are used.
    
    If I nudge the latency value written to the WM3 register just
    by one in either direction the problem disappears. That to me
    suggests that the punit will not enter the corrsponding
    powersave mode (MPLL shutdown IIRC) unless the latency value
    in the register matches exactly what we read from SSKPD. Ie.
    it's not really a latency value but rather just a cookie
    by which the punit can identify the desired power saving state.
    On HSW/BDW this was changed such that we actually just write
    the WM level number into those bits, which makes much more
    sense given the observed behaviour.
    
    We could try to handle this by disallowing LP3 watermarks
    only when vblank interrupts are enabled but we'd first have
    to prove that only vblank interrupts are affected, which
    seems unlikely. Also we can't grab the wm mutex from the
    vblank enable/disable hooks because those are called with
    various spinlocks held. Thus we'd have to redesigne the
    watermark locking. So to play it safe and keep the code
    simple we simply disable LP3 watermarks on all SNB machines.
    
    To do that we simply zero out the latency values for
    watermark level 3, and we adjust the watermark computation
    to check for that. The behaviour now matches that of the
    g4x/vlv/skl wm code in the presence of a zeroed latency
    value.

    fuse: fix possibly missed wake-up after abort
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d84a2d19b6150c6dbac1e6ebad9c82e4c123772 ]
    
    In current fuse_drop_waiting() implementation it's possible that
    fuse_wait_aborted() will not be woken up in the unlikely case that
    fuse_abort_conn() + fuse_wait_aborted() runs in between checking
    fc->connected and calling atomic_dec(&fc->num_waiting).
    
    Do the atomic_dec_and_test() unconditionally, which also provides the
    necessary barrier against reordering with the fc->connected check.
    
    The explicit smp_mb() in fuse_wait_aborted() is not actually needed, since
    the spin_unlock() in fuse_abort_conn() provides the necessary RELEASE
    barrier after resetting fc->connected.  However, this is not a performance
    sensitive path, and adding the explicit barrier makes it easier to
    document.

    IB/rxe: Revise the ib_wr_opcode enum
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a59739bd01f77db6fbe2955a4fce165f0f43568 ]
    
    This enum has become part of the uABI, as both RXE and the
    ib_uverbs_post_send() command expect userspace to supply values from this
    enum. So it should be properly placed in include/uapi/rdma.
    
    In userspace this enum is called 'enum ibv_wr_opcode' as part of
    libibverbs.h. That enum defines different values for IB_WR_LOCAL_INV,
    IB_WR_SEND_WITH_INV, and IB_WR_LSO. These were introduced (incorrectly, it
    turns out) into libiberbs in 2015.
    
    The kernel has changed its mind on the numbering for several of the IB_WC
    values over the years, but has remained stable on IB_WR_LOCAL_INV and
    below.
    
    Based on this we can conclude that there is no real user space user of the
    values beyond IB_WR_ATOMIC_FETCH_AND_ADD, as they have never worked via
    rdma-core. This is confirmed by inspection, only rxe uses the kernel enum
    and implements the latter operations. rxe has clearly never worked with
    these attributes from userspace. Other drivers that support these opcodes
    implement the functionality without calling out to the kernel.
    
    To make IB_WR_SEND_WITH_INV and related work for RXE in userspace we
    choose to renumber the IB_WR enum in the kernel to match the uABI that
    userspace has bee using since before Soft RoCE was merged. This is an
    overall simpler configuration for the whole software stack, and obviously
    can't break anything existing.

    The table load process omitted adding the operation region address

    queries the global list to check for address range conflicts before

    However, these messages do not signify regressions. It is a result of

    surrounded by mmaped areas, then stack expanding fails and causes a
    segmentation fault. Therefore, VDSO_RANDOMIZE_SIZE should be less than
    MIN_GAP and this patch reduce it to 64MB.

    Right now if we get a corrupted user stack frame we do a

    If under a debugger, this behavior causes the inferior process to

    Instead, conditionally log a rate limited kernel log message and then

    MIPS: perf: ath79: Fix perfcount IRQ assignment
    
    [ Upstream commit a1e8783db8e0d58891681bc1e6d9ada66eae8e20 ]
    
    Currently it's not possible to use perf on ath79 due to genirq flags
    mismatch happening on static virtual IRQ 13 which is used for
    performance counters hardware IRQ 5.
    
    On TP-Link Archer C7v5:
    
               CPU0
      2:          0      MIPS   2  ath9k

     14:          0  gpio-ath79   5  keys
     15:         31  AR724X PCI    1  ath10k_pci
    
     $ perf top
     genirq: Flags mismatch irq 13. 00014c83 (mips_perf_pmu) vs. 00002003 (keys)
    
    On TP-Link Archer C7v4:
    
             CPU0
      4:          0      MIPS   4  19000000.eth
      5:       7135      MIPS   5  1a000000.eth
      7:      98379      MIPS   7  timer
      8:         30      MISC   3  ttyS0
     12:      90028      INTC   0  ath9k
     13:       5520      INTC   1  ehci_hcd:usb1
     14:       4623      INTC   2  ehci_hcd:usb2

     $ perf top
     genirq: Flags mismatch irq 13. 00014c80 (mips_perf_pmu) vs. 00000080 (ehci_hcd:usb1)
    
    This problem is happening, because currently statically assigned virtual
    IRQ 13 for performance counters is not claimed during the initialization
    of MIPS PMU during the bootup, so the IRQ subsystem doesn't know, that
    this interrupt isn't available for further use.
    
    So this patch fixes the issue by simply booking hardware IRQ 5 for MIPS PMU.

    selftests: netfilter: check icmp pkttoobig errors are set as related
    
    [ Upstream commit becf2319f320cae43e20cf179cc51a355a0deb5f ]
    
    When an icmp error such as pkttoobig is received, conntrack checks
    if the "inner" header (header of packet that did not fit link mtu)
    is matches an existing connection, and, if so, sets that packet as
    being related to the conntrack entry it found.
    
    It was recently reported that this "related" setting also works
    if the inner header is from another, different connection (i.e.,
    artificial/forged icmp error).
    
    Add a test, followup patch will add additional "inner dst matches
    outer dst in reverse direction" check before setting related state.

    mm: fix inactive list balancing between NUMA nodes and cgroups
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b991208b897f52507168374033771a984b947b1 ]
    
    During !CONFIG_CGROUP reclaim, we expand the inactive list size if it's
    thrashing on the node that is about to be reclaimed.  But when cgroups
    are enabled, we suddenly ignore the node scope and use the cgroup scope
    only.  The result is that pressure bleeds between NUMA nodes depending
    on whether cgroups are merely compiled into Linux.  This behavioral
    difference is unexpected and undesirable.
    
    When the refault adaptivity of the inactive list was first introduced,
    there were no statistics at the lruvec level - the intersection of node
    and memcg - so it was better than nothing.
    
    But now that we have that infrastructure, use lruvec_page_state() to
    make the list balancing decision always NUMA aware.

    tools lib traceevent: Fix missing equality check for strcmp
    
    [ Upstream commit f32c2877bcb068a718bb70094cd59ccc29d4d082 ]
    
    There was a missing comparison with 0 when checking if type is "s64" or
    "u64". Therefore, the body of the if-statement was entered if "type" was
    "u64" or not "s64", which made the first strcmp() redundant since if
    type is "u64", it's not "s64".
    
    If type is "s64", the body of the if-statement is not entered but since
    the remainder of the function consists of if-statements which will not
    be entered if type is "s64", we will just return "val", which is
    correct, albeit at the cost of a few more calls to strcmp(), i.e., it
    will behave just as if the if-statement was entered.
    
    If type is neither "s64" or "u64", the body of the if-statement will be
    entered incorrectly and "val" returned. This means that any type that is
    checked after "s64" and "u64" is handled the same way as "s64" and
    "u64", i.e., the limiting of "val" to fit in for example "s8" is never
    reached.
    
    This was introduced in the kernel tree when the sources were copied from
    trace-cmd in commit f7d82350e597 ("tools/events: Add files to create
    libtraceevent.a"), and in the trace-cmd repo in 1cdbae6035cei
    ("Implement typecasting in parser") when the function was introduced,
    i.e., it has always behaved the wrong way.

    KVM: x86: avoid misreporting level-triggered irqs as edge-triggered in tracing
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a223e06b1a411cef6c4cd7a9b9a33c8d225b10e ]
    
    In __apic_accept_irq() interface trig_mode is int and actually on some code
    paths it is set above u8:
    
    kvm_apic_set_irq() extracts it from 'struct kvm_lapic_irq' where trig_mode
    is u16. This is done on purpose as e.g. kvm_set_msi_irq() sets it to
    (1 << 15) & e->msi.data
    
    kvm_apic_local_deliver sets it to reg & (1 << 15).
    
    Fix the immediate issue by making 'tm' into u16. We may also want to adjust
    __apic_accept_irq() interface and use proper sizes for vector, level,
    trig_mode but this is not urgent.

    x86/reboot, efi: Use EFI reboot for Acer TravelMate X514-51T
    
    [ Upstream commit 0082517fa4bce073e7cf542633439f26538a14cc ]
    
    Upon reboot, the Acer TravelMate X514-51T laptop appears to complete the
    shutdown process, but then it hangs in BIOS POST with a black screen.
    
    The problem is intermittent - at some points it has appeared related to
    Secure Boot settings or different kernel builds, but ultimately we have
    not been able to identify the exact conditions that trigger the issue to
    come and go.
    
    Besides, the EFI mode cannot be disabled in the BIOS of this model.
    
    However, after extensive testing, we observe that using the EFI reboot
    method reliably avoids the issue in all cases.
    
    So add a boot time quirk to use EFI reboot on such systems.

    s390/pkey: add one more argument space for debug feature entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b1f16ba730d4c0cda1247568c3a1bf4fa3a2f2f ]
    
    The debug feature entries have been used with up to 5 arguents
    (including the pointer to the format string) but there was only
    space reserved for 4 arguemnts. So now the registration does
    reserve space for 5 times a long value.
    
    This fixes a sometime appearing weired value as the last
    value of an debug feature entry like this:

    s390/3270: fix lockdep false positive on view->lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 5712f3301a12c0c3de9cc423484496b0464f2faf ]
    
    The spinlock in the raw3270_view structure is used by con3270, tty3270
    and fs3270 in different ways. For con3270 the lock can be acquired in
    irq context, for tty3270 and fs3270 the highest context is bh.
    
    Lockdep sees the view->lock as a single class and if the 3270 driver
    is used for the console the following message is generated:
    
    WARNING: inconsistent lock state

    s390/dasd: Fix capacity calculation for large volumes
    
    [ Upstream commit 2cc9637ce825f3a9f51f8f78af7474e9e85bfa5f ]
    
    The DASD driver incorrectly limits the maximum number of blocks of ECKD
    DASD volumes to 32 bit numbers. Volumes with a capacity greater than
    2^32-1 blocks are incorrectly recognized as smaller volumes.
    
    This results in the following volume capacity limits depending on the
    formatted block size:
    
      BLKSIZE  MAX_GB   MAX_CYL
          512    2047   5843492
         1024    4095   8676701
         2048    8191  13634816
         4096   16383  23860929
    
    The same problem occurs when a volume with more than 17895697 cylinders
    is accessed in raw-track-access mode.
    
    Fix this problem by adding an explicit type cast when calculating the
    maximum number of blocks.

    USB: serial: fix unthrottle races
    
    commit 3f5edd58d040bfa4b74fb89bc02f0bc6b9cd06ab upstream.
    
    Fix two long-standing bugs which could potentially lead to memory
    corruption or leave the port throttled until it is reopened (on weakly
    ordered systems), respectively, when read-URB completion races with
    unthrottle().
    
    First, the URB must not be marked as free before processing is complete
    to prevent it from being submitted by unthrottle() on another CPU.
    
            CPU 1                           CPU 2
            ================                ================
            complete()                      unthrottle()
              process_urb();
              smp_mb__before_atomic();
              set_bit(i, free);               if (test_and_clear_bit(i, free))
                                                      submit_urb();
    
    Second, the URB must be marked as free before checking the throttled
    flag to prevent unthrottle() on another CPU from failing to observe that
    the URB needs to be submitted if complete() sees that the throttled flag
    is set.
    
            CPU 1                           CPU 2
            ================                ================
            complete()                      unthrottle()
              set_bit(i, free);               throttled = 0;

    Note that test_and_clear_bit() only implies barriers when the test is
    successful. To handle the case where the URB is still in use an explicit
    barrier needs to be added to unthrottle() for the second race condition.

    kernfs: fix barrier usage in __kernfs_new_node()
    
    commit 998267900cee901c5d1dfa029a6304d00acbc29f upstream.
    
    smp_mb__before_atomic() can not be applied to atomic_set().  Remove the
    barrier and rely on RELEASE synchronization.

    hwmon: (pwm-fan) Disable PWM if fetching cooling data fails
    
    commit 53f1647da3e8fb3e89066798f0fdc045064d353d upstream.
    
    In case pwm_fan_of_get_cooling_data() fails we should disable the PWM
    just like in the other error cases.

    platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Disable Bluetooth for some machines
    
    commit f7db839fccf087664e5587966220821289b6a9cb upstream.
    
    Some AMD based ThinkPads have a firmware bug that calling
    "GBDC" will cause Bluetooth on Intel wireless cards blocked.
    
    Probe these models by DMI match and disable Bluetooth subdriver
    if specified Intel wireless card exist.

    platform/x86: sony-laptop: Fix unintentional fall-through
    
    commit 1cbd7a64959d33e7a2a1fa2bf36a62b350a9fcbd upstream.
    
    It seems that the default case should return AE_CTRL_TERMINATE, instead
    of falling through to case ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_END_TAG and returning AE_OK;
    otherwise the line of code at the end of the function is unreachable and
    makes no sense:
    
    return AE_CTRL_TERMINATE;
    
    This fix is based on the following thread of discussion:
    
    https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/959782/

    netfilter: compat: initialize all fields in xt_init
    
    commit 8d29d16d21342a0c86405d46de0c4ac5daf1760f upstream
    
    If a non zero value happens to be in xt[NFPROTO_BRIDGE].cur at init
    time, the following panic can be caused by running
    
    % ebtables -t broute -F BROUTING
    
    from a 32-bit user level on a 64-bit kernel. This patch replaces
    kmalloc_array with kcalloc when allocating xt.
