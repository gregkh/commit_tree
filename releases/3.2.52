    can: flexcan: flexcan_chip_start: fix regression, mark one MB for TX and abort pending TX
    
    commit d5a7b406c529e4595ce03dc8f6dcf7fa36f106fa upstream.
    
    In patch
    
        0d1862e can: flexcan: fix flexcan_chip_start() on imx6
    
    the loop in flexcan_chip_start() that iterates over all mailboxes after the
    soft reset of the CAN core was removed. This loop put all mailboxes (even the
    ones marked as reserved 1...7) into EMPTY/INACTIVE mode. On mailboxes 8...63,
    this aborts any pending TX messages.
    
    After a cold boot there is random garbage in the mailboxes, which leads to
    spontaneous transmit of CAN frames during first activation. Further if the
    interface was disabled with a pending message (usually due to an error
    condition on the CAN bus), this message is retransmitted after enabling the
    interface again.
    
    This patch fixes the regression by:
    1) Limiting the maximum number of used mailboxes to 8, 0...7 are used by the RX
    FIFO, 8 is used by TX.
    2) Marking the TX mailbox as EMPTY/INACTIVE, so that any pending TX of that
    mailbox is aborted.

    gianfar: Change default HW Tx queue scheduling mode
    
    commit b98b8babd6e3370fadb7c6eaacb00eb2f6344a6c upstream.
    
    This is primarily to address transmission timeout occurrences, when
    multiple H/W Tx queues are being used concurrently. Because in
    the priority scheduling mode the controller does not service the
    Tx queues equally (but in ascending index order), Tx timeouts are
    being triggered rightaway for a basic test with multiple simultaneous
    connections like:
    iperf -c <server_ip> -n 100M -P 8
    
    resulting in kernel trace:
    NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1 (fsl-gianfar): transmit queue <X> timed out
    ------------[ cut here ]------------
    WARNING: at net/sched/sch_generic.c:255
    ...
    and controller reset during intense traffic, and possibly further
    complications.
    
    This patch changes the default H/W Tx scheduling setting (TXSCHED)
    for multi-queue devices, from priority scheduling mode to a weighted
    round robin mode with equal weights for all H/W Tx queues, and
    addresses the issue above.

    mm, show_mem: suppress page counts in non-blockable contexts
    
    commit 4b59e6c4730978679b414a8da61514a2518da512 upstream.
    
    On large systems with a lot of memory, walking all RAM to determine page
    types may take a half second or even more.
    
    In non-blockable contexts, the page allocator will emit a page allocation
    failure warning unless __GFP_NOWARN is specified.  In such contexts, irqs
    are typically disabled and such a lengthy delay may even result in NMI
    watchdog timeouts.
    
    To fix this, suppress the page walk in such contexts when printing the
    page allocation failure warning.

    staging: comedi: ni_65xx: (bug fix) confine insn_bits to one subdevice
    
    commit 677a31565692d596ef42ea589b53ba289abf4713 upstream.
    
    The `insn_bits` handler `ni_65xx_dio_insn_bits()` has a `for` loop that
    currently writes (optionally) and reads back up to 5 "ports" consisting
    of 8 channels each.  It reads up to 32 1-bit channels but can only read
    and write a whole port at once - it needs to handle up to 5 ports as the
    first channel it reads might not be aligned on a port boundary.  It
    breaks out of the loop early if the next port it handles is beyond the
    final port on the card.  It also breaks out early on the 5th port in the
    loop if the first channel was aligned.  Unfortunately, it doesn't check
    that the current port it is dealing with belongs to the comedi subdevice
    the `insn_bits` handler is acting on.  That's a bug.
    
    Redo the `for` loop to terminate after the final port belonging to the
    subdevice, changing the loop variable in the process to simplify things
    a bit.  The `for` loop could now try and handle more than 5 ports if the
    subdevice has more than 40 channels, but the test `if (bitshift >= 32)`
    ensures it will break out early after 4 or 5 ports (depending on whether
    the first channel is aligned on a port boundary).  (`bitshift` will be
    between -7 and 7 inclusive on the first iteration, increasing by 8 for
    each subsequent operation.)

    ext4: avoid hang when mounting non-journal filesystems with orphan list
    
    commit 0e9a9a1ad619e7e987815d20262d36a2f95717ca upstream.
    
    When trying to mount a file system which does not contain a journal,
    but which does have a orphan list containing an inode which needs to
    be truncated, the mount call with hang forever in
    ext4_orphan_cleanup() because ext4_orphan_del() will return
    immediately without removing the inode from the orphan list, leading
    to an uninterruptible loop in kernel code which will busy out one of
    the CPU's on the system.
    
    This can be trivially reproduced by trying to mount the file system
    found in tests/f_orphan_extents_inode/image.gz from the e2fsprogs
    source tree.  If a malicious user were to put this on a USB stick, and
    mount it on a Linux desktop which has automatic mounts enabled, this
    could be considered a potential denial of service attack.  (Not a big
    deal in practice, but professional paranoids worry about such things,
    and have even been known to allocate CVE numbers for such problems.)

    isofs: Refuse RW mount of the filesystem instead of making it RO
    
    commit 17b7f7cf58926844e1dd40f5eb5348d481deca6a upstream.
    
    Refuse RW mount of isofs filesystem. So far we just silently changed it
    to RO mount but when the media is writeable, block layer won't notice
    this change and thus will think device is used RW and will block eject
    button of the drive. That is unexpected by users because for
    non-writeable media eject button works just fine.
    
    Userspace mount(8) command handles this just fine and retries mounting
    with MS_RDONLY set so userspace shouldn't see any regression.  Plus any
    tool mounting isofs is likely confronted with the case of read-only
    media where block layer already refuses to mount the filesystem without
    MS_RDONLY set so our behavior shouldn't be anything new for it.

    I made sure through testing that this patch would not interfere with the proper

    fanotify: dont merge permission events
    
    commit 03a1cec1f17ac1a6041996b3e40f96b5a2f90e1b upstream.
    
    Boyd Yang reported a problem for the case that multiple threads of the same
    thread group are waiting for a reponse for a permission event.
    In this case it is possible that some of the threads are never woken up, even
    if the response for the event has been received
    (see http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=131822913806350&w=2).
    
    The reason is that we are currently merging permission events if they belong to
    the same thread group. But we are not prepared to wake up more than one waiter
    for each event. We do
    
    wait_event(group->fanotify_data.access_waitq, event->response ||
                            atomic_read(&group->fanotify_data.bypass_perm));
    and after that
      event->response = 0;
    
    which is the reason that even if we woke up all waiters for the same event
    some of them may see event->response being already set 0 again, then go back to
    sleep and block forever.
    
    With this patch we avoid that more than one thread is waiting for a response
    by not merging permission events for the same thread group any more.

    sfc: Fix efx_rx_buf_offset() for recycled pages
    
    This bug fix is only for stable branches older than 3.10.  The bug was
    fixed upstream by commit 2768935a4660 ('sfc: reuse pages to avoid DMA
    mapping/unmapping costs'), but that change is totally unsuitable for
    stable.
    
    Commit b590ace09d51 ('sfc: Fix efx_rx_buf_offset() in the presence of
    swiotlb') added an explicit page_offset member to struct
    efx_rx_buffer, which must be set consistently with the u.page and
    dma_addr fields.  However, it failed to add the necessary assignment
    in efx_resurrect_rx_buffer().  It also did not correct the calculation
    of efx_rx_buffer::dma_addr in efx_resurrect_rx_buffer(), which assumes
    that DMA-mapping a page will result in a page-aligned DMA address
    (exactly what swiotlb violates).
    
    Add the assignment of efx_rx_buffer::page_offset and change the
    calculation of dma_addr to make use of it.

    macvtap: do not zerocopy if iov needs more pages than MAX_SKB_FRAGS
    
    commit ece793fcfc417b3925844be88a6a6dc82ae8f7c6 upstream.
    
    We try to linearize part of the skb when the number of iov is greater than
    MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This is not enough since each single vector may occupy more than
    one pages, so zerocopy_sg_fromiovec() may still fail and may break the guest
    network.
    
    Solve this problem by calculate the pages needed for iov before trying to do
    zerocopy and switch to use copy instead of zerocopy if it needs more than
    MAX_SKB_FRAGS.
    
    This is done through introducing a new helper to count the pages for iov, and
    call uarg->callback() manually when switching from zerocopy to copy to notify
    vhost.
    
    We can do further optimization on top.
    
    This bug were introduced from b92946e2919134ebe2a4083e4302236295ea2a73

    usb: core: don't try to reset_device() a port that got just disconnected
    
    commit 481f2d4f89f87a0baa26147f323380e31cfa7c44 upstream.
    
    The USB hub driver's event handler contains a check to catch SuperSpeed
    devices that transitioned into the SS.Inactive state and tries to fix
    them with a reset. It decides whether to do a plain hub port reset or
    call the usb_reset_device() function based on whether there was a device
    attached to the port.
    
    However, there are device/hub combinations (found with a JetFlash
    Transcend mass storage stick (8564:1000) on the root hub of an Intel
    LynxPoint PCH) which can transition to the SS.Inactive state on
    disconnect (and stay there long enough for the host to notice). In this
    case, above-mentioned reset check will call usb_reset_device() on the
    stale device data structure. The kernel will send pointless LPM control
    messages to the no longer connected device address and can even cause
    several 5 second khubd stalls on some (buggy?) host controllers, before
    finally accepting the device's fate amongst a flurry of error messages.
    
    This patch makes the choice of reset dependent on the port status that
    has just been read from the hub in addition to the existence of an
    in-kernel data structure for the device, and only proceeds with the more
    extensive reset if both are valid.

    debugfs: debugfs_remove_recursive() must not rely on list_empty(d_subdirs)
    
    commit 776164c1faac4966ab14418bb0922e1820da1d19 upstream.
    
    debugfs_remove_recursive() is wrong,
    
    1. it wrongly assumes that !list_empty(d_subdirs) means that this
       dir should be removed.
    
       This is not that bad by itself, but:
    
    2. if d_subdirs does not becomes empty after __debugfs_remove()
       it gives up and silently fails, it doesn't even try to remove
       other entries.
    
       However ->d_subdirs can be non-empty because it still has the
       already deleted !debugfs_positive() entries.
    
    3. simple_release_fs() is called even if __debugfs_remove() fails.
    
    Suppose we have
    
            dir1/
                    dir2/
                            file2
                    file1
    
    and someone opens dir1/dir2/file2.
    
    Now, debugfs_remove_recursive(dir1/dir2) succeeds, and dir1/dir2 goes
    away.
    
    But debugfs_remove_recursive(dir1) silently fails and doesn't remove
    this directory. Because it tries to delete (the already deleted)
    dir1/dir2/file2 again and then fails due to "Avoid infinite loop"
    logic.
    
    Test-case:
    
            #!/bin/sh
    
            cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
            echo 'p:probe/sigprocmask sigprocmask' >> kprobe_events
            sleep 1000 < events/probe/sigprocmask/id &
            echo -n >| kprobe_events
    
            [ -d events/probe ] && echo "ERR!! failed to rm probe"
    
    And after that it is not possible to create another probe entry.
    
    With this patch debugfs_remove_recursive() skips !debugfs_positive()
    files although this is not strictly needed. The most important change
    is that it does not try to make ->d_subdirs empty, it simply scans
    the whole list(s) recursively and removes as much as possible.

    perf: Use css_tryget() to avoid propping up css refcount
    
    commit 9c5da09d266ca9b32eb16cf940f8161d949c2fe5 upstream.
    
    An rmdir pushes css's ref count to zero.  However, if the associated
    directory is open at the time, the dentry ref count is non-zero.  If
    the fd for this directory is then passed into perf_event_open, it
    does a css_get().  This bounces the ref count back up from zero.  This
    is a problem by itself.  But what makes it turn into a crash is the
    fact that we end up doing an extra dput, since we perform a dput
    when css_put sees the ref count go down to zero.
    
    css_tryget() does not fall into that trap. So, we use that instead.
    
    Reproduction test-case for the bug:

    kernel-doc: bugfix - multi-line macros
    
    commit 654784284430bf2739985914b65e09c7c35a7273 upstream.
    
    Prior to this patch the following code breaks:
    
    /**
     * multiline_example - this breaks kernel-doc
     */
     #define multiline_example( \
    myparam)
    
    Producing this error:
    
    Error(somefile.h:983): cannot understand prototype: 'multiline_example( \ '
    
    This patch fixes the issue by appending all lines ending in a blackslash
    (optionally followed by whitespace), removing the backslash and any
    whitespace after it prior to appending (just like the C pre-processor
    would).
    
    This fixes a break in kerel-doc introduced by the additions to rbtree.h.

    esp_scsi: Fix tag state corruption when autosensing.
    
    [ Upstream commit 21af8107f27878813d0364733c0b08813c2c192a ]
    
    Meelis Roos reports a crash in esp_free_lun_tag() in the presense
    of a disk which has died.
    
    The issue is that when we issue an autosense command, we do so by
    hijacking the original command that caused the check-condition.
    
    When we do so we clear out the ent->tag[] array when we issue it via
    find_and_prep_issuable_command().  This is so that the autosense
    command is forced to be issued non-tagged.
    
    That is problematic, because it is the value of ent->tag[] which
    determines whether we issued the original scsi command as tagged
    vs. non-tagged (see esp_alloc_lun_tag()).
    
    And that, in turn, is what trips up the sanity checks in
    esp_free_lun_tag().  That function needs the original ->tag[] values
    in order to free up the tag slot properly.
    
    Fix this by remembering the original command's tag values, and
    having esp_alloc_lun_tag() and esp_free_lun_tag() use them.

    The dma descriptors indexes are only initialized on the probe function.
    
    If a packet is on the buffer when temac_stop is called, the dma
    descriptors indexes can be left on a incorrect state where no other
    package can be sent.
    
    So an interface could be left in an usable state after ifdow/ifup.
    
    This patch makes sure that the descriptors indexes are in a proper
    status when the device is open.

    bonding: Fix broken promiscuity reference counting issue
    
    [ Upstream commit 5a0068deb611109c5ba77358be533f763f395ee4 ]
    
    Recently grabbed this report:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1005567
    
    Of an issue in which the bonding driver, with an attached vlan encountered the
    following errors when bond0 was taken down and back up:
    
    dummy1: promiscuity touches roof, set promiscuity failed. promiscuity feature of
    device might be broken.
    
    The error occurs because, during __bond_release_one, if we release our last
    slave, we take on a random mac address and issue a NETDEV_CHANGEADDR
    notification.  With an attached vlan, the vlan may see that the vlan and bond
    mac address were in sync, but no longer are.  This triggers a call to dev_uc_add
    and dev_set_rx_mode, which enables IFF_PROMISC on the bond device.  Then, when
    we complete __bond_release_one, we use the current state of the bond flags to
    determine if we should decrement the promiscuity of the releasing slave.  But
    since the bond changed promiscuity state during the release operation, we
    incorrectly decrement the slave promisc count when it wasn't in promiscuous mode
    to begin with, causing the above error
    
    Fix is pretty simple, just cache the bonding flags at the start of the function
    and use those when determining the need to set promiscuity.
    
    This is also needed for the ALLMULTI flag

    ipv6: udp packets following an UFO enqueued packet need also be handled by UFO
    
    [ Upstream commit 2811ebac2521ceac84f2bdae402455baa6a7fb47 ]
    
    In the following scenario the socket is corked:
    If the first UDP packet is larger then the mtu we try to append it to the
    write queue via ip6_ufo_append_data. A following packet, which is smaller
    than the mtu would be appended to the already queued up gso-skb via
    plain ip6_append_data. This causes random memory corruptions.
    
    In ip6_ufo_append_data we also have to be careful to not queue up the
    same skb multiple times. So setup the gso frame only when no first skb
    is available.
    
    This also fixes a shortcoming where we add the current packet's length to
    cork->length but return early because of a packet > mtu with dontfrag set
    (instead of sutracting it again).
    
    Found with trinity.

    ip: generate unique IP identificator if local fragmentation is allowed
    
    [ Upstream commit 703133de331a7a7df47f31fb9de51dc6f68a9de8 ]
    
    If local fragmentation is allowed, then ip_select_ident() and
    ip_select_ident_more() need to generate unique IDs to ensure
    correct defragmentation on the peer.
    
    For example, if IPsec (tunnel mode) has to encrypt large skbs
    that have local_df bit set, then all IP fragments that belonged
    to different ESP datagrams would have used the same identificator.
    If one of these IP fragments would get lost or reordered, then
    peer could possibly stitch together wrong IP fragments that did
    not belong to the same datagram. This would lead to a packet loss
    or data corruption.

    [ Upstream commit 9a0620133ccce9dd35c00a96405c8d80938c2cc0 ]
    
    This changes the message_age_timer calculation to use the BPDU's max age as
    opposed to the local bridge's max age.  This is in accordance with section
    8.6.2.3.2 Step 2 of the 802.1D-1998 sprecification.
    
    With the current implementation, when running with very large bridge
    diameters, convergance will not always occur even if a root bridge is
    configured to have a longer max age.

    Moreover, Alan says:
    
      This problem was seen with both Racoon and Racoon2. Other people have seen
      this with OpenSwan. When IPsec is configured to encrypt all upper layer
      protocols the SCTP connection does not initialize. After using Wireshark to
      follow packets, this is because the SCTP packet leaves Box A unencrypted and
      Box B believes all upper layer protocols are to be encrypted so it drops
      this packet, causing the SCTP connection to fail to initialize. When IPsec
      is configured to encrypt just SCTP, the SCTP packets are observed unencrypted.
    
    In fact, using `socat sctp6-listen:3333 -` on one end and transferring "plaintext"
    string on the other end, results in cleartext on the wire where SCTP eventually
    does not report any errors, thus in the latter case that Alan reports, the
    non-paranoid user might think he's communicating over an encrypted transport on
    SCTP although he's not (tcpdump ... -X):
    
      ...
      0x0030: 5d70 8e1a 0003 001a 177d eb6c 0000 0000  ]p.......}.l....
      0x0040: 0000 0000 706c 6169 6e74 6578 740a 0000  ....plaintext...
    
    Only in /proc/net/xfrm_stat we can see XfrmInTmplMismatch increasing on the
    receiver side. Initial follow-up analysis from Alan's bug report was done by
    Alexey Dobriyan. Also thanks to Vlad Yasevich for feedback on this.
    
    SCTP has its own implementation of sctp_v6_xmit() not calling inet6_csk_xmit().
    This has the implication that it probably never really got updated along with
    changes in inet6_csk_xmit() and therefore does not seem to invoke xfrm handlers.
    
    SCTP's IPv4 xmit however, properly calls ip_queue_xmit() to do the work. Since
    a call to inet6_csk_xmit() would solve this problem, but result in unecessary
    route lookups, let us just use the cached flowi6 instead that we got through
    sctp_v6_get_dst(). Since all SCTP packets are being sent through sctp_packet_transmit(),
    we do the route lookup / flow caching in sctp_transport_route(), hold it in
    tp->dst and skb_dst_set() right after that. If we would alter fl6->daddr in
    sctp_v6_xmit() to np->opt->srcrt, we possibly could run into the same effect
    of not having xfrm layer pick it up, hence, use fl6_update_dst() in sctp_v6_get_dst()
    instead to get the correct source routed dst entry, which we assign to the skb.
    
    Also source address routing example from 625034113 ("sctp: fix sctp to work with
    ipv6 source address routing") still works with this patch! Nevertheless, in RFC5095
    it is actually 'recommended' to not use that anyway due to traffic amplification [1].
    So it seems we're not supposed to do that anyway in sctp_v6_xmit(). Moreover, if
    we overwrite the flow destination here, the lower IPv6 layer will be unable to
    put the correct destination address into IP header, as routing header is added in
    ipv6_push_nfrag_opts() but then probably with wrong final destination. Things aside,
    result of this patch is that we do not have any XfrmInTmplMismatch increase plus on
    the wire with this patch it now looks like:
    
    SCTP + IPv6:

    This fixes Kernel Bugzilla 24412. This security issue seems to be present since
    2.6.18 kernels. Lets just hope some big passive adversary in the wild didn't have
    its fun with that. lksctp-tools IPv6 regression test suite passes as well with
    this patch.

    netpoll: fix NULL pointer dereference in netpoll_cleanup
    
    [ Upstream commit d0fe8c888b1fd1a2f84b9962cabcb98a70988aec ]
    
    I've been hitting a NULL ptr deref while using netconsole because the
    np->dev check and the pointer manipulation in netpoll_cleanup are done
    without rtnl and the following sequence happens when having a netconsole
    over a vlan and we remove the vlan while disabling the netconsole:
            CPU 1                                   CPU2
                                            removes vlan and calls the notifier
    enters store_enabled(), calls
    netdev_cleanup which checks np->dev
    and then waits for rtnl
                                            executes the netconsole netdev
                                            release notifier making np->dev
                                            == NULL and releases rtnl
    continues to dereference a member of
    np->dev which at this point is == NULL

    net: sctp: fix smatch warning in sctp_send_asconf_del_ip
    
    [ Upstream commit 88362ad8f9a6cea787420b57cc27ccacef000dbe ]
    
    This was originally reported in [1] and posted by Neil Horman [2], he said:
    
      Fix up a missed null pointer check in the asconf code. If we don't find
      a local address, but we pass in an address length of more than 1, we may
      dereference a NULL laddr pointer. Currently this can't happen, as the only
      users of the function pass in the value 1 as the addrcnt parameter, but
      its not hot path, and it doesn't hurt to check for NULL should that ever
      be the case.
    
    The callpath from sctp_asconf_mgmt() looks okay. But this could be triggered
    from sctp_setsockopt_bindx() call with SCTP_BINDX_REM_ADDR and addrcnt > 1
    while passing all possible addresses from the bind list to SCTP_BINDX_REM_ADDR
    so that we do *not* find a single address in the association's bind address
    list that is not in the packed array of addresses. If this happens when we
    have an established association with ASCONF-capable peers, then we could get
    a NULL pointer dereference as we only check for laddr == NULL && addrcnt == 1
    and call later sctp_make_asconf_update_ip() with NULL laddr.
    
    BUT: this actually won't happen as sctp_bindx_rem() will catch such a case
    and return with an error earlier. As this is incredably unintuitive and error
    prone, add a check to catch at least future bugs here. As Neil says, its not
    hot path. Introduced by 8a07eb0a5 ("sctp: Add ASCONF operation on the
    single-homed host").

    powerpc/iommu: Use GFP_KERNEL instead of GFP_ATOMIC in iommu_init_table()
    
    commit 1cf389df090194a0976dc867b7fffe99d9d490cb upstream.
    
    Under heavy (DLPAR?) stress, we tripped this panic() in
    arch/powerpc/kernel/iommu.c::iommu_init_table():
    
            page = alloc_pages_node(nid, GFP_ATOMIC, get_order(sz));
            if (!page)
                    panic("iommu_init_table: Can't allocate %ld bytes\n", sz);
    
    Before the panic() we got a page allocation failure for an order-2
    allocation. There appears to be memory free, but perhaps not in the
    ATOMIC context. I looked through all the call-sites of
    iommu_init_table() and didn't see any obvious reason to need an ATOMIC
    allocation. Most call-sites in fact have an explicit GFP_KERNEL
    allocation shortly before the call to iommu_init_table(), indicating we
    are not in an atomic context. There is some indirection for some paths,
    but I didn't see any locks indicating that GFP_KERNEL is inappropriate.
    
    With this change under the same conditions, we have not been able to
    reproduce the panic.

    powerpc: Restore registers on error exit from csum_partial_copy_generic()
    
    commit 8f21bd0090052e740944f9397e2be5ac7957ded7 upstream.
    
    The csum_partial_copy_generic() function saves the PowerPC non-volatile
    r14, r15, and r16 registers for the main checksum-and-copy loop.
    Unfortunately, it fails to restore them upon error exit from this loop,
    which results in silent corruption of these registers in the presumably
    rare event of an access exception within that loop.
    
    This commit therefore restores these register on error exit from the loop.

    commit d9813c3681a36774b254c0cdc9cce53c9e22c756 upstream.
    
    The csum_partial_copy_generic() uses register r7 to adjust the remaining
    bytes to process.  Unfortunately, r7 also holds a parameter, namely the
    address of the flag to set in case of access exceptions while reading
    the source buffer.  Lacking a quantum implementation of PowerPC, this

    nilfs2: fix issue with race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks
    
    commit 7f42ec3941560f0902fe3671e36f2c20ffd3af0a upstream.
    
    Many NILFS2 users were reported about strange file system corruption
    (for example):
    
       NILFS: bad btree node (blocknr=185027): level = 0, flags = 0x0, nchildren = 768
       NILFS error (device sda4): nilfs_bmap_last_key: broken bmap (inode number=11540)
    
    But such error messages are consequence of file system's issue that takes
    place more earlier.  Fortunately, Jerome Poulin <jeromepoulin@gmail.com>
    and Anton Eliasson <devel@antoneliasson.se> were reported about another
    issue not so recently.  These reports describe the issue with segctor
    thread's crash:
    
      BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000000000004c83
      IP: nilfs_end_page_io+0x12/0xd0 [nilfs2]
    
      Call Trace:

       kthread+0xc0/0xd0
       ret_from_fork+0x7c/0xb0
    
    These two issues have one reason.  This reason can raise third issue
    too.  Third issue results in hanging of segctor thread with eating of
    100% CPU.
    
    REPRODUCING PATH:
    
    One of the possible way or the issue reproducing was described by
    Jermoe me Poulin <jeromepoulin@gmail.com>:
    
    1. init S to get to single user mode.
    2. sysrq+E to make sure only my shell is running
    3. start network-manager to get my wifi connection up
    4. login as root and launch "screen"
    5. cd /boot/log/nilfs which is a ext3 mount point and can log when NILFS dies.
    6. lscp | xz -9e > lscp.txt.xz
    7. mount my snapshot using mount -o cp=3360839,ro /dev/vgUbuntu/root /mnt/nilfs
    8. start a screen to dump /proc/kmsg to text file since rsyslog is killed
    9. start a screen and launch strace -f -o find-cat.log -t find
    /mnt/nilfs -type f -exec cat {} > /dev/null \;
    10. start a screen and launch strace -f -o apt-get.log -t apt-get update
    11. launch the last command again as it did not crash the first time
    12. apt-get crashes
    13. ps aux > ps-aux-crashed.log
    13. sysrq+W
    14. sysrq+E  wait for everything to terminate
    15. sysrq+SUSB
    
    Simplified way of the issue reproducing is starting kernel compilation
    task and "apt-get update" in parallel.
    
    REPRODUCIBILITY:
    
    The issue is reproduced not stable [60% - 80%].  It is very important to
    have proper environment for the issue reproducing.  The critical
    conditions for successful reproducing:
    
    (1) It should have big modified file by mmap() way.
    
    (2) This file should have the count of dirty blocks are greater that
        several segments in size (for example, two or three) from time to time
        during processing.
    
    (3) It should be intensive background activity of files modification
        in another thread.
    
    INVESTIGATION:
    
    First of all, it is possible to see that the reason of crash is not valid
    page address:
    
      NILFS [nilfs_segctor_complete_write]:2100 bh->b_count 0, bh->b_blocknr 13895680, bh->b_size 13897727, bh->b_page 0000000000001a82
      NILFS [nilfs_segctor_complete_write]:2101 segbuf->sb_segnum 6783
    
    Moreover, value of b_page (0x1a82) is 6786.  This value looks like segment
    number.  And b_blocknr with b_size values look like block numbers.  So,
    buffer_head's pointer points on not proper address value.
    
    Detailed investigation of the issue is discovered such picture:

      BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000000000001a82
      IP: [<ffffffffa024d0f2>] nilfs_end_page_io+0x12/0xd0 [nilfs2]
    
    Usually, for every segment we collect dirty files in list.  Then, dirty
    blocks are gathered for every dirty file, prepared for write and
    submitted by means of nilfs_segbuf_submit_bh() call.  Finally, it takes
    place complete write phase after calling nilfs_end_bio_write() on the
    block layer.  Buffers/pages are marked as not dirty on final phase and
    processed files removed from the list of dirty files.
    
    It is possible to see that we had three prepare_write and submit_bio
    phases before segbuf_wait and complete_write phase.  Moreover, segments
    compete between each other for dirty blocks because on every iteration
    of segments processing dirty buffer_heads are added in several lists of
    payload_buffers:
    
      [SEGMENT 6784]: bh->b_assoc_buffers.next ffff880218a0d5f8, bh->b_assoc_buffers.prev ffff880218bcdf50
      [SEGMENT 6785]: bh->b_assoc_buffers.next ffff880218a0d5f8, bh->b_assoc_buffers.prev ffff880222cc7ee8
    
    The next pointer is the same but prev pointer has changed.  It means
    that buffer_head has next pointer from one list but prev pointer from
    another.  Such modification can be made several times.  And, finally, it
    can be resulted in various issues: (1) segctor hanging, (2) segctor
    crashing, (3) file system metadata corruption.
    
    FIX:
    This patch adds:
    
    (1) setting of BH_Async_Write flag in nilfs_segctor_prepare_write()
        for every proccessed dirty block;
    
    (2) checking of BH_Async_Write flag in
        nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and
        nilfs_lookup_dirty_node_buffers();
    
    (3) clearing of BH_Async_Write flag in nilfs_segctor_complete_write(),
        nilfs_abort_logs(), nilfs_forget_buffer(), nilfs_clear_dirty_page().

    commit 0d1862ea1a5bb876cf05555a7307080cb75bf379 upstream.
    
    In the flexcan_chip_start() function first the flexcan core is going through
    the soft reset sequence, then the RX FIFO is enabled.
    
    With the hardware is put into FIFO mode, message buffers 1...7 are reserved by
    the FIFO engine. The remaining message buffers are in reset default values.
    This patch removes the bogus initialization of the message buffers, as it
    causes an imprecise external abort on imx6.

    The private array at the end of the rtl_priv struct is not aligned.
    On ARM architecture, this causes an alignment trap and is fixed by aligning
    that array with __align(sizeof(void *)). That should properly align that

    usb/core/devio.c: Don't reject control message to endpoint with wrong direction bit
    
    commit 831abf76643555a99b80a3b54adfa7e4fa0a3259 upstream.
    
    Trying to read data from the Pegasus Technologies NoteTaker (0e20:0101)
    [1] with the Windows App (EasyNote) works natively but fails when
    Windows is running under KVM (and the USB device handed to KVM).
    
    The reason is a USB control message
     usb 4-2.2: control urb: bRequestType=22 bRequest=09 wValue=0200 wIndex=0001 wLength=0008
    This goes to endpoint address 0x01 (wIndex); however, endpoint address
    0x01 does not exist. There is an endpoint 0x81 though (same number,
    but other direction); the app may have meant that endpoint instead.
    
    The kernel thus rejects the IO and thus we see the failure.
    
    Apparently, Linux is more strict here than Windows ... we can't change
    the Win app easily, so that's a problem.
    
    It seems that the Win app/driver is buggy here and the driver does not
    behave fully according to the USB HID class spec that it claims to
    belong to.  The device seems to happily deal with that though (and
    seems to not really care about this value much).
    
    So the question is whether the Linux kernel should filter here.
    Rejecting has the risk that somewhat non-compliant userspace apps/
    drivers (most likely in a virtual machine) are prevented from working.
    Not rejecting has the risk of confusing an overly sensitive device with
    such a transfer. Given the fact that Windows does not filter it makes
    this risk rather small though.
    
    The patch makes the kernel more tolerant: If the endpoint address in
    wIndex does not exist, but an endpoint with toggled direction bit does,
    it will let the transfer through. (It does NOT change the message.)
    
    With attached patch, the app in Windows in KVM works.
     usb 4-2.2: check_ctrlrecip: process 13073 (qemu-kvm) requesting ep 01 but needs 81
    
    I suspect this will mostly affect apps in virtual environments; as on
    Linux the apps would have been adapted to the stricter handling of the
    kernel. I have done that for mine[2].

    commit f875fdbf344b9fde207f66b392c40845dd7e5aa6 upstream.
    
    Since uhci-hcd, ehci-hcd, and xhci-hcd support runtime PM, the .pm
    field in their pci_driver structures should be protected by CONFIG_PM
    rather than CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.  The corresponding change has already
    been made for ohci-hcd.
    
    Without this change, controllers won't do runtime suspend if system
    suspend or hibernation isn't enabled.

    commit e3eb270fab7734427dd8171a93e4946fe28674bc upstream.
    
    The vt6656 is prone to resetting on the usb bus.
    
    It seems there is a race condition and wpa supplicant is
    trying to open the device via iw_handlers before its actually
    closed at a stage that the buffers are being removed.
    
    The device is longer considered open when the
    buffers are being removed. So move ~DEVICE_FLAGS_OPENED
    flag to before freeing the device buffers.

    dm-snapshot: fix performance degradation due to small hash size
    
    commit 60e356f381954d79088d0455e357db48cfdd6857 upstream.
    
    LVM2, since version 2.02.96, creates origin with zero size, then loads
    the snapshot driver and then loads the origin.  Consequently, the
    snapshot driver sees the origin size zero and sets the hash size to the
    lower bound 64.  Such small hash table causes performance degradation.
    
    This patch changes it so that the hash size is determined by the size of
    snapshot volume, not minimum of origin and snapshot size.  It doesn't
    make sense to set the snapshot size significantly larger than the origin
    size, so we do not need to take origin size into account when
    calculating the hash size.

    Due to the workaround described in commit 916f676f8 ("x86, efi: Retain
    boot service code until after switching to virtual mode") EFI Boot
    Service regions are mapped for a period during boot. Unfortunately, with
    the limited size of the i386 direct kernel map it's possible that some
    of the Boot Service regions will not be directly accessible, which
    causes them to be ioremap()'d, triggering the above warning as the
    regions are marked as E820_RAM in the e820 memmap.
    
    There are currently only two situations where we need to map EFI Boot
    Service regions,
    
      1. To workaround the firmware bug described in 916f676f8
      2. To access the ACPI BGRT image
    
    but since we haven't seen an i386 implementation that requires either,
    this simple fix should suffice for now.

    serial: pch_uart: fix tty-kref leak in dma-rx path
    
    commit 19b85cfb190eb9980eaf416bff96aef4159a430e upstream.
    
    Fix tty_kref leak when tty_buffer_request room fails in dma-rx path.
    
    Note that the tty ref isn't really needed anymore, but as the leak has
    always been there, fixing it before removing should makes it easier to
    backport the fix.

    HID: validate feature and input report details
    
    commit cc6b54aa54bf40b762cab45a9fc8aa81653146eb upstream.
    
    When dealing with usage_index, be sure to properly use unsigned instead of
    int to avoid overflows.
    
    When working on report fields, always validate that their report_counts are
    in bounds.
    Without this, a HID device could report a malicious feature report that
    could trick the driver into a heap overflow:

    sched/fair: Fix small race where child->se.parent,cfs_rq might point to invalid ones
    
    commit 6c9a27f5da9609fca46cb2b183724531b48f71ad upstream.
    
    There is a small race between copy_process() and cgroup_attach_task()
    where child->se.parent,cfs_rq points to invalid (old) ones.

                                                    -> se.parent,cfs_rq of parent
                                                       are updated.
    
          + cgroup_fork()

              -> se.parent,cfs_rq of child are accessed
                 while they point to old ones. (*2)
    
    In the worst case, this bug can lead to "use-after-free" and cause a panic,
    because it's new cgroup's refcount that is incremented at (*1),
    so the old cgroup(and related data) can be freed before (*2).
    
    In fact, a panic caused by this bug was originally caught in RHEL6.4.

    memcg: fix multiple large threshold notifications
    
    commit 2bff24a3707093c435ab3241c47dcdb5f16e432b upstream.
    
    A memory cgroup with (1) multiple threshold notifications and (2) at least
    one threshold >=2G was not reliable.  Specifically the notifications would
    either not fire or would not fire in the proper order.
    
    The __mem_cgroup_threshold() signaling logic depends on keeping 64 bit
    thresholds in sorted order.  mem_cgroup_usage_register_event() sorts them
    with compare_thresholds(), which returns the difference of two 64 bit
    thresholds as an int.  If the difference is positive but has bit[31] set,
    then sort() treats the difference as negative and breaks sort order.
    
    This fix compares the two arbitrary 64 bit thresholds returning the
    classic -1, 0, 1 result.
    
    The test below sets two notifications (at 0x1000 and 0x81001000):
      cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
      mkdir x
      for x in 4096 2164264960; do
        cgroup_event_listener x/memory.usage_in_bytes $x | sed "s/^/$x listener:/" &
      done
      echo $$ > x/cgroup.procs
      anon_leaker 500M
    
    v3.11-rc7 fails to signal the 4096 event listener:
      Leaking...
      Done leaking pages.
    
    Patched v3.11-rc7 properly notifies:
      Leaking...
      4096 listener:2013:8:31:14:13:36
      Done leaking pages.
    
    The fixed bug is old.  It appears to date back to the introduction of
    memcg threshold notifications in v2.6.34-rc1-116-g2e72b6347c94 "memcg:
    implement memory thresholds"

    mm/huge_memory.c: fix potential NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit a8f531ebc33052642b4bd7b812eedf397108ce64 upstream.
    
    In collapse_huge_page() there is a race window between releasing the
    mmap_sem read lock and taking the mmap_sem write lock, so find_vma() may
    return NULL.  So check the return value to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

    ocfs2: fix the end cluster offset of FIEMAP
    
    commit 28e8be31803b19d0d8f76216cb11b480b8a98bec upstream.
    
    Call fiemap ioctl(2) with given start offset as well as an desired mapping
    range should show extents if possible.  However, we somehow figure out the
    end offset of mapping via 'mapping_end -= cpos' before iterating the
    extent records which would cause problems if the given fiemap length is
    too small to a cluster size, e.g,
    
    Cluster size 4096:
    debugfs.ocfs2 1.6.3
            Block Size Bits: 12   Cluster Size Bits: 12
    
    The extended fiemap test utility From David:
    https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6172331
    
    # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/ocfs2/test_file bs=1M count=1000
    # ./fiemap /ocfs2/test_file 4096 10
    start: 4096, length: 10
    File /ocfs2/test_file has 0 extents:
    #       Logical          Physical         Length           Flags
            ^^^^^ <-- No extent is shown
    
    In this case, at ocfs2_fiemap(): cpos == mapping_end == 1. Hence the
    loop of searching extent records was not executed at all.
    
    This patch remove the in question 'mapping_end -= cpos', and loops
    until the cpos is larger than the mapping_end as usual.

    sd: Fix potential out-of-bounds access
    
    commit 984f1733fcee3fbc78d47e26c5096921c5d9946a upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an out-of-bounds error in sd_read_cache_type(), found
    by Google's AddressSanitizer tool.  When the loop ends, we know that
    "offset" lies beyond the end of the data in the buffer, so no Caching
    mode page was found.  In theory it may be present, but the buffer size
    is limited to 512 bytes.

    drm/radeon/atom: workaround vbios bug in transmitter table on rs880 (v2)
    
    commit 91f3a6aaf280294b07c05dfe606e6c27b7ba3c72 upstream.
    
    The OUTPUT_ENABLE action jumps past the point in the coder where
    the data_offset is set on certain rs780 cards.  This worked
    previously because the OUTPUT_ENABLE action is always called
    immediately after the ENABLE action so the data_offset remained
    set.  In 6f8bbaf568c7f2c497558bfd04654c0b9841ad57
    (drm/radeon/atom: initialize more atom interpretor elements to 0),
    we explictly reset data_offset to 0 between atom calls which then
    caused this to fail.  The fix is to just skip calling the
    OUTPUT_ENABLE action on the problematic chipsets.  The ENABLE
    action does the same thing and more.  Ultimately, we could
    probably drop the OUTPUT_ENABLE action all together on DCE3
    asics.

    drm/i915: try not to lose backlight CBLV precision
    
    commit cac6a5ae0118832936eb162ec4cedb30f2422bcc upstream.
    
    ACPI has _BCM and _BQC methods to set and query the backlight
    brightness, respectively. The ACPI opregion has variables BCLP and CBLV
    to hold the requested and current backlight brightness, respectively.
    
    The BCLP variable has range 0..255 while the others have range
    0..100. This means the _BCM method has to scale the brightness for BCLP,
    and the gfx driver has to scale the requested value back for CBLV. If
    the _BQC method uses the CBLV variable (apparently some implementations
    do, some don't) for current backlight level reporting, there's room for
    rounding errors.
    
    Use DIV_ROUND_UP for scaling back to CBLV to get back to the same values
    that were passed to _BCM, presuming the _BCM simply uses bclp = (in *
    255) / 100 for scaling to BCLP.

    The SMAP register offsets in the versatile PCI controller code were
    all off by four.  (This didn't have any observable bad effects
    because on this board PHYS_OFFSET is zero, and (a) writing zero to
    the flags register at offset 0x10 has no effect and (b) the reset
    value of the SMAP register is zero anyway, so failing to write SMAP2
    didn't matter.)

    fuse: hotfix truncate_pagecache() issue
    
    commit 06a7c3c2781409af95000c60a5df743fd4e2f8b4 upstream.
    
    The way how fuse calls truncate_pagecache() from fuse_change_attributes()
    is completely wrong. Because, w/o i_mutex held, we never sure whether
    'oldsize' and 'attr->size' are valid by the time of execution of
    truncate_pagecache(inode, oldsize, attr->size). In fact, as soon as we
    released fc->lock in the middle of fuse_change_attributes(), we completely
    loose control of actions which may happen with given inode until we reach
    truncate_pagecache. The list of potentially dangerous actions includes
    mmap-ed reads and writes, ftruncate(2) and write(2) extending file size.
    
    The typical outcome of doing truncate_pagecache() with outdated arguments
    is data corruption from user point of view. This is (in some sense)
    acceptable in cases when the issue is triggered by a change of the file on
    the server (i.e. externally wrt fuse operation), but it is absolutely
    intolerable in scenarios when a single fuse client modifies a file without
    any external intervention. A real life case I discovered by fsx-linux
    looked like this:
    
    1. Shrinking ftruncate(2) comes to fuse_do_setattr(). The latter sends
    FUSE_SETATTR to the server synchronously, but before getting fc->lock ...
    2. fuse_dentry_revalidate() is asynchronously called. It sends FUSE_LOOKUP
    to the server synchronously, then calls fuse_change_attributes(). The
    latter updates i_size, releases fc->lock, but before comparing oldsize vs
    attr->size..
    3. fuse_do_setattr() from the first step proceeds by acquiring fc->lock and
    updating attributes and i_size, but now oldsize is equal to
    outarg.attr.size because i_size has just been updated (step 2). Hence,
    fuse_do_setattr() returns w/o calling truncate_pagecache().
    4. As soon as ftruncate(2) completes, the user extends file size by
    write(2) making a hole in the middle of file, then reads data from the hole
    either by read(2) or mmap-ed read. The user expects to get zero data from
    the hole, but gets stale data because truncate_pagecache() is not executed
    yet.
    
    The scenario above illustrates one side of the problem: not truncating the
    page cache even though we should. Another side corresponds to truncating
    page cache too late, when the state of inode changed significantly.
    Theoretically, the following is possible:
    
    1. As in the previous scenario fuse_dentry_revalidate() discovered that
    i_size changed (due to our own fuse_do_setattr()) and is going to call
    truncate_pagecache() for some 'new_size' it believes valid right now. But
    by the time that particular truncate_pagecache() is called ...
    2. fuse_do_setattr() returns (either having called truncate_pagecache() or
    not -- it doesn't matter).
    3. The file is extended either by write(2) or ftruncate(2) or fallocate(2).
    4. mmap-ed write makes a page in the extended region dirty.
    
    The result will be the lost of data user wrote on the fourth step.
    
    The patch is a hotfix resolving the issue in a simplistic way: let's skip
    dangerous i_size update and truncate_pagecache if an operation changing
    file size is in progress. This simplistic approach looks correct for the
    cases w/o external changes. And to handle them properly, more sophisticated
    and intrusive techniques (e.g. NFS-like one) would be required. I'd like to
    postpone it until the issue is well discussed on the mailing list(s).
    
    Changed in v2:
     - improved patch description to cover both sides of the issue.

    fuse: postpone end_page_writeback() in fuse_writepage_locked()
    
    commit 4a4ac4eba1010ef9a804569058ab29e3450c0315 upstream.
    
    The patch fixes a race between ftruncate(2), mmap-ed write and write(2):
    
    1) An user makes a page dirty via mmap-ed write.
    2) The user performs shrinking truncate(2) intended to purge the page.
    3) Before fuse_do_setattr calls truncate_pagecache, the page goes to
       writeback. fuse_writepage_locked fills FUSE_WRITE request and releases
       the original page by end_page_writeback.
    4) fuse_do_setattr() completes and successfully returns. Since now, i_mutex
       is free.
    5) Ordinary write(2) extends i_size back to cover the page. Note that
       fuse_send_write_pages do wait for fuse writeback, but for another
       page->index.
    6) fuse_writepage_locked proceeds by queueing FUSE_WRITE request.
       fuse_send_writepage is supposed to crop inarg->size of the request,
       but it doesn't because i_size has already been extended back.
    
    Moving end_page_writeback to the end of fuse_writepage_locked fixes the
    race because now the fact that truncate_pagecache is successfully returned
    infers that fuse_writepage_locked has already called end_page_writeback.
    And this, in turn, infers that fuse_flush_writepages has already called
    fuse_send_writepage, and the latter used valid (shrunk) i_size. write(2)
    could not extend it because of i_mutex held by ftruncate(2).

    ALSA: hda - hdmi: Fallback to ALSA allocation when selecting CA
    
    commit 18e391862cceaf43ddb8eb5cca05e1a83abdebaa upstream.
    
    hdmi_channel_allocation() tries to find a HDMI channel allocation that
    matches the number channels in the playback stream and contains only
    speakers that the HDMI sink has reported as available via EDID. If no
    such allocation is found, 0 (stereo audio) is used.
    
    Using CA 0 causes the audio causes the sink to discard everything except
    the first two channels (front left and front right).
    
    However, the sink may be capable of receiving more channels than it has
    speakers (and then perform downmix or discard the extra channels), in
    which case it is preferable to use a CA that contains extra channels
    than to use CA 0 which discards all the non-stereo channels.
    
    Additionally, it seems that HBR (HD) passthrough output does not work on
    Intel HDMI codecs when CA is set to 0 (possibly the codec zeroes
    channels not present in CA). This happens with all receivers that report
    a 5.1 speaker mask since a HBR stream is carried on 8 channels to the
    codec.
    
    Add a fallback in the CA selection so that the CA channel count at least
    matches the stream channel count, even if the stream contains channels
    not present in the sink speaker descriptor.
    
    Thanks to GrimGriefer at OpenELEC forums for discovering that changing
    the sink speaker mask allowed HBR output.

    usb: xhci: Disable runtime PM suspend for quirky controllers
    
    commit c8476fb855434c733099079063990e5bfa7ecad6 upstream.
    
    If a USB controller with XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME goes to runtime suspend,
    a reset will be performed upon runtime resume. Any previously suspended
    devices attached to the controller will be re-enumerated at this time.
    This will cause problems, for example, if an open system call on the
    device triggered the resume (the open call will fail).
    
    Note that this change is only relevant when persist_enabled is not set
    for USB devices.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that
    contain the commit c877b3b2ad5cb9d4fe523c5496185cc328ff3ae9 "xhci: Add

    mmc: tmio_mmc_dma: fix PIO fallback on SDHI
    
    commit f936f9b67b7f8c2eae01dd303a0e90bd777c4679 upstream.
    
    I'm testing SH-Mobile SDHI driver in DMA mode with  a new DMA controller  using
    'bonnie++' and getting DMA error after which the tmio_mmc_dma.c code falls back
    to PIO but all commands time out after that.  It turned out that the fallback
    code calls tmio_mmc_enable_dma() with RX/TX channels already freed and pointers
    to them cleared, so that the function bails out early instead  of clearing the
    DMA bit in the CTL_DMA_ENABLE register. The regression was introduced by commit
    162f43e31c5a376ec16336e5d0ac973373d54c89 (mmc: tmio: fix a deadlock).
    Moving tmio_mmc_enable_dma() calls to the top of the PIO fallback code in
    tmio_mmc_start_dma_{rx|tx}() helps.

    usb: ehci-mxc: check for pdata before dereferencing
    
    commit f375fc520d4df0cd9fcb570f33c103c6c0311f9e upstream.
    
    Commit 7e8d5cd93fac ("USB: Add EHCI support for MX27 and MX31 based
    boards") introduced code that could potentially lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference on driver removal.
    
    Fix this by checking for the value of pdata before dereferencing it.

    rculist: list_first_or_null_rcu() should use list_entry_rcu()
    
    commit c34ac00caefbe49d40058ae7200bd58725cebb45 upstream.
    
    list_first_or_null() should test whether the list is empty and return
    pointer to the first entry if not in a RCU safe manner.  It's broken
    in several ways.
    
    * It compares __kernel @__ptr with __rcu @__next triggering the
      following sparse warning.
    
      net/core/dev.c:4331:17: error: incompatible types in comparison expression (different address spaces)
    
    * It doesn't perform rcu_dereference*() and computes the entry address
      using container_of() directly from the __rcu pointer which is
      inconsitent with other rculist interface.  As a result, all three
      in-kernel users - net/core/dev.c, macvlan, cgroup - are buggy.  They
      dereference the pointer w/o going through read barrier.
    
    * While ->next dereference passes through list_next_rcu(), the
      compiler is still free to fetch ->next more than once and thus
      nullify the "__ptr != __next" condition check.
    
    Fix it by making list_first_or_null_rcu() dereference ->next directly
    using ACCESS_ONCE() and then use list_entry_rcu() on it like other
    rculist accessors.
    
    v2: Paul pointed out that the compiler may fetch the pointer more than
        once nullifying the condition check.  ACCESS_ONCE() added on
        ->next dereference.
    
    v3: Restored () around macro param which was accidentally removed.
        Spotted by Paul.

    Similar to a race condition that exists in the tx path, the hardware
    might re-read the 'next' pointer of a descriptor of the last completed
    frame. This only affects non-EDMA (pre-AR93xx) devices.
    
    To deal with this race, defer clearing and re-linking a completed rx
    descriptor until the next one has been processed.

    intel-iommu: Fix leaks in pagetable freeing
    
    commit 3269ee0bd6686baf86630300d528500ac5b516d7 upstream.
    
    At best the current code only seems to free the leaf pagetables and
    the root.  If you're unlucky enough to have a large gap (like any
    QEMU guest with more than 3G of memory), only the first chunk of leaf
    pagetables are freed (plus the root).  This is a massive memory leak.
    This patch re-writes the pagetable freeing function to use a
    recursive algorithm and manages to not only free all the pagetables,
    but does it without any apparent performance loss versus the current
    broken version.

    powerpc: Handle unaligned ldbrx/stdbrx
    
    commit 230aef7a6a23b6166bd4003bfff5af23c9bd381f upstream.
    
    Normally when we haven't implemented an alignment handler for
    a load or store instruction the process will be terminated.
    
    The alignment handler uses the DSISR (or a pseudo one) to locate
    the right handler. Unfortunately ldbrx and stdbrx overlap lfs and
    stfs so we incorrectly think ldbrx is an lfs and stdbrx is an
    stfs.
    
    This bug is particularly nasty - instead of terminating the
    process we apply an incorrect fixup and continue on.
    
    With more and more overlapping instructions we should stop
    creating a pseudo DSISR and index using the instruction directly,
    but for now add a special case to catch ldbrx/stdbrx.

    With the current implementation, the callback in the tail of the list
    can be added twice, because the check done in
    gnttab_request_free_callback is bogus, callback->next can be NULL if
    it is the last callback in the list. If we add the same callback twice
    we end up with an infinite loop, were callback == callback->next.
    
    Replace this check with a proper one that iterates over the list to
    see if the callback has already been added.

    HID: hidraw: correctly deallocate memory on device disconnect
    
    commit 212a871a3934beccf43431608c27ed2e05a476ec upstream.
    
    This changes puts the commit 4fe9f8e203f back in place
    with the fixes for slab corruption because of the commit.
    
    When a device is unplugged, wait for all processes that
    have opened the device to close before deallocating the device.
    
    This commit was solving kernel crash because of the corruption in
    rb tree of vmalloc. The rootcause was the device data pointer was
    geting excessed after the memory associated with hidraw was freed.
    
    The commit 4fe9f8e203f was buggy as it was also freeing the hidraw
    first and then calling delete operation on the list associated with
    that hidraw leading to slab corruption.

    inetpeer_invalidate_tree() waits for a RCU grace period before inserting

    >From the log, we can see three different call chains between
    CPU0 and CPU1:
    
    Time 0 on CPU0:
    
      kernel_init()->inet_init()->dev_add_pack()
    
    At time 0, the ptype_lock is held by CPU0 in dev_add_pack();
    
    Time 1 on CPU1:
    
      tipc_enable_bearer()->enable_bearer()->dev_add_pack()
    
    At time 1, tipc_enable_bearer() first holds tipc_net_lock, and then
    wants to take ptype_lock to register TIPC protocol handler into the
    networking stack.  But the ptype_lock has been taken by dev_add_pack()
    on CPU0, so at this time the dev_add_pack() running on CPU1 has to be
    busy looping.
    
    Time 2 on CPU0:
    
      netif_receive_skb()->recv_msg()->tipc_recv_msg()
    
    At time 2, an incoming TIPC packet arrives at CPU0, hence
    tipc_recv_msg() will be invoked. In tipc_recv_msg(), it first wants
    to hold tipc_net_lock.  At the moment, below scenario happens:
    
    On CPU0, below is our sequence of taking locks:
    
      lock(ptype_lock)->lock(tipc_net_lock)
    
    On CPU1, our sequence of taking locks looks like:
    
      lock(tipc_net_lock)->lock(ptype_lock)
    
    Obviously deadlock may happen in this case.
    
    But please note the deadlock possibly doesn't occur at all when the
    first TIPC bearer is enabled.  Before enable_bearer() -- running on
    CPU1 does not hold ptype_lock, so the TIPC receive handler (i.e.
    recv_msg()) is not registered successfully via dev_add_pack(), so
    the tipc_recv_msg() cannot be called by recv_msg() even if a TIPC
    message comes to CPU0. But when the second TIPC bearer is
    registered, the deadlock can perhaps really happen.
    
    To fix it, we will push the work of registering TIPC protocol
    handler into workqueue context. After the change, both paths taking
    ptype_lock are always in process contexts, thus, the deadlock should
    never occur.

    ICMPv6: treat dest unreachable codes 5 and 6 as EACCES, not EPROTO
    
    [ Upstream commit 61e76b178dbe7145e8d6afa84bb4ccea71918994 ]
    
    RFC 4443 has defined two additional codes for ICMPv6 type 1 (destination
    unreachable) messages:
            5 - Source address failed ingress/egress policy
            6 - Reject route to destination
    
    Now they are treated as protocol error and icmpv6_err_convert() converts them
    to EPROTO.
    
    RFC 4443 says:
            "Codes 5 and 6 are more informative subsets of code 1."
    
    Treat codes 5 and 6 as code 1 (EACCES)
    
    Btw, connect() returning -EPROTO confuses firefox, so that fallback to
    other/IPv4 addresses does not work:

    net: bridge: convert MLDv2 Query MRC into msecs_to_jiffies for max_delay
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d98c29b6fb3de44d9eaa73c09f9cf7209346383 ]
    
    While looking into MLDv1/v2 code, I noticed that bridging code does
    not convert it's max delay into jiffies for MLDv2 messages as we do
    in core IPv6' multicast code.
    
    RFC3810, 5.1.3. Maximum Response Code says:
    
      The Maximum Response Code field specifies the maximum time allowed
      before sending a responding Report. The actual time allowed, called
      the Maximum Response Delay, is represented in units of milliseconds,
      and is derived from the Maximum Response Code as follows: [...]
    
    As we update timers that work with jiffies, we need to convert it.

    ipv6: Don't depend on per socket memory for neighbour discovery messages
    
    [ Upstream commit 25a6e6b84fba601eff7c28d30da8ad7cfbef0d43 ]
    
    Allocating skbs when sending out neighbour discovery messages
    currently uses sock_alloc_send_skb() based on a per net namespace
    socket and thus share a socket wmem buffer space.
    
    If a netdevice is temporarily unable to transmit due to carrier
    loss or for other reasons, the queued up ndisc messages will cosnume
    all of the wmem space and will thus prevent from any more skbs to
    be allocated even for netdevices that are able to transmit packets.
    
    The number of neighbour discovery messages sent is very limited,
    use of alloc_skb() bypasses the socket wmem buffer size enforcement
    while the manual call to skb_set_owner_w() maintains the socket
    reference needed for the IPv6 output path.
    
    This patch has orginally been posted by Eric Dumazet in a modified
    form.

    It is not allowed for an ipv6 packet to contain multiple fragmentation
    headers. So discard packets which were already reassembled by
    fragmentation logic and send back a parameter problem icmp.

    ipv6: remove max_addresses check from ipv6_create_tempaddr
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b08a8f1bd8cb4541c93ec170027b4d0782dab52 ]
    
    Because of the max_addresses check attackers were able to disable privacy
    extensions on an interface by creating enough autoconfigured addresses:
    
    <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q4/292>
    
    But the check is not actually needed: max_addresses protects the
    kernel to install too many ipv6 addresses on an interface and guards
    addrconf_prefix_rcv to install further addresses as soon as this limit
    is reached. We only generate temporary addresses in direct response of
    a new address showing up. As soon as we filled up the maximum number of
    addresses of an interface, we stop installing more addresses and thus
    also stop generating more temp addresses.
    
    Even if the attacker tries to generate a lot of temporary addresses
    by announcing a prefix and removing it again (lifetime == 0) we won't
    install more temp addresses, because the temporary addresses do count
    to the maximum number of addresses, thus we would stop installing new
    autoconfigured addresses when the limit is reached.
    
    This patch fixes CVE-2013-0343 (but other layer-2 attacks are still
    possible).

    It showed several backtraces arising for dma_map_* usage without checking the

    tcp: cubic: fix bug in bictcp_acked()
    
    [ Upstream commit cd6b423afd3c08b27e1fed52db828ade0addbc6b ]
    
    While investigating about strange increase of retransmit rates
    on hosts ~24 days after boot, Van found hystart was disabled
    if ca->epoch_start was 0, as following condition is true
    when tcp_time_stamp high order bit is set.
    
    (s32)(tcp_time_stamp - ca->epoch_start) < HZ
    
    Quoting Van :
    
     At initialization & after every loss ca->epoch_start is set to zero so
     I believe that the above line will turn off hystart as soon as the 2^31
     bit is set in tcp_time_stamp & hystart will stay off for 24 days.
     I think we've observed that cubic's restart is too aggressive without
     hystart so this might account for the higher drop rate we observe.

    [ Upstream commit 2ed0edf9090bf4afa2c6fc4f38575a85a80d4b20 ]
    
    commit 17a6e9f1aa9 ("tcp_cubic: fix clock dependency") added an
    overflow error in bictcp_update() in following code :
    
    /* change the unit from HZ to bictcp_HZ */
    t = ((tcp_time_stamp + msecs_to_jiffies(ca->delay_min>>3) -
          ca->epoch_start) << BICTCP_HZ) / HZ;
    
    Because msecs_to_jiffies() being unsigned long, compiler does
    implicit type promotion.
    
    We really want to constrain (tcp_time_stamp - ca->epoch_start)
    to a signed 32bit value, or else 't' has unexpected high values.
    
    This bugs triggers an increase of retransmit rates ~24 days after
    boot [1], as the high order bit of tcp_time_stamp flips.
    
    [1] for hosts with HZ=1000

    net: check net.core.somaxconn sysctl values
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f671d6b4ec3e6d66c2a868738af2cdea09e7509 ]
    
    It's possible to assign an invalid value to the net.core.somaxconn
    sysctl variable, because there is no checks at all.
    
    The sk_max_ack_backlog field of the sock structure is defined as
    unsigned short. Therefore, the backlog argument in inet_listen()
    shouldn't exceed USHRT_MAX. The backlog argument in the listen() syscall
    is truncated to the somaxconn value. So, the somaxconn value shouldn't
    exceed 65535 (USHRT_MAX).
    Also, negative values of somaxconn are meaningless.
    
    before:
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=256
    net.core.somaxconn = 256
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65536
    net.core.somaxconn = 65536
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=-100
    net.core.somaxconn = -100
    
    after:
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=256
    net.core.somaxconn = 256
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65536
    error: "Invalid argument" setting key "net.core.somaxconn"
    $ sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=-100
    error: "Invalid argument" setting key "net.core.somaxconn"
    
    Based on a prior patch from Changli Gao.

    htb: fix sign extension bug
    
    [ Upstream commit cbd375567f7e4811b1c721f75ec519828ac6583f ]
    
    When userspace passes a large priority value
    the assignment of the unsigned value hopt->prio
    to  signed int cl->prio causes cl->prio to become negative and the
    comparison is with TC_HTB_NUMPRIO is always false.
    
    The result is that HTB crashes by referencing outside
    the array when processing packets. With this patch the large value
    wraps around like other values outside the normal range.
