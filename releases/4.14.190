    parisc: Add atomic64_set_release() define to avoid CPU soft lockups
    
    commit be6577af0cef934ccb036445314072e8cb9217b9 upstream.
    
    Stalls are quite frequent with recent kernels. I enabled
    CONFIG_SOFTLOCKUP_DETECTOR and I caught the following stall:

    The code was stuck in this loop in d_alloc_parallel:
    
        4037d414:   0e 00 10 dc     ldd 0(r16),ret0

        4037d41c:   08 00 02 40     nop
    
    This is the inner loop of bit_spin_lock which is called by hlist_bl_unlock in
    d_alloc_parallel:
    
    static inline void bit_spin_lock(int bitnum, unsigned long *addr)
    {
            /*
             * Assuming the lock is uncontended, this never enters
             * the body of the outer loop. If it is contended, then
             * within the inner loop a non-atomic test is used to
             * busywait with less bus contention for a good time to
             * attempt to acquire the lock bit.
             */
            preempt_disable();
    #if defined(CONFIG_SMP) || defined(CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK)
            while (unlikely(test_and_set_bit_lock(bitnum, addr))) {
                    preempt_enable();
                    do {
                            cpu_relax();
                    } while (test_bit(bitnum, addr));
                    preempt_disable();
            }
    #endif
            __acquire(bitlock);
    }
    
    After consideration, I realized that we must be losing bit unlocks.
    Then, I noticed that we missed defining atomic64_set_release().
    Adding this define fixes the stalls in bit operations.

    io-mapping: indicate mapping failure
    
    commit e0b3e0b1a04367fc15c07f44e78361545b55357c upstream.
    
    The !ATOMIC_IOMAP version of io_maping_init_wc will always return
    success, even when the ioremap fails.
    
    Since the ATOMIC_IOMAP version returns NULL when the init fails, and
    callers check for a NULL return on error this is unexpected.
    
    During a device probe, where the ioremap failed, a crash can look like
    this:
    
        BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000210000

    The remap failure occurred much earlier in the probe.  If it had been
    propagated, the driver would have exited with an error.

    mm/memcg: fix refcount error while moving and swapping
    
    commit 8d22a9351035ef2ff12ef163a1091b8b8cf1e49c upstream.
    
    It was hard to keep a test running, moving tasks between memcgs with
    move_charge_at_immigrate, while swapping: mem_cgroup_id_get_many()'s
    refcount is discovered to be 0 (supposedly impossible), so it is then
    forced to REFCOUNT_SATURATED, and after thousands of warnings in quick
    succession, the test is at last put out of misery by being OOM killed.
    
    This is because of the way moved_swap accounting was saved up until the
    task move gets completed in __mem_cgroup_clear_mc(), deferred from when
    mem_cgroup_move_swap_account() actually exchanged old and new ids.
    Concurrent activity can free up swap quicker than the task is scanned,
    bringing id refcount down 0 (which should only be possible when
    offlining).
    
    Just skip that optimization: do that part of the accounting immediately.

    Makefile: Fix GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR prefix for Clang cross compilation
    
    commit ca9b31f6bb9c6aa9b4e5f0792f39a97bbffb8c51 upstream.
    
    When CROSS_COMPILE is set (e.g. aarch64-linux-gnu-), if
    $(CROSS_COMPILE)elfedit is found at /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-elfedit,
    GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR will be set to /usr/bin/.  --prefix= will be set to
    /usr/bin/ and Clang as of 11 will search for both
    $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu-$needle and $(prefix)$needle.
    
    GCC searchs for $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu/$version/$needle,
    $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu/$needle and $(prefix)$needle. In practice,
    $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu/$needle rarely contains executables.
    
    To better model how GCC's -B/--prefix takes in effect in practice, newer
    Clang (since
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/3452a0d8c17f7166f479706b293caf6ac76ffd90)
    only searches for $(prefix)$needle. Currently it will find /usr/bin/as
    instead of /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-as.
    
    Set --prefix= to $(GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR)$(notdir $(CROSS_COMPILE))
    (/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-) so that newer Clang can find the
    appropriate cross compiling GNU as (when -no-integrated-as is in
    effect).

    vt: Reject zero-sized screen buffer size.
    
    commit ce684552a266cb1c7cc2f7e623f38567adec6653 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting general protection fault in do_con_write() [1] caused
    by vc->vc_screenbuf == ZERO_SIZE_PTR caused by vc->vc_screenbuf_size == 0
    caused by vc->vc_cols == vc->vc_rows == vc->vc_size_row == 0 caused by
    fb_set_var() from ioctl(FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO) on /dev/fb0 , for
    gotoxy(vc, 0, 0) from reset_terminal() from vc_init() from vc_allocate()
     from con_install() from tty_init_dev() from tty_open() on such console
    causes vc->vc_pos == 0x10000000e due to
    ((unsigned long) ZERO_SIZE_PTR) + -1U * 0 + (-1U << 1).
    
    I don't think that a console with 0 column or 0 row makes sense. And it
    seems that vc_do_resize() does not intend to allow resizing a console to
    0 column or 0 row due to
    
      new_cols = (cols ? cols : vc->vc_cols);
      new_rows = (lines ? lines : vc->vc_rows);
    
    exception.
    
    Theoretically, cols and rows can be any range as long as
    0 < cols * rows * 2 <= KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is satisfied (e.g.
    cols == 1048576 && rows == 2 is possible) because of
    
      vc->vc_size_row = vc->vc_cols << 1;
      vc->vc_screenbuf_size = vc->vc_rows * vc->vc_size_row;
    
    in visual_init() and kzalloc(vc->vc_screenbuf_size) in vc_allocate().
    
    Since we can detect cols == 0 or rows == 0 via screenbuf_size = 0 in
    visual_init(), we can reject kzalloc(0). Then, vc_allocate() will return
    an error, and con_write() will not be called on a console with 0 column
    or 0 row.
    
    We need to make sure that integer overflow in visual_init() won't happen.
    Since vc_do_resize() restricts cols <= 32767 and rows <= 32767, applying
    1 <= cols <= 32767 and 1 <= rows <= 32767 restrictions to vc_allocate()
    will be practically fine.
    
    This patch does not touch con_init(), for returning -EINVAL there
    does not help when we are not returning -ENOMEM.

    fbdev: Detect integer underflow at "struct fbcon_ops"->clear_margins.
    
    commit 033724d6864245a11f8e04c066002e6ad22b3fd0 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting general protection fault in bitfill_aligned() [1]
    caused by integer underflow in bit_clear_margins(). The cause of this
    problem is when and how do_vc_resize() updates vc->vc_{cols,rows}.
    
    If vc_do_resize() fails (e.g. kzalloc() fails) when var.xres or var.yres
    is going to shrink, vc->vc_{cols,rows} will not be updated. This allows
    bit_clear_margins() to see info->var.xres < (vc->vc_cols * cw) or
    info->var.yres < (vc->vc_rows * ch). Unexpectedly large rw or bh will
    try to overrun the __iomem region and causes general protection fault.
    
    Also, vc_resize(vc, 0, 0) does not set vc->vc_{cols,rows} = 0 due to
    
      new_cols = (cols ? cols : vc->vc_cols);
      new_rows = (lines ? lines : vc->vc_rows);
    
    exception. Since cols and lines are calculated as
    
      cols = FBCON_SWAP(ops->rotate, info->var.xres, info->var.yres);
      rows = FBCON_SWAP(ops->rotate, info->var.yres, info->var.xres);
      cols /= vc->vc_font.width;
      rows /= vc->vc_font.height;
      vc_resize(vc, cols, rows);
    
    in fbcon_modechanged(), var.xres < vc->vc_font.width makes cols = 0
    and var.yres < vc->vc_font.height makes rows = 0. This means that
    
      const int fd = open("/dev/fb0", O_ACCMODE);
      struct fb_var_screeninfo var = { };
      ioctl(fd, FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO, &var);
      var.xres = var.yres = 1;
      ioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO, &var);
    
    easily reproduces integer underflow bug explained above.
    
    Of course, callers of vc_resize() are not handling vc_do_resize() failure
    is bad. But we can't avoid vc_resize(vc, 0, 0) which returns 0. Therefore,
    as a band-aid workaround, this patch checks integer underflow in
    "struct fbcon_ops"->clear_margins call, assuming that
    vc->vc_cols * vc->vc_font.width and vc->vc_rows * vc->vc_font.heigh do not
    cause integer overflow.

    serial: 8250_mtk: Fix high-speed baud rates clamping
    
    commit 551e553f0d4ab623e2a6f424ab5834f9c7b5229c upstream.
    
    Commit 7b668c064ec3 ("serial: 8250: Fix max baud limit in generic 8250
    port") fixed limits of a baud rate setting for a generic 8250 port.
    In other words since that commit the baud rate has been permitted to be
    within [uartclk / 16 / UART_DIV_MAX; uartclk / 16], which is absolutely
    normal for a standard 8250 UART port. But there are custom 8250 ports,
    which provide extended baud rate limits. In particular the Mediatek 8250
    port can work with baud rates up to "uartclk" speed.
    
    Normally that and any other peculiarity is supposed to be handled in a
    custom set_termios() callback implemented in the vendor-specific
    8250-port glue-driver. Currently that is how it's done for the most of
    the vendor-specific 8250 ports, but for some reason for Mediatek a
    solution has been spread out to both the glue-driver and to the generic
    8250-port code. Due to that a bug has been introduced, which permitted the
    extended baud rate limit for all even for standard 8250-ports. The bug
    has been fixed by the commit 7b668c064ec3 ("serial: 8250: Fix max baud
    limit in generic 8250 port") by narrowing the baud rates limit back down to
    the normal bounds. Unfortunately by doing so we also broke the
    Mediatek-specific extended bauds feature.
    
    A fix of the problem described above is twofold. First since we can't get
    back the extended baud rate limits feature to the generic set_termios()
    function and that method supports only a standard baud rates range, the
    requested baud rate must be locally stored before calling it and then
    restored back to the new termios structure after the generic set_termios()
    finished its magic business. By doing so we still use the
    serial8250_do_set_termios() method to set the LCR/MCR/FCR/etc. registers,
    while the extended baud rate setting procedure will be performed later in
    the custom Mediatek-specific set_termios() callback. Second since a true
    baud rate is now fully calculated in the custom set_termios() method we
    need to locally update the port timeout by calling the
    uart_update_timeout() function. After the fixes described above are
    implemented in the 8250_mtk.c driver, the Mediatek 8250-port should
    get back to normally working with extended baud rates.

    SERIAL_PORT_DFNS is not defined on each arch, if it's not defined,
    serial8250_set_defaults() won't be called in serial8250_isa_init_ports(),
    so the p->serial_in pointer won't be initialized, and it leads a null-ptr-deref.
    Fix this problem by calling serial8250_set_defaults() after init uart port.

    staging: comedi: ni_6527: fix INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG support
    
    commit f07804ec77d77f8a9dcf570a24154e17747bc82f upstream.
    
    `ni6527_intr_insn_config()` processes `INSN_CONFIG` comedi instructions
    for the "interrupt" subdevice.  When `data[0]` is
    `INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG` it is configuring the digital trigger.  When
    `data[2]` is `COMEDI_DIGITAL_TRIG_ENABLE_EDGES` it is configuring rising
    and falling edge detection for the digital trigger, using a base channel
    number (or shift amount) in `data[3]`, a rising edge bitmask in
    `data[4]` and falling edge bitmask in `data[5]`.
    
    If the base channel number (shift amount) is greater than or equal to
    the number of channels (24) of the digital input subdevice, there are no
    changes to the rising and falling edges, so the mask of channels to be
    changed can be set to 0, otherwise the mask of channels to be changed,
    and the rising and falling edge bitmasks are shifted by the base channel
    number before calling `ni6527_set_edge_detection()` to change the
    appropriate registers.  Unfortunately, the code is comparing the base
    channel (shift amount) to the interrupt subdevice's number of channels
    (1) instead of the digital input subdevice's number of channels (24).
    Fix it by comparing to 32 because all shift amounts for an `unsigned
    int` must be less than that and everything from bit 24 upwards is
    ignored by `ni6527_set_edge_detection()` anyway.

    commit 0e6705182d4e1b77248a93470d6d7b3013d59b30 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 9ffad9263b467efd8f8dc7ae1941a0a655a2bab2.
    
    Upon additional testing with older servers, it was found that
    the original commit introduced a regression when using the old SMB1
    dialect and rsyncing over an existing file.
    
    The patch will need to be respun to address this, likely including
    a larger refactoring of the SMB1 and SMB3 rename code paths to make
    it less confusing and also to address some additional rename error
    cases that SMB3 may be able to workaround.

    Commit a1b2289cef92ef0e ("android: binder: drop lru lock in isolate

    [ Upstream commit e84861fec32dee8a2e62bbaa52cded6b05a2a456 ]
    
    This function is used by dev_get_regmap() to retrieve a regmap for the
    specified device. If the device has more than one regmap, the name parameter
    can be used to specify one.
    
    The code here uses a pointer comparison to check for equal strings. This
    however will probably always fail, as the regmap->name is allocated via
    kstrdup_const() from the regmap's config->name.
    
    Fix this by using strcmp() instead.

    HID: apple: Disable Fn-key key-re-mapping on clone keyboards
    
    [ Upstream commit a5d81646fa294eed57786a9310b06ca48902adf8 ]
    
    The Maxxter KB-BT-001 Bluetooth keyboard, which looks somewhat like the
    Apple Wireless Keyboard, is using the vendor and product IDs (05AC:0239)
    of the Apple Wireless Keyboard (2009 ANSI version) <sigh>.
    
    But its F1 - F10 keys are marked as sending F1 - F10, not the special
    functions hid-apple.c maps them too; and since its descriptors do not
    contain the HID_UP_CUSTOM | 0x0003 usage apple-hid looks for for the
    Fn-key, apple_setup_input() never gets called, so F1 - F6 are mapped
    to key-codes which have not been set in the keybit array causing them
    to not send any events at all.
    
    The lack of a usage code matching the Fn key in the clone is actually
    useful as this allows solving this problem in a generic way.
    
    This commits adds a fn_found flag and it adds a input_configured
    callback which checks if this flag is set once all usages have been
    mapped. If it is not set, then assume this is a clone and clear the
    quirks bitmap so that the hid-apple code does not add any special
    handling to this keyboard.
    
    This fixes F1 - F6 not sending anything at all and F7 - F12 sending
    the wrong codes on the Maxxter KB-BT-001 Bluetooth keyboard and on
    similar clones.

    Sealevel XR17V35X based devices are inoperable on kernel versions
    4.11 and above due to a change in the GPIO preconfiguration introduced in
    commit
    7dea8165f1d. This patch fixes this by preconfiguring the GPIO on Sealevel
    cards to the value (0x00) used prior to commit 7dea8165f1d
    
    With GPIOs preconfigured as per commit 7dea8165f1d all ports on
    Sealevel XR17V35X based devices become stuck in high impedance
    mode, regardless of dip-switch or software configuration. This
    causes the device to become effectively unusable. This patch (in
    various forms) has been distributed to our customers and no issues
    related to it have been reported.

    If register_netdevice() is failed, net_device should not be used

    So, the routine should be stopped immediately.

    immediately. That will result in a panic because of using uninitialized
    or freed memory.

    btrfs: fix mount failure caused by race with umount
    
    commit 48cfa61b58a1fee0bc49eef04f8ccf31493b7cdd upstream.
    
    It is possible to cause a btrfs mount to fail by racing it with a slow
    umount. The crux of the sequence is generic_shutdown_super not yet
    calling sop->put_super before btrfs_mount_root calls btrfs_open_devices.
    If that occurs, btrfs_open_devices will decide the opened counter is
    non-zero, increment it, and skip resetting fs_devices->total_rw_bytes to
    0. From here, mount will call sget which will result in grab_super
    trying to take the super block umount semaphore. That semaphore will be
    held by the slow umount, so mount will block. Before up-ing the
    semaphore, umount will delete the super block, resulting in mount's sget
    reliably allocating a new one, which causes the mount path to dutifully
    fill it out, and increment total_rw_bytes a second time, which causes
    the mount to fail, as we see double the expected bytes.
    
    Here is the sequence laid out in greater detail:
    
    CPU0                                                    CPU1
    down_write sb->s_umount
    btrfs_kill_super
      kill_anon_super(sb)
        generic_shutdown_super(sb);
          shrink_dcache_for_umount(sb);
          sync_filesystem(sb);
          evict_inodes(sb); // SLOW
    
                                                  btrfs_mount_root
                                                    btrfs_scan_one_device
                                                    fs_devices = device->fs_devices
                                                    fs_info->fs_devices = fs_devices
                                                    // fs_devices-opened makes this a no-op
                                                    btrfs_open_devices(fs_devices, mode, fs_type)
                                                    s = sget(fs_type, test, set, flags, fs_info);
                                                      find sb in s_instances
                                                      grab_super(sb);
                                                        down_write(&s->s_umount); // blocks
    
          sop->put_super(sb)
            // sb->fs_devices->opened == 2; no-op
          spin_lock(&sb_lock);
          hlist_del_init(&sb->s_instances);
          spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
          up_write(&sb->s_umount);
                                                        return 0;
                                                      retry lookup
                                                      don't find sb in s_instances (deleted by CPU0)
                                                      s = alloc_super
                                                      return s;
                                                    btrfs_fill_super(s, fs_devices, data)
                                                      open_ctree // fs_devices total_rw_bytes improperly set!
                                                        btrfs_read_chunk_tree
                                                          read_one_dev // increment total_rw_bytes again!!
                                                          super_total_bytes < fs_devices->total_rw_bytes // ERROR!!!
    
    To fix this, we clear total_rw_bytes from within btrfs_read_chunk_tree
    before the calls to read_one_dev, while holding the sb umount semaphore
    and the uuid mutex.
    
    To reproduce, it is sufficient to dirty a decent number of inodes, then
    quickly umount and mount.
    
      for i in $(seq 0 500)
      do
        dd if=/dev/zero of="/mnt/foo/$i" bs=1M count=1
      done
      umount /mnt/foo&
      mount /mnt/foo
    
    does the trick for me.

    btrfs: fix double free on ulist after backref resolution failure
    
    commit 580c079b5766ac706f56eec5c79aee4bf929fef6 upstream.
    
    At btrfs_find_all_roots_safe() we allocate a ulist and set the **roots
    argument to point to it. However if later we fail due to an error returned
    by find_parent_nodes(), we free that ulist but leave a dangling pointer in
    the **roots argument. Upon receiving the error, a caller of this function
    can attempt to free the same ulist again, resulting in an invalid memory
    access.
    
    One such scenario is during qgroup accounting:
    
    btrfs_qgroup_account_extents()
    
     --> calls btrfs_find_all_roots() passes &new_roots (a stack allocated
         pointer) to btrfs_find_all_roots()
    
       --> btrfs_find_all_roots() just calls btrfs_find_all_roots_safe()
           passing &new_roots to it
    
         --> allocates ulist and assigns its address to **roots (which
             points to new_roots from btrfs_qgroup_account_extents())
    
         --> find_parent_nodes() returns an error, so we free the ulist
             and leave **roots pointing to it after returning
    
     --> btrfs_qgroup_account_extents() sees btrfs_find_all_roots() returned
         an error and jumps to the label 'cleanup', which just tries to
         free again the same ulist

    ASoC: rt5670: Correct RT5670_LDO_SEL_MASK
    
    commit 5cacc6f5764e94fa753b2c1f5f7f1f3f74286e82 upstream.
    
    The RT5670_PWR_ANLG1 register has 3 bits to select the LDO voltage,
    so the correct mask is 0x7 not 0x3.
    
    Because of this wrong mask we were programming the ldo bits
    to a setting of binary 001 (0x05 & 0x03) instead of binary 101
    when moving to SND_SOC_BIAS_PREPARE.
    
    According to the datasheet 001 is a reserved value, so no idea
    what it did, since the driver was working fine before I guess we
    got lucky and it does something which is ok.

    ALSA: info: Drop WARN_ON() from buffer NULL sanity check
    
    commit 60379ba08532eca861e933b389526a4dc89e0c42 upstream.
    
    snd_info_get_line() has a sanity check of NULL buffer -- both buffer
    itself being NULL and buffer->buffer being NULL.  Basically both
    checks are valid and necessary, but the problem is that it's with
    snd_BUG_ON() macro that triggers WARN_ON().  The latter condition
    (NULL buffer->buffer) can be met arbitrarily by user since the buffer
    is allocated at the first write, so it means that user can trigger
    WARN_ON() at will.
    
    This patch addresses it by simply moving buffer->buffer NULL check out
    of snd_BUG_ON() so that spurious WARNING is no longer triggered.

    uprobes: Change handle_swbp() to send SIGTRAP with si_code=SI_KERNEL, to fix GDB regression
    
    commit fe5ed7ab99c656bd2f5b79b49df0e9ebf2cead8a upstream.
    
    If a tracee is uprobed and it hits int3 inserted by debugger, handle_swbp()
    does send_sig(SIGTRAP, current, 0) which means si_code == SI_USER. This used
    to work when this code was written, but then GDB started to validate si_code
    and now it simply can't use breakpoints if the tracee has an active uprobe:
    
            # cat test.c
            void unused_func(void)
            {
            }
            int main(void)
            {
                    return 0;
            }
    
            # gcc -g test.c -o test
            # perf probe -x ./test -a unused_func
            # perf record -e probe_test:unused_func gdb ./test -ex run
            GNU gdb (GDB) 10.0.50.20200714-git
            ...
            Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
            0x00007ffff7ddf909 in dl_main () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
            (gdb)
    
    The tracee hits the internal breakpoint inserted by GDB to monitor shared
    library events but GDB misinterprets this SIGTRAP and reports a signal.
    
    Change handle_swbp() to use force_sig(SIGTRAP), this matches do_int3_user()
    and fixes the problem.
    
    This is the minimal fix for -stable, arch/x86/kernel/uprobes.c is equally
    wrong; it should use send_sigtrap(TRAP_TRACE) instead of send_sig(SIGTRAP),
    but this doesn't confuse GDB and needs another x86-specific patch.

    The DSPI interrupt can be shared between two controllers at least on the
    LX2160A. In that case, the driver for one controller might misbehave and
    consume the other's interrupt. Fix this by actually checking if any of
    the bits in the status register have been asserted.

    commit 65caafd0d2145d1dd02072c4ced540624daeab40 upstream.
    
    Reverting commit d03727b248d0 "NFSv4 fix CLOSE not waiting for
    direct IO compeletion". This patch made it so that fput() by calling
    inode_dio_done() in nfs_file_release() would wait uninterruptably
    for any outstanding directIO to the file (but that wait on IO should
    be killable).
    
    The problem the patch was also trying to address was REMOVE returning
    ERR_ACCESS because the file is still opened, is supposed to be resolved
    by server returning ERR_FILE_OPEN and not ERR_ACCESS.

    irqdomain/treewide: Keep firmware node unconditionally allocated
    
    [ Upstream commit e3beca48a45b5e0e6e6a4e0124276b8248dcc9bb ]
    
    Quite some non OF/ACPI users of irqdomains allocate firmware nodes of type
    IRQCHIP_FWNODE_NAMED or IRQCHIP_FWNODE_NAMED_ID and free them right after
    creating the irqdomain. The only purpose of these FW nodes is to convey
    name information. When this was introduced the core code did not store the
    pointer to the node in the irqdomain. A recent change stored the firmware
    node pointer in irqdomain for other reasons and missed to notice that the
    usage sites which do the alloc_fwnode/create_domain/free_fwnode sequence
    are broken by this. Storing a dangling pointer is dangerous itself, but in
    case that the domain is destroyed later on this leads to a double free.
    
    Remove the freeing of the firmware node after creating the irqdomain from
    all affected call sites to cure this.

    net: sky2: initialize return of gm_phy_read
    
    [ Upstream commit 28b18e4eb515af7c6661c3995c6e3c34412c2874 ]
    
    clang static analysis flags this garbage return
    
    drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/sky2.c:208:2: warning: Undefined or garbage value returned to caller [core.uninitialized.UndefReturn]
            return v;

    static inline u16 gm_phy_read( ...
    {
            u16 v;
            __gm_phy_read(hw, port, reg, &v);
            return v;
    }
    
    __gm_phy_read can return without setting v.
    
    So handle similar to skge.c's gm_phy_read, initialize v.

    drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Fixed the value of hard_header_len
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dc829a135fb5927f1519de11286e2bbb79f5b66 ]
    
    When this driver transmits data,
      first this driver will remove a pseudo header of 1 byte,
      then the lapb module will prepend the LAPB header of 2 or 3 bytes,
      then this driver will prepend a length field of 2 bytes,
      then the underlying Ethernet device will prepend its own header.
    
    So, the header length required should be:
      -1 + 3 + 2 + "the header length needed by the underlying device".
    
    This patch fixes kernel panic when this driver is used with AF_PACKET
    SOCK_DGRAM sockets.

    mac80211: allow rx of mesh eapol frames with default rx key
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b467b63870d9c05c81456aa9bfee894ab2db3b6 ]
    
    Without this patch, eapol frames cannot be received in mesh
    mode, when 802.1X should be used. Initially only a MGTK is
    defined, which is found and set as rx->key, when there are
    no other keys set. ieee80211_drop_unencrypted would then
    drop these eapol frames, as they are data frames without
    encryption and there exists some rx->key.
    
    Fix this by differentiating between mesh eapol frames and
    other data frames with existing rx->key. Allow mesh mesh
    eapol frames only if they are for our vif address.
    
    With this patch in-place, ieee80211_rx_h_mesh_fwding continues
    after the ieee80211_drop_unencrypted check and notices, that
    these eapol frames have to be delivered locally, as they should.

    [ Upstream commit 69339d083dfb7786b0e0b3fc19eaddcf11fabdfb ]
    
    uart0_pins is defined as:
    static const unsigned uart0_pins[] = {135, 136, 137, 138, 139};
    
    which npins is wronly specified as 9 later
            {
                    .name = "uart0",
                    .pins = uart0_pins,
                    .npins = 9,
            },
    
    npins should be 5 instead of 9 according to the definition.
