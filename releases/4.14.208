    ACPI: GED: fix -Wformat
    
    commit 9debfb81e7654fe7388a49f45bc4d789b94c1103 upstream.
    
    Clang is more aggressive about -Wformat warnings when the format flag
    specifies a type smaller than the parameter. It turns out that gsi is an
    int. Fixes:
    
    drivers/acpi/evged.c:105:48: warning: format specifies type 'unsigned
    char' but the argument has type 'unsigned int' [-Wformat]
    trigger == ACPI_EDGE_SENSITIVE ? 'E' : 'L', gsi);

    mac80211: always wind down STA state
    
    commit dcd479e10a0510522a5d88b29b8f79ea3467d501 upstream.
    
    When (for example) an IBSS station is pre-moved to AUTHORIZED
    before it's inserted, and then the insertion fails, we don't
    clean up the fast RX/TX states that might already have been
    created, since we don't go through all the state transitions
    again on the way down.
    
    Do that, if it hasn't been done already, when the station is
    freed. I considered only freeing the fast TX/RX state there,
    but we might add more state so it's more robust to wind down
    the state properly.
    
    Note that we warn if the station was ever inserted, it should
    have been properly cleaned up in that case, and the driver
    will probably not like things happening out of order.

    powerpc/8xx: Always fault when _PAGE_ACCESSED is not set
    
    commit 29daf869cbab69088fe1755d9dd224e99ba78b56 upstream.
    
    The kernel expects pte_young() to work regardless of CONFIG_SWAP.
    
    Make sure a minor fault is taken to set _PAGE_ACCESSED when it
    is not already set, regardless of the selection of CONFIG_SWAP.
    
    This adds at least 3 instructions to the TLB miss exception
    handlers fast path. Following patch will reduce this overhead.
    
    Also update the rotation instruction to the correct number of bits
    to reflect all changes done to _PAGE_ACCESSED over time.

    i2c: imx: Fix external abort on interrupt in exit paths
    
    commit e50e4f0b85be308a01b830c5fbdffc657e1a6dd0 upstream
    
    If interrupt comes late, during probe error path or device remove (could
    be triggered with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ), the interrupt handler
    i2c_imx_isr() will access registers with the clock being disabled.  This
    leads to external abort on non-linefetch on Toradex Colibri VF50 module
    (with Vybrid VF5xx):

    The resource-managed framework should not be used for interrupt handling,
    because the resource will be released too late - after disabling clocks.
    The interrupt handler is not prepared for such case.

    powerpc/64s: flush L1D after user accesses
    
    commit 9a32a7e78bd0cd9a9b6332cbdc345ee5ffd0c5de upstream.
    
    IBM Power9 processors can speculatively operate on data in the L1 cache before
    it has been completely validated, via a way-prediction mechanism. It is not possible
    for an attacker to determine the contents of impermissible memory using this method,
    since these systems implement a combination of hardware and software security measures
    to prevent scenarios where protected data could be leaked.
    
    However these measures don't address the scenario where an attacker induces
    the operating system to speculatively execute instructions using data that the
    attacker controls. This can be used for example to speculatively bypass "kernel
    user access prevention" techniques, as discovered by Anthony Steinhauser of
    Google's Safeside Project. This is not an attack by itself, but there is a possibility
    it could be used in conjunction with side-channels or other weaknesses in the
    privileged code to construct an attack.
    
    This issue can be mitigated by flushing the L1 cache between privilege boundaries
    of concern. This patch flushes the L1 cache after user accesses.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2020-4788.

    powerpc/uaccess: Evaluate macro arguments once, before user access is allowed
    
    commit d02f6b7dab8228487268298ea1f21081c0b4b3eb upstream.
    
    get/put_user() can be called with nontrivial arguments. fs/proc/page.c
    has a good example:
    
        if (put_user(stable_page_flags(ppage), out)) {
    
    stable_page_flags() is quite a lot of code, including spin locks in
    the page allocator.
    
    Ensure these arguments are evaluated before user access is allowed.
    
    This improves security by reducing code with access to userspace, but
    it also fixes a PREEMPT bug with KUAP on powerpc/64s:
    stable_page_flags() is currently called with AMR set to allow writes,
    it ends up calling spin_unlock(), which can call preempt_schedule. But
    the task switch code can not be called with AMR set (it relies on
    interrupts saving the register), so this blows up.
    
    It's fine if the code inside allow_user_access() is preemptible,
    because a timer or IPI will save the AMR, but it's not okay to
    explicitly cause a reschedule.

    powerpc: Fix __clear_user() with KUAP enabled
    
    commit 61e3acd8c693a14fc69b824cb5b08d02cb90a6e7 upstream.
    
    The KUAP implementation adds calls in clear_user() to enable and
    disable access to userspace memory. However, it doesn't add these to
    __clear_user(), which is used in the ptrace regset code.
    
    As there's only one direct user of __clear_user() (the regset code),
    and the time taken to set the AMR for KUAP purposes is going to
    dominate the cost of a quick access_ok(), there's not much point
    having a separate path.
    
    Rename __clear_user() to __arch_clear_user(), and make __clear_user()
    just call clear_user().

    commit 5cd623333e7cf4e3a334c70529268b65f2a6c2c7 upstream.
    
    Today, when a function like strncpy_from_user() is called,
    the userspace access protection is de-activated and re-activated
    for every word read.
    
    By implementing user_access_begin and friends, the protection
    is de-activated at the beginning of the copy and re-activated at the
    end.
    
    Implement user_access_begin(), user_access_end() and
    unsafe_get_user(), unsafe_put_user() and unsafe_copy_to_user()
    
    For the time being, we keep user_access_save() and
    user_access_restore() as nops.

    powerpc: Add a framework for user access tracking
    
    Backported from commit de78a9c42a79 ("powerpc: Add a framework
    for Kernel Userspace Access Protection"). Here we don't try to
    add the KUAP framework, we just want the helper functions
    because we want to put uaccess flush helpers in them.
    
    In terms of fixes, we don't need commit 1d8f739b07bd ("powerpc/kuap:
    Fix set direction in allow/prevent_user_access()") as we don't have
    real KUAP. Likewise as all our allows are noops and all our prevents
    are just flushes, we don't need commit 9dc086f1e9ef ("powerpc/futex:
    Fix incorrect user access blocking") The other 2 fixes we do need.
    
    The original description is:
    
    This patch implements a framework for Kernel Userspace Access
    Protection.
    
    Then subarches will have the possibility to provide their own
    implementation by providing setup_kuap() and
    allow/prevent_user_access().
    
    Some platforms will need to know the area accessed and whether it is
    accessed from read, write or both. Therefore source, destination and
    size and handed over to the two functions.
    
    mpe: Rename to allow/prevent rather than unlock/lock, and add
    read/write wrappers. Drop the 32-bit code for now until we have an
    implementation for it. Add kuap to pt_regs for 64-bit as well as
    32-bit. Don't split strings, use pr_crit_ratelimited().

    powerpc/64s: flush L1D on kernel entry
    
    commit f79643787e0a0762d2409b7b8334e83f22d85695 upstream.
    
    IBM Power9 processors can speculatively operate on data in the L1 cache before
    it has been completely validated, via a way-prediction mechanism. It is not possible
    for an attacker to determine the contents of impermissible memory using this method,
    since these systems implement a combination of hardware and software security measures
    to prevent scenarios where protected data could be leaked.
    
    However these measures don't address the scenario where an attacker induces
    the operating system to speculatively execute instructions using data that the
    attacker controls. This can be used for example to speculatively bypass "kernel
    user access prevention" techniques, as discovered by Anthony Steinhauser of
    Google's Safeside Project. This is not an attack by itself, but there is a possibility
    it could be used in conjunction with side-channels or other weaknesses in the
    privileged code to construct an attack.
    
    This issue can be mitigated by flushing the L1 cache between privilege boundaries
    of concern. This patch flushes the L1 cache on kernel entry.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2020-4788.

    powerpc/64s: move some exception handlers out of line
    
    (backport only)
    
    We're about to grow the exception handlers, which will make a bunch of them
    no longer fit within the space available. We move them out of line.
    
    This is a fiddly and error-prone business, so in the interests of reviewability
    I haven't merged this in with the addition of the entry flush.

    powerpc/64s: Define MASKABLE_RELON_EXCEPTION_PSERIES_OOL
    
    Commit da2bc4644c75 ("powerpc/64s: Add new exception vector macros")
    adds:
    
    +#define __TRAMP_REAL_VIRT_OOL_MASKABLE(name, realvec)          \
    +       TRAMP_REAL_BEGIN(tramp_virt_##name);                            \
    +       MASKABLE_RELON_EXCEPTION_PSERIES_OOL(realvec, name##_common);   \
    
    However there's no reference there or anywhere else to
    MASKABLE_RELON_EXCEPTION_PSERIES_OOL and an attempt to use it
    unsurprisingly doesn't work.
    
    Add a definition provided by mpe.
