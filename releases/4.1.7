    ARM: 8405/1: VDSO: fix regression with toolchains lacking ld.bfd executable
    
    commit 3473f26592c1c365d376aee29433d7db75f14d1e upstream.
    
    The Sourcery CodeBench Lite 2014.05 toolchain (gcc 4.8.3, binutils
    2.24.51) has a GCC which implements -fuse-ld, and it doesn't include
    the gold linker, but it lacks an ld.bfd executable in its
    installation.  This means that passing -fuse-ld=bfd fails with:
    
          VDSO    arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so.raw
        collect2: fatal error: cannot find 'ld'
    
    Arguably this is a deficiency in the toolchain, but I suspect it's
    commonly used enough that it's worth accommodating: just use
    
    cc-ldoption (to cause a link attempt) instead of cc-option to test
    whether we can use -fuse-ld.  So -fuse-ld=bfd won't be used with this
    toolchain, but the build will rightly succeed, just as it does for
    toolchains which don't implement -fuse-ld (and don't use gold as the
    default linker).
    
    Note: this will change the failure mode for a corner case I was trying
    to handle in d2b30cd4b722, where the toolchain defaults to the gold
    linker and the BFD linker is not found in PATH, from:
    
          VDSO    arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so.raw
        collect2: fatal error: cannot find 'ld'
    
    i.e. the BFD linker is not found, to:
    
          OBJCOPY arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so
        BFD: arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so: Not enough room for program headers, try
        linking with -N
    
    that is, we fail to prevent gold from being used as the linker, and it
    produces an object that objcopy can't digest.

    x86/apic: Fix fallout from x2apic cleanup
    
    commit a57e456a7b28431b55e407e5ab78ebd5b378d19e upstream.
    
    In the recent x2apic cleanup I got two things really wrong:
    1) The safety check in __disable_x2apic which allows the function to
       be called unconditionally is backwards. The check is there to
       prevent access to the apic MSR in case that the machine has no
       apic. Though right now it returns if the machine has an apic and
       therefor the disabling of x2apic is never invoked.
    
    2) x2apic_disable() sets x2apic_mode to 0 after registering the local
       apic. That's wrong, because register_lapic_address() checks x2apic
       mode and therefor takes the wrong code path.
    
    This results in boot failures on machines with x2apic preenabled by
    BIOS and can also lead to an fatal MSR access on machines without
    apic.
    
    The solutions are simple:
    1) Correct the sanity check for apic availability
    2) Clear x2apic_mode _before_ calling register_lapic_address()

    arm64: KVM: Fix host crash when injecting a fault into a 32bit guest

    When injecting a fault into a misbehaving 32bit guest, it seems
    rather idiotic to also inject a 64bit fault that is only going
    to corrupt the guest state. This leads to a situation where we
    perform an illegal exception return at EL2 causing the host
    to crash instead of killing the guest.

    commit db196935d9562abec4510f48d887bc1f1e054fcf upstream.
    
    We added changes in fnic driver patch 1.6.0.16 to acquire
    io_req_lock in fnic_queuecommand() before issuing I/O so that io completion
    is serialized. But when releasing the lock we check for the I/O flag and
    this could be modified if IO abort occurs before I/O completion. In this case
    we wont release the lock and causes deadlock in some scenerios. Using the
    local variable to check the IO lock status will resolve the problem.

    can: pcan_usb: don't provide CAN FD bittimings by non-FD adapters
    
    commit 06b23f7fbbf26a025fd68395c7586949db586b47 upstream.
    
    The CAN FD data bittiming constants are provided via netlink only when there
    are valid CAN FD constants available in priv->data_bittiming_const.
    
    Due to the indirection of pointer assignments in the peak_usb driver the
    priv->data_bittiming_const never becomes NULL - not even for non-FD adapters.
    
    The data_bittiming_const points to zero'ed data which leads to this result
    when running 'ip -details link show can0':
    
    35: can0: <NOARP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 10
        link/can  promiscuity 0

    SCSI: Fix NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM
    
    commit 49718f0fb8c9af192b33d8af3a2826db04025371 upstream.
    
    The routines in scsi_rpm.c assume that if a runtime-PM callback is
    invoked for a SCSI device, it can only mean that the device's driver
    has asked the block layer to handle the runtime power management (by
    calling blk_pm_runtime_init(), which among other things sets q->dev).
    
    However, this assumption turns out to be wrong for things like the ses
    driver.  Normally ses devices are not allowed to do runtime PM, but
    userspace can override this setting.  If this happens, the kernel gets
    a NULL pointer dereference when blk_post_runtime_resume() tries to use
    the uninitialized q->dev pointer.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by calling the block layer's runtime-PM
    routines only if the device's driver really does have a runtime-PM
    callback routine.  Since ses doesn't define any such callbacks, the
    crash won't occur.
    
    This fixes Bugzilla #101371.

    genirq: Don't return ENOSYS in irq_chip_retrigger_hierarchy
    
    commit 6d4affea7d5aa5ca5ff4c3e5fbf3ee16801cc527 upstream.
    
    irq_chip_retrigger_hierarchy() returns -ENOSYS if it was not able to
    find at least one .irq_retrigger() callback implemented in the IRQ
    domain hierarchy.
    
    That's wrong, because check_irq_resend() expects a 0 return value from
    the callback in case that the hardware assisted resend was not
    possible. If the return value is non zero the core code assumes
    hardware resend success and the software resend is not invoked.
    
    This results in lost interrupts on platforms where none of the parent
    irq chips in the hierarchy implements the retrigger callback.
    
    This is observable on TI OMAP, where the hierarchy is:
    
     ARM GIC <- OMAP wakeupgen <- TI Crossbar
    
    Return 0 instead so the software resend mechanism gets invoked.

    ARM: OMAP: wakeupgen: Restore the irq_set_type() mechanism
    
    commit 63059a272398ef5dc1bd7065a036e8b6e82d1af7 upstream.
    
    The conversion of the wakeupgen irqchip to hierarchical irq domains
    failed to provide a mechanism to properly set the trigger type of an
    interrupt.
    
    The wakeupgen irq chip itself has no mechanism and therefor no
    irq_set_type() callback. The code before the conversion relayed the
    trigger configuration directly to the underlying GIC.
    
    Restore the correct behaviour by setting the wakeupgen irq_set_type
    callback to irq_chip_set_type_parent(). This propagates the
    set_trigger() call to the underlying GIC irqchip.

    irqchip/crossbar: Restore set_wake functionality
    
    commit 8200fe4347870d4ad6475048bcdf3e7c106c5268 upstream.
    
    The TI crossbar irqchip doesn't provides any facility to configure the
    wakeup sources, but the conversion to hierarchical irqdomains set the
    irq_set_wake callback to irq_chip_set_wake_parent. The parent chip
    (OMAP wakeupgen) has no irq_set_wake function either so the call will
    fail with -ENOSYS. As a result the irq_set_wake() call in the resume
    path will trigger an 'Unbalanced wake disable' warning.
    
    Before the conversion the GIC irqchip was the top level irqchip and
    correctly flagged with IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE.
    
    Restore the correct behaviour by removing the irq_set_type callback
    from the crossbar irqchip and set the IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE flag which
    lets the irq_set_irq_wake() call from the driver succeed.

    irqchip/crossbar: Restore the mask on suspend behaviour
    
    commit 4fd8f47e7e5b64a74b60f23c2e08ba8234d659d1 upstream.
    
    The ARM GIC requires that all interrupts which are not used as a
    wakeup source have to be masked during suspend.
    
    The conversion of the crossbar irqchip to hierarchical irq domains
    failed to mark the crossbar irqchip with the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND
    flag and therefor broke the suspend requirement of the GIC.
    
    Before the conversion the flags were visible because the GIC was the
    top level irqchip. After the conversion the crossbar irqchip is the
    top level irq chip whose flags are evaluated in suspend_device_irq().
    As the flag is not set the masking of the non-wakeup irqs is not
    invoked which breaks suspend.
    
    Add the IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND flag to the crossbar irqchip, so the
    GIC interrupts get masked properly.

    irqchip/crossbar: Restore the irq_set_type() mechanism
    
    commit e269ec42328783e51be08c191aa935dba56141fc upstream.
    
    The conversion of the crossbar irqchip to hierarchical irq domains
    failed to provide a mechanism to properly set the trigger type of an
    interrupt.
    
    The crossbar irq chip itself has no mechanism and therefor no
    irq_set_type() callback. The code before the conversion relayed the
    trigger configuration directly to the underlying GIC.
    
    Restore the correct behaviour by setting the crossbar irq_set_type
    callback to irq_chip_set_type_parent(). This propagates the
    set_trigger() call to the underlying GIC irqchip.

    9p: ensure err is initialized to 0 in p9_client_read/write
    
    commit 999b8b88c6060adf7a9b7907740ae86ace65291e upstream.
    
    Some use of those functions were providing unitialized values to those
    functions. Notably, when reading 0 bytes from an empty file on a 9P
    filesystem, the return code of read() was not 0.

        #include <assert.h>
        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <sys/stat.h>
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int main(int argc, const char **argv)
        {
            assert(argc == 2);
            char buffer[256];
            int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY);
            assert(fd >= 0);
            assert(read(fd, buffer, 0) == 0);

    commit 903ecd0bb970438c3a60c2c33ec9032d6443bf67 upstream.
    
    Everytime we use the logical context with execlists it becomes dirty (as
    the hardware will write the new register values afterwards, as well as
    the GPU state that will be used). We need to then flag the context as
    dirty everytime since after a swap-out/swap-in cycle the dirty flag will
    be cleared, and a further swap-out cycle will then loose the most recent
    GPU state.

    PA-RISC does not set ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT, even for 64-bit kernels, so
    prior to 3a9ad0b4fdcd, we always used 32-bit PCI addresses.  After
    3a9ad0b4fdcd, we do use 64-bit PCI addresses in 64-bit kernels, and
    apparently there's some PA-RISC problem related to them.

    target/iscsi: Fix double free of a TUR followed by a solicited NOPOUT
    
    commit 9547308bda296b6f69876c840a0291fcfbeddbb8 upstream.
    
    Make sure all non-READ SCSI commands get targ_xfer_tag initialized
    to 0xffffffff, not just WRITEs.
    
    Double-free of a TUR cmd object occurs under the following scenario:
    
    1. TUR received (targ_xfer_tag is uninitialized and left at 0)
    2. TUR status sent
    3. First unsolicited NOPIN is sent to initiator (gets targ_xfer_tag of 0)
    4. NOPOUT for NOPIN (with TTT=0) arrives
     - its ExpStatSN acks TUR status, TUR is queued for removal
     - LIO tries to find NOPIN with TTT=0, but finds the same TUR instead,
       TUR is queued for removal for the 2nd time
    
    (Drop unbalanced conditional bracket usage - nab)

    ALSA: hda - Fix path power activation
    
    commit c7cd0ef66aade29e37ee08821a0e195ee776c6e6 upstream.
    
    The widget power-saving code tries to turn up/down the power of each
    widget in the I/O paths that are modified at each jack plug/unplug.
    The recent report revealed that the power activation leaves some
    widgets unpowered after plugging.  This is because
    snd_hda_activate_path() turns on path->active flag at the end of the
    function while the path power management is done before that.  Then
    it's regarded as if nothing is active, and the driver turns off the
    power.
    
    The fix is simply to set the flag at the beginning of the function,
    before trying to power up.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix runtime PM unbalance
    
    commit 9003ebb13f61e8c78a641e0dda7775183ada0625 upstream.
    
    The fix for deadlock in PM in commit [1ee23fe07ee8: ALSA: usb-audio:

    However, the brainless patch author evaluated it in a wrong way
    (logical AND instead of logical OR), thus usb_autopm_get_interface()
    is wrongly called at probing, leading to unbalance of runtime PM
    refcount.
    
    This patch fixes it by correcting the logic.

    crypto: nx - respect sg limit bounds when building sg lists for SHA
    
    commit d3392f41f6d3cd0a034bd0aca47fabea2b47218e upstream.
    
    Commit 000851119e80 changed sha256/512 update functions to
    pass more data to nx_build_sg_list(), which ends with
    sg list overflows and usually with update functions failing
    for data larger than max_sg_len * NX_PAGE_SIZE.
    
    This happens because:
    - both "total" and "to_process" are updated, which leads to
      "to_process" getting overflowed for some data lengths
      For example:
        In first iteration "total" is 50, and let's assume "to_process"
        is 30 due to sg limits. At the end of first iteration "total" is
        set to 20. At start of 2nd iteration "to_process" overflows on:
          to_process = total - to_process;
    - "in_sg" is not reset to nx_ctx->in_sg after each iteration
    - nx_build_sg_list() is hitting overflow because the amount of data
      passed to it would require more than sgmax elements
    - as consequence of previous item, data stored in overflowed sg list
      may no longer be aligned to SHA*_BLOCK_SIZE
    
    This patch changes sha256/512 update functions so that "to_process"
    respects sg limits and never tries to pass more data to
    nx_build_sg_list() to avoid overflows. "to_process" is calculated
    as minimum of "total" and sg limits at start of every iteration.

                          limit bounds")

    Commit bcdb247c6b6a ("sd: Limit transfer length") clamped the maximum

    max_hw_sectors defines the limit for the I/O controller only.

    libiscsi: Fix host busy blocking during connection teardown
    
    commit 660d0831d1494a6837b2f810d08b5be092c1f31d upstream.
    
    In case of hw iscsi offload, an host can have N-number of active
    connections. There can be IO's running on some connections which
    make host->host_busy always TRUE. Now if logout from a connection
    is tried then the code gets into an infinite loop as host->host_busy
    is always TRUE.
    
     iscsi_conn_teardown(....)
     {
       .........
        /*
         * Block until all in-progress commands for this connection
         * time out or fail.
         */
         for (;;) {
          spin_lock_irqsave(session->host->host_lock, flags);
          if (!atomic_read(&session->host->host_busy)) { /* OK for ERL == 0 */
                  spin_unlock_irqrestore(session->host->host_lock, flags);
                  break;
          }
         spin_unlock_irqrestore(session->host->host_lock, flags);
         msleep_interruptible(500);
         iscsi_conn_printk(KERN_INFO, conn, "iscsi conn_destroy(): "
                     "host_busy %d host_failed %d\n",
                      atomic_read(&session->host->host_busy),
                      session->host->host_failed);
    
            ................
            ...............
         }
      }
    
    This is not an issue with software-iscsi/iser as each cxn is a separate
    host.
    
    Fix:
    Acquiring eh_mutex in iscsi_conn_teardown() before setting

    When inserting a new register into a block, the present bit map size is

    mfd: arizona: Fix initialisation of the PM runtime
    
    commit 72e43164fd472f6c2659c8313b87da962322dbcf upstream.
    
    The PM runtime core by default assumes a chip is suspended when runtime
    PM is enabled. Currently the arizona driver enables runtime PM when the
    chip is fully active and then disables the DCVDD regulator at the end of
    arizona_dev_init. This however has several problems, firstly the if we
    reach the end of arizona_dev_init, we did not properly follow all the
    proceedures for shutting down the chip, and most notably we never marked
    the chip as cache only so any writes occurring between then and the next
    PM runtime resume will be lost. Secondly, if we are already resumed when
    we reach the end of dev_init, then at best we get unbalanced regulator
    enable/disables at work we lose DCVDD whilst we need it.
    
    Additionally, since the commit 4f0216409f7c ("mfd: arizona: Add better
    support for system suspend"), the PM runtime operations may
    disable/enable the IRQ, so the IRQs must now be enabled before we call
    any PM operations.
    
    This patch adds a call to pm_runtime_set_active to inform the PM core
    that the device is starting up active and moves the PM enabling to
    around the IRQ initialisation to avoid any PM callbacks happening until
    the IRQs are initialised.

    ARM: invalidate L1 before enabling coherency
    
    commit bac51ad9d14f6baed3730ef53bedc1eb2238563a upstream.
    
    We must invalidate the L1 cache before enabling coherency, otherwise
    secondary CPUs can inject invalid cache lines into the coherent CPU
    cluster, which could then be migrated to other CPUs.  This fixes a
    recent regression with SoCFPGA randomly failing to boot.

    ARM: v7 setup function should invalidate L1 cache
    
    commit 02b4e2756e01c623cc4dbceae4b07be75252db5b upstream.
    
    All ARMv5 and older CPUs invalidate their caches in the early assembly
    setup function, prior to enabling the MMU.  This is because the L1
    cache should not contain any data relevant to the execution of the
    kernel at this point; all data should have been flushed out to memory.
    
    This requirement should also be true for ARMv6 and ARMv7 CPUs - indeed,
    these typically do not search their caches when caching is disabled (as
    it needs to be when the MMU is disabled) so this change should be safe.
    
    ARMv7 allows there to be CPUs which search their caches while caching is
    disabled, and it's permitted that the cache is uninitialised at boot;
    for these, the architecture reference manual requires that an
    implementation specific code sequence is used immediately after reset
    to ensure that the cache is placed into a sane state.  Such
    functionality is definitely outside the remit of the Linux kernel, and
    must be done by the SoC's firmware before _any_ CPU gets to the Linux
    kernel.
    
    Changing the data cache clean+invalidate to a mere invalidate allows us
    to get rid of a lot of platform specific hacks around this issue for
    their secondary CPU bringup paths - some of which were buggy.

    ARM: 8384/1: VDSO: force use of BFD linker
    
    commit d2b30cd4b7223a96e606dfc8120626f66d81e091 upstream.
    
    When using a toolchain with gold as the default linker, the VDSO build
    fails:
    
      VDSO    arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so.raw
      HOSTCC  arch/arm/vdso/vdsomunge
      MUNGE   arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so.dbg
      OBJCOPY arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so
    BFD: arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so: Not enough room for program headers, try
    linking with -N
    
    For whatever reason, ld.gold is omitting an exidx program header that
    ld.bfd emits, and even when I work around that, I don't get a working
    VDSO.
    
    For now, instead of supporting gold (which will fail to link the
    kernel anyway since it does not implement --pic-veneer), direct the
    compiler to use the traditional bfd linker.  This is accomplished by
    using -fuse-ld, which is implemented in GCC 4.8 and later.
    
    Note: one limitation of this is that if the toolchain is configured
    to use gold by default, and the bfd linker is not in $PATH, the VDSO
    build will fail:
    
      VDSO    arch/arm/vdso/vdso.so.raw
    collect2: fatal error: cannot find 'ld'
    
    This will happen if CROSS_COMPILE begins with a path such as
    /opt/bin/arm-linux-gnu- but /opt/bin is not in $PATH.  This is
    considered an acceptable corner-case limitation and is easily worked
    around.
    
    Additonal note: we use cc-option instead of cc-ldoption so that
    -fuse-ld=bfd is placed in the command line if the compiler recognizes
    the option.  Using cc-ldoption results in an attempt to link, which
    fails in the situation just described, causing -fuse-ld=bfd to be
    omitted and gold to be used for the VDSO link, which is what we're
    trying to prevent.

    commit d33ce23b2160d26b27a47092da5d556b5b11a12a upstream.
    
    Currently the VDSO's link options are kind of a mess spread between
    
    ccflags-y and cmd_vdsold.  Collect linker directives into one
    variable, VDSO_LDFLAGS, and use that in cmd_vdsold.

    The PCIe interrupts are also routed through the GPC. This has been

    commit 8f2777f53e3d5ad8ef2a176a4463a5c8e1a16431 upstream.

    libfc: Fix fc_exch_recv_req() error path
    
    commit f6979adeaab578f8ca14fdd32b06ddee0d9d3314 upstream.
    
    Due to patch "libfc: Do not invoke the response handler after
    fc_exch_done()" (commit ID 7030fd62) the lport_recv() call
    in fc_exch_recv_req() is passed a dangling pointer. Avoid this
    by moving the fc_frame_free() call from fc_invoke_resp() to its
    callers. This patch fixes the following crash:

    drm/vmwgfx: Fix execbuf locking issues
    
    commit 3e04e2fe6d87807d27521ad6ebb9e7919d628f25 upstream.
    
    This addresses two issues that cause problems with viewperf maya-03 in
    situation with memory pressure.
    
    The first issue causes attempts to unreserve buffers if batched
    reservation fails due to, for example, a signal pending. While previously
    the ttm_eu api was resistant against this type of error, it is no longer
    and the lockdep code will complain about attempting to unreserve buffers
    that are not reserved. The issue is resolved by avoid calling
    ttm_eu_backoff_reservation in the buffer reserve error path.
    
    The second issue is that the binding_mutex may be held when user-space
    fence objects are created and hence during memory reclaims. This may cause
    recursive attempts to grab the binding mutex. The issue is resolved by not
    holding the binding mutex across fence creation and submission.

    HID: hid-input: Fix accessing freed memory during device disconnect
    
    commit 0621809e37936e7c2b3eac9165cf2aad7f9189eb upstream.
    
    During unbinding the driver was dereferencing a pointer to memory
    already freed by power_supply_unregister().
    
    Driver was freeing its internal description of battery through pointers
    stored in power_supply structure. However, because the core owns the
    power supply instance, after calling power_supply_unregister() this
    memory is freed and the driver cannot access these members.
    
    Fix this by storing the pointer to internal description of battery in a
    local variable before calling power_supply_unregister(), so the pointer
    remains valid.

    iwlwifi: pcie: fix prepare card flow
    
    commit c9fdec9f3970eeaa1b176422f46167f5f5158804 upstream.
    
    When the card is not owned by the PCIe bus, we need to
    acquire ownership first. This flow is implemented in
    iwl_pcie_prepare_card_hw. Because of a hardware bug, we
    need to disable link power management before we can
    request ownership otherwise the other user of the device
    won't get notified that we are requesting the device which
    will prevent us from acquire ownership.
    
    Same holds for the down flow where we need to make sure
    that any other potential user is notified that the driver
    is going down.

    perf: Fix running time accounting
    
    commit 00a2916f7f82c348a2a94dbb572874173bc308a3 upstream.
    
    A recent fix to the shadow timestamp inadvertly broke the running time
    accounting.
    
    We must not update the running timestamp if we fail to schedule the
    event, the event will not have ran. This can (and did) result in
    negative total runtime because the stopped timestamp was before the
    running timestamp (we 'started' but never stopped the event -- because
    it never really started we didn't have to stop it either).

    perf: Fix fasync handling on inherited events
    
    commit fed66e2cdd4f127a43fd11b8d92a99bdd429528c upstream.
    
    Vince reported that the fasync signal stuff doesn't work proper for
    inherited events. So fix that.
    
    Installing fasync allocates memory and sets filp->f_flags |= FASYNC,
    which upon the demise of the file descriptor ensures the allocation is
    freed and state is updated.
    
    Now for perf, we can have the events stick around for a while after the
    original FD is dead because of references from child events. So we
    cannot copy the fasync pointer around. We can however consistently use
    the parent's fasync, as that will be updated.

    rsi: Fix failure to load firmware after memory leak fix and fix the leak
    
    commit 5d5cd85ff441534a52f23f821d0a7c644d3b6cce upstream.
    
    Fixes commit eae79b4f3e82 ("rsi: fix memory leak in rsi_load_ta_instructions()")
    which stopped the driver from functioning.
    
    Firmware data has been allocated using vmalloc(), resulting in memory
    that cannot be used for DMA. Hence the firmware was first copied to a
    buffer allocated with kmalloc() in the original code. This patch reverts
    the commit and only calls "kfree()" to release the buffer after sending
    the data. This fixes the memory leak without breaking the driver.
    
    Add a comment to the kmemdup() calls to explain why this is done, and abort
    if memory allocation fails.
    
    Tested on a Topic Miami-Florida board which contains the rsi SDIO chip.
    
    Also added the same kfree() call to the USB glue driver. This was not
    tested on actual hardware though, as I only have the SDIO version.

    commit 7b0767502b5db11cb1f0daef2d01f6d71b1192dc upstream.
    
    We should consider info->feature_persistent when adding indirect page to list
    info->indirect_pages, else the BUG_ON() in blkif_free() would be triggered.
    
    When we are using persistent grants the indirect_pages list
    should always be empty because blkfront has pre-allocated enough
    persistent pages to fill all requests on the ring.

    clk: pxa: pxa3xx: fix CKEN register access
    
    commit b93028c9af807b9474789e6aba34a6135b6cb708 upstream.
    
    Clocks 0 to 31 are on CKENA, and not CKENB. The clock register names
    were inadequately inverted. As a consequence, all clock operations were
    happening on CKENB, because almost all but 2 clocks are on CKENA.
    
    As the clocks were activated by the bootloader in the former tests, it
    escaped the testing that the wrong clock gate was manipulated. The error
    was revealed by changing the pxa3xx-nand driver to a module, where upon
    unloading, the wrong clock was disabled in CKENB.

    ipc/sem.c: update/correct memory barriers
    
    commit 3ed1f8a99d70ea1cd1508910eb107d0edcae5009 upstream.
    
    sem_lock() did not properly pair memory barriers:
    
    !spin_is_locked() and spin_unlock_wait() are both only control barriers.
    The code needs an acquire barrier, otherwise the cpu might perform read
    operations before the lock test.
    
    As no primitive exists inside <include/spinlock.h> and since it seems
    noone wants another primitive, the code creates a local primitive within
    ipc/sem.c.
    
    With regards to -stable:
    
    The change of sem_wait_array() is a bugfix, the change to sem_lock() is a
    nop (just a preprocessor redefinition to improve the readability).  The
    bugfix is necessary for all kernels that use sem_wait_array() (i.e.:
    starting from 3.10).

    ipc,sem: fix use after free on IPC_RMID after a task using same semaphore set exits
    
    commit 602b8593d2b4138c10e922eeaafe306f6b51817b upstream.
    
    The current semaphore code allows a potential use after free: in
    exit_sem we may free the task's sem_undo_list while there is still
    another task looping through the same semaphore set and cleaning the
    sem_undo list at freeary function (the task called IPC_RMID for the same
    semaphore set).
    
    For example, with a test program [1] running which keeps forking a lot
    of processes (which then do a semop call with SEM_UNDO flag), and with
    the parent right after removing the semaphore set with IPC_RMID, and a
    kernel built with CONFIG_SLAB, CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG and
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK, you can easily see something like the following
    in the kernel log:

       Kernel panic - not syncing: softlockup: hung tasks
    
    I wasn't able to trigger any badness on a recent kernel without the
    proper config debugs enabled, however I have softlockup reports on some
    kernel versions, in the semaphore code, which are similar as above (the
    scenario is seen on some servers running IBM DB2 which uses semaphore
    syscalls).
    
    The patch here fixes the race against freeary, by acquiring or waiting
    on the sem_undo_list lock as necessary (exit_sem can race with freeary,
    while freeary sets un->semid to -1 and removes the same sem_undo from
    list_proc or when it removes the last sem_undo).
    
    After the patch I'm unable to reproduce the problem using the test case
    [1].
