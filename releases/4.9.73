    bpf/verifier: Fix states_equal() comparison of pointer and UNKNOWN
    
    An UNKNOWN_VALUE is not supposed to be derived from a pointer, unless
    pointer leaks are allowed.  Therefore, states_equal() must not treat
    a state with a pointer in a register as "equal" to a state with an
    UNKNOWN_VALUE in that register.
    
    This was fixed differently upstream, but the code around here was
    largely rewritten in 4.14 by commit f1174f77b50c "bpf/verifier: rework
    value tracking".  The bug can be detected by the bpf/verifier sub-test
    "pointer/scalar confusion in state equality check (way 1)".

    net: mvneta: eliminate wrong call to handle rx descriptor error
    
    commit 2eecb2e04abb62ef8ea7b43e1a46bdb5b99d1bf8 upstream.
    
    There are few reasons in mvneta_rx_swbm() function when received packet
    is dropped. mvneta_rx_error() should be called only if error bit [16]
    is set in rx descriptor.

    libnvdimm, pfn: fix start_pad handling for aligned namespaces
    
    commit 19deaa217bc04e83b59b5e8c8229eb0e53ad9efc upstream.
    
    The alignment checks at pfn driver startup fail to properly account for
    the 'start_pad' in the case where the namespace is misaligned relative
    to its internal alignment. This is typically triggered in 1G aligned
    namespace, but could theoretically trigger with small namespace
    alignments. When this triggers the kernel reports messages of the form:

    powerpc/perf: Dereference BHRB entries safely
    
    commit f41d84dddc66b164ac16acf3f584c276146f1c48 upstream.

    clk: sunxi: sun9i-mmc: Implement reset callback for reset controls
    
    commit 61d2f2a05765a5f57149efbd93e3e81a83cbc2c1 upstream.
    
    Our MMC host driver now issues a reset, instead of just deasserting
    the reset control, since commit c34eda69ad4c ("mmc: sunxi: Reset the
    device at probe time"). The sun9i-mmc clock driver does not support
    this, and will fail, which results in MMC not probing.
    
    This patch implements the reset callback by asserting the reset control,
    then deasserting it after a small delay.

    kvm: x86: fix RSM when PCID is non-zero
    
    commit fae1a3e775cca8c3a9e0eb34443b310871a15a92 upstream.
    
    rsm_load_state_64() and rsm_enter_protected_mode() load CR3, then
    CR4 & ~PCIDE, then CR0, then CR4.
    
    However, setting CR4.PCIDE fails if CR3[11:0] != 0.  It's probably easier
    in the long run to replace rsm_enter_protected_mode() with an emulator
    callback that sets all the special registers (like KVM_SET_SREGS would
    do).  For now, set the PCID field of CR3 only after CR4.PCIDE is 1.

    commit d2b3c353595a855794f8b9df5b5bdbe8deb0c413 upstream.
    
    Guenter Roeck reported an interrupt storm on a prototype system which is
    based on Cyan Chromebook. The root cause turned out to be a incorrectly
    configured pin that triggers spurious interrupts. This will be fixed in
    coreboot but currently we need to prevent the interrupt storm from
    happening by masking all interrupts (but not GPEs) on those systems.

    spi: xilinx: Detect stall with Unknown commands
    
    commit 5a1314fa697fc65cefaba64cd4699bfc3e6882a6 upstream.
    
    When the core is configured in C_SPI_MODE > 0, it integrates a
    lookup table that automatically configures the core in dual or quad mode
    based on the command (first byte on the tx fifo).
    
    Unfortunately, that list mode_?_memoy_*.mif does not contain all the
    supported commands by the flash.
    
    Since 4.14 spi-nor automatically tries to probe the flash using SFDP
    (command 0x5a), and that command is not part of the list_mode table.
    
    Whit the right combination of C_SPI_MODE and C_SPI_MEMORY this leads
    into a stall that can only be recovered with a soft rest.
    
    This patch detects this kind of stall and returns -EIO to the caller on
    those commands. spi-nor can handle this error properly:
    
    m25p80 spi0.0: Detected stall. Check C_SPI_MODE and C_SPI_MEMORY. 0x21 0x2404

    PCI / PM: Force devices to D0 in pci_pm_thaw_noirq()
    
    commit 5839ee7389e893a31e4e3c9cf17b50d14103c902 upstream.
    
    It is incorrect to call pci_restore_state() for devices in low-power
    states (D1-D3), as that involves the restoration of MSI setup which
    requires MMIO to be operational and that is only the case in D0.
    
    However, pci_pm_thaw_noirq() may do that if the driver's "freeze"
    callbacks put the device into a low-power state, so fix it by making
    it force devices into D0 via pci_set_power_state() instead of trying
    to "update" their power state which is pointless.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix the missing ctl name suffix at parsing SU
    
    commit 5a15f289ee87eaf33f13f08a4909ec99d837ec5f upstream.
    
    The commit 89b89d121ffc ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add check return value for
    usb_string()") added the check of the return value from
    snd_usb_copy_string_desc(), which is correct per se, but it introduced
    a regression.  In the original code, either the "Clock Source",
    "Playback Source" or "Capture Source" suffix is added after the
    terminal string, while the commit changed it to add the suffix only
    when get_term_name() is failing.  It ended up with an incorrect ctl
    name like "PCM" instead of "PCM Capture Source".
    
    Also, even the original code has a similar bug: when the ctl name is
    generated from snd_usb_copy_string_desc() for the given iSelector, it
    also doesn't put the suffix.
    
    This patch addresses these issues: the suffix is added always when no
    static mapping is found.  Also the patch tries to put more comments
    and cleans up the if/else block for better readability in order to
    avoid the same pitfall again.

    ALSA: rawmidi: Avoid racy info ioctl via ctl device
    
    commit c1cfd9025cc394fd137a01159d74335c5ac978ce upstream.
    
    The rawmidi also allows to obtaining the information via ioctl of ctl
    API.  It means that user can issue an ioctl to the rawmidi device even
    when it's being removed as long as the control device is present.
    Although the code has some protection via the global register_mutex,
    its range is limited to the search of the corresponding rawmidi
    object, and the mutex is already unlocked at accessing the rawmidi
    object.  This may lead to a use-after-free.
    
    For avoiding it, this patch widens the application of register_mutex
    to the whole snd_rawmidi_info_select() function.  We have another
    mutex per rawmidi object, but this operation isn't very hot path, so

    mfd: twl6040: Fix child-node lookup
    
    commit 85e9b13cbb130a3209f21bd7933933399c389ffe upstream.
    
    Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
    device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent node was prematurely freed, while the
    child node was leaked.
    
    Note that the CONFIG_OF compile guard can be removed as
    of_get_child_by_name() provides a !CONFIG_OF implementation which always
    fails.

    mfd: twl4030-audio: Fix sibling-node lookup
    
    commit 0a423772de2f3d7b00899987884f62f63ae00dcb upstream.
    
    A helper purported to look up a child node based on its name was using
    the wrong of-helper and ended up prematurely freeing the parent of-node
    while leaking any matching node.
    
    To make things worse, any matching node would not even necessarily be a
    child node as the whole device tree was searched depth-first starting at
    the parent.

    mfd: cros ec: spi: Don't send first message too soon
    
    commit 15d8374874ded0bec37ef27f8301a6d54032c0e5 upstream.
    
    On the Tegra124 Nyan-Big chromebook the very first SPI message sent to
    the EC is failing.
    
    The Tegra SPI driver configures the SPI chip-selects to be active-high
    by default (and always has for many years). The EC SPI requires an
    active-low chip-select and so the Tegra chip-select is reconfigured to
    be active-low when the EC SPI driver calls spi_setup(). The problem is
    that if the first SPI message to the EC is sent too soon after
    reconfiguring the SPI chip-select, it fails.
    
    The EC SPI driver prevents back-to-back SPI messages being sent too
    soon by keeping track of the time the last transfer was sent via the
    variable 'last_transfer_ns'. To prevent the very first transfer being
    sent too soon, initialise the 'last_transfer_ns' variable after calling
    spi_setup() and before sending the first SPI message.

    crypto: mcryptd - protect the per-CPU queue with a lock
    
    commit 9abffc6f2efe46c3564c04312e52e07622d40e51 upstream.
    
    mcryptd_enqueue_request() grabs the per-CPU queue struct and protects
    access to it with disabled preemption. Then it schedules a worker on the
    same CPU. The worker in mcryptd_queue_worker() guards access to the same
    per-CPU variable with disabled preemption.
    
    If we take CPU-hotplug into account then it is possible that between
    queue_work_on() and the actual invocation of the worker the CPU goes
    down and the worker will be scheduled on _another_ CPU. And here the
    preempt_disable() protection does not work anymore. The easiest thing is
    to add a spin_lock() to guard access to the list.
    
    Another detail: mcryptd_queue_worker() is not processing more than
    MCRYPTD_BATCH invocation in a row. If there are still items left, then
    it will invoke queue_work() to proceed with more later. *I* would
    suggest to simply drop that check because it does not use a system
    workqueue and the workqueue is already marked as "CPU_INTENSIVE". And if
    preemption is required then the scheduler should do it.
    However if queue_work() is used then the work item is marked as CPU
    unbound. That means it will try to run on the local CPU but it may run
    on another CPU as well. Especially with CONFIG_DEBUG_WQ_FORCE_RR_CPU=y.
    Again, the preempt_disable() won't work here but lock which was
    introduced will help.
    In order to keep work-item on the local CPU (and avoid RR) I changed it
    to queue_work_on().

    acpi, nfit: fix health event notification
    
    commit adf6895754e2503d994a765535fd1813f8834674 upstream.
    
    Integration testing with a BIOS that generates injected health event
    notifications fails to communicate those events to userspace. The nfit
    driver neglects to link the ACPI DIMM device with the necessary driver
    data so acpi_nvdimm_notify() fails this lookup:
    
            nfit_mem = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
            if (nfit_mem && nfit_mem->flags_attr)
                    sysfs_notify_dirent(nfit_mem->flags_attr);
    
    Add the necessary linkage when installing the notification handler and
    clean it up when the nfit driver instance is torn down.

    ACPI: APEI / ERST: Fix missing error handling in erst_reader()
    
    commit bb82e0b4a7e96494f0c1004ce50cec3d7b5fb3d1 upstream.
    
    The commit f6f828513290 ("pstore: pass allocated memory region back to
    caller") changed the check of the return value from erst_read() in
    erst_reader() in the following way:
    
            if (len == -ENOENT)
                    goto skip;
    -       else if (len < 0) {
    -               rc = -1;
    +       else if (len < sizeof(*rcd)) {
    +               rc = -EIO;
                    goto out;
    
    This introduced another bug: since the comparison with sizeof() is
    cast to unsigned, a negative len value doesn't hit any longer.
    As a result, when an error is returned from erst_read(), the code
    falls through, and it may eventually lead to some weird thing like
    memory corruption.
    
    This patch adds the negative error value check more explicitly for
    addressing the issue.
