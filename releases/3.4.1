    i2c: tegra: notify transfer-complete after clearing status.
    
    commit c889e91d2cc22123f20f40dde0c0a91856a20eea upstream.
    
    The notification of the transfer complete by calling complete()
    should be done after clearing all interrupt status.
    This avoids the race condition of misconfigure the i2c controller
    in multi-core environment.

    MCE: Fix vm86 handling for 32bit mce handler
    
    commit a129a7c84582629741e5fa6f40026efcd7a65bd4 upstream.
    
    When running on 32bit the mce handler could misinterpret
    vm86 mode as ring 0. This can affect whether it does recovery
    or not; it was possible to panic when recovery was actually
    possible.
    
    Fix this by always forcing vm86 to look like ring 3.

    ARM: 7409/1: Do not call flush_cache_user_range with mmap_sem held
    
    commit 435a7ef52db7d86e67a009b36cac1457f8972391 upstream.
    
    We can't be holding the mmap_sem while calling flush_cache_user_range
    because the flush can fault. If we fault on a user address, the
    page fault handler will try to take mmap_sem again. Since both places
    acquire the read lock, most of the time it succeeds. However, if another
    thread tries to acquire the write lock on the mmap_sem (e.g. mmap) in
    between the call to flush_cache_user_range and the fault, the down_read
    in do_page_fault will deadlock.

    x86, relocs: Add jiffies and jiffies_64 to the relative whitelist
    
    commit ea17e7414bc62e8d3bde8d08e3df1d921c518c17 upstream.
    
    The symbol jiffies is created in the linker script as an alias to
    jiffies_64.  Unfortunately this is done outside any section, and
    apparently GNU ld 2.21 doesn't carry the section with it, so we end up
    with an absolute symbol and therefore a broken kernel.
    
    Add jiffies and jiffies_64 to the whitelist.
    
    The most disturbing bit with this discovery is that it shows that we
    have had multiple linker bugs in this area crossing multiple
    generations, and have been silently building bad kernels for some time.

    x86-32, relocs: Whitelist more symbols for ld bug workaround
    
    commit fd952815307f0f272bf49fd364a7fd2f9992bc42 upstream.
    
    As noted in checkin:
    
    a3e854d95 x86, relocs: Workaround for binutils 2.22.52.0.1 section bug
    
    ld version 2.22.52.0.[12] can incorrectly promote relative symbols to
    absolute, if the output section they appear in is otherwise empty.
    
    Since checkin:
    
    6520fe55 x86, realmode: 16-bit real-mode code support for relocs tool
    
    we actually check for this and error out rather than silently creating
    a kernel which will malfunction if relocated.
    
    Ingo found a configuration in which __start_builtin_fw triggered the
    warning.
    
    Go through the linker script sources and look for more symbols that
    could plausibly get bogusly promoted to absolute, and add them to the
    whitelist.
    
    In general, if the following error triggers:
    
            Invalid absolute R_386_32 relocation: <symbol>
    
    ... then we should verify that <symbol> is really meant to be
    relocated, and add it and any related symbols manually to the S_REL
    regexp.
    
    Please note that 6520fe55 does not introduce the error, only the check
    for the error -- without 6520fe55 this version of ld will simply
    produce a corrupt kernel if CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set on x86-32.

    xen: do not map the same GSI twice in PVHVM guests.
    
    commit 68c2c39a76b094e9b2773e5846424ea674bf2c46 upstream.
    
    PV on HVM guests map GSIs into event channels. At restore time the
    event channels are resumed by restore_pirqs.
    
    Device drivers might try to register the same GSI again through ACPI at
    restore time, but the GSI has already been mapped and bound by
    restore_pirqs. This patch detects these situations and avoids
     mapping the same GSI multiple times.
    
    Without this patch we get:
    (XEN) irq.c:2235: dom4: pirq 23 or emuirq 28 already mapped
    and waste a pirq.

    to be the master's device pointer instead of his parent.
    
    This introduced a bug in spi-fsl-spi, since its usage of spi device
    pointer was not updated accordingly. This was later fixed by commit
    5039a86, "spi/mpc83xx: fix NULL pdata dereference bug", but it missed
    another spot on fsl_spi_cs_control function where we also need to update
    usage of spi device pointer. This change address that.

    drm/i915: [GEN7] Use HW scheduler for fixed function shaders
    
    commit a1e969e0332de7a430e62822cee8f2ec8d83cd7c upstream.
    
    This originally started as a patch from Bernard as a way of simply
    setting the VS scheduler. After submitting the RFC patch, we decided to
    also modify the DS scheduler. To be most explicit, I've made the patch
    explicitly set all scheduler modes, and included the defines for other
    modes (in case someone feels frisky later).
    
    The rest of the story gets a bit weird. The first version of the patch
    showed an almost unbelievable performance improvement. Since rebasing my
    branch it appears the performance improvement has gone, unfortunately.
    But setting these bits seem to be the right thing to do given that the
    docs describe corruption that can occur with the default settings.
    
    In summary, I am seeing no more perf improvements (or regressions) in my
    limited testing, but we believe this should be set to prevent rendering
    corruption, therefore cc stable.
    
    v1: Clear bit 4 also (Ken + Eugeni)
    Do a full clear + set of the bits we want (Me).

    commit 9adab8b5a7fde248504f484e197589f3e3c922e2 upstream.
    
    Currently the code re-reads PCH_IIR during the hotplug interrupt
    processing. Not only is this a wasted read, but introduces a potential
    for handling a spurious interrupt as we then may not clear all the
    interrupts processed (since the re-read IIR may contains more interrupts
    asserted than we clear using the result of the original read).

    USB2 LPM is disabled when device begin to suspend and enabled after device
    is resumed. That's because USB spec does not define the transition from
    U1/U2 state to U3 state.
    
    If usb_port_suspend() fails, usb_port_resume() is never called, and USB2 LPM
    is disabled in this situation. Enable USB2 LPM if port suspend fails.

    xhci: Add new short TX quirk for Fresco Logic host.
    
    commit 1530bbc6272d9da1e39ef8e06190d42c13a02733 upstream.
    
    Sergio reported that when he recorded audio from a USB headset mic
    plugged into the USB 3.0 port on his ASUS N53SV-DH72, the audio sounded
    "robotic".  When plugged into the USB 2.0 port under EHCI on the same
    laptop, the audio sounded fine.  The device is:
    
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 046d:0a0c Logitech, Inc. Clear Chat Comfort USB Headset
    
    The problem was tracked down to the Fresco Logic xHCI host controller
    not correctly reporting short transfers on isochronous IN endpoints.
    The driver would submit a 96 byte transfer, the device would only send
    88 or 90 bytes, and the xHCI host would report the transfer had a
    "successful" completion code, with an untransferred buffer length of 8
    or 6 bytes.
    
    The successful completion code and non-zero untransferred length is a
    contradiction.  The xHCI host is supposed to only mark a transfer as
    successful if all the bytes are transferred.  Otherwise, the transfer
    should be marked with a short packet completion code.  Without the EHCI
    bus trace, we wouldn't know whether the xHCI driver should trust the
    completion code or the untransferred length.  With it, we know to trust
    the untransferred length.
    
    Add a new xHCI quirk for the Fresco Logic host controller.  If a
    transfer is reported as successful, but the untransferred length is
    non-zero, print a warning.  For the Fresco Logic host, change the
    completion code to COMP_SHORT_TX and process the transfer like a short
    transfer.
    
    This should be backported to stable kernels that contain the commit
    f5182b4155b9d686c5540a6822486400e34ddd98 "xhci: Disable MSI for some
    Fresco Logic hosts."  That commit was marked for stable kernels as old

    xhci: Reset reserved command ring TRBs on cleanup.
    
    commit 33b2831ac870d50cc8e01c317b07fb1e69c13fe1 upstream.
    
    When the xHCI driver needs to clean up memory (perhaps due to a failed
    register restore on resume from S3 or resume from S4), it needs to reset
    the number of reserved TRBs on the command ring to zero.  Otherwise,
    several resume cycles (about 30) with a UAS device attached will
    continually increment the number of reserved TRBs, until all command
    submissions fail because there isn't enough room on the command ring.

    usb-xhci: Handle COMP_TX_ERR for isoc tds
    
    commit 9c745995ae5c4ff787f34a359de908facc11ee00 upstream.
    
    While testing unplugging an UVC HD webcam with usb-redirection (so through
    usbdevfs), my userspace usb-redir code was getting a value of -1 in
    iso_frame_desc[n].status, which according to Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt
    is not a valid value.
    
    The source of this -1 is the default case in xhci-ring.c:process_isoc_td()
    adding a kprintf there showed the value of trb_comp_code to be COMP_TX_ERR
    in this case, so this patch adds handling for that completion code to
    process_isoc_td().
    
    This was observed and tested with the following xhci controller:
    1033:0194 NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller (rev 04)
    
    Note: I also wonder if setting frame->status to -1 (-EPERM) is the best we can
    do, but since I cannot come up with anything better I've left that as is.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, which contain the

    commit 51c9e6c7732b67769c0a514d31f505e49fa82dd4 upstream.
    
    If the user chooses to say "no" to CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD on a system
    with an Intel Panther Point chipset, the PCI quirks code or the EHCI
    driver will switch the ports over to the xHCI host, but the xHCI driver
    will never load.  The ports will be powered off and seem "dead" to the
    user.
    
    Fix this by only switching the ports over if CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD is
    either compiled in, or compiled as a module.

    This commit adds a bit-array to xhci bus_state for keeping track of
    which ports are undergoing a resume transition. If any of the bits
    are set when xhci_hub_status_data() is called, the routine will return
    a non-zero value even if no ports have any status changes pending.

    The upcoming Intel Lynx Point chipset includes an xHCI host controller
    that can have ports switched from the EHCI host controller, just like
    the Intel Panther Point xHCI host.  This time, ports from both EHCI
    hosts can be switched to the xHCI host controller.  The PCI config
    registers to do the port switching are in the exact same place in the
    xHCI PCI configuration registers, with the same semantics.

    dTD's next dtd pointer need to be updated once CPU writes it, or this

    This problem occurs when there is a request is handling, we need to add
    a new request to dTD list, if this new request is added before the current
    one is finished, the new request is intended to added as next dtd pointer
    at current dTD, but without wmb(), the dTD's next dtd pointer may not be
    updated when the controller reads it. In that case, the controller will
    still get Terminate Bit is 1 at dTD's next dtd pointer, that means there is
    no next request, then this new request is missed by controller.

    USB: ohci-at91: add a reset function to fix race condition
    
    commit 07e4e556eff4938eb2edf2591de3aa7d7fb82b52 upstream.
    
    A possible race condition appears because we are not initializing
    the ohci->regs before calling usb_hcd_request_irqs().
    We move the call to ohci_init() in hcd->driver->reset() instead of
    hcd->driver->start() to fix this.
    This was experienced when we share the same IRQ line between OHCI and EHCI
    controllers.

    USB: gpio_vbus: provide an appropriate debounce interval
    
    commit 934ccec4da14dc0586dfe08b36166364bdd2181b upstream.
    
    In commit c2344f13b59e007d782a3e591ebc551bc583a8b7 (USB: gpio_vbus:
    add delayed vbus_session calls, 2009-01-24), usb_gadget_vbus_connect()
    and ...disconnect() were extracted from the interrupt handler, so to
    allow vbus_session handlers to deal with msleep() calls.
    
    This patch takes the approach one step further.
    
    USB2.0 specification (7.1.7.3 Connect and Disconnect Signaling) says
    that the USB system software (shall) provide a debounce interval with
    a minimum duration of 100 ms, which ensures that the electrical and
    mechanical connection is stable before software attempts to reset
    the attached device.

    USB: EHCI: OMAP: Finish ehci omap phy reset cycle before adding hcd.
    
    commit 3aa2ae74ba630ec9b98736d64aea8e4cb490861d upstream.
    
    'ARM: OMAP3: USB: Fix the EHCI ULPI PHY reset issue' (1fcb57d0f) created a regression
    with Beagleboard xM if booting the kernel after running 'usb start' under u-boot.
    
    Finishing the reset before calling 'usb_add_hcd' fixes the regression. This is most likely due to
    usb_add_hcd calling the driver's reset and init functions which expect the hardware to be
    up and running.

    usb-serial: ftdi_sio: fix oops during autosuspend
    
    commit 5cbe61c5aff0a8ada691eb8b07dbfb55c303f640 upstream.
    
    This patch (as1550) fixes a bug in the usb-serial core that affects
    the ftdi_sio driver and most likely others as well.  The core
    implements suspend and resume routines, but it doesn't store pointers
    to those routines in the usb_driver structures that it registers,
    even though it does set those drivers' supports_autosuspend flag.  The
    end result is that when one of these devices is autosuspended, we try
    to call through a NULL pointer.
    
    The patch fixes the problem by setting the suspend and resume method
    pointers to the appropriate routines in the USB serial core, along
    with the supports_autosuspend field, in each driver as it is
    registered.
    
    This should be back-ported to all the stable kernels that have the new
    usb_serial_register_drivers() interface.

    8250.c: less than 2400 baud fix.
    
    commit f9a9111b540fd67db5dab332f4b83d86c90e27b1 upstream.
    
    We noticed that we were loosing data at speed less than 2400 baud.
    It turned out our (TI16750 compatible) uart with 64 byte outgoing fifo
    was truncated to 16 byte (bit 5 sets fifo len) when modifying the fcr
    reg.
    The input code still fills the buffer with 64 bytes if I remember
    correctly and thus data is lost.
    Our fix was to remove whiping of the fcr content and just add the
    TRIGGER_1 which we want for latency.
    I can't see why this would not work on less than 2400 always, for all
    uarts ...
    Otherwise one would have to make sure the filling of the fifo re-checks
    the current state of available fifo size (urrk).

    This implied a reference counting bug and the problem happened during
    mbind().
    
    mbind() applies a new memory policy to a range and uses mbind_range() to
    merge existing VMAs or split them as necessary.  In the event of splits,
    mpol_dup() will allocate a new struct mempolicy and maintain existing
    reference counts whose rules are documented in
    Documentation/vm/numa_memory_policy.txt .
    
    The problem occurs with shared memory policies.  The vm_op->set_policy
    increments the reference count if necessary and split_vma() and
    vma_merge() have already handled the existing reference counts.
    However, policy_vma() screws it up by replacing an existing
    vma->vm_policy with one that potentially has the wrong reference count
    leading to a premature free.  This patch removes the damage caused by
    policy_vma().
    
    With this patch applied Dave's trinity tool runs an mbind test for 5
    minutes without error.  /proc/slabinfo reported that there are no
    numa_policy or shared_policy_node objects allocated after the test
    completed and the shared memory region was deleted.

    workqueue: skip nr_running sanity check in worker_enter_idle() if trustee is active
    
    commit 544ecf310f0e7f51fa057ac2a295fc1b3b35a9d3 upstream.
    
    worker_enter_idle() has WARN_ON_ONCE() which triggers if nr_running
    isn't zero when every worker is idle.  This can trigger spuriously
    while a cpu is going down due to the way trustee sets %WORKER_ROGUE
    and zaps nr_running.
    
    It first sets %WORKER_ROGUE on all workers without updating
    nr_running, releases gcwq->lock, schedules, regrabs gcwq->lock and
    then zaps nr_running.  If the last running worker enters idle
    inbetween, it would see stale nr_running which hasn't been zapped yet
    and trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE().
    
    Fix it by performing the sanity check iff the trustee is idle.

    USB: cdc-wdm: cannot use dev_printk when device is gone
    
    commit 6b0b79d38806481c1c8fffa7c5842f3c83679a42 upstream.
    
    We cannot dereference a removed USB interface for
    dev_printk. Use pr_debug instead where necessary.
    
    Flush errors are expected if device is unplugged and are
    therefore best ingored at this point.
    
    Move the kill_urbs() call in wdm_release with dev_dbg()
    for the non disconnect, as we know it has already been
    called if WDM_DISCONNECTING is set.  This does not
    actually fix anything, but keeps the code more consistent.

    persistent_ram: Fix buffer size clamping during writes
    
    commit 484dd30e016eb425b0de871357fff2c9bb93be45 upstream.
    
    This is a longstanding bug, almost unnoticeable when calling
    persistent_ram_write() for small buffers.
    
    But when called for large data buffers, the write routine behaves
    incorrectly, as the size may never update: instead of clamping
    the size to the maximum buffer size, buffer_size_add_clamp() returns
    an error (which is never checked by the write routine, btw).
    
    To fix this, we now use buffer_size_add() that actually clamps the
    size to the max value.
    
    Also remove buffer_size_add_clamp(), it is no longer needed.

    UML uses the _PAGE_NEWPAGE flag to mark pages which are not jet
    installed on the host side using mmap().
    pte_same() has to ignore this flag, otherwise unuse_pte_range()
    is unable to unuse the page because two identical
    page tables entries with different _PAGE_NEWPAGE flags would not
    match and swapoff() would never return.

    HID: logitech: read all 32 bits of report type bitfield
    
    commit 44d27f7dfedd9aadc082cda31462f6600f56e4ec upstream.
    
    On big-endian systems (e.g., Apple PowerBook), trying to use a
    logitech wireless mouse with the Logitech Unifying Receiver does not
    work with v3.2 and later kernels.  The device doesn't show up in
    /dev/input.  Older kernels work fine.
    
    That is because the new hid-logitech-dj driver claims the device.  The
    device arrival notification appears:
    
            20 00 41 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    
    and we read the report_types bitfield (02 00 00 00) to find out what
    kind of device it is.  Unfortunately the driver only reads the first 8
    bits and treats that value as a 32-bit little-endian number, so on a
    powerpc the report type seems to be 0x02000000 and is not recognized.
    
    Even on little-endian machines, connecting a media center remote
    control (report type 00 01 00 00) with this driver loaded would
    presumably fail for the same reason.
    
    Fix both problems by using get_unaligned_le32() to read all four
    bytes, which is a little clearer anyway.  After this change, the
    wireless mouse works on Hugo's PowerBook again.
    
    Based on a patch by Nestor Lopez Casado.

    usbhid: prevent deadlock during timeout
    
    commit 8815bb09af21316aeb5f8948b24ac62181670db2 upstream.
    
    On some HCDs usb_unlink_urb() can directly call the
    completion handler. That limits the spinlocks that can
    be taken in the handler to locks not held while calling
    usb_unlink_urb()
    To prevent a race with resubmission, this patch exposes
    usbcore's infrastructure for blocking submission, uses it
    and so drops the lock without causing a race in usbhid.

    KEYS: Use the compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 compat
    
    commit 45de6767dc51358a188f75dc4ad9dfddb7fb9480 upstream.
    
    Use the 32-bit compat keyctl() syscall wrapper on Sparc64 for Sparc32 binary
    compatibility.
    
    Without this, keyctl(KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV) is liable to malfunction as it
    uses an iovec array read from userspace - though the kernel should survive this
    as it checks pointers and sizes anyway.
    
    I think all the other keyctl() function should just work, provided (a) the top
    32-bits of each 64-bit argument register are cleared prior to invoking the
    syscall routine, and the 32-bit address space is right at the 0-end of the
    64-bit address space.  Most of the arguments are 32-bit anyway, and so for
    those clearing is not required.

    powerpc: Fix broken cpu_idle_wait() implementation
    
    commit 9cd75e13de2dcf32ecc21c7f277cff3c0ced059e upstream.
    
    commit 771dae818 (powerpc/cpuidle: Add cpu_idle_wait() to allow
    switching of idle routines) implemented cpu_idle_wait() for powerpc.
    
    The changelog says:
     "The equivalent routine for x86 is in arch/x86/kernel/process.c
      but the powerpc implementation is different.":
    
    Unfortunately the changelog is completely useless as it does not tell
    _WHY_ it is different.
    
    Aside of being different the implementation is patently wrong.
    
    The rescheduling IPI is async. That means that there is no guarantee,
    that the other cores have executed the IPI when cpu_idle_wait()
    returns. But that's the whole purpose of this function: to guarantee
    that no CPU uses the old idle handler anymore.
    
    Use the smp_functional_call() based implementation, which fulfils the
    requirements.
    
    [ This code is going to replaced by a core version to remove all the
      pointless copies in arch/*, but this one should go to stable ]

    SCSI: mpt2sas: Fix for panic happening because of improper memory allocation
    
    commit e42fafc25fa86c61824e8d4c5e7582316415d24f upstream.
    
    The ioc->pfacts member in the IOC structure is getting set to zero
    following a call to _base_get_ioc_facts due to the memset in that routine.
    So if the ioc->pfacts was read after a host reset, there would be a NULL
    pointer dereference. The routine _base_get_ioc_facts is called from context
    of host reset.  The problem in _base_get_ioc_facts  is the size of
    Mpi2IOCFactsReply is 64, whereas the sizeof "struct mpt2sas_facts" is 60,
    so there is a four byte overflow resulting from the memset.
    
    Also, there is memset in _base_get_port_facts using the incorrect structure,
    it should be "struct mpt2sas_port_facts" instead of Mpi2PortFactsReply.

    would change the state from TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to TASK_RUNNING again.
    
    This race was always present in the pfault interrupt code but didn't
    cause anything harmful before commit f2db2e6c "[S390] pfault: cpu hotplug
    vs missing completion interrupts" which relied on the fact that after
    setting the task state to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE the task would really
    sleep.
    Since this is not necessarily the case the result may be a list corruption
    of the pfault_list or, as observed, a use-after-free bug while trying to
    access the task_struct of a task which terminated itself already.
    
    To fix this, we need to get a reference of the affected task when receiving
    the initial pfault interrupt and add special handling if we receive yet
    another initial pfault interrupt when the task is already enqueued in the
    pfault list.

    Fix blocking allocations called very early during bootup
    
    commit 31a67102f4762df5544bc2dfb34a931233d2a5b2 upstream.
    
    During early boot, when the scheduler hasn't really been fully set up,
    we really can't do blocking allocations because with certain (dubious)
    configurations the "might_resched()" calls can actually result in
    scheduling events.
    
    We could just make such users always use GFP_ATOMIC, but quite often the
    code that does the allocation isn't really aware of the fact that the
    scheduler isn't up yet, and forcing that kind of random knowledge on the
    initialization code is just annoying and not good for anybody.
    
    And we actually have a the 'gfp_allowed_mask' exactly for this reason:
    it's just that the kernel init sequence happens to set it to allow
    blocking allocations much too early.
    
    So move the 'gfp_allowed_mask' initialization from 'start_kernel()'
    (which is some of the earliest init code, and runs with preemption
    disabled for good reasons) into 'kernel_init()'.  kernel_init() is run
    in the newly created thread that will become the 'init' process, as
    opposed to the early startup code that runs within the context of what
    will be the first idle thread.
    
    So by the time we reach 'kernel_init()', we know that the scheduler must
    be at least limping along, because we've already scheduled from the idle
    thread into the init thread.

    cfg80211: warn if db.txt is empty with CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB
    
    commit 80007efeff0568375b08faf93c7aad65602cb97e upstream.
    
    It has happened twice now where elaborate troubleshooting has
    undergone on systems where CONFIG_CFG80211_INTERNAL_REGDB [0]
    has been set but yet net/wireless/db.txt was not updated.
    
    Despite the documentation on this it seems system integrators could
    use some more help with this, so throw out a kernel warning at boot time
    when their database is empty.
    
    This does mean that the error-prone system integrator won't likely
    realize the issue until they boot the machine but -- it does not seem
    to make sense to enable a build bug breaking random build testing.

    vfs: make AIO use the proper rw_verify_area() area helpers
    
    commit a70b52ec1aaeaf60f4739edb1b422827cb6f3893 upstream.
    
    We had for some reason overlooked the AIO interface, and it didn't use
    the proper rw_verify_area() helper function that checks (for example)
    mandatory locking on the file, and that the size of the access doesn't
    cause us to overflow the provided offset limits etc.
    
    Instead, AIO did just the security_file_permission() thing (that
    rw_verify_area() also does) directly.
    
    This fixes it to do all the proper helper functions, which not only
    means that now mandatory file locking works with AIO too, we can
    actually remove lines of code.

    isdn/gigaset: improve error handling querying firmware version
    
    commit e055d03dc088a990fe5ea24a2d64033a168da23c upstream.
    
    An out-of-place "OK" response to the "AT+GMR" (get firmware version)
    command turns out to be, more often than not, a delayed response to
    a previous command rather than an actual error, so continue waiting
    for the version number in that case.

    isdn/gigaset: fix CAPI disconnect B3 handling
    
    commit 62a1cfe052346b96a552b6a9178d412c709711bb upstream.
    
    If DISCONNECT_B3_IND was synthesized because of a DISCONNECT_REQ
    with existing logical connections, the connection state wasn't
    updated accordingly. Also the emitted DISCONNECT_B3_IND message
    wasn't included in the debug log as requested.
    This patch fixes both of these issues.
