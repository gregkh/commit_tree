    netfilter: nf_conntrack_dccp: fix skb_header_pointer API usages
    
    commit b22f5126a24b3b2f15448c3f2a254fc10cbc2b92 upstream.
    
    Some occurences in the netfilter tree use skb_header_pointer() in
    the following way ...
    
      struct dccp_hdr _dh, *dh;
      ...
      skb_header_pointer(skb, dataoff, sizeof(_dh), &dh);
    
    ... where dh itself is a pointer that is being passed as the copy
    buffer. Instead, we need to use &_dh as the forth argument so that
    we're copying the data into an actual buffer that sits on the stack.
    
    Currently, we probably could overwrite memory on the stack (e.g.
    with a possibly mal-formed DCCP packet), but unintentionally, as
    we only want the buffer to be placed into _dh variable.

    mm: close PageTail race
    
    commit 668f9abbd4334e6c29fa8acd71635c4f9101caa7 upstream.
    
    Commit bf6bddf1924e ("mm: introduce compaction and migration for
    ballooned pages") introduces page_count(page) into memory compaction
    which dereferences page->first_page if PageTail(page).
    
    This results in a very rare NULL pointer dereference on the
    aforementioned page_count(page).  Indeed, anything that does
    compound_head(), including page_count() is susceptible to racing with
    prep_compound_page() and seeing a NULL or dangling page->first_page
    pointer.
    
    This patch uses Andrea's implementation of compound_trans_head() that
    deals with such a race and makes it the default compound_head()
    implementation.  This includes a read memory barrier that ensures that
    if PageTail(head) is true that we return a head page that is neither
    NULL nor dangling.  The patch then adds a store memory barrier to
    prep_compound_page() to ensure page->first_page is set.
    
    This is the safest way to ensure we see the head page that we are
    expecting, PageTail(page) is already in the unlikely() path and the
    memory barriers are unfortunately required.
    
    Hugetlbfs is the exception, we don't enforce a store memory barrier
    during init since no race is possible.

    x86: fix boot on uniprocessor systems
    
    commit 825600c0f20e595daaa7a6dd8970f84fa2a2ee57 upstream.
    
    On x86 uniprocessor systems topology_physical_package_id() returns -1
    which causes rapl_cpu_prepare() to leave rapl_pmu variable uninitialized
    which leads to GPF in rapl_pmu_init().
    
    See arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event_intel_rapl.c.
    
    It turns out that physical_package_id and core_id can actually be
    retreived for uniprocessor systems too.  Enabling them also fixes
    rapl_pmu code.

    Input: cypress_ps2 - don't report as a button pads
    
    commit 6797b39e6f6f34c74177736e146406e894b9482b upstream.
    
    The cypress PS/2 trackpad models supported by the cypress_ps2 driver
    emulate BTN_RIGHT events in firmware based on the finger position, as part
    of this no motion events are sent when the finger is in the button area.
    
    The INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property is there to indicate to userspace that
    BTN_RIGHT events should be emulated in userspace, which is not necessary
    in this case.
    
    When INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD is advertised userspace will wait for a motion
    event before propagating the button event higher up the stack, as it needs
    current abs x + y data for its BTN_RIGHT emulation. Since in the
    cypress_ps2 pads don't report motion events in the button area, this means
    that clicks in the button area end up being ignored, so
    INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD actually causes problems for these touchpads, and
    removing it fixes:

    Input: synaptics - add manual min/max quirk
    
    commit 421e08c41fda1f0c2ff6af81a67b491389b653a5 upstream.
    
    The new Lenovo Haswell series (-40's) contains a new Synaptics touchpad.
    However, these new Synaptics devices report bad axis ranges.
    Under Windows, it is not a problem because the Windows driver uses RMI4
    over SMBus to talk to the device. Under Linux, we are using the PS/2
    fallback interface and it occurs the reported ranges are wrong.
    
    Of course, it would be too easy to have only one range for the whole
    series, each touchpad seems to be calibrated in a different way.
    
    We can not use SMBus to get the actual range because I suspect the firmware
    will switch into the SMBus mode and stop talking through PS/2 (this is the
    case for hybrid HID over I2C / PS/2 Synaptics touchpads).
    
    So as a temporary solution (until RMI4 land into upstream), start a new
    list of quirks with the min/max manually set.

    commit e4dbedc7eac7da9db363a36f2bd4366962eeefcc upstream.
    
    We should not be using static variable mousedev_mix in methods that can be
    called before that singleton gets assigned. While at it let's add open and
    close methods to mousedev structure so that we do not need to test if we
    are dealing with multiplexor or normal device and simply call appropriate
    method directly.

    ext4: atomically set inode->i_flags in ext4_set_inode_flags()
    
    commit 00a1a053ebe5febcfc2ec498bd894f035ad2aa06 upstream.
    
    Use cmpxchg() to atomically set i_flags instead of clearing out the
    S_IMMUTABLE, S_APPEND, etc. flags and then setting them from the
    EXT4_IMMUTABLE_FL, EXT4_APPEND_FL flags, since this opens up a race
    where an immutable file has the immutable flag cleared for a brief
    window of time.
