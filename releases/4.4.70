    drivers: char: mem: Check for address space wraparound with mmap()
    
    commit b299cde245b0b76c977f4291162cf668e087b408 upstream.
    
    /dev/mem currently allows mmap() mappings that wrap around the end of
    the physical address space, which should probably be illegal. It
    circumvents the existing STRICT_DEVMEM permission check because the loop
    immediately terminates (as the start address is already higher than the
    end address). On the x86_64 architecture it will then cause a panic
    (from the BUG(start >= end) in arch/x86/mm/pat.c:reserve_memtype()).
    
    This patch adds an explicit check to make sure offset + size will not
    wrap around in the physical address type.

    nfsd: encoders mustn't use unitialized values in error cases
    
    commit f961e3f2acae94b727380c0b74e2d3954d0edf79 upstream.
    
    In error cases, lgp->lg_layout_type may be out of bounds; so we
    shouldn't be using it until after the check of nfserr.
    
    This was seen to crash nfsd threads when the server receives a LAYOUTGET
    request with a large layout type.
    
    GETDEVICEINFO has the same problem.

    drm/edid: Add 10 bpc quirk for LGD 764 panel in HP zBook 17 G2
    
    commit e345da82bd6bdfa8492f80b3ce4370acfd868d95 upstream.
    
    The builtin eDP panel in the HP zBook 17 G2 supports 10 bpc,
    as advertised by the Laptops product specs and verified via
    injecting a fixed edid + photometer measurements, but edid
    reports unknown depth, so drivers fall back to 6 bpc.
    
    Add a quirk to get the full 10 bpc.

    PCI: Freeze PME scan before suspending devices
    
    commit ea00353f36b64375518662a8ad15e39218a1f324 upstream.
    
    Laurent Pinchart reported that the Renesas R-Car H2 Lager board (r8a7790)
    crashes during suspend tests.  Geert Uytterhoeven managed to reproduce the
    issue on an M2-W Koelsch board (r8a7791):
    
      It occurs when the PME scan runs, once per second.  During PME scan, the
      PCI host bridge (rcar-pci) registers are accessed while its module clock
      has already been disabled, leading to the crash.
    
    One reproducer is to configure s2ram to use "s2idle" instead of "deep"
    suspend:
    
      # echo 0 > /sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend
      # echo s2idle > /sys/power/mem_sleep
      # echo mem > /sys/power/state
    
    Another reproducer is to write either "platform" or "processors" to
    /sys/power/pm_test.  It does not (or is less likely) to happen during full
    system suspend ("core" or "none") because system suspend also disables
    timers, and thus the workqueue handling PME scans no longer runs.  Geert
    believes the issue may still happen in the small window between disabling
    module clocks and disabling timers:
    
      # echo 0 > /sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend
      # echo platform > /sys/power/pm_test    # Or "processors"
      # echo mem > /sys/power/state
    
    (Make sure CONFIG_PCI_RCAR_GEN2 and CONFIG_USB_OHCI_HCD_PCI are enabled.)
    
    Rafael Wysocki agrees that PME scans should be suspended before the host
    bridge registers become inaccessible.  To that end, queue the task on a
    workqueue that gets frozen before devices suspend.
    
    Rafael notes however that as a result, some wakeup events may be missed if
    they are delivered via PME from a device without working IRQ (which hence
    must be polled) and occur after the workqueue has been frozen.  If that
    turns out to be an issue in practice, it may be possible to solve it by
    calling pci_pme_list_scan() once directly from one of the host bridge's
    pm_ops callbacks.

    tracing/kprobes: Enforce kprobes teardown after testing
    
    commit 30e7d894c1478c88d50ce94ddcdbd7f9763d9cdd upstream.
    
    Enabling the tracer selftest triggers occasionally the warning in
    text_poke(), which warns when the to be modified page is not marked
    reserved.
    
    The reason is that the tracer selftest installs kprobes on functions marked
    __init for testing. These probes are removed after the tests, but that
    removal schedules the delayed kprobes_optimizer work, which will do the
    actual text poke. If the work is executed after the init text is freed,
    then the warning triggers. The bug can be reproduced reliably when the work
    delay is increased.
    
    Flush the optimizer work and wait for the optimizing/unoptimizing lists to
    become empty before returning from the kprobes tracer selftest. That
    ensures that all operations which were queued due to the probes removal
    have completed.

    metag/uaccess: Check access_ok in strncpy_from_user
    
    commit 3a158a62da0673db918b53ac1440845a5b64fd90 upstream.
    
    The metag implementation of strncpy_from_user() doesn't validate the src
    pointer, which could allow reading of arbitrary kernel memory. Add a
    short access_ok() check to prevent that.
    
    Its still possible for it to read across the user/kernel boundary, but
    it will invariably reach a NUL character after only 9 bytes, leaking
    only a static kernel address being loaded into D0Re0 at the beginning of
    __start, which is acceptable for the immediate fix.

    metag/uaccess: Fix access_ok()
    
    commit 8a8b56638bcac4e64cccc88bf95a0f9f4b19a2fb upstream.
    
    The __user_bad() macro used by access_ok() has a few corner cases
    noticed by Al Viro where it doesn't behave correctly:
    
     - The kernel range check has off by 1 errors which permit access to the
       first and last byte of the kernel mapped range.
    
     - The kernel range check ends at LINCORE_BASE rather than
       META_MEMORY_LIMIT, which is ineffective when the kernel is in global
       space (an extremely uncommon configuration).
    
    There are a couple of other shortcomings here too:
    
     - Access to the whole of the other address space is permitted (i.e. the
       global half of the address space when the kernel is in local space).
       This isn't ideal as it could theoretically still contain privileged
       mappings set up by the bootloader.
    
     - The size argument is unused, permitting user copies which start on
       valid pages at the end of the user address range and cross the
       boundary into the kernel address space (e.g. addr = 0x3ffffff0, size
       > 0x10).
    
    It isn't very convenient to add size checks when disallowing certain
    regions, and it seems far safer to be sure and explicit about what
    userland is able to access, so invert the logic to allow certain regions
    instead, and fix the off by 1 errors and missing size checks. This also
    allows the get_fs() == KERNEL_DS check to be more easily optimised into
    the user address range case.
    
    We now have 3 such allowed regions:
    
     - The user address range (incorporating the get_fs() == KERNEL_DS
       check).
    
     - NULL (some kernel code expects this to work, and we'll always catch
       the fault anyway).
    
     - The core code memory region.

    iommu/vt-d: Flush the IOTLB to get rid of the initial kdump mappings
    
    commit f73a7eee900e95404b61408a23a1df5c5811704c upstream.
    
    Ever since commit 091d42e43d ("iommu/vt-d: Copy translation tables from
    old kernel") the kdump kernel copies the IOMMU context tables from the
    previous kernel. Each device mappings will be destroyed once the driver
    for the respective device takes over.
    
    This unfortunately breaks the workflow of mapping and unmapping a new
    context to the IOMMU. The mapping function assumes that either:
    
    1) Unmapping did the proper IOMMU flushing and it only ever flush if the
       IOMMU unit supports caching invalid entries.
    2) The system just booted and the initialization code took care of
       flushing all IOMMU caches.
    
    This assumption is not true for the kdump kernel since the context

    mm/huge_memory.c: respect FOLL_FORCE/FOLL_COW for thp
    
    commit 8310d48b125d19fcd9521d83b8293e63eb1646aa upstream.
    
    In commit 19be0eaffa3a ("mm: remove gup_flags FOLL_WRITE games from
    __get_user_pages()"), the mm code was changed from unsetting FOLL_WRITE
    after a COW was resolved to setting the (newly introduced) FOLL_COW
    instead.  Simultaneously, the check in gup.c was updated to still allow
    writes with FOLL_FORCE set if FOLL_COW had also been set.
    
    However, a similar check in huge_memory.c was forgotten.  As a result,
    remote memory writes to ro regions of memory backed by transparent huge
    pages cause an infinite loop in the kernel (handle_mm_fault sets
    FOLL_COW and returns 0 causing a retry, but follow_trans_huge_pmd bails
    out immidiately because `(flags & FOLL_WRITE) && !pmd_write(*pmd)` is
    true.
    
    While in this state the process is stil SIGKILLable, but little else
    works (e.g.  no ptrace attach, no other signals).  This is easily
    reproduced with the following code (assuming thp are set to always):
    
        #include <assert.h>
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <stdint.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <string.h>
        #include <sys/mman.h>
        #include <sys/stat.h>
        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <sys/wait.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        #define TEST_SIZE 5 * 1024 * 1024
    
        int main(void) {
          int status;
          pid_t child;
          int fd = open("/proc/self/mem", O_RDWR);
          void *addr = mmap(NULL, TEST_SIZE, PROT_READ,
                            MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0);
          assert(addr != MAP_FAILED);
          pid_t parent_pid = getpid();
          if ((child = fork()) == 0) {
            void *addr2 = mmap(NULL, TEST_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                               MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0);
            assert(addr2 != MAP_FAILED);
            memset(addr2, 'a', TEST_SIZE);
            pwrite(fd, addr2, TEST_SIZE, (uintptr_t)addr);
            return 0;
          }
          assert(child == waitpid(child, &status, 0));
          assert(WIFEXITED(status) && WEXITSTATUS(status) == 0);
          return 0;
        }
    
    Fix this by updating follow_trans_huge_pmd in huge_memory.c analogously
    to the update in gup.c in the original commit.  The same pattern exists
    in follow_devmap_pmd.  However, we should not be able to reach that
    check with FOLL_COW set, so add WARN_ONCE to make sure we notice if we
    ever do.

    xc2028: Fix use-after-free bug properly
    
    commit 22a1e7783e173ab3d86018eb590107d68df46c11 upstream.
    
    The commit 8dfbcc4351a0 ("[media] xc2028: avoid use after free") tried
    to address the reported use-after-free by clearing the reference.
    
    However, it's clearing the wrong pointer; it sets NULL to
    priv->ctrl.fname, but it's anyway overwritten by the next line
    memcpy(&priv->ctrl, p, sizeof(priv->ctrl)).
    
    OTOH, the actual code accessing the freed string is the strcmp() call
    with priv->fname:
            if (!firmware_name[0] && p->fname &&
                priv->fname && strcmp(p->fname, priv->fname))
                    free_firmware(priv);
    
    where priv->fname points to the previous file name, and this was
    already freed by kfree().
    
    For fixing the bug properly, this patch does the following:
    
    - Keep the copy of firmware file name in only priv->fname,
      priv->ctrl.fname isn't changed;
    - The allocation is done only when the firmware gets loaded;
    - The kfree() is called in free_firmware() commonly

    arm64: documentation: document tagged pointer stack constraints
    
    commit f0e421b1bf7af97f026e1bb8bfe4c5a7a8c08f42 upstream.
    
    Some kernel features don't currently work if a task puts a non-zero
    address tag in its stack pointer, frame pointer, or frame record entries
    (FP, LR).
    
    For example, with a tagged stack pointer, the kernel can't deliver
    signals to the process, and the task is killed instead. As another
    example, with a tagged frame pointer or frame records, perf fails to
    generate call graphs or resolve symbols.
    
    For now, just document these limitations, instead of finding and fixing
    everything that doesn't work, as it's not known if anyone needs to use
    tags in these places anyway.
    
    In addition, as requested by Dave Martin, generalize the limitations
    into a general kernel address tag policy, and refactor
    tagged-pointers.txt to include it.

    arm64: uaccess: ensure extension of access_ok() addr
    
    commit a06040d7a791a9177581dcf7293941bd92400856 upstream.
    
    Our access_ok() simply hands its arguments over to __range_ok(), which
    implicitly assummes that the addr parameter is 64 bits wide. This isn't
    necessarily true for compat code, which might pass down a 32-bit address
    parameter.
    
    In these cases, we don't have a guarantee that the address has been zero
    extended to 64 bits, and the upper bits of the register may contain
    unknown values, potentially resulting in a suprious failure.
    
    Avoid this by explicitly casting the addr parameter to an unsigned long
    (as is done on other architectures), ensuring that the parameter is
    widened appropriately.

    arm64: xchg: hazard against entire exchange variable
    
    commit fee960bed5e857eb126c4e56dd9ff85938356579 upstream.
    
    The inline assembly in __XCHG_CASE() uses a +Q constraint to hazard
    against other accesses to the memory location being exchanged. However,
    the pointer passed to the constraint is a u8 pointer, and thus the
    hazard only applies to the first byte of the location.
    
    GCC can take advantage of this, assuming that other portions of the
    location are unchanged, as demonstrated with the following test case:
    
    union u {
            unsigned long l;
            unsigned int i[2];
    };
    
    unsigned long update_char_hazard(union u *u)
    {
            unsigned int a, b;
    
            a = u->i[1];
            asm ("str %1, %0" : "+Q" (*(char *)&u->l) : "r" (0UL));
            b = u->i[1];
    
            return a ^ b;
    }
    
    unsigned long update_long_hazard(union u *u)
    {
            unsigned int a, b;
    
            a = u->i[1];
            asm ("str %1, %0" : "+Q" (*(long *)&u->l) : "r" (0UL));
            b = u->i[1];
    
            return a ^ b;
    }
    
    The linaro 15.08 GCC 5.1.1 toolchain compiles the above as follows when
    using -O2 or above:
    
    0000000000000000 <update_char_hazard>:
       0:   d2800001        mov     x1, #0x0                        // #0
       4:   f9000001        str     x1, [x0]
       8:   d2800000        mov     x0, #0x0                        // #0
       c:   d65f03c0        ret
    
    0000000000000010 <update_long_hazard>:
      10:   b9400401        ldr     w1, [x0,#4]
      14:   d2800002        mov     x2, #0x0                        // #0
      18:   f9000002        str     x2, [x0]
      1c:   b9400400        ldr     w0, [x0,#4]
      20:   4a000020        eor     w0, w1, w0
      24:   d65f03c0        ret
    
    This patch fixes the issue by passing an unsigned long pointer into the
    +Q constraint, as we do for our cmpxchg code. This may hazard against
    more than is necessary, but this is better than missing a necessary
    hazard.

    powerpc/64e: Fix hang when debugging programs with relocated kernel
    
    commit fd615f69a18a9d4aa5ef02a1dc83f319f75da8e7 upstream.
    
    Debug interrupts can be taken during interrupt entry, since interrupt
    entry does not automatically turn them off.  The kernel will check
    whether the faulting instruction is between [interrupt_base_book3e,
    __end_interrupts], and if so clear MSR[DE] and return.
    
    However, when the kernel is built with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE, it can't use
    LOAD_REG_IMMEDIATE(r14,interrupt_base_book3e) and
    LOAD_REG_IMMEDIATE(r15,__end_interrupts), as they ignore relocation.
    Thus, if the kernel is actually running at a different address than it
    was built at, the address comparison will fail, and the exception entry
    code will hang at kernel_dbg_exc.
    
    r2(toc) is also not usable here, as r2 still holds data from the
    interrupted context, so LOAD_REG_ADDR() doesn't work either.  So we use
    the *name@got* to get the EV of two labels directly.
    
    Test programs test.c shows as follows:
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
            if (access("/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid", F_OK) == -1)
                    printf("Kernel doesn't have perf_event support\n");
    }
    
    Steps to reproduce the bug, for example:
     1) ./gdb ./test
     2) (gdb) b access
     3) (gdb) r
     4) (gdb) s

    powerpc/pseries: Fix of_node_put() underflow during DLPAR remove
    
    commit 68baf692c435339e6295cb470ea5545cbc28160e upstream.
    
    Historically struct device_node references were tracked using a kref embedded as
    a struct field. Commit 75b57ecf9d1d ("of: Make device nodes kobjects so they
    show up in sysfs") (Mar 2014) refactored device_nodes to be kobjects such that
    the device tree could by more simply exposed to userspace using sysfs.
    
    Commit 0829f6d1f69e ("of: device_node kobject lifecycle fixes") (Mar 2014)
    followed up these changes to better control the kobject lifecycle and in
    particular the referecne counting via of_node_get(), of_node_put(), and
    of_node_init().
    
    A result of this second commit was that it introduced an of_node_put() call when
    a dynamic node is detached, in of_node_remove(), that removes the initial kobj
    reference created by of_node_init().
    
    Traditionally as the original dynamic device node user the pseries code had
    assumed responsibilty for releasing this final reference in its platform
    specific DLPAR detach code.
    
    This patch fixes a refcount underflow introduced by commit 0829f6d1f6, and
    recently exposed by the upstreaming of the recount API.
    
    Messages like the following are no longer seen in the kernel log with this
    patch following DLPAR remove operations of cpus and pci devices.

    powerpc/book3s/mce: Move add_taint() later in virtual mode
    
    commit d93b0ac01a9ce276ec39644be47001873d3d183c upstream.
    
    machine_check_early() gets called in real mode. The very first time when
    add_taint() is called, it prints a warning which ends up calling opal
    call (that uses OPAL_CALL wrapper) for writing it to console. If we get a
    very first machine check while we are in opal we are doomed. OPAL_CALL
    overwrites the PACASAVEDMSR in r13 and in this case when we are done with
    MCE handling the original opal call will use this new MSR on it's way
    back to opal_return. This usually leads to unexpected behaviour or the
    kernel to panic. Instead move the add_taint() call later in the virtual
    mode where it is safe to call.
    
    This is broken with current FW level. We got lucky so far for not getting
    very first MCE hit while in OPAL. But easily reproducible on Mambo.

    ceph: fix recursion between ceph_set_acl() and __ceph_setattr()
    
    commit 8179a101eb5f4ef0ac9a915fcea9a9d3109efa90 upstream.
    
    ceph_set_acl() calls __ceph_setattr() if the setacl operation needs
    to modify inode's i_mode. __ceph_setattr() updates inode's i_mode,
    then calls posix_acl_chmod().
    
    The problem is that __ceph_setattr() calls posix_acl_chmod() before
    sending the setattr request. The get_acl() call in posix_acl_chmod()
    can trigger a getxattr request. The reply of the getxattr request
    can restore inode's i_mode to its old value. The set_acl() call in
    posix_acl_chmod() sees old value of inode's i_mode, so it calls
    __ceph_setattr() again.

    USB: hub: fix non-SS hub-descriptor handling

    Add missing sanity check on the non-SuperSpeed hub-descriptor length in
    order to avoid parsing and leaking two bytes of uninitialised slab data
    through sysfs removable-attributes (or a compound-device debug
    statement).
    
    Note that we only make sure that the DeviceRemovable field is always
    present (and specifically ignore the unused PortPwrCtrlMask field) in
    order to continue support any hubs with non-compliant descriptors. As a
    further safeguard, the descriptor buffer is also cleared.

    Make sure to check the number of endpoints to avoid dereferencing a
    NULL-pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array should a
    malicious device lack the expected endpoints.

    sched/fair: Initialize throttle_count for new task-groups lazily
    
    commit 094f469172e00d6ab0a3130b0e01c83b3cf3a98d upstream.
    
    Cgroup created inside throttled group must inherit current throttle_count.
    Broken throttle_count allows to nominate throttled entries as a next buddy,
    later this leads to null pointer dereference in pick_next_task_fair().
    
    This patch initialize cfs_rq->throttle_count at first enqueue: laziness
    allows to skip locking all rq at group creation. Lazy approach also allows
    to skip full sub-tree scan at throttling hierarchy (not in this patch).

    fscrypt: avoid collisions when presenting long encrypted filenames
    
    commit 6b06cdee81d68a8a829ad8e8d0f31d6836744af9 upstream.
    
    When accessing an encrypted directory without the key, userspace must
    operate on filenames derived from the ciphertext names, which contain
    arbitrary bytes.  Since we must support filenames as long as NAME_MAX,
    we can't always just base64-encode the ciphertext, since that may make
    it too long.  Currently, this is solved by presenting long names in an
    abbreviated form containing any needed filesystem-specific hashes (e.g.
    to identify a directory block), then the last 16 bytes of ciphertext.
    This needs to be sufficient to identify the actual name on lookup.
    
    However, there is a bug.  It seems to have been assumed that due to the
    use of a CBC (ciphertext block chaining)-based encryption mode, the last
    16 bytes (i.e. the AES block size) of ciphertext would depend on the
    full plaintext, preventing collisions.  However, we actually use CBC
    with ciphertext stealing (CTS), which handles the last two blocks
    specially, causing them to appear "flipped".  Thus, it's actually the
    second-to-last block which depends on the full plaintext.
    
    This caused long filenames that differ only near the end of their
    plaintexts to, when observed without the key, point to the wrong inode
    and be undeletable.  For example, with ext4:
    
        # echo pass | e4crypt add_key -p 16 edir/
        # seq -f "edir/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345%.0f" 100000 | xargs touch
        # find edir/ -type f | xargs stat -c %i | sort | uniq | wc -l
        100000
        # sync
        # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
        # keyctl new_session
        # find edir/ -type f | xargs stat -c %i | sort | uniq | wc -l
        2004
        # rm -rf edir/
        rm: cannot remove 'edir/_A7nNFi3rhkEQlJ6P,hdzluhODKOeWx5V': Structure needs cleaning
        ...
    
    To fix this, when presenting long encrypted filenames, encode the
    second-to-last block of ciphertext rather than the last 16 bytes.
    
    Although it would be nice to solve this without depending on a specific
    encryption mode, that would mean doing a cryptographic hash like SHA-256
    which would be much less efficient.  This way is sufficient for now, and
    it's still compatible with encryption modes like HEH which are strong
    pseudorandom permutations.  Also, changing the presented names is still
    allowed at any time because they are only provided to allow applications
    to do things like delete encrypted directories.  They're not designed to
    be used to persistently identify files --- which would be hard to do
    anyway, given that they're encrypted after all.
    
    For ease of backports, this patch only makes the minimal fix to both
    ext4 and f2fs.  It leaves ubifs as-is, since ubifs doesn't compare the
    ciphertext block yet.  Follow-on patches will clean things up properly
    and make the filesystems use a shared helper function.

    f2fs: check entire encrypted bigname when finding a dentry
    
    commit 6332cd32c8290a80e929fc044dc5bdba77396e33 upstream.
    
    If user has no key under an encrypted dir, fscrypt gives digested dentries.
    Previously, when looking up a dentry, f2fs only checks its hash value with
    first 4 bytes of the digested dentry, which didn't handle hash collisions fully.
    This patch enhances to check entire dentry bytes likewise ext4.

     # seq -f "edir/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345%.0f" 100000 | xargs touch

    fscrypt: fix context consistency check when key(s) unavailable
    
    commit 272f98f6846277378e1758a49a49d7bf39343c02 upstream.
    
    To mitigate some types of offline attacks, filesystem encryption is
    designed to enforce that all files in an encrypted directory tree use
    the same encryption policy (i.e. the same encryption context excluding
    the nonce).  However, the fscrypt_has_permitted_context() function which
    enforces this relies on comparing struct fscrypt_info's, which are only
    available when we have the encryption keys.  This can cause two
    incorrect behaviors:
    
    1. If we have the parent directory's key but not the child's key, or
       vice versa, then fscrypt_has_permitted_context() returned false,
       causing applications to see EPERM or ENOKEY.  This is incorrect if
       the encryption contexts are in fact consistent.  Although we'd
       normally have either both keys or neither key in that case since the
       master_key_descriptors would be the same, this is not guaranteed
       because keys can be added or removed from keyrings at any time.
    
    2. If we have neither the parent's key nor the child's key, then
       fscrypt_has_permitted_context() returned true, causing applications
       to see no error (or else an error for some other reason).  This is
       incorrect if the encryption contexts are in fact inconsistent, since
       in that case we should deny access.
    
    To fix this, retrieve and compare the fscrypt_contexts if we are unable
    to set up both fscrypt_infos.
    
    While this slightly hurts performance when accessing an encrypted
    directory tree without the key, this isn't a case we really need to be
    optimizing for; access *with* the key is much more important.
    Furthermore, the performance hit is barely noticeable given that we are
    already retrieving the fscrypt_context and doing two keyring searches in
    fscrypt_get_encryption_info().  If we ever actually wanted to optimize
    this case we might start by caching the fscrypt_contexts.

    ext4 crypto: don't let data integrity writebacks fail with ENOMEM
    
    commit c9af28fdd44922a6c10c9f8315718408af98e315 upstream.
    
    We don't want the writeback triggered from the journal commit (in
    data=writeback mode) to cause the journal to abort due to
    generic_writepages() returning an ENOMEM error.  In addition, if
    fsync() fails with ENOMEM, most applications will probably not do the
    right thing.
    
    So if we are doing a data integrity sync, and ext4_encrypt() returns
    ENOMEM, we will submit any queued I/O to date, and then retry the
    allocation using GFP_NOFAIL.

    By suggestion from Johan Hovold it is possible to replace

    Olimex-ARM debuggers has exactly two ports, we could safely always use
    only second port within the debugger family.

    commit bb246681b3ed0967489a7401ad528c1aaa1a4c2e upstream.
    
    Commit 557aaa7ffab6 ("ft232: support the ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY

    but there was a logic flaw that skipped sending the corresponding

    open, something which was later also inadvertently broken by commit
    c19db4c9e49a ("USB: ftdi_sio: set device latency timeout at port
    probe").
    
    A recent commit c6dce2626606 ("USB: serial: ftdi_sio: fix extreme

    pid_ns: Fix race between setns'ed fork() and zap_pid_ns_processes()
    
    commit 3fd37226216620c1a468afa999739d5016fbc349 upstream.
    
    Imagine we have a pid namespace and a task from its parent's pid_ns,
    which made setns() to the pid namespace. The task is doing fork(),
    while the pid namespace's child reaper is dying. We have the race
    between them:
    
    Task from parent pid_ns             Child reaper
    copy_process()                      ..
      alloc_pid()                       ..
      ..                                zap_pid_ns_processes()
      ..                                  disable_pid_allocation()
      ..                                  read_lock(&tasklist_lock)
      ..                                  iterate over pids in pid_ns
      ..                                    kill tasks linked to pids
      ..                                  read_unlock(&tasklist_lock)
      write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);   ..
      attach_pid(p, PIDTYPE_PID);       ..
      ..                                ..
    
    So, just created task p won't receive SIGKILL signal,
    and the pid namespace will be in contradictory state.
    Only manual kill will help there, but does the userspace
    care about this? I suppose, the most users just inject
    a task into a pid namespace and wait a SIGCHLD from it.
    
    The patch fixes the problem. It simply checks for
    (pid_ns->nr_hashed & PIDNS_HASH_ADDING) in copy_process().
    We do it under the tasklist_lock, and can't skip
    PIDNS_HASH_ADDING as noted by Oleg:
    
    "zap_pid_ns_processes() does disable_pid_allocation()
    and then takes tasklist_lock to kill the whole namespace.
    Given that copy_process() checks PIDNS_HASH_ADDING
    under write_lock(tasklist) they can't race;
    if copy_process() takes this lock first, the new child will
    be killed, otherwise copy_process() can't miss
    the change in ->nr_hashed."
    
    If allocation is disabled, we just return -ENOMEM
    like it's made for such cases in alloc_pid().
    
    v2: Do not move disable_pid_allocation(), do not
    introduce a new variable in copy_process() and simplify
    the patch as suggested by Oleg Nesterov.
    Account the problem with double irq enabling
    found by Eric W. Biederman.

    pid_ns: Sleep in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE in zap_pid_ns_processes
    
    commit b9a985db98961ae1ba0be169f19df1c567e4ffe0 upstream.
    
    The code can potentially sleep for an indefinite amount of time in
    zap_pid_ns_processes triggering the hung task timeout, and increasing
    the system average.  This is undesirable.  Sleep with a task state of
    TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE instead of TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to remove these
    undesirable side effects.
    
    Apparently under heavy load this has been allowing Chrome to trigger
    the hung time task timeout error and cause ChromeOS to reboot.

    commit 330bdf62fe6a6c5b99a647f7bf7157107c9348b3 upstream.
    
    The idea here was to avoid having to "manually" program the HW if there's
    a new earliest alarm.  This was lazy and bad, as it leads to loads of fun
    races between inter-related callers (ie. therm).
    
    Turns out, it's not so difficult after all.  Go figure ;)

    drm/amdgpu: Avoid overflows/divide-by-zero in latency_watermark calculations.
    
    commit e190ed1ea7458e446230de4113cc5d53b8dc4ec8 upstream.
    
    At dot clocks > approx. 250 Mhz, some of these calcs will overflow and
    cause miscalculation of latency watermarks, and for some overflows also
    divide-by-zero driver crash ("divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP" in
    "dce_v10_0_latency_watermark+0x12d/0x190").
    
    This zero-divide happened, e.g., on AMD Tonga Pro under DCE-10,
    on a Displayport panel when trying to set a video mode of 2560x1440
    at 165 Hz vrefresh with a dot clock of 635.540 Mhz.
    
    Refine calculations to avoid the overflows.
    
    Tested for DCE-10 with R9 380 Tonga + ASUS ROG PG279 panel.

    git commit c5328901aa1db134 "[S390] entry[64].S improvements" removed
    the update of the exit_timer lowcore field from the critical section
    cleanup of the .Lsysc_restore/.Lsysc_done and .Lio_restore/.Lio_done
    blocks. If the PSW is updated by the critical section cleanup to point to
    user space again, the interrupt entry code will do a vtime calculation
    after the cleanup completed with an exit_timer value which has *not* been
    updated. Due to this incorrect system time deltas are calculated.
    
    If an interrupt occured with an old PSW between .Lsysc_restore/.Lsysc_done
    or .Lio_restore/.Lio_done update __LC_EXIT_TIMER with the system entry
    time of the interrupt.

    s390/kdump: Add final note
    
    commit dcc00b79fc3d076832f7240de8870f492629b171 upstream.
    
    Since linux v3.14 with commit 38dfac843cb6d7be1 ("vmcore: prevent PT_NOTE
    p_memsz overflow during header update") on s390 we get the following
    message in the kdump kernel:
    
      Warning: Exceeded p_memsz, dropping PT_NOTE entry n_namesz=0x6b6b6b6b,
      n_descsz=0x6b6b6b6b
    
    The reason for this is that we don't create a final zero note in
    the ELF header which the proc/vmcore code uses to find out the end
    of the notes section (see also kernel/kexec_core.c:final_note()).
    
    It still worked on s390 by chance because we (most of the time?) have the
    byte pattern 0x6b6b6b6b after the notes section which also makes the notes
    parsing code stop in update_note_header_size_elf64() because 0x6b6b6b6b is
    interpreded as note size:
    
      if ((real_sz + sz) > max_sz) {
              pr_warn("Warning: Exceeded p_memsz, dropping P ...);
              break;
      }
    
    So fix this and add the missing final note to the ELF header.
    We don't have to adjust the memory size for ELF header ("alloc_size")
    because the new ELF note still fits into the 0x1000 base memory.

    Allowed" bit.  That patch was clearly never tested, since without that
    bit cleared, the core VDCDC1 voltage output does not react to I2C
    configuration changes.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by clearing the bit as in the original,
    correct implementation.  Note for stable back porting that, due to
    subsequent driver churn, this patch will not apply on every kernel
    version.

    KVM: X86: Fix read out-of-bounds vulnerability in kvm pio emulation
    
    commit cbfc6c9184ce71b52df4b1d82af5afc81a709178 upstream.
    
    Huawei folks reported a read out-of-bounds vulnerability in kvm pio emulation.
    
    - "inb" instruction to access PIT Mod/Command register (ioport 0x43, write only,
      a read should be ignored) in guest can get a random number.
    - "rep insb" instruction to access PIT register port 0x43 can control memcpy()
      in emulator_pio_in_emulated() to copy max 0x400 bytes but only read 1 bytes,
      which will disclose the unimportant kernel memory in host but no crash.
    
    The similar test program below can reproduce the read out-of-bounds vulnerability:
    
    void hexdump(void *mem, unsigned int len)
    {
            unsigned int i, j;
    
            for(i = 0; i < len + ((len % HEXDUMP_COLS) ? (HEXDUMP_COLS - len % HEXDUMP_COLS) : 0); i++)
            {
                    /* print offset */
                    if(i % HEXDUMP_COLS == 0)
                    {
                            printf("0x%06x: ", i);
                    }
    
                    /* print hex data */
                    if(i < len)
                    {
                            printf("%02x ", 0xFF & ((char*)mem)[i]);
                    }
                    else /* end of block, just aligning for ASCII dump */
                    {
                            printf("   ");
                    }
    
                    /* print ASCII dump */
                    if(i % HEXDUMP_COLS == (HEXDUMP_COLS - 1))
                    {
                            for(j = i - (HEXDUMP_COLS - 1); j <= i; j++)
                            {

    The vcpu->arch.pio_data buffer is used by both in/out instrutions emulation
    w/o clear after using which results in some random datas are left over in
    the buffer. Guest reads port 0x43 will be ignored since it is write only,
    however, the function kernel_pio() can't distigush this ignore from successfully
    reads data from device's ioport. There is no new data fill the buffer from
    port 0x43, however, emulator_pio_in_emulated() will copy the stale data in
    the buffer to the guest unconditionally. This patch fixes it by clearing the
    buffer before in instruction emulation to avoid to grant guest the stale data
    in the buffer.
    
    In addition, string I/O is not supported for in kernel device. So there is no
    iteration to read ioport %RCX times for string I/O. The function kernel_pio()
    just reads one round, and then copy the io size * %RCX to the guest unconditionally,
    actually it copies the one round ioport data w/ other random datas which are left
    over in the vcpu->arch.pio_data buffer to the guest. This patch fixes it by
    introducing the string I/O support for in kernel device in order to grant the right
    ioport datas to the guest.

    SDM mentioned that "The MXCSR has several reserved bits, and attempting to write
    a 1 to any of these bits will cause a general-protection exception(#GP) to be
    generated". The syzkaller forks' testcase overrides xsave area w/ random values
    and steps on the reserved bits of MXCSR register. The damaged MXCSR register
    values of guest will be restored to SSEx MXCSR register before vmentry. This
    patch fixes it by catching userspace override MXCSR register reserved bits w/
    random values and bails out immediately.

    ima: accept previously set IMA_NEW_FILE
    
    commit 1ac202e978e18f045006d75bd549612620c6ec3a upstream.
    
    Modifying the attributes of a file makes ima_inode_post_setattr reset
    the IMA cache flags. So if the file, which has just been created,
    is opened a second time before the first file descriptor is closed,
    verification fails since the security.ima xattr has not been written
    yet. We therefore have to look at the IMA_NEW_FILE even if the file
    already existed.
    
    With this patch there should no longer be an error when cat tries to
    open testfile:
    
    $ rm -f testfile
    $ ( echo test >&3 ; touch testfile ; cat testfile ) 3>testfile
    
    A file being new is no reason to accept that it is missing a digital
    signature demanded by the policy.

    mwifiex: pcie: fix cmd_buf use-after-free in remove/reset
    
    commit 3c8cb9ad032d737b874e402c59eb51e3c991a144 upstream.
    
    Command buffers (skb's) are allocated by the main driver, and freed upon
    the last use. That last use is often in mwifiex_free_cmd_buffer(). In
    the meantime, if the command buffer gets used by the PCI driver, we map
    it as DMA-able, and store the mapping information in the 'cb' memory.
    
    However, if a command was in-flight when resetting the device (and
    therefore was still mapped), we don't get a chance to unmap this memory
    until after the core has cleaned up its command handling.
    
    Let's keep a refcount within the PCI driver, so we ensure the memory
    only gets freed after we've finished unmapping it.
    
    Noticed by KASAN when forcing a reset via:
    
      echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/.../reset
    
    The same code path can presumably be exercised in remove() and
    shutdown().

    md: update slab_cache before releasing new stripes when stripes resizing
    
    commit 583da48e388f472e8818d9bb60ef6a1d40ee9f9d upstream.
    
    When growing raid5 device on machine with small memory, there is chance that
    mdadm will be killed and the following bug report can be observed. The same
    bug could also be reproduced in linux-4.10.6.

    The problem is that resize_stripes() releases new stripe_heads before assigning new
    slab cache to conf->slab_cache. If the shrinker function raid5_cache_scan() gets called
    after resize_stripes() starting releasing new stripes but right before new slab cache
    being assigned, it is possible that these new stripe_heads will be freed with the old
    slab_cache which was already been destoryed and that triggers this bug.

    dm bufio: make the parameter "retain_bytes" unsigned long
    
    commit 13840d38016203f0095cd547b90352812d24b787 upstream.
    
    Change the type of the parameter "retain_bytes" from unsigned to
    unsigned long, so that on 64-bit machines the user can set more than
    4GiB of data to be retained.
    
    Also, change the type of the variable "count" in the function
    "__evict_old_buffers" to unsigned long.  The assignment
    "count = c->n_buffers[LIST_CLEAN] + c->n_buffers[LIST_DIRTY];"
    could result in unsigned long to unsigned overflow and that could result
    in buffers not being freed when they should.
    
    While at it, avoid division in get_retain_buffers().  Division is slow,
    we can change it to shift because we have precalculated the log2 of
    block size.

    dm bufio: check new buffer allocation watermark every 30 seconds
    
    commit 390020ad2af9ca04844c4f3b1f299ad8746d84c8 upstream.
    
    dm-bufio checks a watermark when it allocates a new buffer in
    __bufio_new().  However, it doesn't check the watermark when the user
    changes /sys/module/dm_bufio/parameters/max_cache_size_bytes.
    
    This may result in a problem - if the watermark is high enough so that
    all possible buffers are allocated and if the user lowers the value of
    "max_cache_size_bytes", the watermark will never be checked against the
    new value because no new buffer would be allocated.
    
    To fix this, change __evict_old_buffers() so that it checks the
    watermark.  __evict_old_buffers() is called every 30 seconds, so if the
    user reduces "max_cache_size_bytes", dm-bufio will react to this change
    within 30 seconds and decrease memory consumption.

    dm bufio: avoid a possible ABBA deadlock
    
    commit 1b0fb5a5b2dc0dddcfa575060441a7176ba7ac37 upstream.
    
    __get_memory_limit() tests if dm_bufio_cache_size changed and calls
    __cache_size_refresh() if it did.  It takes dm_bufio_clients_lock while
    it already holds the client lock.  However, lock ordering is violated
    because in cleanup_old_buffers() dm_bufio_clients_lock is taken before
    the client lock.
    
    This results in a possible deadlock and lockdep engine warning.
    
    Fix this deadlock by changing mutex_lock() to mutex_trylock().  If the
    lock can't be taken, it will be re-checked next time when a new buffer
    is allocated.
    
    Also add "unlikely" to the if condition, so that the optimizer assumes
    that the condition is false.

    commit 7d1fedb6e96a960aa91e4ff70714c3fb09195a5a upstream.
    
    dm_btree_find_lowest_key() is giving incorrect results.  find_key()
    traverses the btree correctly for finding the highest key, but there is
    an error in the way it traverses the btree for retrieving the lowest
    key.  dm_btree_find_lowest_key() fetches the first key of the rightmost
    block of the btree instead of fetching the first key from the leftmost
    block.
    
    Fix this by conditionally passing the correct parameter to value64()
    based on the @find_highest flag.

    The infiniband address handle can be triggered to resolve an ipv6
    address in response to MAD packets, regardless of the ipv6
    module being disabled via the kernel command line argument.
    
    That will cause a call into the ipv6 routing code, which is not
    initialized, and a conseguent oops.
    
    This commit addresses the above issue replacing the direct lookup
    call with an indirect one via the ipv6 stub, which is properly
    initialized according to the ipv6 status (e.g. if ipv6 is
    disabled, the routing lookup fails gracefully)

    tpm_crb: check for bad response size
    
    commit 8569defde8057258835c51ce01a33de82e14b148 upstream.
    
    Make sure size of response buffer is at least 6 bytes, or
    we will underflow and pass large size_t to memcpy_fromio().
    This was encountered while testing earlier version of
    locality patchset.

    ARM: tegra: paz00: Mark panel regulator as enabled on boot
    
    commit 0c18927f51f4d390abdcf385bff5f995407ee732 upstream.
    
    Current U-Boot enables the display already. Marking the regulator as
    enabled on boot fixes sporadic panel initialization failures.

    USB: core: replace %p with %pK
    
    commit 2f964780c03b73de269b08d12aff96a9618d13f3 upstream.
    
    Format specifier %p can leak kernel addresses while not valuing the
    kptr_restrict system settings. When kptr_restrict is set to (1), kernel
    pointers printed using the %pK format specifier will be replaced with
    Zeros. Debugging Note : &pK prints only Zeros as address. If you need
    actual address information, write 0 to kptr_restrict.
    
    echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
    
    [Found by poking around in a random vendor kernel tree, it would be nice
    if someone would actually send these types of patches upstream - gkh]

    char: lp: fix possible integer overflow in lp_setup()
    
    commit 3e21f4af170bebf47c187c1ff8bf155583c9f3b1 upstream.
    
    The lp_setup() code doesn't apply any bounds checking when passing
    "lp=none", and only in this case, resulting in an overflow of the
    parport_nr[] array. All versions in Git history are affected.

    USB: ene_usb6250: fix DMA to the stack
    
    commit 628c2893d44876ddd11602400c70606ade62e129 upstream.
    
    The ene_usb6250 sub-driver in usb-storage does USB I/O to buffers on
    the stack, which doesn't work with vmapped stacks.  This patch fixes
    the problem by allocating a separate 512-byte buffer at probe time and
    using it for all of the offending I/O operations.
