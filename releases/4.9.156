    perf/x86/intel: Delay memory deallocation until x86_pmu_dead_cpu()
    
    commit 602cae04c4864bb3487dfe4c2126c8d9e7e1614a upstream.
    
    intel_pmu_cpu_prepare() allocated memory for ->shared_regs among other
    members of struct cpu_hw_events. This memory is released in
    intel_pmu_cpu_dying() which is wrong. The counterpart of the
    intel_pmu_cpu_prepare() callback is x86_pmu_dead_cpu().
    
    Otherwise if the CPU fails on the UP path between CPUHP_PERF_X86_PREPARE
    and CPUHP_AP_PERF_X86_STARTING then it won't release the memory but
    allocate new memory on the next attempt to online the CPU (leaking the
    old memory).
    Also, if the CPU down path fails between CPUHP_AP_PERF_X86_STARTING and
    CPUHP_PERF_X86_PREPARE then the CPU will go back online but never
    allocate the memory that was released in x86_pmu_dying_cpu().
    
    Make the memory allocation/free symmetrical in regard to the CPU hotplug
    notifier by moving the deallocation to intel_pmu_cpu_dead().
    
    This started in commit:
    
       a7e3ed1e47011 ("perf: Add support for supplementary event registers").
    
    In principle the bug was introduced in v2.6.39 (!), but it will almost
    certainly not backport cleanly across the big CPU hotplug rewrite between v4.7-v4.15...

    IB/hfi1: Add limit test for RC/UC send via loopback
    
    commit 09ce351dff8e7636af0beb72cd4a86c3904a0500 upstream.
    
    Fix potential memory corruption and panic in loopback for IB_WR_SEND
    variants.
    
    The code blindly assumes the posted length will fit in the fetched rwqe,
    which is not a valid assumption.
    
    Fix by adding a limit test, and triggering the appropriate send completion
    and putting the QP in an error state.  This mimics the handling for
    non-loopback QPs.

    oom, oom_reaper: do not enqueue same task twice
    
    commit 9bcdeb51bd7d2ae9fe65ea4d60643d2aeef5bfe3 upstream.
    
    Arkadiusz reported that enabling memcg's group oom killing causes
    strange memcg statistics where there is no task in a memcg despite the
    number of tasks in that memcg is not 0.  It turned out that there is a
    bug in wake_oom_reaper() which allows enqueuing same task twice which
    makes impossible to decrease the number of tasks in that memcg due to a
    refcount leak.
    
    This bug existed since the OOM reaper became invokable from
    task_will_free_mem(current) path in out_of_memory() in Linux 4.7,

                                       spin_unlock(&oom_reaper_lock)
    
    but memcg's group oom killing made it easier to trigger this bug by
    calling wake_oom_reaper() on the same task from one out_of_memory()
    request.
    
    Fix this bug using an approach used by commit 855b018325737f76 ("oom,
    oom_reaper: disable oom_reaper for oom_kill_allocating_task").  As a
    side effect of this patch, this patch also avoids enqueuing multiple
    threads sharing memory via task_will_free_mem(current) path.

    serial: fix race between flush_to_ldisc and tty_open
    
    commit fedb5760648a291e949f2380d383b5b2d2749b5e upstream.
    
    There still is a race window after the commit b027e2298bd588
    ("tty: fix data race between tty_init_dev and flush of buf"),
    and we encountered this crash issue if receive_buf call comes
    before tty initialization completes in tty_open and
    tty->driver_data may be NULL.

                                         tty_ldisc_unlock
                                           schedule
    flush_to_ldisc
     receive_buf
      tty_port_default_receive_buf
       tty_ldisc_receive_buf
        n_tty_receive_buf_common
          __receive_buf
           uart_flush_chars
            uart_start
            /*tty->driver_data is NULL*/
                                       tty->ops->open
                                       /*init tty->driver_data*/
    
    it can be fixed by extending ldisc semaphore lock in tty_init_dev
    to driver_data initialized completely after tty->ops->open(), but
    this will lead to get lock on one function and unlock in some other
    function, and hard to maintain, so fix this race only by checking
    tty->driver_data when receiving, and return if tty->driver_data
    is NULL, and n_tty_receive_buf_common maybe calls uart_unthrottle,
    so add the same check.
    
    Because the tty layer knows nothing about the driver associated with the
    device, the tty layer can not do anything here, it is up to the tty
    driver itself to check for this type of race.  Fix up the serial driver
    to correctly check to see if it is finished binding with the device when
    being called, and if not, abort the tty calls.

    the patch to be in the serial layer, not in the tty core - gregkh]

    commit 489338a717a0dfbbd5a3fabccf172b78f0ac9015 upstream.
    
    Notice that the use of the bitwise OR operator '|' always leads to true
    in this particular case, which seems a bit suspicious due to the context
    in which this expression is being used.

    perf/core: Don't WARN() for impossible ring-buffer sizes
    
    commit 9dff0aa95a324e262ffb03f425d00e4751f3294e upstream.
    
    The perf tool uses /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb to determine how
    large its ringbuffer mmap should be. This can be configured to arbitrary
    values, which can be larger than the maximum possible allocation from
    kmalloc.
    
    When this is configured to a suitably large value (e.g. thanks to the
    perf fuzzer), attempting to use perf record triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE() in
    __alloc_pages_nodemask():
    
       WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 5666 at mm/page_alloc.c:4511 __alloc_pages_nodemask+0x3f8/0xbc8
    
    Let's avoid this by checking that the requested allocation is possible
    before calling kzalloc.

    x86/MCE: Initialize mce.bank in the case of a fatal error in mce_no_way_out()
    
    commit d28af26faa0b1daf3c692603d46bc4687c16f19e upstream.
    
    Internal injection testing crashed with a console log that said:
    
      mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 7: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 0: bd80000000100134
    
    This caused a lot of head scratching because the MCACOD (bits 15:0) of
    that status is a signature from an L1 data cache error. But Linux says
    that it found it in "Bank 0", which on this model CPU only reports L1
    instruction cache errors.
    
    The answer was that Linux doesn't initialize "m->bank" in the case that
    it finds a fatal error in the mce_no_way_out() pre-scan of banks. If
    this was a local machine check, then this partially initialized struct
    mce is being passed to mce_panic().
    
    Fix is simple: just initialize m->bank in the case of a fatal error.

    perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Node ID mask
    
    commit 9e63a7894fd302082cf3627fe90844421a6cbe7f upstream.
    
    Some PCI uncore PMUs cannot be registered on an 8-socket system (HPE
    Superdome Flex).
    
    To understand which Socket the PCI uncore PMUs belongs to, perf retrieves
    the local Node ID of the uncore device from CPUNODEID(0xC0) of the PCI
    configuration space, and the mapping between Socket ID and Node ID from
    GIDNIDMAP(0xD4). The Socket ID can be calculated accordingly.
    
    The local Node ID is only available at bit 2:0, but current code doesn't
    mask it. If a BIOS doesn't clear the rest of the bits, an incorrect Node ID
    will be fetched.
    
    Filter the Node ID by adding a mask.

    kvm: fix kvm_ioctl_create_device() reference counting (CVE-2019-6974)
    
    commit cfa39381173d5f969daf43582c95ad679189cbc9 upstream.
    
    kvm_ioctl_create_device() does the following:
    
    1. creates a device that holds a reference to the VM object (with a borrowed
       reference, the VM's refcount has not been bumped yet)
    2. initializes the device
    3. transfers the reference to the device to the caller's file descriptor table
    4. calls kvm_get_kvm() to turn the borrowed reference to the VM into a real
       reference
    
    The ownership transfer in step 3 must not happen before the reference to the VM
    becomes a proper, non-borrowed reference, which only happens in step 4.
    After step 3, an attacker can close the file descriptor and drop the borrowed
    reference, which can cause the refcount of the kvm object to drop to zero.
    
    This means that we need to grab a reference for the device before
    anon_inode_getfd(), otherwise the VM can disappear from under us.

    KVM: x86: work around leak of uninitialized stack contents (CVE-2019-7222)
    
    commit 353c0956a618a07ba4bbe7ad00ff29fe70e8412a upstream.
    
    Bugzilla: 1671930
    
    Emulation of certain instructions (VMXON, VMCLEAR, VMPTRLD, VMWRITE with
    memory operand, INVEPT, INVVPID) can incorrectly inject a page fault
    when passed an operand that points to an MMIO address.  The page fault
    will use uninitialized kernel stack memory as the CR2 and error code.
    
    The right behavior would be to abort the VM with a KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR
    exit to userspace; however, it is not an easy fix, so for now just
    ensure that the error code and CR2 are zero.

    scsi: aic94xx: fix module loading
    
    commit 42caa0edabd6a0a392ec36a5f0943924e4954311 upstream.
    
    The aic94xx driver is currently failing to load with errors like

    Because the PCI code had recently added a file named 'revision' to every
    PCI device.  Fix this by renaming the aic94xx revision file to
    aic_revision.  This is safe to do for us because as far as I can tell,
    there's nothing in userspace relying on the current aic94xx revision file
    so it can be renamed without breaking anything.

    usb: gadget: musb: fix short isoc packets with inventra dma
    
    commit c418fd6c01fbc5516a2cd1eaf1df1ec86869028a upstream.
    
    Handling short packets (length < max packet size) in the Inventra DMA
    engine in the MUSB driver causes the MUSB DMA controller to hang. An
    example of a problem that is caused by this problem is when streaming
    video out of a UVC gadget, only the first video frame is transferred.
    
    For short packets (mode-0 or mode-1 DMA), MUSB_TXCSR_TXPKTRDY must be
    set manually by the driver. This was previously done in musb_g_tx
    (musb_gadget.c), but incorrectly (all csr flags were cleared, and only
    MUSB_TXCSR_MODE and MUSB_TXCSR_TXPKTRDY were set). Fixing that problem
    allows some requests to be transferred correctly, but multiple requests
    were often put together in one USB packet, and caused problems if the
    packet size was not a multiple of 4. Instead, set MUSB_TXCSR_TXPKTRDY
    in dma_controller_irq (musbhsdma.c), just like host mode transfers.
    
    This topic was originally tackled by Nicolas Boichat [0] [1] and is
    discussed further at [2] as part of his GSoC project [3].

    dmaengine: imx-dma: fix wrong callback invoke
    
    commit 341198eda723c8c1cddbb006a89ad9e362502ea2 upstream.
    
    Once the "ld_queue" list is not empty, next descriptor will migrate
    into "ld_active" list. The "desc" variable will be overwritten
    during that transition. And later the dmaengine_desc_get_callback_invoke()
    will use it as an argument. As result we invoke wrong callback.
    
    That behaviour was in place since:
    commit fcaaba6c7136 ("dmaengine: imx-dma: fix callback path in tasklet").
    But after commit 4cd13c21b207 ("softirq: Let ksoftirqd do its job")
    things got worse, since possible delay between tasklet_schedule()
    from DMA irq handler and actual tasklet function execution got bigger.
    And that gave more time for new DMA request to be submitted and
    to be put into "ld_queue" list.
    
    It has been noticed that DMA issue is causing problems for "mxc-mmc"
    driver. While stressing the system with heavy network traffic and
    writing/reading to/from sd card simultaneously the timeout may happen:
    
    10013000.sdhci: mxcmci_watchdog: read time out (status = 0x30004900)
    
    That often lead to file system corruption.

    dmaengine: bcm2835: Fix abort of transactions
    
    commit 9e528c799d17a4ac37d788c81440b50377dd592d upstream.
    
    There are multiple issues with bcm2835_dma_abort() (which is called on
    termination of a transaction):
    
    * The algorithm to abort the transaction first pauses the channel by
      clearing the ACTIVE flag in the CS register, then waits for the PAUSED
      flag to clear.  Page 49 of the spec documents the latter as follows:
    
      "Indicates if the DMA is currently paused and not transferring data.
       This will occur if the active bit has been cleared [...]"
       https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf
    
      So the function is entering an infinite loop because it is waiting for
      PAUSED to clear which is always set due to the function having cleared
      the ACTIVE flag.  The only thing that's saving it from itself is the
      upper bound of 10000 loop iterations.
    
      The code comment says that the intention is to "wait for any current
      AXI transfer to complete", so the author probably wanted to check the
      WAITING_FOR_OUTSTANDING_WRITES flag instead.  Amend the function
      accordingly.
    
    * The CS register is only read at the beginning of the function.  It
      needs to be read again after pausing the channel and before checking
      for outstanding writes, otherwise writes which were issued between
      the register read at the beginning of the function and pausing the
      channel may not be waited for.
    
    * The function seeks to abort the transfer by writing 0 to the NEXTCONBK
      register and setting the ABORT and ACTIVE flags.  Thereby, the 0 in
      NEXTCONBK is sought to be loaded into the CONBLK_AD register.  However
      experimentation has shown this approach to not work:  The CONBLK_AD
      register remains the same as before and the CS register contains
      0x00000030 (PAUSED | DREQ_STOPS_DMA).  In other words, the control
      block is not aborted but merely paused and it will be resumed once the
      next DMA transaction is started.  That is absolutely not the desired
      behavior.
    
      A simpler approach is to set the channel's RESET flag instead.  This
      reliably zeroes the NEXTCONBK as well as the CS register.  It requires
      less code and only a single MMIO write.  This is also what popular
      user space DMA drivers do, e.g.:
      https://github.com/metachris/RPIO/blob/master/source/c_pwm/pwm.c
    
      Note that the spec is contradictory whether the NEXTCONBK register
      is writeable at all.  On the one hand, page 41 claims:
    
      "The value loaded into the NEXTCONBK register can be overwritten so
      that the linked list of Control Block data structures can be
      dynamically altered. However it is only safe to do this when the DMA
      is paused."
    
      On the other hand, page 40 specifies:
    
      "Only three registers in each channel's register set are directly
      writeable (CS, CONBLK_AD and DEBUG). The other registers (TI,
      SOURCE_AD, DEST_AD, TXFR_LEN, STRIDE & NEXTCONBK), are automatically
      loaded from a Control Block data structure held in external memory."

    dmaengine: bcm2835: Fix interrupt race on RT
    
    commit f7da7782aba92593f7b82f03d2409a1c5f4db91b upstream.
    
    If IRQ handlers are threaded (either because CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_BASE is
    enabled or "threadirqs" was passed on the command line) and if system
    load is sufficiently high that wakeup latency of IRQ threads degrades,
    SPI DMA transactions on the BCM2835 occasionally break like this:
    
    ks8851 spi0.0: SPI transfer timed out
    bcm2835-dma 3f007000.dma: DMA transfer could not be terminated
    ks8851 spi0.0 eth2: ks8851_rdfifo: spi_sync() failed
    
    The root cause is an assumption made by the DMA driver which is
    documented in a code comment in bcm2835_dma_terminate_all():
    
    /*
     * Stop DMA activity: we assume the callback will not be called
     * after bcm_dma_abort() returns (even if it does, it will see
     * c->desc is NULL and exit.)
     */
    
    That assumption falls apart if the IRQ handler bcm2835_dma_callback() is
    threaded: A client may terminate a descriptor and issue a new one
    before the IRQ handler had a chance to run. In fact the IRQ handler may
    miss an *arbitrary* number of descriptors. The result is the following
    race condition:
    
    1. A descriptor finishes, its interrupt is deferred to the IRQ thread.
    2. A client calls dma_terminate_async() which sets channel->desc = NULL.
    3. The client issues a new descriptor. Because channel->desc is NULL,
       bcm2835_dma_issue_pending() immediately starts the descriptor.
    4. Finally the IRQ thread runs and writes BCM2835_DMA_INT to the CS
       register to acknowledge the interrupt. This clears the ACTIVE flag,
       so the newly issued descriptor is paused in the middle of the
       transaction. Because channel->desc is not NULL, the IRQ thread
       finalizes the descriptor and tries to start the next one.
    
    I see two possible solutions: The first is to call synchronize_irq()
    in bcm2835_dma_issue_pending() to wait until the IRQ thread has
    finished before issuing a new descriptor. The downside of this approach
    is unnecessary latency if clients desire rapidly terminating and
    re-issuing descriptors and don't have any use for an IRQ callback.
    (The SPI TX DMA channel is a case in point.)
    
    A better alternative is to make the IRQ thread recognize that it has
    missed descriptors and avoid finalizing the newly issued descriptor.
    So first of all, set the ACTIVE flag when acknowledging the interrupt.
    This keeps a newly issued descriptor running.
    
    If the descriptor was finished, the channel remains idle despite the
    ACTIVE flag being set. However the ACTIVE flag can then no longer be
    used to check whether the channel is idle, so instead check whether
    the register containing the current control block address is zero
    and finalize the current descriptor only if so.
    
    That way, there is no impact on latency and throughput if the client
    doesn't care for the interrupt: Only minimal additional overhead is
    introduced for non-cyclic descriptors as one further MMIO read is
    necessary per interrupt to check for idleness of the channel. Cyclic
    descriptors are sped up slightly by removing one MMIO write per
    interrupt.

    fuse: call pipe_buf_release() under pipe lock
    
    commit 9509941e9c534920ccc4771ae70bd6cbbe79df1c upstream.
    
    Some of the pipe_buf_release() handlers seem to assume that the pipe is
    locked - in particular, anon_pipe_buf_release() accesses pipe->tmp_page
    without taking any extra locks. From a glance through the callers of
    pipe_buf_release(), it looks like FUSE is the only one that calls
    pipe_buf_release() without having the pipe locked.
    
    This bug should only lead to a memory leak, nothing terrible.

    ALSA: hda - Serialize codec registrations
    
    commit 305a0ade180981686eec1f92aa6252a7c6ebb1cf upstream.
    
    In the current code, the codec registration may happen both at the
    codec bind time and the end of the controller probe time.  In a rare
    occasion, they race with each other, leading to Oops due to the still
    uninitialized card device.
    
    This patch introduces a simple flag to prevent the codec registration
    at the codec bind time as long as the controller probe is going on.
    The controller probe invokes snd_card_register() that does the whole
    registration task, and we don't need to register each piece
    beforehand.

    ALSA: compress: Fix stop handling on compressed capture streams
    
    commit 4f2ab5e1d13d6aa77c55f4914659784efd776eb4 upstream.
    
    It is normal user behaviour to start, stop, then start a stream
    again without closing it. Currently this works for compressed
    playback streams but not capture ones.
    
    The states on a compressed capture stream go directly from OPEN to
    PREPARED, unlike a playback stream which moves to SETUP and waits
    for a write of data before moving to PREPARED. Currently however,
    when a stop is sent the state is set to SETUP for both types of
    streams. This leaves a capture stream in the situation where a new
    start can't be sent as that requires the state to be PREPARED and
    a new set_params can't be sent as that requires the state to be
    OPEN. The only option being to close the stream, and then reopen.
    
    Correct this issues by allowing snd_compr_drain_notify to set the
    state depending on the stream direction, as we already do in
    set_params.

    net: dsa: slave: Don't propagate flag changes on down slave interfaces
    
    [ Upstream commit 17ab4f61b8cd6f9c38e9d0b935d86d73b5d0d2b5 ]
    
    The unbalance of master's promiscuity or allmulti will happen after ifdown
    and ifup a slave interface which is in a bridge.
    
    When we ifdown a slave interface , both the 'dsa_slave_close' and
    'dsa_slave_change_rx_flags' will clear the master's flags. The flags
    of master will be decrease twice.
    In the other hand, if we ifup the slave interface again, since the
    slave's flags were cleared the 'dsa_slave_open' won't set the master's
    flag, only 'dsa_slave_change_rx_flags' that triggered by 'br_add_if'
    will set the master's flags. The flags of master is increase once.
    
    Only propagating flag changes when a slave interface is up makes
    sure this does not happen. The 'vlan_dev_change_rx_flags' had the
    same problem and was fixed, and changes here follows that fix.

    net/mlx5e: Force CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY for short ethernet frames
    
    [ Upstream commit e8c8b53ccaff568fef4c13a6ccaf08bf241aa01a ]
    
    When an ethernet frame is padded to meet the minimum ethernet frame
    size, the padding octets are not covered by the hardware checksum.
    Fortunately the padding octets are usually zero's, which don't affect
    checksum. However, we have a switch which pads non-zero octets, this
    causes kernel hardware checksum fault repeatedly.
    
    Prior to:
    commit '88078d98d1bb ("net: pskb_trim_rcsum() and CHECKSUM_COMPLETE ...")'
    skb checksum was forced to be CHECKSUM_NONE when padding is detected.
    After it, we need to keep skb->csum updated, like what we do for RXFCS.
    However, fixing up CHECKSUM_COMPLETE requires to verify and parse IP
    headers, it is not worthy the effort as the packets are so small that
    CHECKSUM_COMPLETE can't save anything.

    [ Upstream commit 8dfb8d2cceb76b74ad5b58cc65c75994329b4d5e ]
    
    Broadcom STB chips support a deep sleep mode where all register
    contents are lost. Because we were stashing the MagicPacket password
    into some of these registers a suspend into that deep sleep then a
    resumption would not lead to being able to wake-up from MagicPacket with
    password again.
    
    Fix this by keeping a software copy of the password and program it
    during suspend.

    net: dp83640: expire old TX-skb
    
    [ Upstream commit 53bc8d2af08654659abfadfd3e98eb9922ff787c ]
    
    During sendmsg() a cloned skb is saved via dp83640_txtstamp() in
    ->tx_queue. After the NIC sends this packet, the PHY will reply with a
    timestamp for that TX packet. If the cable is pulled at the right time I
    don't see that packet. It might gets flushed as part of queue shutdown
    on NIC's side.
    Once the link is up again then after the next sendmsg() we enqueue
    another skb in dp83640_txtstamp() and have two on the list. Then the PHY
    will send a reply and decode_txts() attaches it to the first skb on the
    list.
    No crash occurs since refcounting works but we are one packet behind.
    linuxptp/ptp4l usually closes the socket and opens a new one (in such a
    timeout case) so those "stale" replies never get there. However it does
    not resume normal operation anymore.
    
    Purge old skbs in decode_txts().

    exec: load_script: don't blindly truncate shebang string
    
    [ Upstream commit 8099b047ecc431518b9bb6bdbba3549bbecdc343 ]
    
    load_script() simply truncates bprm->buf and this is very wrong if the
    length of shebang string exceeds BINPRM_BUF_SIZE-2.  This can silently
    truncate i_arg or (worse) we can execute the wrong binary if buf[2:126]
    happens to be the valid executable path.
    
    Change load_script() to return ENOEXEC if it can't find '\n' or zero in
    bprm->buf.  Note that '\0' can come from either
    prepare_binprm()->memset() or from kernel_read(), we do not care.

    fs/epoll: drop ovflist branch prediction
    
    [ Upstream commit 76699a67f3041ff4c7af6d6ee9be2bfbf1ffb671 ]
    
    The ep->ovflist is a secondary ready-list to temporarily store events
    that might occur when doing sproc without holding the ep->wq.lock.  This
    accounts for every time we check for ready events and also send events
    back to userspace; both callbacks, particularly the latter because of
    copy_to_user, can account for a non-trivial time.
    
    As such, the unlikely() check to see if the pointer is being used, seems
    both misleading and sub-optimal.  In fact, we go to an awful lot of
    trouble to sync both lists, and populating the ovflist is far from an
    uncommon scenario.
    
    For example, profiling a concurrent epoll_wait(2) benchmark, with
    CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES shows that for a two threads a 33%
    incorrect rate was seen; and when incrementally increasing the number of
    epoll instances (which is used, for example for multiple queuing load
    balancing models), up to a 90% incorrect rate was seen.
    
    Similarly, by deleting the prediction, 3% throughput boost was seen
    across incremental threads.

    proc/sysctl: fix return error for proc_doulongvec_minmax()
    
    [ Upstream commit 09be178400829dddc1189b50a7888495dd26aa84 ]
    
    If the number of input parameters is less than the total parameters, an
    EINVAL error will be returned.
    
    For example, we use proc_doulongvec_minmax to pass up to two parameters
    with kern_table:
    
    {
            .procname       = "monitor_signals",
            .data           = &monitor_sigs,
            .maxlen         = 2*sizeof(unsigned long),
            .mode           = 0644,
            .proc_handler   = proc_doulongvec_minmax,
    },
    
    Reproduce:
    
    When passing two parameters, it's work normal.  But passing only one
    parameter, an error "Invalid argument"(EINVAL) is returned.
    
      [root@cl150 ~]# echo 1 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      [root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      1       2
      [root@cl150 ~]# echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      -bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
      [root@cl150 ~]# echo $?
      1
      [root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      3       2
      [root@cl150 ~]#
    
    The following is the result after apply this patch.  No error is
    returned when the number of input parameters is less than the total
    parameters.
    
      [root@cl150 ~]# echo 1 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      [root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      1       2
      [root@cl150 ~]# echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      [root@cl150 ~]# echo $?
      0
      [root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor_signals
      3       2
      [root@cl150 ~]#
    
    There are three processing functions dealing with digital parameters,
    __do_proc_dointvec/__do_proc_douintvec/__do_proc_doulongvec_minmax.
    
    This patch deals with __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax, just as
    __do_proc_dointvec does, adding a check for parameters 'left'.  In
    __do_proc_douintvec, its code implementation explicitly does not support
    multiple inputs.
    
    static int __do_proc_douintvec(...){
             ...
             /*
              * Arrays are not supported, keep this simple. *Do not* add
              * support for them.
              */
             if (vleft != 1) {
                     *lenp = 0;
                     return -EINVAL;
             }
             ...
    }
    
    So, just __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax has the problem.  And most use of
    proc_doulongvec_minmax/proc_doulongvec_ms_jiffies_minmax just have one
    parameter.

    kernel/hung_task.c: break RCU locks based on jiffies
    
    [ Upstream commit 304ae42739b108305f8d7b3eb3c1aec7c2b643a9 ]
    
    check_hung_uninterruptible_tasks() is currently calling rcu_lock_break()
    for every 1024 threads.  But check_hung_task() is very slow if printk()
    was called, and is very fast otherwise.
    
    If many threads within some 1024 threads called printk(), the RCU grace
    period might be extended enough to trigger RCU stall warnings.
    Therefore, calling rcu_lock_break() for every some fixed jiffies will be
    safer.

    thermal: generic-adc: Fix adc to temp interpolation
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d216211fded20fff301d0317af3238d8383634c ]
    
    First correct the edge case to return the last element if we're
    outside the range, rather than at the last element, so that
    interpolation is not omitted for points between the two last entries in
    the table.
    
    Then correct the formula to perform linear interpolation based the two
    points surrounding the read ADC value. The indices for temp are kept as
    "hi" and "lo" to pair with the adc indices, but there's no requirement
    that the temperature is provided in descendent order. mult_frac() is
    used to prevent issues with overflowing the int.

    block/swim3: Fix -EBUSY error when re-opening device after unmount
    
    [ Upstream commit 296dcc40f2f2e402facf7cd26cf3f2c8f4b17d47 ]
    
    When the block device is opened with FMODE_EXCL, ref_count is set to -1.
    This value doesn't get reset when the device is closed which means the
    device cannot be opened again. Fix this by checking for refcount <= 0
    in the release method.

    gdrom: fix a memory leak bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 093c48213ee37c3c3ff1cf5ac1aa2a9d8bc66017 ]
    
    In probe_gdrom(), the buffer pointed by 'gd.cd_info' is allocated through
    kzalloc() and is used to hold the information of the gdrom device. To
    register and unregister the device, the pointer 'gd.cd_info' is passed to
    the functions register_cdrom() and unregister_cdrom(), respectively.
    However, this buffer is not freed after it is used, which can cause a
    memory leak bug.
    
    This patch simply frees the buffer 'gd.cd_info' in exit_gdrom() to fix the
    above issue.

    isdn: hisax: hfc_pci: Fix a possible concurrency use-after-free bug in HFCPCI_l1hw()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7418e6520f22a2e35815122fa5a53d5bbfa2c10f ]
    
    In drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c, the functions hfcpci_interrupt() and
    HFCPCI_l1hw() may be concurrently executed.
    
    HFCPCI_l1hw()

      line 942: spin_lock_irqsave();
      line 1066: dev_kfree_skb_irq(cs->tx_skb);
    
    Thus, a possible concurrency use-after-free bug may occur
    in HFCPCI_l1hw().
    
    To fix these bugs, the calls to spin_lock_irqsave() and
    spin_unlock_irqrestore() are added in HFCPCI_l1hw(), to protect the
    access to cs->tx_skb.

    ocfs2: don't clear bh uptodate for block read
    
    [ Upstream commit 70306d9dce75abde855cefaf32b3f71eed8602a3 ]
    
    For sync io read in ocfs2_read_blocks_sync(), first clear bh uptodate flag
    and submit the io, second wait io done, last check whether bh uptodate, if
    not return io error.
    
    If two sync io for the same bh were issued, it could be the first io done
    and set uptodate flag, but just before check that flag, the second io came
    in and cleared uptodate, then ocfs2_read_blocks_sync() for the first io
    will return IO error.
    
    Indeed it's not necessary to clear uptodate flag, as the io end handler
    end_buffer_read_sync() will set or clear it based on io succeed or failed.
    
    The following message was found from a nfs server but the underlying
    storage returned no error.
    
    [4106438.567376] (nfsd,7146,3):ocfs2_get_suballoc_slot_bit:2780 ERROR: read block 1238823695 failed -5

    whose extent nodes list is corrupted since sbi and sbi->extent_list
    is freed up. The list_del corruption issue is observed when the
    file system is getting unmounted and when those recoverd files extent

    RHBZ: 1021460
    
    There is an issue where when multiple threads open/close the same directory
    ntwrk_buf_start might end up being NULL, causing the call to smbCalcSize
    later to oops with a NULL deref.
    
    The real bug is why this happens and why this can become NULL for an
    open cfile, which should not be allowed.
    This patch tries to avoid a oops until the time when we fix the underlying
    issue.

    MIPS: ralink: Select CONFIG_CPU_MIPSR2_IRQ_VI on MT7620/8
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b15394475e3bcaf35ca4bf22fc55d56df67224e ]
    
    Testing has shown, that when using mainline U-Boot on MT7688 based
    boards, the system may hang or crash while mounting the root-fs. The
    main issue here is that mainline U-Boot configures EBase to a value
    near the end of system memory. And with CONFIG_CPU_MIPSR2_IRQ_VI
    disabled, trap_init() will not allocate a new area to place the
    exception handler. The original value will be used and the handler
    will be copied to this location, which might already be used by some
    userspace application.
    
    The MT7688 supports VI - its config3 register is 0x00002420, so VInt
    (Bit 5) is set. But without setting CONFIG_CPU_MIPSR2_IRQ_VI this
    bit will not be evaluated to result in "cpu_has_vi" being set. This
    patch now selects CONFIG_CPU_MIPSR2_IRQ_VI on MT7620/8 which results
    trap_init() to allocate some memory for the exception handler.
    
    Please note that this issue was not seen with the Mediatek U-Boot
    version, as it does not touch EBase (stays at default of 0x8000.0000).
    This is strictly also not correct as the kernel (_text) resides
    here.

    seq_buf: Make seq_buf_puts() null-terminate the buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit 0464ed24380905d640030d368cd84a4e4d1e15e2 ]
    
    Currently seq_buf_puts() will happily create a non null-terminated
    string for you in the buffer. This is particularly dangerous if the
    buffer is on the stack.
    
    For example:
    
      char buf[8];
      char secret = "secret";
      struct seq_buf s;
    
      seq_buf_init(&s, buf, sizeof(buf));
      seq_buf_puts(&s, "foo");
      printk("Message is %s\n", buf);
    
    Can result in:
    
      Message is fooªªªªªsecret
    
    We could require all users to memset() their buffer to zero before
    use. But that seems likely to be forgotten and lead to bugs.
    
    Instead we can change seq_buf_puts() to always leave the buffer in a
    null-terminated state.
    
    The only downside is that this makes the buffer 1 character smaller
    for seq_buf_puts(), but that seems like a good trade off.

    NFS: nfs_compare_mount_options always compare auth flavors.
    
    [ Upstream commit 594d1644cd59447f4fceb592448d5cd09eb09b5e ]
    
    This patch removes the check from nfs_compare_mount_options to see if a
    `sec' option was passed for the current mount before comparing auth
    flavors and instead just always compares auth flavors.
    
    Consider the following scenario:
    
    You have a server with the address 192.168.1.1 and two exports /export/a
    and /export/b.  The first export supports `sys' and `krb5' security, the
    second just `sys'.
    
    Assume you start with no mounts from the server.
    
    The following results in EIOs being returned as the kernel nfs client
    incorrectly thinks it can share the underlying `struct nfs_server's:
    
    $ mkdir /tmp/{a,b}
    $ sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3,sec=krb5 192.168.1.1:/export/a /tmp/a
    $ sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3          192.168.1.1:/export/b /tmp/b
    $ df >/dev/null

    fbdev: fbcon: Fix unregister crash when more than one framebuffer
    
    [ Upstream commit 2122b40580dd9d0620398739c773d07a7b7939d0 ]
    
    When unregistering fbdev using unregister_framebuffer(), any bound
    console will unbind automatically. This is working fine if this is the
    only framebuffer, resulting in a switch to the dummy console. However if
    there is a fb0 and I unregister fb1 having a bound console, I eventually
    get a crash. The fastest way for me to trigger the crash is to do a
    reboot, resulting in this splat:

    [ Upstream commit 1fb3a7a75e2efcc83ef21f2434069cddd6fae6f5 ]
    
    I210 ethernet card doesn't wakeup when a cable gets plugged. It's
    because its PME is not set.
    
    Since commit 42eca2302146 ("PCI: Don't touch card regs after runtime
    suspend D3"), if the PCI state is saved, pci_pm_runtime_suspend() stops
    calling pci_finish_runtime_suspend(), which enables the PCI PME.
    
    To fix the issue, let's not to save PCI states when it's runtime
    suspend, to let the PCI subsystem enables PME.

    fbdev: fbmem: behave better with small rotated displays and many CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit f75df8d4b4fabfad7e3cba2debfad12741c6fde7 ]
    
    Blitting an image with "negative" offsets is not working since there
    is no clipping. It hopefully just crashes. For the bootup logo, there
    is protection so that blitting does not happen as the image is drawn
    further and further to the right (ROTATE_UR) or further and further

    drbd: skip spurious timeout (ping-timeo) when failing promote
    
    [ Upstream commit 9848b6ddd8c92305252f94592c5e278574e7a6ac ]
    
    If you try to promote a Secondary while connected to a Primary
    and allow-two-primaries is NOT set, we will wait for "ping-timeout"
    to give this node a chance to detect a dead primary,
    in case the cluster manager noticed faster than we did.
    
    But if we then are *still* connected to a Primary,
    we fail (after an additional timeout of ping-timout).
    
    This change skips the spurious second timeout.
    
    Most people won't notice really,
    since "ping-timeout" by default is half a second.
    
    But in some installations, ping-timeout may be 10 or 20 seconds or more,
    and spuriously delaying the error return becomes annoying.

    drbd: disconnect, if the wrong UUIDs are attached on a connected peer
    
    [ Upstream commit b17b59602b6dcf8f97a7dc7bc489a48388d7063a ]
    
    With "on-no-data-accessible suspend-io", DRBD requires the next attach
    or connect to be to the very same data generation uuid tag it lost last.
    
    If we first lost connection to the peer,
    then later lost connection to our own disk,
    we would usually refuse to re-connect to the peer,
    because it presents the wrong data set.
    
    However, if the peer first connects without a disk,
    and then attached its disk, we accepted that same wrong data set,
    which would be "unexpected" by any user of that DRBD
    and cause "undefined results" (read: very likely data corruption).
    
    The fix is to forcefully disconnect as soon as we notice that the peer
    attached to the "wrong" dataset.

    drbd: narrow rcu_read_lock in drbd_sync_handshake
    
    [ Upstream commit d29e89e34952a9ad02c77109c71a80043544296e ]
    
    So far there was the possibility that we called
    genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO)/mutex_lock() while holding an rcu_read_lock().
    
    This included cases like:
    
    drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
      drbd_asb_recover_1p
        drbd_khelper
          drbd_bcast_event
            genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO) --> may sleep
    
    drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
      drbd_asb_recover_1p
        drbd_khelper
          notify_helper
            genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO) --> may sleep
    
    drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
      drbd_asb_recover_1p
        drbd_khelper
          notify_helper
            mutex_lock --> may sleep
    
    While using GFP_ATOMIC whould have been possible in the first two cases,
    the real fix is to narrow the rcu_read_lock.

    cw1200: Fix concurrency use-after-free bugs in cw1200_hw_scan()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f68ef64cd7feb1220232bd8f501d8aad340a099 ]
    
    The function cw1200_bss_info_changed() and cw1200_hw_scan() can be
    concurrently executed.
    The two functions both access a possible shared variable "frame.skb".
    
    This shared variable is freed by dev_kfree_skb() in cw1200_upload_beacon(),
    which is called by cw1200_bss_info_changed(). The free operation is
    protected by a mutex lock "priv->conf_mutex" in cw1200_bss_info_changed().
    
    In cw1200_hw_scan(), this shared variable is accessed without the
    protection of the mutex lock "priv->conf_mutex".
    Thus, concurrency use-after-free bugs may occur.
    
    To fix these bugs, the original calls to mutex_lock(&priv->conf_mutex) and
    mutex_unlock(&priv->conf_mutex) are moved to the places, which can
    protect the accesses to the shared variable.

    [ Upstream commit efc38dd7d5fa5c8cdd0c917c5d00947aa0539443 ]
    
    Due to the alignment handling, it actually matters where in the code
    we add the 4 bytes for the presence bitmap to the length; the first
    field is the timestamp with 8 byte alignment so we need to add the
    space for the extra vendor namespace presence bitmap *before* we do
    any alignment for the fields.
    
    Move the presence bitmap length accounting to the right place to fix
    the alignment for the data properly.

    arm64: KVM: Skip MMIO insn after emulation
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d640732dbebed0f10f18526de21652931f0b2f2 ]
    
    When we emulate an MMIO instruction, we advance the CPU state within
    decode_hsr(), before emulating the instruction effects.
    
    Having this logic in decode_hsr() is opaque, and advancing the state
    before emulation is problematic. It gets in the way of applying
    consistent single-step logic, and it prevents us from being able to fail
    an MMIO instruction with a synchronous exception.
    
    Clean this up by only advancing the CPU state *after* the effects of the
    instruction are emulated.

    perf probe: Fix unchecked usage of strncpy()
    
    [ Upstream commit bef0b8970f27da5ca223e522a174d03e2587761d ]
    
    The strncpy() function may leave the destination string buffer
    unterminated, better use strlcpy() that we have a __weak fallback
    implementation for systems without it.
    
    In this case the 'target' buffer is coming from a list of build-ids that
    are expected to have a len of at most (SBUILD_ID_SIZE - 1) chars, so
    probably we're safe, but since we're using strncpy() here, use strlcpy()
    instead to provide the intended safety checking without the using the
    problematic strncpy() function.

    memstick: Prevent memstick host from getting runtime suspended during card detection
    
    [ Upstream commit e03e303edf1c63e6dd455ccd568c74e93ef3ba8c ]
    
    We can use MEMSTICK_POWER_{ON,OFF} along with pm_runtime_{get,put}
    helpers to let memstick host support runtime pm.
    
    The rpm count may go down to zero before the memstick host powers on, so
    the host can be runtime suspended.
    
    So before doing card detection, increment the rpm count to avoid the
    host gets runtime suspended. Balance the rpm count after card detection
    is done.

    and include <asm/mach-types.h> header file in order to be able
    to use some machine_is_eukrea_xxx() macros.

    sound/soc/fsl/eukrea-tlv320.c:28:10: fatal error: asm/mach-types.h: No such file or directory
    
    Avoid this error by not allowing to build the SND_SOC_EUKREA_TLV320
    driver when ARM64 is selected.
    
    This is needed in preparation for the i.MX8M support.

    i2c-axxia: check for error conditions first
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f5c85fe3a60ace555d09898166af372547f97fc ]
    
    It was observed that when using seqentional mode contrary to the
    documentation, the SS bit (which is supposed to only be set if
    automatic/sequence command completed normally), is sometimes set
    together with NA (NAK in address phase) causing transfer to falsely be
    considered successful.
    
    My assumption is that this does not happen during manual mode since the
    controller is stopping its work the moment it sets NA/ND bit in status
    register. This is not the case in Automatic/Sequentional mode where it
    is still working to send STOP condition and the actual status we get
    depends on the time when the ISR is run.
    
    This patch changes the order of checking status bits in ISR - error
    conditions are checked first and only if none of them occurred, the
    transfer may be considered successful. This is required to introduce
    using of sequentional mode in next patch.

    iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use explicit mb() when moving cons pointer
    
    [ Upstream commit a868e8530441286342f90c1fd9c5f24de3aa2880 ]
    
    After removing an entry from a queue (e.g. reading an event in
    arm_smmu_evtq_thread()) it is necessary to advance the MMIO consumer
    pointer to free the queue slot back to the SMMU. A memory barrier is
    required here so that all reads targetting the queue entry have
    completed before the consumer pointer is updated.
    
    The implementation of queue_inc_cons() relies on a writel() to complete
    the previous reads, but this is incorrect because writel() is only
    guaranteed to complete prior writes. This patch replaces the call to
    writel() with an mb(); writel_relaxed() sequence, which gives us the
    read->write ordering which we require.

    ARM: dts: Fix OMAP4430 SDP Ethernet startup
    
    [ Upstream commit 84fb6c7feb1494ebb7d1ec8b95cfb7ada0264465 ]
    
    It was noticed that unbinding and rebinding the KSZ8851 ethernet
    resulted in the driver reporting "failed to read device ID" at probe.
    Probing the reset line with a 'scope while repeatedly attempting to
    bind the driver in a shell loop revealed that the KSZ8851 RSTN pin is
    constantly held at zero, meaning the device is held in reset, and
    does not respond on the SPI bus.
    
    Experimentation with the startup delay on the regulator set to 50ms
    shows that the reset is positively released after 20ms.
    
    Schematics for this board are not available, and the traces are buried
    in the inner layers of the board which makes tracing where the RSTN pin
    extremely difficult.  We can only guess that the RSTN pin is wired to a
    reset generator chip driven off the ethernet supply, which fits the
    observed behaviour.
    
    Include this delay in the regulator startup delay - effectively
    treating the reset as a "supply stable" indicator.
    
    This can not be modelled as a delay in the KSZ8851 driver since the
    reset generation is board specific - if the RSTN pin had been wired to
    a GPIO, reset could be released earlier via the already provided support
    in the KSZ8851 driver.
    
    This also got confirmed by Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com> based
    on Blaze schematics that should be very close to SDP4430:
    
    TPS22902YFPR is used as the regulator switch (gpio48 controlled):
    Convert arm boot_lock to raw The VOUT is routed to TPS3808G01DBV.
    (SCH Note: Threshold set at 90%. Vsense: 0.405V).
    
    According to the TPS3808 data sheet the RESET delay time when Ct is
    open (this is the case in the schema): MIN/TYP/MAX: 12/20/28 ms.

    [ Upstream commit 6e6da2039c82271dd873b9ad2b902a692a7dd554 ]
    
    All the audio interfaces on Allwinner SoCs need to change their module
    clocks during operation, to switch between support for 44.1 kHz and 48
    kHz family sample rates. The clock rate for the module clocks is
    governed by their upstream audio PLL. The module clocks themselves only
    have a gate, and sometimes a divider or mux. Thus any rate changes need
    to be propagated upstream.
    
    Set the CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag for all audio module clocks to achieve
    this.

    When initializing a hub we want to give a USB3 port in link training

    USB3 ports won't reach the enabled state with "current connect status" and
    "connect status change" bits set until the USB3 link training finishes.
    
    Catching the port in link training (polling) and adding the debounce delay
    prevents unnecessary failed attempts to autosuspend the hub.

    Every user of user_insn() passes an user memory pointer to this macro.
    
    Add might_fault() to user_insn() so we can spot users which are using

    ARM: dts: mmp2: fix TWSI2
    
    [ Upstream commit 1147e05ac9fc2ef86a3691e7ca5c2db7602d81dd ]
    
    Marvell keeps their MMP2 datasheet secret, but there are good clues
    that TWSI2 is not on 0xd4025000 on that platform, not does it use
    IRQ 58. In fact, the IRQ 58 on MMP2 seems to be a signal processor:
    
       arch/arm/mach-mmp/irqs.h:#define IRQ_MMP2_MSP  58
    
    I'm taking a somewhat educated guess that is probably a copy & paste
    error from PXA168 or PXA910 and that the real controller in fact hides
    at address 0xd4031000 and uses an interrupt line multiplexed via IRQ 17.
    
    I'm also copying some properties from TWSI1 that were missing or
    incorrect.
    
    Tested on a OLPC XO 1.75 machine, where the RTC is on TWSI2.

    arm64: ftrace: don't adjust the LR value
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e803e2e6e367db9a0d6ecae1bd24bb5752011bd ]
    
    The core ftrace code requires that when it is handed the PC of an
    instrumented function, this PC is the address of the instrumented
    instruction. This is necessary so that the core ftrace code can identify
    the specific instrumentation site. Since the instrumented function will
    be a BL, the address of the instrumented function is LR - 4 at entry to
    the ftrace code.
    
    This fixup is applied in the mcount_get_pc and mcount_get_pc0 helpers,
    which acquire the PC of the instrumented function.
    
    The mcount_get_lr helper is used to acquire the LR of the instrumented
    function, whose value does not require this adjustment, and cannot be
    adjusted to anything meaningful. No adjustment of this value is made on
    other architectures, including arm. However, arm64 adjusts this value by
    4.
    
    This patch brings arm64 in line with other architectures and removes the
    adjustment of the LR value.

    firmware/efi: Add NULL pointer checks in efivars API functions
    
    [ Upstream commit ab2180a15ce54739fed381efb4cb12e78dfb1561 ]
    
    Since commit:
    
       ce2e6db554fa ("brcmfmac: Add support for getting nvram contents from EFI variables")
    
    we have a device driver accessing the efivars API. Several functions in
    the efivars API assume __efivars is set, i.e., that they will be accessed
    only after efivars_register() has been called. However, the following NULL
    pointer access was reported calling efivar_entry_size() from the brcmfmac
    device driver:
    
      Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000008
      pgd = 60bfa5f1
      [00000008] *pgd=00000000
      Internal error: Oops: 5 [#1] SMP ARM
      ...

    Disassembly showed that the local static variable __efivars is NULL,
    which is not entirely unexpected given that it is a non-EFI platform.
    
    So add a NULL pointer check to efivar_entry_size(), and to related
    functions while at it. In efivars_register() a couple of sanity checks
    are added as well.

    Thermal: do not clear passive state during system sleep
    
    [ Upstream commit 964f4843a455d2ffb199512b08be8d5f077c4cac ]
    
    commit ff140fea847e ("Thermal: handle thermal zone device properly
    during system sleep") added PM hook to call thermal zone reset during
    sleep. However resetting thermal zone will also clear the passive state
    and thus cancel the polling queue which leads the passive cooling device
    state not being cleared properly after sleep.
    
    thermal_pm_notify => thermal_zone_device_reset set passive to 0
    thermal_zone_trip_update will skip update passive as `old_target ==
    instance->target'.
    monitor_thermal_zone => thermal_zone_device_set_polling will cancel
    tz->poll_queue, so the cooling device state will not be changed
    afterwards.

    media: adv*/tc358743/ths8200: fill in min width/height/pixelclock
    
    [ Upstream commit 2912289a518077ddb8214e05336700148e97e235 ]
    
    The v4l2_dv_timings_cap struct is used to do sanity checks when setting and
    enumerating DV timings, ensuring that only valid timings as per the HW
    capabilities are allowed.
    
    However, many drivers just filled in 0 for the minimum width, height or
    pixelclock frequency. This can cause timings with e.g. 0 as width and height
    to be accepted, which will in turn lead to a potential division by zero.
    
    Fill in proper values are minimum boundaries. 640x350 was chosen since it is
    the smallest resolution in v4l2-dv-timings.h. Same for 13 MHz as the lowest
    pixelclock frequency (it's slightly below the minimum of 13.5 MHz in the
    v4l2-dv-timings.h header).

    KIOX020A for the accelerometer in the keyboard.

    accelerometer in the keyboard, this commit just adds the KIOX010A HID
    for now so that display rotation will work.

    perf tools: Add Hygon Dhyana support
    
    [ Upstream commit 4787eff3fa88f62fede6ed7afa06477ae6bf984d ]
    
    The tool perf is useful for the performance analysis on the Hygon Dhyana
    platform. But right now there is no Hygon support for it to analyze the
    KVM guest os data. So add Hygon Dhyana support to it by checking vendor
    string to share the code path of AMD.

    modpost: validate symbol names also in find_elf_symbol
    
    [ Upstream commit 5818c683a619c534c113e1f66d24f636defc29bc ]
    
    If an ARM mapping symbol shares an address with a valid symbol,
    find_elf_symbol can currently return the mapping symbol instead, as the
    symbol is not validated. This can result in confusing warnings:
    
      WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x18f4028): Section mismatch in reference
      from the function set_reset_devices() to the variable .init.text:$x.0
    
    This change adds a call to is_valid_name to find_elf_symbol, similarly
    to how it's already used in find_elf_symbol2.

    ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix some section annotations
    
    [ Upstream commit c10b26abeb53cabc1e6271a167d3f3d396ce0218 ]
    
    When building the kernel with Clang, the following section mismatch
    warnings appears:
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d398): Section mismatch in reference from
    the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_iclk_autoidle()
    The function _setup() references
    the function __init _setup_iclk_autoidle().
    This is often because _setup lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of _setup_iclk_autoidle is wrong.
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d3a0): Section mismatch in reference from
    the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_reset()
    The function _setup() references
    the function __init _setup_reset().
    This is often because _setup lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of _setup_reset is wrong.
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d408): Section mismatch in reference from
    the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_postsetup()
    The function _setup() references
    the function __init _setup_postsetup().
    This is often because _setup lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of _setup_postsetup is wrong.
    
    _setup is used in omap_hwmod_allocate_module, which isn't marked __init
    and looks like it shouldn't be, meaning to fix these warnings, those
    functions must be moved out of the init section, which this patch does.

    [ Upstream commit b3a3eafeef769c6982e15f83631dcbf8d1794efb ]
    
    Previously, ad2s90_probe ignored the return code from spi_setup, not
    handling its possible failure. This patch makes ad2s90_probe check if
    the code is an error code and, if so, do the following:
    
    - Call dev_err with an appropriate error message.
    - Return the spi_setup's error code.
    
    Note: The 'return ret' statement could be out of the 'if' block, but
    this whole block will be moved up in the function in the patch:

    drm/vc4: ->x_scaling[1] should never be set to VC4_SCALING_NONE
    
    [ Upstream commit 0560054da5673b25d56bea6c57c8d069673af73b ]
    
    For the YUV conversion to work properly, ->x_scaling[1] should never
    be set to VC4_SCALING_NONE, but vc4_get_scaling_mode() might return
    VC4_SCALING_NONE if the horizontal scaling ratio exactly matches the
    horizontal subsampling factor. Add a test to turn VC4_SCALING_NONE
    into VC4_SCALING_PPF when that happens.
    
    The old ->x_scaling[0] adjustment is dropped as I couldn't find any
    mention to this constraint in the spec and it's proven to be
    unnecessary (I tested various multi-planar YUV formats with scaling
    disabled, and all of them worked fine without this adjustment).

    powerpc/pseries: add of_node_put() in dlpar_detach_node()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b3f5c408d8cc59b87e47f1ab9803dbd006e4a91 ]
    
    The previous commit, "of: overlay: add missing of_node_get() in
    __of_attach_node_sysfs" added a missing of_node_get() to
    __of_attach_node_sysfs().  This results in a refcount imbalance
    for nodes attached with dlpar_attach_node().  The calling sequence
    from dlpar_attach_node() to __of_attach_node_sysfs() is:
    
       dlpar_attach_node()
          of_attach_node()
             __of_attach_node_sysfs()
    
    For more detailed description of the node refcount, see

    [ Upstream commit 53bb565fc5439f2c8c57a786feea5946804aa3e9 ]
    
    In the expression "word1 << 16", word1 starts as u16, but is promoted to a
    signed int, then sign-extended to resource_size_t, which is probably not
    what was intended.  Cast to resource_size_t to avoid the sign extension.

    [ Upstream commit 82c08c3e7f171aa7f579b231d0abbc1d62e91974 ]
    
    In case panic() and panic() called at the same time on different CPUS.
    For example:
    CPU 0:
      panic()
         __crash_kexec
           machine_crash_shutdown
             crash_smp_send_stop
           machine_kexec
             BUG_ON(num_online_cpus() > 1);
    
    CPU 1:
      panic()
        local_irq_disable
        panic_smp_self_stop
    
    If CPU 1 calls panic_smp_self_stop() before crash_smp_send_stop(), kdump
    fails. CPU1 can't receive the ipi irq, CPU1 will be always online.
    To fix this problem, this patch split out the panic_smp_self_stop()
    and add set_cpu_online(smp_processor_id(), false).

    [ Upstream commit 819bec35c8c9706185498c9222bd244e0781ad35 ]
    
    Prevent possible race by parallel threads between ipu_image_convert_run()
    and ipu_image_convert_unprepare(). This involves setting ctx->aborting
    to true unconditionally so that no new job runs can be queued during
    unprepare, and holding the ctx->aborting flag until the context is freed.
    
    Note that the "normal" ipu_image_convert_abort() case (e.g. not during
    context unprepare) should clear the ctx->aborting flag after aborting
    any active run and clearing the context's pending queue. This is because
    it should be possible to continue to use the conversion context and queue
    more runs after an abort.

    idx can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to a
    potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

    drivers/gpu/drm/drm_bufs.c:1420 drm_legacy_freebufs() warn: potential
    spectre issue 'dma->buflist' [r] (local cap)
    
    Fix this by sanitizing idx before using it to index dma->buflist
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].
