    commit 2133c4fc8e1348dcb752f267a143fe2254613b34 upstream.
    
    The initialization of pointer dev dereferences pointer edp before
    edp is null checked, so there is a potential null pointer deference
    issue. Fix this by only dereferencing edp after edp has been null
    checked.

    ethernet: s2io: fix setting mac address during resume
    
    commit 40507e7aada8422c38aafa0c8a1a09e4623c712a upstream.
    
    After recent cleanups, gcc started warning about a suspicious
    memcpy() call during the s2io_io_resume() function:
    
    In function '__dev_addr_set',
        inlined from 'eth_hw_addr_set' at include/linux/etherdevice.h:318:2,
        inlined from 's2io_set_mac_addr' at drivers/net/ethernet/neterion/s2io.c:5205:2,
        inlined from 's2io_io_resume' at drivers/net/ethernet/neterion/s2io.c:8569:7:
    arch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: error: '__builtin_memcpy' accessing 6 bytes at offsets 0 and 2 overlaps 4 bytes at offset 2 [-Werror=restrict]
      182 | #define memcpy(t, f, n) __builtin_memcpy(t, f, n)
          |                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    include/linux/netdevice.h:4648:9: note: in expansion of macro 'memcpy'
     4648 |         memcpy(dev->dev_addr, addr, len);
          |         ^~~~~~
    
    What apparently happened is that an old cleanup changed the calling
    conventions for s2io_set_mac_addr() from taking an ethernet address
    as a character array to taking a struct sockaddr, but one of the
    callers was not changed at the same time.
    
    Change it to instead call the low-level do_s2io_prog_unicast() function
    that still takes the old argument type.

    sctp: account stream padding length for reconf chunk
    
    commit a2d859e3fc97e79d907761550dbc03ff1b36479c upstream.
    
    sctp_make_strreset_req() makes repeated calls to sctp_addto_chunk()
    which will automatically account for padding on each call. inreq and
    outreq are already 4 bytes aligned, but the payload is not and doing
    SCTP_PAD4(a + b) (which _sctp_make_chunk() did implicitly here) is
    different from SCTP_PAD4(a) + SCTP_PAD4(b) and not enough. It led to
    possible attempt to use more buffer than it was allocated and triggered
    a BUG_ON.

    The ssp_print_mcu_debug() function should return negative error codes on
    error.  Returning "length" is meaningless.  This change does not affect
    runtime because the callers only care about zero/non-zero.

    x86/Kconfig: Do not enable AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT_ACTIVE_BY_DEFAULT automatically
    
    commit 711885906b5c2df90746a51f4cd674f1ab9fbb1d upstream.
    
    This Kconfig option was added initially so that memory encryption is
    enabled by default on machines which support it.
    
    However, devices which have DMA masks that are less than the bit
    position of the encryption bit, aka C-bit, require the use of an IOMMU
    or the use of SWIOTLB.
    
    If the IOMMU is disabled or in passthrough mode, the kernel would switch
    to SWIOTLB bounce-buffering for those transfers.
    
    In order to avoid that,
    
      2cc13bb4f59f ("iommu: Disable passthrough mode when SME is active")
    
    disables the default IOMMU passthrough mode so that devices for which the
    default 256K DMA is insufficient, can use the IOMMU instead.
    
    However 2, there are cases where the IOMMU is disabled in the BIOS, etc.
    (think the usual hardware folk "oops, I dropped the ball there" cases) or a
    driver doesn't properly use the DMA APIs or a device has a firmware or
    hardware bug, e.g.:
    
      ea68573d408f ("drm/amdgpu: Fail to load on RAVEN if SME is active")
    
    However 3, in the above GPU use case, there are APIs like Vulkan and
    some OpenGL/OpenCL extensions which are under the assumption that
    user-allocated memory can be passed in to the kernel driver and both the
    GPU and CPU can do coherent and concurrent access to the same memory.
    That cannot work with SWIOTLB bounce buffers, of course.
    
    So, in order for those devices to function, drop the "default y" for the
    SME by default active option so that users who want to have SME enabled,
    will need to either enable it in their config or use "mem_encrypt=on" on
    the kernel command line.

    nvmem: Fix shift-out-of-bound (UBSAN) with byte size cells
    
    commit 5d388fa01fa6eb310ac023a363a6cb216d9d8fe9 upstream.
    
    If a cell has 'nbits' equal to a multiple of BITS_PER_BYTE the logic
    
     *p &= GENMASK((cell->nbits%BITS_PER_BYTE) - 1, 0);
    
    will become undefined behavior because nbits modulo BITS_PER_BYTE is 0, and we
    subtract one from that making a large number that is then shifted more than the
    number of bits that fit into an unsigned long.
    
    UBSAN reports this problem:

    virtio: write back F_VERSION_1 before validate
    
    commit 2f9a174f918e29608564c7a4e8329893ab604fb4 upstream.
    
    The virtio specification virtio-v1.1-cs01 states: "Transitional devices
    MUST detect Legacy drivers by detecting that VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 has not
    been acknowledged by the driver."  This is exactly what QEMU as of 6.1
    has done relying solely on VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 for detecting that.
    
    However, the specification also says: "... the driver MAY read (but MUST
    NOT write) the device-specific configuration fields to check that it can
    support the device ..." before setting FEATURES_OK.
    
    In that case, any transitional device relying solely on
    VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 for detecting legacy drivers will return data in
    legacy format.  In particular, this implies that it is in big endian
    format for big endian guests. This naturally confuses the driver which
    expects little endian in the modern mode.
    
    It is probably a good idea to amend the spec to clarify that
    VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 can only be relied on after the feature negotiation
    is complete. Before validate callback existed, config space was only
    read after FEATURES_OK. However, we already have two regressions, so
    let's address this here as well.
    
    The regressions affect the VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU feature of virtio-net and
    the VIRTIO_BLK_F_BLK_SIZE feature of virtio-blk for BE guests when
    virtio 1.0 is used on both sides. The latter renders virtio-blk unusable
    with DASD backing, because things simply don't work with the default.
    See Fixes tags for relevant commits.
    
    For QEMU, we can work around the issue by writing out the feature bits
    with VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 bit set.  We (ab)use the finalize_features
    config op for this. This isn't enough to address all vhost devices since
    these do not get the features until FEATURES_OK, however it looks like
    the affected devices actually never handled the endianness for legacy
    mode correctly, so at least that's not a regression.
    
    No devices except virtio net and virtio blk seem to be affected.
    
    Long term the right thing to do is to fix the hypervisors.

    USB: serial: qcserial: add EM9191 QDL support
    
    commit 11c52d250b34a0862edc29db03fbec23b30db6da upstream.
    
    When the module boots into QDL download mode it exposes the 1199:90d2
    ids, which can be mapped to the qcserial driver, and used to run
    firmware upgrades (e.g. with the qmi-firmware-update program).

    commit 3378a07daa6cdd11e042797454c706d1c69f9ca6 upstream.
    
    The Nacon GX100XF is already mapped, but it seems there is a Nacon
    GC-100 (identified as NC5136Wht PCGC-100WHITE though I believe other
    colours exist) with a different USB ID when in XInput mode.

    usb: musb: dsps: Fix the probe error path
    
    commit c2115b2b16421d93d4993f3fe4c520e91d6fe801 upstream.
    
    Commit 7c75bde329d7 ("usb: musb: musb_dsps: request_irq() after
    initializing musb") has inverted the calls to
    dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() and dsps_create_musb_pdev() without
    updating correctly the error path. dsps_create_musb_pdev() allocates and
    registers a new platform device which must be unregistered and freed
    with platform_device_unregister(), and this is missing upon
    dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() error.
    
    While on the master branch it seems not to trigger any issue, I observed
    a kernel crash because of a NULL pointer dereference with a v5.10.70
    stable kernel where the patch mentioned above was backported. With this
    kernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first time
    dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe to
    error out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, on
    the Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in the
    system is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during the
    boot phase triggers the crash.
    
    My limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commit
    which was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,
    does not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ to
    fire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannot
    ever happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the
    ->enable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platform
    device must be already registered in order for the core or any other
    user to use this callback.
    
    Hence, I decided to fix the error path, which might prevent future
    errors on mainline kernels while also fixing older ones.

    efi: Change down_interruptible() in virt_efi_reset_system() to down_trylock()
    
    commit 38fa3206bf441911258e5001ac8b6738693f8d82 upstream.
    
    While reboot the system by sysrq, the following bug will be occur.
    
    BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/semaphore.c:90

    The reason for this problem is that irq has been disabled in
    machine_restart() and then it calls down_interruptible() in
    virt_efi_reset_system(), which would occur sleep in irq context,
    it is dangerous! Commit 99409b935c9a("locking/semaphore: Add
    might_sleep() to down_*() family") add might_sleep() in
    down_interruptible(), so the bug info is here. down_trylock()
    can solve this problem, cause there is no might_sleep.

    efi/cper: use stack buffer for error record decoding
    
    commit b3a72ca80351917cc23f9e24c35f3c3979d3c121 upstream.
    
    Joe reports that using a statically allocated buffer for converting CPER
    error records into human readable text is probably a bad idea. Even
    though we are not aware of any actual issues, a stack buffer is clearly
    a better choice here anyway, so let's move the buffer into the stack
    frames of the two functions that refer to it.

    xhci: Fix command ring pointer corruption while aborting a command
    
    commit ff0e50d3564f33b7f4b35cadeabd951d66cfc570 upstream.
    
    The command ring pointer is located at [6:63] bits of the command
    ring control register (CRCR). All the control bits like command stop,
    abort are located at [0:3] bits. While aborting a command, we read the
    CRCR and set the abort bit and write to the CRCR. The read will always
    give command ring pointer as all zeros. So we essentially write only
    the control bits. Since we split the 64 bit write into two 32 bit writes,
    there is a possibility of xHC command ring stopped before the upper
    dword (all zeros) is written. If that happens, xHC updates the upper
    dword of its internal command ring pointer with all zeros. Next time,
    when the command ring is restarted, we see xHC memory access failures.
    Fix this issue by only writing to the lower dword of CRCR where all
    control bits are located.

    ALSA: seq: Fix a potential UAF by wrong private_free call order
    
    commit 1f8763c59c4ec6254d629fe77c0a52220bd907aa upstream.
    
    John Keeping reported and posted a patch for a potential UAF in
    rawmidi sequencer destruction: the snd_rawmidi_dev_seq_free() may be
    called after the associated rawmidi object got already freed.
    After a deeper look, it turned out that the bug is rather the
    incorrect private_free call order for a snd_seq_device.  The
    snd_seq_device private_free gets called at the release callback of the
    sequencer device object, while this was rather expected to be executed
    at the snd_device call chains that runs at the beginning of the whole
    card-free procedure.  It's been broken since the rewrite of
    sequencer-device binding (although it hasn't surfaced because the
    sequencer device release happens usually right along with the card
    device release).
    
    This patch corrects the private_free call to be done in the right
    place, at snd_seq_device_dev_free().

    stable: clamp SUBLEVEL in 4.14
    
    Right now SUBLEVEL is overflowing, and some userspace may start treating
    4.14.256 as 4.15. While out of tree modules have different ways of
    extracting the version number (and we're generally ok with breaking
    them), we do care about breaking userspace and it would appear that this
    overflow might do just that.
    
    Our rules around userspace ABI in the stable kernel are pretty simple:
    we don't break it. Thus, while userspace may be checking major/minor, it
    shouldn't be doing anything with sublevel.
    
    This patch applies a big band-aid to the 4.14 kernel in the form of
    clamping the sublevel to 255.
    
    The clamp is done for the purpose of LINUX_VERSION_CODE only, and
    extracting the version number from the Makefile or "make kernelversion"
    will continue to work as intended.
    
    We might need to do it later in newer trees, but maybe we'll have a
    better solution by then, so I'm ignoring that problem for now.
