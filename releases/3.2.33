    tpm: Propagate error from tpm_transmit to fix a timeout hang
    
    commit abce9ac292e13da367bbd22c1f7669f988d931ac upstream.
    
    tpm_write calls tpm_transmit without checking the return value and
    assigns the return value unconditionally to chip->pending_data, even if
    it's an error value.
    This causes three bugs.
    
    So if we write to /dev/tpm0 with a tpm_param_size bigger than
    TPM_BUFSIZE=0x1000 (e.g. 0x100a)
    and a bufsize also bigger than TPM_BUFSIZE (e.g. 0x100a)
    tpm_transmit returns -E2BIG which is assigned to chip->pending_data as
    -7, but tpm_write returns that TPM_BUFSIZE bytes have been successfully
    been written to the TPM, altough this is not true (bug #1).
    
    As we did write more than than TPM_BUFSIZE bytes but tpm_write reports
    that only TPM_BUFSIZE bytes have been written the vfs tries to write
    the remaining bytes (in this case 10 bytes) to the tpm device driver via
    tpm_write which then blocks at
    
     /* cannot perform a write until the read has cleared
     either via tpm_read or a user_read_timer timeout */
     while (atomic_read(&chip->data_pending) != 0)
             msleep(TPM_TIMEOUT);
    
    for 60 seconds, since data_pending is -7 and nobody is able to
    read it (since tpm_read luckily checks if data_pending is greater than
    0) (#bug 2).
    
    After that the remaining bytes are written to the TPM which are
    interpreted by the tpm as a normal command. (bug #3)
    So if the last bytes of the command stream happen to be a e.g.
    tpm_force_clear this gets accidentally sent to the TPM.
    
    This patch fixes all three bugs, by propagating the error code of
    tpm_write and returning -E2BIG if the input buffer is too big,
    since the response from the tpm for a truncated value is bogus anyway.
    Moreover it returns -EBUSY to userspace if there is a response ready to be
    read.

    netfilter: nf_conntrack: fix racy timer handling with reliable events
    
    commit 5b423f6a40a0327f9d40bc8b97ce9be266f74368 upstream.
    
    Existing code assumes that del_timer returns true for alive conntrack
    entries. However, this is not true if reliable events are enabled.
    In that case, del_timer may return true for entries that were
    just inserted in the dying list. Note that packets / ctnetlink may
    hold references to conntrack entries that were just inserted to such
    list.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by adding an independent timer for
    event delivery. This increases the size of the ecache extension.
    Still we can revisit this later and use variable size extensions
    to allocate this area on demand.

    gen_init_cpio: avoid stack overflow when expanding
    
    commit 20f1de659b77364d55d4e7fad2ef657e7730323f upstream.
    
    Fix possible overflow of the buffer used for expanding environment
    variables when building file list.
    
    In the extremely unlikely case of an attacker having control over the
    environment variables visible to gen_init_cpio, control over the
    contents of the file gen_init_cpio parses, and gen_init_cpio was built
    without compiler hardening, the attacker can gain arbitrary execution
    control via a stack buffer overflow.
    
      $ cat usr/crash.list
      file foo ${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG}${BIG} 0755 0 0
      $ BIG=$(perl -e 'print "A" x 4096;') ./usr/gen_init_cpio usr/crash.list
      *** buffer overflow detected ***: ./usr/gen_init_cpio terminated
    
    This also replaces the space-indenting with tabs.

    genalloc: stop crashing the system when destroying a pool
    
    commit eedce141cd2dad8d0cefc5468ef41898949a7031 upstream.
    
    The genalloc code uses the bitmap API from include/linux/bitmap.h and
    lib/bitmap.c, which is based on long values.  Both bitmap_set from
    lib/bitmap.c and bitmap_set_ll, which is the lockless version from
    genalloc.c, use BITMAP_LAST_WORD_MASK to set the first bits in a long in
    the bitmap.
    
    That one uses (1 << bits) - 1, 0b111, if you are setting the first three
    bits.  This means that the API counts from the least significant bits
    (LSB from now on) to the MSB.  The LSB in the first long is bit 0, then.
    The same works for the lookup functions.
    
    The genalloc code uses longs for the bitmap, as it should.  In
    include/linux/genalloc.h, struct gen_pool_chunk has unsigned long
    bits[0] as its last member.  When allocating the struct, genalloc should
    reserve enough space for the bitmap.  This should be a proper number of
    longs that can fit the amount of bits in the bitmap.
    
    However, genalloc allocates an integer number of bytes that fit the
    amount of bits, but may not be an integer amount of longs.  9 bytes, for
    example, could be allocated for 70 bits.
    
    This is a problem in itself if the Least Significat Bit in a long is in
    the byte with the largest address, which happens in Big Endian machines.
    This means genalloc is not allocating the byte in which it will try to
    set or check for a bit.
    
    This may end up in memory corruption, where genalloc will try to set the
    bits it has not allocated.  In fact, genalloc may not set these bits
    because it may find them already set, because they were not zeroed since
    they were not allocated.  And that's what causes a BUG when
    gen_pool_destroy is called and check for any set bits.
    
    What really happens is that genalloc uses kmalloc_node with __GFP_ZERO
    on gen_pool_add_virt.  With SLAB and SLUB, this means the whole slab
    will be cleared, not only the requested bytes.  Since struct
    gen_pool_chunk has a size that is a multiple of 8, and slab sizes are
    multiples of 8, we get lucky and allocate and clear the right amount of
    bytes.
    
    Hower, this is not the case with SLOB or with older code that did memset
    after allocating instead of using __GFP_ZERO.
    
    So, a simple module as this (running 3.6.0), will cause a crash when
    rmmod'ed.

    mm: fix XFS oops due to dirty pages without buffers on s390
    
    commit ef5d437f71afdf4afdbab99213add99f4b1318fd upstream.
    
    On s390 any write to a page (even from kernel itself) sets architecture
    specific page dirty bit.  Thus when a page is written to via buffered
    write, HW dirty bit gets set and when we later map and unmap the page,
    page_remove_rmap() finds the dirty bit and calls set_page_dirty().
    
    Dirtying of a page which shouldn't be dirty can cause all sorts of
    problems to filesystems.  The bug we observed in practice is that
    buffers from the page get freed, so when the page gets later marked as
    dirty and writeback writes it, XFS crashes due to an assertion
    BUG_ON(!PagePrivate(page)) in page_buffers() called from
    xfs_count_page_state().
    
    Similar problem can also happen when zero_user_segment() call from
    xfs_vm_writepage() (or block_write_full_page() for that matter) set the
    hardware dirty bit during writeback, later buffers get freed, and then
    page unmapped.
    
    Fix the issue by ignoring s390 HW dirty bit for page cache pages of
    mappings with mapping_cap_account_dirty().  This is safe because for
    such mappings when a page gets marked as writeable in PTE it is also
    marked dirty in do_wp_page() or do_page_fault().  When the dirty bit is
    cleared by clear_page_dirty_for_io(), the page gets writeprotected in
    page_mkclean().  So pagecache page is writeable if and only if it is
    dirty.
    
    Thanks to Hugh Dickins for pointing out mapping has to have
    mapping_cap_account_dirty() for things to work and proposing a cleaned
    up variant of the patch.
    
    The patch has survived about two hours of running fsx-linux on tmpfs
    while heavily swapping and several days of running on out build machines
    where the original problem was triggered.

    xhci: Fix potential NULL ptr deref in command cancellation.
    
    commit 43a09f7fb01fa1e091416a2aa49b6c666458c1ee upstream.
    
    The command cancellation code doesn't check whether find_trb_seg()
    couldn't find the segment that contains the TRB to be canceled.  This
    could cause a NULL pointer deference later in the function when next_trb
    is called.  It's unlikely to happen unless something is wrong with the
    command ring pointers, so add some debugging in case it happens.

    USB: mos7840: remove invalid disconnect handling
    
    commit e681b66f2e19fadbe8a7e2a17900978cb6bc921f upstream.
    
    Remove private zombie flag used to signal disconnect and to prevent
    control urb from being submitted from interrupt urb completion handler.
    
    The control urb will not be re-submitted as both the control urb and the
    interrupt urb is killed on disconnect.

    commit 5260e458f5eff269a43e4f1e9c47186c57b88ddb upstream.
    
    Make sure generic close is called at close.
    
    The driver relies on the generic write implementation but did not call
    generic close.
    
    Note that the call to kill the read urb is not redundant, as mct_u232
    uses an interrupt urb from the second port as the read urb and that
    generic close therefore fails to kill it.
    
    Compile-only tested.

    sysfs: sysfs_pathname/sysfs_add_one: Use strlcat() instead of strcat()
    
    commit 66081a72517a131430dcf986775f3268aafcb546 upstream.
    
    The warning check for duplicate sysfs entries can cause a buffer overflow
    when printing the warning, as strcat() doesn't check buffer sizes.
    Use strlcat() instead.
    
    Since strlcat() doesn't return a pointer to the passed buffer, unlike
    strcat(), I had to convert the nested concatenation in sysfs_add_one() to
    an admittedly more obscure comma operator construct, to avoid emitting code
    for the concatenation if CONFIG_BUG is disabled.

    SUNRPC: Get rid of the xs_error_report socket callback
    
    commit f878b657ce8e7d3673afe48110ec208a29e38c4a upstream.
    
    Chris Perl reports that we're seeing races between the wakeup call in
    xs_error_report and the connect attempts. Basically, Chris has shown
    that in certain circumstances, the call to xs_error_report causes the
    rpc_task that is responsible for reconnecting to wake up early, thus
    triggering a disconnect and retry.
    
    Since the sk->sk_error_report() calls in the socket layer are always
    followed by a tcp_done() in the cases where we care about waking up
    the rpc_tasks, just let the state_change callbacks take responsibility
    for those wake ups.

    SUNRPC: Prevent races in xs_abort_connection()
    
    commit 4bc1e68ed6a8b59be8a79eb719be515a55c7bc68 upstream.
    
    The call to xprt_disconnect_done() that is triggered by a successful
    connection reset will trigger another automatic wakeup of all tasks
    on the xprt->pending rpc_wait_queue. In particular it will cause an
    early wake up of the task that called xprt_connect().
    
    All we really want to do here is clear all the socket-specific state
    flags, so we split that functionality out of xs_sock_mark_closed()
    into a helper that can be called by xs_abort_connection()

    amd64_edac:__amd64_set_scrub_rate(): avoid overindexing scrubrates[]
    
    commit 168bfeef7bba3f9784f7540b053e4ac72b769ce9 upstream.
    
    If none of the elements in scrubrates[] matches, this loop will cause
    __amd64_set_scrub_rate() to incorrectly use the n+1th element.
    
    As the function is designed to use the final scrubrates[] element in the
    case of no match, we can fix this bug by simply terminating the array
    search at the n-1th element.

    arch/tile: avoid generating .eh_frame information in modules
    
    commit 627072b06c362bbe7dc256f618aaa63351f0cfe6 upstream.
    
    The tile tool chain uses the .eh_frame information for backtracing.
    The vmlinux build drops any .eh_frame sections at link time, but when
    present in kernel modules, it causes a module load failure due to the
    presence of unsupported pc-relative relocations.  When compiling to
    use compiler feedback support, the compiler by default omits .eh_frame
    information, so we don't see this problem.  But when not using feedback,
    we need to explicitly suppress the .eh_frame.

    usb hub: send clear_tt_buffer_complete events when canceling TT clear work
    
    commit 3b6054da68f9b0d5ed6a7ed0f42a79e61904352c upstream.
    
    There is a race condition in the USB hub code with regard to handling
    TT clear requests that can get the HCD driver in a deadlock. Usually
    when an TT clear request is scheduled it will be executed immediately:

    However, if a suspend operation is triggered before hub_tt_work is
    scheduled, hub_quiesce will cancel the work without notifying the HCD

    This patch changes hub_quiesce behavior to flush the TT clear work
    instead of canceling it, to make sure that no TT clear request remains
    uncompleted before suspend.

    ARM: 7559/1: smp: switch away from the idmap before updating init_mm.mm_count
    
    commit 5f40b909728ad784eb43aa309d3c4e9bdf050781 upstream.
    
    When booting a secondary CPU, the primary CPU hands two sets of page
    tables via the secondary_data struct:
    
            (1) swapper_pg_dir: a normal, cacheable, shared (if SMP) mapping
                of the kernel image (i.e. the tables used by init_mm).
    
            (2) idmap_pgd: an uncached mapping of the .idmap.text ELF
                section.
    
    The idmap is generally used when enabling and disabling the MMU, which
    includes early CPU boot. In this case, the secondary CPU switches to
    swapper as soon as it enters C code:
    
            struct mm_struct *mm = &init_mm;
            unsigned int cpu = smp_processor_id();
    
            /*
             * All kernel threads share the same mm context; grab a
             * reference and switch to it.
             */
            atomic_inc(&mm->mm_count);
            current->active_mm = mm;
            cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(mm));
            cpu_switch_mm(mm->pgd, mm);
    
    This causes a problem on ARMv7, where the identity mapping is treated as
    strongly-ordered leading to architecturally UNPREDICTABLE behaviour of
    exclusive accesses, such as those used by atomic_inc.
    
    This patch re-orders the secondary_start_kernel function so that we
    switch to swapper before performing any exclusive accesses.

    kernel/sys.c: fix stack memory content leak via UNAME26
    
    commit 2702b1526c7278c4d65d78de209a465d4de2885e upstream.
    
    Calling uname() with the UNAME26 personality set allows a leak of kernel
    stack contents.  This fixes it by defensively calculating the length of
    copy_to_user() call, making the len argument unsigned, and initializing
    the stack buffer to zero (now technically unneeded, but hey, overkill).

    I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T430 and an UltraBase Series 3 docking
    station.
    
    Without this patch, if I plug my headphones into the jack on the
    computer, everything works fine. The computer speakers mute and the
    audio is played in the headphones. However, if I plug into the docking
    station headphone jack the computer speakers are muted but there is no
    audio in the headphones.

    xen/x86: don't corrupt %eip when returning from a signal handler
    
    commit a349e23d1cf746f8bdc603dcc61fae9ee4a695f6 upstream.
    
    In 32 bit guests, if a userspace process has %eax == -ERESTARTSYS
    (-512) or -ERESTARTNOINTR (-513) when it is interrupted by an event
    /and/ the process has a pending signal then %eip (and %eax) are
    corrupted when returning to the main process after handling the
    signal.  The application may then crash with SIGSEGV or a SIGILL or it
    may have subtly incorrect behaviour (depending on what instruction it
    returned to).
    
    The occurs because handle_signal() is incorrectly thinking that there
    is a system call that needs to restarted so it adjusts %eip and %eax
    to re-execute the system call instruction (even though user space had
    not done a system call).
    
    If %eax == -514 (-ERESTARTNOHAND (-514) or -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK
    (-516) then handle_signal() only corrupted %eax (by setting it to
    -EINTR).  This may cause the application to crash or have incorrect
    behaviour.
    
    handle_signal() assumes that regs->orig_ax >= 0 means a system call so
    any kernel entry point that is not for a system call must push a
    negative value for orig_ax.  For example, for physical interrupts on
    bare metal the inverse of the vector is pushed and page_fault() sets
    regs->orig_ax to -1, overwriting the hardware provided error code.
    
    xen_hypervisor_callback() was incorrectly pushing 0 for orig_ax
    instead of -1.
    
    Classic Xen kernels pushed %eax which works as %eax cannot be both
    non-negative and -RESTARTSYS (etc.), but using -1 is consistent with
    other non-system call entry points and avoids some of the tests in
    handle_signal().
    
    There were similar bugs in xen_failsafe_callback() of both 32 and
    64-bit guests. If the fault was corrected and the normal return path
    was used then 0 was incorrectly pushed as the value for orig_ax.

    s390: fix linker script for 31 bit builds
    
    commit c985cb37f1b39c2c8035af741a2a0b79f1fbaca7 upstream.
    
    Because of a change in the s390 arch backend of binutils (commit 23ecd77
    "Pick the default arch depending on the target size" in binutils repo)
    31 bit builds will fail since the linker would now try to create 64 bit
    binary output.
    Fix this by setting OUTPUT_ARCH to s390:31-bit instead of s390.
    Thanks to Andreas Krebbel for figuring out the issue.
    
    Fixes this build error:
    
      LD      init/built-in.o
    s390x-4.7.2-ld: s390:31-bit architecture of input file

    cgroup: notify_on_release may not be triggered in some cases
    
    commit 1f5320d5972aa50d3e8d2b227b636b370e608359 upstream.
    
    notify_on_release must be triggered when the last process in a cgroup is
    move to another. But if the first(and only) process in a cgroup is moved to
    another, notify_on_release is not triggered.
    
            # mkdir /cgroup/cpu/SRC
            # mkdir /cgroup/cpu/DST
            #
            # echo 1 >/cgroup/cpu/SRC/notify_on_release
            # echo 1 >/cgroup/cpu/DST/notify_on_release
            #
            # sleep 300 &
            [1] 8629
            #
            # echo 8629 >/cgroup/cpu/SRC/tasks
            # echo 8629 >/cgroup/cpu/DST/tasks
            -> notify_on_release for /SRC must be triggered at this point,
               but it isn't.
    
    This is because put_css_set() is called before setting CGRP_RELEASABLE
    in cgroup_task_migrate(), and is a regression introduce by the
    commit:74a1166d(cgroups: make procs file writable), which was merged
    into v3.0.

    mac80211: check if key has TKIP type before updating IV

    This patch fix corruption which can manifest itself by following crash
    when switching on rfkill switch with rt2x00 driver:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=615362
    
    Pointer key->u.ccmp.tfm of group key get corrupted in:
    
    ieee80211_rx_h_michael_mic_verify():
    
            /* update IV in key information to be able to detect replays */
            rx->key->u.tkip.rx[rx->security_idx].iv32 = rx->tkip_iv32;
            rx->key->u.tkip.rx[rx->security_idx].iv16 = rx->tkip_iv16;
    
    because rt2x00 always set RX_FLAG_MMIC_STRIPPED, even if key is not TKIP.
    
    We already check type of the key in different path in
    ieee80211_rx_h_michael_mic_verify() function, so adding additional
    check here is reasonable.

    drm/radeon: Don't destroy I2C Bus Rec in radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy().
    
    commit 082918471139b07964967cfe5f70230909c82ae1 upstream.
    
    radeon_i2c_fini() walks thru the list of I2C bus recs rdev->i2c_bus[]
    to destroy each of them.
    radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy() however also has code to destroy it's
    associated I2C bus rec which has been obtained by radeon_i2c_lookup()
    and is therefore also in the i2c_bus[] list.
    This causes a double free resulting in a kernel panic when unloading
    the radeon driver.
    Removing destroy code from radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy() fixes this
    problem.

    pcmcia: sharpsl: don't discard sharpsl_pcmcia_ops
    
    commit fdc858a466b738d35d3492bc7cf77b1dac98bf7c upstream.
    
    The sharpsl_pcmcia_ops structure gets passed into
    sa11xx_drv_pcmcia_probe, where it gets accessed at run-time,
    unlike all other pcmcia drivers that pass their structures
    into platform_device_add_data, which makes a copy.
    
    This means the gcc warning is valid and the structure
    must not be marked as __initdata.
    
    Without this patch, building collie_defconfig results in:

    mips,kgdb: fix recursive page fault with CONFIG_KPROBES
    
    commit f0a996eeeda214f4293e234df33b29bec003b536 upstream.
    
    This fault was detected using the kgdb test suite on boot and it
    crashes recursively due to the fact that CONFIG_KPROBES on mips adds
    an extra die notifier in the page fault handler.  The crash signature
    looks like this:
    
    kgdbts:RUN bad memory access test
    KGDB: re-enter exception: ALL breakpoints killed
    Call Trace:
    [<807b7548>] dump_stack+0x20/0x54
    [<807b7548>] dump_stack+0x20/0x54
    
    The fix for now is to have kgdb return immediately if the fault type
    is DIE_PAGE_FAULT and allow the kprobe code to decide what is supposed

    Bluetooth: SMP: Fix setting unknown auth_req bits
    
    commit 065a13e2cc665f6547dc7e8a9d6b6565badf940a upstream.
    
    When sending a pairing request or response we should not just blindly
    copy the value that the remote device sent. Instead we should at least
    make sure to mask out any unknown bits. This is particularly critical
    from the upcoming LE Secure Connections feature perspective as
    incorrectly indicating support for it (by copying the remote value)
    would cause a failure to pair with devices that support it.

    pktgen: fix crash when generating IPv6 packets
    
    commit 5aa8b572007c4bca1e6d3dd4c4820f1ae49d6bb2 upstream.
    
    For IPv6, sizeof(struct ipv6hdr) = 40, thus the following
    expression will result negative:
    
            datalen = pkt_dev->cur_pkt_size - 14 -
                      sizeof(struct ipv6hdr) - sizeof(struct udphdr) -
                      pkt_dev->pkt_overhead;
    
    And,  the check "if (datalen < sizeof(struct pktgen_hdr))" will be
    passed as "datalen" is promoted to unsigned, therefore will cause
    a crash later.
    
    This is a quick fix by checking if "datalen" is negative. The following
    patch will increase the default value of 'min_pkt_size' for IPv6.
    
    This bug should exist for a long time, so Cc -stable too.

    nohz: Fix idle ticks in cpu summary line of /proc/stat
    
    commit 7386cdbf2f57ea8cff3c9fde93f206e58b9fe13f upstream.
    
    Git commit 09a1d34f8535ecf9 "nohz: Make idle/iowait counter update
    conditional" introduced a bug in regard to cpu hotplug. The effect is
    that the number of idle ticks in the cpu summary line in /proc/stat is
    still counting ticks for offline cpus.
    
    Reproduction is easy, just start a workload that keeps all cpus busy,
    switch off one or more cpus and then watch the idle field in top.
    On a dual-core with one cpu 100% busy and one offline cpu you will get
    something like this:
    
    %Cpu(s): 48.7 us,  1.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 50.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,
    %0.0 st
    
    The problem is that an offline cpu still has ts->idle_active == 1.
    To fix this we should make sure that the cpu is online when calling
    get_cpu_idle_time_us and get_cpu_iowait_time_us.

    extent in question is fully inside [map.m_lblk, map->m_len] because
    it was already split during submission.  But this may not be true due to
    a race between writeback vs fallocate.
    
    If extent in question is larger than requested we will split it again.

    [map.m_lblk, map->m_len] already contains valid data.

    tmpfs,ceph,gfs2,isofs,reiserfs,xfs: fix fh_len checking
    
    commit 35c2a7f4908d404c9124c2efc6ada4640ca4d5d5 upstream.
    
    Fuzzing with trinity oopsed on the 1st instruction of shmem_fh_to_dentry(),
            u64 inum = fid->raw[2];
    which is unhelpfully reported as at the end of shmem_alloc_inode():
    
    BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff880061cd3000
    IP: [<ffffffff812190d0>] shmem_alloc_inode+0x40/0x40

    Right, tmpfs is being stupid to access fid->raw[2] before validating that
    fh_len includes it: the buffer kmalloc'ed by do_sys_name_to_handle() may
    fall at the end of a page, and the next page not be present.
    
    But some other filesystems (ceph, gfs2, isofs, reiserfs, xfs) are being
    careless about fh_len too, in fh_to_dentry() and/or fh_to_parent(), and
    could oops in the same way: add the missing fh_len checks to those.

    timers: Fix endless looping between cascade() and internal_add_timer()
    
    commit 26cff4e2aa4d666dc6a120ea34336b5057e3e187 upstream.
    
    Adding two (or more) timers with large values for "expires" (they have
    to reside within tv5 in the same list) leads to endless looping
    between cascade() and internal_add_timer() in case CONFIG_BASE_SMALL
    is one and jiffies are crossing the value 1 << 18. The bug was
    introduced between 2.6.11 and 2.6.12 (and survived for quite some
    time).
    
    This patch ensures that when cascade() is called timers within tv5 are
    not added endlessly to their own list again, instead they are added to
    the next lower tv level tv4 (as expected).

    scsi_debug: Fix off-by-one bug when unmapping region
    
    commit bc977749e967daa56de1922cf4cb38525631c51c upstream.
    
    Currently it is possible to unmap one more block than user requested to
    due to the off-by-one error in unmap_region(). This is probably due to
    the fact that the end variable despite its name actually points to the
    last block to unmap + 1. However in the condition it is handled as the
    last block of the region to unmap.
    
    The bug was not previously spotted probably due to the fact that the
    region was not zeroed, which has changed with commit
    be1dd78de5686c062bb3103f9e86d444a10ed783. With that commit we were able
    to corrupt the ext4 file system on 256M scsi_debug device with LBPRZ
    enabled using fstrim.
    
    Since the 'end' semantic is the same in several functions there this
    commit just fixes the condition to use the 'end' variable correctly in
    that context.

    ARM: vfp: fix saving d16-d31 vfp registers on v6+ kernels
    
    commit 846a136881b8f73c1f74250bf6acfaa309cab1f2 upstream.
    
    Michael Olbrich reported that his test program fails when built with
    -O2 -mcpu=cortex-a8 -mfpu=neon, and a kernel which supports v6 and v7
    CPUs:
    
    volatile int x = 2;
    volatile int64_t y = 2;
    
    int main() {
            volatile int a = 0;
            volatile int64_t b = 0;
            while (1) {
                    a = (a + x) % (1 << 30);
                    b = (b + y) % (1 << 30);
                    assert(a == b);
            }
    }
    
    and two instances are run.  When built for just v7 CPUs, this program
    works fine.  It uses the "vadd.i64 d19, d18, d16" VFP instruction.
    
    It appears that we do not save the high-16 double VFP registers across
    context switches when the kernel is built for v6 CPUs.  Fix that.

    ACPI: EC: Make the GPE storm threshold a module parameter
    
    commit a520d52e99b14ba7db135e916348f12f2a6e09be upstream.
    
    The Linux EC driver includes a mechanism to detect GPE storms,
    and switch from interrupt-mode to polling mode.  However, polling
    mode sometimes doesn't work, so the workaround is problematic.
    Also, different systems seem to need the threshold for detecting
    the GPE storm at different levels.
    
    ACPI_EC_STORM_THRESHOLD was initially 20 when it's created, and
    was changed to 8 in 2.6.28 commit 06cf7d3c7 "ACPI: EC: lower interrupt storm
    threshold" to fix kernel bug 11892 by forcing the laptop in that bug to
    work in polling mode. However in bug 45151, it works fine in interrupt
    mode if we lift the threshold back to 20.
    
    This patch makes the threshold a module parameter so that user has a
    flexible option to debug/workaround this issue.
    
    The default is unchanged.
    
    This is also a preparation patch to fix specific systems:

    This is rather odd, as the documentation suggests that clocks have two
    states (on/off) and the default (stable) configuration is configured to
    enable the clock only when it is needed. However, explicitly enabling *or*
    disabling the clock triggers this system instability, suggesting that there
    is a 3rd state at play here.
    
    Leaving the clock enable/disable registers alone solves this problem.
    This fixes spurious reboots during suspend/resume behaviour introduced by
    commit b692a63a.

    Processes that open and close multiple files may end up setting this
    oo_last_closed_stid without freeing what was previously pointed to.
    This can result in a major leak, visible for example by watching the

    staging: comedi: amplc_pc236: fix invalid register access during detach
    
    commit aaeb61a97b7159ebe30b18a422d04eeabfa8790b upstream.
    
    `pc236_detach()` is called by the comedi core if it attempted to attach
    a device and failed.  `pc236_detach()` calls `pc236_intr_disable()` if
    the comedi device private data pointer (`devpriv`) is non-null.  This
    test is insufficient as `pc236_intr_disable()` accesses hardware
    registers and the attach routine may have failed before it has saved
    their I/O base addresses.
    
    Fix it by checking `dev->iobase` is non-zero before calling
    `pc236_intr_disable()` as that means the I/O base addresses have been
    saved and the hardware registers can be accessed.  It also implies the
    comedi device private data pointer is valid, so there is no need to
    check it.

    tcp: resets are misrouted
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c67525849e0b7f4bd4fab2487ec9e43ea52ef29 ]
    
    After commit e2446eaa ("tcp_v4_send_reset: binding oif to iif in no
    sock case").. tcp resets are always lost, when routing is asymmetric.
    Yes, backing out that patch will result in misrouting of resets for
    dead connections which used interface binding when were alive, but we
    actually cannot do anything here.  What's died that's died and correct
    handling normal unbound connections is obviously a priority.
    
    Comment to comment:
    > This has few benefits:
    >   1. tcp_v6_send_reset already did that.
    
    It was done to route resets for IPv6 link local addresses. It was a
    mistake to do so for global addresses. The patch fixes this as well.
    
    Actually, the problem appears to be even more serious than guaranteed
    loss of resets.  As reported by Sergey Soloviev <sol@eqv.ru>, those
    misrouted resets create a lot of arp traffic and huge amount of
    unresolved arp entires putting down to knees NAT firewalls which use
    asymmetric routing.

    RDS: fix rds-ping spinlock recursion
    
    [ Upstream commit 5175a5e76bbdf20a614fb47ce7a38f0f39e70226 ]
    
    This is the revised patch for fixing rds-ping spinlock recursion
    according to Venkat's suggestions.
    
    RDS ping/pong over TCP feature has been broken for years(2.6.39 to
    3.6.0) since we have to set TCP cork and call kernel_sendmsg() between
    ping/pong which both need to lock "struct sock *sk". However, this
    lock has already been hold before rds_tcp_data_ready() callback is
    triggerred. As a result, we always facing spinlock resursion which
    would resulting in system panic.
    
    Given that RDS ping is only used to test the connectivity and not for
    serious performance measurements, we can queue the pong transmit to
    rds_wq as a delayed response.

    vlan: don't deliver frames for unknown vlans to protocols
    
    [ Upstream commit 48cc32d38a52d0b68f91a171a8d00531edc6a46e ]
    
    6a32e4f9dd9219261f8856f817e6655114cfec2f made the vlan code skip marking
    vlan-tagged frames for not locally configured vlans as PACKET_OTHERHOST if
    there was an rx_handler, as the rx_handler could cause the frame to be received
    on a different (virtual) vlan-capable interface where that vlan might be
    configured.
    
    As rx_handlers do not necessarily return RX_HANDLER_ANOTHER, this could cause
    frames for unknown vlans to be delivered to the protocol stack as if they had
    been received untagged.
    
    For example, if an ipv6 router advertisement that's tagged for a locally not
    configured vlan is received on an interface with macvlan interfaces attached,
    macvlan's rx_handler returns RX_HANDLER_PASS after delivering the frame to the
    macvlan interfaces, which caused it to be passed to the protocol stack, leading
    to ipv6 addresses for the announced prefix being configured even though those
    are completely unusable on the underlying interface.
    
    The fix moves marking as PACKET_OTHERHOST after the rx_handler so the
    rx_handler, if there is one, sees the frame unchanged, but afterwards,
    before the frame is delivered to the protocol stack, it gets marked whether
    there is an rx_handler or not.

    Marvell 88E8001 on an ASUS P5NSLI motherboard is unable to send/receive
    packets on a system with >4gb ram unless a 32bit DMA mask is used.
    
    This issue has been around for years and a fix was sent 3.5 years ago, but
    there was some debate as to whether it should instead be fixed as a PCI quirk.

    However, 18 months later a similar workaround was introduced for another
    chipset exhibiting the same problem.

    [ Upstream commit a27032eee8cb6e16516f13c8a9752e9d5d4cc430 ]
    
    There are multiple errors in how sys_sparc64_personality() handles
    personality flags stored in top three bytes.
    
    - directly comparing current->personality against PER_LINUX32 doesn't work
      in cases when any of the personality flags stored in the top three bytes
      are used.
    - directly forcefully setting personality to PER_LINUX32 or PER_LINUX
      discards any flags stored in the top three bytes
    
    Fix the first one by properly using personality() macro to compare only
    PER_MASK bytes.
    Fix the second one by setting only the bits that should be set, instead of
    overwriting the whole value.

    sparc64: Fix bit twiddling in sparc_pmu_enable_event().
    
    [ Upstream commit e793d8c6740f8fe704fa216e95685f4d92c4c4b9 ]
    
    There was a serious disconnect in the logic happening in
    sparc_pmu_disable_event() vs. sparc_pmu_enable_event().
    
    Event disable is implemented by programming a NOP event into the PCR.
    
    However, event enable was not reversing this operation.  Instead, it
    was setting the User/Priv/Hypervisor trace enable bits.
    
    That's not sparc_pmu_enable_event()'s job, that's what
    sparc_pmu_enable() and sparc_pmu_disable() do .
    
    The intent of sparc_pmu_enable_event() is clear, since it first clear
    out the event type encoding field.  So fix this by OR'ing in the event
    encoding rather than the trace enable bits.

    mtd: nand: allow NAND_NO_SUBPAGE_WRITE to be set from driver
    
    commit bf7a01bf7987b63b121d572b240c132ec44129c4 upstream.
    
    The NAND_CHIPOPTIONS_MSK has limited utility and is causing real bugs. It
    silently masks off at least one flag that might be set by the driver
    (NAND_NO_SUBPAGE_WRITE). This breaks the GPMI NAND driver and possibly
    others.
    
    Really, as long as driver writers exercise a small amount of care with
    NAND_* options, this mask is not necessary at all; it was only here to
    prevent certain options from accidentally being set by the driver. But the
    original thought turns out to be a bad idea occasionally. Thus, kill it.
    
    Note, this patch fixes some major gpmi-nand breakage.

    jbd: Fix assertion failure in commit code due to lacking transaction credits
    
    commit 09e05d4805e6c524c1af74e524e5d0528bb3fef3 upstream.
    
    ext3 users of data=journal mode with blocksize < pagesize were occasionally
    hitting assertion failure in journal_commit_transaction() checking whether the
    transaction has at least as many credits reserved as buffers attached.  The
    core of the problem is that when a file gets truncated, buffers that still need
    checkpointing or that are attached to the committing transaction are left with
    buffer_mapped set. When this happens to buffers beyond i_size attached to a
    page stradding i_size, subsequent write extending the file will see these
    buffers and as they are mapped (but underlying blocks were freed) things go
    awry from here.
    
    The assertion failure just coincidentally (and in this case luckily as we would
    start corrupting filesystem) triggers due to journal_head not being properly
    cleaned up as well.
    
    Under some rare circumstances this bug could even hit data=ordered mode users.
    There the assertion won't trigger and we would end up corrupting the
    filesystem.
    
    We fix the problem by unmapping buffers if possible (in lots of cases we just
    need a buffer attached to a transaction as a place holder but it must not be
    written out anyway). And in one case, we just have to bite the bullet and wait
    for transaction commit to finish.

    These are the hunks that I dropped when backporting for 3.2.24,
    which are applicable now that we also have commit f34cd9ca

    commit f34cd9ca9320876e9c12764f052004628a03ba2d upstream.
    
    samsung-laptop is not at all related to ACPI, but since this interface
    is not documented at all, and the driver has to use it at load to
    understand how it works on the laptop, I think it's a good idea to
    disable it if a better solution is available.
