    ipc/msg: fix race around refcount
    
    [fixed differently in 6062a8dc0517bce23e3c2f7d2fea5e22411269a3 upstream.]
    
    In older kernels (before v3.10) ipc_rcu_hdr->refcount was non-atomic int.
    There was possuble double-free bug: do_msgsnd() calls ipc_rcu_putref() under
    msq->q_perm->lock and RCU, while freequeue() calls it while it holds only
    'rw_mutex', so there is no sinchronization between them. Two function
    decrements '2' non-atomically, they both can get '0' as result.
    
    do_msgsnd()                                     freequeue()
    
    msq = msg_lock_check(ns, msqid);
    ...
    ipc_rcu_getref(msq);
    msg_unlock(msq);
    schedule();
                                                    (caller locks spinlock)
                                                    expunge_all(msq, -EIDRM);
                                                    ss_wakeup(&msq->q_senders, 1);
                                                    msg_rmid(ns, msq);
                                                    msg_unlock(msq);
    ipc_lock_by_ptr(&msq->q_perm);
    ipc_rcu_putref(msq);                            ipc_rcu_putref(msq);
    < both may get get --(...)->refcount == 0 >
    
    This patch locks ipc_lock and RCU around ipc_rcu_putref in freequeue.
    ( RCU protects memory for spin_unlock() )
    
    Similar bugs might be in other users of ipc_rcu_putref().
    
    In the mainline this has been fixed in v3.10 indirectly in commmit
    6062a8dc0517bce23e3c2f7d2fea5e22411269a3
    ("ipc,sem: fine grained locking for semtimedop") by Rik van Riel.
    That commit optimized locking and converted refcount into atomic.
    
    I'm not sure that anybody should care about this bug: it's very-very unlikely
    and no longer exists in actual mainline. I've found this just by looking into
    the code, probably this never happens in real life.

    xhci: Fix resume issues on Renesas chips in Samsung laptops
    
    commit 1aa9578c1a9450fb21501c4f549f5b1edb557e6d upstream.
    
    Don Zickus <dzickus@redhat.com> writes:
    
    Some co-workers of mine bought Samsung laptops that had mostly usb3 ports.
    Those ports did not resume correctly (the driver would timeout communicating
    and fail).  This led to frustration as suspend/resume is a common use for
    laptops.
    
    Poking around, I applied the reset on resume quirk to this chipset and the
    resume started working.  Reloading the xhci_hcd module had been the temporary
    workaround.

    commit 26a865f4aa8e66a6d94958de7656f7f1b03c6c56 upstream.
    
    After free_loaded_vmcs executes, the "loaded_vmcs" structure
    is kfreed, and now vmx->loaded_vmcs points to a kfreed area.
    Subsequent free_loaded_vmcs then attempts to manipulate
    vmx->loaded_vmcs.
    
    Switch the order to avoid the problem.

    Then to load_vmcs12_host_state and kvm_mmu_reset_context.
    
    Check for this possibility, let fault exception be regenerated.

    Input: elantech - improve clickpad detection
    
    commit c15bdfd5b9831e4cab8cfc118243956e267dd30e upstream.
    
    The current assumption in the elantech driver that hw version 3 touchpads
    are never clickpads and hw version 4 touchpads are always clickpads is
    wrong.
    
    There are several bug reports for this, ie:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1030802
    http://superuser.com/questions/619582/right-elantech-touchpad-button-not-working-in-linux
    
    I've spend a couple of hours wading through various bugzillas, launchpads
    and forum posts to create a list of fw-versions and capabilities for
    different laptop models to find a good method to differentiate between
    clickpads and versions with separate hardware buttons.
    
    Which shows that a device being a clickpad is reliable indicated by bit 12
    being set in the fw_version. I've included the gathered list inside the
    driver, so that we've this info at hand if we need to revisit this later.

    i7300_edac: Fix device reference count
    
    commit 75135da0d68419ef8a925f4c1d5f63d8046e314d upstream.
    
    pci_get_device() decrements the reference count of "from" (last
    argument) so when we break off the loop successfully we have only one
    device reference - and we don't know which device we have. If we want
    a reference to each device, we must take them explicitly and let
    the pci_get_device() walk complete to avoid duplicate references.
    
    This is serious, as over-putting device references will cause
    the device to eventually disappear. Without this fix, the kernel
    crashes after a few insmod/rmmod cycles.
    
    Tested on an Intel S7000FC4UR system with a 7300 chipset.

    libceph: resend all writes after the osdmap loses the full flag
    
    commit 9a1ea2dbff11547a8e664f143c1ffefc586a577a upstream.
    
    With the current full handling, there is a race between osds and
    clients getting the first map marked full. If the osd wins, it will
    return -ENOSPC to any writes, but the client may already have writes
    in flight. This results in the client getting the error and
    propagating it up the stack. For rbd, the block layer turns this into
    EIO, which can cause corruption in filesystems above it.
    
    To avoid this race, osds are being changed to drop writes that came
    from clients with an osdmap older than the last osdmap marked full.
    In order for this to work, clients must resend all writes after they
    encounter a full -> not full transition in the osdmap. osds will wait
    for an updated map instead of processing a request from a client with
    a newer map, so resent writes will not be dropped by the osd unless
    there is another not full -> full transition.
    
    This approach requires both osds and clients to be fixed to avoid the
    race. Old clients talking to osds with this fix may hang instead of
    returning EIO and potentially corrupting an fs. New clients talking to
    old osds have the same behavior as before if they encounter this race.
