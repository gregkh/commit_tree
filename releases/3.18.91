    n_tty: fix EXTPROC vs ICANON interaction with TIOCINQ (aka FIONREAD)
    
    commit 966031f340185eddd05affcf72b740549f056348 upstream.
    
    We added support for EXTPROC back in 2010 in commit 26df6d13406d ("tty:
    Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE") and the intent was to allow it to
    override some (all?) ICANON behavior.  Quoting from that original commit
    message:
    
             There is a new bit in the termios local flag word, EXTPROC.
             When this bit is set, several aspects of the terminal driver
             are disabled.  Input line editing, character echo, and mapping
             of signals are all disabled.  This allows the telnetd to turn
             off these functions when in linemode, but still keep track of
             what state the user wants the terminal to be in.
    
    but the problem turns out that "several aspects of the terminal driver
    are disabled" is a bit ambiguous, and you can really confuse the n_tty
    layer by setting EXTPROC and then causing some of the ICANON invariants
    to no longer be maintained.
    
    This fixes at least one such case (TIOCINQ) becoming unhappy because of
    the confusion over whether ICANON really means ICANON when EXTPROC is set.
    
    This basically makes TIOCINQ match the case of read: if EXTPROC is set,
    we ignore ICANON.  Also, make sure to reset the ICANON state ie EXTPROC
    changes, not just if ICANON changes.

    to 9000 MTU on both 5717 and 5719 chips. In discussion with Broadcom,
    they've indicated that these chipsets have the same phy as the 57766
    chipset, so the same workarounds apply. This has been tested by IBM
    on both Power 8 and Power 9 systems as well as by Broadcom on x86
    hardware and has been confirmed to resolve the hang issue.

    tcp md5sig: Use skb's saddr when replying to an incoming segment
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 30791ac41927ebd3e75486f9504b6d2280463bf0 ]
    
    The MD5-key that belongs to a connection is identified by the peer's
    IP-address. When we are in tcp_v4(6)_reqsk_send_ack(), we are replying
    to an incoming segment from tcp_check_req() that failed the seq-number
    checks.
    
    Thus, to find the correct key, we need to use the skb's saddr and not
    the daddr.
    
    This bug seems to have been there since quite a while, but probably got
    unnoticed because the consequences are not catastrophic. We will call
    tcp_v4_reqsk_send_ack only to send a challenge-ACK back to the peer,
    thus the connection doesn't really fail.

    net: igmp: Use correct source address on IGMPv3 reports
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a46182b00290839fa3fa159d54fd3237bd8669f0 ]
    
    Closing a multicast socket after the final IPv4 address is deleted
    from an interface can generate a membership report that uses the
    source IP from a different interface.  The following test script, run
    from an isolated netns, reproduces the issue:
    
        #!/bin/bash
    
        ip link add dummy0 type dummy
        ip link add dummy1 type dummy
        ip link set dummy0 up
        ip link set dummy1 up
        ip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
        ip addr add 192.168.99.99/24 dev dummy1
    
        tcpdump -U -i dummy0 &
        socat EXEC:"sleep 2" \
            UDP4-DATAGRAM:239.101.1.68:8889,ip-add-membership=239.0.1.68:10.1.1.1 &
    
        sleep 1
        ip addr del 10.1.1.1/24 dev dummy0
        sleep 5
        kill %tcpdump
    
    RFC 3376 specifies that the report must be sent with a valid IP source
    address from the destination subnet, or from address 0.0.0.0.  Add an
    extra check to make sure this is the case.

    kbuild: add '-fno-stack-check' to kernel build options
    
    commit 3ce120b16cc548472f80cf8644f90eda958cf1b6 upstream.
    
    It appears that hardened gentoo enables "-fstack-check" by default for
    gcc.
    
    That doesn't work _at_all_ for the kernel, because the kernel stack
    doesn't act like a user stack at all: it's much smaller, and it doesn't
    auto-expand on use.  So the extra "probe one page below the stack" code
    generated by -fstack-check just breaks the kernel in horrible ways,
    causing infinite double faults etc.
    
    [ I have to say, that the particular code gcc generates looks very
      stupid even for user space where it works, but that's a separate
      issue.  ]

    commit 15f8c5f2415bfac73f33a14bcd83422bcbfb5298 upstream.
    
    Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
    device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent codec node was also prematurely freed,
    while the child node was leaked.

    ring-buffer: Mask out the info bits when returning buffer page length
    
    commit 45d8b80c2ac5d21cd1e2954431fb676bc2b1e099 upstream.
    
    Two info bits were added to the "commit" part of the ring buffer data page
    when returned to be consumed. This was to inform the user space readers that
    events have been missed, and that the count may be stored at the end of the
    page.
    
    What wasn't handled, was the splice code that actually called a function to
    return the length of the data in order to zero out the rest of the page
    before sending it up to user space. These data bits were returned with the
    length making the value negative, and that negative value was not checked.
    It was compared to PAGE_SIZE, and only used if the size was less than
    PAGE_SIZE. Luckily PAGE_SIZE is unsigned long which made the compare an
    unsigned compare, meaning the negative size value did not end up causing a
    large portion of memory to be randomly zeroed out.

    tracing: Fix crash when it fails to alloc ring buffer
    
    commit 24f2aaf952ee0b59f31c3a18b8b36c9e3d3c2cf5 upstream.
    
    Double free of the ring buffer happens when it fails to alloc new
    ring buffer instance for max_buffer if TRACER_MAX_TRACE is configured.
    The root cause is that the pointer is not set to NULL after the buffer
    is freed in allocate_trace_buffers(), and the freeing of the ring
    buffer is invoked again later if the pointer is not equal to Null,
    as:
    
    instance_mkdir()
        |-allocate_trace_buffers()
            |-allocate_trace_buffer(tr, &tr->trace_buffer...)
            |-allocate_trace_buffer(tr, &tr->max_buffer...)
    
              // allocate fail(-ENOMEM),first free
              // and the buffer pointer is not set to null
            |-ring_buffer_free(tr->trace_buffer.buffer)
    
           // out_free_tr
        |-free_trace_buffers()
            |-free_trace_buffer(&tr->trace_buffer);
    
                  //if trace_buffer is not null, free again
                |-ring_buffer_free(buf->buffer)
                    |-rb_free_cpu_buffer(buffer->buffers[cpu])
                        // ring_buffer_per_cpu is null, and
                        // crash in ring_buffer_per_cpu->pages

    PCI / PM: Force devices to D0 in pci_pm_thaw_noirq()
    
    commit 5839ee7389e893a31e4e3c9cf17b50d14103c902 upstream.
    
    It is incorrect to call pci_restore_state() for devices in low-power
    states (D1-D3), as that involves the restoration of MSI setup which
    requires MMIO to be operational and that is only the case in D0.
    
    However, pci_pm_thaw_noirq() may do that if the driver's "freeze"
    callbacks put the device into a low-power state, so fix it by making
    it force devices into D0 via pci_set_power_state() instead of trying
    to "update" their power state which is pointless.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix the missing ctl name suffix at parsing SU
    
    commit 5a15f289ee87eaf33f13f08a4909ec99d837ec5f upstream.
    
    The commit 89b89d121ffc ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add check return value for
    usb_string()") added the check of the return value from
    snd_usb_copy_string_desc(), which is correct per se, but it introduced
    a regression.  In the original code, either the "Clock Source",
    "Playback Source" or "Capture Source" suffix is added after the
    terminal string, while the commit changed it to add the suffix only
    when get_term_name() is failing.  It ended up with an incorrect ctl
    name like "PCM" instead of "PCM Capture Source".
    
    Also, even the original code has a similar bug: when the ctl name is
    generated from snd_usb_copy_string_desc() for the given iSelector, it
    also doesn't put the suffix.
    
    This patch addresses these issues: the suffix is added always when no
    static mapping is found.  Also the patch tries to put more comments
    and cleans up the if/else block for better readability in order to
    avoid the same pitfall again.

    ALSA: rawmidi: Avoid racy info ioctl via ctl device
    
    commit c1cfd9025cc394fd137a01159d74335c5ac978ce upstream.
    
    The rawmidi also allows to obtaining the information via ioctl of ctl
    API.  It means that user can issue an ioctl to the rawmidi device even
    when it's being removed as long as the control device is present.
    Although the code has some protection via the global register_mutex,
    its range is limited to the search of the corresponding rawmidi
    object, and the mutex is already unlocked at accessing the rawmidi
    object.  This may lead to a use-after-free.
    
    For avoiding it, this patch widens the application of register_mutex
    to the whole snd_rawmidi_info_select() function.  We have another
    mutex per rawmidi object, but this operation isn't very hot path, so
    it shouldn't matter from the performance POV.

    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent node was prematurely freed, while the
    child node was leaked.
    
    Note that the CONFIG_OF compile guard can be removed as
    of_get_child_by_name() provides a !CONFIG_OF implementation which always
    fails.

    crypto: mcryptd - protect the per-CPU queue with a lock
    
    commit 9abffc6f2efe46c3564c04312e52e07622d40e51 upstream.
    
    mcryptd_enqueue_request() grabs the per-CPU queue struct and protects
    access to it with disabled preemption. Then it schedules a worker on the
    same CPU. The worker in mcryptd_queue_worker() guards access to the same
    per-CPU variable with disabled preemption.
    
    If we take CPU-hotplug into account then it is possible that between
    queue_work_on() and the actual invocation of the worker the CPU goes
    down and the worker will be scheduled on _another_ CPU. And here the
    preempt_disable() protection does not work anymore. The easiest thing is
    to add a spin_lock() to guard access to the list.
    
    Another detail: mcryptd_queue_worker() is not processing more than
    MCRYPTD_BATCH invocation in a row. If there are still items left, then
    it will invoke queue_work() to proceed with more later. *I* would
    suggest to simply drop that check because it does not use a system
    workqueue and the workqueue is already marked as "CPU_INTENSIVE". And if
    preemption is required then the scheduler should do it.
    However if queue_work() is used then the work item is marked as CPU
    unbound. That means it will try to run on the local CPU but it may run
    on another CPU as well. Especially with CONFIG_DEBUG_WQ_FORCE_RR_CPU=y.
    Again, the preempt_disable() won't work here but lock which was
    introduced will help.
    In order to keep work-item on the local CPU (and avoid RR) I changed it
    to queue_work_on().

    ACPI: APEI / ERST: Fix missing error handling in erst_reader()
    
    commit bb82e0b4a7e96494f0c1004ce50cec3d7b5fb3d1 upstream.
    
    The commit f6f828513290 ("pstore: pass allocated memory region back to
    caller") changed the check of the return value from erst_read() in
    erst_reader() in the following way:
    
            if (len == -ENOENT)
                    goto skip;
    -       else if (len < 0) {
    -               rc = -1;
    +       else if (len < sizeof(*rcd)) {
    +               rc = -EIO;
                    goto out;
    
    This introduced another bug: since the comparison with sizeof() is
    cast to unsigned, a negative len value doesn't hit any longer.
    As a result, when an error is returned from erst_read(), the code
    falls through, and it may eventually lead to some weird thing like
    memory corruption.
    
    This patch adds the negative error value check more explicitly for
    addressing the issue.
