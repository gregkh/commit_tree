    Don't trigger congestion wait on dirty-but-not-writeout pages
    
    commit b738d764652dc5aab1c8939f637112981fce9e0e upstream.
    
    shrink_inactive_list() used to wait 0.1s to avoid congestion when all
    the pages that were isolated from the inactive list were dirty but not
    under active writeback.  That makes no real sense, and apparently causes
    major interactivity issues under some loads since 3.11.
    
    The ostensible reason for it was to wait for kswapd to start writing
    pages, but that seems questionable as well, since the congestion wait
    code seems to trigger for kswapd itself as well.  Also, the logic behind
    delaying anything when we haven't actually started writeback is not
    clear - it only delays actually starting that writeback.
    
    We'll still trigger the congestion waiting if
    
     (a) the process is kswapd, and we hit pages flagged for immediate
         reclaim
    
     (b) the process is not kswapd, and the zone backing dev writeback is
         actually congested.
    
    This probably needs to be revisited, but as it is this fixes a reported
    regression.

    commit 11d3d334af07408ce3a68860c40006ddcd343da5 upstream.
    
    The driver calls irq_alloc_domain_generic_chips() which creates a gc and
    adds it to gc_list. The driver later then calls irq_setup_generic_chip()
    which also initializes the gc and adds it to the gc_list() and this
    corrupts the list. Enable LIST_DEBUG and you see the kernel complain.
    This isn't required, irq_alloc_domain_generic_chips() did the init.

    aio: protect reqs_available updates from changes in interrupt handlers
    
    commit 263782c1c95bbddbb022dc092fd89a36bb8d5577 upstream.
    
    As of commit f8567a3845ac05bb28f3c1b478ef752762bd39ef it is now possible to
    have put_reqs_available() called from irq context.  While put_reqs_available()
    is per cpu, it did not protect itself from interrupts on the same CPU.  This
    lead to aio_complete() corrupting the available io requests count when run
    under a heavy O_DIRECT workloads as reported by Robert Elliott.  Fix this by
    disabling irq updates around the per cpu batch updates of reqs_available.
    
    Many thanks to Robert and folks for testing and tracking this down.

    commit c7fb93ec51d462ec3540a729ba446663c26a0505 upstream.
    
    The PE/COFF headers currently describe only the initialised-data
    portions of the image, and result in no space being allocated for the
    uninitialised-data portions.  Consequently, the EFI boot stub will end
    up overwriting unexpected areas of memory, with unpredictable results.

    sched: Fix possible divide by zero in avg_atom() calculation
    
    commit b0ab99e7736af88b8ac1b7ae50ea287fffa2badc upstream.
    
    proc_sched_show_task() does:
    
      if (nr_switches)
            do_div(avg_atom, nr_switches);
    
    nr_switches is unsigned long and do_div truncates it to 32 bits, which
    means it can test non-zero on e.g. x86-64 and be truncated to zero for
    division.
    
    Fix the problem by using div64_ul() instead.
    
    As a side effect calculations of avg_atom for big nr_switches are now correct.

    PM / sleep: Fix request_firmware() error at resume
    
    commit 4320f6b1d9db4ca912c5eb6ecb328b2e090e1586 upstream.
    
    The commit [247bc037: PM / Sleep: Mitigate race between the freezer
    and request_firmware()] introduced the finer state control, but it
    also leads to a new bug; for example, a bug report regarding the
    firmware loading of intel BT device at suspend/resume:
      https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=873790
    
    The root cause seems to be a small window between the process resume
    and the clear of usermodehelper lock.  The request_firmware() function
    checks the UMH lock and gives up when it's in UMH_DISABLE state.  This
    is for avoiding the invalid  f/w loading during suspend/resume phase.
    The problem is, however, that usermodehelper_enable() is called at the
    end of thaw_processes().  Thus, a thawed process in between can kick
    off the f/w loader code path (in this case, via btusb_setup_intel())
    even before the call of usermodehelper_enable().  Then
    usermodehelper_read_trylock() returns an error and request_firmware()
    spews WARN_ON() in the end.
    
    This oneliner patch fixes the issue just by setting to UMH_FREEZING
    state again before restarting tasks, so that the call of
    request_firmware() will be blocked until the end of this function
    instead of returning an error.

    The status page is mapped to user processes and allows sharing the
    device state between the kernel and user processes.  This state isn't
    getting initialized and thus intermittently causes problems.  Namely,
    the user process can mistakenly think the user doorbell writes are
    disabled which causes SQ work requests to never get fetched by HW.

    cpufreq: move policy kobj to policy->cpu at resume
    
    commit 92c14bd9477a20a83144f08c0ca25b0308bf0730 upstream.
    
    This is only relevant to implementations with multiple clusters, where clusters
    have separate clock lines but all CPUs within a cluster share it.
    
    Consider a dual cluster platform with 2 cores per cluster. During suspend we
    start hot unplugging CPUs in order 1 to 3. When CPU2 is removed, policy->kobj
    would be moved to CPU3 and when CPU3 goes down we wouldn't free policy or its
    kobj as we want to retain permissions/values/etc.
    
    Now on resume, we will get CPU2 before CPU3 and will call __cpufreq_add_dev().
    We will recover the old policy and update policy->cpu from 3 to 2 from
    update_policy_cpu().
    
    But the kobj is still tied to CPU3 and isn't moved to CPU2. We wouldn't create a
    link for CPU2, but would try that for CPU3 while bringing it online. Which will
    report errors as CPU3 already has kobj assigned to it.
    
    This bug got introduced with commit 42f921a, which overlooked this scenario.
    
    To fix this, lets move kobj to the new policy->cpu while bringing first CPU of a
    cluster back. Also do a WARN_ON() if kobject_move failed, as we would reach here
    only for the first CPU of a non-boot cluster. And we can't recover from this
    situation, if kobject_move() fails.
    
    Fixes: 42f921a6f10c (cpufreq: remove sysfs files for CPUs which failed to come back after resume)

    x86, tsc: Fix cpufreq lockup
    
    commit 3896c329df8092661dac80f55a8c3f60136fd61a upstream.
    
    Mauro reported that his AMD X2 using the powernow-k8 cpufreq driver
    locked up when doing cpu hotplug.
    
    Because we called set_cyc2ns_scale() from the time_cpufreq_notifier()
    unconditionally, it gets called multiple times for each freq change,
    instead of only the once, when the tsc_khz value actually changes.
    
    Because it gets called more than once, we run out of cyc2ns data slots
    and stall, waiting for a free one, but because we're half way offline,
    there's no consumers to free slots.
    
    By placing the call inside the condition that actually changes tsc_khz
    we avoid superfluous calls and avoid the problem.

    hwrng: fetch randomness only after device init
    
    commit d3cc7996473a7bdd33256029988ea690754e4e2a upstream.
    
    Commit d9e7972619334 "hwrng: add randomness to system from rng sources"
    added a call to rng_get_data() from the hwrng_register() function.
    However, some rng devices need initialization before data can be read
    from them.
    
    This commit makes the call to rng_get_data() depend on no init fn
    pointer being registered by the device.  If an init function is
    registered, this call is made after device init.

    alarmtimer: Fix bug where relative alarm timers were treated as absolute
    
    commit 16927776ae757d0d132bdbfabbfe2c498342bd59 upstream.
    
    Sharvil noticed with the posix timer_settime interface, using the
    CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM or CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM clockid, if the users
    tried to specify a relative time timer, it would incorrectly be
    treated as absolute regardless of the state of the flags argument.
    
    This patch corrects this, properly checking the absolute/relative flag,
    as well as adds further error checking that no invalid flag bits are set.

    irqchip: gic: Fix core ID calculation when topology is read from DT
    
    commit 29e697b11853d3f83b1864ae385abdad4aa2c361 upstream.
    
    Certain GIC implementation, namely those found on earlier, single
    cluster, Exynos SoCs, have registers mapped without per-CPU banking,
    which means that the driver needs to use different offset for each CPU.
    
    Currently the driver calculates the offset by multiplying value returned
    by cpu_logical_map() by CPU offset parsed from DT. This is correct when
    CPU topology is not specified in DT and aforementioned function returns
    core ID alone. However when DT contains CPU topology, the function
    changes to return cluster ID as well, which is non-zero on mentioned
    SoCs and so breaks the calculation in GIC driver.
    
    This patch fixes this by masking out cluster ID in CPU offset
    calculation so that only core ID is considered. Multi-cluster Exynos
    SoCs already have banked GIC implementations, so this simple fix should
    be enough.

    ring-buffer: Fix polling on trace_pipe
    
    commit 97b8ee845393701edc06e27ccec2876ff9596019 upstream.
    
    ring_buffer_poll_wait() should always put the poll_table to its wait_queue
    even there is immediate data available.  Otherwise, the following epoll and
    read sequence will eventually hang forever:
    
    1. Put some data to make the trace_pipe ring_buffer read ready first
    2. epoll_ctl(efd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, trace_pipe_fd, ee)
    3. epoll_wait()
    4. read(trace_pipe_fd) till EAGAIN
    5. Add some more data to the trace_pipe ring_buffer
    6. epoll_wait() -> this epoll_wait() will block forever
    
    ~ During the epoll_ctl(efd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD,...) call in step 2,
      ring_buffer_poll_wait() returns immediately without adding poll_table,
      which has poll_table->_qproc pointing to ep_poll_callback(), to its
      wait_queue.
    ~ During the epoll_wait() call in step 3 and step 6,
      ring_buffer_poll_wait() cannot add ep_poll_callback() to its wait_queue
      because the poll_table->_qproc is NULL and it is how epoll works.
    ~ When there is new data available in step 6, ring_buffer does not know
      it has to call ep_poll_callback() because it is not in its wait queue.
      Hence, block forever.
    
    Other poll implementation seems to call poll_wait() unconditionally as the very
    first thing to do.  For example, tcp_poll() in tcp.c.

    mwifiex: fix Tx timeout issue
    
    commit d76744a93246eccdca1106037e8ee29debf48277 upstream.
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70191
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77581
    
    It is observed that sometimes Tx packet is downloaded without
    adding driver's txpd header. This results in firmware parsing
    garbage data as packet length. Sometimes firmware is unable
    to read the packet if length comes out as invalid. This stops
    further traffic and timeout occurs.
    
    The root cause is uninitialized fields in tx_info(skb->cb) of
    packet used to get garbage values. In this case if
    MWIFIEX_BUF_FLAG_REQUEUED_PKT flag is mistakenly set, txpd
    header was skipped. This patch makes sure that tx_info is
    correctly initialized to fix the problem.

    perf/x86/intel: ignore CondChgd bit to avoid false NMI handling
    
    commit b292d7a10487aee6e74b1c18b8d95b92f40d4a4f upstream.
    
    Currently, any NMI is falsely handled by a NMI handler of NMI watchdog
    if CondChgd bit in MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS MSR is set.
    
    For example, we use external NMI to make system panic to get crash
    dump, but in this case, the external NMI is falsely handled do to the
    issue.
    
    This commit deals with the issue simply by ignoring CondChgd bit.
    
    Here is explanation in detail.
    
    On x86 NMI watchdog uses performance monitoring feature to
    periodically signal NMI each time performance counter gets overflowed.
    
    intel_pmu_handle_irq() is called as a NMI_LOCAL handler from a NMI
    handler of NMI watchdog, perf_event_nmi_handler(). It identifies an
    owner of a given NMI by looking at overflow status bits in
    MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS MSR. If some of the bits are set, then it
    handles the given NMI as its own NMI.
    
    The problem is that the intel_pmu_handle_irq() doesn't distinguish
    CondChgd bit from other bits. Unlike the other status bits, CondChgd
    bit doesn't represent overflow status for performance counters. Thus,
    CondChgd bit cannot be thought of as a mark indicating a given NMI is
    NMI watchdog's.
    
    As a result, if CondChgd bit is set, any NMI is falsely handled by the
    NMI handler of NMI watchdog. Also, if type of the falsely handled NMI
    is either NMI_UNKNOWN, NMI_SERR or NMI_IO_CHECK, the corresponding
    action is never performed until CondChgd bit is cleared.
    
    I noticed this behavior on systems with Ivy Bridge processors: Intel
    Xeon CPU E5-2630 v2 and Intel Xeon CPU E7-8890 v2. On both systems,
    CondChgd bit in MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS MSR has already been set
    in the beginning at boot. Then the CondChgd bit is immediately cleared
    by next wrmsr to MSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL MSR and appears to remain
    0.
    
    On the other hand, on older processors such as Nehalem, Xeon E7540,
    CondChgd bit is not set in the beginning at boot.
    
    I'm not sure about exact behavior of CondChgd bit, in particular when
    this bit is set. Although I read Intel System Programmer's Manual to
    figure out that, the descriptions I found are:
    
      In 18.9.1:
    
      "The MSR_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS MSR also provides a ¡sticky bit¢ to
       indicate changes to the state of performancmonitoring hardware"
    
      In Table 35-2 IA-32 Architectural MSRs
    
      63 CondChg: status bits of this register has changed.
    
    These are different from the bahviour I see on the actual system as I
    explained above.
    
    At least, I think ignoring CondChgd bit should be enough for NMI
    watchdog perspective.

    perf: Do not allow optimized switch for non-cloned events
    
    commit 1f9a7268c67f0290837aada443d28fd953ddca90 upstream.
    
    The context check in perf_event_context_sched_out allows
    non-cloned context to be part of the optimized schedule
    out switch.
    
    This could move non-cloned context into another workload
    child. Once this child exits, the context is closed and
    leaves all original (parent) events in closed state.
    
    Any other new cloned event will have closed state and not
    measure anything. And probably causing other odd bugs.

    xen-netback: Fix releasing header slot on error path
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b860da0404a76af8533099ffe0a965490939369 ]
    
    This patch makes this function aware that the first frag and the header might
    share the same ring slot. That could happen if the first slot is bigger than
    PKT_PROT_LEN. Due to this the error path might release that slot twice or never,
    depending on the error scenario.
    xenvif_idx_release is also removed from xenvif_idx_unmap, and called separately.

    xen-netback: Fix releasing frag_list skbs in error path
    
    [ Upstream commit b42cc6e421e7bf74e545483aa34b99d2a2ca6d3a ]
    
    When the grant operations failed, the skb is freed up eventually, and it tries
    to release the frags, if there is any. For the main skb nr_frags is set to 0 to
    avoid this, but on the frag_list it iterates through the frags array, and tries
    to call put_page on the page pointer which contains garbage at that time.

    ipv4: fix buffer overflow in ip_options_compile()
    
    [ Upstream commit 10ec9472f05b45c94db3c854d22581a20b97db41 ]
    
    There is a benign buffer overflow in ip_options_compile spotted by
    AddressSanitizer[1] :
    
    Its benign because we always can access one extra byte in skb->head
    (because header is followed by struct skb_shared_info), and in this case
    this byte is not even used.

    net: ppp: don't call sk_chk_filter twice
    
    [ Upstream commit 3916a3192793fd3c11f69d623ef0cdbdbf9ea10a ]
    
    Commit 568f194e8bd16c353ad50f9ab95d98b20578a39d ("net: ppp: use
    sk_unattached_filter api") causes sk_chk_filter() to be called twice when
    setting a PPP pass or active filter. This applies to both the generic PPP
    subsystem implemented by drivers/net/ppp/ppp_generic.c and the ISDN PPP
    subsystem implemented by drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_ppp.c. The first call is from
    within get_filter(). The second one is through the call chain
    
      ppp_ioctl() or isdn_ppp_ioctl()
      --> sk_unattached_filter_create()
          --> __sk_prepare_filter()
              --> sk_chk_filter()
    
    The first call from within get_filter() should be deleted as get_filter() is
    called just before calling sk_unattached_filter_create() later on, which
    eventually calls sk_chk_filter() anyway.
    
    For 3.15.x, this proposed change is a bugfix rather than a pure optimization as
    in that branch, sk_chk_filter() may replace filter codes by other codes which
    are not recognized when executing sk_chk_filter() a second time. So with
    3.15.x, if sk_chk_filter() is called twice, the second invocation may yield
    EINVAL (this depends on the filter codes found in the filter to be set, but
    because the replacement is done for frequently used codes, this is almost
    always the case). The net effect is that setting pass and/or active PPP filters
    does not work anymore, since sk_unattached_filter_create() always returns
    EINVAL due to the second call to sk_chk_filter(), regardless whether the filter
    was originally sane or not.

    net: ppp: fix creating PPP pass and active filters
    
    [ Upstream commit cc25eaae238ddd693aa5eaa73e565d8ff4915f6e ]
    
    Commit 568f194e8bd16c353ad50f9ab95d98b20578a39d ("net: ppp: use
    sk_unattached_filter api") inadvertently changed the logic when setting
    PPP pass and active filters. This applies to both the generic PPP subsystem
    implemented by drivers/net/ppp/ppp_generic.c and the ISDN PPP subsystem
    implemented by drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_ppp.c. The original code in ppp_ioctl()
    (or isdn_ppp_ioctl(), resp.) handling PPPIOCSPASS and PPPIOCSACTIVE allowed to
    remove a pass/active filter previously set by using a filter of length zero.
    However, with the new code this is not possible anymore as this case is not
    explicitly checked for, which leads to passing NULL as a filter to
    sk_unattached_filter_create(). This results in returning EINVAL to the caller.
    
    Additionally, the variables ppp->pass_filter and ppp->active_filter (or
    is->pass_filter and is->active_filter, resp.) are not reset to NULL, although
    the filters they point to may have been destroyed by
    sk_unattached_filter_destroy(), so in this EINVAL case dangling pointers are
    left behind (provided the pointers were previously non-NULL).
    
    This patch corrects both problems by checking whether the filter passed is
    empty or non-empty, and prevents sk_unattached_filter_create() from being
    called in the first case. Moreover, the pointers are always reset to NULL
    as soon as sk_unattached_filter_destroy() returns.

    The PPP channel MTU is used with Multilink PPP when ppp_mp_explode() (see
    ppp_generic module) tries to determine how big a fragment might be. According
    to RFC 1661, the MTU excludes the 2-byte PPP protocol field, see the
    corresponding comment and code in ppp_mp_explode():
    
                    /*
                     * hdrlen includes the 2-byte PPP protocol field, but the
                     * MTU counts only the payload excluding the protocol field.
                     * (RFC1661 Section 2)
                     */
                    mtu = pch->chan->mtu - (hdrlen - 2);
    
    However, the pppoe module *does* include the PPP protocol field in the channel
    MTU, which is wrong as it causes the PPP payload to be 1-2 bytes too big under
    certain circumstances (one byte if PPP protocol compression is used, two
    otherwise), causing the generated Ethernet packets to be dropped. So the pppoe
    module has to subtract two bytes from the channel MTU. This error only
    manifests itself when using Multilink PPP, as otherwise the channel MTU is not
    used anywhere.
    
    In the following, I will describe how to reproduce this bug. We configure two
    pppd instances for multilink PPP over two PPPoE links, say eth2 and eth3, with
    a MTU of 1492 bytes for each link and a MRRU of 2976 bytes. (This MRRU is
    computed by adding the two link MTUs and subtracting the MP header twice, which
    is 4 bytes long.) The necessary pppd statements on both sides are "multilink
    mtu 1492 mru 1492 mrru 2976". On the client side, we additionally need "plugin
    rp-pppoe.so eth2" and "plugin rp-pppoe.so eth3", respectively; on the server
    side, we additionally need to start two pppoe-server instances to be able to
    establish two PPPoE sessions, one over eth2 and one over eth3. We set the MTU
    of the PPP network interface to the MRRU (2976) on both sides of the connection
    in order to make use of the higher bandwidth. (If we didn't do that, IP
    fragmentation would kick in, which we want to avoid.)
    
    Now we send a ICMPv4 echo request with a payload of 2948 bytes from client to
    server over the PPP link. This results in the following network packet:
    
       2948 (echo payload)
     +    8 (ICMPv4 header)
     +   20 (IPv4 header)
    ---------------------
       2976 (PPP payload)
    
    These 2976 bytes do not exceed the MTU of the PPP network interface, so the
    IP packet is not fragmented. Now the multilink PPP code in ppp_mp_explode()
    prepends one protocol byte (0x21 for IPv4), making the packet one byte bigger
    than the negotiated MRRU. So this packet would have to be divided in three
    fragments. But this does not happen as each link MTU is assumed to be two bytes
    larger. So this packet is diveded into two fragments only, one of size 1489 and
    one of size 1488. Now we have for that bigger fragment:
    
       1489 (PPP payload)
     +    4 (MP header)
     +    2 (PPP protocol field for the MP payload (0x3d))
     +    6 (PPPoE header)
    --------------------------
       1501 (Ethernet payload)
    
    This packet exceeds the link MTU and is discarded.
    
    If one configures the link MTU on the client side to 1501, one can see the
    discarded Ethernet frames with tcpdump running on the client. A
    
    ping -s 2948 -c 1 192.168.15.254
    
    leads to the smaller fragment that is correctly received on the server side:
    
    (tcpdump -vvvne -i eth3 pppoes and ppp proto 0x3d)
    52:54:00:ad:87:fd > 52:54:00:79:5c:d0, ethertype PPPoE S (0x8864),
      length 1514: PPPoE  [ses 0x3] MLPPP (0x003d), length 1494: seq 0x000,
      Flags [end], length 1492
    
    and to the bigger fragment that is not received on the server side:
    
    (tcpdump -vvvne -i eth2 pppoes and ppp proto 0x3d)
    52:54:00:70:9e:89 > 52:54:00:5d:6f:b0, ethertype PPPoE S (0x8864),
      length 1515: PPPoE  [ses 0x5] MLPPP (0x003d), length 1495: seq 0x000,
      Flags [begin], length 1493
    
    With the patch below, we correctly obtain three fragments:
    
    52:54:00:ad:87:fd > 52:54:00:79:5c:d0, ethertype PPPoE S (0x8864),
      length 1514: PPPoE  [ses 0x1] MLPPP (0x003d), length 1494: seq 0x000,
      Flags [begin], length 1492
    52:54:00:70:9e:89 > 52:54:00:5d:6f:b0, ethertype PPPoE S (0x8864),
      length 1514: PPPoE  [ses 0x1] MLPPP (0x003d), length 1494: seq 0x000,
      Flags [none], length 1492
    52:54:00:ad:87:fd > 52:54:00:79:5c:d0, ethertype PPPoE S (0x8864),
      length 27: PPPoE  [ses 0x1] MLPPP (0x003d), length 7: seq 0x000,
      Flags [end], length 5
    
    And the ICMPv4 echo request is successfully received at the server side:
    
    IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 21925, offset 0, flags [DF], proto ICMP (1),
      length 2976)
        192.168.222.2 > 192.168.15.254: ICMP echo request, id 30530, seq 0,
          length 2956
    
    The bug was introduced in commit c9aa6895371b2a257401f59d3393c9f7ac5a8698
    ("[PPPOE]: Advertise PPPoE MTU") from the very beginning. This patch applies
    to 3.10 upwards but the fix can be applied (with minor modifications) to
    kernels as old as 2.6.32.

    net: sctp: fix information leaks in ulpevent layer
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f2e5ae40ec193bc0a0ed99e95315c3eebca84ea ]
    
    While working on some other SCTP code, I noticed that some
    structures shared with user space are leaking uninitialized
    stack or heap buffer. In particular, struct sctp_sndrcvinfo
    has a 2 bytes hole between .sinfo_flags and .sinfo_ppid that
    remains unfilled by us in sctp_ulpevent_read_sndrcvinfo() when
    putting this into cmsg. But also struct sctp_remote_error
    contains a 2 bytes hole that we don't fill but place into a skb
    through skb_copy_expand() via sctp_ulpevent_make_remote_error().
    
    Both structures are defined by the IETF in RFC6458:
    
    * Section 5.3.2. SCTP Header Information Structure:
    
      The sctp_sndrcvinfo structure is defined below:
    
      struct sctp_sndrcvinfo {
        uint16_t sinfo_stream;
        uint16_t sinfo_ssn;
        uint16_t sinfo_flags;
        <-- 2 bytes hole  -->
        uint32_t sinfo_ppid;
        uint32_t sinfo_context;
        uint32_t sinfo_timetolive;
        uint32_t sinfo_tsn;
        uint32_t sinfo_cumtsn;
        sctp_assoc_t sinfo_assoc_id;
      };
    
    * 6.1.3. SCTP_REMOTE_ERROR:
    
      A remote peer may send an Operation Error message to its peer.
      This message indicates a variety of error conditions on an
      association. The entire ERROR chunk as it appears on the wire
      is included in an SCTP_REMOTE_ERROR event. Please refer to the
      SCTP specification [RFC4960] and any extensions for a list of
      possible error formats. An SCTP error notification has the
      following format:
    
      struct sctp_remote_error {
        uint16_t sre_type;
        uint16_t sre_flags;
        uint32_t sre_length;
        uint16_t sre_error;
        <-- 2 bytes hole  -->
        sctp_assoc_t sre_assoc_id;
        uint8_t  sre_data[];
      };
    
    Fix this by setting both to 0 before filling them out. We also
    have other structures shared between user and kernel space in
    SCTP that contains holes (e.g. struct sctp_paddrthlds), but we
    copy that buffer over from user space first and thus don't need
    to care about it in that cases.
    
    While at it, we can also remove lengthy comments copied from
    the draft, instead, we update the comment with the correct RFC
    number where one can look it up.

    tipc: clear 'next'-pointer of message fragments before reassembly
    
    [ Upstream commit 999417549c16dd0e3a382aa9f6ae61688db03181 ]
    
    If the 'next' pointer of the last fragment buffer in a message is not
    zeroed before reassembly, we risk ending up with a corrupt message,
    since the reassembly function itself isn't doing this.
    
    Currently, when a buffer is retrieved from the deferred queue of the
    broadcast link, the next pointer is not cleared, with the result as
    described above.
    
    This commit corrects this, and thereby fixes a bug that may occur when
    long broadcast messages are transmitted across dual interfaces. The bug
    has been present since 40ba3cdf542a469aaa9083fa041656e59b109b90 ("tipc:
    message reassembly using fragment chain")
    
    This commit should be applied to both net and net-next.

    netlink: Fix handling of error from netlink_dump().
    
    [ Upstream commit ac30ef832e6af0505b6f0251a6659adcfa74975e ]
    
    netlink_dump() returns a negative errno value on error.  Until now,
    netlink_recvmsg() directly recorded that negative value in sk->sk_err, but
    that's wrong since sk_err takes positive errno values.  (This manifests as
    userspace receiving a positive return value from the recv() system call,
    falsely indicating success.) This bug was introduced in the commit that
    started checking the netlink_dump() return value, commit b44d211 (netlink:
    handle errors from netlink_dump()).
    
    Multithreaded Netlink dumps are one way to trigger this behavior in
    practice, as described in the commit message for the userspace workaround
    posted here:
        http://openvswitch.org/pipermail/dev/2014-June/042339.html

    [ Upstream commit 4d12bc63ab5e48c1d78fa13883cf6fefcea3afb1 ]
    
    As reported by Maggie Mae Roxas, the mvneta driver doesn't behave
    properly in 10 Mbit/s mode. This is due to a misconfiguration of the
    MVNETA_GMAC_AUTONEG_CONFIG register: bit MVNETA_GMAC_CONFIG_MII_SPEED
    must be set for a 100 Mbit/s speed, but cleared for a 10 Mbit/s speed,
    which the driver was not properly doing. This commit adjusts that by
    setting the MVNETA_GMAC_CONFIG_MII_SPEED bit only in 100 Mbit/s mode,
    and relying on the fact that all the speed related bits of this
    register are cleared at the beginning of the mvneta_adjust_link()
    function.
    
    This problem exists since c5aff18204da0 ("net: mvneta: driver for

    tcp: fix false undo corner cases
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e08d5e3c8236e7484229e46fdf92006e1dd4c49 ]
    
    The undo code assumes that, upon entering loss recovery, TCP
    1) always retransmit something
    2) the retransmission never fails locally (e.g., qdisc drop)
    
    so undo_marker is set in tcp_enter_recovery() and undo_retrans is
    incremented only when tcp_retransmit_skb() is successful.
    
    When the assumption is broken because TCP's cwnd is too small to
    retransmit or the retransmit fails locally. The next (DUP)ACK
    would incorrectly revert the cwnd and the congestion state in
    tcp_try_undo_dsack() or tcp_may_undo(). Subsequent (DUP)ACKs
    may enter the recovery state. The sender repeatedly enter and
    (incorrectly) exit recovery states if the retransmits continue to
    fail locally while receiving (DUP)ACKs.
    
    The fix is to initialize undo_retrans to -1 and start counting on
    the first retransmission. Always increment undo_retrans even if the
    retransmissions fail locally because they couldn't cause DSACKs to
    undo the cwnd reduction.

    igmp: fix the problem when mc leave group
    
    [ Upstream commit 52ad353a5344f1f700c5b777175bdfa41d3cd65a ]
    
    The problem was triggered by these steps:
    
    1) create socket, bind and then setsockopt for add mc group.
       mreq.imr_multiaddr.s_addr = inet_addr("255.0.0.37");
       mreq.imr_interface.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.1.2");
       setsockopt(sockfd, IPPROTO_IP, IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, &mreq, sizeof(mreq));
    
    2) drop the mc group for this socket.
       mreq.imr_multiaddr.s_addr = inet_addr("255.0.0.37");
       mreq.imr_interface.s_addr = inet_addr("0.0.0.0");
       setsockopt(sockfd, IPPROTO_IP, IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP, &mreq, sizeof(mreq));
    
    3) and then drop the socket, I found the mc group was still used by the dev:
    
       netstat -g
    
       Interface       RefCnt Group
       --------------- ------ ---------------------
       eth2            1      255.0.0.37
    
    Normally even though the IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP return error, the mc group still need
    to be released for the netdev when drop the socket, but this process was broken when
    route default is NULL, the reason is that:
    
    The ip_mc_leave_group() will choose the in_dev by the imr_interface.s_addr, if input addr
    is NULL, the default route dev will be chosen, then the ifindex is got from the dev,
    then polling the inet->mc_list and return -ENODEV, but if the default route dev is NULL,
    the in_dev and ifIndex is both NULL, when polling the inet->mc_list, the mc group will be
    released from the mc_list, but the dev didn't dec the refcnt for this mc group, so
    when dropping the socket, the mc_list is NULL and the dev still keep this group.
    
    v1->v2: According Hideaki's suggestion, we should align with IPv6 (RFC3493) and BSDs,
            so I add the checking for the in_dev before polling the mc_list, make sure when

    net: Fix NETDEV_CHANGE notifier usage causing spurious arp flush
    
    [ Upstream commit 54951194656e4853e441266fd095f880bc0398f3 ]
    
    A bug was introduced in NETDEV_CHANGE notifier sequence causing the
    arp table to be sometimes spuriously cleared (including manual arp
    entries marked permanent), upon network link carrier changes.
    
    The changed argument for the notifier was applied only to a single
    caller of NETDEV_CHANGE, missing among others netdev_state_change().
    So upon net_carrier events induced by the network, which are
    triggering a call to netdev_state_change(), arp_netdev_event() would
    decide whether to clear or not arp cache based on random/junk stack
    values (a kind of read buffer overflow).

    ipv4: icmp: Fix pMTU handling for rare case
    
    [ Upstream commit 68b7107b62983f2cff0948292429d5f5999df096 ]
    
    Some older router implementations still send Fragmentation Needed
    errors with the Next-Hop MTU field set to zero. This is explicitly
    described as an eventuality that hosts must deal with by the
    standard (RFC 1191) since older standards specified that those
    bits must be zero.
    
    Linux had a generic (for all of IPv4) implementation of the algorithm
    described in the RFC for searching a list of MTU plateaus for a good
    value. Commit 46517008e116 ("ipv4: Kill ip_rt_frag_needed().")
    removed this as part of the changes to remove the routing cache.
    Subsequently any Fragmentation Needed packet with a zero Next-Hop
    MTU has been discarded without being passed to the per-protocol
    handlers or notifying userspace for raw sockets.
    
    When there is a router which does not implement RFC 1191 on an
    MTU limited path then this results in stalled connections since
    large packets are discarded and the local protocols are not
    notified so they never attempt to lower the pMTU.
    
    One example I have seen is an OpenBSD router terminating IPSec
    tunnels. It's worth pointing out that this case is distinct from
    the BSD 4.2 bug which incorrectly calculated the Next-Hop MTU
    since the commit in question dismissed that as a valid concern.
    
    All of the per-protocols handlers implement the simple approach from
    RFC 1191 of immediately falling back to the minimum value. Although
    this is sub-optimal it is vastly preferable to connections hanging
    indefinitely.
    
    Remove the Next-Hop MTU != 0 check and allow such packets
    to follow the normal path.

    tcp: Fix divide by zero when pushing during tcp-repair
    
    [ Upstream commit 5924f17a8a30c2ae18d034a86ee7581b34accef6 ]
    
    When in repair-mode and TCP_RECV_QUEUE is set, we end up calling
    tcp_push with mss_now being 0. If data is in the send-queue and
    tcp_set_skb_tso_segs gets called, we crash because it will divide by
    mss_now:

    This can easily be reproduced with the following packetdrill-script (the
    "magic" with netem, sk_pacing and limit_output_bytes is done to prevent
    the kernel from pushing all segments, because hitting the limit without
    doing this is not so easy with packetdrill):
    
    0   socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3
    +0  setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0
    
    +0  bind(3, ..., ...) = 0
    +0  listen(3, 1) = 0
    
    +0  < S 0:0(0) win 32792 <mss 1460>
    +0  > S. 0:0(0) ack 1 <mss 1460>
    +0.1  < . 1:1(0) ack 1 win 65000
    
    +0  accept(3, ..., ...) = 4
    
    // This forces that not all segments of the snd-queue will be pushed
    +0 `tc qdisc add dev tun0 root netem delay 10ms`
    +0 `sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_limit_output_bytes=2`
    +0 setsockopt(4, SOL_SOCKET, 47, [2], 4) = 0
    
    +0 write(4,...,10000) = 10000
    +0 write(4,...,10000) = 10000
    
    // Set tcp-repair stuff, particularly TCP_RECV_QUEUE
    +0 setsockopt(4, SOL_TCP, 19, [1], 4) = 0
    +0 setsockopt(4, SOL_TCP, 20, [1], 4) = 0
    
    // This now will make the write push the remaining segments
    +0 setsockopt(4, SOL_SOCKET, 47, [20000], 4) = 0
    +0 `sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_limit_output_bytes=130000`
    
    // Now we will crash
    +0 write(4,...,1000) = 1000
    
    This happens since ec3423257508 (tcp: fix retransmission in repair
    mode). Prior to that, the call to tcp_push was prevented by a check for
    tp->repair.
    
    The patch fixes it, by adding the new goto-label out_nopush. When exiting
    tcp_sendmsg and a push is not required, which is the case for tp->repair,
    we go to this label.
    
    When repairing and calling send() with TCP_RECV_QUEUE, the data is
    actually put in the receive-queue. So, no push is required because no
    data has been added to the send-queue.

    ipv4: irq safe sk_dst_[re]set() and ipv4_sk_update_pmtu() fix
    
    [ Upstream commit 7f502361531e9eecb396cf99bdc9e9a59f7ebd7f ]
    
    We have two different ways to handle changes to sk->sk_dst
    
    First way (used by TCP) assumes socket lock is owned by caller, and use
    no extra lock : __sk_dst_set() & __sk_dst_reset()
    
    Another way (used by UDP) uses sk_dst_lock because socket lock is not
    always taken. Note that sk_dst_lock is not softirq safe.
    
    These ways are not inter changeable for a given socket type.
    
    ipv4_sk_update_pmtu(), added in linux-3.8, added a race, as it used
    the socket lock as synchronization, but users might be UDP sockets.
    
    Instead of converting sk_dst_lock to a softirq safe version, use xchg()
    as we did for sk_rx_dst in commit e47eb5dfb296b ("udp: ipv4: do not use
    sk_dst_lock from softirq context")
    
    In a follow up patch, we probably can remove sk_dst_lock, as it is
    only used in IPv6.

    ipv4: fix dst race in sk_dst_get()
    
    [ Upstream commit f88649721268999bdff09777847080a52004f691 ]
    
    When IP route cache had been removed in linux-3.6, we broke assumption
    that dst entries were all freed after rcu grace period. DST_NOCACHE
    dst were supposed to be freed from dst_release(). But it appears
    we want to keep such dst around, either in UDP sockets or tunnels.
    
    In sk_dst_get() we need to make sure dst refcount is not 0
    before incrementing it, or else we might end up freeing a dst
    twice.
    
    DST_NOCACHE set on a dst does not mean this dst can not be attached
    to a socket or a tunnel.
    
    Then, before actual freeing, we need to observe a rcu grace period
    to make sure all other cpus can catch the fact the dst is no longer
    usable.

    net: fix UDP tunnel GSO of frag_list GRO packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 5882a07c72093dc3a18e2d2b129fb200686bb6ee ]
    
    This patch fixes a kernel BUG_ON in skb_segment. It is hit when
    testing two VMs on openvswitch with one VM acting as VXLAN gateway.
    
    During VXLAN packet GSO, skb_segment is called with skb->data
    pointing to inner TCP payload. skb_segment calls skb_network_protocol
    to retrieve the inner protocol. skb_network_protocol actually expects
    skb->data to point to MAC and it calls pskb_may_pull with ETH_HLEN.
    This ends up pulling in ETH_HLEN data from header tail. As a result,
    pskb_trim logic is skipped and BUG_ON is hit later.
    
    Move skb_push in front of skb_network_protocol so that skb->data
    lines up properly.

    net: huawei_cdc_ncm: increase command buffer size
    
    [ Upstream commit 3acc74619b0175b7a154cf8dc54813f6faf97aa9 ]
    
    Messages from the modem exceeding 256 bytes cause communication
    failure.
    
    The WDM protocol is strictly "read on demand", meaning that we only
    poll for unread data after receiving a notification from the modem.
    Since we have no way to know how much data the modem has to send,
    we must make sure that the buffer we provide is "big enough".
    Message truncation does not work. Truncated messages are left unread
    until the modem has another message to send.  Which often won't
    happen until the userspace application has given up waiting for the
    final part of the last message, and therefore sends another command.
    
    With a proper CDC WDM function there is a descriptor telling us
    which buffer size the modem uses. But with this vendor specific
    implementation there is no known way to calculate the exact "big
    enough" number.  It is an unknown property of the modem firmware.
    Experience has shown that 256 is too small.  The discussion of
    this failure ended up concluding that 512 might be too small as
    well. So 1024 seems like a reasonable value for now.

    [ Upstream commit e6afea0bbf129f88dc3fc39fd0d769f9ff064172 ]
    
    In commit 629c9a8fd0bbdfc6d702526b327470166ec39c6b (drivers: net: cpsw: Add
    default vlan for dual emac case also), api cpsw_add_default_vlan() also
    changes the port vlan which is required to seperate the ports which results
    in the following behavior
    
    In Dual EMAC mode, when both the Etnernet connected is connected to same
    switch, it creates a loop in the switch and when a broadcast packet is
    received it is forwarded to the other port which stalls the whole switch
    and needs a reset/power cycle to the switch to recover. So intead of using
    the api, add only the default VLAN entry in dual EMAC case.

    net: sctp: check proc_dointvec result in proc_sctp_do_auth
    
    [ Upstream commit 24599e61b7552673dd85971cf5a35369cd8c119e ]
    
    When writing to the sysctl field net.sctp.auth_enable, it can well
    be that the user buffer we handed over to proc_dointvec() via
    proc_sctp_do_auth() handler contains something other than integers.
    
    In that case, we would set an uninitialized 4-byte value from the
    stack to net->sctp.auth_enable that can be leaked back when reading
    the sysctl variable, and it can unintentionally turn auth_enable
    on/off based on the stack content since auth_enable is interpreted
    as a boolean.
    
    Fix it up by making sure proc_dointvec() returned sucessfully.

    tcp: fix tcp_match_skb_to_sack() for unaligned SACK at end of an skb
    
    [ Upstream commit 2cd0d743b05e87445c54ca124a9916f22f16742e ]
    
    If there is an MSS change (or misbehaving receiver) that causes a SACK
    to arrive that covers the end of an skb but is less than one MSS, then
    tcp_match_skb_to_sack() was rounding up pkt_len to the full length of
    the skb ("Round if necessary..."), then chopping all bytes off the skb
    and creating a zero-byte skb in the write queue.
    
    This was visible now because the recently simplified TLP logic in
    bef1909ee3ed1c ("tcp: fixing TLP's FIN recovery") could find that 0-byte
    skb at the end of the write queue, and now that we do not check that
    skb's length we could send it as a TLP probe.
    
    Consider the following example scenario:
    
     mss: 1000
     skb: seq: 0 end_seq: 4000  len: 4000
     SACK: start_seq: 3999 end_seq: 4000
    
    The tcp_match_skb_to_sack() code will compute:
    
     in_sack = false
     pkt_len = start_seq - TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->seq = 3999 - 0 = 3999
     new_len = (pkt_len / mss) * mss = (3999/1000)*1000 = 3000
     new_len += mss = 4000
    
    Previously we would find the new_len > skb->len check failing, so we
    would fall through and set pkt_len = new_len = 4000 and chop off
    pkt_len of 4000 from the 4000-byte skb, leaving a 0-byte segment
    afterward in the write queue.
    
    With this new commit, we notice that the new new_len >= skb->len check
    succeeds, so that we return without trying to fragment.

    net: sctp: propagate sysctl errors from proc_do* properly
    
    [ Upstream commit ff5e92c1affe7166b3f6e7073e648ed65a6e2e59 ]
    
    sysctl handler proc_sctp_do_hmac_alg(), proc_sctp_do_rto_min() and
    proc_sctp_do_rto_max() do not properly reflect some error cases
    when writing values via sysctl from internal proc functions such
    as proc_dointvec() and proc_dostring().
    
    In all these cases we pass the test for write != 0 and partially
    do additional work just to notice that additional sanity checks
    fail and we return with hard-coded -EINVAL while proc_do*
    functions might also return different errors. So fix this up by
    simply testing a successful return of proc_do* right after
    calling it.
    
    This also allows to propagate its return value onwards to the user.
    While touching this, also fix up some minor style issues.

    slip: Fix deadlock in write_wakeup
    
    [ Upstream commit 661f7fda21b15ec52f57fcd397c03370acc28688 ]
    
    Use schedule_work() to avoid potentially taking the spinlock in
    interrupt context.
    
    Commit cc9fa74e2a ("slip/slcan: added locking in wakeup function") added
    necessary locking to the wakeup function and 367525c8c2/ddcde142be ("can:
    slcan: Fix spinlock variant") converted it to spin_lock_bh() because the lock
    is also taken in timers.
    
    Disabling softirqs is not sufficient, however, as tty drivers may call
    write_wakeup from interrupt context. This driver calls tty->ops->write() with
    its spinlock held, which may immediately cause an interrupt on the same CPU and
    subsequent spin_bug().
    
    Simply converting to spin_lock_irq/irqsave() prevents this deadlock, but
    causes lockdep to point out a possible circular locking dependency
    between these locks:
    
    (&(&sl->lock)->rlock){-.....}, at: slip_write_wakeup
    (&port_lock_key){-.....}, at: serial8250_handle_irq.part.13
    
    The slip transmit is holding the slip spinlock when calling the tty write.
    This grabs the port lock. On an interrupt, the handler grabs the port
    lock and calls write_wakeup which grabs the slip lock. This could be a
    problem if a serial interrupt occurs on another CPU during the slip
    transmit.
    
    To deal with these issues, don't grab the lock in the wakeup function by
    deferring the writeout to a workqueue. Also hold the lock during close
    when de-assigning the tty pointer to safely disarm the worker and
    timers.
    
    This bug is easily reproducible on the first transmit when slip is
    used with the standard 8250 serial driver.

    ip_tunnel: fix ip_tunnel_lookup
    
    [ Upstream commit e0056593b61253f1a8a9941dacda22e73b963cdc ]
    
    This patch fixes 3 similar bugs where incoming packets might be routed into
    wrong non-wildcard tunnels:
    
    1) Consider the following setup:
        ip address add 1.1.1.1/24 dev eth0
        ip address add 1.1.1.2/24 dev eth0
        ip tunnel add ipip1 remote 2.2.2.2 local 1.1.1.1 mode ipip dev eth0
        ip link set ipip1 up
    
    Incoming ipip packets from 2.2.2.2 were routed into ipip1 even if it has dst =
    1.1.1.2. Moreover even if there was wildcard tunnel like
       ip tunnel add ipip0 remote 2.2.2.2 local any mode ipip dev eth0
    but it was created before explicit one (with local 1.1.1.1), incoming ipip
    packets with src = 2.2.2.2 and dst = 1.1.1.2 were still routed into ipip1.
    
    Same issue existed with all tunnels that use ip_tunnel_lookup (gre, vti)
    
    2)  ip address add 1.1.1.1/24 dev eth0
        ip tunnel add ipip1 remote 2.2.146.85 local 1.1.1.1 mode ipip dev eth0
        ip link set ipip1 up
    
    Incoming ipip packets with dst = 1.1.1.1 were routed into ipip1, no matter what
    src address is. Any remote ip address which has ip_tunnel_hash = 0 raised this
    issue, 2.2.146.85 is just an example, there are more than 4 million of them.
    And again, wildcard tunnel like
       ip tunnel add ipip0 remote any local 1.1.1.1 mode ipip dev eth0
    wouldn't be ever matched if it was created before explicit tunnel like above.
    
    Gre & vti tunnels had the same issue.
    
    3)  ip address add 1.1.1.1/24 dev eth0
        ip tunnel add gre1 remote 2.2.146.84 local 1.1.1.1 key 1 mode gre dev eth0
        ip link set gre1 up
    
    Any incoming gre packet with key = 1 were routed into gre1, no matter what
    src/dst addresses are. Any remote ip address which has ip_tunnel_hash = 0 raised
    the issue, 2.2.146.84 is just an example, there are more than 4 million of them.
    Wildcard tunnel like
       ip tunnel add gre2 remote any local any key 1 mode gre dev eth0
    wouldn't be ever matched if it was created before explicit tunnel like above.
    
    All this stuff happened because while looking for a wildcard tunnel we didn't
    check that matched tunnel is a wildcard one. Fixed.

    net/mlx4_en: Don't configure the HW vxlan parser when vxlan offloading isn't set
    
    [ Upstream commit e326f2f13b209d56782609e833b87cb497e64b3b ]
    
    The add_vxlan_port ndo driver code was wrongly testing whether HW vxlan offloads
    are supported by the device instead of checking if they are currently enabled.
    
    This causes the driver to configure the HW parser to conduct matching for vxlan
    packets but since no steering rules were set, vxlan packets are dropped on RX.
    
    Fix that by doing the right test, as done in the del_vxlan_port ndo handler.

    shmem: fix splicing from a hole while it's punched
    
    commit b1a366500bd537b50c3aad26dc7df083ec03a448 upstream.
    
    shmem_fault() is the actual culprit in trinity's hole-punch starvation,
    and the most significant cause of such problems: since a page faulted is
    one that then appears page_mapped(), needing unmap_mapping_range() and
    i_mmap_mutex to be unmapped again.
    
    But it is not the only way in which a page can be brought into a hole in
    the radix_tree while that hole is being punched; and Vlastimil's testing
    implies that if enough other processors are busy filling in the hole,
    then shmem_undo_range() can be kept from completing indefinitely.
    
    shmem_file_splice_read() is the main other user of SGP_CACHE, which can
    instantiate shmem pagecache pages in the read-only case (without holding
    i_mutex, so perhaps concurrently with a hole-punch).  Probably it's
    silly not to use SGP_READ already (using the ZERO_PAGE for holes): which
    ought to be safe, but might bring surprises - not a change to be rushed.
    
    shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp() is an internal interface used by
    drivers/gpu/drm GEM (and next by uprobes): it should be okay.  And
    shmem_file_read_iter() uses the SGP_DIRTY variant of SGP_CACHE, when
    called internally by the kernel (perhaps for a stacking filesystem,
    which might rely on holes to be reserved): it's unclear whether it could
    be provoked to keep hole-punch busy or not.
    
    We could apply the same umbrella as now used in shmem_fault() to
    shmem_file_splice_read() and the others; but it looks ugly, and use over
    a range raises questions - should it actually be per page? can these get
    starved themselves?
    
    The origin of this part of the problem is my v3.1 commit d0823576bf4b
    ("mm: pincer in truncate_inode_pages_range"), once it was duplicated
    into shmem.c.  It seemed like a nice idea at the time, to ensure
    (barring RCU lookup fuzziness) that there's an instant when the entire
    hole is empty; but the indefinitely repeated scans to ensure that make
    it vulnerable.
    
    Revert that "enhancement" to hole-punch from shmem_undo_range(), but
    retain the unproblematic rescanning when it's truncating; add a couple
    of comments there.
    
    Remove the "indices[0] >= end" test: that is now handled satisfactorily
    by the inner loop, and mem_cgroup_uncharge_start()/end() are too light
    to be worth avoiding here.
    
    But if we do not always loop indefinitely, we do need to handle the case
    of swap swizzled back to page before shmem_free_swap() gets it: add a
    retry for that case, as suggested by Konstantin Khlebnikov; and for the
    case of page swizzled back to swap, as suggested by Johannes Weiner.

    shmem: fix faulting into a hole, not taking i_mutex
    
    commit 8e205f779d1443a94b5ae81aa359cb535dd3021e upstream.
    
    Commit f00cdc6df7d7 ("shmem: fix faulting into a hole while it's
    punched") was buggy: Sasha sent a lockdep report to remind us that
    grabbing i_mutex in the fault path is a no-no (write syscall may already
    hold i_mutex while faulting user buffer).
    
    We tried a completely different approach (see following patch) but that
    proved inadequate: good enough for a rational workload, but not good
    enough against trinity - which forks off so many mappings of the object
    that contention on i_mmap_mutex while hole-puncher holds i_mutex builds
    into serious starvation when concurrent faults force the puncher to fall
    back to single-page unmap_mapping_range() searches of the i_mmap tree.
    
    So return to the original umbrella approach, but keep away from i_mutex
    this time.  We really don't want to bloat every shmem inode with a new
    mutex or completion, just to protect this unlikely case from trinity.
    So extend the original with wait_queue_head on stack at the hole-punch
    end, and wait_queue item on the stack at the fault end.
    
    This involves further use of i_lock to guard against the races: lockdep
    has been happy so far, and I see fs/inode.c:unlock_new_inode() holds
    i_lock around wake_up_bit(), which is comparable to what we do here.
    i_lock is more convenient, but we could switch to shmem's info->lock.
    
    This issue has been tagged with CVE-2014-4171, which will require commit
    f00cdc6df7d7 and this and the following patch to be backported: we
    suggest to 3.1+, though in fact the trinity forkbomb effect might go
    back as far as 2.6.16, when madvise(,,MADV_REMOVE) came in - or might
    not, since much has changed, with i_mmap_mutex a spinlock before 3.0.
    Anyone running trinity on 3.0 and earlier? I don't think we need care.

    shmem: fix faulting into a hole while it's punched
    
    commit f00cdc6df7d7cfcabb5b740911e6788cb0802bdb upstream.
    
    Trinity finds that mmap access to a hole while it's punched from shmem
    can prevent the madvise(MADV_REMOVE) or fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)
    from completing, until the reader chooses to stop; with the puncher's
    hold on i_mutex locking out all other writers until it can complete.
    
    It appears that the tmpfs fault path is too light in comparison with its
    hole-punching path, lacking an i_data_sem to obstruct it; but we don't
    want to slow down the common case.
    
    Extend shmem_fallocate()'s existing range notification mechanism, so
    shmem_fault() can refrain from faulting pages into the hole while it's
    punched, waiting instead on i_mutex (when safe to sleep; or repeatedly
    faulting when not).

    xen/manage: fix potential deadlock when resuming the console
    
    commit 1b6478231c6f5f844185acb32045cf195028cfce upstream.
    
    Calling xen_console_resume() in xen_suspend() causes a warning because
    it locks irq_mapping_update_lock (a mutex) and this may sleep.  If a
    userspace process is using the evtchn device then this mutex may be
    locked at the point of the stop_machine() call and
    xen_console_resume() would then deadlock.
    
    Resuming the console after stop_machine() returns avoids this
    deadlock.

    xen/balloon: set ballooned out pages as invalid in p2m
    
    commit fb9a0c443691ceaab3daba966bbbd9f5ff3aa26f upstream.
    
    Since cd9151e26d31048b2b5e00fd02e110e07d2200c9 (xen/balloon: set a
    mapping for ballooned out pages), a ballooned out page had its entry
    in the p2m set to the MFN of one of the scratch pages.  This means
    that the p2m will contain many entries pointing to the same MFN.
    
    During a domain save, these many-to-one entries are not identified as
    such and the scratch page is saved multiple times. On restore the
    ballooned pages are populated with new frames and the domain may use
    up its allocation before all pages can be restored.
    
    Since the original fix only needed to keep a mapping for the ballooned
    page it is safe to set ballooned out pages as INVALID_P2M_ENTRY in the
    p2m (as they were before). Thus preventing them from being saved and
    re-populated on restore.

    commit 8abfb8727f4a724d31f9ccfd8013fbd16d539445 upstream.
    
    Currently trace option stacktrace is not applicable for

    in __trace_puts/__trace_bputs ftrace_trace_stack is missing.
    
    In contrast, when using trace_printk with non constant string
    argument(will call into __trace_printk/__trace_bprintk), then
    trace option stacktrace is workable, this inconstant result
    will confuses users a lot.

    tracing: Fix graph tracer with stack tracer on other archs
    
    commit 5f8bf2d263a20b986225ae1ed7d6759dc4b93af9 upstream.
    
    Running my ftrace tests on PowerPC, it failed the test that checks
    if function_graph tracer is affected by the stack tracer. It was.
    Looking into this, I found that the update_function_graph_func()
    must be called even if the trampoline function is not changed.
    This is because archs like PowerPC do not support ftrace_ops being
    passed by assembly and instead uses a helper function (what the
    trampoline function points to). Since this function is not changed
    even when multiple ftrace_ops are added to the code, the test that
    falls out before calling update_function_graph_func() will miss that
    the update must still be done.
    
    Call update_function_graph_function() for all calls to
    update_ftrace_function()

    iio:core: Handle error when mask type is not separate
    
    commit 78b3321610bf920d7fceb1a0236faa881be0bcf3 upstream.
    
    When event spec is shared by multiple channels, which has definition
    for mask_shared_by_type, iio_device_register_eventset fails.
    
    For example:
    static const struct iio_event_spec iio_dummy_events[] = {
            {
                    .type = IIO_EV_TYPE_THRESH,
                    .dir = IIO_EV_DIR_RISING,
                    .mask_separate = BIT(IIO_EV_INFO_ENABLE),
                    .mask_shared_by_type = BIT(IIO_EV_INFO_VALUE),
            }, {
                    .type = IIO_EV_TYPE_THRESH,
                    .dir = IIO_EV_DIR_FALLING,
                    .mask_separate = BIT(IIO_EV_INFO_ENABLE),a
                    .mask_shared_by_type = BIT(IIO_EV_INFO_VALUE),
            }
    };
    
    If two channels use this event spec, this will result in error.
    
    This change handles EBUSY error similar to iio_device_add_info_mask_type().

    fuse: ignore entry-timeout on LOOKUP_REVAL
    
    commit 154210ccb3a871e631bf39fdeb7a8731d98af87b upstream.
    
    The following test case demonstrates the bug:
    
      sh# mount -t glusterfs localhost:meta-test /mnt/one
    
      sh# mount -t glusterfs localhost:meta-test /mnt/two
    
      sh# echo stuff > /mnt/one/file; rm -f /mnt/two/file; echo stuff > /mnt/one/file
      bash: /mnt/one/file: Stale file handle
    
      sh# echo stuff > /mnt/one/file; rm -f /mnt/two/file; sleep 1; echo stuff > /mnt/one/file
    
    On the second open() on /mnt/one, FUSE would have used the old
    nodeid (file handle) trying to re-open it. Gluster is returning
    -ESTALE. The ESTALE propagates back to namei.c:filename_lookup()
    where lookup is re-attempted with LOOKUP_REVAL. The right
    behavior now, would be for FUSE to ignore the entry-timeout and
    and do the up-call revalidation. Instead FUSE is ignoring
    LOOKUP_REVAL, succeeding the revalidation (because entry-timeout
    has not passed), and open() is again retried on the old file
    handle and finally the ESTALE is going back to the application.
    
    Fix: if revalidation is happening with LOOKUP_REVAL, then ignore
    entry-timeout and always do the up-call.

      BUG: scheduling while atomic: fuse.hf/13976/0x10000001

    ALSA: hda - Fix broken PM due to incomplete i915 initialization
    
    commit 4da63c6fc426023d1a20e45508c47d7d68c6a53d upstream.
    
    When the initialization of Intel HDMI controller fails due to missing
    i915 kernel symbols (e.g. HD-audio is built in while i915 is module),
    the driver discontinues the probe.  However, since the probe was done
    asynchronously, the driver object still remains, thus the relevant PM
    ops are still called at suspend/resume. This results in the bad access
    to the incomplete audio card object, eventually leads to Oops or stall
    at PM.
    
    This patch adds the missing checks of chip->init_failed flag at each
    PM callback in order to fix the problem above.

    ALSA: hda - Revert stream assignment order for Intel controllers
    
    commit cd50065b3be83a705635550c04e368f2a4cc44d0 upstream.
    
    We got a regression report for 3.15.x kernels, and this turned out to
    be triggered by the fix for stream assignment order.  On reporter's
    machine with Intel controller (8086:1e20) + VIA VT1802 codec, the
    first playback slot can't work with speaker outputs.
    
    But the original commit was actually a fix for AMD controllers where
    no proper GCAP value is returned, we shouldn't revert the whole
    commit.  Instead, in this patch, a new flag is introduced to determine
    the stream assignment order, and follow the old behavior for Intel
    controllers.

    usb: chipidea: udc: Disable auto ZLP generation on ep0
    
    commit 953c66469735aed8d2ada639a72b150f01dae605 upstream.
    
    There are 2 methods for ZLP (zero-length packet) generation:
    1) In software
    2) Automatic generation by device controller
    
    1) is implemented in UDC driver and it attaches ZLP to IN packet if
       descriptor->size < wLength
    2) can be enabled/disabled by setting ZLT bit in the QH
    
    When gadget ffs is connected to ubuntu host, the host sends
    get descriptor request and wLength in setup packet is 255 while the
    size of descriptor which will be sent by gadget in IN packet is
    64 byte. So the composite driver sets req->zero = 1.
    In UDC driver following code will be executed then
    
            if (hwreq->req.zero && hwreq->req.length
                && (hwreq->req.length % hwep->ep.maxpacket == 0))
                    add_td_to_list(hwep, hwreq, 0);
    
    Case-A:
    So in case of ubuntu host, UDC driver will attach a ZLP to the IN packet.
    ubuntu host will request 255 byte in IN request, gadget will send 64 byte
    with ZLP and host will come to know that there is no more data.
    But hold on, by default ZLT=0 for endpoint 0 so hardware also tries to
    automatically generate the ZLP which blocks enumeration for ~6 seconds due
    to endpoint 0 STALL, NAKs are sent to host for any requests (OUT/PING)
    
    Case-B:
    In case when gadget ffs is connected to Apple device, Apple device sends
    setup packet with wLength=64. So descriptor->size = 64 and wLength=64
    therefore req->zero = 0 and UDC driver will not attach any ZLP to the
    IN packet. Apple device requests 64 bytes, gets 64 bytes and doesn't
    further request for IN data. But ZLT=0 by default for endpoint 0 so
    hardware tries to automatically generate the ZLP which blocks enumeration
    for ~6 seconds due to endpoint 0 STALL, NAKs are sent to host for any
    requests (OUT/PING)
    
    According to USB2.0 specs:
    
        8.5.3.2 Variable-length Data Stage
        A control pipe may have a variable-length data phase in which the
        host requests more data than is contained in the specified data
        structure. When all of the data structure is returned to the host,
        the function should indicate that the Data stage is ended by
        returning a packet that is shorter than the MaxPacketSize for the
        pipe. If the data structure is an exact multiple of wMaxPacketSize
        for the pipe, the function will return a zero-length packet to indicate
        the end of the Data stage.
    
    In Case-A mentioned above:
    If we disable software ZLP generation & ZLT=0 for endpoint 0 OR if software
    ZLP generation is not disabled but we set ZLT=1 for endpoint 0 then
    enumeration doesn't block for 6 seconds.
    
    In Case-B mentioned above:
    If we disable software ZLP generation & ZLT=0 for endpoint then enumeration
    still blocks due to ZLP automatically generated by hardware and host not needing
    it. But if we keep software ZLP generation enabled but we set ZLT=1 for
    endpoint 0 then enumeration doesn't block for 6 seconds.
    
    So the proper solution for this issue seems to disable automatic ZLP generation
    by hardware (i.e by setting ZLT=1 for endpoint 0) and let software (UDC driver)
    handle the ZLP generation based on req->zero field.

    usb: Check if port status is equal to RxDetect
    
    commit bb86cf569bbd7ad4dce581a37c7fbd748057e9dc upstream.
    
    When using USB 3.0 pen drive with the [AMD] FCH USB XHCI Controller
    [1022:7814], the second hotplugging will experience the USB 3.0 pen
    drive is recognized as high-speed device. After bisecting the kernel,
    I found the commit number 41e7e056cdc662f704fa9262e5c6e213b4ab45dd
    (USB: Allow USB 3.0 ports to be disabled.) causes the bug. After doing
    some experiments, the bug can be fixed by avoiding executing the function
    hub_usb3_port_disable(). Because the port status with [AMD] FCH USB
    XHCI Controlleris [1022:7814] is already in RxDetect
    (I tried printing out the port status before setting to Disabled state),
    it's reasonable to check the port status before really executing
    hub_usb3_port_disable().
    
    Fixes: 41e7e056cdc6 (USB: Allow USB 3.0 ports to be disabled.)
