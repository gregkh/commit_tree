    Revert "block: fix request_queue->flags initialization"
    
    This reverts commit 2101aa5bb084931f22fa08cacd6d69c80afade7f which is
    commit 60ea8226cbd5c8301f9a39edc574ddabcb8150e0 upstream.
    
    To quote Ben:
            This is not needed, as there is no QUEUE_FLAG_BYPASS in 3.0.y.
    
    To quote Tejun:
            I don't think it will break anything as it simply changes
            assignment to |= to avoid overwriting existing flags.  That
            said, any patch can break anything, so if possible it would be
            better to drop for 3.0.y.
    
    So I'll revert this to be safe.
