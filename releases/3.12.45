    HID: hid-sensor-hub: fix sleeping function called from invalid context
    
    commit f74346a04b79c9a5e50a2ee5e923b94195975d17 upstream.
    
    Fix issue with the sleeping calling hid_hw_request under spinlock.
    When i2c is used as HID transport, this is calling kmalloc, which
    can sleep. So remove call to this function while under spinlock.

    On r-/sh-mobile SoCs MSTP clocks are used by the runtime PM to dynamically
    enable and disable peripheral clocks. To make sure the clock has really

    commit 11313746547015ace605c4c347a40350753051e4 upstream.
    
    On R-Mobile APE6, since it has 3 thermal zones, ENR register
    has enable bits in bit 19-16, bit 11-8 and bit 3-0.
    
    However, on R-Car gen2, since it has 1 thermal zone, ENR register has
    enable bits in bit 3-0. (In other words, the write value should always
    be 0 for bit 31-4 of ENR register.)
    
    So, this patch fixes the ENR register value using I/O resource sets.

    commit 26bb0e9a1a938ec98ee07aa76533f1a711fba706 upstream.
    
    It turns out that some boards can have instance->lower greater than 0 and
    when thermal trend is dropping it results with next_target equal to -1.
    
    Since the next_target is defined as unsigned long it is interpreted as
    0xFFFFFFFF and larger than instance->upper.
    As a result the next_target is set to instance->upper which ramps up to
    maximal cooling device target when the temperature is steadily decreasing.

    On A MIPS 32-cores machine a BUG_ON was triggered because some acesses to

    leds / PM: fix hibernation on arm when gpio-led used with CPU led trigger
    
    commit 084609bf727981c7a2e6e69aefe0052c9d793300 upstream.
    
    Setting a dev_pm_ops suspend/resume pair of callbacks but not a set of
    hibernation callbacks means those pm functions will not be
    called upon hibernation - that leads to system crash on ARM during
    freezing if gpio-led is used in combination with CPU led trigger.
    It may happen after freeze_noirq stage (GPIO is suspended)
    and before syscore_suspend stage (CPU led trigger is suspended)
    - usually when disable_nonboot_cpus() is called.
    
    Log:
      PM: noirq freeze of devices complete after 1.425 msecs
      Disabling non-boot CPUs ...
        ^ system may crash or stuck here with message (TI AM572x)

      CPU1: shutdown
        ^ or here
    
    Fix this by using SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS, which appropriately
    assigns the suspend and hibernation callbacks and move
    led_suspend/led_resume under CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to avoid
    build warnings.

    regmap: Fix possible shift overflow in regmap_field_init()
    
    commit 921cc29473a0d7c109105c1876ddb432f4a4be7d upstream.
    
    The way the mask is generated in regmap_field_init() is wrong.
    Indeed, a field initialized with msb = 31 and lsb = 0 provokes a shift
    overflow while calculating the mask field.
    
    On some 32 bits architectures, such as x86, the generated mask is 0,
    instead of the expected 0xffffffff.
    
    This patch uses GENMASK() to fix the problem, as this macro is already safe
    regarding shift overflow.
    
    [-js: in 3.12, we do not have GENMASK for general access. Define
    locally as RM_GENMASK.]

    regmap: Fix regmap_bulk_read in BE mode
    
    commit 15b8d2c41fe5839582029f65c5f7004db451cc2b upstream.
    
    In big endian mode regmap_bulk_read gives incorrect data
    for byte reads.
    
    This is because memcpy of a single byte from an address
    after full word read gives different results when
    endianness differs. ie. we get little-end in LE and big-end in BE.

    cpuidle / menu: Return (-1) if there are no suitable states
    
    commit 3836785a1bdcd6706c68ad46bf53adc0b057b310 upstream.
    
    If there is a PM QoS latency limit and all of the sufficiently shallow
    C-states are disabled, the cpuidle menu governor returns 0 which on
    some systems is CPUIDLE_DRIVER_STATE_START and shouldn't be returned

    arm64: vdso: work-around broken ELF toolchains in Makefile
    
    commit 6f1a6ae87c0c60d7c462ef8fd071f291aa7a9abb upstream.
    
    When building the kernel with a bare-metal (ELF) toolchain, the -shared
    option may not be passed down to collect2, resulting in silent corruption
    of the vDSO image (in particular, the DYNAMIC section is omitted).
    
    The effect of this corruption is that the dynamic linker fails to find
    the vDSO symbols and libc is instead used for the syscalls that we
    intended to optimise (e.g. gettimeofday). Functionally, there is no
    issue as the sigreturn trampoline is still intact and located by the
    kernel.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by explicitly passing -shared to the linker
    when building the vDSO.

    arm64: mm: Fix freeing of the wrong memmap entries with !SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP
    
    commit b9bcc919931611498e856eae9bf66337330d04cc upstream.
    
    The memmap freeing code in free_unused_memmap() computes the end of
    each memblock by adding the memblock size onto the base.  However,
    if SPARSEMEM is enabled then the value (start) used for the base
    may already have been rounded downwards to work out which memmap
    entries to free after the previous memblock.
    
    This may cause memmap entries that are in use to get freed.
    
    In general, you're not likely to hit this problem unless there
    are at least 2 memblocks and one of them is not aligned to a
    sparsemem section boundary.  Note that carve-outs can increase
    the number of memblocks by splitting the regions listed in the
    device tree.
    
    This problem doesn't occur with SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP, because the
    vmemmap code deals with freeing the unused regions of the memmap
    instead of requiring the arch code to do it.
    
    This patch gets the memblock base out of the memblock directly when
    computing the block end address to ensure the correct value is used.

    ARC: add compiler barrier to LLSC based cmpxchg
    
    commit d57f727264f1425a94689bafc7e99e502cb135b5 upstream.
    
    When auditing cmpxchg call sites, Chuck noted that gcc was optimizing
    away some of the desired LDs.
    
    |       do {
    |               new = old = *ipi_data_ptr;
    |               new |= 1U << msg;
    |       } while (cmpxchg(ipi_data_ptr, old, new) != old);
    
    was generating to below
    
    | 8015cef8:     ld         r2,[r4,0]  <-- First LD
    | 8015cefc:     bset       r1,r2,r1
    |
    | 8015cf00:     llock      r3,[r4]  <-- atomic op
    | 8015cf04:     brne       r3,r2,8015cf10
    | 8015cf08:     scond      r1,[r4]

    | 8015cf10:     brne       r3,r2,8015cf00  <-- Branch doesn't go to orig LD
    
    Although this was fixed by adding a ACCESS_ONCE in this call site, it
    seems safer (for now at least) to add compiler barrier to LLSC based
    cmpxchg

    ALSA: hda - Fix the dock headphone output on Fujitsu Lifebook E780
    
    commit 4df3fd1700abbb53bd874143dfd1f9ac9e7cbf4b upstream.
    
    Fujitsu Lifebook E780 sets the sequence number 0x0f to only only of
    the two headphones, thus the driver tries to assign another as the
    line-out, and this results in the inconsistent mapping between the
    created jack ctl and the actual I/O.  Due to this, PulseAudio doesn't
    handle it properly and gets the silent output.
    
    The fix is to ignore the non-HP sequencer checks.

    rcu: Correctly handle non-empty Tiny RCU callback list with none ready
    
    commit 6e91f8cb138625be96070b778d9ba71ce520ea7e upstream.
    
    If, at the time __rcu_process_callbacks() is invoked,  there are callbacks
    in Tiny RCU's callback list, but none of them are ready to be invoked,
    the current list-management code will knit the non-ready callbacks out
    of the list.  This can result in hangs and possibly worse.  This commit
    therefore inserts a check for there being no callbacks that can be
    invoked immediately.
    
    This bug is unlikely to occur -- you have to get a new callback between
    the time rcu_sched_qs() or rcu_bh_qs() was called, but before we get to
    __rcu_process_callbacks().  It was detected by the addition of RCU-bh
    testing to rcutorture, which in turn was instigated by Iftekhar Ahmed's
    mutation testing.  Although this bug was made much more likely by
    915e8a4fe45e (rcu: Remove fastpath from __rcu_process_callbacks()), this
    did not cause the bug, but rather made it much more probable.   That
    said, it takes more than 40 hours of rcutorture testing, on average,
    for this bug to appear, so this fix cannot be considered an emergency.

    x86/PCI: Use host bridge _CRS info on systems with >32 bit addressing
    
    commit 3d9fecf6bfb8b12bc2f9a4c7109895a2a2bb9436 upstream.
    
    We enable _CRS on all systems from 2008 and later.  On older systems, we
    ignore _CRS and assume the whole physical address space (excluding RAM and
    other devices) is available for PCI devices, but on systems that support
    physical address spaces larger than 4GB, it's doubtful that the area above
    4GB is really available for PCI.
    
    After d56dbf5bab8c ("PCI: Allocate 64-bit BARs above 4G when possible"), we
    try to use that space above 4GB *first*, so we're more likely to put a
    device there.
    
    On Juan's Toshiba Satellite Pro U200, BIOS left the graphics, sound, 1394,
    and card reader devices unassigned (but only after Windows had been
    booted).  Only the sound device had a 64-bit BAR, so it was the only device
    placed above 4GB, and hence the only device that didn't work.
    
    Keep _CRS enabled even on pre-2008 systems if they support physical address
    space larger than 4GB.

    powerpc/perf: Fix book3s kernel to userspace backtraces
    
    commit 72e349f1124a114435e599479c9b8d14bfd1ebcd upstream.
    
    When we take a PMU exception or a software event we call
    perf_read_regs(). This overloads regs->result with a boolean that
    describes if we should use the sampled instruction address register
    (SIAR) or the regs.
    
    If the exception is in kernel, we start with the kernel regs and
    backtrace through the kernel stack. At this point we switch to the
    userspace regs and backtrace the user stack with perf_callchain_user().
    
    Unfortunately these regs have not got the perf_read_regs() treatment,
    so regs->result could be anything. If it is non zero,
    perf_instruction_pointer() decides to use the SIAR, and we get issues
    like this:

    Notice the bogus _raw_spin_irqsave when we transition from kernel
    (system_call) to userspace (0x7e714). We inserted what was in the SIAR.
    
    Add a check in regs_use_siar() to check that the regs in question
    are from a PMU exception. With this fix the backtrace makes sense:

    arm: KVM: force execution of HCPTR access on VM exit
    
    commit 85e84ba31039595995dae80b277378213602891b upstream.
    
    On VM entry, we disable access to the VFP registers in order to
    perform a lazy save/restore of these registers.
    
    On VM exit, we restore access, test if we did enable them before,
    and save/restore the guest/host registers if necessary. In this
    sequence, the FPEXC register is always accessed, irrespective
    of the trapping configuration.
    
    If the guest didn't touch the VFP registers, then the HCPTR access
    has now enabled such access, but we're missing a barrier to ensure
    architectural execution of the new HCPTR configuration. If the HCPTR
    access has been delayed/reordered, the subsequent access to FPEXC
    will cause a trap, which we aren't prepared to handle at all.
    
    The same condition exists when trapping to enable VFP for the guest.
    
    The fix is to introduce a barrier after enabling VFP access. In the
    vmexit case, it can be relaxed to only takes place if the guest hasn't
    accessed its view of the VFP registers, making the access to FPEXC safe.
    
    The set_hcptr macro is modified to deal with both vmenter/vmexit and
    vmtrap operations, and now takes an optional label that is branched to
    when the guest hasn't touched the VFP registers.

    The conversion to be16_add_cpu() is incorrect in case cryptlen is
    negative due to premature (i.e. before addition / subtraction)
    implicit conversion of cryptlen (int -> u16) leading to sign loss.

    sctp: Fix race between OOTB responce and route removal
    
    [ Upstream commit 29c4afc4e98f4dc0ea9df22c631841f9c220b944 ]
    
    There is NULL pointer dereference possible during statistics update if the route
    used for OOTB responce is removed at unfortunate time. If the route exists when
    we receive OOTB packet and we finally jump into sctp_packet_transmit() to send
    ABORT, but in the meantime route is removed under our feet, we take "no_route"
    path and try to update stats with IP_INC_STATS(sock_net(asoc->base.sk), ...).
    
    But sctp_ootb_pkt_new() used to prepare responce packet doesn't call
    sctp_transport_set_owner() and therefore there is no asoc associated with this
    packet. Probably temporary asoc just for OOTB responces is overkill, so just
    introduce a check like in all other places in sctp_packet_transmit(), where
    "asoc" is dereferenced.
    
    To reproduce this, one needs to
    0. ensure that sctp module is loaded (otherwise ABORT is not generated)
    1. remove default route on the machine
    2. while true; do
         ip route del [interface-specific route]
         ip route add [interface-specific route]
       done
    3. send enough OOTB packets (i.e. HB REQs) from another host to trigger ABORT
       responce
    
    On x86_64 the crash looks like this:

    The lockless lookups can return entry that is unlinked.
    Sometimes they get reference before last neigh_cleanup_and_release,
    sometimes they do not need reference. Later, any
    modification attempts may result in the following problems:
    
    1. entry is not destroyed immediately because neigh_update
    can start the timer for dead entry, eg. on change to NUD_REACHABLE
    state. As result, entry lives for some time but is invisible
    and out of control.
    
    2. __neigh_event_send can run in parallel with neigh_destroy
    while refcnt=0 but if timer is started and expired refcnt can
    reach 0 for second time leading to second neigh_destroy and
    possible crash.
    
    Thanks to Eric Dumazet and Ying Xue for their work and analyze
    on the __neigh_event_send change.

    packet: avoid out of bounds read in round robin fanout
    
    [ Upstream commit 468479e6043c84f5a65299cc07cb08a22a28c2b1 ]
    
    PACKET_FANOUT_LB computes f->rr_cur such that it is modulo
    f->num_members. It returns the old value unconditionally, but
    f->num_members may have changed since the last store. Ensure
    that the return value is always < num.
    
    When modifying the logic, simplify it further by replacing the loop
    with an unconditional atomic increment.

    bridge: fix br_stp_set_bridge_priority race conditions
    
    [ Upstream commit 2dab80a8b486f02222a69daca6859519e05781d9 ]
    
    After the ->set() spinlocks were removed br_stp_set_bridge_priority
    was left running without any protection when used via sysfs. It can
    race with port add/del and could result in use-after-free cases and
    corrupted lists. Tested by running port add/del in a loop with stp
    enabled while setting priority in a loop, crashes are easily
    reproducible.
    The spinlocks around sysfs ->set() were removed in commit:
    14f98f258f19 ("bridge: range check STP parameters")
    There's also a race condition in the netlink priority support that is
    fixed by this change, but it was introduced recently and the fixes tag

    sctp: fix ASCONF list handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d45a02d0166caf2627fe91897c6ffc3b19514c4 ]
    
    ->auto_asconf_splist is per namespace and mangled by functions like
    sctp_setsockopt_auto_asconf() which doesn't guarantee any serialization.
    
    Also, the call to inet_sk_copy_descendant() was backuping
    ->auto_asconf_list through the copy but was not honoring
    ->do_auto_asconf, which could lead to list corruption if it was
    different between both sockets.
    
    This commit thus fixes the list handling by using ->addr_wq_lock
    spinlock to protect the list. A special handling is done upon socket
    creation and destruction for that. Error handlig on sctp_init_sock()
    will never return an error after having initialized asconf, so
    sctp_destroy_sock() can be called without addrq_wq_lock. The lock now
    will be take on sctp_close_sock(), before locking the socket, so we
    don't do it in inverse order compared to sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler().
    
    Instead of taking the lock on sctp_sock_migrate() for copying and
    restoring the list values, it's preferred to avoid rewritting it by
    implementing sctp_copy_descendant().
    
    Issue was found with a test application that kept flipping sysctl
    default_auto_asconf on and off, but one could trigger it by issuing
    simultaneous setsockopt() calls on multiple sockets or by
    creating/destroying sockets fast enough. This is only triggerable
    locally.

    net: don't wait for order-3 page allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit fb05e7a89f500cfc06ae277bdc911b281928995d ]
    
    We saw excessive direct memory compaction triggered by skb_page_frag_refill.
    This causes performance issues and add latency. Commit 5640f7685831e0
    introduces the order-3 allocation. According to the changelog, the order-3
    allocation isn't a must-have but to improve performance. But direct memory
    compaction has high overhead. The benefit of order-3 allocation can't
    compensate the overhead of direct memory compaction.
    
    This patch makes the order-3 page allocation atomic. If there is no memory
    pressure and memory isn't fragmented, the alloction will still success, so we
    don't sacrifice the order-3 benefit here. If the atomic allocation fails,
    direct memory compaction will not be triggered, skb_page_frag_refill will
    fallback to order-0 immediately, hence the direct memory compaction overhead is
    avoided. In the allocation failure case, kswapd is waken up and doing
    compaction, so chances are allocation could success next time.
    
    alloc_skb_with_frags is the same.
    
    The mellanox driver does similar thing, if this is accepted, we must fix
    the driver too.

    V2: make the changelog clearer

    bridge: fix multicast router rlist endless loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a040eaca1a22f8da8285ceda6b5e4a2cb704867 ]
    
    Since the addition of sysfs multicast router support if one set
    multicast_router to "2" more than once, then the port would be added to
    the hlist every time and could end up linking to itself and thus causing an
    endless loop for rlist walkers.
    So to reproduce just do:
    echo 2 > multicast_router; echo 2 > multicast_router;
    in a bridge port and let some igmp traffic flow, for me it hangs up
    in br_multicast_flood().
    Fix this by adding a check in br_multicast_add_router() if the port is
    already linked.
    The reason this didn't happen before the addition of multicast_router
    sysfs entries is because there's a !hlist_unhashed check that prevents
    it.

    arm64/mm: Remove hack in mmap randomize layout
    
    commit d6c763afab142a85e4770b4bc2a5f40f256d5c5d upstream.
    
    Since commit 8a0a9bd4db63 ('random: make get_random_int() more
    random'), get_random_int() returns a random value for each call,
    so comment and hack introduced in mmap_rnd() as part of commit
    1d18c47c735e ('arm64: MMU fault handling and page table management')
    are incorrects.
    
    Commit 1d18c47c735e seems to use the same hack introduced by
    commit a5adc91a4b44 ('powerpc: Ensure random space between stack
    and mmaps'), latter copied in commit 5a0efea09f42 ('sparc64: Sharpen
    address space randomization calculations.').
    
    But both architectures were cleaned up as part of commit
    fa8cbaaf5a68 ('powerpc+sparc64/mm: Remove hack in mmap randomize
    layout') as hack is no more needed since commit 8a0a9bd4db63.
    
    So the present patch removes the comment and the hack around
    get_random_int() on AArch64's mmap_rnd().

    Btrfs: make xattr replace operations atomic
    
    commit 5f5bc6b1e2d5a6f827bc860ef2dc5b6f365d1339 upstream.
    
    Replacing a xattr consists of doing a lookup for its existing value, delete
    the current value from the respective leaf, release the search path and then
    finally insert the new value. This leaves a time window where readers (getxattr,
    listxattrs) won't see any value for the xattr. Xattrs are used to store ACLs,
    so this has security implications.
    
    This change also fixes 2 other existing issues which were:
    
    *) Deleting the old xattr value without verifying first if the new xattr will
       fit in the existing leaf item (in case multiple xattrs are packed in the
       same item due to name hash collision);
    
    *) Returning -EEXIST when the flag XATTR_CREATE is given and the xattr doesn't
       exist but we have have an existing item that packs muliple xattrs with
       the same name hash as the input xattr. In this case we should return ENOSPC.
    
    A test case for xfstests follows soon.
    
    Thanks to Alexandre Oliva for reporting the non-atomicity of the xattr replace
    implementation.

    kprobes/x86: Return correct length in __copy_instruction()
    
    commit c80e5c0c23ce2282476fdc64c4b5e3d3a40723fd upstream.
    
    On x86-64, __copy_instruction() always returns 0 (error) if the
    instruction uses %rip-relative addressing. This is because
    kernel_insn_init() is called the second time for 'insn' instance
    in such cases and sets all its fields to 0.
    
    Because of this, trying to place a kprobe on such instruction
    will fail, register_kprobe() will return -EINVAL.
    
    This patch fixes the problem.

    pipe: iovec: Fix memory corruption when retrying atomic copy as non-atomic
    
    pipe_iov_copy_{from,to}_user() may be tried twice with the same iovec,
    the first time atomically and the second time not.  The second attempt
    needs to continue from the iovec position, pipe buffer offset and
    remaining length where the first attempt failed, but currently the
    pipe buffer offset and remaining length are reset.  This will corrupt
    the piped data (possibly also leading to an information leak between
    processes) and may also corrupt kernel memory.
    
    This was fixed upstream by commits f0d1bec9d58d ("new helper:
    copy_page_from_iter()") and 637b58c2887e ("switch pipe_read() to
    copy_page_to_iter()"), but those aren't suitable for stable.  This fix
    for older kernel versions was made by Seth Jennings for RHEL and I
    have extracted it from their update.

    lpfc: Add iotag memory barrier
    
    commit 27f344eb15dd0da80ebec80c7245e8c85043f841 upstream.
    
    Add a memory barrier to ensure the valid bit is read before
    any of the cqe payload is read. This fixes an issue seen
    on Power where the cqe payload was getting loaded before
    the valid bit. When this occurred, we saw an iotag out of
    range error when a command completed, but since the iotag
    looked invalid the command didn't get completed to scsi core.
    Later we hit the command timeout, attempted to abort the command,
    then waited for the aborted command to get returned. Since the
    adapter already returned the command, we timeout waiting,
    and end up escalating EEH all the way to host reset. This
    patch fixes this issue.

    drm/i915: Evict CS TLBs between batches
    
    commit c4d69da167fa967749aeb70bc0e94a457e5d00c1 upstream.
    
    Running igt, I was encountering the invalid TLB bug on my 845g, despite
    that it was using the CS workaround. Examining the w/a buffer in the
    error state, showed that the copy from the user batch into the
    workaround itself was suffering from the invalid TLB bug (the first
    cacheline was broken with the first two words reversed). Time to try a
    fresh approach. This extends the workaround to write into each page of
    our scratch buffer in order to overflow the TLB and evict the invalid
    entries. This could be refined to only do so after we update the GTT,
    but for simplicity, we do it before each batch.
    
    I suspect this supersedes our current workaround, but for safety keep
    doing both.
    
    V2: The magic number shall be 2.
    
    This doesn't conclusively prove that it is the mythical TLB bug we've
    been trying to workaround for so long, that it requires touching a number
    of pages to prevent the corruption indicates to me that it is TLB
    related, but the corruption (the reversed cacheline) is more subtle than
    a TLB bug, where we would expect it to read the wrong page entirely.
    
    Oh well, it prevents a reliable hang for me and so probably for others
    as well.

    the cdclk and HPLL like we do on newer platforms.  Ville has code for
    that in a rework branch, but until then we can fix this bug fairly
    easily.

    HID: do not bind to Microchip Pick16F1454
    
    commit a8c8316b11594e616df641b4b19ec9da732f93df upstream.
    
    The Microchip Pick16F1454 is exported as a HID device and is used by for
    example the Yepkit YKUSH three-port switchable USB hub. However, it is not an
    actual HID-device. On the Yepkit, it is used to power up/down the ports on the
    hub. The HID driver should ignore this device.

    [media] si4713: HID blacklist Si4713 USB development board
    
    commit adc232592337d3ac4c5473ba8bdaf7c202bf215d upstream.
    
    The Si4713 development board contains a Si4713 FM transmitter chip
    and is handled by the radio-usb-si4713 driver.
    The board reports itself as (10c4:8244) Cygnal Integrated Products, Inc.
    and misidentifies itself as a HID device in its USB interface descriptor.
    This patch ignores this device as an HID device and hence loads the custom driver.

    The linux kernel has supported the TiVo Slide remote control for some time, but
    does not recognize the USB ID of the newer Slide Pro. This patch adds the
    missing data structures so the newer remote will be recognized by the driver,

    Some users of xchg() don't bother using the return value, which results
    in a compiler warning like the following (from kgdb):

    This patch makes use of the same trick as we do for cmpxchg, by assigning
    the return value to a dummy variable in the xchg() macro itself.

    cpufreq: pcc: Enable autoload of pcc-cpufreq for ACPI processors
    
    commit 7e7e8fe69820c6fa31395dbbd8e348e3c69cd2a9 upstream.
    
    The pcc-cpufreq driver is not automatically loaded on systems where
    the platform's power management setting requires this driver.
    Instead, on those systems no CPU frequency driver is registered and
    active.
    
    Make the autoloading matching criteria for loading the pcc-cpufreq
    driver the same as done in acpi-cpufreq by commit c655affbd524d01
    ("ACPI / cpufreq: Add ACPI processor device IDs to acpi-cpufreq").
    
    x86 CPU frequency drivers are now typically autoloaded by specifying
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE entries and x86cpu model specific matching.
    But pcc-cpufreq was omitted when acpi-cpufreq and other drivers were
    changed to use this approach.
    
    Both acpi-cpufreq and pcc-cpufreq depend on a distinct and mutually
    exclusive set of ACPI methods which are not directly tied to specific
    processor model numbers. Both of these drivers have init routines
    which look for their required ACPI methods. As a result, only the
    appropriate driver registers as the cpu frequency driver and the other
    one ends up being unloaded.
    
    Tested on various systems where acpi-cpufreq, intel_pstate, and
    pcc-cpufreq are the expected cpu frequency drivers.

    usb: renesas_usbhs: Don't disable the pipe if Control write status stage
    
    commit 93fb9127cb63a3246b32d48fa273010764687862 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue that sometimes this controller is not able
    to complete the Control write status stage.
    
    This driver should enable DCPCTR.CCPL and PID_BUF to complete the status
    stage. However, if this driver detects the ctrl_stage interruption first
    before the control write data is received, this driver will clear the
    PID_BUF wrongly in the usbhsf_pio_try_pop(). To avoid this issue, this
    patch doesn't clear the PID_BUF in the usbhsf_pio_try_pop().
    (Since also the privious code doesn't disable the PID_BUF after a control
     transfer was finished, this patch doesn't have any side efforts.)

    Worse yet, reading the error message (the filter again) it says that
    there was no error, when there clearly was. The issue is that the
    code that checks the input does not check for balanced ops. That is,
    having an op between a closed parenthesis and the next token.
    
    This would only cause a warning, and fail out before doing any real
    harm, but it should still not caues a warning, and the error reported
    should work:
    
     # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
     # echo "((dev==1)blocks==2)" > events/ext4/ext4_truncate_exit/filter
    -bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
     # cat events/ext4/ext4_truncate_exit/filter
    ((dev==1)blocks==2)
    ^
    parse_error: Meaningless filter expression
    
    And give no kernel warning.

    crypto: caam - fix RNG buffer cache alignment
    
    commit 412c98c1bef65fe7589f1300e93735d96130307c upstream.
    
    The hwrng output buffers (2) are cast inside of a a struct (caam_rng_ctx)
    allocated in one DMA-tagged region. While the kernel's heap allocator
    should place the overall struct on a cacheline aligned boundary, the 2
    buffers contained within may not necessarily align. Consenquently, the ends
    of unaligned buffers may not fully flush, and if so, stale data will be left
    behind, resulting in small repeating patterns.
    
    This fix aligns the buffers inside the struct.
    
    Note that not all of the data inside caam_rng_ctx necessarily needs to be
    DMA-tagged, only the buffers themselves require this. However, a fix would
    incur the expense of error-handling bloat in the case of allocation failure.

    btrfs: cleanup orphans while looking up default subvolume
    
    commit 727b9784b6085c99c2f836bf4fcc2848dc9cf904 upstream.
    
    Orphans in the fs tree are cleaned up via open_ctree and subvolume
    orphans are cleaned via btrfs_lookup_dentry -- except when a default
    subvolume is in use.  The name for the default subvolume uses a manual
    lookup that doesn't trigger orphan cleanup and needs to trigger it
    manually as well. This doesn't apply to the remount case since the
    subvolumes are cleaned up by walking the root radix tree.

    cfg80211: wext: clear sinfo struct before calling driver
    
    commit 9c5a18a31b321f120efda412281bb9f610f84aa0 upstream.
    
    Until recently, mac80211 overwrote all the statistics it could
    provide when getting called, but it now relies on the struct
    having been zeroed by the caller. This was always the case in
    nl80211, but wext used a static struct which could even cause
    values from one device leak to another.
    
    Using a static struct is OK (as even documented in a comment)
    since the whole usage of this function and its return value is
    always locked under RTNL. Not clearing the struct for calling
    the driver has always been wrong though, since drivers were
    free to only fill values they could report, so calling this
    for one device and then for another would always have leaked
    values from one to the other.
    
    Fix this by initializing the structure in question before the
    driver method call.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99691

    Reproduce method (re-add a node)::
      Hot-add nodeA --> remove nodeA --> hot-add nodeA (panic)
    
    This seems an use-after-free problem, and the root cause is
    zone->wait_table was not set to *NULL* after free it in
    try_offline_node.
    
    When hot re-add a node, we will reuse the pgdat of it, so does the zone
    struct, and when add pages to the target zone, it will init the zone
    first (including the wait_table) if the zone is not initialized.  The
    judgement of zone initialized is based on zone->wait_table:
    
            static inline bool zone_is_initialized(struct zone *zone)
            {
                    return !!zone->wait_table;
            }
    
    so if we do not set the zone->wait_table to *NULL* after free it, the
    memory hotplug routine will skip the init of new zone when hot re-add
    the node, and the wait_table still points to the freed memory, then we
    will access the invalid address when trying to wake up the waiting
    people after the i/o operation with the page is done, such as mentioned
    above.

    serial: imx: Fix DMA handling for IDLE condition aborts
    
    commit 392bceedb107a3dc1d4287e63d7670d08f702feb upstream.
    
    The driver configures the IDLE condition to interrupt the SDMA engine.
    Since the SDMA UART ROM script doesn't clear the IDLE bit itself, this
    caused repeated 1-byte DMA transfers, regardless of available data in the
    RX FIFO. Also, when returning due to the IDLE condition, the UART ROM
    script already increased its counter, causing residue to be off by one.
    
    This patch clears the IDLE condition to avoid repeated 1-byte DMA transfers
    and decreases count by when the DMA transfer was aborted due to the IDLE
    condition, fixing serial transfers using DMA on i.MX6Q.

    Laptop with Turks/Thames GPU will freeze if dpm is enabled. It seems
    the SMC engine is relying on some state inside the CP engine. CP needs

    drm/i915: Fix DDC probe for passive adapters
    
    commit 3f5f1554ee715639e78d9be87623ee82772537e0 upstream.
    
    Passive DP->DVI/HDMI dongles on DP++ ports show up to the system as HDMI
    devices, as they do not have a sink device in them to respond to any AUX
    traffic. When probing these dongles over the DDC, sometimes they will
    NAK the first attempt even though the transaction is valid and they
    support the DDC protocol. The retry loop inside of
    drm_do_probe_ddc_edid() would normally catch this case and try the
    transaction again, resulting in success.
    
    That, however, was thwarted by the fix for [1]:

        drm: give up on edid retries when i2c bus is not responding
    
    This added code to exit immediately if the return code from the
    i2c_transfer function was -ENXIO in order to reduce the amount of time
    spent in waiting for unresponsive or disconnected devices. That was
    possible because the underlying i2c bit banging algorithm had retries of
    its own (which, of course, were part of the reason for the bug the
    commit fixes).

        drm/i915: use GMBUS to manage i2c links
    
    we've been flipping back and forth enabling the GMBUS transfers, but
    we've settled since then. The GMBUS implementation does not do any
    retries, however, bailing out of the drm_do_probe_ddc_edid() retry loop
    on first encounter of -ENXIO. This, combined with Eugeni's commit, broke
    the retry on -ENXIO.
    
    Retry GMBUS once on -ENXIO on first message to mitigate the issues with
    passive adapters.

    According to the HSW b-spec we need to try clock divisors of 63
    and 72, each 3 or more times, when attempting DP AUX channel
    communication on a server chipset.  This actually wasn't happening
    due to a short-circuit that only checked the DP_AUX_CH_CTL_DONE bit
    in status rather than checking that the operation was done and
    that DP_AUX_CH_CTL_TIME_OUT_ERROR was not set.
    
    [v2] Implemented alternate solution suggested by Jani Nikula.

    pata_octeon_cf: fix broken build
    
    commit 4710f2facb5c68d629015747bd09b37203e0d137 upstream.
    
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is referring to wrong driver's table and breaks the
    build. Fix that.

    ozwpan: unchecked signed subtraction leads to DoS
    
    commit 9a59029bc218b48eff8b5d4dde5662fd79d3e1a8 upstream.
    
    The subtraction here was using a signed integer and did not have any
    bounds checking at all. This commit adds proper bounds checking, made
    easy by use of an unsigned integer. This way, a single packet won't be
    able to remotely trigger a massive loop, locking up the system for a
    considerable amount of time. A PoC follows below, which requires
    ozprotocol.h from this module.

    ozwpan: divide-by-zero leading to panic
    
    commit 04bf464a5dfd9ade0dda918e44366c2c61fce80b upstream.
    
    A network supplied parameter was not checked before division, leading to
    a divide-by-zero. Since this happens in the softirq path, it leads to a
    crash. A PoC follows below, which requires the ozprotocol.h file from
    this module.

    ozwpan: Use proper check to prevent heap overflow
    
    commit d114b9fe78c8d6fc6e70808c2092aa307c36dc8e upstream.
    
    Since elt->length is a u8, we can make this variable a u8. Then we can
    do proper bounds checking more easily. Without this, a potentially
    negative value is passed to the memcpy inside oz_hcd_get_desc_cnf,
    resulting in a remotely exploitable heap overflow with network
    supplied data.
    
    This could result in remote code execution. A PoC which obtains DoS
    follows below. It requires the ozprotocol.h file from this module.

    MIPS: Fix enabling of DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
    
    commit 5f35b9cd553fd64415b563497d05a563c988dbd6 upstream.
    
    Commit 334c86c494b9 ("MIPS: IRQ: Add stackoverflow detection") added
    kernel stack overflow detection, however it only enabled it conditional
    upon the preprocessor definition DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW, which is never
    actually defined. The Kconfig option is called DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW,
    which manifests to the preprocessor as CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW, so
    switch it to using that definition instead.

    x86/asm/irq: Stop relying on magic JMP behavior for early_idt_handlers
    
    commit 425be5679fd292a3c36cb1fe423086708a99f11a upstream.
    
    The early_idt_handlers asm code generates an array of entry
    points spaced nine bytes apart.  It's not really clear from that
    code or from the places that reference it what's going on, and
    the code only works in the first place because GAS never
    generates two-byte JMP instructions when jumping to global
    labels.
    
    Clean up the code to generate the correct array stride (member size)
    explicitly. This should be considerably more robust against
    screw-ups, as GAS will warn if a .fill directive has a negative
    count.  Using '. =' to advance would have been even more robust
    (it would generate an actual error if it tried to move
    backwards), but it would pad with nulls, confusing anyone who
    tries to disassemble the code.  The new scheme should be much
    clearer to future readers.
    
    While we're at it, improve the comments and rename the array and
    common code.
    
    Binutils may start relaxing jumps to non-weak labels.  If so,
    this change will fix our build, and we may need to backport this
    change.

    Neil sees this in his tests and it also triggers on pmem driver unbind

    for incorrect usage of mutex_lock() in this path: 2da78092dda1 "block:
    Fix dev_t minor allocation lifetime".  Both this and 2da78092dda1 are
    candidates for -stable.

    commit c2a8b623a089d52c199e305e7905829907db8ec8 upstream.
    
    We unfortunately can't use ~0UL for the scan mask to indicate that the
    only valid scan mask is all channels selected. The IIO core needs the exact
    mask to work correctly and not a super-set of it. So calculate the masked
    based on the channels that are available for a particular device.

    commit 7323d59862802ca109451eeda9777024a7625509 upstream.
    
    Previously, the two voltage channels had the same ID, which didn't cause
    conflicts in sysfs only because one channel is named and the other isn't;
    this is still violating the spec though, two indexed channels should never
    have the same index.
