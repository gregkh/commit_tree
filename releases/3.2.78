    sched: fix __sched_setscheduler() vs load balancing race
    
    __sched_setscheduler() may release rq->lock in pull_rt_task() as a task is
    being changed rt -> fair class.  load balancing may sneak in, move the task
    behind __sched_setscheduler()'s back, which explodes in switched_to_fair()
    when the passed but no longer valid rq is used.  Tell can_migrate_task() to
    say no if ->pi_lock is held.
    
    @stable: Kernels that predate SCHED_DEADLINE can use this simple (and tested)
    check in lieu of backport of the full 18 patch mainline treatment.

    pipe: Fix buffer offset after partially failed read
    
    Quoting the RHEL advisory:
    
    > It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 incorrectly kept buffer
    > offset and buffer length in sync on a failed atomic read, potentially
    > resulting in a pipe buffer state corruption. A local, unprivileged user
    > could use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user
    > space. (CVE-2016-0774, Moderate)
    
    The same flawed fix was applied to stable branches from 2.6.32.y to
    3.14.y inclusive, and I was able to reproduce the issue on 3.2.y.
    We need to give pipe_iov_copy_to_user() a separate offset variable
    and only update the buffer offset if it succeeds.

    pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes
    
    commit 759c01142a5d0f364a462346168a56de28a80f52 upstream.
    
    On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
    OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
    typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).

    unix: correctly track in-flight fds in sending process user_struct
    
    commit 415e3d3e90ce9e18727e8843ae343eda5a58fad6 upstream.
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag incorrectly accounted the number
    of in-flight fds over a unix domain socket to the original opener
    of the file-descriptor. This allows another process to arbitrary
    deplete the original file-openers resource limit for the maximum of
    open files. Instead the sending processes and its struct cred should
    be credited.
    
    To do so, we add a reference counted struct user_struct pointer to the
    scm_fp_list and use it to account for the number of inflight unix fds.

    unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets
    
    commit 712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593 upstream.
    
    It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
    the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
    to keep the process' fd count low.
    
    This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
    in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
    more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.

    btrfs: properly set the termination value of ctx->pos in readdir
    
    commit bc4ef7592f657ae81b017207a1098817126ad4cb upstream.
    
    The value of ctx->pos in the last readdir call is supposed to be set to
    INT_MAX due to 32bit compatibility, unless 'pos' is intentially set to a
    larger value, then it's LLONG_MAX.
    
    There's a report from PaX SIZE_OVERFLOW plugin that "ctx->pos++"
    overflows (https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4284), on a
    64bit arch, where the value is 0x7fffffffffffffff ie. LLONG_MAX before
    the increment.
    
    We can get to that situation like that:
    
    * emit all regular readdir entries
    * still in the same call to readdir, bump the last pos to INT_MAX
    * next call to readdir will not emit any entries, but will reach the
      bump code again, finds pos to be INT_MAX and sets it to LLONG_MAX
    
    Normally this is not a problem, but if we call readdir again, we'll find
    'pos' set to LLONG_MAX and the unconditional increment will overflow.
    
    The report from Victor at
    (http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/49500) with debugging
    print shows that pattern:
    
     Overflow: e

    The jump from 7fffffff to 7fffffffffffffff happens when new dir entries
    are not yet synced and are processed from the delayed list. Then the code
    could go to the bump section again even though it might not emit any new
    dir entries from the delayed list.
    
    The fix avoids entering the "bump" section again once we've finished
    emitting the entries, both for synced and delayed entries.

    commit e972c37459c813190461dabfeaac228e00aae259 upstream.
    
    Since the dawn of time the ICST code has only supported divide
    by one or hang in an eternal loop. Luckily we were always dividing
    by one because the reference frequency for the systems using
    the ICSTs is 24MHz and the [min,max] values for the PLL input
    if [10,320] MHz for ICST307 and [6,200] for ICST525, so the loop
    will always terminate immediately without assigning any divisor
    for the reference frequency.
    
    But for the code to make sense, let's insert the missing i++

    ALSA: timer: Fix race between stop and interrupt
    
    commit ed8b1d6d2c741ab26d60d499d7fbb7ac801f0f51 upstream.
    
    A slave timer element also unlinks at snd_timer_stop() but it takes
    only slave_active_lock.  When a slave is assigned to a master,
    however, this may become a race against the master's interrupt
    handling, eventually resulting in a list corruption.  The actual bug
    could be seen with a syzkaller fuzzer test case in BugLink below.
    
    As a fix, we need to take timeri->timer->lock when timer isn't NULL,
    i.e. assigned to a master, while the assignment to a master itself is
    protected by slave_active_lock.

    ARM: 8517/1: ICST: avoid arithmetic overflow in icst_hz()
    
    commit 5070fb14a0154f075c8b418e5bc58a620ae85a45 upstream.
    
    When trying to set the ICST 307 clock to 25174000 Hz I ran into
    this arithmetic error: the icst_hz_to_vco() correctly figure out
    DIVIDE=2, RDW=100 and VDW=99 yielding a frequency of
    25174000 Hz out of the VCO. (I replicated the icst_hz() function
    in a spreadsheet to verify this.)
    
    However, when I called icst_hz() on these VCO settings it would
    instead return 4122709 Hz. This causes an error in the common
    clock driver for ICST as the common clock framework will call
    .round_rate() on the clock which will utilize icst_hz_to_vco()
    followed by icst_hz() suggesting the erroneous frequency, and
    then the clock gets set to this.
    
    The error did not manifest in the old clock framework since
    this high frequency was only used by the CLCD, which calls
    clk_set_rate() without first calling clk_round_rate() and since
    the old clock framework would not call clk_round_rate() before
    setting the frequency, the correct values propagated into
    the VCO.
    
    After some experimenting I figured out that it was due to a simple
    arithmetic overflow: the divisor for 24Mhz reference frequency
    as reference becomes 24000000*2*(99+8)=0x132212400 and the "1"
    in bit 32 overflows and is lost.
    
    But introducing an explicit 64-by-32 bit do_div() and casting
    the divisor into (u64) we get the right frequency back, and the
    right frequency gets set.
    
    Tested on the ARM Versatile.

    ALSA: dummy: Implement timer backend switching more safely
    
    commit ddce57a6f0a2d8d1bfacfa77f06043bc760403c2 upstream.
    
    Currently the selected timer backend is referred at any moment from
    the running PCM callbacks.  When the backend is switched, it's
    possible to lead to inconsistency from the running backend.  This was
    pointed by syzkaller fuzzer, and the commit [7ee96216c31a: ALSA:
    dummy: Disable switching timer backend via sysfs] disabled the dynamic
    switching for avoiding the crash.
    
    This patch improves the handling of timer backend switching.  It keeps
    the reference to the selected backend during the whole operation of an
    opened stream so that it won't be changed by other streams.
    
    Together with this change, the hrtimer parameter is reenabled as
    writable now.
    
    NOTE: this patch also turned out to fix the still remaining race.
    Namely, ops was still replaced dynamically at dummy_pcm_open:
    
      static int dummy_pcm_open(struct snd_pcm_substream *substream)
      {
      ....
              dummy->timer_ops = &dummy_systimer_ops;
              if (hrtimer)
                      dummy->timer_ops = &dummy_hrtimer_ops;
    
    Since dummy->timer_ops is common among all streams, and when the
    replacement happens during accesses of other streams, it may lead to a
    crash.  This was actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer and KASAN.
    
    This patch rewrites the code not to use the ops shared by all streams
    any longer, too.

    klist: fix starting point removed bug in klist iterators
    
    commit 00cd29b799e3449f0c68b1cc77cd4a5f95b42d17 upstream.
    
    The starting node for a klist iteration is often passed in from
    somewhere way above the klist infrastructure, meaning there's no
    guarantee the node is still on the list.  We've seen this in SCSI where
    we use bus_find_device() to iterate through a list of devices.  In the
    face of heavy hotplug activity, the last device returned by
    bus_find_device() can be removed before the next call.  This leads to

    And an eventual crash. It can actually occur in any hotplug system
    which has a device finder and a starting device.
    
    We can fix this globally by making sure the starting node for
    klist_iter_init_node() is actually a member of the list before using it
    (and by starting from the beginning if it isn't).

    crypto: algif_skcipher - Do not dereference ctx without socket lock
    
    commit 6454c2b83f719057069777132b13949e4c6b6350 upstream.
    
    Any access to non-constant bits of the private context must be
    done under the socket lock, in particular, this includes ctx->req.
    
    This patch moves such accesses under the lock, and fetches the
    tfm from the parent socket which is guaranteed to be constant,
    rather than from ctx->req.

    crypto: user - lock crypto_alg_list on alg dump
    
    commit 63e41ebc6630f39422d87f8a4bade1e793f37a01 upstream.
    
    We miss to take the crypto_alg_sem semaphore when traversing the

    To trigger the race run the following loops simultaneously for a while:
      $ while : ; do modprobe aesni-intel; rmmod aesni-intel; done
      $ while : ; do crconf show all > /dev/null; done
    
    Fix the race by taking the crypto_alg_sem read lock, thereby preventing
    crypto_unregister_alg() from modifying the algorithm list during the

    mm, vmstat: fix wrong WQ sleep when memory reclaim doesn't make any progress
    
    commit 564e81a57f9788b1475127012e0fd44e9049e342 upstream.
    
    Jan Stancek has reported that system occasionally hanging after "oom01"
    testcase from LTP triggers OOM.  Guessing from a result that there is a
    kworker thread doing memory allocation and the values between "Node 0
    Normal free:" and "Node 0 Normal:" differs when hanging, vmstat is not
    up-to-date for some reason.
    
    According to commit 373ccbe59270 ("mm, vmstat: allow WQ concurrency to
    discover memory reclaim doesn't make any progress"), it meant to force
    the kworker thread to take a short sleep, but it by error used
    schedule_timeout(1).  We missed that schedule_timeout() in state
    TASK_RUNNING doesn't do anything.
    
    Fix it by using schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) which forces the
    kworker thread to take a short sleep in order to make sure that vmstat
    is up-to-date.

    scsi_dh_rdac: always retry MODE SELECT on command lock violation
    
    commit d2d06d4fe0f2cc2df9b17fefec96e6e1a1271d91 upstream.
    
    If MODE SELECT returns with sense '05/91/36' (command lock violation)
    it should always be retried without counting the number of retries.
    During an HBA upgrade or similar circumstances one might see a flood
    of MODE SELECT command from various HBAs, which will easily trigger
    the sense code and exceed the retry count.

    ALSA: timer: Fix leftover link at closing
    
    commit 094fd3be87b0f102589e2d5c3fa5d06b7e20496d upstream.
    
    In ALSA timer core, the active timer instance is managed in
    active_list linked list.  Each element is added / removed dynamically
    at timer start, stop and in timer interrupt.  The problem is that
    snd_timer_interrupt() has a thinko and leaves the element in
    active_list when it's the last opened element.  This eventually leads
    to list corruption or use-after-free error.
    
    This hasn't been revealed because we used to delete the list forcibly
    in snd_timer_stop() in the past.  However, the recent fix avoids the
    double-stop behavior (in commit [f784beb75ce8: ALSA: timer: Fix link
    corruption due to double start or stop]), and this leak hits reality.
    
    This patch fixes the link management in snd_timer_interrupt().  Now it
    simply unlinks no matter which stream is.

    tda1004x: only update the frontend properties if locked
    
    commit e8beb02343e7582980c6705816cd957cf4f74c7a upstream.
    
    The tda1004x was updating the properties cache before locking.
    If the device is not locked, the data at the registers are just
    random values with no real meaning.
    
    This caused the driver to fail with libdvbv5, as such library
    calls GET_PROPERTY from time to time, in order to return the
    DVB stats.

    xhci: Fix list corruption in urb dequeue at host removal
    
    commit 5c82171167adb8e4ac77b91a42cd49fb211a81a0 upstream.
    
    xhci driver frees data for all devices, both usb2 and and usb3 the
    first time usb_remove_hcd() is called, including td_list and and xhci_ring
    structures.
    
    When usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus it
    will try to dequeue all pending urbs, and touches td_list which is already
    freed for that endpoint.

    Revert "xhci: don't finish a TD if we get a short-transfer event mid TD"
    
    commit a6835090716a85f2297668ba593bd00e1051e662 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit e210c422b6fd ("xhci: don't finish a TD if we get a
    short transfer event mid TD")
    
    Turns out that most host controllers do not follow the xHCI specs and never
    send the second event for the last TRB in the TD if there was a short event
    mid-TD.
    
    Returning the URB directly after the first short-transfer event is far
    better than never returning the URB. (class drivers usually timeout
    after 30sec). For the hosts that do send the second event we will go
    back to treating it as misplaced event and print an error message for it.
    
    The origial patch was sent to stable kernels and needs to be reverted from
    there as well

    ALSA: seq: Fix lockdep warnings due to double mutex locks
    
    commit 7f0973e973cd74aa40747c9d38844560cd184ee8 upstream.
    
    The port subscription code uses double mutex locks for source and
    destination ports, and this may become racy once when wrongly set up.
    It leads to lockdep warning splat, typically triggered by fuzzer like
    syzkaller, although the actual deadlock hasn't been seen, so far.
    
    This patch simplifies the handling by reducing to two single locks, so
    that no lockdep warning will be trigger any longer.
    
    By splitting to two actions, a still-in-progress element shall be
    added in one list while handling another.  For ignoring this element,
    a new check is added in deliver_to_subscribers().
    
    Along with it, the code to add/remove the subscribers list element was
    cleaned up and refactored.

    ALSA: rawmidi: Fix race at copying & updating the position
    
    commit 81f577542af15640cbcb6ef68baa4caa610cbbfc upstream.
    
    The rawmidi read and write functions manage runtime stream status
    such as runtime->appl_ptr and runtime->avail.  These point where to
    copy the new data and how many bytes have been copied (or to be
    read).  The problem is that rawmidi read/write call copy_from_user()
    or copy_to_user(), and the runtime spinlock is temporarily unlocked
    and relocked while copying user-space.  Since the current code
    advances and updates the runtime status after the spin unlock/relock,
    the copy and the update may be asynchronous, and eventually
    runtime->avail might go to a negative value when many concurrent
    accesses are done.  This may lead to memory corruption in the end.
    
    For fixing this race, in this patch, the status update code is
    performed in the same lock before the temporary unlock.  Also, the
    spinlock is now taken more widely in snd_rawmidi_kernel_read1() for
    protecting more properly during the whole operation.

    Also a similar warning is found but in another path:

    In the former case, the reason is that virmidi has an open code
    calling snd_rawmidi_transmit_ack() with the value calculated outside
    the spinlock.   We may use snd_rawmidi_transmit() in a loop just for
    consuming the input data, but even there, there is a race between
    snd_rawmidi_transmit_peek() and snd_rawmidi_tranmit_ack().
    
    Similarly in the latter case, it calls snd_rawmidi_transmit_peek() and
    snd_rawmidi_tranmit_ack() separately without protection, so they are
    racy as well.
    
    The patch tries to address these issues by the following ways:
    - Introduce the unlocked versions of snd_rawmidi_transmit_peek() and
      snd_rawmidi_transmit_ack() to be called inside the explicit lock.
    - Rewrite snd_rawmidi_transmit() to be race-free (the former case).
    - Make the split calls (the latter case) protected in the rawmidi spin
      lock.

    libata: fix sff host state machine locking while polling
    
    commit 8eee1d3ed5b6fc8e14389567c9a6f53f82bb7224 upstream.
    
    The bulk of ATA host state machine is implemented by
    ata_sff_hsm_move().  The function is called from either the interrupt
    handler or, if polling, a work item.  Unlike from the interrupt path,
    the polling path calls the function without holding the host lock and
    ata_sff_hsm_move() selectively grabs the lock.
    
    This is completely broken.  If an IRQ triggers while polling is in
    progress, the two can easily race and end up accessing the hardware
    and updating state machine state at the same time.  This can put the
    state machine in an illegal state and lead to a crash like the
    following.

    ALSA: timer: Fix link corruption due to double start or stop
    
    commit f784beb75ce82f4136f8a0960d3ee872f7109e09 upstream.
    
    Although ALSA timer code got hardening for races, it still causes
    use-after-free error.  This is however rather a corrupted linked list,
    not actually the concurrent accesses.  Namely, when timer start is
    triggered twice, list_add_tail() is called twice, too.  This ends
    up with the link corruption and triggers KASAN error.
    
    The simplest fix would be replacing list_add_tail() with
    list_move_tail(), but fundamentally it's the problem that we don't
    check the double start/stop correctly.  So, the right fix here is to
    add the proper checks to snd_timer_start() and snd_timer_stop() (and
    their variants).

    ALSA: seq: Fix yet another races among ALSA timer accesses
    
    commit 2cdc7b636d55cbcf42e1e6c8accd85e62d3e9ae8 upstream.
    
    ALSA sequencer may open/close and control ALSA timer instance
    dynamically either via sequencer events or direct ioctls.  These are
    done mostly asynchronously, and it may call still some timer action
    like snd_timer_start() while another is calling snd_timer_close().
    Since the instance gets removed by snd_timer_close(), it may lead to
    a use-after-free.
    
    This patch tries to address such a race by protecting each
    snd_timer_*() call via the existing spinlock and also by avoiding the
    access to timer during close call.

    ALSA: pcm: Fix potential deadlock in OSS emulation
    
    commit b248371628aad599a48540962f6b85a21a8a0c3f upstream.
    
    There are potential deadlocks in PCM OSS emulation code while
    accessing read/write and mmap concurrently.  This comes from the
    infamous mmap_sem usage in copy_from/to_user().  Namely,
    
       snd_pcm_oss_write() ->
         &runtime->oss.params_lock ->
            copy_to_user() ->
              &mm->mmap_sem
      mmap() ->
        &mm->mmap_sem ->
          snd_pcm_oss_mmap() ->
            &runtime->oss.params_lock
    
    Since we can't avoid taking params_lock from mmap code path, use
    trylock variant and aborts with -EAGAIN as a workaround of this AB/BA
    deadlock.

    x86/mm/pat: Avoid truncation when converting cpa->numpages to address
    
    commit 742563777e8da62197d6cb4b99f4027f59454735 upstream.
    
    There are a couple of nasty truncation bugs lurking in the pageattr
    code that can be triggered when mapping EFI regions, e.g. when we pass
    a cpa->pgd pointer. Because cpa->numpages is a 32-bit value, shifting
    left by PAGE_SHIFT will truncate the resultant address to 32-bits.
    
    Viorel-Cătălin managed to trigger this bug on his Dell machine that
    provides a ~5GB EFI region which requires 1236992 pages to be mapped.
    When calling populate_pud() the end of the region gets calculated
    incorrectly in the following buggy expression,
    
      end = start + (cpa->numpages << PAGE_SHIFT);
    
    And only 188416 pages are mapped. Next, populate_pud() gets invoked
    for a second time because of the loop in __change_page_attr_set_clr(),
    only this time no pages get mapped because shifting the remaining
    number of pages (1048576) by PAGE_SHIFT is zero. At which point the
    loop in __change_page_attr_set_clr() spins forever because we fail to
    map progress.
    
    Hitting this bug depends very much on the virtual address we pick to
    map the large region at and how many pages we map on the initial run
    through the loop. This explains why this issue was only recently hit
    with the introduction of commit
    
      a5caa209ba9c ("x86/efi: Fix boot crash by mapping EFI memmap
       entries bottom-up at runtime, instead of top-down")
    
    It's interesting to note that safe uses of cpa->numpages do exist in
    the pageattr code. If instead of shifting ->numpages we multiply by
    PAGE_SIZE, no truncation occurs because PAGE_SIZE is a UL value, and
    so the result is unsigned long.
    
    To avoid surprises when users try to convert very large cpa->numpages
    values to addresses, change the data type from 'int' to 'unsigned
    long', thereby making it suitable for shifting by PAGE_SHIFT without
    any type casting.
    
    The alternative would be to make liberal use of casting, but that is
    far more likely to cause problems in the future when someone adds more
    code and fails to cast properly; this bug was difficult enough to
    track down in the first place.

    ALSA: dummy: Disable switching timer backend via sysfs
    
    commit 7ee96216c31aabe1eb42fb91ff50dae9fcd014b2 upstream.
    
    ALSA dummy driver can switch the timer backend between system timer
    and hrtimer via its hrtimer module option.  This can be also switched
    dynamically via sysfs, but it may lead to a memory corruption when
    switching is done while a PCM stream is running; the stream instance
    for the newly switched timer method tries to access the memory that
    was allocated by another timer method although the sizes differ.
    
    As the simplest fix, this patch just disables the switch via sysfs by
    dropping the writable bit.

    tty: Fix unsafe ldisc reference via ioctl(TIOCGETD)
    
    commit 5c17c861a357e9458001f021a7afa7aab9937439 upstream.
    
    ioctl(TIOCGETD) retrieves the line discipline id directly from the
    ldisc because the line discipline id (c_line) in termios is untrustworthy;
    userspace may have set termios via ioctl(TCSETS*) without actually
    changing the line discipline via ioctl(TIOCSETD).
    
    However, directly accessing the current ldisc via tty->ldisc is
    unsafe; the ldisc ptr dereferenced may be stale if the line discipline
    is changing via ioctl(TIOCSETD) or hangup.
    
    Wait for the line discipline reference (just like read() or write())
    to retrieve the "current" line discipline id.

    SCSI: fix crashes in sd and sr runtime PM
    
    commit 13b4389143413a1f18127c07f72c74cad5b563e8 upstream.
    
    Runtime suspend during driver probe and removal can cause problems.
    The driver's runtime_suspend or runtime_resume callbacks may invoked
    before the driver has finished binding to the device or after the
    driver has unbound from the device.
    
    This problem shows up with the sd and sr drivers, and can cause disk
    or CD/DVD drives to become unusable as a result.  The fix is simple.
    The drivers store a pointer to the scsi_disk or scsi_cd structure as
    their private device data when probing is finished, so we simply have
    to be sure to clear the private data during removal and test it during
    runtime suspend/resume.

    PCI/AER: Flush workqueue on device remove to avoid use-after-free
    
    commit 4ae2182b1e3407de369f8c5d799543b7db74221b upstream.
    
    A Root Port's AER structure (rpc) contains a queue of events.  aer_irq()
    enqueues AER status information and schedules aer_isr() to dequeue and
    process it.  When we remove a device, aer_remove() waits for the queue to
    be empty, then frees the rpc struct.
    
    But aer_isr() references the rpc struct after dequeueing and possibly
    emptying the queue, which can cause a use-after-free error as in the
    following scenario with two threads, aer_isr() on the left and a
    concurrent aer_remove() on the right:
    
      Thread A                      Thread B
      --------                      --------
      aer_irq():
        rpc->prod_idx++
                                    aer_remove():
                                      wait_event(rpc->prod_idx == rpc->cons_idx)
                                      # now blocked until queue becomes empty
      aer_isr():                      # ...
        rpc->cons_idx++               # unblocked because queue is now empty
        ...                           kfree(rpc)
        mutex_unlock(&rpc->rpc_mutex)
    
    To prevent this problem, use flush_work() to wait until the last scheduled
    instance of aer_isr() has completed before freeing the rpc struct in
    aer_remove().
    
    I reproduced this use-after-free by flashing a device FPGA and
    re-enumerating the bus to find the new device.  With SLUB debug, this
    crashes with 0x6b bytes (POISON_FREE, the use-after-free magic number) in
    GPR25:

    ALSA: seq: Degrade the error message for too many opens
    
    commit da10816e3d923565b470fec78a674baba794ed33 upstream.
    
    ALSA OSS sequencer spews a kernel error message ("ALSA: seq_oss: too
    many applications") when user-space tries to open more than the
    limit.  This means that it can easily fill the log buffer.
    
    Since it's merely a normal error, it's safe to suppress it via
    pr_debug() instead.

    pptp: fix illegal memory access caused by multiple bind()s
    
    commit 9a368aff9cb370298fa02feeffa861f2db497c18 upstream.
    
    Several times already this has been reported as kasan reports caused by
    syzkaller and trinity and people always looked at RCU races, but it is
    much more simple. :)
    
    In case we bind a pptp socket multiple times, we simply add it to
    the callid_sock list but don't remove the old binding. Thus the old
    socket stays in the bucket with unused call_id indexes and doesn't get
    cleaned up. This causes various forms of kasan reports which were hard
    to pinpoint.
    
    Simply don't allow multiple binds and correct error handling in
    pptp_bind. Also keep sk_state bits in place in pptp_connect.

    timerfd: Handle relative timers with CONFIG_TIME_LOW_RES proper
    
    commit b62526ed11a1fe3861ab98d40b7fdab8981d788a upstream.
    
    Helge reported that a relative timer can return a remaining time larger than
    the programmed relative time on parisc and other architectures which have
    CONFIG_TIME_LOW_RES set. This happens because we add a jiffie to the resulting
    expiry time to prevent short timeouts.
    
    Use the new function hrtimer_expires_remaining_adjusted() to calculate the
    remaining time. It takes that extra added time into account for relative
    timers.

    hrtimer: Handle remaining time proper for TIME_LOW_RES
    
    commit 203cbf77de59fc8f13502dcfd11350c6d4a5c95f upstream.
    
    If CONFIG_TIME_LOW_RES is enabled we add a jiffie to the relative timeout to
    prevent short sleeps, but we do not account for that in interfaces which
    retrieve the remaining time.
    
    Helge observed that timerfd can return a remaining time larger than the
    relative timeout. That's not expected and breaks userland test programs.
    
    Store the information that the timer was armed relative and provide functions
    to adjust the remaining time. To avoid bloating the hrtimer struct make state
    a u8, which as a bonus results in better code on x86 at least.
