    ipv6: remove extra dev_hold() for fallback tunnels
    
    commit 0d7a7b2014b1a499a0fe24c9f3063d7856b5aaaf upstream.
    
    My previous commits added a dev_hold() in tunnels ndo_init(),
    but forgot to remove it from special functions setting up fallback tunnels.
    
    Fallback tunnels do call their respective ndo_init()
    
    This leads to various reports like :
    
    unregister_netdevice: waiting for ip6gre0 to become free. Usage count = 2

    xhci: Do not use GFP_KERNEL in (potentially) atomic context
    
    commit dda32c00c9a0fa103b5d54ef72c477b7aa993679 upstream.
    
    'xhci_urb_enqueue()' is passed a 'mem_flags' argument, because "URBs may be
    submitted in interrupt context" (see comment related to 'usb_submit_urb()'
    in 'drivers/usb/core/urb.c')
    
    So this flag should be used in all the calling chain.
    Up to now, 'xhci_check_maxpacket()' which is only called from
    'xhci_urb_enqueue()', uses GFP_KERNEL.
    
    Be safe and pass the mem_flags to this function as well.

    ip6_tunnel: sit: proper dev_{hold|put} in ndo_[un]init methods
    
    commit 48bb5697269a7cbe5194dbb044dc38c517e34c58 upstream.
    
    Same reasons than for the previous commits :
    6289a98f0817 ("sit: proper dev_{hold|put} in ndo_[un]init methods")
    40cb881b5aaa ("ip6_vti: proper dev_{hold|put} in ndo_[un]init methods")
    7f700334be9a ("ip6_gre: proper dev_{hold|put} in ndo_[un]init methods")
    
    After adopting CONFIG_PCPU_DEV_REFCNT=n option, syzbot was able to trigger
    a warning [1]
    
    Issue here is that:
    
    - all dev_put() should be paired with a corresponding prior dev_hold().
    
    - A driver doing a dev_put() in its ndo_uninit() MUST also
      do a dev_hold() in its ndo_init(), only when ndo_init()
      is returning 0.
    
    Otherwise, register_netdevice() would call ndo_uninit()
    in its error path and release a refcount too soon.

    ALSA: hda: generic: change the DAC ctl name for LO+SPK or LO+HP
    
    [ Upstream commit f48652bbe3ae62ba2835a396b7e01f063e51c4cd ]
    
    Without this change, the DAC ctl's name could be changed only when
    the machine has both Speaker and Headphone, but we met some machines
    which only has Lineout and Headhpone, and the Lineout and Headphone
    share the Audio Mixer0 and DAC0, the ctl's name is set to "Front".
    
    On most of machines, the "Front" is used for Speaker only or Lineout
    only, but on this machine it is shared by Lineout and Headphone,
    This introduces an issue in the pipewire and pulseaudio, suppose users
    want the Headphone to be on and the Speaker/Lineout to be off, they
    could turn off the "Front", this works on most of the machines, but on
    this machine, the "Front" couldn't be turned off otherwise the
    headphone will be off too. Here we do some change to let the ctl's
    name change to "Headphone+LO" on this machine, and pipewire and
    pulseaudio already could handle "Headphone+LO" and "Speaker+LO".

    indicating that the UML function openpty_cb() calls openpty(),
    which internally calls __getgrnam_r(), which causes the nsswitch
    machinery to get started.
    
    This loads, through lots of indirection that I snipped, the
    libcom_err.so.2 library, which (in an unknown function, "??")
    calls sem_init().
    
    Now, of course it wants to get libpthread's sem_init(), since
    it's linked against libpthread. However, the dynamic linker
    looks up that symbol against the binary first, and gets the
    kernel's sem_init().
    
    Hajime Tazaki noted that "objcopy -L" can localize a symbol,
    so the dynamic linker wouldn't do the lookup this way. I tried,
    but for some reason that didn't seem to work.
    
    Doing the same thing in the linker script instead does seem to
    work, though I cannot entirely explain - it *also* works if I
    just add "VERSION { { global: *; }; }" instead, indicating that
    something else is happening that I don't really understand. It
    may be that explicitly doing that marks them with some kind of
    empty version, and that's different from the default.
    
    Explicitly marking them with a version breaks kallsyms, so that
    doesn't seem to be possible.
    
    Marking all the symbols as local seems correct, and does seem
    to address the issue, so do that. Also do it for static link,
    nsswitch libraries could still be loaded there.

    Input: silead - add workaround for x86 BIOS-es which bring the chip up in a stuck state
    
    [ Upstream commit e479187748a8f151a85116a7091c599b121fdea5 ]
    
    Some buggy BIOS-es bring up the touchscreen-controller in a stuck
    state where it blocks the I2C bus. Specifically this happens on
    the Jumper EZpad 7 tablet model.
    
    After much poking at this problem I have found that the following steps
    are necessary to unstuck the chip / bus:
    
    1. Turn off the Silead chip.
    2. Try to do an I2C transfer with the chip, this will fail in response to
       which the I2C-bus-driver will call: i2c_recover_bus() which will unstuck
       the I2C-bus. Note the unstuck-ing of the I2C bus only works if we first
       drop the chip of the bus by turning it off.
    3. Turn the chip back on.
    
    On the x86/ACPI systems were this problem is seen, step 1. and 3. require
    making ACPI calls and dealing with ACPI Power Resources. This commit adds
    a workaround which runtime-suspends the chip to turn it off, leaving it up
    to the ACPI subsystem to deal with all the ACPI specific details.
    
    There is no good way to detect this bug, so the workaround gets activated
    by a new "silead,stuck-controller-bug" boolean device-property. Since this
    is only used on x86/ACPI, this will be set by model specific device-props
    set by drivers/platform/x86/touchscreen_dmi.c. Therefor this new
    device-property is not documented in the DT-bindings.
    
    Dmesg will contain the following messages on systems where the workaround
    is activated:

    ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Fix reference count leak in enable_slot()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3bbfd319034ddce59e023837a4aa11439460509b ]
    
    In enable_slot(), if pci_get_slot() returns NULL, we clear the SLOT_ENABLED
    flag. When pci_get_slot() finds a device, it increments the device's
    reference count.  In this case, we did not call pci_dev_put() to decrement
    the reference count, so the memory of the device (struct pci_dev type) will
    eventually leak.
    
    Call pci_dev_put() to decrement its reference count when pci_get_slot()
    returns a PCI device.

    clk: exynos7: Mark aclk_fsys1_200 as critical
    
    commit 34138a59b92c1a30649a18ec442d2e61f3bc34dd upstream.
    
    This clock must be always enabled to allow access to any registers in
    fsys1 CMU. Until proper solution based on runtime PM is applied
    (similar to what was done for Exynos5433), mark that clock as critical
    so it won't be disabled.
    
    It was observed on Samsung Galaxy S6 device (based on Exynos7420), where
    UFS module is probed before pmic used to power that device.
    In this case defer probe was happening and that clock was disabled by
    UFS driver, causing whole boot to hang on next CMU access.

    netfilter: conntrack: Make global sysctls readonly in non-init netns
    
    commit 2671fa4dc0109d3fb581bc3078fdf17b5d9080f6 upstream.
    
    These sysctls point to global variables:
    - NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX (&nf_conntrack_max)
    - NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX (&nf_ct_expect_max)
    - NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS (&nf_conntrack_htable_size_user)
    
    Because their data pointers are not updated to point to per-netns
    structures, they must be marked read-only in a non-init_net ns.
    Otherwise, changes in any net namespace are reflected in (leaked into)
    all other net namespaces. This problem has existed since the
    introduction of net namespaces.
    
    The current logic marks them read-only only if the net namespace is
    owned by an unprivileged user (other than init_user_ns).
    
    Commit d0febd81ae77 ("netfilter: conntrack: re-visit sysctls in
    unprivileged namespaces") "exposes all sysctls even if the namespace is
    unpriviliged." Since we need to mark them readonly in any case, we can
    forego the unprivileged user check altogether.

    dm ioctl: fix out of bounds array access when no devices
    
    commit 4edbe1d7bcffcd6269f3b5eb63f710393ff2ec7a upstream.
    
    If there are not any dm devices, we need to zero the "dev" argument in
    the first structure dm_name_list. However, this can cause out of
    bounds write, because the "needed" variable is zero and len may be
    less than eight.

    too small to hold the "nl->dev" value.

    MIPS: Avoid handcoded DIVU in `__div64_32' altogether
    
    commit 25ab14cbe9d1b66fda44c71a2db7582a31b6f5cd upstream.
    
    Remove the inline asm with a DIVU instruction from `__div64_32' and use
    plain C code for the intended DIVMOD calculation instead.  GCC is smart
    enough to know that both the quotient and the remainder are calculated
    with single DIVU, so with ISAs up to R5 the same instruction is actually
    produced with overall similar code.
    
    For R6 compiled code will work, but separate DIVU and MODU instructions
    will be produced, which are also interlocked, so scalar implementations
    will likely not perform as well as older ISAs with their asynchronous MD
    unit.  Likely still faster then the generic algorithm though.
    
    This removes a compilation error for R6 however where the original DIVU
    instruction is not supported anymore and the MDU accumulator registers
    have been removed and consequently GCC complains as to a constraint it
    cannot find a register for:

    MIPS: Avoid DIVU in `__div64_32' is result would be zero
    
    commit c1d337d45ec0a802299688e17d568c4e3a585895 upstream.
    
    We already check the high part of the divident against zero to avoid the
    costly DIVU instruction in that case, needed to reduce the high part of
    the divident, so we may well check against the divisor instead and set
    the high part of the quotient to zero right away.  We need to treat the
    high part the divident in that case though as the remainder that would
    be calculated by the DIVU instruction we avoided.
    
    This has passed correctness verification with test_div64 and reduced the
    module's average execution time down to 1.0445s and 0.2619s from 1.0668s
    and 0.2629s respectively for an R3400 CPU @40MHz and a 5Kc CPU @160MHz.

    MIPS: Reinstate platform `__div64_32' handler
    
    commit c49f71f60754acbff37505e1d16ca796bf8a8140 upstream.
    
    Our current MIPS platform `__div64_32' handler is inactive, because it
    is incorrectly only enabled for 64-bit configurations, for which generic
    `do_div' code does not call it anyway.
    
    The handler is not suitable for being called from there though as it
    only calculates 32 bits of the quotient under the assumption the 64-bit
    divident has been suitably reduced.  Code for such reduction used to be
    there, however it has been incorrectly removed with commit c21004cd5b4c
    ("MIPS: Rewrite <asm/div64.h> to work with gcc 4.4.0."), which should
    have only updated an obsoleted constraint for an inline asm involving
    $hi and $lo register outputs, while possibly wiring the original MIPS
    variant of the `do_div' macro as `__div64_32' handler for the generic
    `do_div' implementation
    
    Correct the handler as follows then:
    
    - Revert most of the commit referred, however retaining the current
      formatting, except for the final two instructions of the inline asm
      sequence, which the original commit missed.  Omit the original 64-bit
      parts though.
    
    - Rename the original `do_div' macro to `__div64_32'.  Use the combined
      `x' constraint referring to the MD accumulator as a whole, replacing
      the original individual `h' and `l' constraints used for $hi and $lo
      registers respectively, of which `h' has been obsoleted with GCC 4.4.
      Update surrounding code accordingly.
    
      We have since removed support for GCC versions before 4.9, so no need
      for a special arrangement here; GCC has supported the `x' constraint
      since forever anyway, or at least going back to 1991.
    
    - Rename the `__base' local variable in `__div64_32' to `__radix' to
      avoid a conflict with a local variable in `do_div'.
    
    - Actually enable this code for 32-bit rather than 64-bit configurations
      by qualifying it with BITS_PER_LONG being 32 instead of 64.  Include
      <asm/bitsperlong.h> for this macro rather than <linux/types.h> as we
      don't need anything else.
    
    - Finally include <asm-generic/div64.h> last rather than first.
    
    This has passed correctness verification with test_div64 and reduced the
    module's average execution time down to 1.0668s and 0.2629s from 2.1529s
    and 0.5647s respectively for an R3400 CPU @40MHz and a 5Kc CPU @160MHz.
    For a reference 64-bit `do_div' code where we have the DDIVU instruction
    available to do the whole calculation right away averages at 0.0660s for
    the latter CPU.

    FDDI: defxx: Make MMIO the configuration default except for EISA
    
    commit 193ced4a79599352d63cb8c9e2f0c6043106eb6a upstream.
    
    Recent versions of the PCI Express specification have deprecated support
    for I/O transactions and actually some PCIe host bridges, such as Power
    Systems Host Bridge 4 (PHB4), do not implement them.
    
    The default kernel configuration choice for the defxx driver is the use
    of I/O ports rather than MMIO for PCI and EISA systems.  It may have
    made sense as a conservative backwards compatible choice back when MMIO
    operation support was added to the driver as a part of TURBOchannel bus
    support.  However nowadays this configuration choice makes the driver
    unusable with systems that do not implement I/O transactions for PCIe.
    
    Make DEFXX_MMIO the configuration default then, except where configured
    for EISA.  This exception is because an EISA adapter can have its MMIO
    decoding disabled with ECU (EISA Configuration Utility) and therefore
    not available with the resource allocation infrastructure we implement,
    while port I/O is always readily available as it uses slot-specific
    addressing, directly mapped to the slot an option card has been placed
    in and handled with our EISA bus support core.  Conversely a kernel that
    supports modern systems which may not have I/O transactions implemented
    for PCIe will usually not be expected to handle legacy EISA systems.
    
    The change of the default will make it easier for people, including but
    not limited to distribution packagers, to make a working choice for the
    driver.
    
    Update the option description accordingly and while at it replace the
    potentially ambiguous PIO acronym with IOP for "port I/O" vs "I/O ports"
    according to our nomenclature used elsewhere.

    usb: dwc2: Fix gadget DMA unmap direction
    
    commit 75a41ce46bae6cbe7d3bb2584eb844291d642874 upstream.
    
    The dwc2 gadget support maps and unmaps DMA buffers as necessary. When
    mapping and unmapping it uses the direction of the endpoint to select
    the direction of the DMA transfer, but this fails for Control OUT
    transfers because the unmap occurs after the endpoint direction has
    been reversed for the status phase.
    
    A possible solution would be to unmap the buffer before the direction
    is changed, but a safer, less invasive fix is to remember the buffer
    direction independently of the endpoint direction.

    squashfs: fix divide error in calculate_skip()
    
    commit d6e621de1fceb3b098ebf435ef7ea91ec4838a1a upstream.
    
    Sysbot has reported a "divide error" which has been identified as being
    caused by a corrupted file_size value within the file inode.  This value
    has been corrupted to a much larger value than expected.
    
    Calculate_skip() is passed i_size_read(inode) >> msblk->block_log.  Due to
    the file_size value corruption this overflows the int argument/variable in
    that function, leading to the divide error.
    
    This patch changes the function to use u64.  This will accommodate any
    unexpectedly large values due to corruption.
    
    The value returned from calculate_skip() is clamped to be never more than
    SQUASHFS_CACHED_BLKS - 1, or 7.  So file_size corruption does not lead to
    an unexpectedly large return result here.

    powerpc/64s: Fix crashes when toggling entry flush barrier
    
    commit aec86b052df6541cc97c5fca44e5934cbea4963b upstream.
    
    The entry flush mitigation can be enabled/disabled at runtime via a
    debugfs file (entry_flush), which causes the kernel to patch itself to
    enable/disable the relevant mitigations.
    
    However depending on which mitigation we're using, it may not be safe to
    do that patching while other CPUs are active. For example the following
    crash:
    
      sleeper[15639]: segfault (11) at c000000000004c20 nip c000000000004c20 lr c000000000004c20
    
    Shows that we returned to userspace with a corrupted LR that points into
    the kernel, due to executing the partially patched call to the fallback
    entry flush (ie. we missed the LR restore).
    
    Fix it by doing the patching under stop machine. The CPUs that aren't
    doing the patching will be spinning in the core of the stop machine
    logic. That is currently sufficient for our purposes, because none of
    the patching we do is to that code or anywhere in the vicinity.

    ARC: entry: fix off-by-one error in syscall number validation
    
    commit 3433adc8bd09fc9f29b8baddf33b4ecd1ecd2cdc upstream.
    
    We have NR_syscall syscalls from [0 .. NR_syscall-1].
    However the check for invalid syscall number is "> NR_syscall" as
    opposed to >=. This off-by-one error erronesously allows "NR_syscall"
    to be treated as valid syscall causeing out-of-bounds access into
    syscall-call table ensuing a crash (holes within syscall table have a
    invalid-entry handler but this is beyond the array implementing the
    table).
    
    This problem showed up on v5.6 kernel when testing glibc 2.33 (v5.10
    kernel capable, includng faccessat2 syscall 439). The v5.6 kernel has
    NR_syscalls=439 (0 to 438). Due to the bug, 439 passed by glibc was
    not handled as -ENOSYS but processed leading to a crash.

    ksm: fix potential missing rmap_item for stable_node
    
    [ Upstream commit c89a384e2551c692a9fe60d093fd7080f50afc51 ]
    
    When removing rmap_item from stable tree, STABLE_FLAG of rmap_item is
    cleared with head reserved.  So the following scenario might happen: For
    ksm page with rmap_item1:
    
    cmp_and_merge_page
      stable_node->head = &migrate_nodes;
      remove_rmap_item_from_tree, but head still equal to stable_node;
      try_to_merge_with_ksm_page failed;
      return;
    
    For the same ksm page with rmap_item2, stable node migration succeed this
    time.  The stable_node->head does not equal to migrate_nodes now.  For ksm
    page with rmap_item1 again:
    
    cmp_and_merge_page
     stable_node->head != &migrate_nodes && rmap_item->head == stable_node
     return;
    
    We would miss the rmap_item for stable_node and might result in failed
    rmap_walk_ksm().  Fix this by set rmap_item->head to NULL when rmap_item
    is removed from stable tree.

    dangling with incorrect counts.  Unfortunately, hugepage_subpool_get_pages
    and hugetlb_acct_memory could possibly fail too.  We should correctly
    handle these cases.

    drm/radeon: Fix off-by-one power_state index heap overwrite
    
    [ Upstream commit 5bbf219328849e83878bddb7c226d8d42e84affc ]
    
    An out of bounds write happens when setting the default power state.

    sctp: fix a SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB leak in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b
    
    [ Upstream commit f282df0391267fb2b263da1cc3233aa6fb81defc ]
    
    Normally SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB is always incremented once asoc enter into
    ESTABLISHED from the state < ESTABLISHED and decremented when the asoc
    is being deleted.
    
    However, in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b(), the asoc's state can be changed to
    ESTABLISHED from the state >= ESTABLISHED where it shouldn't increment
    SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB. Otherwise, one asoc may increment MIB_CURRESTAB
    multiple times but only decrement once at the end.
    
    I was able to reproduce it by using scapy to do the 4-way shakehands,
    after that I replayed the COOKIE-ECHO chunk with 'peer_vtag' field
    changed to different values, and SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB was incremented
    multiple times and never went back to 0 even when the asoc was freed.
    
    This patch is to fix it by only incrementing SCTP_MIB_CURRESTAB when
    the state < ESTABLISHED in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b().

    NFSv4.2 fix handling of sr_eof in SEEK's reply
    
    [ Upstream commit 73f5c88f521a630ea1628beb9c2d48a2e777a419 ]
    
    Currently the client ignores the value of the sr_eof of the SEEK
    operation. According to the spec, if the server didn't find the
    requested extent and reached the end of the file, the server
    would return sr_eof=true. In case the request for DATA and no
    data was found (ie in the middle of the hole), then the lseek
    expects that ENXIO would be returned.

    pNFS/flexfiles: fix incorrect size check in decode_nfs_fh()
    
    [ Upstream commit ed34695e15aba74f45247f1ee2cf7e09d449f925 ]
    
    We (adam zabrocki, alexander matrosov, alexander tereshkin, maksym
    bazalii) observed the check:
    
            if (fh->size > sizeof(struct nfs_fh))
    
    should not use the size of the nfs_fh struct which includes an extra two
    bytes from the size field.
    
    struct nfs_fh {
            unsigned short         size;
            unsigned char          data[NFS_MAXFHSIZE];
    }
    
    but should determine the size from data[NFS_MAXFHSIZE] so the memcpy
    will not write 2 bytes beyond destination.  The proposed fix is to
    compare against the NFS_MAXFHSIZE directly, as is done elsewhere in fs
    code base.

    The  uninitialized variable dn.node_changed does not get set when a

    powerpc/iommu: Annotate nested lock for lockdep
    
    [ Upstream commit cc7130bf119add37f36238343a593b71ef6ecc1e ]
    
    The IOMMU table is divided into pools for concurrent mappings and each
    pool has a separate spinlock. When taking the ownership of an IOMMU group
    to pass through a device to a VM, we lock these spinlocks which triggers
    a false negative warning in lockdep (below).
    
    This fixes it by annotating the large pool's spinlock as a nest lock
    which makes lockdep not complaining when locking nested locks if
    the nest lock is locked already.

    wl3501_cs: Fix out-of-bounds warnings in wl3501_mgmt_join
    
    [ Upstream commit bb43e5718d8f1b46e7a77e7b39be3c691f293050 ]
    
    Fix the following out-of-bounds warnings by adding a new structure
    wl3501_req instead of duplicating the same members in structure
    wl3501_join_req and wl3501_scan_confirm:

            /* padding: 1 */
            /* last cacheline: 32 bytes */
    };
    
    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    bunch of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy(). Now that a new struct wl3501_req enclosing all those adjacent
    members is introduced, memcpy() doesn't overrun the length of
    &sig.beacon_period and &this->bss_set[i].beacon_period, because the
    address of the new struct object _req_ is used as the destination,
    instead.
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    ASoC: rt286: Generalize support for ALC3263 codec
    
    [ Upstream commit aa2f9c12821e6a4ba1df4fb34a3dbc6a2a1ee7fe ]
    
    The ALC3263 codec on the XPS 13 9343 is also found on the Latitude 13 7350
    and Venue 11 Pro 7140. They require the same handling for the combo jack to
    work with a headset: GPIO pin 6 must be set.
    
    The HDA driver always sets this pin on the ALC3263, which it distinguishes
    by the codec vendor/device ID 0x10ec0288 and PCI subsystem vendor ID 0x1028
    (Dell). The ASoC driver does not use PCI, so adapt this check to use DMI to
    determine if Dell is the system vendor.

    Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:
    
    net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c:3150:4: warning: 'memcpy' offset [17, 28] from the object at 'addr' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'v4' with type 'struct sockaddr_in' at offset 0 [-Warray-bounds]
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    kconfig: nconf: stop endless search loops
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c94b430b9f6213dec84e309bb480a71778c4213 ]
    
    If the user selects the very first entry in a page and performs a
    search-up operation, or selects the very last entry in a page and
    performs a search-down operation that will not succeed (e.g., via
    [/]asdfzzz[Up Arrow]), nconf will never terminate searching the page.
    
    The reason is that in this case, the starting point will be set to -1
    or n, which is then translated into (n - 1) (i.e., the last entry of
    the page) or 0 (i.e., the first entry of the page) and finally the
    search begins. This continues to work fine until the index reaches 0 or
    (n - 1), at which point it will be decremented to -1 or incremented to
    n, but not checked against the starting point right away. Instead, it's
    wrapped around to the bottom or top again, after which the starting
    point check occurs... and naturally fails.
    
    My original implementation added another check for -1 before wrapping
    the running index variable around, but Masahiro Yamada pointed out that
    the actual issue is that the comparison point (starting point) exceeds
    bounds (i.e., the [0,n-1] interval) in the first place and that,
    instead, the starting point should be fixed.
    
    This has the welcome side-effect of also fixing the case where the
    starting point was n while searching down, which also lead to an
    infinite loop.
    
    OTOH, this code is now essentially all his work.
    
    Amazingly, nobody seems to have been hit by this for 11 years - or at
    the very least nobody bothered to debug and fix this.

    mac80211: clear the beacon's CRC after channel switch
    
    [ Upstream commit d6843d1ee283137723b4a8c76244607ce6db1951 ]
    
    After channel switch, we should consider any beacon with a
    CSA IE as a new switch. If the CSA IE is a leftover from
    before the switch that the AP forgot to remove, we'll get
    a CSA-to-Self.
    
    This caused issues in iwlwifi where the firmware saw a beacon
    with a CSA-to-Self with mode = 1 on the new channel after a
    switch. The firmware considered this a new switch and closed
    its queues. Since the beacon didn't change between before and
    after the switch, we wouldn't handle it (the CRC is the same)
    and we wouldn't let the firmware open its queues again or
    disconnect if the CSA IE stays for too long.
    
    Clear the CRC valid state after we switch to make sure that
    we handle the beacon and handle the CSA IE as required.

    ip6_vti: proper dev_{hold|put} in ndo_[un]init methods
    
    [ Upstream commit 40cb881b5aaa0b69a7d93dec8440d5c62dae299f ]
    
    After adopting CONFIG_PCPU_DEV_REFCNT=n option, syzbot was able to trigger
    a warning [1]
    
    Issue here is that:
    
    - all dev_put() should be paired with a corresponding prior dev_hold().
    
    - A driver doing a dev_put() in its ndo_uninit() MUST also
      do a dev_hold() in its ndo_init(), only when ndo_init()
      is returning 0.
    
    Otherwise, register_netdevice() would call ndo_uninit()
    in its error path and release a refcount too soon.
    
    Therefore, we need to move dev_hold() call from
    vti6_tnl_create2() to vti6_dev_init_gen()

    Bluetooth: initialize skb_queue_head at l2cap_chan_create()
    
    [ Upstream commit be8597239379f0f53c9710dd6ab551bbf535bec6 ]
    
    syzbot is hitting "INFO: trying to register non-static key." message [1],
    for "struct l2cap_chan"->tx_q.lock spinlock is not yet initialized when
    l2cap_chan_del() is called due to e.g. timeout.
    
    Since "struct l2cap_chan"->lock mutex is initialized at l2cap_chan_create()
    immediately after "struct l2cap_chan" is allocated using kzalloc(), let's
    as well initialize "struct l2cap_chan"->{tx_q,srej_q}.lock spinlocks there.

    Bluetooth: Set CONF_NOT_COMPLETE as l2cap_chan default
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a9d54b1947ecea8eea9a902c0b7eb58a98add8a ]
    
    Currently l2cap_chan_set_defaults() reset chan->conf_state to zero.
    However, there is a flag CONF_NOT_COMPLETE which is set when
    creating the l2cap_chan. It is suggested that the flag should be
    cleared when l2cap_chan is ready, but when l2cap_chan_set_defaults()
    is called, l2cap_chan is not yet ready. Therefore, we must set this
    flag as the default.

    hdsp wants to disable a not enabled pci device, which makes kernel
    throw a warning. Make sure the device is enabled before calling disable.

    net: stmmac: Set FIFO sizes for ipq806x
    
    [ Upstream commit e127906b68b49ddb3ecba39ffa36a329c48197d3 ]
    
    Commit eaf4fac47807 ("net: stmmac: Do not accept invalid MTU values")
    started using the TX FIFO size to verify what counts as a valid MTU
    request for the stmmac driver.  This is unset for the ipq806x variant.
    Looking at older patches for this it seems the RX + TXs buffers can be
    up to 8k, so set appropriately.
    
    (I sent this as an RFC patch in June last year, but received no replies.
    I've been running with this on my hardware (a MikroTik RB3011) since
    then with larger MTUs to support both the internal qca8k switch and
    VLANs with no problems. Without the patch it's impossible to set the
    larger MTU required to support this.)

    sctp: delay auto_asconf init until binding the first addr
    
    commit 34e5b01186858b36c4d7c87e1a025071e8e2401f upstream.
    
    As Or Cohen described:
    
      If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
      held and sp->do_auto_asconf is true, then an element is removed
      from the auto_asconf_splist without any proper locking.
    
      This can happen in the following functions:
      1. In sctp_accept, if sctp_sock_migrate fails.
      2. In inet_create or inet6_create, if there is a bpf program
         attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE which denies
         creation of the sctp socket.
    
    This patch is to fix it by moving the auto_asconf init out of
    sctp_init_sock(), by which inet_create()/inet6_create() won't
    need to operate it in sctp_destroy_sock() when calling
    sk_common_release().
    
    It also makes more sense to do auto_asconf init while binding the
    first addr, as auto_asconf actually requires an ANY addr bind,
    see it in sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler().
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23133.

    commit 01bfe5e8e428b475982a98a46cca5755726f3f7f upstream.
    
    This reverts commit b166a20b07382b8bc1dcee2a448715c9c2c81b5b.
    
    This one has to be reverted as it introduced a dead lock, as
    syzbot reported:
    
           CPU0                    CPU1
           ----                    ----
      lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock);
                                   lock(slock-AF_INET6);
                                   lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock);
      lock(slock-AF_INET6);
    
    CPU0 is the thread of sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler(), and CPU1
    is that of sctp_close().
    
    The original issue this commit fixed will be fixed in the next
    patch.

    kfifo: fix ternary sign extension bugs
    
    [ Upstream commit 926ee00ea24320052b46745ef4b00d91c05bd03d ]
    
    The intent with this code was to return negative error codes but instead
    it returns positives.
    
    The problem is how type promotion works with ternary operations.  These
    functions return long, "ret" is an int and "copied" is a u32.  The
    negative error code is first cast to u32 so it becomes a high positive and
    then cast to long where it's still a positive.
    
    We could fix this by declaring "ret" as a ssize_t but let's just get rid
    of the ternaries instead.

    [ Upstream commit 6d72e7c767acbbdd44ebc7d89c6690b405b32b57 ]
    
    In emac_mac_tx_buf_send, it calls emac_tx_fill_tpd(..,skb,..).
    If some error happens in emac_tx_fill_tpd(), the skb will be freed via
    dev_kfree_skb(skb) in error branch of emac_tx_fill_tpd().
    But the freed skb is still used via skb->len by netdev_sent_queue(,skb->len).
    
    As i observed that emac_tx_fill_tpd() haven't modified the value of skb->len,
    thus my patch assigns skb->len to 'len' before the possible free and
    use 'len' instead of skb->len later.

    ath9k: Fix error check in ath9k_hw_read_revisions() for PCI devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 7dd9a40fd6e0d0f1fd8e1931c007e080801dfdce ]
    
    When the error check in ath9k_hw_read_revisions() was added, it checked for
    -EIO which is what ath9k_regread() in the ath9k_htc driver uses. However,
    for plain ath9k, the register read function uses ioread32(), which just
    returns -1 on error. So if such a read fails, it still gets passed through
    and ends up as a weird mac revision in the log output.
    
    Fix this by changing ath9k_regread() to return -1 on error like ioread32()
    does, and fix the error check to look for that instead of -EIO.

    [ Upstream commit e16edc99d658cd41c60a44cc14d170697aa3271f ]
    
    VMCI feature is not supported in conjunction with the vSphere Fault
    Tolerance (FT) feature.
    
    VMware Tools can repeatedly try to create a vsock connection. If FT is
    enabled the kernel logs is flooded with the following messages:
    
        qp_alloc_hypercall result = -20
        Could not attach to queue pair with -20
    
    "qp_alloc_hypercall result = -20" was hidden by commit e8266c4c3307
    ("VMCI: Stop log spew when qp allocation isn't possible"), but "Could
    not attach to queue pair with -20" is still there flooding the log.
    
    Since the error message can be useful in some cases, print it only once.

    [ Upstream commit 92dfb27240fea2776f61c5422472cb6defca7767 ]
    
    While adding the invalid IRQ check after calling platform_get_irq(),
    I managed to overlook that the driver has a complex error path in its
    probe() method, thus a simple *return* couldn't be used.  Use a proper
    *goto* instead!

    MIPS: pci-legacy: stop using of_pci_range_to_resource
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ecb9dc1581eebecaee56decac70e35365260866 ]
    
    Mirror commit aeba3731b150 ("powerpc/pci: Fix IO space breakage after
    of_pci_range_to_resource() change").
    
    Most MIPS platforms do not define PCI_IOBASE, nor implement
    pci_address_to_pio(). Moreover, IO_SPACE_LIMIT is 0xffff for most MIPS
    platforms. of_pci_range_to_resource passes the _start address_ of the IO
    range into pci_address_to_pio, which then checks it against
    IO_SPACE_LIMIT and fails, because for MIPS platforms that use
    pci-legacy (pci-lantiq, pci-rt3883, pci-mt7620), IO ranges start much
    higher than 0xffff.
    
    In fact, pci-mt7621 in staging already works around this problem, see
    commit 09dd629eeabb ("staging: mt7621-pci: fix io space and properly set
    resource limits")
    
    So just stop using of_pci_range_to_resource, which does not work for
    MIPS.

      pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0xffffffff]

    The shifting of the u8 integers rq->caching by 26 bits to
    the left will be promoted to a 32 bit signed int and then
    sign-extended to a u64. In the event that rq->caching is
    greater than 0x1f then all then all the upper 32 bits of
    the u64 end up as also being set because of the int
    sign-extension. Fix this by casting the u8 values to a
    u64 before the 26 bit left shift.

    mt7601u: fix always true expression
    
    [ Upstream commit 87fce88658ba047ae62e83497d3f3c5dc22fa6f9 ]
    
    Currently the expression ~nic_conf1 is always true because nic_conf1
    is a u16 and according to 6.5.3.3 of the C standard the ~ operator
    promotes the u16 to an integer before flipping all the bits. Thus
    the top 16 bits of the integer result are all set so the expression
    is always true.  If the intention was to flip all the bits of nic_conf1
    then casting the integer result back to a u16 is a suitabel fix.
    
    Interestingly static analyzers seem to thing a bitwise ! should be
    used instead of ~ for this scenario, so I think the original intent
    of the expression may need some extra consideration.

    If any of the cipher schemes specified by the driver are invalid, bail
    out and fail the registration rather than just warning.  Otherwise, we
    might later crash when we try to use the invalid cipher scheme, e.g.
    if the hdr_len is (significantly) less than the pn_offs + pn_len, we'd
    have an out-of-bounds access in RX validation.

    powerpc/perf: Fix PMU constraint check for EBB events
    
    [ Upstream commit 10f8f96179ecc7f69c927f6d231f6d02736cea83 ]
    
    The power PMU group constraints includes check for EBB events to make
    sure all events in a group must agree on EBB. This will prevent
    scheduling EBB and non-EBB events together. But in the existing check,
    settings for constraint mask and value is interchanged. Patch fixes the
    same.
    
    Before the patch, PMU selftest "cpu_event_pinned_vs_ebb_test" fails with
    below in dmesg logs. This happens because EBB event gets enabled along
    with a non-EBB cpu event.

    liquidio: Fix unintented sign extension of a left shift of a u16
    
    [ Upstream commit 298b58f00c0f86868ea717426beb5c1198772f81 ]
    
    The macro CN23XX_PEM_BAR1_INDEX_REG is being used to shift oct->pcie_port
    (a u16) left 24 places. There are two subtle issues here, first the
    shift gets promoted to an signed int and then sign extended to a u64.
    If oct->pcie_port is 0x80 or more then the upper bits get sign extended
    to 1. Secondly shfiting a u16 24 bits will lead to an overflow so it
    needs to be cast to a u64 for all the bits to not overflow.
    
    It is entirely possible that the u16 port value is never large enough
    for this to fail, but it is useful to fix unintended overflows such
    as this.
    
    Fix this by casting the port parameter to the macro to a u64 before
    the shift.

    identical_pvr_fixup() calls two functions marked as __init and is only
    called by a function marked as __init so it should be marked as __init
    as well. At the same time, remove the inline keywork as it is not
    necessary to inline this function. The compiler is still free to do so
    if it feels it is worthwhile since commit 889b3c1245de ("compiler:
    remove CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING entirely").

    net: lapbether: Prevent racing when checking whether the netif is running
    
    [ Upstream commit 5acd0cfbfbb5a688da1bfb1a2152b0c855115a35 ]
    
    There are two "netif_running" checks in this driver. One is in
    "lapbeth_xmit" and the other is in "lapbeth_rcv". They serve to make
    sure that the LAPB APIs called in these functions are called before
    "lapb_unregister" is called by the "ndo_stop" function.
    
    However, these "netif_running" checks are unreliable, because it's
    possible that immediately after "netif_running" returns true, "ndo_stop"
    is called (which causes "lapb_unregister" to be called).
    
    This patch adds locking to make sure "lapbeth_xmit" and "lapbeth_rcv" can
    reliably check and ensure the netif is running while doing their work.

    HID: plantronics: Workaround for double volume key presses
    
    [ Upstream commit f567d6ef8606fb427636e824c867229ecb5aefab ]
    
    Plantronics Blackwire 3220 Series (047f:c056) sends HID reports twice
    for each volume key press. This patch adds a quirk to hid-plantronics
    for this product ID, which will ignore the second volume key press if
    it happens within 5 ms from the last one that was handled.
    
    The patch was tested on the mentioned model only, it shouldn't affect
    other models, however, this quirk might be needed for them too.
    Auto-repeat (when a key is held pressed) is not affected, because the
    rate is about 3 times per second, which is far less frequent than once
    in 5 ms.

    Currently the chroma_flags and alpha_flags are being zero'd with a bit-wise
    mask and the following statement should be bit-wise or'ing in the new flag

    ttyprintk: Add TTY hangup callback.
    
    [ Upstream commit c0070e1e60270f6a1e09442a9ab2335f3eaeaad2 ]
    
    syzbot is reporting hung task due to flood of
    
      tty_warn(tty, "%s: tty->count = 1 port count = %d\n", __func__,
               port->count);
    
    message [1], for ioctl(TIOCVHANGUP) prevents tty_port_close() from
    decrementing port->count due to tty_hung_up_p() == true.
    
    ----------
    #include <sys/types.h>

    When TTY hangup happens, port->count needs to be reset via

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Increase wait time for VMbus unload
    
    [ Upstream commit 77db0ec8b7764cb9b09b78066ebfd47b2c0c1909 ]
    
    When running in Azure, disks may be connected to a Linux VM with
    read/write caching enabled. If a VM panics and issues a VMbus
    UNLOAD request to Hyper-V, the response is delayed until all dirty
    data in the disk cache is flushed.  In extreme cases, this flushing
    can take 10's of seconds, depending on the disk speed and the amount
    of dirty data. If kdump is configured for the VM, the current 10 second
    timeout in vmbus_wait_for_unload() may be exceeded, and the UNLOAD
    complete message may arrive well after the kdump kernel is already
    running, causing problems.  Note that no problem occurs if kdump is
    not enabled because Hyper-V waits for the cache flush before doing
    a reboot through the BIOS/UEFI code.
    
    Fix this problem by increasing the timeout in vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    to 100 seconds. Also output periodic messages so that if anyone is
    watching the serial console, they won't think the VM is completely
    hung.

    x86/platform/uv: Fix !KEXEC build failure
    
    [ Upstream commit c2209ea55612efac75de0a58ef5f7394fae7fa0f ]
    
    When KEXEC is disabled, the UV build fails:
    
      arch/x86/platform/uv/uv_nmi.c:875:14: error: ‘uv_nmi_kexec_failed’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    
    Since uv_nmi_kexec_failed is only defined in the KEXEC_CORE #ifdef branch,
    this code cannot ever have been build tested:
    
            if (main)
                    pr_err("UV: NMI kdump: KEXEC not supported in this kernel\n");
            atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 1);
    
    Nor is this use possible in uv_handle_nmi():
    
                    atomic_set(&uv_nmi_kexec_failed, 0);
    
    These bugs were introduced in this commit:
    
        d0a9964e9873: ("x86/platform/uv: Implement simple dump failover if kdump fails")
    
    Which added the uv_nmi_kexec_failed assignments to !KEXEC code, while making the
    definition KEXEC-only - apparently without testing the !KEXEC case.
    
    Instead of complicating the #ifdef maze, simplify the code by requiring X86_UV
    to depend on KEXEC_CORE. This pattern is present in other architectures as well.
    
    ( We'll remove the untested, 7 years old !KEXEC complications from the file in a
      separate commit. )

    Then gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer() returns err and gpmi_free_dma_buffer()
    is called again to free this->auxiliary_virt in err_out. This causes
    a double free.
    
    As gpmi_free_dma_buffer() has already called in gpmi_alloc_dma_buffer's
    error path, so it should return err directly instead of releasing the dma

    mtd: require write permissions for locking and badblock ioctls
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e97743fd180981bef5f01402342bb54bf1c6366 ]
    
    MEMLOCK, MEMUNLOCK and OTPLOCK modify protection bits. Thus require
    write permission. Depending on the hardware MEMLOCK might even be
    write-once, e.g. for SPI-NOR flashes with their WP# tied to GND. OTPLOCK
    is always write-once.
    
    MEMSETBADBLOCK modifies the bad block table.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Remove redundant entry for ALC861 Haier/Uniwill devices
    
    commit defce244b01ee12534910a4544e11be5eb927d25 upstream.
    
    The quirk entry for Uniwill ECS M31EI is with the PCI SSID device 0,
    which means matching with all.  That is, it's essentially equivalent
    with SND_PCI_QUIRK_VENDOR(0x1584), which also matches with the

    drm/radeon: fix copy of uninitialized variable back to userspace
    
    commit 8dbc2ccac5a65c5b57e3070e36a3dc97c7970d96 upstream.
    
    Currently the ioctl command RADEON_INFO_SI_BACKEND_ENABLED_MASK can
    copy back uninitialised data in value_tmp that pointer *value points
    to. This can occur when rdev->family is less than CHIP_BONAIRE and
    less than CHIP_TAHITI.  Fix this by adding in a missing -EINVAL
    so that no invalid value is copied back to userspace.

    md: md_open returns -EBUSY when entering racing area
    
    commit 6a4db2a60306eb65bfb14ccc9fde035b74a4b4e7 upstream.
    
    commit d3374825ce57 ("md: make devices disappear when they are no longer
    needed.") introduced protection between mddev creating & removing. The
    md_open shouldn't create mddev when all_mddevs list doesn't contain
    mddev. With currently code logic, there will be very easy to trigger
    soft lockup in non-preempt env.
    
    This patch changes md_open returning from -ERESTARTSYS to -EBUSY, which
    will break the infinitely retry when md_open enter racing area.
    
    This patch is partly fix soft lockup issue, full fix needs mddev_find
    is split into two functions: mddev_find & mddev_find_or_alloc. And
    md_open should call new mddev_find (it only does searching job).
    
    For more detail, please refer with Christoph's "split mddev_find" patch
    in later commits.
    
    *** env ***
    kvm-qemu VM 2C1G with 2 iscsi luns
    kernel should be non-preempt
    
    *** script ***
    
    about trigger every time with below script
    
    ```
    1  node1="mdcluster1"
    2  node2="mdcluster2"
    3
    4  mdadm -Ss
    5  ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
    6  wipefs -a /dev/sda /dev/sdb
    7  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -b clustered -e 1.2 -n 2 -l mirror /dev/sda \
       /dev/sdb --assume-clean
    8
    9  for i in {1..10}; do
    10    echo ==== $i ====;
    11
    12    echo "test  ...."
    13    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/sda /dev/sdb"
    14    sleep 1
    15
    16    echo "clean  ....."
    17    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
    18 done
    ```
    
    I use mdcluster env to trigger soft lockup, but it isn't mdcluster
    speical bug. To stop md array in mdcluster env will do more jobs than
    non-cluster array, which will leave enough time/gap to allow kernel to
    run md_open.

    *** rootcause ***
    
    "mdadm -A" (or other array assemble commands) will start a daemon "mdadm
    --monitor" by default. When "mdadm -Ss" is running, the stop action will
    wakeup "mdadm --monitor". The "--monitor" daemon will immediately get
    info from /proc/mdstat. This time mddev in kernel still exist, so
    /proc/mdstat still show md device, which makes "mdadm --monitor" to open
    /dev/md0.
    
    The previously "mdadm -Ss" is removing action, the "mdadm --monitor"
    open action will trigger md_open which is creating action. Racing is
    happening.
    
    ```
    <thread 1>: "mdadm -Ss"
    md_release
      mddev_put deletes mddev from all_mddevs
      queue_work for mddev_delayed_delete
      at this time, "/dev/md0" is still available for opening
    
    <thread 2>: "mdadm --monitor ..."
    md_open
     + mddev_find can't find mddev of /dev/md0, and create a new mddev and
     |    return.
     + trigger "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return
          -ERESTARTSYS.
    ```
    
    In non-preempt kernel, <thread 2> is occupying on current CPU. and
    mddev_delayed_delete which was created in <thread 1> also can't be
    schedule.
    
    In preempt kernel, it can also trigger above racing. But kernel doesn't
    allow one thread running on a CPU all the time. after <thread 2> running
    some time, the later "mdadm -A" (refer above script line 13) will call
    md_alloc to alloc a new gendisk for mddev. it will break md_open
    statement "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return 0 to caller,
    the soft lockup is broken.

    tracing: Restructure trace_clock_global() to never block
    
    commit aafe104aa9096827a429bc1358f8260ee565b7cc upstream.
    
    It was reported that a fix to the ring buffer recursion detection would
    cause a hung machine when performing suspend / resume testing. The
    following backtrace was extracted from debugging that case:
    
    Call Trace:

    With the following RIP:
    
    RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x69/0x200
    
    Since the fix to the recursion detection would allow a single recursion to
    happen while tracing, this lead to the trace_clock_global() taking a spin
    lock and then trying to take it again:
    
    ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
      trace_clock_global() {
        arch_spin_lock() {
          queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
            /* lock taken */
            (something else gets traced by function graph tracer)
              ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
                trace_clock_global() {
                  arch_spin_lock() {
                    queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
                    /* DEAD LOCK! */
    
    Tracing should *never* block, as it can lead to strange lockups like the
    above.
    
    Restructure the trace_clock_global() code to instead of simply taking a
    lock to update the recorded "prev_time" simply use it, as two events
    happening on two different CPUs that calls this at the same time, really
    doesn't matter which one goes first. Use a trylock to grab the lock for
    updating the prev_time, and if it fails, simply try again the next time.
    If it failed to be taken, that means something else is already updating
    it.

    tracing: Map all PIDs to command lines
    
    commit 785e3c0a3a870e72dc530856136ab4c8dd207128 upstream.
    
    The default max PID is set by PID_MAX_DEFAULT, and the tracing
    infrastructure uses this number to map PIDs to the comm names of the
    tasks, such output of the trace can show names from the recorded PIDs in
    the ring buffer. This mapping is also exported to user space via the
    "saved_cmdlines" file in the tracefs directory.
    
    But currently the mapping expects the PIDs to be less than
    PID_MAX_DEFAULT, which is the default maximum and not the real maximum.
    Recently, systemd will increases the maximum value of a PID on the system,
    and when tasks are traced that have a PID higher than PID_MAX_DEFAULT, its
    comm is not recorded. This leads to the entire trace to have "<...>" as
    the comm name, which is pretty useless.
    
    Instead, keep the array mapping the size of PID_MAX_DEFAULT, but instead
    of just mapping the index to the comm, map a mask of the PID
    (PID_MAX_DEFAULT - 1) to the comm, and find the full PID from the
    map_cmdline_to_pid array (that already exists).
    
    This bug goes back to the beginning of ftrace, but hasn't been an issue
    until user space started increasing the maximum value of PIDs.

    tracing: Use strlcpy() instead of strcpy() in __trace_find_cmdline()
    
    commit e09e28671cda63e6308b31798b997639120e2a21 upstream.
    
    Strcpy is inherently not safe, and strlcpy() should be used instead.
    __trace_find_cmdline() uses strcpy() because the comms saved must have a
    terminating nul character, but it doesn't hurt to add the extra protection
    of using strlcpy() instead of strcpy().

    commit eaf260ac04d9b4cf9f458d5c97555bfff2da526e upstream.
    
    Currently we stop recording comm for non-idle tasks when switching from/to idle
    task since we treat that as a record failure. Fix that by treat recording of
    comm for idle task as a success.

    misc: lis3lv02d: Fix false-positive WARN on various HP models
    
    commit 3641762c1c9c7cfd84a7061a0a73054f09b412e3 upstream.
    
    Before this commit lis3lv02d_get_pwron_wait() had a WARN_ONCE() to catch
    a potential divide by 0. WARN macros should only be used to catch internal
    kernel bugs and that is not the case here. We have been receiving a lot of
    bug reports about kernel backtraces caused by this WARN.
    
    The div value being checked comes from the lis3->odrs[] array. Which
    is sized to be a power-of-2 matching the number of bits in lis3->odr_mask.
    
    The only lis3 model where this array is not entirely filled with non zero
    values. IOW the only model where we can hit the div == 0 check is the
    3dc ("8 bits 3DC sensor") model:
    
    int lis3_3dc_rates[16] = {0, 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 1600, 5000};
    
    Note the 0 value at index 0, according to the datasheet an odr index of 0
    means "Power-down mode". HP typically uses a lis3 accelerometer for HDD
    fall protection. What I believe is happening here is that on newer
    HP devices, which only contain a SDD, the BIOS is leaving the lis3 device
    powered-down since it is not used for HDD fall protection.
    
    Note that the lis3_3dc_rates array initializer only specifies 10 values,
    which matches the datasheet. So it also contains 6 zero values at the end.
    
    Replace the WARN with a normal check, which treats an odr index of 0
    as power-down and uses a normal dev_err() to report the error in case
    odr index point past the initialized part of the array.

    FDDI: defxx: Bail out gracefully with unassigned PCI resource for CSR
    
    commit f626ca682912fab55dff15469ce893ae16b65c7e upstream.
    
    Recent versions of the PCI Express specification have deprecated support
    for I/O transactions and actually some PCIe host bridges, such as Power
    Systems Host Bridge 4 (PHB4), do not implement them.
    
    For those systems the PCI BARs that request a mapping in the I/O space
    have the length recorded in the corresponding PCI resource set to zero,
    which makes it unassigned:
    
    # lspci -s 0031:02:04.0 -v
    0031:02:04.0 FDDI network controller: Digital Equipment Corporation PCI-to-PDQ Interface Chip [PFI] FDDI (DEFPA) (rev 02)
            Subsystem: Digital Equipment Corporation FDDIcontroller/PCI (DEFPA)
            Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 136, IRQ 57, NUMA node 8
            Memory at 620c080020000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
            I/O ports at <unassigned> [disabled]
            Memory at 620c080030000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64K]
            Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 2
            Kernel driver in use: defxx
            Kernel modules: defxx
    
    #
    
    Regardless the driver goes ahead and requests it (here observed with a
    Raptor Talos II POWER9 system), resulting in an odd /proc/ioport entry:
    
    # cat /proc/ioports
    00000000-ffffffffffffffff : 0031:02:04.0
    #
    
    Furthermore, the system gets confused as the driver actually continues
    and pokes at those locations, causing a flood of messages being output
    to the system console by the underlying system firmware, like:
    
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    defxx 0031:02:04.0: enabling device (0140 -> 0142)
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010000
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010014
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    LPC[000]: Got SYNC no-response error. Error address reg: 0xd0010014
    IPMI: dropping non severe PEL event
    
    and so on and so on (possibly intermixed actually, as there's no locking
    between the kernel and the firmware in console port access with this
    particular system, but cleaned up above for clarity), and once some 10k
    of such pairs of the latter two messages have been produced an interace
    eventually shows up in a useless state:
    
    0031:02:04.0: DEFPA at I/O addr = 0x0, IRQ = 57, Hardware addr = 00-00-00-00-00-00
    
    This was not expected to happen as resource handling was added to the
    driver a while ago, because it was not known at that time that a PCI
    system would be possible that cannot assign port I/O resources, and
    oddly enough `request_region' does not fail, which would have caught it.
    
    Correct the problem then by checking for the length of zero for the CSR
    resource and bail out gracefully refusing to register an interface if
    that turns out to be the case, producing messages like:
    
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    0031:02:04.0: Cannot use I/O, no address set, aborting
    0031:02:04.0: Recompile driver with "CONFIG_DEFXX_MMIO=y"
    
    Keep the original check for the EISA MMIO resource as implemented,
    because in that case the length is hardwired to 0x400 as a consequence
    of how the compare/mask address decoding works in the ESIC chip and it
    is only the base address that is set to zero if MMIO has been disabled
    for the adapter in EISA configuration, which in turn could be a valid
    bus address in a legacy-free system implementing PCI, especially for
    port I/O.
    
    Where the EISA MMIO resource has been disabled for the adapter in EISA
    configuration this arrangement keeps producing messages like:
    
    eisa 00:05: EISA: slot 5: DEC3002 detected
    defxx: v1.11 2014/07/01  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
    00:05: Cannot use MMIO, no address set, aborting
    00:05: Recompile driver with "CONFIG_DEFXX_MMIO=n"
    00:05: Or run ECU and set adapter's MMIO location
    
    with the last two lines now swapped for easier handling in the driver.
    
    There is no need to check for and catch the case of a port I/O resource
    not having been assigned for EISA as the adapter uses the slot-specific
    I/O space, which gets assigned by how EISA has been specified and maps
    directly to the particular slot an option card has been placed in.  And
    the EISA variant of the adapter has additional registers that are only

    While at it factor out the error message calls into helpers and fix an

    net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect
    
    commit c61760e6940dd4039a7f5e84a6afc9cdbf4d82b6 upstream.
    
    Commits 8a4cd82d ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()")
    and c33b1cc62 ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()")
    fixed a refcount leak bug in bind/connect but introduced a
    use-after-free if the same local is assigned to 2 different sockets.
    
    This can be triggered by the following simple program:
        int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
        int sock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
        memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
        addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;
        addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP;
        bind( sock1, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
        bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
        close(sock1);
        close(sock2);
    
    Fix this by assigning NULL to llcp_sock->local after calling
    nfc_llcp_local_put.
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23134.

    bluetooth: eliminate the potential race condition when removing the HCI controller
    
    commit e2cb6b891ad2b8caa9131e3be70f45243df82a80 upstream.
    
    There is a possible race condition vulnerability between issuing a HCI
    command and removing the cont.  Specifically, functions hci_req_sync()
    and hci_dev_do_close() can race each other like below:
    
    thread-A in hci_req_sync()      |   thread-B in hci_dev_do_close()
                                    |   hci_req_sync_lock(hdev);
    test_bit(HCI_UP, &hdev->flags); |
    ...                             |   test_and_clear_bit(HCI_UP, &hdev->flags)
    hci_req_sync_lock(hdev);        |
                                    |
    In this commit we alter the sequence in function hci_req_sync(). Hence,

    hsr: use netdev_err() instead of WARN_ONCE()
    
    commit 4b793acdca0050739b99ace6a8b9e7f717f57c6b upstream.
    
    When HSR interface is sending a frame, it finds a node with
    the destination ethernet address from the list.
    If there is no node, it calls WARN_ONCE().
    But, using WARN_ONCE() for this situation is a little bit overdoing.
    So, in this patch, the netdev_err() is used instead.

    Bluetooth: verify AMP hci_chan before amp_destroy
    
    commit 5c4c8c9544099bb9043a10a5318130a943e32fc3 upstream.
    
    hci_chan can be created in 2 places: hci_loglink_complete_evt() if
    it is an AMP hci_chan, or l2cap_conn_add() otherwise. In theory,
    Only AMP hci_chan should be removed by a call to
    hci_disconn_loglink_complete_evt(). However, the controller might mess
    up, call that function, and destroy an hci_chan which is not initiated
    by hci_loglink_complete_evt().
    
    This patch adds a verification that the destroyed hci_chan must have
    been init'd by hci_loglink_complete_evt().

    dm rq: fix double free of blk_mq_tag_set in dev remove after table load fails
    
    commit 8e947c8f4a5620df77e43c9c75310dc510250166 upstream.
    
    When loading a device-mapper table for a request-based mapped device,
    and the allocation/initialization of the blk_mq_tag_set for the device
    fails, a following device remove will cause a double free.
    
    E.g. (dmesg):
      device-mapper: core: Cannot initialize queue for request-based dm-mq mapped device
      device-mapper: ioctl: unable to set up device queue for new table.

    When allocation/initialization of the blk_mq_tag_set fails in
    dm_mq_init_request_queue(), it is uninitialized/freed, but the pointer
    is not reset to NULL; so when dev_remove() later gets into
    dm_mq_cleanup_mapped_device() it sees the pointer and tries to
    uninitialize and free it again.
    
    Fix this by setting the pointer to NULL in dm_mq_init_request_queue()
    error-handling. Also set it to NULL in dm_mq_cleanup_mapped_device().

    usb: gadget/function/f_fs string table fix for multiple languages
    
    commit 55b74ce7d2ce0b0058f3e08cab185a0afacfe39e upstream.
    
    Fixes bug with the handling of more than one language in
    the string table in f_fs.c.
    str_count was not reset for subsequent language codes.
    str_count-- "rolls under" and processes u32 max strings on
    the processing of the second language entry.
    The existing bug can be reproduced by adding a second language table
    to the structure "strings" in tools/usb/ffs-test.c.

    usb: gadget: Fix double free of device descriptor pointers
    
    commit 43c4cab006f55b6ca549dd1214e22f5965a8675f upstream.
    
    Upon driver unbind usb_free_all_descriptors() function frees all
    speed descriptor pointers without setting them to NULL. In case
    gadget speed changes (i.e from super speed plus to super speed)
    after driver unbind only upto super speed descriptor pointers get
    populated. Super speed plus desc still holds the stale (already
    freed) pointer. Fix this issue by setting all descriptor pointers
    to NULL after freeing them in usb_free_all_descriptors().

    usb: gadget: dummy_hcd: fix gpf in gadget_setup
    
    commit 4a5d797a9f9c4f18585544237216d7812686a71f upstream.
    
    Fix a general protection fault reported by syzbot due to a race between
    gadget_setup() and gadget_unbind() in raw_gadget.
    
    The gadget core is supposed to guarantee that there won't be any more
    callbacks to the gadget driver once the driver's unbind routine is
    called. That guarantee is enforced in usb_gadget_remove_driver as
    follows:
    
            usb_gadget_disconnect(udc->gadget);
            if (udc->gadget->irq)
                    synchronize_irq(udc->gadget->irq);
            udc->driver->unbind(udc->gadget);
            usb_gadget_udc_stop(udc);
    
    usb_gadget_disconnect turns off the pullup resistor, telling the host
    that the gadget is no longer connected and preventing the transmission
    of any more USB packets. Any packets that have already been received
    are sure to processed by the UDC driver's interrupt handler by the time
    synchronize_irq returns.
    
    But this doesn't work with dummy_hcd, because dummy_hcd doesn't use
    interrupts; it uses a timer instead. It does have code to emulate the
    effect of synchronize_irq, but that code doesn't get invoked at the
    right time -- it currently runs in usb_gadget_udc_stop, after the unbind
    callback instead of before. Indeed, there's no way for
    usb_gadget_remove_driver to invoke this code before the unbind callback.
    
    To fix this, move the synchronize_irq() emulation code to dummy_pullup
    so that it runs before unbind. Also, add a comment explaining why it is
    necessary to have it there.

    commit a149d2a5cabbf6507a7832a1c4fd2593c55fd450 upstream.
    
    Commit <50122847007> ("ext4: fix check to prevent initializing reserved
    inodes") check the block group zero and prevent initializing reserved
    inodes. But in some special cases, the reserved inode may not all belong
    to the group zero, it may exist into the second group if we format
    filesystem below.
    
      mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -g 8192 -N 1024 -I 4096 /dev/sda
    
    So, it will end up triggering a false positive report of a corrupted
    file system. This patch fix it by avoid check reserved inodes if no free
    inode blocks will be zeroed.

    ftrace: Handle commands when closing set_ftrace_filter file
    
    commit 8c9af478c06bb1ab1422f90d8ecbc53defd44bc3 upstream.
    
     # echo switch_mm:traceoff > /sys/kernel/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
    
    will cause switch_mm to stop tracing by the traceoff command.
    
     # echo -n switch_mm:traceoff > /sys/kernel/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
    
    does nothing.
    
    The reason is that the parsing in the write function only processes
    commands if it finished parsing (there is white space written after the
    command). That's to handle:
    
     write(fd, "switch_mm:", 10);
     write(fd, "traceoff", 8);
    
    cases, where the command is broken over multiple writes.
    
    The problem is if the file descriptor is closed, then the write call is
    not processed, and the command needs to be processed in the release code.
    The release code can handle matching of functions, but does not handle
    commands.

    Revert 337f13046ff0 ("futex: Allow FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME with FUTEX_WAIT op")
    
    commit 4fbf5d6837bf81fd7a27d771358f4ee6c4f243f8 upstream.
    
    The FUTEX_WAIT operand has historically a relative timeout which means that
    the clock id is irrelevant as relative timeouts on CLOCK_REALTIME are not
    subject to wall clock changes and therefore are mapped by the kernel to
    CLOCK_MONOTONIC for simplicity.
    
    If a caller would set FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME for FUTEX_WAIT the timeout is
    still treated relative vs. CLOCK_MONOTONIC and then the wait arms that
    timeout based on CLOCK_REALTIME which is broken and obviously has never
    been used or even tested.
    
    Reject any attempt to use FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME with FUTEX_WAIT again.
    
    The desired functionality can be achieved with FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET and a
    FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY argument.

    because when dstlen == 1, cpage_out will write array out of bounds.
    Actually, data will not be compressed in jffs2_zlib_compress() if
    data's length less than 4.

    powerpc: fix EDEADLOCK redefinition error in uapi/asm/errno.h
    
    commit 7de21e679e6a789f3729e8402bc440b623a28eae upstream.
    
    A few archs like powerpc have different errno.h values for macros
    EDEADLOCK and EDEADLK. In code including both libc and linux versions of
    errno.h, this can result in multiple definitions of EDEADLOCK in the
    include chain. Definitions to the same value (e.g. seen with mips) do
    not raise warnings, but on powerpc there are redefinitions changing the
    value, which raise warnings and errors (if using "-Werror").
    
    Guard against these redefinitions to avoid build errors like the following,
    first seen cross-compiling libbpf v5.8.9 for powerpc using GCC 8.4.0 with
    musl 1.1.24:
    
      In file included from ../../arch/powerpc/include/uapi/asm/errno.h:5,
                       from ../../include/linux/err.h:8,
                       from libbpf.c:29:
      ../../include/uapi/asm-generic/errno.h:40: error: "EDEADLOCK" redefined [-Werror]

    commit 5ae5bc12d0728db60a0aa9b62160ffc038875f1a upstream.
    
    During the EEH MMIO error checking, the current implementation fails to map
    the (virtual) MMIO address back to the pci device on radix with hugepage
    mappings for I/O. This results into failure to dispatch EEH event with no
    recovery even when EEH capability has been enabled on the device.
    
    eeh_check_failure(token)                # token = virtual MMIO address
      addr = eeh_token_to_phys(token);
      edev = eeh_addr_cache_get_dev(addr);
      if (!edev)
            return 0;
      eeh_dev_check_failure(edev);  <= Dispatch the EEH event
    
    In case of hugepage mappings, eeh_token_to_phys() has a bug in virt -> phys
    translation that results in wrong physical address, which is then passed to
    eeh_addr_cache_get_dev() to match it against cached pci I/O address ranges
    to get to a PCI device. Hence, it fails to find a match and the EEH event
    never gets dispatched leaving the device in failed state.
    
    The commit 33439620680be ("powerpc/eeh: Handle hugepages in ioremap space")
    introduced following logic to translate virt to phys for hugepage mappings:
    
    eeh_token_to_phys():
    +       pa = pte_pfn(*ptep);
    +
    +       /* On radix we can do hugepage mappings for io, so handle that */
    +       if (hugepage_shift) {
    +               pa <<= hugepage_shift;                  <= This is wrong
    +               pa |= token & ((1ul << hugepage_shift) - 1);
    +       }
    
    This patch fixes the virt -> phys translation in eeh_token_to_phys()
    function.

    Before this patch:
    
    Tracing 'arg1' of function eeh_addr_cache_get_dev() during error injection
    clearly shows that 'addr=' contains wrong physical address:

    jffs2: Fix kasan slab-out-of-bounds problem
    
    commit 960b9a8a7676b9054d8b46a2c7db52a0c8766b56 upstream.
    
    KASAN report a slab-out-of-bounds problem. The logs are listed below.
    It is because in function jffs2_scan_dirent_node, we alloc "checkedlen+1"
    bytes for fd->name and we check crc with length rd->nsize. If checkedlen
    is less than rd->nsize, it will cause the slab-out-of-bounds problem.

    NFSv4: Don't discard segments marked for return in _pnfs_return_layout()
    
    commit de144ff4234f935bd2150108019b5d87a90a8a96 upstream.
    
    If the pNFS layout segment is marked with the NFS_LSEG_LAYOUTRETURN
    flag, then the assumption is that it has some reporting requirement
    to perform through a layoutreturn (e.g. flexfiles layout stats or error
    information).

    for IPv4 packets, ovs_fragment() uses a temporary struct dst_entry. Then,
    in the following call graph:
    
      ip_do_fragment()
        ip_skb_dst_mtu()
          ip_dst_mtu_maybe_forward()
            ip_mtu_locked()
    
    the pointer to struct dst_entry is used as pointer to struct rtable: this
    turns the access to struct members like rt_mtu_locked into an OOB read in
    the stack. Fix this changing the temporary variable used for IPv4 packets
    in ovs_fragment(), similarly to what is done for IPv6 few lines below.

    arm64/vdso: Discard .note.gnu.property sections in vDSO
    
    [ Upstream commit 388708028e6937f3fc5fc19aeeb847f8970f489c ]
    
    The arm64 assembler in binutils 2.32 and above generates a program
    property note in a note section, .note.gnu.property, to encode used x86
    ISAs and features. But the kernel linker script only contains a single
    NOTE segment:
    
      PHDRS
      {
        text    PT_LOAD    FLAGS(5) FILEHDR PHDRS; /* PF_R|PF_X */
        dynamic PT_DYNAMIC FLAGS(4);               /* PF_R */
        note    PT_NOTE    FLAGS(4);               /* PF_R */
      }
    
    The NOTE segment generated by the vDSO linker script is aligned to 4 bytes.
    But the .note.gnu.property section must be aligned to 8 bytes on arm64.
    
      $ readelf -n vdso64.so
    
      Displaying notes found in: .note
        Owner                Data size      Description
        Linux                0x00000004     Unknown note type: (0x00000000)

      readelf: Warning:  type: 0x78, namesize: 0x00000100, descsize: 0x756e694c, alignment: 8
    
    Since the note.gnu.property section in the vDSO is not checked by the
    dynamic linker, discard the .note.gnu.property sections in the vDSO.
    
    Similar to commit 4caffe6a28d31 ("x86/vdso: Discard .note.gnu.property
    sections in vDSO"), but for arm64.

    ALSA: sb: Fix two use after free in snd_sb_qsound_build
    
    commit 4fb44dd2c1dda18606348acdfdb97e8759dde9df upstream.
    
    In snd_sb_qsound_build, snd_ctl_add(..,p->qsound_switch...) and
    snd_ctl_add(..,p->qsound_space..) are called. But the second
    arguments of snd_ctl_add() could be freed via snd_ctl_add_replace()
    ->snd_ctl_free_one(). After the error code is returned,
    snd_sb_qsound_destroy(p) is called in __error branch.
    
    But in snd_sb_qsound_destroy(), the freed p->qsound_switch and
    p->qsound_space are still used by snd_ctl_remove().
    
    My patch set p->qsound_switch and p->qsound_space to NULL if
    snd_ctl_add() failed to avoid the uaf bugs. But these codes need
    to further be improved with the code style.

    ALSA: emu8000: Fix a use after free in snd_emu8000_create_mixer
    
    commit 1c98f574403dbcf2eb832d5535a10d967333ef2d upstream.
    
    Our code analyzer reported a uaf.
    
    In snd_emu8000_create_mixer, the callee snd_ctl_add(..,emu->controls[i])
    calls snd_ctl_add_replace(.., kcontrol,..). Inside snd_ctl_add_replace(),
    if error happens, kcontrol will be freed by snd_ctl_free_one(kcontrol).
    Then emu->controls[i] points to a freed memory, and the execution comes
    to __error branch of snd_emu8000_create_mixer. The freed emu->controls[i]
    is used in snd_ctl_remove(card, emu->controls[i]).
    
    My patch set emu->controls[i] to NULL if snd_ctl_add() failed to avoid
    the uaf.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix crash when a REG_RPI mailbox fails triggering a LOGO response
    
    [ Upstream commit fffd18ec6579c2d9c72b212169259062fe747888 ]
    
    Fix a crash caused by a double put on the node when the driver completed an
    ACC for an unsolicted abort on the same node.  The second put was executed
    by lpfc_nlp_not_used() and is wrong because the completion routine executes
    the nlp_put when the iocbq was released.  Additionally, the driver is
    issuing a LOGO then immediately calls lpfc_nlp_set_state to put the node
    into NPR.  This call does nothing.
    
    Remove the lpfc_nlp_not_used call and additional set_state in the
    completion routine.  Remove the lpfc_nlp_set_state post issue_logo.  Isn't
    necessary.

    drm/msm/mdp5: Configure PP_SYNC_HEIGHT to double the vtotal
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ad52bdb220de5ab348098e3482b01235d15a842 ]
    
    Leaving this at a close-to-maximum register value 0xFFF0 means it takes
    very long for the MDSS to generate a software vsync interrupt when the
    hardware TE interrupt doesn't arrive.  Configuring this to double the
    vtotal (like some downstream kernels) leads to a frame to take at most
    twice before the vsync signal, until hardware TE comes up.
    
    In this case the hardware interrupt responsible for providing this
    signal - "disp-te" gpio - is not hooked up to the mdp5 vsync/pp logic at
    all.  This solves severe panel update issues observed on at least the
    Xperia Loire and Tone series, until said gpio is properly hooked up to
    an irq.

    [ Upstream commit 4f4e6644cd876c844cdb3bea2dd7051787d5ae25 ]
    
    For two of the supported sensors the stv06xx driver allocates memory which
    is stored in sd->sensor_priv. This memory is freed on a disconnect, but if
    the probe() fails, then it isn't freed and so this leaks memory.
    
    Add a new probe_error() op that drivers can use to free any allocated
    memory in case there was a probe failure.
    
    Thanks to Pavel Skripkin <paskripkin@gmail.com> for discovering the cause
    of the memory leak.

    [ Upstream commit b7cd0da982e3043f2eec7235ac5530cb18d6af1d ]
    
    syzbot reported memory leak in dvb-usb. The problem was
    in invalid error handling in dvb_usb_adapter_init().
    
    for (n = 0; n < d->props.num_adapters; n++) {
    ....
            if ((ret = dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init(adap)) ||
                    (ret = dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init(adap, adapter_nrs)) ||
                    (ret = dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init(adap))) {
                    return ret;
            }
    ...
            d->num_adapters_initialized++;
    ...
    }
    
    In case of error in dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init() or
    dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init() d->num_adapters_initialized won't be
    incremented, but dvb_usb_adapter_exit() relies on it:
    
            for (n = 0; n < d->num_adapters_initialized; n++)
    
    So, allocated objects won't be freed.

    This driver's remove path calls cancel_delayed_work(). However, that
    function does not wait until the work function finishes. This means
    that the callback function may still be running after the driver's
    remove function has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.
    
    Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that
    the work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable
    to re-schedule itself.

    If some error occurs, URB buffers should also be freed. If they aren't
    freed with the dvb here, the em28xx_dvb_fini call doesn't frees the URB
    buffers as dvb is set to NULL. The function in which error occurs should
    do all the cleanup for the allocations it had done.

    extcon: arizona: Fix some issues when HPDET IRQ fires after the jack has been unplugged
    
    [ Upstream commit c309a3e8793f7e01c4a4ec7960658380572cb576 ]
    
    When the jack is partially inserted and then removed again it may be
    removed while the hpdet code is running. In this case the following
    may happen:
    
    1. The "JACKDET rise" or ""JACKDET fall" IRQ triggers
    2. arizona_jackdet runs and takes info->lock
    3. The "HPDET" IRQ triggers
    4. arizona_hpdet_irq runs, blocks on info->lock
    5. arizona_jackdet calls arizona_stop_mic() and clears info->hpdet_done
    6. arizona_jackdet releases info->lock
    7. arizona_hpdet_irq now can continue running and:
    7.1 Calls arizona_start_mic() (if a mic was detected)
    7.2 sets info->hpdet_done
    
    Step 7 is undesirable / a bug:
    7.1 causes the device to stay in a high power-state (with MICVDD enabled)
    7.2 causes hpdet to not run on the next jack insertion, which in turn
        causes the EXTCON_JACK_HEADPHONE state to never get set
    
    This fixes both issues by skipping these 2 steps when arizona_hpdet_irq
    runs after the jack has been unplugged.

    x86/build: Propagate $(CLANG_FLAGS) to $(REALMODE_FLAGS)
    
    [ Upstream commit 8abe7fc26ad8f28bfdf78adbed56acd1fa93f82d ]
    
    When cross-compiling with Clang, the `$(CLANG_FLAGS)' variable
    contains additional flags needed to build C and assembly sources
    for the target platform. Normally this variable is automatically
    included in `$(KBUILD_CFLAGS)' via the top-level Makefile.
    
    The x86 real-mode makefile builds `$(REALMODE_CFLAGS)' from a
    plain assignment and therefore drops the Clang flags. This causes
    Clang to not recognize x86-specific assembler directives:
    
      arch/x86/realmode/rm/header.S:36:1: error: unknown directive
      .type real_mode_header STT_OBJECT ; .size real_mode_header, .-real_mode_header
      ^
    
    Explicit propagation of `$(CLANG_FLAGS)' to `$(REALMODE_CFLAGS)',
    which is inherited by real-mode make rules, fixes cross-compilation
    with Clang for x86 targets.
    
    Relevant flags:
    
    * `--target' sets the target architecture when cross-compiling. This
      flag must be set for both compilation and assembly (`KBUILD_AFLAGS')
      to support architecture-specific assembler directives.
    
    * `-no-integrated-as' tells clang to assemble with GNU Assembler
      instead of its built-in LLVM assembler. This flag is set by default
      unless `LLVM_IAS=1' is set, because the LLVM assembler can't yet
      parse certain GNU extensions.

    PCI: PM: Do not read power state in pci_enable_device_flags()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4514d991d99211f225d83b7e640285f29f0755d0 ]
    
    It should not be necessary to update the current_state field of
    struct pci_dev in pci_enable_device_flags() before calling
    do_pci_enable_device() for the device, because none of the
    code between that point and the pci_set_power_state() call in
    do_pci_enable_device() invoked later depends on it.
    
    Moreover, doing that is actively harmful in some cases.  For example,
    if the given PCI device depends on an ACPI power resource whose _STA
    method initially returns 0 ("off"), but the config space of the PCI
    device is accessible and the power state retrieved from the
    PCI_PM_CTRL register is D0, the current_state field in the struct
    pci_dev representing that device will get out of sync with the
    power.state of its ACPI companion object and that will lead to
    power management issues going forward.
    
    To avoid such issues it is better to leave the current_state value
    as is until it is changed to PCI_D0 by do_pci_enable_device() as
    appropriate.  However, the power state of the device is not changed
    to PCI_D0 if it is already enabled when pci_enable_device_flags()
    gets called for it, so update its current_state in that case, but
    use pci_update_current_state() covering platform PM too for that.

    usb: xhci: Fix port minor revision
    
    [ Upstream commit 64364bc912c01b33bba6c22e3ccb849bfca96398 ]
    
    Some hosts incorrectly use sub-minor version for minor version (i.e.
    0x02 instead of 0x20 for bcdUSB 0x320 and 0x01 for bcdUSB 0x310).
    Currently the xHCI driver works around this by just checking for minor
    revision > 0x01 for USB 3.1 everywhere. With the addition of USB 3.2,
    checking this gets a bit cumbersome. Since there is no USB release with
    bcdUSB 0x301 to 0x309, we can assume that sub-minor version 01 to 09 is
    incorrect. Let's try to fix this and use the minor revision that matches
    with the USB/xHCI spec to help with the version checking within the
    driver.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Ignore EP queue requests during bus reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 71ca43f30df9c642970f9dc9b2d6f463f4967e7b ]
    
    The current dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt() will stop any active
    transfers, but only addresses blocking of EP queuing for while we are
    coming from a disconnected scenario, i.e. after receiving the disconnect
    event.  If the host decides to issue a bus reset on the device, the
    connected parameter will still be set to true, allowing for EP queuing
    to continue while we are disabling the functions.  To avoid this, set the
    connected flag to false until the stop active transfers is complete.

    [ Upstream commit 26adde04acdff14a1f28d4a5dce46a8513a3038b ]
    
    Patch adds extra checking for bInterval passed by configfs.
    The 5.6.4 chapter of USB Specification (rev. 2.0) say:
    "A high-bandwidth endpoint must specify a period of 1x125 µs
    (i.e., a bInterval value of 1)."
    
    The issue was observed during testing UVC class on CV.
    I treat this change as improvement because we can control
    bInterval by configfs.

    btrfs: fix metadata extent leak after failure to create subvolume
    
    commit 67addf29004c5be9fa0383c82a364bb59afc7f84 upstream.
    
    When creating a subvolume we allocate an extent buffer for its root node
    after starting a transaction. We setup a root item for the subvolume that
    points to that extent buffer and then attempt to insert the root item into
    the root tree - however if that fails, due to ENOMEM for example, we do
    not free the extent buffer previously allocated and we do not abort the
    transaction (as at that point we did nothing that can not be undone).
    
    This means that we effectively do not return the metadata extent back to
    the free space cache/tree and we leave a delayed reference for it which
    causes a metadata extent item to be added to the extent tree, in the next
    transaction commit, without having backreferences. When this happens
    'btrfs check' reports the following:
    
      $ btrfs check /dev/sdi
      Opening filesystem to check...
      Checking filesystem on /dev/sdi

    So fix this by freeing the metadata extent if btrfs_insert_root() returns
    an error.

    Some of SD cards sets permanent write protection bit in their CSD register,
    due to lifespan or internal problem. To avoid unnecessary I/O write
    operations, let's parse the bits in the CSD during initialization and mark
    the card as read only for this case.

    mmc: core: Do a power cycle when the CMD11 fails
    
    commit 147186f531ae49c18b7a9091a2c40e83b3d95649 upstream.
    
    A CMD11 is sent to the SD/SDIO card to start the voltage switch procedure
    into 1.8V I/O. According to the SD spec a power cycle is needed of the
    card, if it turns out that the CMD11 fails. Let's fix this, to allow a
    retry of the initialization without the voltage switch, to succeed.
    
    Note that, whether it makes sense to also retry with the voltage switch
    after the power cycle is a bit more difficult to know. At this point, we
    treat it like the CMD11 isn't supported and therefore we skip it when
    retrying.

    When mounting eCryptfs, a null "dev_name" argument to ecryptfs_mount()

    platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Correct thermal sensor allocation
    
    commit 6759e18e5cd8745a5dfc5726e4a3db5281ec1639 upstream.
    
    On recent Thinkpad platforms it was reported that temp sensor 11 was
    always incorrectly displaying 66C. It turns out the reason for this is
    that this location in EC RAM is not a temperature sensor but is the
    power supply ID (offset 0xC2).
    
    Based on feedback from the Lenovo firmware team the EC RAM version can
    be determined and for the current version (3) only the 0x78 to 0x7F
    range is used for temp sensors. I don't have any details for earlier
    versions so I have left the implementation unaltered there.
    
    Note - in this block only 0x78 and 0x79 are officially designated (CPU &
    GPU sensors). The use of the other locations in the block will vary from
    platform to platform; but the existing logic to detect a sensor presence
    holds.

    USB: Add reset-resume quirk for WD19's Realtek Hub
    
    commit ca91fd8c7643d93bfc18a6fec1a0d3972a46a18a upstream.
    
    Realtek Hub (0bda:5487) in Dell Dock WD19 sometimes fails to work
    after the system resumes from suspend with remote wakeup enabled
    device connected:
    [ 1947.640907] hub 5-2.3:1.0: hub_ext_port_status failed (err = -71)
    [ 1947.641208] usb 5-2.3-port5: cannot disable (err = -71)
    [ 1947.641401] hub 5-2.3:1.0: hub_ext_port_status failed (err = -71)
    [ 1947.641450] usb 5-2.3-port4: cannot reset (err = -71)
    
    Information of this hub:
    T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#= 10 Spd=480  MxCh= 5
    D:  Ver= 2.10 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=02 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1
    P:  Vendor=0bda ProdID=5487 Rev= 1.47
    S:  Manufacturer=Dell Inc.
    S:  Product=Dell dock
    C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=e0 MxPwr=  0mA
    I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=hub
    E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   1 Ivl=256ms
    I:* If#= 0 Alt= 1 #EPs= 1 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=02 Driver=hub
    E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   1 Ivl=256ms
    
    The failure results from the ETIMEDOUT by chance when turning on
    the suspend feature for the specified port of the hub. The port
    seems to be in an unknown state so the hub_activate during resume
    fails the hub_port_status, then the hub will fail to work.
    
    The quirky hub needs the reset-resume quirk to function correctly.

    iwlwifi: Fix softirq/hardirq disabling in iwl_pcie_enqueue_hcmd()
    
    commit 2800aadc18a64c96b051bcb7da8a7df7d505db3f upstream.
    
    It's possible for iwl_pcie_enqueue_hcmd() to be called with hard IRQs
    disabled (e.g. from LED core). We can't enable BHs in such a situation.
    
    Turn the unconditional BH-enable/BH-disable code into
    hardirq-disable/conditional-enable.
    
    This fixes the warning below.
