    ARM: 7938/1: OMAP4/highbank: Flush L2 cache before disabling
    
    commit b25f3e1c358434bf850220e04f28eebfc45eb634 upstream.
    
    Kexec disables outer cache before jumping to reboot code, but it doesn't
    flush it explicitly. Flush is done implicitly inside of l2x0_disable().
    But some SoC's override default .disable handler and don't flush cache.
    This may lead to a corrupted memory during Kexec reboot on these
    platforms.
    
    This patch adds cache flush inside of OMAP4 and Highbank outer_cache.disable()
    handlers to make it consistent with default l2x0_disable().

    drm/i915: Don't grab crtc mutexes in intel_modeset_gem_init()
    
    commit 7ad228b11ec26a820291c9f5a1168d6176580dc1 upstream.
    
    When the pipe A force quirk is applied the code will attempt to grab
    a crtc mutex during intel_modeset_setup_hw_state(). If we're already
    holding all crtc mutexes this will obviously deadlock every time.
    
    So instead of using drm_modeset_lock_all() just grab the
    mode_config.mutex. This is enough to avoid the unlocked mutex warnings
    from certain lower level functions.
    
    The regression was introduced in:

    serial: amba-pl011: use port lock to guard control register access
    
    commit fe43390702a1b5741fdf217063b05c7612b38303 upstream.
    
    When the pl011 is being used for a console, pl011_console_write forces
    the control register (CR) to enable the UART for transmission and then
    restores this to the original value afterwards. It does this while
    holding the port lock.
    
    Unfortunately, when the uart is started or shutdown - say in response to
    userland using the serial device for a terminal - then this updates the
    control register without any locking.
    
    This means we can have
    
      pl011_console_write   Save CR
      pl011_startup         Initialise CR, e.g. enable receive
      pl011_console_write   Restore old CR with receive not enabled
    
    this result is a serial port which doesn't respond to any input.
    
    A similar race in reverse could happen when the device is shutdown.
    
    We can fix these problems by taking the port lock when updating CR.

    mm: Make {,set}page_address() static inline if WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL
    
    commit f92f455f67fef27929e6043499414605b0c94872 upstream.
    
    {,set}page_address() are macros if WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL.  If
    !WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL, they're plain C functions.
    
    If someone calls them with a void *, this pointer is auto-converted to
    struct page * if !WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL, but causes a build failure on
    architectures using WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL (arc, m68k and sparc64):
    
      drivers/md/bcache/bset.c: In function `__btree_sort':
      drivers/md/bcache/bset.c:1190: warning: dereferencing `void *' pointer
      drivers/md/bcache/bset.c:1190: error: request for member `virtual' in something not a structure or union
    
    Convert them to static inline functions to fix this.  There are already
    plenty of users of struct page members inside <linux/mm.h>, so there's
    no reason to keep them as macros.

    When those devices are removed and spares added the flags are still

    md/raid10: fix two bugs in handling of known-bad-blocks.
    
    commit b50c259e25d9260b9108dc0c2964c26e5ecbe1c1 upstream.
    
    If we discover a bad block when reading we split the request and
    potentially read some of it from a different device.
    
    The code path of this has two bugs in RAID10.
    1/ we get a spin_lock with _irq, but unlock without _irq!!
    2/ The calculation of 'sectors_handled' is wrong, as can be clearly
       seen by comparison with raid1.c
    
    This leads to at least 2 warnings and a probable crash is a RAID10
    ever had known bad blocks.

    Unfortunately this new case was placed *after* r10bio was freed rather
    than *before*, yet it still uses r10bio.
    This is will crash with a null dereference.
    
    So move the freeing of r10bio down where it is safe.

    md: fix problem when adding device to read-only array with bitmap.
    
    commit 8313b8e57f55b15e5b7f7fc5d1630bbf686a9a97 upstream.
    
    If an array is started degraded, and then the missing device
    is found it can be re-added and a minimal bitmap-based recovery
    will bring it fully up-to-date.
    
    If the array is read-only a recovery would not be allowed.
    But also if the array is read-only and the missing device was
    present very recently, then there could be no need for any
    recovery at all, so we simply include the device in the read-only
    array without any recovery.
    
    However... if the missing device was removed a little longer ago
    it could be missing some updates, but if a bitmap is present it will
    be conditionally accepted pending a bitmap-based update.  We don't
    currently detect this case properly and will include that old
    device into the read-only array with no recovery even though it really
    needs a recovery.
    
    This patch keeps track of whether a bitmap-based-recovery is really
    needed or not in the new Bitmap_sync rdev flag.  If that is set,
    then the device will not be added to a read-only array.

    nilfs2: fix segctor bug that causes file system corruption
    
    commit 70f2fe3a26248724d8a5019681a869abdaf3e89a upstream.
    
    There is a bug in the function nilfs_segctor_collect, which results in
    active data being written to a segment, that is marked as clean.  It is
    possible, that this segment is selected for a later segment
    construction, whereby the old data is overwritten.
    
    The problem shows itself with the following kernel log message:
    
      nilfs_sufile_do_cancel_free: segment 6533 must be clean
    
    Usually a few hours later the file system gets corrupted:
    
      NILFS: bad btree node (blocknr=8748107): level = 0, flags = 0x0, nchildren = 0
      NILFS error (device sdc1): nilfs_bmap_last_key: broken bmap (inode number=114660)
    
    The issue can be reproduced with a file system that is nearly full and
    with the cleaner running, while some IO intensive task is running.
    Although it is quite hard to reproduce.
    
    This is what happens:
    
     1. The cleaner starts the segment construction
     2. nilfs_segctor_collect is called
     3. sc_stage is on NILFS_ST_SUFILE and segments are freed
     4. sc_stage is on NILFS_ST_DAT current segment is full
     5. nilfs_segctor_extend_segments is called, which
        allocates a new segment
     6. The new segment is one of the segments freed in step 3
     7. nilfs_sufile_cancel_freev is called and produces an error message
     8. Loop around and the collection starts again
     9. sc_stage is on NILFS_ST_SUFILE and segments are freed
        including the newly allocated segment, which will contain active
        data and can be allocated at a later time
    10. A few hours later another segment construction allocates the
        segment and causes file system corruption
    
    This can be prevented by simply reordering the statements.  If
    nilfs_sufile_cancel_freev is called before nilfs_segctor_extend_segments
    the freed segments are marked as dirty and cannot be allocated any more.

    Investigating, I found that the inode->i_security was NULL, and the
    dereference of it caused the oops.
    
    in selinux_inode_permission():
    
            isec = inode->i_security;
    
            rc = avc_has_perm_noaudit(sid, isec->sid, isec->sclass, perms, 0, &avd);
    
    Note, the crash came from stressing the deletion and reading of debugfs
    files.  I was not able to recreate this via normal files.  But I'm not
    sure they are safe.  It may just be that the race window is much harder
    to hit.
    
    What seems to have happened (and what I have traced), is the file is
    being opened at the same time the file or directory is being deleted.
    As the dentry and inode locks are not held during the path walk, nor is
    the inodes ref counts being incremented, there is nothing saving these
    structures from being discarded except for an rcu_read_lock().
    
    The rcu_read_lock() protects against freeing of the inode, but it does
    not protect freeing of the inode_security_struct.  Now if the freeing of
    the i_security happens with a call_rcu(), and the i_security field of
    the inode is not changed (it gets freed as the inode gets freed) then
    there will be no issue here.  (Linus Torvalds suggested not setting the
    field to NULL such that we do not need to check if it is NULL in the
    permission check).
    
    Note, this is a hack, but it fixes the problem at hand.  A real fix is
    to restructure the destroy_inode() to call all the destructor handlers
    from the RCU callback.  But that is a major job to do, and requires a
    lot of work.  For now, we just band-aid this bug with this fix (it
    works), and work on a more maintainable solution in the future.

    writeback: Fix data corruption on NFS
    
    commit f9b0e058cbd04ada76b13afffa7e1df830543c24 upstream.
    
    Commit 4f8ad655dbc8 "writeback: Refactor writeback_single_inode()" added
    a condition to skip clean inode. However this is wrong in WB_SYNC_ALL
    mode because there we also want to wait for outstanding writeback on
    possibly clean inode. This was causing occasional data corruption issues
    on NFS because it uses sync_inode() to make sure all outstanding writes
    are flushed to the server before truncating the inode and with
    sync_inode() returning prematurely file was sometimes extended back
    by an outstanding write after it was truncated.
    
    So modify the test to also check for pages under writeback in
    WB_SYNC_ALL mode.

    When the core number exceeds 9, the size of the buffer storing the
    alarm attribute name is insufficient and the attribute name is
    truncated. This causes libsensors to skip these attributes as the

    The symlink /proc/<pid>/ns/{ipc,mnt,net,pid,user,uts} point to
    dentries allocated with d_alloc_pseudo that we can mount, and
    that have interesting names printed out with d_dname.
    
    When these files are bind mounted /proc/mounts is not currently
    displaying the mount point correctly because d_dname is called instead
    of just displaying the path where the file is mounted.
    
    Solve this by adding an explicit check to distinguish mounted pseudo
    inodes and unmounted pseudo inodes.  Unmounted pseudo inodes always
    use mount of their filesstem as the mnt_root  in their path making
    these two cases easy to distinguish.

    GFS2: Increase i_writecount during gfs2_setattr_chown
    
    commit 62e96cf81988101fe9e086b2877307b6adda5197 upstream.
    
    This patch calls get_write_access in function gfs2_setattr_chown,
    which merely increases inode->i_writecount for the duration of the
    function. That will ensure that any file closes won't delete the
    inode's multi-block reservation while the function is running.
    It also ensures that a multi-block reservation exists when needed
    for quota change operations during the chown.

    perf/x86/amd/ibs: Fix waking up from S3 for AMD family 10h
    
    commit bee09ed91cacdbffdbcd3b05de8409c77ec9fcd6 upstream.
    
    On AMD family 10h we see following error messages while waking up from
    S3 for all non-boot CPUs leading to a failed IBS initialization:
    
     Enabling non-boot CPUs ...
     smpboot: Booting Node 0 Processor 1 APIC 0x1
     [Firmware Bug]: cpu 1, try to use APIC500 (LVT offset 0) for vector 0x400, but the register is already in use for vector 0xf9 on another cpu
     perf: IBS APIC setup failed on cpu #1
     process: Switch to broadcast mode on CPU1
     CPU1 is up
     ...
     ACPI: Waking up from system sleep state S3
    
    Reason for this is that during suspend the LVT offset for the IBS
    vector gets lost and needs to be reinialized while resuming.
    
    The offset is read from the IBSCTL msr. On family 10h the offset needs
    to be 1 as offset 0 is used for the MCE threshold interrupt, but
    firmware assings it for IBS to 0 too. The kernel needs to reprogram
    the vector. The msr is a readonly node msr, but a new value can be
    written via pci config space access. The reinitialization is
    implemented for family 10h in setup_ibs_ctl() which is forced during
    IBS setup.
    
    This patch fixes IBS setup after waking up from S3 by adding
    resume/supend hooks for the boot cpu which does the offset
    reinitialization.
    
    Marking it as stable to let distros pick up this fix.
