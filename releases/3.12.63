    module: Invalidate signatures on force-loaded modules
    
    commit bca014caaa6130e57f69b5bf527967aa8ee70fdd upstream.
    
    Signing a module should only make it trusted by the specific kernel it
    was built for, not anything else.  Loading a signed module meant for a
    kernel with a different ABI could have interesting effects.
    Therefore, treat all signatures as invalid when a module is
    force-loaded.

    dm flakey: error READ bios during the down_interval
    
    commit 99f3c90d0d85708e7401a81ce3314e50bf7f2819 upstream.
    
    When the corrupt_bio_byte feature was introduced it caused READ bios to
    no longer be errored with -EIO during the down_interval.  This had to do
    with the complexity of needing to submit READs if the corrupt_bio_byte
    feature was used.
    
    Fix it so READ bios are properly errored with -EIO; doing so early in
    flakey_map() as long as there isn't a match for the corrupt_bio_byte
    feature.

    ubi: Make volume resize power cut aware
    
    commit 4946784bd3924b1374f05eebff2fd68660bae866 upstream.
    
    When the volume resize operation shrinks a volume,
    LEBs will be unmapped. Since unmapping will not erase these
    LEBs immediately we have to wait for that operation to finish.
    Otherwise in case of a power cut right after writing the new
    volume table the UBI attach process can find more LEBs than the
    volume table knows. This will render the UBI image unattachable.
    
    Fix this issue by waiting for erase to complete and write the new
    volume table afterward.

    commit c9b254955b9f8814966f5dabd34c39d0e0a2b437 upstream.
    
    If the caller specified IB_SEND_FENCE in the send flags of the work
    request and no previous work request stated that the successive one
    should be fenced, the work request would be executed without a fence.
    This could result in RDMA read or atomic operations failure due to a MR
    being invalidated. Fix this by adding the mlx5 enumeration for fencing
    RDMA/atomic operations and fix the logic to apply this.

    metag: Fix __cmpxchg_u32 asm constraint for CMP
    
    commit 6154c187b97ee7513046bb4eb317a89f738f13ef upstream.
    
    The LNKGET based atomic sequence in __cmpxchg_u32 has slightly incorrect
    constraints for the return value which under certain circumstances can
    allow an address unit register to be used as the first operand of a CMP
    instruction. This isn't a valid instruction however as the encodings
    only allow a data unit to be specified. This would result in an
    assembler error like the following:
    
      Error: failed to assemble instruction: "CMP A0.2,D0Ar6"
    
    Fix by changing the constraint from "=&da" (assigned, early clobbered,
    data or address unit register) to "=&d" (data unit register only).
    
    The constraint for the second operand, "bd" (an op2 register where op1
    is a data unit register and the instruction supports O2R) is already
    correct assuming the first operand is a data unit register.
    
    Other cases of CMP in inline asm have had their constraints checked, and
    appear to all be fine.

    balloon: check the number of available pages in leak balloon
    
    commit 37cf99e08c6fb4dcea0f9ad2b13b6daa8c76a711 upstream.
    
    The balloon has a special mechanism that is subscribed to the oom
    notification which leads to deflation for a fixed number of pages.
    The number is always fixed even when the balloon is fully deflated.
    But leak_balloon did not expect that the pages to deflate will be more
    than taken, and raise a "BUG" in balloon_page_dequeue when page list
    will be empty.
    
    So, the simplest solution would be to check that the number of releases
    pages is less or equal to the number taken pages.

    drm/i915/dp: Revert "drm/i915/dp: fall back to 18 bpp when sink capability is unknown"
    
    commit 196f954e250943df414efd3d632254c29be38e59 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 013dd9e03872
    ("drm/i915/dp: fall back to 18 bpp when sink capability is unknown")
    
    This commit introduced a regression into stable kernels,
    as it reduces output color depth to 6 bpc for any video
    sink connected to a Displayport connector if that sink
    doesn't report a specific color depth via EDID, or if
    our EDID parser doesn't actually recognize the proper
    bpc from EDID.
    
    Affected are active DisplayPort->VGA converters and
    active DisplayPort->DVI converters. Both should be
    able to handle 8 bpc, but are degraded to 6 bpc with
    this patch.
    
    The reverted commit was meant to fix
    Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105331
    
    A followup patch implements a fix for that specific bug,
    which is caused by a faulty EDID of the affected DP panel
    by adding a new EDID quirk for that panel.
    
    DP 18 bpp fallback handling and other improvements to
    DP sink bpc detection will be handled for future
    kernels in a separate series of patches.
    
    Please backport to stable.

    drm/radeon: Poll for both connect/disconnect on analog connectors
    
    commit 14ff8d48f2235295dfb3117693008e367b49cdb5 upstream.
    
    DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_CONNECT only enables polling for connections, not
    disconnections. Because of this, we end up losing hotplug polling for
    analog connectors once they get connected.
    
    Easy way to reproduce:
     - Grab a machine with a radeon GPU and a VGA port
     - Plug a monitor into the VGA port, wait for it to update the connector
       from disconnected to connected
     - Disconnect the monitor on VGA, a hotplug event is never sent for the
       removal of the connector.
    
    Originally, only using DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_CONNECT might have been a good
    idea since doing VGA polling can sometimes result in having to mess with
    the DAC voltages to figure out whether or not there's actually something
    there since VGA doesn't have HPD. Doing this would have the potential of
    showing visible artifacts on the screen every time we ran a poll while a
    VGA display was connected. Luckily, radeon_vga_detect() only resorts to
    this sort of polling if the poll is forced, and DRM's polling helper
    doesn't force it's polls.
    
    Additionally, this removes some assignments to connector->polled that
    weren't actually doing anything.

    ARM: 8579/1: mm: Fix definition of pmd_mknotpresent
    
    commit 56530f5d2ddc9b9fade7ef8db9cb886e9dc689b5 upstream.
    
    Currently pmd_mknotpresent will use a zero entry to respresent an
    invalidated pmd.
    
    Unfortunately this definition clashes with pmd_none, thus it is
    possible for a race condition to occur if zap_pmd_range sees pmd_none
    whilst __split_huge_pmd_locked is running too with pmdp_invalidate
    just called.
    
    This patch fixes the race condition by modifying pmd_mknotpresent to
    create non-zero faulting entries (as is done in other architectures),
    removing the ambiguity with pmd_none.

    NFS doesn't expect requests with wb_bytes set to zero and may make
    unexpected decisions about how to handle that request at the page IO layer.
    Skip request creation if we won't have any wb_bytes in the request.

    commit b1132deac01c2332d234fa821a70022796b79182 upstream.
    
    get_random_long() reads from the get_random_int_hash array using an
    unsigned long pointer.  For this code to be guaranteed correct on all
    architectures, the array must be aligned to an unsigned long boundary.

    cifs: fix crash due to race in hmac(md5) handling
    
    commit bd975d1eead2558b76e1079e861eacf1f678b73b upstream.
    
    The secmech hmac(md5) structures are present in the TCP_Server_Info
    struct and can be shared among multiple CIFS sessions.  However, the
    server mutex is not currently held when these structures are allocated
    and used, which can lead to a kernel crashes, as in the scenario below:
    
    mount.cifs(8) #1                                mount.cifs(8) #2

    cifs: Check for existing directory when opening file with O_CREAT
    
    commit 8d9535b6efd86e6c07da59f97e68f44efb7fe080 upstream.
    
    When opening a file with O_CREAT flag, check to see if the file opened
    is an existing directory.
    
    This prevents the directory from being opened which subsequently causes
    a crash when the close function for directories cifs_closedir() is called
    which frees up the file->private_data memory while the file is still
    listed on the open file list for the tcon.

    Device 's5p-mfc-l' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed.
    
    Also, the declared DMA memory using dma_declare_coherent_memory() isn't

    usb: renesas_usbhs: protect the CFIFOSEL setting in usbhsg_ep_enable()
    
    commit 15e4292a2d21e9997fdb2b8c014cc461b3f268f0 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue that the CFIFOSEL register value is possible
    to be changed by usbhsg_ep_enable() wrongly. And then, a data transfer
    using CFIFO may not work correctly.
    
    For example:
     # modprobe g_multi file=usb-storage.bin
     # ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.1 up
     (During the USB host is sending file to the mass storage)
     # ifconfig usb0 down
    
    In this case, since the u_ether.c may call usb_ep_enable() in
    eth_stop(), if the renesas_usbhs driver is also using CFIFO for
    mass storage, the mass storage may not work correctly.
    
    So, this patch adds usbhs_lock() and usbhs_unlock() calling in
    usbhsg_ep_enable() to protect CFIFOSEL register. This is because:
     - CFIFOSEL.CURPIPE = 0 is also needed for the pipe configuration
     - The CFIFOSEL (fifo->sel) is already protected by usbhs_lock()

    ext4: fix reference counting bug on block allocation error

    then ext4_mb_new_blocks() will call ext4_mb_release_context() and try to
    continue. However, ext4_mb_release_context() is the wrong thing to call
    here since we are still actually using the allocation context.
    
    Instead, just error out. We could retry the allocation, but there is a
    possibility of getting stuck in an infinite loop instead, so this seems
    safer.

    ext4: don't call ext4_should_journal_data() on the journal inode
    
    commit 6a7fd522a7c94cdef0a3b08acf8e6702056e635c upstream.
    
    If ext4_fill_super() fails early, it's possible for ext4_evict_inode()
    to call ext4_should_journal_data() before superblock options and flags
    are fully set up.  In that case, the iput() on the journal inode can
    end up causing a BUG().
    
    Work around this problem by reordering the tests so we only call
    ext4_should_journal_data() after we know it's not the journal inode.

    ext4: fix deadlock during page writeback
    
    commit 646caa9c8e196880b41cd3e3d33a2ebc752bdb85 upstream.
    
    Commit 06bd3c36a733 (ext4: fix data exposure after a crash) uncovered a
    deadlock in ext4_writepages() which was previously much harder to hit.
    After this commit xfstest generic/130 reproduces the deadlock on small
    filesystems.
    
    The problem happens when ext4_do_update_inode() sets LARGE_FILE feature
    and marks current inode handle as synchronous. That subsequently results
    in ext4_journal_stop() called from ext4_writepages() to block waiting for
    transaction commit while still holding page locks, reference to io_end,
    and some prepared bio in mpd structure each of which can possibly block
    transaction commit from completing and thus results in deadlock.
    
    Fix the problem by releasing page locks, io_end reference, and
    submitting prepared bio before calling ext4_journal_stop().

    ext4: check for extents that wrap around
    
    commit f70749ca42943faa4d4dcce46dfdcaadb1d0c4b6 upstream.
    
    An extent with lblock = 4294967295 and len = 1 will pass the
    ext4_valid_extent() test:
    
            ext4_lblk_t last = lblock + len - 1;
    
            if (len == 0 || lblock > last)
                    return 0;
    
    since last = 4294967295 + 1 - 1 = 4294967295. This would later trigger
    the BUG_ON(es->es_lblk + es->es_len < es->es_lblk) in ext4_es_end().
    
    We can simplify it by removing the - 1 altogether and changing the test
    to use lblock + len <= lblock, since now if len = 0, then lblock + 0 ==
    lblock and it fails, and if len > 0 then lblock + len > lblock in order

    crypto: scatterwalk - Fix test in scatterwalk_done
    
    commit 5f070e81bee35f1b7bd1477bb223a873ff657803 upstream.
    
    When there is more data to be processed, the current test in
    scatterwalk_done may prevent us from calling pagedone even when
    we should.
    
    In particular, if we're on an SG entry spanning multiple pages
    where the last page is not a full page, we will incorrectly skip
    calling pagedone on the second last page.
    
    This patch fixes this by adding a separate test for whether we've
    reached the end of a page.

    crypto: gcm - Filter out async ghash if necessary
    
    commit b30bdfa86431afbafe15284a3ad5ac19b49b88e3 upstream.
    
    As it is if you ask for a sync gcm you may actually end up with
    an async one because it does not filter out async implementations
    of ghash.
    
    This patch fixes this by adding the necessary filter when looking
    for ghash.

    sysv, ipc: fix security-layer leaking
    
    commit 9b24fef9f0410fb5364245d6cc2bd044cc064007 upstream.
    
    Commit 53dad6d3a8e5 ("ipc: fix race with LSMs") updated ipc_rcu_putref()
    to receive rcu freeing function but used generic ipc_rcu_free() instead
    of msg_rcu_free() which does security cleaning.
    
    Running LTP msgsnd06 with kmemleak gives the following:
    
      cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak

    This problem can occur in the following situation:
    
    open()
     - pread()
        - .seq_start()
           - iter = kmalloc() // succeeds
           - seqf->private = iter
        - .seq_stop()
           - kfree(seqf->private)
     - pread()
        - .seq_start()
           - iter = kmalloc() // fails
        - .seq_stop()
           - class_dev_iter_exit(seqf->private) // boom! old pointer
    
    As the comment in disk_seqf_stop() says, stop is called even if start
    failed, so we need to reinitialise the private pointer to NULL when seq
    iteration stops.
    
    An alternative would be to set the private pointer to NULL when the
    kmalloc() in disk_seqf_start() fails.

    KEYS: 64-bit MIPS needs to use compat_sys_keyctl for 32-bit userspace
    
    commit 20f06ed9f61a185c6dabd662c310bed6189470df upstream.
    
    MIPS64 needs to use compat_sys_keyctl for 32-bit userspace rather than
    calling sys_keyctl.  The latter will work in a lot of cases, thereby hiding
    the issue.

    HID: i2c-hid: set power sleep before shutdown
    
    commit d9f448e3d71f3a703977196fa73be533b4b85adc upstream.
    
    Add i2c_hid_shutdown for i2c-hid driver to send suspend cmd & free
    irq before device shutdown.
    
    Some HW design (i.e. Umaro, a chromebook model) is that the power to
    i2c hid device won't down after device shutdown. Also the i2c-hid driver
    do not send suspend cmd to the hid i2c device and free its irq before
    shutdown.So if We touch the touchscreen or some other i2c hid device,
    the power consumtion will be go up even when the device is in shutdown
    state.
    
    Though the root cause maybe a HW issue. But it seems that it is a
    good pratice to set power sleep for i2c-hid device before shutdown.

    MIPS: KVM: Add missing gfn range check
    
    commit 8985d50382359e5bf118fdbefc859d0dbf6cebc7 upstream.
    
    kvm_mips_handle_mapped_seg_tlb_fault() calculates the guest frame number
    based on the guest TLB EntryLo values, however it is not range checked
    to ensure it lies within the guest_pmap. If the physical memory the
    guest refers to is out of range then dump the guest TLB and emit an
    internal error.

    MIPS: KVM: Fix mapped fault broken commpage handling
    
    commit c604cffa93478f8888bec62b23d6073dad03d43a upstream.
    
    kvm_mips_handle_mapped_seg_tlb_fault() appears to map the guest page at
    virtual address 0 to PFN 0 if the guest has created its own mapping
    there. The intention is unclear, but it may have been an attempt to
    protect the zero page from being mapped to anything but the comm page in
    code paths you wouldn't expect from genuine commpage accesses (guest
    kernel mode cache instructions on that address, hitting trapping
    instructions when executing from that address with a coincidental TLB
    eviction during the KVM handling, and guest user mode accesses to that
    address).
    
    Fix this to check for mappings exactly at KVM_GUEST_COMMPAGE_ADDR (it
    may not be at address 0 since commit 42aa12e74e91 ("MIPS: KVM: Move
    commpage so 0x0 is unmapped")), and set the corresponding EntryLo to be
    interpreted as 0 (invalid).

    tcp: consider recv buf for the initial window scale
    
    [ Upstream commit f626300a3e776ccc9671b0dd94698fb3aa315966 ]
    
    tcp_select_initial_window() intends to advertise a window
    scaling for the maximum possible window size. To do so,
    it considers the maximum of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2] and
    net.core.rmem_max as the only possible upper-bounds.
    However, users with CAP_NET_ADMIN can use SO_RCVBUFFORCE
    to set the socket's receive buffer size to values
    larger than net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2] and net.core.rmem_max.
    Thus, SO_RCVBUFFORCE is effectively ignored by
    tcp_select_initial_window().
    
    To fix this, consider the maximum of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2],
    net.core.rmem_max and socket's initial buffer space.

    tcp: make challenge acks less predictable
    
    [ Upstream commit 75ff39ccc1bd5d3c455b6822ab09e533c551f758 ]
    
    Yue Cao claims that current host rate limiting of challenge ACKS
    (RFC 5961) could leak enough information to allow a patient attacker
    to hijack TCP sessions. He will soon provide details in an academic
    paper.
    
    This patch increases the default limit from 100 to 1000, and adds
    some randomization so that the attacker can no longer hijack
    sessions without spending a considerable amount of probes.
    
    Based on initial analysis and patch from Linus.
    
    Note that we also have per socket rate limiting, so it is tempting
    to remove the host limit in the future.
    
    v2: randomize the count of challenge acks per second, not the period.

    random32: add prandom_u32_max and convert open coded users
    
    commit f337db64af059c9a94278a8b0ab97d87259ff62f upstream.
    
    Many functions have open coded a function that returns a random
    number in range [0,N-1]. Under the assumption that we have a PRNG
    such as taus113 with being well distributed in [0, ~0U] space,
    we can implement such a function as uword t = (n*m')>>32, where
    m' is a random number obtained from PRNG, n the right open interval
    border and t our resulting random number, with n,m',t in u32 universe.
    
    Lets go with Joe and simply call it prandom_u32_max(), although
    technically we have an right open interval endpoint, but that we
    have documented. Other users can further be migrated to the new
    prandom_u32_max() function later on; for now, we need to make sure
    to migrate reciprocal_divide() users for the reciprocal_divide()
    follow-up fixup since their function signatures are going to change.

    net: mvneta: set real interrupt per packet for tx_done
    
    commit 06708f81528725148473c0869d6af5f809c6824b upstream.
    
    Commit aebea2ba0f74 ("net: mvneta: fix Tx interrupt delay") intended to
    set coalescing threshold to a value guaranteeing interrupt generation
    per each sent packet, so that buffers can be released with no delay.
    
    In fact setting threshold to '1' was wrong, because it causes interrupt
    every two packets. According to the documentation a reason behind it is
    following - interrupt occurs once sent buffers counter reaches a value,
    which is higher than one specified in MVNETA_TXQ_SIZE_REG(q). This
    behavior was confirmed during tests. Also when testing the SoC working
    as a NAS device, better performance was observed with int-per-packet,
    as it strongly depends on the fact that all transmitted packets are
    released immediately.
    
    This commit enables NETA controller work in interrupt per sent packet mode
    by setting coalescing threshold to 0.

    mm: thp: fix SMP race condition between THP page fault and MADV_DONTNEED
    
    commit ad33bb04b2a6cee6c1f99fabb15cddbf93ff0433 upstream.
    
    pmd_trans_unstable()/pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() were
    introduced to locklessy (but atomically) detect when a pmd is a regular
    (stable) pmd or when the pmd is unstable and can infinitely transition
    from pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() from under us, while only holding
    the mmap_sem for reading (for writing not).
    
    While holding the mmap_sem only for reading, MADV_DONTNEED can run from
    under us and so before we can assume the pmd to be a regular stable pmd
    we need to compare it against pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() in an
    atomic way, with pmd_trans_unstable().  The old pmd_trans_huge() left a
    tiny window for a race.
    
    Useful applications are unlikely to notice the difference as doing
    MADV_DONTNEED concurrently with a page fault would lead to undefined
    behavior.

    commit 7831b4ff0d926e0deeaabef9db8800ed069a2757 upstream.
    
    A qeth_card contains a napi_struct linked to the net_device during
    device probing. This struct must be deleted when removing the qeth
    device, otherwise Panic on oops can occur when qeth devices are
    repeatedly removed and added.

    ext4: verify extent header depth
    
    commit 7bc9491645118c9461bd21099c31755ff6783593 upstream.
    
    Although the extent tree depth of 5 should enough be for the worst
    case of 2*32 extents of length 1, the extent tree code does not
    currently to merge nodes which are less than half-full with a sibling
    node, or to shrink the tree depth if possible.  So it's possible, at
    least in theory, for the tree depth to be greater than 5.  However,
    even in the worst case, a tree depth of 32 is highly unlikely, and if
    the file system is maliciously corrupted, an insanely large eh_depth
    can cause memory allocation failures that will trigger kernel warnings
    (here, eh_depth = 65280):

    xen/pciback: Fix conf_space read/write overlap check.
    
    commit 02ef871ecac290919ea0c783d05da7eedeffc10e upstream.
    
    Current overlap check is evaluating to false a case where a filter
    field is fully contained (proper subset) of a r/w request.  This
    change applies classical overlap check instead to include all the
    scenarios.
    
    More specifically, for (Hilscher GmbH CIFX 50E-DP(M/S)) device driver
    the logic is such that the entire confspace is read and written in 4
    byte chunks. In this case as an example, CACHE_LINE_SIZE,
    LATENCY_TIMER and PCI_BIST are arriving together in one call to
    xen_pcibk_config_write() with offset == 0xc and size == 4.  With the
    exsisting overlap check the LATENCY_TIMER field (offset == 0xd, length
    == 1) is fully contained in the write request and hence is excluded
    from write, which is incorrect.

    arc: unwind: warn only once if DW2_UNWIND is disabled

    fs/nilfs2: fix potential underflow in call to crc32_le
    
    commit 63d2f95d63396059200c391ca87161897b99e74a upstream.
    
    The value `bytes' comes from the filesystem which is about to be
    mounted.  We cannot trust that the value is always in the range we
    expect it to be.
    
    Check its value before using it to calculate the length for the crc32_le
    call.  It value must be larger (or equal) sumoff + 4.
    
    This fixes a kernel bug when accidentially mounting an image file which
    had the nilfs2 magic value 0x3434 at the right offset 0x406 by chance.
    The bytes 0x01 0x00 were stored at 0x408 and were interpreted as a
    s_bytes value of 1.  This caused an underflow when substracting sumoff +
    4 (20) in the call to crc32_le.

    tmpfs: fix regression hang in fallocate undo
    
    commit 7f556567036cb7f89aabe2f0954b08566b4efb53 upstream.
    
    The well-spotted fallocate undo fix is good in most cases, but not when
    fallocate failed on the very first page.  index 0 then passes lend -1
    to shmem_undo_range(), and that has two bad effects: (a) that it will
    undo every fallocation throughout the file, unrestricted by the current
    range; but more importantly (b) it can cause the undo to hang, because
    lend -1 is treated as truncation, which makes it keep on retrying until
    every page has gone, but those already fully instantiated will never go
    away.  Big thank you to xfstests generic/269 which demonstrates this.

    When fallocate is interrupted it will undo a range that extends one byte
    past its range of allocated pages.  This can corrupt an in-use page by
    zeroing out its first byte.  Instead, undo using the inclusive byte
    range.

    xen/acpi: allow xen-acpi-processor driver to load on Xen 4.7

    As of Xen 4.7 PV CPUID doesn't expose either of CPUID[1].ECX[7] and
    CPUID[0x80000007].EDX[7] anymore, causing the driver to fail to load on
    both Intel and AMD systems. Doing any kind of hardware capability
    checks in the driver as a prerequisite was wrong anyway: With the
    hypervisor being in charge, all such checking should be done by it. If
    ACPI data gets uploaded despite some missing capability, the hypervisor
    is free to ignore part or all of that data.
    
    Ditch the entire check_prereq() function, and do the only valid check
    (xen_initial_domain()) in the caller in its place.

    Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect long after socket reconnect
    
    commit 4fcd1813e6404dd4420c7d12fb483f9320f0bf93 upstream.
    
    Azure server blocks clients that open a socket and don't do anything on it.
    In our reconnect scenarios, we can reconnect the tcp session and
    detect the socket is available but we defer the negprot and SMB3 session
    setup and tree connect reconnection until the next i/o is requested, but
    this looks suspicous to some servers who expect SMB3 negprog and session
    setup soon after a socket is created.
    
    In the echo thread, reconnect SMB3 sessions and tree connections
    that are disconnected.  A later patch will replay persistent (and
    resilient) handle opens.

    scsi: fix race between simultaneous decrements of ->host_failed
    
    commit 72d8c36ec364c82bf1bf0c64dfa1041cfaf139f7 upstream.
    
    sas_ata_strategy_handler() adds the works of the ata error handler to
    system_unbound_wq. This workqueue asynchronously runs work items, so the
    ata error handler will be performed concurrently on different CPUs. In
    this case, ->host_failed will be decreased simultaneously in
    scsi_eh_finish_cmd() on different CPUs, and become abnormal.
    
    It will lead to permanently inequality between ->host_failed and
    ->host_busy, and scsi error handler thread won't start running. IO
    errors after that won't be handled.
    
    Since all scmds must have been handled in the strategy handler, just
    remove the decrement in scsi_eh_finish_cmd() and zero ->host_busy after
    the strategy handler to fix this race.

    ALSA: ctl: Stop notification after disconnection
    
    commit f388cdcdd160687c6650833f286b9c89c50960ff upstream.
    
    snd_ctl_remove() has a notification for the removal event.  It's
    superfluous when done during the device got disconnected.  Although
    the notification itself is mostly harmless, it may potentially be
    harmful, and should be suppressed.  Actually some components PCM may
    free ctl elements during the disconnect or free callbacks, thus it's
    no theoretical issue.
    
    This patch adds the check of card->shutdown flag for avoiding
    unnecessary notifications after (or during) the disconnect.

    tty/vt/keyboard: fix OOB access in do_compute_shiftstate()
    
    commit 510cccb5b0c8868a2b302a0ab524da7912da648b upstream.
    
    The size of individual keymap in drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c is NR_KEYS,
    which is currently 256, whereas number of keys/buttons in input device (and
    therefor in key_down) is much larger - KEY_CNT - 768, and that can cause
    out-of-bound access when we do
    
            sym = U(key_maps[0][k]);
    
    with large 'k'.
    
    To fix it we should not attempt iterating beyond smaller of NR_KEYS and
    KEY_CNT.
    
    Also while at it let's switch to for_each_set_bit() instead of open-coding
    it.

    commit 68b356eb3d9f5e38910fb62e22a78e2a18d544ae upstream.
    
    Currently the ad7266 driver treats any failure to get vref as though the
    regulator were not present but this means that if probe deferral is
    triggered the driver will act as though the regulator were not present.
    Instead only use the internal reference if we explicitly got -ENODEV which
    is what is returned for absent regulators.

    iio:ad7266: Fix support for optional regulators
    
    commit e5511c816e5ac4909bdd38e85ac344e2b9b8e984 upstream.
    
    The ad7266 driver attempts to support deciding between the use of internal
    and external power supplies by checking to see if an error is returned when
    requesting the regulator. This doesn't work with the current code since the
    driver uses a normal regulator_get() which is for non-optional supplies
    and so assumes that if a regulator is not provided by the platform then
    this is a bug in the platform integration and so substitutes a dummy
    regulator. Use regulator_get_optional() instead which indicates to the
    framework that the regulator may be absent and provides a dummy regulator
    instead.

    All regulator_get() variants return either a pointer to a regulator or an

    drm/i915/ilk: Don't disable SSC source if it's in use
    
    commit 476490a945e1f0f6bd58e303058d2d8ca93a974c upstream.
    
    Thanks to Ville Syrjälä for pointing me towards the cause of this issue.
    
    Unfortunately one of the sideaffects of having the refclk for a DPLL set
    to SSC is that as long as it's set to SSC, the GPU will prevent us from
    powering down any of the pipes or transcoders using it. A couple of
    BIOSes enable SSC in both PCH_DREF_CONTROL and in the DPLL
    configurations. This causes issues on the first modeset, since we don't
    expect SSC to be left on and as a result, can't successfully power down
    the pipes or the transcoders using it. Here's an example from this Dell
    OptiPlex 990:
    
    [drm:intel_modeset_init] SSC enabled by BIOS, overriding VBT which says disabled

    Later modesets succeed since they reset the DPLL's configuration anyway,
    but this is enough to get stuck with a big fat warning in dmesg.
    
    A better solution would be to add refcounts for the SSC source, but for
    now leaving the source clock on should suffice.
    
    Changes since v4:
     - Fix calculation of final for systems with LVDS panels (fixes BUG() on
       CI test suite)
    Changes since v3:
     - Move temp variable into loop
     - Move checks for using_ssc_source to after we've figured out has_ck505
     - Add using_ssc_source to debug output
    Changes since v2:
     - Fix debug output for when we disable the CPU source
    Changes since v1:
     - Leave the SSC source clock on instead of just shutting it off on all
       of the DPLL configurations.

    drm/radeon: fix asic initialization for virtualized environments
    
    commit 05082b8bbd1a0ffc74235449c4b8930a8c240f85 upstream.
    
    When executing in a PCI passthrough based virtuzliation environment, the
    hypervisor will usually attempt to send a PCIe bus reset signal to the
    ASIC when the VM reboots. In this scenario, the card is not correctly
    initialized, but we still consider it to be posted. Therefore, in a
    passthrough based environemnt we should always post the card to guarantee
    it is in a good state for driver initialization.

    tracing: Handle NULL formats in hold_module_trace_bprintk_format()
    
    commit 70c8217acd4383e069fe1898bbad36ea4fcdbdcc upstream.
    
    If a task uses a non constant string for the format parameter in
    trace_printk(), then the trace_printk_fmt variable is set to NULL. This
    variable is then saved in the __trace_printk_fmt section.
    
    The function hold_module_trace_bprintk_format() checks to see if duplicate
    formats are used by modules, and reuses them if so (saves them to the list
    if it is new). But this function calls lookup_format() that does a strcmp()
    to the value (which is now NULL) and can cause a kernel oops.
    
    This wasn't an issue till 3debb0a9ddb ("tracing: Fix trace_printk() to print
    when not using bprintk()") which added "__used" to the trace_printk_fmt
    variable, and before that, the kernel simply optimized it out (no NULL value
    was saved).
    
    The fix is simply to handle the NULL pointer in lookup_format() and have the
    caller ignore the value if it was NULL.

    kvm: Fix irq route entries exceeding KVM_MAX_IRQ_ROUTES
    
    commit caf1ff26e1aa178133df68ac3d40815fed2187d9 upstream.
    
    These days, we experienced one guest crash with 8 cores and 3 disks,
    with qemu error logs as bellow:
    
    qemu-system-x86_64: /build/qemu-2.0.0/kvm-all.c:984:
    kvm_irqchip_commit_routes: Assertion `ret == 0' failed.
    
    And then we found one patch(bdf026317d) in qemu tree, which said
    could fix this bug.
    
    Execute the following script will reproduce the BUG quickly:
    
    irq_affinity.sh
    ========================================================================
    
    vda_irq_num=25
    vdb_irq_num=27
    while [ 1 ]
    do
        for irq in {1,2,4,8,10,20,40,80}
            do
                echo $irq > /proc/irq/$vda_irq_num/smp_affinity
                echo $irq > /proc/irq/$vdb_irq_num/smp_affinity
                dd if=/dev/vda of=/dev/zero bs=4K count=100 iflag=direct
                dd if=/dev/vdb of=/dev/zero bs=4K count=100 iflag=direct
            done
    done
    ========================================================================
    
    The following qemu log is added in the qemu code and is displayed when
    this bug reproduced:
    
    kvm_irqchip_commit_routes: max gsi: 1008, nr_allocated_irq_routes: 1024,
    irq_routes->nr: 1024, gsi_count: 1024.
    
    That's to say when irq_routes->nr == 1024, there are 1024 routing entries,
    but in the kernel code when routes->nr >= 1024, will just return -EINVAL;
    
    The nr is the number of the routing entries which is in of
    [1 ~ KVM_MAX_IRQ_ROUTES], not the index in [0 ~ KVM_MAX_IRQ_ROUTES - 1].
    
    This patch fix the BUG above.

    libceph: apply new_state before new_up_client on incrementals
    
    commit 930c532869774ebf8af9efe9484c597f896a7d46 upstream.
    
    Currently, osd_weight and osd_state fields are updated in the encoding
    order.  This is wrong, because an incremental map may look like e.g.
    
        new_up_client: { osd=6, addr=... } # set osd_state and addr
        new_state: { osd=6, xorstate=EXISTS } # clear osd_state
    
    Suppose osd6's current osd_state is EXISTS (i.e. osd6 is down).  After
    applying new_up_client, osd_state is changed to EXISTS | UP.  Carrying
    on with the new_state update, we flip EXISTS and leave osd6 in a weird
    "!EXISTS but UP" state.  A non-existent OSD is considered down by the
    mapping code
    
    2087    for (i = 0; i < pg->pg_temp.len; i++) {
    2088            if (ceph_osd_is_down(osdmap, pg->pg_temp.osds[i])) {
    2089                    if (ceph_can_shift_osds(pi))
    2090                            continue;
    2091
    2092                    temp->osds[temp->size++] = CRUSH_ITEM_NONE;
    
    and so requests get directed to the second OSD in the set instead of
    the first, resulting in OSD-side errors like:
    
    [WRN] : client.4239 192.168.122.21:0/2444980242 misdirected client.4239.1:2827 pg 2.5df899f2 to osd.4 not [1,4,6] in e680/680
    
    and hung rbds on the client:
    
    [  493.566367] rbd: rbd0: write 400000 at 11cc00000 (0)
    [  493.566805] rbd: rbd0:   result -6 xferred 400000
    [  493.567011] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev rbd0, sector 9330688
    
    The fix is to decouple application from the decoding and:
    - apply new_weight first
    - apply new_state before new_up_client
    - twiddle osd_state flags if marking in
    - clear out some of the state if osd is destroyed

    netfilter: x_tables: speed up jump target validation
    
    commit f4dc77713f8016d2e8a3295e1c9c53a21f296def upstream.
    
    The dummy ruleset I used to test the original validation change was broken,
    most rules were unreachable and were not tested by mark_source_chains().
    
    In some cases rulesets that used to load in a few seconds now require
    several minutes.
    
    sample ruleset that shows the behaviour:
    
    echo "*filter"
    for i in $(seq 0 100000);do
            printf ":chain_%06x - [0:0]\n" $i
    done
    for i in $(seq 0 100000);do
       printf -- "-A INPUT -j chain_%06x\n" $i
       printf -- "-A INPUT -j chain_%06x\n" $i
       printf -- "-A INPUT -j chain_%06x\n" $i
    done
    echo COMMIT
    
    [ pipe result into iptables-restore ]
    
    This ruleset will be about 74mbyte in size, with ~500k searches
    though all 500k[1] rule entries. iptables-restore will take forever
    (gave up after 10 minutes)
    
    Instead of always searching the entire blob for a match, fill an
    array with the start offsets of every single ipt_entry struct,
    then do a binary search to check if the jump target is present or not.
    
    After this change ruleset restore times get again close to what one
    gets when reverting 36472341017529e (~3 seconds on my workstation).
    
    [1] every user-defined rule gets an implicit RETURN, so we get
    300k jumps + 100k userchains + 100k returns -> 500k rule entries

    printk: do cond_resched() between lines while outputting to consoles
    
    commit 8d91f8b15361dfb438ab6eb3b319e2ded43458ff upstream.
    
    @console_may_schedule tracks whether console_sem was acquired through
    lock or trylock.  If the former, we're inside a sleepable context and
    console_conditional_schedule() performs cond_resched().  This allows
    console drivers which use console_lock for synchronization to yield
    while performing time-consuming operations such as scrolling.
    
    However, the actual console outputting is performed while holding
    irq-safe logbuf_lock, so console_unlock() clears @console_may_schedule
    before starting outputting lines.  Also, only a few drivers call
    console_conditional_schedule() to begin with.  This means that when a
    lot of lines need to be output by console_unlock(), for example on a
    console registration, the task doing console_unlock() may not yield for
    a long time on a non-preemptible kernel.
    
    If this happens with a slow console devices, for example a serial
    console, the outputting task may occupy the cpu for a very long time.
    Long enough to trigger softlockup and/or RCU stall warnings, which in
    turn pile more messages, sometimes enough to trigger the next cycle of
    warnings incapacitating the system.
    
    Fix it by making console_unlock() insert cond_resched() between lines if
    @console_may_schedule.

    panic: release stale console lock to always get the logbuf printed out
    
    commit 08d78658f393fefaa2e6507ea052c6f8ef4002a2 upstream.
    
    In some cases we may end up killing the CPU holding the console lock
    while still having valuable data in logbuf. E.g. I'm observing the
    following:
    
    - A crash is happening on one CPU and console_unlock() is being called on
      some other.
    
    - console_unlock() tries to print out the buffer before releasing the lock
      and on slow console it takes time.
    
    - in the meanwhile crashing CPU does lots of printk()-s with valuable data
      (which go to the logbuf) and sends IPIs to all other CPUs.
    
    - console_unlock() finishes printing previous chunk and enables interrupts
      before trying to print out the rest, the CPU catches the IPI and never
      releases console lock.
    
    This is not the only possible case: in VT/fb subsystems we have many other
    console_lock()/console_unlock() users.  Non-masked interrupts (or
    receiving NMI in case of extreme slowness) will have the same result.
    Getting the whole console buffer printed out on crash should be top
    priority.

    mm: migrate dirty page without clear_page_dirty_for_io etc
    
    commit 42cb14b110a5698ccf26ce59c4441722605a3743 upstream.
    
    clear_page_dirty_for_io() has accumulated writeback and memcg subtleties
    since v2.6.16 first introduced page migration; and the set_page_dirty()
    which completed its migration of PageDirty, later had to be moderated to
    __set_page_dirty_nobuffers(); then PageSwapBacked had to skip that too.
    
    No actual problems seen with this procedure recently, but if you look into
    what the clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)+set_page_dirty(newpage) is actually
    achieving, it turns out to be nothing more than moving the PageDirty flag,
    and its NR_FILE_DIRTY stat from one zone to another.
    
    It would be good to avoid a pile of irrelevant decrementations and
    incrementations, and improper event counting, and unnecessary descent of
    the radix_tree under tree_lock (to set the PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY which
    radix_tree_replace_slot() left in place anyway).
    
    Do the NR_FILE_DIRTY movement, like the other stats movements, while
    interrupts still disabled in migrate_page_move_mapping(); and don't even
    bother if the zone is the same.  Do the PageDirty movement there under
    tree_lock too, where old page is frozen and newpage not yet visible:
    bearing in mind that as soon as newpage becomes visible in radix_tree, an
    un-page-locked set_page_dirty() might interfere (or perhaps that's just
    not possible: anything doing so should already hold an additional
    reference to the old page, preventing its migration; but play safe).
    
    But we do still need to transfer PageDirty in migrate_page_copy(), for
    those who don't go the mapping route through migrate_page_move_mapping().

    x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
    
    commit 71b3c126e61177eb693423f2e18a1914205b165e upstream.
    
    When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
    tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
    will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
    needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
    starting to fill the local TLB.
    
    Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
    a couple that were missing.
