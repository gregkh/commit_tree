    mm: Remove false WARN_ON from pagecache_isize_extended()
    
    commit f55fefd1a5a339b1bd08c120b93312d6eb64a9fb upstream.
    
    The WARN_ON checking whether i_mutex is held in
    pagecache_isize_extended() was wrong because some filesystems (e.g.
    XFS) use different locks for serialization of truncates / writes. So
    just remove the check.

    perf: Handle compat ioctl
    
    commit b3f207855f57b9c8f43a547a801340bb5cbc59e5 upstream.
    
    When running a 32-bit userspace on a 64-bit kernel (eg. i386
    application on x86_64 kernel or 32-bit arm userspace on arm64
    kernel) some of the perf ioctls must be treated with special
    care, as they have a pointer size encoded in the command.
    
    For example, PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID in 32-bit world will be encoded
    as 0x80042407, but 64-bit kernel will expect 0x80082407. In
    result the ioctl will fail returning -ENOTTY.
    
    This patch solves the problem by adding code fixing up the
    size as compat_ioctl file operation.

    On archs with PAGE_SIZE >= 64 KiB the function skcipher_alloc_sgl()
    fails with -ENOMEM no matter what user space actually requested.
    This is caused by the fact sock_kmalloc call inside the function tried

    Patch for 3.2.x, 3.4.x IP identifier regression
    
    With commits 73f156a6e8c1 ("inetpeer: get rid of ip_id_count") and
    04ca6973f7c1 ("ip: make IP identifiers less predictable"), IP
    identifiers are generated from a counter chosen from an array of
    counters indexed by the hash of the outgoing packet header's source
    address, destination address, and protocol number.  Thus, in
    __ip_make_skb(), we must now call ip_select_ident() only after setting
    these fields in the IP header to prevent IP identifiers from being
    generated from bogus counters.

    When the driver calls scsi_done and after that frees it's internal

    the memory is freed. The allocation fails and the message

    tcp: be more strict before accepting ECN negociation
    
    commit bd14b1b2e29bd6812597f896dde06eaf7c6d2f24 upstream.
    
    It appears some networks play bad games with the two bits reserved for
    ECN. This can trigger false congestion notifications and very slow
    transferts.
    
    Since RFC 3168 (6.1.1) forbids SYN packets to carry CT bits, we can
    disable TCP ECN negociation if it happens we receive mangled CT bits in
    the SYN packet.

    The xpad wireless endpoint is not a bulk endpoint on my devices, but
    rather an interrupt one, so the USB core complains when it is submitted.
    I'm guessing that the author really did mean that this should be an
    interrupt urb, but as there are a zillion different xpad devices out
    there, let's cover out bases and handle both bulk and interrupt
    endpoints just as easily.

    x86_64, traps: Rework bad_iret
    
    commit b645af2d5905c4e32399005b867987919cbfc3ae upstream.
    
    It's possible for iretq to userspace to fail.  This can happen because
    of a bad CS, SS, or RIP.
    
    Historically, we've handled it by fixing up an exception from iretq to
    land at bad_iret, which pretends that the failed iret frame was really
    the hardware part of #GP(0) from userspace.  To make this work, there's
    an extra fixup to fudge the gs base into a usable state.
    
    This is suboptimal because it loses the original exception.  It's also
    buggy because there's no guarantee that we were on the kernel stack to
    begin with.  For example, if the failing iret happened on return from an
    NMI, then we'll end up executing general_protection on the NMI stack.
    This is bad for several reasons, the most immediate of which is that
    general_protection, as a non-paranoid idtentry, will try to deliver
    signals and/or schedule from the wrong stack.
    
    This patch throws out bad_iret entirely.  As a replacement, it augments
    the existing swapgs fudge into a full-blown iret fixup, mostly written
    in C.  It's should be clearer and more correct.

    x86_64, traps: Stop using IST for #SS
    
    commit 6f442be2fb22be02cafa606f1769fa1e6f894441 upstream.
    
    On a 32-bit kernel, this has no effect, since there are no IST stacks.
    
    On a 64-bit kernel, #SS can only happen in user code, on a failed iret
    to user space, a canonical violation on access via RSP or RBP, or a
    genuine stack segment violation in 32-bit kernel code.  The first two
    cases don't need IST, and the latter two cases are unlikely fatal bugs,
    and promoting them to double faults would be fine.
    
    This fixes a bug in which the espfix64 code mishandles a stack segment
    violation.
    
    This saves 4k of memory per CPU and a tiny bit of code.

    usb: xhci: rework root port wake bits if controller isn't allowed to wakeup
    
    commit a1377e5397ab321e21b793ec8cd2b6f12bd3c718 upstream.
    
    When system is being suspended, if host device is not allowed to do wakeup,
    xhci_suspend() needs to clear all root port wake on bits. Otherwise, some
    platforms may generate spurious wakeup, even if PCI PME# is disabled.
    
    The initial commit ff8cbf250b44 ("xhci: clear root port wake on bits"),
    which also got into stable, turned out to not work correctly and had to
    be reverted, and is now rewritten.

    USB: xhci: Reset a halted endpoint immediately when we encounter a stall.
    
    commit 8e71a322fdb127814bcba423a512914ca5bc6cf5 upstream.
    
    If a device is halted and reuturns a STALL, then the halted endpoint
    needs to be cleared both on the host and device side. The host
    side halt is cleared by issueing a xhci reset endpoint command. The device side
    is cleared with a ClearFeature(ENDPOINT_HALT) request, which should
    be issued by the device driver if a URB reruen -EPIPE.
    
    Previously we cleared the host side halt after the device side was cleared.
    To make sure the host side halt is cleared in time we want to issue the
    reset endpoint command immedialtely when a STALL status is encountered.
    
    Otherwise we end up not following the specs and not returning -EPIPE
    several times in a row when trying to transfer data to a halted endpoint.

    USB: xhci: don't start a halted endpoint before its new dequeue is set
    
    commit c3492dbfa1050debf23a5b5cd2bc7514c5b37896 upstream.
    
    A halted endpoint ring must first be reset, then move the ring
    dequeue pointer past the problematic TRB. If we start the ring too
    early after reset, but before moving the dequeue pointer we
    will end up executing the same problematic TRB again.
    
    As we always issue a set transfer dequeue command after a reset
    endpoint command we can skip starting endpoint rings at reset endpoint
    command completion.
    
    Without this fix we end up trying to handle the same faulty TD for
    contol endpoints. causing timeout, and failing testusb ctrl_out write
    tests.

    ARM: 8216/1: xscale: correct auxiliary register in suspend/resume
    
    commit ef59a20ba375aeb97b3150a118318884743452a8 upstream.
    
    According to the manuals I have, XScale auxiliary register should be
    reached with opc_2 = 1 instead of crn = 1. cpu_xscale_proc_init
    correctly uses c1, c0, 1 arguments, but cpu_xscale_do_suspend and
    cpu_xscale_do_resume use c1, c1, 0. Correct suspend/resume functions to
    also use c1, c0, 1.
    
    The issue was primarily noticed thanks to qemu reporing "unsupported
    instruction" on the pxa suspend path. Confirmed in PXA210/250 and PXA255
    XScale Core manuals and in PXA270 and PXA320 Developers Guides.
    
    Harware tested by me on tosa (pxa255). Robert confirmed on pxa270 board.

    bnx2fc: do not add shared skbs to the fcoe_rx_list
    
    commit 01a4cc4d0cd6a836c7b923760e8eb1cbb6a47258 upstream.
    
    In some cases, the fcoe_rx_list may contains multiple instances
    of the same skb (the so called "shared skbs").
    
    the bnx2fc_l2_rcv thread is a loop that extracts a skb from the list,
    modifies (and destroys) its content and then proceed to the next one.
    The problem is that if the skb is shared, the remaining instances will
    be corrupted.
    
    The solution is to use skb_share_check() before adding the skb to the
    fcoe_rx_list.

    nfsd: Fix slot wake up race in the nfsv4.1 callback code
    
    commit c6c15e1ed303ffc47e696ea1c9a9df1761c1f603 upstream.
    
    The currect code for nfsd41_cb_get_slot() and nfsd4_cb_done() has no
    locking in order to guarantee atomicity, and so allows for races of
    the form.
    
    Task 1                                  Task 2
    ======                                  ======
    if (test_and_set_bit(0) != 0) {
                                            clear_bit(0)
                                            rpc_wake_up_next(queue)
            rpc_sleep_on(queue)
            return false;
    }
    
    This patch breaks the race condition by adding a retest of the bit
    after the call to rpc_sleep_on().

    commit 746c9e9f92dde2789908e51a354ba90a1962a2eb upstream.
    
    We have a historical hack that treats missing ranges properties as the
    equivalent of an empty one. This is needed for ancient PowerMac "bad"
    device-trees, and shouldn't be enabled for any other PowerPC platform,
    otherwise we get some nasty layout of devices in sysfs or even
    duplication when a set of otherwise identically named devices is
    created multiple times under a different parent node with no ranges
    property.
    
    This fix is needed for the PowerNV i2c busses to be exposed properly
    and will fix a number of other embedded cases.

    get the correct span of memory.

    x86: Require exact match for 'noxsave' command line option
    
    commit 2cd3949f702692cf4c5d05b463f19cd706a92dd3 upstream.
    
    We have some very similarly named command-line options:
    
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsave", x86_xsave_setup);
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsaveopt", x86_xsaveopt_setup);
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c:__setup("noxsaves", x86_xsaves_setup);
    
    __setup() is designed to match options that take arguments, like
    "foo=bar" where you would have:
    
            __setup("foo", x86_foo_func...);
    
    The problem is that "noxsave" actually _matches_ "noxsaves" in
    the same way that "foo" matches "foo=bar".  If you boot an old
    kernel that does not know about "noxsaves" with "noxsaves" on the
    command line, it will interpret the argument as "noxsave", which
    is not what you want at all.
    
    This makes the "noxsave" handler only return success when it finds
    an *exact* match.
    
    [ tglx: We really need to make __setup() more robust. ]

    firewire: cdev: prevent kernel stack leaking into ioctl arguments
    
    commit eaca2d8e75e90a70a63a6695c9f61932609db212 upstream.
    
    Found by the UC-KLEE tool:  A user could supply less input to
    firewire-cdev ioctls than write- or write/read-type ioctl handlers
    expect.  The handlers used data from uninitialized kernel stack then.
    
    This could partially leak back to the user if the kernel subsequently
    generated fw_cdev_event_'s (to be read from the firewire-cdev fd)
    which notably would contain the _u64 closure field which many of the
    ioctl argument structures contain.
    
    The fact that the handlers would act on random garbage input is a
    lesser issue since all handlers must check their input anyway.
    
    The fix simply always null-initializes the entire ioctl argument buffer
    regardless of the actual length of expected user input.  That is, a
    runtime overhead of memset(..., 40) is added to each firewirew-cdev
    ioctl() call.  [Comment from Clemens Ladisch:  This part of the stack is
    most likely to be already in the cache.]
    
    Remarks:
      - There was never any leak from kernel stack to the ioctl output
        buffer itself.  IOW, it was not possible to read kernel stack by a
        read-type or write/read-type ioctl alone; the leak could at most
        happen in combination with read()ing subsequent event data.
      - The actual expected minimum user input of each ioctl from
        include/uapi/linux/firewire-cdev.h is, in bytes:
        [0x00] = 32, [0x05] =  4, [0x0a] = 16, [0x0f] = 20, [0x14] = 16,
        [0x01] = 36, [0x06] = 20, [0x0b] =  4, [0x10] = 20, [0x15] = 20,
        [0x02] = 20, [0x07] =  4, [0x0c] =  0, [0x11] =  0, [0x16] =  8,
        [0x03] =  4, [0x08] = 24, [0x0d] = 20, [0x12] = 36, [0x17] = 12,
        [0x04] = 20, [0x09] = 24, [0x0e] =  4, [0x13] = 40, [0x18] =  4.

    ASoC: sgtl5000: Fix SMALL_POP bit definition
    
    commit c251ea7bd7a04f1f2575467e0de76e803cf59149 upstream.
    
    On a mx28evk with a sgtl5000 codec we notice a loud 'click' sound  to happen
    5 seconds after the end of a playback.
    
    The SMALL_POP bit should fix this, but its definition is incorrect:
    according to the sgtl5000 manual it is bit 0 of CHIP_REF_CTRL register, not
    bit 1.
    
    Fix the definition accordingly and enable the bit as intended per the code
    comment.
    
    After applying this change, no loud 'click' sound is heard after playback

    rt2x00: do not align payload on modern H/W
    
    commit cfd9167af14eb4ec21517a32911d460083ee3d59 upstream.
    
    RT2800 and newer hardware require padding between header and payload if
    header length is not multiple of 4.
    
    For historical reasons we also align payload to to 4 bytes boundary, but
    such alignment is not needed on modern H/W.
    
    Patch fixes skb_under_panic problems reported from time to time:
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84911
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72471
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=139108549530402&w=2
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1087591
    
    Panic happened because we eat 4 bytes of skb headroom on each
    (re)transmission when sending frame without the payload and the header
    length not being multiple of 4 (i.e. QoS header has 26 bytes). On such
    case because paylad_aling=2 is bigger than header_align=0 we increase
    header_align by 4 bytes. To prevent that we could change the check to:
    
            if (payload_length && payload_align > header_align)
                    header_align += 4;
    
    but not aligning payload at all is more effective and alignment is not
    really needed by H/W (that has been tested on OpenWrt project for few
    years now).

    audit: keep inode pinned
    
    commit 799b601451b21ebe7af0e6e8f6e2ccd4683c5064 upstream.
    
    Audit rules disappear when an inode they watch is evicted from the cache.
    This is likely not what we want.
    
    The guilty commit is "fsnotify: allow marks to not pin inodes in core",
    which didn't take into account that audit_tree adds watches with a zero
    mask.
    
    Adding any mask should fix this.

    commit 48379270fe6808cf4612ee094adc8da2b7a83baa upstream.
    
    Setups that use the blk-mq I/O path can lock up if a host with a single
    device that has its door locked enters EH.  Make sure to only send the
    command to re-lock the door to devices that actually were reset and thus
    might have lost their state.  Otherwise the EH code might be get blocked
    on blk_get_request as all requests for non-reset devices might be in use.

    Input: alps - allow up to 2 invalid packets without resetting device
    
    commit 9d720b34c0a432639252f63012e18b0507f5b432 upstream.
    
    On some Dell Latitude laptops ALPS device or Dell EC send one invalid byte
    in 6 bytes ALPS packet. In this case psmouse driver enter out of sync
    state. It looks like that all other bytes in packets are valid and also
    device working properly. So there is no need to do full device reset, just
    need to wait for byte which match condition for first byte (start of
    packet). Because ALPS packets are bigger (6 or 8 bytes) default limit is
    small.
    
    This patch increase number of invalid bytes to size of 2 ALPS packets which
    psmouse driver can drop before do full reset.
    
    Resetting ALPS devices take some time and when doing reset on some Dell
    laptops touchpad, trackstick and also keyboard do not respond. So it is
    better to do it only if really necessary.

    Input: alps - ignore potential bare packets when device is out of sync
    
    commit 4ab8f7f320f91f279c3f06a9795cfea5c972888a upstream.
    
    5th and 6th byte of ALPS trackstick V3 protocol match condition for first
    byte of PS/2 3 bytes packet. When driver enters out of sync state and ALPS
    trackstick is sending data then driver match 5th, 6th and next 1st bytes as
    PS/2.
    
    It basically means if user is using trackstick when driver is in out of
    sync state driver will never resync. Processing these bytes as 3 bytes PS/2
    data cause total mess (random cursor movements, random clicks) and make
    trackstick unusable until psmouse driver decide to do full device reset.
    
    Lot of users reported problems with ALPS devices on Dell Latitude E6440,
    E6540 and E7440 laptops. ALPS device or Dell EC for unknown reason send
    some invalid ALPS PS/2 bytes which cause driver out of sync. It looks like
    that i8042 and psmouse/alps driver always receive group of 6 bytes packets
    so there are no missing bytes and no bytes were inserted between valid
    ones.
    
    This patch does not fix root of problem with ALPS devices found in Dell
    Latitude laptops but it does not allow to process some (invalid)
    subsequence of 6 bytes ALPS packets as 3 bytes PS/2 when driver is out of
    sync.
    
    So with this patch trackstick input device does not report bogus data when
    also driver is out of sync, so trackstick should be usable on those
    machines.

    spi: dw: Fix dynamic speed change.
    
    commit 0a8727e69778683495058852f783eeda141a754e upstream.
    
    An IOCTL call that calls spi_setup() and then dw_spi_setup() will
    overwrite the persisted last transfer speed. On each transfer, the
    SPI speed is compared to the last transfer speed to determine if the
    clock divider registers need to be updated (did the speed change?).
    This bug was observed with the spidev driver using spi-config to
    update the max transfer speed.
    
    This fix: Don't overwrite the persisted last transaction clock speed
    when updating the SPI parameters in dw_spi_setup(). On the next
    transaction, the new speed won't match the persisted last speed
    and the hardware registers will be updated.
    On initialization, the persisted last transaction clock
    speed will be 0 but will be updated after the first SPI
    transaction.
    
    Move zeroed clock divider check into clock change test because
    chip->clk_div is zero on startup and would cause a divide-by-zero
    error. The calculation was wrong as well (can't support odd #).

    commit 37b164578826406a173ca7c20d9ba7430134d23e upstream.
    
    Kernel oops can cause the tty to be unreleaseable (for example, if
    n_tty_read() crashes while on the read_wait queue). This will cause
    tty_release() to endlessly loop without sleeping.
    
    Use a killable sleep timeout which grows by 2n+1 jiffies over the interval
    [0, 120 secs.) and then jumps to forever (but still killable).
    
    NB: killable just allows for the task to be rewoken manually, not
    to be terminated.

    serial: Fix divide-by-zero fault in uart_get_divisor()
    
    commit 547039ec502076e60034eeb79611df3433a99b7d upstream.
    
    uart_get_baud_rate() will return baud == 0 if the max rate is set
    to the "magic" 38400 rate and the SPD_* flags are also specified.
    On the first iteration, if the current baud rate is higher than the
    max, the baud rate is clamped at the max (which in the degenerate
    case is 38400). On the second iteration, the now-"magic" 38400 baud
    rate selects the possibly higher alternate baud rate indicated by
    the SPD_* flag. Since only two loop iterations are performed, the
    loop is exited, a kernel WARNING is generated and a baud rate of
    0 is returned.
    
    Reproducible with:
     setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_hi base_baud 38400
    
    Only perform the "magic" 38400 -> SPD_* baud transform on the first
    loop iteration, which prevents the degenerate case from recognizing
    the clamped baud rate as the "magic" 38400 value.

    This comes from the fact that usb-audio driver may receive the
    disconnect callback multiple times, per each usb interface.  When a
    device has both audio and midi interfaces, it gets called twice, and
    currently the driver tries to release resources at the last call.
    At this point, the first parent interface has been already deleted,
    thus deleting a child of the first parent hits such a warning.
    
    For fixing this problem, we need to call snd_card_disconnect() and
    cancel pending operations at the very first disconnect while the
    release of the whole objects waits until the last disconnect call.

    usb-storage: handle a skipped data phase
    
    commit 93c9bf4d1838d5851a18ca398b0ad66397f05056 upstream.
    
    Sometimes mass-storage devices using the Bulk-only transport will
    mistakenly skip the data phase of a command.  Rather than sending the
    data expected by the host or sending a zero-length packet, they go
    directly to the status phase and send the CSW.
    
    This causes problems for usb-storage, for obvious reasons.  The driver
    will interpret the CSW as a short data transfer and will wait to
    receive a CSW.  The device won't have anything left to send, so the
    command eventually times out.
    
    The SCSI layer doesn't retry commands after they time out (this is a
    relatively recent change).  Therefore we should do our best to detect
    a skipped data phase and handle it promptly.
    
    This patch adds code to do that.  If usb-storage receives a short
    13-byte data transfer from the device, and if the first four bytes of
    the data match the CSW signature, the driver will set the residue to
    the full transfer length and interpret the data as a CSW.
    
    This fixes Bugzilla #86611.

    The problem is the following call sequence (simplified):

    2)   hub_port_init
    3)    hub_port_finish_reset
    3)     xhci_discover_or_reset_device
            This frees xhci->devs[slot_id]->eps[ep_index].ring for all eps but 0
    4)    usb_get_device_descriptor
           This fails
    5)   hub_port_init fails
    6)  usb_reset_and_verify_device fails, does not restore device config
    7)  uas_post_reset
    8)   xhci_alloc_streams
          NULL deref on the free-ed ring
    
    This commit fixes this by not allowing usb_alloc_streams to continue if
    the device is not configured.
    
    Note that we do allow usb_free_streams to continue after a (logical)
    disconnect, as it is necessary to explicitly free the streams at the xhci
    controller level.

    mac80211: fix use-after-free in defragmentation
    
    commit b8fff407a180286aa683d543d878d98d9fc57b13 upstream.
    
    Upon receiving the last fragment, all but the first fragment
    are freed, but the multicast check for statistics at the end
    of the function refers to the current skb (the last fragment)
    causing a use-after-free bug.
    
    Since multicast frames cannot be fragmented and we check for
    this early in the function, just modify that check to also
    do the accounting to fix the issue.

    Priority of a merged request is computed by ioprio_best(). If one of the
    requests has undefined priority (IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE) and another request
    has priority from IOPRIO_CLASS_BE, the function will return the

    tracing/syscalls: Ignore numbers outside NR_syscalls' range
    
    commit 086ba77a6db00ed858ff07451bedee197df868c9 upstream.
    
    ARM has some private syscalls (for example, set_tls(2)) which lie
    outside the range of NR_syscalls.  If any of these are called while
    syscall tracing is being performed, out-of-bounds array access will
    occur in the ftrace and perf sys_{enter,exit} handlers.

    ds3000: fix LNB supply voltage on Tevii S480 on initialization
    
    commit 8c5bcded11cb607b1bb5920de3b9c882136d27db upstream.
    
    The Tevii S480 outputs 18V on startup for the LNB supply voltage and does not
    automatically power down. This blocks other receivers connected
    to a satellite channel router (EN50494), since the receivers can not send the
    required DiSEqC sequences when the Tevii card is connected to a the same SCR.
    
    This patch switches off the LNB supply voltage on initialization of the frontend.

    When there are no meta block groups update_backups() will compute the
    backup block in 32-bit arithmetics thus possibly overflowing the block
    number and corrupting the filesystem. OTOH filesystems without meta
    block groups larger than 16 TB should be rare. Fix the problem by doing

    mac80211: properly flush delayed scan work on interface removal
    
    commit 46238845bd609a5c0fbe076e1b82b4c5b33360b2 upstream.
    
    When an interface is deleted, an ongoing hardware scan is canceled and
    the driver must abort the scan, at the very least reporting completion
    while the interface is removed.
    
    However, if it scheduled the work that might only run after everything
    is said and done, which leads to cfg80211 warning that the scan isn't
    reported as finished yet; this is no fault of the driver, it already
    did, but mac80211 hasn't processed it.
    
    To fix this situation, flush the delayed work when the interface being
    removed is the one that was executing the scan.

    mm, thp: fix collapsing of hugepages on madvise
    
    commit 6d50e60cd2edb5a57154db5a6f64eef5aa59b751 upstream.
    
    If an anonymous mapping is not allowed to fault thp memory and then
    madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE) is used after fault, khugepaged will never
    collapse this memory into thp memory.
    
    This occurs because the madvise(2) handler for thp, hugepage_madvise(),
    clears VM_NOHUGEPAGE on the stack and it isn't stored in vma->vm_flags
    until the final action of madvise_behavior().  This causes the
    khugepaged_enter_vma_merge() to be a no-op in hugepage_madvise() when
    the vma had previously had VM_NOHUGEPAGE set.
    
    Fix this by passing the correct vma flags to the khugepaged mm slot
    handler.  There's no chance khugepaged can run on this vma until after
    madvise_behavior() returns since we hold mm->mmap_sem.
    
    It would be possible to clear VM_NOHUGEPAGE directly from vma->vm_flags
    in hugepage_advise(), but I didn't want to introduce special case
    behavior into madvise_behavior().  I think it's best to just let it
    always set vma->vm_flags itself.

    cgroup/kmemleak: add kmemleak_free() for cgroup deallocations.
    
    commit 401507d67d5c2854f5a88b3f93f64fc6f267bca5 upstream.
    
    Commit ff7ee93f4715 ("cgroup/kmemleak: Annotate alloc_page() for cgroup
    allocations") introduces kmemleak_alloc() for alloc_page_cgroup(), but
    corresponding kmemleak_free() is missing, which makes kmemleak be
    wrongly disabled after memory offlining.  Log is pasted at the end of
    this commit message.
    
    This patch add kmemleak_free() into free_page_cgroup().  During page
    offlining, this patch removes corresponding entries in kmemleak rbtree.
    After that, the freed memory can be allocated again by other subsystems
    without killing kmemleak.

    zap_pte_range: update addr when forcing flush after TLB batching faiure
    
    commit ce9ec37bddb633404a0c23e1acb181a264e7f7f2 upstream.
    
    When unmapping a range of pages in zap_pte_range, the page being
    unmapped is added to an mmu_gather_batch structure for asynchronous
    freeing. If we run out of space in the batch structure before the range
    has been completely unmapped, then we break out of the loop, force a
    TLB flush and free the pages that we have batched so far. If there are
    further pages to unmap, then we resume the loop where we left off.
    
    Unfortunately, we forget to update addr when we break out of the loop,
    which causes us to truncate the range being invalidated as the end
    address is exclusive. When we re-enter the loop at the same address, the
    page has already been freed and the pte_present test will fail, meaning
    that we do not reconsider the address for invalidation.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by incrementing addr by the PAGE_SIZE
    before breaking out of the loop on batch failure.

    evm: check xattr value length and type in evm_inode_setxattr()
    
    commit 3b1deef6b1289a99505858a3b212c5b50adf0c2f upstream.
    
    evm_inode_setxattr() can be called with no value. The function does not
    check the length so that following command can be used to produce the
    kernel oops: setfattr -n security.evm FOO. This patch fixes it.
    
    Changes in v3:
    * there is no reason to return different error codes for EVM_XATTR_HMAC
      and non EVM_XATTR_HMAC. Remove unnecessary test then.
    
    Changes in v2:
    * testing for validity of xattr type

    commit 317168d0c766defd14b3d0e9c2c4a9a258b803ee upstream.
    
    In compat mode, we copy each field of snd_pcm_status struct but don't
    touch the reserved fields, and this leaves uninitialized values
    there.  Meanwhile the native ioctl does zero-clear the whole
    structure, so we should follow the same rule in compat mode, too.

    futex: Fix a race condition between REQUEUE_PI and task death
    
    commit 30a6b8031fe14031ab27c1fa3483cb9780e7f63c upstream.
    
    free_pi_state and exit_pi_state_list both clean up futex_pi_state's.
    exit_pi_state_list takes the hb lock first, and most callers of
    free_pi_state do too. requeue_pi doesn't, which means free_pi_state
    can free the pi_state out from under exit_pi_state_list. For example:
    
    task A                            |  task B
    exit_pi_state_list                |
      pi_state =                      |
          curr->pi_state_list->next   |
                                      |  futex_requeue(requeue_pi=1)
                                      |    // pi_state is the same as
                                      |    // the one in task A
                                      |    free_pi_state(pi_state)
                                      |      list_del_init(&pi_state->list)
                                      |      kfree(pi_state)
      list_del_init(&pi_state->list)  |
    
    Move the free_pi_state calls in requeue_pi to before it drops the hb
    locks which it's already holding.
    
    [ tglx: Removed a pointless free_pi_state() call and the hb->lock held
            debugging. The latter comes via a seperate patch ]

    posix-timers: Fix stack info leak in timer_create()
    
    commit 6891c4509c792209c44ced55a60f13954cb50ef4 upstream.
    
    If userland creates a timer without specifying a sigevent info, we'll
    create one ourself, using a stack local variable. Particularly will we
    use the timer ID as sival_int. But as sigev_value is a union containing
    a pointer and an int, that assignment will only partially initialize
    sigev_value on systems where the size of a pointer is bigger than the
    size of an int. On such systems we'll copy the uninitialized stack bytes
    from the timer_create() call to userland when the timer actually fires
    and we're going to deliver the signal.
    
    Initialize sigev_value with 0 to plug the stack info leak.
    
    Found in the PaX patch, written by the PaX Team.

    kvm: fix excessive pages un-pinning in kvm_iommu_map error path.
    
    commit 3d32e4dbe71374a6780eaf51d719d76f9a9bf22f upstream.
    
    The third parameter of kvm_unpin_pages() when called from
    kvm_iommu_map_pages() is wrong, it should be the number of pages to un-pin
    and not the page size.
    
    This error was facilitated with an inconsistent API: kvm_pin_pages() takes
    a size, but kvn_unpin_pages() takes a number of pages, so fix the problem
    by matching the two.
    
    This was introduced by commit 350b8bd ("kvm: iommu: fix the third parameter
    of kvm_iommu_put_pages (CVE-2014-3601)"), which fixes the lack of
    un-pinning for pages intended to be un-pinned (i.e. memory leak) but
    unfortunately potentially aggravated the number of pages we un-pin that
    should have stayed pinned. As far as I understand though, the same
    practical mitigations apply.
    
    This issue was found during review of Red Hat 6.6 patches to prepare
    Ksplice rebootless updates.
    
    Thanks to Vegard for his time on a late Friday evening to help me in
    understanding this code.

    MIPS: ftrace: Fix a microMIPS build problem
    
    commit aedd153f5bb5b1f1d6d9142014f521ae2ec294cc upstream.
    
    Code before the .fixup section needs to have the .insn directive.
    This has no side effects on MIPS32/64 but it affects the way microMIPS
    loads the address for the return label.
    
    Fixes the following build problem:
    mips-linux-gnu-ld: arch/mips/built-in.o: .fixup+0x4a0: Unsupported jump between
    ISA modes; consider recompiling with interlinking enabled.
    mips-linux-gnu-ld: final link failed: Bad value
    Makefile:819: recipe for target 'vmlinux' failed
    
    The fix is similar to 1658f914ff91c3bf ("MIPS: microMIPS:

    nfsd4: fix crash on unknown operation number
    
    commit 51904b08072a8bf2b9ed74d1bd7a5300a614471d upstream.
    
    Unknown operation numbers are caught in nfsd4_decode_compound() which
    sets op->opnum to OP_ILLEGAL and op->status to nfserr_op_illegal.  The
    error causes the main loop in nfsd4_proc_compound() to skip most
    processing.  But nfsd4_proc_compound also peeks ahead at the next
    operation in one case and doesn't take similar precautions there.

    usb: gadget: udc: core: fix kernel oops with soft-connect
    
    commit bfa6b18c680450c17512c741ed1d818695747621 upstream.
    
    Currently, there's no guarantee that udc->driver
    will be valid when using soft_connect sysfs
    interface. In fact, we can very easily trigger
    a NULL pointer dereference by trying to disconnect
    when a gadget driver isn't loaded.

    x86, apic: Handle a bad TSC more gracefully
    
    commit b47dcbdc5161d3d5756f430191e2840d9b855492 upstream.
    
    If the TSC is unusable or disabled, then this patch fixes:
    
     - Confusion while trying to clear old APIC interrupts.
     - Division by zero and incorrect programming of the TSC deadline
       timer.
    
    This fixes boot if the CPU has a TSC deadline timer but a missing or
    broken TSC.  The failure to boot can be observed with qemu using
    -cpu qemu64,-tsc,+tsc-deadline
    
    This also happens to me in nested KVM for unknown reasons.
    With this patch, I can boot cleanly (although without a TSC).

    commit 42fa4250436304d4650fa271f37671f6cee24e08 upstream.
    
    On virtual environments, apic_read could take a long time. As a
    result, under certain conditions the ack pending loop may exit
    without any queued irqs left, but after more than one second. A
    warning will be printed needlessly in this case.
    
    If the loop is about to exit regardless of max_loops, don't

    ext3: Don't check quota format when there are no quota files
    
    commit 7938db449bbc55bbeb164bec7af406212e7e98f1 upstream.
    
    The check whether quota format is set even though there are no
    quota files with journalled quota is pointless and it actually
    makes it impossible to turn off journalled quotas (as there's
    no way to unset journalled quota format). Just remove the check.

    dm raid: ensure superblock's size matches device's logical block size
    
    commit 40d43c4b4cac4c2647bf07110d7b07d35f399a84 upstream.
    
    The dm-raid superblock (struct dm_raid_superblock) is padded to 512
    bytes and that size is being used to read it in from the metadata
    device into one preallocated page.
    
    Reading or writing this on a 512-byte sector device works fine but on
    a 4096-byte sector device this fails.
    
    Set the dm-raid superblock's size to the logical block size of the
    metadata device, because IO at that size is guaranteed too work.  Also
    add a size check to avoid silent partial metadata loss in case the
    superblock should ever grow past the logical block size or PAGE_SIZE.

    Add a helper memzero_explicit() (similarly as explicit_bzero() variants)
    that can be used in such cases where a variable with sensitive data is
    being cleared out in the end. Other use cases might also be in crypto
    code. [ I have put this into lib/string.c though, as it's always built-in
    and doesn't need any dependencies then. ]

    dm bufio: change __GFP_IO to __GFP_FS in shrinker callbacks
    
    commit 9d28eb12447ee08bb5d1e8bb3195cf20e1ecd1c0 upstream.
    
    The shrinker uses gfp flags to indicate what kind of operation can the
    driver wait for. If __GFP_IO flag is present, the driver can wait for
    block I/O operations, if __GFP_FS flag is present, the driver can wait on
    operations involving the filesystem.
    
    dm-bufio tested for __GFP_IO. However, dm-bufio can run on a loop block
    device that makes calls into the filesystem. If __GFP_IO is present and
    __GFP_FS isn't, dm-bufio could still block on filesystem operations if it
    runs on a loop block device.
    
    The change from __GFP_IO to __GFP_FS supposedly fixes one observed (though
    unreproducible) deadlock involving dm-bufio and loop device.

    selinux: fix inode security list corruption
    
    commit 923190d32de4428afbea5e5773be86bea60a9925 upstream.
    
    sb_finish_set_opts() can race with inode_free_security()
    when initializing inode security structures for inodes
    created prior to initial policy load or by the filesystem
    during ->mount().   This appears to have always been
    a possible race, but commit 3dc91d4 ("SELinux:  Fix possible
    NULL pointer dereference in selinux_inode_permission()")
    made it more evident by immediately reusing the unioned
    list/rcu element  of the inode security structure for call_rcu()
    upon an inode_free_security().  But the underlying issue
    was already present before that commit as a possible use-after-free
    of isec.
    
    Shivnandan Kumar reported the list corruption and proposed
    a patch to split the list and rcu elements out of the union
    as separate fields of the inode_security_struct so that setting
    the rcu element would not affect the list element.  However,
    this would merely hide the issue and not truly fix the code.
    
    This patch instead moves up the deletion of the list entry
    prior to dropping the sbsec->isec_lock initially.  Then,
    if the inode is dropped subsequently, there will be no further
    references to the isec.

    ALSA: emu10k1: Fix deadlock in synth voice lookup
    
    commit 95926035b187cc9fee6fb61385b7da9c28123f74 upstream.
    
    The emu10k1 voice allocator takes voice_lock spinlock.  When there is
    no empty stream available, it tries to release a voice used by synth,
    and calls get_synth_voice.  The callback function,
    snd_emu10k1_synth_get_voice(), however, also takes the voice_lock,
    thus it deadlocks.
    
    The fix is simply removing the voice_lock holds in
    snd_emu10k1_synth_get_voice(), as this is always called in the
    spinlock context.

    ext4: fix reservation overflow in ext4_da_write_begin
    
    commit 0ff8947fc5f700172b37cbca811a38eb9cb81e08 upstream.
    
    Delalloc write journal reservations only reserve 1 credit,
    to update the inode if necessary.  However, it may happen
    once in a filesystem's lifetime that a file will cross
    the 2G threshold, and require the LARGE_FILE feature to
    be set in the superblock as well, if it was not set already.
    
    This overruns the transaction reservation, and can be
    demonstrated simply on any ext4 filesystem without the LARGE_FILE
    feature already set:
    
    dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1 seek=2147483646 count=1 \
            conv=notrunc of=testfile
    sync
    dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1 seek=2147483647 count=1 \
            conv=notrunc of=testfile
    
    leads to:
    
    EXT4-fs: ext4_do_update_inode:4296: aborting transaction: error 28 in __ext4_handle_dirty_super
    EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_do_update_inode:4301: error 28
    EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_reserve_inode_write:4757: Readonly filesystem
    EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_dirty_inode:4876: error 28
    EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_da_write_end:2685: error 28
    
    Adjust the number of credits based on whether the flag is
    already set, and whether the current write may extend past the
    LARGE_FILE limit.

    fanotify: enable close-on-exec on events' fd when requested in fanotify_init()
    
    commit 0b37e097a648aa71d4db1ad108001e95b69a2da4 upstream.
    
    According to commit 80af258867648 ("fanotify: groups can specify their
    f_flags for new fd"), file descriptors created as part of file access
    notification events inherit flags from the event_f_flags argument passed
    to syscall fanotify_init(2)[1].
    
    Unfortunately O_CLOEXEC is currently silently ignored.
    
    Indeed, event_f_flags are only given to dentry_open(), which only seems to
    care about O_ACCMODE and O_PATH in do_dentry_open(), O_DIRECT in
    open_check_o_direct() and O_LARGEFILE in generic_file_open().
    
    It's a pity, since, according to some lookup on various search engines and
    http://codesearch.debian.net/, there's already some userspace code which
    use O_CLOEXEC:
    
    - in systemd's readahead[2]:
    
        fanotify_fd = fanotify_init(FAN_CLOEXEC|FAN_NONBLOCK, O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE|O_CLOEXEC|O_NOATIME);
    
    - in clsync[3]:
    
        #define FANOTIFY_EVFLAGS (O_LARGEFILE|O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC)
    
        int fanotify_d = fanotify_init(FANOTIFY_FLAGS, FANOTIFY_EVFLAGS);
    
    - in examples [4] from "Filesystem monitoring in the Linux
      kernel" article[5] by Aleksander Morgado:
    
        if ((fanotify_fd = fanotify_init (FAN_CLOEXEC,
                                          O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC | O_LARGEFILE)) < 0)
    
    Additionally, since commit 48149e9d3a7e ("fanotify: check file flags
    passed in fanotify_init").  having O_CLOEXEC as part of fanotify_init()
    second argument is expressly allowed.
    
    So it seems expected to set close-on-exec flag on the file descriptors if
    userspace is allowed to request it with O_CLOEXEC.
    
    But Andrew Morton raised[6] the concern that enabling now close-on-exec
    might break existing applications which ask for O_CLOEXEC but expect the
    file descriptor to be inherited across exec().
    
    In the other hand, as reported by Mihai Dontu[7] close-on-exec on the file
    descriptor returned as part of file access notify can break applications
    due to deadlock.  So close-on-exec is needed for most applications.
    
    More, applications asking for close-on-exec are likely expecting it to be
    enabled, relying on O_CLOEXEC being effective.  If not, it might weaken
    their security, as noted by Jan Kara[8].
    
    So this patch replaces call to macro get_unused_fd() by a call to function
    get_unused_fd_flags() with event_f_flags value as argument.  This way
    O_CLOEXEC flag in the second argument of fanotify_init(2) syscall is
    interpreted and close-on-exec get enabled when requested.

    commit b8839b8c55f3fdd60dc36abcda7e0266aff7985c upstream.
    
    The math in both blk_stack_limits() and queue_limit_alignment_offset()
    assume that a block device's io_min (aka minimum_io_size) is always a
    power-of-2.  Fix the math such that it works for non-power-of-2 io_min.
    
    This issue (of alignment_offset != 0) became apparent when testing
    dm-thinp with a thinp blocksize that matches a RAID6 stripesize of
    1280K.  Commit fdfb4c8c1 ("dm thin: set minimum_io_size to pool's data
    block size") unlocked the potential for alignment_offset != 0 due to
    the dm-thin-pool's io_min possibly being a non-power-of-2.

    fix misuses of f_count() in ppp and netlink
    
    commit 24dff96a37a2ca319e75a74d3929b2de22447ca6 upstream.
    
    we used to check for "nobody else could start doing anything with
    that opened file" by checking that refcount was 2 or less - one
    for descriptor table and one we'd acquired in fget() on the way to
    wherever we are.  That was race-prone (somebody else might have
    had a reference to descriptor table and do fget() just as we'd
    been checking) and it had become flat-out incorrect back when
    we switched to fget_light() on those codepaths - unlike fget(),
    it doesn't grab an extra reference unless the descriptor table
    is shared.  The same change allowed a race-free check, though -
    we are safe exactly when refcount is less than 2.
    
    It was a long time ago; pre-2.6.12 for ioctl() (the codepath leading
    to ppp one) and 2.6.17 for sendmsg() (netlink one).  OTOH,
    netlink hadn't grown that check until 3.9 and ppp used to live
    in drivers/net, not drivers/net/ppp until 3.1.  The bug existed
    well before that, though, and the same fix used to apply in old
    location of file.

    fs: make cont_expand_zero interruptible
    
    commit c2ca0fcd202863b14bd041a7fece2e789926c225 upstream.
    
    This patch makes it possible to kill a process looping in
    cont_expand_zero. A process may spend a lot of time in this function, so
    it is desirable to be able to kill it.
    
    It happened to me that I wanted to copy a piece data from the disk to a
    file. By mistake, I used the "seek" parameter to dd instead of "skip". Due
    to the "seek" parameter, dd attempted to extend the file and became stuck
    doing so - the only possibility was to reset the machine or wait many
    hours until the filesystem runs out of space and cont_expand_zero fails.
    We need this patch to be able to terminate the process.

    pata_serverworks: disable 64-KB DMA transfers on Broadcom OSB4 IDE Controller
    
    commit 37017ac6849e772e67dd187ba2fbd056c4afa533 upstream.
    
    The Broadcom OSB4 IDE Controller (vendor and device IDs: 1166:0211)
    does not support 64-KB DMA transfers.
    Whenever a 64-KB DMA transfer is attempted,
    the transfer fails and messages similar to the following
    are written to the console log:

    When the libata and pata_serverworks modules

    the 64-KB transfer size in the scatter-gather list can be seen
    in the console log:

               I/O ports at 1440 [size=16]
               Kernel driver in use: pata_serverworks
    
    The pata_serverworks driver supports five distinct device IDs,
    one being the OSB4 and the other four belonging to the CSB series.
    The CSB series appears to support 64-KB DMA transfers,
    as tests on a machine with an SAI2 motherboard
    containing a Broadcom CSB5 IDE Controller (vendor and device IDs: 1166:0212)
    showed no problems with 64-KB DMA transfers.
    
    This problem was first discovered when attempting to install openSUSE
    from a DVD on a machine with an STL2 motherboard.
    Using the pata_serverworks module,
    older releases of openSUSE will not install at all due to the timeouts.
    Releases of openSUSE prior to 11.3 can be installed by disabling
    the pata_serverworks module using the brokenmodules boot parameter,
    which causes the serverworks module to be used instead.
    Recent releases of openSUSE (12.2 and later) include better error recovery and
    will install, though very slowly.
    On all openSUSE releases, the problem can be recreated
    on a machine containing a Broadcom OSB4 IDE Controller
    by mounting an install DVD and running a command similar to the following:
    
       find /mnt -type f -print | xargs cat > /dev/null
    
    The patch below corrects the problem.
    Similar to the other ATA drivers that do not support 64-KB DMA transfers,
    the patch changes the ata_port_operations qc_prep vector to point to a routine
    that breaks any 64-KB segment into two 32-KB segments and
    changes the scsi_host_template sg_tablesize element to reduce by half
    the number of scatter/gather elements allowed.
    These two changes affect only the OSB4.

    ext4: add ext4_iget_normal() which is to be used for dir tree lookups
    
    commit f4bb2981024fc91b23b4d09a8817c415396dbabb upstream.
    
    If there is a corrupted file system which has directory entries that
    point at reserved, metadata inodes, prohibit them from being used by
    treating them the same way we treat Boot Loader inodes --- that is,
    mark them to be bad inodes.  This prohibits them from being opened,
    deleted, or modified via chmod, chown, utimes, etc.
    
    In particular, this prevents a corrupted file system which has a
    directory entry which points at the journal inode from being deleted
    and its blocks released, after which point Much Hilarity Ensues.

    ext4: don't orphan or truncate the boot loader inode
    
    commit e2bfb088fac03c0f621886a04cffc7faa2b49b1d upstream.
    
    The boot loader inode (inode #5) should never be visible in the
    directory hierarchy, but it's possible if the file system is corrupted
    that there will be a directory entry that points at inode #5.  In
    order to avoid accidentally trashing it, when such a directory inode
    is opened, the inode will be marked as a bad inode, so that it's not
    possible to modify (or read) the inode from userspace.
    
    Unfortunately, when we unlink this (invalid/illegal) directory entry,
    we will put the bad inode on the ophan list, and then when try to
    unlink the directory, we don't actually remove the bad inode from the
    orphan list before freeing in-memory inode structure.  This means the
    in-memory orphan list is corrupted, leading to a kernel oops.
    
    In addition, avoid truncating a bad inode in ext4_destroy_inode(),
    since truncating the boot loader inode is not a smart thing to do.

    commit eb76faf53b1ff7a77ce3f78cc98ad392ac70c2a0 upstream.
    
    The 'last_accessed' member of the dm_buffer structure was only set when
    the the buffer was created.  This led to each buffer being discarded
    after dm_bufio_max_age time even if it was used recently.  In practice
    this resulted in all thinp metadata being evicted soon after being read
    -- this is particularly problematic for metadata intensive workloads
    like multithreaded small random IO.
    
    'last_accessed' is now updated each time the buffer is moved to the head
    of the LRU list, so the buffer is now properly discarded if it was not
    used in dm_bufio_max_age time.

    m68k: Disable/restore interrupts in hwreg_present()/hwreg_write()
    
    commit e4dc601bf99ccd1c95b7e6eef1d3cf3c4b0d4961 upstream.
    
    hwreg_present() and hwreg_write() temporarily change the VBR register to
    another vector table. This table contains a valid bus error handler
    only, all other entries point to arbitrary addresses.
    
    If an interrupt comes in while the temporary table is active, the
    processor will start executing at such an arbitrary address, and the
    kernel will crash.
    
    While most callers run early, before interrupts are enabled, or
    explicitly disable interrupts, Finn Thain pointed out that macsonic has
    one callsite that doesn't, causing intermittent boot crashes.
    There's another unsafe callsite in hilkbd.
    
    Fix this for good by disabling and restoring interrupts inside
    hwreg_present() and hwreg_write().
    
    Explicitly disabling interrupts can be removed from the callsites later.

    vfs: fix data corruption when blocksize < pagesize for mmaped data
    
    commit 90a8020278c1598fafd071736a0846b38510309c upstream.
    
    ->page_mkwrite() is used by filesystems to allocate blocks under a page
    which is becoming writeably mmapped in some process' address space. This
    allows a filesystem to return a page fault if there is not enough space
    available, user exceeds quota or similar problem happens, rather than
    silently discarding data later when writepage is called.
    
    However VFS fails to call ->page_mkwrite() in all the cases where
    filesystems need it when blocksize < pagesize. For example when
    blocksize = 1024, pagesize = 4096 the following is problematic:
      ftruncate(fd, 0);
      pwrite(fd, buf, 1024, 0);
      map = mmap(NULL, 1024, PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
      map[0] = 'a';       ----> page_mkwrite() for index 0 is called
      ftruncate(fd, 10000); /* or even pwrite(fd, buf, 1, 10000) */
      mremap(map, 1024, 10000, 0);
      map[4095] = 'a';    ----> no page_mkwrite() called
    
    At the moment ->page_mkwrite() is called, filesystem can allocate only
    one block for the page because i_size == 1024. Otherwise it would create
    blocks beyond i_size which is generally undesirable. But later at
    ->writepage() time, we also need to store data at offset 4095 but we
    don't have block allocated for it.
    
    This patch introduces a helper function filesystems can use to have
    ->page_mkwrite() called at all the necessary moments.

    commit 082f58ac4a48d3f5cb4597232cb2ac6823a96f43 upstream.
    
    During temporary resource starvation at lower transport layer, command
    is placed on queue full retry path, which expose this problem.  The TCM
    queue full handling of SCF_TRANSPORT_TASK_SENSE currently sends the same

    NFSv4.1: Fix an NFSv4.1 state renewal regression
    
    commit d1f456b0b9545f1606a54cd17c20775f159bd2ce upstream.
    
    Commit 2f60ea6b8ced ("NFSv4: The NFSv4.0 client must send RENEW calls if it holds a delegation") set the NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag in nfs4_renew_state, and does
    not put an nfs41_proc_async_sequence call, the NFSv4.1 lease renewal heartbeat
    call, on the wire to renew the NFSv4.1 state if the flag was not set.
    
    The NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag is set when "now" is after the last renewal
    (cl_last_renewal) plus the lease time divided by 3. This is arbitrary and
    sometimes does the following:
    
    In normal operation, the only way a future state renewal call is put on the
    wire is via a call to nfs4_schedule_state_renewal, which schedules a
    nfs4_renew_state workqueue task. nfs4_renew_state determines if the
    NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT should be set, and the calls nfs41_proc_async_sequence,
    which only gets sent if the NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag is set.
    Then the nfs41_proc_async_sequence rpc_release function schedules
    another state remewal via nfs4_schedule_state_renewal.
    
    Without this change we can get into a state where an application stops
    accessing the NFSv4.1 share, state renewal calls stop due to the
    NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag _not_ being set. The only way to recover
    from this situation is with a clientid re-establishment, once the application
    resumes and the server has timed out the lease and so returns
    NFS4ERR_BAD_SESSION on the subsequent SEQUENCE operation.
    
    An example application:
    open, lock, write a file.
    
    sleep for 6 * lease (could be less)
    
    ulock, close.
    
    In the above example with NFSv4.1 delegations enabled, without this change,
    there are no OP_SEQUENCE state renewal calls during the sleep, and the
    clientid is recovered due to lease expiration on the close.
    
    This issue does not occur with NFSv4.1 delegations disabled, nor with
    NFSv4.0, with or without delegations enabled.

    framebuffer: fix screen corruption when copying
    
    commit 5b789da8a7fc357661fc61faaf853e9161cc9700 upstream.
    
    The function bitcpy_rev has a bug that may result in screen corruption.
    The bug happens under these conditions:
    * the end of the destination area of a copy operation is aligned on a long
      word boundary
    * the end of the source area is not aligned on a long word boundary
    * we are copying more than one long word
    
    In this case, the variable shift is non-zero and the variable first is
    zero. The statements FB_WRITEL(comp(d0, FB_READL(dst), first), dst) reads
    the last long word of the destination and writes it back unchanged
    (because first is zero). Correctly, we should write the variable d0 to the
    last word of the destination in this case.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by introducing and extra test if first is zero.
    
    The patch also removes the references to fb_memmove in the code that is
    commented out because fb_memmove was removed from framebuffer subsystem.

    framebuffer: fix border color
    
    commit f74a289b9480648a654e5afd8458c2263c03a1e1 upstream.
    
    The framebuffer code uses the current background color to fill the border
    when switching consoles, however, this results in inconsistent behavior.
    For example:
    - start Midnigh Commander
    - the border is black
    - switch to another console and switch back
    - the border is cyan
    - type something into the command line in mc
    - the border is cyan
    - switch to another console and switch back
    - the border is black
    - press F9 to go to menu
    - the border is black
    - switch to another console and switch back
    - the border is dark blue
    
    When switching to a console with Midnight Commander, the border is random
    color that was left selected by the slang subsystem.
    
    This patch fixes this inconsistency by always using black as the
    background color when switching consoles.

    lzo: check for length overrun in variable length encoding.
    
    commit 72cf90124e87d975d0b2114d930808c58b4c05e4 upstream.
    
    This fix ensures that we never meet an integer overflow while adding
    255 while parsing a variable length encoding. It works differently from
    commit 206a81c ("lzo: properly check for overruns") because instead of
    ensuring that we don't overrun the input, which is tricky to guarantee
    due to many assumptions in the code, it simply checks that the cumulated
    number of 255 read cannot overflow by bounding this number.
    
    The MAX_255_COUNT is the maximum number of times we can add 255 to a base
    count without overflowing an integer. The multiply will overflow when
    multiplying 255 by more than MAXINT/255. The sum will overflow earlier
    depending on the base count. Since the base count is taken from a u8
    and a few bits, it is safe to assume that it will always be lower than
    or equal to 2*255, thus we can always prevent any overflow by accepting
    two less 255 steps.
    
    This patch also reduces the CPU overhead and actually increases performance
    by 1.1% compared to the initial code, while the previous fix costs 3.1%
    (measured on x86_64).
    
    The fix needs to be backported to all currently supported stable kernels.

    Two bits control TX power on BBP_R1 register. Correct the mask,
    otherwise we clear additional bit on BBP_R1 register, what can have
    unknown, possible negative effect.

    x86/intel/quark: Switch off CR4.PGE so TLB flush uses CR3 instead
    
    commit ee1b5b165c0a2f04d2107e634e51f05d0eb107de upstream.
    
    Quark x1000 advertises PGE via the standard CPUID method
    PGE bits exist in Quark X1000's PTEs. In order to flush
    an individual PTE it is necessary to reload CR3 irrespective
    of the PTE.PGE bit.
    
    See Quark Core_DevMan_001.pdf section 6.4.11
    
    This bug was fixed in Galileo kernels, unfixed vanilla kernels are expected to
    crash and burn on this platform.

    kvm: don't take vcpu mutex for obviously invalid vcpu ioctls
    
    commit 2ea75be3219571d0ec009ce20d9971e54af96e09 upstream.
    
    vcpu ioctls can hang the calling thread if issued while a vcpu is running.
    However, invalid ioctls can happen when userspace tries to probe the kind
    of file descriptors (e.g. isatty() calls ioctl(TCGETS)); in that case,
    we know the ioctl is going to be rejected as invalid anyway and we can
    fail before trying to take the vcpu mutex.
    
    This patch does not change functionality, it just makes invalid ioctls
    fail faster.

    commit b29ef3546aecb253a5552b198cef23750d56e1e4 upstream.
    
    Minimize failures in this function by pre-allocating the buffer
    for posting messages. The hypercall for posting the message can fail
    for a number of reasons:
    
            1. Transient resource related issues
            2. Buffer alignment
            3. Buffer cannot span a page boundry
    
    We address issues 2 and 3 by preallocating a per-cpu page for the buffer.
    Transient resource related failures are handled by retrying by the callers
    of this function.
    
    This patch is based on the investigation
    done by Dexuan Cui <decui@microsoft.com>.

    USB: Add device quirk for ASUS T100 Base Station keyboard
    
    commit ddbe1fca0bcb87ca8c199ea873a456ca8a948567 upstream.
    
    This full-speed USB device generates spurious remote wakeup event
    as soon as USB_DEVICE_REMOTE_WAKEUP feature is set. As the result,
    Linux can't enter system suspend and S0ix power saving modes once
    this keyboard is used.
    
    This patch tries to introduce USB_QUIRK_IGNORE_REMOTE_WAKEUP quirk.
    With this quirk set, wakeup capability will be ignored during
    device configure.

    v4l2-common: fix overflow in v4l_bound_align_image()
    
    commit 3bacc10cd4a85bc70bc0b6c001d3bf995c7fe04c upstream.
    
    Fix clamp_align() used in v4l_bound_align_image() to prevent overflow
    when passed large value like UINT32_MAX.
    
     In the current implementation:
        clamp_align(UINT32_MAX, 8, 8192, 3)
    
    returns 8, because in line:
    
        x = (x + (1 << (align - 1))) & mask;
    
    x overflows to (-1 + 4) & 0x7 = 3, while expected value is 8192.
    
    v4l_bound_align_image() is heavily used in VIDIOC_S_FMT and
    VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT ioctls handlers, and documentation of the latter
    explicitly states that:
    
    "The modified format should be as close as possible to the original
    request."
      -- http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html
    
    Thus one would expect, that passing UINT32_MAX as format width and
    height will result in setting maximum possible resolution for the
    device. Particularly, when the driver doesn't support
    VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES ioctl, which is common in the codebase.

    PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface class
    
    commit 89ec3dcf17fd3fa009ecf8faaba36828dd6bc416 upstream.
    
    Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
    automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
    is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.
    
    The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
    r3.0, Appendix D.  Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
    alpha characters, so they won't be affected.  For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
    20h, etc. are unaffected.
    
    Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
    already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.

    ext4: don't check quota format when there are no quota files
    
    commit 279bf6d390933d5353ab298fcc306c391a961469 upstream.
    
    The check whether quota format is set even though there are no
    quota files with journalled quota is pointless and it actually
    makes it impossible to turn off journalled quotas (as there's
    no way to unset journalled quota format). Just remove the check.

    PCI: Increase IBM ipr SAS Crocodile BARs to at least system page size
    
    commit 9fe373f9997b48fcd6222b95baf4a20c134b587a upstream.
    
    The Crocodile chip occasionally comes up with 4k and 8k BAR sizes.  Due to
    an erratum, setting the SR-IOV page size causes the physical function BARs
    to expand to the system page size.  Since ppc64 uses 64k pages, when Linux
    tries to assign the smaller resource sizes to the now 64k BARs the address
    will be truncated and the BARs will overlap.
    
    Force Linux to allocate the resource as a full page, which avoids the
    overlap.

    PCI: pciehp: Prevent NULL dereference during probe
    
    commit bceee4a97eb58bd0e80e39eff11b506ddd9e7ad3 upstream.
    
    pciehp assumes that dev->subordinate, the struct pci_bus for a bridge's
    secondary bus, exists.  But we do not create that bus if we run out of bus
    numbers during enumeration.  This leads to a NULL dereference in
    init_slot() (and other places).
    
    Change pciehp_probe() to return -ENODEV when no secondary bus is present.

    ext4: check EA value offset when loading
    
    commit a0626e75954078cfacddb00a4545dde821170bc5 upstream.
    
    When loading extended attributes, check each entry's value offset to
    make sure it doesn't collide with the entries.
    
    Without this check it is easy to crash the kernel by mounting a
    malicious FS containing a file with an EA wherein e_value_offs = 0 and
    e_value_size > 0 and then deleting the EA, which corrupts the name
    list.
    
    (See the f_ea_value_crash test's FS image in e2fsprogs for an example.)

    UBIFS: fix free log space calculation
    
    commit ba29e721eb2df6df8f33c1f248388bb037a47914 upstream.
    
    Hu (hujianyang <hujianyang@huawei.com>) discovered an issue in the
    'empty_log_bytes()' function, which calculates how many bytes are left in the
    log:
    
    "
    If 'c->lhead_lnum + 1 == c->ltail_lnum' and 'c->lhead_offs == c->leb_size', 'h'
    would equalent to 't' and 'empty_log_bytes()' would return 'c->log_bytes'
    instead of 0.
    "
    
    At this point it is not clear what would be the consequences of this, and
    whether this may lead to any problems, but this patch addresses the issue just
    in case.

    UBIFS: fix a race condition
    
    commit 052c28073ff26f771d44ef33952a41d18dadd255 upstream.
    
    Hu (hujianyang@huawei.com) discovered a race condition which may lead to a
    situation when UBIFS is unable to mount the file-system after an unclean
    reboot. The problem is theoretical, though.
    
    In UBIFS, we have the log, which basically a set of LEBs in a certain area. The
    log has the tail and the head.
    
    Every time user writes data to the file-system, the UBIFS journal grows, and
    the log grows as well, because we append new reference nodes to the head of the
    log. So the head moves forward all the time, while the log tail stays at the
    same position.
    
    At any time, the UBIFS master node points to the tail of the log. When we mount
    the file-system, we scan the log, and we always start from its tail, because
    this is where the master node points to. The only occasion when the tail of the
    log changes is the commit operation.
    
    The commit operation has 2 phases - "commit start" and "commit end". The former
    is relatively short, and does not involve much I/O. During this phase we mostly
    just build various in-memory lists of the things which have to be written to
    the flash media during "commit end" phase.
    
    During the commit start phase, what we do is we "clean" the log. Indeed, the
    commit operation will index all the data in the journal, so the entire journal
    "disappears", and therefore the data in the log become unneeded. So we just
    move the head of the log to the next LEB, and write the CS node there. This LEB
    will be the tail of the new log when the commit operation finishes.
    
    When the "commit start" phase finishes, users may write more data to the
    file-system, in parallel with the ongoing "commit end" operation. At this point
    the log tail was not changed yet, it is the same as it had been before we
    started the commit. The log head keeps moving forward, though.
    
    The commit operation now needs to write the new master node, and the new master
    node should point to the new log tail. After this the LEBs between the old log
    tail and the new log tail can be unmapped and re-used again.
    
    And here is the possible problem. We do 2 operations: (a) We first update the
    log tail position in memory (see 'ubifs_log_end_commit()'). (b) And then we
    write the master node (see the big lock of code in 'do_commit()').
    
    But nothing prevents the log head from moving forward between (a) and (b), and
    the log head may "wrap" now to the old log tail. And when the "wrap" happens,
    the contends of the log tail gets erased. Now a power cut happens and we are in
    trouble. We end up with the old master node pointing to the old tail, which was
    erased. And replay fails because it expects the master node to point to the
    correct log tail at all times.
    
    This patch merges the abovementioned (a) and (b) operations by moving the master
    node change code to the 'ubifs_log_end_commit()' function, so that it runs with
    the log mutex locked, which will prevent the log from being changed benween
    operations (a) and (b).

    The 'mst_mutex' is not needed since because 'ubifs_write_master()' is only
    called on the mount path and commit path. The mount path is sequential and
    there is no parallelism, and the commit path is also serialized - there is only
    one commit going on at a time.

    kvm: x86: fix stale mmio cache bug
    
    commit 56f17dd3fbc44adcdbc3340fe3988ddb833a47a7 upstream.
    
    The following events can lead to an incorrect KVM_EXIT_MMIO bubbling
    up to userspace:
    
    (1) Guest accesses gpa X without a memory slot. The gfn is cached in
    struct kvm_vcpu_arch (mmio_gfn). On Intel EPT-enabled hosts, KVM sets
    the SPTE write-execute-noread so that future accesses cause
    EPT_MISCONFIGs.
    
    (2) Host userspace creates a memory slot via KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION
    covering the page just accessed.
    
    (3) Guest attempts to read or write to gpa X again. On Intel, this
    generates an EPT_MISCONFIG. The memory slot generation number that
    was incremented in (2) would normally take care of this but we fast
    path mmio faults through quickly_check_mmio_pf(), which only checks
    the per-vcpu mmio cache. Since we hit the cache, KVM passes a
    KVM_EXIT_MMIO up to userspace.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by using the memslot generation number
    to validate the mmio cache.
