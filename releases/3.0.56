    scsi: Silence unnecessary warnings about ioctl to partition
    
    commit 6d9359280753d2955f86d6411047516a9431eb51 upstream.
    
    Sometimes, warnings about ioctls to partition happen often enough that they
    form majority of the warnings in the kernel log and users complain. In some
    cases warnings are about ioctls such as SG_IO so it's not good to get rid of
    the warnings completely as they can ease debugging of userspace problems
    when ioctl is refused.
    
    Since I have seen warnings from lots of commands, including some proprietary
    userspace applications, I don't think disallowing the ioctls for processes
    with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will happen in the near future if ever. So lets just
    stop warning for processes with CAP_SYS_RAWIO for which ioctl is allowed.

    i915: Quirk no_lvds on Gigabyte GA-D525TUD ITX motherboard
    
    commit a51d4ed01e5bb39d2cf36a12f9976ab08872c192 upstream.
    
    This board is incorrectly detected as having an LVDS connector,
    resulting in the VGA output (the only available output on the board)
    showing the console only in the top-left 1024x768 pixels, and an extra
    LVDS connector appearing in X.
    
    It's a desktop Mini-ITX board using an Atom D525 CPU with an NM10
    chipset.
    
    I've had this board for about a year, but this is the first time I
    noticed the issue because I've been running it headless for most of its
    life.

    route: release dst_entry.hh_cache when handling redirects
    
    Stable-3.0 commit 42ab5316 (ipv4: fix redirect handling) was
    backport of mainline commit 9cc20b26 from 3.2-rc3 where hh
    member of struct dst_entry was already gone.
    
    However, in 3.0 we still have it and we have to clean it as
    well, otherwise it keeps pointing to the cleaned up (and
    unusable) hh_cache entry and packets cannot be sent out.

    mm/vmemmap: fix wrong use of virt_to_page
    
    commit ae64ffcac35de0db628ba9631edf8ff34c5cd7ac upstream.
    
    I enable CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL and CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP, when doing
    memory hotremove, there is a kernel BUG at arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c:20.
    
    It is caused by free_section_usemap()->virt_to_page(), virt_to_page() is
    only used for kernel direct mapping address, but sparse-vmemmap uses
    vmemmap address, so it is going wrong here.

    commit d356cf5a74afa32b40decca3c9dd88bc3cd63eb5 upstream.
    
    PMU interrupts start at IRQ_DOVE_PMU_START, not IRQ_DOVE_PMU_START + 1.
    Fix the condition.  (It may have been less likely to occur had the code
    been written "if (irq >= IRQ_DOVE_PMU_START" which imho is the easier
    to understand notation, and matches the normal way of thinking about
    these things.)

    Dove: Attempt to fix PMU/RTC interrupts
    
    commit 5d3df935426271016b895aecaa247101b4bfa35e upstream.
    
    Fix the acknowledgement of PMU interrupts on Dove: some Dove hardware
    has not been sensibly designed so that interrupts can be handled in a
    race free manner.  The PMU is one such instance.
    
    The pending (aka 'cause') register is a bunch of RW bits, meaning that
    these bits can be both cleared and set by software (confirmed on the
    Armada-510 on the cubox.)
    
    Hardware sets the appropriate bit when an interrupt is asserted, and
    software is required to clear the bits which are to be processed.  If
    we write ~(1 << bit), then we end up asserting every other interrupt
    except the one we're processing.  So, we need to do a read-modify-write
    cycle to clear the asserted bit.
    
    However, any interrupts which occur in the middle of this cycle will
    also be written back as zero, which will also clear the new interrupts.
    
    The upshot of this is: there is _no_ way to safely clear down interrupts
    in this register (and other similarly behaving interrupt pending
    registers on this device.)  The patch below at least stops us creating
    new interrupts.
