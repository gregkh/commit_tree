    ppc/kvm: Replace ACCESS_ONCE with READ_ONCE

    ACCESS_ONCE does not work reliably on non-scalar types. For
    example gcc 4.6 and 4.7 might remove the volatile tag for such
    accesses during the SRA (scalar replacement of aggregates) step
    (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58145)

    Currently maximum space limit quota format supports is in blocks however
    since we store space limits in bytes, this is somewhat confusing. So
    store the maximum limit in bytes as well. Also rename the field to match
    the new unit and related inode field to match the new naming scheme.

    x86/spinlocks/paravirt: Fix memory corruption on unlock
    
    commit d6abfdb2022368d8c6c4be3f11a06656601a6cc2 upstream.
    
    Paravirt spinlock clears slowpath flag after doing unlock.
    As explained by Linus currently it does:
    
                    prev = *lock;
                    add_smp(&lock->tickets.head, TICKET_LOCK_INC);
    
                    /* add_smp() is a full mb() */
    
                    if (unlikely(lock->tickets.tail & TICKET_SLOWPATH_FLAG))
                            __ticket_unlock_slowpath(lock, prev);
    
    which is *exactly* the kind of things you cannot do with spinlocks,
    because after you've done the "add_smp()" and released the spinlock
    for the fast-path, you can't access the spinlock any more.  Exactly
    because a fast-path lock might come in, and release the whole data
    structure.
    
    Linus suggested that we should not do any writes to lock after unlock(),
    and we can move slowpath clearing to fastpath lock.
    
    So this patch implements the fix with:
    
     1. Moving slowpath flag to head (Oleg):
        Unlocked locks don't care about the slowpath flag; therefore we can keep
        it set after the last unlock, and clear it again on the first (try)lock.
        -- this removes the write after unlock. note that keeping slowpath flag would
        result in unnecessary kicks.
        By moving the slowpath flag from the tail to the head ticket we also avoid
        the need to access both the head and tail tickets on unlock.
    
     2. use xadd to avoid read/write after unlock that checks the need for
        unlock_kick (Linus):
        We further avoid the need for a read-after-release by using xadd;
        the prev head value will include the slowpath flag and indicate if we
        need to do PV kicking of suspended spinners -- on modern chips xadd
        isn't (much) more expensive than an add + load.

    kernel: make READ_ONCE() valid on const arguments
    
    commit dd36929720f40f17685e841ae0d4c581c165ea60 upstream.
    
    The use of READ_ONCE() causes lots of warnings witht he pending paravirt
    spinlock fixes, because those ends up having passing a member to a
    'const' structure to READ_ONCE().
    
    There should certainly be nothing wrong with using READ_ONCE() with a
    const source, but the helper function __read_once_size() would cause
    warnings because it would drop the 'const' qualifier, but also because
    the destination would be marked 'const' too due to the use of 'typeof'.
    
    Use a union of types in READ_ONCE() to avoid this issue.
    
    Also make sure to use parenthesis around the macro arguments to avoid
    possible operator precedence issues.

    x86, mm/ASLR: Fix stack randomization on 64-bit systems
    
    commit 4e7c22d447bb6d7e37bfe39ff658486ae78e8d77 upstream.
    
    The issue is that the stack for processes is not properly randomized on
    64 bit architectures due to an integer overflow.
    
    The affected function is randomize_stack_top() in file
    "fs/binfmt_elf.c":
    
      static unsigned long randomize_stack_top(unsigned long stack_top)
      {
               unsigned int random_variable = 0;
    
               if ((current->flags & PF_RANDOMIZE) &&
                       !(current->personality & ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE)) {
                       random_variable = get_random_int() & STACK_RND_MASK;
                       random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
               }
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) + random_variable;
               return PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top) - random_variable;
      }
    
    Note that, it declares the "random_variable" variable as "unsigned int".
    Since the result of the shifting operation between STACK_RND_MASK (which
    is 0x3fffff on x86_64, 22 bits) and PAGE_SHIFT (which is 12 on x86_64):
    
              random_variable <<= PAGE_SHIFT;
    
    then the two leftmost bits are dropped when storing the result in the
    "random_variable". This variable shall be at least 34 bits long to hold
    the (22+12) result.
    
    These two dropped bits have an impact on the entropy of process stack.
    Concretely, the total stack entropy is reduced by four: from 2^28 to
    2^30 (One fourth of expected entropy).
    
    This patch restores back the entropy by correcting the types involved
    in the operations in the functions randomize_stack_top() and
    stack_maxrandom_size().
    
    The successful fix can be tested with:
    
      $ for i in `seq 1 10`; do cat /proc/self/maps | grep stack; done
      7ffeda566000-7ffeda587000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7fff5a332000-7fff5a353000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffcdb7a1000-7ffcdb7c2000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      7ffd5e2c4000-7ffd5e2e5000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                          [stack]
      ...
    
    Once corrected, the leading bytes should be between 7ffc and 7fff,
    rather than always being 7fff.

    x86/efi: Avoid triple faults during EFI mixed mode calls
    
    commit 96738c69a7fcdbf0d7c9df0c8a27660011e82a7b upstream.
    
    Andy pointed out that if an NMI or MCE is received while we're in the
    middle of an EFI mixed mode call a triple fault will occur. This can
    happen, for example, when issuing an EFI mixed mode call while running
    perf.
    
    The reason for the triple fault is that we execute the mixed mode call
    in 32-bit mode with paging disabled but with 64-bit kernel IDT handlers
    installed throughout the call.
    
    At Andy's suggestion, stop playing the games we currently do at runtime,
    such as disabling paging and installing a 32-bit GDT for __KERNEL_CS. We
    can simply switch to the __KERNEL32_CS descriptor before invoking
    firmware services, and run in compatibility mode. This way, if an
    NMI/MCE does occur the kernel IDT handler will execute correctly, since
    it'll jump to __KERNEL_CS automatically.
    
    However, this change is only possible post-ExitBootServices(). Before
    then the firmware "owns" the machine and expects for its 32-bit IDT
    handlers to be left intact to service interrupts, etc.
    
    So, we now need to distinguish between early boot and runtime
    invocations of EFI services. During early boot, we need to restore the
    GDT that the firmware expects to be present. We can only jump to the
    __KERNEL32_CS code segment for mixed mode calls after ExitBootServices()
    has been invoked.
    
    A liberal sprinkling of comments in the thunking code should make the
    differences in early and late environments more apparent.

    blk-throttle: check stats_cpu before reading it from sysfs
    
    commit 045c47ca306acf30c740c285a77a4b4bda6be7c5 upstream.
    
    When reading blkio.throttle.io_serviced in a recently created blkio
    cgroup, it's possible to race against the creation of a throttle policy,
    which delays the allocation of stats_cpu.
    
    Like other functions in the throttle code, just checking for a NULL
    stats_cpu prevents the following oops caused by that race.

    Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after adding hard link to inode
    
    commit 1a4bcf470c886b955adf36486f4c86f2441d85cb upstream.
    
    We have a scenario where after the fsync log replay we can lose file data
    that had been previously fsync'ed if we added an hard link for our inode
    and after that we sync'ed the fsync log (for example by fsync'ing some
    other file or directory).
    
    This is because when adding an hard link we updated the inode item in the
    log tree with an i_size value of 0. At that point the new inode item was
    in memory only and a subsequent fsync log replay would not make us lose
    the file data. However if after adding the hard link we sync the log tree
    to disk, by fsync'ing some other file or directory for example, we ended
    up losing the file data after log replay, because the inode item in the
    persisted log tree had an an i_size of zero.
    
    This is easy to reproduce, and the following excerpt from my test for
    xfstests shows this:
    
      _scratch_mkfs >> $seqres.full 2>&1
      _init_flakey
      _mount_flakey
    
      # Create one file with data and fsync it.
      # This made the btrfs fsync log persist the data and the inode metadata with
      # a correct inode->i_size (4096 bytes).
      $XFS_IO_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa -b 4K 0 4K" -c "fsync" \
           $SCRATCH_MNT/foo | _filter_xfs_io
    
      # Now add one hard link to our file. This made the btrfs code update the fsync
      # log, in memory only, with an inode metadata having a size of 0.
      ln $SCRATCH_MNT/foo $SCRATCH_MNT/foo_link
    
      # Now force persistence of the fsync log to disk, for example, by fsyncing some
      # other file.
      touch $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
      $XFS_IO_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
    
      # Before a power loss or crash, we could read the 4Kb of data from our file as
      # expected.
      echo "File content before:"
      od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
    
      # Simulate a crash/power loss.
      _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_DROP_WRITES
      _unmount_flakey
    
      _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_ALLOW_WRITES
      _mount_flakey
    
      # After the fsync log replay, because the fsync log had a value of 0 for our
      # inode's i_size, we couldn't read anymore the 4Kb of data that we previously
      # wrote and fsync'ed. The size of the file became 0 after the fsync log replay.
      echo "File content after:"
      od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
    
    Another alternative test, that doesn't need to fsync an inode in the same
    transaction it was created, is:
    
      _scratch_mkfs >> $seqres.full 2>&1
      _init_flakey
      _mount_flakey
    
      # Create our test file with some data.
      $XFS_IO_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa -b 8K 0 8K" \
           $SCRATCH_MNT/foo | _filter_xfs_io
    
      # Make sure the file is durably persisted.
      sync
    
      # Append some data to our file, to increase its size.
      $XFS_IO_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xcc -b 4K 8K 4K" \
           $SCRATCH_MNT/foo | _filter_xfs_io
    
      # Fsync the file, so from this point on if a crash/power failure happens, our
      # new data is guaranteed to be there next time the fs is mounted.
      $XFS_IO_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
    
      # Add one hard link to our file. This made btrfs write into the in memory fsync
      # log a special inode with generation 0 and an i_size of 0 too. Note that this
      # didn't update the inode in the fsync log on disk.
      ln $SCRATCH_MNT/foo $SCRATCH_MNT/foo_link
    
      # Now make sure the in memory fsync log is durably persisted.
      # Creating and fsync'ing another file will do it.
      touch $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
      $XFS_IO_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
    
      # As expected, before the crash/power failure, we should be able to read the
      # 12Kb of file data.
      echo "File content before:"
      od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
    
      # Simulate a crash/power loss.
      _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_DROP_WRITES
      _unmount_flakey
    
      _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_ALLOW_WRITES
      _mount_flakey
    
      # After mounting the fs again, the fsync log was replayed.
      # The btrfs fsync log replay code didn't update the i_size of the persisted
      # inode because the inode item in the log had a special generation with a
      # value of 0 (and it couldn't know the correct i_size, since that inode item
      # had a 0 i_size too). This made the last 4Kb of file data inaccessible and
      # effectively lost.
      echo "File content after:"
      od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
    
    This isn't a new issue/regression. This problem has been around since the
    log tree code was added in 2008:
    
      Btrfs: Add a write ahead tree log to optimize synchronous operations
      (commit e02119d5a7b4396c5a872582fddc8bd6d305a70a)
    
    Test cases for xfstests follow soon.

    libceph: fix double __remove_osd() problem
    
    commit 7eb71e0351fbb1b242ae70abb7bb17107fe2f792 upstream.
    
    It turns out it's possible to get __remove_osd() called twice on the
    same OSD.  That doesn't sit well with rb_erase() - depending on the
    shape of the tree we can get a NULL dereference, a soft lockup or
    a random crash at some point in the future as we end up touching freed
    memory.  One scenario that I was able to reproduce is as follows:
    
                <osd3 is idle, on the osd lru list>
    <con reset - osd3>
    con_fault_finish()
      osd_reset()
                                  <osdmap - osd3 down>
                                  ceph_osdc_handle_map()
                                    <takes map_sem>
                                    kick_requests()
                                      <takes request_mutex>
                                      reset_changed_osds()
                                        __reset_osd()
                                          __remove_osd()
                                      <releases request_mutex>
                                    <releases map_sem>
        <takes map_sem>
        <takes request_mutex>
        __kick_osd_requests()
          __reset_osd()
            __remove_osd() <-- !!!
    
    A case can be made that osd refcounting is imperfect and reworking it
    would be a proper resolution, but for now Sage and I decided to fix
    this by adding a safe guard around __remove_osd().

    samsung-laptop: Add use_native_backlight quirk, and enable it on some models
    
    commit 4690555e13c48fef07f2762f6b0cd6b181e326d0 upstream.
    
    Since kernel 3.14 the backlight control has been broken on various Samsung
    Atom based netbooks. This has been bisected and this problem happens since
    commit b35684b8fa94 ("drm/i915: do full backlight setup at enable time")
    
    This has been reported and discussed in detail here:
    http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2014-July/049395.html
    
    Unfortunately no-one has been able to fix this. This only affects Samsung
    Atom netbooks, and the Linux kernel and the BIOS of those laptops have never
    worked well together. All affected laptops already have a quirk to avoid using
    the standard acpi-video interface and instead use the samsung specific SABI
    interface which samsung-laptop uses. It seems that recent fixes to the i915
    driver have also broken backlight control through the SABI interface.
    
    The intel_backlight driver OTOH works fine, and also allows for finer grained
    backlight control. So add a new use_native_backlight quirk, and replace the
    broken_acpi_video quirk with this quirk for affected models. This new quirk
    disables acpi-video as before and also stops samsung-laptop from registering
    the SABI based samsung_laptop backlight interface, leaving only the working
    intel_backlight interface.
    
    This commit enables this new quirk for 3 models which are known to be affected,
    chances are that it needs to be used on other models too.

    EDAC, amd64_edac: Prevent OOPS with >16 memory controllers
    
    commit 0c510cc83bdbaac8406f4f7caef34f4da0ba35ea upstream.
    
    When DRAM errors occur on memory controllers after EDAC_MAX_MCS (16),
    the kernel fatally dereferences unallocated structures, see splat below;
    this occurs on at least NumaConnect systems.
    
    Fix by checking if a memory controller info structure was found.

    sb_edac: Fix detection on SNB machines
    
    commit 11249e73992981e31fd50e7231da24fad68e3320 upstream.
    
    d0585cd815fa ("sb_edac: Claim a different PCI device") changed the
    probing of sb_edac to look for PCI device 0x3ca0:
    
    3f:0e.0 System peripheral: Intel Corporation Xeon E5/Core i7 Processor Home Agent (rev 07)
    00: 86 80 a0 3c 00 00 00 00 07 00 80 08 00 00 80 00
    ...
    
    but we're matching for 0x3ca8, i.e. PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_SBRIDGE_IMC_TA
    in sbridge_probe() therefore the probing fails.
    
    Changing it to probe for 0x3ca0 (PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_SBRIDGE_IMC_HA0),
    .i.e., the 14.0 device, fixes the issue and driver loads successfully
    again:
    
    [ 2449.013120] EDAC DEBUG: sbridge_init:
    [ 2449.017029] EDAC sbridge: Seeking for: PCI ID 8086:3ca0

    [ 2449.045155] EDAC sbridge: Seeking for: PCI ID 8086:3ca8
    ...
    
    Add a debug printk while at it to be able to catch the failure in the
    future and dump driver version on successful load.

    md/raid1: fix read balance when a drive is write-mostly.
    
    commit d1901ef099c38afd11add4cfb3312c02ef21ec4a upstream.
    
    When a drive is marked write-mostly it should only be the
    target of reads if there is no other option.
    
    This behaviour was broken by
    
    commit 9dedf60313fa4dddfd5b9b226a0ef12a512bf9dc
        md/raid1: read balance chooses idlest disk for SSD
    
    which causes a write-mostly device to be *preferred* is some cases.
    
    Restore correct behaviour by checking and setting
    best_dist_disk and best_pending_disk rather than best_disk.
    
    We only need to test one of these as they are both changed
    from -1 or >=0 at the same time.
    
    As we leave min_pending and best_dist unchanged, any non-write-mostly
    device will appear better than the write-mostly device.

    md/raid5: Fix livelock when array is both resyncing and degraded.
    
    commit 26ac107378c4742978216be1005b7291b799c7b2 upstream.
    
    Commit a7854487cd7128a30a7f4f5259de9f67d5efb95f:
      md: When RAID5 is dirty, force reconstruct-write instead of read-modify-write.
    
    Causes an RCW cycle to be forced even when the array is degraded.
    A degraded array cannot support RCW as that requires reading all data
    blocks, and one may be missing.
    
    Forcing an RCW when it is not possible causes a live-lock and the code
    spins, repeatedly deciding to do something that cannot succeed.
    
    So change the condition to only force RCW on non-degraded arrays.

    perf tools: Fix probing for PERF_FLAG_FD_CLOEXEC flag
    
    commit 48536c9195ae8c2a00fd8f400bac72ab613feaab upstream.
    
    Commit f6edb53c4993ffe92ce521fb449d1c146cea6ec2 converted the probe to
    a CPU wide event first (pid == -1). For kernels that do not support
    the PERF_FLAG_FD_CLOEXEC flag the probe fails with EINVAL. Since this
    errno is not handled pid is not reset to 0 and the subsequent use of
    pid = -1 as an argument brings in an additional failure path if
    perf_event_paranoid > 0:
    
    $ perf record -- sleep 1
    perf_event_open(..., 0) failed unexpectedly with error 13 (Permission denied)
    [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
    [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.007 MB /tmp/perf.data (11 samples) ]
    
    Also, ensure the fd of the confirmation check is closed and comment why
    pid = -1 is used.
    
    Needs to go to 3.18 stable tree as well.

    clocksource: mtk: Fix race conditions in probe code
    
    commit d4a19eb3b15a4ba98f627182f48d5bc0cffae670 upstream.
    
    We have two race conditions in the probe code which could lead to a null
    pointer dereference in the interrupt handler.
    
    The interrupt handler accesses the clockevent device, which may not yet be
    registered.
    
    First race condition happens when the interrupt handler gets registered before
    the interrupts get disabled. The second race condition happens when the
    interrupts get enabled, but the clockevent device is not yet registered.
    
    Fix that by disabling the interrupts before we register the interrupt and enable
    the interrupts after the clockevent device got registered.

    metag: Fix KSTK_EIP() and KSTK_ESP() macros
    
    commit c2996cb29bfb73927a79dc96e598a718e843f01a upstream.
    
    The KSTK_EIP() and KSTK_ESP() macros should return the user program
    counter (PC) and stack pointer (A0StP) of the given task. These are used
    to determine which VMA corresponds to the user stack in
    /proc/<pid>/maps, and for the user PC & A0StP in /proc/<pid>/stat.
    
    However for Meta the PC & A0StP from the task's kernel context are used,
    resulting in broken output. For example in following /proc/<pid>/maps
    output, the 3afff000-3b021000 VMA should be described as the stack:
    
      # cat /proc/self/maps
      ...
      100b0000-100b1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
      3afff000-3b021000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
    
    And in the following /proc/<pid>/stat output, the PC is in kernel code
    (1074234964 = 0x40078654) and the A0StP is in the kernel heap
    (1335981392 = 0x4fa17550):
    
      # cat /proc/self/stat
      51 (cat) R ... 1335981392 1074234964 ...
    
    Fix the definitions of KSTK_EIP() and KSTK_ESP() to use
    task_pt_regs(tsk)->ctx rather than (tsk)->thread.kernel_context. This
    gets the registers from the user context stored after the thread info at
    the base of the kernel stack, which is from the last entry into the
    kernel from userland, regardless of where in the kernel the task may
    have been interrupted, which results in the following more correct
    /proc/<pid>/maps output:
    
      # cat /proc/self/maps
      ...
      0800b000-08070000 r-xp 00000000 00:02 207        /lib/libuClibc-0.9.34-git.so
      ...
      100b0000-100b1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
      3afff000-3b021000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [stack]
    
    And /proc/<pid>/stat now correctly reports the PC in libuClibc
    (134320308 = 0x80190b4) and the A0StP in the [stack] region (989864576 =
    0x3b002280):
    
      # cat /proc/self/stat
      51 (cat) R ... 989864576 134320308 ...

    xfs: Fix quota type in quota structures when reusing quota file
    
    commit dfcc70a8c868fe03276fa59864149708fb41930b upstream.
    
    For filesystems without separate project quota inode field in the
    superblock we just reuse project quota file for group quotas (and vice
    versa) if project quota file is allocated and we need group quota file.
    When we reuse the file, quota structures on disk suddenly have wrong
    type stored in d_flags though. Nobody really cares about this (although
    structure type reported to userspace was wrong as well) except
    that after commit 14bf61ffe6ac (quota: Switch ->get_dqblk() and
    ->set_dqblk() to use bytes as space units) assertion in
    xfs_qm_scall_getquota() started to trigger on xfs/106 test (apparently I
    was testing without XFS_DEBUG so I didn't notice when submitting the
    above commit).
    
    Fix the problem by properly resetting ddq->d_flags when running quotacheck
    for a quota file.

    gpiolib: of: allow of_gpiochip_find_and_xlate to find more than one chip per node

    arm64: compat Fix siginfo_t -> compat_siginfo_t conversion on big endian
    
    commit 9d42d48a342aee208c1154696196497fdc556bbf upstream.
    
    The native (64-bit) sigval_t union contains sival_int (32-bit) and
    sival_ptr (64-bit). When a compat application invokes a syscall that
    takes a sigval_t value (as part of a larger structure, e.g.
    compat_sys_mq_notify, compat_sys_timer_create), the compat_sigval_t
    union is converted to the native sigval_t with sival_int overlapping
    with either the least or the most significant half of sival_ptr,
    depending on endianness. When the corresponding signal is delivered to a
    compat application, on big endian the current (compat_uptr_t)sival_ptr
    cast always returns 0 since sival_int corresponds to the top part of
    sival_ptr. This patch fixes copy_siginfo_to_user32() so that sival_int
    is copied to the compat_siginfo_t structure.

    KVM: s390: forward hrtimer if guest ckc not pending yet
    
    commit 2d00f759427bb3ed963b60f570830e9eca7e1c69 upstream.
    
    Patch 0759d0681cae ("KVM: s390: cleanup handle_wait by reusing
    kvm_vcpu_block") changed the way pending guest clock comparator
    interrupts are detected. It was assumed that as soon as the hrtimer
    wakes up, the condition for the guest ckc is satisfied.
    
    This is however only true as long as adjclock() doesn't speed
    up the monotonic clock. Reason is that the hrtimer is based on
    CLOCK_MONOTONIC, the guest clock comparator detection is based
    on the raw TOD clock. If CLOCK_MONOTONIC runs faster than the
    TOD clock, the hrtimer wakes the target VCPU up too early and
    the target VCPU will not detect any pending interrupts, therefore
    going back to sleep. It will never be woken up again because the
    hrtimer has finished. The VCPU is stuck.
    
    As a quick fix, we have to forward the hrtimer until the guest
    clock comparator is really due, to guarantee properly timed wake
    ups.
    
    As the hrtimer callback might be triggered on another cpu, we
    have to make sure that the timer is really stopped and not currently
    executing the callback on another cpu. This can happen if the vcpu
    thread is scheduled onto another physical cpu, but the timer base
    is not migrated. So lets use hrtimer_cancel instead of try_to_cancel.
    
    A proper fix might be to introduce a RAW based hrtimer.

    MIPS: HTW: Prevent accidental HTW start due to nested htw_{start, stop}
    
    commit ed4cbc81addbc076b016c5b979fd1a02f0897f0a upstream.
    
    activate_mm() and switch_mm() call get_new_mmu_context() which in turn
    can enable the HTW before the entryhi is changed with the new ASID.
    Since the latter will enable the HTW in local_flush_tlb_all(),
    then there is a small timing window where the HTW is running with the
    new ASID but with an old pgd since the TLBMISS_HANDLER_SETUP_PGD
    hasn't assigned a new one yet. In order to prevent that, we introduce a
    simple htw counter to avoid starting HTW accidentally due to nested
    htw_{start,stop}() sequences. Moreover, since various IPI calls can
    enforce TLB flushing operations on a different core, such an operation
    may interrupt another htw_{stop,start} in progress leading inconsistent
    updates of the htw_seq variable. In order to avoid that, we disable the
    interrupts whenever we update that variable.

    ARC: fix page address calculation if PAGE_OFFSET != LINUX_LINK_BASE
    
    commit 06f34e1c28f3608b0ce5b310e41102d3fe7b65a1 upstream.
    
    We used to calculate page address differently in 2 cases:
    
    1. In virt_to_page(x) we do
     --->8---
     mem_map + (x - CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE) >> PAGE_SHIFT
     --->8---
    
    2. In in pte_page(x) we do
     --->8---
     mem_map + (pte_val(x) - PAGE_OFFSET) >> PAGE_SHIFT
     --->8---
    
    That leads to problems in case PAGE_OFFSET != CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE -
    different pages will be selected depending on where and how we calculate
    page address.
    
    In particular in the STAR 9000853582 when gdb attempted to read memory
    of another process it got improper page in get_user_pages() because this
    is exactly one of the places where we search for a page by pte_page().
    
    The fix is trivial - we need to calculate page address similarly in both
    cases.

    serial: fsl_lpuart: avoid new transfer while DMA is running
    
    commit 5f1437f61a0b351d25b528c159360da3d5e8c77b upstream.
    
    When the UART is in DMA receive mode (RDMAS set) and one character
    just arrived while another interrupt is handled (e.g. TX), the RDRF
    (receiver data register full flag) is set due to the water level of
    1. But since the DMA will take care of this character, there is no
    need to handle it by calling lpuart_prepare_rx. Handling it leads to
    adding the RX timeout timer twice:

    ntp: Fixup adjtimex freq validation on 32-bit systems
    
    commit 29183a70b0b828500816bd794b3fe192fce89f73 upstream.
    
    Additional validation of adjtimex freq values to avoid
    potential multiplication overflows were added in commit
    5e5aeb4367b (time: adjtimex: Validate the ADJ_FREQUENCY values)
    
    Unfortunately the patch used LONG_MAX/MIN instead of
    LLONG_MAX/MIN, which was fine on 64-bit systems, but being
    much smaller on 32-bit systems caused false positives
    resulting in most direct frequency adjustments to fail w/
    EINVAL.
    
    ntpd only does direct frequency adjustments at startup, so
    the issue was not as easily observed there, but other time
    sync applications like ptpd and chrony were more effected by
    the bug.
    
    See bugs:
    
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92481
      https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1188074
    
    This patch changes the checks to use LLONG_MAX for
    clarity, and additionally the checks are disabled
    on 32-bit systems since LLONG_MAX/PPM_SCALE is always
    larger then the 32-bit long freq value, so multiplication
    overflows aren't possible there.

    kdb: Fix off by one error in kdb_cpu()
    
    commit df0036d117e6c9df36324e517728e33543065f9a upstream.
    
    There was a follow on replacement patch against the prior
    "kgdb: Timeout if secondary CPUs ignore the roundup".
    
    See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/7/442
    
    This patch is the delta vs the patch that was committed upstream:
      * Fix an off-by-one error in kdb_cpu().
      * Replace NR_CPUS with CONFIG_NR_CPUS to tell checkpatch that we
        really want a static limit.
      * Removed the "KGDB: " prefix from the pr_crit() in debug_core.c
        (kgdb-next contains a patch which introduced pr_fmt() to this file
        to the tag will now be applied automatically).

    kdb: Avoid printing KERN_ levels to consoles
    
    commit f7d4ca8bbfda23b4f1eae9b6757ff64166b093d5 upstream.
    
    Currently when kdb traps printk messages then the raw log level prefix
    (consisting of '\001' followed by a numeral) does not get stripped off
    before the message is issued to the various I/O handlers supported by
    kdb. This causes annoying visual noise as well as causing problems
    grepping for ^. It is also a change of behaviour compared to normal usage
    of printk() usage. For example <SysRq>-h ends up with different output to
    that of kdb's "sr h".
    
    This patch addresses the problem by stripping log levels from messages
    before they are issued to the I/O handlers. printk() which can also
    act as an i/o handler in some cases is special cased; if the caller
    provided a log level then the prefix will be preserved when sent to
    printk().
    
    The addition of non-printable characters to the output of kdb commands is a
    regression, albeit and extremely elderly one, introduced by commit
    04d2c8c83d0e ("printk: convert the format for KERN_<LEVEL> to a 2 byte
    pattern"). Note also that this patch does *not* restore the original
    behaviour from v3.5. Instead it makes printk() from within a kdb command
    display the message without any prefix (i.e. like printk() normally does).

    ARM: mvebu: build armada375-smp code conditionally
    
    commit 165235180ff61f0012ea68a299e46daec43dcaa7 upstream.
    
    mvebu_armada375_smp_wa_init is only used on armada 375 but is defined
    for all mvebu machines. As it calls a function that is only provided
    sometimes, this can result in a link error:

    function to also check for Armada375 SMP platforms.

    USB: add flag for HCDs that can't receive wakeup requests (isp1760-hcd)
    
    commit 074f9dd55f9cab1b82690ed7e44bcf38b9616ce0 upstream.
    
    Currently the USB stack assumes that all host controller drivers are
    capable of receiving wakeup requests from downstream devices.
    However, this isn't true for the isp1760-hcd driver, which means that
    it isn't safe to do a runtime suspend of any device attached to a
    root-hub port if the device requires wakeup.
    
    This patch adds a "cant_recv_wakeups" flag to the usb_hcd structure
    and sets the flag in isp1760-hcd.  The core is modified to prevent a
    direct child of the root hub from being put into runtime suspend with
    wakeup enabled if the flag is set.

    USB: don't cancel queued resets when unbinding drivers
    
    commit 524134d422316a59d5464ccbc12036bbe90c5563 upstream.
    
    The USB stack provides a mechanism for drivers to request an
    asynchronous device reset (usb_queue_reset_device()).  The mechanism
    uses a work item (reset_ws) embedded in the usb_interface structure
    used by the driver, and the reset is carried out by a work queue
    routine.
    
    The asynchronous reset can race with driver unbinding.  When this
    happens, we try to cancel the queued reset before unbinding the
    driver, on the theory that the driver won't care about any resets once
    it is unbound.
    
    However, thanks to the fact that lockdep now tracks work queue
    accesses, this can provoke a lockdep warning in situations where the
    device reset causes another interface's driver to be unbound; see
    
            http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=141893165203776&w=2
    
    for an example.  The reason is that the work routine for reset_ws in
    one interface calls cancel_queued_work() for the reset_ws in another
    interface.  Lockdep thinks this might lead to a work routine trying to
    cancel itself.  The simplest solution is not to cancel queued resets
    when unbinding drivers.
    
    This means we now need to acquire a reference to the usb_interface
    when queuing a reset_ws work item and to drop the reference when the
    work routine finishes.  We also need to make sure that the
    usb_interface structure doesn't outlive its parent usb_device; this
    means acquiring and dropping a reference when the interface is created
    and destroyed.
    
    In addition, cancelling a queued reset can fail (if the device is in
    the middle of an earlier reset), and this can cause usb_reset_device()
    to try to rebind an interface that has been deallocated (see
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=142175717016628&w=2 for details).
    Acquiring the extra references prevents this failure.

    usb: core: buffer: smallest buffer should start at ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN
    
    commit 5efd2ea8c9f4f12916ffc8ba636792ce052f6911 upstream.
    
    the following error pops up during "testusb -a -t 10"
    | musb-hdrc musb-hdrc.1.auto: dma_pool_free buffer-128, f134e000/be842000 (bad dma)
    hcd_buffer_create() creates a few buffers, the smallest has 32 bytes of
    size. ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is set to 64 bytes. This combo results in
    hcd_buffer_alloc() returning memory which is 32 bytes aligned and it
    might by identified by buffer_offset() as another buffer. This means the
    buffer which is on a 32 byte boundary will not get freed, instead it
    tries to free another buffer with the error message.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by creating the smallest DMA buffer with the
    size of ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN (or 32 in case ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is
    smaller). This might be 32, 64 or even 128 bytes. The next three pools
    will have the size 128, 512 and 2048.
    In case the smallest pool is 128 bytes then we have only three pools
    instead of four (and zero the first entry in the array).
    The last pool size is always 2048 bytes which is the assumed PAGE_SIZE /
    2 of 4096. I doubt it makes sense to continue using PAGE_SIZE / 2 where
    we would end up with 8KiB buffer in case we have 16KiB pages.
    Instead I think it makes sense to have a common size(s) and extend them
    if there is need to.
    There is a BUILD_BUG_ON() now in case someone has a minalign of more than
    128 bytes.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: add missing spin_lock()
    
    commit 5c7b3b02de766a8634708953e805399e3544a290 upstream.
    
    commit 8e74475b0e0a (usb: dwc3: gadget: use udc-core's
    reset notifier) added support for the new UDC core's
    reset notifier to dwc3 but while at it, it removed
    a spin_lock() from dwc3_reset_gadget() which might
    cause an unbalanced spin_unlock() further down the line

    USB: fix use-after-free bug in usb_hcd_unlink_urb()
    
    commit c99197902da284b4b723451c1471c45b18537cde upstream.
    
    The usb_hcd_unlink_urb() routine in hcd.c contains two possible
    use-after-free errors.  The dev_dbg() statement at the end of the
    routine dereferences urb and urb->dev even though both structures may
    have been deallocated.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by storing urb->dev in a local variable
    (avoiding the dereference of urb) and moving the dev_dbg() up before
    the usb_put_dev() call.

    We might enter the interrupt handler with hw_ready already set,

    To soleve this we move the reset release from the interrupt handler

    tty/serial: at91: fix error handling in atmel_serial_probe()
    
    commit 6fbb9bdf0f3fbe23aeff806489791aa876adaffb upstream.
    
    -EDEFER error wasn't handle properly by atmel_serial_probe().
    As an example, when atmel_serial_probe() is called for the first time, we pass
    the test_and_set_bit() test to check whether the port has already been
    initalized. Then we call atmel_init_port(), which may return -EDEFER, possibly
    returned before by clk_get(). Consequently atmel_serial_probe() used to return
    this error code WITHOUT clearing the port bit in the "atmel_ports_in_use" mask.
    When atmel_serial_probe() was called for the second time, it used to fail on
    the test_and_set_bit() function then returning -EBUSY.
    
    When atmel_serial_probe() fails, this patch make it clear the port bit in the
    "atmel_ports_in_use" mask, if needed, before returning the error code.

    tty/serial: at91: enable peripheral clock before accessing I/O registers
    
    commit d4f641876a68d1961e30c202709cc2d484f69f6f upstream.
    
    atmel_serial_probe() calls atmel_init_port(). In turn, atmel_init_port() calls
    clk_disable_unprepare() to disable the peripheral clock before returning.
    
    Later atmel_serial_probe() accesses some I/O registers such as the Mode and
    Control registers for RS485 support then the Name and Version registers, through a call to
    atmel_get_ip_name(), but at that moment the peripheral clock was still
    disabled.

    Commit 26df6d13406d1a5 ("tty: Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE")
    allows a process which has opened a pty master to send _any_ signal
    to the process group of the pty slave. Although potentially
    exploitable by a malicious program running a setuid program on
    a pty slave, it's unknown if this exploit currently exists.
    
    Limit to signals actually used.

    smack: fix possible use after frees in task_security() callers
    
    commit 6d1cff2a885850b78b40c34777b46cf5da5d1050 upstream.
    
    We hit use after free on dereferncing pointer to task_smack struct in
    smk_of_task() called from smack_task_to_inode().
    
    task_security() macro uses task_cred_xxx() to get pointer to the task_smack.
    task_cred_xxx() could be used only for non-pointer members of task's
    credentials. It cannot be used for pointer members since what they point
    to may disapper after dropping RCU read lock.
    
    Mainly task_security() used this way:
            smk_of_task(task_security(p))
    
    Intead of this introduce function smk_of_task_struct() which
    takes task_struct as argument and returns pointer to smk_known struct
    and do this under RCU read lock.
    Bogus task_security() macro is not used anymore, so remove it.
    
    KASan's report for this:

    ring-buffer: Do not wake up a splice waiter when page is not full
    
    commit 1e0d6714aceb770b04161fbedd7765d0e1fc27bd upstream.
    
    When an application connects to the ring buffer via splice, it can only
    read full pages. Splice does not work with partial pages. If there is
    not enough data to fill a page, the splice command will either block
    or return -EAGAIN (if set to nonblock).
    
    Code was added where if the page is not full, to just sleep again.
    The problem is, it will get woken up again on the next event. That
    is, when something is written into the ring buffer, if there is a waiter
    it will wake it up. The waiter would then check the buffer, see that
    it still does not have enough data to fill a page and go back to sleep.
    To make matters worse, when the waiter goes back to sleep, it could
    cause another event, which would wake it back up again to see it
    doesn't have enough data and sleep again. This produces a tremendous
    overhead and fills the ring buffer with noise.
    
    For example, recording sched_switch on an idle system for 10 seconds
    produces 25,350,475 events!!!
    
    Create another wait queue for those waiters wanting full pages.
    When an event is written, it only wakes up waiters if there's a full
    page of data. It does not wake up the waiter if the page is not yet
    full.
    
    After this change, recording sched_switch on an idle system for 10
    seconds produces only 800 events. Getting rid of 25,349,675 useless
    events (99.9969% of events!!), is something to take seriously.

    cipso: don't use IPCB() to locate the CIPSO IP option
    
    commit 04f81f0154e4bf002be6f4d85668ce1257efa4d9 upstream.
    
    Using the IPCB() macro to get the IPv4 options is convenient, but
    unfortunately NetLabel often needs to examine the CIPSO option outside
    of the scope of the IP layer in the stack.  While historically IPCB()
    worked above the IP layer, due to the inclusion of the inet_skb_param
    struct at the head of the {tcp,udp}_skb_cb structs, recent commit
    971f10ec ("tcp: better TCP_SKB_CB layout to reduce cache line misses")
    reordered the tcp_skb_cb struct and invalidated this IPCB() trick.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by creating a new function,
    cipso_v4_optptr(), which locates the CIPSO option inside the IP header
    without calling IPCB().  Unfortunately, this isn't as fast as a simple
    lookup so some additional tweaks were made to limit the use of this
    new function.

    cfq-iosched: fix incorrect filing of rt async cfqq
    
    commit c6ce194325cef342313e3d27620411ce90a89c50 upstream.
    
    Hi,
    
    If you can manage to submit an async write as the first async I/O from
    the context of a process with realtime scheduling priority, then a
    cfq_queue is allocated, but filed into the wrong async_cfqq bucket.  It
    ends up in the best effort array, but actually has realtime I/O
    scheduling priority set in cfqq->ioprio.
    
    The reason is that cfq_get_queue assumes the default scheduling class and
    priority when there is no information present (i.e. when the async cfqq
    is created):
    
    static struct cfq_queue *
    cfq_get_queue(struct cfq_data *cfqd, bool is_sync, struct cfq_io_cq *cic,
                  struct bio *bio, gfp_t gfp_mask)
    {
            const int ioprio_class = IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
            const int ioprio = IOPRIO_PRIO_DATA(cic->ioprio);
    
    cic->ioprio starts out as 0, which is "invalid".  So, class of 0
    (IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE) is passed to cfq_async_queue_prio like so:
    
                    async_cfqq = cfq_async_queue_prio(cfqd, ioprio_class, ioprio);
    
    static struct cfq_queue **
    cfq_async_queue_prio(struct cfq_data *cfqd, int ioprio_class, int ioprio)
    {
            switch (ioprio_class) {
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_RT:
                    return &cfqd->async_cfqq[0][ioprio];
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
                    ioprio = IOPRIO_NORM;
                    /* fall through */
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_BE:
                    return &cfqd->async_cfqq[1][ioprio];
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE:
                    return &cfqd->async_idle_cfqq;
            default:
                    BUG();
            }
    }
    
    Here, instead of returning a class mapped from the process' scheduling
    priority, we get back the bucket associated with IOPRIO_CLASS_BE.
    
    Now, there is no queue allocated there yet, so we create it:
    
                    cfqq = cfq_find_alloc_queue(cfqd, is_sync, cic, bio, gfp_mask);
    
    That function ends up doing this:
    
                            cfq_init_cfqq(cfqd, cfqq, current->pid, is_sync);
                            cfq_init_prio_data(cfqq, cic);
    
    cfq_init_cfqq marks the priority as having changed.  Then, cfq_init_prio
    data does this:
    
            ioprio_class = IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(cic->ioprio);
            switch (ioprio_class) {
            default:
                    printk(KERN_ERR "cfq: bad prio %x\n", ioprio_class);
            case IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE:
                    /*
                     * no prio set, inherit CPU scheduling settings
                     */
                    cfqq->ioprio = task_nice_ioprio(tsk);
                    cfqq->ioprio_class = task_nice_ioclass(tsk);
                    break;
    
    So we basically have two code paths that treat IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE
    differently, which results in an RT async cfqq filed into a best effort
    bucket.
    
    Attached is a patch which fixes the problem.  I'm not sure how to make
    it cleaner.  Suggestions would be welcome.

    cfq-iosched: handle failure of cfq group allocation
    
    commit 69abaffec7d47a083739b79e3066cb3730eba72e upstream.
    
    Cfq_lookup_create_cfqg() allocates struct blkcg_gq using GFP_ATOMIC.
    In cfq_find_alloc_queue() possible allocation failure is not handled.
    As a result kernel oopses on NULL pointer dereference when
    cfq_link_cfqq_cfqg() calls cfqg_get() for NULL pointer.
    
    Bug was introduced in v3.5 in commit cd1604fab4f9 ("blkcg: factor
    out blkio_group creation"). Prior to that commit cfq group lookup
    had returned pointer to root group as fallback.
    
    This patch handles this error using existing fallback oom_cfqq.

    iscsi-target: Drop problematic active_ts_list usage
    
    commit 3fd7b60f2c7418239d586e359e0c6d8503e10646 upstream.
    
    This patch drops legacy active_ts_list usage within iscsi_target_tq.c
    code.  It was originally used to track the active thread sets during
    iscsi-target shutdown, and is no longer used by modern upstream code.
    
    Two people have reported list corruption using traditional iscsi-target
    and iser-target with the following backtrace, that appears to be related
    to iscsi_thread_set->ts_list being used across both active_ts_list and
    inactive_ts_list.

    sg: fix EWOULDBLOCK errors with scsi-mq
    
    commit 7772855a996ec6e16944b120ab5ce21050279821 upstream.
    
    With scsi-mq enabled, userspace programs can get unexpected EWOULDBLOCK
    (a.k.a. EAGAIN) errors when submitting commands to the SCSI generic
    driver.  Fix by calling blk_get_request() with GFP_KERNEL instead of
    GFP_ATOMIC.
    
    Note: to avoid introducing a potential deadlock, this patch should be
    applied after the patch titled "sg: fix unkillable I/O wait deadlock

    sg: fix unkillable I/O wait deadlock with scsi-mq
    
    commit 7568615c1054907ea8c7701ab86dad51aa099888 upstream.
    
    When using the write()/read() interface for submitting commands, the
    SCSI generic driver does not call blk_put_request() on a completed SCSI
    command until userspace calls read() to get the command completion.
    Since scsi-mq uses a fixed number of preallocated requests, this makes
    it possible for userspace to exhaust the entire preallocated supply of
    requests.  For places in the kernel that call blk_get_request() with
    GFP_KERNEL, this can cause the calling process to deadlock in a
    permanent unkillable I/O wait in blk_get_request() -> ... -> bt_get().
    For places in the kernel that call blk_get_request() with GFP_ATOMIC,
    this can cause blk_get_request() always to return -EWOULDBLOCK.  Note
    that these problems happen only if scsi-mq is enabled.  Prevent the
    problems by calling blk_put_request() as soon as the SCSI command
    completes instead of waiting for userspace to call read().

    commit cb5d04bc39e914124e811ea55f3034d2379a5f6c upstream.
    
    With pgio refactoring in v3.15, .init_read and .init_write can be
    called with valid pgio->pg_lseg. file layout was fixed at that time
    by commit c6194271f (pnfs: filelayout: support non page aligned
    layouts). But the generic helper still needs to be fixed.

    Added Little Endian support to vtpm module
    
    commit eb71f8a5e33fa1066fb92f0111ab366a341e1f6c upstream.
    
    The tpm_ibmvtpm module is affected by an unaligned access problem.
    ibmvtpm_crq_get_version failed with rc=-4 during boot when vTPM is
    enabled in Power partition, which supports both little endian and
    big endian modes.
    
    We added little endian support to fix this problem:
    1) added cpu_to_be64 calls to ensure BE data is sent from an LE OS.
    2) added be16_to_cpu and be32_to_cpu calls to make sure data received
       is in LE format on a LE OS.

    tpm/tpm_i2c_stm_st33: Fix potential bug in tpm_stm_i2c_send
    
    commit 1ba3b0b6f218072afe8372d12f1b6bf26a26008e upstream.
    
    When sending data in tpm_stm_i2c_send, each loop iteration send buf.
    Send buf + i instead as the goal of this for loop is to send a number
    of byte from buf that fit in burstcnt. Once those byte are sent, we are
    supposed to send the next ones.
    
    The driver was working because the burstcount value returns always the maximum size for a TPM
    command or response. (0x800 for a command and 0x400 for a response).

    tpm: Fix NULL return in tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma
    
    commit 84eb186bc37c0900b53077ca21cf6dd15823a232 upstream.
    
    There was an oops in tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma, which caused
    kernel panic during boot when vTPM is enabled in Power partition
    configured in AMS mode.
    
    vio_bus_probe calls vio_cmo_bus_probe which calls
    tpm_ibmvtpm_get_desired_dma to get the size needed for DMA allocation.
    The problem is, vio_cmo_bus_probe is called before calling probe, which
    for vtpm is tpm_ibmvtpm_probe and it's this function that initializes
    and sets up vtpm's CRQ and gets required data values.  Therefore,
    since this has not yet been done, NULL is returned in attempt to get
    the size for DMA allocation.
    
    We added a NULL check.  In addition, a default buffer size will
    be set when NULL is returned.

    tpm_tis: verify interrupt during init
    
    commit 448e9c55c12d6bd4fa90a7e31d802e045666d7c8 upstream.
    
    Some machines, such as the Acer C720 and Toshiba CB35, have TPMs that do
    not send IRQs while also having an ACPI TPM entry indicating that they
    will be sent. These machines freeze on resume while the tpm_tis module
    waits for an IRQ, eventually timing out.
    
    When in interrupt mode, the tpm_tis module should receive an IRQ during
    module init. Fall back to polling mode if none is received when expected.

    mm/hugetlb: pmd_huge() returns true for non-present hugepage
    
    commit cbef8478bee55775ac312a574aad48af7bb9cf9f upstream.
    
    Migrating hugepages and hwpoisoned hugepages are considered as non-present
    hugepages, and they are referenced via migration entries and hwpoison
    entries in their page table slots.
    
    This behavior causes race condition because pmd_huge() doesn't tell
    non-huge pages from migrating/hwpoisoned hugepages.  follow_page_mask() is
    one example where the kernel would call follow_page_pte() for such
    hugepage while this function is supposed to handle only normal pages.
    
    To avoid this, this patch makes pmd_huge() return true when pmd_none() is
    true *and* pmd_present() is false.  We don't have to worry about mixing up
    non-present pmd entry with normal pmd (pointing to leaf level pte entry)
    because pmd_present() is true in normal pmd.
    
    The same race condition could happen in (x86-specific) gup_pmd_range(),
    where this patch simply adds pmd_present() check instead of pmd_huge().
    This is because gup_pmd_range() is fast path.  If we have non-present
    hugepage in this function, we will go into gup_huge_pmd(), then return 0
    at flag mask check, and finally fall back to the slow path.

    commit fde3538a8a711aedf1173ecb2d45aed868f51c97 upstream.
    
    Whenever we modify a page table entry, we need to ensure that the HTW
    will not fetch a stable entry. And for that to happen we need to ensure
    that HTW is stopped before we modify the said entry otherwise the HTW
    may already be in the process of reading that entry and fetching the
    old information. As a result of which, we replace the htw_reset() calls
    with htw_{stop,start} in more appropriate places. This also removes the
    remaining users of htw_reset() and as a result we drop that macro

    commit 461d1597ffad7a826f8aaa63ab0727c37b632e34 upstream.
    
    When we use htw_{start,stop}() outside of htw_reset(), we need
    to ensure that c0 changes have been propagated properly before
    we attempt to continue with subsequence memory operations.

    MIPS: asm: asmmacro: Replace "add" instructions with "addu"
    
    commit 98a833c1fa4de0695830f77b2d13fd86693da298 upstream.
    
    The "add" instruction is actually a macro in binutils and depending on
    the size of the immediate it can expand to an "addi" instruction.
    However, the "addi" instruction traps on overflows which is not
    something we want on address calculation.

    MIPS: Alchemy: Fix cpu clock calculation
    
    commit 69e4e63ec816a7e22cc3aa14bc7ef4ac734d370c upstream.
    
    The current code uses bits 0-6 of the sys_cpupll register to calculate
    core clock speed.  However this is only valid on Au1300, on all earlier
    models the hardware only uses bits 0-5 to generate core clock.
    
    This fixes clock calculation on the MTX1 (Au1500), where bit 6 of cpupll
    is set as well, which ultimately lead the code to calculate a bogus cpu
    core clock and also uart base clock down the line.

    KVM: MIPS: Don't leak FPU/DSP to guest
    
    commit f798217dfd038af981a18bbe4bc57027a08bb182 upstream.
    
    The FPU and DSP are enabled via the CP0 Status CU1 and MX bits by
    kvm_mips_set_c0_status() on a guest exit, presumably in case there is
    active state that needs saving if pre-emption occurs. However neither of
    these bits are cleared again when returning to the guest.
    
    This effectively gives the guest access to the FPU/DSP hardware after
    the first guest exit even though it is not aware of its presence,
    allowing FP instructions in guest user code to intermittently actually
    execute instead of trapping into the guest OS for emulation. It will
    then read & manipulate the hardware FP registers which technically
    belong to the user process (e.g. QEMU), or are stale from another user
    process. It can also crash the guest OS by causing an FP exception, for
    which a guest exception handler won't have been registered.
    
    First lets save and disable the FPU (and MSA) state with lose_fpu(1)
    before entering the guest. This simplifies the problem, especially for
    when guest FPU/MSA support is added in the future, and prevents FR=1 FPU
    state being live when the FR bit gets cleared for the guest, which
    according to the architecture causes the contents of the FPU and vector
    registers to become UNPREDICTABLE.
    
    We can then safely remove the enabling of the FPU in
    kvm_mips_set_c0_status(), since there should never be any active FPU or
    MSA state to save at pre-emption, which should plug the FPU leak.
    
    DSP state is always live rather than being lazily restored, so for that
    it is simpler to just clear the MX bit again when re-entering the guest.

    KVM: MIPS: Disable HTW while in guest
    
    commit c4c6f2cad9e1d4cc076bc183c3689cc9e7019c75 upstream.
    
    Ensure any hardware page table walker (HTW) is disabled while in KVM
    guest mode, as KVM doesn't yet set up hardware page table walking for
    guest mappings so the wrong mappings would get loaded, resulting in the
    guest hanging or crashing once it reaches userland.
    
    The HTW is disabled and re-enabled around the call to
    __kvm_mips_vcpu_run() which does the initial switch into guest mode and
    the final switch out of guest context. Additionally it is enabled for
    the duration of guest exits (i.e. kvm_mips_handle_exit()), getting
    disabled again before returning back to guest or host.
    
    In all cases the HTW is only disabled in normal kernel mode while
    interrupts are disabled, so that the HTW doesn't get left disabled if
    the process is preempted.

    nfs41_callback_svc does most of its work while in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE,

    Also, we don't expect this kthread to accept signals, so we should be
    using a TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep instead. That however, opens us up
    hung task warnings from the watchdog, so have the schedule_timeout
    wake up every 60s if there's no callback activity.

            migration_entry_to_page()
                BUG_ON(!PageLocked(page))
    
    Also lockless read might be non-atomic if pte is larger than wordsize.
    Other pte walkers (smaps, numa_maps, clear_refs) already lock ptes.

    According to erratum 'ERR-7878951' Armada 38x SDHCI controller has
    different capabilities than the ones shown in its registers:
    
    - it doesn't support the voltage switching: it can work either with
      3.3V or 1.8V supply
    - it doesn't support the SDR104 mode
    - SDR50 mode doesn't need tuning
    
    The SDHCI_QUIRK_MISSING_CAPS quirk is used for updating the
    capabilities accordingly.

    commit 14460dbaf7a5a0488963fdb8232ad5c8a8cca7b7 upstream.
    
    Current code checks "clk_delay_cycles > 0" to know whether the optional
    "mrvl,clk_delay_cycles" is set or not. But of_property_read_u32() doesn't
    touch clk_delay_cycles if the property is not set. And type of
    clk_delay_cycles is u32, so we may always set pdata->clk_delay_cycles as a
    random value.
    
    This patch fix this problem by check the return value of of_property_read_u32()
    to know whether the optional clk-delay-cycles is set or not.

    mmc: sdhci-pxav3: fix race between runtime pm and irq
    
    commit 3bb10f60933e84abfe2be69f60b3486f9b96348b upstream.
    
    This patch is to fix a race condition that may cause an unhandled irq,
    which results in big sdhci interrupt numbers and endless "mmc1: got irq
    while runtime suspended" msgs before v3.15.
    
    Consider following scenario:
    
          CPU0                            CPU1
                                  sdhci_pxav3_runtime_suspend()
                                   spin_lock_irqsave(&host->lock, flags);
     sdhci_irq()
      spining on the &host->lock
                                   host->runtime_suspended = true;
                                   spin_unlock_irqrestore(&host->lock, flags);
      get the &host->lock
      runtime_suspended is true now
      return IRQ_NONE;
    
    Fix this race by using the core sdhci.c supplied sdhci_runtime_suspend_host()

    mmc: sdhci-pxav3: fix unbalanced clock issues during probe
    
    commit 62cf983ad84275f8580c807e5e596216c46773cf upstream.
    
    Commit 0dcaa2499b7d ("sdhci-pxav3: Fix runtime PM initialization") tries
    to fix one hang issue caused by calling sdhci_add_host() on a suspended
    device. The fix enables the clock twice, once by clk_prepare_enable() and
    another by pm_runtime_get_sync(), meaning that the clock will never be
    gated at runtime PM suspend. I observed the power consumption regression on
    Marvell BG2Q SoCs.
    
    In fact, the fix is not correct. There still be a very small window
    during which a runtime suspend might somehow occur after pm_runtime_enable()
    but before pm_runtime_get_sync().
    
    This patch fixes all of the two problems by just incrementing the usage
    counter before pm_runtime_enable(). It also adjust the order of disabling
    runtime pm and storing the usage count in the error path to handle clock
    gating properly.

    timberdale: do not select TIMB_DMA
    
    commit 244829226f47ffb4d6009a2ccd2771cd149d8114 upstream.
    
    The timberdale media driver requires the use of the respective
    dma engine driver, but that may not be enabled, causing a
    Kconfig warning:
    
    warning: (VIDEO_TIMBERDALE) selects TIMB_DMA which has unmet direct dependencies (DMADEVICES && MFD_TIMBERDALE)
    
    This fixes the dependency by removing the inappropriate 'select'
    statement and replacing it with a direct dependency on the
    drivers that provide the services this needs.

    rc-main: Re-apply filter for no-op protocol change
    
    commit 983c5bd26b86ba1c0d79b770e596bb8b77e42f32 upstream.
    
    Since commit da6e162d6a46 ("[media] rc-core: simplify sysfs code"), when
    the IR protocol is set using the sysfs interface to the same set of
    protocols that are already set, store_protocols() does not refresh the
    scancode filter with the new protocol, even if it has already called the
    change_protocol() callback successfully. This results in the filter
    being disabled in the hardware and not re-enabled until the filter is
    set again using sysfs.
    
    Fix in store_protocols() by still re-applying the filter whenever the
    change_protocol() driver callback succeeded.
    
    The problem can be reproduced with the img-ir driver by setting a
    filter, and then setting the protocol to the same protocol that is
    already set:
    $ echo nec > protocols
    $ echo 0xffff > filter_mask
    $ echo nec > protocols
    
    After this, messages which don't match the filter were still being
    received.

    megaraid_sas: fix the problem of non-existing VD exposed to host
    
    commit ab2f0608e16d64a23a2dcc8d83b966a0e0a281f3 upstream.
    
    This patch will address the issue of SCSI device created at OS level for
    non existing VD. ldTgtIdtoLd[] array has size 256 for Extended VD firmware
    and 128 for legacy firmware. Accessing indices beyond array size (OS will
    send TUR, INQUIRY.. commands upto device index 255), may return valid LD
    value and that particular SCSI command will be SUCCESS and creating SCSI
    device for non existing target(VD).
    
    For legacy firmware (64 VD firmware), invalidates LD (by setting LD value
    to 0xff) in LdTgtIdtoLd[] array for device index beyond 127, so that
    invalid LD(0xff) value should be returned beyond device index beyond 127.

    2) Break the iteration after (MAX_LOGICAL_DRIVES_EXT - 1)),
       instead of MAX_LOGICAL_DRIVES_EXT.
    3) Optimization in MFI INIT frame before firing.
    4) MFI IO frame should be 256bytes aligned.  Code is optimized to reduce
       the size of frame for fusion adapters and make the MFI frame size
       calculation a bit transparent and readable.

    commit 478913fdbdfd4a781d91c993eb86838620fe7421 upstream.
    
    The driver mismatched 'num_supplicants' with 'num_supplies' of
    power_supply structure.
    
    It provided list of supplicants (power_supply.supplied_to) but did
    not set the number of supplicants. Instead it set the num_supplies which
    is used when iterating over number of supplies (power_supply.supplied_from).
    
    As a result the list of supplicants was ignored by core because its size
    was 0.

    ALSA: hdspm - Constrain periods to 2 on older cards
    
    commit f0153c3d948c1764f6c920a0675d86fc1d75813e upstream.
    
    RME RayDAT and AIO use a fixed buffer size of 16384 samples. With period
    sizes of 32-4096, this translates to 4-512 periods.
    
    The older RME cards have a variable buffer size but require exactly two
    periods.
    
    This patch enforces nperiods=2 on those cards.

    ALSA: off by one bug in snd_riptide_joystick_probe()
    
    commit e4940626defdf6c92da1052ad3f12741c1a28c90 upstream.
    
    The problem here is that we check:
    
            if (dev >= SNDRV_CARDS)
    
    Then we increment "dev".
    
           if (!joystick_port[dev++])
    
    Then we use it as an offset into a array with SNDRV_CARDS elements.
    
            if (!request_region(joystick_port[dev], 8, "Riptide gameport")) {
    
    This has 3 effects:
    1) If you use the module option to specify the joystick port then it has
       to be shifted one space over.
    2) The wrong error message will be printed on failure if you have over
       32 cards.
    3) Static checkers will correctly complain that are off by one.

    ACPI / LPSS: Deassert resets for SPI host controllers on Braswell
    
    commit 3095794ae972bc6fc76af6cb3b864d6686b96094 upstream.
    
    On some Braswell systems BIOS leaves resets for SPI host controllers
    active. This prevents the SPI driver from transferring messages on wire.
    
    Fix this in similar way that we do for I2C already by deasserting resets
    for the SPI host controllers.

    ACPI / LPSS: Always disable I2C host controllers
    
    commit 3293c7b8ec213a640f5ea2e5efeaa2b7559b1e19 upstream.
    
    On Baytrail and Braswell the BIOS might leave the I2C host controllers
    enabled, probably because it uses them for its own purposes. This is fine
    in normal cases because the I2C driver will disable the hardware when it
    is probed anyway.
    
    However, in case of suspend to disk it is different story. If the driver
    happens to be compiled as a module the boot kernel never loads the driver
    thus leaving host controllers enabled upon loading the hibernation image.
    
    The I2C host controller interrupt mask register has default value of 0x8ff,
    in other words it has most of the interrupts unmasked. When combined with
    the fact that the host controller is enabled, the driver immediately starts
    getting interrupts even before its resume hook is called (once IO-APIC is
    resumed). Since the driver is not prepared for this it will crash the
    kernel due to NULL pointer derefence because dev->msgs is NULL.
    
    Unfortunately we were not able to get full backtrace to from the console
    which could be reproduced here.
    
    In order to fix this even when the driver is compiled as module, we disable
    the I2C host controllers in byt_i2c_setup() before devices are created.

    xen-scsiback: mark pvscsi frontend request consumed only after last read
    
    commit facb5732b0bb59ebbc11b5d5abc249e677ddbeb6 upstream.
    
    A request in the ring buffer mustn't be read after it has been marked
    as consumed. Otherwise it might already have been reused by the
    frontend without violating the ring protocol.
    
    To avoid inconsistencies in the backend only work on a private copy
    of the request. This will ensure a malicious guest not being able to
    bypass consistency checks of the backend by modifying an active
    request.

    xen/manage: Fix USB interaction issues when resuming
    
    commit 72978b2fe2f2cdf9f319c6c6dcdbe92b38de2be2 upstream.
    
    Commit 61a734d305e1 ("xen/manage: Always freeze/thaw processes when
    suspend/resuming") ensured that userspace processes were always frozen
    before suspending to reduce interaction issues when resuming devices.
    However, freeze_processes() does not freeze kernel threads.  Freeze
    kernel threads as well to prevent deadlocks with the khubd thread when
    resuming devices.
    
    This is what native suspend and resume does.

    cpufreq: speedstep-smi: enable interrupts when waiting
    
    commit d4d4eda23794c701442e55129dd4f8f2fefd5e4d upstream.
    
    On Dell Latitude C600 laptop with Pentium 3 850MHz processor, the
    speedstep-smi driver sometimes loads and sometimes doesn't load with
    "change to state X failed" message.
    
    The hardware sometimes refuses to change frequency and in this case, we
    need to retry later. I found out that we need to enable interrupts while
    waiting. When we enable interrupts, the hardware blockage that prevents
    frequency transition resolves and the transition is possible. With
    disabled interrupts, the blockage doesn't resolve (no matter how long do
    we wait). The exact reasons for this hardware behavior are unknown.
    
    This patch enables interrupts in the function speedstep_set_state that can
    be called with disabled interrupts. However, this function is called with
    disabled interrupts only from speedstep_get_freqs, so it shouldn't cause
    any problem.

    cpufreq: Set cpufreq_cpu_data to NULL before putting kobject
    
    commit 6ffae8c06fab058d6c3f8ecb7f921327721034e7 upstream.
    
    In __cpufreq_remove_dev_finish(), per-cpu 'cpufreq_cpu_data' needs
    to be cleared before calling kobject_put(&policy->kobj) and under
    cpufreq_driver_lock. Otherwise, if someone else calls cpufreq_cpu_get()
    in parallel with it, they can obtain a non-NULL policy from that after
    kobject_put(&policy->kobj) was executed.
    
    Consider this case:
    
    Thread A                                Thread B
    cpufreq_cpu_get()
      acquire cpufreq_driver_lock
      read-per-cpu cpufreq_cpu_data
                                            kobject_put(&policy->kobj);
      kobject_get(&policy->kobj);
                                            ...
                                            per_cpu(&cpufreq_cpu_data, cpu) = NULL
    
    And this will result in a warning like this one:

    The actual code flow is as follows:
    
     Thread A: Workqueue: kacpi_notify
    
     acpi_processor_notify()
       acpi_processor_ppc_has_changed()
             cpufreq_update_policy()
               cpufreq_cpu_get()
                 kobject_get()
    
     Thread B: xenbus_thread()
    
     xenbus_thread()
       msg->u.watch.handle->callback()
         handle_vcpu_hotplug_event()
           vcpu_hotplug()
             cpu_down()
               __cpu_notify(CPU_POST_DEAD..)
                 cpufreq_cpu_callback()
                   __cpufreq_remove_dev_finish()
                     cpufreq_policy_put_kobj()
                       kobject_put()
    
    cpufreq_cpu_get() gets the policy from per-cpu variable cpufreq_cpu_data
    under cpufreq_driver_lock, and once it gets a valid policy it expects it
    to not be freed until cpufreq_cpu_put() is called.
    
    But the race happens when another thread puts the kobject first and updates
    cpufreq_cpu_data before or later. And so the first thread gets a valid policy
    structure and before it does kobject_get() on it, the second one has already
    done kobject_put().
    
    Fix this by setting cpufreq_cpu_data to NULL before putting the kobject and that
    too under locks.

    commit 6d4beca3775222884e1ee9d48ef586c438c3dfa1 upstream.
    
    This driver utilizes a FIFO buffer for RX descriptors. There are four places

    ASoC: davinci: fix DM365_EVM codec selection
    
    commit f9a7ba326938f03b9305af8d31c360fce10cd4df upstream.
    
    An earlier bug fix of mine made the SND_DM365_VOICE_CODEC symbol
    tristate to avoid creating an undefined reference from the
    davinci-vcif.c driver to the davinci_soc_platform_register
    function that may be in a module.
    
    However, this may now lead to a different error on randconfig
    kernels:
    
    "warning: SND_DM365_VOICE_CODEC creates inconsistent choice state"
    
    This happens because we now have a choice statement with
    one bool and one tristate option, and the latter might not
    support being set to 'y' because of dependencies.
    
    This new change turns the other option into 'tristate' as well,
    which avoids the problem.

    ASoC: rt5677: fix SPI dependency
    
    commit 4c121129c9dcb43b33d1cd568c8f2636e72597b0 upstream.
    
    The rt5677 codec has gained code that requires SPI to work correctly,
    but there is no provision in Kconfig to prevent the driver from
    being used when SPI is disabled or a loadable module, resulting
    in this build error:
    
    sound/built-in.o: In function `rt5677_spi_write':
    :(.text+0xa7ba0): undefined reference to `spi_sync'
    sound/built-in.o: In function `rt5677_spi_driver_init':

    ERROR: "spi_register_driver" [sound/soc/codecs/snd-soc-rt5677-spi.ko] undefined!
    
    This makes the SPI portion of the driver depend on the SPI subsystem,
    and disables the function that uses SPI for firmware download if SPI
    is disabled. The latter may not be the correct solution, but I could
    not come up with a better one.

    commit 279e17ae81c17b40ae7a6c9e10f386a7aac7aa55 upstream.
    
    Function sst_acpi_probe() uses plain strcpy for setting member firmware_name
    of a struct intel_sst_drv from member firmware of a struct sst_machines.
    Thereby the destination array has got a length of 20 byte while the source may
    hold 32 byte. Since eg. commit 64b9c90b8600 ("ASoC: Intel: Fix BYTCR firmware
    name") increased strings from "fw_sst_0f28.bin" to "intel/fw_sst_0f28.bin"
    there is an actual possibility that the 20 byte array at the end of struct
    intel_sst_drv is overrun.
    
    Thus increase the size of the destination and use the same define for both
    structs. Detected by Coverity CID 1260087.

    PCI: Fix infinite loop with ROM image of size 0
    
    commit 16b036af31e1456cb69243a5a0c9ef801ecd1f17 upstream.
    
    If the image size would ever read as 0, pci_get_rom_size() could keep
    processing the same image over and over again.  Exit the loop if we ever
    read a length of zero.
    
    This fixes a soft lockup on boot when the radeon driver calls
    pci_get_rom_size() on an AMD Radeon R7 250X PCIe discrete graphics card.

    PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias var in uevent
    
    commit 145b3fe579db66fbe999a2bc3fd5b63dffe9636d upstream.
    
    Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
    automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
    is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.
    
    The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
    r3.0, Appendix D.  Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
    alpha characters, so they won't be affected.  For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
    20h, etc. are unaffected.
    
    Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
    already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.
    
    Commit 89ec3dcf17fd ("PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface
    class") fixed only half of the problem.  Some udev implementations rely on
    the uevent file and not the modalias file.

    commit 6d00f37e49d95e640a3937a4a1ae07dbe92a10cb upstream.
    
    d1c7e29e8d27 (HID: i2c-hid: prevent buffer overflow in early IRQ)
    changed hid_get_input() to read ihid->bufsize bytes, which can be
    more than wMaxInputLength. This is the case with the Dell XPS 13
    9343, and it is causing events to be missed. In some cases the
    missed events are releases, which can cause the cursor to jump or
    freeze, among other problems. Limit the number of bytes read to
    min(wMaxInputLength, ihid->bufsize) to prevent such problems.

    iwlwifi: mvm: always use mac color zero
    
    commit 5523d11cc46393a1e61b7ef4a0b2d4e7ed9521e4 upstream.
    
    We don't really need to use different mac colors when adding mac
    contexts, because they're not used anywhere.  In fact, the firmware
    doesn't accept 255 as a valid color, so we get into a SYSASSERT 0x3401
    when we reach that.
    
    Remove the color increment to use always zero and avoid reaching 255.

    iwlwifi: pcie: disable the SCD_BASE_ADDR when we resume from WoWLAN
    
    commit cd8f438405032ac8ff88bd8f2eca5e0c0063b14b upstream.
    
    The base address of the scheduler in the device's memory
    (SRAM) comes from two different sources. The periphery
    register and the alive notification from the firmware.
    We have a check in iwl_pcie_tx_start that ensures that
    they are the same.
    When we resume from WoWLAN, the firmware may have crashed
    for whatever reason. In that case, the whole device may be
    reset which means that the periphery register will hold a
    meaningless value. When we come to compare
    trans_pcie->scd_base_addr (which really holds the value we
    had when we loaded the WoWLAN firmware upon suspend) and
    the current value of the register, we don't see a match
    unsurprisingly.
    Trick the check to avoid a loud yet harmless WARN.
    Note that when the WoWLAN has crashed, we will see that
    in iwl_trans_pcie_d3_resume which will let the op_mode
    know. Once the op_mode is informed that the WowLAN firmware
    has crashed, it can't do much besides resetting the whole
    device.

    ksoftirqd: Enable IRQs and call cond_resched() before poking RCU
    
    commit 28423ad283d5348793b0c45cc9b1af058e776fd6 upstream.
    
    While debugging an issue with excessive softirq usage, I encountered the
    following note in commit 3e339b5dae24a706 ("softirq: Use hotplug thread
    infrastructure"):
    
        [ paulmck: Call rcu_note_context_switch() with interrupts enabled. ]
    
    ...but despite this note, the patch still calls RCU with IRQs disabled.
    
    This seemingly innocuous change caused a significant regression in softirq
    CPU usage on the sending side of a large TCP transfer (~1 GB/s): when
    introducing 0.01% packet loss, the softirq usage would jump to around 25%,
    spiking as high as 50%. Before the change, the usage would never exceed 5%.
    
    Moving the call to rcu_note_context_switch() after the cond_sched() call,
    as it was originally before the hotplug patch, completely eliminated this
    problem.

    fsnotify: fix handling of renames in audit
    
    commit 6ee8e25fc3e916193bce4ebb43d5439e1e2144ab upstream.
    
    Commit e9fd702a58c4 ("audit: convert audit watches to use fsnotify
    instead of inotify") broke handling of renames in audit.  Audit code
    wants to update inode number of an inode corresponding to watched name
    in a directory.  When something gets renamed into a directory to a
    watched name, inotify previously passed moved inode to audit code
    however new fsnotify code passes directory inode where the change
    happened.  That confuses audit and it starts watching parent directory
    instead of a file in a directory.
    
    This can be observed for example by doing:
    
      cd /tmp
      touch foo bar
      auditctl -w /tmp/foo
      touch foo
      mv bar foo
      touch foo
    
    In audit log we see events like:
    
      type=CONFIG_CHANGE msg=audit(1423563584.155:90): auid=1000 ses=2 op="updated rules" path="/tmp/foo" key=(null) list=4 res=1
      ...
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=2 name="bar" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=3 name="foo" inode=1046842 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=DELETE
      type=PATH msg=audit(1423563584.155:91): item=4 name="foo" inode=1046884 dev=08:0 2 mode=0100644 ouid=0 ogid=0 rdev=00:00 nametype=CREATE
      ...
    
    and that's it - we see event for the first touch after creating the
    audit rule, we see events for rename but we don't see any event for the
    last touch.  However we start seeing events for unrelated stuff
    happening in /tmp.
    
    Fix the problem by passing moved inode as data in the FS_MOVED_FROM and
    FS_MOVED_TO events instead of the directory where the change happens.
    This doesn't introduce any new problems because noone besides
    audit_watch.c cares about the passed value:
    
      fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify.c cares only about FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH events.
      fs/notify/dnotify/dnotify.c doesn't care about passed 'data' value at all.
      fs/notify/inotify/inotify_fsnotify.c uses 'data' only for FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH.
      kernel/audit_tree.c doesn't care about passed 'data' at all.
      kernel/audit_watch.c expects moved inode as 'data'.

    xfs: only trace buffer items if they exist
    
    commit e9892d3cc853afdda2cc69e2576d9ddb5fafad71 upstream.
    
    The commit 2d3d0c5 ("xfs: lobotomise xfs_trans_read_buf_map()") left
    a landmine in the tracing code: trace_xfs_trans_buf_read() is now
    call on all buffers that are read through this interface rather than
    just buffers in transactions. For buffers outside transaction
    context, bp->b_fspriv is null, and so the buf log item tracing
    functions cannot be called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference
    in the trace_xfs_trans_buf_read() function when tracing is turned
    on.

    xfs: set superblock buffer type correctly
    
    commit 3443a3bca54588f43286b725d8648d33a38c86f1 upstream.
    
    When the superblock is modified in a transaction, the commonly
    modified fields are not actually copied to the superblock buffer to
    avoid the buffer lock becoming a serialisation point. However, there
    are some other operations that modify the superblock fields within
    the transaction that don't directly log to the superblock but rely
    on the changes to be applied during the transaction commit (to
    minimise the buffer lock hold time).
    
    When we do this, we fail to mark the buffer log item as being a
    superblock buffer and that can lead to the buffer not being marked
    with the corect type in the log and hence causing recovery issues.
    Fix it by setting the type correctly, similar to xfs_mod_sb()...

    xfs: ensure buffer types are set correctly
    
    commit 0d612fb570b71ea2e49554a770cff4c489018b2c upstream.
    
    Jan Kara reported that log recovery was finding buffers with invalid
    types in them. This should not happen, and indicates a bug in the
    logging of buffers. To catch this, add asserts to the buffer
    formatting code to ensure that the buffer type is in range when the
    transaction is committed.
    
    We don't set a type on buffers being marked stale - they are not
    going to get replayed, the format item exists only for recovery to
    be able to prevent replay of the buffer, so the type does not
    matter. Hence that needs special casing here.

    random: Fix fast_mix() function
    
    commit 19acc77a36970958a4a0e4daeb2c8cb2aab0ffd4 upstream.
    
    There was a bad typo in commit 43759d4f429c ("random: use an improved
    fast_mix() function") and I didn't notice because it "looked right", so
    I saw what I expected to see when I reviewed it.
    
    Only months later did I look and notice it's not the Threefish-inspired
    mix function that I had designed and optimized.
    
    Mea Culpa.  Each input bit still has a chance to affect each output bit,
    and the fast pool is spilled *long* before it fills, so it's not a total
    disaster, but it's definitely not the intended great improvement.
    
    I'm still working on finding better rotation constants.  These are good
    enough, but since it's unrolled twice, it's possible to get better
    mixing for free by using eight different constants rather than repeating
    the same four.

    The Dynex/Insignia USB dongles are Broadcom BCM20702B0 based and require
    firmware update before operation.

    Since this is an unsual USB vendor ID (0x19ff), these dongles are added
    via USB_DEVICE macro and not USB_VENDOR_AND_INTERFACE_INFO as done for
    mainstream Broadcom based dongles.
    
    The latest known working firmware is BCM20702B0_002.001.014.0527.0557.hex
    which needs to be converted using hex2hcd utility and then installed
    as /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM20702A0-19ff-0239.hcd to make this device fully
    operational.
    
    Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: patching hci_ver=06 hci_rev=2000 lmp_ver=06 lmp_subver=410e
    Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: firmware hci_ver=06 hci_rev=222d lmp_ver=06 lmp_subver=410e
    
    With this firmware the device reports support for connectionless slave
    broadcast (master and slave) feature used by 3D Glasses and TVs.
    
      < HCI Command: Read Local Extended Features (0x04|0x0004) plen 1
              Page: 2
      > HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 14
            Read Local Extended Features (0x04|0x0004) ncmd 1
              Status: Success (0x00)

                Synchronization Train
                Synchronization Scan
    
    However there are some flaws with this feature. The Set Event Mask Page 2
    command is actually not supported and with that all connectionless slave
    broadcast events are always enabled.
    
      < HCI Command: Set Event Mask Page 2 (0x03|0x0063) plen 8
              Mask: 0x00000000000f0000

      > HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
            Set Event Mask Page 2 (0x03|0x0063) ncmd 1
              Status: Unknown HCI Command (0x01)
    
    In addition the Synchronization Train Received event is actually broken
    on this controller. It mixes up the order of parameters. According to the
    Bluetooth Core specification the fields are like this:
    
      struct hci_ev_sync_train_received {
              __u8     status;
              bdaddr_t bdaddr;
              __le32   offset;
              __u8     map[10];
              __u8     lt_addr;
              __le32   instant;
              __le16   interval;
              __u8     service_data;
      } __packed;
    
    This controller however sends the service_data as 5th parameter instead
    of having it as last parameter.
    
      struct hci_ev_sync_train_received {
              __u8     status;
              bdaddr_t bdaddr;
              __le32   offset;
              __u8     map[10];
              __u8     service_data;
              __u8     lt_addr;
              __le32   instant;
              __le16   interval;
      } __packed;
    
    So anybody trying to use this hardware for utilizing connectionless slave
    broadcast receivers (aka 3D Glasses), be warned about this shortcoming.

    Bluetooth: Fix valid Identity Address check
    
    commit e12af489b91d47a806f4e96e4edc20df612482e7 upstream.
    
    According to the Bluetooth core specification valid identity addresses
    are either Public Device Addresses or Static Random Addresses. IRKs
    received with any other type of address should be discarded since we
    cannot assume to know the permanent identity of the peer device.
    
    This patch fixes a missing check for the Identity Address when receiving
    the Identity Address Information SMP PDU.

    Bluetooth: ath3k: workaround the compatibility issue with xHCI controller
    
    commit c561a5753dd631920c4459a067d22679b3d110d6 upstream.
    
    BugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1400215
    
    ath3k devices fail to load firmwares on xHCI buses, but work well on
    EHCI, this might be a compatibility issue between xHCI and ath3k chips.
    As my testing result, those chips will work on xHCI buses again with
    this patch.
    
    This workaround is from Qualcomm, they also did some workarounds in
    Windows driver.

    ext4: ignore journal checksum on remount; don't fail
    
    commit 2d5b86e048780c5efa7f7d9708815555919e7b05 upstream.
    
    As of v3.18, ext4 started rejecting a remount which changes the
    journal_checksum option.
    
    Prior to that, it was simply ignored; the problem here is that
    if someone has this in their fstab for the root fs, now the box
    fails to boot properly, because remount of root with the new options
    will fail, and the box proceeds with a readonly root.
    
    I think it is a little nicer behavior to accept the option, but
    warn that it's being ignored, rather than failing the mount,
    but that might be a subjective matter...
