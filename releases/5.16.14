    xen/netfront: react properly to failing gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref()
    
    Commit 66e3531b33ee51dad17c463b4d9c9f52e341503d upstream.
    
    When calling gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() the returned value must
    be tested and the reaction to that value should be appropriate.
    
    In case of failure in xennet_get_responses() the reaction should not be
    to crash the system, but to disable the network device.
    
    The calls in setup_netfront() can be replaced by calls of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access(). While at it avoid double free of ring
    pages and grant references via xennet_disconnect_backend() in this case.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23042 / part of XSA-396.

    xen/gnttab: fix gnttab_end_foreign_access() without page specified
    
    Commit 42baefac638f06314298087394b982ead9ec444b upstream.
    
    gnttab_end_foreign_access() is used to free a grant reference and
    optionally to free the associated page. In case the grant is still in
    use by the other side processing is being deferred. This leads to a
    problem in case no page to be freed is specified by the caller: the
    caller doesn't know that the page is still mapped by the other side
    and thus should not be used for other purposes.
    
    The correct way to handle this situation is to take an additional
    reference to the granted page in case handling is being deferred and
    to drop that reference when the grant reference could be freed
    finally.
    
    This requires that there are no users of gnttab_end_foreign_access()
    left directly repurposing the granted page after the call, as this
    might result in clobbered data or information leaks via the not yet
    freed grant reference.
    
    This is part of CVE-2022-23041 / XSA-396.

    xen/9p: use alloc/free_pages_exact()
    
    Commit 5cadd4bb1d7fc9ab201ac14620d1a478357e4ebd upstream.
    
    Instead of __get_free_pages() and free_pages() use alloc_pages_exact()
    and free_pages_exact(). This is in preparation of a change of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access() which will prohibit use of high-order
    pages.
    
    By using the local variable "order" instead of ring->intf->ring_order
    in the error path of xen_9pfs_front_alloc_dataring() another bug is
    fixed, as the error path can be entered before ring->intf->ring_order
    is being set.
    
    By using alloc_pages_exact() the size in bytes is specified for the
    allocation, which fixes another bug for the case of
    order < (PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT).
    
    This is part of CVE-2022-23041 / XSA-396.

    xen: remove gnttab_query_foreign_access()
    
    Commit 1dbd11ca75fe664d3e54607547771d021f531f59 upstream.
    
    Remove gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as it is unused and unsafe to
    use.
    
    All previous use cases assumed a grant would not be in use after
    gnttab_query_foreign_access() returned 0. This information is useless
    in best case, as it only refers to a situation in the past, which could
    have changed already.

    xen/gntalloc: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access()
    
    Commit d3b6372c5881cb54925212abb62c521df8ba4809 upstream.
    
    Using gnttab_query_foreign_access() is unsafe, as it is racy by design.
    
    The use case in the gntalloc driver is not needed at all. While at it
    replace the call of gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() with a call of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access(), which is what is really wanted there. In
    case the grant wasn't used due to an allocation failure, just free the
    grant via gnttab_free_grant_reference().
    
    This is CVE-2022-23039 / part of XSA-396.

    Commit 6b1775f26a2da2b05a6dc8ec2b5d14e9a4701a1a upstream.
    
    Add a new grant table function gnttab_try_end_foreign_access(), which
    will remove and free a grant if it is not in use.
    
    Its main use case is to either free a grant if it is no longer in use,
    or to take some other action if it is still in use. This other action
    can be an error exit, or (e.g. in the case of blkfront persistent grant
    feature) some special handling.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23038 / part of XSA-396.

    xen/xenbus: don't let xenbus_grant_ring() remove grants in error case
    
    Commit 3777ea7bac3113005b7180e6b9dadf16d19a5827 upstream.
    
    Letting xenbus_grant_ring() tear down grants in the error case is
    problematic, as the other side could already have used these grants.
    Calling gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() without checking success is
    resulting in an unclear situation for any caller of xenbus_grant_ring()
    as in the error case the memory pages of the ring page might be
    partially mapped. Freeing them would risk unwanted foreign access to
    them, while not freeing them would leak memory.
    
    In order to remove the need to undo any gnttab_grant_foreign_access()
    calls, use gnttab_alloc_grant_references() to make sure no further
    error can occur in the loop granting access to the ring pages.
    
    It should be noted that this way of handling removes leaking of
    grant entries in the error case, too.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23040 / part of XSA-396.

    arm64: Do not include __READ_ONCE() block in assembly files
    
    commit 52c9f93a9c482251cb0d224faa602ba26d462be8 upstream.
    
    When building arm64 defconfig + CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_{FULL,THIN}=y after
    commit 558c303c9734 ("arm64: Mitigate spectre style branch history side
    channels"), the following error occurs:
    
      <instantiation>:4:2: error: invalid fixup for movz/movk instruction
       mov w0, #ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3
       ^
    
    Marc figured out that moving "#include <linux/init.h>" in
    include/linux/arm-smccc.h into a !__ASSEMBLY__ block resolves it. The
    full include chain with CONFIG_LTO=y from include/linux/arm-smccc.h:
    
    include/linux/init.h
    include/linux/compiler.h
    arch/arm64/include/asm/rwonce.h
    arch/arm64/include/asm/alternative-macros.h
    arch/arm64/include/asm/assembler.h
    
    The asm/alternative-macros.h include in asm/rwonce.h only happens when
    CONFIG_LTO is set, which ultimately casues asm/assembler.h to be
    included before the definition of ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3. As a
    result, the preprocessor does not expand ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3 in
    __mitigate_spectre_bhb_fw, which results in the error above.
    
    Avoid this problem by just avoiding the CONFIG_LTO=y __READ_ONCE() block
    in asm/rwonce.h with assembly files, as nothing in that block is useful
    to assembly files, which allows ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3 to be
    properly expanded with CONFIG_LTO=y builds.

    meantime, just define NOCROSSREFS to nothing when using ld.lld, with a
    link to the issue for tracking.

    arm64: proton-pack: Include unprivileged eBPF status in Spectre v2 mitigation reporting
    
    commit 58c9a5060cb7cd529d49c93954cdafe81c1d642a upstream.
    
    The mitigations for Spectre-BHB are only applied when an exception is
    taken from user-space. The mitigation status is reported via the spectre_v2
    sysfs vulnerabilities file.
    
    When unprivileged eBPF is enabled the mitigation in the exception vectors
    can be avoided by an eBPF program.
    
    When unprivileged eBPF is enabled, print a warning and report vulnerable
    via the sysfs vulnerabilities file.

    arm64: Use the clearbhb instruction in mitigations
    
    commit 228a26b912287934789023b4132ba76065d9491c upstream.
    
    Future CPUs may implement a clearbhb instruction that is sufficient
    to mitigate SpectreBHB. CPUs that implement this instruction, but
    not CSV2.3 must be affected by Spectre-BHB.
    
    Add support to use this instruction as the BHB mitigation on CPUs
    that support it. The instruction is in the hint space, so it will
    be treated by a NOP as older CPUs.

    arm64: Mitigate spectre style branch history side channels
    
    commit 558c303c9734af5a813739cd284879227f7297d2 upstream.
    
    Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors can
    make use of branch history to influence future speculation.
    When taking an exception from user-space, a sequence of branches
    or a firmware call overwrites or invalidates the branch history.
    
    The sequence of branches is added to the vectors, and should appear
    before the first indirect branch. For systems using KPTI the sequence
    is added to the kpti trampoline where it has a free register as the exit
    from the trampoline is via a 'ret'. For systems not using KPTI, the same
    register tricks are used to free up a register in the vectors.
    
    For the firmware call, arch-workaround-3 clobbers 4 registers, so
    there is no choice but to save them to the EL1 stack. This only happens
    for entry from EL0, so if we take an exception due to the stack access,
    it will not become re-entrant.
    
    For KVM, the existing branch-predictor-hardening vectors are used.
    When a spectre version of these vectors is in use, the firmware call
    is sufficient to mitigate against Spectre-BHB. For the non-spectre
    versions, the sequence of branches is added to the indirect vector.

    arm64: Add percpu vectors for EL1
    
    commit bd09128d16fac3c34b80bd6a29088ac632e8ce09 upstream.
    
    The Spectre-BHB workaround adds a firmware call to the vectors. This
    is needed on some CPUs, but not others. To avoid the unaffected CPU in
    a big/little pair from making the firmware call, create per cpu vectors.
    
    The per-cpu vectors only apply when returning from EL0.
    
    Systems using KPTI can use the canonical 'full-fat' vectors directly at
    EL1, the trampoline exit code will switch to this_cpu_vector on exit to
    EL0. Systems not using KPTI should always use this_cpu_vector.
    
    this_cpu_vector will point at a vector in tramp_vecs or
    __bp_harden_el1_vectors, depending on whether KPTI is in use.

    arm64: entry: Add macro for reading symbol addresses from the trampoline
    
    commit b28a8eebe81c186fdb1a0078263b30576c8e1f42 upstream.
    
    The trampoline code needs to use the address of symbols in the wider
    kernel, e.g. vectors. PC-relative addressing wouldn't work as the
    trampoline code doesn't run at the address the linker expected.
    
    tramp_ventry uses a literal pool, unless CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE is
    set, in which case it uses the data page as a literal pool because
    the data page can be unmapped when running in user-space, which is
    required for CPUs vulnerable to meltdown.
    
    Pull this logic out as a macro, instead of adding a third copy
    of it.

    arm64: entry: Add vectors that have the bhb mitigation sequences
    
    commit ba2689234be92024e5635d30fe744f4853ad97db upstream.
    
    Some CPUs affected by Spectre-BHB need a sequence of branches, or a
    firmware call to be run before any indirect branch. This needs to go
    in the vectors. No CPU needs both.
    
    While this can be patched in, it would run on all CPUs as there is a
    single set of vectors. If only one part of a big/little combination is
    affected, the unaffected CPUs have to run the mitigation too.
    
    Create extra vectors that include the sequence. Subsequent patches will
    allow affected CPUs to select this set of vectors. Later patches will
    modify the loop count to match what the CPU requires.

    commit 6c5bf79b69f911560fbf82214c0971af6e58e682 upstream.
    
    Systems using kpti enter and exit the kernel through a trampoline mapping
    that is always mapped, even when the kernel is not. tramp_valias is a macro
    to find the address of a symbol in the trampoline mapping.
    
    Adding extra sets of vectors will expand the size of the entry.tramp.text
    section to beyond 4K. tramp_valias will be unable to generate addresses
    for symbols beyond 4K as it uses the 12 bit immediate of the add
    instruction.
    
    As there are now two registers available when tramp_alias is called,
    use the extra register to avoid the 4K limit of the 12 bit immediate.

    arm64: entry: Move the trampoline data page before the text page
    
    commit c091fb6ae059cda563b2a4d93fdbc548ef34e1d6 upstream.
    
    The trampoline code has a data page that holds the address of the vectors,
    which is unmapped when running in user-space. This ensures that with
    CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE, the randomised address of the kernel can't be
    discovered until after the kernel has been mapped.
    
    If the trampoline text page is extended to include multiple sets of
    vectors, it will be larger than a single page, making it tricky to
    find the data page without knowing the size of the trampoline text
    pages, which will vary with PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Move the data page to appear before the text page. This allows the
    data page to be found without knowing the size of the trampoline text
    pages. 'tramp_vectors' is used to refer to the beginning of the
    .entry.tramp.text section, do that explicitly.

    commit d739da1694a0eaef0358a42b76904b611539b77b upstream.
    
    Subsequent patches will add additional sets of vectors that use
    the same tricks as the kpti vectors to reach the full-fat vectors.
    The full-fat vectors contain some cleanup for kpti that is patched
    in by alternatives when kpti is in use. Once there are additional
    vectors, the cleanup will be needed in more cases.
    
    But on big/little systems, the cleanup would be harmful if no
    trampoline vector were in use. Instead of forcing CPUs that don't
    need a trampoline vector to use one, make the trampoline cleanup
    optional.
    
    Entry at the top of the vectors will skip the cleanup. The trampoline
    vectors can then skip the first instruction, triggering the cleanup
    to run.

    KVM: arm64: Allow indirect vectors to be used without SPECTRE_V3A
    
    commit 5bdf3437603d4af87f9c7f424b0c8aeed2420745 upstream.
    
    CPUs vulnerable to Spectre-BHB either need to make an SMC-CC firmware
    call from the vectors, or run a sequence of branches. This gets added
    to the hyp vectors. If there is no support for arch-workaround-1 in
    firmware, the indirect vector will be used.
    
    kvm_init_vector_slots() only initialises the two indirect slots if
    the platform is vulnerable to Spectre-v3a. pKVM's hyp_map_vectors()
    only initialises __hyp_bp_vect_base if the platform is vulnerable to
    Spectre-v3a.
    
    As there are about to more users of the indirect vectors, ensure
    their entries in hyp_spectre_vector_selector[] are always initialised,
    and __hyp_bp_vect_base defaults to the regular VA mapping.
    
    The Spectre-v3a check is moved to a helper
    kvm_system_needs_idmapped_vectors(), and merged with the code
    that creates the hyp mappings.

    commit 25875aa71dfefd1959f07e626c4d285b88b27ac2 upstream.
    
    The mitigations for Spectre-BHB are only applied when an exception
    is taken, but when unprivileged BPF is enabled, userspace can
    load BPF programs that can be used to exploit the problem.
    
    When unprivileged BPF is enabled, report the vulnerable status via
    the spectre_v2 sysfs file.

    x86/speculation: Warn about eIBRS + LFENCE + Unprivileged eBPF + SMT
    
    commit 0de05d056afdb00eca8c7bbb0c79a3438daf700c upstream.
    
    The commit
    
       44a3918c8245 ("x86/speculation: Include unprivileged eBPF status in Spectre v2 mitigation reporting")
    
    added a warning for the "eIBRS + unprivileged eBPF" combination, which
    has been shown to be vulnerable against Spectre v2 BHB-based attacks.
    
    However, there's no warning about the "eIBRS + LFENCE retpoline +
    unprivileged eBPF" combo. The LFENCE adds more protection by shortening
    the speculation window after a mispredicted branch. That makes an attack
    significantly more difficult, even with unprivileged eBPF. So at least
    for now the logic doesn't warn about that combination.
    
    But if you then add SMT into the mix, the SMT attack angle weakens the
    effectiveness of the LFENCE considerably.
    
    So extend the "eIBRS + unprivileged eBPF" warning to also include the
    "eIBRS + LFENCE + unprivileged eBPF + SMT" case.

    x86/speculation: Warn about Spectre v2 LFENCE mitigation
    
    commit eafd987d4a82c7bb5aa12f0e3b4f8f3dea93e678 upstream.
    
    With:
    
      f8a66d608a3e ("x86,bugs: Unconditionally allow spectre_v2=retpoline,amd")
    
    it became possible to enable the LFENCE "retpoline" on Intel. However,
    Intel doesn't recommend it, as it has some weaknesses compared to
    retpoline.
    
    Now AMD doesn't recommend it either.
    
    It can still be left available as a cmdline option. It's faster than
    retpoline but is weaker in certain scenarios -- particularly SMT, but
    even non-SMT may be vulnerable in some cases.
    
    So just unconditionally warn if the user requests it on the cmdline.

    x86/speculation: Use generic retpoline by default on AMD
    
    commit 244d00b5dd4755f8df892c86cab35fb2cfd4f14b upstream.
    
    AMD retpoline may be susceptible to speculation. The speculation
    execution window for an incorrect indirect branch prediction using
    LFENCE/JMP sequence may potentially be large enough to allow
    exploitation using Spectre V2.
    
    By default, don't use retpoline,lfence on AMD.  Instead, use the
    generic retpoline.

    commit 1e19da8522c81bf46b335f84137165741e0d82b7 upstream.
    
    Thanks to the chaps at VUsec it is now clear that eIBRS is not
    sufficient, therefore allow enabling of retpolines along with eIBRS.
    
    Add spectre_v2=eibrs, spectre_v2=eibrs,lfence and
    spectre_v2=eibrs,retpoline options to explicitly pick your preferred
    means of mitigation.
    
    Since there's new mitigations there's also user visible changes in
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2 to reflect these
    new mitigations.

    x86/speculation: Rename RETPOLINE_AMD to RETPOLINE_LFENCE
    
    commit d45476d9832409371537013ebdd8dc1a7781f97a upstream.
    
    The RETPOLINE_AMD name is unfortunate since it isn't necessarily
    AMD only, in fact Hygon also uses it. Furthermore it will likely be
    sufficient for some Intel processors. Therefore rename the thing to
    RETPOLINE_LFENCE to better describe what it is.
    
    Add the spectre_v2=retpoline,lfence option as an alias to
    spectre_v2=retpoline,amd to preserve existing setups. However, the output
    of /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2 will be changed.
