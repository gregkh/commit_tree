    x86/xen: do not identity map UNUSABLE regions in the machine E820
    
    commit 3bc38cbceb85881a8eb789ee1aa56678038b1909 upstream.
    
    If there are UNUSABLE regions in the machine memory map, dom0 will
    attempt to map them 1:1 which is not permitted by Xen and the kernel
    will crash.
    
    There isn't anything interesting in the UNUSABLE region that the dom0
    kernel needs access to so we can avoid making the 1:1 mapping and
    treat it as RAM.
    
    We only do this for dom0, as that is where tboot case shows up.
    A PV domU could have an UNUSABLE region in its pseudo-physical map
    and would need to be handled in another patch.
    
    This fixes a boot failure on hosts with tboot.
    
    tboot marks a region in the e820 map as unusable and the dom0 kernel
    would attempt to map this region and Xen does not permit unusable
    regions to be mapped by guests.

    target: Fix trailing ASCII space usage in INQUIRY vendor+model
    
    commit ee60bddba5a5f23e39598195d944aa0eb2d455e5 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes spc_emulate_inquiry_std() to add trailing ASCII
    spaces for INQUIRY vendor + model fields following SPC-4 text:
    
      "ASCII data fields described as being left-aligned shall have any
       unused bytes at the end of the field (i.e., highest offset) and
       the unused bytes shall be filled with ASCII space characters (20h)."
    
    This addresses a problem with Falconstor NSS multipathing.

    ALSA: opti9xx: Fix conflicting driver object name
    
    commit fb615499f0ad28ed74201c1cdfddf9e64e205424 upstream.
    
    The recent commit to delay the release of kobject triggered NULL
    dereferences of opti9xx drivers.  The cause is that all
    snd-opti92x-ad1848, snd-opti92x-cs4231 and snd-opti93x drivers
    register the PnP card driver with the very same name, and also
    snd-opti92x-ad1848 and -cs4231 drivers register the ISA driver with
    the same name, too.  When these drivers are built in, quick
    "register-release-and-re-register" actions occur, and this results in
    Oops because of the same name is assigned to the kobject.
    
    The fix is simply to assign individual names.  As a bonus, by using
    KBUILD_MODNAME, the patch reduces more lines than it adds.
    
    The fix is based on the suggestion by Russell King.

    workqueue: cond_resched() after processing each work item
    
    commit b22ce2785d97423846206cceec4efee0c4afd980 upstream.
    
    If !PREEMPT, a kworker running work items back to back can hog CPU.
    This becomes dangerous when a self-requeueing work item which is
    waiting for something to happen races against stop_machine.  Such
    self-requeueing work item would requeue itself indefinitely hogging
    the kworker and CPU it's running on while stop_machine would wait for
    that CPU to enter stop_machine while preventing anything else from
    happening on all other CPUs.  The two would deadlock.
    
    Jamie Liu reports that this deadlock scenario exists around
    scsi_requeue_run_queue() and libata port multiplier support, where one
    port may exclude command processing from other ports.  With the right
    timing, scsi_requeue_run_queue() can end up requeueing itself trying
    to execute an IO which is asked to be retried while another device has
    an exclusive access, which in turn can't make forward progress due to
    stop_machine.
    
    Fix it by invoking cond_resched() after executing each work item.

    drivers/base/memory.c: fix show_mem_removable() to handle missing sections
    
    commit 21ea9f5ace3a7317cc3ba1fbc749758021a83136 upstream.
    
    "cat /sys/devices/system/memory/memory*/removable" crashed the system.
    
    The problem is that show_mem_removable() is passing a
    bad pfn to is_mem_section_removable(), which causes
    
        if (!node_online(page_to_nid(page)))
    
    to blow up.  Why is it passing in a bad pfn?
    
    The reason is that show_mem_removable() will loop sections_per_block
    times.  sections_per_block is 16, but mem->section_count is 8,
    indicating holes in this memory block.  Checking that the memory section
    is present before checking to see if the memory section is removable
    fixes the problem.

    SUNRPC: Fix memory corruption issue on 32-bit highmem systems
    
    commit 347e2233b7667e336d9f671f1a52dfa3f0416e2c upstream.
    
    Some architectures, such as ARM-32 do not return the same base address
    when you call kmap_atomic() twice on the same page.
    This causes problems for the memmove() call in the XDR helper routine
    "_shift_data_right_pages()", since it defeats the detection of
    overlapping memory ranges, and has been seen to corrupt memory.
    
    The fix is to distinguish between the case where we're doing an
    inter-page copy or not. In the former case of we know that the memory
    ranges cannot possibly overlap, so we can additionally micro-optimise
    by replacing memmove() with memcpy().

    powerpc/hvsi: Increase handshake timeout from 200ms to 400ms.
    
    commit d220980b701d838560a70de691b53be007e99e78 upstream.
    
    This solves a problem observed in kexec'ed kernel where 200ms timeout is
    too short and bootconsole fails to initialize. Console did eventually
    become workable but much later into the boot process.
    
    Observed timeout was around 260ms, but I decided to make it a little bigger
    for more reliability.
    
    This has been tested on Power7 machine with Petitboot as a primary
    bootloader and PowerNV firmware.

    powerpc: Work around gcc miscompilation of __pa() on 64-bit
    
    commit bdbc29c19b2633b1d9c52638fb732bcde7a2031a upstream.
    
    On 64-bit, __pa(&static_var) gets miscompiled by recent versions of
    gcc as something like:
    
            addis 3,2,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@ha
            addi 3,3,.LANCHOR1+4611686018427387904@toc@l
    
    This ends up effectively ignoring the offset, since its bottom 32 bits
    are zero, and means that the result of __pa() still has 0xC in the top
    nibble.  This happens with gcc 4.8.1, at least.
    
    To work around this, for 64-bit we make __pa() use an AND operator,
    and for symmetry, we make __va() use an OR operator.  Using an AND
    operator rather than a subtraction ends up with slightly shorter code
    since it can be done with a single clrldi instruction, whereas it
    takes three instructions to form the constant (-PAGE_OFFSET) and add
    it on.  (Note that MEMORY_START is always 0 on 64-bit.)

    powerpc: Don't Oops when accessing /proc/powerpc/lparcfg without hypervisor
    
    commit f5f6cbb61610b7bf9d9d96db9c3979d62a424bab upstream.
    
    /proc/powerpc/lparcfg is an ancient facility (though still actively used)
    which allows access to some informations relative to the partition when
    running underneath a PAPR compliant hypervisor.
    
    It makes no sense on non-pseries machines. However, currently, not only
    can it be created on these if the kernel has pseries support, but accessing
    it on such a machine will crash due to trying to do hypervisor calls.
    
    In fact, it should also not do HV calls on older pseries that didn't have
    an hypervisor either.
    
    Finally, it has the plumbing to be a module but is a "bool" Kconfig option.
    
    This fixes the whole lot by turning it into a machine_device_initcall
    that is only created on pseries, and adding the necessary hypervisor
    check before calling the H_GET_EM_PARMS hypercall

    ath9k_htc: Restore skb headroom when returning skb to mac80211
    
    commit d2e9fc141e2aa21f4b35ee27072d84e9aa6e2ba0 upstream.
    
    ath9k_htc adds padding between the 802.11 header and the payload during
    TX by moving the header. When handing the frame back to mac80211 for TX
    status handling the header is not moved back into its original position.
    This can result in a too small skb headroom when entering ath9k_htc
    again (due to a soft retransmission for example) causing an
    skb_under_panic oops.
    
    Fix this by moving the 802.11 header back into its original position
    before returning the frame to mac80211 as other drivers like rt2x00
    or ath5k do.

    sparc32: support atomic64_t
    
    commit aea1181b0bd0a09c54546399768f359d1e198e45 upstream.
    
    There is no-one that really require atomic64_t support on sparc32.
    But several drivers fails to build without proper atomic64 support.
    And for an allyesconfig build for sparc32 this is annoying.
    
    Include the generic atomic64_t support for sparc32.
    This has a text footprint cost:
    
    $size vmlinux (before atomic64_t support)
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    3578860  134260  108781 3821901  3a514d vmlinux
    
    $size vmlinux (after atomic64_t support)
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    3579892  130684  108781 3819357  3a475d vmlinux
    
    text increase (3579892 - 3578860) = 1032 bytes
    
    data decreases - but I fail to explain why!
    I have rebuild twice to check my numbers.

    In light of this, don't pass -msmall-data to gcc, which otherwise results

    nilfs2: fix issue with counting number of bio requests for BIO_EOPNOTSUPP error detection
    
    commit 4bf93b50fd04118ac7f33a3c2b8a0a1f9fa80bc9 upstream.
    
    Fix the issue with improper counting number of flying bio requests for
    BIO_EOPNOTSUPP error detection case.
    
    The sb_nbio must be incremented exactly the same number of times as
    complete() function was called (or will be called) because
    nilfs_segbuf_wait() will call wail_for_completion() for the number of
    times set to sb_nbio:
    
      do {
          wait_for_completion(&segbuf->sb_bio_event);
      } while (--segbuf->sb_nbio > 0);
    
    Two functions complete() and wait_for_completion() must be called the
    same number of times for the same sb_bio_event.  Otherwise,
    wait_for_completion() will hang or leak.

    Apparently, the ref_count for some scsi_device drops down to zero,
    triggering device removal through execute_in_process_context(), while
    the lldd error recovery thread iterates through a scsi device list.
    Unfortunately, execute_in_process_context() decides to immediately
    execute that device removal function, instead of scheduling asynchronous
    execution, since it detects process context and thinks it is safe to do
    so. But almost all calls to shost_for_each_device() in our lldd are
    inside spin_lock_irq, even in thread context. Obviously, schedule()
    inside spin_lock_irq sections is a bad idea.
    
    Change the lldd to use the proper iterator function,
    __shost_for_each_device(), in combination with required locking.
    
    Occurences that need to be changed include all calls in zfcp_erp.c,
    since those might be executed in zfcp error recovery thread context
    with a lock held.
    
    Other occurences of shost_for_each_device() in zfcp_fsf.c do not
    need to be changed (no process context, no surrounding locking).
    
    The problem was introduced in Linux 2.6.37 by commit
    b62a8d9b45b971a67a0f8413338c230e3117dff5

    zfcp: fix lock imbalance by reworking request queue locking
    
    commit d79ff142624e1be080ad8d09101f7004d79c36e1 upstream.
    
    This patch adds wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout(), which is a
    straight-forward descendant of wait_event_interruptible_timeout() and
    wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq().
    
    The zfcp driver used to call wait_event_interruptible_timeout()
    in combination with some intricate and error-prone locking. Using
    wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout() as a replacement
    nicely cleans up that locking.
    
    This rework removes a situation that resulted in a locking imbalance
    in zfcp_qdio_sbal_get():
    
    BUG: workqueue leaked lock or atomic: events/1/0xffffff00/10
        last function: zfcp_fc_wka_port_offline+0x0/0xa0 [zfcp]
    
    It was introduced by commit c2af7545aaff3495d9bf9a7608c52f0af86fb194
    "[SCSI] zfcp: Do not wait for SBALs on stopped queue", which had a new
    code path related to ZFCP_STATUS_ADAPTER_QDIOUP that took an early exit
    without a required lock being held. The problem occured when a
    special, non-SCSI I/O request was being submitted in process context,
    when the adapter's queues had been torn down. In this case the bug
    surfaced when the Fibre Channel port connection for a well-known address
    was closed during a concurrent adapter shut-down procedure, which is a
    rare constellation.
    
    This patch also fixes these warnings from the sparse tool (make C=1):
    
    drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_qdio.c:224:12: warning: context imbalance in
     'zfcp_qdio_sbal_check' - wrong count at exit
    drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_qdio.c:244:5: warning: context imbalance in
     'zfcp_qdio_sbal_get' - unexpected unlock
    
    Last but not least, we get rid of that crappy lock-unlock-lock
    sequence at the beginning of the critical section.
    
    It is okay to call zfcp_erp_adapter_reopen() with req_q_lock held.

    of: fdt: fix memory initialization for expanded DT
    
    commit 9e40127526e857fa3f29d51e83277204fbdfc6ba upstream.
    
    Already existing property flags are filled wrong for properties created from
    initial FDT. This could cause problems if this DYNAMIC device-tree functions
    are used later, i.e. properties are attached/detached/replaced. Simply dumping
    flags from the running system show, that some initial static (not allocated via
    kzmalloc()) nodes are marked as dynamic.
    
    I putted some debug extensions to property_proc_show(..) :
    ..
    +       if (OF_IS_DYNAMIC(pp))
    +               pr_err("DEBUG: xxx : OF_IS_DYNAMIC\n");
    +       if (OF_IS_DETACHED(pp))
    +               pr_err("DEBUG: xxx : OF_IS_DETACHED\n");
    
    when you operate on the nodes (e.g.: ~$ cat /proc/device-tree/*some_node*) you
    will see that those flags are filled wrong, basically in most cases it will dump
    a DYNAMIC or DETACHED status, which is in not true.
    (BTW. this OF_IS_DETACHED is a own define for debug purposes which which just
    make a test_bit(OF_DETACHED, &x->_flags)
    
    If nodes are dynamic kernel is allowed to kfree() them. But it will crash
    attempting to do so on the nodes from FDT -- they are not allocated via
    kzmalloc().

    sg: Fix user memory corruption when SG_IO is interrupted by a signal
    
    commit 35dc248383bbab0a7203fca4d722875bc81ef091 upstream.
    
    There is a nasty bug in the SCSI SG_IO ioctl that in some circumstances
    leads to one process writing data into the address space of some other
    random unrelated process if the ioctl is interrupted by a signal.
    What happens is the following:
    
     - A process issues an SG_IO ioctl with direction DXFER_FROM_DEV (ie the
       underlying SCSI command will transfer data from the SCSI device to
       the buffer provided in the ioctl)
    
     - Before the command finishes, a signal is sent to the process waiting
       in the ioctl.  This will end up waking up the sg_ioctl() code:
    
                    result = wait_event_interruptible(sfp->read_wait,
                            (srp_done(sfp, srp) || sdp->detached));
    
       but neither srp_done() nor sdp->detached is true, so we end up just
       setting srp->orphan and returning to userspace:
    
                    srp->orphan = 1;
                    write_unlock_irq(&sfp->rq_list_lock);
                    return result;  /* -ERESTARTSYS because signal hit process */
    
       At this point the original process is done with the ioctl and
       blithely goes ahead handling the signal, reissuing the ioctl, etc.
    
     - Eventually, the SCSI command issued by the first ioctl finishes and
       ends up in sg_rq_end_io().  At the end of that function, we run through:
    
            write_lock_irqsave(&sfp->rq_list_lock, iflags);
            if (unlikely(srp->orphan)) {
                    if (sfp->keep_orphan)
                            srp->sg_io_owned = 0;
                    else
                            done = 0;
            }
            srp->done = done;
            write_unlock_irqrestore(&sfp->rq_list_lock, iflags);
    
            if (likely(done)) {
                    /* Now wake up any sg_read() that is waiting for this
                     * packet.
                     */
                    wake_up_interruptible(&sfp->read_wait);
                    kill_fasync(&sfp->async_qp, SIGPOLL, POLL_IN);
                    kref_put(&sfp->f_ref, sg_remove_sfp);
            } else {
                    INIT_WORK(&srp->ew.work, sg_rq_end_io_usercontext);
                    schedule_work(&srp->ew.work);
            }
    
       Since srp->orphan *is* set, we set done to 0 (assuming the
       userspace app has not set keep_orphan via an SG_SET_KEEP_ORPHAN
       ioctl), and therefore we end up scheduling sg_rq_end_io_usercontext()
       to run in a workqueue.
    
     - In workqueue context we go through sg_rq_end_io_usercontext() ->
       sg_finish_rem_req() -> blk_rq_unmap_user() -> ... ->
       bio_uncopy_user() -> __bio_copy_iov() -> copy_to_user().
    
       The key point here is that we are doing copy_to_user() on a
       workqueue -- that is, we're on a kernel thread with current->mm
       equal to whatever random previous user process was scheduled before
       this kernel thread.  So we end up copying whatever data the SCSI
       command returned to the virtual address of the buffer passed into
       the original ioctl, but it's quite likely we do this copying into a
       different address space!
    
    As suggested by James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@hansenpartnership.com>,
    add a check for current->mm (which is NULL if we're on a kernel thread
    without a real userspace address space) in bio_uncopy_user(), and skip
    the copy if we're on a kernel thread.
    
    There's no reason that I can think of for any caller of bio_uncopy_user()
    to want to do copying on a kernel thread with a random active userspace
    address space.

    original pointer to this bug in the sg code.

    block: Add bio_for_each_segment_all()
    
    commit d74c6d514fe314b8bdab58b487b25992291577ec upstream.
    
    __bio_for_each_segment() iterates bvecs from the specified index
    instead of bio->bv_idx.  Currently, the only usage is to walk all the
    bvecs after the bio has been advanced by specifying 0 index.
    
    For immutable bvecs, we need to split these apart;
    bio_for_each_segment() is going to have a different implementation.
    This will also help document the intent of code that's using it -
    bio_for_each_segment_all() is only legal to use for code that owns the
    bio.

    xen/events: mask events when changing their VCPU binding
    
    commit 4704fe4f03a5ab27e3c36184af85d5000e0f8a48 upstream.
    
    When a event is being bound to a VCPU there is a window between the
    EVTCHNOP_bind_vpcu call and the adjustment of the local per-cpu masks
    where an event may be lost.  The hypervisor upcalls the new VCPU but
    the kernel thinks that event is still bound to the old VCPU and
    ignores it.
    
    There is even a problem when the event is being bound to the same VCPU
    as there is a small window beween the clear_bit() and set_bit() calls
    in bind_evtchn_to_cpu().  When scanning for pending events, the kernel
    may read the bit when it is momentarily clear and ignore the event.
    
    Avoid this by masking the event during the whole bind operation.

    xen/events: initialize local per-cpu mask for all possible events
    
    commit 84ca7a8e45dafb49cd5ca90a343ba033e2885c17 upstream.
    
    The sizeof() argument in init_evtchn_cpu_bindings() is incorrect
    resulting in only the first 64 (or 32 in 32-bit guests) ports having
    their bindings being initialized to VCPU 0.
    
    In most cases this does not cause a problem as request_irq() will set
    the irq affinity which will set the correct local per-cpu mask.
    However, if the request_irq() is called on a VCPU other than 0, there
    is a window between the unmasking of the event and the affinity being
    set were an event may be lost because it is not locally unmasked on
    any VCPU. If request_irq() is called on VCPU 0 then local irqs are
    disabled during the window and the race does not occur.
    
    Fix this by initializing all NR_EVENT_CHANNEL bits in the local
    per-cpu masks.

    drm/i915: Invalidate TLBs for the rings after a reset
    
    commit 884020bf3d2a3787a1cc6df902e98e0eec60330b upstream.
    
    After any "soft gfx reset" we must manually invalidate the TLBs
    associated with each ring. Empirically, it seems that a
    suspend/resume or D3-D0 cycle count as a "soft reset". The symptom is
    that the hardware would fail to note the new address for its status
    page, and so it would continue to write the shadow registers and
    breadcrumbs into the old physical address (now used by something
    completely different, scary). Whereas the driver would read the new
    status page and never see any progress, it would appear that the GPU
    hung immediately upon resume.

    m68k/atari: ARAnyM - Fix NatFeat module support
    
    commit e8184e10f89736a23ea6eea8e24cd524c5c513d2 upstream.
    
    As pointed out by Andreas Schwab, pointers passed to ARAnyM NatFeat calls
    should be physical addresses, not virtual addresses.
    
    Fortunately on Atari, physical and virtual kernel addresses are the same,
    as long as normal kernel memory is concerned, so this usually worked fine
    without conversion.
    
    But for modules, pointers to literal strings are located in vmalloc()ed
    memory. Depending on the version of ARAnyM, this causes the nf_get_id()
    call to just fail, or worse, crash ARAnyM itself with e.g.
    
        Gotcha! Illegal memory access. Atari PC = $968c
    
    This is a big issue for distro kernels, who want to have all drivers as
    loadable modules in an initrd.
    
    Add a wrapper for nf_get_id() that copies the literal to the stack to
    work around this issue.

    fs/proc/task_mmu.c: fix buffer overflow in add_page_map()
    
    commit 8c8296223f3abb142be8fc31711b18a704c0e7d8 upstream.
    
    Recently we met quite a lot of random kernel panic issues after enabling
    CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR.  After debuggind we found this has something
    to do with following bug in pagemap:
    
    In struct pagemapread:
    
      struct pagemapread {
          int pos, len;
          pagemap_entry_t *buffer;
          bool v2;
      };
    
    pos is number of PM_ENTRY_BYTES in buffer, but len is the size of
    buffer, it is a mistake to compare pos and len in add_page_map() for
    checking buffer is full or not, and this can lead to buffer overflow and
    random kernel panic issue.
    
    Correct len to be total number of PM_ENTRY_BYTES in buffer.

    ARM: 7809/1: perf: fix event validation for software group leaders
    
    commit c95eb3184ea1a3a2551df57190c81da695e2144b upstream.
    
    It is possible to construct an event group with a software event as a
    group leader and then subsequently add a hardware event to the group.
    This results in the event group being validated by adding all members
    of the group to a fake PMU and attempting to allocate each event on
    their respective PMU.
    
    Unfortunately, for software events wthout a corresponding arm_pmu, this
    results in a kernel crash attempting to dereference the ->get_event_idx
    function pointer.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by checking explicitly for software events
    and ignoring those in event validation (since they can always be
    scheduled). We will probably want to revisit this for 3.12, since the
    validation checks don't appear to work correctly when dealing with
    multiple hardware PMUs anyway.

    jbd2: Fix use after free after error in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata()
    
    commit 91aa11fae1cf8c2fd67be0609692ea9741cdcc43 upstream.
    
    When jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() returns error,
    __ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() stops the handle. However callers of this
    function do not count with that fact and still happily used now freed
    handle. This use after free can result in various issues but very likely
    we oops soon.
    
    The motivation of adding __ext4_journal_stop() into
    __ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() in commit 9ea7a0df seems to be only to
    improve error reporting. So replace __ext4_journal_stop() with
    ext4_journal_abort_handle() which was there before that commit and add
    WARN_ON_ONCE() to dump stack to provide useful information.

    ext4: fix mount/remount error messages for incompatible mount options
    
    commit 6ae6514b33f941d3386da0dfbe2942766eab1577 upstream.
    
    Commit 5688978 ("ext4: improve handling of conflicting mount options")
    introduced incorrect messages shown while choosing wrong mount options.
    
    First of all, both cases of incorrect mount options,
    "data=journal,delalloc" and "data=journal,dioread_nolock" result in
    the same error message.
    
    Secondly, the problem above isn't solved for remount option: the
    mismatched parameter is simply ignored.  Moreover, ext4_msg states
    that remount with options "data=journal,delalloc" succeeded, which is
    not true.
    
    To fix it up, I added a simple check after parse_options() call to
    ensure that data=journal and delalloc/dioread_nolock parameters are
    not present at the same time.

    hwmon: (adt7470) Fix incorrect return code check
    
    commit 93d783bcca69bfacc8dc739d8a050498402587b5 upstream.
    
    In adt7470_write_word_data(), which writes two bytes using
    i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(), the return codes are incorrectly AND-ed
    together when they should be OR-ed together.
    
    The return code of i2c_smbus_write_byte_data() is zero for success.
    
    The upshot is only the first byte was ever written to the hardware.
    The 2nd byte was never written out.
    
    I noticed that trying to set the fan speed limits was not working
    correctly on my system.  Setting the fan speed limits is the only
    code that uses adt7470_write_word_data().  After making the change
    the limit settings work and the alarms work also.

    cifs: don't instantiate new dentries in readdir for inodes that need to be revalidated immediately
    
    commit 757c4f6260febff982276818bb946df89c1105aa upstream.
    
    David reported that commit c2b93e06 (cifs: only set ops for inodes in
    I_NEW state) caused a regression with mfsymlinks. Prior to that patch,
    if a mfsymlink dentry was instantiated at readdir time, the inode would
    get a new set of ops when it was revalidated. After that patch, this
    did not occur.
    
    This patch addresses this by simply skipping instantiating dentries in
    the readdir codepath when we know that they will need to be immediately
    revalidated. The next attempt to use that dentry will cause a new lookup
    to occur (which is basically what we want to happen anyway).

    tracing: Fix fields of struct trace_iterator that are zeroed by mistake
    
    commit ed5467da0e369e65b247b99eb6403cb79172bcda upstream.
    
    tracing_read_pipe zeros all fields bellow "seq". The declaration contains
    a comment about that, but it doesn't help.
    
    The first field is "snapshot", it's true when current open file is
    snapshot. Looks obvious, that it should not be zeroed.
    
    The second field is "started". It was converted from cpumask_t to
    cpumask_var_t (v2.6.28-4983-g4462344), in other words it was
    converted from cpumask to pointer on cpumask.
    
    Currently the reference on "started" memory is lost after the first read
    from tracing_read_pipe and a proper object will never be freed.
    
    The "started" is never dereferenced for trace_pipe, because trace_pipe
    can't have the TRACE_FILE_ANNOTATE options.

    megaraid_sas: megaraid_sas driver init fails in kdump kernel
    
    commit 6431f5d7c6025f8b007af06ea090de308f7e6881 upstream.
    
    Problem: When Hardware IOMMU is on, megaraid_sas driver initialization fails
    in kdump kernel with LSI MegaRAID controller(device id-0x73).
    
    Actually this issue needs fix in firmware, but for firmware running in field,
    this driver fix is proposed to resolve the issue.  At firmware initialization
    time, if firmware does not come to ready state, driver will reset the adapter
    and retry for firmware transition to ready state unconditionally(not only
    executed for kdump kernel).

    iwlwifi: dvm: fix calling ieee80211_chswitch_done() with NULL
    
    commit 9186a1fd9ed190739423db84bc344d258ef3e3d7 upstream.
    
    If channel switch is pending and we remove interface we can
    crash like showed below due to passing NULL vif to mac80211:
    
    BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at fffffffffffff8cc
    IP: [<ffffffff8130924d>] strnlen+0xd/0x40

    This is because we nulify ctx->vif in iwlagn_mac_remove_interface()
    before calling some other functions that teardown interface. To fix
    just check ctx->vif on iwl_chswitch_done(). We should not call
    ieee80211_chswitch_done() as channel switch works were already canceled
    by mac80211 in ieee80211_do_stop() -> ieee80211_mgd_stop().

    cifs: extend the buffer length enought for sprintf() using
    
    commit 057d6332b24a4497c55a761c83c823eed9e3f23b upstream.
    
    For cifs_set_cifscreds() in "fs/cifs/connect.c", 'desc' buffer length
    is 'CIFSCREDS_DESC_SIZE' (56 is less than 256), and 'ses->domainName'
    length may be "255 + '\0'".
    
    The related sprintf() may cause memory overflow, so need extend related
    buffer enough to hold all things.
    
    It is also necessary to be sure of 'ses->domainName' must be less than
    256, and define the related macro instead of hard code number '256'.

    The ProcessAuxChannel table on some rv635 boards assumes
    the divmul members are initialized to 0 otherwise we get

    ACPI / battery: Fix parsing _BIX return value
    
    commit 016d5baad04269e8559332df05f89bd95b52d6ad upstream.
    
    The _BIX method returns extended battery info as a package.
    According the ACPI spec (ACPI 5, Section 10.2.2.2), the first member
    of that package should be "Revision".  However, the current ACPI
    battery driver treats the first member as "Power Unit" which should
    be the second member.  This causes the result of _BIX return data
    parsing to be incorrect.
    
    Fix this by adding a new member called 'revision' to struct
    acpi_battery and adding the offsetof() information on it to
    extended_info_offsets[] as the first row.

    rt2x00: fix stop queue
    
    commit e2288b66fe7ff0288382b2af671b4da558b44472 upstream.
    
    Since we clear QUEUE_STARTED in rt2x00queue_stop_queue(), following
    call to rt2x00queue_pause_queue() reduce to noop, i.e we do not
    stop queue in mac80211.
    
    To fix that introduce rt2x00queue_pause_queue_nocheck() function,
    which will stop queue in mac80211 directly.
    
    Note that rt2x00_start_queue() explicitly set QUEUE_PAUSED bit.
    
    Note also that reordering operations i.e. first call to
    rt2x00queue_pause_queue() and then clear QUEUE_STARTED bit, will race
    with rt2x00queue_unpause_queue(), so calling ieee80211_stop_queue()
    directly is the only available solution to fix the problem without
    major rework.

    virtio: console: return -ENODEV on all read operations after unplug
    
    commit 96f97a83910cdb9d89d127c5ee523f8fc040a804 upstream.
    
    If a port gets unplugged while a user is blocked on read(), -ENODEV is
    returned.  However, subsequent read()s returned 0, indicating there's no
    host-side connection (but not indicating the device went away).
    
    This also happened when a port was unplugged and the user didn't have
    any blocking operation pending.  If the user didn't monitor the SIGIO
    signal, they won't have a chance to find out if the port went away.
    
    Fix by returning -ENODEV on all read()s after the port gets unplugged.
    write() already behaves this way.

    SIGIO should be sent when a port gets unplugged.  It should only be sent
    to prcesses that have the port opened, and have asked for SIGIO to be

    send_sigio_to_port(), resulting in a sigio not getting sent to

    virtio: console: clean up port data immediately at time of unplug
    
    commit ea3768b4386a8d1790f4cc9a35de4f55b92d6442 upstream.
    
    We used to keep the port's char device structs and the /sys entries
    around till the last reference to the port was dropped.  This is
    actually unnecessary, and resulted in buggy behaviour:
    
    1. Open port in guest
    2. Hot-unplug port
    3. Hot-plug a port with the same 'name' property as the unplugged one
    
    This resulted in hot-plug being unsuccessful, as a port with the same
    name already exists (even though it was unplugged).
    
    This behaviour resulted in a warning message like this one:
    
    -------------------8<---------------------------------------

    -------------------8<---------------------------------------
    
    Instead of relying on guest applications to release all references to
    the ports, we should go ahead and unregister the port from all the core
    layers.  Any open/read calls on the port will then just return errors,
    and an unplug/plug operation on the host will succeed as expected.
    
    This also caused buggy behaviour in case of the device removal (not just
    a port): when the device was removed (which means all ports on that
    device are removed automatically as well), the ports with active
    users would clean up only when the last references were dropped -- and
    it would be too late then to be referencing char device pointers,
    resulting in oopses:

    So clean up when we have all the context, and all that's left to do when
    the references to the port have dropped is to free up the port struct
    itself.

    commit 671bdea2b9f210566610603ecbb6584c8a201c8c upstream.
    
    Between open() being called and processed, the port can be unplugged.
    Check if this happened, and bail out.
    
    A simple test script to reproduce this is:
    
    while true; do for i in $(seq 1 100); do echo $i > /dev/vport0p3; done; done;
    
    This opens and closes the port a lot of times; unplugging the port while
    this is happening triggers the bug.

    virtio: console: fix race with port unplug and open/close
    
    commit 057b82be3ca3d066478e43b162fc082930a746c9 upstream.
    
    There's a window between find_port_by_devt() returning a port and us
    taking a kref on the port, where the port could get unplugged.  Fix it
    by taking the reference in find_port_by_devt() itself.

    ixgbe: Fix Tx Hang issue with lldpad on 82598EB
    
    commit 1eb9ac14c34a948bf1538bfb9034e8ab29099a64 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue with the 82598EB device, where lldpad is causing Tx
    Hangs on the card as soon as it attempts to configure DCB for the device. The
    adapter will continually Tx hang and reset in a loop.

    serial/mxs-auart: increase time to wait for transmitter to become idle
    
    commit 079a036f4283e2b0e5c26080b8c5112bc0cc1831 upstream.
    
    Without this patch the driver waits ~1 ms for the UART to become idle. At
    115200n8 this time is (theoretically) enough to transfer 11.5 characters
    (= 115200 bits/s / (10 Bits/char) * 1ms). As the mxs-auart has a fifo size
    of 16 characters the clock is gated too early. The problem is worse for
    lower baud rates.
    
    This only happens to really shut down the transmitter in the middle of a
    transfer if /dev/ttyAPPx isn't opened in userspace (e.g. by a getty) but
    was at least once (because the bootloader doesn't disable the transmitter).
    
    So increase the timeout to 20 ms which should be enough for 9600n8, too.
    Moreover skip gating the clock if the timeout is elapsed.

    serial/mxs-auart: fix race condition in interrupt handler
    
    commit d970d7fe65adff5efe75b4a73c4ffc9be57089f7 upstream.
    
    The handler needs to ack the pending events before actually handling them.
    Otherwise a new event might come in after it it considered non-pending or
    handled and is acked then without being handled. So this event is only
    noticed when the next interrupt happens.
    
    Without this patch an i.MX28 based machine running an rt-patched kernel
    regularly hangs during boot.

    x86, fpu: correct the asm constraints for fxsave, unbreak mxcsr.daz
    
    commit eaa5a990191d204ba0f9d35dbe5505ec2cdd1460 upstream.
    
    GCC will optimize mxcsr_feature_mask_init in arch/x86/kernel/i387.c:
    
                    memset(&fx_scratch, 0, sizeof(struct i387_fxsave_struct));
                    asm volatile("fxsave %0" : : "m" (fx_scratch));
                    mask = fx_scratch.mxcsr_mask;
                    if (mask == 0)
                            mask = 0x0000ffbf;
    
    to
    
                    memset(&fx_scratch, 0, sizeof(struct i387_fxsave_struct));
                    asm volatile("fxsave %0" : : "m" (fx_scratch));
                    mask = 0x0000ffbf;
    
    since asm statement doesn’t say it will update fx_scratch.  As the
    result, the DAZ bit will be cleared.  This patch fixes it. This bug
    dates back to at least kernel 2.6.12.

    ARM: 7791/1: a.out: remove partial a.out support
    
    commit acfdd4b1f7590d02e9bae3b73bdbbc4a31b05d38 upstream.
    
    a.out support on ARM requires that argc, argv and envp are passed in
    r0-r2 respectively, which requires hacking load_aout_binary to
    prevent argc being clobbered by the return code. Whilst mainline kernels
    do set the registers up in start_thread, the aout loader has never
    carried the hack in mainline.
    
    Initialising the registers in this way actually goes against the libc
    expectations for ELF binaries, where argc, argv and envp are passed on
    the stack, with r0 being used to hold a pointer to an exit function for
    cleaning up after the dynamic linker if required. If the pointer is
    NULL, then it is ignored. When execing an ELF binary, Linux currently
    zeroes r0, then sets it to argc and then finally clobbers it with the
    return value of the execve syscall, so we actually end up with:
    
            r0 = 0
            stack[0] = argc
            r1 = stack[1] = argv
            r2 = stack[2] = envp
    
    libc treats r1 and r2 as undefined. The clobbering of r0 by sys_execve
    works for user-spawned threads, but when executing an ELF binary from a
    kernel thread (via call_usermodehelper), the execve is performed on the
    ret_from_fork path, which restores r0 from the saved pt_regs, resulting
    in argc being presented to the C library. This has horrible consequences
    when the application exits, since we have an exit function registered
    using argc, resulting in a jump to hyperspace.
    
    This patch solves the problem by removing the partial a.out support from
    arch/arm/ altogether.

    ath9k_htc: do some initial hardware configuration
    
    commit dc2a87f519a4d8cb376ab54f22b6b98a943b51ce upstream.
    
    Currently we configure harwdare and clock, only after
    interface start. In this case, if we reload module or
    reboot PC without configuring adapter, firmware will freeze.
    There is no software way to reset adpter.
    
    This patch add initial configuration and set it in
    disabled state, to avoid this freeze. Behaviour of this patch
    should be similar to: ifconfig wlan0 up; ifconfig wlan0 down.

    iwlwifi: dvm: don't send BT_CONFIG on devices w/o Bluetooth
    
    commit 707aee401d2467baa785a697f40a6e2d9ee79ad5 upstream.
    
    The BT_CONFIG command that is sent to the device during
    startup will enable BT coex unless the module parameter
    turns it off, but on devices without Bluetooth this may
    cause problems, as reported in Redhat BZ 885407.
    
    Fix this by sending the BT_CONFIG command only when the
    device has Bluetooth.

    mac80211: fix duplicate retransmission detection
    
    commit 6b0f32745dcfba01d7be33acd1b40306c7a914c6 upstream.
    
    The duplicate retransmission detection code in mac80211
    erroneously attempts to do the check for every frame,
    even frames that don't have a sequence control field or
    that don't use it (QoS-Null frames.)
    
    This is problematic because it causes the code to access
    data beyond the end of the SKB and depending on the data
    there will drop packets erroneously.
    
    Correct the code to not do duplicate detection for such
    frames.
    
    I found this error while testing AP powersave, it lead
    to retransmitted PS-Poll frames being dropped entirely
    as the data beyond the end of the SKB was always zero.

    These two events were sent to the default network

    This caused AP mode in a non-default netns to not

    vm: add no-mmu vm_iomap_memory() stub
    
    commit 3c0b9de6d37a481673e81001c57ca0e410c72346 upstream.
    
    I think we could just move the full vm_iomap_memory() function into
    util.h or similar, but I didn't get any reply from anybody actually
    using nommu even to this trivial patch, so I'm not going to touch it any
    more than required.
    
    Here's the fairly minimal stub to make the nommu case at least
    potentially work.  It doesn't seem like anybody cares, though.

    jfs: fix readdir cookie incompatibility with NFSv4
    
    commit 44512449c0ab368889dd13ae0031fba74ee7e1d2 upstream.
    
    NFSv4 reserves readdir cookie values 0-2 for special entries (. and ..),
    but jfs allows a value of 2 for a non-special entry. This incompatibility
    can result in the nfs client reporting a readdir loop.
    
    This patch doesn't change the value stored internally, but adds one to
    the value exposed to the iterate method.

    UAC2_EXTENSION_UNIT_V2 differs from UAC1_EXTENSION_UNIT, but can be handled in

    UAC2_EXTENSION_UNIT_V2 is outside the range allocated by UAC1.

    commit 5dae5fd24071319bb67d3375217d5b0b6d16cb0b upstream.
    
    Current code mishandles the case where the device is a UAC2
    and the bDescriptorSubtype is a UAC2 Effect Unit (0x07).
    It tries to parse it as a Processing Unit (which is similar to two
    other UAC1 units with overlapping subtypes), but since the structure
    is different (See: 4.7.2.10, 4.7.2.11 in UAC2 standard), the parsing
    is done incorrectly and prevents the device from initializing.
    For now, just ignore the unit.

    drm/i915/lvds: ditch ->prepare special case
    
    commit 520c41cf2fa029d1e8b923ac2026f96664f17c4b upstream.
    
    LVDS is the first output where dpms on/off and prepare/commit don't
    perfectly match. Now the idea behind this special case seems to be
    that for simple resolution changes on the LVDS we don't need to stop
    the pipe, because (at least on newer chips) we can adjust the panel
    fitter on the fly.
    
    There are a few problems with the current code though:
    - We still stop and restart the pipe unconditionally, because the crtc
      helper code isn't flexible enough.
    - We show some ugly flickering, especially when changing crtcs (this
      the crtc helper would actually take into account, but we don't
      implement the encoder->get_crtc callback required to make this work
      properly).
    
    So it doesn't even work as advertised. I agree that it would be nice
    to do resolution changes on LVDS (and also eDP) whithout blacking the
    screen where the panel fitter allows to do that. But imo we should
    implement this as a special case a few layers up in the mode set code,
    akin to how we already detect simple framebuffer changes (and only
    update the required registers with ->mode_set_base).
    
    Until this is all in place, make our lives easier and just rip it out.
    
    Also note that this seems to fix actual bugs with enabling the lvds
    output, see:

    usbnet: do not pretend to support SG/TSO
    
    [ Upstream commit 20f0170377264e8449b6987041f0bcc4d746d3ed ]
    
    usbnet doesn't support yet SG, so drivers should not advertise SG or TSO
    capabilities, as they allow TCP stack to build large TSO packets that
    need to be linearized and might use order-5 pages.
    
    This adds an extra copy overhead and possible allocation failures.
    
    Current code ignore skb_linearize() return code so crashes are even
    possible.
    
    Best is to not pretend SG/TSO is supported, and add this again when/if
    usbnet really supports SG for devices who could get a performance gain.

    sctp: fully initialize sctp_outq in sctp_outq_init
    
    [ Upstream commit c5c7774d7eb4397891edca9ebdf750ba90977a69 ]
    
    In commit 2f94aabd9f6c925d77aecb3ff020f1cc12ed8f86
    (refactor sctp_outq_teardown to insure proper re-initalization)
    we modified sctp_outq_teardown to use sctp_outq_init to fully re-initalize the
    outq structure.  Steve West recently asked me why I removed the q->error = 0
    initalization from sctp_outq_teardown.  I did so because I was operating under
    the impression that sctp_outq_init would properly initalize that value for us,
    but it doesn't.  sctp_outq_init operates under the assumption that the outq
    struct is all 0's (as it is when called from sctp_association_init), but using
    it in __sctp_outq_teardown violates that assumption. We should do a memset in
    sctp_outq_init to ensure that the entire structure is in a known state there
    instead.

    perf tools: Add anonymous huge page recognition
    
    commit d0528b5d71faf612014dd7672e44225c915344b2 upstream.
    
    Judging anonymous memory's vm_area_struct, perf_mmap_event's filename
    will be set to "//anon" indicating this vma belongs to anonymous
    memory.
    
    Once hugepage is used, vma's vm_file points to hugetlbfs. In this way,
    this vma will not be regarded as anonymous memory by is_anon_memory() in
    perf user space utility.

    perf: Fix event group context move
    
    commit 0231bb5336758426b44ccd798ccd3c5419c95d58 upstream.
    
    When we have group with mixed events (hw/sw) we want to end up
    with group leader being in hw context. So if group leader is
    initialy sw event, we move all the events under hw context.
    
    The move is done for each event by removing it from its context
    and adding it back into proper one. As a part of the removal the
    event is automatically disabled, which is not what we want at
    this stage of creating groups.
    
    The fix is to initialize event state after removal from sw
    context.
    
    This fix resulted from the following discussion:

    sched: Fix the broken sched_rr_get_interval()
    
    commit a59f4e079d19464eebb9b06513a1d4f55fdae5ba upstream.
    
    The caller of sched_sliced() should pass se.cfs_rq and se as the
    arguments, however in sched_rr_get_interval() we gave it
    rq.cfs_rq and se, which made the following computation obviously
    wrong.
    
    The change was introduced by commit:
    
      77034937dc45 sched: fix crash in sys_sched_rr_get_interval()
    
    ... 5 years ago, while it had been the correct 'cfs_rq_of' before
    the commit. The change seems to be irrelevant to the commit
    msg, which was to return a 0 timeslice for tasks that are on an
    idle runqueue. So I believe that was just a plain typo.

    commit bb9696192826a7d9279caf872e95b41bc26c7eff upstream.
    
    sata_inic162x never reached a state where it's reliable enough for
    production use and data corruption is a relatively common occurrence.
    Make the driver generate warning about the issues and mark the Kconfig
    option as experimental.
    
    If the situation doesn't improve, we'd be better off making it depend
    on CONFIG_BROKEN.  Let's wait for several cycles and see if the kernel
    message draws any attention.
