    sparc64: Implement __get_user_pages_fast().
    
    [ Upstream commit 06090e8ed89ea2113a236befb41f71d51f100e60 ]
    
    It is not sufficient to only implement get_user_pages_fast(), you
    must also implement the atomic version __get_user_pages_fast()
    otherwise you end up using the weak symbol fallback implementation
    which simply returns zero.
    
    This is dangerous, because it causes the futex code to loop forever
    if transparent hugepages are supported (see get_futex_key()).

    sparc64: Fix register corruption in top-most kernel stack frame during boot.
    
    [ Upstream commit ef3e035c3a9b81da8a778bc333d10637acf6c199 ]
    
    Meelis Roos reported that kernels built with gcc-4.9 do not boot, we
    eventually narrowed this down to only impacting machines using
    UltraSPARC-III and derivitive cpus.
    
    The crash happens right when the first user process is spawned:

    Further investigation showed that compiling only per_cpu_patch() with
    an older compiler fixes the boot.
    
    Detailed analysis showed that the function is not being miscompiled by
    gcc-4.9, but it is using a different register allocation ordering.
    
    With the gcc-4.9 compiled function, something during the code patching
    causes some of the %i* input registers to get corrupted.  Perhaps
    we have a TLB miss path into the firmware that is deep enough to
    cause a register window spill and subsequent restore when we get
    back from the TLB miss trap.
    
    Let's plug this up by doing two things:
    
    1) Stop using the firmware stack for client interface calls into
       the firmware.  Just use the kernel's stack.
    
    2) As soon as we can, call into a new function "start_early_boot()"
       to put a one-register-window buffer between the firmware's
       deepest stack frame and the top-most initial kernel one.

    [ Upstream commit d195b71bad4347d2df51072a537f922546a904f1 ]
    
    swapper_low_pmd_dir and swapper_pud_dir are actually completely
    useless and unnecessary.
    
    We just need swapper_pg_dir[].  Naturally the other page table chunks
    will be allocated on an as-needed basis.  Since the kernel actually
    accesses these tables in the PAGE_OFFSET view, there is not even a TLB
    locality advantage of placing them in the kernel image.
    
    Use the hard coded vmlinux.ld.S slot for swapper_pg_dir which is
    naturally page aligned.
    
    Increase MAX_BANKS to 1024 in order to handle heavily fragmented
    virtual guests.
    
    Even with this MAX_BANKS increase, the kernel is 20K+ smaller.

    sparc64: sparse irq
    
    [ Upstream commit ee6a9333fa58e11577c1b531b8e0f5ffc0fd6f50 ]
    
    This patch attempts to do a few things. The highlights are: 1) enable
    SPARSE_IRQ unconditionally, 2) kills off !SPARSE_IRQ code 3) allocates
    ivector_table at boot time and 4) default to cookie only VIRQ mechanism
    for supported firmware. The first firmware with cookie only support for
    me appears on T5. You can optionally force the HV firmware to not cookie
    only mode which is the sysino support.
    
    The sysino is a deprecated HV mechanism according to the most recent
    SPARC Virtual Machine Specification. HV_GRP_INTR is what controls the
    cookie/sysino firmware versioning.
    
    The history of this interface is:
    
    1) Major version 1.0 only supported sysino based interrupt interfaces.
    
    2) Major version 2.0 added cookie based VIRQs, however due to the fact
       that OSs were using the VIRQs without negoatiating major version
       2.0 (Linux and Solaris are both guilty), the VIRQs calls were
       allowed even with major version 1.0
    
       To complicate things even further, the VIRQ interfaces were only
       actually hooked up in the hypervisor for LDC interrupt sources.
       VIRQ calls on other device types would result in HV_EINVAL errors.
    
       So effectively, major version 2.0 is unusable.
    
    3) Major version 3.0 was created to signal use of VIRQs and the fact
       that the hypervisor has these calls hooked up for all interrupt
       sources, not just those for LDC devices.
    
    A new boot option is provided should cookie only HV support have issues.
    hvirq - this is the version for HV_GRP_INTR. This is related to HV API
    versioning.  The code attempts major=3 first by default. The option can
    be used to override this default.
    
    I've tested with SPARSE_IRQ on T5-8, M7-4 and T4-X and Jalap?no.

    In order to accomodate embedded per-cpu allocation with large numbers

    PERCPU: max_distance=0x380001c10000 too large for vmalloc space 0xff00000000
    
    So, once we select a value for PAGE_OFFSET, derive the size of the
    vmalloc region based upon that.

    sparc64: Fix physical memory management regressions with large max_phys_bits.
    
    [ Upstream commit 0dd5b7b09e13dae32869371e08e1048349fd040c ]
    
    If max_phys_bits needs to be > 43 (f.e. for T4 chips), things like
    DEBUG_PAGEALLOC stop working because the 3-level page tables only
    can cover up to 43 bits.
    
    Another problem is that when we increased MAX_PHYS_ADDRESS_BITS up to
    47, several statically allocated tables became enormous.
    
    Compounding this is that we will need to support up to 49 bits of
    physical addressing for M7 chips.
    
    The two tables in question are sparc64_valid_addr_bitmap and
    kpte_linear_bitmap.
    
    The first holds a bitmap, with 1 bit for each 4MB chunk of physical
    memory, indicating whether that chunk actually exists in the machine
    and is valid.
    
    The second table is a set of 2-bit values which tell how large of a
    mapping (4MB, 256MB, 2GB, 16GB, respectively) we can use at each 256MB
    chunk of ram in the system.
    
    These tables are huge and take up an enormous amount of the BSS
    section of the sparc64 kernel image.  Specifically, the
    sparc64_valid_addr_bitmap is 4MB, and the kpte_linear_bitmap is 128K.
    
    So let's solve the space wastage and the DEBUG_PAGEALLOC problem
    at the same time, by using the kernel page tables (as designed) to
    manage this information.
    
    We have to keep using large mappings when DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is disabled,
    and we do this by encoding huge PMDs and PUDs.
    
    On a T4-2 with 256GB of ram the kernel page table takes up 16K with
    DEBUG_PAGEALLOC disabled and 256MB with it enabled.  Furthermore, this
    memory is dynamically allocated at run time rather than coded
    statically into the kernel image.

    sparc64: Do not define thread fpregs save area as zero-length array.
    
    [ Upstream commit e2653143d7d79a49f1a961aeae1d82612838b12c ]
    
    This breaks the stack end corruption detection facility.
    
    What that facility does it write a magic value to "end_of_stack()"
    and checking to see if it gets overwritten.
    
    "end_of_stack()" is "task_thread_info(p) + 1", which for sparc64 is
    the beginning of the FPU register save area.
    
    So once the user uses the FPU, the magic value is overwritten and the
    debug checks trigger.
    
    Fix this by making the size explicit.
    
    Due to the size we use for the fpsaved[], gsr[], and xfsr[] arrays we
    are limited to 7 levels of FPU state saves.  So each FPU register set
    is 256 bytes, allocate 256 * 7 for the fpregs area.

    sparc64: Fix FPU register corruption with AES crypto offload.
    
    [ Upstream commit f4da3628dc7c32a59d1fb7116bb042e6f436d611 ]
    
    The AES loops in arch/sparc/crypto/aes_glue.c use a scheme where the
    key material is preloaded into the FPU registers, and then we loop
    over and over doing the crypt operation, reusing those pre-cooked key
    registers.
    
    There are intervening blkcipher*() calls between the crypt operation
    calls.  And those might perform memcpy() and thus also try to use the
    FPU.
    
    The sparc64 kernel FPU usage mechanism is designed to allow such
    recursive uses, but with a catch.
    
    There has to be a trap between the two FPU using threads of control.
    
    The mechanism works by, when the FPU is already in use by the kernel,
    allocating a slot for FPU saving at trap time.  Then if, within the
    trap handler, we try to use the FPU registers, the pre-trap FPU
    register state is saved into the slot.  Then at trap return time we
    notice this and restore the pre-trap FPU state.
    
    Over the long term there are various more involved ways we can make
    this work, but for a quick fix let's take advantage of the fact that
    the situation where this happens is very limited.
    
    All sparc64 chips that support the crypto instructiosn also are using
    the Niagara4 memcpy routine, and that routine only uses the FPU for
    large copies where we can't get the source aligned properly to a
    multiple of 8 bytes.
    
    We look to see if the FPU is already in use in this context, and if so
    we use the non-large copy path which only uses integer registers.
    
    Furthermore, we also limit this special logic to when we are doing

    sparc64: Fix lockdep warnings on reboot on Ultra-5
    
    [ Upstream commit bdcf81b658ebc4c2640c3c2c55c8b31c601b6996 ]
    
    Inconsistently, the raw_* IRQ routines do not interact with and update
    the irqflags tracing and lockdep state, whereas the raw_* spinlock
    interfaces do.
    
    This causes problems in p1275_cmd_direct() because we disable hardirqs
    by hand using raw_local_irq_restore() and then do a raw_spin_lock()
    which triggers a lockdep trace because the CPU's hw IRQ state doesn't
    match IRQ tracing's internal software copy of that state.
    
    The CPU's irqs are disabled, yet current->hardirqs_enabled is true.

    When we have to split up a flush request into multiple pieces
    (in order to avoid the firmware range) we don't specify the
    arguments in the right order for the second piece.
    
    Fix the order, or else we get hangs as the code tries to
    flush "a lot" of entries and we get lockups like this:

    is needed when certain versions of gcc optimizes around memset calls and assume

    sparc64: find_node adjustment
    
    [ Upstream commit 3dee9df54836d5f844f3d58281d3f3e6331b467f ]
    
    We have seen an issue with guest boot into LDOM that causes early boot failures
    because of no matching rules for node identitity of the memory. I analyzed this
    on my T4 and concluded there might not be a solution. I saw the issue in
    mainline too when booting into the control/primary domain - with guests
    configured.  Note, this could be a firmware bug on some older machines.
    
    I'll provide a full explanation of the issues below. Should we not find a
    matching BEST latency group for a real address (RA) then we will assume node 0.
    On the T4-2 here with the information provided I can't see an alternative.
    
    Technically the LDOM shown below should match the MBLOCK to the
    favorable latency group. However other factors must be considered too. Were
    the memory controllers configured "fine" grained interleave or "coarse"
    grain interleaved -  T4. Also should a "group" MD node be considered a NUMA
    node?
    
    There has to be at least one Machine Description (MD) "group" and hence one
    NUMA node. The group can have one or more latency groups (lg) - more than one
    memory controller. The current code chooses the smallest latency as the most
    favorable per group. The latency and lg information is in MLGROUP below.
    MBLOCK is the base and size of the RAs for the machine as fetched from OBP
    /memory "available" property. My machine has one MBLOCK but more would be
    possible - with holes?
    
    For a T4-2 the following information has been gathered:
    with LDOM guest
    MEMBLOCK configuration:
     memory size = 0x27f870000
     memory.cnt  = 0x3

    (note: "base" and "size" reported in "MBLOCK" encompass the "memory[X]" values)
    (note: (RA + offset) & mask = val is the formula to detect a match for the
    memory controller. should there be no match for find_node node, a return
    value of -1 resulted for the node - BAD)
    
    There is one group. It has these forward links
    MLGROUP[1]: node[545] latency[1f7e8] match[200000000] mask[200000000]

    sparc64: Fix corrupted thread fault code.
    
    [ Upstream commit 84bd6d8b9c0f06b3f188efb479c77e20f05e9a8a ]
    
    Every path that ends up at do_sparc64_fault() must install a valid
    FAULT_CODE_* bitmask in the per-thread fault code byte.
    
    Two paths leading to the label winfix_trampoline (which expects the
    FAULT_CODE_* mask in register %g4) were not doing so:
    
    1) For pre-hypervisor TLB protection violation traps, if we took
       the 'winfix_trampoline' path we wouldn't have %g4 initialized
       with the FAULT_CODE_* value yet.  Resulting in using the
       TLB_TAG_ACCESS register address value instead.
    
    2) In the TSB miss path, when we notice that we are going to use a
       hugepage mapping, but we haven't allocated the hugepage TSB yet, we
       still have to take the window fixup case into consideration and
       in that particular path we leave %g4 not setup properly.
    
    Errors on this sort were largely invisible previously, but after
    commit 4ccb9272892c33ef1c19a783cfa87103b30c2784 ("sparc64: sun4v TLB
    error power off events") we now have a fault_code mask bit
    (FAULT_CODE_BAD_RA) that triggers due to this bug.
    
    FAULT_CODE_BAD_RA triggers because this bit is set in TLB_TAG_ACCESS
    (see #1 above) and thus we get seemingly random bus errors triggered
    for user processes.

    [ Upstream commit 4ccb9272892c33ef1c19a783cfa87103b30c2784 ]
    
    We've witnessed a few TLB events causing the machine to power off because
    of prom_halt. In one case it was some nfs related area during rmmod. Another
    was an mmapper of /dev/mem. A more recent one is an ITLB issue with
    a bad pagesize which could be a hardware bug. Bugs happen but we should
    attempt to not power off the machine and/or hang it when possible.
    
    This is a DTLB error from an mmapper of /dev/mem:

    This is recent mainline for ITLB:

    Normally sun4v_itlb_error_report() and sun4v_dtlb_error_report() would call
    prom_halt() and drop us to OF command prompt "ok". This isn't the case for
    LDOMs and the machine powers off.
    
    For the HV reported error of HV_ENORADDR for HV HV_MMU_MAP_ADDR_TRAP we cause
    a SIGBUS error by qualifying it within do_sparc64_fault() for fault code mask
    of FAULT_CODE_BAD_RA. This is done when trap level (%tl) is less or equal
    one("1"). Otherwise, for %tl > 1,  we proceed eventually to die_if_kernel().
    
    The logic of this patch was partially inspired by David Miller's feedback.
    
    Power off of large sparc64 machines is painful. Plus die_if_kernel provides
    more context. A reset sequence isn't a brief period on large sparc64 but
    better than power-off/power-on sequence.

    ima: provide flag to identify new empty files
    
    commit b151d6b00bbb798c58f2f21305e7d43fa763f34f upstream.
    
    On ima_file_free(), newly created empty files are not labeled with
    an initial security.ima value, because the iversion did not change.
    Commit dff6efc "fs: fix iversion handling" introduced a change in
    iversion behavior.  To verify this change use the shell command:
    
      $ (exec >foo)
      $ getfattr -h -e hex -d -m security foo
    
    This patch defines the IMA_NEW_FILE flag.  The flag is initially
    set, when IMA detects that a new file is created, and subsequently
    checked on the ima_file_free() hook to set the initial security.ima
    value.

    powerpc/eeh: Clear frozen device state in time
    
    commit 22fca17924094113fe79c1db5135290e1a84ad4b upstream.
    
    The problem was reported by Carol: In the scenario of passing mlx4
    adapter to guest, EEH error could be recovered successfully. When
    returning the device back to host, the driver (mlx4_core.ko)
    couldn't be loaded successfully because of error number -5 (-EIO)
    returned from mlx4_get_ownership(), which hits offlined PCI device.
    The root cause is that we missed to put the affected devices into
    normal state on clearing PE isolated state right after PE reset.
    
    The patch fixes above issue by putting the affected devices to
    normal state when clearing PE isolated state in eeh_pe_state_clear().

    powerpc/iommu/ddw: Fix endianness
    
    commit 9410e0185e65394c0c6d046033904b53b97a9423 upstream.
    
    rtas_call() accepts and returns values in CPU endianness.
    The ddw_query_response and ddw_create_response structs members are
    defined and treated as BE but as they are passed to rtas_call() as
    (u32 *) and they get byteswapped automatically, the data is CPU-endian.
    This fixes ddw_query_response and ddw_create_response definitions and use.
    
    of_read_number() is designed to work with device tree cells - it assumes
    the input is big-endian and returns data in CPU-endian. However due
    to the ddw_create_response struct fix, create.addr_hi/lo are already
    CPU-endian so do not byteswap them.
    
    ddw_avail is a pointer to the "ibm,ddw-applicable" property which contains
    3 cells which are big-endian as it is a device tree. rtas_call() accepts
    a RTAS token in CPU-endian. This makes use of of_property_read_u32_array
    to byte swap and avoid the need for a number of be32_to_cpu calls.

    powerpc: Only set numa node information for present cpus at boottime
    
    commit bc3c4327c92b9ceb9a6356ec64d1b2ab2dc851f9 upstream.
    
    As Nish suggested, it makes more sense to init the numa node informatiion
    for present cpus at boottime, which could also avoid WARN_ON(1) in
    numa_setup_cpu().
    
    With this change, we also need to change the smp_prepare_cpus() to set up
    numa information only on present cpus.
    
    For those possible, but not present cpus, their numa information
    will be set up after they are started, as the original code did before commit
    2fabf084b6ad.

    powerpc: Fix warning reported by verify_cpu_node_mapping()
    
    commit 70ad237515d99595ed03848bd8e549e50e83c4f2 upstream.
    
    With commit 2fabf084b6ad ("powerpc: reorder per-cpu NUMA information's
    initialization"), during boottime, cpu_numa_callback() is called
    earlier(before their online) for each cpu, and verify_cpu_node_mapping()
    uses cpu_to_node() to check whether siblings are in the same node.
    
    It skips the checking for siblings that are not online yet. So the only
    check done here is for the bootcpu, which is online at that time. But
    the per-cpu numa_node cpu_to_node() uses hasn't been set up yet (which
    will be set up in smp_prepare_cpus()).
    
    So I saw something like following reported:
    [    0.000000] CPU thread siblings 1/2/3 and 0 don't belong to the same
    node!
    
    As we don't actually do the checking during this early stage, so maybe
    we could directly call numa_setup_cpu() in do_init_bootmem().

    futex: Ensure get_futex_key_refs() always implies a barrier
    
    commit 76835b0ebf8a7fe85beb03c75121419a7dec52f0 upstream.
    
    Commit b0c29f79ecea (futexes: Avoid taking the hb->lock if there's
    nothing to wake up) changes the futex code to avoid taking a lock when
    there are no waiters. This code has been subsequently fixed in commit
    11d4616bd07f (futex: revert back to the explicit waiter counting code).
    Both the original commit and the fix-up rely on get_futex_key_refs() to
    always imply a barrier.
    
    However, for private futexes, none of the cases in the switch statement
    of get_futex_key_refs() would be hit and the function completes without
    a memory barrier as required before checking the "waiters" in
    futex_wake() -> hb_waiters_pending(). The consequence is a race with a
    thread waiting on a futex on another CPU, allowing the waker thread to
    read "waiters == 0" while the waiter thread to have read "futex_val ==
    locked" (in kernel).
    
    Without this fix, the problem (user space deadlocks) can be seen with
    Android bionic's mutex implementation on an arm64 multi-cluster system.

    mm/balloon_compaction: redesign ballooned pages management
    
    commit d6d86c0a7f8ddc5b38cf089222cb1d9540762dc2 upstream.
    
    Sasha Levin reported KASAN splash inside isolate_migratepages_range().
    Problem is in the function __is_movable_balloon_page() which tests
    AS_BALLOON_MAP in page->mapping->flags.  This function has no protection
    against anonymous pages.  As result it tried to check address space flags
    inside struct anon_vma.
    
    Further investigation shows more problems in current implementation:
    
    * Special branch in __unmap_and_move() never works:
      balloon_page_movable() checks page flags and page_count.  In
      __unmap_and_move() page is locked, reference counter is elevated, thus
      balloon_page_movable() always fails.  As a result execution goes to the
      normal migration path.  virtballoon_migratepage() returns
      MIGRATEPAGE_BALLOON_SUCCESS instead of MIGRATEPAGE_SUCCESS,
      move_to_new_page() thinks this is an error code and assigns
      newpage->mapping to NULL.  Newly migrated page lose connectivity with
      balloon an all ability for further migration.
    
    * lru_lock erroneously required in isolate_migratepages_range() for
      isolation ballooned page.  This function releases lru_lock periodically,
      this makes migration mostly impossible for some pages.
    
    * balloon_page_dequeue have a tight race with balloon_page_isolate:
      balloon_page_isolate could be executed in parallel with dequeue between
      picking page from list and locking page_lock.  Race is rare because they
      use trylock_page() for locking.
    
    This patch fixes all of them.
    
    Instead of fake mapping with special flag this patch uses special state of
    page->_mapcount: PAGE_BALLOON_MAPCOUNT_VALUE = -256.  Buddy allocator uses
    PAGE_BUDDY_MAPCOUNT_VALUE = -128 for similar purpose.  Storing mark
    directly in struct page makes everything safer and easier.
    
    PagePrivate is used to mark pages present in page list (i.e.  not
    isolated, like PageLRU for normal pages).  It replaces special rules for
    reference counter and makes balloon migration similar to migration of
    normal pages.  This flag is protected by page_lock together with link to
    the balloon device.

    mm/cma: fix cma bitmap aligned mask computing
    
    commit 68faed630fc151a7a1c4853df00fb3dcacf782b4 upstream.
    
    The current cma bitmap aligned mask computation is incorrect.  It could
    cause an unexpected alignment when using cma_alloc() if the wanted align
    order is larger than cma->order_per_bit.
    
    Take kvm for example (PAGE_SHIFT = 12), kvm_cma->order_per_bit is set to
    6.  When kvm_alloc_rma() tries to alloc kvm_rma_pages, it will use 15 as
    the expected align value.  After using the current implementation however,
    we get 0 as cma bitmap aligned mask other than 511.
    
    This patch fixes the cma bitmap aligned mask calculation.

    fanotify: enable close-on-exec on events' fd when requested in fanotify_init()
    
    commit 0b37e097a648aa71d4db1ad108001e95b69a2da4 upstream.
    
    According to commit 80af258867648 ("fanotify: groups can specify their
    f_flags for new fd"), file descriptors created as part of file access
    notification events inherit flags from the event_f_flags argument passed
    to syscall fanotify_init(2)[1].
    
    Unfortunately O_CLOEXEC is currently silently ignored.
    
    Indeed, event_f_flags are only given to dentry_open(), which only seems to
    care about O_ACCMODE and O_PATH in do_dentry_open(), O_DIRECT in
    open_check_o_direct() and O_LARGEFILE in generic_file_open().
    
    It's a pity, since, according to some lookup on various search engines and
    http://codesearch.debian.net/, there's already some userspace code which
    use O_CLOEXEC:
    
    - in systemd's readahead[2]:
    
        fanotify_fd = fanotify_init(FAN_CLOEXEC|FAN_NONBLOCK, O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE|O_CLOEXEC|O_NOATIME);
    
    - in clsync[3]:
    
        #define FANOTIFY_EVFLAGS (O_LARGEFILE|O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC)
    
        int fanotify_d = fanotify_init(FANOTIFY_FLAGS, FANOTIFY_EVFLAGS);
    
    - in examples [4] from "Filesystem monitoring in the Linux
      kernel" article[5] by Aleksander Morgado:
    
        if ((fanotify_fd = fanotify_init (FAN_CLOEXEC,
                                          O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC | O_LARGEFILE)) < 0)
    
    Additionally, since commit 48149e9d3a7e ("fanotify: check file flags
    passed in fanotify_init").  having O_CLOEXEC as part of fanotify_init()
    second argument is expressly allowed.
    
    So it seems expected to set close-on-exec flag on the file descriptors if
    userspace is allowed to request it with O_CLOEXEC.
    
    But Andrew Morton raised[6] the concern that enabling now close-on-exec
    might break existing applications which ask for O_CLOEXEC but expect the
    file descriptor to be inherited across exec().
    
    In the other hand, as reported by Mihai Dontu[7] close-on-exec on the file
    descriptor returned as part of file access notify can break applications
    due to deadlock.  So close-on-exec is needed for most applications.
    
    More, applications asking for close-on-exec are likely expecting it to be
    enabled, relying on O_CLOEXEC being effective.  If not, it might weaken
    their security, as noted by Jan Kara[8].
    
    So this patch replaces call to macro get_unused_fd() by a call to function
    get_unused_fd_flags() with event_f_flags value as argument.  This way
    O_CLOEXEC flag in the second argument of fanotify_init(2) syscall is
    interpreted and close-on-exec get enabled when requested.

    mm: clear __GFP_FS when PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO is set
    
    commit 934f3072c17cc8886f4c043b47eeeb1b12f8de33 upstream.
    
    commit 21caf2fc1931 ("mm: teach mm by current context info to not do I/O
    during memory allocation") introduces PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag to avoid doing
    I/O inside memory allocation, __GFP_IO is cleared when this flag is set,
    but __GFP_FS implies __GFP_IO, it should also be cleared.  Or it may still
    run into I/O, like in superblock shrinker.  And this will make the kernel
    run into the deadlock case described in that commit.
    
    See Dave Chinner's comment about io in superblock shrinker:
    
    Filesystem shrinkers do indeed perform IO from the superblock shrinker and
    have for years.  Even clean inodes can require IO before they can be freed
    - e.g.  on an orphan list, need truncation of post-eof blocks, need to
    wait for ordered operations to complete before it can be freed, etc.
    
    IOWs, Ext4, btrfs and XFS all can issue and/or block on arbitrary amounts
    of IO in the superblock shrinker context.  XFS, in particular, has been
    doing transactions and IO from the VFS inode cache shrinker since it was
    first introduced....
    
    Fix this by clearing __GFP_FS in memalloc_noio_flags(), this function has
    masked all the gfp_mask that will be passed into fs for the processes
    setting PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO in the direct reclaim path.

    Bluetooth: Fix setting correct security level when initiating SMP
    
    commit 5eb596f55cacc2389554a8d7572d90d5e9d4269d upstream.
    
    We can only determine the final security level when both pairing request
    and response have been exchanged. When initiating pairing the starting
    target security level is set to MEDIUM unless explicitly specified to be
    HIGH, so that we can still perform pairing even if the remote doesn't
    have MITM capabilities. However, once we've received the pairing
    response we should re-consult the remote and local IO capabilities and
    upgrade the target security level if necessary.
    
    Without this patch the resulting Long Term Key will occasionally be
    reported to be unauthenticated when it in reality is an authenticated
    one.

    Bluetooth: Fix incorrect LE CoC PDU length restriction based on HCI MTU
    
    commit 72c6fb915ff2d30ae14053edee4f0d30019bad76 upstream.
    
    The l2cap_create_le_flowctl_pdu() function that l2cap_segment_le_sdu()
    calls is perfectly capable of doing packet fragmentation if given bigger
    PDUs than the HCI buffers allow. Forcing the PDU length based on the HCI
    MTU (conn->mtu) would therefore needlessly strict operation on hardware
    with limited LE buffers (e.g. both Intel and Broadcom seem to have this
    set to just 27 bytes).
    
    This patch removes the restriction and makes it possible to send PDUs of
    the full length that the remote MPS value allows.

    Bluetooth: Fix HCI H5 corrupted ack value
    
    commit 4807b51895dce8aa650ebebc51fa4a795ed6b8b8 upstream.
    
    In this expression: seq = (seq - 1) % 8
    seq (u8) is implicitly converted to an int in the arithmetic operation.
    So if seq value is 0, operation is ((0 - 1) % 8) => (-1 % 8) => -1.
    The new seq value is 0xff which is an invalid ACK value, we expect 0x07.
    It leads to frequent dropped ACK and retransmission.

    PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface class
    
    commit 89ec3dcf17fd3fa009ecf8faaba36828dd6bc416 upstream.
    
    Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
    automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
    is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.
    
    The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
    r3.0, Appendix D.  Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
    alpha characters, so they won't be affected.  For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
    20h, etc. are unaffected.
    
    Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
    already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.

    PCI: Increase IBM ipr SAS Crocodile BARs to at least system page size
    
    commit 9fe373f9997b48fcd6222b95baf4a20c134b587a upstream.
    
    The Crocodile chip occasionally comes up with 4k and 8k BAR sizes.  Due to
    an erratum, setting the SR-IOV page size causes the physical function BARs
    to expand to the system page size.  Since ppc64 uses 64k pages, when Linux
    tries to assign the smaller resource sizes to the now 64k BARs the address
    will be truncated and the BARs will overlap.
    
    Force Linux to allocate the resource as a full page, which avoids the
    overlap.

    PCI: mvebu: Fix uninitialized variable in mvebu_get_tgt_attr()
    
    commit 56fab6e189441d714a2bfc8a64f3df9c0749dff7 upstream.
    
    Geert Uytterhoeven reported a warning when building pci-mvebu:
    
      drivers/pci/host/pci-mvebu.c: In function 'mvebu_get_tgt_attr':
      drivers/pci/host/pci-mvebu.c:887:39: warning: 'rtype' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
         if (slot == PCI_SLOT(devfn) && type == rtype) {
                                             ^
    
    And indeed, the code of mvebu_get_tgt_attr() may lead to the usage of rtype
    when being uninitialized, even though it would only happen if we had
    entries other than I/O space and 32 bits memory space.
    
    This commit fixes that by simply skipping the current DT range being
    considered, if it doesn't match the resource type we're looking for.

    xfs: fix agno increment in xfs_inumbers() loop
    
    commit a8b1ee8bafc765ebf029d03c5479a69aebff9693 upstream.
    
    caused a regression in xfs_inumbers, which in turn broke
    xfsdump, causing incomplete dumps.
    
    The loop in xfs_inumbers() needs to fill the user-supplied
    buffers, and iterates via xfs_btree_increment, reading new
    ags as needed.
    
    But the first time through the loop, if xfs_btree_increment()
    succeeds, we continue, which triggers the ++agno at the bottom
    of the loop, and we skip to soon to the next ag - without
    the proper setup under next_ag to read the next ag.
    
    Fix this by removing the agno increment from the loop conditional,
    and only increment agno if we have actually hit the code under
    the next_ag: target.

    xfs: ensure WB_SYNC_ALL writeback handles partial pages correctly
    
    commit 0d085a529b427d97710e6a41f8a4f23e1757cd12 upstream.
    
    XFS has been having trouble with stray delayed allocation extents
    beyond EOF for a long time. Recent changes to the collapse range
    code has triggered erroneous EBUSY errors on page invalidtion for
    block size smaller than page size filesystems. These
    have been caused by dirty buffers beyond EOF on a partial page which
    do not get written to disk during a sync.
    
    The issue is that write-ahead in xfs_cluster_write() finds such a
    partial page and handles it by leaving the page dirty but pushing it
    into a writeback state. This used to work just fine, as the
    write_cache_pages() code would then find the dirty partial page in
    the next mapping tree lookup as the dirty tag is still set.
    
    Unfortunately, when we moved to a mark and sweep approach to
    writeback to fix other writeback sync issues, we broken this. THe
    act of marking the page as under writeback now clears the TOWRITE
    tag in the radix tree, even though the page is still dirty. This
    causes the TOWRITE tag to be cleared, and hence the next lookup on
    the mapping tree does not find the dirty partial page and so doesn't
    try to write it again.
    
    This same writeback bug was found recently in ext4 and fixed in
    commit 1c8349a ("ext4: fix data integrity sync in ordered mode")

    vfio-pci: Fix remove path locking
    
    commit 93899a679fd6b2534b5c297d9316bae039ebcbe1 upstream.
    
    Locking both the remove() and release() path results in a deadlock
    that should have been obvious.  To fix this we can get and hold the
    vfio_device reference as we evaluate whether to do a bus/slot reset.
    This will automatically block any remove() calls, allowing us to
    remove the explict lock.  Fixes 61d792562b53.

    udf: Fix loading of special inodes
    
    commit 6174c2eb8ecef271159bdcde460ce8af54d8f72f upstream.
    
    Some UDF media have special inodes (like VAT or metadata partition
    inodes) whose link_count is 0. Thus commit 4071b9136223 (udf: Properly
    detect stale inodes) broke loading these inodes because udf_iget()
    started returning -ESTALE for them. Since we still need to properly
    detect stale inodes queried by NFS, create two variants of udf_iget() -
    one which is used for looking up special inodes (which ignores
    link_count == 0) and one which is used for other cases which return
    ESTALE when link_count == 0.

    If we create a file when we mount with ecryptfs_xattr_metadata option, we will

              ->fsstack_copy_attr_all
    It's because our dentry->d_inode used in fsstack_copy_attr_all is NULL, and it
    will be initialized when ecryptfs_initialize_file finish.
    
    So we should skip copying attr from lower inode when the value of ->d_inode is
    invalid.

    Commit 78b81f4666fb ("ARM: dts: imx28-evk: Run I2C0 at 400kHz") caused issues
    when doing the following sequence in loop:
    
    - Boot the kernel
    - Perform audio playback
    - Reboot the system via 'reboot' command
    
    In many times the audio card cannot be probed, which causes playback to fail.
    
    After restoring to the original i2c0 frequency of 100kHz there is no such
    problem anymore.

    ARM: mvebu: Netgear RN102: Use Hardware BCH ECC
    
    commit ace8578182dc347b043c0825b9873f62fdaa5b77 upstream.
    
    The bootloader on the Netgear ReadyNAS RN102 uses Hardware BCH ECC
    (strength = 4), while the pxa3xx NAND driver by default uses
    Hamming ECC (strength = 1).
    
    This patch changes the ECC mode on these machines to match that
    of the bootloader and of the stock firmware. That way, it is
    now possible to update the kernel from userland (e.g. using
    standard tools from mtd-utils package); u-boot will happily
    load and boot it.

    During the conversion of boards to use DT to instantiate Distributed

    the conversion was flawed. Testers and access to hardware has now
    become available, and this patch hopefully fixes the problems.

    specific subnode of the mdio device.
    
    dsa,ethernet must be a phandle to the port subnode within the ethernet
    DT node, not the ethernet node.
    
    Don't pinctrl hog the card detect gpio for mvsdio.

    stepping and which for the A0 or later stepping.

    commit b65e0fb3d046cc65d0a3c45d43de351fb363271b upstream.
    
    As discovered on a custom board similar to at91sam9263ek and basing
    its devicetree on that one apparently the pin muxing doesn't get
    set up properly. This was discovered since the custom boards u-boot
    does funky stuff with the pin muxing and leaved it set to SPI
    which made the MMC driver not work under Linux.
    The fix is simply to define the given configuration as the default.
    This probably worked by pure luck before, but it's better to
    make the muxing explicitly set.

    ALSA: hda - hdmi: Fix missing ELD change event on plug/unplug
    
    commit 6acce400d9daf1353fbf497302670c90a3205e1d upstream.
    
    The ELD ALSA control change event is sent by hdmi_present_sense() when
    eld_changed is true.
    
    Currently, it is only true when the ELD buffer contents have been
    modified. However, the user-visible ELD controls also change to a
    zero-length value and back when eld_valid is unset/set, and no event is
    currently sent in such cases (such as when unplugging or replugging a
    sink).
    
    Fix the code to always set eld_changed if eld_valid value is changed,
    and therefore to always send the change event when the user-visible
    value changes.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for Steinberg UR22 USB interface
    
    commit f0b127fbfdc8756eba7437ab668f3169280bd358 upstream.
    
    Adding support for Steinberg UR22 USB interface via quirks table patch
    
    See Ubuntu bug report:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1317244
    Also see threads:
    http://linux-audio.4202.n7.nabble.com/Support-for-Steinberg-UR22-Yamaha-USB-chipset-0499-1509-tc82888.html#a82917
    http://www.steinberg.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=62290
    
    Tested by at least 4 people judging by the threads.
    Did not test MIDI interface, but audio output and capture both are
    functional. Built 3.17 kernel with this driver on Ubuntu 14.04 & tested with mpg123
    Patch applied to 3.13 Ubuntu kernel works well enough for daily use.

    ALSA: emu10k1: Fix deadlock in synth voice lookup
    
    commit 95926035b187cc9fee6fb61385b7da9c28123f74 upstream.
    
    The emu10k1 voice allocator takes voice_lock spinlock.  When there is
    no empty stream available, it tries to release a voice used by synth,
    and calls get_synth_voice.  The callback function,
    snd_emu10k1_synth_get_voice(), however, also takes the voice_lock,
    thus it deadlocks.
    
    The fix is simply removing the voice_lock holds in
    snd_emu10k1_synth_get_voice(), as this is always called in the
    spinlock context.

    ALSA: bebob: Fix failure to detect source of clock for Terratec Phase 88
    
    commit 3f4032861cfbff0b9134bf94c5c92e2146d1f068 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a failure to open PCM device with -ENOSYS in
    Terratec Phase 88.
    
    Terratec Phase 88 has two Selector Function Blocks of AVC Audio subunit
    to switch source of clock. One is to switch internal/external for the
    source and another is to switch word/spdif for the external clock.
    
    The IDs for these Selector Function Blocks are 9 and 8. But in current
    implementation they're 0 and 0.

    commit 971a5b6fe634bb7b617d8c5f25b6a3ddbc600194 upstream.
    
    The compat_elf_prpsinfo structure does not match the arch/arm struct
    elf_pspsinfo definition. As result NT_PRPSINFO note in core file
    created by arm64 kernel for aarch32 (compat) process has wrong size.
    So gdb cannot display command that caused process crash.
    
    Fix is to change size of __compat_uid_t, __compat_gid_t so it would
    match size of similar fields in arch/arm case.

    NFSv4.1/pnfs: replace broken pnfs_put_lseg_async
    
    commit 6543f803670530f6aa93790d9fa116d8395a537d upstream.
    
    You cannot call pnfs_put_lseg_async() more than once per lseg, so it
    is really an inappropriate way to deal with a refcount issue.
    
    Instead, replace it with a function that decrements the refcount, and
    puts the final 'free' operation (which is incompatible with locks) on
    the workqueue.

    nfsd4: reserve adequate space for LOCK op
    
    commit f7b43d0c992c3ec3e8d9285c3fb5e1e0eb0d031a upstream.
    
    As of  8c7424cff6 "nfsd4: don't try to encode conflicting owner if low
    on space", we permit the server to process a LOCK operation even if
    there might not be space to return the conflicting lockowner, because
    we've made returning the conflicting lockowner optional.
    
    However, the rpc server still wants to know the most we might possibly
    return, so we need to take into account the possible conflicting
    lockowner in the svc_reserve_space() call here.
    
    Symptoms were log messages like "RPC request reserved 88 but used 108".

    NFSv4.1: Fix an NFSv4.1 state renewal regression
    
    commit d1f456b0b9545f1606a54cd17c20775f159bd2ce upstream.
    
    Commit 2f60ea6b8ced ("NFSv4: The NFSv4.0 client must send RENEW calls if it holds a delegation") set the NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag in nfs4_renew_state, and does
    not put an nfs41_proc_async_sequence call, the NFSv4.1 lease renewal heartbeat
    call, on the wire to renew the NFSv4.1 state if the flag was not set.
    
    The NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag is set when "now" is after the last renewal
    (cl_last_renewal) plus the lease time divided by 3. This is arbitrary and
    sometimes does the following:
    
    In normal operation, the only way a future state renewal call is put on the
    wire is via a call to nfs4_schedule_state_renewal, which schedules a
    nfs4_renew_state workqueue task. nfs4_renew_state determines if the
    NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT should be set, and the calls nfs41_proc_async_sequence,
    which only gets sent if the NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag is set.
    Then the nfs41_proc_async_sequence rpc_release function schedules
    another state remewal via nfs4_schedule_state_renewal.
    
    Without this change we can get into a state where an application stops
    accessing the NFSv4.1 share, state renewal calls stop due to the
    NFS4_RENEW_TIMEOUT flag _not_ being set. The only way to recover
    from this situation is with a clientid re-establishment, once the application
    resumes and the server has timed out the lease and so returns
    NFS4ERR_BAD_SESSION on the subsequent SEQUENCE operation.
    
    An example application:
    open, lock, write a file.
    
    sleep for 6 * lease (could be less)
    
    ulock, close.
    
    In the above example with NFSv4.1 delegations enabled, without this change,
    there are no OP_SEQUENCE state renewal calls during the sleep, and the
    clientid is recovered due to lease expiration on the close.
    
    This issue does not occur with NFSv4.1 delegations disabled, nor with
    NFSv4.0, with or without delegations enabled.

    NFSv4: fix open/lock state recovery error handling
    
    commit df817ba35736db2d62b07de6f050a4db53492ad8 upstream.
    
    The current open/lock state recovery unfortunately does not handle errors
    such as NFS4ERR_CONN_NOT_BOUND_TO_SESSION correctly. Instead of looping,
    just proceeds as if the state manager is finished recovering.
    This patch ensures that we loop back, handle higher priority errors
    and complete the open/lock state recovery.

    NFSv4: Fix lock recovery when CREATE_SESSION/SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM fails
    
    commit a4339b7b686b4acc8b6de2b07d7bacbe3ae44b83 upstream.
    
    If a NFSv4.x server returns NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID in response to a
    CREATE_SESSION or SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM in order to tell us that it rebooted
    a second time, then the client will currently take this to mean that it must
    declare all locks to be stale, and hence ineligible for reboot recovery.
    
    RFC3530 and RFC5661 both suggest that the client should instead rely on the
    server to respond to inelegible open share, lock and delegation reclaim
    requests with NFS4ERR_NO_GRACE in this situation.

    tty: omap-serial: fix division by zero
    
    commit dc3187564e61260f49eceb21a4e7eb5e4428e90a upstream.
    
    If the chosen baud rate is large enough (e.g. 3.5 megabaud), the
    calculated n values in serial_omap_is_baud_mode16() may become 0. This
    causes a division by zero when calculating the difference between
    calculated and desired baud rates. To prevent this, cap the n13 and n16
    values on 1.

    lzo: check for length overrun in variable length encoding.
    
    commit 72cf90124e87d975d0b2114d930808c58b4c05e4 upstream.
    
    This fix ensures that we never meet an integer overflow while adding
    255 while parsing a variable length encoding. It works differently from
    commit 206a81c ("lzo: properly check for overruns") because instead of
    ensuring that we don't overrun the input, which is tricky to guarantee
    due to many assumptions in the code, it simply checks that the cumulated
    number of 255 read cannot overflow by bounding this number.
    
    The MAX_255_COUNT is the maximum number of times we can add 255 to a base
    count without overflowing an integer. The multiply will overflow when
    multiplying 255 by more than MAXINT/255. The sum will overflow earlier
    depending on the base count. Since the base count is taken from a u8
    and a few bits, it is safe to assume that it will always be lower than
    or equal to 2*255, thus we can always prevent any overflow by accepting
    two less 255 steps.
    
    This patch also reduces the CPU overhead and actually increases performance
    by 1.1% compared to the initial code, while the previous fix costs 3.1%
    (measured on x86_64).
    
    The fix needs to be backported to all currently supported stable kernels.

    Commit c9fdeb28 removed a 'continue' after checking if the lease needs
    to be renewed. However, if client hasn't moved, the code falls down to
    starting reboot recovery erroneously (ie., sends open reclaim and gets
    back stale_clientid error) before recovering from getting stale_clientid
    on the renew operation.

    m68k: Disable/restore interrupts in hwreg_present()/hwreg_write()
    
    commit e4dc601bf99ccd1c95b7e6eef1d3cf3c4b0d4961 upstream.
    
    hwreg_present() and hwreg_write() temporarily change the VBR register to
    another vector table. This table contains a valid bus error handler
    only, all other entries point to arbitrary addresses.
    
    If an interrupt comes in while the temporary table is active, the
    processor will start executing at such an arbitrary address, and the
    kernel will crash.
    
    While most callers run early, before interrupts are enabled, or
    explicitly disable interrupts, Finn Thain pointed out that macsonic has
    one callsite that doesn't, causing intermittent boot crashes.
    There's another unsafe callsite in hilkbd.
    
    Fix this for good by disabling and restoring interrupts inside
    hwreg_present() and hwreg_write().
    
    Explicitly disabling interrupts can be removed from the callsites later.

    commit b29ef3546aecb253a5552b198cef23750d56e1e4 upstream.
    
    Minimize failures in this function by pre-allocating the buffer
    for posting messages. The hypercall for posting the message can fail
    for a number of reasons:
    
            1. Transient resource related issues
            2. Buffer alignment
            3. Buffer cannot span a page boundry
    
    We address issues 2 and 3 by preallocating a per-cpu page for the buffer.
    Transient resource related failures are handled by retrying by the callers
    of this function.
    
    This patch is based on the investigation
    done by Dexuan Cui <decui@microsoft.com>.

    arm64: debug: don't re-enable debug exceptions on return from el1_dbg
    
    commit 1059c6bf8534acda249e7e65c81e7696fb074dc1 upstream.
    
    When returning from a debug exception taken from EL1, we unmask debug
    exceptions after handling the exception. This is crucial for debug
    exceptions taken from EL0, so that any kernel work on the ret_to_user
    path can be debugged by kgdb.
    
    However, when returning back to EL1 the only thing left to do is to
    restore the original register state before the exception return. If
    single-step has been enabled by the debug exception handler, we will
    get stuck in an infinite debug exception loop, since we will take the
    step exception as soon as we unmask debug exceptions.
    
    This patch avoids unmasking debug exceptions on the debug exception
    return path when the exception was taken from EL1.

    dmaengine: pl330: Fix NULL pointer dereference on probe failure
    
    commit 0f5ebabdd03b471da1906f7edddc61ceb35cee02 upstream.
    
    If dma_async_device_register() returns error and probe should clean up
    and return error, a NULL pointer exception happens because of
    dereference of not allocated channel thread:

    regulator: ltc3589: fix broken voltage transitions
    
    commit c5bb725ac2d1a13e9e766bf9a16bac986ade17cd upstream.
    
    VCCR is used as a trigger to start voltage transitions, so
    we need to mark it volatile in order to make sure it gets
    written to hardware every time we set a new voltage.
    
    Fixes regulator voltage being stuck at the first voltage
    set after driver load.

    mptfusion: enable no_write_same for vmware scsi disks
    
    commit 4089b71cc820a426d601283c92fcd4ffeb5139c2 upstream.
    
    When using a virtual SCSI disk in a VMWare VM if blkdev_issue_zeroout is used
    data can be improperly zeroed out using the mptfusion driver. This patch
    disables write_same for this driver and the vmware subsystem_vendor which
    ensures that manual zeroing out is used instead.

    commit a41a9ad3bbf61fae0b6bfb232153da60d14fdbd9 upstream.
    
    Dan Carpenter found a issue where be2iscsi would copy the ip
    from userspace to the driver buffer before checking the len
    of the data being copied:
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=140982651504251&w=2
    
    This patch just has us only copy what we the driver buffer
    can support.

    regmap: fix possible ZERO_SIZE_PTR pointer dereferencing error.
    
    commit d6b41cb06044a7d895db82bdd54f6e4219970510 upstream.
    
    Since we cannot make sure the 'val_count' will always be none zero
    here, and then if it equals to zero, the kmemdup() will return
    ZERO_SIZE_PTR, which equals to ((void *)16).
    
    So this patch fix this with just doing the zero check before calling
    kmemdup().

    If 'map->dev' is NULL and there will lead dev_name() to be NULL pointer
    dereference. So before dev_name(), we need to have check of the map->dev
    pionter.
    
    We also should make sure that the 'name' pointer shouldn't be NULL for

    the 'name' pointer and 'map->dev' are both NULL.

    HID: rmi: check sanity of the incoming report
    
    commit 5b65c2a0296644dd3dbdd590d6f00174d18c96b3 upstream.
    
    In the Dell XPS 13 9333, it appears that sometimes the bus get confused
    and corrupts the incoming data. It fills the input report with the
    sentinel value "ff". Synaptics told us that such behavior does not comes
    from the touchpad itself, so we filter out such reports here.
    
    Unfortunately, we can not simply discard the incoming data because they
    may contain useful information. Most of the time, the misbehavior is
    quite near the end of the report, so we can still use the valid part of
    it.

    The only time this information is valuable is during the feature_mapping

    Quark x1000 advertises PGE via the standard CPUID method
    PGE bits exist in Quark X1000's PTEs. In order to flush
    an individual PTE it is necessary to reload CR3 irrespective
    of the PTE.PGE bit.
    
    See Quark Core_DevMan_001.pdf section 6.4.11

    x86,kvm,vmx: Preserve CR4 across VM entry
    
    commit d974baa398f34393db76be45f7d4d04fbdbb4a0a upstream.
    
    CR4 isn't constant; at least the TSD and PCE bits can vary.
    
    TBH, treating CR0 and CR3 as constant scares me a bit, too, but it looks
    like it's correct.
    
    This adds a branch and a read from cr4 to each vm entry.  Because it is
    extremely likely that consecutive entries into the same vcpu will have
    the same host cr4 value, this fixes up the vmcs instead of restoring cr4
    after the fact.  A subsequent patch will add a kernel-wide cr4 shadow,
    reducing the overhead in the common case to just two memory reads and a
    branch.

    kvm: don't take vcpu mutex for obviously invalid vcpu ioctls
    
    commit 2ea75be3219571d0ec009ce20d9971e54af96e09 upstream.
    
    vcpu ioctls can hang the calling thread if issued while a vcpu is running.
    However, invalid ioctls can happen when userspace tries to probe the kind
    of file descriptors (e.g. isatty() calls ioctl(TCGETS)); in that case,
    we know the ioctl is going to be rejected as invalid anyway and we can
    fail before trying to take the vcpu mutex.
    
    This patch does not change functionality, it just makes invalid ioctls
    fail faster.

    kvm: fix potentially corrupt mmio cache
    
    commit ee3d1570b58677885b4552bce8217fda7b226a68 upstream.
    
    vcpu exits and memslot mutations can run concurrently as long as the
    vcpu does not aquire the slots mutex. Thus it is theoretically possible
    for memslots to change underneath a vcpu that is handling an exit.
    
    If we increment the memslot generation number again after
    synchronize_srcu_expedited(), vcpus can safely cache memslot generation
    without maintaining a single rcu_dereference through an entire vm exit.
    And much of the x86/kvm code does not maintain a single rcu_dereference
    of the current memslots during each exit.
    
    We can prevent the following case:
    
       vcpu (CPU 0)                             | thread (CPU 1)
    --------------------------------------------+--------------------------
    1  vm exit                                  |
    2  srcu_read_unlock(&kvm->srcu)             |
    3  decide to cache something based on       |
         old memslots                           |
    4                                           | change memslots
                                                | (increments generation)
    5                                           | synchronize_srcu(&kvm->srcu);
    6  retrieve generation # from new memslots  |
    7  tag cache with new memslot generation    |
    8  srcu_read_unlock(&kvm->srcu)             |
    ...                                         |
       <action based on cache occurs even       |
        though the caching decision was based   |
        on the old memslots>                    |
    ...                                         |
       <action *continues* to occur until next  |
        memslot generation change, which may    |
        be never>                               |
                                                |
    
    By incrementing the generation after synchronizing with kvm->srcu readers,
    we ensure that the generation retrieved in (6) will become invalid soon
    after (8).
    
    Keeping the existing increment is not strictly necessary, but we
    do keep it and just move it for consistency from update_memslots to
    install_new_memslots.  It invalidates old cached MMIOs immediately,
    instead of having to wait for the end of synchronize_srcu_expedited,
    which makes the code more clearly correct in case CPU 1 is preempted
    right after synchronize_srcu() returns.
    
    To avoid halving the generation space in SPTEs, always presume that the
    low bit of the generation is zero when reconstructing a generation number
    out of an SPTE.  This effectively disables MMIO caching in SPTEs during
    the call to synchronize_srcu_expedited.  Using the low bit this way is
    somewhat like a seqcount---where the protected thing is a cache, and
    instead of retrying we can simply punt if we observe the low bit to be 1.

    commit 56f17dd3fbc44adcdbc3340fe3988ddb833a47a7 upstream.
    
    The following events can lead to an incorrect KVM_EXIT_MMIO bubbling
    up to userspace:
    
    (1) Guest accesses gpa X without a memory slot. The gfn is cached in
    struct kvm_vcpu_arch (mmio_gfn). On Intel EPT-enabled hosts, KVM sets
    the SPTE write-execute-noread so that future accesses cause
    EPT_MISCONFIGs.
    
    (2) Host userspace creates a memory slot via KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION
    covering the page just accessed.
    
    (3) Guest attempts to read or write to gpa X again. On Intel, this
    generates an EPT_MISCONFIG. The memory slot generation number that
    was incremented in (2) would normally take care of this but we fast
    path mmio faults through quickly_check_mmio_pf(), which only checks
    the per-vcpu mmio cache. Since we hit the cache, KVM passes a
    KVM_EXIT_MMIO up to userspace.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by using the memslot generation number
    to validate the mmio cache.

    Revert "Btrfs: race free update of commit root for ro snapshots"
    
    commit d37973082b453ba6b89ec07eb7b84305895d35e1 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 9c3b306e1c9e6be4be09e99a8fe2227d1005effc.
    
    Switching only one commit root during a transaction is wrong because it
    leads the fs into an inconsistent state. All commit roots should be
    switched at once, at transaction commit time, otherwise backref walking
    can often miss important references that were only accessible through
    the old commit root.  Plus, the root item for the snapshot's root wasn't
    getting updated and preventing the next transaction commit to do it.
    
    This made several users get into random corruption issues after creation
    of readonly snapshots.
    
    A regression test for xfstests will follow soon.

    Btrfs: fix race in WAIT_SYNC ioctl
    
    commit 42383020beb1cfb05f5d330cc311931bc4917a97 upstream.
    
    We check whether transid is already committed via last_trans_committed and
    then search through trans_list for pending transactions.  If
    last_trans_committed is updated by btrfs_commit_transaction after we check
    it (there is no locking), we will fail to find the committed transaction
    and return EINVAL to the caller.  This has been observed occasionally by
    ceph-osd (which uses this ioctl heavily).
    
    Fix by rechecking whether the provided transid <= last_trans_committed
    after the search fails, and if so return 0.

    Btrfs: fix build_backref_tree issue with multiple shared blocks
    
    commit bbe9051441effce51c9a533d2c56440df64db2d7 upstream.
    
    Marc Merlin sent me a broken fs image months ago where it would blow up in the
    upper->checked BUG_ON() in build_backref_tree.  This is because we had a
    scenario like this
    
    block a -- level 4 (not shared)
       |
    block b -- level 3 (reloc block, shared)
       |
    block c -- level 2 (not shared)
       |
    block d -- level 1 (shared)
       |
    block e -- level 0 (shared)
    
    We go to build a backref tree for block e, we notice block d is shared and add
    it to the list of blocks to lookup it's backrefs for.  Now when we loop around
    we will check edges for the block, so we will see we looked up block c last
    time.  So we lookup block d and then see that the block that points to it is
    block c and we can just skip that edge since we've already been up this path.
    The problem is because we clear need_check when we see block d (as it is shared)
    we never add block b as needing to be checked.  And because block c is in our
    path already we bail out before we walk up to block b and add it to the backref
    check list.
    
    To fix this we need to reset need_check if we trip over a block that doesn't
    need to be checked.  This will make sure that any subsequent blocks in the path
    as we're walking up afterwards are added to the list to be processed.  With this
    patch I can now mount Marc's fs image and it'll complete the balance without
    panicing.  Thanks,

    Btrfs: cleanup error handling in build_backref_tree
    
    commit 75bfb9aff45e44625260f52a5fd581b92ace3e62 upstream.
    
    When balance panics it tends to panic in the
    
    BUG_ON(!upper->checked);
    
    test, because it means it couldn't build the backref tree properly.  This is
    annoying to users and frankly a recoverable error, nothing in this function is
    actually fatal since it is just an in-memory building of the backrefs for a
    given bytenr.  So go through and change all the BUG_ON()'s to ASSERT()'s, and
    fix the BUG_ON(!upper->checked) thing to just return an error.
    
    This patch also fixes the error handling so it tears down the work we've done
    properly.  This code was horribly broken since we always just panic'ed instead
    of actually erroring out, so it needed to be completely re-worked.  With this
    patch my broken image no longer panics when I mount it.  Thanks,

    Btrfs: try not to ENOSPC on log replay
    
    commit 1d52c78afbbf80b58299e076a159617d6b42fe3c upstream.
    
    When doing log replay we may have to update inodes, which traditionally goes
    through our delayed inode stuff.  This will try to move space over from the
    trans handle, but we don't reserve space in our trans handle on replay since we
    don't know how much we will need, so instead we try to flush.  But because we
    have a trans handle open we won't flush anything, so if we are out of reserve
    space we will simply return ENOSPC.  Since we know that if an operation made it
    into the log then we definitely had space before the box bought the farm then we
    don't need to worry about doing this space reservation.  Use the
    fs_info->log_root_recovering flag to skip the delayed inode stuff and update the
    item directly.  Thanks,

    btrfs: Fix and enhance merge_extent_mapping() to insert best fitted extent map
    
    commit e6c4efd87ab04e5ead363f24e6ac35ed3506d401 upstream.
    
    The following commit enhanced the merge_extent_mapping() to reduce
    fragment in extent map tree, but it can't handle case which existing
    lies before map_start:
    51f39 btrfs: Use right extent length when inserting overlap extent map.
    
    [BUG]
    When existing extent map's start is before map_start,
    the em->len will be minus, which will corrupt the extent map and fail to
    insert the new extent map.
    This will happen when someone get a large extent map, but when it is
    going to insert it into extent map tree, some one has already commit
    some write and split the huge extent into small parts.
    
    [REPRODUCER]
    It is very easy to tiger using filebench with randomrw personality.
    It is about 100% to reproduce when using 8G preallocated file in 60s
    randonrw test.
    
    [FIX]
    This patch can now handle any existing extent position.
    Since it does not directly use existing->start, now it will find the
    previous and next extent around map_start.
    So the old existing->start < map_start bug will never happen again.
    
    [ENHANCE]
    This patch will insert the best fitted extent map into extent map tree,
    other than the oldest [map_start, map_start + sectorsize) or the
    relatively newer but not perfect [map_start, existing->start).
    
    The patch will first search existing extent that does not intersects with
    the desired map range [map_start, map_start + len).
    The existing extent will be either before or behind map_start, and based
    on the existing extent, we can find out the previous and next extent
    around map_start.
    
    So the best fitted extent would be [prev->end, next->start).
    For prev or next is not found, em->start would be prev->end and em->end
    wold be next->start.
    
    With this patch, the fragment in extent map tree should be reduced much
    more than the 51f39 commit and reduce an unneeded extent map tree search.

    Btrfs: add missing compression property remove in btrfs_ioctl_setflags
    
    commit 78a017a2c92df9b571db0a55a016280f9019c65e upstream.
    
    The behaviour of a 'chattr -c' consists of getting the current flags,
    clearing the FS_COMPR_FL bit and then sending the result to the set
    flags ioctl - this means the bit FS_NOCOMP_FL isn't set in the flags
    passed to the ioctl. This results in the compression property not being
    cleared from the inode - it was cleared only if the bit FS_NOCOMP_FL
    was set in the received flags.
    
    Reproducer:
    
        $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdd
        $ mount /dev/sdd /mnt && cd /mnt
        $ mkdir a
        $ chattr +c a

    The consistency of btrfs devices list and their superblocks is protected

    btrfs: don't go readonly on existing qgroup items
    
    commit 0b4699dcb65c2cff793210b07f40b98c2d423a43 upstream.
    
    btrfs_drop_snapshot() leaves subvolume qgroup items on disk after
    completion. This can cause problems with snapshot creation. If a new
    snapshot tries to claim the deleted subvolumes id, btrfs will get -EEXIST
    from add_qgroup_item() and go read-only. The following commands will
    reproduce this problem (assume btrfs is on /dev/sda and is mounted at
    /btrfs)
    
    mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sda
    mount -t btrfs /dev/sda /btrfs/
    btrfs quota enable /btrfs/
    btrfs su sna /btrfs/ /btrfs/snap
    btrfs su de /btrfs/snap
    sleep 45
    umount /btrfs/
    mount -t btrfs /dev/sda /btrfs/
    
    We can fix this by catching -EEXIST in add_qgroup_item() and
    initializing the existing items. We have the problem of orphaned
    relation items being on disk from an old snapshot but that is outside
    the scope of this patch.

    btrfs: wake up transaction thread from SYNC_FS ioctl
    
    commit 2fad4e83e12591eb3bd213875b9edc2d18e93383 upstream.
    
    The transaction thread may want to do more work, namely it pokes the
    cleaner ktread that will start processing uncleaned subvols.
    
    This can be triggered by user via the 'btrfs fi sync' command, otherwise
    there was a delay up to 30 seconds before the cleaner started to clean
    old snapshots.
