    batman-adv: Force mac header to start of data on xmit
    
    commit 9114daa825fc3f335f9bea3313ce667090187280 upstream.
    
    The caller of ndo_start_xmit may not already have called
    skb_reset_mac_header. The returned value of skb_mac_header/eth_hdr
    therefore can be in the wrong position and even outside the current skbuff.
    This for example happens when the user binds to the device using a
    PF_PACKET-SOCK_RAW with enabled qdisc-bypass:
    
      int opt = 4;
      setsockopt(sock, SOL_PACKET, PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, &opt, sizeof(opt));
    
    Since eth_hdr is used all over the codebase, the batadv_interface_tx
    function must always take care of resetting it.

    batman-adv: Avoid WARN on net_device without parent in netns
    
    commit 955d3411a17f590364238bd0d3329b61f20c1cd2 upstream.
    
    It is not allowed to use WARN* helpers on potential incorrect input from
    the user or transient problems because systems configured as panic_on_warn
    will reboot due to such a problem.
    
    A NULL return value of __dev_get_by_index can be caused by various problems
    which can either be related to the system configuration or problems
    (incorrectly returned network namespaces) in other (virtual) net_device
    drivers. batman-adv should not cause a (harmful) WARN in this situation and
    instead only report it via a simple message.

    xfrm: refine validation of template and selector families
    
    commit 35e6103861a3a970de6c84688c6e7a1f65b164ca upstream.
    
    The check assumes that in transport mode, the first templates family
    must match the address family of the policy selector.
    
    Syzkaller managed to build a template using MODE_ROUTEOPTIMIZATION,
    with ipv4-in-ipv6 chain, leading to following splat:
    
    BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in xfrm_state_find+0x1db/0x1854
    Read of size 4 at addr ffff888063e57aa0 by task a.out/2050
     xfrm_state_find+0x1db/0x1854
     xfrm_tmpl_resolve+0x100/0x1d0
     xfrm_resolve_and_create_bundle+0x108/0x1000 [..]
    
    Problem is that addresses point into flowi4 struct, but xfrm_state_find
    treats them as being ipv6 because it uses templ->encap_family is used
    (AF_INET6 in case of reproducer) rather than family (AF_INET).
    
    This patch inverts the logic: Enforce 'template family must match
    selector' EXCEPT for tunnel and BEET mode.
    
    In BEET and Tunnel mode, xfrm_tmpl_resolve_one will have remote/local
    address pointers changed to point at the addresses found in the template,
    rather than the flowi ones, so no oob read will occur.

    libceph: avoid KEEPALIVE_PENDING races in ceph_con_keepalive()
    
    commit 4aac9228d16458cedcfd90c7fb37211cf3653ac3 upstream.
    
    con_fault() can transition the connection into STANDBY right after
    ceph_con_keepalive() clears STANDBY in clear_standby():
    
        libceph user thread               ceph-msgr worker
    
    ceph_con_keepalive()
      mutex_lock(&con->mutex)
      clear_standby(con)
      mutex_unlock(&con->mutex)
                                    mutex_lock(&con->mutex)
                                    con_fault()
                                      ...
                                      if KEEPALIVE_PENDING isn't set
                                        set state to STANDBY
                                      ...
                                    mutex_unlock(&con->mutex)
      set KEEPALIVE_PENDING
      set WRITE_PENDING
    
    This triggers warnings in clear_standby() when either ceph_con_send()
    or ceph_con_keepalive() get to clearing STANDBY next time.
    
    I don't see a reason to condition queue_con() call on the previous
    value of KEEPALIVE_PENDING, so move the setting of KEEPALIVE_PENDING
    into the critical section -- unlike WRITE_PENDING, KEEPALIVE_PENDING
    could have been a non-atomic flag.

    HID: debug: fix the ring buffer implementation
    
    commit 13054abbaa4f1fd4e6f3b4b63439ec033b4c8035 upstream.
    
    Ring buffer implementation in hid_debug_event() and hid_debug_events_read()
    is strange allowing lost or corrupted data. After commit 717adfdaf147
    ("HID: debug: check length before copy_to_user()") it is possible to enter
    an infinite loop in hid_debug_events_read() by providing 0 as count, this
    locks up a system. Fix this by rewriting the ring buffer implementation
    with kfifo and simplify the code.
    
    This fixes CVE-2019-3819.
    
    v2: fix an execution logic and add a comment
    v3: use __set_current_state() instead of set_current_state()
    
    Backport to v4.9: some tree-wide patches are missing in v4.9 so
    cherry-pick relevant pieces from:
     * 6396bb22151 ("treewide: kzalloc() -> kcalloc()")

    nfsd4: catch some false session retries
    
    commit 53da6a53e1d414e05759fa59b7032ee08f4e22d7 upstream.
    
    The spec allows us to return NFS4ERR_SEQ_FALSE_RETRY if we notice that
    the client is making a call that matches a previous (slot, seqid) pair
    but that *isn't* actually a replay, because some detail of the call
    doesn't actually match the previous one.
    
    Catching every such case is difficult, but we may as well catch a few
    easy ones.  This also handles the case described in the previous patch,
    in a different way.
    
    The spec does however require us to catch the case where the difference
    is in the rpc credentials.  This prevents somebody from snooping another
    user's replies by fabricating retries.
    
    (But the practical value of the attack is limited by the fact that the
    replies with the most sensitive data are READ replies, which are not
    normally cached.)

    nfsd4: fix cached replies to solo SEQUENCE compounds
    
    commit 085def3ade52f2ffe3e31f42e98c27dcc222dd37 upstream.
    
    Currently our handling of 4.1+ requests without "cachethis" set is
    confusing and not quite correct.
    
    Suppose a client sends a compound consisting of only a single SEQUENCE
    op, and it matches the seqid in a session slot (so it's a retry), but
    the previous request with that seqid did not have "cachethis" set.
    
    The obvious thing to do might be to return NFS4ERR_RETRY_UNCACHED_REP,
    but the protocol only allows that to be returned on the op following the
    SEQUENCE, and there is no such op in this case.
    
    The protocol permits us to cache replies even if the client didn't ask
    us to.  And it's easy to do so in the case of solo SEQUENCE compounds.
    
    So, when we get a solo SEQUENCE, we can either return the previously
    cached reply or NFSERR_SEQ_FALSE_RETRY if we notice it differs in some
    way from the original call.
    
    Currently, we're returning a corrupt reply in the case a solo SEQUENCE
    matches a previous compound with more ops.  This actually matters
    because the Linux client recently started doing this as a way to recover
    from lost replies to idempotent operations in the case the process doing
    the original reply was killed: in that case it's difficult to keep the
    original arguments around to do a real retry, and the client no longer
    cares what the result is anyway, but it would like to make sure that the
    slot's sequence id has been incremented, and the solo SEQUENCE assures
    that: if the server never got the original reply, it will increment the
    sequence id.  If it did get the original reply, it won't increment, and
    nothing else that about the reply really matters much.  But we can at
    least attempt to return valid xdr!

    drm/vmwgfx: Return error code from vmw_execbuf_copy_fence_user
    
    commit 728354c005c36eaf44b6e5552372b67e60d17f56 upstream.
    
    The function was unconditionally returning 0, and a caller would have to
    rely on the returned fence pointer being NULL to detect errors. However,
    the function vmw_execbuf_copy_fence_user() would expect a non-zero error
    code in that case and would BUG otherwise.
    
    So make sure we return a proper non-zero error code if the fence pointer
    returned is NULL.

    mac80211: ensure that mgmt tx skbs have tailroom for encryption
    
    commit 9d0f50b80222dc273e67e4e14410fcfa4130a90c upstream.
    
    Some drivers use IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_SW_MGMT_TX to indicate that management
    frames need to be software encrypted. Since normal data packets are still
    encrypted by the hardware, crypto_tx_tailroom_needed_cnt gets decremented
    after key upload to hw. This can lead to passing skbs to ccmp_encrypt_skb,
    which don't have the necessary tailroom for software encryption.
    
    Change the code to add tailroom for encrypted management packets, even if
    crypto_tx_tailroom_needed_cnt is 0.

    MIPS: VDSO: Include $(ccflags-vdso) in o32,n32 .lds builds
    
    commit 67fc5dc8a541e8f458d7f08bf88ff55933bf9f9d upstream.
    
    When generating vdso-o32.lds & vdso-n32.lds for use with programs
    running as compat ABIs under 64b kernels, we previously haven't included
    the compiler flags that are supposedly common to all ABIs - ie. those in
    the ccflags-vdso variable.
    
    This is problematic in cases where we need to provide the -m%-float flag
    in order to ensure that we don't attempt to use a floating point ABI
    that's incompatible with the target CPU & ABI. For example a toolchain
    using current gcc trunk configured --with-fp-32=xx fails to build a
    64r6el_defconfig kernel with the following error:
    
      cc1: error: '-march=mips1' requires '-mfp32'
      make[2]: *** [arch/mips/vdso/Makefile:135: arch/mips/vdso/vdso-o32.lds] Error 1
    
    Include $(ccflags-vdso) for the compat VDSO .lds builds, just as it is
    included for the native VDSO .lds & when compiling objects for the
    compat VDSOs. This ensures we consistently provide the -msoft-float flag
    amongst others, avoiding the problem by ensuring we're agnostic to the
    toolchain defaults.

    debugfs: fix debugfs_rename parameter checking
    
    commit d88c93f090f708c18195553b352b9f205e65418f upstream.
    
    debugfs_rename() needs to check that the dentries passed into it really
    are valid, as sometimes they are not (i.e. if the return value of
    another debugfs call is passed into this one.)  So fix this up by
    properly checking if the two parent directories are errors (they are
    allowed to be NULL), and if the dentry to rename is not NULL or an
    error.

    signal: Better detection of synchronous signals
    
    commit 7146db3317c67b517258cb5e1b08af387da0618b upstream.
    
    Recently syzkaller was able to create unkillablle processes by
    creating a timer that is delivered as a thread local signal on SIGHUP,
    and receiving SIGHUP SA_NODEFERER.  Ultimately causing a loop failing
    to deliver SIGHUP but always trying.
    
    When the stack overflows delivery of SIGHUP fails and force_sigsegv is
    called.  Unfortunately because SIGSEGV is numerically higher than
    SIGHUP next_signal tries again to deliver a SIGHUP.
    
    From a quality of implementation standpoint attempting to deliver the
    timer SIGHUP signal is wrong.  We should attempt to deliver the
    synchronous SIGSEGV signal we just forced.
    
    We can make that happening in a fairly straight forward manner by
    instead of just looking at the signal number we also look at the
    si_code.  In particular for exceptions (aka synchronous signals) the
    si_code is always greater than 0.
    
    That still has the potential to pick up a number of asynchronous
    signals as in a few cases the same si_codes that are used
    for synchronous signals are also used for asynchronous signals,
    and SI_KERNEL is also included in the list of possible si_codes.
    
    Still the heuristic is much better and timer signals are definitely
    excluded.  Which is enough to prevent all known ways for someone
    sending a process signals fast enough to cause unexpected and
    arguably incorrect behavior.

    signal: Always notice exiting tasks
    
    commit 35634ffa1751b6efd8cf75010b509dcb0263e29b upstream.
    
    Recently syzkaller was able to create unkillablle processes by
    creating a timer that is delivered as a thread local signal on SIGHUP,
    and receiving SIGHUP SA_NODEFERER.  Ultimately causing a loop
    failing to deliver SIGHUP but always trying.
    
    Upon examination it turns out part of the problem is actually most of
    the solution.  Since 2.5 signal delivery has found all fatal signals,
    marked the signal group for death, and queued SIGKILL in every threads
    thread queue relying on signal->group_exit_code to preserve the
    information of which was the actual fatal signal.
    
    The conversion of all fatal signals to SIGKILL results in the
    synchronous signal heuristic in next_signal kicking in and preferring
    SIGHUP to SIGKILL.  Which is especially problematic as all
    fatal signals have already been transformed into SIGKILL.
    
    Instead of dequeueing signals and depending upon SIGKILL to
    be the first signal dequeued, first test if the signal group
    has already been marked for death.  This guarantees that
    nothing in the signal queue can prevent a process that needs
    to exit from exiting.

    mtd: rawnand: gpmi: fix MX28 bus master lockup problem
    
    commit d5d27fd9826b59979b184ec288e4812abac0e988 upstream.
    
    Disable BCH soft reset according to MX23 erratum #2847 ("BCH soft
    reset may cause bus master lock up") for MX28 too. It has the same
    problem.
    
    Observed problem: once per 100,000+ MX28 reboots NAND read failed on
    DMA timeout errors:
    [    1.770823] UBI: attaching mtd3 to ubi0
    [    2.768088] gpmi_nand: DMA timeout, last DMA :1
    [    3.958087] gpmi_nand: BCH timeout, last DMA :1

    bytes from PEB 0:0, read only 0 bytes, retry
    [    4.171283] step 1 error
    [    4.173846] gpmi_nand: Chip: 0, Error -1
    
    Without BCH soft reset we successfully executed 1,000,000 MX28 reboots.
    
    I have a quote from NXP regarding this problem, from July 18th 2016:
    
    "As the i.MX23 and i.MX28 are of the same generation, they share many
    characteristics. Unfortunately, also the erratas may be shared.
    In case of the documented erratas and the workarounds, you can also
    apply the workaround solution of one device on the other one. This have
    been reported, but I’m afraid that there are not an estimated date for
    updating the Errata documents.
    Please accept our apologies for any inconveniences this may cause."
