    kernel/sysctl.c: fix out-of-bounds access when setting file-max
    
    commit 9002b21465fa4d829edfc94a5a441005cffaa972 upstream.
    
    Commit 32a5ad9c2285 ("sysctl: handle overflow for file-max") hooked up
    min/max values for the file-max sysctl parameter via the .extra1 and
    .extra2 fields in the corresponding struct ctl_table entry.
    
    Unfortunately, the minimum value points at the global 'zero' variable,
    which is an int.  This results in a KASAN splat when accessed as a long
    by proc_doulongvec_minmax on 64-bit architectures:

    Fix the splat by introducing a unsigned long 'zero_ul' and using that
    instead.

    commit 71492580571467fb7177aade19c18ce7486267f5 upstream.
    
    Tetsuo rightly points out that the backport here is incorrect, as it
    touches the __lock_set_class function instead of the intended
    __lock_downgrade function.

    i2c-hid: properly terminate i2c_hid_dmi_desc_override_table[] array
    
    commit b59dfdaef173677b0b7e10f375226c0a1114fd20 upstream.
    
    Commit 9ee3e06610fd ("HID: i2c-hid: override HID descriptors for certain
    devices") added a new dmi_system_id quirk table to override certain HID
    report descriptors for some systems that lack them.
    
    But the table wasn't properly terminated, causing the dmi matching to
    walk off into la-la-land, and starting to treat random data as dmi
    descriptor pointers, causing boot-time oopses if you were at all
    unlucky.
    
    Terminate the array.
    
    We really should have some way to just statically check that arrays that
    should be terminated by an empty entry actually are so.  But the HID
    people really should have caught this themselves, rather than have me
    deal with an oops during the merge window.  Tssk, tssk.

    tools include: Adopt linux/bits.h
    
    commit ba4aa02b417f08a0bee5e7b8ed70cac788a7c854 upstream.
    
    So that we reduce the difference of tools/include/linux/bitops.h to the
    original kernel file, include/linux/bitops.h, trying to remove the need
    to define BITS_PER_LONG, to avoid clashes with asm/bitsperlong.h.
    
    And the things removed from tools/include/linux/bitops.h are really in
    linux/bits.h, so that we can have a copy and then
    tools/perf/check_headers.sh will tell us when new stuff gets added to
    linux/bits.h so that we can check if it is useful and if any adjustment
    needs to be done to the tools/{include,arch}/ copies.

    ALSA: info: Fix racy addition/deletion of nodes
    
    commit 8c2f870890fd28e023b0fcf49dcee333f2c8bad7 upstream.
    
    The ALSA proc helper manages the child nodes in a linked list, but its
    addition and deletion is done without any lock.  This leads to a
    corruption if they are operated concurrently.  Usually this isn't a
    problem because the proc entries are added sequentially in the driver
    probe procedure itself.  But the card registrations are done often
    asynchronously, and the crash could be actually reproduced with
    syzkaller.
    
    This patch papers over it by protecting the link addition and deletion
    with the parent's mutex.  There is "access" mutex that is used for the
    file access, and this can be reused for this purpose as well.

    mm/vmstat.c: fix /proc/vmstat format for CONFIG_DEBUG_TLBFLUSH=y CONFIG_SMP=n
    
    commit e8277b3b52240ec1caad8e6df278863e4bf42eac upstream.
    
    Commit 58bc4c34d249 ("mm/vmstat.c: skip NR_TLB_REMOTE_FLUSH* properly")
    depends on skipping vmstat entries with empty name introduced in
    7aaf77272358 ("mm: don't show nr_indirectly_reclaimable in
    /proc/vmstat") but reverted in b29940c1abd7 ("mm: rename and change
    semantics of nr_indirectly_reclaimable_bytes").
    
    So skipping no longer works and /proc/vmstat has misformatted lines " 0".
    
    This patch simply shows debug counters "nr_tlb_remote_*" for UP.

    device_cgroup: fix RCU imbalance in error case
    
    commit 0fcc4c8c044e117ac126ab6df4138ea9a67fa2a9 upstream.
    
    When dev_exception_add() returns an error (due to a failed memory
    allocation), make sure that we move the RCU preemption count back to where
    it was before we were called. We dropped the RCU read lock inside the loop
    body, so we can't just "break".

    sched/fair: Limit sched_cfs_period_timer() loop to avoid hard lockup
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e8e19226398db8265a8e675fcc0118b9e80c9e8 ]
    
    With extremely short cfs_period_us setting on a parent task group with a large
    number of children the for loop in sched_cfs_period_timer() can run until the
    watchdog fires. There is no guarantee that the call to hrtimer_forward_now()
    will ever return 0.  The large number of children can make
    do_sched_cfs_period_timer() take longer than the period.
    
     NMI watchdog: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu 24
     RIP: 0010:tg_nop+0x0/0x10
      <IRQ>
      walk_tg_tree_from+0x29/0xb0
      unthrottle_cfs_rq+0xe0/0x1a0

      apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20
      </IRQ>
    
    To prevent this we add protection to the loop that detects when the loop has run
    too many times and scales the period and quota up, proportionally, so that the timer
    can complete before then next period expires.  This preserves the relative runtime
    quota while preventing the hard lockup.
    
    A warning is issued reporting this state and the new values.

    modpost: file2alias: go back to simple devtable lookup

    this works in the same way regardless of the underlying executable

    mmc: sdhci: Handle auto-command errors
    
    [ Upstream commit af849c86109d79222e549826068bbf4e7f9a2472 ]
    
    If the host controller supports auto-commands then enable the auto-command
    error interrupt and handle it. In the case of auto-CMD23, the error is
    treated the same as manual CMD23 error. In the case of auto-CMD12,
    commands-during-transfer are not permitted, so the error handling is
    treated the same as a data error.

    [ Upstream commit 4bf780996669280171c9cd58196512849b93434e ]
    
    Existing data command CRC error handling is non-standard and does not work
    with some Intel host controllers. Specifically, the assumption that the host
    controller will continue operating normally after the error interrupt,
    is not valid. Change the driver to handle the error in the same manner
    as a data CRC error, taking care to ensure that the data line reset is
    done for single or multi-block transfers, and it is done before
    unmapping DMA.

    The ARS implementation implements exponential back-off on the poll
    interval to prevent high-frequency access to the DIMM / platform
    interface. Depending on when the ARS completes the poll interval may
    exceed the completion event by minutes. Allow root to reset the timeout
    each time it probes the status. A one-second timeout is still enforced,
    but root can otherwise can control the poll interval.

    timers/sched_clock: Prevent generic sched_clock wrap caused by tick_freeze()
    
    commit 3f2552f7e9c5abef2775c53f7af66532f8bf65bc upstream.
    
    tick_freeze() introduced by suspend-to-idle in commit 124cf9117c5f ("PM /
    sleep: Make it possible to quiesce timers during suspend-to-idle") uses
    timekeeping_suspend() instead of syscore_suspend() during
    suspend-to-idle. As a consequence generic sched_clock will keep going
    because sched_clock_suspend() and sched_clock_resume() are not invoked
    during suspend-to-idle which can result in a generic sched_clock wrap.
    
    On a ARM system with suspend-to-idle enabled, sched_clock is registered
    as "56 bits at 13MHz, resolution 76ns, wraps every 4398046511101ns", which
    means the real wrapping duration is 8796093022202ns.
    
    [  134.551779] suspend-to-idle suspend (timekeeping_suspend())
    [ 1204.912239] suspend-to-idle resume (timekeeping_resume())
    ......
    [ 1206.912239] suspend-to-idle suspend (timekeeping_suspend())
    [ 5880.502807] suspend-to-idle resume (timekeeping_resume())

    sched_clock was not stopped during suspend-to-idle, and sched_clock_poll
    hrtimer was not expired because timekeeping_suspend() was invoked during
    suspend-to-idle. It makes sched_clock wrap at kernel time 8796s.
    
    To prevent this, invoke sched_clock_suspend() and sched_clock_resume() in
    tick_freeze() together with timekeeping_suspend() and timekeeping_resume().

    x86/speculation: Prevent deadlock on ssb_state::lock
    
    commit 2f5fb19341883bb6e37da351bc3700489d8506a7 upstream.
    
    Mikhail reported a lockdep splat related to the AMD specific ssb_state
    lock:
    
      CPU0                       CPU1
      lock(&st->lock);
                                 local_irq_disable();
                                 lock(&(&sighand->siglock)->rlock);
                                 lock(&st->lock);
      <Interrupt>
         lock(&(&sighand->siglock)->rlock);
    
      *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    The connection between sighand->siglock and st->lock comes through seccomp,
    which takes st->lock while holding sighand->siglock.
    
    Make sure interrupts are disabled when __speculation_ctrl_update() is
    invoked via prctl() -> speculation_ctrl_update(). Add a lockdep assert to
    catch future offenders.

    perf/x86/amd: Add event map for AMD Family 17h
    
    commit 3fe3331bb285700ab2253dbb07f8e478fcea2f1b upstream.
    
    Family 17h differs from prior families by:
    
     - Does not support an L2 cache miss event
     - It has re-enumerated PMC counters for:
       - L2 cache references
       - front & back end stalled cycles
    
    So we add a new amd_f17h_perfmon_event_map[] so that the generic
    perf event names will resolve to the correct h/w events on
    family 17h and above processors.
    
    Reference sections 2.1.13.3.3 (stalls) and 2.1.13.3.6 (L2):

    mac80211: do not call driver wake_tx_queue op during reconfig
    
    commit 4856bfd230985e43e84c26473c91028ff0a533bd upstream.
    
    There are several scenarios in which mac80211 can call drv_wake_tx_queue
    after ieee80211_restart_hw has been called and has not yet completed.
    Driver private structs are considered uninitialized until mac80211 has
    uploaded the vifs, stations and keys again, so using private tx queue
    data during that time is not safe.
    
    The driver can also not rely on drv_reconfig_complete to figure out when
    it is safe to accept drv_wake_tx_queue calls again, because it is only
    called after all tx queues are woken again.
    
    To fix this, bail out early in drv_wake_tx_queue if local->in_reconfig
    is set.

    rt2x00: do not increment sequence number while re-transmitting
    
    commit 746ba11f170603bf1eaade817553a6c2e9135bbe upstream.
    
    Currently rt2x00 devices retransmit the management frames with
    incremented sequence number if hardware is assigning the sequence.
    
    This is HW bug fixed already for non-QOS data frames, but it should
    be fixed for management frames except beacon.
    
    Without fix retransmitted frames have wrong SN:
    
     AlphaNet_e8:fb:36 Vivotek_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1648, FN=0, Flags=........C Frame is not being retransmitted 1648 1
     AlphaNet_e8:fb:36 Vivotek_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1649, FN=0, Flags=....R...C Frame is being retransmitted 1649 1
     AlphaNet_e8:fb:36 Vivotek_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1650, FN=0, Flags=....R...C Frame is being retransmitted 1650 1
    
    With the fix SN stays correctly the same:

    commit 5f843ed415581cfad4ef8fefe31c138a8346ca8a upstream.
    
    The following commit introduced a bug in one of our error paths:
    
      819319fc9346 ("kprobes: Return error if we fail to reuse kprobe instead of BUG_ON()")
    
    it missed to handle the return value of kprobe_optready() as
    error-value. In reality, the kprobe_optready() returns a bool
    result, so "true" case must be passed instead of 0.
    
    This causes some errors on kprobe boot-time selftests on ARM:
    
     [   ] Beginning kprobe tests...
     [   ] Probe ARM code
     [   ]     kprobe
     [   ]     kretprobe
     [   ] ARM instruction simulation
     [   ]     Check decoding tables
     [   ]     Run test cases
     [   ] FAIL: test_case_handler not run
     [   ] FAIL: Test andge r10, r11, r14, asr r7
     [   ] FAIL: Scenario 11
     ...
     [   ] FAIL: Scenario 7
     [   ] Total instruction simulation tests=1631, pass=1433 fail=198
     [   ] kprobe tests failed
    
    This can happen if an optimized probe is unregistered and next
    kprobe is registered on same address until the previous probe
    is not reclaimed.
    
    If this happens, a hidden aggregated probe may be kept in memory,
    and no new kprobe can probe same address. Also, in that case
    register_kprobe() will return "1" instead of minus error value,
    which can mislead caller logic.

    x86/kprobes: Verify stack frame on kretprobe
    
    commit 3ff9c075cc767b3060bdac12da72fc94dd7da1b8 upstream.
    
    Verify the stack frame pointer on kretprobe trampoline handler,
    If the stack frame pointer does not match, it skips the wrong
    entry and tries to find correct one.
    
    This can happen if user puts the kretprobe on the function
    which can be used in the path of ftrace user-function call.
    Such functions should not be probed, so this adds a warning
    message that reports which function should be blacklisted.

    arm64: futex: Restore oldval initialization to work around buggy compilers
    
    commit ff8acf929014b7f87315588e0daf8597c8aa9d1c upstream.
    
    Commit 045afc24124d ("arm64: futex: Fix FUTEX_WAKE_OP atomic ops with
    non-zero result value") removed oldval's zero initialization in
    arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser because it is not necessary. Unfortunately,
    Android's arm64 GCC 4.9.4 [1] does not agree:
    
    ../kernel/futex.c: In function 'do_futex':
    ../kernel/futex.c:1658:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized
    in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
       return oldval == cmparg;
                     ^
    In file included from ../kernel/futex.c:73:0:
    ../arch/arm64/include/asm/futex.h:53:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
      int oldval, ret, tmp;
          ^
    
    GCC fails to follow that when ret is non-zero, futex_atomic_op_inuser
    returns right away, avoiding the uninitialized use that it claims.
    Restoring the zero initialization works around this issue.

    crypto: x86/poly1305 - fix overflow during partial reduction
    
    commit 678cce4019d746da6c680c48ba9e6d417803e127 upstream.
    
    The x86_64 implementation of Poly1305 produces the wrong result on some
    inputs because poly1305_4block_avx2() incorrectly assumes that when
    partially reducing the accumulator, the bits carried from limb 'd4' to
    limb 'h0' fit in a 32-bit integer.  This is true for poly1305-generic
    which processes only one block at a time.  However, it's not true for
    the AVX2 implementation, which processes 4 blocks at a time and
    therefore can produce intermediate limbs about 4x larger.
    
    Fix it by making the relevant calculations use 64-bit arithmetic rather
    than 32-bit.  Note that most of the carries already used 64-bit
    arithmetic, but the d4 -> h0 carry was different for some reason.
    
    To be safe I also made the same change to the corresponding SSE2 code,
    though that only operates on 1 or 2 blocks at a time.  I don't think
    it's really needed for poly1305_block_sse2(), but it doesn't hurt
    because it's already x86_64 code.  It *might* be needed for
    poly1305_2block_sse2(), but overflows aren't easy to reproduce there.
    
    This bug was originally detected by my patches that improve testmgr to
    fuzz algorithms against their generic implementation.  But also add a
    test vector which reproduces it directly (in the AVX2 case).
    
    Fixes: b1ccc8f4b631 ("crypto: poly1305 - Add a four block AVX2 variant for x86_64")
    Fixes: c70f4abef07a ("crypto: poly1305 - Add a SSE2 SIMD variant for x86_64")

    coredump: fix race condition between mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm() and core dumping
    
    commit 04f5866e41fb70690e28397487d8bd8eea7d712a upstream.
    
    The core dumping code has always run without holding the mmap_sem for
    writing, despite that is the only way to ensure that the entire vma
    layout will not change from under it.  Only using some signal
    serialization on the processes belonging to the mm is not nearly enough.
    This was pointed out earlier.  For example in Hugh's post from Jul 2017:
    
      https://lkml.kernel.org/r/alpine.LSU.2.11.1707191716030.2055@eggly.anvils
    
      "Not strictly relevant here, but a related note: I was very surprised
       to discover, only quite recently, how handle_mm_fault() may be called
       without down_read(mmap_sem) - when core dumping. That seems a
       misguided optimization to me, which would also be nice to correct"
    
    In particular because the growsdown and growsup can move the
    vm_start/vm_end the various loops the core dump does around the vma will
    not be consistent if page faults can happen concurrently.
    
    Pretty much all users calling mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm() and then
    taking the mmap_sem had the potential to introduce unexpected side
    effects in the core dumping code.
    
    Adding mmap_sem for writing around the ->core_dump invocation is a
    viable long term fix, but it requires removing all copy user and page
    faults and to replace them with get_dump_page() for all binary formats
    which is not suitable as a short term fix.
    
    For the time being this solution manually covers the places that can
    confuse the core dump either by altering the vma layout or the vma flags
    while it runs.  Once ->core_dump runs under mmap_sem for writing the
    function mmget_still_valid() can be dropped.
    
    Allowing mmap_sem protected sections to run in parallel with the
    coredump provides some minor parallelism advantage to the swapoff code
    (which seems to be safe enough by never mangling any vma field and can
    keep doing swapins in parallel to the core dumping) and to some other
    corner case.
    
    In order to facilitate the backporting I added "Fixes: 86039bd3b4e6"
    however the side effect of this same race condition in /proc/pid/mem
    should be reproducible since before 2.6.12-rc2 so I couldn't add any
    other "Fixes:" because there's no hash beyond the git genesis commit.
    
    Because find_extend_vma() is the only location outside of the process
    context that could modify the "mm" structures under mmap_sem for
    reading, by adding the mmget_still_valid() check to it, all other cases
    that take the mmap_sem for reading don't need the new check after
    mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm().  The expand_stack() in page fault
    context also doesn't need the new check, because all tasks under core
    dumping are frozen.

    Revert "svm: Fix AVIC incomplete IPI emulation"
    
    commit 4a58038b9e420276157785afa0a0bbb4b9bc2265 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit bb218fbcfaaa3b115d4cd7a43c0ca164f3a96e57.
    
    As Oren Twaig pointed out the old discussion:
    
      https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8292231/
    
    that the change coud potentially cause an extra IPI to be sent to
    the destination vcpu because the AVIC hardware already set the IRR bit
    before the incomplete IPI #VMEXIT with id=1 (target vcpu is not running).
    Since writting to ICR and ICR2 will also set the IRR. If something triggers
    the destination vcpu to get scheduled before the emulation finishes, then
    this could result in an additional IPI.
    
    Also, the issue mentioned in the commit bb218fbcfaaa was misdiagnosed.

    When SCSI blk-mq is enabled, there is a bug in handling errors in
    scsi_queue_rq.  Specifically, the bug is not setting result field of
    scsi_request correctly when the dispatch of the command has been
    failed. Since the upper layer code including the sg_io ioctl expects to
    receive any error status from result field of scsi_request, the error is
    silently ignored and this could cause data corruptions for some
    applications.

    The patch a6dbe4427559 ("vt: perform safe console erase in the right
    order") introduced a bug. The conditional do_update_region() was
    replaced by a call to update_region() that does contain the conditional
    already, but with unwanted extra side effects such as restoring the cursor
    drawing.
    
    In order to reproduce the bug:
    - use framebuffer console with the AMDGPU driver
    - type "links" to start the console www browser
    - press 'q' and space to exit links
    
    Now the cursor will be permanently visible in the center of the
    screen. It will stay there until something overwrites it.
    
    The bug goes away if we change update_region() back to the conditional
    do_update_region().

    serial: sh-sci: Fix HSCIF RX sampling point calculation
    
    commit ace965696da2611af759f0284e26342b7b6cec89 upstream.
    
    There are several issues with the formula used for calculating the
    deviation from the intended rate:
      1. While min_err and last_stop are signed, srr and baud are unsigned.
         Hence the signed values are promoted to unsigned, which will lead
         to a bogus value of deviation if min_err is negative,
      2. Srr is the register field value, which is one less than the actual
         sampling rate factor,
      3. The divisions do not use rounding.
    
    Fix this by casting unsigned variables to int, adding one to srr, and
    using a single DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST().

    ALSA: core: Fix card races between register and disconnect
    
    commit 2a3f7221acddfe1caa9ff09b3a8158c39b2fdeac upstream.
    
    There is a small race window in the card disconnection code that
    allows the registration of another card with the very same card id.
    This leads to a warning in procfs creation as caught by syzkaller.
    
    The problem is that we delete snd_cards and snd_cards_lock entries at
    the very beginning of the disconnection procedure.  This makes the
    slot available to be assigned for another card object while the
    disconnection procedure is being processed.  Then it becomes possible
    to issue a procfs registration with the existing file name although we
    check the conflict beforehand.
    
    The fix is simply to move the snd_cards and snd_cards_lock clearances
    at the end of the disconnection procedure.  The references to these
    entries are merely either from the global proc files like
    /proc/asound/cards or from the card registration / disconnection, so
    it should be fine to shift at the very end.

    staging: comedi: ni_usb6501: Fix possible double-free of ->usb_rx_buf
    
    commit af4b54a2e5ba18259ff9aac445bf546dd60d037e upstream.
    
    `ni6501_alloc_usb_buffers()` is called from `ni6501_auto_attach()` to
    allocate RX and TX buffers for USB transfers.  It allocates
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf` followed by `devpriv->usb_tx_buf`.  If the
    allocation of `devpriv->usb_tx_buf` fails, it frees
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf`, leaving the pointer set dangling, and returns an
    error.  Later, `ni6501_detach()` will be called from the core comedi
    module code to clean up.  `ni6501_detach()` also frees both
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf` and `devpriv->usb_tx_buf`, but
    `devpriv->usb_rx_buf` may have already beed freed, leading to a
    double-free error.  Fix it bu removing the call to
    `kfree(devpriv->usb_rx_buf)` from `ni6501_alloc_usb_buffers()`, relying
    on `ni6501_detach()` to free the memory.

    staging: comedi: ni_usb6501: Fix use of uninitialized mutex
    
    commit 660cf4ce9d0f3497cc7456eaa6d74c8b71d6282c upstream.
    
    If `ni6501_auto_attach()` returns an error, the core comedi module code
    will call `ni6501_detach()` to clean up.  If `ni6501_auto_attach()`
    successfully allocated the comedi device private data, `ni6501_detach()`
    assumes that a `struct mutex mut` contained in the private data has been
    initialized and uses it.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of places
    where `ni6501_auto_attach()` can return an error after allocating the
    device private data but before initializing the mutex, so this
    assumption is invalid.  Fix it by initializing the mutex just after
    allocating the private data in `ni6501_auto_attach()` before any other
    errors can be retturned.  Also move the call to `usb_set_intfdata()`
    just to keep the code a bit neater (either position for the call is
    fine).
    
    I believe this was the cause of the following syzbot crash report
    <https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=cf4f2b6c24aff0a3edf6>:

    This patch uses the device description to clearly identity a device
    attached to the bus. It is needed as the currently useed mdevX
    notation is not sufficiant in case more than one network
    interface controller is being used at the same time.

    iio: core: fix a possible circular locking dependency
    
    commit 7f75591fc5a123929a29636834d1bcb8b5c9fee3 upstream.
    
    This fixes a possible circular locking dependency detected warning seen
    with:
    - CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y
    - consumer/provider IIO devices (ex: "voltage-divider" consumer of "adc")
    
    When using the IIO consumer interface, e.g. iio_channel_get(), the consumer
    device will likely call iio_read_channel_raw() or similar that rely on
    'info_exist_lock' mutex.
    
    typically:
    ...
            mutex_lock(&chan->indio_dev->info_exist_lock);
            if (chan->indio_dev->info == NULL) {
                    ret = -ENODEV;
                    goto err_unlock;
            }
            ret = do_some_ops()
    err_unlock:
            mutex_unlock(&chan->indio_dev->info_exist_lock);
            return ret;
    ...
    
    Same mutex is also hold in iio_device_unregister().
    
    The following deadlock warning happens when:
    - the consumer device has called an API like iio_read_channel_raw()
      at least once.
    - the consumer driver is unregistered, removed (unbind from sysfs)

      lock(&dev->info_exist_lock);
                                   lock(kn->count#30);
                                   lock(&dev->info_exist_lock);
      lock(kn->count#30);
    
     *** DEADLOCK ***
    ...
    
    cdev_device_del() can be called without holding the lock. It should be safe
    as info_exist_lock prevents kernelspace consumers to use the exported
    routines during/after provider removal. cdev_device_del() is for userspace.
    
    Help to reproduce:
    See example: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/afe/voltage-divider.txt
    sysv {
            compatible = "voltage-divider";
            io-channels = <&adc 0>;
            output-ohms = <22>;
            full-ohms = <222>;
    };
    
    First, go to iio:deviceX for the "voltage-divider", do one read:
    $ cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX
    $ cat in_voltage0_raw
    
    Then, unbind the consumer driver. It triggers above deadlock warning.
    $ cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/iio-rescale/
    $ echo sysv > unbind
    
    Note I don't actually expect stable will pick this up all the
    way back into IIO being in staging, but if's probably valid that
    far back.

    commit 09c6bdee51183a575bf7546890c8c137a75a2b44 upstream.
    
    Having a brief look at at91_adc_read_raw() it is obvious that in the case
    of a timeout the setting of AT91_ADC_CHDR and AT91_ADC_IDR registers is
    omitted. If 2 different channels are queried we can end up with a
    situation where two interrupts are enabled, but only one interrupt is
    cleared in the interrupt handler. Resulting in a interrupt loop and a
    system hang.

    iio: Fix scan mask selection
    
    commit 20ea39ef9f2f911bd01c69519e7d69cfec79fde3 upstream.
    
    The trialmask is expected to have all bits set to 0 after allocation.
    Currently kmalloc_array() is used which does not zero the memory and so
    random bits are set. This results in random channels being enabled when
    they shouldn't. Replace kmalloc_array() with kcalloc() which has the same
    interface but zeros the memory.
    
    Note the fix is actually required earlier than the below fixes tag, but
    will require a manual backport due to move from kmalloc to kmalloc_array.

    iio: dac: mcp4725: add missing powerdown bits in store eeprom
    
    commit 06003531502d06bc89d32528f6ec96bf978790f9 upstream.
    
    When issuing the write DAC register and write eeprom command, the two
    powerdown bits (PD0 and PD1) are assumed by the chip to be present in
    the bytes sent. Leaving them at 0 implies "powerdown disabled" which is
    a different state that the current one. By adding the current state of
    the powerdown in the i2c write, the chip will correctly power-on exactly
    like as it is at the moment of store_eeprom call.
    
    This is documented in MCP4725's datasheet, FIGURE 6-2: "Write Commands
    for DAC Input Register and EEPROM" and MCP4726's datasheet, FIGURE 6-3:
    "Write All Memory Command".

    commit 3d02d7082e5823598090530c3988a35f69689943 upstream.
    
    Calculation did not use IIO_DEGREE_TO_RAD and implemented a variant to
    avoid precision loss as we aim a nano value. The offset added to avoid
    rounding error, though, doesn't give us a close result to the expected
    value. E.g.
    
    For 1000dps, the result should be:
    
        (1000 * pi ) / 180 >> 15 ~= 0.000532632218
    
    But with current calculation we get
    
        $ cat scale
        0.000547890
    
    Fix the calculation by just doing the maths involved for a nano value
    
       val * pi * 10e12 / (180 * 2^15)
    
    so we get a closer result.

    iio:chemical:bme680: Fix SPI read interface
    
    commit 73f3bc6da506711302bb67572440eb84b1ec4a2c upstream.
    
    The SPI interface implementation was completely broken.
    
    When using the SPI interface, there are only 7 address bits, the upper bit
    is controlled by a page select register. The core needs access to both
    ranges, so implement register read/write for both regions. The regmap
    paging functionality didn't agree with a register that needs to be read
    and modified, so I implemented a custom paging algorithm.
    
    This fixes that the device wouldn't even probe in SPI mode.
    
    The SPI interface then isn't different from I2C, merged them into the core,
    and the I2C/SPI named registers are no longer needed.
    
    Implemented register value caching for the registers to reduce the I2C/SPI
    data transfers considerably.
    
    The calibration set reads as all zeroes until some undefined point in time,
    and I couldn't determine what makes it valid. The datasheet mentions these
    registers but does not provide any hints on when they become valid, and they
    aren't even enumerated in the memory map. So check the calibration and
    retry reading it from the device after each measurement until it provides
    something valid.
    
    Despite the size this is suitable for a stable backport given that
    it seems the SPI support never worked.

    shows that we're sometimes able to deliver a few but never all.
    
    When we're trying to inject an NMI we may fail to do so immediately for
    various reasons, however, we still need to inject it so enable_nmi_window()
    arms nmi_singlestep mode. #DB occurs as expected, but we're not checking
    for pending NMIs before entering the guest and unless there's a different
    event to process, the NMI will never get delivered.
    
    Make KVM_REQ_EVENT request on the vCPU from db_interception() to make sure
    pending NMIs are checked and possibly injected.

    KVM: x86: Don't clear EFER during SMM transitions for 32-bit vCPU
    
    commit 8f4dc2e77cdfaf7e644ef29693fa229db29ee1de upstream.
    
    Neither AMD nor Intel CPUs have an EFER field in the legacy SMRAM save
    state area, i.e. don't save/restore EFER across SMM transitions.  KVM
    somewhat models this, e.g. doesn't clear EFER on entry to SMM if the
    guest doesn't support long mode.  But during RSM, KVM unconditionally
    clears EFER so that it can get back to pure 32-bit mode in order to
    start loading CRs with their actual non-SMM values.
    
    Clear EFER only when it will be written when loading the non-SMM state
    so as to preserve bits that can theoretically be set on 32-bit vCPUs,
    e.g. KVM always emulates EFER_SCE.
    
    And because CR4.PAE is cleared only to play nice with EFER, wrap that
    code in the long mode check as well.  Note, this may result in a
    compiler warning about cr4 being consumed uninitialized.  Re-read CR4
    even though it's technically unnecessary, as doing so allows for more
    readable code and RSM emulation is not a performance critical path.

    cifs: fix handle leak in smb2_query_symlink()
    
    commit e6d0fb7b34f264f72c33053558a360a6a734905e upstream.
    
    If we enter smb2_query_symlink() for something that is not a symlink
    and where the SMB2_open() would succeed we would never end up
    closing this handle and would thus leak a handle on the server.
    
    Fix this by immediately calling SMB2_close() on successfull open.

    CIFS: keep FileInfo handle live during oplock break
    
    commit b98749cac4a695f084a5ff076f4510b23e353ecd upstream.
    
    In the oplock break handler, writing pending changes from pages puts
    the FileInfo handle. If the refcount reaches zero it closes the handle
    and waits for any oplock break handler to return, thus causing a deadlock.
    
    To prevent this situation:
    
    * We add a wait flag to cifsFileInfo_put() to decide whether we should
      wait for running/pending oplock break handlers
    
    * We keep an additionnal reference of the SMB FileInfo handle so that
      for the rest of the handler putting the handle won't close it.
      - The ref is bumped everytime we queue the handler via the
        cifs_queue_oplock_break() helper.
      - The ref is decremented at the end of the handler
    
    This bug was triggered by xfstest 464.
    
    Also important fix to address the various reports of
    oops in smb2_push_mandatory_locks

    net: thunderx: raise XDP MTU to 1508
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ee15c101f29e0093ffb5448773ccbc786eb313b ]
    
    The thunderx driver splits frames bigger than 1530 bytes to multiple
    pages, making impossible to run an eBPF program on it.
    This leads to a maximum MTU of 1508 if QinQ is in use.
    
    The thunderx driver forbids to load an eBPF program if the MTU is higher
    than 1500 bytes. Raise the limit to 1508 so it is possible to use L2
    protocols which need some more headroom.

    [ Upstream commit d1841533e54876f152a30ac398a34f47ad6590b1 ]
    
    When binding multiple services with specific type 1Ki, 2Ki..,
    this leads to some entries in the name table of publications
    missing when listed out via 'tipc name show'.
    
    The problem is at identify zero last_type conditional provided
    via netlink. The first is initial 'type' when starting name table
    dummping. The second is continuously with zero type (node state
    service type). Then, lookup function failure to finding node state
    service type in next iteration.
    
    To solve this, adding more conditional to marked as dirty type and
    lookup correct service type for the next iteration instead of select
    the first service as initial 'type' zero.

    tcp: tcp_grow_window() needs to respect tcp_space()
    
    [ Upstream commit 50ce163a72d817a99e8974222dcf2886d5deb1ae ]
    
    For some reason, tcp_grow_window() correctly tests if enough room
    is present before attempting to increase tp->rcv_ssthresh,
    but does not prevent it to grow past tcp_space()
    
    This is causing hard to debug issues, like failing
    the (__tcp_select_window(sk) >= tp->rcv_wnd) test
    in __tcp_ack_snd_check(), causing ACK delays and possibly
    slow flows.
    
    Depending on tcp_rmem[2], MTU, skb->len/skb->truesize ratio,
    we can see the problem happening on "netperf -t TCP_RR -- -r 2000,2000"
    after about 60 round trips, when the active side no longer sends
    immediate acks.
    
    This bug predates git history.

    net: bridge: fix per-port af_packet sockets
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b2e2904deb314cc77a2192f506f2fd44e3d10d0 ]
    
    When the commit below was introduced it changed two visible things:
     - the skb was no longer passed through the protocol handlers with the
       original device
     - the skb was passed up the stack with skb->dev = bridge
    
    The first change broke af_packet sockets on bridge ports. For example we
    use them for hostapd which listens for ETH_P_PAE packets on the ports.
    We discussed two possible fixes:
     - create a clone and pass it through NF_HOOK(), act on the original skb
       based on the result
     - somehow signal to the caller from the okfn() that it was called,
       meaning the skb is ok to be passed, which this patch is trying to
       implement via returning 1 from the bridge link-local okfn()
    
    Note that we rely on the fact that NF_QUEUE/STOLEN would return 0 and
    drop/error would return < 0 thus the okfn() is called only when the
    return was 1, so we signal to the caller that it was called by preserving
    the return value from nf_hook().

    failover: allow name change on IFF_UP slave interfaces
    
    [ Upstream commit 8065a779f17e94536a1c4dcee4f9d88011672f97 ]
    
    When a netdev appears through hot plug then gets enslaved by a failover
    master that is already up and running, the slave will be opened
    right away after getting enslaved. Today there's a race that userspace
    (udev) may fail to rename the slave if the kernel (net_failover)
    opens the slave earlier than when the userspace rename happens.
    Unlike bond or team, the primary slave of failover can't be renamed by
    userspace ahead of time, since the kernel initiated auto-enslavement is
    unable to, or rather, is never meant to be synchronized with the rename
    request from userspace.
    
    As the failover slave interfaces are not designed to be operated
    directly by userspace apps: IP configuration, filter rules with
    regard to network traffic passing and etc., should all be done on master
    interface. In general, userspace apps only care about the
    name of master interface, while slave names are less important as long
    as admin users can see reliable names that may carry
    other information describing the netdev. For e.g., they can infer that
    "ens3nsby" is a standby slave of "ens3", while for a
    name like "eth0" they can't tell which master it belongs to.
    
    Historically the name of IFF_UP interface can't be changed because
    there might be admin script or management software that is already
    relying on such behavior and assumes that the slave name can't be
    changed once UP. But failover is special: with the in-kernel
    auto-enslavement mechanism, the userspace expectation for device
    enumeration and bring-up order is already broken. Previously initramfs
    and various userspace config tools were modified to bypass failover
    slaves because of auto-enslavement and duplicate MAC address. Similarly,
    in case that users care about seeing reliable slave name, the new type
    of failover slaves needs to be taken care of specifically in userspace
    anyway.
    
    It's less risky to lift up the rename restriction on failover slave
    which is already UP. Although it's possible this change may potentially
    break userspace component (most likely configuration scripts or
    management software) that assumes slave name can't be changed while
    UP, it's relatively a limited and controllable set among all userspace
    components, which can be fixed specifically to listen for the rename
    events on failover slaves. Userspace component interacting with slaves
    is expected to be changed to operate on failover master interface
    instead, as the failover slave is dynamic in nature which may come and
    go at any point.  The goal is to make the role of failover slaves less
    relevant, and userspace components should only deal with failover master
    in the long run.

    bonding: fix event handling for stacked bonds
    
    [ Upstream commit 92480b3977fd3884649d404cbbaf839b70035699 ]
    
    When a bond is enslaved to another bond, bond_netdev_event() only
    handles the event as if the bond is a master, and skips treating the
    bond as a slave.
    
    This leads to a refcount leak on the slave, since we don't remove the
    adjacency to its master and the master holds a reference on the slave.
    
    Reproducer:
      ip link add bondL type bond
      ip link add bondU type bond
      ip link set bondL master bondU
