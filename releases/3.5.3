    pmac_zilog,kdb: Fix console poll hook to return instead of loop
    
    commit 38f8eefccf3a23c4058a570fa2938a4f553cf8e0 upstream.
    
    kdb <-> kgdb transitioning does not work properly with this UART
    driver because the get character routine loops indefinitely as opposed
    to returning NO_POLL_CHAR per the expectation of the KDB I/O driver
    API.
    
    The symptom is a kernel hang when trying to switch debug modes.

    KVM: x86: apply kvmclock offset to guest wall clock time
    
    (cherry picked from commit 4b6486659a7defef82ea51b276024b3aa357fefc)
    
    When a guest migrates to a new host, the system time difference from the
    previous host is used in the updates to the kvmclock system time visible
    to the guest, resulting in a continuation of correct kvmclock based guest
    timekeeping.
    
    The wall clock component of the kvmclock provided time is currently not
    updated with this same time offset. Since the Linux guest caches the
    wall clock based time, this discrepency is not noticed until the guest is
    rebooted. After reboot the guest's time calculations are off.
    
    This patch adjusts the wall clock by the kvmclock_offset, resulting in
    correct guest time after a reboot.

    usb: gadget: u_ether: fix kworker 100% CPU issue with still used interfaces in eth_stop
    
    commit b1b552a69b8805e7e338074a9e8b670b4a795218 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue introduced by patch:
    
        72c973d usb: gadget: add usb_endpoint_descriptor to struct usb_ep
    
    Without this patch we see a kworker taking 100% CPU, after this sequence:
    
    - Connect gadget to a windows host
    - load g_ether
    - ifconfig up <ip>; ifconfig down; ifconfig up
    - ping <windows host>
    
    The "ifconfig down" results in calling eth_stop(), which will call
    usb_ep_disable() and, if the carrier is still ok, usb_ep_enable():
    
             usb_ep_disable(link->in_ep);
             usb_ep_disable(link->out_ep);
             if (netif_carrier_ok(net)) {
                     usb_ep_enable(link->in_ep);
                     usb_ep_enable(link->out_ep);
             }
    
    The ep should stay enabled, but will not, as ep_disable set the desc
    pointer to NULL, therefore the subsequent ep_enable will fail. This leads
    to permanent rescheduling of the eth_work() worker as usb_ep_queue()
    (called by the worker) will fail due to the unconfigured endpoint.
    
    We fix this issue by saving the ep descriptors and re-assign them before
    usb_ep_enable().

    commit c4e00daaa96d3a0786f1f4fe6456281c60ef9a16 changed __dev_printk

    prefix of dev_dbg(dev,..), but not dev_dbg(NULL,..) or pr_debug(..),
    which is why it wasnt noticed sooner.
    
    When dev==NULL, __dev_printk() just calls printk(), which just works.
    But otherwise, it assumed that level was always a string like "<L>"
    and just plucked out the 'L', ignoring the rest.  However,
    dynamic_emit_prefix() adds "[tid] module:func:line:" to the string,
    those additions all got lost.

    xhci: Fix bug after deq ptr set to link TRB.
    
    commit 50d0206fcaea3e736f912fd5b00ec6233fb4ce44 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a particularly nasty bug that was revealed by the ring
    expansion patches.  The bug has been present since the very beginning of
    the xHCI driver history, and could have caused general protection faults
    from bad memory accesses.
    
    The first thing to note is that a Set TR Dequeue Pointer command can
    move the dequeue pointer to a link TRB, if the canceled or stalled
    transfer TD ended just before a link TRB.  The function to increment the
    dequeue pointer, inc_deq, was written before cancellation and stall
    support was added.  It assumed that the dequeue pointer could never
    point to a link TRB.  It would unconditionally increment the dequeue
    pointer at the start of the function, check if the pointer was now on a
    link TRB, and move it to the top of the next segment if so.
    
    This means that if a Set TR Dequeue Point command moved the dequeue
    pointer to a link TRB, a subsequent call to inc_deq() would move the
    pointer off the segment and into la-la-land.  It would then read from
    that memory to determine if it was a link TRB.  Other functions would
    often call inc_deq() until the dequeue pointer matched some other
    pointer, which means this function would quite happily read all of
    system memory before wrapping around to the right pointer value.
    
    Often, there would be another endpoint segment from a different ring
    allocated from the same DMA pool, which would be contiguous to the
    segment inc_deq just stepped off of.  inc_deq would eventually find the
    link TRB in that segment, and blindly move the dequeue pointer back to
    the top of the correct ring segment.
    
    The only reason the original code worked at all is because there was
    only one ring segment.  With the ring expansion patches, the dequeue
    pointer would eventually wrap into place, but the dequeue segment would
    be out-of-sync.  On the second TD after the dequeue pointer was moved to
    a link TRB, trb_in_td() would fail (because the dequeue pointer and
    dequeue segment were out-of-sync), and this message would appear:
    
    ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD
    
    This fixes bugzilla entry 4333 (option-based modem unhappy on USB 3.0
    port: "Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD", "rejecting
    I/O to offline device"),
    
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43333
    
    and possibly other general protection fault bugs as well.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31.  A separate
    patch will be created for kernels older than 3.4, since inc_deq was
    modified in 3.4 and this patch will not apply.

    xhci: Switch PPT ports to EHCI on shutdown.
    
    commit e95829f474f0db3a4d940cae1423783edd966027 upstream.
    
    The Intel desktop boards DH77EB and DH77DF have a hardware issue that
    can be worked around by BIOS.  If the USB ports are switched to xHCI on
    shutdown, the xHCI host will send a spurious interrupt, which will wake
    the system.  Some BIOS will work around this, but not all.
    
    The bug can be avoided if the USB ports are switched back to EHCI on
    shutdown.  The Intel Windows driver switches the ports back to EHCI, so
    change the Linux xHCI driver to do the same.
    
    Unfortunately, we can't tell the two effected boards apart from other
    working motherboards, because the vendors will change the DMI strings
    for the DH77EB and DH77DF boards to their own custom names.  One example
    is Compulab's mini-desktop, the Intense-PC.  Instead, key off the
    Panther Point xHCI host PCI vendor and device ID, and switch the ports
    over for all PPT xHCI hosts.
    
    The only impact this will have on non-effected boards is to add a couple
    hundred milliseconds delay on boot when the BIOS has to switch the ports
    over from EHCI to xHCI.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
    the commit 69e848c2090aebba5698a1620604c7dccb448684 "Intel xhci: Support

    xhci: Increase reset timeout for Renesas 720201 host.
    
    commit 22ceac191211cf6688b1bf6ecd93c8b6bf80ed9b upstream.
    
    The NEC/Renesas 720201 xHCI host controller does not complete its reset
    within 250 milliseconds.  In fact, it takes about 9 seconds to reset the
    host controller, and 1 second for the host to be ready for doorbell
    rings.  Extend the reset and CNR polling timeout to 10 seconds each.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that
    contain the commit 66d4eadd8d067269ea8fead1a50fe87c2979a80d "USB: xhci:

    xhci: Add Etron XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk.
    
    commit 5cb7df2b2d3afee7638b3ef23a5bcb89c6f07bd9 upstream.
    
    Gary reports that with recent kernels, he notices more xHCI driver
    warnings:
    
    xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: WARN Successful completion on short TX: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
    
    We think his Etron xHCI host controller may have the same buggy behavior
    as the Fresco Logic xHCI host.  When a short transfer is received, the
    host will mark the transfer as successfully completed when it should be
    marking it with a short completion.
    
    Fix this by turning on the XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk when the Etron
    host is discovered.  Note that Gary has revision 1, but if Etron fixes
    this bug in future revisions, the quirk will have no effect.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, that
    contain a backported version of commit
    1530bbc6272d9da1e39ef8e06190d42c13a02733 "xhci: Add new short TX quirk

    ext4: fix kernel BUG on large-scale rm -rf commands
    
    commit 89a4e48f8479f8145eca9698f39fe188c982212f upstream.
    
    Commit 968dee7722: "ext4: fix hole punch failure when depth is greater
    than 0" introduced a regression in v3.5.1/v3.6-rc1 which caused kernel
    crashes when users ran run "rm -rf" on large directory hierarchy on

    This could be reproduced as follows:
    
    The problem in commit 968dee7722 was that caused the variable 'i' to
    be left uninitialized if the truncate required more space than was
    available in the journal.  This resulted in the function
    ext4_ext_truncate_extend_restart() returning -EAGAIN, which caused
    ext4_ext_remove_space() to restart the truncate operation after
    starting a new jbd2 handle.

    ext4: don't call ext4_error while block group is locked
    
    commit 7a4c5de27efa4c2ecca87af0a3deea63446367e2 upstream.
    
    While in ext4_validate_block_bitmap(), if an block allocation bitmap
    is found to be invalid, we call ext4_error() while the block group is
    still locked.  This causes ext4_commit_super() to call a function
    which might sleep while in an atomic context.
    
    There's no need to keep the block group locked at this point, so hoist
    the ext4_error() call up to ext4_validate_block_bitmap() and release
    the block group spinlock before calling ext4_error().

    ext4: avoid kmemcheck complaint from reading uninitialized memory

    Commit 03179fe923 introduced a kmemcheck complaint in

    ext4: make sure the journal sb is written in ext4_clear_journal_err()
    
    commit d796c52ef0b71a988364f6109aeb63d79c5b116b upstream.
    
    After we transfer set the EXT4_ERROR_FS bit in the file system
    superblock, it's not enough to call jbd2_journal_clear_err() to clear
    the error indication from journal superblock --- we need to call
    jbd2_journal_update_sb_errno() as well.  Otherwise, when the root file
    system is mounted read-only, the journal is replayed, and the error
    indicator is transferred to the superblock --- but the s_errno field
    in the jbd2 superblock is left set (since although we cleared it in
    memory, we never flushed it out to disk).
    
    This can end up confusing e2fsck.  We should make e2fsck more robust
    in this case, but the kernel shouldn't be leaving things in this
    confused state, either.

    drm/radeon: do not reenable crtc after moving vram start address
    
    commit 81ee8fb6b52ec69eeed37fe7943446af1dccecc5 upstream.
    
    It seems we can not update the crtc scanout address. After disabling
    crtc, update to base address do not take effect after crtc being
    reenable leading to at least frame being scanout from the old crtc
    base address. Disabling crtc display request lead to same behavior.
    
    So after changing the vram address if we don't keep crtc disabled
    we will have the GPU trying to read some random system memory address
    with some iommu this will broke the crtc engine and will lead to
    broken display and iommu error message.
    
    So to avoid this, disable crtc. For flicker less boot we will need
    to avoid moving the vram start address.
    
    This patch should also fix :

    drm/i915: reorder edp disabling to fix ivb MacBook Air
    
    commit 35a38556d900b9cb5dfa2529c93944b847f8a8a4 upstream.
    
    eDP is tons of fun. It turns out that at least the new MacBook Air 5,1
    model absolutely doesn't like the new force vdd dance we've introduced
    in
    
    commit 6cb49835da0426f69a2931bc2a0a8156344b0e41

        drm/i915: enable vdd when switching off the eDP panel
    
    But that patch also tried to fix some neat edp sequence issue with the
    force_vdd timings. Closer inspection reveals that we've raised
    force_vdd only to do the aux channel communication dp_sink_dpms. If we
    move the edp_panel_off below that, we don't need any force_vdd for the
    disable sequence, which makes the Air happy.
    
    Unfortunately the reporter of the original bug that the above commit
    fixed is travelling, so we can't test whether this regresses things.
    But my theory is that since we don't check for any power-off ->
    force_vdd-on delays in edp_panel_vdd_on, this was the actual
    root-cause of this failure. With that force_vdd dance completely
    eliminated, I'm hopeful the original bug stays fixed, too.
    
    For reference the old bug, which hopefully doesn't get broken by this:
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43163
    
    In any case, regression fixers win over plain bugfixes, so this needs
    to go in asap.
    
    v2: The crucial pieces seems to be to clear the force_vdd flag
    uncoditionally, too, in edp_panel_off. Looks like this is left behind
    by the firmware somehow.
    
    v3: The Apple firmware seems to switch off the panel on it's own, hence
    we still need to keep force_vdd on, but properly clear it when switching
    the panel off.

    drm/i915: correctly order the ring init sequence
    
    commit 0d8957c8a90bbb5d34fab9a304459448a5131e06 upstream.
    
    We may only start to set up the new register values after having
    confirmed that the ring is truely off. Otherwise the hw might lose the
    newly written register values. This is caught later on in the init
    sequence, when we check whether the register writes have stuck.

    drm/i915: prefer wide & slow to fast & narrow in DP configs
    
    commit 2514bc510d0c3aadcc5204056bb440fa36845147 upstream.
    
    High frequency link configurations have the potential to cause trouble
    with long and/or cheap cables, so prefer slow and wide configurations
    instead.  This patch has the potential to cause trouble for eDP
    configurations that lie about available lanes, so if we run into that we
    can make it conditional on eDP.

    xen/p2m: Reserve 8MB of _brk space for P2M leafs when populating back.
    
    commit 5bc6f9888db5739abfa0cae279b4b442e4db8049 upstream.
    
    When we release pages back during bootup:
    
    Freeing  9d-100 pfn range: 99 pages freed
    Freeing  9cf36-9d0d2 pfn range: 412 pages freed
    Freeing  9f6bd-9f6bf pfn range: 2 pages freed
    Freeing  9f714-9f7bf pfn range: 171 pages freed
    Freeing  9f7e0-9f7ff pfn range: 31 pages freed
    Freeing  9f800-100000 pfn range: 395264 pages freed
    Released 395979 pages of unused memory
    
    We then try to populate those pages back. In the P2M tree however
    the space for those leafs must be reserved - as such we use extend_brk.
    We reserve 8MB of _brk space, which means we can fit over
    1048576 PFNs - which is more than we should ever need.
    
    Without this, on certain compilation of the kernel we would hit:
    
    (XEN) domain_crash_sync called from entry.S
    (XEN) CPU:    0

    .. which is extend_brk hitting a BUG_ON.
    
    Interestingly enough, most of the time we are not going to hit this
    b/c the _brk space is quite large (v3.5):
     ffffffff81a25000 B __brk_base
     ffffffff81e43000 B __brk_limit
    = ~4MB.
    
    vs earlier kernels (with this back-ported), the space is smaller:
     ffffffff81a25000 B __brk_base
     ffffffff81a7b000 B __brk_limit
    = 344 kBytes.
    
    where we would certainly hit this and hit extend_brk.
    
    Note that git commit c3d93f880197953f86ab90d9da4744e926b38e33
    (xen: populate correct number of pages when across mem boundary (v2))
    exposed this bug).
    
    [v1: Made it 8MB of _brk space instead of 4MB per Jan's suggestion]

    fuse: verify all ioctl retry iov elements
    
    commit fb6ccff667712c46b4501b920ea73a326e49626a upstream.
    
    Commit 7572777eef78ebdee1ecb7c258c0ef94d35bad16 attempted to verify that
    the total iovec from the client doesn't overflow iov_length() but it
    only checked the first element.  The iovec could still overflow by
    starting with a small element.  The obvious fix is to check all the
    elements.
    
    The overflow case doesn't look dangerous to the kernel as the copy is
    limited by the length after the overflow.  This fix restores the
    intention of returning an error instead of successfully copying less
    than the iovec represented.
    
    I found this by code inspection.  I built it but don't have a test case.
    I'm cc:ing stable because the initial commit did as well.

    dma: imx-dma: Fix kernel crash due to missing clock conversion
    
    commit a2367db2ec5e7fc6fe93e221e0fcdee81b053daf upstream.

    The original code was misported from the X driver,
    
    a) an int went to unsigned int, breaking the downward counting testm code
    b) the port did the vco/computed clock bits completely wrong.
    
    This fixes an infinite loop on modprobe on some Dell servers with the G200ER

    s390/compat: fix mmap compat system calls
    
    commit e85871218513c54f7dfdb6009043cb638f2fecbe upstream.
    
    The native 31 bit and the compat behaviour for the mmap system calls differ:
    
    In native 31 bit mode the passed in address for the mmap system call will be
    unmodified passed to sys_mmap_pgoff().
    In compat mode however the passed in address will be modified with
    compat_ptr() which masks out the most significant bit.
    
    The result is that in native 31 bit mode each mmap request (with MAP_FIXED)
    will fail where the most significat bit is set, while in compat mode it
    may succeed.
    
    This odd behaviour was introduced with d3815898 "[S390] mmap: add missing
    compat_ptr conversion to both mmap compat syscalls".
    
    To restore a consistent behaviour accross native and compat mode this
    patch functionally reverts the above mentioned commit.
