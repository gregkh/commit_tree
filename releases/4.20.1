    MIPS: Only include mmzone.h when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y
    
    commit 66a4059ba72c23ae74a7c702894ff76c4b7eac1f upstream.
    
    MIPS' asm/mmzone.h includes the machine/platform mmzone.h
    unconditionally, but since commit bb53fdf395ee ("MIPS: c-r4k: Add
    r4k_blast_scache_node for Loongson-3") is included by asm/rk4cache.h for
    all r4k-style configs regardless of CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES.
    
    This is problematic when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=n because both the
    loongson3 & ip27 mmzone.h headers unconditionally define the NODE_DATA
    preprocessor macro which is aready defined by linux/mmzone.h, resulting
    in the following build error:
    
      In file included from ./arch/mips/include/asm/mmzone.h:10,
                       from ./arch/mips/include/asm/r4kcache.h:23,
                       from arch/mips/mm/c-r4k.c:33:
      ./arch/mips/include/asm/mach-loongson64/mmzone.h:48: error: "NODE_DATA" redefined [-Werror]
       #define NODE_DATA(n)  (&__node_data[(n)]->pglist)
    
      In file included from ./include/linux/topology.h:32,
                       from ./include/linux/irq.h:19,
                       from ./include/asm-generic/hardirq.h:13,
                       from ./arch/mips/include/asm/hardirq.h:16,
                       from ./include/linux/hardirq.h:9,
                       from arch/mips/mm/c-r4k.c:11:
      ./include/linux/mmzone.h:907: note: this is the location of the previous definition
       #define NODE_DATA(nid)  (&contig_page_data)
    
    Resolve this by only including the machine mmzone.h when
    CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y, which also removes the need for the empty
    mach-generic version of the header which we delete.

    machines with PA8500-PA8700 CPUs. The problem is, that for such machines

    before applying any alternative patches, didn't used the correctly
    hugepage-aligned addresses to remap the kernel text read-writeable.

    arm64: compat: Avoid sending SIGILL for unallocated syscall numbers
    
    commit 169113ece0f29ebe884a6cfcf57c1ace04d8a36a upstream.
    
    The ARM Linux kernel handles the EABI syscall numbers as follows:
    
      0           - NR_SYSCALLS-1   : Invoke syscall via syscall table
      NR_SYSCALLS - 0xeffff         : -ENOSYS (to be allocated in future)
      0xf0000     - 0xf07ff         : Private syscall or -ENOSYS if not allocated
      > 0xf07ff                     : SIGILL
    
    Our compat code gets this wrong and ends up sending SIGILL in response
    to all syscalls greater than NR_SYSCALLS which have a value greater
    than 0x7ff in the bottom 16 bits.
    
    Fix this by defining the end of the ARM private syscall region and
    checking the syscall number against that directly. Update the comment
    while we're at it.

    iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Fix big-endian CMD_SYNC writes
    
    commit 3cd508a8c1379427afb5e16c2e0a7c986d907853 upstream.
    
    When we insert the sync sequence number into the CMD_SYNC.MSIData field,
    we do so in CPU-native byte order, before writing out the whole command
    as explicitly little-endian dwords. Thus on big-endian systems, the SMMU
    will receive and write back a byteswapped version of sync_nr, which would
    be perfect if it were targeting a similarly-little-endian ITS, but since
    it's actually writing back to memory being polled by the CPUs, they're
    going to end up seeing the wrong thing.
    
    Since the SMMU doesn't care what the MSIData actually contains, the
    minimal-overhead solution is to simply add an extra byteswap initially,
    such that it then writes back the big-endian format directly.

    KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Fix off-by-one bug in vgic_get_irq()
    
    commit c23b2e6fc4ca346018618266bcabd335c0a8a49e upstream.
    
    When using the nospec API, it should be taken into account that:
    
    "...if the CPU speculates past the bounds check then
     * array_index_nospec() will clamp the index within the range of [0,
     * size)."
    
    The above is part of the header for macro array_index_nospec() in
    linux/nospec.h
    
    Now, in this particular case, if intid evaluates to exactly VGIC_MAX_SPI
    or to exaclty VGIC_MAX_PRIVATE, the array_index_nospec() macro ends up
    returning VGIC_MAX_SPI - 1 or VGIC_MAX_PRIVATE - 1 respectively, instead
    of VGIC_MAX_SPI or VGIC_MAX_PRIVATE, which, based on the original logic:
    
            /* SGIs and PPIs */
            if (intid <= VGIC_MAX_PRIVATE)
                    return &vcpu->arch.vgic_cpu.private_irqs[intid];
    
            /* SPIs */
            if (intid <= VGIC_MAX_SPI)
                    return &kvm->arch.vgic.spis[intid - VGIC_NR_PRIVATE_IRQS];
    
    are valid values for intid.
    
    Fix this by calling array_index_nospec() macro with VGIC_MAX_PRIVATE + 1
    and VGIC_MAX_SPI + 1 as arguments for its parameter size.

    KVM: arm/arm64: Fix VMID alloc race by reverting to lock-less
    
    commit fb544d1ca65a89f7a3895f7531221ceeed74ada7 upstream.
    
    We recently addressed a VMID generation race by introducing a read/write
    lock around accesses and updates to the vmid generation values.
    
    However, kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run() also calls need_new_vmid_gen() but
    does so without taking the read lock.
    
    As far as I can tell, this can lead to the same kind of race:
    
      VM 0, VCPU 0                  VM 0, VCPU 1
      ------------                  ------------
      update_vttbr (vmid 254)
                                    update_vttbr (vmid 1) // roll over
                                    read_lock(kvm_vmid_lock);
                                    force_vm_exit()
      local_irq_disable
      need_new_vmid_gen == false //because vmid gen matches
    
      enter_guest (vmid 254)
                                    kvm_arch.vttbr = <PGD>:<VMID 1>
                                    read_unlock(kvm_vmid_lock);
    
                                    enter_guest (vmid 1)
    
    Which results in running two VCPUs in the same VM with different VMIDs
    and (even worse) other VCPUs from other VMs could now allocate clashing
    VMID 254 from the new generation as long as VCPU 0 is not exiting.
    
    Attempt to solve this by making sure vttbr is updated before another CPU
    can observe the updated VMID generation.

    commit 2e2f6c3c0b08eed3fcf7de3c7684c940451bdeb1 upstream.
    
    To change the active state of an MMIO, halt is requested for all vcpus of
    the affected guest before modifying the IRQ state. This is done by calling
    cond_resched_lock() in vgic_mmio_change_active(). However interrupts are
    disabled at this point and we cannot reschedule a vcpu.
    
    We actually don't need any of this, as kvm_arm_halt_guest ensures that
    all the other vcpus are out of the guest. Let's just drop that useless
    code.

    `struct rtc_time', and is already correctly handled on alarm writes to
    the RTC.
    
    It was correct up until commit 48e9766726eb ("drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t80.c:

    ARM: dts: exynos: Specify I2S assigned clocks in proper node
    
    commit 8ac686d7dfed721102860ff2571e6b9f529ae81a upstream.
    
    The assigned parent clocks should be normally specified in the consumer
    device's DT node, this ensures respective driver always sees correct clock
    settings when required.
    
    This patch fixes regression in audio subsystem on Odroid XU3/XU4 boards
    that appeared after commits:
    
    commit 647d04f8e07a ("ASoC: samsung: i2s: Ensure the RCLK rate is properly determined")
    commit 995e73e55f46 ("ASoC: samsung: i2s: Fix rclk_srcrate handling")
    commit 48279c53fd1d ("ASoC: samsung: i2s: Prevent external abort on exynos5433 I2S1 access")
    
    Without this patch the driver gets wrong clock as the I2S function clock
    (op_clk) in probe() and effectively the clock which is finally assigned
    from DT is not being enabled/disabled in the runtime resume/suspend ops.
    
    Without the above listed commits the EXYNOS_I2S_BUS clock was always set
    as parent of CLK_I2S_RCLK_SRC regardless of DT settings so there was no issue
    with not enabled EXYNOS_SCLK_I2S.

    arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Force VM halt when changing the active state of GICv3 PPIs/SGIs
    
    commit 107352a24900fb458152b92a4e72fbdc83fd5510 upstream.
    
    We currently only halt the guest when a vCPU messes with the active
    state of an SPI. This is perfectly fine for GICv2, but isn't enough
    for GICv3, where all vCPUs can access the state of any other vCPU.
    
    Let's broaden the condition to include any GICv3 interrupt that
    has an active state (i.e. all but LPIs).

    arm64: KVM: Avoid setting the upper 32 bits of VTCR_EL2 to 1
    
    commit df655b75c43fba0f2621680ab261083297fd6d16 upstream.
    
    Although bit 31 of VTCR_EL2 is RES1, we inadvertently end up setting all
    of the upper 32 bits to 1 as well because we define VTCR_EL2_RES1 as
    signed, which is sign-extended when assigning to kvm->arch.vtcr.
    
    Lucky for us, the architecture currently treats these upper bits as RES0
    so, whilst we've been naughty, we haven't set fire to anything yet.

    CIFS: use the correct length when pinning memory for direct I/O for write
    
    commit b6bc8a7b993e62f82415a5e3e4a6469e80fea19c upstream.
    
    The current code attempts to pin memory using the largest possible wsize
    based on the currect SMB credits. This doesn't cause kernel oops but this
    is not optimal as we may pin more pages then actually needed.
    
    Fix this by only pinning what are needed for doing this write I/O.

    CIFS: Fix error mapping for SMB2_LOCK command which caused OFD lock problem
    
    commit 9a596f5b39593414c0ec80f71b94a226286f084e upstream.
    
    While resolving a bug with locks on samba shares found a strange behavior.
    When a file locked by one node and we trying to lock it from another node
    it fail with errno 5 (EIO) but in that case errno must be set to
    (EACCES | EAGAIN).
    This isn't happening when we try to lock file second time on same node.
    In this case it returns EACCES as expected.
    Also this issue not reproduces when we use SMB1 protocol (vers=1.0 in
    mount options).
    
    Further investigation showed that the mapping from status_to_posix_error
    is different for SMB1 and SMB2+ implementations.
    For SMB1 mapping is [NT_STATUS_LOCK_NOT_GRANTED to ERRlock]
    (See fs/cifs/netmisc.c line 66)
    but for SMB2+ mapping is [STATUS_LOCK_NOT_GRANTED to -EIO]
    (see fs/cifs/smb2maperror.c line 383)
    
    Quick changes in SMB2+ mapping from EIO to EACCES has fixed issue.

    MIPS: Expand MIPS32 ASIDs to 64 bits
    
    commit ff4dd232ec45a0e45ea69f28f069f2ab22b4908a upstream.
    
    ASIDs have always been stored as unsigned longs, ie. 32 bits on MIPS32
    kernels. This is problematic because it is feasible for the ASID version
    to overflow & wrap around to zero.
    
    We currently attempt to handle this overflow by simply setting the ASID
    version to 1, using asid_first_version(), but we make no attempt to
    account for the fact that there may be mm_structs with stale ASIDs that
    have versions which we now reuse due to the overflow & wrap around.
    
    Encountering this requires that:
    
      1) A struct mm_struct X is active on CPU A using ASID (V,n).
    
      2) That mm is not used on CPU A for the length of time that it takes
         for CPU A's asid_cache to overflow & wrap around to the same
         version V that the mm had in step 1. During this time tasks using
         the mm could either be sleeping or only scheduled on other CPUs.
    
      3) Some other mm Y becomes active on CPU A and is allocated the same
         ASID (V,n).
    
      4) mm X now becomes active on CPU A again, and now incorrectly has the
         same ASID as mm Y.
    
    Where struct mm_struct ASIDs are represented above in the format
    (version, EntryHi.ASID), and on a typical MIPS32 system version will be
    24 bits wide & EntryHi.ASID will be 8 bits wide.
    
    The length of time required in step 2 is highly dependent upon the CPU &
    workload, but for a hypothetical 2GHz CPU running a workload which
    generates a new ASID every 10000 cycles this period is around 248 days.
    Due to this long period of time & the fact that tasks need to be
    scheduled in just the right (or wrong, depending upon your inclination)
    way, this is obviously a difficult bug to encounter but it's entirely
    possible as evidenced by reports.
    
    In order to fix this, simply extend ASIDs to 64 bits even on MIPS32
    builds. This will extend the period of time required for the
    hypothetical system above to encounter the problem from 28 days to
    around 3 trillion years, which feels safely outside of the realms of
    possibility.
    
    The cost of this is slightly more generated code in some commonly
    executed paths, but this is pretty minimal:
    
                             | Code Size Gain | Percentage
      -----------------------|----------------|-------------
        decstation_defconfig |           +270 | +0.00%
            32r2el_defconfig |           +652 | +0.01%
            32r6el_defconfig |          +1000 | +0.01%
    
    I have been unable to measure any change in performance of the LMbench
    lat_ctx or lat_proc tests resulting from the 64b ASIDs on either
    32r2el_defconfig+interAptiv or 32r6el_defconfig+I6500 systems.

    MIPS: Align kernel load address to 64KB
    
    commit bec0de4cfad21bd284dbddee016ed1767a5d2823 upstream.
    
    KEXEC needs the new kernel's load address to be aligned on a page
    boundary (see sanity_check_segment_list()), but on MIPS the default
    vmlinuz load address is only explicitly aligned to 16 bytes.
    
    Since the largest PAGE_SIZE supported by MIPS kernels is 64KB, increase
    the alignment calculated by calc_vmlinuz_load_addr to 64KB.

    MIPS: math-emu: Write-protect delay slot emulation pages
    
    commit adcc81f148d733b7e8e641300c5590a2cdc13bf3 upstream.
    
    Mapping the delay slot emulation page as both writeable & executable
    presents a security risk, in that if an exploit can write to & jump into
    the page then it can be used as an easy way to execute arbitrary code.
    
    Prevent this by mapping the page read-only for userland, and using
    access_process_vm() with the FOLL_FORCE flag to write to it from
    mips_dsemul().
    
    This will likely be less efficient due to copy_to_user_page() performing
    cache maintenance on a whole page, rather than a single line as in the
    previous use of flush_cache_sigtramp(). However this delay slot
    emulation code ought not to be running in any performance critical paths
    anyway so this isn't really a problem, and we can probably do better in
    copy_to_user_page() anyway in future.
    
    A major advantage of this approach is that the fix is small & simple to
    backport to stable kernels.

    If the tx_ignore_nack_until_eom error injection was activated,
    then tx_nacked was never set instead of setting it when the last
    byte of the message was transmitted.
    
    As a result the transmit was marked as OK, when it should have
    been NACKed.
    
    Modify the condition so that it always sets tx_nacked when the
    last byte of the message was transmitted.

    media: cec: keep track of outstanding transmits
    
    commit 32804fcb612bf867034a093f459415e485cf044b upstream.
    
    I noticed that repeatedly running 'cec-ctl --playback' would occasionally
    select 'Playback Device 2' instead of 'Playback Device 1', even though there
    were no other Playback devices in the HDMI topology. This happened both with
    'real' hardware and with the vivid CEC emulation, suggesting that this was an
    issue in the core code that claims a logical address.
    
    What 'cec-ctl --playback' does is to first clear all existing logical addresses,
    and immediately after that configure the new desired device type.
    
    The core code will poll the logical addresses trying to find a free address.
    When found it will issue a few standard messages as per the CEC spec and return.
    Those messages are queued up and will be transmitted asynchronously.
    
    What happens is that if you run two 'cec-ctl --playback' commands in quick
    succession, there is still a message of the first cec-ctl command being transmitted
    when you reconfigure the adapter again in the second cec-ctl command.
    
    When the logical addresses are cleared, then all information about outstanding
    transmits inside the CEC core is also cleared, and the core is no longer aware
    that there is still a transmit in flight.
    
    When the hardware finishes the transmit it calls transmit_done and the CEC core
    thinks it is actually in response of a POLL messages that is trying to find a
    free logical address. The result of all this is that the core thinks that the
    logical address for Playback Device 1 is in use, when it is really an earlier
    transmit that ended.
    
    The main transmit thread looks at adap->transmitting to check if a transmit
    is in progress, but that is set to NULL when the adapter is unconfigured.
    adap->transmitting represents the view of userspace, not that of the hardware.
    So when unconfiguring the adapter the message is marked aborted from the point
    of view of userspace, but seen from the PoV of the hardware it is still ongoing.
    
    So introduce a new bool transmit_in_progress that represents the hardware state
    and use that instead of adap->transmitting. Now the CEC core waits until the
    hardware finishes the transmit before starting a new transmit.

    f2fs: fix validation of the block count in sanity_check_raw_super
    
    commit 88960068f25fcc3759455d85460234dcc9d43fef upstream.
    
    Treat "block_count" from struct f2fs_super_block as 64-bit little endian
    value in sanity_check_raw_super() because struct f2fs_super_block
    declares "block_count" as "__le64".
    
    This fixes a bug where the superblock validation fails on big endian
    devices with the following error:
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Wrong segment_count / block_count (61439 > 0)
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Can't find valid F2FS filesystem in 1th superblock
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Wrong segment_count / block_count (61439 > 0)
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Can't find valid F2FS filesystem in 2th superblock
    As result of this the partition cannot be mounted.
    
    With this patch applied the superblock validation works fine and the
    partition can be mounted again:
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Mounted with checkpoint version = 7c84
    
    My little endian x86-64 hardware was able to mount the partition without
    this fix.
    To confirm that mounting f2fs filesystems works on big endian machines
    again I tested this on a 32-bit MIPS big endian (lantiq) device.

    powerpc/tm: Unset MSR[TS] if not recheckpointing
    
    commit 6f5b9f018f4c7686fd944d920209d1382d320e4e upstream.
    
    There is a TM Bad Thing bug that can be caused when you return from a
    signal context in a suspended transaction but with ucontext MSR[TS] unset.
    
    This forces regs->msr[TS] to be set at syscall entrance (since the CPU
    state is transactional). It also calls treclaim() to flush the transaction
    state, which is done based on the live (mfmsr) MSR state.
    
    Since user context MSR[TS] is not set, then restore_tm_sigcontexts() is not
    called, thus, not executing recheckpoint, keeping the CPU state as not
    transactional. When calling rfid, SRR1 will have MSR[TS] set, but the CPU
    state is non transactional, causing the TM Bad Thing with the following
    stack:

    KEYS: fix parsing invalid pkey info string
    
    commit 57b0e31453209d746c99e513d80b3d0c44a80891 upstream.
    
    We need to check the return value of match_token() for Opt_err before
    doing anything with it.
    
    [ Not only did the old "-1" value for Opt_err cause problems for the
      __test_and_set_bit(), as fixed in commit 94c13f66e13c ("security:
      don't use a negative Opt_err token index"), but accessing
      "args[0].from" is invalid for the Opt_err case, as pointed out by Eric
      later.  - Linus ]

    brcmfmac: Fix out of bounds memory access during fw load
    
    commit b72c51a58e6d63ef673ac96b8ab5bc98799c5f7b upstream.
    
    I ended up tracking down some rather nasty issues with f2fs (and other
    filesystem modules) constantly crashing on my kernel down to a
    combination of out of bounds memory accesses, one of which was coming
    from brcmfmac during module load:

    It appears that when trying to determine the length of the string in the
    alternate firmware path, we make the mistake of not handling the case
    where the firmware path is empty correctly. Since strlen(mp_path) can
    return 0, we'll end up accessing mp_path[-1] when the firmware_path
    isn't provided through the module arguments.
    
    So, fix this by just setting the end char to '\0' by default, and only
    changing it if we have a non-zero length. Additionally, use strnlen()
    with BRCMF_FW_ALTPATH_LEN instead of strlen() just to be extra safe.

    brcmfmac: fix roamoff=1 modparam
    
    commit 8c892df41500469729e0d662816300196e4f463d upstream.
    
    When the update_connect_param callback is set, nl80211 expects the flag
    WIPHY_FLAG_SUPPORTS_FW_ROAM to be set as well. However, this flag is
    only set when modparam roamoff=0, while the callback is set
    unconditionally. Since commit 7f9a3e150ec7 this causes a warning in
    wiphy_register, which breaks brcmfmac.
    
    Disable the update_connect_param callback when roamoff=0 to fix this.

    Btrfs: send, fix race with transaction commits that create snapshots
    
    commit be6821f82c3cc36e026f5afd10249988852b35ea upstream.
    
    If we create a snapshot of a snapshot currently being used by a send
    operation, we can end up with send failing unexpectedly (returning
    -ENOENT error to user space for example). The following diagram shows
    how this happens.

                                                                             -> modifies content of the

        -> uses an eb that now
           belongs to some other
           tree and no more matches
           the commit root of the
           snapshot, resuts will be
           unpredictable
    
    The consequences of this race can be various, and can lead to searches in
    the commit root performed by the send task failing unexpectedly (unable to
    find inode items, returning -ENOENT to user space, for example) or not
    failing because an inode item with the same number was added to the tree
    that reused the metadata extent, in which case send can behave incorrectly
    in the worst case or just fail later for some reason.
    
    Fix this by performing a copy of the commit root's extent buffer when doing
    a search in the context of a send operation.

    This was because btrfs_drop_snapshot depends on the root not being
    modified while it's dropping the snapshot.  It will unlock the root node
    (and really every node) as it walks down the tree, only to re-lock it
    when it needs to do something.  This is a problem because if we modify
    the tree we could cow a block in our path, which frees our reference to
    that block.  Then once we get back to that shared block we'll free our
    reference to it again, and get ENOENT when trying to lookup our extent
    reference to that block in __btrfs_free_extent.
    
    This is ultimately happening because we have delayed items left to be
    processed for our deleted snapshot _after_ all of the inodes are closed
    for the snapshot.  We only run the delayed inode item if we're deleting
    the inode, and even then we do not run the delayed insertions or delayed
    removals.  These can be run at any point after our final inode does its
    last iput, which is what triggers the snapshot deletion.  We can end up
    with the snapshot deletion happening and then have the delayed items run
    on that file system, resulting in the above problem.
    
    This problem has existed forever, however my patches made it much easier
    to hit as I wake up the cleaner much more often to deal with delayed
    iputs, which made us more likely to start the snapshot dropping work
    before the transaction commits, which is when the delayed items would
    generally be run.  Before, generally speaking, we would run the delayed
    items, commit the transaction, and wakeup the cleaner thread to start
    deleting snapshots, which means we were less likely to hit this problem.
    You could still hit it if you had multiple snapshots to be deleted and
    ended up with lots of delayed items, but it was definitely harder.
    
    Fix for now by simply running all the delayed items before starting to
    drop the snapshot.  We could make this smarter in the future by making
    the delayed items per-root, and then simply drop any delayed items for
    roots that we are going to delete.  But for now just a quick and easy
    solution is the safest.

    Btrfs: fix fsync of files with multiple hard links in new directories
    
    commit 41bd60676923822de1df2c50b3f9a10171f4338a upstream.
    
    The log tree has a long standing problem that when a file is fsync'ed we
    only check for new ancestors, created in the current transaction, by
    following only the hard link for which the fsync was issued. We follow the
    ancestors using the VFS' dget_parent() API. This means that if we create a
    new link for a file in a directory that is new (or in an any other new
    ancestor directory) and then fsync the file using an old hard link, we end
    up not logging the new ancestor, and on log replay that new hard link and
    ancestor do not exist. In some cases, involving renames, the file will not
    exist at all.
    
    Example:
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      mkdir /mnt/A
      touch /mnt/foo
      ln /mnt/foo /mnt/A/bar
      xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/foo
    
      <power failure>
    
    In this example after log replay only the hard link named 'foo' exists
    and directory A does not exist, which is unexpected. In other major linux
    filesystems, such as ext4, xfs and f2fs for example, both hard links exist
    and so does directory A after mounting again the filesystem.
    
    Checking if any new ancestors are new and need to be logged was added in
    2009 by commit 12fcfd22fe5b ("Btrfs: tree logging unlink/rename fixes"),
    however only for the ancestors of the hard link (dentry) for which the
    fsync was issued, instead of checking for all ancestors for all of the
    inode's hard links.
    
    So fix this by tracking the id of the last transaction where a hard link
    was created for an inode and then on fsync fallback to a full transaction
    commit when an inode has more than one hard link and at least one new hard
    link was created in the current transaction. This is the simplest solution
    since this is not a common use case (adding frequently hard links for
    which there's an ancestor created in the current transaction and then
    fsync the file). In case it ever becomes a common use case, a solution
    that consists of iterating the fs/subvol btree for each hard link and
    check if any ancestor is new, could be implemented.
    
    This solves many unexpected scenarios reported by Jayashree Mohan and
    Vijay Chidambaram, and for which there is a new test case for fstests
    under review.

    The file extent generation of the free space inode is equal to the last

    But the inode was created and its extents were preallocated in
    btrfs_save_ino_cache, there are no cow copies on disk.
    
    The preallocated extent is not yet in the extent tree, and
    btrfs_cross_ref_exist will ignore the -ENOENT returned by
    check_committed_ref, so we can directly write the inode to the disk.

    Btrfs: fix deadlock with memory reclaim during scrub
    
    commit a5fb11429167ee6ddeeacc554efaf5776b36433a upstream.
    
    When a transaction commit starts, it attempts to pause scrub and it blocks
    until the scrub is paused. So while the transaction is blocked waiting for
    scrub to pause, we can not do memory allocation with GFP_KERNEL from scrub,
    otherwise we risk getting into a deadlock with reclaim.
    
    Checking for scrub pause requests is done early at the beginning of the
    while loop of scrub_stripe() and later in the loop, scrub_extent() and
    scrub_raid56_parity() are called, which in turn call scrub_pages() and
    scrub_pages_for_parity() respectively. These last two functions do memory
    allocations using GFP_KERNEL. Same problem could happen while scrubbing
    the super blocks, since it calls scrub_pages().
    
    We also can not have any of the worker tasks, created by the scrub task,
    doing GFP_KERNEL allocations, because before pausing, the scrub task waits
    for all the worker tasks to complete (also done at scrub_stripe()).
    
    So make sure GFP_NOFS is used for the memory allocations because at any
    time a scrub pause request can happen from another task that started to
    commit a transaction.

    cdc-acm: fix abnormal DATA RX issue for Mediatek Preloader.
    
    commit eafb27fa5283599ce6c5492ea18cf636a28222bb upstream.
    
    Mediatek Preloader is a proprietary embedded boot loader for loading
    Little Kernel and Linux into device DRAM.
    
    This boot loader also handle firmware update. Mediatek Preloader will be
    enumerated as a virtual COM port when the device is connected to Windows
    or Linux OS via CDC-ACM class driver. When the USB enumeration has been
    done, Mediatek Preloader will send out handshake command "READY" to PC
    actively instead of waiting command from the download tool.
    
    Since Linux 4.12, the commit "tty: reset termios state on device
    registration" (93857edd9829e144acb6c7e72d593f6e01aead66) causes Mediatek
    Preloader receiving some abnoraml command like "READYXX" as it sent.
    This will be recognized as an incorrect response. The behavior change
    also causes the download handshake fail. This change only affects
    subsequent connects if the reconnected device happens to get the same minor
    number.
    
    By disabling the ECHO termios flag could avoid this problem. However, it
    cannot be done by user space configuration when download tool open
    /dev/ttyACM0. This is because the device running Mediatek Preloader will
    send handshake command "READY" immediately once the CDC-ACM driver is
    ready.
    
    This patch wants to fix above problem by introducing "DISABLE_ECHO"
    property in driver_info. When Mediatek Preloader is connected, the
    CDC-ACM driver could disable ECHO flag in termios to avoid the problem.

    binder: fix use-after-free due to ksys_close() during fdget()
    
    commit 80cd795630d6526ba729a089a435bf74a57af927 upstream.
    
    44d8047f1d8 ("binder: use standard functions to allocate fds")
    exposed a pre-existing issue in the binder driver.
    
    fdget() is used in ksys_ioctl() as a performance optimization.
    One of the rules associated with fdget() is that ksys_close() must
    not be called between the fdget() and the fdput(). There is a case
    where this requirement is not met in the binder driver which results
    in the reference count dropping to 0 when the device is still in
    use. This can result in use-after-free or other issues.
    
    If userpace has passed a file-descriptor for the binder driver using
    a BINDER_TYPE_FDA object, then kys_close() is called on it when
    handling a binder_ioctl(BC_FREE_BUFFER) command. This violates
    the assumptions for using fdget().
    
    The problem is fixed by deferring the close using task_work_add(). A
    new variant of __close_fd() was created that returns a struct file
    with a reference. The fput() is deferred instead of using ksys_close().

    cgroup: fix CSS_TASK_ITER_PROCS
    
    commit e9d81a1bc2c48ea9782e3e8b53875f419766ef47 upstream.
    
    CSS_TASK_ITER_PROCS implements process-only iteration by making
    css_task_iter_advance() skip tasks which aren't threadgroup leaders;
    however, when an iteration is started css_task_iter_start() calls the
    inner helper function css_task_iter_advance_css_set() instead of
    css_task_iter_advance().  As the helper doesn't have the skip logic,
    when the first task to visit is a non-leader thread, it doesn't get
    skipped correctly as shown in the following example.
    
      # ps -L 2030
        PID   LWP TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
       2030  2030 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread
       2030  2031 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread
      # mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b
      # echo threaded > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/cgroup.type
      # echo threaded > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b/cgroup.type
      # echo 2030 > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/cgroup.procs
      # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/cgroup.threads
      2030
      2031
      # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/x/cgroup.procs
      2030
      # echo 2030 > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b/cgroup.threads
      # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/x/cgroup.procs
      2031
      2030
    
    The last read of cgroup.procs is incorrectly showing non-leader 2031
    in cgroup.procs output.
    
    This can be fixed by updating css_task_iter_advance() to handle the
    first advance and css_task_iters_tart() to call
    css_task_iter_advance() instead of the inner helper.  After the fix,
    the same commands result in the following (correct) result:
    
      # ps -L 2062
        PID   LWP TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
       2062  2062 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread
       2062  2063 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread
      # mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b
      # echo threaded > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/cgroup.type
      # echo threaded > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b/cgroup.type

    Immediate packets sent to hardware should include the work
    request length in calculating the flits. WR occupy one flit and
    if not accounted result in invalid request which stalls the HW

    crypto: cavium/nitrox - fix a DMA pool free failure
    
    commit 7172122be6a4712d699da4d261f92aa5ab3a78b8 upstream.
    
    In crypto_alloc_context(), a DMA pool is allocated through dma_pool_alloc()
    to hold the crypto context. The meta data of the DMA pool, including the
    pool used for the allocation 'ndev->ctx_pool' and the base address of the
    DMA pool used by the device 'dma', are then stored to the beginning of the
    pool. These meta data are eventually used in crypto_free_context() to free
    the DMA pool through dma_pool_free(). However, given that the DMA pool can
    also be accessed by the device, a malicious device can modify these meta
    data, especially when the device is controlled to deploy an attack. This
    can cause an unexpected DMA pool free failure.
    
    To avoid the above issue, this patch introduces a new structure
    crypto_ctx_hdr and a new field chdr in the structure nitrox_crypto_ctx hold
    the meta data information of the DMA pool after the allocation. Note that
    the original structure ctx_hdr is not changed to ensure the compatibility.

    clk: sunxi-ng: Use u64 for calculation of NM rate
    
    commit 65b6657672388b72822e0367f06d41c1e3ffb5bb upstream.
    
    Allwinner H6 SoC has multiplier N range between 1 and 254. Since parent
    rate is 24MHz, intermediate result when calculating final rate easily
    overflows 32 bit variable.
    
    Because of that, introduce function for calculating clock rate which
    uses 64 bit variable for intermediate result.

    spi: bcm2835: Avoid finishing transfer prematurely in IRQ mode
    
    commit 56c1723426d3cfd4723bfbfce531d7b38bae6266 upstream.
    
    The IRQ handler bcm2835_spi_interrupt() first reads as much as possible
    from the RX FIFO, then writes as much as possible to the TX FIFO.
    Afterwards it decides whether the transfer is finished by checking if
    the TX FIFO is empty.
    
    If very few bytes were written to the TX FIFO, they may already have
    been transmitted by the time the FIFO's emptiness is checked.  As a
    result, the transfer will be declared finished and the chip will be
    reset without reading the corresponding received bytes from the RX FIFO.
    
    The odds of this happening increase with a high clock frequency (such
    that the TX FIFO drains quickly) and either passing "threadirqs" on the
    command line or enabling CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_BASE (such that the IRQ
    handler may be preempted between filling the TX FIFO and checking its
    emptiness).
    
    Fix by instead checking whether rx_len has reached zero, which means
    that the transfer has been received in full.  This is also more
    efficient as it avoids one bus read access per interrupt.  Note that
    bcm2835_spi_transfer_one_poll() likewise uses rx_len to determine
    whether the transfer has finished.

    spi: bcm2835: Fix book-keeping of DMA termination
    
    commit dbc944115eed48af110646992893dc43321368d8 upstream.
    
    If submission of a DMA TX transfer succeeds but submission of the
    corresponding RX transfer does not, the BCM2835 SPI driver terminates
    the TX transfer but neglects to reset the dma_pending flag to false.
    
    Thus, if the next transfer uses interrupt mode (because it is shorter
    than BCM2835_SPI_DMA_MIN_LENGTH) and runs into a timeout,
    dmaengine_terminate_all() will be called both for TX (once more) and
    for RX (which was never started in the first place).  Fix it.

    ext4: force inode writes when nfsd calls commit_metadata()
    
    commit fde872682e175743e0c3ef939c89e3c6008a1529 upstream.
    
    Some time back, nfsd switched from calling vfs_fsync() to using a new
    commit_metadata() hook in export_operations().  If the file system did
    not provide a commit_metadata() hook, it fell back to using
    sync_inode_metadata().  Unfortunately doesn't work on all file
    systems.  In particular, it doesn't work on ext4 due to how the inode
    gets journalled --- the VFS writeback code will not always call
    ext4_write_inode().
    
    So we need to provide our own ext4_nfs_commit_metdata() method which
    calls ext4_write_inode() directly.

    ext4: avoid declaring fs inconsistent due to invalid file handles
    
    commit 8a363970d1dc38c4ec4ad575c862f776f468d057 upstream.
    
    If we receive a file handle, either from NFS or open_by_handle_at(2),
    and it points at an inode which has not been initialized, and the file
    system has metadata checksums enabled, we shouldn't try to get the
    inode, discover the checksum is invalid, and then declare the file
    system as being inconsistent.
    
    This can be reproduced by creating a test file system via "mke2fs -t
    ext4 -O metadata_csum /tmp/foo.img 8M", mounting it, cd'ing into that
    directory, and then running the following program.
    
    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <fcntl.h>
    
    struct handle {
            struct file_handle fh;
            unsigned char fid[MAX_HANDLE_SZ];
    };
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
            struct handle h = {{8, 1 }, { 12, }};
    
            open_by_handle_at(AT_FDCWD, &h.fh, O_RDONLY);
            return 0;

    ext4: include terminating u32 in size of xattr entries when expanding inodes
    
    commit a805622a757b6d7f65def4141d29317d8e37b8a1 upstream.
    
    In ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea(), we calculate the total size of the
    xattr header, plus the xattr entries so we know how much of the
    beginning part of the xattrs to move when expanding the inode extra
    size.  We need to include the terminating u32 at the end of the xattr
    entries, or else if there is uninitialized, non-zero bytes after the
    xattr entries and before the xattr values, the list of xattr entries
    won't be properly terminated.

    ext4: add ext4_sb_bread() to disambiguate ENOMEM cases
    
    commit fb265c9cb49e2074ddcdd4de99728aefdd3b3592 upstream.
    
    Today, when sb_bread() returns NULL, this can either be because of an
    I/O error or because the system failed to allocate the buffer.  Since
    it's an old interface, changing would require changing many call
    sites.
    
    So instead we create our own ext4_sb_bread(), which also allows us to
    set the REQ_META flag.
    
    Also fixed a problem in the xattr code where a NULL return in a
    function could also mean that the xattr was not found, which could
    lead to the wrong error getting returned to userspace.

    ocxl: Fix endiannes bug in read_afu_name()
    
    commit 2f07229f02d4c55affccd11a61af4fd4b94dc436 upstream.
    
    The AFU Descriptor Template in the PCI config space has a Name Space
    field which is a 24 Byte ASCII character string of descriptive name
    space for the AFU. The OCXL driver read the string four characters at
    a time with pci_read_config_dword().
    
    This optimization is valid on a little-endian system since this is PCI,
    but a big-endian system ends up with each subset of four characters in
    reverse order.
    
    This could be fixed by switching to read characters one by one. Another
    option is to swap the bytes if we're big-endian.
    
    Go for the latter with le32_to_cpu().

    the same mm, it could be woken up by error. This is highly improbable
    though. The likely outcome of this is the NPU not finding the target
    thread and forcing the AFU into sending an interrupt, which userspace
    is supposed to handle anyway.

    perf pmu: Suppress potential format-truncation warning
    
    commit 11a64a05dc649815670b1be9fe63d205cb076401 upstream.
    
    Depending on which functions are inlined in util/pmu.c, the snprintf()
    calls in perf_pmu__parse_{scale,unit,per_pkg,snapshot}() might trigger a
    warning:
    
      util/pmu.c: In function 'pmu_aliases':
      util/pmu.c:178:31: error: '%s' directive output may be truncated writing up to 255 bytes into a region of size between 0 and 4095 [-Werror=format-truncation=]
        snprintf(path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s.unit", dir, name);
                                   ^~
    
    I found this when trying to build perf from Linux 3.16 with gcc 8.
    However I can reproduce the problem in mainline if I force
    __perf_pmu__new_alias() to be inlined.
    
    Suppress this by using scnprintf() as has been done elsewhere in perf.

    perf machine: Record if a arch has a single user/kernel address space
    
    commit ec1891afae740be581ecf5abc8bda74c4549203f upstream.
    
    Some architectures have a single address space for kernel and user
    addresses, which makes it possible to determine if an address is in
    kernel space or user space. Some don't, e.g.: sparc.
    
    Cache that info in perf_env so that, for instance, code needing to
    fallback failed symbol lookups at the kernel space in single address
    space arches can lookup at userspace.

    clocksource/drivers/arc_timer: Utilize generic sched_clock
    
    commit bf287607c80f24387fedb431a346dc67f25be12c upstream.
    
    It turned out we used to use default implementation of sched_clock()
    from kernel/sched/clock.c which was as precise as 1/HZ, i.e.
    by default we had 10 msec granularity of time measurement.
    
    Now given ARC built-in timers are clocked with the same frequency as
    CPU cores we may get much higher precision of time tracking.
    
    Thus we switch to generic sched_clock which really reads ARC hardware
    counters.
    
    This is especially helpful for measuring short events.
    That's what we used to have:
    ------------------------------>8------------------------
    $ perf stat /bin/sh -c /root/lmbench-master/bin/arc/hello > /dev/null
    
     Performance counter stats for '/bin/sh -c /root/lmbench-master/bin/arc/hello':
    
             10.000000      task-clock (msec)         #    2.832 CPUs utilized
                     1      context-switches          #    0.100 K/sec
                     1      cpu-migrations            #    0.100 K/sec
                    63      page-faults               #    0.006 M/sec
               3049480      cycles                    #    0.305 GHz

                256828      branches                  #   25.683 M/sec
                 27026      branch-misses             #   10.52% of all branches

    DRM: UDL: get rid of useless vblank initialization
    
    commit 32e932e37e6b6e13b66add307192c7ddd40a781d upstream.
    
    UDL doesn't support vblank functionality so we don't need to
    initialize vblank here (we are able to send page flip
    completion events even without vblank initialization)
    
    Moreover current drm_vblank_init call with num_crtcs > 0 causes
    sending DRM_EVENT_FLIP_COMPLETE event with zero timestamp every
    time. This breaks userspace apps (for example weston) which
    relies on timestamp value.

    platform-msi: Free descriptors in platform_msi_domain_free()
    
    commit 81b1e6e6a8590a19257e37a1633bec098d499c57 upstream.
    
    Since the addition of platform MSI support, there were two helpers
    supposed to allocate/free IRQs for a device:
    
        platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs()
        platform_msi_domain_free_irqs()
    
    In these helpers, IRQ descriptors are allocated in the "alloc" routine
    while they are freed in the "free" one.
    
    Later, two other helpers have been added to handle IRQ domains on top
    of MSI domains:
    
        platform_msi_domain_alloc()
        platform_msi_domain_free()
    
    Seen from the outside, the logic is pretty close with the former
    helpers and people used it with the same logic as before: a
    platform_msi_domain_alloc() call should be balanced with a
    platform_msi_domain_free() call. While this is probably what was
    intended to do, the platform_msi_domain_free() does not remove/free
    the IRQ descriptor(s) created/inserted in
    platform_msi_domain_alloc().
    
    One effect of such situation is that removing a module that requested
    an IRQ will let one orphaned IRQ descriptor (with an allocated MSI
    entry) in the device descriptors list. Next time the module will be
    inserted back, one will observe that the allocation will happen twice
    in the MSI domain, one time for the remaining descriptor, one time for
    the new one. It also has the side effect to quickly overshoot the
    maximum number of allocated MSI and then prevent any module requesting
    an interrupt in the same domain to be inserted anymore.
    
    This situation has been met with loops of insertion/removal of the
    mvpp2.ko module (requesting 15 MSIs each time).

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix race between kvm_unmap_hva_range and MMU mode switch
    
    commit 234ff0b729ad882d20f7996591a964965647addf upstream.
    
    Testing has revealed an occasional crash which appears to be caused
    by a race between kvmppc_switch_mmu_to_hpt and kvm_unmap_hva_range_hv.
    The symptom is a NULL pointer dereference in __find_linux_pte() called
    from kvm_unmap_radix() with kvm->arch.pgtable == NULL.
    
    Looking at kvmppc_switch_mmu_to_hpt(), it does indeed clear
    kvm->arch.pgtable (via kvmppc_free_radix()) before setting
    kvm->arch.radix to NULL, and there is nothing to prevent
    kvm_unmap_hva_range_hv() or the other MMU callback functions from
    being called concurrently with kvmppc_switch_mmu_to_hpt() or
    kvmppc_switch_mmu_to_radix().
    
    This patch therefore adds calls to spin_lock/unlock on the kvm->mmu_lock
    around the assignments to kvm->arch.radix, and makes sure that the
    partition-scoped radix tree or HPT is only freed after changing
    kvm->arch.radix.
    
    This also takes the kvm->mmu_lock in kvmppc_rmap_reset() to make sure
    that the clearing of each rmap array (one per memslot) doesn't happen
    concurrently with use of the array in the kvm_unmap_hva_range_hv()
    or the other MMU callbacks.

    arm64: KVM: Make VHE Stage-2 TLB invalidation operations non-interruptible
    
    commit c987876a80e7bcb98a839f10dca9ce7fda4feced upstream.
    
    Contrary to the non-VHE version of the TLB invalidation helpers, the VHE
    code  has interrupts enabled, meaning that we can take an interrupt in
    the middle of such a sequence, and start running something else with
    HCR_EL2.TGE cleared.
    
    That's really not a good idea.
    
    Take the heavy-handed option and disable interrupts in
    __tlb_switch_to_guest_vhe, restoring them in __tlb_switch_to_host_vhe.
    The latter also gain an ISB in order to make sure that TGE really has
    taken effect.

    progress, ____kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() treats any exception as
    fatal to KVM and invokes kvm_spurious_fault(), which in turn generates
    a BUG() to get a stack trace and die.
    
    When it was originally added by commit 4ecac3fd6dc2 ("KVM: Handle
    virtualization instruction #UD faults during reboot"), the "call" to
    kvm_spurious_fault() was handcoded as PUSH+JMP, where the PUSH'd value
    is the RIP of the faulting instructing.
    
    The PUSH+JMP trickery is necessary because the exception fixup handler
    code lies outside of its associated function, e.g. right after the
    function.  An actual CALL from the .fixup code would show a slightly
    bogus stack trace, e.g. an extra "random" function would be inserted
    into the trace, as the return RIP on the stack would point to no known
    function (and the unwinder will likely try to guess who owns the RIP).
    
    Unfortunately, the JMP was replaced with a CALL when the macro was
    reworked to not spin indefinitely during reboot (commit b7c4145ba2eb
    "KVM: Don't spin on virt instruction faults during reboot").  This
    causes the aforementioned behavior where a bogus function is inserted
    into the stack trace, e.g. my builds like to blame free_kvm_area().
    
    Revert the CALL back to a JMP.  The changelog for commit b7c4145ba2eb
    ("KVM: Don't spin on virt instruction faults during reboot") contains
    nothing that indicates the switch to CALL was deliberate.  This is
    backed up by the fact that the PUSH <insn RIP> was left intact.
    
    Note that an alternative to the PUSH+JMP magic would be to JMP back
    to the "real" code and CALL from there, but that would require adding
    a JMP in the non-faulting path to avoid calling kvm_spurious_fault()
    and would add no value, i.e. the stack trace would be the same.
    
    Using CALL:

    x86/mm: Drop usage of __flush_tlb_all() in kernel_physical_mapping_init()
    
    commit ba6f508d0ec4adb09f0a939af6d5e19cdfa8667d upstream.
    
    Commit:
    
      f77084d96355 "x86/mm/pat: Disable preemption around __flush_tlb_all()"
    
    addressed a case where __flush_tlb_all() is called without preemption
    being disabled. It also left a warning to catch other cases where
    preemption is not disabled.
    
    That warning triggers for the memory hotplug path which is also used for
    persistent memory enabling:
    
     WARNING: CPU: 35 PID: 911 at ./arch/x86/include/asm/tlbflush.h:460

    Andy wondered why a path that can sleep was using __flush_tlb_all() [1]
    and Dave confirmed the expectation for TLB flush is for modifying /
    invalidating existing PTE entries, but not initial population [2]. Drop
    the usage of __flush_tlb_all() in phys_{p4d,pud,pmd}_init() on the
    expectation that this path is only ever populating empty entries for the
    linear map. Note, at linear map teardown time there is a call to the
    all-cpu flush_tlb_all() to invalidate the removed mappings.

    x86/speculation/l1tf: Drop the swap storage limit restriction when l1tf=off
    
    commit 5b5e4d623ec8a34689df98e42d038a3b594d2ff9 upstream.
    
    Swap storage is restricted to max_swapfile_size (~16TB on x86_64) whenever
    the system is deemed affected by L1TF vulnerability. Even though the limit
    is quite high for most deployments it seems to be too restrictive for
    deployments which are willing to live with the mitigation disabled.
    
    We have a customer to deploy 8x 6,4TB PCIe/NVMe SSD swap devices which is
    clearly out of the limit.
    
    Drop the swap restriction when l1tf=off is specified. It also doesn't make
    much sense to warn about too much memory for the l1tf mitigation when it is
    forcefully disabled by the administrator.

    i915: fix missing user_access_end() in page fault exception case
    
    commit 0b2c8f8b6b0c7530e2866c95862546d0da2057b0 upstream.
    
    When commit fddcd00a49e9 ("drm/i915: Force the slow path after a
    user-write error") unified the error handling for various user access
    problems, it didn't do the user_access_end() that is needed for the
    unsafe_put_user() case.
    
    It's not a huge deal: a missed user_access_end() will only mean that
    SMAP protection isn't active afterwards, and for the error case we'll be
    returning to user mode soon enough anyway.  But it's wrong, and adding
    the proper user_access_end() is trivial enough (and doing it for the
    other error cases where it isn't needed doesn't hurt).
    
    I noticed it while doing the same prep-work for changing
    user_access_begin() that precipitated the access_ok() changes in commit
    96d4f267e40f ("Remove 'type' argument from access_ok() function").

    media: dvb-usb-v2: Fix incorrect use of transfer_flags URB_FREE_BUFFER
    
    commit 255095fa7f62ff09b6f61393414535c59c6b4cb0 upstream.
    
    commit 1a0c10ed7bb1 ("media: dvb-usb-v2: stop using coherent memory for
    URBs") incorrectly adds URB_FREE_BUFFER after every urb transfer.
    
    It cannot use this flag because it reconfigures the URBs accordingly
    to suit connected devices. In doing a call to usb_free_urb is made and
    invertedly frees the buffers.
    
    The stream buffer should remain constant while driver is up.

    usb: roles: Add a description for the class to Kconfig
    
    commit c3788cd9963eb2e77de3c24142fb7c67b61f1a26 upstream.
    
    That makes the USB role switch support option visible and
    selectable for the user. The class driver is also moved to
    drivers/usb/roles/ directory.
    
    This will fix an issue that we have with the Intel USB role
    switch driver on systems that don't have USB Type-C connectors:
    
    Intel USB role switch driver depends on the USB role switch
    class as it should, but since there was no way for the user
    to enable the USB role switch class, there was also no way
    to select that driver. USB Type-C drivers select the USB
    role switch class which makes the Intel USB role switch
    driver available and therefore hides the problem.
    
    So in practice Intel USB role switch driver was depending on
    USB Type-C drivers.

    Revert "usb: dwc3: pci: Use devm functions to get the phy GPIOs"
    
    commit 3004cfd6204927c1294060b849029cf0c2651074 upstream.
    
    Commit 211f658b7b40 ("usb: dwc3: pci: Use devm functions to get
    the phy GPIOs") changed the code to claim the PHY GPIOs permanently
    for Intel Baytrail devices.
    
    This causes issues when the actual PHY driver attempts to claim the
    same GPIO descriptors. For example, tusb1210 now fails to probe with:
    
      tusb1210: probe of dwc3.0.auto.ulpi failed with error -16 (EBUSY)
    
    dwc3-pci needs to turn on the PHY once before dwc3 is loaded, but
    usually the PHY driver will then hold the GPIOs to turn off the
    PHY when requested (e.g. during suspend).
    
    To fix the problem, this reverts the commit to restore the old
    behavior to put the GPIOs immediately after usage.

    usb: dwc2: disable power_down on Amlogic devices
    
    commit cc10ce0c51b13d1566d0ec1dcb472fb86330b391 upstream.
    
    Disable power_down by setting the parameter to
    DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE. This fixes a problem on various Amlogic
    Meson SoCs where USB devices are only recognized when plugged in before
    booting Linux. A hot-plugged USB device was not detected even though the
    device got power (my USB thumb drive for example has an LED which lit
    up).
    
    A similar fix was implemented for Rockchip SoCs in commit c216765d3a1def
    ("usb: dwc2: disable power_down on rockchip devices"). That commit
    suggests that a change in the dwc2 driver is the cause because the
    default value for the "hibernate" parameter (which then got renamed to
    "power_down" to support other modes) was changed in the v4.17 merge
    window with:
    commit 6d23ee9caa6790 ("Merge tag 'usb-for-v4.17' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/balbi/usb into usb-testing").

    usb: r8a66597: Fix a possible concurrency use-after-free bug in r8a66597_endpoint_disable()
    
    commit c85400f886e3d41e69966470879f635a2b50084c upstream.
    
    The function r8a66597_endpoint_disable() and r8a66597_urb_enqueue() may
    be concurrently executed.
    The two functions both access a possible shared variable "hep->hcpriv".
    
    This shared variable is freed by r8a66597_endpoint_disable() via the
    call path:
    r8a66597_endpoint_disable
      kfree(hep->hcpriv) (line 1995 in Linux-4.19)
    
    This variable is read by r8a66597_urb_enqueue() via the call path:
    r8a66597_urb_enqueue
      spin_lock_irqsave(&r8a66597->lock)
      init_pipe_info
        enable_r8a66597_pipe
          pipe = hep->hcpriv (line 802 in Linux-4.19)
    
    The read operation is protected by a spinlock, but the free operation
    is not protected by this spinlock, thus a concurrency use-after-free bug
    may occur.
    
    To fix this bug, the spin-lock and spin-unlock function calls in
    r8a66597_endpoint_disable() are moved to protect the free operation.

    usb: dwc2: host: use hrtimer for NAK retries
    
    commit 6ed30a7d8ec29d3aba46e47aa8b4a44f077dda4e upstream.
    
    Modify the wait delay utilize the high resolution timer API to allow for
    more precisely scheduled callbacks.
    
    A previous commit added a 1ms retry delay after multiple consecutive
    NAKed transactions using jiffies. On systems with a low timer interrupt
    frequency, this delay may be significantly longer than specified,
    resulting in misbehavior with some USB devices.
    
    This scenario was reached on a Raspberry Pi 3B with a Macally FDD-USB
    floppy drive (identified as 0424:0fdc Standard Microsystems Corp.
    Floppy, based on the USB97CFDC USB FDC). With the relay delay, the drive
    would be unable to mount a disk, replying with NAKs until the device was
    reset.
    
    Using ktime, the delta between starting the timer (in dwc2_hcd_qh_add)
    and the callback function can be determined. With the original delay
    implementation, this value was consistently approximately 12ms. (output
    in us).
    
        <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.559974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11976
        <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.571974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11977
        <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.583974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11976
        <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.595974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11977
    
    After converting the relay delay to using a higher resolution timer, the
    delay was much closer to 1ms.
    
        <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1956.553017: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1002
        <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1956.554114: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1002
        <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1957.542660: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1004
        <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1957.543701: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1002
    
    The floppy drive operates properly with delays up to approximately 5ms,
    and sends NAKs for any delays that are longer.

    ALSA: hda/tegra: clear pending irq handlers
    
    commit 63d2a9ec310d8bcc955574220d4631aa55c1a80c upstream.
    
    Even after disabling interrupts on the module, it could be possible
    that irq handlers are still running. System hang is seen during
    suspend path. It was found that, there were pending writes on the
    HDA bus and clock was disabled by that time.
    
    Above mentioned issue is fixed by clearing any pending irq handlers
    before disabling clocks and returning from hda suspend.

    ALSA: firewire-lib: fix wrong handling payload_length as payload_quadlet
    
    commit ada79fa5a0b374dd2c2262137c734da7524a8263 upstream.
    
    In IEC 61883-1/6 engine of ALSA firewire stack, a packet handler has a
    second argument for 'the number of bytes in payload of isochronous
    packet'. However, an incoming packet handler without CIP header uses the
    value as 'the number of quadlets in the payload'. This brings userspace
    applications to receive the number of PCM frames as four times against
    real time.
    
    This commit fixes the bug.

    ALSA: fireface: fix for state to fetch PCM frames
    
    commit 3d16200a3e55a39caa1c88419cb559c00316f721 upstream.
    
    According to my memo at hand and saved records, writing 0x00000001 to
    SND_FF_REG_FETCH_PCM_FRAMES disables fetching PCM frames in corresponding
    channel, however current implement uses reversed logic. This results in
    muted volume in device side during playback.
    
    This commit corrects the bug.

    mtd: rawnand: marvell: prevent timeouts on a loaded machine
    
    commit cafb56dd741e61c99709bcd2b193a9a1d36def3b upstream.
    
    marvell_nfc_wait_op() waits for completion during 'timeout_ms'
    milliseconds before throwing an error. While the logic is fine, the
    value of 'timeout_ms' is given by the core and actually correspond to
    the maximum time the NAND chip will take to complete the
    operation. Assuming there is no overhead in the propagation of the
    interrupt signal to the the NAND controller (through the Ready/Busy
    line), this delay does not take into account the latency of the
    operating system. For instance, for a page write, the delay given by
    the core is rounded up to 1ms. Hence, when the machine is over loaded,
    there is chances that this timeout will be reached.
    
    There are two ways to solve this issue that are not incompatible:
    1/ Enlarge the timeout value (if so, how much?).
    2/ Check after the waiting method if we did not miss any interrupt
    because of the OS latency (an interrupt is still pending). In this
    case, we assume the operation exited successfully.
    
    We choose the second approach that is a must in all cases, with the
    possibility to also modify the timeout value to be, e.g. at least 1
    second in all cases.

    commit 2a9d92fb3a1282a4659f1bb6d5684018846537b7 upstream.
    
    I ran into a link-time error with the atmel-quadspi driver on the
    EBSA110 platform:
    
    drivers/mtd/built-in.o: In function `atmel_qspi_run_command':
    :(.text+0x1ee3c): undefined reference to `_memcpy_toio'
    :(.text+0x1ee48): undefined reference to `_memcpy_fromio'
    
    The problem is that _memcpy_toio/_memcpy_fromio are not available on
    that platform, and we have to prevent building the driver there.
    
    In case we want to backport this to older kernels: between linux-4.8
    and linux-4.20, the Kconfig entry was in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/Kconfig
    but had the same problem.

    ALSA: emux: Fix potential Spectre v1 vulnerabilities
    
    commit 4aea96f4237cea0c51a8bc87c0db31f0f932f1f0 upstream.
    
    info.mode and info.port are indirectly controlled by user-space,
    hence leading to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1
    vulnerability.
    
    These issues were detected with the help of Smatch:
    
    sound/synth/emux/emux_hwdep.c:72 snd_emux_hwdep_misc_mode() warn: potential spectre issue 'emu->portptrs[i]->ctrls' [w] (local cap)

    sound/synth/emux/emux_hwdep.c:75 snd_emux_hwdep_misc_mode() warn: potential spectre issue 'emu->portptrs[info.port]->ctrls' [w] (local cap)
    
    Fix this by sanitizing both info.mode and info.port before using them
    to index emu->portptrs[i]->ctrls, emu->portptrs[info.port]->ctrls and
    emu->portptrs.
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    sock: Make sock->sk_stamp thread-safe
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a0ed3e9619738067214871e9cb826fa23b2ddb9 ]
    
    Al Viro mentioned (Message-ID
    <20170626041334.GZ10672@ZenIV.linux.org.uk>)
    that there is probably a race condition
    lurking in accesses of sk_stamp on 32-bit machines.
    
    sock->sk_stamp is of type ktime_t which is always an s64.
    On a 32 bit architecture, we might run into situations of
    unsafe access as the access to the field becomes non atomic.
    
    Use seqlocks for synchronization.
    This allows us to avoid using spinlocks for readers as
    readers do not need mutual exclusion.
    
    Another approach to solve this is to require sk_lock for all
    modifications of the timestamps. The current approach allows
    for timestamps to have their own lock: sk_stamp_lock.
    This allows for the patch to not compete with already
    existing critical sections, and side effects are limited
    to the paths in the patch.
    
    The addition of the new field maintains the data locality
    optimizations from
    commit 9115e8cd2a0c ("net: reorganize struct sock for better data
    locality")
    
    Note that all the instances of the sk_stamp accesses
    are either through the ioctl or the syscall recvmsg.

    packet: validate address length if non-zero
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b8d95f1795c42161dc0984b6863e95d6acf24ed ]
    
    Validate packet socket address length if a length is given. Zero
    length is equivalent to not setting an address.

    net/wan: fix a double free in x25_asy_open_tty()
    
    [ Upstream commit d5c7c745f254c6cb98b3b3f15fe789b8bd770c72 ]
    
    When x25_asy_open() fails, it already cleans up by itself,
    so its caller doesn't need to free the memory again.
    
    It seems we still have to call x25_asy_free() to clear the SLF_INUSE
    bit, so just set these pointers to NULL after kfree().

    netrom: fix locking in nr_find_socket()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7314f5480f3e37e570104dc5e0f28823ef849e72 ]
    
    nr_find_socket(), nr_find_peer() and nr_find_listener() lock the
    sock after finding it in the global list. However, the call path
    requires BH disabled for the sock lock consistently.
    
    Actually the locking is unnecessary at this point, we can just hold
    the sock refcnt to make sure it is not gone after we unlock the global
    list, and lock it later only when needed.

    ip: validate header length on virtual device xmit
    
    [ Upstream commit cb9f1b783850b14cbd7f87d061d784a666dfba1f ]
    
    KMSAN detected read beyond end of buffer in vti and sit devices when
    passing truncated packets with PF_PACKET. The issue affects additional
    ip tunnel devices.
    
    Extend commit 76c0ddd8c3a6 ("ip6_tunnel: be careful when accessing the
    inner header") and commit ccfec9e5cb2d ("ip_tunnel: be careful when
    accessing the inner header").
    
    Move the check to a separate helper and call at the start of each
    ndo_start_xmit function in net/ipv4 and net/ipv6.
    
    Minor changes:
    - convert dev_kfree_skb to kfree_skb on error path,
      as dev_kfree_skb calls consume_skb which is not for error paths.
    - use pskb_network_may_pull even though that is pedantic here,
      as the same as pskb_may_pull for devices without llheaders.
    - do not cache ipv6 hdrs if used only once
      (unsafe across pskb_may_pull, was more relevant to earlier patch)

    ibmveth: fix DMA unmap error in ibmveth_xmit_start error path
    
    [ Upstream commit 756af9c642329d54f048bac2a62f829b391f6944 ]
    
    Commit 33a48ab105a7 ("ibmveth: Fix DMA unmap error") fixed an issue in the
    normal code path of ibmveth_xmit_start() that was originally introduced by
    Commit 6e8ab30ec677 ("ibmveth: Add scatter-gather support"). This original
    fix missed the error path where dma_unmap_page is wrongly called on the
    header portion in descs[0] which was mapped with dma_map_single. As a
    result a failure to DMA map any of the frags results in a dmesg warning
    when CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is enabled.

    There are multiple issues here:
    
    1. After freeing dev->ax25_ptr, we need to set it to NULL otherwise
       we may use a dangling pointer.
    
    2. There is a race between ax25_setsockopt() and device notifier as
       reported by syzbot. Close it by holding RTNL lock.
    
    3. We need to test if dev->ax25_ptr is NULL before using it.

    The BPF flow dissector expects either skb->sk or skb->dev set on
    all skbs. Delay flow dissection until after skb->dev is set.
    
    This requires calling from within an rcu read-side critical section.
    That is fine, see also the call from tun_xdp_one.

    After some investigation I figured out that recently added cleanup code
    tries to call VLAN filtering de-initialization function which exist only
    for newer hardware. Corresponding function pointer is not
    set (== 0) for older hardware, namely these chips:
    
            #define CHIP_NUM_57710                  0x164e
            #define CHIP_NUM_57711                  0x164f
            #define CHIP_NUM_57711E                 0x1650
    
    And I have one of those in my test system:
    
            Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries NetXtreme II BCM57711E 10-Gigabit PCIe [14e4:1650]
    
    Function bnx2x_init_vlan_mac_fp_objs() from
    drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_cmn.h decides whether to
    initialize relevant pointers in bnx2x_sp_objs.vlan_obj or not.
    
    This regression was introduced after v4.20-rc7, and still exists in v4.20
    release.

    media: ov5640: Fix set format regression
    
    commit 07115449919383548d094ff83cc27bd08639a8a1 upstream.
    
    The set_fmt operations updates the sensor format only when the image format
    is changed. When only the image sizes gets changed, the format do not get
    updated causing the sensor to always report the one that was previously in
    use.
    
    Without this patch, updating frame size only fails:
      [fmt:UYVY8_2X8/640x480@1/30 field:none colorspace:srgb xfer:srgb ...]
    
    With this patch applied:
      [fmt:UYVY8_2X8/1024x768@1/30 field:none colorspace:srgb xfer:srgb ...]
    
    Fixes: 6949d864776e ("media: ov5640: do not change mode if format or frame interval is unchanged")

    panic: avoid deadlocks in re-entrant console drivers
    
    commit c7c3f05e341a9a2bd1a92993d4f996cfd6e7348e upstream.
    
    From printk()/serial console point of view panic() is special, because
    it may force CPU to re-enter printk() or/and serial console driver.
    Therefore, some of serial consoles drivers are re-entrant. E.g. 8250:
    
    serial8250_console_write()
    {
            if (port->sysrq)
                    locked = 0;
            else if (oops_in_progress)
                    locked = spin_trylock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags);
            else
                    spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags);
            ...
    }
    
    panic() does set oops_in_progress via bust_spinlocks(1), so in theory
    we should be able to re-enter serial console driver from panic():
    
            CPU0
            <NMI>
            uart_console_write()
            serial8250_console_write()              // if (oops_in_progress)
                                                    //    spin_trylock_irqsave()
            call_console_drivers()
            console_unlock()
            console_flush_on_panic()
            bust_spinlocks(1)                       // oops_in_progress++
            panic()
            <NMI/>
            spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags)   // spin_lock_irqsave()
            serial8250_console_write()
            call_console_drivers()
            console_unlock()
            printk()
            ...
    
    However, this does not happen and we deadlock in serial console on
    port->lock spinlock. And the problem is that console_flush_on_panic()
    called after bust_spinlocks(0):
    
    void panic(const char *fmt, ...)
    {
            bust_spinlocks(1);
            ...
            bust_spinlocks(0);
            console_flush_on_panic();
            ...
    }
    
    bust_spinlocks(0) decrements oops_in_progress, so oops_in_progress
    can go back to zero. Thus even re-entrant console drivers will simply
    spin on port->lock spinlock. Given that port->lock may already be
    locked either by a stopped CPU, or by the very same CPU we execute
    panic() on (for instance, NMI panic() on printing CPU) the system
    deadlocks and does not reboot.
    
    Fix this by removing bust_spinlocks(0), so oops_in_progress is always
    set in panic() now and, thus, re-entrant console drivers will trylock
    the port->lock instead of spinning on it forever, when we call them
    from console_flush_on_panic().
