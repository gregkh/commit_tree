    xen: xenbus driver must not accept invalid transaction ids
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 639b08810d6ad74ded2c5f6e233c4fcb9d147168 ]
    
    When accessing Xenstore in a transaction the user is specifying a
    transaction id which he normally obtained from Xenstore when starting
    the transaction. Xenstore is validating a transaction id against all
    known transaction ids of the connection the request came in. As all
    requests of a domain not being the one where Xenstore lives share
    one connection, validation of transaction ids of different users of
    Xenstore in that domain should be done by the kernel of that domain
    being the multiplexer between the Xenstore users in that domain and
    Xenstore.
    
    In order to prohibit one Xenstore user "hijacking" a transaction from
    another user the xenbus driver has to verify a given transaction id
    against all known transaction ids of the user before forwarding it to
    Xenstore.

    [ Upstream commit 73ba39ab9307340dc98ec3622891314bbc09cc2e ]
    
    In function btrfs_uuid_tree_iterate(), errno is assigned to variable ret
    on errors. However, it directly returns 0. It may be better to return
    ret. This patch also removes the warning, because the caller already
    prints a warning.

    PCI: Apply _HPX settings only to relevant devices
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 977509f7c5c6fb992ffcdf4291051af343b91645 ]
    
    Previously we didn't check the type of device before trying to apply Type 1
    (PCI-X) or Type 2 (PCIe) Setting Records from _HPX.
    
    We don't support PCI-X Setting Records, so this was harmless, but the
    warning was useless.
    
    We do support PCIe Setting Records, and we didn't check whether a device
    was PCIe before applying settings.  I don't think anything bad happened on
    non-PCIe devices because pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word(),
    pcie_cap_has_lnkctl(), etc., would fail before doing any harm.  But it's
    ugly to depend on those internals.
    
    Check the device type before attempting to apply Type 1 and Type 2 Setting
    Records (Type 0 records are applicable to PCI, PCI-X, and PCIe devices).
    
    A side benefit is that this prevents useless "not supported" warnings when
    a BIOS supplies a Type 1 (PCI-X) Setting Record and we try to apply it to
    every single device:
    
      pci 0000:00:00.0: PCI-X settings not supported
    
    After this patch, we'll get the warning only when a BIOS supplies a Type 1
    record and we have a PCI-X device to which it should be applied.

    The first message to a remote node should prompt a new

    the MR mapping can fail because connections is not yet up.

    we make sure the map failure because of unavailable
    connection reach to the user by appropriate error code.
    Before returning to the user, lets trigger the connection
    so that its ready for the next retry.

    e1000e: Separate signaling for link check/link up
    
    commit 19110cfbb34d4af0cdfe14cd243f3b09dc95b013 upstream.
    
    Lennart reported the following race condition:
    
    \ e1000_watchdog_task
        \ e1000e_has_link
            \ hw->mac.ops.check_for_link() === e1000e_check_for_copper_link
                /* link is up */
                mac->get_link_status = false;
    
                                /* interrupt */
                                \ e1000_msix_other
                                    hw->mac.get_link_status = true;
    
            link_active = !hw->mac.get_link_status
            /* link_active is false, wrongly */
    
    This problem arises because the single flag get_link_status is used to
    signal two different states: link status needs checking and link status is
    down.
    
    Avoid the problem by using the return value of .check_for_link to signal
    the link status to e1000e_has_link().

    iio-trig-periodic-rtc driver because it has been removed upstream.
    
    The following explanation comes from that commit:
    
        These stand-alone trigger drivers were using iio_trigger_put()
        where they should have been using iio_trigger_free().  The
        iio_trigger_put() adds a module_put which is bad since they
        never did a module_get.
    
        In the sysfs driver, module_get/put's are used as triggers are
        added & removed. This extra module_put() occurs on an error path
        in the probe routine (probably rare).
    
        In the bfin-timer & interrupt trigger drivers, the module resources
        are not explicitly managed, so it's doing a put on something that
        was never get'd.  It occurs on the probe error path and on the
        remove path (not so rare).
    
        Tested with the sysfs trigger driver.
        The bfin & interrupt drivers were build tested & inspected only.
    
    This was build tested only.

    USB: fix buffer overflows with parsing CDC headers
    
    Parsing CDC headers a buffer overflow cannot just be prevented
    by checking that the remainder of the buffer is longer than minimum
    length. The size of the fields to be parsed must be figured in, too.
    
    In newer kernels this issue has been fixed at a central location with

    mtd: nand: Fix writing mtdoops to nand flash.
    
    commit 30863e38ebeb500a31cecee8096fb5002677dd9b upstream.
    
    When mtdoops calls mtd_panic_write(), it eventually calls
    panic_nand_write() in nand_base.c. In order to properly wait for the
    nand chip to be ready in panic_nand_wait(), the chip must first be
    selected.
    
    When using the atmel nand flash controller, a panic would occur due to
    a NULL pointer exception.

    net/9p: Switch to wait_event_killable()
    
    commit 9523feac272ccad2ad8186ba4fcc89103754de52 upstream.
    
    Because userspace gets Very Unhappy when calls like stat() and execve()
    return -EINTR on 9p filesystem mounts. For instance, when bash is
    looking in PATH for things to execute and some SIGCHLD interrupts
    stat(), bash can throw a spurious 'command not found' since it doesn't
    retry the stat().
    
    In practice, hitting the problem is rare and needs a really
    slow/bogged down 9p server.

    media: v4l2-ctrl: Fix flags field on Control events
    
    commit 9cac9d2fb2fe0e0cadacdb94415b3fe49e3f724f upstream.
    
    VIDIOC_DQEVENT and VIDIOC_QUERY_EXT_CTRL should give the same output for
    the control flags field.
    
    This patch creates a new function user_flags(), that calculates the user
    exported flags value (which is different than the kernel internal flags
    structure). This function is then used by all the code that exports the
    internal flags to userspace.

    powerpc/signal: Properly handle return value from uprobe_deny_signal()
    
    commit 46725b17f1c6c815a41429259b3f070c01e71bc1 upstream.
    
    When a uprobe is installed on an instruction that we currently do not
    emulate, we copy the instruction into a xol buffer and single step
    that instruction. If that instruction generates a fault, we abort the
    single stepping before invoking the signal handler. Once the signal
    handler is done, the uprobe trap is hit again since the instruction is
    retried and the process repeats.
    
    We use uprobe_deny_signal() to detect if the xol instruction triggered
    a signal. If so, we clear TIF_SIGPENDING and set TIF_UPROBE so that the
    signal is not handled until after the single stepping is aborted. In
    this case, uprobe_deny_signal() returns true and get_signal() ends up
    returning 0. However, in do_signal(), we are not looking at the return
    value, but depending on ksig.sig for further action, all with an
    uninitialized ksig that is not touched in this scenario. Fix the same
    by initializing ksig.sig to 0.

    parisc: Fix validity check of pointer size argument in new CAS implementation
    
    commit 05f016d2ca7a4fab99d5d5472168506ddf95e74f upstream.
    
    As noted by Christoph Biedl, passing a pointer size of 4 in the new CAS
    implementation causes a kernel crash.  The attached patch corrects the
    off by one error in the argument validity check.
    
    In reviewing the code, I noticed that we only perform word operations
    with the pointer size argument.  The subi instruction intentionally uses
    a word condition on 64-bit kernels.  Nullification was used instead of a
    cmpib instruction as the branch should never be taken.  The shlw
    pseudo-operation generates a depw,z instruction and it clears the target
    before doing a shift left word deposit.  Thus, we don't need to clip the
    upper 32 bits of this argument on 64-bit kernels.
    
    Tested with a gcc testsuite run with a 64-bit kernel.  The gcc atomic
    code in libgcc is the only direct user of the new CAS implementation
    that I am aware of.

    ixgbe: Fix skb list corruption on Power systems
    
    commit 0a9a17e3bb4564caf4bfe2a6783ae1287667d188 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue seen on Power systems with ixgbe which results
    in skb list corruption and an eventual kernel oops. The following is what
    was observed:
    
    CPU 1                                   CPU2
    ============================            ============================
    1: ixgbe_xmit_frame_ring                ixgbe_clean_tx_irq
    2:  first->skb = skb                     eop_desc = tx_buffer->next_to_watch
    3:  ixgbe_tx_map                         read_barrier_depends()
    4:   wmb                                 check adapter written status bit
    5:   first->next_to_watch = tx_desc      napi_consume_skb(tx_buffer->skb ..);
    6:   writel(i, tx_ring->tail);
    
    The read_barrier_depends is insufficient to ensure that tx_buffer->skb does not
    get loaded prior to tx_buffer->next_to_watch, which then results in loading
    a stale skb pointer. This patch replaces the read_barrier_depends with
    smp_rmb to ensure loads are ordered with respect to the load of
    tx_buffer->next_to_watch.

    driver, but the same issue exists with fm10k as well, as the code is
    very similar. read_barrier_depends is not sufficient to ensure
    loads following it are not speculatively loaded out of order
    by the CPU, which can result in stale data being loaded, causing
    potential system crashes.

    commit ae0c585d93dfaf923d2c7eb44b2c3ab92854ea9b upstream.
    
    The original issue being fixed in this patch was seen with the ixgbe
    driver, but the same issue exists with ixgbevf as well, as the code is
    very similar. read_barrier_depends is not sufficient to ensure
    loads following it are not speculatively loaded out of order
    by the CPU, which can result in stale data being loaded, causing
    potential system crashes.

    time: Always make sure wall_to_monotonic isn't positive
    
    commit e1d7ba8735551ed79c7a0463a042353574b96da3 upstream.
    
    Two issues were found on an IMX6 development board without an
    enabled RTC device(resulting in the boot time and monotonic
    time being initialized to 0).
    
    Issue 1:exportfs -a generate:
           "exportfs: /opt/nfs/arm does not support NFS export"
    Issue 2:cat /proc/stat:
           "btime 4294967236"
    
    The same issues can be reproduced on x86 after running the
    following code:
            int main(void)
            {
                struct timeval val;
                int ret;
    
                val.tv_sec = 0;
                val.tv_usec = 0;
                ret = settimeofday(&val, NULL);
                return 0;
            }
    
    Two issues are different symptoms of same problem:
    The reason is a positive wall_to_monotonic pushes boot time back
    to the time before Epoch, and getboottime will return negative
    value.
    
    In symptom 1:
              negative boot time cause get_expiry() to overflow time_t
              when input expire time is 2147483647, then cache_flush()
              always clears entries just added in ip_map_parse.
    In symptom 2:
              show_stat() uses "unsigned long" to print negative btime
              value returned by getboottime.
    
    This patch fix the problem by prohibiting time from being set to a value which
    would cause a negative boot time. As a result one can't set the CLOCK_REALTIME
    time prior to (1970 + system uptime).

    NFC: fix device-allocation error return
    
    commit c45e3e4c5b134b081e8af362109905427967eb19 upstream.
    
    A recent change fixing NFC device allocation itself introduced an
    error-handling bug by returning an error pointer in case device-id
    allocation failed. This is clearly broken as the callers still expected
    NULL to be returned on errors as detected by Dan's static checker.
    
    Fix this up by returning NULL in the event that we've run out of memory
    when allocating a new device id.
    
    Note that the offending commit is marked for stable (3.8) so this fix
    needs to be backported along with it.

    KVM: SVM: obey guest PAT
    
    commit 15038e14724799b8c205beb5f20f9e54896013c3 upstream.
    
    For many years some users of assigned devices have reported worse
    performance on AMD processors with NPT than on AMD without NPT,
    Intel or bare metal.
    
    The reason turned out to be that SVM is discarding the guest PAT
    setting and uses the default (PA0=PA4=WB, PA1=PA5=WT, PA2=PA6=UC-,
    PA3=UC).  The guest might be using a different setting, and
    especially might want write combining but isn't getting it
    (instead getting slow UC or UC- accesses).
    
    Thanks a lot to geoff@hostfission.com for noticing the relation
    to the g_pat setting.  The patch has been tested also by a bunch
    of people on VFIO users forums.

    ALSA: timer: Remove kernel warning at compat ioctl error paths
    
    commit 3d4e8303f2c747c8540a0a0126d0151514f6468b upstream.
    
    Some timer compat ioctls have NULL checks of timer instance with
    snd_BUG_ON() that bring up WARN_ON() when the debug option is set.
    Actually the condition can be met in the normal situation and it's
    confusing and bad to spew kernel warnings with stack trace there.
    Let's remove snd_BUG_ON() invocation and replace with the simple
    checks.  Also, correct the error code to EBADFD to follow the native
    ioctl error handling.

    ext4: fix interaction between i_size, fallocate, and delalloc after a crash
    
    commit 51e3ae81ec58e95f10a98ef3dd6d7bce5d8e35a2 upstream.
    
    If there are pending writes subject to delayed allocation, then i_size
    will show size after the writes have completed, while i_disksize
    contains the value of i_size on the disk (since the writes have not
    been persisted to disk).
    
    If fallocate(2) is called with the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag, either
    with or without the FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE flag set, and the new size
    after the fallocate(2) is between i_size and i_disksize, then after a
    crash, if a journal commit has resulted in the changes made by the
    fallocate() call to be persisted after a crash, but the delayed
    allocation write has not resolved itself, i_size would not be updated,
    and this would cause the following e2fsck complaint:
    
    Inode 12, end of extent exceeds allowed value
            (logical block 33, physical block 33441, len 7)
    
    This can only take place on a sparse file, where the fallocate(2) call
    is allocating blocks in a range which is before a pending delayed
    allocation write which is extending i_size.  Since this situation is
    quite rare, and the window in which the crash must take place is
    typically < 30 seconds, in practice this condition will rarely happen.
    
    Nevertheless, it can be triggered in testing, and in particular by
    xfstests generic/456.

    nfsd: deal with revoked delegations appropriately
    
    commit 95da1b3a5aded124dd1bda1e3cdb876184813140 upstream.
    
    If a delegation has been revoked by the server, operations using that
    delegation should error out with NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED in the >4.1
    case, and NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID otherwise.
    
    The server needs NFSv4.1 clients to explicitly free revoked delegations.
    If the server returns NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, the client will do that;
    otherwise it may just forget about the delegation and be unable to
    recover when it later sees SEQ4_STATUS_RECALLABLE_STATE_REVOKED set on a
    SEQUENCE reply.  That can cause the Linux 4.1 client to loop in its
    stage manager.

    nfs: Fix ugly referral attributes
    
    commit c05cefcc72416a37eba5a2b35f0704ed758a9145 upstream.
    
    Before traversing a referral and performing a mount, the mounted-on
    directory looks strange:
    
    dr-xr-xr-x. 2 4294967294 4294967294 0 Dec 31  1969 dir.0
    
    nfs4_get_referral is wiping out any cached attributes with what was
    returned via GETATTR(fs_locations), but the bit mask for that
    operation does not request any file attributes.
    
    Retrieve owner and timestamp information so that the memcpy in
    nfs4_get_referral fills in more attributes.
    
    Changes since v1:
    - Don't request attributes that the client unconditionally replaces
    - Request only MOUNTED_ON_FILEID or FILEID attribute, not both
    - encode_fs_locations() doesn't use the third bitmask word

    isofs: fix timestamps beyond 2027
    
    commit 34be4dbf87fc3e474a842305394534216d428f5d upstream.
    
    isofs uses a 'char' variable to load the number of years since
    1900 for an inode timestamp. On architectures that use a signed
    char type by default, this results in an invalid date for
    anything beyond 2027.
    
    This changes the function argument to a 'u8' array, which
    is defined the same way on all architectures, and unambiguously
    lets us use years until 2155.
    
    This should be backported to all kernels that might still be
    in use by that date.

    bcache: check ca->alloc_thread initialized before wake up it
    
    commit 91af8300d9c1d7c6b6a2fd754109e08d4798b8d8 upstream.
    
    In bcache code, sysfs entries are created before all resources get
    allocated, e.g. allocation thread of a cache set.
    
    There is posibility for NULL pointer deference if a resource is accessed
    but which is not initialized yet. Indeed Jorg Bornschein catches one on
    cache set allocation thread and gets a kernel oops.
    
    The reason for this bug is, when bch_bucket_alloc() is called during
    cache set registration and attaching, ca->alloc_thread is not properly
    allocated and initialized yet, call wake_up_process() on ca->alloc_thread
    triggers NULL pointer deference failure. A simple and fast fix is, before
    waking up ca->alloc_thread, checking whether it is allocated, and only
    wake up ca->alloc_thread when it is not NULL.

    nilfs2: fix race condition that causes file system corruption
    
    commit 31ccb1f7ba3cfe29631587d451cf5bb8ab593550 upstream.
    
    There is a race condition between nilfs_dirty_inode() and
    nilfs_set_file_dirty().
    
    When a file is opened, nilfs_dirty_inode() is called to update the
    access timestamp in the inode.  It calls __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() in a
    separate transaction.  __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() caches the ifile
    buffer_head in the i_bh field of the inode info structure and marks it
    as dirty.
    
    After some data was written to the file in another transaction, the
    function nilfs_set_file_dirty() is called, which adds the inode to the
    ns_dirty_files list.
    
    Then the segment construction calls nilfs_segctor_collect_dirty_files(),
    which goes through the ns_dirty_files list and checks the i_bh field.
    If there is a cached buffer_head in i_bh it is not marked as dirty
    again.
    
    Since nilfs_dirty_inode() and nilfs_set_file_dirty() use separate
    transactions, it is possible that a segment construction that writes out
    the ifile occurs in-between the two.  If this happens the inode is not
    on the ns_dirty_files list, but its ifile block is still marked as dirty
    and written out.
    
    In the next segment construction, the data for the file is written out
    and nilfs_bmap_propagate() updates the b-tree.  Eventually the bmap root
    is written into the i_bh block, which is not dirty, because it was
    written out in another segment construction.
    
    As a result the bmap update can be lost, which leads to file system
    corruption.  Either the virtual block address points to an unallocated
    DAT block, or the DAT entry will be reused for something different.
    
    The error can remain undetected for a long time.  A typical error
    message would be one of the "bad btree" errors or a warning that a DAT
    entry could not be found.
    
    This bug can be reproduced reliably by a simple benchmark that creates
    and overwrites millions of 4k files.

    autofs: don't fail mount for transient error
    
    commit ecc0c469f27765ed1e2b967be0aa17cee1a60b76 upstream.
    
    Currently if the autofs kernel module gets an error when writing to the
    pipe which links to the daemon, then it marks the whole moutpoint as
    catatonic, and it will stop working.
    
    It is possible that the error is transient.  This can happen if the
    daemon is slow and more than 16 requests queue up.  If a subsequent
    process tries to queue a request, and is then signalled, the write to
    the pipe will return -ERESTARTSYS and autofs will take that as total
    failure.
    
    So change the code to assess -ERESTARTSYS and -ENOMEM as transient
    failures which only abort the current request, not the whole mountpoint.
    
    It isn't a crash or a data corruption, but having autofs mountpoints
    suddenly stop working is rather inconvenient.
    
    Ian said:
    
    : And given the problems with a half dozen (or so) user space applications
    : consuming large amounts of CPU under heavy mount and umount activity this
    : could happen more easily than we expect.

    MIPS: Fix an n32 core file generation regset support regression
    
    commit 547da673173de51f73887377eb275304775064ad upstream.
    
    Fix a commit 7aeb753b5353 ("MIPS: Implement task_user_regset_view.")
    regression, then activated by commit 6a9c001b7ec3 ("MIPS: Switch ELF
    core dumper to use regsets.)", that caused n32 processes to dump o32
    core files by failing to set the EF_MIPS_ABI2 flag in the ELF core file
    header's `e_flags' member:
    
    $ file tls-core
    tls-core: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, N32 MIPS64 rel2 version 1 (SYSV), [...]
    $ ./tls-core
    Aborted (core dumped)
    $ file core
    core: ELF 32-bit MSB core file MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style
    $
    
    Previously the flag was set as the result of a:
    
    statement placed in arch/mips/kernel/binfmt_elfn32.c, however in the
    regset case, i.e. when CORE_DUMP_USE_REGSET is set, ELF_CORE_EFLAGS is
    no longer used by `fill_note_info' in fs/binfmt_elf.c, and instead the
    `->e_flags' member of the regset view chosen is.  We have the views
    defined in arch/mips/kernel/ptrace.c, however only an o32 and an n64
    one, and the latter is used for n32 as well.  Consequently an o32 core
    file is incorrectly dumped from n32 processes (the ELF32 vs ELF64 class
    is chosen elsewhere, and the 32-bit one is correctly selected for n32).
    
    Correct the issue then by defining an n32 regset view and using it as
    appropriate.  Issue discovered in GDB testing.

    The bug can be easily triggered, if an extra delay (e.g. 10ms) is added
    between the test of DMF_FREEING & DMF_DELETING and dm_get() in
    dm_get_from_kobject().
    
    To fix it, we need to ensure the test of DMF_FREEING & DMF_DELETING and
    dm_get() are done in an atomic way, so _minor_lock is used.
    
    The other callers of dm_get() have also been checked to be OK: some
    callers invoke dm_get() under _minor_lock, some callers invoke it under
    _hash_lock, and dm_start_request() invoke it after increasing
    md->open_count.

    dm bufio: fix integer overflow when limiting maximum cache size
    
    commit 74d4108d9e681dbbe4a2940ed8fdff1f6868184c upstream.
    
    The default max_cache_size_bytes for dm-bufio is meant to be the lesser
    of 25% of the size of the vmalloc area and 2% of the size of lowmem.
    However, on 32-bit systems the intermediate result in the expression
    
        (VMALLOC_END - VMALLOC_START) * DM_BUFIO_VMALLOC_PERCENT / 100
    
    overflows, causing the wrong result to be computed.  For example, on a
    32-bit system where the vmalloc area is 520093696 bytes, the result is
    1174405 rather than the expected 130023424, which makes the maximum
    cache size much too small (far less than 2% of lowmem).  This causes
    severe performance problems for dm-verity users on affected systems.
    
    Fix this by using mult_frac() to correctly multiply by a percentage.  Do
    this for all places in dm-bufio that multiply by a percentage.  Also
    replace (VMALLOC_END - VMALLOC_START) with VMALLOC_TOTAL, which contrary
    to the comment is now defined in include/linux/vmalloc.h.

    ARM: 8721/1: mm: dump: check hardware RO bit for LPAE
    
    commit 3b0c0c922ff4be275a8beb87ce5657d16f355b54 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_ARM_LPAE is set, the PMD dump relies on the software
    read-only bit to determine whether a page is writable. This
    concealed a bug which left the kernel text section writable
    (AP2=0) while marked read-only in the software bit.
    
    In a kernel with the AP2 bug, the dump looks like this:
    
        ---[ Kernel Mapping ]---
        0xc0000000-0xc0200000           2M RW NX SHD
        0xc0200000-0xc0600000           4M ro x  SHD
        0xc0600000-0xc0800000           2M ro NX SHD
        0xc0800000-0xc4800000          64M RW NX SHD
    
    The fix is to check that the software and hardware bits are both
    set before displaying "ro". The dump then shows the true perms:
    
        ---[ Kernel Mapping ]---
        0xc0000000-0xc0200000           2M RW NX SHD

    This sequence seems to be a new instruction not in the opcode map in the Intel SDM.
    
    The instruction sequence is "F6 09 d8", means Group3(F6), MOD(00)REG(001)RM(001), and 0xd8.
    Intel SDM vol2 A.4 Table A-6 said the table index in the group is "Encoding of Bits 5,4,3 of
    the ModR/M Byte (bits 2,1,0 in parenthesis)"
    
    In that table, opcodes listed by the index REG bits as:
    
      000         001       010 011  100        101        110         111
     TEST Ib/Iz,(undefined),NOT,NEG,MUL AL/rAX,IMUL AL/rAX,DIV AL/rAX,IDIV AL/rAX
    
    So, it seems TEST Ib is assigned to 001.
    
    Add the new pattern.

    lib/mpi: call cond_resched() from mpi_powm() loop
    
    commit 1d9ddde12e3c9bab7f3d3484eb9446315e3571ca upstream.
    
    On a non-preemptible kernel, if KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE is called with the
    largest permitted inputs (16384 bits), the kernel spends 10+ seconds
    doing modular exponentiation in mpi_powm() without rescheduling.  If all
    threads do it, it locks up the system.  Moreover, it can cause
    rcu_sched-stall warnings.
    
    Notwithstanding the insanity of doing this calculation in kernel mode
    rather than in userspace, fix it by calling cond_resched() as each bit
    from the exponent is processed.  It's still noninterruptible, but at
    least it's preemptible now.
    
    Do the cond_resched() once per bit rather than once per MPI limb because
    each limb might still easily take 100+ milliseconds on slow CPUs.

    sched: Make resched_cpu() unconditional
    
    commit 7c2102e56a3f7d85b5d8f33efbd7aecc1f36fdd8 upstream.
    
    The current implementation of synchronize_sched_expedited() incorrectly
    assumes that resched_cpu() is unconditional, which it is not.  This means
    that synchronize_sched_expedited() can hang when resched_cpu()'s trylock
    fails as follows (analysis by Neeraj Upadhyay):
    
    o       CPU1 is waiting for expedited wait to complete:
    
            sync_rcu_exp_select_cpus
                 rdp->exp_dynticks_snap & 0x1   // returns 1 for CPU5
                 IPI sent to CPU5
    
            synchronize_sched_expedited_wait
                     ret = swait_event_timeout(rsp->expedited_wq,
                                               sync_rcu_preempt_exp_done(rnp_root),
                                               jiffies_stall);
    
            expmask = 0x20, CPU 5 in idle path (in cpuidle_enter())
    
    o       CPU5 handles IPI and fails to acquire rq lock.
    
            Handles IPI
                 sync_sched_exp_handler
                     resched_cpu
                         returns while failing to try lock acquire rq->lock
                     need_resched is not set
    
    o       CPU5 calls  rcu_idle_enter() and as need_resched is not set, goes to
            idle (schedule() is not called).
    
    o       CPU 1 reports RCU stall.
    
    Given that resched_cpu() is now used only by RCU, this commit fixes the
    assumption by making resched_cpu() unconditional.

    ipv6: only call ip6_route_dev_notify() once for NETDEV_UNREGISTER
    
    commit 76da0704507bbc51875013f6557877ab308cfd0a upstream.
    
    In commit 242d3a49a2a1 ("ipv6: reorder ip6_route_dev_notifier after ipv6_dev_notf")
    I assumed NETDEV_REGISTER and NETDEV_UNREGISTER are paired,
    unfortunately, as reported by jeffy, netdev_wait_allrefs()
    could rebroadcast NETDEV_UNREGISTER event until all refs are
    gone.
    
    We have to add an additional check to avoid this corner case.
    For netdev_wait_allrefs() dev->reg_state is NETREG_UNREGISTERED,
    for dev_change_net_namespace(), dev->reg_state is
    NETREG_REGISTERED. So check for dev->reg_state != NETREG_UNREGISTERED.

    s390/disassembler: increase show_code buffer size
    
    commit b192571d1ae375e0bbe0aa3ccfa1a3c3704454b9 upstream.
    
    Current buffer size of 64 is too small. objdump shows that there are
    instructions which would require up to 75 bytes buffer (with current
    formating). 128 bytes "ought to be enough for anybody".
    
    Also replaces 8 spaces with a single tab to reduce the memory footprint.
    
    Fixes the following KASAN finding:
