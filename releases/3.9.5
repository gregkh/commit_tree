    xen-netback: better names for thresholds
    
    commit 376414945d15aa636e65f7e773c1e398b7a21cb9 upstream.
    
    This patch only changes some names to avoid confusion.
    
    In this patch we have:
    
      MAX_SKB_SLOTS_DEFAULT -> FATAL_SKB_SLOTS_DEFAULT
      max_skb_slots -> fatal_skb_slots
      #define XEN_NETBK_LEGACY_SLOTS_MAX XEN_NETIF_NR_SLOTS_MIN
    
    The fatal_skb_slots is the threshold to determine whether a packet is
    malicious.
    
    XEN_NETBK_LEGACY_SLOTS_MAX is the maximum slots a valid packet can have at
    this point. It is defined to be XEN_NETIF_NR_SLOTS_MIN because that's
    guaranteed to be supported by all backends.

    xen-netfront: reduce gso_max_size to account for max TCP header
    
    commit 9ecd1a75d977e2e8c48139c7d3efed183f898d94 upstream.
    
    The maximum packet including header that can be handled by netfront / netback
    wire format is 65535. Reduce gso_max_size accordingly.
    
    Drop skb and print warning when skb->len > 65535. This can 1) save the effort
    to send malformed packet to netback, 2) help spotting misconfiguration of
    netfront in the future.

    xen-netback: don't disconnect frontend when seeing oversize packet
    
    commit 03393fd5cc2b6cdeec32b704ecba64dbb0feae3c upstream.
    
    Some frontend drivers are sending packets > 64 KiB in length. This length
    overflows the length field in the first slot making the following slots have
    an invalid length.
    
    Turn this error back into a non-fatal error by dropping the packet. To avoid
    having the following slots having fatal errors, consume all slots in the
    packet.
    
    This does not reopen the security hole in XSA-39 as if the packet as an
    invalid number of slots it will still hit fatal error case.

    xen-netback: coalesce slots in TX path and fix regressions
    
    commit 2810e5b9a7731ca5fce22bfbe12c96e16ac44b6f upstream.
    
    This patch tries to coalesce tx requests when constructing grant copy
    structures. It enables netback to deal with situation when frontend's
    MAX_SKB_FRAGS is larger than backend's MAX_SKB_FRAGS.
    
    With the help of coalescing, this patch tries to address two regressions
    avoid reopening the security hole in XSA-39.
    
    Regression 1. The reduction of the number of supported ring entries (slots)
    per packet (from 18 to 17). This regression has been around for some time but
    remains unnoticed until XSA-39 security fix. This is fixed by coalescing
    slots.
    
    Regression 2. The XSA-39 security fix turning "too many frags" errors from
    just dropping the packet to a fatal error and disabling the VIF. This is fixed
    by coalescing slots (handling 18 slots when backend's MAX_SKB_FRAGS is 17)
    which rules out false positive (using 18 slots is legit) and dropping packets
    using 19 to `max_skb_slots` slots.
    
    To avoid reopening security hole in XSA-39, frontend sending packet using more
    than max_skb_slots is considered malicious.
    
    The behavior of netback for packet is thus:
    
        1-18            slots: valid
       19-max_skb_slots slots: drop and respond with an error
       max_skb_slots+   slots: fatal error
    
    max_skb_slots is configurable by admin, default value is 20.
    
    Also change variable name from "frags" to "slots" in netbk_count_requests.
    
    Please note that RX path still has dependency on MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This will be
    fixed with separate patch.

    leds: leds-gpio: reserve gpio before using it
    
    commit 803d19d57a042e86e9e9b685bbc3f4a0a751040f upstream.
    
    This reverts commit a99d76f (leds: leds-gpio: use gpio_request_one)
    and commit 2d7c22f (leds: leds-gpio: set devm_gpio_request_one()
    flags param correctly) which was a fix of the first one.
    
    The conversion to devm_gpio_request in commit e3b1d44c (leds:
    leds-gpio: use devm_gpio_request_one) is not reverted.
    
    The problem is that gpio_cansleep() and gpio_get_value_cansleep()
    calls can crash if the gpio is not first reserved. Incidentally this
    same bug existed earlier and was fixed similarly in commit d95cbe61
    (leds: Fix potential leds-gpio oops). But the OOPS is real. It happens
    when GPIOs are provided by module which is not yet loaded.
    
    So this fixes the following BUG during my ALIX boot (3.9.2-vanilla):

    commit 21363ca873334391992f2f424856aa864345bb61 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a bug where FILEIO was incorrectly reporting the number
    of logical blocks (+ 1) when using non struct block_device export mode.
    
    It changes fd_get_blocks() to follow all other backend ->get_blocks() cases,
    and reduces the calculated dev_size by one dev->dev_attrib.block_size
    number of bytes, and also fixes initial fd_block_size assignment at
    fd_configure_device() time introduced in commit 0fd97ccf4.

    target: Re-instate sess_wait_list for target_wait_for_sess_cmds
    
    commit 9b31a328e344e62e7cc98ae574edcb7b674719bb upstream.
    
    Switch back to pre commit 1c7b13fe652 list splicing logic for active I/O
    shutdown with tcm_qla2xxx + ib_srpt fabrics.
    
    The original commit was done under the incorrect assumption that it's safe to
    walk se_sess->sess_cmd_list unprotected in target_wait_for_sess_cmds() after
    sess->sess_tearing_down = 1 has been set by target_sess_cmd_list_set_waiting()
    during session shutdown.
    
    So instead of adding sess->sess_cmd_lock protection around sess->sess_cmd_list
    during target_wait_for_sess_cmds(), switch back to sess->sess_wait_list to
    allow wait_for_completion() + TFO->release_cmd() to occur without having to
    walk ->sess_cmd_list after the list_splice.
    
    Also add a check to exit if target_sess_cmd_list_set_waiting() has already
    been called, and add a WARN_ON to check for any fabric bug where new se_cmds
    are added to sess->sess_cmd_list after sess->sess_tearing_down = 1 has already
    been set.

    fuse: fix readdirplus Oops in fuse_dentry_revalidate
    
    commit 28420dad233520811c0e0860e7fb4975ed863fc4 upstream.
    
    Fix bug introduced by commit 4582a4ab2a "FUSE: Adapt readdirplus to application
    usage patterns".
    
    We need to check for a positive dentry; negative dentries are not added by
    readdirplus.  Secondly we need to advise the use of readdirplus on the *parent*,
    otherwise the whole thing is useless.  Thirdly all this is only relevant if
    "readdirplus_auto" mode is selected by the filesystem.
    
    We advise the use of readdirplus only if the dentry was still valid.  If we had
    to redo the lookup then there was no use in doing the -plus version.

    commit add295a4afbdf5852d004c754c552d692b0fcac8 upstream.

    mac80211: close AP_VLAN interfaces before unregistering all
    
    commit c8aa22db0112f640ac6631347f850879c621840b upstream.
    
    Since Eric's commit efe117ab8 ("Speedup ieee80211_remove_interfaces")
    there's a bug in mac80211 when it unregisters with AP_VLAN interfaces
    up. If the AP_VLAN interface was registered after the AP it belongs
    to (which is the typical case) and then we get into this code path,
    unregister_netdevice_many() will crash because it isn't prepared to
    deal with interfaces being closed in the middle of it. Exactly this
    happens though, because we iterate the list, find the AP master this
    AP_VLAN belongs to and dev_close() the dependent VLANs. After this,
    unregister_netdevice_many() won't pick up the fact that the AP_VLAN
    is already down and will do it again, causing a crash.

    mac80211: fix direct probe auth
    
    commit 6211dd12da609bc6893b9c3182630b494737ec4b upstream.
    
    We send direct probe to broadcast address, as some APs do not respond to
    unicast PROBE frames when unassociated. Broadcast frames are not acked,
    so we can not use that for trigger MLME state machine, but we need to
    use old timeout mechanism.
    
    This fixes authentication timed out like below:
    
    [ 1024.671974] wlan6: authenticate with 54:e6:fc:98:63:fe
    [ 1024.694125] wlan6: direct probe to 54:e6:fc:98:63:fe (try 1/3)
    [ 1024.695450] wlan6: direct probe to 54:e6:fc:98:63:fe (try 2/3)
    [ 1024.700586] wlan6: send auth to 54:e6:fc:98:63:fe (try 3/3)
    [ 1024.701441] wlan6: authentication with 54:e6:fc:98:63:fe timed out
    
    With fix, we have:
    
    [ 4524.198978] wlan6: authenticate with 54:e6:fc:98:63:fe
    [ 4524.220692] wlan6: direct probe to 54:e6:fc:98:63:fe (try 1/3)

    Like on UL30VT, the ACPI video driver can't control backlight correctly on
    Asus UL30A.  Vendor driver (asus-laptop) can work.  This patch is to
    add "Asus UL30A" to ACPI video detect blacklist in order to use

    ACPI / PM: Allow device power states to be used for CONFIG_PM unset
    
    commit ec4602a9588a196fa1a9af46bfdd37cbf5792db4 upstream.
    
    Currently, drivers/acpi/device_pm.c depends on CONFIG_PM and all of
    the functions defined in there are replaced with static inline stubs
    if that option is unset.  However, CONFIG_PM means, roughly, "runtime
    PM or suspend/hibernation support" and some of those functions are
    useful regardless of that.  For example, they are used by the ACPI
    fan driver for controlling fans and acpi_device_set_power() is called
    during device removal.  Moreover, device initialization may depend on
    setting device power states properly.
    
    For these reasons, make the routines manipulating ACPI device power
    states defined in drivers/acpi/device_pm.c available for CONFIG_PM
    unset too.

    commit 925fe08bce38d1ff052fe2209b9e2b8d5fbb7f98 upstream.
    
    Current driver does not clear the IOMMU event log interrupt bit
    in the IOMMU status register after processing an interrupt.
    This causes the IOMMU hardware to generate event log interrupt only once.
    This has been observed in both IOMMU v1 and V2 hardware.
    This patch clears the bit by writing 1 to bit 1 of the IOMMU
    status register (MMIO Offset 2020h)

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix aggregation drain flow
    
    commit e3d4bc8cc0230e8dc8033484666f03f87392a8c4 upstream.
    
    Move the counter for non-AMPDU frames to mvm. It is needed
    for the drain flow which happens once the ieee80211_sta has
    been freed, so keeping it in iwl_mvm_sta which is embed into
    ieee80211_sta is not a good idea.
    
    Also, since its purpose it to remove the STA in the fw only
    after all the frames for this station have exited the shared
    Tx queues, we need to decrement it in the reclaim flow. This
    flow can happen after ieee80211_sta has been removed, which
    means that we have no iwl_mvm_sta there. So we can't know
    what is the vif type. Hence, we know audit these frames for
    all the vif types.
    In order to avoid spawning sta_drained_wk all the time, we
    now check that we are in a flow in which draining might
    happen - only when mvmsta is NULL. This is better than
    previous code that would spawn sta_drained_wk all the time
    in AP mode.

    jfs: fix a couple races
    
    commit 73aaa22d5ffb2630456bac2f9a4ed9b81d0d7271 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes races uncovered by xfstests testcase 068.
    
    One race is the result of jfs_sync() trying to write a sync point to the
    journal after it has been frozen (or possibly in the process). Since
    freezing sync's the journal, there is no need to write a sync point so
    we simply want to return.
    
    The second involves jfs_write_inode() being called on a deleted inode.
    It calls jfs_flush_journal which is held up by the jfs_commit thread
    doing the final iput on the same deleted inode, which itself is
    waiting for the I_SYNC flag to be cleared. jfs_write_inode need not
    do anything when i_nlink is zero, which is the easy fix.

    reiserfs: fix spurious multiple-fill in reiserfs_readdir_dentry
    
    commit 0bdc7acba56a7ca4232f15f37b16f7ec079385ab upstream.
    
    After sleeping for filldir(), we check to see if the file system has
    changed and research. The next_pos pointer is updated but its value
    isn't pushed into the key used for the search itself. As a result,
    the search returns the same item that the last cycle of the loop did
    and filldir() is called multiple times with the same data.
    
    The end result is that the buffer can contain the same name multiple
    times. This can be returned to userspace or used internally in the
    xattr code where it can manifest with the following warning:
    
    jdm-20004 reiserfs_delete_xattrs: Couldn't delete all xattrs (-2)
    
    reiserfs_for_each_xattr uses reiserfs_readdir_dentry to iterate over
    the xattr names and ends up trying to unlink the same name twice. The
    second attempt fails with -ENOENT and the error is returned. At some
    point I'll need to add support into reiserfsck to remove the orphaned
    directories left behind when this occurs.
    
    The fix is to push the value into the key before researching.

    reiserfs: fix problems with chowning setuid file w/ xattrs
    
    commit 4a8570112b76a63ad21cfcbe2783f98f7fd5ba1b upstream.
    
    reiserfs_chown_xattrs() takes the iattr struct passed into ->setattr
    and uses it to iterate over all the attrs associated with a file to change
    ownership of xattrs (and transfer quota associated with the xattr files).
    
    When the setuid bit is cleared during chown, ATTR_MODE and iattr->ia_mode
    are passed to all the xattrs as well. This means that the xattr directory
    will have S_IFREG added to its mode bits.
    
    This has been prevented in practice by a missing IS_PRIVATE check
    in reiserfs_acl_chmod, which caused a double-lock to occur while holding
    the write lock. Since the file system was completely locked up, the
    writeout of the corrupted mode never happened.
    
    This patch temporarily clears everything but ATTR_UID|ATTR_GID for the
    calls to reiserfs_setattr and adds the missing IS_PRIVATE check.

    reiserfs: fix deadlock with nfs racing on create/lookup
    
    commit a1457c0ce976bad1356b9b0437f2a5c3ab8a9cfc upstream.
    
    Reiserfs is currently able to be deadlocked by having two NFS clients
    where one has removed and recreated a file and another is accessing the
    file with an open file handle.
    
    If one client deletes and recreates a file with timing such that the
    recreated file obtains the same [dirid, objectid] pair as the original
    file while another client accesses the file via file handle, the create
    and lookup can race and deadlock if the lookup manages to create the
    in-memory inode first.
    
    The create thread, in insert_inode_locked4, will hold the write lock
    while waiting on the other inode to be unlocked. The lookup thread,
    anywhere in the iget path, will release and reacquire the write lock while
    it schedules. If it needs to reacquire the lock while the create thread
    has it, it will never be able to make forward progress because it needs
    to reacquire the lock before ultimately unlocking the inode.
    
    This patch drops the write lock across the insert_inode_locked4 call so
    that the ordering of inode_wait -> write lock is retained. Since this
    would have been the case before the BKL push-down, this is safe.

    powerpc/pseries: Always enable CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU on PSERIES SMP
    
    commit f274ef8747d3be649bba8708696fb31cb00fa75a upstream.
    
    Adam Lackorzynski reported the following build failure on
    !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU configuration:
    
      CC      arch/powerpc/kernel/rtas.o
    arch/powerpc/kernel/rtas.c: In function ‚Äòrtas_cpu_state_change_mask‚Äô:
    arch/powerpc/kernel/rtas.c:843:4: error: implicit declaration of function ‚Äòcpu_down‚Äô [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
    make[1]: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel/rtas.o] Error 1
    make: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel] Error 2
    
    The build fails because cpu_down() is defined only under CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.
    
    Looking further, the mobility code in pseries is one of the call-sites which
    uses rtas_ibm_suspend_me(), which in turn calls rtas_cpu_state_change_mask().
    And the mobility code is unconditionally compiled-in (it does not fall under
    any Kconfig option). And commit 120496ac (powerpc: Bring all threads online
    prior to migration/hibernation) which introduced this build regression is
    critical for the proper functioning of the migration code. So it appears
    that the only solution to this problem is to enable CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU if
    SMP is enabled on PPC_PSERIES platforms. So make that change in the Kconfig.

    commit 1d19f7800d643b270b28d0a969c5eca455d54397 upstream.
    
    Given that srpt_release_channel_work() calls target_wait_for_sess_cmds()
    to allow outstanding se_cmd_t->cmd_kref a change to complete, the call

    Also, this patch adds an explicit call to srpt_shutdown_session() within
    srpt_drain_channel() so that target_sess_cmd_list_set_waiting() will be
    called in the cases where TFO->shutdown_session() is not triggered
    directly by TCM.

    powerpc/tm: Abort on emulation and alignment faults
    
    commit 6ce6c629fd8254b3177650de99699682ff7f6707 upstream.
    
    If we are emulating an instruction inside an active user transaction that
    touches memory, the kernel can't emulate it as it operates in transactional
    suspend context.  We need to abort these transactions and send them back to
    userspace for the hardware to rollback.
    
    We can service these if the user transaction is in suspend mode, since the
    kernel will operate in the same suspend context.
    
    This adds a check to all alignment faults and to specific instruction
    emulations (only string instructions for now).  If the user process is in an
    active (non-suspended) transaction, we abort the transaction go back to
    userspace allowing the HW to roll back the transaction and tell the user of the
    failure.  This also adds new tm abort cause codes to report the reason of the
    persistent error to the user.

    powerpc/tm: Fix userspace stack corruption on signal delivery for active transactions
    
    commit 2b3f8e87cf99a33fb6faf5026d7147748bbd77b6 upstream.
    
    When in an active transaction that takes a signal, we need to be careful with
    the stack.  It's possible that the stack has moved back up after the tbegin.
    The obvious case here is when the tbegin is called inside a function that
    returns before a tend.  In this case, the stack is part of the checkpointed
    transactional memory state.  If we write over this non transactionally or in
    suspend, we are in trouble because if we get a tm abort, the program counter
    and stack pointer will be back at the tbegin but our in memory stack won't be
    valid anymore.
    
    To avoid this, when taking a signal in an active transaction, we need to use
    the stack pointer from the checkpointed state, rather than the speculated
    state.  This ensures that the signal context (written tm suspended) will be
    written below the stack required for the rollback.  The transaction is aborted
    becuase of the treclaim, so any memory written between the tbegin and the
    signal will be rolled back anyway.
    
    For signals taken in non-TM or suspended mode, we use the
    normal/non-checkpointed stack pointer.

    powerpc/32bit:Store temporary result in r0 instead of r8
    
    commit f7b3367774f92a688d39ed767f0ae9b93af7873a upstream.
    
    Commit a9c4e541ea9b22944da356f2a9258b4eddcc953b
    "powerpc/kprobe: Complete kprobe and migrate exception frame"
    introduced a regression:
    
    While returning from exception handling in case of PREEMPT enabled,
    _TIF_NEED_RESCHED bit is checked in TI_FLAGS (thread_info flag) of current
    task. Only if this bit is set, it should continue with the process of
    calling preempt_schedule_irq() to schedule highest priority task if
    available.
    
    Current code assumes that r8 contains TI_FLAGS and check this for
    _TIF_NEED_RESCHED, but as r8 is modified in the code which executes before
    this check, r8 no longer contains the expected TI_FLAGS information.
    
    As a result check for comparison with _TIF_NEED_RESCHED was failing even if
    NEED_RESCHED bit is set in the current thread_info flag. Due to this,
    preempt_schedule_irq() and in turn scheduler was not getting called even if
    highest priority task is ready for execution.
    
    So, store temporary results in r0 instead of r8 to prevent r8 from getting
    modified as subsequent code is dependent on its value.

    cgroup: fix a subtle bug in descendant pre-order walk
    
    commit 7805d000db30a3787a4c969bab6ae4d8a5fd8ce6 upstream.
    
    When cgroup_next_descendant_pre() initiates a walk, it checks whether
    the subtree root doesn't have any children and if not returns NULL.
    Later code assumes that the subtree isn't empty.  This is broken
    because the subtree may become empty inbetween, which can lead to the
    traversal escaping the subtree by walking to the sibling of the
    subtree root.
    
    There's no reason to have the early exit path.  Remove it along with
    the later assumption that the subtree isn't empty.  This simplifies
    the code a bit and fixes the subtle bug.
    
    While at it, fix the comment of cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre() which
    was incorrectly referring to ->css_offline() instead of
    ->css_online().

    cgroup: initialize xattr before calling d_instantiate()
    
    commit d6cbf35dac8a3dadb9103379820c96d7c85df3d9 upstream.
    
    cgroup_create_file() calls d_instantiate(), which may decide to look
    at the xattrs on the file. Smack always does this and SELinux can be
    configured to do so.
    
    But cgroup_add_file() didn't initialize xattrs before calling
    cgroup_create_file(), which finally leads to dereferencing NULL
    dentry->d_fsdata.
    
    This bug has been there since cgroup xattr was introduced.

    m68k/mac: Fix unexpected interrupt with CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK
    
    commit df66834a43c461de2565c45d815288ba1c0def37 upstream.
    
    The present code does not wait for the SCC to finish resetting itself
    before trying to initialise the device. The result is that the SCC
    interrupt sources become enabled (if they weren't already). This leads to
    an early boot crash (unexpected interrupt) given CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK. Fix
    this by adding a delay. A successful reset disables the interrupt sources.
    
    Also, after the reset for channel A setup, the SCC then gets a second
    reset for channel B setup which leaves channel A uninitialised again. Fix
    this by performing the reset only once.

    libata: make ata_exec_internal_sg honor DMADIR
    
    commit e771451c0a831d96a7c14b0ca8a8ec671d98567b upstream.
    
    libata honors DMADIR for regular commands, but not for internal commands
    used (among other) during device initialisation.
    
    This makes SATA-host-to-PATA-device bridges based on Silicon Image SiL3611
    (such as "Abit Serillel 2") end up disabled when used with an ATAPI device
    after a few tries.
    
    Log output of the bridge being hot-plugged with an ATAPI drive:

    sata_rcar: fix interrupt handling
    
    commit 52a2a1087b5924de00484f35ef5e2a73f61dbd22 upstream.
    
    The driver's interrupt handling code is too picky in deciding whether it should
    handle an interrupt or not which causes completely unneeded spurious interrupts.
    Thus make sata_rcar_{ata|serr}_interrupt() *void*; add ATA status register read
    to sata_rcar_ata_interrupt() to clear an unexpected ATA interrupt -- it doesn't
    get cleared by writing to the SATAINTSTAT register in the interrupt mode we use.
    
    Also, in sata_rcar_ata_interrupt() we should check SATAINTSTAT register only for
    enabled interrupts and we should clear  only those interrupts  that we have read
    as active first time around, because else we have  a  race and risk clearing  an
    interrupt that  can  occur between read  and write of the  SATAINTSTAT  register
    and never registering it...

    sata_rcar: clear STOP bit in bmdma_start() method
    
    commit df7e131f6359f20ed8f0a37db039c4f6420a18c2 upstream.
    
    Iff bmdma_setup() has to stop a DMA transfer before starting a new
    one, then the STOP bit in the ATAPI_CONTROL1 register will remain set
    (it's only cleared when setting the START bit to 1) and then
    bmdma_start() method will set both START and STOP bits simultaneously
    which should abort the transfer being just started.  Avoid that by
    explicitly clearing the STOP bit in bmdma_start() method (in this case
    it will be ignored on write).

    Consider the case where we have a very short ip= string in the original

    IPv6 address. Be sure to allow for that possibility when estimating the
    size of the string to allocate.

    x86, crc32-pclmul: Fix build with older binutils
    
    commit 2baad6121e2b2fa3428ee6cb2298107be11ab23a upstream.
    
    binutils prior to 2.18 (e.g. the ones found on SLE10) don't support
    assembling PEXTRD, so a macro based approach like the one for PCLMULQDQ
    in the same file should be used.
    
    This requires making the helper macros capable of recognizing 32-bit
    general purpose register operands.

    x86-64, init: Fix a possible wraparound bug in switchover in head_64.S
    
    commit e9d0626ed43a41a3fc526d1df06122b0d4eac174 upstream.
    
    In head_64.S, a switchover has been used to handle kernel crossing
    1G, 512G boundaries.
    
    And commit 8170e6bed465b4b0c7687f93e9948aca4358a33b
        x86, 64bit: Use a #PF handler to materialize early mappings on demand
    said:
        During the switchover in head_64.S, before #PF handler is available,
        we use three pages to handle kernel crossing 1G, 512G boundaries with
        sharing page by playing games with page aliasing: the same page is
        mapped twice in the higher-level tables with appropriate wraparound.
    
    But from the switchover code, when we set up the PUD table:
    114         addq    $4096, %rdx
    115         movq    %rdi, %rax
    116         shrq    $PUD_SHIFT, %rax
    117         andl    $(PTRS_PER_PUD-1), %eax
    118         movq    %rdx, (4096+0)(%rbx,%rax,8)
    119         movq    %rdx, (4096+8)(%rbx,%rax,8)
    
    It seems line 119 has a potential bug there. For example,
    if the kernel is loaded at physical address 511G+1008M, that is
        000000000 111111111 111111000 000000000000000000000
    and the kernel _end is 512G+2M, that is
        000000001 000000000 000000001 000000000000000000000
    So in this example, when using the 2nd page to setup PUD (line 114~119),
    rax is 511.
    In line 118, we put rdx which is the address of the PMD page (the 3rd page)
    into entry 511 of the PUD table. But in line 119, the entry we calculate from
    (4096+8)(%rbx,%rax,8) has exceeded the PUD page. IMO, the entry in line
    119 should be wraparound into entry 0 of the PUD table.
    
    The patch fixes the bug.

    x86: Allow FPU to be used at interrupt time even with eagerfpu
    
    commit 5187b28ff08249ab8a162e802209ed04e271ca02 upstream.
    
    With the addition of eagerfpu the irq_fpu_usable() now returns false
    negatives especially in the case of ksoftirqd and interrupted idle task,
    two common cases for FPU use for example in networking/crypto.  With
    eagerfpu=off FPU use is possible in those contexts.  This is because of
    the eagerfpu check in interrupted_kernel_fpu_idle():
    
    ...
      * For now, with eagerfpu we will return interrupted kernel FPU
      * state as not-idle. TBD: Ideally we can change the return value
      * to something like __thread_has_fpu(current). But we need to
      * be careful of doing __thread_clear_has_fpu() before saving
      * the FPU etc for supporting nested uses etc. For now, take
      * the simple route!
    ...
            if (use_eager_fpu())
                    return 0;
    
    As eagerfpu is automatically "on" on those CPUs that also have the
    features like AES-NI this patch changes the eagerfpu check to return 1 in
    case the kernel_fpu_begin() has not been said yet.  Once it has been the
    __thread_has_fpu() will start returning 0.
    
    Notice that with eagerfpu the __thread_has_fpu is always true initially.
    FPU use is thus always possible no matter what task is under us, unless
    the state has already been saved with kernel_fpu_begin().
    
    [ hpa: this is a performance regression, not a correctness regression,
      but since it can be quite serious on CPUs which need encryption at
      interrupt time I am marking this for urgent/stable. ]

    mm/pagewalk.c: walk_page_range should avoid VM_PFNMAP areas
    
    commit a9ff785e4437c83d2179161e012f5bdfbd6381f0 upstream.
    
    A panic can be caused by simply cat'ing /proc/<pid>/smaps while an
    application has a VM_PFNMAP range.  It happened in-house when a
    benchmarker was trying to decipher the memory layout of his program.
    
    /proc/<pid>/smaps and similar walks through a user page table should not
    be looking at VM_PFNMAP areas.
    
    Certain tests in walk_page_range() (specifically split_huge_page_pmd())
    assume that all the mapped PFN's are backed with page structures.  And
    this is not usually true for VM_PFNMAP areas.  This can result in panics
    on kernel page faults when attempting to address those page structures.
    
    There are a half dozen callers of walk_page_range() that walk through a
    task's entire page table (as N.  Horiguchi pointed out).  So rather than
    change all of them, this patch changes just walk_page_range() to ignore
    VM_PFNMAP areas.
    
    The logic of hugetlb_vma() is moved back into walk_page_range(), as we
    want to test any vma in the range.
    
    VM_PFNMAP areas are used by:
    - graphics memory manager   gpu/drm/drm_gem.c
    - global reference unit     sgi-gru/grufile.c
    - sgi special memory        char/mspec.c
    - and probably several out-of-tree modules

    mm: memcg: remove incorrect VM_BUG_ON for swap cache pages in uncharge
    
    commit 28ccddf7952c496df2a51ce5aee4f2a058a98bab upstream.
    
    Commit 0c59b89c81ea ("mm: memcg: push down PageSwapCache check into
    uncharge entry functions") added a VM_BUG_ON() on PageSwapCache in the
    uncharge path after checking that page flag once, assuming that the
    state is stable in all paths, but this is not the case and the condition
    triggers in user environments.  An uncharge after the last page table
    reference to the page goes away can race with reclaim adding the page to
    swap cache.
    
    Swap cache pages are usually uncharged when they are freed after
    swapout, from a path that also handles swap usage accounting and memcg
    lifetime management.  However, since the last page table reference is
    gone and thus no references to the swap slot left, the swap slot will be
    freed shortly when reclaim attempts to write the page to disk.  The
    whole swap accounting is not even necessary.
    
    So while the race condition for which this VM_BUG_ON was added is real
    and actually existed all along, there are no negative effects.  Remove
    the VM_BUG_ON again.

    mm: mmu_notifier: re-fix freed page still mapped in secondary MMU
    
    commit d34883d4e35c0a994e91dd847a82b4c9e0c31d83 upstream.
    
    Commit 751efd8610d3 ("mmu_notifier_unregister NULL Pointer deref and
    multiple ->release()") breaks the fix 3ad3d901bbcf ("mm: mmu_notifier:
    fix freed page still mapped in secondary MMU").
    
    Since hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() is changed now, we can not revert that
    patch directly, so this patch reverts the commit and simply fix the bug
    spotted by that patch
    
    This bug spotted by commit 751efd8610d3 is:
    
        There is a race condition between mmu_notifier_unregister() and
        __mmu_notifier_release().
    
        Assume two tasks, one calling mmu_notifier_unregister() as a result
        of a filp_close() ->flush() callout (task A), and the other calling
        mmu_notifier_release() from an mmput() (task B).
    
                            A                               B
        t1                                            srcu_read_lock()
        t2            if (!hlist_unhashed())
        t3                                            srcu_read_unlock()
        t4            srcu_read_lock()
        t5                                            hlist_del_init_rcu()
        t6                                            synchronize_srcu()
        t7            srcu_read_unlock()
        t8            hlist_del_rcu()  <--- NULL pointer deref.
    
    This can be fixed by using hlist_del_init_rcu instead of hlist_del_rcu.
    
    The another issue spotted in the commit is "multiple ->release()
    callouts", we needn't care it too much because it is really rare (e.g,
    can not happen on kvm since mmu-notify is unregistered after
    exit_mmap()) and the later call of multiple ->release should be fast
    since all the pages have already been released by the first call.
    Anyway, this issue should be fixed in a separate patch.

    nilfs2: fix issue of nilfs_set_page_dirty() for page at EOF boundary
    
    commit 136e8770cd5d1fe38b3c613100dd6dc4db6d4fa6 upstream.
    
    nilfs2: fix issue of nilfs_set_page_dirty for page at EOF boundary
    
    DESCRIPTION:
     There are use-cases when NILFS2 file system (formatted with block size
    lesser than 4 KB) can be remounted in RO mode because of encountering of
    "broken bmap" issue.
    
    The issue was reported by Anthony Doggett <Anthony2486@interfaces.org.uk>:
     "The machine I've been trialling nilfs on is running Debian Testing,
      Linux version 3.2.0-4-686-pae (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc
      version 4.6.3 (Debian 4.6.3-14) ) #1 SMP Debian 3.2.35-2), but I've
      also reproduced it (identically) with Debian Unstable amd64 and Debian
      Experimental (using the 3.8-trunk kernel).  The problematic partitions
      were formatted with "mkfs.nilfs2 -b 1024 -B 8192"."
    
    SYMPTOMS:
    (1) System log contains error messages likewise:
    
        [63102.496756] nilfs_direct_assign: invalid pointer: 0
        [63102.496786] NILFS error (device dm-17): nilfs_bmap_assign: broken bmap (inode number=28)
        [63102.496798]
        [63102.524403] Remounting filesystem read-only
    
    (2) The NILFS2 file system is remounted in RO mode.
    
    REPRODUSING PATH:
    (1) Create volume group with name "unencrypted" by means of vgcreate utility.
    (2) Run script (prepared by Anthony Doggett <Anthony2486@interfaces.org.uk>):
    
    ----------------[BEGIN SCRIPT]--------------------
    
    VG=unencrypted
    lvcreate --size 2G --name ntest $VG
    mkfs.nilfs2 -b 1024 -B 8192 /dev/mapper/$VG-ntest
    mkdir /var/tmp/n
    mkdir /var/tmp/n/ntest
    mount /dev/mapper/$VG-ntest /var/tmp/n/ntest
    mkdir /var/tmp/n/ntest/thedir
    cd /var/tmp/n/ntest/thedir
    sleep 2
    date
    darcs init
    sleep 2
    dmesg|tail -n 5
    date
    darcs whatsnew || true
    date
    sleep 2
    dmesg|tail -n 5
    ----------------[END SCRIPT]--------------------
    
    REPRODUCIBILITY: 100%
    
    INVESTIGATION:
    As it was discovered, the issue takes place during segment
    construction after executing such sequence of user-space operations:
    
      open("_darcs/index", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY, 0666) = 7
      fstat(7, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
      ftruncate(7, 60)
    
    The error message "NILFS error (device dm-17): nilfs_bmap_assign: broken
    bmap (inode number=28)" takes place because of trying to get block
    number for third block of the file with logical offset #3072 bytes.  As
    it is possible to see from above output, the file has 60 bytes of the
    whole size.  So, it is enough one block (1 KB in size) allocation for
    the whole file.  Trying to operate with several blocks instead of one
    takes place because of discovering several dirty buffers for this file
    in nilfs_segctor_scan_file() method.
    
    The root cause of this issue is in nilfs_set_page_dirty function which
    is called just before writing to an mmapped page.
    
    When nilfs_page_mkwrite function handles a page at EOF boundary, it
    fills hole blocks only inside EOF through __block_page_mkwrite().
    
    The __block_page_mkwrite() function calls set_page_dirty() after filling
    hole blocks, thus nilfs_set_page_dirty function (=
    a_ops->set_page_dirty) is called.  However, the current implementation
    of nilfs_set_page_dirty() wrongly marks all buffers dirty even for page
    at EOF boundary.
    
    As a result, buffers outside EOF are inconsistently marked dirty and
    queued for write even though they are not mapped with nilfs_get_block
    function.
    
    FIX:
    This modifies nilfs_set_page_dirty() not to mark hole blocks dirty.
    
    Thanks to Vyacheslav Dubeyko for his effort on analysis and proposals
    for this issue.

    wait: fix false timeouts when using wait_event_timeout()
    
    commit 4c663cfc523a88d97a8309b04a089c27dc57fd7e upstream.
    
    Many callers of the wait_event_timeout() and
    wait_event_interruptible_timeout() expect that the return value will be
    positive if the specified condition becomes true before the timeout
    elapses.  However, at the moment this isn't guaranteed.  If the wake-up
    handler is delayed enough, the time remaining until timeout will be
    calculated as 0 - and passed back as a return value - even if the
    condition became true before the timeout has passed.
    
    Fix this by returning at least 1 if the condition becomes true.  This
    semantic is in line with what wait_for_condition_timeout() does; see
    commit bb10ed09 ("sched: fix wait_for_completion_timeout() spurious
    failure under heavy load").
    
    Daniel said "We have 3 instances of this bug in drm/i915.  One case even
    where we switch between the interruptible and not interruptible
    wait_event_timeout variants, foolishly presuming they have the same
    semantics.  I very much like this."

    klist: del waiter from klist_remove_waiters before wakeup waitting process
    
    commit ac5a2962b02f57dea76d314ef2521a2170b28ab6 upstream.
    
    There is a race between klist_remove and klist_release. klist_remove
    uses a local var waiter saved on stack. When klist_release calls
    wake_up_process(waiter->process) to wake up the waiter, waiter might run
    immediately and reuse the stack. Then, klist_release calls
    list_del(&waiter->list) to change previous
    wait data and cause prior waiter thread corrupt.
    
    The patch fixes it against kernel 3.9.

    mm compaction: fix of improper cache flush in migration code
    
    commit c2cc499c5bcf9040a738f49e8051b42078205748 upstream.
    
    Page 'new' during MIGRATION can't be flushed with flush_cache_page().
    Using flush_cache_page(vma, addr, pfn) is justified only if the page is
    already placed in process page table, and that is done right after
    flush_cache_page().  But without it the arch function has no knowledge
    of process PTE and does nothing.
    
    Besides that, flush_cache_page() flushes an application cache page, but
    the kernel has a different page virtual address and dirtied it.
    
    Replace it with flush_dcache_page(new) which is the proper usage.
    
    The old page is flushed in try_to_unmap_one() before migration.
    
    This bug takes place in Sead3 board with M14Kc MIPS CPU without cache
    aliasing (but Harvard arch - separate I and D cache) in tight memory
    environment (128MB) each 1-3days on SOAK test.  It fails in cc1 during
    kernel build (SIGILL, SIGBUS, SIGSEG) if CONFIG_COMPACTION is switched
    ON.

    rapidio/tsi721: fix bug in MSI interrupt handling
    
    commit 1ccc819da6fda9bee10ab8b72e9adbb5ad3e4959 upstream.
    
    Fix bug in MSI interrupt handling which causes loss of event
    notifications.
    
    Typical indication of lost MSI interrupts are stalled message and
    doorbell transfers between RapidIO endpoints.  To avoid loss of MSI
    interrupts all interrupts from the device must be disabled on entering
    the interrupt handler routine and re-enabled when exiting it.
    Re-enabling device interrupts will trigger new MSI message(s) if Tsi721
    registered new events since entering interrupt handler routine.
    
    This patch is applicable to kernel versions starting from v3.2.

    drivers/leds/leds-ot200.c: fix error caused by shifted mask
    
    commit 4b949b8af12e24b8a48fa5bb775a13b558d9f4da upstream.
    
    During the development of this driver an in-house register documentation
    was used.  The last week some integration tests were done and this
    problem was found.  It turned out that the released register
    documentation is wrong.
    
    The fix is very simple: shift all masks by one.

    ocfs2: goto out_unlock if ocfs2_get_clusters_nocache() failed in ocfs2_fiemap()
    
    commit b4ca2b4b577c3530e34dcfaafccb2cc680ce95d1 upstream.
    
    Last time we found there is lock/unlock bug in ocfs2_file_aio_write, and
    then we did a thorough search for all lock resources in
    ocfs2_inode_info, including rw, inode and open lockres and found this
    bug.  My kernel version is 3.0.13, and it is also in the lastest version
    3.9.  In ocfs2_fiemap, once ocfs2_get_clusters_nocache failed, it should
    goto out_unlock instead of out, because we need release buffer head, up
    read alloc sem and unlock inode.

    commit 5a1e99dd2028e00998d42029be86835d8ef4a46e upstream.
    
    The comparison between traced and symbol addresses is backwards: if
    the traced address doesn't exactly match a symbol (which we don't
    expect it to), we'll show the next symbol and the offset to it,
    whereas we should show the previous symbol and the offset from it.

    random: fix accounting race condition with lockless irq entropy_count update
    
    commit 10b3a32d292c21ea5b3ad5ca5975e88bb20b8d68 upstream.
    
    Commit 902c098a3663 ("random: use lockless techniques in the interrupt
    path") turned IRQ path from being spinlock protected into lockless
    cmpxchg-retry update.
    
    That commit removed r->lock serialization between crediting entropy bits
    from IRQ context and accounting when extracting entropy on userspace
    read path, but didn't turn the r->entropy_count reads/updates in
    account() to use cmpxchg as well.
    
    It has been observed, that under certain circumstances this leads to
    read() on /dev/urandom to return 0 (EOF), as r->entropy_count gets
    corrupted and becomes negative, which in turn results in propagating 0
    all the way from account() to the actual read() call.
    
    Convert the accounting code to be the proper lockless counterpart of
    what has been partially done by 902c098a3663.

    drivers/char/random.c: fix priming of last_data
    
    commit 1e7e2e05c179a68aaf8830fe91547a87f4589e53 upstream.
    
    Commit ec8f02da9ea5 ("random: prime last_data value per fips
    requirements") added priming of last_data per fips requirements.
    
    Unfortuantely, it did so in a way that can lead to multiple threads all
    incrementing nbytes, but only one actually doing anything with the extra
    data, which leads to some fun random corruption and panics.
    
    The fix is to simply do everything needed to prime last_data in a single
    shot, so there's no window for multiple cpus to increment nbytes -- in
    fact, we won't even increment or decrement nbytes anymore, we'll just
    extract the needed EXTRACT_SIZE one time per pool and then carry on with
    the normal routine.
    
    All these changes have been tested across multiple hosts and
    architectures where panics were previously encoutered.  The code changes
    are are strictly limited to areas only touched when when booted in fips
    mode.
    
    This change should also go into 3.8-stable, to make the myriads of fips
    users on 3.8.x happy.

    ARC: copy_(to|from)_user() to honor usermode-access permissions
    
    commit a950549c675f2c8c504469dec7d780da8a6433dc upstream.
    
    This manifested as grep failing psuedo-randomly:
    
    -------------->8---------------------
    [ARCLinux]$ ip address show lo | grep inet
    [ARCLinux]$ ip address show lo | grep inet
    [ARCLinux]$ ip address show lo | grep inet
    [ARCLinux]$
    [ARCLinux]$ ip address show lo | grep inet
        inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
    -------------->8---------------------
    
    ARC700 MMU provides fully orthogonal permission bits per page:
    Ur, Uw, Ux, Kr, Kw, Kx
    
    The user mode page permission templates used to have all Kernel mode
    access bits enabled.
    This caused a tricky race condition observed with uClibc buffered file
    read and UNIX pipes.
    
    1. Read access to an anon mapped page in libc .bss: write-protected
       zero_page mapped: TLB Entry installed with Ur + K[rwx]
    
    2. grep calls libc:getc() -> buffered read layer calls read(2) with the
       internal read buffer in same .bss page.
       The read() call is on STDIN which has been redirected to a pipe.
       read(2) => sys_read() => pipe_read() => copy_to_user()
    
    3. Since page has Kernel-write permission (despite being user-mode
       write-protected), copy_to_user() suceeds w/o taking a MMU TLB-Miss
       Exception (page-fault for ARC). core-MM is unaware that kernel
       erroneously wrote to the reserved read-only zero-page (BUG #1)
    
    4. Control returns to userspace which now does a write to same .bss page
       Since Linux MM is not aware that page has been modified by kernel, it
       simply reassigns a new writable zero-init page to mapping, loosing the
       prior write by kernel - effectively zero'ing out the libc read buffer
       under the hood - hence grep doesn't see right data (BUG #2)
    
    The fix is to make all kernel-mode access permissions mirror the
    user-mode ones. Note that the kernel still has full access to pages,
    when accessed directly (w/o MMU) - this fix ensures that kernel-mode
    access in copy_to_from() path uses the same faulting access model as for
    pure user accesses to keep MM fully aware of page state.
    
    The issue is peudo-random because it only shows up if the TLB entry
    installed in #1 is present at the time of #3. If it is evicted out, due
    to TLB pressure or some-such, then copy_to_user() does take a TLB Miss
    Exception, with a routine write-to-anon COW processing installing a
    fresh page for kernel writes and also usable as it is in userspace.
    
    Further the issue was dormant for so long as it depends on where the
    libc internal read buffer (in .bss) is mapped at runtime.
    If it happens to reside in file-backed data mapping of libc (in the
    page-aligned slack space trailing the file backed data), loader zero
    padding the slack space, does the early cow page replacement, setting
    things up at the very beginning itself.
    
    With gcc 4.8 based builds, the libc buffer got pushed out to a real
    anon mapping which triggers the issue.

    cifs: only set ops for inodes in I_NEW state
    
    commit c2b93e0699723700f886ce17bb65ffd771195a6d upstream.
    
    It's generally not safe to reset the inode ops once they've been set. In
    the case where the inode was originally thought to be a directory and
    then later found to be a DFS referral, this can lead to an oops when we
    try to trigger an inode op on it after changing the ops to the blank
    referral operations.

    USB: UHCI: fix for suspend of virtual HP controller
    
    commit 997ff893603c6455da4c5e26ba1d0f81adfecdfc upstream.
    
    HP's virtual UHCI host controller takes a long time to suspend
    (several hundred microseconds), even when no devices are attached.
    This provokes a warning message from uhci-hcd in the auto-stop case.
    
    To prevent this from happening, this patch adds a test to avoid
    performing an auto-stop when the wait_for_hp quirk flag is set.  The
    controller will still suspend through the normal runtime PM mechanism.
    And since that pathway includes a 1-ms delay, the slowness of the
    virtual hardware won't matter.

    USB: xHCI: override bogus bulk wMaxPacketSize values
    
    commit e4f47e3675e6f1f40906b785b934ce963e9f2eb3 upstream.
    
    This patch shortens the logic in xhci_endpoint_init() by moving common
    calculations involving max_packet and max_burst outside the switch
    statement, rather than repeating the same code in multiple
    case-specific statements.  It also replaces two usages of max_packet
    which were clearly intended to be max_burst all along.
    
    More importantly, it compensates for a common bug in high-speed bulk
    endpoint descriptors.  In many devices there is a bulk endpoint having
    a wMaxPacketSize value smaller than 512, which is forbidden by the USB
    spec.  Some xHCI controllers can't handle this and refuse to accept
    the endpoint.  This patch changes the max_packet value to 512, which
    allows the controller to use the endpoint properly.
    
    In practice the bogus maxpacket size doesn't matter, because none of
    the transfers sent via these endpoints are longer than the maxpacket
    value anyway.

    I meet emacs hang in start if I do the operation below:
      1: echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
      2: emacs BigFile
      3: Press CTRL-S follow 2 immediately
    
    Then emacs hang on, CTRL-Q can't resume, the terminal
    hang on, you can do nothing with this terminal except
    close it.
    
    The reason is before emacs takeover control the tty,
    we use CTRL-S to XOFF it. Then when emacs takeover the
    control, it may don't use the flow-control, so emacs hang.
    This patch fix it.
    
    This patch will fix a kind of strange tty relation hang problem,

    ARM: AM33XX: Add missing .clkdm_name to clkdiv32k_ick clock
    
    commit a6d25f4c951b8b28f2eaec6f891ff834622532f2 upstream.
    
    It is required to enable respective clock-domain before
    enabling any clock/module inside that clock-domain.
    
    During common-clock migration, .clkdm_name field got missed
    for "clkdiv32k_ick" clock, which leaves "clk_24mhz_clkdm"
    unused; so it will be disabled even if childs of this clock-domain
    is enabled, which keeps child modules in idle mode.
    
    This fixes the kernel crash observed on AM335xEVM-SK platform,
    where clkdiv32_ick clock is being used as a gpio debounce clock
    and since clkdiv32k_ick is in idle mode it leads to below crash -

    ARM: plat-orion: Fix num_resources and id for ge10 and ge11
    
    commit 2b8b2797142c7951e635c6eec5d1705ee9bc45c5 upstream.
    
    When platform data were moved from arch/arm/mach-mv78xx0/common.c to
    arch/arm/plat-orion/common.c with the commit "7e3819d ARM: orion:
    Consolidate ethernet platform data", there were few typo made on
    gigabit Ethernet interface ge10 and ge11. This commit writes back
    their initial value, which allows to use this interfaces again.

    USB: fix latency in uhci-hcd and ohci-hcd
    
    commit e1944017839d7dfbf7329fac4bdec8b4050edf5e upstream.
    
    Commits c44b225077bb1fb25ed5cd5c4f226897b91bedd4 (UHCI: implement new
    semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP) and
    6a41b4d3fe8cd4cc95181516fc6fba7b1747a27c (OHCI: implement new
    semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP) increased the latency for isochronous URBs
    in uhci-hcd and ohci-hcd respectively to 2 milliseconds, in an
    attempt to avoid underruns.  It turns out that not only was this
    unnecessary -- 1-ms latency works okay -- it also causes problems with
    certain application loads such as real-time audio.
    
    This patch changes the latency for both drivers back to 1 ms.
    
    This should be applied to -stable kernels going back to 3.8.

    USB: OHCI: fix logic for scheduling isochronous URBs
    
    commit 815fa7b917614261748d1ecd9600ff27f99508e5 upstream.
    
    The isochronous scheduling logic in ohci-hcd has a bug.  The
    calculation for skipping TDs that are too late should be carried out
    only in the !URB_ISO_ASAP case.  When URB_ISO_ASAP is set, the URB is
    pushed back so that none of the TDs are too late, which would cause
    the calculation to overflow.
    
    The patch also fixes the calculation to avoid overflow in the case
    where the frame value wraps around.
    
    This should be applied to -stable kernels going back to 3.8.
