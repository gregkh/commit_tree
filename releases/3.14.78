    ACPI / sysfs: fix error code in get_status()
    
    commit f18ebc211e259d4f591e39e74b2aa2de226c9a1d upstream.
    
    The problem with ornamental, do-nothing gotos is that they lead to
    "forgot to set the error code" bugs.  We should be returning -EINVAL
    here but we don't.  It leads to an uninitalized variable in
    counter_show():
    
        drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:603 counter_show()
        error: uninitialized symbol 'status'.

    staging: comedi: daqboard2000: bug fix board type matching code
    
    commit 80e162ee9b31d77d851b10f8c5299132be1e120f upstream.
    
    `daqboard2000_find_boardinfo()` is supposed to check if the
    DaqBoard/2000 series model is supported, based on the PCI subvendor and
    subdevice ID.  The current code is wrong as it is comparing the PCI
    device's subdevice ID to an expected, fixed value for the subvendor ID.
    It should be comparing the PCI device's subvendor ID to this fixed
    value.  Correct it.

    Input: i8042 - break load dependency between atkbd/psmouse and i8042
    
    commit 4097461897df91041382ff6fcd2bfa7ee6b2448c upstream.
    
    As explained in 1407814240-4275-1-git-send-email-decui@microsoft.com we
    have a hard load dependency between i8042 and atkbd which prevents
    keyboard from working on Gen2 Hyper-V VMs.
    
    > hyperv_keyboard invokes serio_interrupt(), which needs a valid serio
    > driver like atkbd.c.  atkbd.c depends on libps2.c because it invokes
    > ps2_command().  libps2.c depends on i8042.c because it invokes
    > i8042_check_port_owner().  As a result, hyperv_keyboard actually
    > depends on i8042.c.
    >
    > For a Generation 2 Hyper-V VM (meaning no i8042 device emulated), if a
    > Linux VM (like Arch Linux) happens to configure CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=m
    > rather than =y, atkbd.ko can't load because i8042.ko can't load(due to
    > no i8042 device emulated) and finally hyperv_keyboard can't work and
    > the user can't input: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/39820
    > (Ubuntu/RHEL/SUSE aren't affected since they use CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y)
    
    To break the dependency we move away from using i8042_check_port_owner()
    and instead allow serio port owner specify a mutex that clients should use
    to serialize PS/2 command stream.

    fs/seq_file: fix out-of-bounds read
    
    commit 088bf2ff5d12e2e32ee52a4024fec26e582f44d3 upstream.
    
    seq_read() is a nasty piece of work, not to mention buggy.
    
    It has (I think) an old bug which allows unprivileged userspace to read
    beyond the end of m->buf.

        Disabling lock debugging due to kernel taint
    
    This seems to be the same thing that Dave Jones was seeing here:
    
      https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/12/334
    
    There are multiple issues here:
    
      1) If we enter the function with a non-empty buffer, there is an attempt
         to flush it. But it was not clearing m->from after doing so, which
         means that if we try to do this flush twice in a row without any call
         to traverse() in between, we are going to be reading from the wrong
         place -- the splat above, fixed by this patch.
    
      2) If there's a short write to userspace because of page faults, the
         buffer may already contain multiple lines (i.e. pos has advanced by
         more than 1), but we don't save the progress that was made so the
         next call will output what we've already returned previously. Since
         that is a much less serious issue (and I have a headache after
         staring at seq_read() for the past 8 hours), I'll leave that for now.

    The UserMode (UM) Linux build was failing in gpiolib-of as it requires
    ioremap()/iounmap() to exist, which is absent from UM. The non-existence
    of IO memory is negatively defined as CONFIG_NO_IOMEM which means we

    aacraid: Check size values after double-fetch from user
    
    commit fa00c437eef8dc2e7b25f8cd868cfa405fcc2bb3 upstream.
    
    In aacraid's ioctl_send_fib() we do two fetches from userspace, one the
    get the fib header's size and one for the fib itself. Later we use the
    size field from the second fetch to further process the fib. If for some
    reason the size from the second fetch is different than from the first
    fix, we may encounter an out-of- bounds access in aac_fib_send(). We
    also check the sender size to insure it is not out of bounds. This was
    reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116751 and was
    assigned CVE-2016-6480.

    However, hostapd sends a broadcast deauth frame on teardown for which tx
    status is requested. This can lead to the "Have pending ack frames"
    warning on module reload.
    Fix this by using ieee80211_free_txskb/ieee80211_purge_tx_queue.

    s390/dasd: fix hanging device after clear subchannel
    
    commit 9ba333dc55cbb9523553df973adb3024d223e905 upstream.
    
    When a device is in a status where CIO has killed all I/O by itself the
    interrupt for a clear request may not contain an irb to determine the
    clear function. Instead it contains an error pointer -EIO.
    This was ignored by the DASD int_handler leading to a hanging device
    waiting for a clear interrupt.
    
    Handle -EIO error pointer correctly for requests that are clear pending and
    treat the clear as successful.

    usb: xhci: Fix panic if disconnect
    
    commit 88716a93766b8f095cdef37a8e8f2c93aa233b21 upstream.
    
    After a device is disconnected, xhci_stop_device() will be invoked
    in xhci_bus_suspend().
    Also the "disconnect" IRQ will have ISR to invoke

    If xhci->devs[slot_id] has been assigned to NULL in
    xhci_free_virt_device(), then virt_dev->eps[i].ring in
    xhci_stop_device() may point to an invlid address to cause kernel
    panic.
    
    virt_dev = xhci->devs[slot_id];

    USB: validate wMaxPacketValue entries in endpoint descriptors
    
    commit aed9d65ac3278d4febd8665bd7db59ef53e825fe upstream.
    
    Erroneous or malicious endpoint descriptors may have non-zero bits in
    reserved positions, or out-of-bounds values.  This patch helps prevent

    Like the NFP6000, the NFP4000 as an erratum where reading/writing to PCI

    Limit the NFP4000's PF's config space size to 0x600 bytes as is already
    done for the NFP6000.
    
    The NFP4000's VF is 0x6004 (PCI_DEVICE_ID_NETRONOME_NFP6000_VF), the same
    device ID as the NFP6000's VF.  Thus, its config space is already limited
    by the existing use of quirk_nfp6000().

    PCI: Support PCIe devices with short cfg_size
    
    commit c20aecf6963d1273d8f6d61c042b4845441ca592 upstream.
    
    If a device quirk modifies the pci_dev->cfg_size to be less than
    PCI_CFG_SPACE_EXP_SIZE (4096), but greater than PCI_CFG_SPACE_SIZE (256),
    the PCI sysfs interface truncates the readable size to PCI_CFG_SPACE_SIZE.
    
    Allow sysfs access to config space up to cfg_size, even if the device
    doesn't support the entire 4096-byte PCIe config space.
    
    Note that pci_read_config() and pci_write_config() limit access to
    dev->cfg_size even though pcie_config_attr contains 4096 (the maximum
    size).

    parisc: Fix order of EREFUSED define in errno.h
    
    commit 3eb53b20d7bd1374598cfb1feaa081fcac0e76cd upstream.
    
    When building gccgo in userspace, errno.h gets parsed and the go include file
    sysinfo.go is generated.
    
    Since EREFUSED is defined to the same value as ECONNREFUSED, and ECONNREFUSED
    is defined later on in errno.h, this leads to go complaining that EREFUSED
    isn't defined yet.
    
    Fix this trivial problem by moving the define of EREFUSED down after
    ECONNREFUSED in errno.h (and clean up the indenting while touching this line).

    arm64: Define AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH for ARCH_DLINFO
    
    commit 3146bc64d12377a74dbda12b96ea32da3774ae07 upstream.
    
    AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH should be defined with the maximum number of
    NEW_AUX_ENT entries that ARCH_DLINFO can contain, but it wasn't defined
    for arm64 at all even though ARCH_DLINFO will contain one NEW_AUX_ENT
    for the VDSO address.
    
    This shouldn't be a problem as AT_VECTOR_SIZE_BASE includes space for
    AT_BASE_PLATFORM which arm64 doesn't use, but lets define it now and add
    the comment above ARCH_DLINFO as found in several other architectures to
    remind future modifiers of ARCH_DLINFO to keep AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH up to
    date.

    x86/mm: Disable preemption during CR3 read+write
    
    commit 5cf0791da5c162ebc14b01eb01631cfa7ed4fa6e upstream.
    
    There's a subtle preemption race on UP kernels:
    
    Usually current->mm (and therefore mm->pgd) stays the same during the
    lifetime of a task so it does not matter if a task gets preempted during
    the read and write of the CR3.
    
    But then, there is this scenario on x86-UP:
    
    TaskA is in do_exit() and exit_mm() sets current->mm = NULL followed by:
    
     -> mmput()
     -> exit_mmap()
     -> tlb_finish_mmu()
     -> tlb_flush_mmu()
     -> tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly()
     -> tlb_flush()
     -> flush_tlb_mm_range()
     -> __flush_tlb_up()
     -> __flush_tlb()
     ->  __native_flush_tlb()
    
    At this point current->mm is NULL but current->active_mm still points to
    the "old" mm.
    
    Let's preempt taskA _after_ native_read_cr3() by taskB. TaskB has its
    own mm so CR3 has changed.
    
    Now preempt back to taskA. TaskA has no ->mm set so it borrows taskB's
    mm and so CR3 remains unchanged. Once taskA gets active it continues
    where it was interrupted and that means it writes its old CR3 value
    back. Everything is fine because userland won't need its memory
    anymore.
    
    Now the fun part:
    
    Let's preempt taskA one more time and get back to taskB. This
    time switch_mm() won't do a thing because oldmm (->active_mm)
    is the same as mm (as per context_switch()). So we remain
    with a bad CR3 / PGD and return to userland.
    
    The next thing that happens is handle_mm_fault() with an address for
    the execution of its code in userland. handle_mm_fault() realizes that
    it has a PTE with proper rights so it returns doing nothing. But the
    CPU looks at the wrong PGD and insists that something is wrong and
    faults again. And again. And one more time…
    
    This pagefault circle continues until the scheduler gets tired of it and
    puts another task on the CPU. It gets little difficult if the task is a
    RT task with a high priority. The system will either freeze or it gets
    fixed by the software watchdog thread which usually runs at RT-max prio.
    But waiting for the watchdog will increase the latency of the RT task
    which is no good.
    
    Fix this by disabling preemption across the critical code section.
