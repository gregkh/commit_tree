    EDAC: Correct workqueue setup path
    
    commit cb6ef42e516cb8948f15e4b70dc03af8020050a2 upstream.
    
    We're using edac_mc_workq_setup() both on the init path, when
    we load an edac driver and when we change the polling period
    (edac_mc_reset_delay_period) through /sys/.../edac_mc_poll_msec.
    
    On that second path we don't need to init the workqueue which has been
    initialized already.
    
    Thanks to Tejun for workqueue insights.

    EDAC: Poll timeout cannot be zero, p2
    
    commit 9da21b1509d8aa7ab4846722817d16c72d656c91 upstream.
    
    Sanitize code even more to accept unsigned longs only and to not allow
    polling intervals below 1 second as this is unnecessary and doesn't make
    much sense anyway for polling errors.

    drivers/edac/edac_mc_sysfs.c: poll timeout cannot be zero
    
    commit 79040cad3f8235937e229f1b9401ba36dd5ad69b upstream.
    
    If you do
    
      echo 0 > /sys/module/edac_core/parameters/edac_mc_poll_msec
    
    the following stack trace is output because the edac module is not
    designed to poll with a timeout of zero.

    genirq: Add missing irq_to_desc export for CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ=n
    
    commit 2c45aada341121438affc4cb8d5b4cfaa2813d3d upstream.
    
    In allmodconfig builds for sparc and any other arch which does
    not set CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ, the following will be seen at modpost:
    
      CC [M]  lib/cpu-notifier-error-inject.o
      CC [M]  lib/pm-notifier-error-inject.o
    ERROR: "irq_to_desc" [drivers/gpio/gpio-mcp23s08.ko] undefined!
    make[2]: *** [__modpost] Error 1
    
    This happens because commit 3911ff30f5 ("genirq: export
    handle_edge_irq() and irq_to_desc()") added one export for it, but
    there were actually two instances of it, in an if/else clause for
    CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ.  Add the second one.

    commit fc09149df6e20cfbb0bb86f10899607c321a31eb upstream.
    
    This patch addresses a >= v3.11 free-after-use regression
    in core_scsi3_emulate_pro_register() that was introduced
    in the following commit:

        target: Further refactoring of core_scsi3_emulate_pro_register()
    
    To avoid the free-after-use, save an type value before hand, and
    only call core_scsi3_put_pr_reg() with a valid *pr_reg.

    ring-buffer: Fix first commit on sub-buffer having non-zero delta
    
    commit d651aa1d68a2f0a7ee65697b04c6a92f8c0a12f2 upstream.
    
    Each sub-buffer (buffer page) has a full 64 bit timestamp. The events on
    that page use a 27 bit delta against that timestamp in order to save on
    bits written to the ring buffer. If the time between events is larger than
    what the 27 bits can hold, a "time extend" event is added to hold the
    entire 64 bit timestamp again and the events after that hold a delta from
    that timestamp.
    
    As a "time extend" is always paired with an event, it is logical to just
    allocate the event with the time extend, to make things a bit more efficient.
    
    Unfortunately, when the pairing code was written, it removed the "delta = 0"
    from the first commit on a page, causing the events on the page to be
    slightly skewed.

    power: max17040: Fix NULL pointer dereference when there is no platform_data
    
    commit ac323d8d807060f7c95a685a9fe861e7b6300993 upstream.
    
    Fix NULL pointer dereference of "chip->pdata" if platform_data was not
    supplied to the driver.
    
    The driver during probe stored the pointer to the platform_data:
            chip->pdata = client->dev.platform_data;
    Later it was dereferenced in max17040_get_online() and
    max17040_get_status().
    
    If platform_data was not supplied, the NULL pointer exception would
    happen:

    time: Fix overflow when HZ is smaller than 60
    
    commit 80d767d770fd9c697e434fd080c2db7b5c60c6dd upstream.
    
    When compiling for the IA-64 ski emulator, HZ is set to 32 because the
    emulation is slow and we don't want to waste too many cycles processing
    timers. Alpha also has an option to set HZ to 32.
    
    This causes integer underflow in
    kernel/time/jiffies.c:
    kernel/time/jiffies.c:66:2: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Woverflow]
      .mult  = NSEC_PER_JIFFY << JIFFIES_SHIFT, /* details above */
      ^
    
    This patch reduces the JIFFIES_SHIFT value to avoid the overflow.

    i2c: mv64xxx: refactor message start to ensure proper initialization
    
    commit 79970db213344b4a4034645db5ebfc31571f3fa3 upstream.
    
    Because the offload mechanism can fall back to a standard transfer,
    having two seperate initialization states is unfortunate. Let's just
    have one state which does things consistently. This fixes a bug where
    some preparation was missing when the fallback happened. And it makes
    the code much easier to follow. To implement this, we put the check
    if offload is possible at the top of the offload setup function.

    md/raid5: Fix CPU hotplug callback registration
    
    commit 789b5e0315284463617e106baad360cb9e8db3ac upstream.
    
    Subsystems that want to register CPU hotplug callbacks, as well as perform
    initialization for the CPUs that are already online, often do it as shown
    below:
    
            get_online_cpus();
    
            for_each_online_cpu(cpu)
                    init_cpu(cpu);
    
            register_cpu_notifier(&foobar_cpu_notifier);
    
            put_online_cpus();
    
    This is wrong, since it is prone to ABBA deadlocks involving the
    cpu_add_remove_lock and the cpu_hotplug.lock (when running concurrently
    with CPU hotplug operations).
    
    Interestingly, the raid5 code can actually prevent double initialization and
    hence can use the following simplified form of callback registration:
    
            register_cpu_notifier(&foobar_cpu_notifier);
    
            get_online_cpus();
    
            for_each_online_cpu(cpu)
                    init_cpu(cpu);
    
            put_online_cpus();
    
    A hotplug operation that occurs between registering the notifier and calling
    get_online_cpus(), won't disrupt anything, because the code takes care to
    perform the memory allocations only once.
    
    So reorganize the code in raid5 this way to fix the deadlock with callback
    registration.

    md/raid1: restore ability for check and repair to fix read errors.

    Move the bio_reset() to a point before where BIO_UPTODATE is checked,
    so that check now always report that the bio is uptodate, even if it is not.
    
    This causes process_check() to sometimes treat read-errors as

    This patch preserves the flag until it is needed.
    
    Bug was introduced in 3.11, but backported to 3.10-stable (as it fixed
    an even worse bug).  So suitable for any -stable since 3.10.

    tick: Clear broadcast pending bit when switching to oneshot
    
    commit dd5fd9b91a77b4c9c28b7ef9c181b1a875820d0a upstream.
    
    AMD systems which use the C1E workaround in the amd_e400_idle routine
    trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE in the broadcast code when onlining a CPU.
    
    The reason is that the idle routine of those AMD systems switches the
    cpu into forced broadcast mode early on before the newly brought up
    CPU can switch over to high resolution / NOHZ mode. The timer related
    CPU1 bringup looks like this:
    
      clockevent_register_device(local_apic);
      tick_setup(local_apic);
      ...
      idle()
            tick_broadcast_on_off(FORCE);
            tick_broadcast_oneshot_control(ENTER)
              cpumask_set(cpu, broadcast_oneshot_mask);
            halt();
    
    Now the broadcast interrupt on CPU0 sets CPU1 in the
    broadcast_pending_mask and wakes CPU1. So CPU1 continues:
    
            local_apic_timer_interrupt()
               tick_handle_periodic();
               softirq()
                 tick_init_highres();
                   cpumask_clr(cpu, broadcast_oneshot_mask);
    
            tick_broadcast_oneshot_control(ENTER)
               WARN_ON(cpumask_test(cpu, broadcast_pending_mask);
    
    So while we remove CPU1 from the broadcast_oneshot_mask when we switch
    over to highres mode, we do not clear the pending bit, which then
    triggers the warning when we go back to idle.
    
    The reason why this is only visible on C1E affected AMD systems is
    that the other machines enter the deep sleep states via
    acpi_idle/intel_idle and exit the broadcast mode before executing the
    remote triggered local_apic_timer_interrupt. So the pending bit is
    already cleared when the switch over to highres mode is clearing the
    oneshot mask.
    
    The solution is simple: Clear the pending bit together with the mask
    bit when we switch over to highres mode.
    
    Stanislaw came up independently with the same patch by enforcing the
    C1E workaround and debugging the fallout. I picked mine, because mine
    has a changelog :)

    compiler/gcc4: Make quirk for asm_volatile_goto() unconditional
    
    commit a9f180345f5378ac87d80ed0bea55ba421d83859 upstream.
    
    I started noticing problems with KVM guest destruction on Linux
    3.12+, where guest memory wasn't being cleaned up. I bisected it
    down to the commit introducing the new 'asm goto'-based atomics,
    and found this quirk was later applied to those.
    
    Unfortunately, even with GCC 4.8.2 (which ostensibly fixed the
    known 'asm goto' bug) I am still getting some kind of
    miscompilation. If I enable the asm_volatile_goto quirk for my
    compiler, KVM guests are destroyed correctly and the memory is
    cleaned up.
    
    So make the quirk unconditional for now, until bug is found
    and fixed.

    ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Relax the checking of _STA return values
    
    commit 7282059489868e0ed1b0d79765730c6b233a8399 upstream.
    
    The ACPI specification (ACPI 5.0A, Section 6.3.7) says:
    
     _STA may return bit 0 clear (not present) with bit 3 set (device is
     functional). This case is used to indicate a valid device for which
     no device driver should be loaded (for example, a bridge device.)
     Children of this device may be present and valid. OSPM should
     continue enumeration below a device whose _STA returns this bit
     combination.
    
    Evidently, some BIOSes follow that and return 0x0A from _STA, which
    causes problems to happen when they trigger bus check or device check
    notifications for those devices too.  Namely, ACPIPHP thinks that they
    are gone and may drop them, for example, if such a notification is
    triggered during a resume from system suspend.
    
    To fix that, modify ACPICA to regard devies as present and
    functioning if _STA returns both the ACPI_STA_DEVICE_ENABLED
    and ACPI_STA_DEVICE_FUNCTIONING bits set for them.

    When mkfs issues a full device discard and the device only

    blkdev_issue_discard() for a long time. If preempt isn't enabled,
    this can turn into a softlock situation and the kernel will

    block: __elv_next_request() shouldn't call into the elevator if bypassing
    
    commit 556ee818c06f37b2e583af0363e6b16d0e0270de upstream.
    
    request_queue bypassing is used to suppress higher-level function of a
    request_queue so that they can be switched, reconfigured and shut
    down.  A request_queue does the followings while bypassing.
    
    * bypasses elevator and io_cq association and queues requests directly
      to the FIFO dispatch queue.
    
    * bypasses block cgroup request_list lookup and always uses the root
      request_list.
    
    Once confirmed to be bypassing, specific elevator and block cgroup
    policy implementations can assume that nothing is in flight for them
    and perform various operations which would be dangerous otherwise.
    
    Such confirmation is acheived by short-circuiting all new requests
    directly to the dispatch queue and waiting for all the requests which
    were issued before to finish.  Unfortunately, while the request
    allocating and draining sides were properly handled, we forgot to
    actually plug the request dispatch path.  Even after bypassing mode is
    confirmed, if the attached driver tries to fetch a request and the
    dispatch queue is empty, __elv_next_request() would invoke the current
    elevator's elevator_dispatch_fn() callback.  As all in-flight requests
    were drained, the elevator wouldn't contain any request but once
    bypass is confirmed we don't even know whether the elevator is even
    there.  It might be in the process of being switched and half torn
    down.
    
    Frank Mayhar reports that this actually happened while switching
    elevators, leading to an oops.
    
    Let's fix it by making __elv_next_request() avoid invoking the
    elevator_dispatch_fn() callback if the queue is bypassing.  It already
    avoids invoking the callback if the queue is dying.  As a dying queue
    is guaranteed to be bypassing, we can simply replace blk_queue_dying()
    check with blk_queue_bypass().

    Modpost: fixed USB alias generation for ranges including 0x9 and 0xA
    
    commit 03b56329f9bb5a1cb73d7dc659d529a9a9bf3acc upstream.
    
    Commit afe2dab4f6 ("USB: add hex/bcd detection to usb modalias generation")
    changed the routine that generates alias ranges. Before that change, only
    digits 0-9 were supported; the commit tried to fix the case when the range
    includes higher values than 0x9.
    
    Unfortunately, the commit didn't fix the case when the range includes both
    0x9 and 0xA, meaning that the final range must look like [x-9A-y] where
    x <= 0x9 and y >= 0xA -- instead the [x-9A-x] range was produced.
    
    Modprobe doesn't complain as it sees no difference between no-match and
    bad-pattern results of fnmatch().
    
    Fixing this simple bug to fix the aliases.
    Also changing the hardcoded beginning of the range to uppercase as all the
    other letters are also uppercase in the device version numbers.
    
    Fortunately, this affects only the dvb-usb-dib0700 module, AFAIK.

    Revert "usbcore: set lpm_capable field for LPM capable root hubs"
    
    commit 140e3026a57ab7d830dab2f2c57796c222db0ea9 upstream.
    
    Commit 9df89d85b407690afa46ddfbccc80bec6869971d "usbcore: set
    lpm_capable field for LPM capable root hubs" was created under the
    assumption that all USB host controllers should have USB 3.0 Link PM
    enabled for all devices under the hosts.
    
    Unfortunately, that's not the case.  The xHCI driver relies on knowledge
    of the host hardware scheduler to calculate the LPM U1/U2 timeout
    values, and it only sets lpm_capable to one for Intel host controllers
    (that have the XHCI_LPM_SUPPORT quirk set).
    
    When LPM is enabled for some Fresco Logic hosts, it causes failures with
    a AgeStar 3UBT USB 3.0 hard drive dock:

    xhci 1.0: Limit arbitrarily-aligned scatter gather.
    
    commit 247bf557273dd775505fb9240d2d152f4f20d304 upstream.
    
    xHCI 1.0 hosts have a set of requirements on how to align transfer
    buffers on the endpoint rings called "TD fragment" rules.  When the
    ax88179_178a driver added support for scatter gather in 3.12, with
    commit 804fad45411b48233b48003e33a78f290d227c8 "USBNET: ax88179_178a:
    enable tso if usb host supports sg dma", it broke the device under xHCI
    1.0 hosts.  Under certain network loads, the device would see an
    unexpected short packet from the host, which would cause the device to
    stop sending ethernet packets, even through USB packets would still be
    sent.
    
    Commit 35773dac5f86 "usb: xhci: Link TRB must not occur within a USB
    payload burst" attempted to fix this.  It was a quick hack to partially
    implement the TD fragment rules.  However, it caused regressions in the
    usb-storage layer and userspace USB drivers using libusb.  The patches
    to attempt to fix this are too far reaching into the USB core, and we
    really need to implement the TD fragment rules correctly in the xHCI
    driver, instead of continuing to wallpaper over the issues.
    
    Disable arbitrarily-aligned scatter-gather in the xHCI driver for 1.0
    hosts.  Only the ax88179_178a driver checks the no_sg_constraint flag,
    so don't set it for 1.0 hosts.  This should not impact usb-storage or
    usbfs behavior, since they pass down max packet sized aligned sg-list
    entries (512 for USB 2.0 and 1024 for USB 3.0).

    usb-storage: enable multi-LUN scanning when needed
    
    commit 823d12c95c666fa7ab7dad208d735f6bc6afabdc upstream.
    
    People sometimes create their own custom-configured kernels and forget
    to enable CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN.  This causes problems when they plug
    in a USB storage device (such as a card reader) with more than one
    LUN.
    
    Fortunately, we can tell fairly easily when a storage device claims to
    have more than one LUN.  When that happens, this patch asks the SCSI
    layer to probe all the LUNs automatically, regardless of the config
    setting.
    
    The patch also updates the Kconfig help text for usb-storage,
    explaining that CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN may be necessary.

    usb-storage: restrict bcdDevice range for Super Top in Cypress ATACB
    
    commit a9c143c82608bee2a36410caa56d82cd86bdc7fa upstream.
    
    The Cypress ATACB unusual-devs entry for the Super Top SATA bridge
    causes problems.  Although it was originally reported only for
    bcdDevice = 0x160, its range was much larger.  This resulted in a bug
    report for bcdDevice 0x220, so the range was capped at 0x219.  Now
    Milan reports errors with bcdDevice 0x150.
    
    Therefore this patch restricts the range to just 0x160.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Don't timeout during the initial connection with host
    
    commit 269f979467cf49f2ea8132316c1f00f8c9678f7c upstream.
    
    When the guest attempts to connect with the host when there may already be a
    connection with the host (as would be the case during the kdump/kexec path),
    it is difficult to guarantee timely response from the host. Starting with
    WS2012 R2, the host supports this ability to re-connect with the host
    (explicitly to support kexec). Prior to responding to the guest, the host
    needs to ensure that device states based on the previous connection to
    the host have been properly torn down. This may introduce unbounded delays.
    To deal with this issue, don't do a timed wait during the initial connect
    with the host.

    VME: Correct read/write alignment algorithm
    
    commit f0342e66b397947ed8c3eef8c37b5ca2d5b1bb50 upstream.
    
    In order to ensure the correct width cycles on the VME bus, the VME bridge
    drivers implement an algorithm to utilise the largest possible width reads and
    writes whilst maintaining natural alignment constraints. The algorithm
    currently looks at the start address rather than the current read/write address
    when determining whether a 16-bit width cycle is required to get to 32-bit
    alignment.  This results in incorrect alignment,

    ftrace/x86: Use breakpoints for converting function graph caller
    
    commit 87fbb2ac6073a7039303517546a76074feb14c84 upstream.
    
    When the conversion was made to remove stop machine and use the breakpoint
    logic instead, the modification of the function graph caller is still
    done directly as though it was being done under stop machine.
    
    As it is not converted via stop machine anymore, there is a possibility
    that the code could be layed across cache lines and if another CPU is
    accessing that function graph call when it is being updated, it could
    cause a General Protection Fault.
    
    Convert the update of the function graph caller to use the breakpoint
    method as well.

    x86, smap: smap_violation() is bogus if CONFIG_X86_SMAP is off
    
    commit 4640c7ee9b8953237d05a61ea3ea93981d1bc961 upstream.
    
    If CONFIG_X86_SMAP is disabled, smap_violation() tests for conditions
    which are incorrect (as the AC flag doesn't matter), causing spurious
    faults.
    
    The dynamic disabling of SMAP (nosmap on the command line) is fine
    because it disables X86_FEATURE_SMAP, therefore causing the
    static_cpu_has() to return false.
    
    Found by Fengguang Wu's test system.
    
    [ v3: move all predicates into smap_violation() ]
    [ v2: use IS_ENABLED() instead of #ifdef ]

    iio: ak8975: Fix calculation formula for convert micro tesla to gauss unit
    
    commit bef44abccb2677e8d16e50b75316d4fd1061be81 upstream.
    
    This effects the reported scale of the raw values, and thus userspace
    applications that use this value.
    
    One micro tesla equal 0.01 gauss. So I have fixed calculation formula And add RAW_TO_GAUSS macro.
    ASA is in the range of 0 to 255. If multiply 0.003, calculation result(in_magn_[*]_scale) is
    always 0. So multiply 3000 and return and IIO_VAL_INT_PLUS_MICRO.
    As a result, read_raw call back function return accurate scale value.

    commit 55b40d37311807a6bb2acdae0df904f54a0da3ae upstream.
    
    In kernel version 3.13, devm_regulator_get() may return no error
    if a regulator is undeclared. regulator_get_voltage() will return
    -EINVAL if this happens. This causes the driver to fail loading if

    commit 1e85c1ea1ff2a60659e790ef8ec76c7339445841 upstream.
    
    The last value written to a analog output channel is cached in the
    private data of this driver for readback.
    
    Currently, the wrong value is cached in the (*insn_write) functions.
    The current code stores the data[n] value for readback afer the loop
    has written all the values. At this time 'n' points past the end of
    the data array.
    
    Fix the functions by using a local variable to hold the data being
    written to the analog output channel. This variable is then used
    after the loop is complete to store the readback value. The current
    value is retrieved before the loop in case no values are actually
    written..

    tty: n_gsm: Fix for modems with brk in modem status control
    
    commit 3ac06b905655b3ef2fd2196bab36e4587e1e4e4f upstream.
    
    3GPP TS 07.10 states in section 5.4.6.3.7:
    "The length byte contains the value 2 or 3 ... depending on the break
    signal." The break byte is optional and if it is sent, the length is
    3. In fact the driver was not able to work with modems that send this
    break byte in their modem status control message. If the modem just
    sends the break byte if it is really set, then weird things might
    happen.
    The code for deconding the modem status to the internal linux
    presentation in gsm_process_modem has already a big comment about
    this 2 or 3 byte length thing and it is already able to decode the
    brk, but the code calling the gsm_process_modem function in
    gsm_control_modem does not encode it and hand it over the right way.
    This patch fixes this.
    Without this fix if the modem sends the brk byte in it's modem status
    control message the driver will hang when opening a muxed channel.

    lockd: send correct lock when granting a delayed lock.
    
    commit 2ec197db1a56c9269d75e965f14c344b58b2a4f6 upstream.
    
    If an NFS client attempts to get a lock (using NLM) and the lock is
    not available, the server will remember the request and when the lock
    becomes available it will send a GRANT request to the client to
    provide the lock.
    
    If the client already held an adjacent lock, the GRANT callback will
    report the union of the existing and new locks, which can confuse the
    client.
    
    This happens because __posix_lock_file (called by vfs_lock_file)
    updates the passed-in file_lock structure when adjacent or
    over-lapping locks are found.
    
    To avoid this problem we take a copy of the two fields that can
    be changed (fl_start and fl_end) before the call and restore them
    afterwards.
    An alternate would be to allocate a 'struct file_lock', initialise it,
    use locks_copy_lock() to take a copy, then locks_release_private()
    after the vfs_lock_file() call.  But that is a lot more work.

    raw: test against runtime value of max_raw_minors
    
    commit 5bbb2ae3d6f896f8d2082d1eceb6131c2420b7cf upstream.
    
    bind_get() checks the device number it is called with. It uses
    MAX_RAW_MINORS for the upper bound. But MAX_RAW_MINORS is set at compile
    time while the actual number of raw devices can be set at runtime. This
    means the test can either be too strict or too lenient. And if the test
    ends up being too lenient bind_get() might try to access memory beyond
    what was allocated for "raw_devices".
    
    So check against the runtime value (max_raw_minors) in this function.

    Root cause:
    the commit dropped uart_port->lock before calling tty_flip_buffer_push(), but in sirfsoc-uart,
    sirfsoc_uart_pio_rx_chars() can be called by sirfsoc_rx_tmo_process_tl(). here uart_port->lock
    has not been taken yet. so that caused unpaired lock/unlock.
    
    Solution:
    This patch is doing a quick fix for that, it adds spin_lock/unlock(&port->lock) protect to
    sirfsoc_uart_pio_rx_chars() in sirfsoc_rx_tmo_process_tl() to keep spin_lock/unlock in pair.

    of: fix PCI bus match for PCIe slots
    
    commit 14e2abb732e485ee57d9d5b2cb8884652238e5c1 upstream.
    
    On IBM pseries systems the device_type device-tree property of a PCIe
    bridge contains the string "pciex". The of_bus_pci_match() function was
    looking only for "pci" on this property, so in such cases the bus
    matching code was falling back to the default bus, causing problems on
    functions that should be using "assigned-addresses" for region address
    translation. This patch fixes the problem by also looking for "pciex" on
    the PCI bus match function.

    iwlwifi: mvm: don't allow A band if SKU forbids it
    
    commit c512865446e6dd5b6e91e81187e75b734ad7cfc7 upstream.
    
    The driver wasn't reading the NVM properly. While this
    didn't lead to any issue until now, it seems that there
    is an old version of the NVM in the wild.
    In this version, the A band channels appear to be valid
    but the SKU capabilities (another field of the NVM) says
    that A band isn't supported at all.
    With this specific version of the NVM, the driver would
    think that A band is supported while the HW / firmware
    don't. This leads to asserts.

    spi: Fix crash with double message finalisation on error handling
    
    commit 1f802f8249a0da536877842c43c7204064c4de8b upstream.
    
    This reverts commit e120cc0dcf2880a4c5c0a6cb27b655600a1cfa1d.
    
    It causes a NULL pointer dereference with drivers using the generic
    spi_transfer_one_message(), which always calls
    spi_finalize_current_message(), which zeroes master->cur_msg.
    
    Drivers implementing transfer_one_message() theirselves must always call
    spi_finalize_current_message(), even if the transfer failed:
    
     * @transfer_one_message: the subsystem calls the driver to transfer a single
     *      message while queuing transfers that arrive in the meantime. When the
     *      driver is finished with this message, it must call
     *      spi_finalize_current_message() so the subsystem can issue the next
     *      transfer

    commit 8d7f6690cedb83456edd41c9bd583783f0703bf0 upstream.
    
    The kernel currently crashes with a low-address-protection exception
    if a user space process executes an instruction that tries to use the
    linkage stack. Set the base-ASTE origin and the subspace-ASTE origin
    of the dispatchable-unit-control-table to point to a dummy ASTE.
    Set up control register 15 to point to an empty linkage stack with no
    room left.
    
    A user space process with a linkage stack instruction will still crash
    but with a different exception which is correctly translated to a
    segmentation fault instead of a kernel oops.

    s390/dump: Fix dump memory detection
    
    commit d7736ff5be31edaa4fe5ab62810c64529a24b149 upstream.
    
    Dumps created by kdump or zfcpdump can contain invalid memory holes when
    dumping z/VM systems that have memory pressure.
    
    For example:
    
       # zgetdump -i /proc/vmcore.
       Memory map:
       0000000000000000 - 0000000000bfffff (12 MB)
       0000000000e00000 - 00000000014fffff (7 MB)
       000000000bd00000 - 00000000f3bfffff (3711 MB)
    
    The memory detection function find_memory_chunks() issues tprot to
    find valid memory chunks. In case of CMM it can happen that pages are
    marked as unstable via set_page_unstable() in arch_free_page().
    If z/VM has released that pages, tprot returns -EFAULT and indicates
    a memory hole.
    
    So fix this and switch off CMM in case of kdump or zfcpdump.

    ath9k_htc: make ->sta_rc_update atomic for most calls
    
    commit 2fa4cb905605c863bf570027233af7afd8149ae4 upstream.
    
    sta_rc_update() callback must be atomic, hence we can not take mutexes
    or do other operations, which can sleep in ath9k_htc_sta_rc_update().
    
    I think we can just return from ath9k_htc_sta_rc_update(), if it is
    called without IEEE80211_RC_SUPP_RATES_CHANGED bit. That will help
    with scheduling while atomic bug for most cases (except mesh and IBSS
    modes).
    
    For mesh and IBSS I do not see other solution like creating additional
    workqueue, because sending firmware command require us to sleep, but
    this can be done in additional patch.

    mac80211: fix fragmentation code, particularly for encryption
    
    commit 338f977f4eb441e69bb9a46eaa0ac715c931a67f upstream.
    
    The "new" fragmentation code (since my rewrite almost 5 years ago)
    erroneously sets skb->len rather than using skb_trim() to adjust
    the length of the first fragment after copying out all the others.
    This leaves the skb tail pointer pointing to after where the data
    originally ended, and thus causes the encryption MIC to be written
    at that point, rather than where it belongs: immediately after the
    data.
    
    The impact of this is that if software encryption is done, then
     a) encryption doesn't work for the first fragment, the connection
        becomes unusable as the first fragment will never be properly
        verified at the receiver, the MIC is practically guaranteed to
        be wrong
     b) we leak up to 8 bytes of plaintext (!) of the packet out into
        the air
    
    This is only mitigated by the fact that many devices are capable
    of doing encryption in hardware, in which case this can't happen
    as the tail pointer is irrelevant in that case. Additionally,
    fragmentation is not used very frequently and would normally have
    to be configured manually.
    
    Fix this by using skb_trim() properly.

    commit 83e3bc23ef9ce7c03b7b4e5d3d790246ea59db3e upstream.
    
    The get/set ACL xattr support for CIFS ACLs attempts to send old
    cifs dialect protocol requests even when mounted with SMB2 or later
    dialects. Sending cifs requests on an smb2 session causes problems -
    the server drops the session due to the illegal request.
    
    This patch makes CIFS ACL operations protocol specific to fix that.
    
    Attempting to query/set CIFS ACLs for SMB2 will now return
    EOPNOTSUPP (until we add worker routines for sending query
    ACL requests via SMB2) instead of sending invalid (cifs)
    requests.
    
    A separate followon patch will be needed to fix cifs_acl_to_fattr
    (which takes a cifs specific u16 fid so can't be abstracted
    to work with SMB2 until that is changed) and will be needed
    to fix mount problems when "cifsacl" is specified on mount
    with e.g. vers=2.1

    Add protocol specific operation for CIFS xattrs
    
    commit d979f3b0a1f0b5499ab85e68cdf02b56852918b6 upstream.
    
    Changeset 666753c3ef8fc88b0ddd5be4865d0aa66428ac35 added protocol
    operations for get/setxattr to avoid calling cifs operations
    on smb2/smb3 mounts for xattr operations and this changeset
    adds the calls to cifs specific protocol operations for xattrs
    (in order to reenable cifs support for xattrs which was
    temporarily disabled by the previous changeset.  We do not
    have SMB2/SMB3 worker function for setting xattrs yet so
    this only enables it for cifs.
    
    CCing stable since without these two small changsets (its
    small coreq 666753c3ef8fc88b0ddd5be4865d0aa66428ac35 is
    also needed) calling getfattr/setfattr on smb2/smb3 mounts
    causes problems.

    CIFS: Fix SMB2 mounts so they don't try to set or get xattrs via cifs
    
    commit 666753c3ef8fc88b0ddd5be4865d0aa66428ac35 upstream.
    
    When mounting with smb2 (or smb2.1 or smb3) we need to check to make
    sure that attempts to query or set extended attributes do not
    attempt to send the request with the older cifs protocol instead
    (eventually we also need to add the support in SMB2
    to query/set extended attributes but this patch prevents us from
    using the wrong protocol for extended attribute operations).

    mm/memory-failure.c: move refcount only in !MF_COUNT_INCREASED
    
    commit 8d547ff4ac5927245e0833ac18528f939da0ee0e upstream.
    
    mce-test detected a test failure when injecting error to a thp tail
    page.  This is because we take page refcount of the tail page in
    madvise_hwpoison() while the fix in commit a3e0f9e47d5e
    ("mm/memory-failure.c: transfer page count from head page to tail page
    after split thp") assumes that we always take refcount on the head page.
    
    When a real memory error happens we take refcount on the head page where
    memory_failure() is called without MF_COUNT_INCREASED set, so it seems
    to me that testing memory error on thp tail page using madvise makes
    little sense.
    
    This patch cancels moving refcount in !MF_COUNT_INCREASED for valid
    testing.

    mm: fix page leak at nfs_symlink()
    
    commit a0b54adda3fe4b4cc6d28f2a9217cd35d1aa888c upstream.
    
    Changes in commit a0b8cab3b9b2 ("mm: remove lru parameter from
    __pagevec_lru_add and remove parts of pagevec API") have introduced a
    call to add_to_page_cache_lru() which causes a leak in nfs_symlink() as
    now the page gets an extra refcount that is not dropped.
    
    Jan Stancek observed and reported the leak effect while running test8
    from Connectathon Testsuite.  After several iterations over the test
    case, which creates several symlinks on a NFS mountpoint, the test
    system was quickly getting into an out-of-memory scenario.
    
    This patch fixes the page leak by dropping that extra refcount
    add_to_page_cache_lru() is grabbing.

    fs/file.c:fdtable: avoid triggering OOMs from alloc_fdmem
    
    commit 96c7a2ff21501691587e1ae969b83cbec8b78e08 upstream.
    
    Recently due to a spike in connections per second memcached on 3
    separate boxes triggered the OOM killer from accept.  At the time the
    OOM killer was triggered there was 4GB out of 36GB free in zone 1.  The
    problem was that alloc_fdtable was allocating an order 3 page (32KiB) to
    hold a bitmap, and there was sufficient fragmentation that the largest
    page available was 8KiB.
    
    I find the logic that PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER can't fail pretty dubious
    but I do agree that order 3 allocations are very likely to succeed.
    
    There are always pathologies where order > 0 allocations can fail when
    there are copious amounts of free memory available.  Using the pigeon
    hole principle it is easy to show that it requires 1 page more than 50%
    of the pages being free to guarantee an order 1 (8KiB) allocation will
    succeed, 1 page more than 75% of the pages being free to guarantee an
    order 2 (16KiB) allocation will succeed and 1 page more than 87.5% of
    the pages being free to guarantee an order 3 allocate will succeed.
    
    A server churning memory with a lot of small requests and replies like
    memcached is a common case that if anything can will skew the odds
    against large pages being available.
    
    Therefore let's not give external applications a practical way to kill
    linux server applications, and specify __GFP_NORETRY to the kmalloc in
    alloc_fdmem.  Unless I am misreading the code and by the time the code
    reaches should_alloc_retry in __alloc_pages_slowpath (where
    __GFP_NORETRY becomes signification).  We have already tried everything
    reasonable to allocate a page and the only thing left to do is wait.  So
    not waiting and falling back to vmalloc immediately seems like the
    reasonable thing to do even if there wasn't a chance of triggering the
    OOM killer.

    xen-blkfront: handle backend CLOSED without CLOSING
    
    commit 3661371701e714f0cea4120f6a365340858fb4e4 upstream.
    
    Backend drivers shouldn't transistion to CLOSED unless the frontend is
    CLOSED.  If a backend does transition to CLOSED too soon then the
    frontend may not see the CLOSING state and will not properly shutdown.
    
    So, treat an unexpected backend CLOSED state the same as CLOSING.

    xen: properly account for _PAGE_NUMA during xen pte translations
    
    commit a9c8e4beeeb64c22b84c803747487857fe424b68 upstream.
    
    Steven Noonan forwarded a users report where they had a problem starting
    vsftpd on a Xen paravirtualized guest, with this in dmesg:
    
      BUG: Bad page map in process vsftpd  pte:8000000493b88165 pmd:e9cc01067

      BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff880e9ca60580 idx:1 val:1
    
    The issue could not be reproduced under an HVM instance with the same
    kernel, so it appears to be exclusive to paravirtual Xen guests.  He
    bisected the problem to commit 1667918b6483 ("mm: numa: clear numa
    hinting information on mprotect") that was also included in 3.12-stable.
    
    The problem was related to how xen translates ptes because it was not
    accounting for the _PAGE_NUMA bit.  This patch splits pte_present to add
    a pteval_present helper for use by xen so both bare metal and xen use
    the same code when checking if a PTE is present.
