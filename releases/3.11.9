    commit 9d3fde86b15303decea632c929fbf1f3ae4501f2 upstream.
    
    Move probe out of __init section and don't use platform_driver_probe
    which cannot be used with deferred probing.
    
    Since commit e9354576 ("gpiolib: Defer failed gpio requests by default")
    this driver might return -EPROBE_DEFER if a gpio_request fails.

    drm/i915/dp: workaround BIOS eDP bpp clamping issue
    
    commit c6cd2ee2d59111a07cd9199564c9bdcb2d11e5cf upstream.
    
    This isn't a real fix to the problem, but rather a stopgap measure while
    trying to find a proper solution.
    
    There are several laptops out there that fail to light up the eDP panel
    in UEFI boot mode. They seem to be mostly IVB machines, including but
    apparently not limited to Dell XPS 13, Asus TX300, Asus UX31A, Asus
    UX32VD, Acer Aspire S7. They seem to work in CSM or legacy boot.
    
    The difference between UEFI and CSM is that the BIOS provides a
    different VBT to the kernel. The UEFI VBT typically specifies 18 bpp and
    1.62 GHz link for eDP, while CSM VBT has 24 bpp and 2.7 GHz link. We end
    up clamping to 18 bpp in UEFI mode, which we can fit in the 1.62 Ghz
    link, and for reasons yet unknown fail to light up the panel.
    
    Dithering from 24 to 18 bpp itself seems to work; if we use 18 bpp with
    2.7 GHz link, the eDP panel lights up. So essentially this is a link
    speed issue, and *not* a bpp clamping issue.
    
    The bug raised its head since
    commit 657445fe8660100ad174600ebfa61536392b7624
    Author: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>
    Date:   Sat May 4 10:09:18 2013 +0200
    
        Revert "drm/i915: revert eDP bpp clamping code changes"
    
    which started clamping bpp *before* computing the link requirements, and
    thus affecting the required bandwidth. Clamping after the computations
    kept the link at 2.7 GHz.
    
    Even though the BIOS tells us to use 18 bpp through the VBT, it happily
    boots up at 24 bpp and 2.7 GHz itself! Use this information to
    selectively ignore the VBT provided value.
    
    We can't ignore the VBT eDP bpp altogether, as there are other laptops
    that do require the clamping to be used due to EDID reporting higher bpp
    than the panel can support.

    Although the crash happened in ftrace_regex_open() the real bug
    occurred in trace_get_user() where there's an incrementation to
    parser->idx without a check against the size. The way it is triggered
    is if userspace sends in 128 characters (EVENT_BUF_SIZE + 1), the loop
    that reads the last character stores it and then breaks out because
    there is no more characters. Then the last character is read to determine
    what to do next, and the index is incremented without checking size.
    
    Then the caller of trace_get_user() usually nulls out the last character
    with a zero, but since the index is equal to the size, it writes a nul
    character after the allocated space, which can corrupt memory.
    
    Luckily, only root user has write access to this file.

    ALSA: hda - hdmi: Fix reported channel map on common default layouts
    
    commit 56cac413dd6d43af8355f5d1f90a199b540f73fc upstream.
    
    hdmi_setup_fake_chmap() is supposed to set the reported channel map when
    the channel map is not specified by the user.
    
    However, the function indexes channel_allocations[] with a wrong value
    and extracts the wrong nibble from hdmi_channel_mapping[], causing wrong
    channel maps to be shown.
    
    Fix those issues.
    
    Tested on Intel HDMI to correctly generate various channel maps, for
    example 3,4,14,15,7,8,5,6 (instead of incorrect 3,4,8,7,5,6,14,0) for
    standard 7.1 channel audio. (Note that the side and rear channels are
    reported as RL/RR and RLC/RRC, respectively, as per the CEA-861
    standard, instead of the more traditional SL/SR and RL/RR.)
    
    Note that this only fixes the layouts that only contain traditional 7.1
    speakers (2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.1, 7.1, etc.). E.g. the rear center of 6.1
    is still being shown wrongly due to an issue with from_cea_slot()
    which will be fixed in a later patch.

    hyperv-fb: add pci stub
    
    commit 7ad9684721606efbfb9b347346816e1e6baff8bb upstream.
    
    This patch adds a pci stub driver to hyper-fb.  The hyperv framebuffer
    driver will bind to the pci device then, so linux kernel and userspace
    know there is a proper kernel driver for the device active.  lspci shows
    this for example:
    
    [root@dhcp231 ~]# lspci -vs8
    00:08.0 VGA compatible controller: Microsoft Corporation Hyper-V virtual
    VGA (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
            Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 11
            Memory at f8000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64M]
            Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled]
            Kernel driver in use: hyperv_fb
    
    Another effect is that the xorg vesa driver will not attach to the
    device and thus the Xorg server will automatically use the fbdev
    driver instead.

    Thermal: x86_pkg_temp: change spin lock
    
    commit 7bed1b3caaedd5918f0820b29f3b7a2ddc812922 upstream.
    
    x86_pkg_temp receives thermal notifications via a callback from a
    therm_throt driver, where thermal interrupts are processed.
    This callback is pkg_temp_thermal_platform_thermal_notify. Here to
    avoid multiple interrupts from cores in a package, we disable the
    source and also set a variable to avoid scheduling delayed work function.
    This variable is protected via spin_lock_irqsave. On one buggy platform,
    we still receiving interrupts even if the source is disabled. This
    can cause deadlock/lockdep warning, when interrupt is generated while under
    spinlock in work function.
    Change spin_lock to spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock to
    spin_unlock_irqrestore as the data it is trying to protect can also
    be modified in a notification call called from interrupt handler.

    xen-netback: transition to CLOSED when removing a VIF
    
    [ Upstream commit dc62ccaccfb139d9b04bbc5a2688a4402adbfab3 ]
    
    If a guest is destroyed without transitioning its frontend to CLOSED,
    the domain becomes a zombie as netback was not grant unmapping the
    shared rings.
    
    When removing a VIF, transition the backend to CLOSED so the VIF is
    disconnected if necessary (which will unmap the shared rings etc).
    
    This fixes a regression introduced by
    279f438e36c0a70b23b86d2090aeec50155034a9 (xen-netback: Don't destroy
    the netdev until the vif is shut down).

    xen-netback: Handle backend state transitions in a more robust way
    
    [ Upstream commit ea732dff5cfa10789007bf4a5b935388a0bb2a8f ]
    
    When the frontend state changes netback now specifies its desired state to
    a new function, set_backend_state(), which transitions through any
    necessary intermediate states.
    This fixes an issue observed with some old Windows frontend drivers where
    they failed to transition through the Closing state and netback would not
    behave correctly.

    ipv6: reset dst.expires value when clearing expire flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 01ba16d6ec85a1ec4669c75513a76b61ec53ee50 ]
    
    On receiving a packet too big icmp error we update the expire value by
    calling rt6_update_expires. This function uses dst_set_expires which is
    implemented that it can only reduce the expiration value of the dst entry.
    
    If we insert new routing non-expiry information into the ipv6 fib where
    we already have a matching rt6_info we only clear the RTF_EXPIRES flag
    in rt6i_flags and leave the dst.expires value as is.
    
    When new mtu information arrives for that cached dst_entry we again
    call dst_set_expires. This time it won't update the dst.expire value
    because we left the dst.expire value intact from the last update. So
    dst_set_expires won't touch dst.expires.
    
    Fix this by resetting dst.expires when clearing the RTF_EXPIRE flag.
    dst_set_expires checks for a zero expiration and updates the
    dst.expires.
    
    In the past this (not updating dst.expires) was necessary because
    dst.expire was placed in a union with the dst_entry *from reference
    and rt6_clean_expires did assign NULL to it. This split happend in
    ecd9883724b78cc72ed92c98bcb1a46c764fff21 ("ipv6: fix race condition
    regarding dst->expires and dst->from").

    ipv6: ip6_dst_check needs to check for expired dst_entries
    
    [ Upstream commit e3bc10bd95d7fcc3f2ac690c6ff22833ea6781d6 ]
    
    On receiving a packet too big icmp error we check if our current cached
    dst_entry in the socket is still valid. This validation check did not
    care about the expiration of the (cached) route.
    
    The error path I traced down:
    The socket receives a packet too big mtu notification. It still has a
    valid dst_entry and thus issues the ip6_rt_pmtu_update on this dst_entry,
    setting RTF_EXPIRE and updates the dst.expiration value (which could
    fail because of not up-to-date expiration values, see previous patch).
    
    In some seldom cases we race with a) the ip6_fib gc or b) another routing
    lookup which would result in a recreation of the cached rt6_info from its
    parent non-cached rt6_info. While copying the rt6_info we reinitialize the
    metrics store by copying it over from the parent thus invalidating the
    just installed pmtu update (both dsts use the same key to the inetpeer
    storage). The dst_entry with the just invalidated metrics data would
    just get its RTF_EXPIRES flag cleared and would continue to stay valid
    for the socket.
    
    We should have not issued the pmtu update on the already expired dst_entry
    in the first placed. By checking the expiration on the dst entry and
    doing a relookup in case it is out of date we close the race because
    we would install a new rt6_info into the fib before we issue the pmtu
    update, thus closing this race.
    
    Not reliably updating the dst.expire value was fixed by the patch "ipv6:
    reset dst.expires value when clearing expire flag".

    tcp: gso: fix truesize tracking
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d08c42cf9a71530fef5ebcfe368f38f2dd0476f ]
    
    commit 6ff50cd55545 ("tcp: gso: do not generate out of order packets")
    had an heuristic that can trigger a warning in skb_try_coalesce(),
    because skb->truesize of the gso segments were exactly set to mss.
    
    This breaks the requirement that
    
    skb->truesize >= skb->len + truesizeof(struct sk_buff);
    
    It can trivially be reproduced by :
    
    ifconfig lo mtu 1500
    ethtool -K lo tso off
    netperf
    
    As the skbs are looped into the TCP networking stack, skb_try_coalesce()
    warns us of these skb under-estimating their truesize.

    xen-netback: use jiffies_64 value to calculate credit timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit 059dfa6a93b779516321e5112db9d7621b1367ba ]
    
    time_after_eq() only works if the delta is < MAX_ULONG/2.
    
    For a 32bit Dom0, if netfront sends packets at a very low rate, the time
    between subsequent calls to tx_credit_exceeded() may exceed MAX_ULONG/2
    and the test for timer_after_eq() will be incorrect. Credit will not be
    replenished and the guest may become unable to send packets (e.g., if
    prior to the long gap, all credit was exhausted).
    
    Use jiffies_64 variant to mitigate this problem for 32bit Dom0.

    net: sctp: do not trigger BUG_ON in sctp_cmd_delete_tcb
    
    [ Upstream commit 7926c1d5be0b7cbe5b8d5c788d7d39237e7b212c ]
    
    Introduced in f9e42b853523 ("net: sctp: sideeffect: throw BUG if
    primary_path is NULL"), we intended to find a buggy assoc that's
    part of the assoc hash table with a primary_path that is NULL.
    However, we better remove the BUG_ON for now and find a more
    suitable place to assert for these things as Mark reports that
    this also triggers the bug when duplication cookie processing
    happens, and the assoc is not part of the hash table (so all
    good in this case). Such a situation can for example easily be
    reproduced by:
    
      tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: prio bands 2 priomap 1 1 1 1 1 1
      tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent 1:2 handle 20: netem loss 20%
      tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent 1: prio 2 u32 match ip \
                protocol 132 0xff match u8 0x0b 0xff at 32 flowid 1:2
    
    This drops 20% of COOKIE-ACK packets. After some follow-up
    discussion with Vlad we came to the conclusion that for now we
    should still better remove this BUG_ON() assertion, and come up
    with two follow-ups later on, that is, i) find a more suitable
    place for this assertion, and possibly ii) have a special
    allocator/initializer for such kind of temporary assocs.
