    net: stmmac: don't stop NAPI processing when dropping a packet
    
    commit 07b3975352374c3f5ebb4a42ef0b253fe370542d upstream.
    
    Currently, if we drop a packet, we exit from NAPI loop before the budget
    is consumed. In some situations this will make the RX processing stall
    e.g. when flood pinging the system with oversized packets, as the
    errorneous packets are not dropped efficiently.
    
    If we drop a packet, we should just continue to the next one as long as
    the budget allows.

    net: stmmac: use correct DMA buffer size in the RX descriptor
    
    commit 583e6361414903c5206258a30e5bd88cb03c0254 upstream.
    
    We always program the maximum DMA buffer size into the receive descriptor,
    although the allocated size may be less. E.g. with the default MTU size
    we allocate only 1536 bytes. If somebody sends us a bigger frame, then
    memory may get corrupted.
    
    Fix by using exact buffer sizes.

    xhci: fix USB3 device initiated resume race with roothub autosuspend
    
    commit 057d476fff778f1d3b9f861fdb5437ea1a3cfc99 upstream.
    
    A race in xhci USB3 remote wake handling may force device back to suspend
    after it initiated resume siganaling, causing a missed resume event or warm
    reset of device.
    
    When a USB3 link completes resume signaling and goes to enabled (UO)
    state a interrupt is issued and the interrupt handler will clear the
    bus_state->port_remote_wakeup resume flag, allowing bus suspend.
    
    If the USB3 roothub thread just finished reading port status before
    the interrupt, finding ports still in suspended (U3) state, but hasn't
    yet started suspending the hub, then the xhci interrupt handler will clear
    the flag that prevented roothub suspend and allow bus to suspend, forcing
    all port links back to suspended (U3) state.
    
    Example case:
    usb_runtime_suspend() # because all ports still show suspended U3
      usb_suspend_both()
        hub_suspend();   # successful as hub->wakeup_bits not set yet
    ==> INTERRUPT
    xhci_irq()
      handle_port_status()
        clear bus_state->port_remote_wakeup
        usb_wakeup_notification()
          sets hub->wakeup_bits;
            kick_hub_wq()
    <== END INTERRUPT
          hcd_bus_suspend()
            xhci_bus_suspend() # success as port_remote_wakeup bits cleared
    
    Fix this by increasing roothub usage count during port resume to prevent
    roothub autosuspend, and by making sure bus_state->port_remote_wakeup
    flag is only cleared after resume completion is visible, i.e.
    after xhci roothub returned U0 or other non-U3 link state link on a
    get port status request.

    dm btree: increase rebalance threshold in __rebalance2()
    
    commit 474e559567fa631dea8fb8407ab1b6090c903755 upstream.
    
    We got the following warnings from thin_check during thin-pool setup:
    
      $ thin_check /dev/vdb
      examining superblock
      examining devices tree
        missing devices: [1, 84]
          too few entries in btree_node: 41, expected at least 42 (block 138, max_entries = 126)
      examining mapping tree
    
    The phenomenon is the number of entries in one node of details_info tree is
    less than (max_entries / 3). And it can be easily reproduced by the following
    procedures:
    
      $ new a thin pool
      $ presume the max entries of details_info tree is 126
      $ new 127 thin devices (e.g. 1~127) to make the root node being full
        and then split
      $ remove the first 43 (e.g. 1~43) thin devices to make the children
        reblance repeatedly
      $ stop the thin pool
      $ thin_check
    
    The root cause is that the B-tree removal procedure in __rebalance2()
    doesn't guarantee the invariance: the minimal number of entries in
    non-root node should be >= (max_entries / 3).
    
    Simply fix the problem by increasing the rebalance threshold to
    make sure the number of entries in each child will be greater
    than or equal to (max_entries / 3 + 1), so no matter which
    child is used for removal, the number will still be valid.

    vfio/pci: call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() before freeing irq
    
    commit d567fb8819162099035e546b11a736e29c2af0ea upstream.
    
    Since irq_bypass_register_producer() is called after request_irq(), we
    should do tear-down in reverse order: irq_bypass_unregister_producer()
    then free_irq().
    
    Specifically free_irq() may release resources required by the
    irqbypass del_producer() callback.  Notably an example provided by
    Marc Zyngier on arm64 with GICv4 that he indicates has the potential
    to wedge the hardware:
    
     free_irq(irq)
       __free_irq(irq)
         irq_domain_deactivate_irq(irq)
           its_irq_domain_deactivate()

    CIFS: Respect O_SYNC and O_DIRECT flags during reconnect
    
    commit 44805b0e62f15e90d233485420e1847133716bdc upstream.
    
    Currently the client translates O_SYNC and O_DIRECT flags
    into corresponding SMB create options when openning a file.
    The problem is that on reconnect when the file is being
    re-opened the client doesn't set those flags and it causes
    a server to reject re-open requests because create options
    don't match. The latter means that any subsequent system
    call against that open file fail until a share is re-mounted.
    
    Fix this by properly setting SMB create options when
    re-openning files after reconnects.

    read values are consistent.

    PCI/MSI: Fix incorrect MSI-X masking on resume
    
    commit e045fa29e89383c717e308609edd19d2fd29e1be upstream.
    
    When a driver enables MSI-X, msix_program_entries() reads the MSI-X Vector
    Control register for each vector and saves it in desc->masked.  Each
    register is 32 bits and bit 0 is the actual Mask bit.
    
    When we restored these registers during resume, we previously set the Mask
    bit if *any* bit in desc->masked was set instead of when the Mask bit
    itself was set:
    
      pci_restore_state
        pci_restore_msi_state
          __pci_restore_msix_state
            for_each_pci_msi_entry
              msix_mask_irq(entry, entry->masked)   <-- entire u32 word
                __pci_msix_desc_mask_irq(desc, flag)
                  mask_bits = desc->masked & ~PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_CTRL_MASKBIT
                  if (flag)       <-- testing entire u32, not just bit 0
                    mask_bits |= PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_CTRL_MASKBIT
                  writel(mask_bits, desc_addr + PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_VECTOR_CTRL)
    
    This means that after resume, MSI-X vectors were masked when they shouldn't
    be, which leads to timeouts like this:
    
      nvme nvme0: I/O 978 QID 3 timeout, completion polled
    
    On resume, set the Mask bit only when the saved Mask bit from suspend was
    set.
    
    This should remove the need for 19ea025e1d28 ("nvme: Add quirk for Kingston
    NVME SSD running FW E8FK11.T").

    PCI: Fix Intel ACS quirk UPDCR register address
    
    commit d8558ac8c93d429d65d7490b512a3a67e559d0d4 upstream.
    
    According to documentation [0] the correct offset for the Upstream Peer
    Decode Configuration Register (UPDCR) is 0x1014.  It was previously defined
    as 0x1114.
    
    d99321b63b1f ("PCI: Enable quirks for PCIe ACS on Intel PCH root ports")
    intended to enforce isolation between PCI devices allowing them to be put
    into separate IOMMU groups.  Due to the wrong register offset the intended
    isolation was not fully enforced.  This is fixed with this patch.
    
    Please note that I did not test this patch because I have no hardware that
    implements this register.

    tcp: tighten acceptance of ACKs not matching a child socket
    
    [ Upstream commit cb44a08f8647fd2e8db5cc9ac27cd8355fa392d8 ]
    
    When no synflood occurs, the synflood timestamp isn't updated.
    Therefore it can be so old that time_after32() can consider it to be
    in the future.
    
    That's a problem for tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow() as it may report
    that a recent overflow occurred while, in fact, it's just that jiffies
    has grown past 'last_overflow' + TCP_SYNCOOKIE_VALID + 2^31.
    
    Spurious detection of recent overflows lead to extra syncookie
    verification in cookie_v[46]_check(). At that point, the verification
    should fail and the packet dropped. But we should have dropped the
    packet earlier as we didn't even send a syncookie.
    
    Let's refine tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow() to report a recent overflow
    only if jiffies is within the
    [last_overflow, last_overflow + TCP_SYNCOOKIE_VALID] interval. This
    way, no spurious recent overflow is reported when jiffies wraps and
    'last_overflow' becomes in the future from the point of view of
    time_after32().
    
    However, if jiffies wraps and enters the
    [last_overflow, last_overflow + TCP_SYNCOOKIE_VALID] interval (with
    'last_overflow' being a stale synflood timestamp), then
    tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow() still erroneously reports an
    overflow. In such cases, we have to rely on syncookie verification
    to drop the packet. We unfortunately have no way to differentiate
    between a fresh and a stale syncookie timestamp.
    
    In practice, using last_overflow as lower bound is problematic.
    If the synflood timestamp is concurrently updated between the time
    we read jiffies and the moment we store the timestamp in
    'last_overflow', then 'now' becomes smaller than 'last_overflow' and
    tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow() returns true, potentially dropping a
    valid syncookie.
    
    Reading jiffies after loading the timestamp could fix the problem,
    but that'd require a memory barrier. Let's just accommodate for
    potential timestamp growth instead and extend the interval using
    'last_overflow - HZ' as lower bound.

    tcp: fix rejected syncookies due to stale timestamps
    
    [ Upstream commit 04d26e7b159a396372646a480f4caa166d1b6720 ]
    
    If no synflood happens for a long enough period of time, then the
    synflood timestamp isn't refreshed and jiffies can advance so much
    that time_after32() can't accurately compare them any more.
    
    Therefore, we can end up in a situation where time_after32(now,
    last_overflow + HZ) returns false, just because these two values are
    too far apart. In that case, the synflood timestamp isn't updated as
    it should be, which can trick tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow() into
    rejecting valid syncookies.
    
    For example, let's consider the following scenario on a system
    with HZ=1000:
    
      * The synflood timestamp is 0, either because that's the timestamp
        of the last synflood or, more commonly, because we're working with
        a freshly created socket.
    
      * We receive a new SYN, which triggers synflood protection. Let's say
        that this happens when jiffies == 2147484649 (that is,
        'synflood timestamp' + HZ + 2^31 + 1).
    
      * Then tcp_synq_overflow() doesn't update the synflood timestamp,
        because time_after32(2147484649, 1000) returns false.
        With:
          - 2147484649: the value of jiffies, aka. 'now'.
          - 1000: the value of 'last_overflow' + HZ.
    
      * A bit later, we receive the ACK completing the 3WHS. But
        cookie_v[46]_check() rejects it because tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow()
        says that we're not under synflood. That's because
        time_after32(2147484649, 120000) returns false.
        With:
          - 2147484649: the value of jiffies, aka. 'now'.
          - 120000: the value of 'last_overflow' + TCP_SYNCOOKIE_VALID.
    
        Of course, in reality jiffies would have increased a bit, but this
        condition will last for the next 119 seconds, which is far enough
        to accommodate for jiffie's growth.
    
    Fix this by updating the overflow timestamp whenever jiffies isn't
    within the [last_overflow, last_overflow + HZ] range. That shouldn't
    have any performance impact since the update still happens at most once
    per second.
    
    Now we're guaranteed to have fresh timestamps while under synflood, so
    tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow() can safely use it with time_after32() in
    such situations.
    
    Stale timestamps can still make tcp_synq_no_recent_overflow() return
    the wrong verdict when not under synflood. This will be handled in the
    next patch.
    
    For 64 bits architectures, the problem was introduced with the
    conversion of ->tw_ts_recent_stamp to 32 bits integer by commit
    cca9bab1b72c ("tcp: use monotonic timestamps for PAWS").
    The problem has always been there on 32 bits architectures.

    inet: protect against too small mtu values.
    
    [ Upstream commit 501a90c945103e8627406763dac418f20f3837b2 ]
    
    syzbot was once again able to crash a host by setting a very small mtu
    on loopback device.
    
    Let's make inetdev_valid_mtu() available in include/net/ip.h,
    and use it in ip_setup_cork(), so that we protect both ip_append_page()
    and __ip_append_data()
    
    Also add a READ_ONCE() when the device mtu is read.
    
    Pairs this lockless read with one WRITE_ONCE() in __dev_set_mtu(),
    even if other code paths might write over this field.
    
    Add a big comment in include/linux/netdevice.h about dev->mtu
    needing READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() annotations.
    
    Hopefully we will add the missing ones in followup patches.

    tipc: fix ordering of tipc module init and exit routine
    
    [ Upstream commit 9cf1cd8ee3ee09ef2859017df2058e2f53c5347f ]
    
    In order to set/get/dump, the tipc uses the generic netlink
    infrastructure. So, when tipc module is inserted, init function
    calls genl_register_family().
    After genl_register_family(), set/get/dump commands are immediately
    allowed and these callbacks internally use the net_generic.
    net_generic is allocated by register_pernet_device() but this
    is called after genl_register_family() in the __init function.
    So, these callbacks would use un-initialized net_generic.
    
    Test commands:
        #SHELL1
        while :
        do
            modprobe tipc
            modprobe -rv tipc
        done
    
        #SHELL2
        while :
        do
            tipc link list
        done

    tcp: md5: fix potential overestimation of TCP option space
    
    [ Upstream commit 9424e2e7ad93ffffa88f882c9bc5023570904b55 ]
    
    Back in 2008, Adam Langley fixed the corner case of packets for flows
    having all of the following options : MD5 TS SACK
    
    Since MD5 needs 20 bytes, and TS needs 12 bytes, no sack block
    can be cooked from the remaining 8 bytes.
    
    tcp_established_options() correctly sets opts->num_sack_blocks
    to zero, but returns 36 instead of 32.
    
    This means TCP cooks packets with 4 extra bytes at the end
    of options, containing unitialized bytes.

    net: bridge: deny dev_set_mac_address() when unregistering
    
    [ Upstream commit c4b4c421857dc7b1cf0dccbd738472360ff2cd70 ]
    
    We have an interesting memory leak in the bridge when it is being
    unregistered and is a slave to a master device which would change the
    mac of its slaves on unregister (e.g. bond, team). This is a very
    unusual setup but we do end up leaking 1 fdb entry because
    dev_set_mac_address() would cause the bridge to insert the new mac address
    into its table after all fdbs are flushed, i.e. after dellink() on the
    bridge has finished and we call NETDEV_UNREGISTER the bond/team would
    release it and will call dev_set_mac_address() to restore its original
    address and that in turn will add an fdb in the bridge.
    One fix is to check for the bridge dev's reg_state in its
    ndo_set_mac_address callback and return an error if the bridge is not in
    NETREG_REGISTERED.
    
    Easy steps to reproduce:
     1. add bond in mode != A/B
     2. add any slave to the bond
     3. add bridge dev as a slave to the bond
     4. destroy the bridge device

    kernel/module.c: wakeup processes in module_wq on module unload
    
    [ Upstream commit 5d603311615f612320bb77bd2a82553ef1ced5b7 ]
    
    Fix the race between load and unload a kernel module.
    
    sys_delete_module()

                                            add_unformed_module()
                                             old = find_module_all()
                                             (old->state == _GOING =>
                                              wait_event_interruptible())
    
                                             During pre-condition
                                             finished_loading() rets 0
                                             schedule()

      mod->state = _UNFORMED
       list_del_rcu(&mod->list)
       (dels mod from "modules" list)
    
    return
    
    The race above leads to modprobe hanging forever on loading
    a module.
    
    Error paths on loading module call wake_up_all(&module_wq) after
    freeing module, so let's do the same on straight module unload.

    sunrpc: fix crash when cache_head become valid before update
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fcaf6982d1167f1cd9b264704f6d1ef4c505d54 ]
    
    I was investigating a crash in our Virtuozzo7 kernel which happened in
    in svcauth_unix_set_client. I found out that we access m_client field
    in ip_map structure, which was received from sunrpc_cache_lookup (we
    have a bit older kernel, now the code is in sunrpc_cache_add_entry), and
    these field looks uninitialized (m_client == 0x74 don't look like a
    pointer) but in the cache_head in flags we see 0x1 which is CACHE_VALID.
    
    It looks like the problem appeared from our previous fix to sunrpc (1):
    commit 4ecd55ea0742 ("sunrpc: fix cache_head leak due to queued
    request")
    
    And we've also found a patch already fixing our patch (2):
    commit d58431eacb22 ("sunrpc: don't mark uninitialised items as VALID.")
    
    Though the crash is eliminated, I think the core of the problem is not
    completely fixed:
    
    Neil in the patch (2) makes cache_head CACHE_NEGATIVE, before
    cache_fresh_locked which was added in (1) to fix crash. These way
    cache_is_valid won't say the cache is valid anymore and in
    svcauth_unix_set_client the function cache_check will return error
    instead of 0, and we don't count entry as initialized.
    
    But it looks like we need to remove cache_fresh_locked completely in
    sunrpc_cache_lookup:
    
    In (1) we've only wanted to make cache_fresh_unlocked->cache_dequeue so
    that cache_requests with no readers also release corresponding
    cache_head, to fix their leak.  We with Vasily were not sure if
    cache_fresh_locked and cache_fresh_unlocked should be used in pair or
    not, so we've guessed to use them in pair.
    
    Now we see that we don't want the CACHE_VALID bit set here by
    cache_fresh_locked, as "valid" means "initialized" and there is no
    initialization in sunrpc_cache_add_entry. Both expiry_time and
    last_refresh are not used in cache_fresh_unlocked code-path and also not
    required for the initial fix.
    
    So to conclude cache_fresh_locked was called by mistake, and we can just
    safely remove it instead of crutching it with CACHE_NEGATIVE. It looks
    ideologically better for me. Hope I don't miss something here.
    
    Here is our crash backtrace:

    powerpc: Fix vDSO clock_getres()
    
    [ Upstream commit 552263456215ada7ee8700ce022d12b0cffe4802 ]
    
    clock_getres in the vDSO library has to preserve the same behaviour
    of posix_get_hrtimer_res().
    
    In particular, posix_get_hrtimer_res() does:
        sec = 0;
        ns = hrtimer_resolution;
    and hrtimer_resolution depends on the enablement of the high
    resolution timers that can happen either at compile or at run time.
    
    Fix the powerpc vdso implementation of clock_getres keeping a copy of
    hrtimer_resolution in vdso data and using that directly.

    ARM: dts: omap3-tao3530: Fix incorrect MMC card detection GPIO polarity
    
    [ Upstream commit 287897f9aaa2ad1c923d9875914f57c4dc9159c8 ]
    
    The MMC card detection GPIO polarity is active low on TAO3530, like in many
    other similar boards. Now the card is not detected and it is unable to
    mount rootfs from an SD card.
    
    Fix this by using the correct polarity.
    
    This incorrect polarity was defined already in the commit 30d95c6d7092
    ("ARM: dts: omap3: Add Technexion TAO3530 SOM omap3-tao3530.dtsi") in v3.18
    kernel and later changed to use defined GPIO constants in v4.4 kernel by
    the commit 3a637e008e54 ("ARM: dts: Use defined GPIO constants in flags
    cell for OMAP2+ boards").
    
    While the latter commit did not introduce the issue I'm marking it with
    Fixes tag due the v4.4 kernels still being maintained.

    Btrfs: fix negative subv_writers counter and data space leak after buffered write
    
    [ Upstream commit a0e248bb502d5165b3314ac3819e888fdcdf7d9f ]
    
    When doing a buffered write it's possible to leave the subv_writers
    counter of the root, used for synchronization between buffered nocow
    writers and snapshotting. This happens in an exceptional case like the
    following:
    
    1) We fail to allocate data space for the write, since there's not
       enough available data space nor enough unallocated space for allocating
       a new data block group;
    
    2) Because of that failure, we try to go to NOCOW mode, which succeeds
       and therefore we set the local variable 'only_release_metadata' to true
       and set the root's sub_writers counter to 1 through the call to
       btrfs_start_write_no_snapshotting() made by check_can_nocow();
    
    3) The call to btrfs_copy_from_user() returns zero, which is very unlikely
       to happen but not impossible;
    
    4) No pages are copied because btrfs_copy_from_user() returned zero;
    
    5) We call btrfs_end_write_no_snapshotting() which decrements the root's
       subv_writers counter to 0;
    
    6) We don't set 'only_release_metadata' back to 'false' because we do
       it only if 'copied', the value returned by btrfs_copy_from_user(), is
       greater than zero;
    
    7) On the next iteration of the while loop, which processes the same
       page range, we are now able to allocate data space for the write (we
       got enough data space released in the meanwhile);
    
    8) After this if we fail at btrfs_delalloc_reserve_metadata(), because
       now there isn't enough free metadata space, or in some other place
       further below (prepare_pages(), lock_and_cleanup_extent_if_need(),
       btrfs_dirty_pages()), we break out of the while loop with
       'only_release_metadata' having a value of 'true';
    
    9) Because 'only_release_metadata' is 'true' we end up decrementing the
       root's subv_writers counter to -1 (through a call to
       btrfs_end_write_no_snapshotting()), and we also end up not releasing the
       data space previously reserved through btrfs_check_data_free_space().
       As a consequence the mechanism for synchronizing NOCOW buffered writes
       with snapshotting gets broken.
    
    Fix this by always setting 'only_release_metadata' to false at the start
    of each iteration.

    xhci: make sure interrupts are restored to correct state

    spin_unlock_irqrestore() might be called with stale flags after

    If a usb2 port just finished resuming while the port status is read
    the spin lock will be temporary released and re-acquired in a separate
    function. The flags parameter is passed as value instead of a pointer,
    not updating flags properly before the final spin_unlock_irqrestore()
    is called.

    quota: Check that quota is not dirty before release
    
    commit df4bb5d128e2c44848aeb36b7ceceba3ac85080d upstream.
    
    There is a race window where quota was redirted once we drop dq_list_lock inside dqput(),
    but before we grab dquot->dq_lock inside dquot_release()
    
    TASK1                                                       TASK2 (chowner)
    ->dqput()
      we_slept:
        spin_lock(&dq_list_lock)
        if (dquot_dirty(dquot)) {
              spin_unlock(&dq_list_lock);
              dquot->dq_sb->dq_op->write_dquot(dquot);
              goto we_slept
        if (test_bit(DQ_ACTIVE_B, &dquot->dq_flags)) {
              spin_unlock(&dq_list_lock);
              dquot->dq_sb->dq_op->release_dquot(dquot);
                                                                dqget()
                                                                mark_dquot_dirty()
                                                                dqput()
              goto we_slept;
            }
    So dquot dirty quota will be released by TASK1, but on next we_sleept loop
    we detect this and call ->write_dquot() for it.

    powerpc: Allow 64bit VDSO __kernel_sync_dicache to work across ranges >4GB
    
    commit f9ec11165301982585e5e5f606739b5bae5331f3 upstream.
    
    When calling __kernel_sync_dicache with a size >4GB, we were masking
    off the upper 32 bits, so we would incorrectly flush a range smaller
    than intended.
    
    This patch replaces the 32 bit shifts with 64 bit ones, so that
    the full size is accounted for.

    ACPI: PM: Avoid attaching ACPI PM domain to certain devices
    
    commit b9ea0bae260f6aae546db224daa6ac1bd9d94b91 upstream.
    
    Certain ACPI-enumerated devices represented as platform devices in
    Linux, like fans, require special low-level power management handling
    implemented by their drivers that is not in agreement with the ACPI
    PM domain behavior.  That leads to problems with managing ACPI fans
    during system-wide suspend and resume.
    
    For this reason, make acpi_dev_pm_attach() skip the affected devices
    by adding a list of device IDs to avoid to it and putting the IDs of
    the affected devices into that list.

    In i2c_acpi_remove_space_handler(), a leak occurs whenever the
    "data" parameter is initialized to 0 before being passed to
    acpi_bus_get_private_data().
    
    This is because the NULL pointer check in acpi_bus_get_private_data()
    (condition->if(!*data)) returns EINVAL and, in consequence, memory is
    never freed in i2c_acpi_remove_space_handler().
    
    Fix the NULL pointer check in acpi_bus_get_private_data() to follow
    the analogous check in acpi_get_data_full().

    ACPI: OSL: only free map once in osl.c
    
    commit 833a426cc471b6088011b3d67f1dc4e147614647 upstream.
    
    acpi_os_map_cleanup checks map->refcount outside of acpi_ioremap_lock
    before freeing the map. This creates a race condition the can result
    in the map being freed more than once.
    A panic can be caused by running
    
    for ((i=0; i<10; i++))
    do
            for ((j=0; j<100000; j++))

            done &
    done
    
    This patch makes sure that only the process that drops the reference
    to 0 does the freeing.

    commit 11609a7e21f8cea42630350aa57662928fa4dc63 upstream.
    
    If a process is interrupted while accessing the video device and the
    device lock is contended, release() could return early and fail to free
    related resources.
    
    Note that the return value of the v4l2 release file operation is
    ignored.

    ar5523: check NULL before memcpy() in ar5523_cmd()
    
    commit 315cee426f87658a6799815845788fde965ddaad upstream.
    
    memcpy() call with "idata == NULL && ilen == 0" results in undefined
    behavior in ar5523_cmd(). For example, NULL is passed in callchain
    "ar5523_stat_work() -> ar5523_cmd_write() -> ar5523_cmd()". This patch
    adds ilen check before memcpy() call in ar5523_cmd() to prevent an
    undefined behavior.

    blk-mq: avoid sysfs buffer overflow with too many CPU cores
    
    commit 8962842ca5abdcf98e22ab3b2b45a103f0408b95 upstream.
    
    It is reported that sysfs buffer overflow can be triggered if the system
    has too many CPU cores(>841 on 4K PAGE_SIZE) when showing CPUs of
    hctx via /sys/block/$DEV/mq/$N/cpu_list.
    
    Use snprintf to avoid the potential buffer overflow.
    
    This version doesn't change the attribute format, and simply stops
    showing CPU numbers if the buffer is going to overflow.

    workqueue: Fix pwq ref leak in rescuer_thread()
    
    commit e66b39af00f426b3356b96433d620cb3367ba1ff upstream.
    
    008847f66c3 ("workqueue: allow rescuer thread to do more work.") made
    the rescuer worker requeue the pwq immediately if there may be more
    work items which need rescuing instead of waiting for the next mayday
    timer expiration.  Unfortunately, it doesn't check whether the pwq is
    already on the mayday list and unconditionally gets the ref and moves
    it onto the list.  This doesn't corrupt the list but creates an
    additional reference to the pwq.  It got queued twice but will only be
    removed once.
    
    This leak later can trigger pwq refcnt warning on workqueue
    destruction and prevent freeing of the workqueue.

    workqueue: Fix spurious sanity check failures in destroy_workqueue()
    
    commit def98c84b6cdf2eeea19ec5736e90e316df5206b upstream.
    
    Before actually destrying a workqueue, destroy_workqueue() checks
    whether it's actually idle.  If it isn't, it prints out a bunch of
    warning messages and leaves the workqueue dangling.  It unfortunately
    has a couple issues.
    
    * Mayday list queueing increments pwq's refcnts which gets detected as
      busy and fails the sanity checks.  However, because mayday list
      queueing is asynchronous, this condition can happen without any
      actual work items left in the workqueue.
    
    * Sanity check failure leaves the sysfs interface behind too which can
      lead to init failure of newer instances of the workqueue.
    
    This patch fixes the above two by
    
    * If a workqueue has a rescuer, disable and kill the rescuer before
      sanity checks.  Disabling and killing is guaranteed to flush the
      existing mayday list.
    
    * Remove sysfs interface before sanity checks.

    lib: raid6: fix awk build warnings
    
    commit 702600eef73033ddd4eafcefcbb6560f3e3a90f7 upstream.
    
    Newer versions of awk spit out these fun warnings:
            awk: ../lib/raid6/unroll.awk:16: warning: regexp escape sequence `\#' is not a known regexp operator
    
    As commit 700c1018b86d ("x86/insn: Fix awk regexp warnings") showed, it
    turns out that there are a number of awk strings that do not need to be
    escaped and newer versions of awk now warn about this.
    
    Fix the string up so that no warning is produced.  The exact same kernel
    module gets created before and after this patch, showing that it wasn't
    needed.

    The page we were trying to drop had a page->private, but had no
    page->mapping and so called drop_buffers, assuming that we had a
    buffer_head on the page, and then panic'ed trying to deref 1, which is
    our page->private for data pages.
    
    This is happening because we're truncating the free space cache while
    we're trying to load the free space cache.  This isn't supposed to
    happen, and I'll fix that in a followup patch.  However we still
    shouldn't allow those sort of mistakes to result in messing with pages
    that do not belong to us.  So add the page->mapping check to verify that
    we still own this page after dropping and re-acquiring the page lock.
    
    This page being unlocked as:

    virtio-balloon: fix managed page counts when migrating pages between zones
    
    commit 63341ab03706e11a31e3dd8ccc0fbc9beaf723f0 upstream.
    
    In case we have to migrate a ballon page to a newpage of another zone, the
    managed page count of both zones is wrong. Paired with memory offlining
    (which will adjust the managed page count), we can trigger kernel crashes
    and all kinds of different symptoms.
    
    One way to reproduce:
    1. Start a QEMU guest with 4GB, no NUMA
    2. Hotplug a 1GB DIMM and online the memory to ZONE_NORMAL
    3. Inflate the balloon to 1GB
    4. Unplug the DIMM (be quick, otherwise unmovable data ends up on it)
    5. Observe /proc/zoneinfo
      Node 0, zone   Normal

    6. Do anything that requires some memory (e.g., inflate the balloon some
    more). The OOM goes crazy and the system crashes

      [root@vm ~]# cat /proc/meminfo
      -bash: fork: Cannot allocate memory
    
    Fix it by properly adjusting the managed page count when migrating if
    the zone changed. The managed page count of the zones now looks after
    unplug of the DIMM (and after deflating the balloon) just like before
    inflating the balloon (and plugging+onlining the DIMM).
    
    We'll temporarily modify the totalram page count. If this ever becomes a
    problem, we can fine tune by providing helpers that don't touch
    the totalram pages (e.g., adjust_zone_managed_page_count()).
    
    Please note that fixing up the managed page count is only necessary when
    we adjusted the managed page count when inflating - only if we
    don't have VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_DEFLATE_ON_OOM. With that feature, the
    managed page count is not touched when inflating/deflating.

    mtd: spear_smi: Fix Write Burst mode
    
    commit 69c7f4618c16b4678f8a4949b6bb5ace259c0033 upstream.
    
    Any write with either dd or flashcp to a device driven by the
    spear_smi.c driver will pass through the spear_smi_cpy_toio()
    function. This function will get called for chunks of up to 256 bytes.
    If the amount of data is smaller, we may have a problem if the data
    length is not 4-byte aligned. In this situation, the kernel panics
    during the memcpy:
    
        # dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1001 count=1 of=/dev/mtd6
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070000, src c7be8800, len 256
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070100, src c7be8900, len 256
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070200, src c7be8a00, len 256
        spear_smi_cpy_toio [620] dest c9070300, src c7be8b00, len 233
        Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x808) at 0xc90703e8
        [...]
        PC is at memcpy+0xcc/0x330
    
    The above error occurs because the implementation of memcpy_toio()
    tries to optimize the number of I/O by writing 4 bytes at a time as
    much as possible, until there are less than 4 bytes left and then
    switches to word or byte writes.
    
    Unfortunately, the specification states about the Write Burst mode:
    
            "the next AHB Write request should point to the next
            incremented address and should have the same size (byte,
            half-word or word)"
    
    This means ARM architecture implementation of memcpy_toio() cannot
    reliably be used blindly here. Workaround this situation by update the
    write path to stick to byte access when the burst length is not
    multiple of 4.

    usb: mon: Fix a deadlock in usbmon between mmap and read
    
    commit 19e6317d24c25ee737c65d1ffb7483bdda4bb54a upstream.
    
    The problem arises because our read() function grabs a lock of the
    circular buffer, finds something of interest, then invokes copy_to_user()
    straight from the buffer, which in turn takes mm->mmap_sem. In the same
    time, the callback mon_bin_vma_fault() is invoked under mm->mmap_sem.
    It attempts to take the fetch lock and deadlocks.
    
    This patch does away with protecting of our page list with any
    semaphores, and instead relies on the kernel not close the device
    while mmap is active in a process.
    
    In addition, we prohibit re-sizing of a buffer while mmap is active.
    This way, when (now unlocked) fault is processed, it works with the
    page that is intended to be mapped-in, and not some other random page.
    Note that this may have an ABI impact, but hopefully no legitimate
    program is this wrong.

    commit 7c67cf6658cec70d8a43229f2ce74ca1443dc95e upstream.

    Similar to commit ac343366846a ("xhci: Increase STS_SAVE timeout in

    able to suspend again.

    commit 53f35a39c3860baac1e5ca80bf052751cfb24a99 upstream.
    
    Fix a general protection fault when accessing the endpoint descriptors
    which could be triggered by a malicious device due to missing sanity
    checks on the number of endpoints.

    Failing to do so could cause the driver to misbehave or trigger a WARN()
    in usb_submit_urb() that kernels with panic_on_warn set would choke on.

    usb: Allow USB device to be warm reset in suspended state

    On Dell WD15 dock, sometimes USB ethernet cannot be detected after plugging
    cable to the ethernet port, the hub and roothub get runtime resumed and
    runtime suspended immediately:

    As Mathias pointed out, the hub enters Cold Attach Status state and
    requires a warm reset. However usb_reset_device() bails out early when
    the device is in suspended state, as its callers port_event() and
    hub_event() don't always resume the device.
    
    Since there's nothing wrong to reset a suspended device, allow
    usb_reset_device() to do so to solve the issue.

    fs/proc/array.c: allow reporting eip/esp for all coredumping threads
    
    commit cb8f381f1613cafe3aec30809991cd56e7135d92 upstream.
    
    0a1eb2d474ed ("fs/proc: Stop reporting eip and esp in /proc/PID/stat")
    stopped reporting eip/esp and fd7d56270b52 ("fs/proc: Report eip/esp in
    /prod/PID/stat for coredumping") reintroduced the feature to fix a
    regression with userspace core dump handlers (such as minicoredumper).
    
    Because PF_DUMPCORE is only set for the primary thread, this didn't fix
    the original problem for secondary threads.  Allow reporting the eip/esp
    for all threads by checking for PF_EXITING as well.  This is set for all
    the other threads when they are killed.  coredump_wait() waits for all the
    tasks to become inactive before proceeding to invoke a core dumper.

    proc: fix coredump vs read /proc/*/stat race
    
    commit 8bb2ee192e482c5d500df9f2b1b26a560bd3026f upstream.
    
    do_task_stat() accesses IP and SP of a task without bumping reference
    count of a stack (which became an entity with independent lifetime at
    some point).
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <sys/stat.h>
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <sys/time.h>
        #include <sys/resource.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <sys/wait.h>
    
        int main(void)
        {
            setrlimit(RLIMIT_CORE, &(struct rlimit){});
    
            while (1) {
                    char buf[64];
                    char buf2[4096];
                    pid_t pid;
                    int fd;
    
                    pid = fork();
                    if (pid == 0) {
                            *(volatile int *)0 = 0;
                    }
    
                    snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "/proc/%u/stat", pid);
                    fd = open(buf, O_RDONLY);
                    read(fd, buf2, sizeof(buf2));
                    close(fd);
    
                    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
            }

    fs/proc: Report eip/esp in /prod/PID/stat for coredumping
    
    commit fd7d56270b526ca3ed0c224362e3c64a0f86687a upstream.
    
    Commit 0a1eb2d474ed ("fs/proc: Stop reporting eip and esp in
    /proc/PID/stat") stopped reporting eip/esp because it is
    racy and dangerous for executing tasks. The comment adds:
    
        As far as I know, there are no use programs that make any
        material use of these fields, so just get rid of them.
    
    However, existing userspace core-dump-handler applications (for
    example, minicoredumper) are using these fields since they
    provide an excellent cross-platform interface to these valuable
    pointers. So that commit introduced a user space visible
    regression.
    
    Partially revert the change and make the readout possible for
    tasks with the proper permissions and only if the target task
    has the PF_DUMPCORE flag set.

    commit 0a1eb2d474edfe75466be6b4677ad84e5e8ca3f5 upstream.
    
    Reporting these fields on a non-current task is dangerous.  If the
    task is in any state other than normal kernel code, they may contain
    garbage or even kernel addresses on some architectures.  (x86_64
    used to do this.  I bet lots of architectures still do.)  With
    CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK=y, it can OOPS, too.
    
    As far as I know, there are no use programs that make any material
    use of these fields, so just get rid of them.

    sched/core, x86: Make struct thread_info arch specific again
    
    commit c8061485a0d7569a865a3cc3c63347b0f42b3765 upstream.
    
    The following commit:
    
      c65eacbe290b ("sched/core: Allow putting thread_info into task_struct")
    
    ... made 'struct thread_info' a generic struct with only a
    single ::flags member, if CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK_STRUCT=y is
    selected.
    
    This change however seems to be quite x86 centric, since at least the
    generic preemption code (asm-generic/preempt.h) assumes that struct
    thread_info also has a preempt_count member, which apparently was not
    true for x86.
    
    We could add a bit more #ifdefs to solve this problem too, but it seems
    to be much simpler to make struct thread_info arch specific
    again. This also makes the conversion to THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK_STRUCT a
    bit easier for architectures that have a couple of arch specific stuff
    in their thread_info definition.
    
    The arch specific stuff _could_ be moved to thread_struct. However
    keeping them in thread_info makes it easier: accessing thread_info
    members is simple, since it is at the beginning of the task_struct,
    while the thread_struct is at the end. At least on s390 the offsets
    needed to access members of the thread_struct (with task_struct as
    base) are too large for various asm instructions.  This is not a
    problem when keeping these members within thread_info.

    sched/core: Add try_get_task_stack() and put_task_stack()
    
    commit c6c314a613cd7d03fb97713e0d642b493de42e69 upstream.
    
    There are a few places in the kernel that access stack memory
    belonging to a different task.  Before we can start freeing task
    stacks before the task_struct is freed, we need a way for those code
    paths to pin the stack.

    sched/core: Allow putting thread_info into task_struct
    
    commit c65eacbe290b8141554c71b2c94489e73ade8c8d upstream.
    
    If an arch opts in by setting CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK_STRUCT,
    then thread_info is defined as a single 'u32 flags' and is the first
    entry of task_struct.  thread_info::task is removed (it serves no
    purpose if thread_info is embedded in task_struct), and
    thread_info::cpu gets its own slot in task_struct.
    
    This is heavily based on a patch written by Linus.

    [ Upstream commit ca58f55108fee41d87c9123f85ad4863e5de7f45 ]
    
    This is an alternative fix attemp for the issue reported in the commit
    caa8422d01e9 ("ALSA: hda: Flush interrupts on disabling") that was
    reverted later due to regressions.  Instead of tweaking the hardware
    disablement order and the enforced irq flushing, do calling
    cancel_work_sync() of the unsol work early enough, and explicitly
    ignore the unsol events during the shutdown by checking the
    bus->shutdown flag.

    The permissions of the read-only or write-only sysfs files can be
    changed (as root) and the user can then try to read a write-only file or
    write to a read-only file which will lead to kernel crash here.
    
    Protect against that by always validating the show/store callbacks.

    spi: atmel: Fix CS high support
    
    commit 7cbb16b2122c09f2ae393a1542fed628505b9da6 upstream.
    
    Until a few years ago, this driver was only used with CS GPIO. The
    only exception is CS0 on AT91RM9200 which has to use internal CS. A
    limitation of the internal CS is that they don't support CS High.
    
    So by using the CS GPIO the CS high configuration was available except
    for the particular case CS0 on RM9200.
    
    When the support for the internal chip-select was added, the check of
    the CS high support was not updated. Due to this the driver accepts
    this configuration for all the SPI controller v2 (used by all SoCs
    excepting the AT91RM9200) whereas the hardware doesn't support it for
    infernal CS.
    
    This patch fixes the test to match the hardware capabilities.

    commit ffdde5932042600c6807d46c1550b28b0db6a3bc upstream.
    
    In crypto_report, a new skb is created via nlmsg_new(). This skb should
    be released if crypto_report_alg() fails.

    crypto: crypto4xx - fix double-free in crypto4xx_destroy_sdr
    
    commit 746c908c4d72e49068ab216c3926d2720d71a90d upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a crash that can happen during probe
    when the available dma memory is not enough (this can
    happen if the crypto4xx is built as a module).
    
    The descriptor window mapping would end up being free'd
    twice, once in crypto4xx_build_pdr() and the second time
    in crypto4xx_destroy_sdr().

    KVM: x86: fix presentation of TSX feature in ARCH_CAPABILITIES
    
    commit cbbaa2727aa3ae9e0a844803da7cef7fd3b94f2b upstream.
    
    KVM does not implement MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL, so it must not be presented
    to the guests.  It is also confusing to have !ARCH_CAP_TSX_CTRL_MSR &&
    !RTM && ARCH_CAP_TAA_NO: lack of MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL suggests TSX was not
    hidden (it actually was), yet the value says that TSX is not vulnerable
    to microarchitectural data sampling.  Fix both.

    KVM: x86: do not modify masked bits of shared MSRs
    
    commit de1fca5d6e0105c9d33924e1247e2f386efc3ece upstream.
    
    "Shared MSRs" are guest MSRs that are written to the host MSRs but
    keep their value until the next return to userspace.  They support
    a mask, so that some bits keep the host value, but this mask is
    only used to skip an unnecessary MSR write and the value written
    to the MSR is always the guest MSR.
    
    Fix this and, while at it, do not update smsr->values[slot].curr if
    for whatever reason the wrmsr fails.  This should only happen due to
    reserved bits, so the value written to smsr->values[slot].curr
    will not match when the user-return notifier and the host value will
    always be restored.  However, it is untidy and in rare cases this
    can actually avoid spurious WRMSRs on return to userspace.

    can: slcan: Fix use-after-free Read in slcan_open
    
    commit 9ebd796e24008f33f06ebea5a5e6aceb68b51794 upstream.
    
    Slcan_open doesn't clean-up device which registration failed from the
    slcan_devs device list. On next open this list is iterated and freed
    device is accessed. Fix this by calling slc_free_netdev in error path.

    CIFS: Fix SMB2 oplock break processing
    
    commit fa9c2362497fbd64788063288dc4e74daf977ebb upstream.
    
    Even when mounting modern protocol version the server may be
    configured without supporting SMB2.1 leases and the client
    uses SMB2 oplock to optimize IO performance through local caching.
    
    However there is a problem in oplock break handling that leads
    to missing a break notification on the client who has a file
    opened. It latter causes big latencies to other clients that
    are trying to open the same file.
    
    The problem reproduces when there are multiple shares from the
    same server mounted on the client. The processing code tries to
    match persistent and volatile file ids from the break notification
    with an open file but it skips all share besides the first one.
    Fix this by looking up in all shares belonging to the server that
    issued the oplock break.

    CIFS: Fix NULL-pointer dereference in smb2_push_mandatory_locks
    
    commit 6f582b273ec23332074d970a7fb25bef835df71f upstream.
    
    Currently when the client creates a cifsFileInfo structure for
    a newly opened file, it allocates a list of byte-range locks
    with a pointer to the new cfile and attaches this list to the
    inode's lock list. The latter happens before initializing all
    other fields, e.g. cfile->tlink. Thus a partially initialized
    cifsFileInfo structure becomes available to other threads that
    walk through the inode's lock list. One example of such a thread
    may be an oplock break worker thread that tries to push all
    cached byte-range locks. This causes NULL-pointer dereference
    in smb2_push_mandatory_locks() when accessing cfile->tlink:

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Avoid potential buffer overflows
    
    commit 4cc8d6505ab82db3357613d36e6c58a297f57f7c upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported an invalid access in PCM OSS read, and this seems
    to be an overflow of the internal buffer allocated for a plugin.
    Since the rate plugin adjusts its transfer size dynamically, the
    calculation for the chained plugin might be bigger than the given
    buffer size in some extreme cases, which lead to such an buffer
    overflow as caught by KASAN.
    
    Fix it by limiting the max transfer size properly by checking against
    the destination size in each plugin transfer callback.

    sched/fair: Scale bandwidth quota and period without losing quota/period ratio precision
    
    commit 4929a4e6faa0f13289a67cae98139e727f0d4a97 upstream.
    
    The quota/period ratio is used to ensure a child task group won't get
    more bandwidth than the parent task group, and is calculated as:
    
      normalized_cfs_quota() = [(quota_us << 20) / period_us]
    
    If the quota/period ratio was changed during this scaling due to
    precision loss, it will cause inconsistency between parent and child
    task groups.
    
    See below example:
    
    A userspace container manager (kubelet) does three operations:
    
     1) Create a parent cgroup, set quota to 1,000us and period to 10,000us.
     2) Create a few children cgroups.
     3) Set quota to 1,000us and period to 10,000us on a child cgroup.
    
    These operations are expected to succeed. However, if the scaling of
    147/128 happens before step 3, quota and period of the parent cgroup
    will be changed:
    
      new_quota: 1148437ns,   1148us
     new_period: 11484375ns, 11484us
    
    And when step 3 comes in, the ratio of the child cgroup will be
    104857, which will be larger than the parent cgroup ratio (104821),
    and will fail.
    
    Scaling them by a factor of 2 will fix the problem.

    As the man(2) page for utime/utimes states, EPERM is returned when the

    However, in a NFS directory mounted from knfsd, it will return EACCES

    powerpc/math-emu: Update macros from GCC
    
    [ Upstream commit b682c8692442711684befe413cf93cf01c5324ea ]
    
    The add_ssaaaa, sub_ddmmss, umul_ppmm and udiv_qrnnd macros originate
    from GCC's longlong.h which in turn was copied from GMP's longlong.h a
    few decades ago.
    
    This was found when compiling with clang:
    
       arch/powerpc/math-emu/fnmsub.c:46:2: error: invalid use of a cast in a
       inline asm context requiring an l-value: remove the cast or build with
       -fheinous-gnu-extensions
               FP_ADD_D(R, T, B);
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       ...
    
       ./arch/powerpc/include/asm/sfp-machine.h:283:27: note: expanded from
       macro 'sub_ddmmss'
                      : "=r" ((USItype)(sh)),                                  \
                              ~~~~~~~~~~^~~
    
    Segher points out: this was fixed in GCC over 16 years ago
    ( https://gcc.gnu.org/r56600 ), and in GMP (where it comes from)
    presumably before that.
    
    Update the add_ssaaaa, sub_ddmmss, umul_ppmm and udiv_qrnnd macros to
    the latest GCC version in order to git rid of the invalid casts. These
    were taken as-is from GCC's longlong in order to make future syncs
    obvious. Other parts of sfp-machine.h were left as-is as the file
    contains more features than present in longlong.h.

    [ Upstream commit e07db28eea38ed4e332b3a89f3995c86b713cb5b ]
    
    Building a single target in an external module fails due to missing

    For example,
    
      $ make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD foo.o
    
    will fail in the following way:
    
      CC [M]  /home/masahiro/foo/foo.o
    /bin/sh: 1: cannot create /home/masahiro/foo/.tmp_versions/foo.mod: Directory nonexistent
    
    This is because $(cmd_crmodverdir) is executed only before building
    /, %/, %.ko single targets of external modules. Create .tmp_versions
    in the 'prepare' target.

    modpost: skip ELF local symbols during section mismatch check
    
    [ Upstream commit a4d26f1a0958bb1c2b60c6f1e67c6f5d43e2647b ]
    
    During development of a serial console driver with a gcc 8.2.0
    toolchain for RISC-V, the following modpost warning appeared:
    
    ----
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.data+0x19b10): Section mismatch in reference from the variable .LANCHOR1 to the function .init.text:sifive_serial_console_setup()
    The variable .LANCHOR1 references
    the function __init sifive_serial_console_setup()
    If the reference is valid then annotate the
    variable with __init* or __refdata (see linux/init.h) or name the variable:
    *_template, *_timer, *_sht, *_ops, *_probe, *_probe_one, *_console
    ----
    
    ".LANCHOR1" is an ELF local symbol, automatically created by gcc's section
    anchor generation code:
    
    https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Anchored-Addresses.html
    
    https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=gcc/varasm.c;h=cd9591a45617464946dcf9a126dde277d9de9804;hb=9fb89fa845c1b2e0a18d85ada0b077c84508ab78#l7473
    
    This was verified by compiling the kernel with -fno-section-anchors
    and observing that the ".LANCHOR1" ELF local symbol disappeared, and
    modpost no longer warned about the section mismatch.  The serial
    driver code idiom triggering the warning is standard Linux serial
    driver practice that has a specific whitelist inclusion in modpost.c.
    
    I'm neither a modpost nor an ELF expert, but naively, it doesn't seem
    useful for modpost to report section mismatch warnings caused by ELF
    local symbols by default.  Local symbols have compiler-generated
    names, and thus bypass modpost's whitelisting algorithm, which relies
    on the presence of a non-autogenerated symbol name.  This increases
    the likelihood that false positive warnings will be generated (as in
    the above case).
    
    Thus, disable section mismatch reporting on ELF local symbols.  The
    rationale here is similar to that of commit 2e3a10a1551d ("ARM: avoid
    ARM binutils leaking ELF local symbols") and of similar code already
    present in modpost.c:
    
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/scripts/mod/modpost.c?h=v4.19-rc4&id=7876320f88802b22d4e2daf7eb027dd14175a0f8#n1256
    
    This third version of the patch implements a suggestion from Masahiro
    Yamada <yamada.masahiro@socionext.com> to restructure the code as an
    additional pattern matching step inside secref_whitelist(), and
    further improves the patch description.

    dma-mapping: fix return type of dma_set_max_seg_size()
    
    [ Upstream commit c9d76d0655c06b8c1f944e46c4fd9e9cf4b331c0 ]
    
    The function dma_set_max_seg_size() can return either 0 on success or
    -EIO on error. Change its return type from unsigned int to int to
    capture this.

    [ Upstream commit 627469e4445b9b12e0229b3bdf8564d5ce384dd7 ]
    
    The function coh901318_alloc_chan_resources() calls spin_lock_irqsave()
    before calling coh901318_config().
    But coh901318_config() calls spin_lock_irqsave() again in its
    definition, which may cause a double-lock bug.
    
    Because coh901318_config() is only called by
    coh901318_alloc_chan_resources(), the bug fix is to remove the
    calls to spin-lock and -unlock functions in coh901318_config().

    pinctrl: qcom: ssbi-gpio: fix gpio-hog related boot issues
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ed07855773814337b9814f1c3e866df52ebce68 ]
    
    When attempting to setup up a gpio hog, device probing will repeatedly
    fail with -EPROBE_DEFERED errors. It is caused by a circular dependency
    between the gpio and pinctrl frameworks. If the gpio-ranges property is
    present in device tree, then the gpio framework will handle the gpio pin
    registration and eliminate the circular dependency.
    
    See Christian Lamparter's commit a86caa9ba5d7 ("pinctrl: msm: fix
    gpio-hog related boot issues") for a detailed commit message that
    explains the issue in much more detail. The code comment in this commit
    came from Christian's commit.
    
    I did not test this change against any hardware supported by this
    particular driver, however I was able to validate this same fix works
    for pinctrl-spmi-gpio.c using a LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone.

    scsi: zfcp: drop default switch case which might paper over missing case
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c902936e55cff9335b27ed632fc45e7115ced75 ]
    
    This was introduced with v4.18 commit 8c3d20aada70 ("scsi: zfcp: fix
    missing REC trigger trace for all objects in ERP_FAILED") but would now
    suppress helpful -Wswitch compiler warnings when building with W=1 such as
    the following forced example:
    
    drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_erp.c: In function 'zfcp_erp_handle_failed':
    drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_erp.c:126:2: warning: enumeration value 'ZFCP_ERP_ACTION_REOPEN_PORT_FORCED' not handled in switch [-Wswitch]
      switch (want) {
      ^~~~~~
    
    But then again, only with W=1 we would notice unhandled enum cases.
    Without the default cases and a missed unhandled enum case, the code might
    perform unforeseen things we might not want...
    
    As of today, we never run through the removed default case, so removing it
    is no functional change.  In the future, we never should run through a
    default case but introduce the necessary specific case(s) to handle new
    functionality.

    clearly must provide a way to have enough memory installed for some to
    be present outside the low 4GiB physical address range.  With the memory
    map of the BCM1250 SOC it has been built around it means over 1GiB of
    actual DRAM, as only the first 1GiB is mapped in the low 4GiB physical
    address range[1].
    
    Complement commit cce335ae47e2 ("[MIPS] 64-bit Sibyte kernels need
    DMA32.") then and also enable ZONE_DMA32 for LittleSur.

    extcon: max8997: Fix lack of path setting in USB device mode
    
    [ Upstream commit a2dc50914744eea9f83a70a5db0486be625e5dc0 ]
    
    MAX8997 driver disables automatic path selection from MicroUSB connector
    and manually sets path to either UART or USB lines. However the code for
    setting USB path worked only for USB host mode (when ID pin is set
    to ground). When standard USB cable (USB device mode) is connected, path
    registers are not touched. This means that once the non-USB accessory is
    connected to MAX8997-operated micro USB port, the path is no longer set
    to USB and USB device mode doesn't work. This patch fixes it by setting
    USB path both for USB and USB host modes.

    ARM: 8813/1: Make aligned 2-byte getuser()/putuser() atomic on ARMv6+
    
    [ Upstream commit 344eb5539abf3e0b6ce22568c03e86450073e097 ]
    
    getuser() and putuser() (and there underscored variants) use two
    strb[t]/ldrb[t] instructions when they are asked to get/put 16-bits.
    This means that the read/write is not atomic even when performed to a
    16-bit-aligned address.
    
    This leads to problems with vhost: vhost uses __getuser() to read the
    vring's 16-bit avail.index field, and if it happens to observe a partial
    update of the index, wrong descriptors will be used which will lead to a
    breakdown of the virtio communication.  A similar problem exists for
    __putuser() which is used to write to the vring's used.index field.
    
    The reason these functions use strb[t]/ldrb[t] is because strht/ldrht
    instructions did not exist until ARMv6T2/ARMv7.  So we should be easily
    able to fix this on ARMv7.  Also, since all ARMv6 processors also don't
    actually use the unprivileged instructions anymore for uaccess (since
    CONFIG_CPU_USE_DOMAINS is not used) we can easily fix them too.

    serial: core: Allow processing sysrq at port unlock time
    
    [ Upstream commit d6e1935819db0c91ce4a5af82466f3ab50d17346 ]
    
    Right now serial drivers process sysrq keys deep in their character
    receiving code.  This means that they've already grabbed their
    port->lock spinlock.  This can end up getting in the way if we've go
    to do serial stuff (especially kgdb) in response to the sysrq.
    
    Serial drivers have various hacks in them to handle this.  Looking at
    '8250_port.c' you can see that the console_write() skips locking if
    we're in the sysrq handler.  Looking at 'msm_serial.c' you can see
    that the port lock is dropped around uart_handle_sysrq_char().
    
    It turns out that these hacks aren't exactly perfect.  If you have
    lockdep turned on and use something like the 8250_port hack you'll get
    a splat that looks like:
    
      WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected

       *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    The hack used in 'msm_serial.c' doesn't cause the above splats but it
    seems a bit ugly to unlock / lock our spinlock deep in our irq
    handler.
    
    It seems like we could defer processing the sysrq until the end of the
    interrupt handler right after we've unlocked the port.  With this
    scheme if a whole batch of sysrq characters comes in one irq then we
    won't handle them all, but that seems like it should be a fine
    compromise.

    If the nullity check for `substream->runtime` is outside of the lock
    region, it is possible to have a null runtime in the critical section
    if snd_pcm_detach_substream is called right before the lock.

    [ Upstream commit 79aae6acbef16f720a7949f8fc6ac69816c79d62 ]
    
    The device md->input is used after it is released. Setting the device
    data to NULL is unnecessary as the device is never used again. Instead,
    md->input should be assigned NULL to avoid accessing the freed memory
    accidently. Besides, checking md->si against NULL is superfluous as it
    points to a variable address, which cannot be NULL.

    NFC: nxp-nci: Fix NULL pointer dereference after I2C communication error
    
    [ Upstream commit a71a29f50de1ef97ab55c151a1598eb12dde379d ]
    
    I2C communication errors (-EREMOTEIO) during the IRQ handler of nxp-nci
    result in a NULL pointer dereference at the moment:
    
        BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
        Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI
        CPU: 1 PID: 355 Comm: irq/137-nxp-nci Not tainted 5.4.0-rc6 #1

         ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x40
    
    Afterward the kernel must be rebooted to work properly again.
    
    This happens because it attempts to call nci_recv_frame() with skb == NULL.
    However, unlike nxp_nci_fw_recv_frame(), nci_recv_frame() does not have any
    NULL checks for skb, causing the NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Change the code to call only nxp_nci_fw_recv_frame() in case of an error.
    Make sure to log it so it is obvious that a communication error occurred.
    The error above then becomes:
    
        nxp-nci_i2c i2c-NXP1001:00: NFC: Read failed with error -121
        nci: __nci_request: wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout failed 0

    x86/PCI: Avoid AMD FCH XHCI USB PME# from D0 defect
    
    commit 7e8ce0e2b036dbc6617184317983aea4f2c52099 upstream.
    
    The AMD FCH USB XHCI Controller advertises support for generating PME#
    while in D0.  When in D0, it does signal PME# for USB 3.0 connect events,
    but not for USB 2.0 or USB 1.1 connect events, which means the controller
    doesn't wake correctly for those events.
    
      00:10.0 USB controller [0c03]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] FCH USB XHCI Controller [1022:7914] (rev 20) (prog-if 30 [XHCI])
            Subsystem: Dell FCH USB XHCI Controller [1028:087e]
            Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 3
                    Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1- D2- AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0+,D1-,D2-,D3hot+,D3cold+)
    
    Clear PCI_PM_CAP_PME_D0 in dev->pme_support to indicate the device will not
    assert PME# from D0 so we don't rely on it.

    tty: serial: msm_serial: Fix flow control
    
    commit b027ce258369cbfa88401a691c23dad01deb9f9b upstream.
    
    hci_qca interfaces to the wcn3990 via a uart_dm on the msm8998 mtp and
    Lenovo Miix 630 laptop.  As part of initializing the wcn3990, hci_qca
    disables flow, configures the uart baudrate, and then reenables flow - at
    which point an event is expected to be received over the uart from the
    wcn3990.  It is observed that this event comes after the baudrate change
    but before hci_qca re-enables flow. This is unexpected, and is a result of
    msm_reset() being broken.
    
    According to the uart_dm hardware documentation, it is recommended that
    automatic hardware flow control be enabled by setting RX_RDY_CTL.  Auto
    hw flow control will manage RFR based on the configured watermark.  When
    there is space to receive data, the hw will assert RFR.  When the watermark
    is hit, the hw will de-assert RFR.
    
    The hardware documentation indicates that RFR can me manually managed via
    CR when RX_RDY_CTL is not set.  SET_RFR asserts RFR, and RESET_RFR
    de-asserts RFR.
    
    msm_reset() is broken because after resetting the hardware, it
    unconditionally asserts RFR via SET_RFR.  This enables flow regardless of
    the current configuration, and would undo a previous flow disable
    operation.  It should instead de-assert RFR via RESET_RFR to block flow
    until the hardware is reconfigured.  msm_serial should rely on the client
    to specify that flow should be enabled, either via mctrl() or the termios
    structure, and only assert RFR in response to those triggers.

    x86/apic/32: Avoid bogus LDR warnings
    
    commit fe6f85ca121e9c74e7490fe66b0c5aae38e332c3 upstream.
    
    The removal of the LDR initialization in the bigsmp_32 APIC code unearthed
    a problem in setup_local_APIC().
    
    The code checks unconditionally for a mismatch of the logical APIC id by
    comparing the early APIC id which was initialized in get_smp_config() with
    the actual LDR value in the APIC.
    
    Due to the removal of the bogus LDR initialization the check now can
    trigger on bigsmp_32 APIC systems emitting a warning for every booting
    CPU. This is of course a false positive because the APIC is not using
    logical destination mode.
    
    Restrict the check and the possibly resulting fixup to systems which are
    actually using the APIC in logical destination mode.
