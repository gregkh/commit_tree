    fs-writeback: unplug before cond_resched in writeback_sb_inodes
    
    [ Upstream commit 590dca3a71875461e8fea3013af74386945191b2 ]
    
    Commit 505a666ee3fc ("writeback: plug writeback in wb_writeback() and
    writeback_inodes_wb()") has us holding a plug during writeback_sb_inodes,
    which increases the merge rate when relatively contiguous small files
    are written by the filesystem.  It helps both on flash and spindles.
    
    For an fs_mark workload creating 4K files in parallel across 8 drives,
    this commit improves performance ~9% more by unplugging before calling
    cond_resched().  cond_resched() doesn't trigger an implicit unplug, so
    explicitly getting the IO down to the device before scheduling reduces
    latencies for anyone waiting on clean pages.
    
    It also cuts down on how often we use kblockd to unplug, which means
    less work bouncing from one workqueue to another.
    
    Many more details about how we got here:

    ext4: fix crashes in dioread_nolock mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 74dae4278546b897eb81784fdfcce872ddd8b2b8 ]
    
    Competing overwrite DIO in dioread_nolock mode will just overwrite
    pointer to io_end in the inode. This may result in data corruption or
    extent conversion happening from IO completion interrupt because we
    don't properly set buffer_defer_completion() when unlocked DIO races
    with locked DIO to unwritten extent.
    
    Since unlocked DIO doesn't need io_end for anything, just avoid
    allocating it and corrupting pointer from inode for locked DIO.
    A cleaner fix would be to avoid these games with io_end pointer from the
    inode but that requires more intrusive changes so we leave that for
    later.

    ALSA: pcm: Fix rwsem deadlock for non-atomic PCM stream
    
    [ Upstream commit 67ec1072b053c15564e6090ab30127895dc77a89 ]
    
    A non-atomic PCM stream may take snd_pcm_link_rwsem rw semaphore twice
    in the same code path, e.g. one in snd_pcm_action_nonatomic() and
    another in snd_pcm_stream_lock().  Usually this is OK, but when a
    write lock is issued between these two read locks, the problem
    happens: the write lock is blocked due to the first reade lock, and
    the second read lock is also blocked by the write lock.  This
    eventually deadlocks.
    
    The reason is the way rwsem manages waiters; it's queued like FIFO, so
    even if the writer itself doesn't take the lock yet, it blocks all the
    waiters (including reads) queued after it.
    
    As a workaround, in this patch, we replace the standard down_write()
    with an spinning loop.  This is far from optimal, but it's good
    enough, as the spinning time is supposed to be relatively short for
    normal PCM operations, and the code paths requiring the write lock
    aren't called so often.

    ALSA: seq: Fix double port list deletion
    
    [ Upstream commit 13d5e5d4725c64ec06040d636832e78453f477b7 ]
    
    The commit [7f0973e973cd: ALSA: seq: Fix lockdep warnings due to
    double mutex locks] split the management of two linked lists (source
    and destination) into two individual calls for avoiding the AB/BA
    deadlock.  However, this may leave the possible double deletion of one
    of two lists when the counterpart is being deleted concurrently.
    It ends up with a list corruption, as revealed by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    This patch fixes it by checking the list emptiness and skipping the
    deletion and the following process.

    tracing: Fix freak link error caused by branch tracer
    
    [ Upstream commit b33c8ff4431a343561e2319f17c14286f2aa52e2 ]
    
    In my randconfig tests, I came across a bug that involves several
    components:
    
    * gcc-4.9 through at least 5.3
    * CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL enabling -fprofile-arcs for all files
    * CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES overriding every if()
    * The optimized implementation of do_div() that tries to
      replace a library call with an division by multiplication
    * code in drivers/media/dvb-frontends/zl10353.c doing
    
            u32 adc_clock = 450560; /* 45.056 MHz */
            if (state->config.adc_clock)
                    adc_clock = state->config.adc_clock;
            do_div(value, adc_clock);
    
    In this case, gcc fails to determine whether the divisor
    in do_div() is __builtin_constant_p(). In particular, it
    concludes that __builtin_constant_p(adc_clock) is false, while
    __builtin_constant_p(!!adc_clock) is true.
    
    That in turn throws off the logic in do_div() that also uses
    __builtin_constant_p(), and instead of picking either the
    constant- optimized division, and the code in ilog2() that uses
    __builtin_constant_p() to figure out whether it knows the answer at
    compile time. The result is a link error from failing to find
    multiple symbols that should never have been called based on
    the __builtin_constant_p():
    
    dvb-frontends/zl10353.c:138: undefined reference to `____ilog2_NaN'
    dvb-frontends/zl10353.c:138: undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'
    ERROR: "____ilog2_NaN" [drivers/media/dvb-frontends/zl10353.ko] undefined!
    ERROR: "__aeabi_uldivmod" [drivers/media/dvb-frontends/zl10353.ko] undefined!
    
    This patch avoids the problem by changing __trace_if() to check
    whether the condition is known at compile-time to be nonzero, rather
    than checking whether it is actually a constant.
    
    I see this one link error in roughly one out of 1600 randconfig builds
    on ARM, and the patch fixes all known instances.

    tracepoints: Do not trace when cpu is offline
    
    [ Upstream commit f37755490fe9bf76f6ba1d8c6591745d3574a6a6 ]
    
    The tracepoint infrastructure uses RCU sched protection to enable and
    disable tracepoints safely. There are some instances where tracepoints are
    used in infrastructure code (like kfree()) that get called after a CPU is
    going offline, and perhaps when it is coming back online but hasn't been
    registered yet.
    
    This can probuce the following warning:

    This warning is not a false positive either. RCU is not protecting code that
    is being executed while the CPU is offline.
    
    Instead of playing "whack-a-mole(TM)" and adding conditional statements to
    the tracepoints we find that are used in this instance, simply add a
    cpu_online() test to the tracepoint code where the tracepoint will be
    ignored if the CPU is offline.
    
    Use of raw_smp_processor_id() is fine, as there should never be a case where
    the tracepoint code goes from running on a CPU that is online and suddenly
    gets migrated to a CPU that is offline.

    ALSA: seq: Fix leak of pool buffer at concurrent writes
    
    [ Upstream commit d99a36f4728fcbcc501b78447f625bdcce15b842 ]
    
    When multiple concurrent writes happen on the ALSA sequencer device
    right after the open, it may try to allocate vmalloc buffer for each
    write and leak some of them.  It's because the presence check and the
    assignment of the buffer is done outside the spinlock for the pool.
    
    The fix is to move the check and the assignment into the spinlock.
    
    (The current implementation is suboptimal, as there can be multiple
     unnecessary vmallocs because the allocation is done before the check
     in the spinlock.  But the pool size is already checked beforehand, so
     this isn't a big problem; that is, the only possible path is the
     multiple writes before any pool assignment, and practically seen, the
     current coverage should be "good enough".)
    
    The issue was triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.

    ext4: don't read blocks from disk after extents being swapped
    
    [ Upstream commit bcff24887d00bce102e0857d7b0a8c44a40f53d1 ]
    
    I notice ext4/307 fails occasionally on ppc64 host, reporting md5
    checksum mismatch after moving data from original file to donor file.
    
    The reason is that move_extent_per_page() calls __block_write_begin()
    and block_commit_write() to write saved data from original inode blocks
    to donor inode blocks, but __block_write_begin() not only maps buffer
    heads but also reads block content from disk if the size is not block
    size aligned.  At this time the physical block number in mapped buffer
    head is pointing to the donor file not the original file, and that
    results in reading wrong data to page, which get written to disk in
    following block_commit_write call.
    
    This also can be reproduced by the following script on 1k block size ext4
    on x86_64 host:
    
        mnt=/mnt/ext4
        donorfile=$mnt/donor
        testfile=$mnt/testfile
        e4compact=~/xfstests/src/e4compact
    
        rm -f $donorfile $testfile
    
        # reserve space for donor file, written by 0xaa and sync to disk to
        # avoid EBUSY on EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT
        xfs_io -fc "pwrite -S 0xaa 0 1m" -c "fsync" $donorfile
    
        # create test file written by 0xbb
        xfs_io -fc "pwrite -S 0xbb 0 1023" -c "fsync" $testfile
    
        # compute initial md5sum
        md5sum $testfile | tee md5sum.txt
        # drop cache, force e4compact to read data from disk
        echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    
        # test defrag
        echo "$testfile" | $e4compact -i -v -f $donorfile
        # check md5sum
        md5sum -c md5sum.txt
    
    Fix it by creating & mapping buffer heads only but not reading blocks
    from disk, because all the data in page is guaranteed to be up-to-date
    in mext_page_mkuptodate().

    [ Upstream commit 88c6b61ff1cfb4013a3523227d91ad11b2892388 ]
    
    Xiaoguang Wang has reported sporadic EBUSY failures of ext4/302
    Unfortunetly there is nothing we can do if some other task holds BH's
    refenrence.  So we must return EBUSY in this case.  But we can try
    kicking the journal to see if the other task releases the bh reference
    after the commit is complete.  Also decrease false positives by
    properly checking for ENOSPC and retrying the allocation after kicking
    the journal --- which is done by ext4_should_retry_alloc().

    btrfs: properly set the termination value of ctx->pos in readdir
    
    [ Upstream commit bc4ef7592f657ae81b017207a1098817126ad4cb ]
    
    The value of ctx->pos in the last readdir call is supposed to be set to
    INT_MAX due to 32bit compatibility, unless 'pos' is intentially set to a
    larger value, then it's LLONG_MAX.
    
    There's a report from PaX SIZE_OVERFLOW plugin that "ctx->pos++"
    overflows (https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4284), on a
    64bit arch, where the value is 0x7fffffffffffffff ie. LLONG_MAX before
    the increment.
    
    We can get to that situation like that:
    
    * emit all regular readdir entries
    * still in the same call to readdir, bump the last pos to INT_MAX
    * next call to readdir will not emit any entries, but will reach the
      bump code again, finds pos to be INT_MAX and sets it to LLONG_MAX
    
    Normally this is not a problem, but if we call readdir again, we'll find
    'pos' set to LLONG_MAX and the unconditional increment will overflow.
    
    The report from Victor at
    (http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/49500) with debugging
    print shows that pattern:

    The jump from 7fffffff to 7fffffffffffffff happens when new dir entries
    are not yet synced and are processed from the delayed list. Then the code
    could go to the bump section again even though it might not emit any new
    dir entries from the delayed list.
    
    The fix avoids entering the "bump" section again once we've finished
    emitting the entries, both for synced and delayed entries.

    [ Upstream commit e972c37459c813190461dabfeaac228e00aae259 ]
    
    Since the dawn of time the ICST code has only supported divide
    by one or hang in an eternal loop. Luckily we were always dividing
    by one because the reference frequency for the systems using
    the ICSTs is 24MHz and the [min,max] values for the PLL input
    if [10,320] MHz for ICST307 and [6,200] for ICST525, so the loop
    will always terminate immediately without assigning any divisor
    for the reference frequency.
    
    But for the code to make sense, let's insert the missing i++

    ALSA: timer: Handle disconnection more safely
    
    [ Upstream commit 230323dac060123c340cf75997971145a42661ee ]
    
    Currently ALSA timer device doesn't take the disconnection into
    account very well; it merely unlinks the timer device at disconnection
    callback but does nothing else.  Because of this, when an application
    accessing the timer device is disconnected, it may release the
    resource before actually closed.  In most cases, it results in a
    warning message indicating a leftover timer instance like:
       ALSA: timer xxxx is busy?
    But basically this is an open race.
    
    This patch tries to address it.  The strategy is like other ALSA
    devices: namely,
    - Manage card's refcount at each open/close
    - Wake up the pending tasks at disconnection
    - Check the shutdown flag appropriately at each possible call
    
    Note that this patch has one ugly hack to handle the wakeup of pending
    tasks.  It'd be cleaner to introduce a new disconnect op to
    snd_timer_instance ops.  But since it would lead to internal ABI
    breakage and it eventually increase my own work when backporting to
    stable kernels, I took a different path to implement locally in
    timer.c.  A cleanup patch will follow at next for 4.5 kernel.

    ALSA: timer: Fix race between stop and interrupt
    
    [ Upstream commit ed8b1d6d2c741ab26d60d499d7fbb7ac801f0f51 ]
    
    A slave timer element also unlinks at snd_timer_stop() but it takes
    only slave_active_lock.  When a slave is assigned to a master,
    however, this may become a race against the master's interrupt
    handling, eventually resulting in a list corruption.  The actual bug
    could be seen with a syzkaller fuzzer test case in BugLink below.
    
    As a fix, we need to take timeri->timer->lock when timer isn't NULL,
    i.e. assigned to a master, while the assignment to a master itself is
    protected by slave_active_lock.

    ARM: 8517/1: ICST: avoid arithmetic overflow in icst_hz()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5070fb14a0154f075c8b418e5bc58a620ae85a45 ]
    
    When trying to set the ICST 307 clock to 25174000 Hz I ran into
    this arithmetic error: the icst_hz_to_vco() correctly figure out
    DIVIDE=2, RDW=100 and VDW=99 yielding a frequency of
    25174000 Hz out of the VCO. (I replicated the icst_hz() function
    in a spreadsheet to verify this.)
    
    However, when I called icst_hz() on these VCO settings it would
    instead return 4122709 Hz. This causes an error in the common
    clock driver for ICST as the common clock framework will call
    .round_rate() on the clock which will utilize icst_hz_to_vco()
    followed by icst_hz() suggesting the erroneous frequency, and
    then the clock gets set to this.
    
    The error did not manifest in the old clock framework since
    this high frequency was only used by the CLCD, which calls
    clk_set_rate() without first calling clk_round_rate() and since
    the old clock framework would not call clk_round_rate() before
    setting the frequency, the correct values propagated into
    the VCO.
    
    After some experimenting I figured out that it was due to a simple
    arithmetic overflow: the divisor for 24Mhz reference frequency
    as reference becomes 24000000*2*(99+8)=0x132212400 and the "1"
    in bit 32 overflows and is lost.
    
    But introducing an explicit 64-by-32 bit do_div() and casting
    the divisor into (u64) we get the right frequency back, and the
    right frequency gets set.
    
    Tested on the ARM Versatile.

    ALSA: timer: Fix wrong instance passed to slave callbacks
    
    [ Upstream commit 117159f0b9d392fb433a7871426fad50317f06f7 ]
    
    In snd_timer_notify1(), the wrong timer instance was passed for slave
    ccallback function.  This leads to the access to the wrong data when
    an incompatible master is handled (e.g. the master is the sequencer
    timer and the slave is a user timer), as spotted by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    This patch fixes that wrong assignment.

    ALSA: dummy: Implement timer backend switching more safely
    
    [ Upstream commit ddce57a6f0a2d8d1bfacfa77f06043bc760403c2 ]
    
    Currently the selected timer backend is referred at any moment from
    the running PCM callbacks.  When the backend is switched, it's
    possible to lead to inconsistency from the running backend.  This was
    pointed by syzkaller fuzzer, and the commit [7ee96216c31a: ALSA:
    dummy: Disable switching timer backend via sysfs] disabled the dynamic
    switching for avoiding the crash.
    
    This patch improves the handling of timer backend switching.  It keeps
    the reference to the selected backend during the whole operation of an
    opened stream so that it won't be changed by other streams.
    
    Together with this change, the hrtimer parameter is reenabled as
    writable now.
    
    NOTE: this patch also turned out to fix the still remaining race.
    Namely, ops was still replaced dynamically at dummy_pcm_open:
    
      static int dummy_pcm_open(struct snd_pcm_substream *substream)
      {
      ....
              dummy->timer_ops = &dummy_systimer_ops;
              if (hrtimer)
                      dummy->timer_ops = &dummy_hrtimer_ops;
    
    Since dummy->timer_ops is common among all streams, and when the
    replacement happens during accesses of other streams, it may lead to a
    crash.  This was actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer and KASAN.
    
    This patch rewrites the code not to use the ops shared by all streams
    any longer, too.

    The starting node for a klist iteration is often passed in from
    somewhere way above the klist infrastructure, meaning there's no
    guarantee the node is still on the list.  We've seen this in SCSI where
    we use bus_find_device() to iterate through a list of devices.  In the
    face of heavy hotplug activity, the last device returned by
    bus_find_device() can be removed before the next call.  This leads to

    And an eventual crash. It can actually occur in any hotplug system

    We can fix this globally by making sure the starting node for
    klist_iter_init_node() is actually a member of the list before using it
    (and by starting from the beginning if it isn't).

    pty: make sure super_block is still valid in final /dev/tty close
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f55c718c290616889c04946864a13ef30f64929 ]
    
    Considering current pty code and multiple devpts instances, it's possible
    to umount a devpts file system while a program still has /dev/tty opened
    pointing to a previosuly closed pty pair in that instance. In the case all
    ptmx and pts/N files are closed, umount can be done. If the program closes
    /dev/tty after umount is done, devpts_kill_index will use now an invalid
    super_block, which was already destroyed in the umount operation after
    running ->kill_sb. This is another "use after free" type of issue, but now
    related to the allocated super_block instance.
    
    To avoid the problem (warning at ida_remove and potential crashes) for
    this specific case, I added two functions in devpts which grabs additional
    references to the super_block, which pty code now uses so it makes sure
    the super block structure is still valid until pty shutdown is done.
    I also moved the additional inode references to the same functions, which
    also covered similar case with inode being freed before /dev/tty final
    close/shutdown.

    pty: fix possible use after free of tty->driver_data
    
    [ Upstream commit 2831c89f42dcde440cfdccb9fee9f42d54bbc1ef ]
    
    This change fixes a bug for a corner case where we have the the last
    release from a pty master/slave coming from a previously opened /dev/tty
    file. When this happens, the tty->driver_data can be stale, due to all
    ptmx or pts/N files having already been closed before (and thus the inode
    related to these files, which tty->driver_data points to, being already
    freed/destroyed).
    
    The fix here is to keep a reference on the opened master ptmx inode.
    We maintain the inode referenced until the final pty_unix98_shutdown,
    and only pass this inode to devpts_kill_index.

    To trigger the race run the following loops simultaneously for a while:
      $ while : ; do modprobe aesni-intel; rmmod aesni-intel; done
      $ while : ; do crconf show all > /dev/null; done
    
    Fix the race by taking the crypto_alg_sem read lock, thereby preventing
    crypto_unregister_alg() from modifying the algorithm list during the
    dump.

    ALSA: hda - Fix static checker warning in patch_hdmi.c
    
    [ Upstream commit 360a8245680053619205a3ae10e6bfe624a5da1d ]
    
    The static checker warning is:
    
            sound/pci/hda/patch_hdmi.c:460 hdmi_eld_ctl_get()
            error: __memcpy() 'eld->eld_buffer' too small (256 vs 512)
    
    I have a hard time figuring out if this can ever cause an information leak
    (I don't think so), but nonetheless it does not hurt to increase the
    robustness of the code.

    SCSI: Add Marvell Console to VPD blacklist
    
    [ Upstream commit 82c43310508eb19eb41fe7862e89afeb74030b84 ]
    
    I have a Marvell 88SE9230 SATA Controller that has some sort of
    integrated console SCSI device attached to one of the ports.
    
      ata14: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)
      ata14.00: ATAPI: MARVELL VIRTUALL, 1.09, max UDMA/66
      ata14.00: configured for UDMA/66
      scsi 13:0:0:0: Processor         Marvell  Console 1.01 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
    
    Sending it VPD INQUIRY command seem to always fail with following error:
    
      ata14.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6
      ata14.00: irq_stat 0x40000001
      ata14.00: cmd a0/01:00:00:00:01/00:00:00:00:00/a0 tag 2 dma 16640 in

      ata14: hard resetting link
    
    This has been minor annoyance (only error printed on dmesg) until commit
    09e2b0b14690 ("scsi: rescan VPD attributes") added call to scsi_attach_vpd()
    in scsi_rescan_device(). The commit causes the system to splat out
    following errors continuously without ever reaching the UI:
    
      ata14.00: configured for UDMA/66
      ata14: EH complete
      ata14.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6
      ata14.00: irq_stat 0x40000001

      ata14: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)

      ata14.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6

    Without in-depth understanding of SCSI layer and the Marvell controller,
    I suspect this happens because when the link goes down (because of an
    error) we schedule scsi_rescan_device() which again fails to read VPD
    data... ad infinitum.
    
    Since VPD data cannot be read from the device anyway we prevent the SCSI
    layer from even trying by blacklisting the device. This gets away the
    error and the system starts up normally.

    scsi_dh_rdac: always retry MODE SELECT on command lock violation
    
    [ Upstream commit d2d06d4fe0f2cc2df9b17fefec96e6e1a1271d91 ]
    
    If MODE SELECT returns with sense '05/91/36' (command lock violation)
    it should always be retried without counting the number of retries.
    During an HBA upgrade or similar circumstances one might see a flood
    of MODE SELECT command from various HBAs, which will easily trigger
    the sense code and exceed the retry count.

    This happens because in the code path executed by the inode_paths ioctl we
    end up nesting two calls to read lock a leaf's rwlock when after the first
    call to read_lock() and before the second call to read_lock(), another
    task (running the delayed items as part of a transaction commit) has
    already called write_lock() against the leaf's rwlock. This situation is
    illustrated by the following diagram:
    
             Task A                       Task B
    
      btrfs_ref_to_path()               btrfs_commit_transaction()
        read_lock(&eb->lock);
    
                                          btrfs_run_delayed_items()
                                            __btrfs_commit_inode_delayed_items()
                                              __btrfs_update_delayed_inode()
                                                btrfs_lookup_inode()
    
                                                  write_lock(&eb->lock);
                                                    --> task waits for lock
    
        read_lock(&eb->lock);
        --> makes this task hang
            forever (and task B too
            of course)
    
    So fix this by avoiding doing the nested read lock, which is easily
    avoidable. This issue does not happen if task B calls write_lock() after
    task A does the second call to read_lock(), however there does not seem
    to exist anything in the documentation that mentions what is the expected
    behaviour for recursive locking of rwlocks (leaving the idea that doing
    so is not a good usage of rwlocks).
    
    Also, as a side effect necessary for this fix, make sure we do not
    needlessly read lock extent buffers when the input path has skip_locking
    set (used when called from send).

    target: Fix LUN_RESET active TMR descriptor handling
    
    [ Upstream commit a6d9bb1c9605cd4f44e2d8290dc4d0e88f20292d ]
    
    This patch fixes a NULL pointer se_cmd->cmd_kref < 0
    refcount bug during TMR LUN_RESET with active TMRs,
    triggered during se_cmd + se_tmr_req descriptor
    shutdown + release via core_tmr_drain_tmr_list().
    
    To address this bug, go ahead and obtain a local
    kref_get_unless_zero(&se_cmd->cmd_kref) for active I/O
    to set CMD_T_ABORTED, and transport_wait_for_tasks()
    followed by the final target_put_sess_cmd() to drop
    the local ->cmd_kref.
    
    Also add two new checks within target_tmr_work() to
    avoid CMD_T_ABORTED -> TFO->queue_tm_rsp() callbacks
    ahead of invoking the backend -> fabric put in
    transport_cmd_check_stop_to_fabric().
    
    For good measure, also change core_tmr_release_req()
    to use list_del_init() ahead of se_tmr_req memory
    free.

    [ Upstream commit 5e82d2be6ee53275c72e964507518d7964c82753 ]
    
    While performing hw_free, DPCM checks the BE state but leaves out
    the suspend state. The suspend state needs to be checked as well,
    as we might be suspended and then usermode closes rather than
    resuming the audio stream.
    
    This was found by a stress testing of system with playback in
    loop and killed after few seconds running in background and second
    script running suspend-resume test in loop

    cputime: Prevent 32bit overflow in time[val|spec]_to_cputime()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f26922fe5dc5724b1adbbd54b21bad03590b4f3 ]
    
    The datatype __kernel_time_t is u32 on 32bit platform, so its subject to
    overflows in the timeval/timespec to cputime conversion.
    
    Currently the following functions are affected:
    1. setitimer()
    2. timer_create/timer_settime()
    3. sys_clock_nanosleep
    
    This can happen on MIPS32 and ARM32 with "Full dynticks CPU time accounting"
    enabled, which is required for CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL.
    
    Enforce u64 conversion to prevent the overflow.

    MIPS: Fix buffer overflow in syscall_get_arguments()
    
    [ Upstream commit f4dce1ffd2e30fa31756876ef502ce6d2324be35 ]
    
    Since commit 4c21b8fd8f14 ("MIPS: seccomp: Handle indirect system calls
    (o32)"), syscall_get_arguments() attempts to handle o32 indirect syscall
    arguments by incrementing both the start argument number and the number
    of arguments to fetch. However only the start argument number needs to
    be incremented. The number of arguments does not change, they're just
    shifted up by one, and in fact the output array is provided by the
    caller and is likely only n entries long, so reading more arguments
    overflows the output buffer.
    
    In the case of seccomp, this results in it fetching 7 arguments starting
    at the 2nd one, which overflows the unsigned long args[6] in
    populate_seccomp_data(). This clobbers the $s0 register from
    syscall_trace_enter() which __seccomp_phase1_filter() saved onto the
    stack, into which syscall_trace_enter() had placed its syscall number
    argument. This caused Chromium to crash.
    
    Credit goes to Milko for tracking it down as far as $s0 being clobbered.

    libata: fix sff host state machine locking while polling
    
    [ Upstream commit 8eee1d3ed5b6fc8e14389567c9a6f53f82bb7224 ]
    
    The bulk of ATA host state machine is implemented by
    ata_sff_hsm_move().  The function is called from either the interrupt
    handler or, if polling, a work item.  Unlike from the interrupt path,
    the polling path calls the function without holding the host lock and
    ata_sff_hsm_move() selectively grabs the lock.
    
    This is completely broken.  If an IRQ triggers while polling is in
    progress, the two can easily race and end up accessing the hardware
    and updating state machine state at the same time.  This can put the
    state machine in an illegal state and lead to a crash like the
    following.

    qla2xxx: terminate exchange when command is aborted by LIO
    
    [ Upstream commit 7359df25a53386dd33c223672bbd12cb49d0ce4f ]
    
    The newly introduced aborted_task TFO callback has to terminate
    exchange with QLogic driver, since command is being deleted and
    no status will be queued to the driver at a later point.
    
    This patch also moves the burden of releasing one cmd refcount to
    the aborted_task handler.
    
    Changed iSCSI aborted_task logic to satisfy the above requirement.

    qla2xxx: added sess generations to detect RSCN update races
    
    [ Upstream commit df673274fa4896f25f0bf348d2a3535d74b4cbec ]
    
    RSCN processing in qla2xxx driver can run in parallel with ELS/IO
    processing. As such the decision to remove disappeared fc port's
    session could be stale, because a new login sequence has occurred
    since and created a brand new session.
    
    Previous mechanism of dealing with this by delaying deletion request
    was prone to erroneous deletions if the event that was supposed to
    cancel the deletion never arrived or has been delayed in processing.
    
    New mechanism relies on a time-like generation counter to serialize
    RSCN updates relative to ELS/IO updates.

    If a new initiator (different WWN) shows up on the same fcport, old

    [ Upstream commit a6ca88780dd66b0700d89419abd17b6b4bb49483 ]
    
    - keep qla_tgt_sess object on the session list until it's freed
    
    - modify use of sess->deleted flag to differentiate delayed
      session deletion that can be cancelled from irreversible one:
      QLA_SESS_DELETION_PENDING vs QLA_SESS_DELETION_IN_PROGRESS
    
    - during IN_PROGRESS deletion all newly arrived commands and TMRs will
      be rejected, existing commands and TMRs will be terminated when
      given by the core to the fabric or simply dropped if session logout
      has already happened (logout terminates all existing exchanges)
    
    - new PLOGI will initiate deletion of the following sessions
      (unless deletion is already IN_PROGRESS):
      - with the same port_name (with logout)
      - different port_name, different loop_id but the same port_id
        (with logout)
      - different port_name, different port_id, but the same loop_id
        (without logout)
    
    - additionally each new PLOGI will store imm notify iocb in the
      same port_name session being deleted. When deletion process
      completes this iocb will be acked. Only the most recent PLOGI
      iocb is stored. The older ones will be terminated when replaced.
    
    - new PRLI will initiate deletion of the following sessions
      (unless deletion is already IN_PROGRESS):
      - different port_name, different port_id, but the same loop_id
       (without logout)

    qla2xxx: cleanup cmd in qla workqueue before processing TMR
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b2f5ff3d05c2c48b722c3cc67b8226f1601042b ]
    
    Since cmds go into qla_tgt_wq and TMRs don't, it's possible that TMR
    like TASK_ABORT can be queued over the cmd for which it was meant.
    To avoid this race, use a per-port list to keep track of cmds that
    are enqueued to qla_tgt_wq but not yet processed. When a TMR arrives,
    iterate through this list and remove any cmds that match the TMR.
    This patch supports TASK_ABORT and LUN_RESET.

    qla2xxx: kill sessions/log out initiator on RSCN and port down events
    
    [ Upstream commit de60f552147f87956aa3a56ecb410e4f583dc99d ]
    
    commit b2032fd567326ad0b2d443bb6d96d2580ec670a5 upstream.
    
    To fix some issues talking to ESX, this patch modifies the qla2xxx driver
    so that it never logs into remote ports.  This has the side effect of
    getting rid of the "rports" entirely, which means we never log out of
    initiators and never tear down sessions when an initiator goes away.
    
    This is mostly OK, except that we can run into trouble if we have
    initiator A assigned FC address X:Y:Z by the fabric talking to us, and
    then initiator A goes away.  Some time (could be a long time) later,
    initiator B comes along and also gets FC address X:Y:Z (which is
    available again, because initiator A is gone).  If initiator B starts
    talking to us, then we'll still have the session for initiator A, and
    since we look up incoming IO based on the FC address X:Y:Z, initiator B
    will end up using ACLs for initiator A.
    
    Fix this by:
    
     1. Handling RSCN events somewhat differently; instead of completely
        skipping the processing of fcports, we look through the list, and if
        an fcport disappears, we tell the target code the tear down the
        session and tell the HBA FW to release the N_Port handle.
    
     2. Handling "port down" events by flushing all of our sessions.  The
        firmware was already releasing the N_Port handle but we want the
        target code to drop all the sessions too.

    ports in those cases.  This hasn't mattered but with the new nvme

    be honored.

    PCI/AER: Flush workqueue on device remove to avoid use-after-free
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ae2182b1e3407de369f8c5d799543b7db74221b ]
    
    A Root Port's AER structure (rpc) contains a queue of events.  aer_irq()
    enqueues AER status information and schedules aer_isr() to dequeue and
    process it.  When we remove a device, aer_remove() waits for the queue to
    be empty, then frees the rpc struct.
    
    But aer_isr() references the rpc struct after dequeueing and possibly
    emptying the queue, which can cause a use-after-free error as in the
    following scenario with two threads, aer_isr() on the left and a
    concurrent aer_remove() on the right:
    
      Thread A                      Thread B
      --------                      --------
      aer_irq():
        rpc->prod_idx++
                                    aer_remove():
                                      wait_event(rpc->prod_idx == rpc->cons_idx)
                                      # now blocked until queue becomes empty
      aer_isr():                      # ...
        rpc->cons_idx++               # unblocked because queue is now empty
        ...                           kfree(rpc)
        mutex_unlock(&rpc->rpc_mutex)
    
    To prevent this problem, use flush_work() to wait until the last scheduled
    instance of aer_isr() has completed before freeing the rpc struct in
    aer_remove().
    
    I reproduced this use-after-free by flashing a device FPGA and
    re-enumerating the bus to find the new device.  With SLUB debug, this
    crashes with 0x6b bytes (POISON_FREE, the use-after-free magic number) in
    GPR25:

    qla2xxx: fix busy wait regression
    
    [ Upstream commit 975f7d467480a11864d71a10dee908b83c5e682b ]
    
    Commit e05fe29248 (qla2xxx: Honor FCP_RSP retry delay timer field.)
    causes systems to busy-wait for about 3 minutes after boot prior to
    detecting SAN disks.
    
    During this wait period one kworker is running full-time
    (though /proc/<pid>/stack has no useful data). Another kworker is
    waiting for IO to complete during that whole time period.
    
    Looking at drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_os.c, fcport->retry_delay_timestamp
    has a special value of 0 though that 0 value forces system to wait when
    jiffies is very large value (e.g. 4294952605 - "negative" value when
    signed on 32bit systems).
