    scsi: lpfc: fix inlining of lpfc_sli4_cleanup_poll_list()
    
    [ Upstream commit d480e57809a043333a3b9e755c0bdd43e10a9f12 ]
    
    Compilation can fail due to having an inline function reference where the
    function body is not present.
    
    Fix by removing the inline tag.

    The commit 0d6defc7e0e4 ("ASoC: stm32: sai: manage rebind issue")
    converts some function calls to their non-devm equivalents.  The
    appropriate cleanup code was added to the remove function, but not
    to the probe function.  Add a call to snd_dmaengine_pcm_unregister
    to compensate for the call to snd_dmaengine_pcm_register in case
    of subsequent failure.

    bpf: Fix tnum constraints for 32-bit comparisons
    
    [ Upstream commit 604dca5e3af1db98bd123b7bfc02b017af99e3a0 ]
    
    The BPF verifier tried to track values based on 32-bit comparisons by
    (ab)using the tnum state via 581738a681b6 ("bpf: Provide better register
    bounds after jmp32 instructions"). The idea is that after a check like
    this:
    
        if ((u32)r0 > 3)
          exit
    
    We can't meaningfully constrain the arithmetic-range-based tracking, but
    we can update the tnum state to (value=0,mask=0xffff'ffff'0000'0003).
    However, the implementation from 581738a681b6 didn't compute the tnum
    constraint based on the fixed operand, but instead derives it from the
    arithmetic-range-based tracking. This means that after the following
    sequence of operations:
    
        if (r0 >= 0x1'0000'0001)
          exit
        if ((u32)r0 > 7)
          exit
    
    The verifier assumed that the lower half of r0 is in the range (0, 0)
    and apply the tnum constraint (value=0,mask=0xffff'ffff'0000'0000) thus
    causing the overall tnum to be (value=0,mask=0x1'0000'0000), which was
    incorrect. Provide a fixed implementation.

    drm/dp_mst: Fix clearing payload state on topology disable
    
    [ Upstream commit 8732fe46b20c951493bfc4dba0ad08efdf41de81 ]
    
    The issues caused by:
    
    commit 64e62bdf04ab ("drm/dp_mst: Remove VCPI while disabling topology
    mgr")
    
    Prompted me to take a closer look at how we clear the payload state in
    general when disabling the topology, and it turns out there's actually
    two subtle issues here.
    
    The first is that we're not grabbing &mgr.payload_lock when clearing the
    payloads in drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(). Seeing as the canonical
    lock order is &mgr.payload_lock -> &mgr.lock (because we always want
    &mgr.lock to be the inner-most lock so topology validation always
    works), this makes perfect sense. It also means that -technically- there
    could be racing between someone calling
    drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst() to disable the topology, along with a
    modeset occurring that's modifying the payload state at the same time.
    
    The second is the more obvious issue that Wayne Lin discovered, that
    we're not clearing proposed_payloads when disabling the topology.
    
    I actually can't see any obvious places where the racing caused by the
    first issue would break something, and it could be that some of our
    higher-level locks already prevent this by happenstance, but better safe
    then sorry. So, let's make it so that drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst()
    first grabs &mgr.payload_lock followed by &mgr.lock so that we never
    race when modifying the payload state. Then, we also clear
    proposed_payloads to fix the original issue of enabling a new topology
    with a dirty payload state. This doesn't clear any of the drm_dp_vcpi
    structures, but those are getting destroyed along with the ports anyway.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Use sizeof(mgr->payloads[0])/sizeof(mgr->proposed_vcpis[0]) instead -

    scsi: lpfc: Fix broken Credit Recovery after driver load
    
    [ Upstream commit 835214f5d5f516a38069bc077c879c7da00d6108 ]
    
    When driver is set to enable bb credit recovery, the switch displayed the
    setting as inactive.  If the link bounces, it switches to Active.
    
    During link up processing, the driver currently does a MBX_READ_SPARAM
    followed by a MBX_CONFIG_LINK. These mbox commands are queued to be
    executed, one at a time and the completion is processed by the worker
    thread.  Since the MBX_READ_SPARAM is done BEFORE the MBX_CONFIG_LINK, the
    BB_SC_N bit is never set the the returned values. BB Credit recovery status
    only gets set after the driver requests the feature in CONFIG_LINK, which
    is done after the link up. Thus the ordering of READ_SPARAM needs to follow
    the CONFIG_LINK.
    
    Fix by reordering so that READ_SPARAM is done after CONFIG_LINK.  Added a
    HBA_DEFER_FLOGI flag so that any FLOGI handling waits until after the
    READ_SPARAM is done so that the proper BB credit value is set in the FLOGI
    payload.

    [ Upstream commit 6bfb1620829825c01e1dcdd63b6a7700352babd9 ]
    
    The driver today is reading service parameters from the firmware and then
    overwriting the firmware-provided values with values of its own.  There are
    some switch features that require preliminary FLOGI's that are
    switch-specific and done prior to the actual fabric FLOGI for traffic.  The
    fw will perform those FLOGIs and will revise the service parameters for the
    features configured. As the driver later overwrites those values with its
    own values, it misconfigures things like BBSCN use by doing so.
    
    Correct by eliminating the driver-overwrite of firmware values. The driver
    correctly re-reads the service parameters after each link up to obtain the
    latest values from firmware.

    scsi: lpfc: Fix Fabric hostname registration if system hostname changes
    
    [ Upstream commit e3ba04c9bad1d1c7f15df43da25e878045150777 ]
    
    There are reports of multiple ports on the same system displaying different
    hostnames in fabric FDMI displays.
    
    Currently, the driver registers the hostname at initialization and obtains
    the hostname via init_utsname()->nodename queried at the time the FC link
    comes up. Unfortunately, if the machine hostname is updated after
    initialization, such as via DHCP or admin command, the value registered
    initially will be incorrect.
    
    Fix by having the driver save the hostname that was registered with FDMI.
    The driver then runs a heartbeat action that will check the hostname.  If
    the name changes, reregister the FMDI data.
    
    The hostname is used in RSNN_NN, FDMI RPA and FDMI RHBA.

    scsi: lpfc: Add registration for CPU Offline/Online events
    
    [ Upstream commit 93a4d6f40198dffcca35d9a928c409f9290f1fe0 ]
    
    The recent affinitization didn't address cpu offlining/onlining.  If an
    interrupt vector is shared and the low order cpu owning the vector is
    offlined, as interrupts are managed, the vector is taken offline. This
    causes the other CPUs sharing the vector will hang as they can't get io
    completions.
    
    Correct by registering callbacks with the system for Offline/Online
    events. When a cpu is taken offline, its eq, which is tied to an interrupt
    vector is found. If the cpu is the "owner" of the vector and if the
    eq/vector is shared by other CPUs, the eq is placed into a polled mode.
    Additionally, code paths that perform io submission on the "sharing CPUs"
    will check the eq state and poll for completion after submission of new io
    to a wq that uses the eq.
    
    Similarly, when a cpu comes back online and owns an offlined vector, the eq
    is taken out of polled mode and rearmed to start driving interrupts for eq.

    dm clone: Fix handling of partial region discards
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b5142905d4ff58a4b93f7c8eaa7ba829c0a53c9 ]
    
    There is a bug in the way dm-clone handles discards, which can lead to
    discarding the wrong blocks or trying to discard blocks beyond the end
    of the device.
    
    This could lead to data corruption, if the destination device indeed
    discards the underlying blocks, i.e., if the discard operation results
    in the original contents of a block to be lost.
    
    The root of the problem is the code that calculates the range of regions
    covered by a discard request and decides which regions to discard.
    
    Since dm-clone handles the device in units of regions, we don't discard
    parts of a region, only whole regions.
    
    The range is calculated as:
    
        rs = dm_sector_div_up(bio->bi_iter.bi_sector, clone->region_size);
        re = bio_end_sector(bio) >> clone->region_shift;
    
    , where 'rs' is the first region to discard and (re - rs) is the number
    of regions to discard.
    
    The bug manifests when we try to discard part of a single region, i.e.,
    when we try to discard a block with size < region_size, and the discard
    request both starts at an offset with respect to the beginning of that
    region and ends before the end of the region.
    
    The root cause is the following comparison:
    
      if (rs == re)
        // skip discard and complete original bio immediately
    
    , which doesn't take into account that 'rs' might be greater than 're'.
    
    Thus, we then issue a discard request for the wrong blocks, instead of
    skipping the discard all together.
    
    Fix the check to also take into account the above case, so we don't end
    up discarding the wrong blocks.
    
    Also, add some range checks to dm_clone_set_region_hydrated() and
    dm_clone_cond_set_range(), which update dm-clone's region bitmap.
    
    Note that the aforementioned bug doesn't cause invalid memory accesses,
    because dm_clone_is_range_hydrated() returns True for this case, so the
    checks are just precautionary.

    arm64: Always force a branch protection mode when the compiler has one
    
    commit b8fdef311a0bd9223f10754f94fdcf1a594a3457 upstream.
    
    Compilers with branch protection support can be configured to enable it by
    default, it is likely that distributions will do this as part of deploying
    branch protection system wide. As well as the slight overhead from having
    some extra NOPs for unused branch protection features this can cause more
    serious problems when the kernel is providing pointer authentication to
    userspace but not built for pointer authentication itself. In that case our
    switching of keys for userspace can affect the kernel unexpectedly, causing
    pointer authentication instructions in the kernel to corrupt addresses.
    
    To ensure that we get consistent and reliable behaviour always explicitly
    initialise the branch protection mode, ensuring that the kernel is built
    the same way regardless of the compiler defaults.
    
    [This is a reworked version of b8fdef311a0bd9223f1075 ("arm64: Always
    force a branch protection mode when the compiler has one") for backport.
    Kernels prior to 74afda4016a7 ("arm64: compile the kernel with ptrauth
    return address signing") don't have any Makefile machinery for forcing
    on pointer auth but still have issues if the compiler defaults it on so
    need this reworked version. -- broonie]

    powerpc: Make setjmp/longjmp signature standard
    
    commit c17eb4dca5a353a9dbbb8ad6934fe57af7165e91 upstream.
    
    Declaring setjmp()/longjmp() as taking longs makes the signature
    non-standard, and makes clang complain. In the past, this has been
    worked around by adding -ffreestanding to the compile flags.
    
    The implementation looks like it only ever propagates the value
    (in longjmp) or sets it to 1 (in setjmp), and we only call longjmp
    with integer parameters.
    
    This allows removing -ffreestanding from the compilation flags.

    scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic observed on soft HBA unplug
    
    commit cc41f11a21a51d6869d71e525a7264c748d7c0d7 upstream.
    
    Generic protection fault type kernel panic is observed when user performs
    soft (ordered) HBA unplug operation while IOs are running on drives
    connected to HBA.
    
    When user performs ordered HBA removal operation, the kernel calls PCI
    device's .remove() call back function where driver is flushing out all the
    outstanding SCSI IO commands with DID_NO_CONNECT host byte and also unmaps
    sg buffers allocated for these IO commands.
    
    However, in the ordered HBA removal case (unlike of real HBA hot removal),
    HBA device is still alive and hence HBA hardware is performing the DMA
    operations to those buffers on the system memory which are already unmapped
    while flushing out the outstanding SCSI IO commands and this leads to
    kernel panic.
    
    Don't flush out the outstanding IOs from .remove() path in case of ordered
    removal since HBA will be still alive in this case and it can complete the
    outstanding IOs. Flush out the outstanding IOs only in case of 'physical
    HBA hot unplug' where there won't be any communication with the HBA.
    
    During shutdown also it is possible that HBA hardware can perform DMA
    operations on those outstanding IO buffers which are completed with
    DID_NO_CONNECT by the driver from .shutdown(). So same above fix is applied
    in shutdown path as well.
    
    It is safe to drop the outstanding commands when HBA is inaccessible such
    as when permanent PCI failure happens, when HBA is in non-operational

    knows that HBA is inaccessible during these cases, it is safe to drop the

    and clear these outstanding commands.

    powerpc/64: Prevent stack protection in early boot
    
    commit 7053f80d96967d8e72e9f2a724bbfc3906ce2b07 upstream.
    
    The previous commit reduced the amount of code that is run before we
    setup a paca. However there are still a few remaining functions that
    run with no paca, or worse, with an arbitrary value in r13 that will
    be used as a paca pointer.
    
    In particular the stack protector canary is stored in the paca, so if
    stack protector is activated for any of these functions we will read
    the stack canary from wherever r13 points. If r13 happens to point
    outside of memory we will get a machine check / checkstop.
    
    For example if we modify initialise_paca() to trigger stack
    protection, and then boot in the mambo simulator with r13 poisoned in
    skiboot before calling the kernel:

    powerpc/64: Setup a paca before parsing device tree etc.
    
    commit d4a8e98621543d5798421eed177978bf2b3cdd11 upstream.
    
    Currently we set up the paca after parsing the device tree for CPU
    features. Prior to that, r13 contains random data, which means there
    is random data in r13 while we're running the generic dt parsing code.
    
    This random data varies depending on whether we boot through a vmlinux
    or a zImage: for the vmlinux case it's usually around zero, but for
    zImages we see random values like 912a72603d420015.
    
    This is poor practice, and can also lead to difficult-to-debug
    crashes. For example, when kcov is enabled, the kcov instrumentation
    attempts to read preempt_count out of the current task, which goes via
    the paca. This then crashes in the zImage case.
    
    Similarly stack protector can cause crashes if r13 is bogus, by
    reading from the stack canary in the paca.
    
    To resolve this:
    
     - move the paca setup to before the CPU feature parsing.
    
     - because we no longer have access to CPU feature flags in paca
     setup, change the HV feature test in the paca setup path to consider
     the actual value of the MSR rather than the CPU feature.
    
    Translations get switched on once we leave early_setup, so I think
    we'd already catch any other cases where the paca or task aren't set
    up.
    
    Boot tested on a P9 guest and host.

    powerpc/xive: Use XIVE_BAD_IRQ instead of zero to catch non configured IPIs
    
    commit b1a504a6500df50e83b701b7946b34fce27ad8a3 upstream.
    
    When a CPU is brought up, an IPI number is allocated and recorded
    under the XIVE CPU structure. Invalid IPI numbers are tracked with
    interrupt number 0x0.
    
    On the PowerNV platform, the interrupt number space starts at 0x10 and
    this works fine. However, on the sPAPR platform, it is possible to
    allocate the interrupt number 0x0 and this raises an issue when CPU 0
    is unplugged. The XIVE spapr driver tracks allocated interrupt numbers
    in a bitmask and it is not correctly updated when interrupt number 0x0
    is freed. It stays allocated and it is then impossible to reallocate.
    
    Fix by using the XIVE_BAD_IRQ value instead of zero on both platforms.

    powerpc/hash64/devmap: Use H_PAGE_THP_HUGE when setting up huge devmap PTE entries
    
    commit 36b78402d97a3b9aeab136feb9b00d8647ec2c20 upstream.
    
    H_PAGE_THP_HUGE is used to differentiate between a THP hugepage and
    hugetlb hugepage entries. The difference is WRT how we handle hash
    fault on these address. THP address enables MPSS in segments. We want
    to manage devmap hugepage entries similar to THP pt entries. Hence use
    H_PAGE_THP_HUGE for devmap huge PTE entries.
    
    With current code while handling hash PTE fault, we do set is_thp =
    true when finding devmap PTE huge PTE entries.
    
    Current code also does the below sequence we setting up huge devmap
    entries.
    
            entry = pmd_mkhuge(pfn_t_pmd(pfn, prot));
            if (pfn_t_devmap(pfn))
                    entry = pmd_mkdevmap(entry);
    
    In that case we would find both H_PAGE_THP_HUGE and PAGE_DEVMAP set
    for huge devmap PTE entries. This results in false positive error like
    below.

    powerpc/64/tm: Don't let userspace set regs->trap via sigreturn
    
    commit c7def7fbdeaa25feaa19caf4a27c5d10bd8789e4 upstream.
    
    In restore_tm_sigcontexts() we take the trap value directly from the
    user sigcontext with no checking:
    
            err |= __get_user(regs->trap, &sc->gp_regs[PT_TRAP]);
    
    This means we can be in the kernel with an arbitrary regs->trap value.
    
    Although that's not immediately problematic, there is a risk we could
    trigger one of the uses of CHECK_FULL_REGS():
    
            #define CHECK_FULL_REGS(regs)   BUG_ON(regs->trap & 1)
    
    It can also cause us to unnecessarily save non-volatile GPRs again in
    save_nvgprs(), which shouldn't be problematic but is still wrong.
    
    It's also possible it could trick the syscall restart machinery, which
    relies on regs->trap not being == 0xc00 (see 9a81c16b5275 ("powerpc:
    fix double syscall restarts")), though I haven't been able to make
    that happen.
    
    Finally it doesn't match the behaviour of the non-TM case, in
    restore_sigcontext() which zeroes regs->trap.
    
    So change restore_tm_sigcontexts() to zero regs->trap.
    
    This was discovered while testing Nick's upcoming rewrite of the
    syscall entry path. In that series the call to save_nvgprs() prior to
    signal handling (do_notify_resume()) is removed, which leaves the
    low-bit of regs->trap uncleared which can then trigger the FULL_REGS()
    WARNs in setup_tm_sigcontexts().

    xen/blkfront: fix memory allocation flags in blkfront_setup_indirect()
    
    commit 3a169c0be75b59dd85d159493634870cdec6d3c4 upstream.
    
    Commit 1d5c76e664333 ("xen-blkfront: switch kcalloc to kvcalloc for
    large array allocation") didn't fix the issue it was meant to, as the
    flags for allocating the memory are GFP_NOIO, which will lead the
    memory allocation falling back to kmalloc().
    
    So instead of GFP_NOIO use GFP_KERNEL and do all the memory allocation
    in blkfront_setup_indirect() in a memalloc_noio_{save,restore} section.

    ipmi: fix hung processes in __get_guid()
    
    commit 32830a0534700f86366f371b150b17f0f0d140d7 upstream.
    
    The wait_event() function is used to detect command completion.
    When send_guid_cmd() returns an error, smi_send() has not been
    called to send data. Therefore, wait_event() should not be used
    on the error path, otherwise it will cause the following warning:

    hfsplus: fix crash and filesystem corruption when deleting files
    
    commit 25efb2ffdf991177e740b2f63e92b4ec7d310a92 upstream.
    
    When removing files containing extended attributes, the hfsplus driver may
    remove the wrong entries from the attributes b-tree, causing major
    filesystem damage and in some cases even kernel crashes.
    
    To remove a file, all its extended attributes have to be removed as well.
    The driver does this by looking up all keys in the attributes b-tree with
    the cnid of the file.  Each of these entries then gets deleted using the
    key used for searching, which doesn't contain the attribute's name when it
    should.  Since the key doesn't contain the name, the deletion routine will
    not find the correct entry and instead remove the one in front of it.  If
    parent nodes have to be modified, these become corrupt as well.  This
    causes invalid links and unsorted entries that not even macOS's fsck_hfs
    is able to fix.
    
    To fix this, modify the search key before an entry is deleted from the
    attributes b-tree by copying the found entry's key into the search key,
    therefore ensuring that the correct entry gets removed from the tree.

    cpufreq: powernv: Fix use-after-free
    
    commit d0a72efac89d1c35ac55197895201b7b94c5e6ef upstream.
    
    The cpufreq driver has a use-after-free that we can hit if:
    
    a) There's an OCC message pending when the notifier is registered, and
    b) The cpufreq driver fails to register with the core.
    
    When a) occurs the notifier schedules a workqueue item to handle the
    message. The backing work_struct is located on chips[].throttle and
    when b) happens we clean up by freeing the array. Once we get to
    the (now free) queued item and the kernel crashes.

    kmod: make request_module() return an error when autoloading is disabled
    
    commit d7d27cfc5cf0766a26a8f56868c5ad5434735126 upstream.
    
    Patch series "module autoloading fixes and cleanups", v5.
    
    This series fixes a bug where request_module() was reporting success to
    kernel code when module autoloading had been completely disabled via
    'echo > /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe'.
    
    It also addresses the issues raised on the original thread
    (https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20200310223731.126894-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u)
    bydocumenting the modprobe sysctl, adding a self-test for the empty path
    case, and downgrading a user-reachable WARN_ONCE().
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    It's long been possible to disable kernel module autoloading completely
    (while still allowing manual module insertion) by setting
    /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe to the empty string.
    
    This can be preferable to setting it to a nonexistent file since it
    avoids the overhead of an attempted execve(), avoids potential
    deadlocks, and avoids the call to security_kernel_module_request() and
    thus on SELinux-based systems eliminates the need to write SELinux rules
    to dontaudit module_request.
    
    However, when module autoloading is disabled in this way,
    request_module() returns 0.  This is broken because callers expect 0 to
    mean that the module was successfully loaded.
    
    Apparently this was never noticed because this method of disabling
    module autoloading isn't used much, and also most callers don't use the
    return value of request_module() since it's always necessary to check
    whether the module registered its functionality or not anyway.
    
    But improperly returning 0 can indeed confuse a few callers, for example
    get_fs_type() in fs/filesystems.c where it causes a WARNING to be hit:
    
            if (!fs && (request_module("fs-%.*s", len, name) == 0)) {
                    fs = __get_fs_type(name, len);
                    WARN_ONCE(!fs, "request_module fs-%.*s succeeded, but still no fs?\n", len, name);
            }
    
    This is easily reproduced with:
    
            echo > /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe
            mount -t NONEXISTENT none /
    
    It causes:
    
            request_module fs-NONEXISTENT succeeded, but still no fs?
            WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1106 at fs/filesystems.c:275 get_fs_type+0xd6/0xf0
            [...]
    
    This should actually use pr_warn_once() rather than WARN_ONCE(), since
    it's also user-reachable if userspace immediately unloads the module.
    Regardless, request_module() should correctly return an error when it
    fails.  So let's make it return -ENOENT, which matches the error when
    the modprobe binary doesn't exist.
    
    I've also sent patches to document and test this case.

    commit ebc68cedec4aead47d8d11623d013cca9bf8e825 upstream.
    
    The Acer Aspire 5738z has a button to disable (and re-enable) the
    touchpad next to the touchpad.
    
    When this button is pressed a LED underneath indicates that the touchpad
    is disabled (and an event is send to userspace and GNOME shows its
    touchpad enabled / disable OSD thingie).
    
    So far so good, but after re-enabling the touchpad it no longer works.
    
    The laptop does not have an external ps2 port, so mux mode is not needed
    and disabling mux mode fixes the touchpad no longer working after toggling
    it off and back on again, so lets add this laptop model to the nomux list.

    perf tools: Support Python 3.8+ in Makefile
    
    commit b9c9ce4e598e012ca7c1813fae2f4d02395807de upstream.
    
    Python 3.8 changed the output of 'python-config --ldflags' to no longer
    include the '-lpythonX.Y' flag (this apparently fixed an issue loading
    modules with a statically linked Python executable).  The libpython
    feature check in linux/build/feature fails if the Python library is not
    included in FEATURE_CHECK_LDFLAGS-libpython variable.
    
    This adds a check in the Makefile to determine if PYTHON_CONFIG accepts
    the '--embed' flag and passes that flag alongside '--ldflags' if so.
    
    tools/perf is the only place the libpython feature check is used.

    ocfs2: no need try to truncate file beyond i_size
    
    commit 783fda856e1034dee90a873f7654c418212d12d7 upstream.
    
    Linux fallocate(2) with FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE mode set, its offset can
    exceed the inode size.  Ocfs2 now doesn't allow that offset beyond inode
    size.  This restriction is not necessary and violates fallocate(2)
    semantics.
    
    If fallocate(2) offset is beyond inode size, just return success and do
    nothing further.
    
    Otherwise, ocfs2 will crash the kernel.

    fs/filesystems.c: downgrade user-reachable WARN_ONCE() to pr_warn_once()
    
    commit 26c5d78c976ca298e59a56f6101a97b618ba3539 upstream.
    
    After request_module(), nothing is stopping the module from being
    unloaded until someone takes a reference to it via try_get_module().
    
    The WARN_ONCE() in get_fs_type() is thus user-reachable, via userspace
    running 'rmmod' concurrently.
    
    Since WARN_ONCE() is for kernel bugs only, not for user-reachable
    situations, downgrade this warning to pr_warn_once().
    
    Keep it printed once only, since the intent of this warning is to detect
    a bug in modprobe at boot time.  Printing the warning more than once
    wouldn't really provide any useful extra information.

    Taking closer look at the code, I can see that for_each_drmem_lmb is a
    macro expanding into `for (lmb = &drmem_info->lmbs[0]; lmb <=
    &drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs - 1]; lmb++)`. When drmem_info->lmbs
    is NULL, the loop would iterate through the whole address range if it
    weren't stopped by the NULL pointer dereference on the next line.
    
    This patch aligns for_each_drmem_lmb and for_each_drmem_lmb_in_range
    macro behavior with the common C semantics, where the end marker does
    not belong to the scanned range, and alters get_lmb_range() semantics.
    As a side effect, the wraparound observed in the crash is prevented.

    it has been illegal to combine GFP_COMP with SetPageReserved, so lets
    stop doing both and leave the dma layer to its own devices.

    vfio: platform: Switch to platform_get_irq_optional()
    
    commit 723fe298ad85ad1278bd2312469ad14738953cc6 upstream.
    
    Since commit 7723f4c5ecdb ("driver core: platform: Add an error
    message to platform_get_irq*()"), platform_get_irq() calls dev_err()
    on an error. As we enumerate all interrupts until platform_get_irq()
    fails, we now systematically get a message such as:
    "vfio-platform fff51000.ethernet: IRQ index 3 not found" which is
    a false positive.
    
    Let's use platform_get_irq_optional() instead.

    selftests: vm: drop dependencies on page flags from mlock2 tests
    
    commit eea274d64e6ea8aff2224d33d0851133a84cc7b5 upstream.
    
    It was noticed that mlock2 tests are failing after 9c4e6b1a7027f ("mm,
    mlock, vmscan: no more skipping pagevecs") because the patch has changed
    the timing on when the page is added to the unevictable LRU list and thus
    gains the unevictable page flag.
    
    The test was just too dependent on the implementation details which were
    true at the time when it was introduced.  Page flags and the timing when
    they are set is something no userspace should ever depend on.  The test
    should be testing only for the user observable contract of the tested
    syscalls.  Those are defined pretty well for the mlock and there are other
    means for testing them.  In fact this is already done and testing for page
    flags can be safely dropped to achieve the aimed purpose.  Present bits
    can be checked by /proc/<pid>/smaps RSS field and the locking state by
    VmFlags although I would argue that Locked: field would be more
    appropriate.
    
    Drop all the page flag machinery and considerably simplify the test.  This
    should be more robust for future kernel changes while checking the
    promised contract is still valid.

    arm64: armv8_deprecated: Fix undef_hook mask for thumb setend
    
    commit fc2266011accd5aeb8ebc335c381991f20e26e33 upstream.
    
    For thumb instructions, call_undef_hook() in traps.c first reads a u16,
    and if the u16 indicates a T32 instruction (u16 >= 0xe800), a second
    u16 is read, which then makes up the the lower half-word of a T32
    instruction. For T16 instructions, the second u16 is not read,
    which makes the resulting u32 opcode always have the upper half set to
    0.
    
    However, having the upper half of instr_mask in the undef_hook set to 0
    masks out the upper half of all thumb instructions - both T16 and T32.
    This results in trapped T32 instructions with the lower half-word equal
    to the T16 encoding of setend (b650) being matched, even though the upper
    half-word is not 0000 and thus indicates a T32 opcode.
    
    An example of such a T32 instruction is eaa0b650, which should raise a
    SIGILL since T32 instructions with an eaa prefix are unallocated as per
    Arm ARM, but instead works as a SETEND because the second half-word is set
    to b650.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by extending instr_mask to include the
    upper u32 half, which will still match T16 instructions where the upper
    half is 0, but not T32 instructions.

    scsi: zfcp: fix missing erp_lock in port recovery trigger for point-to-point
    
    commit 819732be9fea728623e1ed84eba28def7384ad1f upstream.
    
    v2.6.27 commit cc8c282963bd ("[SCSI] zfcp: Automatically attach remote
    ports") introduced zfcp automatic port scan.
    
    Before that, the user had to use the sysfs attribute "port_add" of an FCP
    device (adapter) to add and open remote (target) ports, even for the remote
    peer port in point-to-point topology. That code path did a proper port open
    recovery trigger taking the erp_lock.
    
    Since above commit, a new helper function zfcp_erp_open_ptp_port()
    performed an UNlocked port open recovery trigger. This can race with other
    parallel recovery triggers. In zfcp_erp_action_enqueue() this could corrupt
    e.g. adapter->erp_total_count or adapter->erp_ready_head.
    
    As already found for fabric topology in v4.17 commit fa89adba1941 ("scsi:
    zfcp: fix infinite iteration on ERP ready list"), there was an endless loop
    during tracing of rport (un)block.  A subsequent v4.18 commit 9e156c54ace3
    ("scsi: zfcp: assert that the ERP lock is held when tracing a recovery
    trigger") introduced a lockdep assertion for that case.
    
    As a side effect, that lockdep assertion now uncovered the unlocked code
    path for PtP. It is from within an adapter ERP action:
    
    zfcp_erp_strategy[1479]  intentionally DROPs erp lock around
                             zfcp_erp_strategy_do_action()

                                           BUT *_not_* around
                                           zfcp_erp_enqueue_ptp_port()

            lockdep_assert_held(&adapter->erp_lock);
    
    It causes the following lockdep warning:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 775 at drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp_dbf.c:288
                                zfcp_dbf_rec_trig+0x16a/0x188

    commit 3f142b6a7b573bde6cff926f246da05652c61eb4 upstream.
    
    Since in the software implementation of XTS-AES there is
    no notion of sector every input length is processed the same way.
    CAAM implementation has the notion of sector which causes different
    results between the software implementation and the one in CAAM
    for input lengths bigger than 512 bytes.
    Increase sector size to maximum value on 16 bits.

    crypto: caam/qi2 - fix chacha20 data size error
    
    commit 3a5a9e1ef37b030b836d92df8264f840988f4a38 upstream.
    
    HW generates a Data Size error for chacha20 requests that are not
    a multiple of 64B, since algorithm state (AS) does not have
    the FINAL bit set.
    
    Since updating req->iv (for chaining) is not required,
    modify skcipher descriptors to set the FINAL bit for chacha20.
    
    [Note that for skcipher decryption we know that ctx1_iv_off is 0,
    which allows for an optimization by not checking algorithm type,
    since append_dec_op1() sets FINAL bit for all algorithms except AES.]
    
    Also drop the descriptor operations that save the IV.
    However, in order to keep code logic simple, things like
    S/G tables generation etc. are not touched.

    xarray: Fix early termination of xas_for_each_marked
    
    commit 7e934cf5ace1dceeb804f7493fa28bb697ed3c52 upstream.
    
    xas_for_each_marked() is using entry == NULL as a termination condition
    of the iteration. When xas_for_each_marked() is used protected only by
    RCU, this can however race with xas_store(xas, NULL) in the following
    way:
    
    TASK1                                   TASK2
    page_cache_delete()                     find_get_pages_range_tag()
                                              xas_for_each_marked()
                                                xas_find_marked()
                                                  off = xas_find_chunk()
    
      xas_store(&xas, NULL)
        xas_init_marks(&xas);
        ...
        rcu_assign_pointer(*slot, NULL);
                                                  entry = xa_entry(off);
    
    And thus xas_for_each_marked() terminates prematurely possibly leading
    to missed entries in the iteration (translating to missing writeback of
    some pages or a similar problem).
    
    If we find a NULL entry that has been marked, skip it (unless we're trying
    to allocate an entry).

    dm clone metadata: Fix return type of dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions()
    
    commit 81d5553d1288c2ec0390f02f84d71ca0f0f9f137 upstream.
    
    dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions() returns the number of regions that
    have been hydrated so far. In order to do so it employs bitmap_weight().
    
    Until now, the return type of dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions() was
    unsigned long.
    
    Because bitmap_weight() returns an int, in case BITS_PER_LONG == 64 and
    the return value of bitmap_weight() is 2^31 (the maximum allowed number
    of regions for a device), the result is sign extended from 32 bits to 64
    bits and an incorrect value is displayed, in the status output of
    dm-clone, as the number of hydrated regions.
    
    Fix this by having dm_clone_nr_of_hydrated_regions() return an unsigned
    int.

    dm clone: Add overflow check for number of regions
    
    commit cd481c12269b4d276f1a52eda0ebd419079bfe3a upstream.
    
    Add overflow check for clone->nr_regions variable, which holds the
    number of regions of the target.
    
    The overflow can occur with sufficiently large devices, if BITS_PER_LONG
    == 32. E.g., if the region size is 8 sectors (4K), the overflow would
    occur for device sizes > 34359738360 sectors (~16TB).
    
    This could result in multiple device sectors wrongly mapping to the same
    region number, due to the truncation from 64 bits to 32 bits, which
    would lead to data corruption.

    mm, memcg: do not high throttle allocators based on wraparound
    
    commit 9b8b17541f13809d06f6f873325305ddbb760e3e upstream.
    
    If a cgroup violates its memory.high constraints, we may end up unduly
    penalising it.  For example, for the following hierarchy:
    
      A:   max high, 20 usage
      A/B: 9 high, 10 usage
      A/C: max high, 10 usage
    
    We would end up doing the following calculation below when calculating
    high delay for A/B:
    
      A/B: 10 - 9 = 1...
      A:   20 - PAGE_COUNTER_MAX = 21, so set max_overage to 21.
    
    This gets worse with higher disparities in usage in the parent.
    
    I have no idea how this disappeared from the final version of the patch,
    but it is certainly Not Good(tm).  This wasn't obvious in testing because,
    for a simple cgroup hierarchy with only one child, the result is usually
    roughly the same.  It's only in more complex hierarchies that things go
    really awry (although still, the effects are limited to a maximum of 2
    seconds in schedule_timeout_killable at a maximum).

    mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: fix esdhc_reset() for different controller versions
    
    commit 2aa3d826adb578b26629a79b775a552cfe3fedf7 upstream.
    
    This patch is to fix operating in esdhc_reset() for different
    controller versions, and to add bus-width restoring after data
    reset for eSDHC (verdor version <= 2.2).
    
    Also add annotation for understanding.

    io_uring: honor original task RLIMIT_FSIZE
    
    commit 4ed734b0d0913e566a9d871e15d24eb240f269f7 upstream.
    
    With the previous fixes for number of files open checking, I added some
    debug code to see if we had other spots where we're checking rlimit()
    against the async io-wq workers. The only one I found was file size
    checking, which we should also honor.
    
    During write and fallocate prep, store the max file size and override
    that for the current ask if we're in io-wq worker context.

    crypto: mxs-dcp - fix scatterlist linearization for hash
    
    commit fa03481b6e2e82355c46644147b614f18c7a8161 upstream.
    
    The incorrect traversal of the scatterlist, during the linearization phase
    lead to computing the hash value of the wrong input buffer.
    New implementation uses scatterwalk_map_and_copy()
    to address this issue.

    remoteproc: Fix NULL pointer dereference in rproc_virtio_notify
    
    commit 791c13b709dd51eb37330f2a5837434e90c87c27 upstream.
    
    Undefined rproc_ops .kick method in remoteproc driver will result in
    "Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference" in rproc_virtio_notify,
    after firmware loading if:
    
     1) .kick method wasn't defined in driver
     2) resource_table exists in firmware and has "Virtio device entry" defined
    
    Let's refuse to register an rproc-induced virtio device if no kick method was
    defined for rproc.

    remoteproc: qcom_q6v5_mss: Reload the mba region on coredump
    
    commit d96f2571dc84d128cacf1944f4ecc87834c779a6 upstream.
    
    On secure devices after a wdog/fatal interrupt, the mba region has to be
    refreshed in order to prevent the following errors during mba load.

    Trying to reclaim mpss memory while the mba is not running causes the
    system to crash on devices with security fuses blown, so leave it
    assigned to the remote on shutdown and recover it on a subsequent boot.

    This is because we hold that delayed node's mutex while doing tree
    operations.  Fix this by just wrapping the searches in nofs.

    Ordered ops are started twice in sync file, once outside of inode mutex
    and once inside, taking the dio semaphore. There was one error path
    missing the semaphore unlock.

    btrfs: unset reloc control if we fail to recover
    
    commit fb2d83eefef4e1c717205bac71cb1941edf8ae11 upstream.
    
    If we fail to load an fs root, or fail to start a transaction we can
    bail without unsetting the reloc control, which leads to problems later
    when we free the reloc control but still have it attached to the file
    system.
    
    In the normal path we'll end up calling unset_reloc_control() twice, but
    all it does is set fs_info->reloc_control = NULL, and we can only have
    one balance at a time so it's not racey.

    btrfs: fix missing file extent item for hole after ranged fsync
    
    commit 95418ed1d10774cd9a49af6f39e216c1256f1eeb upstream.
    
    When doing a fast fsync for a range that starts at an offset greater than
    zero, we can end up with a log that when replayed causes the respective
    inode miss a file extent item representing a hole if we are not using the
    NO_HOLES feature. This is because for fast fsyncs we don't log any extents
    that cover a range different from the one requested in the fsync.
    
    Example scenario to trigger it:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -O ^no-holes -f /dev/sdd
      $ mount /dev/sdd /mnt
    
      # Create a file with a single 256K and fsync it to clear to full sync
      # bit in the inode - we want the msync below to trigger a fast fsync.
      $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab 0 256K" -c "fsync" /mnt/foo
    
      # Force a transaction commit and wipe out the log tree.
      $ sync
    
      # Dirty 768K of data, increasing the file size to 1Mb, and flush only
      # the range from 256K to 512K without updating the log tree
      # (sync_file_range() does not trigger fsync, it only starts writeback
      # and waits for it to finish).
    
      $ xfs_io -c "pwrite -S 0xcd 256K 768K" /mnt/foo
      $ xfs_io -c "sync_range -abw 256K 256K" /mnt/foo
    
      # Now dirty the range from 768K to 1M again and sync that range.
      $ xfs_io -c "mmap -w 768K 256K"        \
               -c "mwrite -S 0xef 768K 256K" \
               -c "msync -s 768K 256K"       \
               -c "munmap"                   \
               /mnt/foo
    
      <power fail>
    
      # Mount to replay the log.
      $ mount /dev/sdd /mnt
      $ umount /mnt

    Fix this issue by setting the range to full (0 to LLONG_MAX) when the
    NO_HOLES feature is not enabled. This results in extra work being done
    but it gives the guarantee we don't end up with missing holes after
    replaying the log.

    btrfs: drop block from cache on error in relocation
    
    commit 8e19c9732ad1d127b5575a10f4fbcacf740500ff upstream.
    
    If we have an error while building the backref tree in relocation we'll
    process all the pending edges and then free the node.  However if we
    integrated some edges into the cache we'll lose our link to those edges
    by simply freeing this node, which means we'll leak memory and
    references to any roots that we've found.
    
    Instead we need to use remove_backref_node(), which walks through all of
    the edges that are still linked to this node and free's them up and
    drops any root references we may be holding.

    btrfs: set update the uuid generation as soon as possible
    
    commit 75ec1db8717a8f0a9d9c8d033e542fdaa7b73898 upstream.
    
    In my EIO stress testing I noticed I was getting forced to rescan the
    uuid tree pretty often, which was weird.  This is because my error
    injection stuff would sometimes inject an error after log replay but
    before we loaded the UUID tree.  If log replay committed the transaction
    it wouldn't have updated the uuid tree generation, but the tree was
    valid and didn't change, so there's no reason to not update the
    generation here.
    
    Fix this by setting the BTRFS_FS_UPDATE_UUID_TREE_GEN bit immediately
    after reading all the fs roots if the uuid tree generation matches the
    fs generation.  Then any transaction commits that happen during mount
    won't screw up our uuid tree state, forcing us to do needless uuid
    rescans.
    
    Fixes: 70f801754728 ("Btrfs: check UUID tree during mount if required")

    commit 6217b0fadd4473a16fabc6aecd7527a9f71af534 upstream.
    
    If we do merge_reloc_roots() we could insert a few roots onto the dirty
    subvol roots list, where we hold a ref on them.  If we fail to start the
    transaction we need to run clean_dirty_subvols() in order to cleanup the
    refs.

    Btrfs: fix crash during unmount due to race with delayed inode workers
    
    commit f0cc2cd70164efe8f75c5d99560f0f69969c72e4 upstream.
    
    During unmount we can have a job from the delayed inode items work queue
    still running, that can lead to at least two bad things:
    
    1) A crash, because the worker can try to create a transaction just
       after the fs roots were freed;
    
    2) A transaction leak, because the worker can create a transaction
       before the fs roots are freed and just after we committed the last
       transaction and after we stopped the transaction kthread.
    
    A stack trace example of the crash:

                                                                                                               the radix tree
                                                                                                               anymore
    
    If the worker is able to call btrfs_join_transaction() before the unmount
    task frees the fs roots, we end up leaking a transaction and all its
    resources, since after the call to btrfs_commit_super() and stopping the
    transaction kthread, we don't expect to have any transaction open anymore.
    
    When this situation happens the worker has a delayed node that has no
    more items to run, since the task calling btrfs_run_delayed_items(),
    which is doing a transaction commit, picks the same node and runs all
    its items first.
    
    We can not wait for the worker to complete when running delayed items
    through btrfs_run_delayed_items(), because we call that function in
    several phases of a transaction commit, and that could cause a deadlock
    because the worker calls btrfs_join_transaction() and the task doing the
    transaction commit may have already set the transaction state to
    TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING.
    
    Also it's not possible to get into a situation where only some of the
    items of a delayed node are added to the fs/subvolume tree in the current
    transaction and the remaining ones in the next transaction, because when
    running the items of a delayed inode we lock its mutex, effectively
    waiting for the worker if the worker is running the items of the delayed
    node already.
    
    Since this can only cause issues when unmounting a filesystem, fix it in
    a simple way by waiting for any jobs on the delayed workers queue before
    calling btrfs_commit_supper() at close_ctree(). This works because at this
    point no one can call btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() or
    btrfs_balance_delayed_items(), and if we end up waiting for any worker to
    complete, btrfs_commit_super() will commit the transaction created by the
    worker.

                      ref#0: tree block backref root 5
    
    Note that leaf 29421568 doesn't have its backref in the extent tree.
    Thus extent allocator can re-allocate leaf 29421568 for other trees.
    
    In short, the bug is caused by:
    
    - Existing tree block gets allocated to log tree
      This got its generation bumped.
    
    - Log tree balance cleaned dirty bit of offending tree block
      It will not be written back to disk, thus no WRITTEN flag.
    
    - Original owner of the tree block gets COWed
      Since the tree block has higher transid, no WRITTEN flag, it's reused,
      and not traced by transaction::dirty_pages.
    
    - Transaction aborted
      Tree blocks get cleaned according to transaction::dirty_pages. But the
      offending tree block is not recorded at all.
    
    - Filesystem unmount
      All pages are assumed to be are clean, destroying all workqueue, then
      call iput(btree_inode).
      But offending tree block is still dirty, which triggers writeback, and
      causes use-after-free bug.
    
    The detailed sequence looks like this:
    
    - Initial status
      eb: 29421568, header=WRITTEN bflags_dirty=0, page_dirty=0, gen=8,
          not traced by any dirty extent_iot_tree.
    
    - New tree block is allocated
      Since there is no backref for 29421568, it's re-allocated as new tree
      block.
      Keep in mind that tree block 29421568 is still referred by extent
      tree.
    
    - Tree block 29421568 is filled for log tree
      eb: 29421568, header=0 bflags_dirty=1, page_dirty=1, gen=9 << (gen bumped)
          traced by btrfs_root::dirty_log_pages
    
    - Some log tree operations
      Since the fs is using node size 4096, the log tree can easily go a
      level higher.
    
    - Log tree needs balance
      Tree block 29421568 gets all its content pushed to right, thus now
      it is empty, and we don't need it.
      btrfs_clean_tree_block() from __push_leaf_right() get called.
    
      eb: 29421568, header=0 bflags_dirty=0, page_dirty=0, gen=9
          traced by btrfs_root::dirty_log_pages
    
    - Log tree write back
      btree_write_cache_pages() goes through dirty pages ranges, but since
      page of tree block 29421568 gets cleaned already, it's not written
      back to disk. Thus it doesn't have WRITTEN bit set.
      But ranges in dirty_log_pages are cleared.
    
      eb: 29421568, header=0 bflags_dirty=0, page_dirty=0, gen=9
          not traced by any dirty extent_iot_tree.
    
    - Extent tree update when committing transaction
      Since tree block 29421568 has transid equal to running trans, and has
      no WRITTEN bit, should_cow_block() will use it directly without adding
      it to btrfs_transaction::dirty_pages.
    
      eb: 29421568, header=0 bflags_dirty=1, page_dirty=1, gen=9
          not traced by any dirty extent_iot_tree.
    
      At this stage, we're doomed. We have a dirty eb not tracked by any
      extent io tree.
    
    - Transaction gets aborted due to corrupted extent tree
      Btrfs cleans up dirty pages according to transaction::dirty_pages and
      btrfs_root::dirty_log_pages.
      But since tree block 29421568 is not tracked by neither of them, it's
      still dirty.
    
      eb: 29421568, header=0 bflags_dirty=1, page_dirty=1, gen=9
          not traced by any dirty extent_iot_tree.
    
    - Filesystem unmount
      Since all cleanup is assumed to be done, all workqueus are destroyed.
      Then iput(btree_inode) is called, expecting no dirty pages.
      But tree 29421568 is still dirty, thus triggering writeback.
      Since all workqueues are already freed, we cause use-after-free.
    
    This shows us that, log tree blocks + bad extent tree can cause wild
    dirty pages.
    
    [FIX]
    To fix the problem, don't submit any btree write bio if the filesytem
    has any error.  This is the last safe net, just in case other cleanup
    haven't caught catch it.

    mtd: spinand: Do not erase the block before writing a bad block marker
    
    commit b645ad39d56846618704e463b24bb994c9585c7f upstream.
    
    Currently when marking a block, we use spinand_erase_op() to erase
    the block before writing the marker to the OOB area. Doing so without
    waiting for the operation to finish can lead to the marking failing
    silently and no bad block marker being written to the flash.
    
    In fact we don't need to do an erase at all before writing the BBM.
    The ECC is disabled for raw accesses to the OOB data and we don't
    need to work around any issues with chips reporting ECC errors as it
    is known to be the case for raw NAND.

    mtd: spinand: Stop using spinand->oobbuf for buffering bad block markers
    
    commit 2148937501ee3d663e0010e519a553fea67ad103 upstream.
    
    For reading and writing the bad block markers, spinand->oobbuf is
    currently used as a buffer for the marker bytes. During the
    underlying read and write operations to actually get/set the content
    of the OOB area, the content of spinand->oobbuf is reused and changed
    by accessing it through spinand->oobbuf and/or spinand->databuf.
    
    This is a flaw in the original design of the SPI NAND core and at the
    latest from 13c15e07eedf ("mtd: spinand: Handle the case where
    PROGRAM LOAD does not reset the cache") on, it results in not having
    the bad block marker written at all, as the spinand->oobbuf is
    cleared to 0xff after setting the marker bytes to zero.
    
    To fix it, we now just store the two bytes for the marker on the
    stack and let the read/write operations copy it from/to the page
    buffer later.

    CIFS: Fix bug which the return value by asynchronous read is error
    
    commit 97adda8b3ab703de8e4c8d27646ddd54fe22879c upstream.
    
    This patch is used to fix the bug in collect_uncached_read_data()
    that rc is automatically converted from a signed number to an
    unsigned number when the CIFS asynchronous read fails.
    It will cause ctx->rc is error.
    
    Example:
    Share a directory and create a file on the Windows OS.
    Mount the directory to the Linux OS using CIFS.
    On the CIFS client of the Linux OS, invoke the pread interface to
    deliver the read request.
    
    The size of the read length plus offset of the read request is greater
    than the maximum file size.
    
    In this case, the CIFS server on the Windows OS returns a failure
    message (for example, the return value of
    smb2.nt_status is STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER).
    
    After receiving the response message, the CIFS client parses
    smb2.nt_status to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
    and converts it to the Linux error code (rdata->result=-22).
    
    Then the CIFS client invokes the collect_uncached_read_data function to
    assign the value of rdata->result to rc, that is, rc=rdata->result=-22.
    
    The type of the ctx->total_len variable is unsigned integer,
    the type of the rc variable is integer, and the type of
    the ctx->rc variable is ssize_t.
    
    Therefore, during the ternary operation, the value of rc is
    automatically converted to an unsigned number. The final result is
    ctx->rc=4294967274. However, the expected result is ctx->rc=-22.

    KVM: VMX: Add a trampoline to fix VMREAD error handling
    
    commit 842f4be95899df22b5843ba1a7c8cf37e831a6e8 upstream.
    
    Add a hand coded assembly trampoline to preserve volatile registers
    across vmread_error(), and to handle the calling convention differences
    between 64-bit and 32-bit due to asmlinkage on vmread_error().  Pass
    @field and @fault on the stack when invoking the trampoline to avoid
    clobbering volatile registers in the context of the inline assembly.
    
    Calling vmread_error() directly from inline assembly is partially broken
    on 64-bit, and completely broken on 32-bit.  On 64-bit, it will clobber
    %rdi and %rsi (used to pass @field and @fault) and any volatile regs
    written by vmread_error().  On 32-bit, asmlinkage means vmread_error()
    expects the parameters to be passed on the stack, not via regs.
    
    Opportunistically zero out the result in the trampoline to save a few
    bytes of code for every VMREAD.  A happy side effect of the trampoline
    is that the inline code footprint is reduced by three bytes on 64-bit
    due to PUSH/POP being more efficent (in terms of opcode bytes) than MOV.

    KVM: VMX: Always VMCLEAR in-use VMCSes during crash with kexec support
    
    commit 31603d4fc2bb4f0815245d496cb970b27b4f636a upstream.
    
    VMCLEAR all in-use VMCSes during a crash, even if kdump's NMI shootdown
    interrupted a KVM update of the percpu in-use VMCS list.
    
    Because NMIs are not blocked by disabling IRQs, it's possible that
    crash_vmclear_local_loaded_vmcss() could be called while the percpu list
    of VMCSes is being modified, e.g. in the middle of list_add() in
    vmx_vcpu_load_vmcs().  This potential corner case was called out in the
    original commit[*], but the analysis of its impact was wrong.
    
    Skipping the VMCLEARs is wrong because it all but guarantees that a
    loaded, and therefore cached, VMCS will live across kexec and corrupt
    memory in the new kernel.  Corruption will occur because the CPU's VMCS
    cache is non-coherent, i.e. not snooped, and so the writeback of VMCS
    memory on its eviction will overwrite random memory in the new kernel.
    The VMCS will live because the NMI shootdown also disables VMX, i.e. the
    in-progress VMCLEAR will #UD, and existing Intel CPUs do not flush the
    VMCS cache on VMXOFF.
    
    Furthermore, interrupting list_add() and list_del() is safe due to
    crash_vmclear_local_loaded_vmcss() using forward iteration.  list_add()
    ensures the new entry is not visible to forward iteration unless the
    entire add completes, via WRITE_ONCE(prev->next, new).  A bad "prev"
    pointer could be observed if the NMI shootdown interrupted list_del() or
    list_add(), but list_for_each_entry() does not consume ->prev.
    
    In addition to removing the temporary disabling of VMCLEAR, open code
    loaded_vmcs_init() in __loaded_vmcs_clear() and reorder VMCLEAR so that
    the VMCS is deleted from the list only after it's been VMCLEAR'd.
    Deleting the VMCS before VMCLEAR would allow a race where the NMI
    shootdown could arrive between list_del() and vmcs_clear() and thus
    neither flow would execute a successful VMCLEAR.  Alternatively, more
    code could be moved into loaded_vmcs_init(), but that gets rather silly
    as the only other user, alloc_loaded_vmcs(), doesn't need the smp_wmb()
    and would need to work around the list_del().
    
    Update the smp_*() comments related to the list manipulation, and
    opportunistically reword them to improve clarity.

    KVM: x86: Allocate new rmap and large page tracking when moving memslot
    
    commit edd4fa37baa6ee8e44dc65523b27bd6fe44c94de upstream.
    
    Reallocate a rmap array and recalcuate large page compatibility when
    moving an existing memslot to correctly handle the alignment properties
    of the new memslot.  The number of rmap entries required at each level
    is dependent on the alignment of the memslot's base gfn with respect to
    that level, e.g. moving a large-page aligned memslot so that it becomes
    unaligned will increase the number of rmap entries needed at the now
    unaligned level.
    
    Not updating the rmap array is the most obvious bug, as KVM accesses
    garbage data beyond the end of the rmap.  KVM interprets the bad data as
    pointers, leading to non-canonical #GPs, unexpected #PFs, etc...

    The disallow_lpage tracking is more subtle.  Failure to update results
    in KVM creating large pages when it shouldn't, either due to stale data
    or again due to indexing beyond the end of the metadata arrays, which
    can lead to memory corruption and/or leaking data to guest/userspace.
    
    Note, the arrays for the old memslot are freed by the unconditional call
    to kvm_free_memslot() in __kvm_set_memory_region().

    KVM: s390: vsie: Fix delivery of addressing exceptions
    
    commit 4d4cee96fb7a3cc53702a9be8299bf525be4ee98 upstream.
    
    Whenever we get an -EFAULT, we failed to read in guest 2 physical
    address space. Such addressing exceptions are reported via a program
    intercept to the nested hypervisor.
    
    We faked the intercept, we have to return to guest 2. Instead, right
    now we would be returning -EFAULT from the intercept handler, eventually
    crashing the VM.
    the correct thing to do is to return 1 as rc == 1 is the internal
    representation of "we have to go back into g2".
    
    Addressing exceptions can only happen if the g2->g3 page tables
    reference invalid g2 addresses (say, either a table or the final page is
    not accessible - so something that basically never happens in sane
    environments.
    
    Identified by manual code inspection.

    commit a1d032a49522cb5368e5dfb945a85899b4c74f65 upstream.
    
    In case we have a region 1 the following calculation

    free to use instructions like sllg. sllg will only use 6 bits of the
    shift value (here 64) resulting in no shift at all. That means that ALL
    addresses will be rejected.
    
    The can result in endless loops, e.g. when prefix cannot get mapped.

    KVM: nVMX: Properly handle userspace interrupt window request
    
    commit a1c77abb8d93381e25a8d2df3a917388244ba776 upstream.
    
    Return true for vmx_interrupt_allowed() if the vCPU is in L2 and L1 has
    external interrupt exiting enabled.  IRQs are never blocked in hardware
    if the CPU is in the guest (L2 from L1's perspective) when IRQs trigger
    VM-Exit.
    
    The new check percolates up to kvm_vcpu_ready_for_interrupt_injection()
    and thus vcpu_run(), and so KVM will exit to userspace if userspace has
    requested an interrupt window (to inject an IRQ into L1).
    
    Remove the @external_intr param from vmx_check_nested_events(), which is
    actually an indicator that userspace wants an interrupt window, e.g.
    it's named @req_int_win further up the stack.  Injecting a VM-Exit into
    L1 to try and bounce out to L0 userspace is all kinds of broken and is
    no longer necessary.
    
    Remove the hack in nested_vmx_vmexit() that attempted to workaround the
    breakage in vmx_check_nested_events() by only filling interrupt info if
    there's an actual interrupt pending.  The hack actually made things
    worse because it caused KVM to _never_ fill interrupt info when the
    LAPIC resides in userspace (kvm_cpu_has_interrupt() queries
    interrupt.injected, which is always cleared by prepare_vmcs12() before
    reaching the hack in nested_vmx_vmexit()).

    The WMI method to set the charge threshold does not provide a
    way to specific a battery, so we assume it is the first/primary
    battery (by checking if the name is BAT0).
    On some newer ASUS laptops (Zenbook UM431DA) though, the
    primary/first battery isn't named BAT0 but BATT, so we need
    to support that case.

    x86/tsc_msr: Make MSR derived TSC frequency more accurate
    
    commit fac01d11722c92a186b27ee26cd429a8066adfb5 upstream.
    
    The "Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 4:
    Model-Specific Registers" has the following table for the values from
    freq_desc_byt:
    
       000B: 083.3 MHz
       001B: 100.0 MHz
       010B: 133.3 MHz
       011B: 116.7 MHz
       100B: 080.0 MHz
    
    Notice how for e.g the 83.3 MHz value there are 3 significant digits, which
    translates to an accuracy of a 1000 ppm, where as a typical crystal
    oscillator is 20 - 100 ppm, so the accuracy of the frequency format used in
    the Software Developer’s Manual is not really helpful.
    
    As far as we know Bay Trail SoCs use a 25 MHz crystal and Cherry Trail
    uses a 19.2 MHz crystal, the crystal is the source clock for a root PLL
    which outputs 1600 and 100 MHz. It is unclear if the root PLL outputs are
    used directly by the CPU clock PLL or if there is another PLL in between.
    
    This does not matter though, we can model the chain of PLLs as a single PLL
    with a quotient equal to the quotients of all PLLs in the chain multiplied.
    
    So we can create a simplified model of the CPU clock setup using a
    reference clock of 100 MHz plus a quotient which gets us as close to the
    frequency from the SDM as possible.
    
    For the 83.3 MHz example from above this would give 100 MHz * 5 / 6 = 83
    and 1/3 MHz, which matches exactly what has been measured on actual
    hardware.
    
    Use a simplified PLL model with a reference clock of 100 MHz for all Bay
    and Cherry Trail models.
    
    This has been tested on the following models:
    
                  CPU freq before:        CPU freq after:
    Intel N2840   2165.800 MHz            2166.667 MHz
    Intel Z3736   1332.800 MHz            1333.333 MHz
    Intel Z3775   1466.300 MHz            1466.667 MHz
    Intel Z8350   1440.000 MHz            1440.000 MHz
    Intel Z8750   1600.000 MHz            1600.000 MHz
    
    This fixes the time drifting by about 1 second per hour (20 - 30 seconds
    per day) on (some) devices which rely on the tsc_msr.c code to determine
    the TSC frequency.

    x86/tsc_msr: Fix MSR_FSB_FREQ mask for Cherry Trail devices
    
    commit c8810e2ffc30c7e1577f9c057c4b85d984bbc35a upstream.
    
    According to the "Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's
    Manual Volume 4: Model-Specific Registers" on Cherry Trail (Airmont)
    devices the 4 lowest bits of the MSR_FSB_FREQ mask indicate the bus freq
    unlike on e.g. Bay Trail where only the lowest 3 bits are used.
    
    This is also the reason why MAX_NUM_FREQS is defined as 9, since Cherry
    Trail SoCs have 9 possible frequencies, so the lo value from the MSR needs
    to be masked with 0x0f, not with 0x07 otherwise the 9th frequency will get
    interpreted as the 1st.
    
    Bump MAX_NUM_FREQS to 16 to avoid any possibility of addressing the array
    out of bounds and makes the mask part of the cpufreq struct so it can be
    set it per model.
    
    While at it also log an error when the index points to an uninitialized
    part of the freqs lookup-table.

    signal: Extend exec_id to 64bits
    
    commit d1e7fd6462ca9fc76650fbe6ca800e35b24267da upstream.
    
    Replace the 32bit exec_id with a 64bit exec_id to make it impossible
    to wrap the exec_id counter.  With care an attacker can cause exec_id
    wrap and send arbitrary signals to a newly exec'd parent.  This
    bypasses the signal sending checks if the parent changes their
    credentials during exec.
    
    The severity of this problem can been seen that in my limited testing
    of a 32bit exec_id it can take as little as 19s to exec 65536 times.
    Which means that it can take as little as 14 days to wrap a 32bit
    exec_id.  Adam Zabrocki has succeeded wrapping the self_exe_id in 7
    days.  Even my slower timing is in the uptime of a typical server.
    Which means self_exec_id is simply a speed bump today, and if exec
    gets noticably faster self_exec_id won't even be a speed bump.
    
    Extending self_exec_id to 64bits introduces a problem on 32bit
    architectures where reading self_exec_id is no longer atomic and can
    take two read instructions.  Which means that is is possible to hit
    a window where the read value of exec_id does not match the written
    value.  So with very lucky timing after this change this still
    remains expoiltable.
    
    I have updated the update of exec_id on exec to use WRITE_ONCE
    and the read of exec_id in do_notify_parent to use READ_ONCE
    to make it clear that there is no locking between these two
    locations.

    ath9k: Handle txpower changes even when TPC is disabled

    PM / Domains: Allow no domain-idle-states DT property in genpd when parsing
    
    commit 56cb26891ea4180121265dc6b596015772c4a4b8 upstream.
    
    Commit 2c361684803e ("PM / Domains: Don't treat zero found compatible idle
    states as an error"), moved of_genpd_parse_idle_states() towards allowing
    none compatible idle state to be found for the device node, rather than
    returning an error code.
    
    However, it didn't consider that the "domain-idle-states" DT property may
    be missing as it's optional, which makes of_count_phandle_with_args() to
    return -ENOENT. Let's fix this to make the behaviour consistent.

    MIPS/tlbex: Fix LDDIR usage in setup_pw() for Loongson-3
    
    commit d191aaffe3687d1e73e644c185f5f0550ec242b5 upstream.
    
    LDDIR/LDPTE is Loongson-3's acceleration for Page Table Walking. If BD
    (Base Directory, the 4th page directory) is not enabled, then GDOffset
    is biased by BadVAddr[63:62]. So, if GDOffset (aka. BadVAddr[47:36] for
    Loongson-3) is big enough, "0b11(BadVAddr[63:62])|BadVAddr[47:36]|...."
    can far beyond pg_swapper_dir. This means the pg_swapper_dir may NOT be
    accessed by LDDIR correctly, so fix it by set PWDirExt in CP0_PWCtl.

    pstore: pstore_ftrace_seq_next should increase position index
    
    commit 6c871b7314dde9ab64f20de8f5aa3d01be4518e8 upstream.
    
    In Aug 2018 NeilBrown noticed
    commit 1f4aace60b0e ("fs/seq_file.c: simplify seq_file iteration code and interface")
    "Some ->next functions do not increment *pos when they return NULL...
    Note that such ->next functions are buggy and should be fixed.
    A simple demonstration is
    
     dd if=/proc/swaps bs=1000 skip=1
    
    Choose any block size larger than the size of /proc/swaps. This will
    always show the whole last line of /proc/swaps"
    
    /proc/swaps output was fixed recently, however there are lot of other
    affected files, and one of them is related to pstore subsystem.
    
    If .next function does not change position index, following .show function
    will repeat output related to current position index.
    
    There are at least 2 related problems:
    - read after lseek beyond end of file, described above by NeilBrown
      "dd if=<AFFECTED_FILE> bs=1000 skip=1" will generate whole last list
    - read after lseek on in middle of last line will output expected rest of
      last line but then repeat whole last line once again.
    
    If .show() function generates multy-line output (like
    pstore_ftrace_seq_show() does ?) following bash script cycles endlessly
    
     $ q=;while read -r r;do echo "$((++q)) $r";done < AFFECTED_FILE
    
    Unfortunately I'm not familiar enough to pstore subsystem and was unable
    to find affected pstore-related file on my test node.
    
    If .next function does not change position index, following .show function
    will repeat output related to current position index.

    io_uring: remove bogus RLIMIT_NOFILE check in file registration
    
    commit c336e992cb1cb1db9ee608dfb30342ae781057ab upstream.
    
    We already checked this limit when the file was opened, and we keep it
    open in the file table. Hence when we added unit_inflight to the count
    we want to register, we're doubly accounting these files. This results
    in -EMFILE for file registration, if we're at half the limit.

    commit 6a214a28132f19ace3d835a6d8f6422ec80ad200 upstream.
    
    Clear its own IRQs before the parent IRQ get enabled, so that the
    remaining IRQs do not accidentally interrupt the parent IRQ controller.
    
    This patch also fixes a reboot bug on OX820 SoC, where the remaining
    rps-timer IRQ raises a GIC interrupt that is left pending. After that,
    the rps-timer IRQ is cleared during driver initialization, and there's
    no IRQ left in rps-irq when local_irq_enable() is called, which evokes
    an error message "unexpected IRQ trap".

    cpu/hotplug: Ignore pm_wakeup_pending() for disable_nonboot_cpus()
    
    commit e98eac6ff1b45e4e73f2e6031b37c256ccb5d36b upstream.
    
    A recent change to freeze_secondary_cpus() which added an early abort if a
    wakeup is pending missed the fact that the function is also invoked for
    shutdown, reboot and kexec via disable_nonboot_cpus().
    
    In case of disable_nonboot_cpus() the wakeup event needs to be ignored as
    the purpose is to terminate the currently running kernel.
    
    Add a 'suspend' argument which is only set when the freeze is in context of
    a suspend operation. If not set then an eventually pending wakeup event is
    ignored.

    KEYS: reaching the keys quotas correctly
    
    commit 2e356101e72ab1361821b3af024d64877d9a798d upstream.
    
    Currently, when we add a new user key, the calltrace as below:
    
    add_key()
      key_create_or_update()
        key_alloc()
        __key_instantiate_and_link
          generic_key_instantiate
            key_payload_reserve
              ......
    
    Since commit a08bf91ce28e ("KEYS: allow reaching the keys quotas exactly"),
    we can reach max bytes/keys in key_alloc, but we forget to remove this
    limit when we reserver space for payload in key_payload_reserve. So we
    can only reach max keys but not max bytes when having delta between plen
    and type->def_datalen. Remove this limit when instantiating the key, so we
    can keep consistent with key_alloc.
    
    Also, fix the similar problem in keyctl_chown_key().

    commit 805fa88e0780b7ce1cc9b649dd91a0a7164c6eb4 upstream.
    
    If a TPM is in disabled state, it's reasonable for it to have an empty
    log. Bailing out of probe in this case means that the PPI interface
    isn't available, so there's no way to then enable the TPM from the OS.
    In general it seems reasonable to ignore log errors - they shouldn't
    interfere with any other TPM functionality.

    commit fe61468b2cbc2b7ce5f8d3bf32ae5001d4c434e9 upstream.
    
    When a cfs rq is throttled, the latter and its child are removed from the
    leaf list but their nr_running is not changed which includes staying higher
    than 1. When a task is enqueued in this throttled branch, the cfs rqs must
    be added back in order to ensure correct ordering in the list but this can
    only happens if nr_running == 1.
    When cfs bandwidth is used, we call unconditionnaly list_add_leaf_cfs_rq()
    when enqueuing an entity to make sure that the complete branch will be
    added.
    
    Similarly unthrottle_cfs_rq() can stop adding cfs in the list when a parent
    is throttled. Iterate the remaining entity to ensure that the complete
    branch will be added in the list.

    commit 04e046ca57ebed3943422dee10eec9e73aec081e upstream.
    
    pci-epc-mem uses a bitmap to manage the Endpoint outbound (OB) address
    region. This address region will be shared by multiple endpoint
    functions (in the case of multi function endpoint) and it has to be
    protected from concurrent access to avoid updating an inconsistent state.

    allocation API from returning incorrect addresses.

    PCI: Add boot interrupt quirk mechanism for Xeon chipsets
    
    commit b88bf6c3b6ff77948c153cac4e564642b0b90632 upstream.
    
    The following was observed by Kar Hin Ong with RT patchset:
    
      Backtrace:

      [<ffffffffb3669180>] usb_hcd_irq
      Disabling IRQ #19
    
    The problem being that this device is triggering boot interrupts
    due to threaded interrupt handling and masking of the IO-APIC. These
    boot interrupts are then forwarded on to the legacy PCH's PIRQ lines
    where there is no handler present for the device.
    
    Whenever a PCI device fires interrupt (INTx) to Pin 20 of IOAPIC 2
    (GSI 44), the kernel receives two interrupts:
    
       1. Interrupt from Pin 20 of IOAPIC 2  -> Expected
       2. Interrupt from Pin 19 of IOAPIC 1  -> UNEXPECTED
    
    Quirks for disabling boot interrupts (preferred) or rerouting the
    handler exist but do not address these Xeon chipsets' mechanism:
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/12131949181903-git-send-email-sassmann@suse.de/
    
    Add a new mechanism via PCI CFG for those chipsets supporting CIPINTRC
    register's dis_intx_rout2ich bit.

    PCI/ASPM: Clear the correct bits when enabling L1 substates
    
    commit 58a3862a10a317a81097ab0c78aecebabb1704f5 upstream.
    
    In pcie_config_aspm_l1ss(), we cleared the wrong bits when enabling ASPM L1
    Substates.  Instead of the L1.x enable bits (PCI_L1SS_CTL1_L1SS_MASK, 0xf), we
    cleared the Link Activation Interrupt Enable bit (PCI_L1SS_CAP_L1_PM_SS,
    0x10).
    
    Clear the L1.x enable bits before writing the new L1.x configuration.

    PCI: pciehp: Fix indefinite wait on sysfs requests
    
    commit 3e487d2e4aa466decd226353755c9d423e8fbacc upstream.
    
    David Hoyer reports that powering pciehp slots up or down via sysfs may
    hang:  The call to wait_event() in pciehp_sysfs_enable_slot() and
    _disable_slot() does not return because ctrl->ist_running remains true.
    
    This flag, which was introduced by commit 157c1062fcd8 ("PCI: pciehp: Avoid
    returning prematurely from sysfs requests"), signifies that the IRQ thread
    pciehp_ist() is running.  It is set to true at the top of pciehp_ist() and
    reset to false at the end.  However there are two additional return
    statements in pciehp_ist() before which the commit neglected to reset the
    flag to false and wake up waiters for the flag.
    
    That omission opens up the following race when powering up the slot:
    
    * pciehp_ist() runs because a PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_PDC event was requested
      by pciehp_sysfs_enable_slot()
    
    * pciehp_ist() turns on slot power via the following call stack:
      pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change() -> pciehp_enable_slot() ->
      __pciehp_enable_slot() -> board_added() -> pciehp_power_on_slot()
    
    * after slot power is turned on, the link comes up, resulting in a
      PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_DLLSC event
    
    * the IRQ handler pciehp_isr() stores the event in ctrl->pending_events
      and returns IRQ_WAKE_THREAD
    
    * the IRQ thread is already woken (it's bringing up the slot), but the
      genirq code remembers to re-run the IRQ thread after it has finished
      (such that it can deal with the new event) by setting IRQTF_RUNTHREAD
      via __handle_irq_event_percpu() -> __irq_wake_thread()
    
    * the IRQ thread removes PCI_EXP_SLTSTA_DLLSC from ctrl->pending_events
      via board_added() -> pciehp_check_link_status() in order to deal with
      presence and link flaps per commit 6c35a1ac3da6 ("PCI: pciehp:
      Tolerate initially unstable link")
    
    * after pciehp_ist() has successfully brought up the slot, it resets
      ctrl->ist_running to false and wakes up the sysfs requester
    
    * the genirq code re-runs pciehp_ist(), which sets ctrl->ist_running
      to true but then returns with IRQ_NONE because ctrl->pending_events
      is empty
    
    * pciehp_sysfs_enable_slot() is finally woken but notices that
      ctrl->ist_running is true, hence continues waiting
    
    The only way to get the hung task going again is to trigger a hotplug
    event which brings down the slot, e.g. by yanking out the card.
    
    The same race exists when powering down the slot because remove_board()
    likewise clears link or presence changes in ctrl->pending_events per commit
    3943af9d01e9 ("PCI: pciehp: Ignore Link State Changes after powering off a
    slot") and thereby may cause a re-run of pciehp_ist() which returns with
    IRQ_NONE without resetting ctrl->ist_running to false.
    
    Fix by adding a goto label before the teardown steps at the end of
    pciehp_ist() and jumping to that label from the two return statements which
    currently neglect to reset the ctrl->ist_running flag.

    efi/x86: Add TPM related EFI tables to unencrypted mapping checks
    
    commit f10e80a19b07b58fc2adad7945f8313b01503bae upstream.
    
    When booting with SME active, EFI tables must be mapped unencrypted since
    they were built by UEFI in unencrypted memory. Update the list of tables
    to be checked during early_memremap() processing to account for the EFI
    TPM tables.
    
    This fixes a bug where an EFI TPM log table has been created by UEFI, but
    it lives in memory that has been marked as usable rather than reserved.

    nvme-fc: Revert "add module to ops template to allow module references"
    
    commit 8c5c660529209a0e324c1c1a35ce3f83d67a2aa5 upstream.
    
    The original patch was to resolve the lldd being able to be unloaded
    while being used to talk to the boot device of the system. However, the
    end result of the original patch is that any driver unload while a nvme
    controller is live via the lldd is now being prohibited. Given the module
    reference, the module teardown routine can't be called, thus there's no
    way, other than manual actions to terminate the controllers.

    thermal: devfreq_cooling: inline all stubs for CONFIG_DEVFREQ_THERMAL=n
    
    commit 3f5b9959041e0db6dacbea80bb833bff5900999f upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_DEVFREQ_THERMAL is disabled all functions except
    of_devfreq_cooling_register_power() were already inlined. Also inline
    the last function to avoid compile errors when multiple drivers call
    of_devfreq_cooling_register_power() when CONFIG_DEVFREQ_THERMAL is not
    set. Compilation failed with the following message:
      multiple definition of `of_devfreq_cooling_register_power'
    (which then lists all usages of of_devfreq_cooling_register_power())
    
    Thomas Zimmermann reported this problem [0] on a kernel config with
    CONFIG_DRM_LIMA={m,y}, CONFIG_DRM_PANFROST={m,y} and
    CONFIG_DEVFREQ_THERMAL=n after both, the lima and panfrost drivers
    gained devfreq cooling support.

    The check for any active GPEs added by commit fdde0ff8590b ("ACPI:
    PM: s2idle: Prevent spurious SCIs from waking up the system") turns
    out to be insufficiently precise to prevent some systems from
    resuming prematurely due to a spurious EC wakeup, so refine it
    by first checking if any GPEs other than the EC GPE are active
    and skipping all of the SCIs coming from the EC that do not produce
    any genuine wakeup events after processing.

    ACPICA: Allow acpi_any_gpe_status_set() to skip one GPE
    
    commit 0ce792d660bda990c675eaf14ce09594a9b85cbf upstream.
    
    The check carried out by acpi_any_gpe_status_set() is not precise enough
    for the suspend-to-idle implementation in Linux and in some cases it is
    necessary make it skip one GPE (specifically, the EC GPE) from the check
    to prevent a race condition leading to a premature system resume from
    occurring.
    
    For this reason, redefine acpi_any_gpe_status_set() to take the number
    of a GPE to skip as an argument.

    commit ecb9c790999fd6c5af0f44783bd0217f0b89ec2b upstream.
    
    The value in "new" is constructed from "old" such that all bits defined
    as reserved by the ACPI spec[1] are left untouched. But if those bits
    do not happen to be all zero, "new < 3" will not evaluate to true.
    
    The firmware of the laptop(s) Medion MD63490 / Akoya P15648 comes with
    garbage inside the "FACS" ACPI table. The starting value is
    old=0x4944454d, therefore new=0x4944454e, which is >= 3. Mask off
    the reserved bits.

    media: ti-vpe: cal: fix a kernel oops when unloading module
    
    commit 80264809ea0a3fd2ee8251f31a9eb85d2c3fc77e upstream.
    
    After the switch to use v4l2_async_notifier_add_subdev() and
    v4l2_async_notifier_cleanup(), unloading the ti_cal module would cause a
    kernel oops.
    
    This was root cause to the fact that v4l2_async_notifier_cleanup() tries
    to kfree the asd pointer passed into v4l2_async_notifier_add_subdev().
    
    In our case the asd reference was from a statically allocated struct.
    So in effect v4l2_async_notifier_cleanup() was trying to free a pointer
    that was not kalloc.
    
    So here we switch to using a kzalloc struct instead of a static one.
    To achieve this we re-order some of the calls to prevent asd allocation
    from leaking.

    media: hantro: Read be32 words starting at every fourth byte
    
    commit e34bca49e4953e5c2afc0425303199a5fd515f82 upstream.
    
    Since (luma/chroma)_qtable is an array of unsigned char, indexing it
    returns consecutive byte locations, but we are supposed to read the arrays
    in four-byte words. Consequently, we should be pointing
    get_unaligned_be32() at consecutive word locations instead.

    commit 1d3aa4a5516d2e4933fe3cca11d3349ef63bc547 upstream.
    
    MSI GL63 laptop requires the similar quirk like other MSI models,
    ALC1220_FIXUP_CLEVO_P950.  The board BIOS doesn't provide a PCI SSID
    for the device, hence we need to take the codec SSID (1462:1275)

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Remove now-unnecessary XPS 13 headphone noise fixups
    
    commit f36938aa7440f46a0a365f1cfde5f5985af2bef3 upstream.
    
    patch_realtek.c has historically failed to properly configure the PC
    Beep Hidden Register for the ALC256 codec (among others). Depending on
    your kernel version, symptoms of this misconfiguration can range from
    chassis noise, picked up by a poorly-shielded PCBEEP trace, getting
    amplified and played on your internal speaker and/or headphones to loud
    feedback, which responds to the "Headphone Mic Boost" ALSA control,
    getting played through your headphones. For details of the problem, see
    the patch in this series titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - Set principled PC
    Beep configuration for ALC256", which fixes the configuration.
    
    These symptoms have been most noticed on the Dell XPS 13 9350 and 9360,
    popular laptops that use the ALC256. As a result, several model-specific
    fixups have been introduced to try and fix the problem, the most
    egregious of which locks the "Headphone Mic Boost" control as a hack to
    minimize noise from a feedback loop that shouldn't have been there in
    the first place.
    
    Now that the underlying issue has been fixed, remove all these fixups.
    Remaining fixups needed by the XPS 13 are all picked up by existing pin
    quirks.
    
    This change should, for the XPS 13 9350/9360
    
     - Significantly increase volume and audio quality on headphones
     - Eliminate headphone popping on suspend/resume
     - Allow "Headphone Mic Boost" to be set again, making the headphone
       jack fully usable as a microphone jack too.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Set principled PC Beep configuration for ALC256
    
    commit c44737449468a0bdc50e09ec75e530f208391561 upstream.
    
    The Realtek PC Beep Hidden Register[1] is currently set by
    patch_realtek.c in two different places:
    
    In alc_fill_eapd_coef(), it's set to the value 0x5757, corresponding to
    non-beep input on 1Ah and no 1Ah loopback to either headphones or
    speakers. (Although, curiously, the loopback amp is still enabled.) This
    write was added fairly recently by commit e3743f431143 ("ALSA:
    hda/realtek - Dell headphone has noise on unmute for ALC236") and is a
    safe default. However, it happens in the wrong place:
    alc_fill_eapd_coef() runs on module load and cold boot but not on S3
    resume, meaning the register loses its value after suspend.
    
    Conversely, in alc256_init(), the register is updated to unset bit 13
    (disable speaker loopback) and set bit 5 (set non-beep input on 1Ah).
    Although this write does run on S3 resume, it's not quite enough to fix
    up the register's default value of 0x3717. What's missing is a set of
    bit 14 to disable headphone loopback. Without that, we end up with a
    feedback loop where the headphone jack is being driven by amplified
    samples of itself[2].
    
    This change eliminates the update in alc256_init() and replaces it with
    the 0x5757 write from alc_fill_eapd_coef(). Kailang says that 0x5757 is
    supposed to be the codec's default value, so using it will make
    debugging easier for Realtek.
    
    Affects the ALC255, ALC256, ALC257, ALC235, and ALC236 codecs.
    
    [1] Newly documented in Documentation/sound/hd-audio/realtek-pc-beep.rst
    
    [2] Setting the "Headphone Mic Boost" control from userspace changes
    this feedback loop and has been a widely-shared workaround for headphone
    noise on laptops like the Dell XPS 13 9350. This commit eliminates the
    feedback loop and makes the workaround unnecessary.

    ALSA: doc: Document PC Beep Hidden Register on Realtek ALC256
    
    commit f128090491c3f5aacef91a863f8c52abf869c436 upstream.
    
    This codec (among others) has a hidden set of audio routes, apparently
    designed to allow PC Beep output without a mixer widget on the output
    path, which are controlled by an undocumented Realtek vendor register.
    The default configuration of these routes means that certain inputs
    aren't accessible, necessitating driver control of the register.
    However, Realtek has provided no documentation of the register, instead
    opting to fix issues by providing magic numbers, most of which have been
    at least somewhat erroneous. These magic numbers then get copied by
    others into model-specific fixups, leading to a fragmented and buggy set
    of configurations.
    
    To get out of this situation, I've reverse engineered the register by
    flipping bits and observing how the codec's behavior changes. This
    commit documents my findings. It does not change any code.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - a fake key event is triggered by running shutup
    
    commit 476c02e0b4fd9071d158f6a1a1dfea1d36ee0ffd upstream.
    
    On the Lenovo X1C7 machines, after we plug the headset, the rt_resume()
    and rt_suspend() of the codec driver will be called periodically, the
    driver can't stay in the rt_suspend state even users doen't use the
    sound card.
    
    Through debugging, I found  when running rt_suspend(), it will call
    alc225_shutup(), in this function, it will change 3k pull down control
    by alc_update_coef_idx(codec, 0x4a, 0, 3 << 10), this will trigger a
    fake key event and that event will resume the codec, when codec
    suspend agin, it will trigger the fake key event one more time, this
    process will repeat.
    
    If disable the key event before changing the pull down control, it
    will not trigger fake key event. It also needs to restore the pull
    down control and re-enable the key event, otherwise the system can't
    get key event when codec is in rt_suspend state.
    
    Also move some functions ahead of alc225_shutup(), this can save the
    function declaration.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix regression by buffer overflow fix
    
    commit ae769d3556644888c964635179ef192995f40793 upstream.
    
    The recent fix for the OOB access in PCM OSS plugins (commit
    f2ecf903ef06: "ALSA: pcm: oss: Avoid plugin buffer overflow") caused a
    regression on OSS applications.  The patch introduced the size check
    in client and slave size calculations to limit to each plugin's buffer
    size, but I overlooked that some code paths call those without
    allocating the buffer but just for estimation.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by skipping the size check for those code
    paths while keeping checking in the actual transfer calls.

    commit f63ec55ff904b2f2e126884fcad93175f16ab4bb upstream.
    
    In AIO case, the request is freed up if ep_queue fails.
    However, io_data->req still has the reference to this freed
    request. In the case of this failure if there is aio_cancel
    call on this io_data it will lead to an invalid dequeue
    operation and a potential use after free issue.
    Fix this by setting the io_data->req to NULL when the request
    is freed as part of queue failure.

    ASoC: dpcm: allow start or stop during pause for backend
    
    commit 21fca8bdbb64df1297e8c65a746c4c9f4a689751 upstream.
    
    soc_compr_trigger_fe() allows start or stop after pause_push.
    In dpcm_be_dai_trigger(), however, only pause_release is allowed
    command after pause_push.
    So, start or stop after pause in compress offload is always
    returned as error if the compress offload is used with dpcm.
    To fix the problem, SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_PAUSED should be allowed
    for start or stop command.

    ASoC: dapm: connect virtual mux with default value
    
    commit 3bbbb7728fc853d71dbce4073fef9f281fbfb4dd upstream.
    
    Since a virtual mixer has no backing registers
    to decide which path to connect,
    it will try to match with initial state.
    This is to ensure that the default mixer choice will be
    correctly powered up during initialization.
    Invert flag is used to select initial state of the virtual switch.
    Since actual hardware can't be disconnected by virtual switch,
    connected is better choice as initial state in many cases.

    btrfs: track reloc roots based on their commit root bytenr
    
    [ Upstream commit ea287ab157c2816bf12aad4cece41372f9d146b4 ]
    
    We always search the commit root of the extent tree for looking up back
    references, however we track the reloc roots based on their current
    bytenr.
    
    This is wrong, if we commit the transaction between relocating tree
    blocks we could end up in this code in build_backref_tree
    
      if (key.objectid == key.offset) {
              /*
               * Only root blocks of reloc trees use backref
               * pointing to itself.
               */
              root = find_reloc_root(rc, cur->bytenr);
              ASSERT(root);
              cur->root = root;
              break;
      }
    
    find_reloc_root() is looking based on the bytenr we had in the commit
    root, but if we've COWed this reloc root we will not find that bytenr,
    and we will trip over the ASSERT(root).
    
    Fix this by using the commit_root->start bytenr for indexing the commit
    root.  Then we change the __update_reloc_root() caller to be used when
    we switch the commit root for the reloc root during commit.
    
    This fixes the panic I was seeing when we started throttling relocation
    for delayed refs.

    btrfs: restart relocate_tree_blocks properly
    
    [ Upstream commit 50dbbb71c79df89532ec41d118d59386e5a877e3 ]
    
    There are two bugs here, but fixing them independently would just result
    in pain if you happened to bisect between the two patches.
    
    First is how we handle the -EAGAIN from relocate_tree_block().  We don't
    set error, unless we happen to be the first node, which makes no sense,
    I have no idea what the code was trying to accomplish here.
    
    We in fact _do_ want err set here so that we know we need to restart in
    relocate_block_group().  Also we need finish_pending_nodes() to not
    actually call link_to_upper(), because we didn't actually relocate the
    block.
    
    And then if we do get -EAGAIN we do not want to set our backref cache
    last_trans to the one before ours.  This would force us to update our
    backref cache if we didn't cross transaction ids, which would mean we'd
    have some nodes updated to their new_bytenr, but still able to find
    their old bytenr because we're searching the same commit root as the
    last time we went through relocate_tree_blocks.
    
    Fixing these two things keeps us from panicing when we start breaking
    out of relocate_tree_blocks() either for delayed ref flushing or enospc.

    btrfs: remove a BUG_ON() from merge_reloc_roots()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b7b74315b24dc064bc1c683659061c3d48f8668 ]
    
    This was pretty subtle, we default to reloc roots having 0 root refs, so
    if we crash in the middle of the relocation they can just be deleted.
    If we successfully complete the relocation operations we'll set our root
    refs to 1 in prepare_to_merge() and then go on to merge_reloc_roots().
    
    At prepare_to_merge() time if any of the reloc roots have a 0 reference
    still, we will remove that reloc root from our reloc root rb tree, and
    then clean it up later.
    
    However this only happens if we successfully start a transaction.  If
    we've aborted previously we will skip this step completely, and only
    have reloc roots with a reference count of 0, but were never properly
    removed from the reloc control's rb tree.
    
    This isn't a problem per-se, our references are held by the list the
    reloc roots are on, and by the original root the reloc root belongs to.
    If we end up in this situation all the reloc roots will be added to the
    dirty_reloc_list, and then properly dropped at that point.  The reloc
    control will be free'd and the rb tree is no longer used.
    
    There were two options when fixing this, one was to remove the BUG_ON(),
    the other was to make prepare_to_merge() handle the case where we
    couldn't start a trans handle.
    
    IMO this is the cleaner solution.  I started with handling the error in
    prepare_to_merge(), but it turned out super ugly.  And in the end this
    BUG_ON() simply doesn't matter, the cleanup was happening properly, we
    were just panicing because this BUG_ON() only matters in the success
    case.  So I've opted to just remove it and add a comment where it was.

    [CAUSE]
    The problem happens when we have called qgroup_rescan_init(), but
    not queued the worker. It can be caused mostly by error handling.
    
            Qgroup ioctl thread             |       Unmount thread
    ----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------
                                            |
    btrfs_qgroup_rescan()                   |
    |- qgroup_rescan_init()                 |
    |  |- qgroup_rescan_running = true;     |
    |                                       |
    |- trans = btrfs_join_transaction()     |
    |  Some error happened                  |
    |                                       |
    |- btrfs_qgroup_rescan() returns error  |
       But qgroup_rescan_running == true;   |
                                            | close_ctree()
                                            | |- btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion()
                                            |    |- running == true;
                                            |    |- wait_for_completion();
    
    btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker is never queued, thus no one is going to wake
    up close_ctree() and we get a deadlock.
    
    All involved qgroup_rescan_init() callers are:
    
    - btrfs_qgroup_rescan()
      The example above. It's possible to trigger the deadlock when error
      happened.
    
    - btrfs_quota_enable()
      Not possible. Just after qgroup_rescan_init() we queue the work.
    
    - btrfs_read_qgroup_config()
      It's possible to trigger the deadlock. It only init the work, the
      work queueing happens in btrfs_qgroup_rescan_resume().
      Thus if error happened in between, deadlock is possible.
    
    We shouldn't set fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running just in
    qgroup_rescan_init(), as at that stage we haven't yet queued qgroup
    rescan worker to run.
    
    [FIX]
    Set qgroup_rescan_running before queueing the work, so that we ensure
    the rescan work is queued when we wait for it.

    block, bfq: fix use-after-free in bfq_idle_slice_timer_body
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f95fa5c955d0a9987ffdc3a095e2f4e62c5f2a9 ]
    
    In bfq_idle_slice_timer func, bfqq = bfqd->in_service_queue is
    not in bfqd-lock critical section. The bfqq, which is not
    equal to NULL in bfq_idle_slice_timer, may be freed after passing
    to bfq_idle_slice_timer_body. So we will access the freed memory.
    
    In addition, considering the bfqq may be in race, we should
    firstly check whether bfqq is in service before doing something
    on it in bfq_idle_slice_timer_body func. If the bfqq in race is
    not in service, it means the bfqq has been expired through
    __bfq_bfqq_expire func, and wait_request flags has been cleared in
    __bfq_bfqd_reset_in_service func. So we do not need to re-clear the
    wait_request of bfqq which is not in service.

    locking/lockdep: Avoid recursion in lockdep_count_{for,back}ward_deps()
    
    [ Upstream commit 25016bd7f4caf5fc983bbab7403d08e64cba3004 ]
    
    Qian Cai reported a bug when PROVE_RCU_LIST=y, and read on /proc/lockdep
    triggered a warning:
    
      [ ] DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(current->hardirqs_enabled)
      ...
      [ ] Call Trace:
      [ ]  lock_is_held_type+0x5d/0x150

      [ ]  lockdep_count_forward_deps+0x11a/0x1a0
    
    The warning got triggered because lockdep_count_forward_deps() call
    __bfs() without current->lockdep_recursion being set, as a result
    a lockdep internal function (__bfs()) is checked by lockdep, which is
    unexpected, and the inconsistency between the irq-off state and the
    state traced by lockdep caused the warning.
    
    Apart from this warning, lockdep internal functions like __bfs() should
    always be protected by current->lockdep_recursion to avoid potential
    deadlocks and data inconsistency, therefore add the
    current->lockdep_recursion on-and-off section to protect __bfs() in both
    lockdep_count_forward_deps() and lockdep_count_backward_deps()

    spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Replace interruptible wait queue with a simple completion
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f5ee75ea1718a09149460b3df993f389a67b56a ]
    
    Currently the driver puts the process in interruptible sleep waiting for
    the interrupt train to finish transfer to/from the tx_buf and rx_buf.
    
    But exiting the process with ctrl-c may make the kernel panic: the
    wait_event_interruptible call will return -ERESTARTSYS, which a proper
    driver implementation is perhaps supposed to handle, but nonetheless
    this one doesn't, and aborts the transfer altogether.
    
    Actually when the task is interrupted, there is still a high chance that
    the dspi_interrupt is still triggering. And if dspi_transfer_one_message
    returns execution all the way to the spi_device driver, that can free
    the spi_message and spi_transfer structures, leaving the interrupts to
    access a freed tx_buf and rx_buf.

    So it is clear that the "interruptible" part isn't handled correctly.
    When the process receives a signal, one could either attempt a clean
    abort (which appears to be difficult with this hardware) or just keep
    restarting the sleep until the wait queue really completes. But checking
    in a loop for -ERESTARTSYS is a bit too complicated for this driver, so
    just make the sleep uninterruptible, to avoid all that nonsense.
    
    The wait queue was actually restructured as a completion, after polling
    other drivers for the most "popular" approach.

    firmware: fix a double abort case with fw_load_sysfs_fallback
    
    [ Upstream commit bcfbd3523f3c6eea51a74d217a8ebc5463bcb7f4 ]
    
    fw_sysfs_wait_timeout may return err with -ENOENT
    at fw_load_sysfs_fallback and firmware is already
    in abort status, no need to abort again, so skip it.
    
    This issue is caused by concurrent situation like below:
    when thread 1# wait firmware loading, thread 2# may write
    -1 to abort loading and wakeup thread 1# before it timeout.
    so wait_for_completion_killable_timeout of thread 1# would
    return remaining time which is != 0 with fw_st->status
    FW_STATUS_ABORTED.And the results would be converted into
    err -ENOENT in __fw_state_wait_common and transfered to
    fw_load_sysfs_fallback in thread 1#.
    The -ENOENT means firmware status is already at ABORTED,
    so fw_load_sysfs_fallback no need to get mutex to abort again.
    -----------------------------
    thread 1#,wait for loading
    fw_load_sysfs_fallback
     ->fw_sysfs_wait_timeout
        ->__fw_state_wait_common
           ->wait_for_completion_killable_timeout
    
    in __fw_state_wait_common,
    ...
    93    ret = wait_for_completion_killable_timeout(&fw_st->completion, timeout);
    94    if (ret != 0 && fw_st->status == FW_STATUS_ABORTED)
    95       return -ENOENT;
    96    if (!ret)
    97       return -ETIMEDOUT;
    98
    99    return ret < 0 ? ret : 0;
    -----------------------------
    thread 2#, write -1 to abort loading
    firmware_loading_store
     ->fw_load_abort
       ->__fw_load_abort
         ->fw_state_aborted
           ->__fw_state_set
             ->complete_all
    
    in __fw_state_set,
    ...
    111    if (status == FW_STATUS_DONE || status == FW_STATUS_ABORTED)
    112       complete_all(&fw_st->completion);
    -------------------------------------------
    BTW,the double abort issue would not cause kernel panic or create an issue,
    but slow down it sometimes.The change is just a minor optimization.

    This is happening because we have a pending doorbell that requires
    retrigger. As SW retriggering is done in a tasklet, we trigger the
    circular dependency above.
    
    The easy cop-out is to provide a retrigger callback that doesn't
    require acquiring any extra lock.

    usb: dwc3: core: add support for disabling SS instances in park mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ba6b09fda5e0cb741ee56f3264665e0edc64822 ]
    
    In certain circumstances, the XHCI SuperSpeed instance in park mode
    can fail to recover, thus on Amlogic G12A/G12B/SM1 SoCs when there is high
    load on the single XHCI SuperSpeed instance, the controller can crash like:
     xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.0.auto: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command.
     xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.0.auto: Host halt failed, -110
     xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.0.auto: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
     xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.0.auto: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command.
     hub 2-1.1:1.0: hub_ext_port_status failed (err = -22)
     xhci-hcd xhci-hcd.0.auto: HC died; cleaning up
     usb 2-1.1-port1: cannot reset (err = -22)
    
    Setting the PARKMODE_DISABLE_SS bit in the DWC3_USB3_GUCTL1 mitigates
    the issue. The bit is described as :
    "When this bit is set to '1' all SS bus instances in park mode are disabled"
    
    Synopsys explains:
    The GUCTL1.PARKMODE_DISABLE_SS is only available in
    dwc_usb3 controller running in host mode.
    This should not be set for other IPs.
    This can be disabled by default based on IP, but I recommend to have a
    property to enable this feature for devices that need this.

    media: i2c: ov5695: Fix power on and off sequences
    
    [ Upstream commit f1a64f56663e9d03e509439016dcbddd0166b2da ]
    
    From the measured hardware signal, OV5695 reset pin goes high for a
    short period of time during boot-up. From the sensor specification, the
    reset pin is active low and the DT binding defines the pin as active
    low, which means that the values set by the driver are inverted and thus
    the value requested in probe ends up high.
    
    Fix it by changing probe to request the reset GPIO initialized to high,
    which makes the initial state of the physical signal low.
    
    In addition, DOVDD rising must occur before DVDD rising from spec., but
    regulator_bulk_enable() API enables all the regulators asynchronously.
    Use an explicit loops of regulator_enable() instead.
    
    For power off sequence, it is required that DVDD falls first. Given the
    bulk API does not give any guarantee about the order of regulators,
    change the driver to use regulator_disable() instead.
    
    The sensor also requires a delay between reset high and first I2C
    transaction, which was assumed to be 8192 XVCLK cycles, but 1ms is
    recommended by the vendor. Fix this as well.

    block: Fix use-after-free issue accessing struct io_cq
    
    [ Upstream commit 30a2da7b7e225ef6c87a660419ea04d3cef3f6a7 ]
    
    There is a potential race between ioc_release_fn() and
    ioc_clear_queue() as shown below, due to which below kernel
    crash is observed. It also can result into use-after-free
    issue.
    
    context#1:                              context#2:
    ioc_release_fn()                        __ioc_clear_queue() gets the same icq
    ->spin_lock(&ioc->lock);                ->spin_lock(&ioc->lock);
    ->ioc_destroy_icq(icq);
      ->list_del_init(&icq->q_node);
      ->call_rcu(&icq->__rcu_head,
            icq_free_icq_rcu);
    ->spin_unlock(&ioc->lock);
                                            ->ioc_destroy_icq(icq);
                                              ->hlist_del_init(&icq->ioc_node);
                                              This results into below crash as this memory
                                              is now used by icq->__rcu_head in context#1.
                                              There is a chance that icq could be free'd
                                              as well.

    Fix this by adding a new ICQ_DESTROYED flag in ioc_destroy_icq() to
    indicate this icq is once marked as destroyed. Also, ensure
    __ioc_clear_queue() is accessing icq within rcu_read_lock/unlock so
    that icq doesn't get free'd up while it is still using it.

    efi/x86: Ignore the memory attributes table on i386
    
    [ Upstream commit dd09fad9d2caad2325a39b766ce9e79cfc690184 ]
    
    Commit:
    
      3a6b6c6fb23667fa ("efi: Make EFI_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES_TABLE initialization common across all architectures")
    
    moved the call to efi_memattr_init() from ARM specific to the generic
    EFI init code, in order to be able to apply the restricted permissions
    described in that table on x86 as well.
    
    We never enabled this feature fully on i386, and so mapping and
    reserving this table is pointless. However, due to the early call to
    memblock_reserve(), the memory bookkeeping gets confused to the point
    where it produces the splat below when we try to map the memory later
    on:

    x86/boot: Use unsigned comparison for addresses
    
    [ Upstream commit 81a34892c2c7c809f9c4e22c5ac936ae673fb9a2 ]
    
    The load address is compared with LOAD_PHYSICAL_ADDR using a signed
    comparison currently (using jge instruction).
    
    When loading a 64-bit kernel using the new efi32_pe_entry() point added by:
    
      97aa276579b2 ("efi/x86: Add true mixed mode entry point into .compat section")
    
    using Qemu with -m 3072, the firmware actually loads us above 2Gb,
    resulting in a very early crash.
    
    Use the JAE instruction to perform a unsigned comparison instead, as physical
    addresses should be considered unsigned.

    gfs2: Don't demote a glock until its revokes are written
    
    [ Upstream commit df5db5f9ee112e76b5202fbc331f990a0fc316d6 ]
    
    Before this patch, run_queue would demote glocks based on whether
    there are any more holders. But if the glock has pending revokes that
    haven't been written to the media, giving up the glock might end in
    file system corruption if the revokes never get written due to
    io errors, node crashes and fences, etc. In that case, another node
    will replay the metadata blocks associated with the glock, but
    because the revoke was never written, it could replay that block
    even though the glock had since been granted to another node who
    might have made changes.
    
    This patch changes the logic in run_queue so that it never demotes
    a glock until its count of pending revokes reaches zero.

    gfs2: Do log_flush in gfs2_ail_empty_gl even if ail list is empty
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ff78289356af640941bbb0dd3f46af2063f0046 ]
    
    Before this patch, if gfs2_ail_empty_gl saw there was nothing on
    the ail list, it would return and not flush the log. The problem
    is that there could still be a revoke for the rgrp sitting on the
    sd_log_le_revoke list that's been recently taken off the ail list.
    But that revoke still needs to be written, and the rgrp_go_inval
    still needs to call log_flush_wait to ensure the revokes are all
    properly written to the journal before we relinquish control of
    the glock to another node. If we give the glock to another node
    before we have this knowledge, the node might crash and its journal
    replayed, in which case the missing revoke would allow the journal
    replay to replay the rgrp over top of the rgrp we already gave to
    another node, thus overwriting its changes and corrupting the
    file system.
    
    This patch makes gfs2_ail_empty_gl still call gfs2_log_flush rather
    than returning.

    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xf8/0x170
    
    The issue is that we make an erroneous extra call to scsi_host_put()
    for that host:
    
    So in ahci_init_one()->ata_host_alloc_pinfo()->ata_host_alloc(), we setup
    a device release method - ata_devres_release() - which intends to release
    the SCSI hosts:
    
    static void ata_devres_release(struct device *gendev, void *res)
    {
            ...
            for (i = 0; i < host->n_ports; i++) {
                    struct ata_port *ap = host->ports[i];
    
                    if (!ap)
                            continue;
    
                    if (ap->scsi_host)
                            scsi_host_put(ap->scsi_host);
    
            }
            ...
    }
    
    However in the ata_scsi_add_hosts() error path, we also call
    scsi_host_put() for the SCSI hosts.
    
    Fix by removing the the scsi_host_put() calls in ata_scsi_add_hosts() and
    leave this to ata_devres_release().

    block, bfq: move forward the getting of an extra ref in bfq_bfqq_move
    
    [ Upstream commit fd1bb3ae54a9a2e0c42709de861c69aa146b8955 ]
    
    Commit ecedd3d7e199 ("block, bfq: get extra ref to prevent a queue
    from being freed during a group move") gets an extra reference to a
    bfq_queue before possibly deactivating it (temporarily), in
    bfq_bfqq_move(). This prevents the bfq_queue from disappearing before
    being reactivated in its new group.
    
    Yet, the bfq_queue may also be expired (i.e., its service may be
    stopped) before the bfq_queue is deactivated. And also an expiration
    may lead to a premature freeing. This commit fixes this issue by
    simply moving forward the getting of the extra reference already
    introduced by commit ecedd3d7e199 ("block, bfq: get extra ref to
    prevent a queue from being freed during a group move").

    PCI/switchtec: Fix init_completion race condition with poll_wait()
    
    [ Upstream commit efbdc769601f4d50018bf7ca50fc9f7c67392ece ]
    
    The call to init_completion() in mrpc_queue_cmd() can theoretically
    race with the call to poll_wait() in switchtec_dev_poll().
    
      poll()                        write()
        switchtec_dev_poll()          switchtec_dev_write()

                                             init_waitqueue_head(&s->comp.wait)
    
    To my knowledge, no one has hit this bug.
    
    Fix this by using reinit_completion() instead of init_completion() in
    mrpc_queue_cmd().

    sched: Avoid scale real weight down to zero
    
    [ Upstream commit 26cf52229efc87e2effa9d788f9b33c40fb3358a ]
    
    During our testing, we found a case that shares no longer
    working correctly, the cgroup topology is like:
    
      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/A          (shares=102400)
      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/A/B        (shares=2)
      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/A/B/C      (shares=1024)
    
      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/D          (shares=1024)
      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/D/E        (shares=1024)
      /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/D/E/F      (shares=1024)
    
    The same benchmark is running in group C & F, no other tasks are
    running, the benchmark is capable to consumed all the CPUs.
    
    We suppose the group C will win more CPU resources since it could
    enjoy all the shares of group A, but it's F who wins much more.
    
    The reason is because we have group B with shares as 2, since
    A->cfs_rq.load.weight == B->se.load.weight == B->shares/nr_cpus,
    so A->cfs_rq.load.weight become very small.
    
    And in calc_group_shares() we calculate shares as:
    
      load = max(scale_load_down(cfs_rq->load.weight), cfs_rq->avg.load_avg);
      shares = (tg_shares * load) / tg_weight;
    
    Since the 'cfs_rq->load.weight' is too small, the load become 0
    after scale down, although 'tg_shares' is 102400, shares of the se
    which stand for group A on root cfs_rq become 2.
    
    While the se of D on root cfs_rq is far more bigger than 2, so it
    wins the battle.
    
    Thus when scale_load_down() scale real weight down to 0, it's no
    longer telling the real story, the caller will have the wrong
    information and the calculation will be buggy.
    
    This patch add check in scale_load_down(), so the real weight will
    be >= MIN_SHARES after scale, after applied the group C wins as
    expected.

    time/sched_clock: Expire timer in hardirq context
    
    [ Upstream commit 2c8bd58812ee3dbf0d78b566822f7eacd34bdd7b ]
    
    To minimize latency, PREEMPT_RT kernels expires hrtimers in preemptible
    softirq context by default. This can be overriden by marking the timer's
    expiry with HRTIMER_MODE_HARD.
    
    sched_clock_timer is missing this annotation: if its callback is preempted
    and the duration of the preemption exceeds the wrap around time of the
    underlying clocksource, sched clock will get out of sync.
    
    Mark the sched_clock_timer for expiry in hard interrupt context.

    debugfs: Check module state before warning in {full/open}_proxy_open()
    
    [ Upstream commit 275678e7a9be6a0ea9c1bb493e48abf2f4a01be5 ]
    
    When the module is being removed, the module state is set to
    MODULE_STATE_GOING. At this point, try_module_get() fails.
    And when {full/open}_proxy_open() is being called,
    it calls try_module_get() to try to hold module reference count.
    If it fails, it warns about the possibility of debugfs file leak.
    
    If {full/open}_proxy_open() is called while the module is being removed,
    it fails to hold the module.
    So, It warns about debugfs file leak. But it is not the debugfs file
    leak case. So, this patch just adds module state checking routine
    in the {full/open}_proxy_open().
    
    Test commands:
        #SHELL1
        while :
        do
            modprobe netdevsim
            echo 1 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device
            modprobe -rv netdevsim
        done
    
        #SHELL2
        while :
        do
            cat /sys/kernel/debug/netdevsim/netdevsim1/ports/0/ipsec

    [ Upstream commit e74d93e96d721c4297f2a900ad0191890d2fc2b0 ]
    
    Field bdi->io_pages added in commit 9491ae4aade6 ("mm: don't cap request
    size based on read-ahead setting") removes unneeded split of read requests.
    
    Stacked drivers do not call blk_queue_max_hw_sectors(). Instead they set
    limits of their devices by blk_set_stacking_limits() + disk_stack_limits().
    Field bio->io_pages stays zero until user set max_sectors_kb via sysfs.
    
    This patch updates io_pages after merging limits in disk_stack_limits().

    the same problem for device-mapper devices, this one fixes MD RAIDs.

    dma-mapping: Fix dma_pgprot() for unencrypted coherent pages
    
    [ Upstream commit 17c4a2ae15a7aaefe84bdb271952678c5c9cd8e1 ]
    
    When dma_mmap_coherent() sets up a mapping to unencrypted coherent memory
    under SEV encryption and sometimes under SME encryption, it will actually
    set up an encrypted mapping rather than an unencrypted, causing devices
    that DMAs from that memory to read encrypted contents. Fix this.
    
    When force_dma_unencrypted() returns true, the linear kernel map of the
    coherent pages have had the encryption bit explicitly cleared and the
    page content is unencrypted. Make sure that any additional PTEs we set
    up to these pages also have the encryption bit cleared by having
    dma_pgprot() return a protection with the encryption bit cleared in this
    case.

    x86: Don't let pgprot_modify() change the page encryption bit
    
    [ Upstream commit 6db73f17c5f155dbcfd5e48e621c706270b84df0 ]
    
    When SEV or SME is enabled and active, vm_get_page_prot() typically
    returns with the encryption bit set. This means that users of
    pgprot_modify(, vm_get_page_prot()) (mprotect_fixup(), do_mmap()) end up
    with a value of vma->vm_pg_prot that is not consistent with the intended
    protection of the PTEs.
    
    This is also important for fault handlers that rely on the VMA
    vm_page_prot to set the page protection. Fix this by not allowing
    pgprot_modify() to change the encryption bit, similar to how it's done
    for PAT bits.

    ACPI: EC: Do not clear boot_ec_is_ecdt in acpi_ec_add()
    
    [ Upstream commit 65a691f5f8f0bb63d6a82eec7b0ffd193d8d8a5f ]
    
    The reason for clearing boot_ec_is_ecdt in acpi_ec_add() (if a
    PNP0C09 device object matching the ECDT boot EC had been found in
    the namespace) was to cause acpi_ec_ecdt_start() to return early,
    but since the latter does not look at boot_ec_is_ecdt any more,
    acpi_ec_add() need not clear it.
    
    Moreover, doing that may be confusing as it may cause "DSDT" to be
    printed instead of "ECDT" in the EC initialization completion
    message, so stop doing it.
    
    While at it, split the EC initialization completion message into
    two messages, one regarding the boot EC and another one printed
    regardless of whether or not the EC at hand is the boot one.

    null_blk: fix spurious IO errors after failed past-wp access
    
    [ Upstream commit ff77042296d0a54535ddf74412c5ae92cb4ec76a ]
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    
            BLKRESETZONE zone 0
    
            // force EIO
            pwrite(fd, buf, 4096, 4096);
    
            [issue more IO including zone ioctls]
    
    It will start failing randomly including IO to unrelated zones because of
    ->error "reuse". Trigger can be partition detection as well if test is not
    run immediately which is even more entertaining.
    
    The fix is of course to clear ->error where necessary.

    firmware: arm_sdei: fix double-lock on hibernate with shared events
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ded0b61cf638bf9f8efe60ab8ba23db60ea9763 ]
    
    SDEI has private events that must be registered on each CPU. When
    CPUs come and go they must re-register and re-enable their private
    events. Each event has flags to indicate whether this should happen
    to protect against an event being registered on a CPU coming online,
    while all the others are unregistering the event.
    
    These flags are protected by the sdei_list_lock spinlock, because
    the cpuhp callbacks can't take the mutex.
    
    Hibernate needs to unregister all events, but keep the in-memory
    re-register and re-enable as they are. sdei_unregister_shared()
    takes the spinlock to walk the list, then calls _sdei_event_unregister()
    on each shared event. _sdei_event_unregister() tries to take the
    same spinlock to update re-register and re-enable. This doesn't go
    so well.
    
    Push the re-register and re-enable updates out to their callers.
    sdei_unregister_shared() doesn't want these values updated, so
    doesn't need to do anything.
    
    This also fixes shared events getting lost over hibernate as this
    path made them look unregistered.

    [ Upstream commit c50cc6dc6c48300af63a6fbc71b647053c15fc80 ]
    
    Some older MSM8916 Venus firmware versions also seem to indicate
    support for encoding HEVC, even though they really can't.
    This will lead to errors later because hfi_session_init() fails
    in this case.
    
    HEVC is already ignored for "dec_codecs", so add the same for
    "enc_codecs" to make these old firmware versions work correctly.

    cpufreq: imx6q: Fixes unwanted cpu overclocking on i.MX6ULL
    
    [ Upstream commit 36eb7dc1bd42fe5f850329c893768ff89b696fba ]
    
    imx6ul_opp_check_speed_grading is called for both i.MX6UL and i.MX6ULL.
    Since the i.MX6ULL was introduced to a separate ocotp compatible node
    later, it is possible that the i.MX6ULL has also dtbs with
    "fsl,imx6ull-ocotp". On a system without nvmem-cell speed grade a
    missing check on this node causes a driver fail without considering
    the cpu speed grade.
    
    This patch prevents unwanted cpu overclocking on i.MX6ULL with compatible
    node "fsl,imx6ull-ocotp" in old dtbs without nvmem-cell speed grade.

    selftests/net: add definition for SOL_DCCP to fix compilation errors for old libc
    
    [ Upstream commit 83a9b6f639e9f6b632337f9776de17d51d969c77 ]
    
    Many systems build/test up-to-date kernels with older libcs, and
    an older glibc (2.17) lacks the definition of SOL_DCCP in
    /usr/include/bits/socket.h (it was added in the 4.6 timeframe).
    
    Adding the definition to the test program avoids a compilation
    failure that gets in the way of building tools/testing/selftests/net.
    The test itself will work once the definition is added; either
    skipping due to DCCP not being configured in the kernel under test
    or passing, so there are no other more up-to-date glibc dependencies
    here it seems beyond that missing definition.

    rxrpc: Fix call interruptibility handling
    
    [ Upstream commit e138aa7d3271ac1b0690ae2c9b04d51468dce1d6 ]
    
    Fix the interruptibility of kernel-initiated client calls so that they're
    either only interruptible when they're waiting for a call slot to come
    available or they're not interruptible at all.  Either way, they're not
    interruptible during transmission.
    
    This should help prevent StoreData calls from being interrupted when
    writeback is in progress.  It doesn't, however, handle interruption during
    the receive phase.
    
    Userspace-initiated calls are still interruptable.  After the signal has
    been handled, sendmsg() will return the amount of data copied out of the
    buffer and userspace can perform another sendmsg() call to continue
    transmission.

    The above call stack is actually very similar to an issue
    reported by Commit eac9153f2b58 ("bpf/stackmap: Fix deadlock with
    rq_lock in bpf_get_stack()") by Song Liu. The only difference is
    bpf_send_signal() helper instead of bpf_get_stack() helper.
    
    The above deadlock is triggered with a perf_sw_event.
    Similar to Commit eac9153f2b58, the below almost identical reproducer
    used tracepoint point sched/sched_switch so the issue can be easily caught.

    The deadlock can be reproduced in our production system.
    
    Similar to Song's fix, the fix is to delay sending signal if
    irqs is disabled to avoid deadlocks involving with rq_lock.
    With this change, my above stress-test in our production system
    won't cause deadlock any more.
    
    I also implemented a scale-down version of reproducer in the
    selftest (a subsequent commit). With latest bpf-next,
    it complains for the following potential deadlock.

      Deadlock happens on CPU0 when it tries to acquire &sighand->siglock

      and cannot get it.
    
      This is not exactly the callstack in our production environment,
      but sympotom is similar and both locks are using spin_lock_irqsave()
      to acquire the lock, and both involves rq_lock. The fix to delay
      sending signal when irq is disabled also fixed this issue.

    Commit cd28d1d6e52e ("net: phy: at803x: Disable phy delay for RGMII mode")
    caused a regression for dm814x boards where NFSroot would no longer work.
    
    Let's fix the issue by configuring "rgmii-id" mode as internal delays are
    needed that is no longer the case with "rgmii" mode.

    bus: sunxi-rsb: Return correct data when mixing 16-bit and 8-bit reads
    
    [ Upstream commit a43ab30dcd4a1abcdd0d2461bf1cf7c0817f6cd3 ]
    
    When doing a 16-bit read that returns data in the MSB byte, the
    RSB_DATA register will keep the MSB byte unchanged when doing
    the following 8-bit read. sunxi_rsb_read() will then return
    a result that contains high byte from 16-bit read mixed with
    the 8-bit result.
    
    The consequence is that after this happens the PMIC's regmap will
    look like this: (0x33 is the high byte from the 16-bit read)
    
    % cat /sys/kernel/debug/regmap/sunxi-rsb-3a3/registers
    00: 33
    01: 33
    02: 33
    03: 33
    04: 33
    05: 33
    06: 33
    07: 33
    08: 33
    09: 33
    0a: 33
    0b: 33
    0c: 33
    0d: 33
    0e: 33
    [snip]
    
    Fix this by masking the result of the read with the correct mask
    based on the size of the read. There are no 16-bit users in the
    mainline kernel, so this doesn't need to get into the stable tree.
