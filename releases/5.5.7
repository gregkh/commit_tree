    bpf: Selftests build error in sockmap_basic.c
    
    commit f2e97dc126b712c0d21219ed0c42710006c1cf52 upstream.
    
    Fix following build error. We could push a tcp.h header into one of the
    include paths, but I think its easy enough to simply pull in the three
    defines we need here. If we end up using more of tcp.h at some point
    we can pull it in later.

    net/mlx5e: Fix crash in recovery flow without devlink reporter
    
    commit 1ad6c43c6a7b8627240c6cc19c69e31fedc596a7 upstream.
    
    When health reporters are not supported, recovery function is invoked
    directly, not via devlink health reporters.
    
    In this direct flow, the recover function input parameter was passed
    incorrectly and is causing a kernel oops. This patch is fixing the input
    parameter.
    
    Following call trace is observed on rx error health reporting.

    2. User at the same time change the switchdev mode via devlink netlink
    interface.
    
    Case 1 cannot happen because rtnl executes one message in order.
    Case 2 can happen but we do not expect user to change the switchdev mode
    when changing vepa. Even if a user does it, so he will read a value
    which is no longer valid.

    xen_do_hypervisor_callback with interrupts disabled.
    
    _cond_resched() evades the might_sleep() check in cond_resched() which

    rxrpc: Fix call RCU cleanup using non-bh-safe locks
    
    commit 963485d436ccc2810177a7b08af22336ec2af67b upstream.
    
    rxrpc_rcu_destroy_call(), which is called as an RCU callback to clean up a
    put call, calls rxrpc_put_connection() which, deep in its bowels, takes a
    number of spinlocks in a non-BH-safe way, including rxrpc_conn_id_lock and
    local->client_conns_lock.  RCU callbacks, however, are normally called from
    softirq context, which can cause lockdep to notice the locking
    inconsistency.
    
    To get lockdep to detect this, it's necessary to have the connection
    cleaned up on the put at the end of the last of its calls, though normally
    the clean up is deferred.  This can be induced, however, by starting a call
    on an AF_RXRPC socket and then closing the socket without reading the
    reply.
    
    Fix this by having rxrpc_rcu_destroy_call() punt the destruction to a
    workqueue if in softirq-mode and defer the destruction to process context.
    
    Note that another way to fix this could be to add a bunch of bh-disable
    annotations to the spinlocks concerned - and there might be more than just
    those two - but that means spending more time with BHs disabled.
    
    Note also that some of these places were covered by bh-disable spinlocks
    belonging to the rxrpc_transport object, but these got removed without the
    _bh annotation being retained on the next lock in.

    ALSA: seq: Fix concurrent access to queue current tick/time
    
    commit dc7497795e014d84699c3b8809ed6df35352dd74 upstream.
    
    snd_seq_check_queue() passes the current tick and time of the given
    queue as a pointer to snd_seq_prioq_cell_out(), but those might be
    updated concurrently by the seq timer update.
    
    Fix it by retrieving the current tick and time via the proper helper
    functions at first, and pass those values to snd_seq_prioq_cell_out()
    later in the loops.
    
    snd_seq_timer_get_cur_time() takes a new argument and adjusts with the
    current system time only when it's requested so; this update isn't
    needed for snd_seq_check_queue(), as it's called either from the
    interrupt handler or right after queuing.
    
    Also, snd_seq_timer_get_cur_tick() is changed to read the value in the
    spinlock for the concurrency, too.

    ALSA: seq: Avoid concurrent access to queue flags
    
    commit bb51e669fa49feb5904f452b2991b240ef31bc97 upstream.
    
    The queue flags are represented in bit fields and the concurrent
    access may result in unexpected results.  Although the current code
    should be mostly OK as it's only reading a field while writing other
    fields as KCSAN reported, it's safer to cover both with a proper
    spinlock protection.
    
    This patch fixes the possible concurrent read by protecting with
    q->owner_lock.  Also the queue owner field is protected as well since
    it's the field to be protected by the lock itself.

    ALSA: rawmidi: Avoid bit fields for state flags
    
    commit dfa9a5efe8b932a84b3b319250aa3ac60c20f876 upstream.
    
    The rawmidi state flags (opened, append, active_sensing) are stored in
    bit fields that can be potentially racy when concurrently accessed
    without any locks.  Although the current code should be fine, there is
    also no any real benefit by keeping the bitfields for this kind of
    short number of members.
    
    This patch changes those bit fields flags to the simple bool fields.
    There should be no size increase of the snd_rawmidi_substream by this
    change.

    dma-direct: relax addressability checks in dma_direct_supported
    
    commit 91ef26f914171cf753330f13724fd9142b5b1640 upstream.
    
    dma_direct_supported tries to find the minimum addressable bitmask
    based on the end pfn and optional magic that architectures can use
    to communicate the size of the magic ZONE_DMA that can be used
    for bounce buffering.  But between the DMA offsets that can change
    per device (or sometimes even region), the fact the ZONE_DMA isn't
    even guaranteed to be the lowest addresses and failure of having
    proper interfaces to the MM code this fails at least for one
    arm subarchitecture.
    
    As all the legacy DMA implementations have supported 32-bit DMA
    masks, and 32-bit masks are guranteed to always work by the API
    contract (using bounce buffers if needed), we can short cut the
    complicated check and always return true without breaking existing
    assumptions.  Hopefully we can properly clean up the interaction
    with the arch defined zones and the bootmem allocator eventually.

    io_uring: fix __io_iopoll_check deadlock in io_sq_thread
    
    commit c7849be9cc2dd2754c48ddbaca27c2de6d80a95d upstream.
    
    Since commit a3a0e43fd770 ("io_uring: don't enter poll loop if we have
    CQEs pending"), if we already events pending, we won't enter poll loop.
    In case SETUP_IOPOLL and SETUP_SQPOLL are both enabled, if app has
    been terminated and don't reap pending events which are already in cq
    ring, and there are some reqs in poll_list, io_sq_thread will enter
    __io_iopoll_check(), and find pending events, then return, this loop
    will never have a chance to exit.
    
    I have seen this issue in fio stress tests, to fix this issue, let
    io_sq_thread call io_iopoll_getevents() with argument 'min' being zero,
    and remove __io_iopoll_check().

    io_uring: prevent sq_thread from spinning when it should stop
    
    commit 7143b5ac5750f404ff3a594b34fdf3fc2f99f828 upstream.
    
    This patch drops 'cur_mm' before calling cond_resched(), to prevent
    the sq_thread from spinning even when the user process is finished.
    
    Before this patch, if the user process ended without closing the
    io_uring fd, the sq_thread continues to spin until the
    'sq_thread_idle' timeout ends.
    
    In the worst case where the 'sq_thread_idle' parameter is bigger than
    INT_MAX, the sq_thread will spin forever.

    scripts/get_maintainer.pl: deprioritize old Fixes: addresses
    
    commit 0ef82fcefb99300ede6f4d38a8100845b2dc8e30 upstream.
    
    Recently, I found that get_maintainer was causing me to send emails to
    the old addresses for maintainers.  Since I usually just trust the
    output of get_maintainer to know the right email address, I didn't even
    look carefully and fired off two patch series that went to the wrong
    place.  Oops.
    
    The problem was introduced recently when trying to add signatures from
    Fixes.  The problem was that these email addresses were added too early
    in the process of compiling our list of places to send.  Things added to
    the list earlier are considered more canonical and when we later added
    maintainer entries we ended up deduplicating to the old address.
    
    Here are two examples using mainline commits (to make it easier to
    replicate) for the two maintainers that I messed up recently:
    
      $ git format-patch d8549bcd0529~..d8549bcd0529
      $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-clk-Add-clk_hw*.patch | grep Boyd
      Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>...
    
      $ git format-patch 6d1238aa3395~..6d1238aa3395
      $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-arm64-dts-qcom-qcs404*.patch | grep Andy
      Andy Gross <andy.gross@linaro.org>
    
    Let's move the adding of addresses from Fixes: to the end since the
    email addresses from these are much more likely to be older.
    
    After this patch the above examples get the right addresses for the two
    examples.

    arm64: lse: Fix LSE atomics with LLVM
    
    commit dd1f6308b28edf0452dd5dc7877992903ec61e69 upstream.
    
    Commit e0d5896bd356 ("arm64: lse: fix LSE atomics with LLVM's integrated
    assembler") broke the build when clang is used in connjunction with the
    binutils assembler ("-no-integrated-as"). This happens because
    __LSE_PREAMBLE is defined as ".arch armv8-a+lse", which overrides the
    version of the CPU architecture passed via the "-march" paramter to gas:
    
    $ aarch64-none-linux-gnu-as -EL -I ./arch/arm64/include
                                    -I ./arch/arm64/include/generated
                                    -I ./include -I ./include
                                    -I ./arch/arm64/include/uapi
                                    -I ./arch/arm64/include/generated/uapi
                                    -I ./include/uapi -I ./include/generated/uapi
                                    -I ./init -I ./init
                                    -march=armv8.3-a -o init/do_mounts.o
                                    /tmp/do_mounts-d7992a.s
    /tmp/do_mounts-d7992a.s: Assembler messages:
    /tmp/do_mounts-d7992a.s:1959: Error: selected processor does not support `autiasp'

    /tmp/do_mounts-d7992a.s:2494: Error: selected processor does not support `autiasp'
    
    Fix the issue by replacing ".arch armv8-a+lse" with ".arch_extension lse".
    Sami confirms that the clang integrated assembler does now support the
    '.arch_extension' directive, so this change will be fine even for LTO
    builds in future.

    genirq/proc: Reject invalid affinity masks (again)
    
    commit cba6437a1854fde5934098ec3bd0ee83af3129f5 upstream.
    
    Qian Cai reported that the WARN_ON() in the x86/msi affinity setting code,
    which catches cases where the affinity setting is not done on the CPU which
    is the current target of the interrupt, triggers during CPU hotplug stress
    testing.
    
    It turns out that the warning which was added with the commit addressing
    the MSI affinity race unearthed yet another long standing bug.
    
    If user space writes a bogus affinity mask, i.e. it contains no online CPUs,
    then it calls irq_select_affinity_usr(). This was introduced for ALPHA in
    
      eee45269b0f5 ("[PATCH] Alpha: convert to generic irq framework (generic part)")
    
    and subsequently made available for all architectures in
    
      18404756765c ("genirq: Expose default irq affinity mask (take 3)")
    
    which introduced the circumvention of the affinity setting restrictions for
    interrupt which cannot be moved in process context.
    
    The whole exercise is bogus in various aspects:
    
      1) If the interrupt is already started up then there is absolutely
         no point to honour a bogus interrupt affinity setting from user
         space. The interrupt is already assigned to an online CPU and it
         does not make any sense to reassign it to some other randomly
         chosen online CPU.
    
      2) If the interupt is not yet started up then there is no point
         either. A subsequent startup of the interrupt will invoke
         irq_setup_affinity() anyway which will chose a valid target CPU.
    
    So the only correct solution is to just return -EINVAL in case user space
    wrote an affinity mask which does not contain any online CPUs, except for
    ALPHA which has it's own magic sauce for this.

    commit 6a30e1b1dcad0ba94fae757f797812d7d8dcb72c upstream.
    
    The name sm3-256 is defined in hash_algo_name in hash_info, but the
    algorithm name implemented in sm3_generic.c is sm3, which will cause
    the sm3-256 algorithm to be not found in some application scenarios of
    the hash algorithm, and an ENOENT error will occur. For example,
    IMA, keys, and other subsystems that reference hash_algo_name all use
    the hash algorithm of sm3.

    commit 8ae9a588ca35eb9c32dc03299c5e1f4a1e9a9617 upstream.
    
    Currently the rtw_sprintf prints the contents of thread_name
    onto thread_name and this can lead to a potential copy of a
    string over itself. Avoid this by printing the literal string RTWHALXT
    instread of the contents of thread_name.

    usb: gadget: composite: Fix bMaxPower for SuperSpeedPlus
    
    commit c724417baf162bd3e035659e22cdf990cfb0d917 upstream.
    
    SuperSpeedPlus peripherals must report their bMaxPower of the
    configuration descriptor in units of 8mA as per the USB 3.2
    specification. The current switch statement in encode_bMaxPower()
    only checks for USB_SPEED_SUPER but not USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS so
    the latter falls back to USB 2.0 encoding which uses 2mA units.
    Replace the switch with a simple if/else.

    drm/i915/gem: Require per-engine reset support for non-persistent contexts
    
    commit dea8d5ce46d7e7f7270b9804df7d1174f88bfd99 upstream.
    
    To enable non-persistent contexts, we require a means of cancelling any
    inflight work from that context. This is first done "gracefully" by
    using preemption to kick the active context off the engine, and then
    forcefully by resetting the engine if it is active. If we are unable to
    reset the engine to remove hostile userspace, we should not allow
    userspace to opt into using non-persistent contexts.
    
    If the per-engine reset fails, we still do a full GPU reset, but that is
    rare and usually indicative of much deeper issues. The damage is already
    done. However, the goal of the interface to allow long running compute
    jobs without causing collateral damage elsewhere, and if we are unable
    to support that we should make that known by not providing the
    interface (and falsely pretending we can).

    drm/bridge: tc358767: fix poll timeouts
    
    commit 8a6483ac634acda3f599f50082c652d2d37199c7 upstream.
    
    Link training fails with:
    
      Link training timeout waiting for LT_LOOPDONE!
      main link enable error: -110
    
    This is caused by too tight timeouts, which were changed recently in
    aa92213f388b ("drm/bridge: tc358767: Simplify polling in tc_link_training()").
    
    With a quick glance, the commit does not change the timeouts. However,
    the method of delaying/sleeping is different, and as the timeout in the
    previous implementation was not explicit, the new version in practice
    has much tighter timeout.
    
    The same change was made to other parts in the driver, but the link
    training timeout is the only one I have seen causing issues.
    Nevertheless, 1 us sleep is not very sane, and the timeouts look pretty
    tight, so lets fix all the timeouts.
    
    One exception was the aux busy poll, where the poll sleep was much
    longer than necessary (or optimal).
    
    I measured the times on my setup, and now the sleep times are set to
    such values that they result in multiple loops, but not too many (say,
    5-10 loops). The timeouts were all increased to 100ms, which should be
    more than enough for all of these, but in case of bad errors, shouldn't
    stop the driver as multi-second timeouts could do.

    Btrfs: fix deadlock during fast fsync when logging prealloc extents beyond eof
    
    commit a5ae50dea9111db63d30d700766dd5509602f7ad upstream.
    
    While logging the prealloc extents of an inode during a fast fsync we call
    btrfs_truncate_inode_items(), through btrfs_log_prealloc_extents(), while
    holding a read lock on a leaf of the inode's root (not the log root, the
    fs/subvol root), and then that function locks the file range in the inode's
    iotree. This can lead to a deadlock when:
    
    * the fsync is ranged
    
    * the file has prealloc extents beyond eof
    
    * writeback for a range different from the fsync range starts
      during the fsync
    
    * the size of the file is not sector size aligned
    
    Because when finishing an ordered extent we lock first a file range and
    then try to COW the fs/subvol tree to insert an extent item.
    
    The following diagram shows how the deadlock can happen.
    
               CPU 1                                        CPU 2
    
      btrfs_sync_file()
        --> for range [0, 1MiB)
    
        --> inode has a size of
            1MiB and has 1 prealloc
            extent beyond the
            i_size, starting at offset
            4MiB
    
        flushes all delalloc for the
        range [0MiB, 1MiB) and waits
        for the respective ordered
        extents to complete
    
                                                  --> before task at CPU 1 locks the
                                                      inode, a write into file range

    So fix this by making btrfs_truncate_inode_items() not lock the range in
    the inode's iotree when the target root is a log root, since it's not
    needed to lock the range for log roots as the protection from the inode's
    lock and log_mutex are all that's needed.

    Btrfs: fix btrfs_wait_ordered_range() so that it waits for all ordered extents
    
    commit e75fd33b3f744f644061a4f9662bd63f5434f806 upstream.
    
    In btrfs_wait_ordered_range() once we find an ordered extent that has
    finished with an error we exit the loop and don't wait for any other
    ordered extents that might be still in progress.
    
    All the users of btrfs_wait_ordered_range() expect that there are no more
    ordered extents in progress after that function returns. So past fixes
    such like the ones from the two following commits:
    
      ff612ba7849964 ("btrfs: fix panic during relocation after ENOSPC before
                       writeback happens")
    
      28aeeac1dd3080 ("Btrfs: fix panic when starting bg cache writeout after
                       IO error")
    
    don't work when there are multiple ordered extents in the range.
    
    Fix that by making btrfs_wait_ordered_range() wait for all ordered extents
    even after it finds one that had an error.

    btrfs: do not check delayed items are empty for single transaction cleanup
    
    commit 1e90315149f3fe148e114a5de86f0196d1c21fa5 upstream.
    
    btrfs_assert_delayed_root_empty() will check if the delayed root is
    completely empty, but this is a filesystem-wide check.  On cleanup we
    may have allowed other transactions to begin, for whatever reason, and
    thus the delayed root is not empty.
    
    So remove this check from cleanup_one_transation().  This however can
    stay in btrfs_cleanup_transaction(), because it checks only after all of
    the transactions have been properly cleaned up, and thus is valid.

    btrfs: reset fs_root to NULL on error in open_ctree
    
    commit 315bf8ef914f31d51d084af950703aa1e09a728c upstream.
    
    While running my error injection script I hit a panic when we tried to
    clean up the fs_root when freeing the fs_root.  This is because
    fs_info->fs_root == PTR_ERR(-EIO), which isn't great.  Fix this by
    setting fs_info->fs_root = NULL; if we fail to read the root.

    btrfs: fix bytes_may_use underflow in prealloc error condtition
    
    commit b778cf962d71a0e737923d55d0432f3bd287258e upstream.
    
    I hit the following warning while running my error injection stress
    testing:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 1453 at fs/btrfs/space-info.h:108 btrfs_free_reserved_data_space_noquota+0xfd/0x160 [btrfs]

    This happens if we fail to insert our reserved file extent.  At this
    point we've already converted our reservation from ->bytes_may_use to
    ->bytes_reserved.  However once we break we will attempt to free
    everything from [cur_offset, end] from ->bytes_may_use, but our extent
    reservation will overlap part of this.
    
    Fix this problem by adding ins.offset (our extent allocation size) to
    cur_offset so we remove the actual remaining part from ->bytes_may_use.
    
    I validated this fix using my inject-error.py script
    
    python inject-error.py -o should_fail_bio -t cache_save_setup -t \
            __btrfs_prealloc_file_range \
            -t insert_reserved_file_extent.constprop.0 \
            -r "-5" ./run-fsstress.sh
    
    where run-fsstress.sh simply mounts and runs fsstress on a disk.

    btrfs: destroy qgroup extent records on transaction abort
    
    commit 81f7eb00ff5bb8326e82503a32809421d14abb8a upstream.
    
    We clean up the delayed references when we abort a transaction but we
    leave the pending qgroup extent records behind, leaking memory.
    
    This patch destroys the extent records when we destroy the delayed refs
    and makes sure ensure they're gone before releasing the transaction.

    crypto: chacha20poly1305 - prevent integer overflow on large input
    
    commit c9cc0517bba9f0213f1e55172feceb99e5512daf upstream.
    
    This code assigns src_len (size_t) to sl (int), which causes problems
    when src_len is very large. Probably nobody in the kernel should be
    passing this much data to chacha20poly1305 all in one go anyway, so I
    don't think we need to change the algorithm or introduce larger types
    or anything. But we should at least error out early in this case and
    print a warning so that we get reports if this does happen and can look
    into why anybody is possibly passing it that much data or if they're
    accidently passing -1 or similar.

    KVM: nVMX: clear PIN_BASED_POSTED_INTR from nested pinbased_ctls only when apicv is globally disabled
    
    commit a4443267800af240072280c44521caab61924e55 upstream.
    
    When apicv is disabled on a vCPU (e.g. by enabling KVM_CAP_HYPERV_SYNIC*),
    nothing happens to VMX MSRs on the already existing vCPUs, however, all new
    ones are created with PIN_BASED_POSTED_INTR filtered out. This is very
    confusing and results in the following picture inside the guest:
    
    $ rdmsr -ax 0x48d
    ff00000016
    7f00000016
    7f00000016
    7f00000016
    
    This is observed with QEMU and 4-vCPU guest: QEMU creates vCPU0, does
    KVM_CAP_HYPERV_SYNIC2 and then creates the remaining three.
    
    L1 hypervisor may only check CPU0's controls to find out what features
    are available and it will be very confused later. Switch to setting
    PIN_BASED_POSTED_INTR control based on global 'enable_apicv' setting.

    drm/i915/execlists: Always force a context reload when rewinding RING_TAIL
    
    commit b1339ecac661e1cf3e1dc78ac56bff3aeeaeb92c upstream.
    
    If we rewind the RING_TAIL on a context, due to a preemption event, we
    must force the context restore for the RING_TAIL update to be properly
    handled. Rather than note which preemption events may cause us to rewind
    the tail, compare the new request's tail with the previously submitted
    RING_TAIL, as it turns out that timeslicing was causing unexpected
    rewinds.

    ext4: fix race between writepages and enabling EXT4_EXTENTS_FL
    
    commit cb85f4d23f794e24127f3e562cb3b54b0803f456 upstream.
    
    If EXT4_EXTENTS_FL is set on an inode while ext4_writepages() is running
    on it, the following warning in ext4_add_complete_io() can be hit:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at fs/ext4/page-io.c:234 ext4_put_io_end_defer+0xf0/0x120
    
    Here's a minimal reproducer (not 100% reliable) (root isn't required):
    
            while true; do
                    sync
            done &
            while true; do
                    rm -f file
                    touch file
                    chattr -e file
                    echo X >> file
                    chattr +e file
            done
    
    The problem is that in ext4_writepages(), ext4_should_dioread_nolock()
    (which only returns true on extent-based files) is checked once to set
    the number of reserved journal credits, and also again later to select
    the flags for ext4_map_blocks() and copy the reserved journal handle to
    ext4_io_end::handle.  But if EXT4_EXTENTS_FL is being concurrently set,
    the first check can see dioread_nolock disabled while the later one can
    see it enabled, causing the reserved handle to unexpectedly be NULL.
    
    Since changing EXT4_EXTENTS_FL is uncommon, and there may be other races
    related to doing so as well, fix this by synchronizing changing
    EXT4_EXTENTS_FL with ext4_writepages() via the existing
    s_writepages_rwsem (previously called s_journal_flag_rwsem).
    
    This was originally reported by syzbot without a reproducer at
    https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=2202a584a00fffd19fbf,
    but now that dioread_nolock is the default I also started seeing this
    when running syzkaller locally.

    ext4: fix potential race between s_flex_groups online resizing and access
    
    commit 7c990728b99ed6fbe9c75fc202fce1172d9916da upstream.
    
    During an online resize an array of s_flex_groups structures gets replaced
    so it can get enlarged. If there is a concurrent access to the array and
    this memory has been reused then this can lead to an invalid memory access.
    
    The s_flex_group array has been converted into an array of pointers rather
    than an array of structures. This is to ensure that the information
    contained in the structures cannot get out of sync during a resize due to
    an accessor updating the value in the old structure after it has been
    copied but before the array pointer is updated. Since the structures them-
    selves are no longer copied but only the pointers to them this case is
    mitigated.

    allocation or deallocation which uses the old array, and the old array
    has gotten reused this can lead to a GPF or some other random kernel
    memory getting modified.

    ext4: add cond_resched() to __ext4_find_entry()
    
    commit 9424ef56e13a1f14c57ea161eed3ecfdc7b2770e upstream.
    
    We tested a soft lockup problem in linux 4.19 which could also
    be found in linux 5.x.
    
    When dir inode takes up a large number of blocks, and if the
    directory is growing when we are searching, it's possible the
    restart branch could be called many times, and the do while loop
    could hold cpu a long time.
    
    Here is the call trace in linux 4.19.

    KVM: x86: don't notify userspace IOAPIC on edge-triggered interrupt EOI

    Commit 13db77347db1 ("KVM: x86: don't notify userspace IOAPIC on edge

    that IOAPIC isn't notified on EOI. And var level indicates level-triggered
    interrupt.
    But commit 3159d36ad799 ("KVM: x86: use generic function for MSI parsing")
    replace var level with irq.level by mistake. Fix it by changing irq.level
    to irq.trig_mode.

        Let's use PF_NO_COMPOUND here.
    
    drm_pci_alloc has been declared broken since it mixes GFP_COMP and

    drm/nouveau/kms/gv100-: Re-set LUT after clearing for modesets
    
    commit f287d3d19769b1d22cba4e51fa0487f2697713c9 upstream.
    
    While certain modeset operations on gv100+ need us to temporarily
    disable the LUT, we make the mistake of sometimes neglecting to
    reprogram the LUT after such modesets. In particular, moving a head from
    one encoder to another seems to trigger this quite often. GV100+ is very
    picky about having a LUT in most scenarios, so this causes the display
    engine to hang with the following error code:
    
    disp: chid 1 stat 00005080 reason 5 [INVALID_STATE] mthd 0200 data
    00000001 code 0000002d)
    
    So, fix this by always re-programming the LUT if we're clearing it in a
    state where the wndw is still visible, and has a XLUT handle programmed.

    mm: Avoid creating virtual address aliases in brk()/mmap()/mremap()
    
    commit dcde237319e626d1ec3c9d8b7613032f0fd4663a upstream.
    
    Currently the arm64 kernel ignores the top address byte passed to brk(),
    mmap() and mremap(). When the user is not aware of the 56-bit address
    limit or relies on the kernel to return an error, untagging such
    pointers has the potential to create address aliases in user-space.
    Passing a tagged address to munmap(), madvise() is permitted since the
    tagged pointer is expected to be inside an existing mapping.
    
    The current behaviour breaks the existing glibc malloc() implementation
    which relies on brk() with an address beyond 56-bit to be rejected by
    the kernel.
    
    Remove untagging in the above functions by partially reverting commit
    ce18d171cb73 ("mm: untag user pointers in mmap/munmap/mremap/brk"). In
    addition, update the arm64 tagged-address-abi.rst document accordingly.

    commit 305e519ce48e935702c32241f07d393c3c8fed3e upstream.
    
    Walter Wu has reported a potential case in which init_stack_slab() is
    called after stack_slabs[STACK_ALLOC_MAX_SLABS - 1] has already been
    initialized.  In that case init_stack_slab() will overwrite
    stack_slabs[STACK_ALLOC_MAX_SLABS], which may result in a memory

    mm/sparsemem: pfn_to_page is not valid yet on SPARSEMEM
    
    commit 18e19f195cd888f65643a77a0c6aee8f5be6439a upstream.
    
    When we use SPARSEMEM instead of SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP, pfn_to_page()
    doesn't work before sparse_init_one_section() is called.
    
    This leads to a crash when hotplug memory:

    SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=y.

    mm/vmscan.c: don't round up scan size for online memory cgroup
    
    commit 76073c646f5f4999d763f471df9e38a5a912d70d upstream.
    
    Commit 68600f623d69 ("mm: don't miss the last page because of round-off
    error") makes the scan size round up to @denominator regardless of the
    memory cgroup's state, online or offline.  This affects the overall
    reclaiming behavior: the corresponding LRU list is eligible for
    reclaiming only when its size logically right shifted by @sc->priority
    is bigger than zero in the former formula.
    
    For example, the inactive anonymous LRU list should have at least 0x4000
    pages to be eligible for reclaiming when we have 60/12 for
    swappiness/priority and without taking scan/rotation ratio into account.
    
    After the roundup is applied, the inactive anonymous LRU list becomes
    eligible for reclaiming when its size is bigger than or equal to 0x1000
    in the same condition.
    
        (0x4000 >> 12) * 60 / (60 + 140 + 1) = 1
        ((0x1000 >> 12) * 60) + 200) / (60 + 140 + 1) = 1
    
    aarch64 has 512MB huge page size when the base page size is 64KB.  The
    memory cgroup that has a huge page is always eligible for reclaiming in
    that case.
    
    The reclaiming is likely to stop after the huge page is reclaimed,
    meaing the further iteration on @sc->priority and the silbing and child
    memory cgroups will be skipped.  The overall behaviour has been changed.
    This fixes the issue by applying the roundup to offlined memory cgroups
    only, to give more preference to reclaim memory from offlined memory
    cgroup.  It sounds reasonable as those memory is unlikedly to be used by
    anyone.
    
    The issue was found by starting up 8 VMs on a Ampere Mustang machine,
    which has 8 CPUs and 16 GB memory.  Each VM is given with 2 vCPUs and
    2GB memory.  It took 264 seconds for all VMs to be completely up and
    784MB swap is consumed after that.  With this patch applied, it took 236
    seconds and 60MB swap to do same thing.  So there is 10% performance
    improvement for my case.  Note that KSM is disable while THP is enabled
    in the testing.

    commit 2546287c5fb363a0165933ae2181c92f03e701d0 upstream.
    
    This was noticed when printing debugfs for MSIs on my ARM64 server.  The
    new dstate IRQD_MSI_NOMASK_QUIRK came out surprisingly while it should only
    be the x86 stuff for the time being...
    
    The new MSI quirk flag uses the same bit as IRQ_DOMAIN_NAME_ALLOCATED which
    is oddly defined as bit 6 for no good reason.
    
    Switch it to the non used bit 1.

    nvme_mpath_init() is called by nvme_init_identify() which is called in
    multiple places (nvme_reset_work(), nvme_passthru_end(), etc). This
    means nvme_mpath_init() may be called multiple times before
    nvme_mpath_uninit() (which is only called on nvme_free_ctrl()).
    
    When nvme_mpath_init() is called multiple times, it overwrites the
    ana_log_buf pointer with a new allocation, thus leaking the previous
    allocation.
    
    To fix this, free ana_log_buf before allocating a new one.

    Revert "ipc,sem: remove uneeded sem_undo_list lock usage in exit_sem()"
    
    commit edf28f4061afe4c2d9eb1c3323d90e882c1d6800 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit a97955844807e327df11aa33869009d14d6b7de0.
    
    Commit a97955844807 ("ipc,sem: remove uneeded sem_undo_list lock usage
    in exit_sem()") removes a lock that is needed.  This leads to a process
    looping infinitely in exit_sem() and can also lead to a crash.  There is
    a reproducer available in [1] and with the commit reverted the issue
    does not reproduce anymore.
    
    Using the reproducer found in [1] is fairly easy to reach a point where
    one of the child processes is looping infinitely in exit_sem between
    for(;;) and if (semid == -1) block, while it's trying to free its last
    sem_undo structure which has already been freed by freeary().
    
    Each sem_undo struct is on two lists: one per semaphore set (list_id)
    and one per process (list_proc).  The list_id list tracks undos by
    semaphore set, and the list_proc by process.
    
    Undo structures are removed either by freeary() or by exit_sem().  The
    freeary function is invoked when the user invokes a syscall to remove a
    semaphore set.  During this operation freeary() traverses the list_id
    associated with the semaphore set and removes the undo structures from
    both the list_id and list_proc lists.
    
    For this case, exit_sem() is called at process exit.  Each process
    contains a struct sem_undo_list (referred to as "ulp") which contains
    the head for the list_proc list.  When the process exits, exit_sem()
    traverses this list to remove each sem_undo struct.  As in freeary(),
    whenever a sem_undo struct is removed from list_proc, it is also removed
    from the list_id list.
    
    Removing elements from list_id is safe for both exit_sem() and freeary()
    due to sem_lock().  Removing elements from list_proc is not safe;
    freeary() locks &un->ulp->lock when it performs
    list_del_rcu(&un->list_proc) but exit_sem() does not (locking was
    removed by commit a97955844807 ("ipc,sem: remove uneeded sem_undo_list
    lock usage in exit_sem()").
    
    This can result in the following situation while executing the
    reproducer [1] : Consider a child process in exit_sem() and the parent
    in freeary() (because of semctl(sid[i], NSEM, IPC_RMID)).
    
     - The list_proc for the child contains the last two undo structs A and
       B (the rest have been removed either by exit_sem() or freeary()).
    
     - The semid for A is 1 and semid for B is 2.
    
     - exit_sem() removes A and at the same time freeary() removes B.
    
     - Since A and B have different semid sem_lock() will acquire different
       locks for each process and both can proceed.
    
    The bug is that they remove A and B from the same list_proc at the same
    time because only freeary() acquires the ulp lock. When exit_sem()
    removes A it makes ulp->list_proc.next to point at B and at the same
    time freeary() removes B setting B->semid=-1.
    
    At the next iteration of for(;;) loop exit_sem() will try to remove B.
    
    The only way to break from for(;;) is for (&un->list_proc ==
    &ulp->list_proc) to be true which is not. Then exit_sem() will check if
    B->semid=-1 which is and will continue looping in for(;;) until the
    memory for B is reallocated and the value at B->semid is changed.
    
    At that point, exit_sem() will crash attempting to unlink B from the
    lists (this can be easily triggered by running the reproducer [1] a
    second time).
    
    To prove this scenario instrumentation was added to keep information
    about each sem_undo (un) struct that is removed per process and per
    semaphore set (sma).
    
              CPU0                                CPU1
      [caller holds sem_lock(sma for A)]      ...
      freeary()                               exit_sem()
      ...                                     ...
      ...                                     sem_lock(sma for B)
      spin_lock(A->ulp->lock)                 ...
      list_del_rcu(un_A->list_proc)           list_del_rcu(un_B->list_proc)
    
    Undo structures A and B have different semid and sem_lock() operations
    proceed.  However they belong to the same list_proc list and they are
    removed at the same time.  This results into ulp->list_proc.next
    pointing to the address of B which is already removed.
    
    After reverting commit a97955844807 ("ipc,sem: remove uneeded
    sem_undo_list lock usage in exit_sem()") the issue was no longer
    reproducible.

    ACPI: PM: s2idle: Check fixed wakeup events in acpi_s2idle_wake()
    
    commit 63fb9623427fbb44e3782233b6e4714057b76ff2 upstream.
    
    Commit fdde0ff8590b ("ACPI: PM: s2idle: Prevent spurious SCIs from
    waking up the system") overlooked the fact that fixed events can wake
    up the system too and broke RTC wakeup from suspend-to-idle as a
    result.
    
    Fix this issue by checking the fixed events in acpi_s2idle_wake() in
    addition to checking wakeup GPEs and break out of the suspend-to-idle
    loop if the status bits of any enabled fixed events are set then.

    serdev: ttyport: restore client ops on deregistration
    
    commit 0c5aae59270fb1f827acce182786094c9ccf598e upstream.
    
    The serdev tty-port controller driver should reset the tty-port client
    operations also on deregistration to avoid a NULL-pointer dereference in
    case the port is later re-registered as a normal tty device.
    
    Note that this can only happen with tty drivers such as 8250 which have
    statically allocated port structures that can end up being reused and
    where a later registration would not register a serdev controller (e.g.
    due to registration errors or if the devicetree has been changed in
    between).
    
    Specifically, this can be an issue for any statically defined ports that
    would be registered by 8250 core when an 8250 driver is being unbound.

    RX cancel command fails when BT is switched on and off multiple times.
    
    To handle this, poll for the cancel bit in SE_GENI_S_IRQ_STATUS register

    tty: serial: imx: setup the correct sg entry for tx dma
    
    commit f76707831829530ffdd3888bebc108aecefccaa0 upstream.
    
    There has oops as below happen on i.MX8MP EVK platform that has
    6G bytes DDR memory.
    
    when (xmit->tail < xmit->head) && (xmit->head == 0),
    it setups one sg entry with sg->length is zero:
            sg_set_buf(sgl + 1, xmit->buf, xmit->head);
    
    if xmit->buf is allocated from >4G address space, and SDMA only
    support <4G address space, then dma_map_sg() will call swiotlb_map()
    to do bounce buffer copying and mapping.
    
    But swiotlb_map() don't allow sg entry's length is zero, otherwise
    report BUG_ON().
    
    So the patch is to correct the tx DMA scatter list.
    
    Oops:

    serial: 8250: Check UPF_IRQ_SHARED in advance
    
    commit 7febbcbc48fc92e3f33863b32ed715ba4aff18c4 upstream.
    
    The commit 54e53b2e8081
      ("tty: serial: 8250: pass IRQ shared flag to UART ports")
    nicely explained the problem:
    
    ---8<---8<---
    
    On some systems IRQ lines between multiple UARTs might be shared. If so, the
    irqflags have to be configured accordingly. The reason is: The 8250 port startup
    code performs IRQ tests *before* the IRQ handler for that particular port is
    registered. This is performed in serial8250_do_startup(). This function checks
    whether IRQF_SHARED is configured and only then disables the IRQ line while
    testing.
    
    This test is performed upon each open() of the UART device. Imagine two UARTs
    share the same IRQ line: On is already opened and the IRQ is active. When the
    second UART is opened, the IRQ line has to be disabled while performing IRQ
    tests. Otherwise an IRQ might handler might be invoked, but the IRQ itself
    cannot be handled, because the corresponding handler isn't registered,
    yet. That's because the 8250 code uses a chain-handler and invokes the
    corresponding port's IRQ handling routines himself.
    
    Unfortunately this IRQF_SHARED flag isn't configured for UARTs probed via device
    tree even if the IRQs are shared. This way, the actual and shared IRQ line isn't
    disabled while performing tests and the kernel correctly detects a spurious
    IRQ. So, adding this flag to the DT probe solves the issue.
    
    Note: The UPF_SHARE_IRQ flag is configured unconditionally. Therefore, the
    IRQF_SHARED flag can be set unconditionally as well.
    
    Example stack trace by performing `echo 1 > /dev/ttyS2` on a non-patched system:
    
    |irq 85: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
    | [...]
    |handlers:
    |[<ffff0000080fc628>] irq_default_primary_handler threaded [<ffff00000855fbb8>] serial8250_interrupt
    |Disabling IRQ #85
    
    ---8<---8<---
    
    But unfortunately didn't fix the root cause. Let's try again here by moving
    IRQ flag assignment from serial_link_irq_chain() to serial8250_do_startup().
    
    This should fix the similar issue reported for 8250_pnp case.
    
    Since this change we don't need to have custom solutions in 8250_aspeed_vuart
    and 8250_of drivers, thus, drop them.

    MIPS: ingenic: DTS: Fix watchdog nodes
    
    commit 11479e8e3cd896673a15af21cd0f145a4752f01a upstream.
    
    The devicetree ABI was broken on purpose by commit 6d532143c915
    ("watchdog: jz4740: Use regmap provided by TCU driver"), and
    commit 1d9c30745455 ("watchdog: jz4740: Use WDT clock provided
    by TCU driver"). The commit message of the latter explains why the ABI
    was broken.
    
    However, the current devicetree files were not updated to the new ABI
    described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/timer/ingenic,tcu.txt,
    so the watchdog driver would not probe.
    
    Fix this problem by updating the watchdog nodes to comply with the new
    ABI.

    x86/mce/amd: Fix kobject lifetime
    
    commit 51dede9c05df2b78acd6dcf6a17d21f0877d2d7b upstream.
    
    Accessing the MCA thresholding controls in sysfs concurrently with CPU
    hotplug can lead to a couple of KASAN-reported issues:
    
      BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in sysfs_file_ops+0x155/0x180
      Read of size 8 at addr ffff888367578940 by task grep/4019
    
    and
    
      BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in show_error_count+0x15c/0x180
      Read of size 2 at addr ffff888368a05514 by task grep/4454
    
    for example. Both result from the fact that the threshold block
    creation/teardown code frees the descriptor memory itself instead of
    defining proper ->release function and leaving it to the driver core to
    take care of that, after all sysfs accesses have completed.
    
    Do that and get rid of the custom freeing code, fixing the above UAFs in
    the process.

    x86/mce/amd: Publish the bank pointer only after setup has succeeded
    
    commit 6e5cf31fbe651bed7ba1df768f2e123531132417 upstream.
    
    threshold_create_bank() creates a bank descriptor per MCA error
    thresholding counter which can be controlled over sysfs. It publishes
    the pointer to that bank in a per-CPU variable and then goes on to
    create additional thresholding blocks if the bank has such.
    
    However, that creation of additional blocks in
    allocate_threshold_blocks() can fail, leading to a use-after-free
    through the per-CPU pointer.
    
    Therefore, publish that pointer only after all blocks have been setup
    successfully.

    x86/ima: use correct identifier for SetupMode variable
    
    commit ff5ac61ee83c13f516544d29847d28be093a40ee upstream.
    
    The IMA arch code attempts to inspect the "SetupMode" EFI variable
    by populating a variable called efi_SetupMode_name with the string
    "SecureBoot" and passing that to the EFI GetVariable service, which
    obviously does not yield the expected result.
    
    Given that the string is only referenced a single time, let's get
    rid of the intermediate variable, and pass the correct string as
    an immediate argument. While at it, do the same for "SecureBoot".

    jbd2: fix ocfs2 corrupt when clearing block group bits
    
    commit 8eedabfd66b68a4623beec0789eac54b8c9d0fb6 upstream.
    
    I found a NULL pointer dereference in ocfs2_block_group_clear_bits().
    The running environment:
            kernel version: 4.19
            A cluster with two nodes, 5 luns mounted on two nodes, and do some
            file operations like dd/fallocate/truncate/rm on every lun with storage
            network disconnection.
    
    The fallocate operation on dm-23-45 caused an null pointer dereference.
    
    The information of NULL pointer dereference as follows:
            [577992.878282] JBD2: Error -5 detected when updating journal superblock for dm-23-45.

    If handle->h_transaction == NULL, then jbd2_write_access_granted()
    does not really guarantee that journal_head will stay around,
    not even speaking of its b_committed_data. The bh2jh(group_bh)
    can be removed after ocfs2_journal_access_gd() and before call
    "bh2jh(group_bh)->b_committed_data". So, we should move
    is_handle_aborted() check from do_get_write_access() into
    jbd2_journal_get_undo_access() and jbd2_journal_get_write_access()
    before the call to jbd2_write_access_granted().

    powerpc/hugetlb: Fix 8M hugepages on 8xx
    
    commit 50a175dd18de7a647e72aca7daf4744e3a5a81e3 upstream.
    
    With HW assistance all page tables must be 4k aligned, the 8xx drops
    the last 12 bits during the walk.
    
    Redefine HUGEPD_SHIFT_MASK to mask last 12 bits out. HUGEPD_SHIFT_MASK
    is used to for alignment of page table cache.

    powerpc/hugetlb: Fix 512k hugepages on 8xx with 16k page size
    
    commit f2b67ef90b0d5eca0f2255e02cf2f620bc0ddcdb upstream.
    
    Commit 55c8fc3f4930 ("powerpc/8xx: reintroduce 16K pages with HW
    assistance") redefined pte_t as a struct of 4 pte_basic_t, because
    in 16K pages mode there are four identical entries in the
    page table. But the size of hugepage tables is calculated based
    of the size of (void *). Therefore, we end up with page tables
    of size 1k instead of 4k for 512k pages.
    
    As 512k hugepage tables are the same size as standard page tables,
    ie 4k, use the standard page tables instead of PGT_CACHE tables.

    powerpc/tm: Fix clearing MSR[TS] in current when reclaiming on signal delivery
    
    commit 2464cc4c345699adea52c7aef75707207cb8a2f6 upstream.
    
    After a treclaim, we expect to be in non-transactional state. If we
    don't clear the current thread's MSR[TS] before we get preempted, then
    tm_recheckpoint_new_task() will recheckpoint and we get rescheduled in
    suspended transaction state.
    
    When handling a signal caught in transactional state,
    handle_rt_signal64() calls get_tm_stackpointer() that treclaims the
    transaction using tm_reclaim_current() but without clearing the
    thread's MSR[TS]. This can cause the TM Bad Thing exception below if
    later we pagefault and get preempted trying to access the user's
    sigframe, using __put_user(). Afterwards, when we are rescheduled back
    into do_page_fault() (but now in suspended state since the thread's
    MSR[TS] was not cleared), upon executing 'rfid' after completion of
    the page fault handling, the exception is raised because a transition
    from suspended to non-transactional state is invalid.
    
      Unexpected TM Bad Thing exception at c00000000000de44 (msr 0x8000000302a03031) tm_scratch=800000010280b033

        __put_user()
          page fault happens. We will never get back here because of the TM Bad Thing exception.
    
      page fault handling kicks in and we voluntarily preempt ourselves
      do_page_fault()
        __schedule()
          __switch_to(other_task)
    
      our task is rescheduled and we recheckpoint because the thread's MSR[TS] was not cleared
      __switch_to(our_task)
        switch_to_tm()
          tm_recheckpoint_new_task()
            trechkpt                        # kernelspace in SUSPENDED state
    
      The page fault handling resumes, but now we are in suspended transaction state
      do_page_fault()    completes
      rfid     <----- trying to get back where the page fault happened (we were non-transactional back then)
      TM Bad Thing                  # illegal transition from suspended to non-transactional
    
    This patch fixes that issue by clearing the current thread's MSR[TS]
    just after treclaim in get_tm_stackpointer() so that we stay in
    non-transactional state in case we are preempted. In order to make
    treclaim and clearing the thread's MSR[TS] atomic from a preemption
    perspective when CONFIG_PREEMPT is set, preempt_disable/enable() is
    used. It's also necessary to save the previous value of the thread's
    MSR before get_tm_stackpointer() is called so that it can be exposed
    to the signal handler later in setup_tm_sigcontexts() to inform the
    userspace MSR at the moment of the signal delivery.
    
    Found with tm-signal-context-force-tm kernel selftest.

    powerpc/eeh: Fix deadlock handling dead PHB
    
    commit d4f194ed9eb9841a8f978710e4d24296f791a85b upstream.
    
    Recovering a dead PHB can currently cause a deadlock as the PCI
    rescan/remove lock is taken twice.
    
    This is caused as part of an existing bug in
    eeh_handle_special_event(). The pe is processed while traversing the
    PHBs even though the pe is unrelated to the loop. This causes the pe
    to be, incorrectly, processed more than once.
    
    Untangling this section can move the pe processing out of the loop and
    also outside the locked section, correcting both problems.

    In ITLB miss handled the line supposed to clear bits 20-23 on the L2
    ITLB entry is buggy and does indeed nothing, leading to undefined

    Problem is that reading an attribute takes the kernfs lock in the kernfs
    code, then resource->lock in the driver. During an ACPI notification, the
    opposite happens: The resource lock is taken first, followed by the kernfs
    lock when sysfs attributes are removed and re-created. Presumably this is
    now seen due to some locking related changes in kernfs after v5.4, but it
    was likely always a problem.
    
    Fix the problem by not blindly acquiring the lock in the notification
    function. It is only needed to protect the various update functions.
    However, those update functions are called anyway when sysfs attributes
    are read. This means that we can just stop calling those functions from
    the notifier, and the resource lock in the notifier function is no longer
    needed.
    
    That leaves two situations:
    
    First, METER_NOTIFY_CONFIG removes and re-allocates capability strings.
    While it did so under the resource lock, _displaying_ those strings was not
    protected, creating a race condition. To solve this problem, selectively
    protect both removal/creation and reporting of capability attributes with
    the resource lock.
    
    Second, removing and re-creating the attribute files is no longer protected
    by the resource lock. That doesn't matter since access to each individual
    attribute is protected by the kernfs lock. Userspace may get messed up if
    attributes disappear and reappear under its nose, but that is not different
    than today, and there is nothing we can do about it without major driver
    restructuring.
    
    Last but not least, when removing the driver, remove attribute functions
    first, then release capability strings. This avoids yet another race
    condition.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Check for IOC/LST bit in TRB->ctrl fields
    
    commit 5ee858975b13a9b40db00f456989a689fdbb296c upstream.
    
    The current code in dwc3_gadget_ep_reclaim_completed_trb() will
    check for IOC/LST bit in the event->status and returns if
    IOC/LST bit is set. This logic doesn't work if multiple TRBs
    are queued per request and the IOC/LST bit is set on the last
    TRB of that request.
    
    Consider an example where a queued request has multiple queued
    TRBs and IOC/LST bit is set only for the last TRB. In this case,
    the core generates XferComplete/XferInProgress events only for
    the last TRB (since IOC/LST are set only for the last TRB). As
    per the logic in dwc3_gadget_ep_reclaim_completed_trb()
    event->status is checked for IOC/LST bit and returns on the
    first TRB. This leaves the remaining TRBs left unhandled.
    
    Similarly, if the gadget function enqueues an unaligned request
    with sglist already in it, it should fail the same way, since we
    will append another TRB to something that already uses more than
    one TRB.
    
    To aviod this, this patch changes the code to check for IOC/LST
    bits in TRB->ctrl instead.
    
    At a practical level, this patch resolves USB transfer stalls seen
    with adb on dwc3 based HiKey960 after functionfs gadget added
    scatter-gather support around v4.20.

    USB: hub: Fix the broken detection of USB3 device in SMSC hub
    
    commit 1208f9e1d758c991b0a46a1bd60c616b906bbe27 upstream.
    
    Renesas R-Car H3ULCB + Kingfisher Infotainment Board is either not able
    to detect the USB3.0 mass storage devices or is detecting those as
    USB2.0 high speed devices.
    
    The explanation given by Renesas is that, due to a HW issue, the XHCI
    driver does not wake up after going to sleep on connecting a USB3.0
    device.
    
    In order to mitigate that, disable the auto-suspend feature
    specifically for SMSC hubs from hub_probe() function, as a quirk.
    
    Renesas Kingfisher Infotainment Board has two USB3.0 ports (CN2) which
    are connected via USB5534B 4-port SuperSpeed/Hi-Speed, low-power,
    configurable hub controller.

    USB: hub: Don't record a connect-change event during reset-resume
    
    commit 8099f58f1ecddf4f374f4828a3dff8397c7cbd74 upstream.
    
    Paul Zimmerman reports that his USB Bluetooth adapter sometimes
    crashes following system resume, when it receives a
    Get-Device-Descriptor request while it is busy doing something else.
    
    Such a request was added by commit a4f55d8b8c14 ("usb: hub: Check
    device descriptor before resusciation").  It gets sent when the hub
    driver's work thread checks whether a connect-change event on an
    enabled port really indicates a new device has been connected, as
    opposed to an old device momentarily disconnecting and then
    reconnecting (which can happen with xHCI host controllers, since they
    automatically enable connected ports).
    
    The same kind of thing occurs when a port's power session is lost
    during system suspend.  When the system wakes up it sees a
    connect-change event on the port, and if the child device's
    persist_enabled flag was set then hub_activate() sets the device's
    reset_resume flag as well as the port's bit in hub->change_bits.  The
    reset-resume code then takes responsibility for checking that the same
    device is still attached to the port, and it does this as part of the
    device's resume pathway.  By the time the hub driver's work thread
    starts up again, the device has already been fully reinitialized and
    is busy doing its own thing.  There's no need for the work thread to
    do the same check a second time, and in fact this unnecessary check is
    what caused the problem that Paul observed.
    
    Note that performing the unnecessary check is not actually a bug.
    Devices are supposed to be able to send descriptors back to the host
    even when they are busy doing something else.  The underlying cause of
    Paul's problem lies in his Bluetooth adapter.  Nevertheless, we
    shouldn't perform the same check twice in a row -- and as a nice side
    benefit, removing the extra check allows the Bluetooth adapter to work
    more reliably.
    
    The work thread performs its check when it sees that the port's bit is
    set in hub->change_bits.  In this situation that bit is interpreted as
    though a connect-change event had occurred on the port _after_ the
    reset-resume, which is not what actually happened.
    
    One possible fix would be to make the reset-resume code clear the
    port's bit in hub->change_bits.  But it seems simpler to just avoid
    setting the bit during hub_activate() in the first place.  That's what
    this patch does.
    
    (Proving that the patch is correct when CONFIG_PM is disabled requires
    a little thought.  In that setting hub_activate() will be called only
    for initialization and resets, since there won't be any resumes or
    reset-resumes.  During initialization and hub resets the hub doesn't
    have any child devices, and so this code path never gets executed.)

    usb: uas: fix a plug & unplug racing
    
    commit 3e99862c05a9caa5a27969f41566b428696f5a9a upstream.
    
    When a uas disk is plugged into an external hub, uas_probe()
    will be called by the hub thread to do the probe. It will
    first create a SCSI host and then do the scan for this host.
    During the scan, it will probe the LUN using SCSI INQUERY command
    which will be packed in the URB and submitted to uas disk.
    
    There might be a chance that this external hub with uas disk
    attached is unplugged during the scan. In this case, uas driver
    will fail to submit the URB (due to the NOTATTACHED state of uas
    device) and try to put this SCSI command back to request queue
    waiting for next chance to run.
    
    In normal case, this cycle will terminate when hub thread gets
    disconnection event and calls into uas_disconnect() accordingly.
    But in this case, uas_disconnect() will not be called because
    hub thread of external hub gets stuck waiting for the completion
    of this SCSI command. A deadlock happened.
    
    In this fix, uas will call scsi_scan_host() asynchronously to
    avoid the blocking of hub thread.

    USB: quirks: blacklist duplicate ep on Sound Devices USBPre2
    
    commit bdd1b147b8026df0e4260b387026b251d888ed01 upstream.
    
    This device has a broken vendor-specific altsetting for interface 1,
    where endpoint 0x85 is declared as an isochronous endpoint despite being
    used by interface 2 for audio capture.

    xhci: Fix memory leak when caching protocol extended capability PSI tables - take 2
    
    commit cf0ee7c60c89641f6e4d1d3c7867fe32b9e30300 upstream.
    
    xhci driver assumed that xHC controllers have at most one custom
    supported speed table (PSI) for all usb 3.x ports.
    Memory was allocated for one PSI table under the xhci hub structure.
    
    Turns out this is not the case, some controllers have a separate
    "supported protocol capability" entry with a PSI table for each port.
    This means each usb3 roothub port can in theory support different custom
    speeds.
    
    To solve this, cache all supported protocol capabilities with their PSI
    tables in an array, and add pointers to the xhci port structure so that
    every port points to its capability entry in the array.
    
    When creating the SuperSpeedPlus USB Device Capability BOS descriptor
    for the xhci USB 3.1 roothub we for now will use only data from the
    first USB 3.1 capable protocol capability entry in the array.
    This could be improved later, this patch focuses resolving
    the memory leak.

    xhci: fix runtime pm enabling for quirky Intel hosts
    
    commit 024d411e9c5d49eb96c825af52a3ce2682895676 upstream.
    
    Intel hosts that need the XHCI_PME_STUCK_QUIRK flag should enable
    runtime pm by calling xhci_pme_acpi_rtd3_enable() before
    usb_hcd_pci_probe() calls pci_dev_run_wake().
    Otherwise usage count for the device won't be decreased, and runtime
    suspend is prevented.
    
    usb_hcd_pci_probe() only decreases the usage count if device can
    generate run-time wake-up events, i.e. when pci_dev_run_wake()
    returns true.
    
    This issue was exposed by pci_dev_run_wake() change in
    commit 8feaec33b986 ("PCI / PM: Always check PME wakeup capability for
    runtime wakeup support")
    and should be backported to kernels with that change

    xhci: Force Maximum Packet size for Full-speed bulk devices to valid range.
    
    commit f148b9f402ef002b57bcff3964d45abc8ffb6c3f upstream.
    
    A Full-speed bulk USB audio device (DJ-Tech CTRL) with a invalid Maximum
    Packet Size of 4 causes a xHC "Parameter Error" at enumeration.
    
    This is because valid Maximum packet sizes for Full-speed bulk endpoints
    are 8, 16, 32 and 64 bytes. Hosts are not required to support other values
    than these. See usb 2 specs section 5.8.3 for details.
    
    The device starts working after forcing the maximum packet size to 8.
    This is most likely the case with other devices as well, so force the
    maximum packet size to a valid range.

    When ashmem file is mmapped, the resulting vma->vm_file points to the

    vt: selection, handle pending signals in paste_selection
    
    commit 687bff0cd08f790d540cfb7b2349f0d876cdddec upstream.
    
    When pasting a selection to a vt, the task is set as INTERRUPTIBLE while
    waiting for a tty to unthrottle. But signals are not handled at all.
    Normally, this is not a problem as tty_ldisc_receive_buf receives all
    the goods and a user has no reason to interrupt the task.
    
    There are two scenarios where this matters:
    1) when the tty is throttled and a signal is sent to the process, it
       spins on a CPU until the tty is unthrottled. schedule() does not
       really echedule, but returns immediately, of course.
    2) when the sel_buffer becomes invalid, KASAN prevents any reads from it
       and the loop simply does not proceed and spins forever (causing the
       tty to throttle, but the code never sleeps, the same as above). This
       sometimes happens as there is a race in the sel_buffer handling code.
    
    So add signal handling to this ioctl (TIOCL_PASTESEL) and return -EINTR
    in case a signal is pending.

    vt: fix scrollback flushing on background consoles
    
    commit 3f4ef485be9d54040b695f32ec76d0f1ea50bbf3 upstream.
    
    Commit a6dbe4427559 ("vt: perform safe console erase in the right
    order") provided fixes to an earlier commit by gathering all console
    scrollback flushing operations in a function of its own. This includes
    the invocation of vc_sw->con_switch() as previously done through a
    update_screen() call. That commit failed to carry over the
    con_is_visible() conditional though, as well as cursor handling, which
    caused problems when "\e[3J" was written to a background console.
    
    One could argue for preserving the call to update_screen(). However
    this does far more than we need, and it is best to remove scrollback
    assumptions from it. Instead let's gather the minimum needed to actually
    perform scrollback flushing properly in that one place.
    
    While at it, let's document the vc_sw->con_switch() side effect being
    relied upon.

    USB: serial: ch341: fix receiver regression
    
    commit 7c3d02285ad558691f27fde760bcd841baa27eab upstream.
    
    While assumed not to make a difference, not using the factor-2 prescaler
    makes the receiver more susceptible to errors.
    
    Specifically, there have been reports of problems with devices that
    cannot generate a 115200 rate with a smaller error than 2.1% (e.g.
    117647 bps). But this can also be reproduced with a low-speed RS232
    tranceiver at 115200 when the input rate matches the nominal rate.
    
    So whenever possible, enable the factor-2 prescaler and halve the
    divisor in order to use settings closer to that of the previous
    algorithm.

    floppy: check FDC index for errors before assigning it
    
    commit 2e90ca68b0d2f5548804f22f0dd61145516171e3 upstream.
    
    Jordy Zomer reported a KASAN out-of-bounds read in the floppy driver in
    wait_til_ready().
    
    Which on the face of it can't happen, since as Willy Tarreau points out,
    the function does no particular memory access.  Except through the FDCS
    macro, which just indexes a static allocation through teh current fdc,
    which is always checked against N_FDC.
    
    Except the checking happens after we've already assigned the value.
    
    The floppy driver is a disgrace (a lot of it going back to my original
    horrd "design"), and has no real maintainer.  Nobody has the hardware,
    and nobody really cares.  But it still gets used in virtual environment
    because it's one of those things that everybody supports.
    
    The whole thing should be re-written, or at least parts of it should be
    seriously cleaned up.  The 'current fdc' index, which is used by the
    FDCS macro, and which is often shadowed by a local 'fdc' variable, is a
    prime example of how not to write code.
    
    But because nobody has the hardware or the motivation, let's just fix up
    the immediate problem with a nasty band-aid: test the fdc index before
    actually assigning it to the static 'fdc' variable.

    because the file is supposed to be write-only. However, it turns out
    NVMem subsystem does not yet support this and expects that the .reg_read
    callback is provided. If user reads the binary attribute it triggers
    NULL pointer dereference like this one:

    btrfs: handle logged extent failure properly
    
    commit bd727173e4432fe6cb70ba108dc1f3602c5409d7 upstream.
    
    If we're allocating a logged extent we attempt to insert an extent
    record for the file extent directly.  We increase
    space_info->bytes_reserved, because the extent entry addition will call
    btrfs_update_block_group(), which will convert the ->bytes_reserved to
    ->bytes_used.  However if we fail at any point while inserting the
    extent entry we will bail and leave space on ->bytes_reserved, which
    will trigger a WARN_ON() on umount.  Fix this by pinning the space if we
    fail to insert, which is what happens in every other failure case that
    involves adding the extent entry.

    btrfs: don't set path->leave_spinning for truncate
    
    commit 52e29e331070cd7d52a64cbf1b0958212a340e28 upstream.
    
    The only time we actually leave the path spinning is if we're truncating
    a small amount and don't actually free an extent, which is not a common
    occurrence.  We have to set the path blocking in order to add the
    delayed ref anyway, so the first extent we find we set the path to
    blocking and stay blocking for the duration of the operation.  With the
    upcoming file extent map stuff there will be another case that we have
    to have the path blocking, so just swap to blocking always.
    
    Note: this patch also fixes a warning after 28553fa992cb ("Btrfs: fix
    race between shrinking truncate and fiemap") got merged that inserts
    extent locks around truncation so the path must not leave spinning locks
    after btrfs_search_slot.

    longer have corresponding file extent items. This is generally harmless
    and at the moment the only consequences are missing file extent items
    representing holes after we expand the file size again after the
    truncate operation removed the prealloc extent items, and stale
    information for future fiemap calls (reporting extents that no longer
    exist or may have been reallocated to other files for example).
    
    Consider the following example:
    
    1) Our inode has a size of 128KiB, one 128KiB extent at file offset 0
       and a 1MiB prealloc extent at file offset 128KiB;
    
    2) Task A starts doing a shrinking truncate of our inode to reduce it to
       a size of 64KiB. Before it searches the subvolume tree for file
       extent items to delete, it drops all the extent maps in the range
       from 64KiB to (u64)-1 by calling btrfs_drop_extent_cache();
    
    3) Task B starts doing a fiemap against our inode. When looking up for
       the inode's extent maps in the range from 128KiB to (u64)-1, it
       doesn't find any in the inode's extent map tree, since they were
       removed by task A.  Because it didn't find any in the extent map
       tree, it scans the inode's subvolume tree for file extent items, and
       it finds the 1MiB prealloc extent at file offset 128KiB, then it
       creates an extent map based on that file extent item and adds it to
       inode's extent map tree (this ends up being done by
       btrfs_get_extent() <- btrfs_get_extent_fiemap() <-
       get_extent_skip_holes());
    
    4) Task A then drops the prealloc extent at file offset 128KiB and
       shrinks the 128KiB extent file offset 0 to a length of 64KiB. The
       truncation operation finishes and we end up with an extent map
       representing a 1MiB prealloc extent at file offset 128KiB, despite we
       don't have any more that extent;
    
    After this the two types of problems we have are:
    
    1) Future calls to fiemap always report that a 1MiB prealloc extent
       exists at file offset 128KiB. This is stale information, no longer
       correct;
    
    2) If the size of the file is increased, by a truncate operation that
       increases the file size or by a write into a file offset > 64KiB for
       example, we end up not inserting file extent items to represent holes
       for any range between 128KiB and 128KiB + 1MiB, since the hole
       expansion function, btrfs_cont_expand() will skip hole insertion for
       any range for which an extent map exists that represents a prealloc
       extent. This causes fsck to complain about missing file extent items
       when not using the NO_HOLES feature.
    
    The second issue could be often triggered by test case generic/561 from
    fstests, which runs fsstress and duperemove in parallel, and duperemove
    does frequent fiemap calls.
    
    Essentially the problems happens because fiemap does not acquire the
    inode's lock while truncate does, and fiemap locks the file range in the
    inode's iotree while truncate does not. So fix the issue by making
    btrfs_truncate_inode_items() lock the file range from the new file size
    to (u64)-1, so that it serializes with fiemap.

    commit b4a81b87a4cfe2bb26a4a943b748d96a43ef20e8 upstream.
    
    In ecryptfs_init_messaging(), if the allocation for 'ecryptfs_msg_ctx_arr'
    fails, the previously allocated 'ecryptfs_daemon_hash' is not deallocated,
    leading to a memory leak bug. To fix this issue, free
    'ecryptfs_daemon_hash' before returning the error.

    tpm: Initialize crypto_id of allocated_banks to HASH_ALGO__LAST
    
    commit dc10e4181c05a2315ddc375e963b7c763b5ee0df upstream.
    
    chip->allocated_banks, an array of tpm_bank_info structures, contains the
    list of TPM algorithm IDs of allocated PCR banks. It also contains the
    corresponding ID of the crypto subsystem, so that users of the TPM driver
    can calculate a digest for a PCR extend operation.
    
    However, if there is no mapping between TPM algorithm ID and crypto ID, the
    crypto_id field of tpm_bank_info remains set to zero (the array is
    allocated and initialized with kcalloc() in tpm2_get_pcr_allocation()).
    Zero should not be used as value for unknown mappings, as it is a valid
    crypto ID (HASH_ALGO_MD4).
    
    Thus, initialize crypto_id to HASH_ALGO__LAST.

    ALSA: hda: Use scnprintf() for printing texts for sysfs/procfs
    
    commit 44eeb081b8630bb3ad3cd381d1ae1831463e48bb upstream.
    
    Some code in HD-audio driver calls snprintf() in a loop and still
    expects that the return value were actually written size, while
    snprintf() returns the expected would-be length instead.  When the
    given buffer limit were small, this leads to a buffer overflow.
    
    Use scnprintf() for addressing those issues.  It returns the actually
    written size unlike snprintf().

    commit faf305c51aeabd1ea2d7131e798ef5f55f4a7750 upstream.
    
    Currently, the implementation of qcom_iommu_domain_free() is guaranteed
    to do one of two things: WARN() and leak everything, or dereference NULL
    and crash. That alone is terrible, but in fact the whole idea of trying
    to track the liveness of a domain via the qcom_domain->iommu pointer as
    a sanity check is full of fundamentally flawed assumptions. Make things
    robust and actually functional by not trying to be quite so clever.
