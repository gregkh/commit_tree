    media: v4l: ioctl: Fix memory leak in video_usercopy
    
    commit fb18802a338b36f675a388fc03d2aa504a0d0899 upstream.
    
    When an IOCTL with argument size larger than 128 that also used array
    arguments were handled, two memory allocations were made but alas, only
    the latter one of them was released. This happened because there was only
    a single local variable to hold such a temporary allocation.
    
    Fix this by adding separate variables to hold the pointers to the
    temporary allocations.

    swap: fix swapfile read/write offset
    
    commit caf6912f3f4af7232340d500a4a2008f81b93f14 upstream.
    
    We're not factoring in the start of the file for where to write and
    read the swapfile, which leads to very unfortunate side effects of
    writing where we should not be...
    
    [This issue only affects swapfiles on filesystems on top of blockdevs
    that implement rw_page ops (brd, zram, btt, pmem), and not on top of any
    other block devices, in contrast to the upstream commit fix.]

    zsmalloc: account the number of compacted pages correctly
    
    commit 2395928158059b8f9858365fce7713ce7fef62e4 upstream.
    
    There exists multiple path may do zram compaction concurrently.
    1. auto-compaction triggered during memory reclaim
    2. userspace utils write zram<id>/compaction node
    
    So, multiple threads may call zs_shrinker_scan/zs_compact concurrently.
    But pages_compacted is a per zsmalloc pool variable and modification
    of the variable is not serialized(through under class->lock).
    There are two issues here:
    1. the pages_compacted may not equal to total number of pages
    freed(due to concurrently add).
    2. zs_shrinker_scan may not return the correct number of pages
    freed(issued by current shrinker).
    
    The fix is simple:
    1. account the number of pages freed in zs_compact locally.
    2. use actomic variable pages_compacted to accumulate total number.

    Xen/gnttab: handle p2m update errors on a per-slot basis
    
    commit 8310b77b48c5558c140e7a57a702e7819e62f04e upstream.
    
    Bailing immediately from set_foreign_p2m_mapping() upon a p2m updating
    error leaves the full batch in an ambiguous state as far as the caller
    is concerned. Instead flags respective slots as bad, unmapping what
    was mapped there right away.
    
    HYPERVISOR_grant_table_op()'s return value and the individual unmap
    slots' status fields get used only for a one-time - there's not much we
    can do in case of a failure.
    
    Note that there's no GNTST_enomem or alike, so GNTST_general_error gets
    used.
    
    The map ops' handle fields get overwritten just to be on the safe side.
    
    This is part of XSA-367.

    sysfs: Add sysfs_emit and sysfs_emit_at to format sysfs output
    
    commit 2efc459d06f1630001e3984854848a5647086232 upstream.
    
    Output defects can exist in sysfs content using sprintf and snprintf.
    
    sprintf does not know the PAGE_SIZE maximum of the temporary buffer
    used for outputting sysfs content and it's possible to overrun the
    PAGE_SIZE buffer length.
    
    Add a generic sysfs_emit function that knows that the size of the
    temporary buffer and ensures that no overrun is done.
    
    Add a generic sysfs_emit_at function that can be used in multiple
    call situations that also ensures that no overrun is done.
    
    Validate the output buffer argument to be page aligned.
    Validate the offset len argument to be within the PAGE_SIZE buf.

    x86/build: Treat R_386_PLT32 relocation as R_386_PC32
    
    [ Upstream commit bb73d07148c405c293e576b40af37737faf23a6a ]
    
    This is similar to commit
    
      b21ebf2fb4cd ("x86: Treat R_X86_64_PLT32 as R_X86_64_PC32")
    
    but for i386. As far as the kernel is concerned, R_386_PLT32 can be
    treated the same as R_386_PC32.
    
    R_386_PLT32/R_X86_64_PLT32 are PC-relative relocation types which
    can only be used by branches. If the referenced symbol is defined
    externally, a PLT will be used.
    
    R_386_PC32/R_X86_64_PC32 are PC-relative relocation types which can be
    used by address taking operations and branches. If the referenced symbol
    is defined externally, a copy relocation/canonical PLT entry will be
    created in the executable.
    
    On x86-64, there is no PIC vs non-PIC PLT distinction and an
    R_X86_64_PLT32 relocation is produced for both `call/jmp foo` and
    `call/jmp foo@PLT` with newer (2018) GNU as/LLVM integrated assembler.
    This avoids canonical PLT entries (st_shndx=0, st_value!=0).
    
    On i386, there are 2 types of PLTs, PIC and non-PIC. Currently,
    the GCC/GNU as convention is to use R_386_PC32 for non-PIC PLT and
    R_386_PLT32 for PIC PLT. Copy relocations/canonical PLT entries
    are possible ABI issues but GCC/GNU as will likely keep the status
    quo because (1) the ABI is legacy (2) the change will drop a GNU
    ld diagnostic for non-default visibility ifunc in shared objects.
    
    clang-12 -fno-pic (since [1]) can emit R_386_PLT32 for compiler
    generated function declarations, because preventing canonical PLT
    entries is weighed over the rare ifunc diagnostic.

    [ Upstream commit b55379e343a3472c35f4a1245906db5158cab453 ]
    
    Failed to transmit wmi management frames:
    
    [84977.840894] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: wmi mgmt tx queue is full
    [84977.840913] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: failed to transmit packet, dropping: -28
    [84977.840924] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: failed to submit frame: -28
    [84977.840932] ath10k_snoc a000000.wifi: failed to transmit frame: -28
    
    This issue is caused by race condition between skb_dequeue and
    __skb_queue_tail. The queue of ‘wmi_mgmt_tx_queue’ is protected by a
    different lock: ar->data_lock vs list->lock, the result is no protection.
    So when ath10k_mgmt_over_wmi_tx_work() and ath10k_mac_tx_wmi_mgmt()
    running concurrently on different CPUs, there appear to be a rare corner
    cases when the queue length is 1,
    
      CPUx (skb_deuque)                     CPUy (__skb_queue_tail)
                                            next=list
                                            prev=list
      struct sk_buff *skb = skb_peek(list); WRITE_ONCE(newsk->next, next);
      WRITE_ONCE(list->qlen, list->qlen - 1);WRITE_ONCE(newsk->prev, prev);
      next       = skb->next;               WRITE_ONCE(next->prev, newsk);
      prev       = skb->prev;               WRITE_ONCE(prev->next, newsk);
      skb->next  = skb->prev = NULL;        list->qlen++;
      WRITE_ONCE(next->prev, prev);
      WRITE_ONCE(prev->next, next);
    
    If the instruction ‘next = skb->next’ is executed before
    ‘WRITE_ONCE(prev->next, newsk)’, newsk will be lost, as CPUx get the
    old ‘next’ pointer, but the length is still added by one. The final
    result is the length of the queue will reach the maximum value but
    the queue is empty.
    
    So remove ar->data_lock, and use 'skb_queue_tail' instead of
    '__skb_queue_tail' to prevent the potential race condition. Also switch
    to use skb_queue_len_lockless, in case we queue a few SKBs simultaneously.

    pktgen: fix misuse of BUG_ON() in pktgen_thread_worker()
    
    [ Upstream commit 275b1e88cabb34dbcbe99756b67e9939d34a99b6 ]
    
    pktgen create threads for all online cpus and bond these threads to
    relevant cpu repecivtily. when this thread firstly be woken up, it
    will compare cpu currently running with the cpu specified at the time
    of creation and if the two cpus are not equal, BUG_ON() will take effect
    causing panic on the system.
    Notice that these threads could be migrated to other cpus before start
    running because of the cpu hotplug after these threads have created. so the
    BUG_ON() used here seems unreasonable and we can replace it with WARN_ON()
    to just printf a warning other than panic the system.

    wlcore: Fix command execute failure 19 for wl12xx
    
    [ Upstream commit cb88d01b67383a095e3f7caeb4cdade5a6cf0417 ]
    
    We can currently get a "command execute failure 19" error on beacon loss
    if the signal is weak:
    
    wlcore: Beacon loss detected. roles:0xff
    wlcore: Connection loss work (role_id: 0).
    ...
    wlcore: ERROR command execute failure 19
    ...
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1552 at drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/main.c:803
    ...
    (wl12xx_queue_recovery_work.part.0 [wlcore])
    (wl12xx_cmd_role_start_sta [wlcore])
    (wl1271_op_bss_info_changed [wlcore])
    (ieee80211_prep_connection [mac80211])
    
    Error 19 is defined as CMD_STATUS_WRONG_NESTING from the wlcore firmware,
    and seems to mean that the firmware no longer wants to see the quirk
    handling for WLCORE_QUIRK_START_STA_FAILS done.
    
    This quirk got added with commit 18eab430700d ("wlcore: workaround
    start_sta problem in wl12xx fw"), and it seems that this already got fixed
    in the firmware long time ago back in 2012 as wl18xx never had this quirk
    in place to start with.
    
    As we no longer even support firmware that early, to me it seems that it's
    safe to just drop WLCORE_QUIRK_START_STA_FAILS to fix the error. Looks
    like earlier firmware got disabled back in 2013 with commit 0e284c074ef9
    ("wl12xx: increase minimum singlerole firmware version required").
    
    If it turns out we still need WLCORE_QUIRK_START_STA_FAILS with any
    firmware that the driver works with, we can simply revert this patch and
    add extra checks for firmware version used.
    
    With this fix wlcore reconnects properly after a beacon loss.

    The constant 20 makes the font sum computation signed which can lead to

    net: bridge: use switchdev for port flags set through sysfs too
    
    commit 8043c845b63a2dd88daf2d2d268a33e1872800f0 upstream.
    
    Looking through patchwork I don't see that there was any consensus to
    use switchdev notifiers only in case of netlink provided port flags but
    not sysfs (as a sort of deprecation, punishment or anything like that),
    so we should probably keep the user interface consistent in terms of
    functionality.

    mm/hugetlb.c: fix unnecessary address expansion of pmd sharing
    
    commit a1ba9da8f0f9a37d900ff7eff66482cf7de8015e upstream.
    
    The current code would unnecessarily expand the address range.  Consider
    one example, (start, end) = (1G-2M, 3G+2M), and (vm_start, vm_end) =
    (1G-4M, 3G+4M), the expected adjustment should be keep (1G-2M, 3G+2M)
    without expand.  But the current result will be (1G-4M, 3G+4M).  Actually,
    the range (1G-4M, 1G) and (3G, 3G+4M) would never been involved in pmd
    sharing.
    
    After this patch, we will check that the vma span at least one PUD aligned
    size and the start,end range overlap the aligned range of vma.
    
    With above example, the aligned vma range is (1G, 3G), so if (start, end)
    range is within (1G-4M, 1G), or within (3G, 3G+4M), then no adjustment to
    both start and end.  Otherwise, we will have chance to adjust start
    downwards or end upwards without exceeding (vm_start, vm_end).
    
    Mike:
    
    : The 'adjusted range' is used for calls to mmu notifiers and cache(tlb)
    : flushing.  Since the current code unnecessarily expands the range in some
    : cases, more entries than necessary would be flushed.  This would/could
    : result in performance degradation.  However, this is highly dependent on
    : the user runtime.  Is there a combination of vma layout and calls to
    : actually hit this issue?  If the issue is hit, will those entries
    : unnecessarily flushed be used again and need to be unnecessarily reloaded?

    net: fix up truesize of cloned skb in skb_prepare_for_shift()
    
    commit 097b9146c0e26aabaa6ff3e5ea536a53f5254a79 upstream.
    
    Avoid the assumption that ksize(kmalloc(S)) == ksize(kmalloc(S)): when
    cloning an skb, save and restore truesize after pskb_expand_head(). This
    can occur if the allocator decides to service an allocation of the same
    size differently (e.g. use a different size class, or pass the
    allocation on to KFENCE).
    
    Because truesize is used for bookkeeping (such as sk_wmem_queued), a
    modified truesize of a cloned skb may result in corrupt bookkeeping and
    relevant warnings (such as in sk_stream_kill_queues()).

    smackfs: restrict bytes count in smackfs write functions
    
    commit 7ef4c19d245f3dc233fd4be5acea436edd1d83d8 upstream.
    
    syzbot found WARNINGs in several smackfs write operations where
    bytes count is passed to memdup_user_nul which exceeds
    GFP MAX_ORDER. Check count size if bigger than PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Per smackfs doc, smk_write_net4addr accepts any label or -CIPSO,
    smk_write_net6addr accepts any label or -DELETE. I couldn't find
    any general rule for other label lengths except SMK_LABELLEN,
    SMK_LONGLABEL, SMK_CIPSOMAX which are documented.
    
    Let's constrain, in general, smackfs label lengths for PAGE_SIZE.
    Although fuzzer crashes write to smackfs/netlabel on 0x400000 length.
    
    Here is a quick way to reproduce the WARNING:
    python -c "print('A' * 0x400000)" > /sys/fs/smackfs/netlabel

    JFS: more checks for invalid superblock
    
    commit 3bef198f1b17d1bb89260bad947ef084c0a2d1a6 upstream.
    
    syzbot is feeding invalid superblock data to JFS for mount testing.
    JFS does not check several of the fields -- just assumes that they
    are good since the JFS_MAGIC and version fields are good.
    
    In this case (syzbot reproducer), we have s_l2bsize == 0xda0c,
    pad == 0xf045, and s_state == 0x50, all of which are invalid IMO.
    Having s_l2bsize == 0xda0c causes this UBSAN warning:
      UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/jfs/jfs_mount.c:373:25
      shift exponent -9716 is negative
    
    s_l2bsize can be tested for correctness. pad can be tested for non-0
    and punted. s_state can be tested for its valid values and punted.
    
    Do those 3 tests and if any of them fails, report the superblock as
    invalid/corrupt and let fsck handle it.
    
    With this patch, chkSuper() says this when JFS_DEBUG is enabled:
      jfs_mount: Mount Failure: superblock is corrupt!
      Mount JFS Failure: -22
      jfs_mount failed w/return code = -22
    
    The obvious problem with this method is that next week there could
    be another syzbot test that uses different fields for invalid values,
    this making this like a game of whack-a-mole.

    arm64: Use correct ll/sc atomic constraints
    
    commit 580fa1b874711d633f9b145b7777b0e83ebf3787 upstream.
    
    The A64 ISA accepts distinct (but overlapping) ranges of immediates for:
    
     * add arithmetic instructions ('I' machine constraint)
     * sub arithmetic instructions ('J' machine constraint)
     * 32-bit logical instructions ('K' machine constraint)
     * 64-bit logical instructions ('L' machine constraint)
    
    ... but we currently use the 'I' constraint for many atomic operations
    using sub or logical instructions, which is not always valid.
    
    When CONFIG_ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS is not set, this allows invalid immediates
    to be passed to instructions, potentially resulting in a build failure.
    When CONFIG_ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS is selected the out-of-line ll/sc atomics
    always use a register as they have no visibility of the value passed by
    the caller.
    
    This patch adds a constraint parameter to the ATOMIC_xx and
    __CMPXCHG_CASE macros so that we can pass appropriate constraints for
    each case, with uses updated accordingly.
    
    Unfortunately prior to GCC 8.1.0 the 'K' constraint erroneously accepted
    '4294967295', so we must instead force the use of a register.

    arm64: cmpxchg: Use "K" instead of "L" for ll/sc immediate constraint
    
    commit 4230509978f2921182da4e9197964dccdbe463c3 upstream.
    
    The "L" AArch64 machine constraint, which we use for the "old" value in
    an LL/SC cmpxchg(), generates an immediate that is suitable for a 64-bit
    logical instruction. However, for cmpxchg() operations on types smaller
    than 64 bits, this constraint can result in an invalid instruction which
    is correctly rejected by GAS, such as EOR W1, W1, #0xffffffff.
    
    Whilst we could special-case the constraint based on the cmpxchg size,
    it's far easier to change the constraint to "K" and put up with using
    a register for large 64-bit immediates. For out-of-line LL/SC atomics,
    this is all moot anyway.

    arm64: Avoid redundant type conversions in xchg() and cmpxchg()
    
    commit 5ef3fe4cecdf82fdd71ce78988403963d01444d4 upstream.
    
    Our atomic instructions (either LSE atomics of LDXR/STXR sequences)
    natively support byte, half-word, word and double-word memory accesses
    so there is no need to mask the data register prior to being stored.

    arm64 module: set plt* section addresses to 0x0
    
    commit f5c6d0fcf90ce07ee0d686d465b19b247ebd5ed7 upstream.
    
    These plt* and .text.ftrace_trampoline sections specified for arm64 have
    non-zero addressses. Non-zero section addresses in a relocatable ELF would
    confuse GDB when it tries to compute the section offsets and it ends up
    printing wrong symbol addresses. Therefore, set them to zero, which mirrors
    the change in commit 5d8591bc0fba ("module: set ksymtab/kcrctab* section
    addresses to 0x0").

    virtio/s390: implement virtio-ccw revision 2 correctly
    
    commit 182f709c5cff683e6732d04c78e328de0532284f upstream.
    
    CCW_CMD_READ_STATUS was introduced with revision 2 of virtio-ccw,
    and drivers should only rely on it being implemented when they
    negotiated at least that revision with the device.
    
    However, virtio_ccw_get_status() issued READ_STATUS for any
    device operating at least at revision 1. If the device accepts
    READ_STATUS regardless of the negotiated revision (which some
    implementations like QEMU do, even though the spec currently does
    not allow it), everything works as intended. While a device
    rejecting the command should also be handled gracefully, we will
    not be able to see any changes the device makes to the status,
    such as setting NEEDS_RESET or setting the status to zero after
    a completed reset.
    
    We negotiated the revision to at most 1, as we never bumped the
    maximum revision; let's do that now and properly send READ_STATUS
    only if we are operating at least at revision 2.

    drm/virtio: use kvmalloc for large allocations
    
    commit ea86f3defd55f141a44146e66cbf8ffb683d60da upstream.
    
    We observed that some of virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() allocations
    can be rather costly - order 6 - which can be difficult to fulfill
    under memory pressure conditions. Switch to kvmalloc_array() in
    virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() and let the kernel vmalloc the entries
    array.

    hugetlb: fix update_and_free_page contig page struct assumption
    
    commit dbfee5aee7e54f83d96ceb8e3e80717fac62ad63 upstream.
    
    page structs are not guaranteed to be contiguous for gigantic pages.  The
    routine update_and_free_page can encounter a gigantic page, yet it assumes
    page structs are contiguous when setting page flags in subpages.
    
    If update_and_free_page encounters non-contiguous page structs, we can see
    “BUG: Bad page state in process …” errors.
    
    Non-contiguous page structs are generally not an issue.  However, they can
    exist with a specific kernel configuration and hotplug operations.  For
    example: Configure the kernel with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM and
    !CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.  Then, hotplug add memory for the area where
    the gigantic page will be allocated.  Zi Yan outlined steps to reproduce
    here [1].
