    Revert "x86/apic: Include the LDR when clearing out APIC registers"
    
    [ Upstream commit 950b07c14e8c59444e2359f15fd70ed5112e11a0 ]
    
    This reverts commit 558682b5291937a70748d36fd9ba757fb25b99ae.
    
    Chris Wilson reports that it breaks his CPU hotplug test scripts.  In
    particular, it breaks offlining and then re-onlining the boot CPU, which
    we treat specially (and the BIOS does too).
    
    The symptoms are that we can offline the CPU, but it then does not come
    back online again:
    
        smpboot: CPU 0 is now offline
        smpboot: Booting Node 0 Processor 0 APIC 0x0
        smpboot: do_boot_cpu failed(-1) to wakeup CPU#0
    
    Thomas says he knows why it's broken (my personal suspicion: our magic
    handling of the "cpu0_logical_apicid" thing), but for 5.3 the right fix
    is to just revert it, since we've never touched the LDR bits before, and
    it's not worth the risk to do anything else at this stage.
    
    [ Hotpluging of the boot CPU is special anyway, and should be off by
      default. See the "BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU0" config option and the
      cpu0_hotplug kernel parameter.
    
      In general you should not do it, and it has various known limitations
      (hibernate and suspend require the boot CPU, for example).
    
      But it should work, even if the boot CPU is special and needs careful
      treatment       - Linus ]

    KVM: arm/arm64: VGIC: Properly initialise private IRQ affinity
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e16f3e926ed48373c98edea85c6ad0ef69425d1 ]
    
    At the moment we initialise the target *mask* of a virtual IRQ to the
    VCPU it belongs to, even though this mask is only defined for GICv2 and
    quickly runs out of bits for many GICv3 guests.
    This behaviour triggers an UBSAN complaint for more than 32 VCPUs:
    ------
    [ 5659.462377] UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-init.c:223:21
    [ 5659.471689] shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'unsigned int'
    ------
    Also for GICv3 guests the reporting of TARGET in the "vgic-state" debugfs
    dump is wrong, due to this very same problem.
    
    Because there is no requirement to create the VGIC device before the
    VCPUs (and QEMU actually does it the other way round), we can't safely
    initialise mpidr or targets in kvm_vgic_vcpu_init(). But since we touch
    every private IRQ for each VCPU anyway later (in vgic_init()), we can
    just move the initialisation of those fields into there, where we
    definitely know the VGIC type.
    
    On the way make sure we really have either a VGICv2 or a VGICv3 device,
    since the existing code is just checking for "VGICv3 or not", silently
    ignoring the uninitialised case.

    afs: Fix leak in afs_lookup_cell_rcu()
    
    [ Upstream commit a5fb8e6c02d6a518fb2b1a2b8c2471fa77b69436 ]
    
    Fix a leak on the cell refcount in afs_lookup_cell_rcu() due to
    non-clearance of the default error in the case a NULL cell name is passed
    and the workstation default cell is used.
    
    Also put a bit at the end to make sure we don't leak a cell ref if we're
    going to be returning an error.
    
    This leak results in an assertion like the following when the kafs module is
    unloaded:
    
            AFS: Assertion failed
            2 == 1 is false

    KVM: arm/arm64: Only skip MMIO insn once
    
    [ Upstream commit 2113c5f62b7423e4a72b890bd479704aa85c81ba ]
    
    If after an MMIO exit to userspace a VCPU is immediately run with an
    immediate_exit request, such as when a signal is delivered or an MMIO
    emulation completion is needed, then the VCPU completes the MMIO
    emulation and immediately returns to userspace. As the exit_reason
    does not get changed from KVM_EXIT_MMIO in these cases we have to
    be careful not to complete the MMIO emulation again, when the VCPU is
    eventually run again, because the emulation does an instruction skip
    (and doing too many skips would be a waste of guest code :-) We need
    to use additional VCPU state to track if the emulation is complete.
    As luck would have it, we already have 'mmio_needed', which even
    appears to be used in this way by other architectures already.

    [ Upstream commit 2323d7baab2b18d87d9bc267452e387aa9f0060a ]
    
    In fault_opcodes_write(), 'data' is allocated through kcalloc(). However,
    it is not deallocated in the following execution if an error occurs,
    leading to memory leaks. To fix this issue, introduce the 'free_data' label
    to free 'data' before returning the error.

    nvme-multipath: fix possible I/O hang when paths are updated
    
    [ Upstream commit 504db087aaccdb32af61539916409f7dca31ceb5 ]
    
    nvme_state_set_live() making a path available triggers requeue_work
    in order to resubmit requests that ended up on requeue_list when no
    paths were available.
    
    This requeue_work may race with concurrent nvme_ns_head_make_request()
    that do not observe the live path yet.
    Such concurrent requests may by made by either:
    - New IO submission.
    - Requeue_work triggered by nvme_failover_req() or another ana_work.
    
    A race may cause requeue_work capture the state of requeue_list before
    more requests get onto the list. These requests will stay on the list
    forever unless requeue_work is triggered again.
    
    In order to prevent such race, nvme_state_set_live() should
    synchronize_srcu(&head->srcu) before triggering the requeue_work and
    prevent nvme_ns_head_make_request referencing an old snapshot of the
    path list.

    x86/boot/compressed/64: Fix boot on machines with broken E820 table
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a46fff2f9108c2c44218380a43a736cf4612541 ]
    
    BIOS on Samsung 500C Chromebook reports very rudimentary E820 table that
    consists of 2 entries:
    
      BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000fff] usable
      BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000fffff000-0x00000000ffffffff] reserved
    
    It breaks logic in find_trampoline_placement(): bios_start lands on the
    end of the first 4k page and trampoline start gets placed below 0.
    
    Detect underflow and don't touch bios_start for such cases. It makes
    kernel ignore E820 table on machines that doesn't have two usable pages
    below BIOS_START_MAX.

    [ Upstream commit cfef46d692efd852a0da6803f920cc756eea2855 ]
    
    When a Tx timestamp is requested, a pointer to the skb is stored in the
    ravb_tstamp_skb struct. This was done without an skb_get. There exists
    the possibility that the skb could be freed by ravb_tx_free (when
    ravb_tx_free is called from ravb_start_xmit) before the timestamp was
    processed, leading to a use-after-free bug.
    
    Use skb_get when filling a ravb_tstamp_skb struct, and add appropriate
    frees/consumes when a ravb_tstamp_skb struct is freed.

    There's no need to wait until a completion is received to unmap
    TX descriptor buffers that have been passed to the hypervisor.
    Instead unmap it when the hypervisor call has completed. This patch
    avoids the possibility that a buffer will not be unmapped because
    a TX completion is lost or mishandled.

    vfs: fix page locking deadlocks when deduping files
    
    [ Upstream commit edc58dd0123b552453a74369bd0c8d890b497b4b ]
    
    When dedupe wants to use the page cache to compare parts of two files
    for dedupe, we must be very careful to handle locking correctly.  The
    current code doesn't do this.  It must lock and unlock the page only
    once if the two pages are the same, since the overlapping range check
    doesn't catch this when blocksize < pagesize.  If the pages are distinct
    but from the same file, we must observe page locking order and lock them
    in order of increasing offset to avoid clashing with writeback locking.

    lan78xx: Fix memory leaks
    
    [ Upstream commit b9cbf8a64865b50fd0f4a3915fa00ac7365cdf8f ]
    
    In lan78xx_probe(), a new urb is allocated through usb_alloc_urb() and
    saved to 'dev->urb_intr'. However, in the following execution, if an error
    occurs, 'dev->urb_intr' is not deallocated, leading to memory leaks. To fix
    this issue, invoke usb_free_urb() to free the allocated urb before
    returning from the function.

    [ Upstream commit 20fb7c7a39b5c719e2e619673b5f5729ee7d2306 ]
    
    In myri10ge_probe(), myri10ge_alloc_slices() is invoked to allocate slices
    related structures. Later on, myri10ge_request_irq() is used to get an irq.
    However, if this process fails, the allocated slices related structures are
    not deallocated, leading to memory leaks. To fix this issue, revise the
    target label of the goto statement to 'abort_with_slices'.

    scsi: target: tcmu: avoid use-after-free after command timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit a86a75865ff4d8c05f355d1750a5250aec89ab15 ]
    
    In tcmu_handle_completion() function, the variable called read_len is
    always initialized with a value taken from se_cmd structure. If this
    function is called to complete an expired (timed out) out command, the
    session command pointed by se_cmd is likely to be already deallocated by
    the target core at that moment. As the result, this access triggers a
    use-after-free warning from KASAN.
    
    This patch fixes the code not to touch se_cmd when completing timed out
    TCMU commands. It also resets the pointer to se_cmd at the time when the
    TCMU_CMD_BIT_EXPIRED flag is set because it is going to become invalid
    after calling target_complete_cmd() later in the same function,
    tcmu_check_expired_cmd().

    TCP rst and fin packets do not qualify to place a flow into the

    closure. Without this patch, this flow entry expires and connection
    tracking picks up the entry in ESTABLISHED state using the fixup

    ibmveth: Convert multicast list size for little-endian system
    
    [ Upstream commit 66cf4710b23ab2adda11155684a2c8826f4fe732 ]
    
    The ibm,mac-address-filters property defines the maximum number of
    addresses the hypervisor's multicast filter list can support. It is
    encoded as a big-endian integer in the OF device tree, but the virtual
    ethernet driver does not convert it for use by little-endian systems.
    As a result, the driver is not behaving as it should on affected systems
    when a large number of multicast addresses are assigned to the device.

    On WCN3990 downloading the NVM sometimes fails with a "TLV response

    It seems the controller needs a short time after downloading the
    firmware before it is ready for the NVM. A delay as short as 1 ms
    seems sufficient, make it 10 ms just in case. No event is received
    during the delay, hence we don't just silently drop an extra event.

    [ Upstream commit 6a0a8d10a3661a036b55af695542a714c429ab7c ]
    
    If a rule that has already a bound anonymous set fails to be added, the
    preparation phase releases the rule and the bound set. However, the
    transaction object from the abort path still has a reference to the set
    object that is stale, leading to a use-after-free when checking for the
    set->bound field. Add a new field to the transaction that specifies if
    the set is bound, so the abort path can skip releasing it since the rule
    command owns it and it takes care of releasing it. After this update,
    the set->bound field is removed.

    To fix this use BCM2835_AUX_SPI_STAT_RX_LVL to determine when we may
    read data from the fifo reliably without any corruption.
    
    Surprisingly the only values ever empirically read in
    BCM2835_AUX_SPI_STAT_RX_LVL are 0x00, 0x10, 0x20 and 0x30.
    So whenever the mask is not 0 we can read from the fifo in a safe manner.
    
    The patch has now been tested intensively and we are no longer
    able to reproduce the "RX" issue any longer.

    [ Upstream commit c7de8500fd8ecbb544846dd5f11dca578c3777e1 ]
    
    This read of the fifo is a potential candidate for a race condition
    as the spi transfer is not necessarily finished and so can lead to
    an early read of the fifo that still misses data.
    
    So it has been removed.

    x86/boot: Preserve boot_params.secure_boot from sanitizing
    
    commit 29d9a0b50736768f042752070e5cdf4e4d4c00df upstream.
    
    Commit
    
      a90118c445cc ("x86/boot: Save fields explicitly, zero out everything else")
    
    now zeroes the secure boot setting information (enabled/disabled/...)
    passed by the boot loader or by the kernel's EFI handover mechanism.
    
    The problem manifests itself with signed kernels using the EFI handoff
    protocol with grub and the kernel loses the information whether secure
    boot is enabled in the firmware, i.e., the log message "Secure boot
    enabled" becomes "Secure boot could not be determined".
    
    efi_main() arch/x86/boot/compressed/eboot.c sets this field early but it
    is subsequently zeroed by the above referenced commit.
    
    Include boot_params.secure_boot in the preserve field list.

    tcp: remove empty skb from write queue in error cases
    
    [ Upstream commit fdfc5c8594c24c5df883583ebd286321a80e0a67 ]
    
    Vladimir Rutsky reported stuck TCP sessions after memory pressure
    events. Edge Trigger epoll() user would never receive an EPOLLOUT
    notification allowing them to retry a sendmsg().
    
    Jason tested the case of sk_stream_alloc_skb() returning NULL,
    but there are other paths that could lead both sendmsg() and sendpage()
    to return -1 (EAGAIN), with an empty skb queued on the write queue.
    
    This patch makes sure we remove this empty skb so that
    Jason code can detect that the queue is empty, and
    call sk->sk_write_space(sk) accordingly.

    [ Upstream commit 888a5c53c0d8be6e98bc85b677f179f77a647873 ]
    
    TCP associates tx timestamp requests with a byte in the bytestream.
    If merging skbs in tcp_mtu_probe, migrate the tstamp request.
    
    Similar to MSG_EOR, do not allow moving a timestamp from any segment
    in the probe but the last. This to avoid merging multiple timestamps.

    The devicetree binding lists the phy phy as optional. As such, the
    driver should not bail out if it can't find a regulator. Instead it
    should just skip the remaining regulator related code and continue
    on normally.
    
    Skip the remainder of phy_power_on() if a regulator supply isn't
    available. This also gets rid of the bogus return code.

    net_sched: fix a NULL pointer deref in ipt action
    
    [ Upstream commit 981471bd3abf4d572097645d765391533aac327d ]
    
    The net pointer in struct xt_tgdtor_param is not explicitly
    initialized therefore is still NULL when dereferencing it.
    So we have to find a way to pass the correct net pointer to
    ipt_destroy_target().
    
    The best way I find is just saving the net pointer inside the per
    netns struct tcf_idrinfo, which could make this patch smaller.

    net: sched: act_sample: fix psample group handling on overwrite
    
    [ Upstream commit dbf47a2a094edf58983265e323ca4bdcdb58b5ee ]
    
    Action sample doesn't properly handle psample_group pointer in overwrite
    case. Following issues need to be fixed:
    
    - In tcf_sample_init() function RCU_INIT_POINTER() is used to set
      s->psample_group, even though we neither setting the pointer to NULL, nor
      preventing concurrent readers from accessing the pointer in some way.
      Use rcu_swap_protected() instead to safely reset the pointer.
    
    - Old value of s->psample_group is not released or deallocated in any way,
      which results resource leak. Use psample_group_put() on non-NULL value
      obtained with rcu_swap_protected().
    
    - The function psample_group_put() that released reference to struct
      psample_group pointed by rcu-pointer s->psample_group doesn't respect rcu
      grace period when deallocating it. Extend struct psample_group with rcu
      head and use kfree_rcu when freeing it.
