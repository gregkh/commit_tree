    perf tools: do not look at ./config for configuration
    
    commit aba8d056078e47350d85b06a9cabd5afcc4b72ea upstream.
    
    In addition to /etc/perfconfig and $HOME/.perfconfig, perf looks for
    configuration in the file ./config, imitating git which looks at
    $GIT_DIR/config.  If ./config is not a perf configuration file, it
    fails, or worse, treats it as a configuration file and changes behavior
    in some unexpected way.
    
    "config" is not an unusual name for a file to be lying around and perf
    does not have a private directory dedicated for its own use, so let's
    just stop looking for configuration in the cwd.  Callers needing
    context-sensitive configuration can use the PERF_CONFIG environment
    variable.

    drm/radeon/kms: don't try to be smart in the hpd handler
    
    commit d5811e8731213f80c80d89e980505052f16aca1c upstream.
    
    Attempting to try and turn off disconnected display hw in the
    hotput handler lead to more problems than it helped.  For
    now just register an event and only attempt the do something
    interesting with DP.  Other connectors are just too problematic:
    - Some systems have an HPD pin assigned to LVDS, but it's rarely
    if ever connected properly and we don't really care about hpd
    events on LVDS anyway since it's always connected.
    - The HPD pin is wired up correctly for eDP, but we don't really
    have to do anything since the events since it's always connected.
    - Some HPD pins fire more than once when you connect/disconnect
    - etc.

    lguest: allow booting guest with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
    
    commit e22a539824e8ddb82c87b4f415165ede82e6ab56 upstream.
    
    The CONFIG_RELOCATABLE code tries to align the unpack destination to
    the value of 'kernel_alignment' in the setup_hdr.  If that's 0, it
    tries to unpack to address 0, which in fact causes the gunzip code
    to call 'error("Out of memory while allocating output buffer")'.
    
    The bootloader (ie. the lguest Launcher in this case) should be doing
    setting this field; the normal bzImage is 16M, we can use the same.

    mm: fix wrong vmap address calculations with odd NR_CPUS values
    
    commit f982f91516fa4cfd9d20518833cd04ad714585be upstream.
    
    Commit db64fe02258f ("mm: rewrite vmap layer") introduced code that does
    address calculations under the assumption that VMAP_BLOCK_SIZE is a
    power of two.  However, this might not be true if CONFIG_NR_CPUS is not
    set to a power of two.
    
    Wrong vmap_block index/offset values could lead to memory corruption.
    However, this has never been observed in practice (or never been
    diagnosed correctly); what caught this was the BUG_ON in vb_alloc() that
    checks for inconsistent vmap_block indices.
    
    To fix this, ensure that VMAP_BLOCK_SIZE always is a power of two.

    ath5k: fix error handling in ath5k_beacon_send
    
    commit bdc71bc59231f5542af13b5061b9ab124d093050 upstream.
    
    This cleans up error handling for the beacon in case of dma mapping
    failure.  We need to free the skb when dma mapping fails instead of
    nulling and leaking the pointer, and we should bail out to avoid
    giving the hardware the bad descriptor.
    
    Finally, we need to perform the null check after trying to update
    the beacon, or else beacons will never be sent after a single
    mapping failure.

    ASoC: Tegra: wm8903 machine driver: Allow re-insertion of module
    
    commit 29591ed4ac6fe00e3ff23b5be0cdc7016ef9c47e upstream.
    
    Two issues were preventing module snd-soc-tegra-wm8903.ko from being
    removed and re-inserted:
    
    a) The speaker-enable GPIO is hosted by the WM8903 chip. This GPIO must
       be freed before snd_soc_unregister_card() is called, because that
       triggers wm8903.c:wm8903_remove(), which calls gpiochip_remove(), which
       then fails if any of the GPIOs are in use. To solve this, free all GPIOs
       first, so the code doesn't care where they come from.
    
    b) We need to call snd_soc_jack_free_gpios() to match the call to
       snd_soc_jack_add_gpios() during initialization. Without this, the
       call to snd_soc_jack_add_gpios() fails during any subsequent modprobe
       and initialization, since the GPIO and IRQ are already registered. In
       turn, this causes the headphone state not to be monitored, so the
       headphone is assumed not to be plugged in, and the audio path to it is
       never enabled.

    commit 72c487dfb94d02025fb7437dfe2314d836d5a9ab upstream.
    
    an 'unhandled fault' is causes when a gadget driver calls
    usb_gadget_connect() while the USB cable isn't plugged into
    the OTG port.
    
    the fault is caused by an access to MUSB's memory space
    while its clock is turned off due to pm_runtime kicking
    in.
    
    in order to fix the fault, we enclose musb_gadget_pullup()
    with pm_runtime_get_sync() ... pm_runtime_put() calls to
    be sure we will always reach that path with clock turned on.

    usb/config: use proper endian access for wMaxPacketSize
    
    commit 7de7c7d2cb49900e0b967be871bf695c7d6135c9 upstream.
    
    wMaxPacketSize is __le16 and should be accessed as such. Also fix the
    wBytesPerInterval assignment while here.
    
    v2: also fix the wBytesPerInterval assigment, noticed by Matt Evans
    
    This patch should be backported to the 3.0 kernel.

    xhci: Don't submit commands or URBs to halted hosts.
    
    commit 7bd89b4017f46a9b92853940fd9771319acb578a upstream.
    
    Commit fccf4e86200b8f5edd9a65da26f150e32ba79808
    "USB: Free bandwidth when usb_disable_device is called" caused a bit of an
    issue when the xHCI host controller driver is unloaded.  It changed the
    USB core to remove all endpoints when a USB device is disabled.  When the
    driver is unloaded, it will remove the SuperSpeed split root hub, which
    will disable all devices under that roothub and then halt the host
    controller.  When the second High Speed split roothub is removed, the USB
    core will attempt to disable the endpoints, which will submit a Configure
    Endpoint command to a halted host controller.
    
    The command will eventually time out, but it makes the xHCI driver unload
    take *minutes* if there are a couple of USB 1.1/2.0 devices attached.  We
    must halt the host controller when the SuperSpeed roothub is removed,
    because we can't allow any interrupts from things like port status
    changes.
    
    Make several different functions not submit commands or URBs to the host
    controller when the host is halted, by adding a check in
    xhci_check_args().  xhci_check_args() is used by these functions:
    
    xhci.c-int xhci_urb_enqueue()
    xhci.c-int xhci_drop_endpoint()
    xhci.c-int xhci_add_endpoint()
    xhci.c-int xhci_check_bandwidth()
    xhci.c-void xhci_reset_bandwidth()
    xhci.c-static int xhci_check_streams_endpoint()
    xhci.c-int xhci_discover_or_reset_device()
    
    It's also used by xhci_free_dev().  However, we have to take special
    care in that case, because we want the device memory to be freed if the
    host controller is halted.
    
    This patch should be backported to the 2.6.39 and 3.0 kernel.

    USB: xhci: fix OS want to own HC
    
    commit 6768458b17f9bf48a4c3a34e49b20344091b5f7e upstream.
    
    Software should set XHCI_HC_OS_OWNED bit to request ownership of xHC.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as far back as 2.6.31.

    declaring MODULE_FIRMWARE has apparently forgotten while removing the embedded
