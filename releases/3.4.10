    usb: gadget: u_ether: fix kworker 100% CPU issue with still used interfaces in eth_stop
    
    commit b1b552a69b8805e7e338074a9e8b670b4a795218 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue introduced by patch:
    
        72c973d usb: gadget: add usb_endpoint_descriptor to struct usb_ep
    
    Without this patch we see a kworker taking 100% CPU, after this sequence:
    
    - Connect gadget to a windows host
    - load g_ether
    - ifconfig up <ip>; ifconfig down; ifconfig up
    - ping <windows host>
    
    The "ifconfig down" results in calling eth_stop(), which will call
    usb_ep_disable() and, if the carrier is still ok, usb_ep_enable():
    
             usb_ep_disable(link->in_ep);
             usb_ep_disable(link->out_ep);
             if (netif_carrier_ok(net)) {
                     usb_ep_enable(link->in_ep);
                     usb_ep_enable(link->out_ep);
             }
    
    The ep should stay enabled, but will not, as ep_disable set the desc
    pointer to NULL, therefore the subsequent ep_enable will fail. This leads
    to permanent rescheduling of the eth_work() worker as usb_ep_queue()
    (called by the worker) will fail due to the unconfigured endpoint.
    
    We fix this issue by saving the ep descriptors and re-assign them before
    usb_ep_enable().

    xhci: Fix bug after deq ptr set to link TRB.
    
    commit 50d0206fcaea3e736f912fd5b00ec6233fb4ce44 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a particularly nasty bug that was revealed by the ring
    expansion patches.  The bug has been present since the very beginning of
    the xHCI driver history, and could have caused general protection faults
    from bad memory accesses.
    
    The first thing to note is that a Set TR Dequeue Pointer command can
    move the dequeue pointer to a link TRB, if the canceled or stalled
    transfer TD ended just before a link TRB.  The function to increment the
    dequeue pointer, inc_deq, was written before cancellation and stall
    support was added.  It assumed that the dequeue pointer could never
    point to a link TRB.  It would unconditionally increment the dequeue
    pointer at the start of the function, check if the pointer was now on a
    link TRB, and move it to the top of the next segment if so.
    
    This means that if a Set TR Dequeue Point command moved the dequeue
    pointer to a link TRB, a subsequent call to inc_deq() would move the
    pointer off the segment and into la-la-land.  It would then read from
    that memory to determine if it was a link TRB.  Other functions would
    often call inc_deq() until the dequeue pointer matched some other
    pointer, which means this function would quite happily read all of
    system memory before wrapping around to the right pointer value.
    
    Often, there would be another endpoint segment from a different ring
    allocated from the same DMA pool, which would be contiguous to the
    segment inc_deq just stepped off of.  inc_deq would eventually find the
    link TRB in that segment, and blindly move the dequeue pointer back to
    the top of the correct ring segment.
    
    The only reason the original code worked at all is because there was
    only one ring segment.  With the ring expansion patches, the dequeue
    pointer would eventually wrap into place, but the dequeue segment would
    be out-of-sync.  On the second TD after the dequeue pointer was moved to
    a link TRB, trb_in_td() would fail (because the dequeue pointer and
    dequeue segment were out-of-sync), and this message would appear:
    
    ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD
    
    This fixes bugzilla entry 4333 (option-based modem unhappy on USB 3.0
    port: "Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD", "rejecting
    I/O to offline device"),
    
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43333
    
    and possibly other general protection fault bugs as well.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31.  A separate
    patch will be created for kernels older than 3.4, since inc_deq was
    modified in 3.4 and this patch will not apply.

    xhci: Switch PPT ports to EHCI on shutdown.
    
    commit e95829f474f0db3a4d940cae1423783edd966027 upstream.
    
    The Intel desktop boards DH77EB and DH77DF have a hardware issue that
    can be worked around by BIOS.  If the USB ports are switched to xHCI on
    shutdown, the xHCI host will send a spurious interrupt, which will wake
    the system.  Some BIOS will work around this, but not all.
    
    The bug can be avoided if the USB ports are switched back to EHCI on
    shutdown.  The Intel Windows driver switches the ports back to EHCI, so
    change the Linux xHCI driver to do the same.
    
    Unfortunately, we can't tell the two effected boards apart from other
    working motherboards, because the vendors will change the DMI strings
    for the DH77EB and DH77DF boards to their own custom names.  One example
    is Compulab's mini-desktop, the Intense-PC.  Instead, key off the
    Panther Point xHCI host PCI vendor and device ID, and switch the ports
    over for all PPT xHCI hosts.
    
    The only impact this will have on non-effected boards is to add a couple
    hundred milliseconds delay on boot when the BIOS has to switch the ports
    over from EHCI to xHCI.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
    the commit 69e848c2090aebba5698a1620604c7dccb448684 "Intel xhci: Support

    commit 22ceac191211cf6688b1bf6ecd93c8b6bf80ed9b upstream.
    
    The NEC/Renesas 720201 xHCI host controller does not complete its reset
    within 250 milliseconds.  In fact, it takes about 9 seconds to reset the
    host controller, and 1 second for the host to be ready for doorbell
    rings.  Extend the reset and CNR polling timeout to 10 seconds each.

    xhci: Add Etron XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk.
    
    commit 5cb7df2b2d3afee7638b3ef23a5bcb89c6f07bd9 upstream.
    
    Gary reports that with recent kernels, he notices more xHCI driver
    warnings:
    
    xhci_hcd 0000:03:00.0: WARN Successful completion on short TX: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
    
    We think his Etron xHCI host controller may have the same buggy behavior
    as the Fresco Logic xHCI host.  When a short transfer is received, the
    host will mark the transfer as successfully completed when it should be
    marking it with a short completion.
    
    Fix this by turning on the XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk when the Etron
    host is discovered.  Note that Gary has revision 1, but if Etron fixes
    this bug in future revisions, the quirk will have no effect.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.36, that
    contain a backported version of commit
    1530bbc6272d9da1e39ef8e06190d42c13a02733 "xhci: Add new short TX quirk

    This could be reproduced as follows:
    
    The problem in commit 968dee7722 was that caused the variable 'i' to
    be left uninitialized if the truncate required more space than was
    available in the journal.  This resulted in the function
    ext4_ext_truncate_extend_restart() returning -EAGAIN, which caused
    ext4_ext_remove_space() to restart the truncate operation after
    starting a new jbd2 handle.

    ext4: make sure the journal sb is written in ext4_clear_journal_err()
    
    commit d796c52ef0b71a988364f6109aeb63d79c5b116b upstream.
    
    After we transfer set the EXT4_ERROR_FS bit in the file system
    superblock, it's not enough to call jbd2_journal_clear_err() to clear
    the error indication from journal superblock --- we need to call
    jbd2_journal_update_sb_errno() as well.  Otherwise, when the root file
    system is mounted read-only, the journal is replayed, and the error
    indicator is transferred to the superblock --- but the s_errno field
    in the jbd2 superblock is left set (since although we cleared it in
    memory, we never flushed it out to disk).
    
    This can end up confusing e2fsck.  We should make e2fsck more robust
    in this case, but the kernel shouldn't be leaving things in this
    confused state, either.

    drm/radeon: do not reenable crtc after moving vram start address
    
    commit 81ee8fb6b52ec69eeed37fe7943446af1dccecc5 upstream.
    
    It seems we can not update the crtc scanout address. After disabling
    crtc, update to base address do not take effect after crtc being
    reenable leading to at least frame being scanout from the old crtc
    base address. Disabling crtc display request lead to same behavior.
    
    So after changing the vram address if we don't keep crtc disabled
    we will have the GPU trying to read some random system memory address
    with some iommu this will broke the crtc engine and will lead to
    broken display and iommu error message.
    
    So to avoid this, disable crtc. For flicker less boot we will need
    to avoid moving the vram start address.
    
    This patch should also fix :

    drm/i915: reorder edp disabling to fix ivb MacBook Air
    
    commit 35a38556d900b9cb5dfa2529c93944b847f8a8a4 upstream.
    
    eDP is tons of fun. It turns out that at least the new MacBook Air 5,1
    model absolutely doesn't like the new force vdd dance we've introduced
    in
    
    commit 6cb49835da0426f69a2931bc2a0a8156344b0e41

        drm/i915: enable vdd when switching off the eDP panel
    
    But that patch also tried to fix some neat edp sequence issue with the
    force_vdd timings. Closer inspection reveals that we've raised
    force_vdd only to do the aux channel communication dp_sink_dpms. If we
    move the edp_panel_off below that, we don't need any force_vdd for the
    disable sequence, which makes the Air happy.
    
    Unfortunately the reporter of the original bug that the above commit
    fixed is travelling, so we can't test whether this regresses things.
    But my theory is that since we don't check for any power-off ->
    force_vdd-on delays in edp_panel_vdd_on, this was the actual
    root-cause of this failure. With that force_vdd dance completely
    eliminated, I'm hopeful the original bug stays fixed, too.
    
    For reference the old bug, which hopefully doesn't get broken by this:
    
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43163
    
    In any case, regression fixers win over plain bugfixes, so this needs
    to go in asap.
    
    v2: The crucial pieces seems to be to clear the force_vdd flag
    uncoditionally, too, in edp_panel_off. Looks like this is left behind
    by the firmware somehow.
    
    v3: The Apple firmware seems to switch off the panel on it's own, hence
    we still need to keep force_vdd on, but properly clear it when switching
    the panel off.

    We may only start to set up the new register values after having
    confirmed that the ring is truely off. Otherwise the hw might lose the
    newly written register values. This is caught later on in the init
    sequence, when we check whether the register writes have stuck.

    High frequency link configurations have the potential to cause trouble

    configurations that lie about available lanes, so if we run into that we

    xen: mark local pages as FOREIGN in the m2p_override
    
    commit b9e0d95c041ca2d7ad297ee37c2e9cfab67a188f upstream.
    
    When the frontend and the backend reside on the same domain, even if we
    add pages to the m2p_override, these pages will never be returned by
    mfn_to_pfn because the check "get_phys_to_machine(pfn) != mfn" will
    always fail, so the pfn of the frontend will be returned instead
    (resulting in a deadlock because the frontend pages are already locked).

     [<ffffffff81a18d69>] system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
    
    The explanation is in the comment within the code:
    
    We need to do this because the pages shared by the frontend
    (xen-blkfront) can be already locked (lock_page, called by
    do_read_cache_page); when the userspace backend tries to use them
    with direct_IO, mfn_to_pfn returns the pfn of the frontend, so
    do_blockdev_direct_IO is going to try to lock the same pages
    again resulting in a deadlock.
    
    A simplified call graph looks like this:
    
    pygrub                          QEMU
    -----------------------------------------------
    do_read_cache_page              io_submit
      |                              |
    lock_page                       ext3_direct_IO
                                     |
                                    bio_add_page
                                     |
                                    lock_page
    
    Internally the xen-blkback uses m2p_add_override to swizzle (temporarily)
    a 'struct page' to have a different MFN (so that it can point to another
    guest). It also can easily find out whether another pfn corresponding
    to the mfn exists in the m2p, and can set the FOREIGN bit
    in the p2m, making sure that mfn_to_pfn returns the pfn of the backend.
    
    This allows the backend to perform direct_IO on these pages, but as a
    side effect prevents the frontend from using get_user_pages_fast on
    them while they are being shared with the backend.

    fuse: verify all ioctl retry iov elements
    
    commit fb6ccff667712c46b4501b920ea73a326e49626a upstream.
    
    Commit 7572777eef78ebdee1ecb7c258c0ef94d35bad16 attempted to verify that
    the total iovec from the client doesn't overflow iov_length() but it
    only checked the first element.  The iovec could still overflow by
    starting with a small element.  The obvious fix is to check all the
    elements.
    
    The overflow case doesn't look dangerous to the kernel as the copy is
    limited by the length after the overflow.  This fix restores the
    intention of returning an error instead of successfully copying less
    than the iovec represented.
    
    I found this by code inspection.  I built it but don't have a test case.
    I'm cc:ing stable because the initial commit did as well.

    s390/compat: fix mmap compat system calls
    
    commit e85871218513c54f7dfdb6009043cb638f2fecbe upstream.
    
    The native 31 bit and the compat behaviour for the mmap system calls differ:
    
    In native 31 bit mode the passed in address for the mmap system call will be
    unmodified passed to sys_mmap_pgoff().
    In compat mode however the passed in address will be modified with
    compat_ptr() which masks out the most significant bit.
    
    The result is that in native 31 bit mode each mmap request (with MAP_FIXED)
    will fail where the most significat bit is set, while in compat mode it
    may succeed.
    
    This odd behaviour was introduced with d3815898 "[S390] mmap: add missing
    compat_ptr conversion to both mmap compat syscalls".
    
    To restore a consistent behaviour accross native and compat mode this
    patch functionally reverts the above mentioned commit.

    s390/compat: fix compat wrappers for process_vm system calls
    
    commit 82aabdb6f1eb61e0034ec23901480f5dd23db7c4 upstream.
    
    The compat wrappers incorrectly called the non compat versions of
    the system process_vm system calls.
