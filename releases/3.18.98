    net: gianfar_ptp: move set_fipers() to spinlock protecting area
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 11d827a993a969c3c6ec56758ff63a44ba19b466 ]
    
    set_fipers() calling should be protected by spinlock in
    case that any interrupt breaks related registers setting
    and the function we expect. This patch is to move set_fipers()
    to spinlock protecting area in ptp_gianfar_adjtime().

    sctp: make use of pre-calculated len
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c76f97c99ae6d26d14c7f0e50e074382bfbc9f98 ]
    
    Some sockopt handling functions were calculating the length of the
    buffer to be written to userspace and then calculating it again when
    actually writing the buffer, which could lead to some write not using
    an up-to-date length.
    
    This patch updates such places to just make use of the len variable.
    
    Also, replace some sizeof(type) to sizeof(var).

    xen/gntdev: Fix partial gntdev_mmap() cleanup
    
    
    [ Upstream commit cf2acf66ad43abb39735568f55e1f85f9844e990 ]
    
    When cleaning up after a partially successful gntdev_mmap(), unmap the
    successfully mapped grant pages otherwise Xen will kill the domain if
    in debug mode (Attempt to implicitly unmap a granted PTE) or Linux will
    kill the process and emit "BUG: Bad page map in process" if Xen is in
    release mode.
    
    This is only needed when use_ptemod is true because gntdev_put_map()
    will unmap grant pages itself when use_ptemod is false.

    The 'sh_eth' driver's probe() method would fail  on the SolutionEngine7710
    board and crash on SolutionEngine7712 board  as the platform code is
    hopelessly behind the driver's platform data --  it passes the PHY address
    instead of 'struct sh_eth_plat_data *'; pass the latter to the driver in

    [ Upstream commit b707fda2df4070785d0fa8a278aa13944c5f51f8 ]
    
    When loading the module after unloading it, the network interface would
    not be enabled and thus wouldn't have a backend counterpart and unable
    to be used by the guest.
    
    The guest would face errors like:
    
      [root@guest ~]# ethtool -i eth0
      Cannot get driver information: No such device
    
      [root@guest ~]# ifconfig eth0
      eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found
    
    This patch initializes the state of the netfront device whenever it is
    loaded manually, this state would communicate the netback to create its
    device and establish the connection between them.

    We store per path and per device configuration data to identify the
    path or device correctly. The per path configuration data might get
    mixed up if the original request gets into error recovery and is
    started with a random path mask.
    
    This would lead to a wrong identification of a path in case of a CUIR
    event for example.
    
    Fix by copying the path mask from the original request to the error
    recovery request in case it is a path verification request.

    bnx2x: Improve reliability in case of nested PCI errors
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f7084059a9cb9e56a186e1677b1dcffd76c2cd24 ]
    
    While in recovery process of PCI error (called EEH on PowerPC arch),
    another PCI transaction could be corrupted causing a situation of
    nested PCI errors. Also, this scenario could be reproduced with
    error injection mechanisms (for debug purposes).
    
    We observe that in case of nested PCI errors, bnx2x might attempt to
    initialize its shmem and cause a kernel crash due to bad addresses
    read from MCP. Multiple different stack traces were observed depending
    on the point the second PCI error happens.
    
    This patch avoids the crashes by:
    
     * failing PCI recovery in case of nested errors (since multiple
     PCI errors in a row are not expected to lead to a functional
     adapter anyway), and by,

    A customer noticed RX path hang when MTU is changed on the fly while
    running heavy traffic with NCSI enabled for 5717 and 5719. Since 5720
    belongs to same ASIC family, we observed same issue and same fix
    could solve this problem for 5720.

    [ Upstream commit d1b8b2391c24751e44f618fcf86fb55d9a9247fd ]
    
    When an I/O is returned with an srb_status of SRB_STATUS_INVALID_LUN
    which has zero good_bytes it must be assigned an error. Otherwise the
    I/O will be continuously requeued and will cause a deadlock in the case
    where disks are being hot added and removed. sd_probe_async will wait
    forever for its I/O to complete while holding scsi_sd_probe_domain.
    
    Also returning the default error of DID_TARGET_FAILURE causes multipath
    to not retry the I/O resulting in applications receiving I/O errors
    before a failover can occur.

    ipv6: icmp6: Allow icmp messages to be looped back
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 588753f1eb18978512b1c9b85fddb457d46f9033 ]
    
    One example of when an ICMPv6 packet is required to be looped back is
    when a host acts as both a Multicast Listener and a Multicast Router.
    
    A Multicast Router will listen on address ff02::16 for MLDv2 messages.
    
    Currently, MLDv2 messages originating from a Multicast Listener running
    on the same host as the Multicast Router are not being delivered to the
    Multicast Router. This is due to dst.input being assigned the default
    value of dst_discard.
    
    This results in the packet being looped back but discarded before being
    delivered to the Multicast Router.
    
    This patch sets dst.input to ip6_input to ensure a looped back packet
    is delivered to the Multicast Router.

    mtd: nand: gpmi: Fix failure when a erased page has a bitflip at BBM
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fdf2e821052958a114618a95ab18a300d0b080cb ]
    
    When erased subpages are read then the BCH decoder returns STATUS_ERASED
    if they are all empty, or STATUS_UNCORRECTABLE if there are bitflips.
    When there are bitflips, we have to set these bits again to show the
    upper layers a completely erased page. When a bitflip happens in the
    exact byte where the bad block marker is, then this byte is swapped
    with another byte in block_mark_swapping(). The correction code then
    detects a bitflip in another subpage and no longer corrects the bitflip
    where it really happens.
    
    Correct this behaviour by calling block_mark_swapping() after the
    bitflips have been corrected.
    
    In our case UBIFS failed with this bug because it expects erased
    pages to be really empty:
    
    UBIFS error (pid 187): ubifs_scan: corrupt empty space at LEB 36:118735
    UBIFS error (pid 187): ubifs_scanned_corruption: corruption at LEB 36:118735

    hrtimer: Ensure POSIX compliance (relative CLOCK_REALTIME hrtimers)
    
    commit 48d0c9becc7f3c66874c100c126459a9da0fdced upstream.
    
    The POSIX specification defines that relative CLOCK_REALTIME timers are not
    affected by clock modifications. Those timers have to use CLOCK_MONOTONIC
    to ensure POSIX compliance.
    
    The introduction of the additional HRTIMER_MODE_PINNED mode broke this
    requirement for pinned timers.
    
    There is no user space visible impact because user space timers are not
    using pinned mode, but for consistency reasons this needs to be fixed.
    
    Check whether the mode has the HRTIMER_MODE_REL bit set instead of
    comparing with HRTIMER_MODE_ABS.

    ipv6: Skip XFRM lookup if dst_entry in socket cache is valid
    
    commit 00bc0ef5880dc7b82f9c320dead4afaad48e47be upstream.
    
    At present we perform an xfrm_lookup() for each UDPv6 message we
    send. The lookup involves querying the flow cache (flow_cache_lookup)
    and, in case of a cache miss, creating an XFRM bundle.
    
    If we miss the flow cache, we can end up creating a new bundle and
    deriving the path MTU (xfrm_init_pmtu) from on an already transformed
    dst_entry, which we pass from the socket cache (sk->sk_dst_cache) down
    to xfrm_lookup(). This can happen only if we're caching the dst_entry
    in the socket, that is when we're using a connected UDP socket.
    
    To put it another way, the path MTU shrinks each time we miss the flow
    cache, which later on leads to incorrectly fragmented payload. It can
    be observed with ESPv6 in transport mode:
    
      1) Set up a transformation and lower the MTU to trigger fragmentation
        # ip xfrm policy add dir out src ::1 dst ::1 \
          tmpl src ::1 dst ::1 proto esp spi 1
        # ip xfrm state add src ::1 dst ::1 \
          proto esp spi 1 enc 'aes' 0x0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b
        # ip link set dev lo mtu 1500
    
      2) Monitor the packet flow and set up an UDP sink
        # tcpdump -ni lo -ttt &
        # socat udp6-listen:12345,fork /dev/null &
    
      3) Send a datagram that needs fragmentation with a connected socket
        # perl -e 'print "@" x 1470 | socat - udp6:[::1]:12345
        2016/06/07 18:52:52 socat[724] E read(3, 0x555bb3d5ba00, 8192): Protocol error
        00:00:00.000000 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (0|1448) ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x2), length 1448
        00:00:00.000014 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (1448|32)
        00:00:00.000050 IP6 ::1 > ::1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x3), length 1272
        (^ ICMPv6 Parameter Problem)
        00:00:00.000022 IP6 ::1 > ::1: ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x5), length 136
    
      4) Compare it to a non-connected socket
        # perl -e 'print "@" x 1500' | socat - udp6-sendto:[::1]:12345
        00:00:40.535488 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (0|1448) ESP(spi=0x00000001,seq=0x6), length 1448
        00:00:00.000010 IP6 ::1 > ::1: frag (1448|64)
    
    What happens in step (3) is:
    
      1) when connecting the socket in __ip6_datagram_connect(), we
         perform an XFRM lookup, miss the flow cache, create an XFRM
         bundle, and cache the destination,
    
      2) afterwards, when sending the datagram, we perform an XFRM lookup,
         again, miss the flow cache (due to mismatch of flowi6_iif and
         flowi6_oif, which is an issue of its own), and recreate an XFRM
         bundle based on the cached (and already transformed) destination.
    
    To prevent the recreation of an XFRM bundle, avoid an XFRM lookup
    altogether whenever we already have a destination entry cached in the
    socket. This prevents the path MTU shrinkage and brings us on par with
    UDPv4.
    
    The fix also benefits connected PINGv6 sockets, another user of
    ip6_sk_dst_lookup_flow(), who also suffer messages being transformed
    twice.
