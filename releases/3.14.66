    perf/x86/intel: Fix PEBS data source interpretation on Nehalem/Westmere
    
    commit e17dc65328057c00db7e1bfea249c8771a78b30b upstream.
    
    Jiri reported some time ago that some entries in the PEBS data source table
    in perf do not agree with the SDM. We investigated and the bits
    changed for Sandy Bridge, but the SDM was not updated.
    
    perf already implements the bits correctly for Sandy Bridge
    and later. This patch patches it up for Nehalem and Westmere.

    perf/x86/intel: Use PAGE_SIZE for PEBS buffer size on Core2
    
    commit e72daf3f4d764c47fb71c9bdc7f9c54a503825b1 upstream.
    
    Using PAGE_SIZE buffers makes the WRMSR to PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL in
    intel_pmu_enable_all() mysteriously hang on Core2. As a workaround, we
    don't do this.
    
    The hard lockup is easily triggered by running 'perf test attr'
    repeatedly. Most of the time it gets stuck on sample session with
    small periods.

    sched/cputime: Fix steal time accounting vs. CPU hotplug
    
    commit e9532e69b8d1d1284e8ecf8d2586de34aec61244 upstream.
    
    On CPU hotplug the steal time accounting can keep a stale rq->prev_steal_time
    value over CPU down and up. So after the CPU comes up again the delta
    calculation in steal_account_process_tick() wreckages itself due to the
    unsigned math:
    
             u64 steal = paravirt_steal_clock(smp_processor_id());
    
             steal -= this_rq()->prev_steal_time;
    
    So if steal is smaller than rq->prev_steal_time we end up with an insane large
    value which then gets added to rq->prev_steal_time, resulting in a permanent
    wreckage of the accounting. As a consequence the per CPU stats in /proc/stat
    become stale.
    
    Nice trick to tell the world how idle the system is (100%) while the CPU is
    100% busy running tasks. Though we prefer realistic numbers.
    
    None of the accounting values which use a previous value to account for
    fractions is reset at CPU hotplug time. update_rq_clock_task() has a sanity
    check for prev_irq_time and prev_steal_time_rq, but that sanity check solely
    deals with clock warps and limits the /proc/stat visible wreckage. The
    prev_time values are still wrong.
    
    Solution is simple: Reset rq->prev_*_time when the CPU is plugged in again.

    ocfs2/dlm: fix BUG in dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list
    
    commit be12b299a83fc807bbaccd2bcb8ec50cbb0cb55c upstream.
    
    When master handles convert request, it queues ast first and then
    returns status.  This may happen that the ast is sent before the request
    status because the above two messages are sent by two threads.  And
    right after the ast is sent, if master down, it may trigger BUG in
    dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list in the requested node because ast
    handler moves it to grant list without clear lock->convert_pending.  So
    remove BUG_ON statement and check if the ast is processed in
    dlmconvert_remote.

    ocfs2/dlm: fix race between convert and recovery
    
    commit ac7cf246dfdbec3d8fed296c7bf30e16f5099dac upstream.
    
    There is a race window between dlmconvert_remote and
    dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, which will cause a lock with
    OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY in grant list, thus system hangs.
    
    dlmconvert_remote
    {
            spin_lock(&res->spinlock);
            list_move_tail(&lock->list, &res->converting);
            lock->convert_pending = 1;
            spin_unlock(&res->spinlock);
    
            status = dlm_send_remote_convert_request();
            >>>>>> race window, master has queued ast and return DLM_NORMAL,
                   and then down before sending ast.
                   this node detects master down and calls
                   dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list, which will revert the
                   lock to grant list.
                   Then OCFS2_LOCK_BUSY won't be cleared as new master won't
                   send ast any more because it thinks already be authorized.
    
            spin_lock(&res->spinlock);
            lock->convert_pending = 0;
            if (status != DLM_NORMAL)
                    dlm_revert_pending_convert(res, lock);
            spin_unlock(&res->spinlock);
    }
    
    In this case, check if res->state has DLM_LOCK_RES_RECOVERING bit set
    (res is still in recovering) or res master changed (new master has
    finished recovery), reset the status to DLM_RECOVERING, then it will
    retry convert.

    This patch fixes an active I/O shutdown bug for fabric

    usage in target_wait_for_sess_cmds() and always complete()
    during se_cmd target_release_cmd_kref() put, in order to
    let caller invoke the final fabric release callback
    into se_cmd->se_tfo->release_cmd() code.

    kbuild/mkspec: fix grub2 installkernel issue
    
    commit c8b08ca558c0067bc9e15ce3f1e70af260410bb2 upstream.
    
    mkspec is copying built kernel to temporrary location
    
            /boot/vmlinuz-$KERNELRELEASE-rpm
    
    and runs installkernel on it. This however directly leads to grub2
    menuentry for this suffixed binary being generated as well during the run
    of installkernel script.
    
    Later in the process the temporary -rpm suffixed files are removed, and
    therefore we end up with spurious (and non-functional) grub2 menu entries
    for each installed kernel RPM.
    
    Fix that by using a different temporary name (prefixed by '.'), so that
    the binary is not recognized as an actual kernel binary and no menuentry
    is created for it.

    tracing: Fix trace_printk() to print when not using bprintk()
    
    commit 3debb0a9ddb16526de8b456491b7db60114f7b5e upstream.
    
    The trace_printk() code will allocate extra buffers if the compile detects
    that a trace_printk() is used. To do this, the format of the trace_printk()
    is saved to the __trace_printk_fmt section, and if that section is bigger
    than zero, the buffers are allocated (along with a message that this has
    happened).
    
    If trace_printk() uses a format that is not a constant, and thus something
    not guaranteed to be around when the print happens, the compiler optimizes
    the fmt out, as it is not used, and the __trace_printk_fmt section is not
    filled. This means the kernel will not allocate the special buffers needed
    for the trace_printk() and the trace_printk() will not write anything to the
    tracing buffer.
    
    Adding a "__used" to the variable in the __trace_printk_fmt section will
    keep it around, even though it is set to NULL. This will keep the string
    from being printed in the debugfs/tracing/printk_formats section as it is
    not needed.

    tracing: Have preempt(irqs)off trace preempt disabled functions
    
    commit cb86e05390debcc084cfdb0a71ed4c5dbbec517d upstream.
    
    Joel Fernandes reported that the function tracing of preempt disabled
    sections was not being reported when running either the preemptirqsoff or
    preemptoff tracers. This was due to the fact that the function tracer
    callback for those tracers checked if irqs were disabled before tracing. But
    this fails when we want to trace preempt off locations as well.
    
    Joel explained that he wanted to see funcitons where interrupts are enabled
    but preemption was disabled. The expected output he wanted:
    
       <...>-2265    1d.h1 3419us : preempt_count_sub <-irq_exit
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3419us : __do_softirq <-irq_exit
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3419us : msecs_to_jiffies <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3420us : irqtime_account_irq <-__do_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d..1 3420us : __local_bh_disable_ip <-__do_softirq

       <...>-2265    1..s1 3421us : hrtimer_run_pending <-run_timer_softirq
       <...>-2265    1..s1 3421us : _raw_spin_lock_irq <-run_timer_softirq
       <...>-2265    1d.s1 3422us : preempt_count_add <-_raw_spin_lock_irq
       <...>-2265    1d.s2 3422us : _raw_spin_unlock_irq <-run_timer_softirq
       <...>-2265    1..s2 3422us : preempt_count_sub <-_raw_spin_unlock_irq
       <...>-2265    1..s1 3423us : rcu_bh_qs <-__do_softirq

       <...>-2265    1d.s1 3423us : __local_bh_enable <-__do_softirq
    
    There's a comment saying that the irq disabled check is because there's a
    possible race that tracing_cpu may be set when the function is executed. But
    I don't remember that race. For now, I added a check for preemption being
    enabled too to not record the function, as there would be no race if that
    was the case. I need to re-investigate this, as I'm now thinking that the
    tracing_cpu will always be correct. But no harm in keeping the check for

    drm/radeon: Don't drop DP 2.7 Ghz link setup on some cards.
    
    commit 459ee1c3fd097ab56ababd8ff4bb7ef6a792de33 upstream.
    
    As observed on Apple iMac10,1, DCE-3.2, RV-730,
    link rate of 2.7 Ghz is not selected, because
    the args.v1.ucConfig flag setting for 2.7 Ghz
    gets overwritten by a following assignment of
    the transmitter to use.
    
    Move link rate setup a few lines down to fix this.
    In practice this didn't have any positive or
    negative effect on display setup on the tested
    iMac10,1 so i don't know if backporting to stable
    makes sense or not.

    ipr: Fix regression when loading firmware
    
    commit 21b81716c6bff24cda52dc75588455f879ddbfe9 upstream.
    
    Commit d63c7dd5bcb9 ("ipr: Fix out-of-bounds null overwrite") removed
    the end of line handling when storing the update_fw sysfs attribute.
    This changed the userpace API because it started refusing writes
    terminated by a line feed, which broke the update tools we already have.
    
    This patch re-adds that handling, so both a write terminated by a line
    feed or not can make it through with the update.

    ipr: Fix out-of-bounds null overwrite
    
    commit d63c7dd5bcb9441af0526d370c43a65ca2c980d9 upstream.
    
    Return value of snprintf is not bound by size value, 2nd argument.
    (https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API-snprintf.html).
    Return value is number of printed chars, can be larger than 2nd
    argument.  Therefore, it can write null byte out of bounds ofbuffer.
    Since snprintf puts null, it does not need to put additional null byte.

    fs/coredump: prevent fsuid=0 dumps into user-controlled directories
    
    commit 378c6520e7d29280f400ef2ceaf155c86f05a71a upstream.
    
    This commit fixes the following security hole affecting systems where
    all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
    
     - The fs.suid_dumpable sysctl is set to 2.
     - The kernel.core_pattern sysctl's value starts with "/". (Systems
       where kernel.core_pattern starts with "|/" are not affected.)
     - Unprivileged user namespace creation is permitted. (This is
       true on Linux >=3.8, but some distributions disallow it by
       default using a distro patch.)
    
    Under these conditions, if a program executes under secure exec rules,
    causing it to run with the SUID_DUMP_ROOT flag, then unshares its user
    namespace, changes its root directory and crashes, the coredump will be
    written using fsuid=0 and a path derived from kernel.core_pattern - but
    this path is interpreted relative to the root directory of the process,
    allowing the attacker to control where a coredump will be written with
    root privileges.
    
    To fix the security issue, always interpret core_pattern for dumps that
    are written under SUID_DUMP_ROOT relative to the root directory of init.

    md: multipath: don't hardcopy bio in .make_request path
    
    commit fafcde3ac1a418688a734365203a12483b83907a upstream.
    
    Inside multipath_make_request(), multipath maps the incoming
    bio into low level device's bio, but it is totally wrong to
    copy the bio into mapped bio via '*mapped_bio = *bio'. For
    example, .__bi_remaining is kept in the copy, especially if
    the incoming bio is chained to via bio splitting, so .bi_end_io
    can't be called for the mapped bio at all in the completing path
    in this kind of situation.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by using clone style.

    splice: handle zero nr_pages in splice_to_pipe()
    
    commit d6785d9152147596f60234157da2b02540c3e60f upstream.
    
    Running the following command:
    
     busybox cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe > /dev/null
    
    with any tracing enabled pretty very quickly leads to various NULL
    pointer dereferences and VM BUG_ON()s, such as these:
    
     BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020
     IP: [<ffffffff8119df6c>] generic_pipe_buf_release+0xc/0x40

    (busybox's cat uses sendfile(2), unlike the coreutils version)
    
    This is because tracing_splice_read_pipe() can call splice_to_pipe()
    with spd->nr_pages == 0.  spd_pages underflows in splice_to_pipe() and
    we fill the page pointers and the other fields of the pipe_buffers with
    garbage.
    
    All other callers of splice_to_pipe() avoid calling it when nr_pages ==
    0, and we could make tracing_splice_read_pipe() do that too, but it
    seems reasonable to have splice_to_page() handle this condition
    gracefully.

    jbd2: fix FS corruption possibility in jbd2_journal_destroy() on umount path
    
    commit c0a2ad9b50dd80eeccd73d9ff962234590d5ec93 upstream.
    
    On umount path, jbd2_journal_destroy() writes latest transaction ID
    (->j_tail_sequence) to be used at next mount.
    
    The bug is that ->j_tail_sequence is not holding latest transaction ID
    in some cases. So, at next mount, there is chance to conflict with
    remaining (not overwritten yet) transactions.
    
            mount (id=10)
            write transaction (id=11)
            write transaction (id=12)
            umount (id=10) <= the bug doesn't write latest ID
    
            mount (id=10)
            write transaction (id=11)
            crash
    
            mount
            [recovery process]
                    transaction (id=11)
                    transaction (id=12) <= valid transaction ID, but old commit
                                           must not replay
    
    Like above, this bug become the cause of recovery failure, or FS
    corruption.
    
    So why ->j_tail_sequence doesn't point latest ID?
    
    Because if checkpoint transactions was reclaimed by memory pressure
    (i.e. bdev_try_to_free_page()), then ->j_tail_sequence is not updated.
    (And another case is, __jbd2_journal_clean_checkpoint_list() is called
    with empty transaction.)
    
    So in above cases, ->j_tail_sequence is not pointing latest
    transaction ID at umount path. Plus, REQ_FLUSH for checkpoint is not
    done too.
    
    So, to fix this problem with minimum changes, this patch updates
    ->j_tail_sequence, and issue REQ_FLUSH.  (With more complex changes,
    some optimizations would be possible to avoid unnecessary REQ_FLUSH
    for example though.)
    
    BTW,
    
            journal->j_tail_sequence =
                    ++journal->j_transaction_sequence;
    
    Increment of ->j_transaction_sequence seems to be unnecessary, but
    ext3 does this.

    ALSA: hda - Fix unconditional GPIO toggle via automute
    
    commit 1f7c6658962fa1260c1658d681bd6bb0c746b99a upstream.
    
    Cirrus HD-audio driver may adjust GPIO pins for EAPD dynamically
    depending on the jack plug state.  This works fine for the auto-mute
    mode where the speaker gets muted upon the HP jack plug.   OTOH, when
    the auto-mute mode is off, this turns off the EAPD unexpectedly
    depending on the jack state, which results in the silent speaker
    output.
    
    This patch fixes the silent speaker output issue by setting GPIO bits
    constantly when the auto-mute mode is off.

    bttv: Width must be a multiple of 16 when capturing planar formats
    
    commit 5c915c68763889f0183a1cc61c84bb228b60124a upstream.
    
    On my bttv card "Hauppauge WinTV [card=10]" capturing in YV12 fmt at max
    size results in a solid green rectangle being captured (all colors 0 in
    YUV).
    
    This turns out to be caused by max-width (924) not being a multiple of 16.
    
    We've likely never hit this problem before since normally xawtv / tvtime,
    etc. will prefer packed pixel formats. But when using a video card which
    is using xf86-video-modesetting + glamor, only planar XVideo fmts are
    available, and xawtv will chose a matching capture format to avoid needing
    to do conversion, triggering the solid green window problem.

    The V4L2_CID_TX_EDID_PRESENT control reports if an EDID is present.
    The adv7511 however still reported the EDID present after disconnecting
    the HDMI cable. Fix the logic regarding this control. And when the EDID

    net: irda: Fix use-after-free in irtty_open()
    
    commit 401879c57f01cbf2da204ad2e8db910525c6dbea upstream.
    
    The N_IRDA line discipline may access the previous line discipline's closed
    and already-fre private data on open [1].
    
    The tty->disc_data field _never_ refers to valid data on entry to the
    line discipline's open() method. Rather, the ldisc is expected to
    initialize that field for its own use for the lifetime of the instance
    (ie. from open() to close() only).

    HID: logitech: fix Dual Action gamepad support

    The patch that added Logitech Dual Action gamepad support forgot to
    update the special driver list for the device. This caused the logitech
    driver not to probe unless kernel module load order was favorable.
    Update the special driver list to fix it. Thanks to Simon Wood for the
    idea.

    Since a crypto_ahash_import() can be called against a request context
    that has not had a crypto_ahash_init() performed, the request context
    needs to be cleared to insure there is no random data present. If not,

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix double-free in error paths after snd_usb_add_audio_stream() call
    
    commit 836b34a935abc91e13e63053d0a83b24dfb5ea78 upstream.
    
    create_fixed_stream_quirk(), snd_usb_parse_audio_interface() and
    create_uaxx_quirk() functions allocate the audioformat object by themselves
    and free it upon error before returning. However, once the object is linked
    to a stream, it's freed again in snd_usb_audio_pcm_free(), thus it'll be
    double-freed, eventually resulting in a memory corruption.
    
    This patch fixes these failures in the error paths by unlinking the audioformat
    object before freeing it.
    
    Based on a patch by Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
    
    [Note for stable backports:
     this patch requires the commit 902eb7fd1e4a ('ALSA: usb-audio: Minor

    commit 0f886ca12765d20124bd06291c82951fd49a33be upstream.
    
    create_fixed_stream_quirk() may cause a NULL-pointer dereference by
    accessing the non-existing endpoint when a USB device with a malformed
    USB descriptor is used.

    Input: powermate - fix oops with malicious USB descriptors
    
    commit 9c6ba456711687b794dcf285856fc14e2c76074f upstream.
    
    The powermate driver expects at least one valid USB endpoint in its
    probe function.  If given malicious descriptors that specify 0 for
    the number of endpoints, it will crash.  Validate the number of
    endpoints on the interface before using them.

    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: Add support for ICP DAS I-756xU devices
    
    commit ea6db90e750328068837bed34cb1302b7a177339 upstream.
    
    A Fedora user reports that the ftdi_sio driver works properly for the
    ICP DAS I-7561U device.  Further, the user manual for these devices
    instructs users to load the driver and add the ids using the sysfs
    interface.
    
    Add support for these in the driver directly so that the devices work
    out of the box instead of needing manual configuration.

    usb: retry reset if a device times out
    
    commit 264904ccc33c604d4b3141bbd33808152dfac45b upstream.
    
    Some devices I got show an inability to operate right after
    power on if they are already connected. They are beyond recovery
    if the descriptors are requested multiple times. So in case of
    a timeout we rather bail early and reset again. But it must be
    done only on the first loop lest we get into a reset/time out
    spiral that can be overcome with a retry.
    
    This patch is a rework of a patch that fell through the cracks.

    aacraid: Fix memory leak in aac_fib_map_free
    
    commit f88fa79a61726ce9434df9b4aede36961f709f17 upstream.
    
    aac_fib_map_free() calls pci_free_consistent() without checking that
    dev->hw_fib_va is not NULL and dev->max_fib_size is not zero.If they are
    indeed NULL/0, this will result in a hang as pci_free_consistent() will
    attempt to invalidate cache for the entire 64-bit address space
    (which would take a very long time).
    
    Fixed by adding a check to make sure that dev->hw_fib_va and
    dev->max_fib_size are not NULL and 0 respectively.

    sg: fix dxferp in from_to case
    
    commit 5ecee0a3ee8d74b6950cb41e8989b0c2174568d4 upstream.
    
    One of the strange things that the original sg driver did was let the
    user provide both a data-out buffer (it followed the sg_header+cdb)
    _and_ specify a reply length greater than zero. What happened was that
    the user data-out buffer was copied into some kernel buffers and then
    the mid level was told a read type operation would take place with the
    data from the device overwriting the same kernel buffers. The user would
    then read those kernel buffers back into the user space.
    
    From what I can tell, the above action was broken by commit fad7f01e61bf
    ("sg: set dxferp to NULL for READ with the older SG interface") in 2008
    and syzkaller found that out recently.
    
    Make sure that a user space pointer is passed through when data follows
    the sg_header structure and command.  Fix the abnormal case when a
    non-zero reply_len is also given.

    PCI: Disable IO/MEM decoding for devices with non-compliant BARs
    
    commit b84106b4e2290c081cdab521fa832596cdfea246 upstream.
    
    The PCI config header (first 64 bytes of each device's config space) is
    defined by the PCI spec so generic software can identify the device and
    manage its usage of I/O, memory, and IRQ resources.
    
    Some non-spec-compliant devices put registers other than BARs where the
    BARs should be.  When the PCI core sizes these "BARs", the reads and writes
    it does may have unwanted side effects, and the "BAR" may appear to
    describe non-sensical address space.
    
    Add a flag bit to mark non-compliant devices so we don't touch their BARs.
    Turn off IO/MEM decoding to prevent the devices from consuming address
    space, since we can't read the BARs to find out what that address space
    would be.

    EDAC, amd64_edac: Shift wrapping issue in f1x_get_norm_dct_addr()
    
    commit 6f3508f61c814ee852c199988a62bd954c50dfc1 upstream.
    
    dct_sel_base_off is declared as a u64 but we're only using the lower 32
    bits because of a shift wrapping bug. This can possibly truncate the
    upper 16 bits of DctSelBaseOffset[47:26], causing us to misdecode the CS
    row.

    KVM: fix spin_lock_init order on x86
    
    commit e9ad4ec8379ad1ba6f68b8ca1c26b50b5ae0a327 upstream.
    
    Moving the initialization earlier is needed in 4.6 because
    kvm_arch_init_vm is now using mmu_lock, causing lockdep to
    complain:
    
    [  284.440294] INFO: trying to register non-static key.
    [  284.445259] the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
    [  284.450736] turning off the locking correctness validator.
    ...

    However, it also helps fixing a preexisting problem, which is why this
    patch is also good for stable kernels: kvm_create_vm was incrementing
    current->mm->mm_count but not decrementing it at the out_err label (in
    case kvm_init_mmu_notifier failed).  The new initialization order makes
    it possible to add the required mmdrop without adding a new error label.

    KVM: i8254: change PIT discard tick policy
    
    commit 7dd0fdff145c5be7146d0ac06732ae3613412ac1 upstream.
    
    Discard policy uses ack_notifiers to prevent injection of PIT interrupts
    before EOI from the last one.
    
    This patch changes the policy to always try to deliver the interrupt,
    which makes a difference when its vector is in ISR.
    Old implementation would drop the interrupt, but proposed one injects to
    IRR, like real hardware would.
    
    The old policy breaks legacy NMI watchdogs, where PIT is used through
    virtual wire (LVT0): PIT never sends an interrupt before receiving EOI,
    thus a guest deadlock with disabled interrupts will stop NMIs.
    
    Note that NMI doesn't do EOI, so PIT also had to send a normal interrupt
    through IOAPIC.  (KVM's PIT is deeply rotten and luckily not used much
    in modern systems.)
    
    Even though there is a chance of regressions, I think we can fix the
    LVT0 NMI bug without introducing a new tick policy.

    target: Drop incorrect ABORT_TASK put for completed commands
    
    commit 7f54ab5ff52fb0b91569bc69c4a6bc5cac1b768d upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a recent ABORT_TASK regression associated
    with commit febe562c, where a left-over target_put_sess_cmd()
    would still be called when __target_check_io_state() detected
    a command has already been completed, and explicit ABORT must
    be avoided.
    
    Note commit febe562c dropped the local kref_get_unless_zero()
    check in core_tmr_abort_task(), but did not drop this extra
    corresponding target_put_sess_cmd() in the failure path.
    
    So go ahead and drop this now bogus target_put_sess_cmd(),
    and avoid this potential use-after-free.
