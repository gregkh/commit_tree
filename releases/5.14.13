    hwmon: (pmbus/ibm-cffps) max_power_out swap changes
    
    [ Upstream commit f067d5585cda2de1e47dde914a8a4f151659e0ad ]
    
    The bytes for max_power_out from the ibm-cffps devices differ in byte
    order for some power supplies.
    
    The Witherspoon power supply returns the bytes in MSB/LSB order.
    
    The Rainier power supply returns the bytes in LSB/MSB order.
    
    The Witherspoon power supply uses version cffps1. The Rainier power
    supply should use version cffps2. If version is cffps1, swap the bytes
    before output to max_power_out.
    
    Tested:
        Witherspoon before: 3148. Witherspoon after: 3148.
        Rainier before: 53255. Rainier after: 2000.

    [ Upstream commit 3f008385d46d3cea4a097d2615cd485f2184ba26 ]
    
    We have never supported fasync properly, it would only fire when there
    is something polling io_uring making it useless. The original support came
    in through the initial io_uring merge for 5.1. Since it's broken and
    nobody has reported it, get rid of the fasync bits.

    perf/core: fix userpage->time_enabled of inactive events
    
    [ Upstream commit f792565326825ed806626da50c6f9a928f1079c1 ]
    
    Users of rdpmc rely on the mmapped user page to calculate accurate
    time_enabled. Currently, userpage->time_enabled is only updated when the
    event is added to the pmu. As a result, inactive event (due to counter
    multiplexing) does not have accurate userpage->time_enabled. This can
    be reproduced with something like:
    
       /* open 20 task perf_event "cycles", to create multiplexing */
    
       fd = perf_event_open();  /* open task perf_event "cycles" */
       userpage = mmap(fd);     /* use mmap and rdmpc */
    
       while (true) {
         time_enabled_mmap = xxx; /* use logic in perf_event_mmap_page */
         time_enabled_read = read(fd).time_enabled;
         if (time_enabled_mmap > time_enabled_read)
             BUG();
       }
    
    Fix this by updating userpage for inactive events in merge_sched_in.

    vboxfs: fix broken legacy mount signature checking
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b3b353ef330e20bc2d99bf3165cc044cff26a09 ]
    
    Commit 9d682ea6bcc7 ("vboxsf: Fix the check for the old binary
    mount-arguments struct") was meant to fix a build error due to sign
    mismatch in 'char' and the use of character constants, but it just moved
    the error elsewhere, in that on some architectures characters and signed
    and on others they are unsigned, and that's just how the C standard
    works.
    
    The proper fix is a simple "don't do that then".  The code was just
    being silly and odd, and it should never have cared about signed vs
    unsigned characters in the first place, since what it is testing is not
    four "characters", but four bytes.
    
    And the way to compare four bytes is by using "memcmp()".
    
    Which compilers will know to just turn into a single 32-bit compare with
    a constant, as long as you don't have crazy debug options enabled.

    net: bgmac-platform: handle mac-address deferral
    
    [ Upstream commit 763716a55cb1f480ffe1a9702e6b5d9ea1a80a24 ]
    
    This patch is a replication of Christian Lamparter's "net: bgmac-bcma:
    handle deferred probe error due to mac-address" patch for the
    bgmac-platform driver [1].
    
    As is the case with the bgmac-bcma driver, this change is to cover the
    scenario where the MAC address cannot yet be discovered due to reliance
    on an nvmem provider which is yet to be instantiated, resulting in a
    random address being assigned that has to be manually overridden.

    m68k: Handle arrivals of multiple signals correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 4bb0bd81ce5e97092dfda6a106d414b703ec0ee8 ]
    
    When we have several pending signals, have entered with the kernel
    with large exception frame *and* have already built at least one
    sigframe, regs->stkadj is going to be non-zero and regs->format/sr/pc
    are going to be junk - the real values are in shifted exception stack
    frame we'd built when putting together the first sigframe.
    
    If that happens, subsequent sigframes are going to be garbage.
    Not hard to fix - just need to find the "adjusted" frame first
    and look for format/vector/sr/pc in it.

    [ Upstream commit 7970a19b71044bf4dc2c1becc200275bdf1884d4 ]
    
    The ipv4 and device notifiers are called with RTNL mutex held.
    The table walk can take some time, better not block other RTNL users.
    
    'ip a' has been reported to block for up to 20 seconds when conntrack table
    has many entries and device down events are frequent (e.g., PPP).

    netfilter: nf_nat_masquerade: make async masq_inet6_event handling generic
    
    [ Upstream commit 30db406923b9285a9bac06a6af5e74bd6d0f1d06 ]
    
    masq_inet6_event is called asynchronously from system work queue,
    because the inet6 notifier is atomic and nf_iterate_cleanup can sleep.
    
    The ipv4 and device notifiers call nf_iterate_cleanup directly.
    
    This is legal, but these notifiers are called with RTNL mutex held.
    A large conntrack table with many devices coming and going will have severe
    impact on the system usability, with 'ip a' blocking for several seconds.
    
    This change places the defer code into a helper and makes it more
    generic so ipv4 and ifdown notifiers can be converted to defer the
    cleanup walk as well in a follow patch.

    ASoC: SOF: loader: release_firmware() on load failure to avoid batching
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a8e1813ffc35111fc0b6db49968ceb0e1615ced ]
    
    Invoke release_firmware() when the firmware fails to boot in
    sof_probe_continue().
    
    The request_firmware() framework must be informed of failures in
    sof_probe_continue() otherwise its internal "batching"
    feature (different from caching) cached the firmware image
    forever. Attempts to correct the file in /lib/firmware/ were then
    silently and confusingly ignored until the next reboot. Unloading the
    drivers did not help because from their disconnected perspective the
    firmware had failed so there was nothing to release.
    
    Also leverage the new snd_sof_fw_unload() function to simplify the
    snd_sof_device_remove() function.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Unify mixer resume and reset_resume procedure
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b9cf9036609428e845dc300aec13822ba2c4ab3 ]
    
    USB-audio driver assumes that the normal resume would preserve the
    device configuration while reset_resume wouldn't, and tries to restore
    the mixer elements only at reset_resume callback.  However, this seems
    too naive, and some devices do behave differently, resetting the
    volume at the normal resume; this resulted in the inconsistent volume
    that surprised users.
    
    This patch changes the mixer resume code to handle both the normal and
    reset resume in the same way, always restoring the original mixer
    element values.  This allows us to unify the both callbacks as well as
    dropping the no longer used reset_resume field, which ends up with a
    good code reduction.
    
    A slight behavior change by this patch is that now we assign
    restore_mixer_value() as the default resume callback, and the function
    is no longer called at reset-resume when the resume callback is
    overridden by the quirk function.  That is, if needed, the quirk
    resume function would have to handle similarly as
    restore_mixer_value() by itself.

    Loud Technologies Mackie Onyx 1640i (former model) is identified as
    the model which uses OXFW971. The analysis of packet dump shows that
    it transfers events in blocking method of IEC 61883-6, however the
    default behaviour of ALSA oxfw driver is for non-blocking method.
    
    This commit adds code to detect it assuming that all of loud models
    based on OXFW971 have such quirk. It brings no functional change
    except for alignment rule of PCM buffer.

    ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: tag SoundWire BEs as non-atomic
    
    [ Upstream commit 58eafe1ff52ee1ce255759fc15729519af180cbb ]
    
    The SoundWire BEs make use of 'stream' functions for .prepare and
    .trigger. These functions will in turn force a Bank Switch, which
    implies a wait operation.
    
    Mark SoundWire BEs as nonatomic for consistency, but keep all other
    types of BEs as is. The initialization of .nonatomic is done outside
    of the create_sdw_dailink helper to avoid adding more parameters to
    deal with a single exception to the rule that BEs are atomic.

    ext4: correct the error path of ext4_write_inline_data_end()
    
    [ Upstream commit 55ce2f649b9e88111270333a8127e23f4f8f42d7 ]
    
    Current error path of ext4_write_inline_data_end() is not correct.
    
    Firstly, it should pass out the error value if ext4_get_inode_loc()
    return fail, or else it could trigger infinite loop if we inject error
    here. And then it's better to add inode to orphan list if it return fail
    in ext4_journal_stop(), otherwise we could not restore inline xattr
    entry after power failure. Finally, we need to reset the 'ret' value if
    ext4_write_inline_data_end() return success in ext4_write_end() and
    ext4_journalled_write_end(), otherwise we could not get the error return
    value of ext4_journal_stop().

    ext4: check and update i_disksize properly
    
    [ Upstream commit 4df031ff5876d94b48dd9ee486ba5522382a06b2 ]
    
    After commit 3da40c7b0898 ("ext4: only call ext4_truncate when size <=
    isize"), i_disksize could always be updated to i_size in ext4_setattr(),
    and we could sure that i_disksize <= i_size since holding inode lock and
    if i_disksize < i_size there are delalloc writes pending in the range
    upto i_size. If the end of the current write is <= i_size, there's no
    need to touch i_disksize since writeback will push i_disksize upto
    i_size eventually. So we can switch to check i_size instead of
    i_disksize in ext4_da_write_end() when write to the end of the file.
    we also could remove ext4_mark_inode_dirty() together because we defer
    inode dirtying to generic_write_end() or ext4_da_write_inline_data_end().
