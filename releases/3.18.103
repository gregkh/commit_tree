    vt: change SGR 21 to follow the standards
    
    commit 65d9982d7e523a1a8e7c9af012da0d166f72fc56 upstream.
    
    ECMA-48 [1] (aka ISO 6429) has defined SGR 21 as "doubly underlined"
    since at least March 1984.  The Linux kernel has treated it as SGR 22
    "normal intensity" since it was added in Linux-0.96b in June 1992.
    Before that, it was simply ignored.  Other terminal emulators have
    either ignored it, or treat it as double underline now.  xterm for
    example added support in its 304 release (May 2014) [2] where it was
    previously ignoring it.
    
    Changing this behavior shouldn't be an issue:
    - It isn't a named capability in ncurses's terminfo database, so no
      script is using libtinfo/libcurses to look this up, or using tput
      to query & output the right sequence.
    - Any script assuming SGR 21 will reset intensity in all terminals
      already do not work correctly on non-Linux VTs (including running
      under screen/tmux/etc...).
    - If someone has written a script that only runs in the Linux VT, and
      they're using SGR 21 (instead of SGR 22), the output should still
      be readable.
    
    imo it's important to change this as the Linux VT's non-conformance
    is sometimes used as an argument for other terminal emulators to not
    implement SGR 21 at all, or do so incorrectly.

    Input: i8042 - enable MUX on Sony VAIO VGN-CS series to fix touchpad
    
    commit 04bb1719c4de94700056241d4c0fe3c1413f5aff upstream.
    
    The touch sensor buttons on Sony VAIO VGN-CS series laptops (e.g.
    VGN-CS31S) are a separate PS/2 device. As the MUX is disabled for all
    VAIO machines by the nomux blacklist, the data from touch sensor
    buttons and touchpad are combined. The protocol used by the buttons is
    probably similar to the touchpad protocol (both are Synaptics) so both
    devices get enabled. The controller combines the data, creating a mess
    which results in random button clicks, touchpad stopping working and
    lost sync error messages:
    psmouse serio1: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 4
    psmouse serio1: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
    psmouse serio1: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
    psmouse serio1: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
    psmouse serio1: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
    psmouse serio1: issuing reconnect request
    
    Add a new i8042_dmi_forcemux_table whitelist with VGN-CS.
    With MUX enabled, touch sensor buttons are detected as separate device
    (and left disabled as there's currently no driver), fixing all touchpad
    problems.

    fs/proc: Stop trying to report thread stacks
    
    commit b18cb64ead400c01bf1580eeba330ace51f8087d upstream.
    
    This reverts more of:
    
      b76437579d13 ("procfs: mark thread stack correctly in proc/<pid>/maps")
    
    ... which was partially reverted by:
    
      65376df58217 ("proc: revert /proc/<pid>/maps [stack:TID] annotation")
    
    Originally, /proc/PID/task/TID/maps was the same as /proc/TID/maps.
    
    In current kernels, /proc/PID/maps (or /proc/TID/maps even for
    threads) shows "[stack]" for VMAs in the mm's stack address range.
    
    In contrast, /proc/PID/task/TID/maps uses KSTK_ESP to guess the
    target thread's stack's VMA.  This is racy, probably returns garbage
    and, on arches with CONFIG_TASK_INFO_IN_THREAD=y, is also crash-prone:
    KSTK_ESP is not safe to use on tasks that aren't known to be running
    ordinary process-context kernel code.
    
    This patch removes the difference and just shows "[stack]" for VMAs
    in the mm's stack range.  This is IMO much more sensible -- the
    actual "stack" address really is treated specially by the VM code,
    and the current thread stack isn't even well-defined for programs
    that frequently switch stacks on their own.

    proc: revert /proc/<pid>/maps [stack:TID] annotation
    
    commit 65376df582174ffcec9e6471bf5b0dd79ba05e4a upstream.
    
    Commit b76437579d13 ("procfs: mark thread stack correctly in
    proc/<pid>/maps") added [stack:TID] annotation to /proc/<pid>/maps.
    
    Finding the task of a stack VMA requires walking the entire thread list,
    turning this into quadratic behavior: a thousand threads means a
    thousand stacks, so the rendering of /proc/<pid>/maps needs to look at a
    million combinations.
    
    The cost is not in proportion to the usefulness as described in the
    patch.
    
    Drop the [stack:TID] annotation to make /proc/<pid>/maps (and
    /proc/<pid>/numa_maps) usable again for higher thread counts.
    
    The [stack] annotation inside /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/maps is retained, as
    identifying the stack VMA there is an O(1) operation.
    
    Siddesh said:
     "The end users needed a way to identify thread stacks programmatically and
      there wasn't a way to do that.  I'm afraid I no longer remember (or have
      access to the resources that would aid my memory since I changed
      employers) the details of their requirement.  However, I did do this on my
      own time because I thought it was an interesting project for me and nobody
      really gave any feedback then as to its utility, so as far as I am
      concerned you could roll back the main thread maps information since the
      information is available in the thread-specific files"

    media: usbtv: prevent double free in error case
    
    commit 50e7044535537b2a54c7ab798cd34c7f6d900bd2 upstream.
    
    Quoting the original report:
    
    It looks like there is a double-free vulnerability in Linux usbtv driver
    on an error path of usbtv_probe function. When audio registration fails,
    usbtv_video_free function ends up freeing usbtv data structure, which
    gets freed the second time under usbtv_video_fail label.
    
    usbtv_audio_fail:
    
            usbtv_video_free(usbtv); =>
    
               v4l2_device_put(&usbtv->v4l2_dev);
    
                  => v4l2_device_put
    
                      => kref_put
    
                          => v4l2_device_release
    
      => usbtv_release (CALLBACK)
    
                                 => kfree(usbtv) (1st time)
    
    usbtv_video_fail:
    
            usb_set_intfdata(intf, NULL);
    
            usb_put_dev(usbtv->udev);
    
            kfree(usbtv); (2nd time)
    
    So, as we have refcounting, use it

    commit bb0829a741792b56c908d7745bc0b2b540293bcc upstream.
    
    Currently the driver spams the kernel log on unsupported ioctls which is
    unnecessary as the ioctl returns -ENOIOCTLCMD to indicate this anyway.
    I suspect this was originally for debugging purposes but it really is not
    required so remove it.

    media: v4l2-ctrls: fix sparse warning
    
    The warning is simple:
    
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ctrls.c:1685:15: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
    
    but the fix isn't.
    
    The core problem was that the conversion from user to kernelspace was
    done at too low a level and that needed to be moved up. That made it possible
    to drop pointers to v4l2_ext_control from set_ctrl and validate_new and
    clean up this sparse warning because those functions now always operate
    on kernelspace pointers.

    media: v4l2-compat-ioctl32.c: refactor compat ioctl32 logic
    
    commit a1dfb4c48cc1e64eeb7800a27c66a6f7e88d075a upstream.
    
    The 32-bit compat v4l2 ioctl handling is implemented based on its 64-bit
    equivalent. It converts 32-bit data structures into its 64-bit
    equivalents and needs to provide the data to the 64-bit ioctl in user
    space memory which is commonly allocated using
    compat_alloc_user_space().
    
    However, due to how that function is implemented, it can only be called
    a single time for every syscall invocation.
    
    Supposedly to avoid this limitation, the existing code uses a mix of
    memory from the kernel stack and memory allocated through
    compat_alloc_user_space().
    
    Under normal circumstances, this would not work, because the 64-bit
    ioctl expects all pointers to point to user space memory. As a
    workaround, set_fs(KERNEL_DS) is called to temporarily disable this
    extra safety check and allow kernel pointers. However, this might
    introduce a security vulnerability: The result of the 32-bit to 64-bit
    conversion is writeable by user space because the output buffer has been
    allocated via compat_alloc_user_space(). A malicious user space process
    could then manipulate pointers inside this output buffer, and due to the
    previous set_fs(KERNEL_DS) call, functions like get_user() or put_user()
    no longer prevent kernel memory access.
    
    The new approach is to pre-calculate the total amount of user space
    memory that is needed, allocate it using compat_alloc_user_space() and
    then divide up the allocated memory to accommodate all data structures
    that need to be converted.
    
    An alternative approach would have been to retain the union type karg
    that they allocated on the kernel stack in do_video_ioctl(), copy all
    data from user space into karg and then back to user space. However, we
    decided against this approach because it does not align with other
    compat syscall implementations. Instead, we tried to replicate the
    get_user/put_user pairs as found in other places in the kernel:
    
        if (get_user(clipcount, &up->clipcount) ||
            put_user(clipcount, &kp->clipcount)) return -EFAULT;
    
    Notes from hans.verkuil@cisco.com:
    
    This patch was taken from:
        https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_samsung_apq8084/commit/97b733953c06e4f0398ade18850f0817778255f7
    
    Clearly nobody could be bothered to upstream this patch or at minimum
    tell us :-( We only heard about this a week ago.
    
    This patch was rebased and cleaned up. Compared to the original I
    also swapped the order of the convert_in_user arguments so that they
    matched copy_in_user. It was hard to review otherwise. I also replaced
    the ALLOC_USER_SPACE/ALLOC_AND_GET by a normal function.

    commit 273caa260035c03d89ad63d72d8cd3d9e5c5e3f1 upstream.
    
    If the device is of type VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV then vdev->ioctl_ops
    is NULL so the 'if (!ops->vidioc_query_ext_ctrl)' check would crash.
    Add a test for !ops to the condition.
    
    All sub-devices that have controls will use the control framework,
    so they do not have an equivalent to ops->vidioc_query_ext_ctrl.
    Returning false if ops is NULL is the correct thing to do here.

    ctrl_is_pointer just hardcoded two known string controls, but that

    Reimplement this function: it now finds the v4l2_ctrl (if the driver

    driver implements that directly).
    
    In both cases it can now check if the control is a pointer control
    or not.

    vb2: V4L2_BUF_FLAG_DONE is set after DQBUF
    
    commit 3171cc2b4eb9831ab4df1d80d0410a945b8bc84e upstream.
    
    According to the doc, V4L2_BUF_FLAG_DONE is cleared after DQBUF:
    
    V4L2_BUF_FLAG_DONE 0x00000004  ... After calling the VIDIOC_QBUF or
    VIDIOC_DQBUF it is always cleared ...
    
    Unfortunately, it seems that videobuf2 keeps it set after DQBUF. This
    can be tested with vivid and dev_debug:
    
    [257604.338082] video1: VIDIOC_DQBUF: 71:33:25.00260479 index=3,
    type=vid-cap, flags=0x00002004, field=none, sequence=163,
    memory=userptr, bytesused=460800, offset/userptr=0x344b000,
    length=460800
    
    This patch forces FLAG_DONE to 0 after calling DQBUF.

    Multi-queue virtio-scsi uses a different scsi_host_template struct.  Add

    netfilter: bridge: ebt_among: add more missing match size checks
    
    commit c8d70a700a5b486bfa8e5a7d33d805389f6e59f9 upstream.
    
    ebt_among is special, it has a dynamic match size and is exempt
    from the central size checks.
    
    commit c4585a2823edf ("bridge: ebt_among: add missing match size checks")
    added validation for pool size, but missed fact that the macros
    ebt_among_wh_src/dst can already return out-of-bound result because
    they do not check value of wh_src/dst_ofs (an offset) vs. the size
    of the match that userspace gave to us.
    
    v2:
    check that offset has correct alignment.
    Paolo Abeni points out that we should also check that src/dst
    wormhash arrays do not overlap, and src + length lines up with
    start of dst (or vice versa).
    v3: compact wormhash_sizes_valid() part
    
    NB: Fixes tag is intentionally wrong, this bug exists from day
    one when match was added for 2.6 kernel. Tag is there so stable
    maintainers will notice this one too.
    
    Tested with same rules from the earlier patch.

    commit 19d7df69fdb2636856dc8919de72fc1bf8f79598 upstream.
    
    We don't have a compat layer for xfrm, so userspace and kernel
    structures have different sizes in this case. This results in
    a broken configuration, so refuse to configure socket policies
    when trying to insert from 32 bit userspace as we do it already
    with policies inserted via netlink.

    net: xfrm: use preempt-safe this_cpu_read() in ipcomp_alloc_tfms()
    
    commit 0dcd7876029b58770f769cbb7b484e88e4a305e5 upstream.
    
    f7c83bcbfaf5 ("net: xfrm: use __this_cpu_read per-cpu helper") added a
    __this_cpu_read() call inside ipcomp_alloc_tfms().
    
    At the time, __this_cpu_read() required the caller to either not care
    about races or to handle preemption/interrupt issues.  3.15 tightened
    the rules around some per-cpu operations, and now __this_cpu_read()
    should never be used in a preemptible context.  On 3.15 and later, we
    need to use this_cpu_read() instead.
    
    syzkaller reported this leading to the following kernel BUG while
    fuzzing sendmsg:

    xfrm_user: uncoditionally validate esn replay attribute struct
    
    commit d97ca5d714a5334aecadadf696875da40f1fbf3e upstream.
    
    The sanity test added in ecd7918745234 can be bypassed, validation
    only occurs if XFRM_STATE_ESN flag is set, but rest of code doesn't care
    and just checks if the attribute itself is present.
    
    So always validate.  Alternative is to reject if we have the attribute
    without the flag but that would change abi.

    Fix kprobes to set(recover) RWX bits correctly on trampoline
    buffer before releasing it. Releasing readonly page to

    Without this fix, if kprobes user register a bunch of kprobes
    in function body (since kprobes on function entry usually
    use ftrace) and unregister it, kernel hits a BUG and crash.

    always aligned with wMaxPacketSize (512 usually). This makes sure

    commit 16b114a6d7973cf027e4c2b23eae1076eaf98c25 upstream.
    
    USB spec specifies wMaxPacketSize to be little endian (as other properties),
    so when using this variable in the driver we should convert to the current
    CPU endianness if necessary.
    
    This patch also introduces usb_ep_align() which does always returns the

    usb: gadget: define free_ep_req as universal function
    
    commit 079fe5a6da616891cca1a26e803e1df2a87e9ae5 upstream.
    
    This function is shared between gadget functions, so this avoid unnecessary
    duplicated code and potentially avoid memory leaks.

    partitions/msdos: Unable to mount UFS 44bsd partitions
    
    commit 5f15684bd5e5ef39d4337988864fec8012471dda upstream.
    
    UFS partitions from newer versions of FreeBSD 10 and 11 use relative
    addressing for their subpartitions. But older versions of FreeBSD still
    use absolute addressing just like OpenBSD and NetBSD.
    
    Instead of simply testing for a FreeBSD partition, the code needs to
    also test if the starting offset of the C subpartition is zero.

    ALSA: pcm: Use dma_bytes as size parameter in dma_mmap_coherent()
    
    commit 9066ae7ff5d89c0b5daa271e2d573540097a94fa upstream.
    
    When trying to use the driver (e.g. aplay *.wav), the 4MiB DMA buffer
    will get mmapp'ed in 16KiB chunks. But this fails with the 2nd 16KiB
    area, as the page offset is outside of the VMA range (size), which is
    currently used as size parameter in snd_pcm_lib_default_mmap(). By
    using the DMA buffer size (dma_bytes) instead, the complete DMA buffer
    can be mmapp'ed and the issue is fixed.
    
    This issue was detected on an ARM platform (TI AM57xx) using the RME
    HDSP MADI PCIe soundcard.

    s390/qeth: on channel error, reject further cmd requests
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a6c3d93963e4b333c764fde69802c3ea9eaa9d5c ]
    
    When the IRQ handler determines that one of the cmd IO channels has
    failed and schedules recovery, block any further cmd requests from
    being submitted. The request would inevitably stall, and prevent the
    recovery from making progress until the request times out.
    
    This sort of error was observed after Live Guest Relocation, where
    the pending IO on the READ channel intentionally gets terminated to
    kick-start recovery. Simultaneously the guest executed SIOCETHTOOL,
    triggering qeth to issue a QUERY CARD INFO command. The command
    then stalled in the inoperabel WRITE channel.

    This is satisfied for the IRQ handler path (where qeth_irq() gets called

    s390/qeth: free netdevice when removing a card
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6be687395b3124f002a653c1a50b3260222b3cd7 ]
    
    On removal, a qeth card's netdevice is currently not properly freed
    because the call chain looks as follows:
    
    qeth_core_remove_device(card)
            lx_remove_device(card)
                    unregister_netdev(card->dev)
                    card->dev = NULL                        !!!
            qeth_core_free_card(card)
                    if (card->dev)                          !!!
                            free_netdev(card->dev)
    
    Fix it by free'ing the netdev straight after unregistering. This also
    fixes the sysfs-driven layer switch case (qeth_dev_layer2_store()),
    where the need to free the current netdevice was not considered at all.
    
    Note that free_netdev() takes care of the netif_napi_del() for us too.

    ipv6: fix access to non-linear packet in ndisc_fill_redirect_hdr_option()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f62c15f28b0d1d746734666d88a79f08ba1e43e ]
    
    Fix the following slab-out-of-bounds kasan report in
    ndisc_fill_redirect_hdr_option when the incoming ipv6 packet is not
    linear and the accessed data are not in the linear data region of orig_skb.

    The test scenario to trigger the issue consists of 4 devices:
    - H0: data sender, connected to LAN0
    - H1: data receiver, connected to LAN1
    - GW0 and GW1: routers between LAN0 and LAN1. Both of them have an
      ethernet connection on LAN0 and LAN1
    On H{0,1} set GW0 as default gateway while on GW0 set GW1 as next hop for
    data from LAN0 to LAN1.
    Moreover create an ip6ip6 tunnel between H0 and H1 and send 3 concurrent
    data streams (TCP/UDP/SCTP) from H0 to H1 through ip6ip6 tunnel (send
    buffer size is set to 16K). While data streams are active flush the route
    cache on HA multiple times.
    I have not been able to identify a given commit that introduced the issue
    since, using the reproducer described above, the kasan report has been
    triggered from 4.14 and I have not gone back further.

    dccp: check sk for closed state in dccp_sendmsg()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 67f93df79aeefc3add4e4b31a752600f834236e2 ]
    
    dccp_disconnect() sets 'dp->dccps_hc_tx_ccid' tx handler to NULL,
    therefore if DCCP socket is disconnected and dccp_sendmsg() is
    called after it, it will cause a NULL pointer dereference in
    dccp_write_xmit().
    
    This crash and the reproducer was reported by syzbot. Looks like
    it is reproduced if commit 69c64866ce07 ("dccp: CVE-2017-8824:
    use-after-free in DCCP code") is applied.

    kvm/x86: fix icebp instruction handling
    
    commit 32d43cd391bacb5f0814c2624399a5dad3501d09 upstream.
    
    The undocumented 'icebp' instruction (aka 'int1') works pretty much like
    'int3' in the absense of in-circuit probing equipment (except,
    obviously, that it raises #DB instead of raising #BP), and is used by
    some validation test-suites as such.
    
    But Andy Lutomirski noticed that his test suite acted differently in kvm
    than on bare hardware.
    
    The reason is that kvm used an inexact test for the icebp instruction:
    it just assumed that an all-zero VM exit qualification value meant that
    the VM exit was due to icebp.
    
    That is not unlike the guess that do_debug() does for the actual
    exception handling case, but it's purely a heuristic, not an absolute
    rule.  do_debug() does it because it wants to ascribe _some_ reasons to
    the #DB that happened, and an empty %dr6 value means that 'icebp' is the
    most likely casue and we have no better information.
    
    But kvm can just do it right, because unlike the do_debug() case, kvm
    actually sees the real reason for the #DB in the VM-exit interruption
    information field.
    
    So instead of relying on an inexact heuristic, just use the actual VM
    exit information that says "it was 'icebp'".
    
    Right now the 'icebp' instruction isn't technically documented by Intel,
    but that will hopefully change.  The special "privileged software
    exception" information _is_ actually mentioned in the Intel SDM, even
    though the cause of it isn't enumerated.

    can: cc770: Fix queue stall & dropped RTR reply
    
    commit 746201235b3f876792099079f4c6fea941d76183 upstream.
    
    While waiting for the TX object to send an RTR, an external message with a
    matching id can overwrite the TX data. In this case we must call the rx
    routine and then try transmitting the message that was overwritten again.
    
    The queue was being stalled because the RX event did not generate an
    interrupt to wake up the queue again and the TX event did not happen
    because the TXRQST flag is reset by the chip when new data is received.
    
    According to the CC770 datasheet the id of a message object should not be
    changed while the MSGVAL bit is set. This has been fixed by resetting the
    MSGVAL bit before modifying the object in the transmit function and setting
    it after. It is not enough to set & reset CPUUPD.
    
    It is important to keep the MSGVAL bit reset while the message object is
    being modified. Otherwise, during RTR transmission, a frame with matching
    id could trigger an rx-interrupt, which would cause a race condition
    between the interrupt routine and the transmit function.

    tracing: probeevent: Fix to support minus offset from symbol
    
    commit c5d343b6b7badd1f5fe0873eff2e8d63a193e732 upstream.
    
    In Documentation/trace/kprobetrace.txt, it says
    
     @SYM[+|-offs] : Fetch memory at SYM +|- offs (SYM should be a data symbol)
    
    However, the parser doesn't parse minus offset correctly, since
    commit 2fba0c8867af ("tracing/kprobes: Fix probe offset to be
    unsigned") drops minus ("-") offset support for kprobe probe
    address usage.
    
    This fixes the traceprobe_split_symbol_offset() to parse minus
    offset again with checking the offset range, and add a minus
    offset check in kprobe probe address usage.

    brcmfmac: fix P2P_DEVICE ethernet address generation
    
    commit 455f3e76cfc0d893585a5f358b9ddbe9c1e1e53b upstream.
    
    The firmware has a requirement that the P2P_DEVICE address should
    be different from the address of the primary interface. When not
    specified by user-space, the driver generates the MAC address for
    the P2P_DEVICE interface using the MAC address of the primary
    interface and setting the locally administered bit. However, the MAC
    address of the primary interface may already have that bit set causing
    the creation of the P2P_DEVICE interface to fail with -EBUSY. Fix this
    by using a random address instead to determine the P2P_DEVICE address.

    libata: Modify quirks for MX100 to limit NCQ_TRIM quirk to MU01 version
    
    commit d418ff56b8f2d2b296daafa8da151fe27689b757 upstream.
    
    When commit 9c7be59fc519af ("libata: Apply NOLPM quirk to Crucial MX100
    512GB SSDs") was added it inherited the ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk
    from the existing "Crucial_CT*MX100*" entry, but that entry sets model_rev
    to "MU01", where as the entry adding the NOLPM quirk sets it to NULL.
    
    This means that after this commit we no apply the NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk to
    all "Crucial_CT512MX100*" SSDs even if they have the fixed "MU02"
    firmware. This commit splits the "Crucial_CT512MX100*" quirk into 2
    quirks, one for the "MU01" firmware and one for all other firmware
    versions, so that we once again only apply the NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk to the
    "MU01" firmware version.

    libata: Make Crucial BX100 500GB LPM quirk apply to all firmware versions
    
    commit 3bf7b5d6d017c27e0d3b160aafb35a8e7cfeda1f upstream.
    
    Commit b17e5729a630 ("libata: disable LPM for Crucial BX100 SSD 500GB
    drive"), introduced a ATA_HORKAGE_NOLPM quirk for Crucial BX100 500GB SSDs
    but limited this to the MU02 firmware version, according to:
    http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/support-ssd-firmware
    
    MU02 is the last version, so there are no newer possibly fixed versions
    and if the MU02 version has broken LPM then the MU01 almost certainly
    also has broken LPM, so this commit changes the quirk to apply to all
    firmware versions.

    libata: Apply NOLPM quirk to Crucial M500 480 and 960GB SSDs
    
    commit 62ac3f7305470e3f52f159de448bc1a771717e88 upstream.
    
    There have been reports of the Crucial M500 480GB model not working
    with LPM set to min_power / med_power_with_dipm level.
    
    It has not been tested with medium_power, but that typically has no
    measurable power-savings.
    
    Note the reporters Crucial_CT480M500SSD3 has a firmware version of MU03
    and there is a MU05 update available, but that update does not mention any
    LPM fixes in its changelog, so the quirk matches all firmware versions.
    
    In my experience the LPM problems with (older) Crucial SSDs seem to be
    limited to higher capacity versions of the SSDs (different firmware?),
    so this commit adds a NOLPM quirk for the 480 and 960GB versions of the
    M500, to avoid LPM causing issues with these SSDs.

    commit 9c7be59fc519af9081c46c48f06f2b8fadf55ad8 upstream.
    
    Various people have reported the Crucial MX100 512GB model not working
    with LPM set to min_power. I've now received a report that it also does
    not work with the new med_power_with_dipm level.
    
    It does work with medium_power, but that has no measurable power-savings
    and given the amount of people being bitten by the other levels not
    working, this commit just disables LPM altogether.
    
    Note all reporters of this have either the 512GB model (max capacity), or
    are not specifying their SSD's size. So for now this quirk assumes this is
    a problem with the 512GB model only.

    libata: remove WARN() for DMA or PIO command without data
    
    commit 9173e5e80729c8434b8d27531527c5245f4a5594 upstream.
    
    syzkaller hit a WARN() in ata_qc_issue() when writing to /dev/sg0.  This
    happened because it issued a READ_6 command with no data buffer.
    
    Just remove the WARN(), as it doesn't appear indicate a kernel bug.  The
    expected behavior is to fail the command, which the code does.
    
    Here's a reproducer that works in QEMU when /dev/sg0 refers to a disk of
    the default type ("82371SB PIIX3 IDE"):

    libata: fix length validation of ATAPI-relayed SCSI commands
    
    commit 058f58e235cbe03e923b30ea7c49995a46a8725f upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported a crash in ata_bmdma_fill_sg() when writing to
    /dev/sg1.  The immediate cause was that the ATA command's scatterlist
    was not DMA-mapped, which causes 'pi - 1' to underflow, resulting in a
    write to 'qc->ap->bmdma_prd[0xffffffff]'.
    
    Strangely though, the flag ATA_QCFLAG_DMAMAP was set in qc->flags.  The
    root cause is that when __ata_scsi_queuecmd() is preparing to relay a
    SCSI command to an ATAPI device, it doesn't correctly validate the CDB
    length before copying it into the 16-byte buffer 'cdb' in 'struct
    ata_queued_cmd'.  Namely, it validates the fixed CDB length expected
    based on the SCSI opcode but not the actual CDB length, which can be
    larger due to the use of the SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN ioctl.  Since 'flags' is
    the next member in ata_queued_cmd, a buffer overflow corrupts it.
    
    Fix it by requiring that the actual CDB length be <= 16 (ATAPI_CDB_LEN).
    
    [Really it seems the length should be required to be <= dev->cdb_len,
    but the current behavior seems to have been intentionally introduced by
    commit 607126c2a21c ("libata-scsi: be tolerant of 12-byte ATAPI commands
    in 16-byte CDBs") to work around a userspace bug in mplayer.  Probably
    the workaround is no longer needed (mplayer was fixed in 2007), but
    continuing to allow lengths to up 16 appears harmless for now.]
    
    Here's a reproducer that works in QEMU when /dev/sg1 refers to the
    CD-ROM drive that qemu-system-x86_64 creates by default:
    
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <sys/ioctl.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        #define SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN 0x2283
    
        int main()
        {
                char buf[53] = { [36] = 0x7e, [52] = 0x02 };
                int fd = open("/dev/sg1", O_RDWR);
                ioctl(fd, SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN, &(int){ 17 });
                write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
        }
    
    The crash was:

    ALSA: aloop: Fix access to not-yet-ready substream via cable
    
    commit 8e6b1a72a75bb5067ccb6b56d8ca4aa3a300a64e upstream.
    
    In loopback_open() and loopback_close(), we assign and release the
    substream object to the corresponding cable in a racy way.  It's
    neither locked nor done in the right position.  The open callback
    assigns the substream before its preparation finishes, hence the other
    side of the cable may pick it up, which may lead to the invalid memory
    access.
    
    This patch addresses these: move the assignment to the end of the open
    callback, and wrap with cable->lock for avoiding concurrent accesses.

    ALSA: aloop: Sync stale timer before release
    
    commit 67a01afaf3d34893cf7d2ea19b34555d6abb7cb0 upstream.
    
    The aloop driver tries to stop the pending timer via timer_del() in
    the trigger callback and in the close callback.  The former is
    correct, as it's an atomic operation, while the latter expects that
    the timer gets really removed and proceeds the resource releases after
    that.  But timer_del() doesn't synchronize, hence the running timer
    may still access the released resources.
    
    A similar situation can be also seen in the prepare callback after
    trigger(STOP) where the prepare tries to re-initialize the things
    while a timer is still running.
    
    The problems like the above are seen indirectly in some syzkaller
    reports (although it's not 100% clear whether this is the only cause,
    as the race condition is quite narrow and not always easy to
    trigger).
    
    For addressing these issues, this patch adds the explicit alls of
    timer_del_sync() in some places, so that the pending timer is properly
    killed / synced.
