    scsi: target: iscsi: calling iscsit_stop_session() inside iscsit_close_session() has no effect
    
    [ Upstream commit 626bac73371eed79e2afa2966de393da96cf925e ]
    
    iscsit_close_session() can only be called when nconn is zero (otherwise a
    kernel panic is triggered). If nconn is zero then iscsit_stop_session()
    does nothing and exits, so calling it makes no sense.
    
    We still need to call iscsit_check_session_usage_count() because this
    function will sleep if the session's refcount is not zero and we don't want
    to destroy the session structure if it's still being referenced.

    x86/resctrl: Fix invalid attempt at removing the default resource group
    
    commit b0151da52a6d4f3951ea24c083e7a95977621436 upstream.
    
    The default resource group ("rdtgroup_default") is associated with the
    root of the resctrl filesystem and should never be removed. New resource
    groups can be created as subdirectories of the resctrl filesystem and
    they can be removed from user space.
    
    There exists a safeguard in the directory removal code
    (rdtgroup_rmdir()) that ensures that only subdirectories can be removed
    by testing that the directory to be removed has to be a child of the
    root directory.
    
    A possible deadlock was recently fixed with
    
      334b0f4e9b1b ("x86/resctrl: Fix a deadlock due to inaccurate reference").
    
    This fix involved associating the private data of the "mon_groups"
    and "mon_data" directories to the resource group to which they belong
    instead of NULL as before. A consequence of this change was that
    the original safeguard code preventing removal of "mon_groups" and
    "mon_data" found in the root directory failed resulting in attempts to
    remove the default resource group that ends in a BUG:
    
      kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:3969!
      invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
    
      Call Trace:
      rdtgroup_rmdir+0x16b/0x2c0

      do_syscall_64+0x55/0x1d0
      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
    
    Fix this by improving the directory removal safeguard to ensure that
    subdirectories of the resctrl root directory can only be removed if they
    are a child of the resctrl filesystem's root _and_ not associated with
    the default resource group.

    x86/resctrl: Preserve CDP enable over CPU hotplug
    
    commit 9fe0450785abbc04b0ed5d3cf61fcdb8ab656b4b upstream.
    
    Resctrl assumes that all CPUs are online when the filesystem is mounted,
    and that CPUs remember their CDP-enabled state over CPU hotplug.
    
    This goes wrong when resctrl's CDP-enabled state changes while all the
    CPUs in a domain are offline.
    
    When a domain comes online, enable (or disable!) CDP to match resctrl's
    current setting.

    proc, time/namespace: Show clock symbolic names in /proc/pid/timens_offsets
    
    commit 94d440d618467806009c8edc70b094d64e12ee5a upstream.
    
    Michael Kerrisk suggested to replace numeric clock IDs with symbolic names.
    
    Now the content of these files looks like this:
    $ cat /proc/774/timens_offsets
    monotonic      864000         0
    boottime      1728000         0
    
    For setting offsets, both representations of clocks (numeric and symbolic)
    can be used.
    
    As for compatibility, it is acceptable to change things as long as
    userspace doesn't care. The format of timens_offsets files is very new and
    there are no userspace tools yet which rely on this format.
    
    But three projects crun, util-linux and criu rely on the interface of
    setting time offsets and this is why it's required to continue supporting
    the numeric clock IDs on write.

    irqchip/ti-sci-inta: Fix processing of masked irqs
    
    commit 3688b0db5c331f4ec3fa5eb9f670a4b04f530700 upstream.
    
    The ti_sci_inta_irq_handler() does not take into account INTA IRQs state
    (masked/unmasked) as it uses INTA_STATUS_CLEAR_j register to get INTA IRQs
    status, which provides raw status value.
    This causes hard IRQ handlers to be called or threaded handlers to be
    scheduled many times even if corresponding INTA IRQ is masked.
    Above, first of all, affects the LEVEL interrupts processing and causes
    unexpected behavior up the system stack or crash.
    
    Fix it by using the Interrupt Masked Status INTA_STATUSM_j register which
    provides masked INTA IRQs status.

    ext4: do not zeroout extents beyond i_disksize
    
    commit 801674f34ecfed033b062a0f217506b93c8d5e8a upstream.
    
    We do not want to create initialized extents beyond end of file because
    for e2fsck it is impossible to distinguish them from a case of corrupted
    file size / extent tree and so it complains like:
    
    Inode 12, i_size is 147456, should be 163840.  Fix? no
    
    Code in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() and
    ext4_split_convert_extents() try to make sure it does not create
    initialized extents beyond inode size however they check against
    inode->i_size which is wrong. They should instead check against
    EXT4_I(inode)->i_disksize which is the current inode size on disk.
    That's what e2fsck is going to see in case of crash before all dirty
    data is written. This bug manifests as generic/456 test failure (with
    recent enough fstests where fsx got fixed to properly pass
    FALLOC_KEEP_SIZE_FL flags to the kernel) when run with dioread_lock
    mount option.

    rcu: Don't acquire lock in NMI handler in rcu_nmi_enter_common()
    
    commit bf37da98c51825c90432d340e135cced37a7460d upstream.
    
    The rcu_nmi_enter_common() function can be invoked both in interrupt
    and NMI handlers.  If it is invoked from process context (as opposed
    to userspace or idle context) on a nohz_full CPU, it might acquire the
    CPU's leaf rcu_node structure's ->lock.  Because this lock is held only
    with interrupts disabled, this is safe from an interrupt handler, but
    doing so from an NMI handler can result in self-deadlock.
    
    This commit therefore adds "irq" to the "if" condition so as to only
    acquire the ->lock from irq handlers or process context, never from
    an NMI handler.

    drm/i915/perf: Do not clear pollin for small user read buffers
    
    commit bcad588dea538a4fc173d16a90a005536ec8dbf2 upstream.
    
    It is wrong to block the user thread in the next poll when OA data is
    already available which could not fit in the user buffer provided in
    the previous read. In several cases the exact user buffer size is not
    known. Blocking user space in poll can lead to data loss when the
    buffer size used is smaller than the available data.
    
    This change fixes this issue and allows user space to read all OA data
    even when using a buffer size smaller than the available data using
    multiple non-blocking reads rather than staying blocked in poll till
    the next timer interrupt.

    i2c: designware: platdrv: Remove DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND flag on BYT and CHT
    
    commit d79294d0de12ddd1420110813626d691f440b86f upstream.
    
    We already set DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE, so we completely skip all
    callbacks (other then prepare) where possible, quoting from
    dw_i2c_plat_prepare():
    
            /*
             * If the ACPI companion device object is present for this device, it
             * may be accessed during suspend and resume of other devices via I2C
             * operation regions, so tell the PM core and middle layers to avoid
             * skipping system suspend/resume callbacks for it in that case.
             */
            return !has_acpi_companion(dev);
    
    Also setting the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND will cause acpi_subsys_suspend()
    to leave the controller runtime-suspended even if dw_i2c_plat_prepare()
    returned 0.
    
    Leaving the controller runtime-suspended normally, when the I2C controller
    is suspended during the suspend_late phase, is not an issue because
    the pm_runtime_get_sync() done by i2c_dw_xfer() will (runtime-)resume it.
    
    But for dw I2C controllers on Bay- and Cherry-Trail devices acpi_lpss.c
    leaves the controller alive until the suspend_noirq phase, because it may
    be used by the _PS3 ACPI methods of PCI devices and PCI devices are left
    powered on until the suspend_noirq phase.
    
    Between the suspend_late and resume_early phases runtime-pm is disabled.
    So for any ACPI I2C OPRegion accesses done after the suspend_late phase,
    the pm_runtime_get_sync() done by i2c_dw_xfer() is a no-op and the
    controller is left runtime-suspended.
    
    i2c_dw_xfer() has a check to catch this condition (rather then waiting
    for the I2C transfer to timeout because the controller is suspended).
    acpi_subsys_suspend() leaving the controller runtime-suspended in
    combination with an ACPI I2C OPRegion access done after the suspend_late
    phase triggers this check, leading to the following error being logged
    on a Bay Trail based Lenovo Thinkpad 8 tablet:
    
    [   93.275882] i2c_designware 80860F41:00: Transfer while suspended

    ...
    
    So since on BYT and CHT platforms we want ACPI I2c OPRegion accesses
    to work until the suspend_noirq phase, we need the controller to be
    runtime-resumed during the suspend phase if it is runtime-suspended
    suspended at that time. This means that we must not set the
    DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND on these platforms.
    
    On BYT and CHT we already have a special ACCESS_NO_IRQ_SUSPEND flag
    to make sure the controller stays functional until the suspend_noirq
    phase. This commit makes the driver not set the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND
    flag when that flag is set.

    net/mlx5e: Use preactivate hook to set the indirection table
    
    [ Upstream commit fe867cac9e1967c553e4ac2aece5fc8675258010 ]
    
    mlx5e_ethtool_set_channels updates the indirection table before
    switching to the new channels. If the switch fails, the indirection
    table is new, but the channels are old, which is wrong. Fix it by using
    the preactivate hook of mlx5e_safe_switch_channels to update the
    indirection table at the stage when nothing can fail anymore.
    
    As the code that updates the indirection table is now encapsulated into
    a new function, use that function in the attach flow when the driver has
    to reduce the number of channels, and prepare the code for the next
    commit.

    net/mlx5e: Rename hw_modify to preactivate
    
    [ Upstream commit dca147b3dce5abb5284ff747211960fd2db5ec2e ]
    
    mlx5e_safe_switch_channels accepts a callback to be called before
    activating new channels. It is intended to configure some hardware
    parameters in cases where channels are recreated because some
    configuration has changed.
    
    Recently, this callback has started being used to update the driver's
    internal MLX5E_STATE_XDP_OPEN flag, and the following patches also
    intend to use this callback for software preparations. This patch
    renames the hw_modify callback to preactivate, so that the name fits
    better.

    mac80211_hwsim: Use kstrndup() in place of kasprintf()
    
    commit 7ea862048317aa76d0f22334202779a25530980c upstream.
    
    syzbot reports a warning:

    Thus it seems that kasprintf() with "%.*s" format can not be used for
    duplicating a string with arbitrary length. Replace it with kstrndup().
    
    Note that later this string is limited to NL80211_WIPHY_NAME_MAXLEN == 64,
    but the code is simpler this way.

    mac80211: fix race in ieee80211_register_hw()
    
    commit 52e04b4ce5d03775b6a78f3ed1097480faacc9fd upstream.
    
    A race condition leading to a kernel crash is observed during invocation
    of ieee80211_register_hw() on a dragonboard410c device having wcn36xx
    driver built as a loadable module along with a wifi manager in user-space
    waiting for a wifi device (wlanX) to be active.
    
    Sequence diagram for a particular kernel crash scenario:
    
        user-space  ieee80211_register_hw()  ieee80211_tasklet_handler()
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

           |              Kernel crash            |

           |              workqueue.              |
           |                    |                 |
           |       alloc_ordered_workqueue()      |
           |                    |                 |
           |              Misc wiphy init.        |
           |                    |                 |

           |                    |                 |
    
    As evident from above sequence diagram, this race condition isn't specific
    to a particular wifi driver but rather the initialization sequence in
    ieee80211_register_hw() needs to be fixed. So re-order the initialization
    sequence and the updated sequence diagram would look like:
    
        user-space  ieee80211_register_hw()  ieee80211_tasklet_handler()

    btrfs: check commit root generation in should_ignore_root
    
    commit 4d4225fc228e46948486d8b8207955f0c031b92e upstream.
    
    Previously we would set the reloc root's last snapshot to transid - 1.
    However there was a problem with doing this, and we changed it to
    setting the last snapshot to the generation of the commit node of the fs
    root.
    
    This however broke should_ignore_root().  The assumption is that if we
    are in a generation newer than when the reloc root was created, then we
    would find the reloc root through normal backref lookups, and thus can
    ignore any fs roots we find with an old enough reloc root.
    
    Now that the last snapshot could be considerably further in the past
    than before, we'd end up incorrectly ignoring an fs root.  Thus we'd
    find no nodes for the bytenr we were searching for, and we'd fail to
    relocate anything.  We'd loop through the relocate code again and see
    that there were still used space in that block group, attempt to
    relocate those bytenr's again, fail in the same way, and just loop like
    this forever.  This is tricky in that we have to not modify the fs root
    at all during this time, so we need to have a block group that has data
    in this fs root that is not shared by any other root, which is why this
    has been difficult to reproduce.

    tracing: Fix the race between registering 'snapshot' event trigger and triggering 'snapshot' operation
    
    commit 0bbe7f719985efd9adb3454679ecef0984cb6800 upstream.
    
    Traced event can trigger 'snapshot' operation(i.e. calls snapshot_trigger()
    or snapshot_count_trigger()) when register_snapshot_trigger() has completed
    registration but doesn't allocate buffer for 'snapshot' event trigger.  In
    the rare case, 'snapshot' operation always detects the lack of allocated
    buffer so make register_snapshot_trigger() allocate buffer first.
    
    trigger-snapshot.tc in kselftest reproduces the issue on slow vm:

    keys: Fix proc_keys_next to increase position index
    
    commit 86d32f9a7c54ad74f4514d7fef7c847883207291 upstream.
    
    If seq_file .next function does not change position index,
    read after some lseek can generate unexpected output:

        521 bytes copied, 0,00123769 s, 421 kB/s
    
    But a read after lseek in middle of last line results in the partial
    last line and then a repeat of the final line:
    
        $ dd if=/proc/keys bs=500 skip=1
        dd: /proc/keys: cannot skip to specified offset

    arm64: vdso: don't free unallocated pages
    
    commit 9cc3d0c6915aee5140f8335d41bbc3ff1b79aa4e upstream.
    
    The aarch32_vdso_pages[] array never has entries allocated in the C_VVAR
    or C_VDSO slots, and as the array is zero initialized these contain
    NULL.
    
    However in __aarch32_alloc_vdso_pages() when
    aarch32_alloc_kuser_vdso_page() fails we attempt to free the page whose
    struct page is at NULL, which is obviously nonsensical.
    
    This patch removes the erroneous page freeing.

    specific quirk can provide the node to skip for the badly behaving
    connector controls.  As an example, ALC1220-VB-based codec implements
    the skip entry for the broken SPDIF connector detection.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Don't create jack controls for PCM terminals
    
    commit 7dc3c5a0172e6c0449502103356c3628d05bc0e0 upstream.
    
    Some funky firmwares set the connector flag even on PCM terminals
    although it doesn't make sense (and even actually the firmware doesn't
    react properly!).  Let's skip creation of jack controls in such a
    case.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Don't override ignore_ctl_error value from the map
    
    commit 3507245b82b4362dc9721cbc328644905a3efa22 upstream.
    
    The mapping table may contain also ignore_ctl_error flag for devices
    that are known to behave wild.  Since this flag always writes the
    card's own ignore_ctl_error flag, it overrides the value already set
    by the module option, so it doesn't follow user's expectation.
    Let's fix the code not to clear the flag that has been set by user.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Filter error from connector kctl ops, too
    
    commit 48cc42973509afac24e83d6edc23901d102872d1 upstream.
    
    The ignore_ctl_error option should filter the error at kctl accesses,
    but there was an overlook: mixer_ctl_connector_get() returns an error
    from the request.
    
    This patch covers the forgotten code path and apply filter_error()
    properly.  The locking error is still returned since this is a fatal
    error that has to be reported even with ignore_ctl_error option.

    ALSA: hda: Allow setting preallocation again for x86
    
    commit f8e4ae10de43fbb7ce85f79e04eca2988b6b2c40 upstream.
    
    The commit c31427d0d21e ("ALSA: hda: No preallocation on x86
    platforms") changed CONFIG_SND_HDA_PREALLOC_SIZE setup and its default
    to zero for x86, as the preallocation should work almost all cases.
    However, this expectation was too naive; some applications try to
    allocate as the max buffer size as possible, and it leads to the
    memory exhaustion.  More badly, the commit changed the kconfig no
    longer adjustable for x86, so you can't fix it statically (although it
    can be still adjusted via procfs).
    
    So, practically seen, it's more recommended to set a reasonable limit
    for x86, too.  This patch follows to that experience, and changes the
    default to 2048 and allow the kconfig adjustable again.

    HID: lg-g15: Do not fail the probe when we fail to disable F# emulation
    
    commit b8a75eaddae9410767c7d95a1c5f3a547aae7b81 upstream.
    
    By default the G1-G12 keys on the Logitech gaming keyboards send
    F1 - F12 when in "generic HID" mode.
    
    The first thing the hid-lg-g15 driver does is disable this behavior.
    
    We have received a bugreport that this does not work when the keyboard
    is connected through an Aten KVM switch. Using a gaming keyboard with
    a KVM is a bit weird setup, but still we can try to fail a bit more
    gracefully here.
    
    On the G510 keyboards the same USB-interface which is used for the gaming
    keys is also used for the media-keys. Before this commit we would call
    hid_hw_stop() on failure to disable the F# emulation and then exit the
    probe method with an error code.
    
    This not only causes us to not handle the gaming-keys, but this also
    breaks the media keys which is a regression compared to the situation
    when these keyboards where handled by the generic hidinput driver.
    
    This commit changes the error handling to clear the hiddev drvdata
    (to disable our .raw_event handler) and then returning from the probe
    method with success.
    
    The net result of this is that, when connected through a KVM, things
    work as well as they did before the hid-lg-g15 driver was introduced.

    pwm: pca9685: Fix PWM/GPIO inter-operation
    
    commit 9cc5f232a4b6a0ef6e9b57876d61b88f61bdd7c2 upstream.
    
    This driver allows pwms to be requested as gpios via gpiolib. Obviously,
    it should not be allowed to request a GPIO when its corresponding PWM is
    already requested (and vice versa). So it requires some exclusion code.
    
    Given that the PWMm and GPIO cores are not synchronized with respect to
    each other, this exclusion code will also require proper
    synchronization.
    
    Such a mechanism was in place, but was inadvertently removed by Uwe's
    clean-up in commit e926b12c611c ("pwm: Clear chip_data in pwm_put()").
    
    Upon revisiting the synchronization mechanism, we found that
    theoretically, it could allow two threads to successfully request
    conflicting PWMs/GPIOs.
    
    Replace with a bitmap which tracks PWMs in-use, plus a mutex. As long as
    PWM and GPIO's respective request/free functions modify the in-use
    bitmap while holding the mutex, proper synchronization will be
    guaranteed.

    perf report: Fix no branch type statistics report issue
    
    commit c3b10649a80e9da2892c1fd3038c53abd57588f6 upstream.
    
    Previously we could get the report of branch type statistics.
    
    For example:
    
      # perf record -j any,save_type ...
      # t perf report --stdio
    
      #
      # Branch Statistics:
      #
      COND_FWD:  40.6%
      COND_BWD:   4.1%
      CROSS_4K:  24.7%
      CROSS_2M:  12.3%
          COND:  44.7%
        UNCOND:   0.0%
           IND:   6.1%
          CALL:  24.5%
           RET:  24.7%
    
    But now for the recent perf, it can't report the branch type statistics.
    
    It's a regression issue caused by commit 40c39e304641 ("perf report: Fix
    a no annotate browser displayed issue"), which only counts the branch
    type statistics for browser mode.
    
    This patch moves the branch_type_count() outside of ui__has_annotation()
    checking, then branch type statistics can work for stdio mode.

    acpi/nfit: improve bounds checking for 'func'
    
    commit 01091c496f920e634ea84b689f480c39016752a8 upstream.
    
    The 'func' variable can come from the user in the __nd_ioctl().  If it's
    too high then the (1 << func) shift in acpi_nfit_clear_to_send() is
    undefined.  In acpi_nfit_ctl() we pass 'func' to test_bit(func, &dsm_mask)
    which could result in an out of bounds access.
    
    To fix these issues, I introduced the NVDIMM_CMD_MAX (31) define and
    updated nfit_dsm_revid() to use that define as well instead of magic
    numbers.

    commit f775ac78fcfc6bdc96bdda07029d11f2a5e84869 upstream.
    
    Host event can be sent by remoteproc by any time, and
    cros_ec_rpmsg_callback would be called after cros_ec_rpmsg_create_ept.
    But the cros_ec_device is initialized after that, which cause host event
    handler to use cros_ec_device that are not initialized properly yet.
    
    Fix this by don't schedule host event handler before cros_ec_register
    returns. Instead, remember that we have a pending host event, and
    schedule host event handler after cros_ec_register.

    ovl: fix value of i_ino for lower hardlink corner case

    Commit 6dde1e42f497 ("ovl: make i_ino consistent with st_ino in more

    i_ino to xino map of real ino.
    
    Specifically, it also relaxed the pre-condition that index=on for
    consistent i_ino. This opened the corner case of lower hardlink in
    ovl_get_inode(), which calls ovl_fill_inode() with ino=0 and then
    ovl_init_inode() is called to set i_ino to lower real ino without the xino
    mapping.
    
    Pass the correct values of ino;fsid in this case to ovl_fill_inode(), so it
    can initialize i_ino correctly.

    net: phy: marvell: Fix pause frame negotiation
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b72f84f8fb65e83e85e9be58eabcf95a40b8f46 ]
    
    The negotiation of flow control / pause frame modes was broken since
    commit fcf1f59afc67 ("net: phy: marvell: rearrange to use
    genphy_read_lpa()") moved the setting of phydev->duplex below the
    phy_resolve_aneg_pause call. Due to a check of DUPLEX_FULL in that
    function, phydev->pause was no longer set.
    
    Fix it by moving the parsing of the status variable before the blocks
    dealing with the pause frames.
    
    As the Marvell 88E1510 datasheet does not specify the timing between the
    link status and the "Speed and Duplex Resolved" bit, we have to force
    the link down as long as the resolved bit is not set, to avoid reporting
    link up before we even have valid Speed/Duplex.
    
    Tested with a Marvell 88E1510 (RGMII to Copper/1000Base-T)

    After commit bfcb813203e619a8960a819bf533ad2a108d8105 ("net: dsa:

    an allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac compatible Ethernet MAC started to fail
    by rejecting a MTU of 1536. The reason for that is that the DMA
    capabilities are not readable on this version of the IP, and there
    is also no 'tx-fifo-depth' property being provided in Device Tree. The
    property is documented as optional, and is not provided.

    net: mscc: ocelot: fix untagged packet drops when enslaving to vlan aware bridge
    
    [ Upstream commit 87b0f983f66f23762921129fd35966eddc3f2dae ]
    
    To rehash a previous explanation given in commit 1c44ce560b4d ("net:
    mscc: ocelot: fix vlan_filtering when enslaving to bridge before link is
    up"), the switch driver operates the in a mode where a single VLAN can
    be transmitted as untagged on a particular egress port. That is the
    "native VLAN on trunk port" use case.
    
    The configuration for this native VLAN is driven in 2 ways:
     - Set the egress port rewriter to strip the VLAN tag for the native
       VID (as it is egress-untagged, after all).
     - Configure the ingress port to drop untagged and priority-tagged
       traffic, if there is no native VLAN. The intention of this setting is
       that a trunk port with no native VLAN should not accept untagged
       traffic.
    
    Since both of the above configurations for the native VLAN should only
    be done if VLAN awareness is requested, they are actually done from the
    ocelot_port_vlan_filtering function, after the basic procedure of
    toggling the VLAN awareness flag of the port.
    
    But there's a problem with that simplistic approach: we are trying to
    juggle with 2 independent variables from a single function:
     - Native VLAN of the port - its value is held in port->vid.
     - VLAN awareness state of the port - currently there are some issues
       here, more on that later*.
    The actual problem can be seen when enslaving the switch ports to a VLAN
    filtering bridge:
     0. The driver configures a pvid of zero for each port, when in
        standalone mode. While the bridge configures a default_pvid of 1 for
        each port that gets added as a slave to it.
     1. The bridge calls ocelot_port_vlan_filtering with vlan_aware=true.
        The VLAN-filtering-dependent portion of the native VLAN
        configuration is done, considering that the native VLAN is 0.
     2. The bridge calls ocelot_vlan_add with vid=1, pvid=true,
        untagged=true. The native VLAN changes to 1 (change which gets
        propagated to hardware).
     3. ??? - nobody calls ocelot_port_vlan_filtering again, to reapply the
        VLAN-filtering-dependent portion of the native VLAN configuration,
        for the new native VLAN of 1. One can notice that after toggling "ip
        link set dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 0 && ip link set dev br0
        type bridge vlan_filtering 1", the new native VLAN finally makes it
        through and untagged traffic finally starts flowing again. But
        obviously that shouldn't be needed.
    
    So it is clear that 2 independent variables need to both re-trigger the
    native VLAN configuration. So we introduce the second variable as
    ocelot_port->vlan_aware.
    
    *Actually both the DSA Felix driver and the Ocelot driver already had
    each its own variable:
     - Ocelot: ocelot_port_private->vlan_aware
     - Felix: dsa_port->vlan_filtering
    but the common Ocelot library needs to work with a single, common,
    variable, so there is some refactoring done to move the vlan_aware
    property from the private structure into the common ocelot_port
    structure.

    net: icmp6: do not select saddr from iif when route has prefsrc set
    
    [ Upstream commit b93cfb9cd3af3adc9ba4854f178d5300f7544d3e ]
    
    Since commit fac6fce9bdb5 ("net: icmp6: provide input address for
    traceroute6") ICMPv6 errors have source addresses from the ingress
    interface. However, this overrides when source address selection is
    influenced by setting preferred source addresses on routes.
    
    This can result in ICMP errors being lost to upstream BCP38 filters
    when the wrong source addresses are used, breaking path MTU discovery
    and traceroute.
    
    This patch sets the modified source address selection to only take place
    when the route used has no prefsrc set.
    
    It can be tested with:

    [ Upstream commit 70f478ca085deec4d6c1f187f773f5827ddce7e8 ]
    
    Current value of nest_level, assigned from net_device lower_level value,
    does not reflect the actual number of vlan headers, needed to pop.
    For ex., if we have untagged ingress traffic sended over vlan devices,
    instead of one pop action, driver will perform two pop actions.
    To fix that, calculate nest_level as difference between vlan device and
    parent device lower_levels.

    net: ipv6: do not consider routes via gateways for anycast address check
    
    [ Upstream commit 03e2a984b6165621f287fadf5f4b5cd8b58dcaba ]
    
    The behaviour for what is considered an anycast address changed in
    commit 45e4fd26683c ("ipv6: Only create RTF_CACHE routes after
    encountering pmtu exception"). This now considers the first
    address in a subnet where there is a route via a gateway
    to be an anycast address.
    
    This breaks path MTU discovery and traceroutes when a host in a
    remote network uses the address at the start of a prefix
    (eg 2600:: advertised as 2600::/48 in the DFZ) as ICMP errors
    will not be sent to anycast addresses.
    
    This patch excludes any routes with a gateway, or via point to
    point links, like the behaviour previously from
    rt6_is_gw_or_nonexthop in net/ipv6/route.c.
    
    This can be tested with:
    ip link add v1 type veth peer name v2
    ip netns add test
    ip netns exec test ip link set lo up
    ip link set v2 netns test
    ip link set v1 up
    ip netns exec test ip link set v2 up
    ip addr add 2001:db8::1/64 dev v1 nodad
    ip addr add 2001:db8:100:: dev lo nodad
    ip netns exec test ip addr add 2001:db8::2/64 dev v2 nodad
    ip netns exec test ip route add unreachable 2001:db8:1::1
    ip netns exec test ip route add 2001:db8:100::/64 via 2001:db8::1
    ip netns exec test sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
    ip route add 2001:db8:1::1 via 2001:db8::2
    ping -I 2001:db8::1 2001:db8:1::1 -c1
    ping -I 2001:db8:100:: 2001:db8:1::1 -c1
    ip addr delete 2001:db8:100:: dev lo
    ip netns delete test
    
    Currently the first ping will get back a destination unreachable ICMP
    error, but the second will never get a response, with "icmp6_send:
    acast source" logged. After this patch, both get destination
    unreachable ICMP replies.

    net: dsa: mt7530: fix tagged frames pass-through in VLAN-unaware mode
    
    [ Upstream commit e045124e93995fe01e42ed530003ddba5d55db4f ]
    
    In VLAN-unaware mode, the Egress Tag (EG_TAG) field in Port VLAN
    Control register must be set to Consistent to let tagged frames pass
    through as is, otherwise their tags will be stripped.

    l2tp: Allow management of tunnels and session in user namespace
    
    [ Upstream commit 2abe05234f2e892728c388169631e4b99f354c86 ]
    
    Creation and management of L2TPv3 tunnels and session through netlink
    requires CAP_NET_ADMIN. However, a process with CAP_NET_ADMIN in a
    non-initial user namespace gets an EPERM due to the use of the
    genetlink GENL_ADMIN_PERM flag. Thus, management of L2TP VPNs inside
    an unprivileged container won't work.
    
    We replaced the GENL_ADMIN_PERM by the GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM flag
    similar to other network modules which also had this problem, e.g.,
    openvswitch (commit 4a92602aa1cd "openvswitch: allow management from
    inside user namespaces") and nl80211 (commit 5617c6cd6f844 "nl80211:
    Allow privileged operations from user namespaces").
    
    I tested this in the container runtime trustm3 (trustm3.github.io)
    and was able to create l2tp tunnels and sessions in unpriviliged
    (user namespaced) containers using a private network namespace.
    For other runtimes such as docker or lxc this should work, too.

    hsr: check protocol version in hsr_newlink()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4faab8c446def7667adf1f722456c2f4c304069c ]
    
    In the current hsr code, only 0 and 1 protocol versions are valid.
    But current hsr code doesn't check the version, which is received by
    userspace.
    
    Test commands:
        ip link add dummy0 type dummy
        ip link add dummy1 type dummy
        ip link add hsr0 type hsr slave1 dummy0 slave2 dummy1 version 4
    
    In the test commands, version 4 is invalid.
    So, the command should be failed.
    
    After this patch, following error will occur.
    "Error: hsr: Only versions 0..1 are supported."

    amd-xgbe: Use __napi_schedule() in BH context
    
    [ Upstream commit d518691cbd3be3dae218e05cca3f3fc9b2f1aa77 ]
    
    The driver uses __napi_schedule_irqoff() which is fine as long as it is
    invoked with disabled interrupts by everybody. Since the commit
    mentioned below the driver may invoke xgbe_isr_task() in tasklet/softirq
    context. This may lead to list corruption if another driver uses
    __napi_schedule_irqoff() in IRQ context.
    
    Use __napi_schedule() which safe to use from IRQ and softirq context.
