    dm integrity: fix integrity recalculation that is improperly skipped
    
    commit 5df96f2b9f58a5d2dc1f30fe7de75e197f2c25f2 upstream.
    
    Commit adc0daad366b62ca1bce3e2958a40b0b71a8b8b3 ("dm: report suspended
    device during destroy") broke integrity recalculation.
    
    The problem is dm_suspended() returns true not only during suspend,
    but also during resume. So this race condition could occur:
    1. dm_integrity_resume calls queue_work(ic->recalc_wq, &ic->recalc_work)
    2. integrity_recalc (&ic->recalc_work) preempts the current thread
    3. integrity_recalc calls if (unlikely(dm_suspended(ic->ti))) goto unlock_ret;
    4. integrity_recalc exits and no recalculating is done.
    
    To fix this race condition, add a function dm_post_suspending that is
    only true during the postsuspend phase and use it instead of
    dm_suspended().

    ASoC: topology: fix kernel oops on route addition error
    
    commit 6f0307df83f2aa6bdf656c2219c89ce96502d20e upstream.
    
    When errors happens while loading graph components, the kernel oopses
    while trying to remove all topology components. This can be
    root-caused to a list pointing to memory that was already freed on
    error.
    
    remove_route() is already called on errors and will perform the
    required cleanups so there's no need to free the route memory in
    soc_tplg_dapm_graph_elems_load() if the route was added to the
    list. We do however want to free the routes allocated but not added to
    the list.

    ASoC: qcom: Drop HAS_DMA dependency to fix link failure
    
    commit b6aa06de7757667bac88997a8807b143b8436035 upstream.
    
    When building on allyesconfig kernel for a NO_DMA=y platform (e.g.
    Sun-3), CONFIG_SND_SOC_QCOM_COMMON=y, but CONFIG_SND_SOC_QDSP6_AFE=n,
    leading to a link failure:
    
        sound/soc/qcom/common.o: In function `qcom_snd_parse_of':
        common.c:(.text+0x2e2): undefined reference to `q6afe_is_rx_port'
    
    While SND_SOC_QDSP6 depends on HAS_DMA, SND_SOC_MSM8996 and SND_SOC_SDM845
    don't, so the following warning is seen:
    
        WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SND_SOC_QDSP6
          Depends on [n]: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && QCOM_APR [=y] && HAS_DMA [=n]
          Selected by [y]:
          - SND_SOC_MSM8996 [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && QCOM_APR [=y]
          - SND_SOC_SDM845 [=y] && SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_SOC [=y] && QCOM_APR [=y] && CROS_EC [=y] && I2C [=y] && SOUNDWIRE [=y]
    
    Until recently, this warning was harmless (from a compile-testing
    point-of-view), but the new user of q6afe_is_rx_port() turned this into
    a hard failure.
    
    As the QDSP6 driver itself builds fine if NO_DMA=y, and it depends on
    QCOM_APR (which in turns depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST), it is
    safe to increase compile testing coverage.  Hence fix the link failure
    by dropping the HAS_DMA dependency of SND_SOC_QDSP6.

    ASoC: rt5670: Add new gpio1_is_ext_spk_en quirk and enable it on the Lenovo Miix 2 10
    
    commit 85ca6b17e2bb96b19caac3b02c003d670b66de96 upstream.
    
    The Lenovo Miix 2 10 has a keyboard dock with extra speakers in the dock.
    Rather then the ACL5672's GPIO1 pin being used as IRQ to the CPU, it is
    actually used to enable the amplifier for these speakers
    (the IRQ to the CPU comes directly from the jack-detect switch).
    
    Add a quirk for having an ext speaker-amplifier enable pin on GPIO1
    and replace the Lenovo Miix 2 10's dmi_system_id table entry's wrong
    GPIO_DEV quirk (which needs to be renamed to GPIO1_IS_IRQ) with the
    new RT5670_GPIO1_IS_EXT_SPK_EN quirk, so that we enable the external
    speaker-amplifier as necessary.
    
    Also update the ident field for the dmi_system_id table entry, the
    Miix models are not Thinkpads.

    x86, vmlinux.lds: Page-align end of ..page_aligned sections
    
    commit de2b41be8fcccb2f5b6c480d35df590476344201 upstream.
    
    On x86-32 the idt_table with 256 entries needs only 2048 bytes. It is
    page-aligned, but the end of the .bss..page_aligned section is not
    guaranteed to be page-aligned.
    
    As a result, objects from other .bss sections may end up on the same 4k
    page as the idt_table, and will accidentially get mapped read-only during
    boot, causing unexpected page-faults when the kernel writes to them.
    
    This could be worked around by making the objects in the page aligned
    sections page sized, but that's wrong.
    
    Explicit sections which store only page aligned objects have an implicit
    guarantee that the object is alone in the page in which it is placed. That
    works for all objects except the last one. That's inconsistent.
    
    Enforcing page sized objects for these sections would wreckage memory
    sanitizers, because the object becomes artificially larger than it should
    be and out of bound access becomes legit.
    
    Align the end of the .bss..page_aligned and .data..page_aligned section on
    page-size so all objects places in these sections are guaranteed to have
    their own page.

    parisc: Add atomic64_set_release() define to avoid CPU soft lockups
    
    commit be6577af0cef934ccb036445314072e8cb9217b9 upstream.

    This is the inner loop of bit_spin_lock which is called by hlist_bl_unlock in

             * busywait with less bus contention for a good time to
             * attempt to acquire the lock bit.
             */
            preempt_disable();
    #if defined(CONFIG_SMP) || defined(CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK)
            while (unlikely(test_and_set_bit_lock(bitnum, addr))) {
                    preempt_enable();
                    do {
                            cpu_relax();
                    } while (test_bit(bitnum, addr));
                    preempt_disable();
            }
    #endif
            __acquire(bitlock);
    }
    
    After consideration, I realized that we must be losing bit unlocks.
    Then, I noticed that we missed defining atomic64_set_release().
    Adding this define fixes the stalls in bit operations.

    drm/amdgpu: Fix NULL dereference in dpm sysfs handlers
    
    commit 38e0c89a19fd13f28d2b4721035160a3e66e270b upstream.
    
    NULL dereference occurs when string that is not ended with space or
    newline is written to some dpm sysfs interface (for example pp_dpm_sclk).
    This happens because strsep replaces the tmp with NULL if the delimiter
    is not present in string, which is then dereferenced by tmp[0].
    
    Reproduction example:
    sudo sh -c 'echo -n 1 > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp_dpm_sclk'

    commit ebd4050c6144b38098d8eed34df461e5e3fa82a9 upstream.
    
    When calculating the clock divider, start dividing at 2 instead of 1.
    The divider is divided by two at the end of the calculation, so starting
    at 1 may result in a divider of 0, which shouldn't happen.

    io-mapping: indicate mapping failure
    
    commit e0b3e0b1a04367fc15c07f44e78361545b55357c upstream.
    
    The !ATOMIC_IOMAP version of io_maping_init_wc will always return
    success, even when the ioremap fails.
    
    Since the ATOMIC_IOMAP version returns NULL when the init fails, and
    callers check for a NULL return on error this is unexpected.
    
    During a device probe, where the ioremap failed, a crash can look like
    this:

    khugepaged: fix null-pointer dereference due to race
    
    commit 594cced14ad3903166c8b091ff96adac7552f0b3 upstream.
    
    khugepaged has to drop mmap lock several times while collapsing a page.
    The situation can change while the lock is dropped and we need to
    re-validate that the VMA is still in place and the PMD is still subject
    for collapse.
    
    But we miss one corner case: while collapsing an anonymous pages the VMA
    could be replaced with file VMA.  If the file VMA doesn't have any
    private pages we get NULL pointer dereference:

    mm: memcg/slab: fix memory leak at non-root kmem_cache destroy
    
    commit d38a2b7a9c939e6d7329ab92b96559ccebf7b135 upstream.
    
    If the kmem_cache refcount is greater than one, we should not mark the
    root kmem_cache as dying.  If we mark the root kmem_cache dying
    incorrectly, the non-root kmem_cache can never be destroyed.  It
    resulted in memory leak when memcg was destroyed.  We can use the
    following steps to reproduce.
    
      1) Use kmem_cache_create() to create a new kmem_cache named A.
      2) Coincidentally, the kmem_cache A is an alias for kmem_cache B,
         so the refcount of B is just increased.
      3) Use kmem_cache_destroy() to destroy the kmem_cache A, just
         decrease the B's refcount but mark the B as dying.
      4) Create a new memory cgroup and alloc memory from the kmem_cache
         B. It leads to create a non-root kmem_cache for allocating memory.
      5) When destroy the memory cgroup created in the step 4), the
         non-root kmem_cache can never be destroyed.
    
    If we repeat steps 4) and 5), this will cause a lot of memory leak.  So
    only when refcount reach zero, we mark the root kmem_cache as dying.

    mm/memcg: fix refcount error while moving and swapping
    
    commit 8d22a9351035ef2ff12ef163a1091b8b8cf1e49c upstream.
    
    It was hard to keep a test running, moving tasks between memcgs with
    move_charge_at_immigrate, while swapping: mem_cgroup_id_get_many()'s
    refcount is discovered to be 0 (supposedly impossible), so it is then
    forced to REFCOUNT_SATURATED, and after thousands of warnings in quick
    succession, the test is at last put out of misery by being OOM killed.
    
    This is because of the way moved_swap accounting was saved up until the
    task move gets completed in __mem_cgroup_clear_mc(), deferred from when
    mem_cgroup_move_swap_account() actually exchanged old and new ids.
    Concurrent activity can free up swap quicker than the task is scanned,
    bringing id refcount down 0 (which should only be possible when
    offlining).
    
    Just skip that optimization: do that part of the accounting immediately.

    mm/mmap.c: close race between munmap() and expand_upwards()/downwards()
    
    commit 246c320a8cfe0b11d81a4af38fa9985ef0cc9a4c upstream.
    
    VMA with VM_GROWSDOWN or VM_GROWSUP flag set can change their size under
    mmap_read_lock().  It can lead to race with __do_munmap():
    
            Thread A                        Thread B
    __do_munmap()
      detach_vmas_to_be_unmapped()
      mmap_write_downgrade()
                                    expand_downwards()
                                      vma->vm_start = address;
                                      // The VMA now overlaps with
                                      // VMAs detached by the Thread A
                                    // page fault populates expanded part
                                    // of the VMA
      unmap_region()
        // Zaps pagetables partly
        // populated by Thread B
    
    Similar race exists for expand_upwards().
    
    The fix is to avoid downgrading mmap_lock in __do_munmap() if detached
    VMAs are next to VM_GROWSDOWN or VM_GROWSUP VMA.

    Makefile: Fix GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR prefix for Clang cross compilation
    
    commit ca9b31f6bb9c6aa9b4e5f0792f39a97bbffb8c51 upstream.
    
    When CROSS_COMPILE is set (e.g. aarch64-linux-gnu-), if
    $(CROSS_COMPILE)elfedit is found at /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-elfedit,
    GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR will be set to /usr/bin/.  --prefix= will be set to
    /usr/bin/ and Clang as of 11 will search for both
    $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu-$needle and $(prefix)$needle.
    
    GCC searchs for $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu/$version/$needle,
    $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu/$needle and $(prefix)$needle. In practice,
    $(prefix)aarch64-linux-gnu/$needle rarely contains executables.
    
    To better model how GCC's -B/--prefix takes in effect in practice, newer
    Clang (since
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/3452a0d8c17f7166f479706b293caf6ac76ffd90)
    only searches for $(prefix)$needle. Currently it will find /usr/bin/as
    instead of /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-as.
    
    Set --prefix= to $(GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR)$(notdir $(CROSS_COMPILE))
    (/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-) so that newer Clang can find the
    appropriate cross compiling GNU as (when -no-integrated-as is in
    effect).

    vt: Reject zero-sized screen buffer size.
    
    commit ce684552a266cb1c7cc2f7e623f38567adec6653 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting general protection fault in do_con_write() [1] caused
    by vc->vc_screenbuf == ZERO_SIZE_PTR caused by vc->vc_screenbuf_size == 0
    caused by vc->vc_cols == vc->vc_rows == vc->vc_size_row == 0 caused by
    fb_set_var() from ioctl(FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO) on /dev/fb0 , for
    gotoxy(vc, 0, 0) from reset_terminal() from vc_init() from vc_allocate()
     from con_install() from tty_init_dev() from tty_open() on such console
    causes vc->vc_pos == 0x10000000e due to
    ((unsigned long) ZERO_SIZE_PTR) + -1U * 0 + (-1U << 1).
    
    I don't think that a console with 0 column or 0 row makes sense. And it
    seems that vc_do_resize() does not intend to allow resizing a console to
    0 column or 0 row due to
    
      new_cols = (cols ? cols : vc->vc_cols);
      new_rows = (lines ? lines : vc->vc_rows);
    
    exception.
    
    Theoretically, cols and rows can be any range as long as
    0 < cols * rows * 2 <= KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is satisfied (e.g.
    cols == 1048576 && rows == 2 is possible) because of
    
      vc->vc_size_row = vc->vc_cols << 1;
      vc->vc_screenbuf_size = vc->vc_rows * vc->vc_size_row;
    
    in visual_init() and kzalloc(vc->vc_screenbuf_size) in vc_allocate().
    
    Since we can detect cols == 0 or rows == 0 via screenbuf_size = 0 in
    visual_init(), we can reject kzalloc(0). Then, vc_allocate() will return
    an error, and con_write() will not be called on a console with 0 column
    or 0 row.
    
    We need to make sure that integer overflow in visual_init() won't happen.
    Since vc_do_resize() restricts cols <= 32767 and rows <= 32767, applying
    1 <= cols <= 32767 and 1 <= rows <= 32767 restrictions to vc_allocate()
    will be practically fine.
    
    This patch does not touch con_init(), for returning -EINVAL there
    does not help when we are not returning -ENOMEM.

    fbdev: Detect integer underflow at "struct fbcon_ops"->clear_margins.
    
    commit 033724d6864245a11f8e04c066002e6ad22b3fd0 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting general protection fault in bitfill_aligned() [1]
    caused by integer underflow in bit_clear_margins(). The cause of this
    problem is when and how do_vc_resize() updates vc->vc_{cols,rows}.
    
    If vc_do_resize() fails (e.g. kzalloc() fails) when var.xres or var.yres
    is going to shrink, vc->vc_{cols,rows} will not be updated. This allows
    bit_clear_margins() to see info->var.xres < (vc->vc_cols * cw) or
    info->var.yres < (vc->vc_rows * ch). Unexpectedly large rw or bh will
    try to overrun the __iomem region and causes general protection fault.
    
    Also, vc_resize(vc, 0, 0) does not set vc->vc_{cols,rows} = 0 due to
    
      new_cols = (cols ? cols : vc->vc_cols);
      new_rows = (lines ? lines : vc->vc_rows);
    
    exception. Since cols and lines are calculated as
    
      cols = FBCON_SWAP(ops->rotate, info->var.xres, info->var.yres);
      rows = FBCON_SWAP(ops->rotate, info->var.yres, info->var.xres);
      cols /= vc->vc_font.width;
      rows /= vc->vc_font.height;
      vc_resize(vc, cols, rows);
    
    in fbcon_modechanged(), var.xres < vc->vc_font.width makes cols = 0
    and var.yres < vc->vc_font.height makes rows = 0. This means that
    
      const int fd = open("/dev/fb0", O_ACCMODE);
      struct fb_var_screeninfo var = { };
      ioctl(fd, FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO, &var);
      var.xres = var.yres = 1;
      ioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO, &var);
    
    easily reproduces integer underflow bug explained above.
    
    Of course, callers of vc_resize() are not handling vc_do_resize() failure
    is bad. But we can't avoid vc_resize(vc, 0, 0) which returns 0. Therefore,
    as a band-aid workaround, this patch checks integer underflow in
    "struct fbcon_ops"->clear_margins call, assuming that
    vc->vc_cols * vc->vc_font.width and vc->vc_rows * vc->vc_font.heigh do not
    cause integer overflow.

    /dev/mem: Add missing memory barriers for devmem_inode
    
    commit b34e7e298d7a5ed76b3aa327c240c29f1ef6dd22 upstream.
    
    WRITE_ONCE() isn't the correct way to publish a pointer to a data
    structure, since it doesn't include a write memory barrier.  Therefore
    other tasks may see that the pointer has been set but not see that the
    pointed-to memory has finished being initialized yet.  Instead a
    primitive with "release" semantics is needed.
    
    Use smp_store_release() for this.
    
    The use of READ_ONCE() on the read side is still potentially correct if
    there's no control dependency, i.e. if all memory being "published" is
    transitively reachable via the pointer itself.  But this pairing is
    somewhat confusing and error-prone.  So just upgrade the read side to
    smp_load_acquire() so that it clearly pairs with smp_store_release().

    serial: 8250_mtk: Fix high-speed baud rates clamping
    
    commit 551e553f0d4ab623e2a6f424ab5834f9c7b5229c upstream.
    
    Commit 7b668c064ec3 ("serial: 8250: Fix max baud limit in generic 8250
    port") fixed limits of a baud rate setting for a generic 8250 port.
    In other words since that commit the baud rate has been permitted to be
    within [uartclk / 16 / UART_DIV_MAX; uartclk / 16], which is absolutely
    normal for a standard 8250 UART port. But there are custom 8250 ports,
    which provide extended baud rate limits. In particular the Mediatek 8250
    port can work with baud rates up to "uartclk" speed.
    
    Normally that and any other peculiarity is supposed to be handled in a
    custom set_termios() callback implemented in the vendor-specific
    8250-port glue-driver. Currently that is how it's done for the most of
    the vendor-specific 8250 ports, but for some reason for Mediatek a
    solution has been spread out to both the glue-driver and to the generic
    8250-port code. Due to that a bug has been introduced, which permitted the
    extended baud rate limit for all even for standard 8250-ports. The bug
    has been fixed by the commit 7b668c064ec3 ("serial: 8250: Fix max baud
    limit in generic 8250 port") by narrowing the baud rates limit back down to
    the normal bounds. Unfortunately by doing so we also broke the
    Mediatek-specific extended bauds feature.
    
    A fix of the problem described above is twofold. First since we can't get
    back the extended baud rate limits feature to the generic set_termios()
    function and that method supports only a standard baud rates range, the
    requested baud rate must be locally stored before calling it and then
    restored back to the new termios structure after the generic set_termios()
    finished its magic business. By doing so we still use the
    serial8250_do_set_termios() method to set the LCR/MCR/FCR/etc. registers,
    while the extended baud rate setting procedure will be performed later in
    the custom Mediatek-specific set_termios() callback. Second since a true
    baud rate is now fully calculated in the custom set_termios() method we
    need to locally update the port timeout by calling the
    uart_update_timeout() function. After the fixes described above are
    implemented in the 8250_mtk.c driver, the Mediatek 8250-port should
    get back to normally working with extended baud rates.

    staging: comedi: ni_6527: fix INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG support
    
    commit f07804ec77d77f8a9dcf570a24154e17747bc82f upstream.
    
    `ni6527_intr_insn_config()` processes `INSN_CONFIG` comedi instructions
    for the "interrupt" subdevice.  When `data[0]` is
    `INSN_CONFIG_DIGITAL_TRIG` it is configuring the digital trigger.  When
    `data[2]` is `COMEDI_DIGITAL_TRIG_ENABLE_EDGES` it is configuring rising
    and falling edge detection for the digital trigger, using a base channel
    number (or shift amount) in `data[3]`, a rising edge bitmask in
    `data[4]` and falling edge bitmask in `data[5]`.
    
    If the base channel number (shift amount) is greater than or equal to
    the number of channels (24) of the digital input subdevice, there are no
    changes to the rising and falling edges, so the mask of channels to be
    changed can be set to 0, otherwise the mask of channels to be changed,
    and the rising and falling edge bitmasks are shifted by the base channel
    number before calling `ni6527_set_edge_detection()` to change the
    appropriate registers.  Unfortunately, the code is comparing the base
    channel (shift amount) to the interrupt subdevice's number of channels
    (1) instead of the digital input subdevice's number of channels (24).
    Fix it by comparing to 32 because all shift amounts for an `unsigned
    int` must be less than that and everything from bit 24 upwards is
    ignored by `ni6527_set_edge_detection()` anyway.

    tty: xilinx_uartps: Really fix id assignment
    
    commit 22a82fa7d6c3e16d56a036b1fa697a39b954adf0 upstream.
    
    The problems started with the revert (18cc7ac8a28e28). The
    cdns_uart_console.index is statically assigned -1. When the port is
    registered, Linux assigns consecutive numbers to it. It turned out that
    when using ttyPS1 as console, the index is not updated as we are reusing
    the same cdns_uart_console instance for multiple ports. When registering
    ttyPS0, it gets updated from -1 to 0, but when registering ttyPS1, it
    already is 0 and not updated.
    
    That led to 2ae11c46d5fdc4. It assigns the index prior to registering
    the uart_driver once. Unfortunately, that ended up breaking the
    situation where the probe order does not match the id order. When using
    the same device tree for both uboot and linux, it is important that the
    serial0 alias points to the console. So some boards reverse those
    aliases. This was reported by Jan Kiszka. The proposed fix was reverting
    the index assignment and going back to the previous iteration.
    
    However such a reversed assignement (serial0 -> uart1, serial1 -> uart0)
    was already partially broken by the revert (18cc7ac8a28e28). While the
    ttyPS device works, the kmsg connection is already broken and kernel
    messages go missing. Reverting the id assignment does not fix this.
    
    >From the xilinx_uartps driver pov (after reverting the refactoring
    commits), there can be only one console. This manifests in static
    variables console_pprt and cdns_uart_console. These variables are not
    properly linked and can go out of sync. The cdns_uart_console.index is
    important for uart_add_one_port. We call that function for each port -
    one of which hopefully is the console. If it isn't, the CON_ENABLED flag
    is not set and console_port is cleared. The next cdns_uart_probe call
    then tries to register the next port using that same cdns_uart_console.
    
    It is important that console_port and cdns_uart_console (and its index
    in particular) stay in sync. The index assignment implemented by
    Shubhrajyoti Datta is correct in principle. It just may have to happen a
    second time if the first cdns_uart_probe call didn't encounter the
    console device. And we shouldn't change the index once the console uart
    is registered.

    This reverts commit 9ffad9263b467efd8f8dc7ae1941a0a655a2bab2.
    
    Upon additional testing with older servers, it was found that
    the original commit introduced a regression when using the old SMB1
    dialect and rsyncing over an existing file.
    
    The patch will need to be respun to address this, likely including
    a larger refactoring of the SMB1 and SMB3 rename code paths to make
    it less confusing and also to address some additional rename error
    cases that SMB3 may be able to workaround.

    binder: Don't use mmput() from shrinker function.
    
    commit f867c771f98891841c217fa8459244ed0dd28921 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting that mmput() from shrinker function has a risk of
    deadlock [1], for delayed_uprobe_add() from update_ref_ctr() calls
    kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL) with delayed_uprobe_lock held, and
    uprobe_clear_state() from __mmput() also holds delayed_uprobe_lock.
    
    Commit a1b2289cef92ef0e ("android: binder: drop lru lock in isolate
    callback") replaced mmput() with mmput_async() in order to avoid sleeping
    with spinlock held. But this patch replaces mmput() with mmput_async() in
    order not to start __mmput() from shrinker context.

    Forcefully unbinding PMU drivers during perf sampling will lead to

    To solve this issue, "suppress_bind_attrs" should be set to true, so

    asm-generic/mmiowb: Allow mmiowb_set_pending() when preemptible()
    
    [ Upstream commit bd024e82e4cd95c7f1a475a55f99871936c2b2db ]
    
    Although mmiowb() is concerned only with serialising MMIO writes occuring
    in contexts where a spinlock is held, the call to mmiowb_set_pending()
    from the MMIO write accessors can occur in preemptible contexts, such
    as during driver probe() functions where ordering between CPUs is not
    usually a concern, assuming that the task migration path provides the
    necessary ordering guarantees.
    
    Unfortunately, the default implementation of mmiowb_set_pending() is not
    preempt-safe, as it makes use of a a per-cpu variable to track its
    internal state. This has been reported to generate the following splat
    on riscv:
    
     | BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: swapper/0/1
     | caller is regmap_mmio_write32le+0x1c/0x46
     | CPU: 3 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 5.8.0-rc3-hfu+ #1
     | Call Trace:
     |  walk_stackframe+0x0/0x7a
     |  dump_stack+0x6e/0x88

     |  regmap_write+0x28/0x48
     |  sifive_gpio_probe+0xc0/0x1da
    
    Although it's possible to fix the driver in this case, other splats have
    been seen from other drivers, including the infamous 8250 UART, and so
    it's better to address this problem in the mmiowb core itself.
    
    Fix mmiowb_set_pending() by using the raw_cpu_ptr() to get at the mmiowb
    state and then only updating the 'mmiowb_pending' field if we are not
    preemptible (i.e. we have a non-zero nesting count).

    hwmon: (adm1275) Make sure we are reading enough data for different chips
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d1d41c075a1a54ba03370e268171fec20e06563 ]
    
    Issue:
    When PEC is enabled, binding adm1272 to the adm1275 would
    fail due to PEC error. See below:
    adm1275: probe of xxxx failed with error -74
    
    Diagnosis:
    Per the datasheet of adm1272, adm1278, adm1293 and amd1294,
    PMON_CONFIG (0xd4) is 16bits wide. On the other hand,
    PMON_CONFIG (0xd4) for adm1275 is 8bits wide. The driver should not
    assume everything is 8bits wide and read only 8bits from it.
    
    Solution:
    If it is adm1272, adm1278, adm1293 and adm1294, use i2c_read_word.
    Else, use i2c_read_byte
    
    Testing:
    Binding adm1272 to the driver.
    The change is only tested on adm1272.

    This function is used by dev_get_regmap() to retrieve a regmap for the

    can be used to specify one.
    
    The code here uses a pointer comparison to check for equal strings. This

    [ Upstream commit ed3e98e919aaaa47e9d9f8a40c3f6f4a22577842 ]
    
    Instead, expose the key via the input framework, as SW_MACHINE_COVER
    
    The chip-detect GPIO is actually detecting if the cover is closed.
    Technically it's possible to use the SD card with open cover. The
    only downside is risk of battery falling out and user being able
    to physically remove the card.
    
    The behaviour of SD card not being available when the device is
    open is unexpected and creates more problems than it solves. There
    is a high chance, that more people accidentally break their rootfs
    by opening the case without physically removing the card.

    HID: apple: Disable Fn-key key-re-mapping on clone keyboards
    
    [ Upstream commit a5d81646fa294eed57786a9310b06ca48902adf8 ]
    
    The Maxxter KB-BT-001 Bluetooth keyboard, which looks somewhat like the
    Apple Wireless Keyboard, is using the vendor and product IDs (05AC:0239)
    of the Apple Wireless Keyboard (2009 ANSI version) <sigh>.
    
    But its F1 - F10 keys are marked as sending F1 - F10, not the special
    functions hid-apple.c maps them too; and since its descriptors do not
    contain the HID_UP_CUSTOM | 0x0003 usage apple-hid looks for for the
    Fn-key, apple_setup_input() never gets called, so F1 - F6 are mapped
    to key-codes which have not been set in the keybit array causing them
    to not send any events at all.
    
    The lack of a usage code matching the Fn key in the clone is actually
    useful as this allows solving this problem in a generic way.
    
    This commits adds a fn_found flag and it adds a input_configured
    callback which checks if this flag is set once all usages have been
    mapped. If it is not set, then assume this is a clone and clear the
    quirks bitmap so that the hid-apple code does not add any special
    handling to this keyboard.
    
    This fixes F1 - F6 not sending anything at all and F7 - F12 sending
    the wrong codes on the Maxxter KB-BT-001 Bluetooth keyboard and on
    similar clones.

    device was added several times to the static device list and it got
    corrupted.
    
    This patch checks if the device is already in the list before adding
    it.

    serial: exar: Fix GPIO configuration for Sealevel cards based on XR17V35X
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fdbe136ae19ab751daaa4d08d9a42f3e30d17f9 ]
    
    Sealevel XR17V35X based devices are inoperable on kernel versions
    4.11 and above due to a change in the GPIO preconfiguration introduced in
    commit
    7dea8165f1d. This patch fixes this by preconfiguring the GPIO on Sealevel
    cards to the value (0x00) used prior to commit 7dea8165f1d
    
    With GPIOs preconfigured as per commit 7dea8165f1d all ports on
    Sealevel XR17V35X based devices become stuck in high impedance
    mode, regardless of dip-switch or software configuration. This
    causes the device to become effectively unusable. This patch (in
    various forms) has been distributed to our customers and no issues
    related to it have been reported.

    i2c: i2c-qcom-geni: Fix DMA transfer race
    
    [ Upstream commit 02b9aec59243c6240fc42884acc958602146ddf6 ]
    
    When I have KASAN enabled on my kernel and I start stressing the
    touchscreen my system tends to hang.  The touchscreen is one of the
    only things that does a lot of big i2c transfers and ends up hitting
    the DMA paths in the geni i2c driver.  It appears that KASAN adds
    enough delay in my system to tickle a race condition in the DMA setup
    code.
    
    When the system hangs, I found that it was running the geni_i2c_irq()
    over and over again.  It had these:
    
    m_stat   = 0x04000080
    rx_st    = 0x30000011
    dm_tx_st = 0x00000000
    dm_rx_st = 0x00000000
    dma      = 0x00000001
    
    Notably we're in DMA mode but are getting M_RX_IRQ_EN and
    M_RX_FIFO_WATERMARK_EN over and over again.
    
    Putting some traces in geni_i2c_rx_one_msg() showed that when we
    failed we were getting to the start of geni_i2c_rx_one_msg() but were
    never executing geni_se_rx_dma_prep().
    
    I believe that the problem here is that we are starting the geni
    command before we run geni_se_rx_dma_prep().  If a transfer makes it
    far enough before we do that then we get into the state I have
    observed.  Let's change the order, which seems to work fine.
    
    Although problems were seen on the RX path, code inspection suggests
    that the TX should be changed too.  Change it as well.

    enetc: Remove the mdio bus on PF probe bailout
    
    [ Upstream commit 26cb7085c8984e5b71d65c374a135134ed8cabb3 ]
    
    For ENETC ports that register an external MDIO bus,
    the bus doesn't get removed on the error bailout path
    of enetc_pf_probe().
    
    This issue became much more visible after recent:
    commit 07095c025ac2 ("net: enetc: Use DT protocol information to set up the ports")
    Before this commit, one could make probing fail on the error
    path only by having register_netdev() fail, which is unlikely.
    But after this commit, because it moved the enetc_of_phy_get()
    call up in the probing sequence, now we can trigger an mdiobus_free()
    bug just by forcing enetc_alloc_msix() to return error, i.e. with the
    'pci=nomsi' kernel bootarg (since ENETC relies on MSI support to work),
    as the calltrace below shows:

    If nsim_bpf_init() is failed, rtnl_unlock() should be called,
    but it isn't called.

    net: dsa: microchip: call phy_remove_link_mode during probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 3506b2f42dff66ea6814c3dfa1988bafb79e6f88 ]
    
    When doing "ip link set dev ... up" for a ksz9477 backed link,
    ksz9477_phy_setup is called and it calls phy_remove_link_mode to remove
    1000baseT HDX. During phy_remove_link_mode, phy_advertise_supported is
    called. Doing so reverts any previous change to advertised link modes
    e.g. using a udevd .link file.
    
    phy_remove_link_mode is not meant to be used while opening a link and
    should be called during phy probe when the link is not yet available to
    userspace.
    
    Therefore move the phy_remove_link_mode calls into
    ksz9477_switch_register. It indirectly calls dsa_register_switch, which
    creates the relevant struct phy_devices and we update the link modes
    right after that. At that time dev->features is already initialized by
    ksz9477_switch_detect.
    
    Remove phy_setup from ksz_dev_ops as no users remain.

    net: hns3: fix error handling for desc filling
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ceca59fb3ed48a693171bd571c4fcbd555b7f1f ]
    
    The content of the TX desc is automatically cleared by the HW
    when the HW has sent out the packet to the wire. When desc filling
    fails in hns3_nic_net_xmit(), it will call hns3_clear_desc() to do
    the error handling, which miss zeroing of the TX desc and the
    checking if a unmapping is needed.
    
    So add the zeroing and checking in hns3_clear_desc() to avoid the
    above problem. Also add DESC_TYPE_UNKNOWN to indicate the info in
    desc_cb is not valid, because hns3_nic_reclaim_desc() may treat
    the desc_cb->type of zero as packet and add to the sent pkt
    statistics accordingly.

    bonding: check error value of register_netdevice() immediately
    
    [ Upstream commit 544f287b84959203367cd29e16e772717612fab4 ]
    
    If register_netdevice() is failed, net_device should not be used
    because variables are uninitialized or freed.
    So, the routine should be stopped immediately.
    But, bond_create() doesn't check return value of register_netdevice()
    immediately. That will result in a panic because of using uninitialized
    or freed memory.
    
    Test commands:
        modprobe netdev-notifier-error-inject
        echo -22 > /sys/kernel/debug/notifier-error-inject/netdev/\
    actions/NETDEV_REGISTER/error
        modprobe bonding max_bonds=3

    RDMA/mlx5: Use xa_lock_irq when access to SRQ table
    
    [ Upstream commit c3d6057e07a5d15be7c69ea545b3f91877808c96 ]
    
    SRQ table is accessed both from interrupt and process context,
    therefore we must use xa_lock_irq.
    
       inconsistent {IN-HARDIRQ-W} -> {HARDIRQ-ON-W} usage.

    vsock/virtio: annotate 'the_virtio_vsock' RCU pointer

    bnxt_en: Fix completion ring sizing with TPA enabled.
    
    [ Upstream commit 27640ce68d21e556b66bc5fa022aacd26e53c947 ]
    
    The current completion ring sizing formula is wrong with TPA enabled.
    The formula assumes that the number of TPA completions are bound by the
    RX ring size, but that's not true.  TPA_START completions are immediately
    recycled so they are not bound by the RX ring size.  We must add
    bp->max_tpa to the worst case maximum RX and TPA completions.
    
    The completion ring can overflow because of this mistake.  This will
    cause hardware to disable the completion ring when this happens,
    leading to RX and TX traffic to stall on that ring.  This issue is
    generally exposed only when the RX ring size is set very small.
    
    Fix the formula by adding bp->max_tpa to the number of RX completions
    if TPA is enabled.

    btrfs: fix mount failure caused by race with umount
    
    commit 48cfa61b58a1fee0bc49eef04f8ccf31493b7cdd upstream.
    
    It is possible to cause a btrfs mount to fail by racing it with a slow
    umount. The crux of the sequence is generic_shutdown_super not yet
    calling sop->put_super before btrfs_mount_root calls btrfs_open_devices.
    If that occurs, btrfs_open_devices will decide the opened counter is
    non-zero, increment it, and skip resetting fs_devices->total_rw_bytes to
    0. From here, mount will call sget which will result in grab_super
    trying to take the super block umount semaphore. That semaphore will be
    held by the slow umount, so mount will block. Before up-ing the
    semaphore, umount will delete the super block, resulting in mount's sget
    reliably allocating a new one, which causes the mount path to dutifully
    fill it out, and increment total_rw_bytes a second time, which causes
    the mount to fail, as we see double the expected bytes.
    
    Here is the sequence laid out in greater detail:
    
    CPU0                                                    CPU1
    down_write sb->s_umount
    btrfs_kill_super
      kill_anon_super(sb)
        generic_shutdown_super(sb);
          shrink_dcache_for_umount(sb);
          sync_filesystem(sb);
          evict_inodes(sb); // SLOW
    
                                                  btrfs_mount_root
                                                    btrfs_scan_one_device
                                                    fs_devices = device->fs_devices
                                                    fs_info->fs_devices = fs_devices
                                                    // fs_devices-opened makes this a no-op
                                                    btrfs_open_devices(fs_devices, mode, fs_type)
                                                    s = sget(fs_type, test, set, flags, fs_info);

                                                          read_one_dev // increment total_rw_bytes again!!
                                                          super_total_bytes < fs_devices->total_rw_bytes // ERROR!!!
    
    To fix this, we clear total_rw_bytes from within btrfs_read_chunk_tree
    before the calls to read_one_dev, while holding the sb umount semaphore
    and the uuid mutex.
    
    To reproduce, it is sufficient to dirty a decent number of inodes, then
    quickly umount and mount.
    
      for i in $(seq 0 500)
      do
        dd if=/dev/zero of="/mnt/foo/$i" bs=1M count=1
      done
      umount /mnt/foo&
      mount /mnt/foo
    
    does the trick for me.

    btrfs: fix double free on ulist after backref resolution failure
    
    commit 580c079b5766ac706f56eec5c79aee4bf929fef6 upstream.
    
    At btrfs_find_all_roots_safe() we allocate a ulist and set the **roots
    argument to point to it. However if later we fail due to an error returned
    by find_parent_nodes(), we free that ulist but leave a dangling pointer in
    the **roots argument. Upon receiving the error, a caller of this function
    can attempt to free the same ulist again, resulting in an invalid memory
    access.
    
    One such scenario is during qgroup accounting:
    
    btrfs_qgroup_account_extents()
    
     --> calls btrfs_find_all_roots() passes &new_roots (a stack allocated
         pointer) to btrfs_find_all_roots()
    
       --> btrfs_find_all_roots() just calls btrfs_find_all_roots_safe()
           passing &new_roots to it
    
         --> allocates ulist and assigns its address to **roots (which
             points to new_roots from btrfs_qgroup_account_extents())
    
         --> find_parent_nodes() returns an error, so we free the ulist
             and leave **roots pointing to it after returning
    
     --> btrfs_qgroup_account_extents() sees btrfs_find_all_roots() returned
         an error and jumps to the label 'cleanup', which just tries to
         free again the same ulist

    ASoC: rt5670: Correct RT5670_LDO_SEL_MASK
    
    commit 5cacc6f5764e94fa753b2c1f5f7f1f3f74286e82 upstream.
    
    The RT5670_PWR_ANLG1 register has 3 bits to select the LDO voltage,
    so the correct mask is 0x7 not 0x3.
    
    Because of this wrong mask we were programming the ldo bits
    to a setting of binary 001 (0x05 & 0x03) instead of binary 101
    when moving to SND_SOC_BIAS_PREPARE.
    
    According to the datasheet 001 is a reserved value, so no idea
    what it did, since the driver was working fine before I guess we
    got lucky and it does something which is ok.

    ALSA: info: Drop WARN_ON() from buffer NULL sanity check
    
    commit 60379ba08532eca861e933b389526a4dc89e0c42 upstream.
    
    snd_info_get_line() has a sanity check of NULL buffer -- both buffer
    itself being NULL and buffer->buffer being NULL.  Basically both
    checks are valid and necessary, but the problem is that it's with
    snd_BUG_ON() macro that triggers WARN_ON().  The latter condition
    (NULL buffer->buffer) can be met arbitrarily by user since the buffer
    is allocated at the first write, so it means that user can trigger
    WARN_ON() at will.
    
    This patch addresses it by simply moving buffer->buffer NULL check out
    of snd_BUG_ON() so that spurious WARNING is no longer triggered.

    uprobes: Change handle_swbp() to send SIGTRAP with si_code=SI_KERNEL, to fix GDB regression
    
    commit fe5ed7ab99c656bd2f5b79b49df0e9ebf2cead8a upstream.
    
    If a tracee is uprobed and it hits int3 inserted by debugger, handle_swbp()
    does send_sig(SIGTRAP, current, 0) which means si_code == SI_USER. This used
    to work when this code was written, but then GDB started to validate si_code
    and now it simply can't use breakpoints if the tracee has an active uprobe:
    
            # cat test.c
            void unused_func(void)
            {
            }
            int main(void)
            {
                    return 0;
            }
    
            # gcc -g test.c -o test
            # perf probe -x ./test -a unused_func
            # perf record -e probe_test:unused_func gdb ./test -ex run
            GNU gdb (GDB) 10.0.50.20200714-git

            (gdb)
    
    The tracee hits the internal breakpoint inserted by GDB to monitor shared
    library events but GDB misinterprets this SIGTRAP and reports a signal.
    
    Change handle_swbp() to use force_sig(SIGTRAP), this matches do_int3_user()
    and fixes the problem.
    
    This is the minimal fix for -stable, arch/x86/kernel/uprobes.c is equally
    wrong; it should use send_sigtrap(TRAP_TRACE) instead of send_sig(SIGTRAP),
    but this doesn't confuse GDB and needs another x86-specific patch.

    btrfs: reloc: clear DEAD_RELOC_TREE bit for orphan roots to prevent runaway balance
    
    commit 1dae7e0e58b484eaa43d530f211098fdeeb0f404 upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    There are several reported runaway balance, that balance is flooding the
    log with "found X extents" where the X never changes.
    
    [CAUSE]
    Commit d2311e698578 ("btrfs: relocation: Delay reloc tree deletion after
    merge_reloc_roots") introduced BTRFS_ROOT_DEAD_RELOC_TREE bit to
    indicate that one subvolume has finished its tree blocks swap with its
    reloc tree.
    
    However if balance is canceled or hits ENOSPC halfway, we didn't clear
    the BTRFS_ROOT_DEAD_RELOC_TREE bit, leaving that bit hanging forever
    until unmount.
    
    Any subvolume root with that bit, would cause backref cache to skip this
    tree block, as it has finished its tree block swap.  This would cause
    all tree blocks of that root be ignored by balance, leading to runaway
    balance.
    
    [FIX]
    Fix the problem by also clearing the BTRFS_ROOT_DEAD_RELOC_TREE bit for
    the original subvolume of orphan reloc root.
    
    Add an umount check for the stale bit still set.

    The fix is to clear fs_root->reloc_root and put it at

    commit 65caafd0d2145d1dd02072c4ced540624daeab40 upstream.
    
    Reverting commit d03727b248d0 "NFSv4 fix CLOSE not waiting for
    direct IO compeletion". This patch made it so that fput() by calling
    inode_dio_done() in nfs_file_release() would wait uninterruptably
    for any outstanding directIO to the file (but that wait on IO should
    be killable).
    
    The problem the patch was also trying to address was REMOVE returning
    ERR_ACCESS because the file is still opened, is supposed to be resolved
    by server returning ERR_FILE_OPEN and not ERR_ACCESS.

    dmabuf: use spinlock to access dmabuf->name
    
    [ Upstream commit 6348dd291e3653534a9e28e6917569bc9967b35b ]
    
    There exists a sleep-while-atomic bug while accessing the dmabuf->name
    under mutex in the dmabuffs_dname(). This is caused from the SELinux
    permissions checks on a process where it tries to validate the inherited
    files from fork() by traversing them through iterate_fd() (which
    traverse files under spin_lock) and call
    match_file(security/selinux/hooks.c) where the permission checks happen.
    This audit information is logged using dump_common_audit_data() where it
    calls d_path() to get the file path name. If the file check happen on
    the dmabuf's fd, then it ends up in ->dmabuffs_dname() and use mutex to
    access dmabuf->name. The flow will be like below:
    flush_unauthorized_files()
      iterate_fd()
        spin_lock() --> Start of the atomic section.
          match_file()
            file_has_perm()
              avc_has_perm()
                avc_audit()

                          d_path()
                            dmabuffs_dname()
                              mutex_lock()--> Sleep while atomic.

    irqdomain/treewide: Keep firmware node unconditionally allocated
    
    [ Upstream commit e3beca48a45b5e0e6e6a4e0124276b8248dcc9bb ]
    
    Quite some non OF/ACPI users of irqdomains allocate firmware nodes of type
    IRQCHIP_FWNODE_NAMED or IRQCHIP_FWNODE_NAMED_ID and free them right after
    creating the irqdomain. The only purpose of these FW nodes is to convey
    name information. When this was introduced the core code did not store the
    pointer to the node in the irqdomain. A recent change stored the firmware
    node pointer in irqdomain for other reasons and missed to notice that the
    usage sites which do the alloc_fwnode/create_domain/free_fwnode sequence
    are broken by this. Storing a dangling pointer is dangerous itself, but in
    case that the domain is destroyed later on this leads to a double free.
    
    Remove the freeing of the firmware node after creating the irqdomain from
    all affected call sites to cure this.

    on stack or inside a structure that doesn't come from the BIO allocator.
    Switch dm to use that instead of bio_disassociate_blkg, which really is
    an implementation detail.  Note that the bio_uninit calls are also moved
    to the two callers of __send_empty_flush, so that they better pair with
    the bio_init calls used to initialize them.

    scsi: mpt3sas: Fix error returns in BRM_status_show
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fd181456aa0826057adbfb6c79c40f4083cfd75 ]
    
    BRM_status_show() has several error branches, but none of them record the
    error in the error return.
    
    Also while at it remove the manual mutex_unlock() of the pci_access_mutex
    in case of an ongoing pci error recovery or host removal and jump to the
    cleanup label instead.
    
    Note: We can safely jump to out from here as io_unit_pg3 is initialized to
    NULL and if it hasn't been allocated, kfree() skips the NULL pointer.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi: fix failures at PCM open on Intel ICL and later
    
    [ Upstream commit 56275036d8185f92eceac7479d48b858ee3dab84 ]
    
    When HDMI PCM devices are opened in a specific order, with at least one
    HDMI/DP receiver connected, ALSA PCM open fails to -EBUSY on the
    connected monitor, on recent Intel platforms (ICL/JSL and newer). While
    this is not a typical sequence, at least Pulseaudio does this every time
    when it is started, to discover the available PCMs.
    
    The rootcause is an invalid assumption in hdmi_add_pin(), where the
    total number of converters is assumed to be known at the time the
    function is called. On older Intel platforms this held true, but after
    ICL/JSL, the order how pins and converters are in the subnode list as
    returned by snd_hda_get_sub_nodes(), was changed. As a result,
    information for some converters was not stored to per_pin->mux_nids.
    And this means some pins cannot be connected to all converters, and
    application instead gets -EBUSY instead at open.
    
    The assumption that converters are always before pins in the subnode
    list, is not really a valid one. Fix the problem in hdmi_parse_codec()
    by introducing separate loops for discovering converters and pins.

    drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Fixed the value of hard_header_len
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dc829a135fb5927f1519de11286e2bbb79f5b66 ]
    
    When this driver transmits data,
      first this driver will remove a pseudo header of 1 byte,
      then the lapb module will prepend the LAPB header of 2 or 3 bytes,
      then this driver will prepend a length field of 2 bytes,
      then the underlying Ethernet device will prepend its own header.
    
    So, the header length required should be:
      -1 + 3 + 2 + "the header length needed by the underlying device".
    
    This patch fixes kernel panic when this driver is used with AF_PACKET
    SOCK_DGRAM sockets.

    mac80211: allow rx of mesh eapol frames with default rx key
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b467b63870d9c05c81456aa9bfee894ab2db3b6 ]
    
    Without this patch, eapol frames cannot be received in mesh
    mode, when 802.1X should be used. Initially only a MGTK is
    defined, which is found and set as rx->key, when there are
    no other keys set. ieee80211_drop_unencrypted would then
    drop these eapol frames, as they are data frames without
    encryption and there exists some rx->key.
    
    Fix this by differentiating between mesh eapol frames and
    other data frames with existing rx->key. Allow mesh mesh
    eapol frames only if they are for our vif address.
    
    With this patch in-place, ieee80211_rx_h_mesh_fwding continues
    after the ieee80211_drop_unencrypted check and notices, that
    these eapol frames have to be delivered locally, as they should.

    soc: qcom: rpmh: Dirt can only make you dirtier, not cleaner
    
    commit 35bb4b22f606c0cc8eedf567313adc18161b1af4 upstream.
    
    Adding an item into the cache should never be able to make the cache
    cleaner.  Use "|=" rather than "=" to update the dirty flag.
