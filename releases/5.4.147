    Revert "posix-cpu-timers: Force next expiration recalc after itimer reset"
    
    This reverts commit c322a963d522e9a4273e18c9d7bd6fd40a25160f which is
    commit 406dd42bd1ba0c01babf9cde169bb319e52f6147 upstream.
    
    It is reported to cause regressions.  A proposed fix has been posted,
    but it is not in a released kernel yet.  So just revert this from the
    stable release so that the bug is fixed.  If it's really needed we can
    add it back in in a future release.
