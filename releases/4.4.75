    nvme: apply DELAY_BEFORE_CHK_RDY quirk at probe time too
    
    commit b5a10c5f7532b7473776da87e67f8301bbc32693 upstream.
    
    Commit 54adc01055b7 ("nvme/quirk: Add a delay before checking for adapter
    readiness") introduced a quirk to adapters that cannot read the bit
    NVME_CSTS_RDY right after register NVME_REG_CC is set; these adapters
    need a delay or else the action of reading the bit NVME_CSTS_RDY could
    somehow corrupt adapter's registers state and it never recovers.
    
    When this quirk was added, we checked ctrl->tagset in order to avoid
    quirking in probe time, supposing we would never require such delay
    during probe. Well, it was too optimistic; we in fact need this quirk
    at probe time in some cases, like after a kexec.
    
    In some experiments, after abnormal shutdown of machine (aka power cord
    unplug), we booted into our bootloader in Power, which is a Linux kernel,
    and kexec'ed into another distro. If this kexec is too quick, we end up
    reaching the probe of NVMe adapter in that distro when adapter is in
    bad state (not fully initialized on our bootloader). What happens next
    is that nvme_wait_ready() is unable to complete, except if the quirk is
    enabled.
    
    So, this patch removes the original ctrl->tagset verification in order
    to enable the quirk even on probe time.

    nvme/quirk: Add a delay before checking for adapter readiness
    
    commit 54adc01055b75ec8769c5a36574c7a0895c0c0b2 upstream.
    
    When disabling the controller, the specification says the register
    NVME_REG_CC should be written and then driver needs to wait the
    adapter to be ready, which is checked by reading another register
    bit (NVME_CSTS_RDY). There's a timeout validation in this checking,
    so in case this timeout is reached the driver gives up and removes
    the adapter from the system.
    
    After a firmware activation procedure, the PCI_DEVICE(0x1c58, 0x0003)
    (HGST adapter) end up being removed if we issue a reset_controller,
    because driver keeps verifying the NVME_REG_CSTS until the timeout is
    reached. This patch adds a necessary quirk for this adapter, by
    introducing a delay before nvme_wait_ready(), so the reset procedure
    is able to be completed. This quirk is needed because just increasing
    the timeout is not enough in case of this adapter - the driver must
    wait before start reading NVME_REG_CSTS register on this specific
    device.

    powerpc/slb: Force a full SLB flush when we insert for a bad EA
    
    [Note this patch is not upstream. The bug fix was fixed differently in
    upstream prior to the bug being identified.]
    
    The SLB miss handler calls slb_allocate_realmode() in order to create an
    SLB entry for the faulting address. At the very start of that function
    we check that the faulting Effective Address (EA) is less than
    PGTABLE_RANGE (ignoring the region), ie. is it an address which could
    possibly fit in the virtual address space.
    
    For an EA which fails that test, we branch out of line (to label 8), but
    we still go on to create an SLB entry for the address. The SLB entry we
    create has a VSID of 0, which means it will never match anything in the
    hash table and so can't actually translate to a physical address.
    
    However that SLB entry will be inserted in the SLB, and so needs to be
    managed properly like any other SLB entry. In particular we need to
    insert the SLB entry in the SLB cache, so that it will be flushed when
    the process is descheduled.
    
    And that is where the bugs begin. The first bug is that slb_finish_load()
    uses cr7 to decide if it should insert the SLB entry into the SLB cache.
    When we come from the invalid EA case we don't set cr7, it just has some
    junk value from userspace. So we may or may not insert the SLB entry in
    the SLB cache. If we fail to insert it, we may then incorrectly leave it
    in the SLB when the process is descheduled.
    
    The second bug is that even if we do happen to add the entry to the SLB
    cache, we do not have enough bits in the SLB cache to remember the full
    ESID value for very large EAs.
    
    For example if a process branches to 0x788c545a18000000, that results in
    a 256MB SLB entry with an ESID of 0x788c545a1. But each entry in the SLB
    cache is only 32-bits, meaning we truncate the ESID to 0x88c545a1. This
    has the same effect as the first bug, we incorrectly leave the SLB entry
    in the SLB when the process is descheduled.
    
    When a process accesses an invalid EA it results in a SEGV signal being
    sent to the process, which typically results in the process being
    killed. Process death isn't instantaneous however, the process may catch
    the SEGV signal and continue somehow, or the kernel may start writing a
    core dump for the process, either of which means it's possible for the
    process to be preempted while its processing the SEGV but before it's
    been killed.
    
    If that happens, when the process is scheduled back onto the CPU we will
    allocate a new SLB entry for the NIP, which will insert a second entry
    into the SLB for the bad EA. Because we never flushed the original
    entry, due to either bug one or two, we now have two SLB entries that
    match the same EA.
    
    If another access is made to that EA, either by the process continuing
    after catching the SEGV, or by a second process accessing the same bad
    EA on the same CPU, we will trigger an SLB multi-hit machine check
    exception. This has been observed happening in the wild.
    
    The fix is when we hit the invalid EA case, we mark the SLB cache as
    being full. This causes us to not insert the truncated ESID into the SLB
    cache, and means when the process is switched out we will flush the
    entire SLB. Note that this works both for the original fault and for a
    subsequent call to slb_allocate_realmode() from switch_slb().
    
    Because we mark the SLB cache as full, it doesn't really matter what
    value is in cr7, but rather than leaving it as something random we set
    it to indicate the address was a kernel address. That also skips the
    attempt to insert it in the SLB cache which is a nice side effect.
    
    Another way to fix the bug would be to make the entries in the SLB cache
    wider, so that we don't truncate the ESID. However this would be a more
    intrusive change as it alters the size and layout of the paca.
    
    This bug was fixed in upstream by commit f0f558b131db ("powerpc/mm:
    Preserve CFAR value on SLB miss caused by access to bogus address"),
    which changed the way we handle a bad EA entirely removing this bug in
    the process.

    mtd: spi-nor: fix spansion quad enable
    
    commit 807c16253319ee6ccf8873ae64f070f7eb532cd5 upstream.
    
    With the S25FL127S nor flash part, each writing to the configuration
    register takes hundreds of ms. During that  time, no more accesses to
    the flash should be done (even reads).
    
    This commit adds a wait loop after the register writing until the flash
    finishes its work.
    
    This issue could make rootfs mounting fail when the latter was done too
    much closely to this quad enable bit setting step. And in this case, a
    driver as UBIFS may try to recover the filesystem and may broke it
    completely.

    rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decode
    
    commit 5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2017-7482.
    
    When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an
    rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
    variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
    overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
    four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could
    lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
    over the end of the buffer.
    
    Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded
    length.

    iscsi-target: Reject immediate data underflow larger than SCSI transfer length
    
    commit abb85a9b512e8ca7ad04a5a8a6db9664fe644974 upstream.
    
    When iscsi WRITE underflow occurs there are two different scenarios
    that can happen.
    
    Normally in practice, when an EDTL vs. SCSI CDB TRANSFER LENGTH
    underflow is detected, the iscsi immediate data payload is the
    smaller SCSI CDB TRANSFER LENGTH.
    
    That is, when a host fabric LLD is using a fixed size EDTL for
    a specific control CDB, the SCSI CDB TRANSFER LENGTH and actual
    SCSI payload ends up being smaller than EDTL.  In iscsi, this
    means the received iscsi immediate data payload matches the
    smaller SCSI CDB TRANSFER LENGTH, because there is no more
    SCSI payload to accept beyond SCSI CDB TRANSFER LENGTH.
    
    However, it's possible for a malicous host to send a WRITE
    underflow where EDTL is larger than SCSI CDB TRANSFER LENGTH,
    but incoming iscsi immediate data actually matches EDTL.
    
    In the wild, we've never had a iscsi host environment actually
    try to do this.
    
    For this special case, it's wrong to truncate part of the
    control CDB payload and continue to process the command during
    underflow when immediate data payload received was larger than
    SCSI CDB TRANSFER LENGTH, so go ahead and reject and drop the
    bogus payload as a defensive action.
    
    Note this potential bug was originally relaxed by the following
    for allowing WRITE underflow in MSFT FCP host environments:

    target: Fix kref->refcount underflow in transport_cmd_finish_abort
    
    commit 73d4e580ccc5c3e05cea002f18111f66c9c07034 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a se_cmd->cmd_kref underflow during CMD_T_ABORTED
    when a fabric driver drops it's second reference from below the
    target_core_tmr.c based callers of transport_cmd_finish_abort().
    
    Recently with the conversion of kref to refcount_t, this bug was
    manifesting itself as:
    
    [705519.601034] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
    [705519.604034] INFO: NMI handler (kgdb_nmi_handler) took too long to run: 20116.512 msecs
    [705539.719111] ------------[ cut here ]------------
    [705539.719117] WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 26510 at lib/refcount.c:184 refcount_sub_and_test+0x33/0x51
    
    Since the original kref atomic_t based kref_put() didn't check for
    underflow and only invoked the final callback when zero was reached,
    this bug did not manifest in practice since all se_cmd memory is
    using preallocated tags.
    
    To address this, go ahead and propigate the existing return from
    transport_put_cmd() up via transport_cmd_finish_abort(), and
    change transport_cmd_finish_abort() + core_tmr_handle_tas_abort()
    callers to only do their local target_put_sess_cmd() if necessary.

    time: Fix clock->read(clock) race around clocksource changes
    
    commit ceea5e3771ed2378668455fa21861bead7504df5 upstream.
    
    In tests, which excercise switching of clocksources, a NULL
    pointer dereference can be observed on AMR64 platforms in the
    clocksource read() function:
    
    u64 clocksource_mmio_readl_down(struct clocksource *c)
    {
            return ~(u64)readl_relaxed(to_mmio_clksrc(c)->reg) & c->mask;
    }
    
    This is called from the core timekeeping code via:
    
            cycle_now = tkr->read(tkr->clock);
    
    tkr->read is the cached tkr->clock->read() function pointer.
    When the clocksource is changed then tkr->clock and tkr->read
    are updated sequentially. The code above results in a sequential
    load operation of tkr->read and tkr->clock as well.
    
    If the store to tkr->clock hits between the loads of tkr->read
    and tkr->clock, then the old read() function is called with the
    new clock pointer. As a consequence the read() function
    dereferences a different data structure and the resulting 'reg'
    pointer can point anywhere including NULL.
    
    This problem was introduced when the timekeeping code was
    switched over to use struct tk_read_base. Before that, it was
    theoretically possible as well when the compiler decided to
    reload clock in the code sequence:
    
         now = tk->clock->read(tk->clock);
    
    Add a helper function which avoids the issue by reading
    tk_read_base->clock once into a local variable clk and then issue
    the read function via clk->read(clk). This guarantees that the
    read() function always gets the proper clocksource pointer handed
    in.
    
    Since there is now no use for the tkr.read pointer, this patch
    also removes it, and to address stopping the fast timekeeper
    during suspend/resume, it introduces a dummy clocksource to use
    rather then just a dummy read function.

    powerpc/kprobes: Pause function_graph tracing during jprobes handling
    
    commit a9f8553e935f26cb5447f67e280946b0923cd2dc upstream.
    
    This fixes a crash when function_graph and jprobes are used together.
    This is essentially commit 237d28db036e ("ftrace/jprobes/x86: Fix
    conflict between jprobes and function graph tracing"), but for powerpc.
    
    Jprobes breaks function_graph tracing since the jprobe hook needs to use
    jprobe_return(), which never returns back to the hook, but instead to
    the original jprobe'd function. The solution is to momentarily pause
    function_graph tracing before invoking the jprobe hook and re-enable it
    when returning back to the original jprobe'd function.

    This problem has existed since the posix timer code was merged into
    2.5.63. A few releases earlier in 2.5.60 ptrace gained the ability to
    inject not just a signal (which linux has supported since 1.0) but the
    full siginfo of a signal.
    
    The core problem is that the code will reschedule in response to
    signals getting dequeued not just for signals the timers sent but
    for other signals that happen to a si_code of SI_TIMER.
    
    Avoid this confusion by testing to see if the queued signal was
    preallocated as all timer signals are preallocated, and so far
    only the timer code preallocates signals.
    
    Move the check for if a timer needs to be rescheduled up into
    collect_signal where the preallocation check must be performed,
    and pass the result back to dequeue_signal where the code reschedules
    timers.   This makes it clear why the code cares about preallocated
    timers.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Preserve userspace HTM state properly
    
    commit 46a704f8409f79fd66567ad3f8a7304830a84293 upstream.
    
    If userspace attempts to call the KVM_RUN ioctl when it has hardware
    transactional memory (HTM) enabled, the values that it has put in the
    HTM-related SPRs TFHAR, TFIAR and TEXASR will get overwritten by
    guest values.  To fix this, we detect this condition and save those
    SPR values in the thread struct, and disable HTM for the task.  If
    userspace goes to access those SPRs or the HTM facility in future,
    a TM-unavailable interrupt will occur and the handler will reload
    those SPRs and re-enable HTM.
    
    If userspace has started a transaction and suspended it, we would
    currently lose the transactional state in the guest entry path and
    would almost certainly get a "TM Bad Thing" interrupt, which would
    cause the host to crash.  To avoid this, we detect this case and
    return from the KVM_RUN ioctl with an EINVAL error, with the KVM
    exit reason set to KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY.

    fs/exec.c: account for argv/envp pointers
    
    commit 98da7d08850fb8bdeb395d6368ed15753304aa0c upstream.
    
    When limiting the argv/envp strings during exec to 1/4 of the stack limit,
    the storage of the pointers to the strings was not included.  This means
    that an exec with huge numbers of tiny strings could eat 1/4 of the stack
    limit in strings and then additional space would be later used by the
    pointers to the strings.
    
    For example, on 32-bit with a 8MB stack rlimit, an exec with 1677721
    single-byte strings would consume less than 2MB of stack, the max (8MB /
    4) amount allowed, but the pointers to the strings would consume the
    remaining additional stack space (1677721 * 4 == 6710884).
    
    The result (1677721 + 6710884 == 8388605) would exhaust stack space
    entirely.  Controlling this stack exhaustion could result in
    pathological behavior in setuid binaries (CVE-2017-1000365).
