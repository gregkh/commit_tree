    arm64: dts: ls1046ardb: set RGMII interfaces to RGMII_ID mode
    
    commit d79e9d7c1e4ba5f95f2ff3541880c40ea9722212 upstream.
    
    The correct setting for the RGMII ports on LS1046ARDB is to
    enable delay on both Rx and Tx so the interface mode used must
    be PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.
    
    Since commit 1b3047b5208a80 ("net: phy: realtek: add support for
    configuring the RX delay on RTL8211F") the Realtek 8211F PHY driver
    has control over the RGMII RX delay and it is disabling it for
    RGMII_TXID. The LS1046ARDB uses two such PHYs in RGMII_ID mode but
    in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii".
    
    Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.

    arm64: dts: ls1043a-rdb: correct RGMII delay mode to rgmii-id
    
    commit 4022d808c45277693ea86478fab1f081ebf997e8 upstream.
    
    The correct setting for the RGMII ports on LS1043ARDB is to

    in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii_txid".
    This issue was not apparent at the time as the PHY driver took the
    same action for RGMII_TXID and RGMII_ID back then but it became
    visible (RX no longer working) after the above patch.
    
    Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.

    perf map: Fix off by one in strncpy() size argument
    
    commit db2c549407d4a76563c579e4768f7d6d32afefba upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
    tools/perf/util/map.c. The issue is that in:
    
            strncmp(filename, "/system/lib/", 11)
    
    the passed string literal: "/system/lib/" has 12 bytes (without the NULL
    byte) and the passed size argument is 11. As a result, the logic won't
    match the ending "/" byte and will pass filepaths that are stored in
    other directories e.g. "/system/libmalicious/bin" or just
    "/system/libmalicious".
    
    This functionality seems to be present only on Android. I assume the
    /system/ directory is only writable by the root user, so I don't think
    this bug has much (or any) security impact.

    arm64: alternative: fix build with clang integrated assembler
    
    commit 6f5459da2b8736720afdbd67c4bd2d1edba7d0e3 upstream.
    
    Building an arm64 defconfig with clang's integrated assembler, this error

    While GNU as seems fine with case-sensitive macro instantiations, clang
    doesn't, so use the actual macro name (_asm_extable) as in the rest of
    the file.
    
    Also checked that the generated assembly matches the GCC output.

    libceph: fix alloc_msg_with_page_vector() memory leaks
    
    commit e886274031200bb60965c1b9c49b7acda56a93bd upstream.
    
    Make it so that CEPH_MSG_DATA_PAGES data item can own pages,
    fixing a bunch of memory leaks for a page vector allocated in
    alloc_msg_with_page_vector().  Currently, only watch-notify
    messages trigger this allocation, and normally the page vector
    is freed either in handle_watch_notify() or by the caller of
    ceph_osdc_notify().  But if the message is freed before that
    (e.g. if the session faults while reading in the message or
    if the notify is stale), we leak the page vector.
    
    This was supposed to be fixed by switching to a message-owned
    pagelist, but that never happened.

    net: ks8851-ml: Fix IO operations, again
    
    commit 8262e6f9b1034ede34548a04dec4c302d92c9497 upstream.
    
    This patch reverts 58292104832f ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit IO operation")
    and edacb098ea9c ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit data access"), because it
    turns out these were only necessary due to buggy hardware. This patch adds
    a check for such a buggy hardware to prevent any such mistakes again.
    
    While working further on the KS8851 driver, it came to light that the
    KS8851-16MLL is capable of switching bus endianness by a hardware strap,
    EESK pin. If this strap is incorrect, the IO accesses require such endian
    swapping as is being reverted by this patch. Such swapping also impacts
    the performance significantly.
    
    Hence, in addition to removing it, detect that the hardware is broken,
    report to user, and fail to bind with such hardware.

    gpiolib: acpi: Add quirk to ignore EC wakeups on HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288 model
    
    commit 0c625ccfe6f754d0896b8881f5c85bcb81699f1f upstream.
    
    There are at least 3 models of the HP x2 10 models:
    
    Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
    
    Like on the other HP x2 10 models we need to ignore wakeup for ACPI GPIO
    events on the external embedded-controller pin to avoid spurious wakeups
    on the HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288 model too.
    
    This commit adds an extra DMI based quirk for the HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288
    model, ignoring wakeups for ACPI GPIO events on the EC interrupt pin
    on this model. This fixes spurious wakeups from suspend on this model.

    commit 5c6f25887963f15492b604dd25cb149c501bbabf upstream.
    
    Trying to initialize a structure with "= {};" will not always clean out
    all padding locations in a structure. So be explicit and call memset to
    initialize everything for a number of bpf information structures that
    are then copied from userspace, sometimes from smaller memory locations
    than the size of the structure.

    bpf: Explicitly memset the bpf_attr structure
    
    commit 8096f229421f7b22433775e928d506f0342e5907 upstream.
    
    For the bpf syscall, we are relying on the compiler to properly zero out
    the bpf_attr union that we copy userspace data into. Unfortunately that
    doesn't always work properly, padding and other oddities might not be
    correctly zeroed, and in some tests odd things have been found when the
    stack is pre-initialized to other values.
    
    Fix this by explicitly memsetting the structure to 0 before using it.

    The Lex 2I385SW board has two Intel I211 ethernet controllers. Without
    this patch, only the first port is usable. The second port fails to
    start with the following message:

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix use-after-free in vt_in_use()
    
    commit 7cf64b18b0b96e751178b8d0505d8466ff5a448f upstream.
    
    vt_in_use() dereferences console_driver->ttys[i] without proper locking.
    This is broken because the tty can be closed and freed concurrently.
    
    We could fix this by using 'READ_ONCE(console_driver->ttys[i]) != NULL'
    and skipping the check of tty_struct::count.  But, looking at
    console_driver->ttys[i] isn't really appropriate anyway because even if
    it is NULL the tty can still be in the process of being closed.
    
    Instead, fix it by making vt_in_use() require console_lock() and check
    whether the vt is allocated and has port refcount > 1.  This works since
    following the patch "vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use
    virtual console" the port refcount is incremented while the vt is open.
    
    Reproducer (very unreliable, but it worked for me after a few minutes):
    
            #include <fcntl.h>
            #include <linux/vt.h>

                    char ttyname[16];
    
                    fd = open("/dev/tty10", O_RDONLY);

                            fork();
                    for (;;) {
                            sprintf(ttyname, "/dev/tty%d", rand() % 8);
                            close(open(ttyname, O_RDONLY));

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use virtual console
    
    commit ca4463bf8438b403596edd0ec961ca0d4fbe0220 upstream.
    
    The VT_DISALLOCATE ioctl can free a virtual console while tty_release()
    is still running, causing a use-after-free in con_shutdown().  This
    occurs because VT_DISALLOCATE considers a virtual console's
    'struct vc_data' to be unused as soon as the corresponding tty's
    refcount hits 0.  But actually it may be still being closed.
    
    Fix this by making vc_data be reference-counted via the embedded
    'struct tty_port'.  A newly allocated virtual console has refcount 1.
    Opening it for the first time increments the refcount to 2.  Closing it
    for the last time decrements the refcount (in tty_operations::cleanup()
    so that it happens late enough), as does VT_DISALLOCATE.
    
    Reproducer:
            #include <fcntl.h>
            #include <linux/vt.h>
            #include <sys/ioctl.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
    
            int main()
            {
                    if (fork()) {

                                    close(open("/dev/tty5", O_RDWR));
                    } else {
                            int fd = open("/dev/tty10", O_RDWR);
    
                            for (;;)
                                    ioctl(fd, VT_DISALLOCATE, 5);

    vt: vt_ioctl: remove unnecessary console allocation checks
    
    commit 1aa6e058dd6cd04471b1f21298270014daf48ac9 upstream.
    
    The vc_cons_allocated() checks in vt_ioctl() and vt_compat_ioctl() are
    unnecessary because they can only be reached by calling ioctl() on an
    open tty, which implies the corresponding virtual console is allocated.
    
    And even if the virtual console *could* be freed concurrently, then
    these checks would be broken since they aren't done under console_lock,
    and the vc_data is dereferenced before them anyway.
    
    So, remove these unneeded checks to avoid confusion.

    mac80211 used to check port authorization in the Data frame enqueue case
    when going through start_xmit(). However, that authorization status may
    change while the frame is waiting in a queue. Add a similar check in the
    dequeue case to avoid sending previously accepted frames after
    authorization change. This provides additional protection against
    potential leaking of frames after a station has been disconnected and
    the keys for it are being removed.
