    Btrfs: use nofs context when initializing security xattrs to avoid deadlock
    
    commit 827aa18e7b903c5ff3b3cd8fec328a99b1dbd411 upstream.
    
    When initializing the security xattrs, we are holding a transaction handle
    therefore we need to use a GFP_NOFS context in order to avoid a deadlock
    with reclaim in case it's triggered.

    Btrfs: fix deadlock when enabling quotas due to concurrent snapshot creation
    
    commit 9a6f209e36500efac51528132a3e3083586eda5f upstream.
    
    If the quota enable and snapshot creation ioctls are called concurrently
    we can get into a deadlock where the task enabling quotas will deadlock
    on the fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock mutex because it attempts to lock it
    twice, or the task creating a snapshot tries to commit the transaction
    while the task enabling quota waits for the former task to commit the
    transaction while holding the mutex. The following time diagrams show how
    both cases happen.
    
    First scenario:
    
               CPU 0                                    CPU 1

       btrfs_quota_enable()
        mutex_lock(fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock)
        btrfs_start_transaction()
    
                                                 btrfs_ioctl()

                                                   create_snapshot()
                                                    --> adds snapshot to the
                                                        list pending_snapshots
                                                        of the current
                                                        transaction

                    by this task at
                    btrfs_quota_enable()
    
    Second scenario:
    
               CPU 0                                    CPU 1
    
     btrfs_ioctl()
      btrfs_ioctl_quota_ctl()
       btrfs_quota_enable()
        mutex_lock(fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock)
        btrfs_start_transaction()
    
                                                 btrfs_ioctl()
                                                  btrfs_ioctl_snap_create_v2

    So fix this by setting the quota enabled flag in fs_info after committing
    the transaction at btrfs_quota_enable(). This ends up serializing quota
    enable and snapshot creation as if the snapshot creation happened just
    before the quota enable request. The quota rescan task, scheduled after
    committing the transaction in btrfs_quote_enable(), will do the accounting.

    Btrfs: fix access to available allocation bits when starting balance
    
    commit 5a8067c0d17feb7579db0476191417b441a8996e upstream.
    
    The available allocation bits members from struct btrfs_fs_info are
    protected by a sequence lock, and when starting balance we access them
    incorrectly in two different ways:
    
    1) In the read sequence lock loop at btrfs_balance() we use the values we
       read from fs_info->avail_*_alloc_bits and we can immediately do actions
       that have side effects and can not be undone (printing a message and
       jumping to a label). This is wrong because a retry might be needed, so
       our actions must not have side effects and must be repeatable as long
       as read_seqretry() returns a non-zero value. In other words, we were
       essentially ignoring the sequence lock;
    
    2) Right below the read sequence lock loop, we were reading the values
       from avail_metadata_alloc_bits and avail_data_alloc_bits without any
       protection from concurrent writers, that is, reading them outside of
       the read sequence lock critical section.
    
    So fix this by making sure we only read the available allocation bits
    while in a read sequence lock critical section and that what we do in the
    critical section is repeatable (has nothing that can not be undone) so
    that any eventual retry that is needed is handled properly.

    sunrpc: use-after-free in svc_process_common()
    
    commit d4b09acf924b84bae77cad090a9d108e70b43643 upstream.
    
    if node have NFSv41+ mounts inside several net namespaces
    it can lead to use-after-free in svc_process_common()
    
    svc_process_common()
            /* Setup reply header */
            rqstp->rq_xprt->xpt_ops->xpo_prep_reply_hdr(rqstp); <<< HERE
    
    svc_process_common() can use incorrect rqstp->rq_xprt,
    its caller function bc_svc_process() takes it from serv->sv_bc_xprt.
    The problem is that serv is global structure but sv_bc_xprt
    is assigned per-netnamespace.
    
    According to Trond, the whole "let's set up rqstp->rq_xprt
    for the back channel" is nothing but a giant hack in order
    to work around the fact that svc_process_common() uses it
    to find the xpt_ops, and perform a couple of (meaningless
    for the back channel) tests of xpt_flags.
    
    All we really need in svc_process_common() is to be able to run
    rqstp->rq_xprt->xpt_ops->xpo_prep_reply_hdr()
    
    Bruce J Fields points that this xpo_prep_reply_hdr() call
    is an awfully roundabout way just to do "svc_putnl(resv, 0);"
    in the tcp case.
    
    This patch does not initialiuze rqstp->rq_xprt in bc_svc_process(),
    now it calls svc_process_common() with rqstp->rq_xprt = NULL.
    
    To adjust reply header svc_process_common() just check
    rqstp->rq_prot and calls svc_tcp_prep_reply_hdr() for tcp case.
    
    To handle rqstp->rq_xprt = NULL case in functions called from
    svc_process_common() patch intruduces net namespace pointer
    svc_rqst->rq_bc_net and adjust SVC_NET() definition.
    Some other function was also adopted to properly handle described case.

    mm: page_mapped: don't assume compound page is huge or THP
    
    commit 8ab88c7169b7fba98812ead6524b9d05bc76cf00 upstream.
    
    LTP proc01 testcase has been observed to rarely trigger crashes
    on arm64:
        page_mapped+0x78/0xb4
        stable_page_flags+0x27c/0x338
        kpageflags_read+0xfc/0x164
        proc_reg_read+0x7c/0xb8
        __vfs_read+0x58/0x178
        vfs_read+0x90/0x14c
        SyS_read+0x60/0xc0
    
    The issue is that page_mapped() assumes that if compound page is not
    huge, then it must be THP.  But if this is 'normal' compound page
    (COMPOUND_PAGE_DTOR), then following loop can keep running (for
    HPAGE_PMD_NR iterations) until it tries to read from memory that isn't
    mapped and triggers a panic:
    
            for (i = 0; i < hpage_nr_pages(page); i++) {
                    if (atomic_read(&page[i]._mapcount) >= 0)
                            return true;
            }
    
    I could replicate this on x86 (v4.20-rc4-98-g60b548237fed) only
    with a custom kernel module [1] which:
     - allocates compound page (PAGEC) of order 1
     - allocates 2 normal pages (COPY), which are initialized to 0xff (to
       satisfy _mapcount >= 0)
     - 2 PAGEC page structs are copied to address of first COPY page
     - second page of COPY is marked as not present
     - call to page_mapped(COPY) now triggers fault on access to 2nd COPY
       page at offset 0x30 (_mapcount)
    
    [1] https://github.com/jstancek/reproducers/blob/master/kernel/page_mapped_crash/repro.c
    
    Fix the loop to iterate for "1 << compound_order" pages.
    
    Kirrill said "IIRC, sound subsystem can producuce custom mapped compound
    pages".

    In no-journal mode, we previously used __generic_file_fsync() in
    no-journal mode.  This triggers a lockdep warning, and in addition,
    it's not safe to depend on the inode writeback mechanism in the case
    ext4.  We can solve both problems by calling ext4_write_inode()
    directly.

    ext4: avoid kernel warning when writing the superblock to a dead device
    
    commit e86807862e6880809f191c4cea7f88a489f0ed34 upstream.
    
    The xfstests generic/475 test switches the underlying device with
    dm-error while running a stress test.  This results in a large number
    of file system errors, and since we can't lock the buffer head when
    marking the superblock dirty in the ext4_grp_locked_error() case, it's
    possible the superblock to be !buffer_uptodate() without
    buffer_write_io_error() being true.
    
    We need to set buffer_uptodate() before we call mark_buffer_dirty() or
    this will trigger a WARN_ON.  It's safe to do this since the
    superblock must have been properly read into memory or the mount would
    have been successful.  So if buffer_uptodate() is not set, we can
    safely assume that this happened due to a failed attempt to write the
    superblock.

    ext4: fix a potential fiemap/page fault deadlock w/ inline_data
    
    commit 2b08b1f12cd664dc7d5c84ead9ff25ae97ad5491 upstream.
    
    The ext4_inline_data_fiemap() function calls fiemap_fill_next_extent()
    while still holding the xattr semaphore.  This is not necessary and it
    triggers a circular lockdep warning.  This is because
    fiemap_fill_next_extent() could trigger a page fault when it writes
    into page which triggers a page fault.  If that page is mmaped from
    the inline file in question, this could very well result in a
    deadlock.
    
    This problem can be reproduced using generic/519 with a file system
    configuration which has the inline_data feature enabled.

    ext4: make sure enough credits are reserved for dioread_nolock writes
    
    commit 812c0cab2c0dfad977605dbadf9148490ca5d93f upstream.
    
    There are enough credits reserved for most dioread_nolock writes;
    however, if the extent tree is sufficiently deep, and/or quota is
    enabled, the code was not allowing for all eventualities when
    reserving journal credits for the unwritten extent conversion.
    
    This problem can be seen using xfstests ext4/034:

    rbd: don't return 0 on unmap if RBD_DEV_FLAG_REMOVING is set
    
    commit 85f5a4d666fd9be73856ed16bb36c5af5b406b29 upstream.
    
    There is a window between when RBD_DEV_FLAG_REMOVING is set and when
    the device is removed from rbd_dev_list.  During this window, we set
    "already" and return 0.
    
    Returning 0 from write(2) can confuse userspace tools because
    0 indicates that nothing was written.  In particular, "rbd unmap"
    will retry the write multiple times a second:
    
      10:28:05.463299 write(4, "0", 1)        = 0
      10:28:05.463509 write(4, "0", 1)        = 0
      10:28:05.463720 write(4, "0", 1)        = 0
      10:28:05.463942 write(4, "0", 1)        = 0
      10:28:05.464155 write(4, "0", 1)        = 0

    drm/amdgpu: Don't fail resume process if resuming atomic state fails
    
    commit 2d1af6a11cb9d88e0e3dd10258904c437fe1b315 upstream.
    
    This is an ugly one unfortunately. Currently, all DRM drivers supporting
    atomic modesetting will save the state that userspace had set before
    suspending, then attempt to restore that state on resume. This probably
    worked very well at one point, like many other things, until DP MST came
    into the picture. While it's easy to restore state on normal display
    connectors that were disconnected during suspend regardless of their
    state post-resume, this can't really be done with MST because of the
    fact that setting up a downstream sink requires performing sideband
    transactions between the source and the MST hub, sending out the ACT
    packets, etc.
    
    Because of this, there isn't really a guarantee that we can restore the
    atomic state we had before suspend once we've resumed. This sucks pretty
    bad, but so far I haven't run into any compositors that this actually
    causes serious issues with. Most compositors will notice the hotplug we
    send afterwards, and then reprobe state.
    
    Since nouveau and i915 also don't fail the suspend/resume process due to
    failing to restore the atomic state, let's make amdgpu match this
    behavior. Better to resume the GPU properly, then to stop the process
    half way because of a potentially unavoidable atomic commit failure.
    
    Eventually, we'll have a real fix for this problem on the DRM level. But
    we've got some more important low-hanging fruit to deal with first.

    drm/amdgpu: Don't ignore rc from drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_resume()
    
    commit fe7553bef8d676d1d8b40666868b33ec39b9df5d upstream.
    
    drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_resume() returns whether or not it managed to
    find the topology in question after a suspend resume cycle, and the
    driver is supposed to check this value and disable MST accordingly if
    it's gone-in addition to sending a hotplug in order to notify userspace
    that something changed during suspend.
    
    Currently, amdgpu just makes the mistake of ignoring the return code
    from drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_resume() which means that if a topology was
    removed in suspend, amdgpu never notices and assumes it's still
    connected which leads to all sorts of problems.
    
    So, fix this by actually checking the rc from
    drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_resume(). Also, reformat the rest of the
    function while we're at it to fix the over-indenting.

    drm/fb-helper: Partially bring back workaround for bugs of SDL 1.2
    
    commit 62d85b3bf9d978ed4b6b2aeef5cf0ccf1423906e upstream.
    
    SDL 1.2 sets all fields related to the pixel format to zero in some
    cases[1]. Prior to commit db05c48197759 ("drm: fb-helper: Reject all
    pixel format changing requests"), there was an unintentional workaround
    for this that existed for more than a decade. First in device-specific DRM
    drivers, then here in drm_fb_helper.c.
    
    Previous code containing this workaround just ignores pixel format fields
    from userspace code. Not a good thing either, as this way, driver may
    silently use pixel format different from what client actually requested,
    and this in turn will lead to displaying garbage on the screen. I think
    that returning EINVAL to userspace in this particular case is the right
    option, so I decided to left code from problematic commit untouched
    instead of just reverting it entirely.
    
    Here is the steps required to reproduce this problem exactly:
            1) Compile fceux[2] with SDL 1.2.15 and without GTK or OpenGL
               support. SDL should be compiled with fbdev support (which is
               on by default).
            2) Create /etc/fb.modes with following contents (values seems
               not used, and just required to trigger problematic code in
               SDL):
    
                    mode "test"
                        geometry 1 1 1 1 1
                        timings 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
                    endmode
    
            3) Create ~/.fceux/fceux.cfg with following contents:
    
                    SDL.Hotkeys.Quit = 27
                    SDL.DoubleBuffering = 1
    
            4) Ensure that screen resolution is at least 1280x960 (e.g.
               append "video=Virtual-1:1280x960-32" to the kernel cmdline
               for qemu/QXL).
    
            5) Try to run fceux on VT with some ROM file[3]:
    
                    # ./fceux color_test.nes
    
    [1] SDL 1.2.15 source code, src/video/fbcon/SDL_fbvideo.c,
        FB_SetVideoMode()
    [2] http://www.fceux.com
    [3] Example ROM: https://github.com/bokuweb/rustynes/blob/master/roms/color_test.nes

    Bizarrely, there is no lock taken in the irq_ack() helper. This
    puts the ACK callback provided by a specific platform in a awkward
    situation where there is no synchronization that would be expected
    on other callback.
    
    Introduce the required lock, giving some level of uniformity among
    callbacks.

    PCI: dwc: Use interrupt masking instead of disabling
    
    commit 830920e065e90db318a0da98bf13a02b641eae7f upstream.
    
    The dwc driver is showing an interesting level of brokeness, as it
    insists on using the enable/disable set of registers to mask/unmask
    MSIs, meaning that an MSIs being generated while the interrupt is in
    that "disabled" state will simply be lost.
    
    Let's move to the mask/unmask set of registers, which offers the
    expected semantics.

    mtd: rawnand: qcom: fix memory corruption that causes panic
    
    commit 81d9bdf59092e4755fc4307c93c4589ef0fe2e0f upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a memory corruption that occurred in the
    qcom-nandc driver since it was converted to nand_scan().
    
    On boot, an affected device will panic from a NPE at a weird place:
    | Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0
    | pgd = (ptrval)
    | [00000000] *pgd=00000000

    | [<c059d274>] (qcom_nandc_probe) from [<c0567f00>]
    
    The problem is that the nand_scan()'s qcom_nand_attach_chip callback
    is updating the nandc->max_cwperpage from 1 to 4. This causes the
    sg_init_table of clear_bam_transaction() in the driver's
    qcom_nandc_block_bad() to memset much more than what was initially
    allocated by alloc_bam_transaction().
    
    This patch restores the old behavior by reallocating the shared bam
    transaction alloc_bam_transaction() after the chip was identified,
    but before mtd_device_parse_register() (which is an alias for
    mtd_device_register() - see panic) gets called. This fixes the
    corruption and the driver is working again.

    i2c: dev: prevent adapter retries and timeout being set as minus value
    
    commit 6ebec961d59bccf65d08b13fc1ad4e6272a89338 upstream.
    
    If adapter->retries is set to a minus value from user space via ioctl,
    it will make __i2c_transfer and __i2c_smbus_xfer skip the calling to
    adapter->algo->master_xfer and adapter->algo->smbus_xfer that is
    registered by the underlying bus drivers, and return value 0 to all the
    callers. The bus driver will never be accessed anymore by all users,
    besides, the users may still get successful return value without any
    error or information log print out.
    
    If adapter->timeout is set to minus value from user space via ioctl,
    it will make the retrying loop in __i2c_transfer and __i2c_smbus_xfer
    always break after the the first try, due to the time_after always
    returns true.

    commit c7777236dd8f587f6a8d6800c03df318fd4d2627 upstream.
    
    When executed for a PCI_ROOT_COMPLEX type, iort_match_node_callback()
    expects the opaque pointer argument to be a PCI bus device. At the
    moment rc_dma_get_range() passes the PCI endpoint instead of the bus,
    and we've been lucky to have pci_domain_nr(ptr) return 0 instead of
    crashing. Pass the bus device to iort_scan_node().

    ACPI / PMIC: xpower: Fix TS-pin current-source handling
    
    commit 2b531d71595d2b5b12782a49b23c335869e2621e upstream.
    
    The current-source used for the battery temp-sensor (TS) is shared with the
    GPADC. For proper fuel-gauge and charger operation the TS current-source
    needs to be permanently on. But to read the GPADC we need to temporary
    switch the TS current-source to ondemand, so that the GPADC can use it,
    otherwise we will always read an all 0 value.
    
    The switching from on to on-ondemand is not necessary when the TS
    current-source is off (this happens on devices which do not have a TS).
    
    Prior to this commit there were 2 issues with our handling of the TS
    current-source switching:
    
     1) We were writing hardcoded values to the ADC TS pin-ctrl register,
     overwriting various other unrelated bits. Specifically we were overwriting
     the current-source setting for the TS and GPIO0 pins, forcing it to 80ųA
     independent of its original setting. On a Chuwi Vi10 tablet this was
     causing us to get a too high adc value (due to a too high current-source)
     resulting in acpi_lpat_raw_to_temp() returning -ENOENT, resulting in:
    
    ACPI Error: AE_ERROR, Returned by Handler for [UserDefinedRegion]
    ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed \_SB.SXP1._TMP, AE_ERROR
    
    This commit fixes this by using regmap_update_bits to change only the
    relevant bits.
    
     2) At the end of intel_xpower_pmic_get_raw_temp() we were unconditionally
     enabling the TS current-source even on devices where the TS-pin is not used
     and the current-source thus was off on entry of the function.
    
    This commit fixes this by checking if the TS current-source is off when
    entering intel_xpower_pmic_get_raw_temp() and if so it is left as is.

    ACPI: power: Skip duplicate power resource references in _PRx
    
    commit 7d7b467cb95bf29597b417d4990160d4ea6d69b9 upstream.
    
    Some ACPI tables contain duplicate power resource references like this:
    
            Name (_PR0, Package (0x04)  // _PR0: Power Resources for D0
            {
                P28P,
                P18P,
                P18P,
                CLK4
            })
    
    This causes a WARN_ON in sysfs_add_link_to_group() because we end up
    adding a link to the same acpi_device twice:
    
    sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00/808622C1:00/OVTI2680:00/power_resources_D0/LNXPOWER:0a'

    He adds
     "task1 is waiting for the PageWriteback bit of the page that task2 has
      collected in mpd->io_submit->io_bio, and tasks2 is waiting for the
      LOCKED bit the page which tasks1 has locked"
    
    More precisely task1 is handling a page fault and it has a page locked
    while it charges a new page table to a memcg.  That in turn hits a
    memory limit reclaim and the memcg reclaim for legacy controller is
    waiting on the writeback but that is never going to finish because the
    writeback itself is waiting for the page locked in the #PF path.  So
    this is essentially ABBA deadlock:
    
                                            lock_page(A)
                                            SetPageWriteback(A)
                                            unlock_page(A)
      lock_page(B)
                                            lock_page(B)
      pte_alloc_pne
        shrink_page_list
          wait_on_page_writeback(A)
                                            SetPageWriteback(B)
                                            unlock_page(B)
    
                                            # flush A, B to clear the writeback
    
    This accumulating of more pages to flush is used by several filesystems
    to generate a more optimal IO patterns.
    
    Waiting for the writeback in legacy memcg controller is a workaround for
    pre-mature OOM killer invocations because there is no dirty IO
    throttling available for the controller.  There is no easy way around
    that unfortunately.  Therefore fix this specific issue by pre-allocating
    the page table outside of the page lock.  We have that handy
    infrastructure for that already so simply reuse the fault-around pattern
    which already does this.
    
    There are probably other hidden __GFP_ACCOUNT | GFP_KERNEL allocations
    from under a fs page locked but they should be really rare.  I am not
    aware of a better solution unfortunately.

    mm/usercopy.c: no check page span for stack objects
    
    commit 7bff3c06997374fb9b9991536a547b840549a813 upstream.
    
    It is easy to trigger this with CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY_PAGESPAN=y,
    
      usercopy: Kernel memory overwrite attempt detected to spans multiple pages (offset 0, size 23)!
      kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102!
    
    For example,
    
    print_worker_info
    char name[WQ_NAME_LEN] = { };
    char desc[WORKER_DESC_LEN] = { };
      probe_kernel_read(name, wq->name, sizeof(name) - 1);
      probe_kernel_read(desc, worker->desc, sizeof(desc) - 1);
        __copy_from_user_inatomic
          check_object_size
            check_heap_object
              check_page_span
    
    This is because on-stack variables could cross PAGE_SIZE boundary, and
    failed this check,
    
    if (likely(((unsigned long)ptr & (unsigned long)PAGE_MASK) ==
               ((unsigned long)end & (unsigned long)PAGE_MASK)))
    
    ptr = FFFF889007D7EFF8
    end = FFFF889007D7F00E
    
    Hence, fix it by checking if it is a stack object first.

    fork, memcg: fix cached_stacks case
    
    commit ba4a45746c362b665e245c50b870615f02f34781 upstream.
    
    Commit 5eed6f1dff87 ("fork,memcg: fix crash in free_thread_stack on
    memcg charge fail") fixes a crash caused due to failed memcg charge of
    the kernel stack.  However the fix misses the cached_stacks case which
    this patch fixes.  So, the same crash can happen if the memcg charge of
    a cached stack is failed.

    USB: Add USB_QUIRK_DELAY_CTRL_MSG quirk for Corsair K70 RGB
    
    commit 3483254b89438e60f719937376c5e0ce2bc46761 upstream.
    
    To match the Corsair Strafe RGB, the Corsair K70 RGB also requires
    USB_QUIRK_DELAY_CTRL_MSG to completely resolve boot connection issues
    discussed here: https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/issues/42.
    Otherwise roughly 1 in 10 boots the keyboard will fail to be detected.
    
    Patch that applied delay control quirk for Corsair Strafe RGB:

    The SMI SM3350 USB-UFS bridge controller cannot handle long sense request

    commit c5603d2fdb424849360fe7e3f8c1befc97571b8c upstream.
    
    Currently the code will set US_FL_SANE_SENSE flag unconditionally if
    device claims SPC3+, however we should allow US_FL_BAD_SENSE flag to
    prevent this behavior, because SMI SM3350 UFS-USB bridge controller,
    which claims SPC4, will show strange behavior with 96-byte sense
    (put the chip into a wrong state that cannot read/write anything).
    
    Check the presence of US_FL_BAD_SENSE when assuming US_FL_SANE_SENSE on
    SPC4+ devices.

    cifs: check kzalloc return
    
    commit 0544b324e62c177c3a9e9c3bdce22e6db9f34588 upstream.
    
    kzalloc can return NULL so an additional check is needed. While there
    is a check for ret_buf there is no check for the allocation of
    ret_buf->crfid.fid - this check is thus added. Both call-sites
    of tconInfoAlloc() check for NULL return of tconInfoAlloc()
    so returning NULL on failure of kzalloc() here seems appropriate.
    As the kzalloc() is the only thing here that can fail it is
    moved to the beginning so as not to initialize other resources
    on failure of kzalloc.

    commit 8544f4aa9dd19a04d1244dae10feecc813ccf175 upstream.
    
    In SMB3 protocol every part of the compound chain consumes credits
    individually, so we need to call wait_for_free_credits() for each
    of the PDUs in the chain. If an operation is interrupted, we must
    ensure we return all credits taken from the server structure back.
    
    Without this patch server can sometimes disconnect the session
    due to credit mismatches, especially when first operation(s)
    are large writes.

    commit b983f7e92348d7e7d091db1b78b7915e9dd3d63a upstream.
    
    Currently for MTU requests we allocate maximum possible credits
    in advance and then adjust them according to the request size.
    While we were adjusting the number of credits belonging to the
    server, we were skipping adjustment of credits belonging to the
    request. This patch fixes it by setting request credits to
    CreditCharge field value of SMB2 packet header.
    
    Also ask 1 credit more for async read and write operations to
    increase parallelism and match the behavior of other operations.

    cpufreq: scmi: Fix frequency invariance in slow path
    
    commit 0e141d1c65c1dd31c914eb2e11651adcc1a15912 upstream.
    
    The scmi-cpufreq driver calls the arch_set_freq_scale() callback on
    frequency changes to provide scale-invariant load-tracking signals to
    the scheduler. However, in the slow path, it does so while specifying
    the current and max frequencies in different units, hence resulting in a

    cpufreq: scpi/scmi: Fix freeing of dynamic OPPs
    
    commit 1690d8bb91e370ab772062b79bd434ce815c4729 upstream.
    
    Since the commit 2a4eb7358aba "OPP: Don't remove dynamic OPPs from
    _dev_pm_opp_remove_table()", dynamically created OPP aren't
    automatically removed anymore by dev_pm_opp_cpumask_remove_table(). This
    affects the scpi and scmi cpufreq drivers which no longer free OPPs on
    failures or on invocations of the policy->exit() callback.
    
    Create a generic OPP helper dev_pm_opp_remove_all_dynamic() which can be
    called from these drivers instead of dev_pm_opp_cpumask_remove_table().
    
    In dev_pm_opp_remove_all_dynamic(), we need to make sure that the
    opp_list isn't getting accessed simultaneously from other parts of the
    OPP core while the helper is freeing dynamic OPPs, i.e. we can't drop
    the opp_table->lock while traversing through the OPP list. And to
    accomplish that, this patch also creates _opp_kref_release_unlocked()
    which can be called from this new helper with the opp_table lock already
    held.

    staging: rtl8188eu: Fix module loading from tasklet for WEP encryption
    
    commit 7775665aadc48a562051834a73519129bf717d73 upstream.
    
    Commit 2b2ea09e74a5 ("staging:r8188eu: Use lib80211 to decrypt WEP-frames")
    causes scheduling while atomic bugs followed by a hard freeze whenever
    the driver tries to connect to a WEP-encrypted network. Experimentation
    showed that the freezes were eliminated when module lib80211 was
    preloaded, which can be forced by calling lib80211_get_crypto_ops()
    directly rather than indirectly through try_then_request_module().
    With this change, no BUG messages are logged.

    usbcore: Select only first configuration for non-UAC3 compliant devices
    
    commit ff2a8c532c14fd22fb26a36574d9ff199afbbe54 upstream.
    
    In most of the UAC1 and UAC2 audio devices, the first
    configuration is most often the best configuration.
    However, with recent patch to support UAC3 configuration,
    second configuration was unintentionally chosen for
    some of the UAC1/2 devices that had more than one
    configuration. This was because of the existing check
    after the audio config check which selected any config
    which had a non-vendor class. This patch fixes this issue.

    Btrfs: fix deadlock when using free space tree due to block group creation
    
    commit a6d8654d885d7d79a3fb82da64eaa489ca332a82 upstream.
    
    When modifying the free space tree we can end up COWing one of its extent
    buffers which in turn might result in allocating a new chunk, which in
    turn can result in flushing (finish creation) of pending block groups. If
    that happens we can deadlock because creating a pending block group needs
    to update the free space tree, and if any of the updates tries to modify
    the same extent buffer that we are COWing, we end up in a deadlock since
    we try to write lock twice the same extent buffer.
    
    So fix this by skipping pending block group creation if we are COWing an
    extent buffer from the free space tree. This is a case missed by commit
    5ce555578e091 ("Btrfs: fix deadlock when writing out free space caches").

    powerpc/tm: Unset MSR[TS] if not recheckpointing
    
    commit 6f5b9f018f4c7686fd944d920209d1382d320e4e upstream.
    
    There is a TM Bad Thing bug that can be caused when you return from a
    signal context in a suspended transaction but with ucontext MSR[TS] unset.
    
    This forces regs->msr[TS] to be set at syscall entrance (since the CPU
    state is transactional). It also calls treclaim() to flush the transaction
    state, which is done based on the live (mfmsr) MSR state.
    
    Since user context MSR[TS] is not set, then restore_tm_sigcontexts() is not
    called, thus, not executing recheckpoint, keeping the CPU state as not
    transactional. When calling rfid, SRR1 will have MSR[TS] set, but the CPU
    state is non transactional, causing the TM Bad Thing with the following
    stack:
    
            [   33.862316] Bad kernel stack pointer 3fffd9dce3e0 at c00000000000c47c

            WARNING: exception is not recoverable, can't continue
    
    The same problem happens on 32-bits signal handler, and the fix is very
    similar, if tm_recheckpoint() is not executed, then regs->msr[TS] should be
    zeroed.
    
    This patch also fixes a sparse warning related to lack of indentation when
    CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM is set.
