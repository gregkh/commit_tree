    commit 8b19d450ad188d402a183ff4a4d40f31c3916fbf upstream.
    
    Fix issue with adding multiple ntb client devices to the ntb virtual
    bus.  Previously, multiple devices would be added with the same name,
    resulting in crashes.  To get around this issue, add a unique number to
    the device when it is added.

    NTB: memcpy lockup workaround
    
    commit c336acd3331dcc191a97dbc66a557d47741657c7 upstream.
    
    The system will appear to lockup for long periods of time due to the NTB
    driver spending too much time in memcpy.  Avoid this by reducing the
    number of packets that can be serviced on a given interrupt.

    NTB: Correctly handle receive buffers of the minimal size
    
    commit c9d534c8cbaedbb522a1d2cb037c6c394f610317 upstream.
    
    The ring logic of the NTB receive buffer/transmit memory window requires
    there to be at least 2 payload sized allotments.  For the minimal size
    case, split the buffer into two and set the transport_mtu to the
    appropriate size.

    commit 90f9e934647e652a69396e18c779215a493271cf upstream.
    
    If the NTB link toggles, the driver could stop receiving due to the
    tx_index not being set to 0 on the transmitting size on a link-up event.
    This is due to the driver expecting the incoming data to start at the
    beginning of the receive buffer and not at a random place.

    NTB: Link toggle memory leak
    
    commit b77b2637b39ecc380bb08992380d7d48452b0872 upstream.
    
    Each link-up will allocate a new NTB receive buffer when the NTB
    properties are negotiated with the remote system.  These allocations did
    not check for existing buffers and thus did not free them.  Now, the
    driver will check for an existing buffer and free it if not of the
    correct size, before trying to alloc a new one.

    x86: Fix bit corruption at CPU resume time
    
    commit 5e427ec2d066b48a5c27b3a5a3315f7e4e729077 upstream.
    
    In commit 78d77df71510 ("x86-64, init: Do not set NX bits on non-NX
    capable hardware") we added the early_pmd_flags that gets the NX bit set
    when a CPU supports NX. However, the new variable was marked __initdata,
    because the main _use_ of this is in an __init routine.
    
    However, the bit setting happens from secondary_startup_64(), which is
    called not only at bootup, but on every secondary CPU start.  Including
    resuming from STR and at CPU hotplug time.  So the value cannot be
    __initdata.

    i2c: designware: always clear interrupts before enabling them
    
    commit 2a2d95e9d6d29e726cc294b65391917ed2e32bf4 upstream.
    
    If the I2C bus is put to a low power state by an ACPI method it might pull
    the SDA line low (as its power is removed). Once the bus is put to full
    power state again, the SDA line is pulled back to high. This transition
    looks like a STOP condition from the controller point-of-view which sets
    STOP detected bit in its status register causing the driver to fail
    subsequent transfers.
    
    Fix this by always clearing all interrupts before we start a transfer.

    i2c: designware: fix RX FIFO overrun
    
    commit e6f34cea56f5b95498070eaa9f4aa3ba4a9e4f62 upstream.
    
    i2c_dw_xfer_msg() pushes a number of bytes to transmit/receive
    to/from the bus into the TX FIFO.
    For master-rx transactions, the maximum amount of data that can be
    received is calculated depending solely on TX and RX FIFO load.
    
    This is racy - TX FIFO may contain master-rx data yet to be
    processed, which will eventually land into the RX FIFO. This
    data is not taken into account and the function may request more
    data than the controller is actually capable of storing.
    
    This patch ensures the driver takes into account the outstanding
    master-rx data in TX FIFO to prevent RX FIFO overrun.

    commit b4fed0796841b5293b9c9427a5391b7bb20ef2d9 upstream.
    
    The format of the lower 32-bits of the 64-bit operand to 'dc cisw' is
    unchanged from ARMv7 architecture and the upper bits are RES0. This
    implies that the 'way' field of the operand of 'dc cisw' occupies the
    bit-positions [31 .. (32-A)]. Due to the use of 64-bit extended operands
    to 'clz', the existing implementation of __flush_dcache_all is incorrectly
    placing the 'way' field in the bit-positions [63 .. (64-A)].

    arm64: debug: clear mdscr_el1 instead of taking the OS lock
    
    commit 9c413e25d95fd3c0abe23eadad66191b22baa549 upstream.
    
    During boot, we take the debug OS lock before interrupts are enabled.
    This is required to prevent clearing of PSTATE.D on the interrupt entry
    path, which could result in spurious debug exceptions before we've got
    round to resetting things like the hardware breakpoints registers to a
    sane state.
    
    A problem with this approach is that taking the OS lock prevents an
    external JTAG debugger from debugging the system, which is especially
    irritating during boot, where JTAG debugging can be most useful.
    
    This patch clears mdscr_el1 rather than taking the lock, clearing the
    MDE and KDE bits and preventing self-hosted hardware debug exceptions
    from occurring.
