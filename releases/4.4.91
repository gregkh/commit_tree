    ttpci: address stringop overflow warning
    
    commit 69d3973af1acd4c0989ec8218c05f12d303cd7cf upstream.
    
    gcc-7.0.1 warns about old code in ttpci:
    
    In file included from drivers/media/pci/ttpci/av7110.c:63:0:
    In function 'irdebi.isra.2',

    In function 'irdebi.isra.2',

       memcpy(av7110->debi_virt, (char *) &res, count);
    
    Apparently, 'count' can be negative here, which will then get turned
    into a giant size argument for memcpy. Changing the sizes to 'unsigned
    int' instead seems safe as we already check for maximum sizes, and it
    also simplifies the code a bit.

    ALSA: au88x0: avoid theoretical uninitialized access
    
    commit 13f99ebdd602ebdafb909e15ec6ffb1e34690167 upstream.
    
    The latest gcc-7.0.1 snapshot points out that we if nr_ch is zero, we never
    initialize some variables:
    
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c: In function 'vortex_adb_allocroute':
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2304:68: error: 'mix[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2305:58: error: 'src[0]' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    
    I assume this can never happen in practice, but adding a check here doesn't
    hurt either and avoids the warning. The code has been unchanged since
    the start of git history.

    ARM: remove duplicate 'const' annotations'

    libata: transport: Remove circular dependency at free time
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d85fc67dd11e9a32966140677d4d6429ca540b25 ]
    
    Without this patch, failed probe would not free resources like irq.
    
    ata port tdev object currently hold a reference to the ata port
    object.  Therefore the ata port object release function will not get
    called until the ata_tport_release is called. But that would never
    happen, releasing the last reference of ata port dev is done by
    scsi_host_release, which is called by ata_host_release when the ata
    port object is released.
    
    The ata device objects actually do not need to explicitly hold a
    reference to their real counterpart, given the transport objects are
    the children of these objects and device_add() is call for each child.
    We know the parent will not be deleted until we call the child's
    device_del().

    xfs: remove kmem_zalloc_greedy
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 08b005f1333154ae5b404ca28766e0ffb9f1c150 ]
    
    The sole remaining caller of kmem_zalloc_greedy is bulkstat, which uses
    it to grab 1-4 pages for staging of inobt records.  The infinite loop in
    the greedy allocation function is causing hangs[1] in generic/269, so
    just get rid of the greedy allocator in favor of kmem_zalloc_large.
    This makes bulkstat somewhat more likely to ENOMEM if there's really no
    pages to spare, but eliminates a source of hangs.

    [ Upstream commit ae5c682113f9f94cc5e76f92cf041ee624c173ee ]
    
    The helper->expect_class_max must be set to the total number of
    expect_policy minus 1, since we will use the statement "if (class >
    helper->expect_class_max)" to validate the CTA_EXPECT_CLASS attr in
    ctnetlink_alloc_expect.
    
    So for compatibility, set the helper->expect_class_max to the
    NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM attr's value minus 1.
    
    Also: it's invalid when the NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM attr's value is zero.
    1. this will result "expect_policy = kzalloc(0, GFP_KERNEL);";
    2. we cannot set the helper->expect_class_max to a proper value.
    
    So if nla_get_be32(tb[NFCTH_POLICY_SET_NUM]) is zero, report -EINVAL to
    the userspace.

    MIPS: IRQ Stack: Unwind IRQ stack onto task stack
    
    
    [ Upstream commit db8466c581cca1a08b505f1319c3ecd246f16fa8 ]
    
    When the separate IRQ stack was introduced, stack unwinding only
    proceeded as far as the top of the IRQ stack, leading to kernel
    backtraces being less useful, lacking the trace of what was interrupted.
    
    Fix this by providing a means for the kernel to unwind the IRQ stack
    onto the interrupted task stack. The processor state is saved to the
    kernel task stack on interrupt. The IRQ_STACK_START macro reserves an
    unsigned long at the top of the IRQ stack where the interrupted task
    stack pointer can be saved. After the active stack is switched to the
    IRQ stack, save the interrupted tasks stack pointer to the reserved
    location.
    
    Fix the stack unwinding code to look for the frame being the top of the
    IRQ stack and if so get the next frame from the saved location. The
    existing test does not work with the separate stack since the ra is no
    longer pointed at ret_from_{irq,exception}.
    
    The test to stop unwinding the stack 32 bytes from the top of a stack
    must be modified to allow unwinding to continue up to the location of
    the saved task stack pointer when on the IRQ stack. The low / high marks
    of the stack are set depending on whether the sp is on an irq stack or
    not.

    netfilter: invoke synchronize_rcu after set the _hook_ to NULL
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b7dabf029478bb80507a6c4500ca94132a2bc0b ]
    
    Otherwise, another CPU may access the invalid pointer. For example:
        CPU0                CPU1
         -              rcu_read_lock();
         -              pfunc = _hook_;
      _hook_ = NULL;          -
      mod unload              -
         -                 pfunc(); // invalid, panic
         -             rcu_read_unlock();
    
    So we must call synchronize_rcu() to wait the rcu reader to finish.
    
    Also note, in nf_nat_snmp_basic_fini, synchronize_rcu() will be invoked
    by later nf_conntrack_helper_unregister, but I'm inclined to add a
    explicit synchronize_rcu after set the nf_nat_snmp_hook to NULL. Depend
    on such obscure assumptions is not a good idea.
    
    Last, in nfnetlink_cttimeout, we use kfree_rcu to free the time object,
    so in cttimeout_exit, invoking rcu_barrier() is not necessary at all,

    The problem is that the bridge's VLAN group is created after setting the
    default PVID, when registering the netdevice and executing its
    ndo_init().
    
    Fix this by changing the order of both operations, so that
    br_changelink() is only processed after the netdevice is registered,
    when the VLAN group is already initialized.

    mmc: sdio: fix alignment issue in struct sdio_func
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ef1ecf060f28ecef313b5723f1fd39bf5a35f56 ]
    
    Certain 64-bit systems (e.g. Amlogic Meson GX) require buffers to be
    used for DMA to be 8-byte-aligned. struct sdio_func has an embedded
    small DMA buffer not meeting this requirement.
    When testing switching to descriptor chain mode in meson-gx driver
    SDIO is broken therefore. Fix this by allocating the small DMA buffer
    separately as kmalloc ensures that the returned memory area is
    properly aligned for every basic data type.

    ASoC: dapm: handle probe deferrals
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 37e1df8c95e2c8a57c77eafc097648f6e40a60ff ]
    
    This starts to handle probe deferrals on regulators and clocks
    on the ASoC DAPM.
    
    I came to this patch after audio stopped working on Ux500 ages
    ago and I finally looked into it to see what is wrong. I had
    messages like this in the console since a while back:
    
    ab8500-codec.0: ASoC: Failed to request audioclk: -517
    ab8500-codec.0: ASoC: Failed to create DAPM control audioclk
    ab8500-codec.0: Failed to create new controls -12
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -12
    snd-soc-mop500.0: Error: snd_soc_register_card failed (-12)!
    snd-soc-mop500: probe of snd-soc-mop500.0 failed with error -12
    
    Apparently because the widget table for the codec looks like
    this (sound/soc/codecs/ab8500-codec.c):
    
    static const struct snd_soc_dapm_widget ab8500_dapm_widgets[] = {
    
            /* Clocks */
            SND_SOC_DAPM_CLOCK_SUPPLY("audioclk"),
    
            /* Regulators */
            SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY("V-AUD", 0, 0),
            SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY("V-AMIC1", 0, 0),
            SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY("V-AMIC2", 0, 0),
            SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY("V-DMIC", 0, 0),
    
    So when we call snd_soc_register_codec() and any of these widgets
    get a deferred probe we do not get an -EPROBE_DEFER (-517) back as
    we should and instead we just fail. Apparently the code assumes
    that clocks and regulators must be available at this point and
    not defer.
    
    After this patch it rather looks like this:
    
    ab8500-codec.0: Failed to create new controls -517
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -517
    snd-soc-mop500.0: Error: snd_soc_register_card failed (-517)!
    (...)
    abx500-clk.0: registered clocks for ab850x
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ab8500-codec-dai.0 <-> ux500-msp-i2s.1 mapping ok
    snd-soc-mop500.0: ab8500-codec-dai.1 <-> ux500-msp-i2s.3 mapping ok
    
    I'm pretty happy about the patch as it it, but I'm a bit
    uncertain on how to proceed: there are a lot of users of the
    external functions snd_soc_dapm_new_control() (111 sites)
    and that will now return an occassional error pointer, which
    is not handled in the calling sites.
    
    I want an indication from the maintainers whether I should just
    go in and augment all these call sites, or if deferred probe
    is frowned upon when it leads to this much overhead.

    partitions/efi: Fix integer overflow in GPT size calculation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c5082b70adfe8e1ea1cf4a8eff92c9f260e364d2 ]
    
    If a GUID Partition Table claims to have more than 2**25 entries, the
    calculation of the partition table size in alloc_read_gpt_entries() will
    overflow a 32-bit integer and not enough space will be allocated for the
    table.
    
    Nothing seems to get written out of bounds, but later efi_partition() will
    read up to 32768 bytes from a 128 byte buffer, possibly OOPSing or exposing
    information to /proc/partitions and uevents.
    
    The problem exists on both 64-bit and 32-bit platforms.
    
    Fix the overflow and also print a meaningful debug message if the table
    size is too large.

    IB/ipoib: Replace list_del of the neigh->list with list_del_init
    
    
    [ Upstream commit c586071d1dc8227a7182179b8e50ee92cc43f6d2 ]
    
    In order to resolve a situation where a few process delete
    the same list element in sequence and cause panic, list_del
    is replaced with list_del_init. In this case if the first
    process that calls list_del releases the lock before acquiring
    it again, other processes who can acquire the lock will call
    list_del_init.

    IB/ipoib: rtnl_unlock can not come after free_netdev
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 89a3987ab7a923c047c6dec008e60ad6f41fac22 ]
    
    The ipoib_vlan_add function calls rtnl_unlock after free_netdev,
    rtnl_unlock not only releases the lock, but also calls netdev_run_todo.
    The latter function browses the net_todo_list array and completes the
    unregistration of all its net_device instances. If we call free_netdev
    before rtnl_unlock, then netdev_run_todo call over the freed device causes
    panic.
    To fix, move rtnl_unlock call before free_netdev call.

    IB/ipoib: Fix deadlock over vlan_mutex
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c3098cdb05207e740715857df7b0998e372f527 ]
    
    This patch fixes Deadlock while executing ipoib_vlan_delete.
    
    The function takes the vlan_rwsem semaphore and calls
    unregister_netdevice. The later function calls
    ipoib_mcast_stop_thread that cause workqueue flush.
    
    When the queue has one of the ipoib_ib_dev_flush_xxx events,
    a deadlock occur because these events also tries to catch the
    same vlan_rwsem semaphore.
    
    To fix, unregister_netdevice should be called after releasing
    the semaphore.

    iio: adc: axp288: Drop bogus AXP288_ADC_TS_PIN_CTRL register modifications
    
    
    [ Upstream commit fa2849e9649b5180ffc4cb3c3b005261c403093a ]
    
    For some reason the axp288_adc driver was modifying the
    AXP288_ADC_TS_PIN_CTRL register, changing bits 0-1 depending on
    whether the GP_ADC channel or another channel was written.
    
    These bits control when a bias current is send to the TS_PIN, the
    GP_ADC has its own pin and a separate bit in another register to
    control the bias current.
    
    Not only does changing when to enable the TS_PIN bias current
    (always or only when sampling) when reading the GP_ADC make no sense
    at all, the code is modifying these bits is writing the entire register,
    assuming that all the other bits have their default value.
    
    So if the firmware has configured a different bias-current for either
    pin, then that change gets clobbered by the write, likewise if the
    firmware has set bit 2 to indicate that the battery has no thermal sensor,
    this will get clobbered by the write.
    
    This commit fixes all this, by simply removing all writes to the
    AXP288_ADC_TS_PIN_CTRL register, they are not needed to read the
    GP_ADC pin, and can actually be harmful.

    extcon: axp288: Use vbus-valid instead of -present to determine cable presence
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 5757aca10146061befd168dab37fb0db1ccd8f73 ]
    
    The vbus-present bit in the power status register also gets set to 1
    when a usb-host cable (id-pin shorted to ground) is plugged in and a 5v
    boost converter is supplying 5v to the otg usb bus.
    
    This causes a "disconnect or unknown or ID event" warning in dmesg as
    well as the extcon device to report the last detected charger cable
    type as being connected even though none is connected.
    
    This commit switches to checking the vbus-valid bit instead, which is
    only 1 when both vbus is present and the vbus-path is enabled in the
    vbus-path control register (the vbus-path gets disabled when a usb-host
    cable is detected, to avoid the pmic drawing power from the 5v boost
    converter).

    igb: re-assign hw address pointer on reset after PCI error
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 69b97cf6dbce7403845a28bbc75d57f5be7b12ac ]
    
    Whenever the igb driver detects the result of a read operation returns
    a value composed only by F's (like 0xFFFFFFFF), it will detach the
    net_device, clear the hw_addr pointer and warn to the user that adapter's
    link is lost - those steps happen on igb_rd32().
    
    In case a PCI error happens on Power architecture, there's a recovery
    mechanism called EEH, that will reset the PCI slot and call driver's
    handlers to reset the adapter and network functionality as well.
    
    We observed that once hw_addr is NULL after the error is detected on
    igb_rd32(), it's never assigned back, so in the process of resetting
    the network functionality we got a NULL pointer dereference in both
    igb_configure_tx_ring() and igb_configure_rx_ring(). In order to avoid
    such bug, this patch re-assigns the hw_addr value in the slot_reset
    handler.

    MIPS: Ensure bss section ends on a long-aligned address
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f00f4d8f083bc61005d0a1ef592b149f5c88bbd ]
    
    When clearing the .bss section in kernel_entry we do so using LONG_S
    instructions, and branch whilst the current write address doesn't equal
    the end of the .bss section minus the size of a long integer. The .bss
    section always begins at a long-aligned address and we always increment
    the write pointer by the size of a long integer - we therefore rely upon
    the .bss section ending at a long-aligned address. If this is not the
    case then the long-aligned write address can never be equal to the
    non-long-aligned end address & we will continue to increment past the
    end of the .bss section, attempting to zero the rest of memory.
    
    Despite this requirement that .bss end at a long-aligned address we pass
    0 as the end alignment requirement to the BSS_SECTION macro and thus
    don't guarantee any particular alignment, allowing us to hit the error
    condition described above.
    
    Fix this by instead passing 8 bytes as the end alignment argument to
    the BSS_SECTION macro, ensuring that the end of the .bss section is
    always at least long-aligned.

    Thanks to Venkat for debug and root casuing the issue
    where only first part of the message(RDMA) was
    successfully delivered but remainder payload delivery failed.
    In that case, application should not be notified with
    a false positive of message delivery success.
