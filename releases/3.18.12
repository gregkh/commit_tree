    net: ethernet: pcnet32: Setup the SRAM and NOUFLO on Am79C97{3, 5}
    
    [ Upstream commit 87f966d97b89774162df04d2106c6350c8fe4cb3 ]
    
    On a MIPS Malta board, tons of fifo underflow errors have been observed
    when using u-boot as bootloader instead of YAMON. The reason for that
    is that YAMON used to set the pcnet device to SRAM mode but u-boot does
    not. As a result, the default Tx threshold (64 bytes) is now too small to
    keep the fifo relatively used and it can result to Tx fifo underflow errors.
    As a result of which, it's best to setup the SRAM on supported controllers
    so we can always use the NOUFLO bit.

    powerpc/pseries: Little endian fixes for post mobility device tree update
    
    [ Upstream commit f6ff04149637723261aa4738958b0098b929ee9e ]
    
    We currently use the device tree update code in the kernel after resuming
    from a suspend operation to re-sync the kernels view of the device tree with
    that of the hypervisor. The code as it stands is not endian safe as it relies
    on parsing buffers returned by RTAS calls that thusly contains data in big
    endian format.
    
    This patch annotates variables and structure members with __be types as well
    as performing necessary byte swaps to cpu endian for data that needs to be
    parsed.

    sb_edac: Fix discovery of top-of-low-memory for Haswell
    
    [ Upstream commit f7cf2a22a2896d3b3595b71d7936b6d7a3316b00 ]
    
    Haswell moved the TOLM/TOHM registers to a different device and offset.
    The sb_edac driver accounted for the change of device, but not for the
    new offset.  There was also a typo in the constant to fill in the low
    26 bits (was 0x1ffffff, should be 0x3ffffff).
    
    This resulted in a bogus value for the top of low memory:
    
      EDAC DEBUG: get_memory_layout: TOLM: 0.032 GB (0x0000000001ffffff)
    
    which would result in EDAC refusing to translate addresses for
    errors above the bogus value and below 4GB:

    Revert "libceph: use memalloc flags for net IO"
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d7fdb0ab351b33d4c12d53fe44be030b90fc9d4 ]
    
    This reverts commit 89baaa570ab0b476db09408d209578cfed700e9f.
    
    Dirty page throttling should be sufficient for us in the general case
    so there is no need to use __GFP_MEMALLOC - it would be needed only in
    the swap-over-rbd case, which we currently don't support.  (It would
    probably take approximately the commit that is being reverted to add
    that support, but we would also need the "swap" option to distinguish
    from the general case and make sure swap ceph_client-s aren't shared
    with anything else.)  See ceph-devel threads [1] and [2] for the
    details of why enabling pfmemalloc reserves for all cases is a bad
    thing.
    
    On top of potential system lockups related to drained emergency
    reserves, this turned out to cause ceph lockups in case peers are on
    the same host and communicating via loopback due to sk_filter()
    dropping pfmemalloc skbs on the receiving side because the receiving
    loopback socket is not tagged with SOCK_MEMALLOC.

    hfsplus: fix B-tree corruption after insertion at position 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 98cf21c61a7f5419d82f847c4d77bf6e96a76f5f ]
    
    Fix B-tree corruption when a new record is inserted at position 0 in the
    node in hfs_brec_insert().  In this case a hfs_brec_update_parent() is
    called to update the parent index node (if exists) and it is passed
    hfs_find_data with a search_key containing a newly inserted key instead
    of the key to be updated.  This results in an inconsistent index node.
    The bug reproduces on my machine after an extents overflow record for
    the catalog file (CNID=4) is inserted into the extents overflow B-tree.
    Because of a low (reserved) value of CNID=4, it has to become the first
    record in the first leaf node.
    
    The resulting first leaf node is correct:
    
      ----------------------------------------------------
      | key0.CNID=4 | key1.CNID=123 | key2.CNID=456, ... |
      ----------------------------------------------------
    
    But the parent index key0 still contains the previous key CNID=123:
    
      -----------------------
      | key0.CNID=123 | ... |
      -----------------------
    
    A change in hfs_brec_insert() makes hfs_brec_update_parent() work
    correctly by preventing it from getting fd->record=-1 value from
    __hfs_brec_find().
    
    Along the way, I removed duplicate code with unification of the if
    condition.  The resulting code is equivalent to the original code
    because node is never 0.
    
    Also hfs_brec_update_parent() will now return an error after getting a
    negative fd->record value.  However, the return value of
    hfs_brec_update_parent() is not checked anywhere in the file and I'm
    leaving it unchanged by this patch.  brec.c lacks error checking after
    some other calls too, but this issue is of less importance than the one
    being fixed by this patch.

    spi: trigger trace event for message-done before mesg->complete
    
    [ Upstream commit 391949b6f02121371e3d7d9082c6d17fd9853034 ]
    
    With spidev the mesg->complete callback points to spidev_complete.
    Calling this unblocks spidev_sync and so spidev_sync_write finishes. As
    the struct spi_message just read is a local variable in
    spidev_sync_write and recording the trace event accesses this message
    the recording is better done first. The same can happen for
    spidev_sync_read.
    
    This fixes an oops observed on a 3.14-rt system with spidev activity
    after
    
            echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/spi/enable

    dm snapshot: suspend merging snapshot when doing exception handover
    
    [ Upstream commit 09ee96b21456883e108c3b00597bb37ec512151b ]
    
    The "dm snapshot: suspend origin when doing exception handover" commit
    fixed a exception store handover bug associated with pending exceptions
    to the "snapshot-origin" target.
    
    However, a similar problem exists in snapshot merging.  When snapshot
    merging is in progress, we use the target "snapshot-merge" instead of
    "snapshot-origin".  Consequently, during exception store handover, we
    must find the snapshot-merge target and suspend its associated
    mapped_device.
    
    To avoid lockdep warnings, the target must be suspended and resumed
    without holding _origins_lock.
    
    Introduce a dm_hold() function that grabs a reference on a
    mapped_device, but unlike dm_get(), it doesn't crash if the device has
    the DMF_FREEING flag set, it returns an error in this case.
    
    In snapshot_resume() we grab the reference to the origin device using
    dm_hold() while holding _origins_lock (_origins_lock guarantees that the
    device won't disappear).  Then we release _origins_lock, suspend the
    device and grab _origins_lock again.
    
    NOTE to stable@ people:
    When backporting to kernels 3.18 and older, use dm_internal_suspend and
    dm_internal_resume instead of dm_internal_suspend_fast and
    dm_internal_resume_fast.

    dm snapshot: suspend origin when doing exception handover
    
    [ Upstream commit b735fede8d957d9d255e9c5cf3964cfa59799637 ]
    
    In the function snapshot_resume we perform exception store handover.  If
    there is another active snapshot target, the exception store is moved
    from this target to the target that is being resumed.
    
    The problem is that if there is some pending exception, it will point to
    an incorrect exception store after that handover, causing a crash due to
    dm-snap-persistent.c:get_exception()'s BUG_ON.
    
    This bug can be triggered by repeatedly changing snapshot permissions
    with "lvchange -p r" and "lvchange -p rw" while there are writes on the
    associated origin device.
    
    To fix this bug, we must suspend the origin device when doing the
    exception store handover to make sure that there are no pending
    exceptions:
    - introduce _origin_hash that keeps track of dm_origin structures.
    - introduce functions __lookup_dm_origin, __insert_dm_origin and
      __remove_dm_origin that manipulate the origin hash.
    - modify snapshot_resume so that it calls dm_internal_suspend_fast() and
      dm_internal_resume_fast() on the origin device.
    
    NOTE to stable@ people:
    
    When backporting to kernels 3.12-3.18, use dm_internal_suspend and
    dm_internal_resume instead of dm_internal_suspend_fast and
    dm_internal_resume_fast.
    
    When backporting to kernels older than 3.12, you need to pick functions
    dm_internal_suspend and dm_internal_resume from the commit
    fd2ed4d252701d3bbed4cd3e3d267ad469bb832a.

    dm thin: fix to consistently zero-fill reads to unprovisioned blocks
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f027a3bf184d1d36e68745f7cd3718a8b879cc0 ]
    
    It was always intended that a read to an unprovisioned block will return
    zeroes regardless of whether the pool is in read-only or read-write
    mode.  thin_bio_map() was inconsistent with its handling of such reads
    when the pool is in read-only mode, it now properly zero-fills the bios
    it returns in response to unprovisioned block reads.
    
    Eliminate thin_bio_map()'s special read-only mode handling of -ENODATA
    and just allow the IO to be deferred to the worker which will result in
    pool->process_bio() handling the IO (which already properly zero-fills
    reads to unprovisioned blocks).

    both of them (a) to reject IO if the special command is unsupported at

    perf: Fix irq_work 'tail' recursion
    
    [ Upstream commit d525211f9d1be8b523ec7633f080f2116f5ea536 ]
    
    Vince reported a watchdog lockup like:
    
            [<ffffffff8115e114>] perf_tp_event+0xc4/0x210
            [<ffffffff810b4f8a>] perf_trace_lock+0x12a/0x160

            [<ffffffff8107bb4d>] do_send_sig_info+0x5d/0x80
            [<ffffffff811f69df>] send_sigio_to_task+0x12f/0x1a0
            [<ffffffff811f71ce>] send_sigio+0xae/0x100
            [<ffffffff811f72b7>] kill_fasync+0x97/0xf0

            [<ffffffff816c99bd>] trace_irq_work_interrupt+0x6d/0x80
    
    Which is caused by an irq_work generating new irq_work and therefore
    not allowing forward progress.
    
    This happens because processing the perf irq_work triggers another
    perf event (tracepoint stuff) which in turn generates an irq_work ad
    infinitum.
    
    Avoid this by raising the recursion counter in the irq_work -- which
    effectively disables all software events (including tracepoints) from
    actually triggering again.

    of/irq: Fix of_irq_parse_one() returned error codes
    
    [ Upstream commit d7c146053dd195b90c79b9b8131431f44541d015 ]
    
    The error code paths that require cleanup use a goto to jump to the
    cleanup code and return an error code. However, the error code variable
    res, which is initialized to -EINVAL when declared, is then overwritten
    with the return value of of_parse_phandle_with_args(), and reused as the
    return code from of_irq_parse_one(). This leads to an undetermined error
    being returned instead of the expected -EINVAL value. Fix it.

    [ Upstream commit 43b68879de27b1993518687fbc6013da80cdcbfe ]
    
    As stated in kernel/cpu_pm.c, "Platform is responsible for ensuring
    that cpu_pm_enter is not called twice on the same CPU before
    cpu_pm_exit is called.". In the current code in case of failure when
    calling mvebu_v7_cpu_suspend, the function cpu_pm_exit() is never
    called whereas cpu_pm_enter() was called just before.
    
    This patch moves the cpu_pm_exit() in order to balance the
    cpu_pm_enter() calls.

    rtlwifi: Improve handling of IPv6 packets
    
    [ Upstream commit c8f0345586694a33f828bc6b177fb21eb1702325 ]
    
    Routine rtl_is_special_data() is supposed to identify packets that need to
    use a low bit rate so that the probability of successful transmission is
    high. The current version has a bug that causes all IPv6 packets to be
    labelled as special, with a corresponding low rate of transmission. A
    complete fix will be quite intrusive, but until that is available, all
    IPv6 packets are identified as regular.
    
    This patch also removes a magic number.

    mac80211: count interfaces correctly for combination checks
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f611d28fc2e13cfec64e1c544c16a086886805a ]
    
    Since moving the interface combination checks to mac80211, it's
    broken because it now only considers interfaces with an assigned
    channel context, so for example any interface that isn't active
    can still be up, which is clearly an issue; also, in particular

    mac80211: disable u-APSD queues by default
    
    [ Upstream commit aa75ebc275b2a91b193654a177daf900ad6703f0 ]
    
    Some APs experience problems when working with
    U-APSD. Decreasing the probability of that
    happening by using legacy mode for all ACs but VO
    isn't enough.
    
    Cisco 4410N originally forced us to enable VO by
    default only because it treated non-VO ACs as
    legacy.
    
    However some APs (notably Netgear R7000) silently
    reclassify packets to different ACs. Since u-APSD
    ACs require trigger frames for frame retrieval
    clients would never see some frames (e.g. ARP
    responses) or would fetch them accidentally after
    a long time.
    
    It makes little sense to enable u-APSD queues by
    default because it needs userspace applications to
    be aware of it to actually take advantage of the
    possible additional powersavings. Implicitly
    depending on driver autotrigger frame support
    doesn't make much sense.

    nl80211: ignore HT/VHT capabilities without QoS/WMM
    
    [ Upstream commit 496fcc294daab18799e190c0264863d653588d1f ]
    
    As HT/VHT depend heavily on QoS/WMM, it's not a good idea to
    let userspace add clients that have HT/VHT but not QoS/WMM.
    Since it does so in certain cases we've observed (client is
    using HT IEs but not QoS/WMM) just ignore the HT/VHT info at
    this point and don't pass it down to the drivers which might
    unconditionally use it.

    [ Upstream commit dc5465dc8a6d5cae8a0e1d8826bdcb2e4cb261ab ]
    
    On the X1 Carbon 3rd gen (with a 2015 broadwell cpu), the physical middle
    button of the trackstick (attached to the touchpad serio device, of course)
    seems to get lost.
    
    Actually, the touchpads reports 3 extra buttons, which falls in the switch
    below to the '2' case. Let's handle the case of odd numbers also, so that
    the middle button finds its way back.

    Input: synaptics - skip quirks when post-2013 dimensions
    
    [ Upstream commit 02e07492cdfae9c86e3bd21c0beec88dbcc1e9e8 ]
    
    Post-2013 Lenovo laptops provide correct min/max dimensions, which are
    different with the ones currently quirked.  According to
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91541 the following board ids
    are assigned in the post-2013 touchpads:
    
    t440p/t440s: LEN0036 -> 2964/2962
    t540p:       LEN0034 -> 2964
    
    Using 2961 as the common minimum makes these 3 laptops OK. We may need
    to update those values later if other pnp_ids has a lower board_id.

    tcm_qla2xxx: Fix incorrect use of __transport_register_session
    
    [ Upstream commit 75c3d0bf9caebb502e96683b2bc37f9692437e68 ]
    
    This patch fixes the incorrect use of __transport_register_session()
    in tcm_qla2xxx_check_initiator_node_acl() code, that does not perform
    explicit se_tpg->session_lock when accessing se_tpg->tpg_sess_list
    to add new se_sess nodes.
    
    Given that tcm_qla2xxx_check_initiator_node_acl() is not called with
    qla_hw->hardware_lock held for all accesses of ->tpg_sess_list, the
    code should be using transport_register_session() instead.

    clocksource: efm32: Fix a NULL pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b8f10da3bf1056546133c9f54f49ce389fd95ab ]
    
    The initialisation of the efm32 clocksource first sets up the irq and only
    after that initialises the data needed for irq handling. In case this
    initialisation is delayed the irq handler would dereference a NULL pointer.
    
    I'm not aware of anything that could delay the process in such a way, but it's
    better to be safe than sorry, so setup the irq only when the clock event device
    is ready.

    regmap: regcache-rbtree: Fix present bitmap resize
    
    [ Upstream commit 328f494d95aac8bd4896aea2328bc281053bcb71 ]
    
    When inserting a new register into a block at the lower end the present
    bitmap is currently shifted into the wrong direction. The effect of this is
    that the bitmap becomes corrupted and registers which are present might be
    reported as not present and vice versa.
    
    Fix this by shifting left rather than right.

    The interrupt is enabled before the handler is set. Even this bug
    did not appear, it is potentially dangerous as it can lead to a
    NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Fix the error by enabling the interrupt after
    clockevents_config_and_register() is called.

    virtio-balloon: do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d2a3774c1b046f548ebea0391a602fd5685a307 ]
    
    virtio balloon has this code:
            wait_event_interruptible(vb->config_change,
                                     (diff = towards_target(vb)) != 0
                                     || vb->need_stats_update
                                     || kthread_should_stop()
                                     || freezing(current));
    
    Which is a problem because towards_target() call might block after
    wait_event_interruptible sets task state to TAST_INTERRUPTIBLE, causing
    the task_struct::state collision typical of nesting of sleeping
    primitives
    
    See also http://lwn.net/Articles/628628/ or Thomas's
    bug report
    http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.virtualization/24846
    for a fuller explanation.
    
    To fix, rewrite using wait_woken.

    sched/wait: Provide infrastructure to deal with nested blocking
    
    [ Upstream commit 61ada528dea028331e99e8ceaed87c683ad25de2 ]
    
    There are a few places that call blocking primitives from wait loops,
    provide infrastructure to support this without the typical
    task_struct::state collision.
    
    We record the wakeup in wait_queue_t::flags which leaves
    task_struct::state free to be used by others.

    virtio_balloon: set DRIVER_OK before using device
    
    [ Upstream commit 88660f7fb94cda1f8f63ee92bfcd0db39a6361e2 ]
    
    virtio spec requires that all drivers set DRIVER_OK
    before using devices. While balloon isn't yet
    included in the virtio 1 spec, previous spec versions
    also required this.
    
    virtio balloon might violate this rule: probe calls
    kthread_run before setting DRIVER_OK, which might run
    immediately and cause balloon to inflate/deflate.
    
    To fix, call virtio_device_ready before running the kthread.

    ASoC: cs4271: Fix wrong value references for boolean kctl
    
    [ Upstream commit e8371aa0fecb73fb8a4b2e0296b025b11e7d6229 ]
    
    The correct values referred by a boolean control are
    value.integer.value[], not value.enumerated.item[].
    The former is long while the latter is int, so it's even incompatible
    on 64bit architectures.

    ASoC: sgtl5000: remove useless register write clearing CHRGPUMP_POWERUP
    
    [ Upstream commit c7d910b87d3c8e9fcf4077089ca4327c12eee099 ]
    
    The SGTL5000_CHIP_ANA_POWER register is cached. Update the cached
    value instead of writing it directly.
    
    Patch inspired by Russell King's more colorful remarks in this

    ASoC: sn95031: Fix control-less DAPM routes
    
    [ Upstream commit cdd3d2a93f08823a0b9802147dc28c99029dfdfd ]
    
    Routes without a control must use NULL for the control name. The sn95031
    driver uses "NULL" instead in a few places. Previous to commit 5fe5b767dc6f
    ("ASoC: dapm: Do not pretend to support controls for non mixer/mux widgets")
    the DAPM core silently ignored non-NULL controls on non-mixer and non-mux
    routes. But starting with that commit it will complain and not add the
    route breaking the sn95031 driver in the process.
    
    This patch replaces the incorrect "NULL" control name with NULL to fix the
    issue.
