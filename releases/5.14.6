    drm/panfrost: Clamp lock region to Bifrost minimum
    
    commit bd7ffbc3ca12629aeb66fb9e28cf42b7f37e3e3b upstream.
    
    When locking a region, we currently clamp to a PAGE_SIZE as the minimum
    lock region. While this is valid for Midgard, it is invalid for Bifrost,
    where the minimum locking size is 8x larger than the 4k page size. Add a
    hardware definition for the minimum lock region size (corresponding to
    KBASE_LOCK_REGION_MIN_SIZE_LOG2 in kbase) and respect it.

    drm/panfrost: Use u64 for size in lock_region
    
    commit a77b58825d7221d4a45c47881c35a47ba003aa73 upstream.
    
    Mali virtual addresses are 48-bit. Use a u64 instead of size_t to ensure
    we can express the "lock everything" condition as ~0ULL without
    overflow. This code was silently broken on any platform where a size_t
    is less than 48-bits; in particular, it was broken on 32-bit armv7
    platforms which remain in use with panfrost. (Mainly RK3288)

    drm/panfrost: Simplify lock_region calculation
    
    commit b5fab345654c603c07525100d744498f28786929 upstream.
    
    In lock_region, simplify the calculation of the region_width parameter.
    This field is the size, but encoded as ceil(log2(size)) - 1.
    ceil(log2(size)) may be computed directly as fls(size - 1). However, we
    want to use the 64-bit versions as the amount to lock can exceed
    32-bits.
    
    This avoids undefined (and completely wrong) behaviour when locking all
    memory (size ~0). In this case, the old code would "round up" ~0 to the
    nearest page, overflowing to 0. Since fls(0) == 0, this would calculate
    a region width of 10 + 0 = 10. But then the code would shift by
    (region_width - 11) = -1. As shifting by a negative number is undefined,
    UBSAN flags the bug. Of course, even if it were defined the behaviour is
    wrong, instead of locking all memory almost none would get locked.
    
    The new form of the calculation corrects this special case and avoids
    the undefined behaviour.

    drm/ttm: Fix ttm_bo_move_memcpy() for subclassed struct ttm_resource
    
    commit efcefc7127290e7e9fa98dea029163ad8eda8fb3 upstream.
    
    The code was making a copy of a struct ttm_resource. However,
    recently the struct ttm_resources were allowed to be subclassed and
    also were allowed to be malloced, hence the driver could end up assuming
    the copy we handed it was subclassed and worse, the original could have
    been freed at this point.
    
    Fix this by using the original struct ttm_resource before it is
    potentially freed in ttm_bo_move_sync_cleanup()
    
    v2: Base on drm-misc-next-fixes rather than drm-tip.

    drm/msm/disp/dpu1: add safe lut config in dpu driver
    
    commit 5bccb945f38b2aff334619b23b50bb0a6a9995a5 upstream.
    
    Add safe lut configuration for all the targets in dpu
    driver as per QOS recommendation.
    
    Issue reported on SC7280:
    
    With wait-for-safe feature in smmu enabled, RT client
    buffer levels are checked to be safe before smmu invalidation.
    Since display was always set to unsafe it was delaying the
    invalidaiton process thus impacting the performance on NRT clients
    such as eMMC and NVMe.
    
    Validated this change on SC7280, With this change eMMC performance
    has improved significantly.
    
    Changes in v2:
    - Add fixes tag (Sai)
    - CC stable kernel (Dimtry)
    
    Changes in v3:
    - Correct fixes tag with appropriate hash (stephen)
    - Resend patch adding reviewed by tag
    - Resend patch adding correct format for pushing into stable tree (Greg)

    commit 7fdc48cc63a30fa3480d18bdd8c5fff2b9b15212 upstream.
    
    Jobs can be in-flight when the file descriptor is closed (either because
    the process did not terminate properly, or because it didn't wait for
    all GPU jobs to be finished), and apparently panfrost_job_close() does
    not cancel already running jobs. Let's refcount the MMU context object
    so it's lifetime is no longer bound to the FD lifetime and running jobs
    can finish properly without generating spurious page faults.

    drm/dp_mst: Fix return code on sideband message failure
    
    commit 92bd92c44d0d9be5dcbcda315b4be4b909ed9740 upstream.
    
    Commit 2f015ec6eab6 ("drm/dp_mst: Add sideband down request tracing +
    selftests") added some debug code for sideband message tracing. But
    it seems to have unintentionally changed the behavior on sideband message
    failure. It catches and returns failure only if DRM_UT_DP is enabled.
    Otherwise it ignores the error code and returns success. So on an MST
    unplug, the caller is unaware that the clear payload message failed and
    ends up waiting for 4 seconds for the response. Fixes the issue by
    returning the proper error code.

    <MISC>. Use it from each individual PLL update function.

    net: stmmac: Fix overall budget calculation for rxtx_napi
    
    commit 81d0885d68ec427e62044cf46a400c9958ea0092 upstream.
    
    tx_done is not used for napi_complete_done(). Thus, NAPI busy polling
    mechanism by gro_flush_timeout and napi_defer_hard_irqs will not able
    be triggered after a packet is transmitted when there is no receive
    packet.
    
    Fix this by taking the maximum value between tx_done and rx_done as
    overall budget completed by the rxtx NAPI poll to ensure XDP Tx ZC
    operation is continuously polling for next Tx frame. This gives
    benefit of lower packet submission processing latency and jitter
    under XDP Tx ZC mode.
    
    Performance of tx-only using xdp-sock on Intel ADL-S platform is
    the same with and without this patch.

    net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: fix maximum frame length
    
    commit 552799f8b3b0074d2617f53a63a088f9514a66e3 upstream.
    
    Currently, outgoing packets larger than 1496 bytes are dropped when
    tagged VLAN is used on a switch port.
    
    Add the frame check sequence length to the value of the register
    GSWIP_MAC_FLEN to fix this. This matches the lantiq_ppa vendor driver,
    which uses a value consisting of 1518 bytes for the MAC frame, plus the
    lengths of special tag and VLAN tags.

    libnvdimm/pmem: Fix crash triggered when I/O in-flight during unbind
    
    commit 32b2397c1e56f33b0b1881def965bb89bd12f448 upstream.
    
    There is a use after free crash when the pmem driver tears down its

    memcg: enable accounting for pids in nested pid namespaces
    
    commit fab827dbee8c2e06ca4ba000fa6c48bcf9054aba upstream.
    
    Commit 5d097056c9a0 ("kmemcg: account certain kmem allocations to memcg")
    enabled memcg accounting for pids allocated from init_pid_ns.pid_cachep,
    but forgot to adjust the setting for nested pid namespaces.  As a result,
    pid memory is not accounted exactly where it is really needed, inside
    memcg-limited containers with their own pid namespaces.
    
    Pid was one the first kernel objects enabled for memcg accounting.
    init_pid_ns.pid_cachep marked by SLAB_ACCOUNT and we can expect that any
    new pids in the system are memcg-accounted.
    
    Though recently I've noticed that it is wrong.  nested pid namespaces
    creates own slab caches for pid objects, nested pids have increased size
    because contain id both for all parent and for own pid namespaces.  The
    problem is that these slab caches are _NOT_ marked by SLAB_ACCOUNT, as a
    result any pids allocated in nested pid namespaces are not
    memcg-accounted.
    
    Pid struct in nested pid namespace consumes up to 500 bytes memory, 100000
    such objects gives us up to ~50Mb unaccounted memory, this allow container
    to exceed assigned memcg limits.

    mm/mempolicy: fix a race between offset_il_node and mpol_rebind_task
    
    commit 276aeee1c5fc00df700f0782060beae126600472 upstream.
    
    Servers happened below panic:
    
      Kernel version:5.4.56
      BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000002c48
      RIP: 0010:__next_zones_zonelist+0x1d/0x40
      Call Trace:
        __alloc_pages_nodemask+0x277/0x310
        alloc_page_interleave+0x13/0x70
        handle_mm_fault+0xf99/0x1390
        __do_page_fault+0x288/0x500
        do_page_fault+0x30/0x110
        page_fault+0x3e/0x50
    
    The reason for the panic is that MAX_NUMNODES is passed in the third
    parameter in __alloc_pages_nodemask(preferred_nid).  So access to
    zonelist->zoneref->zone_idx in __next_zones_zonelist will cause a panic.
    
    In offset_il_node(), first_node() returns nid from pol->v.nodes, after
    this other threads may chang pol->v.nodes before next_node().  This race
    condition will let next_node return MAX_NUMNODES.  So put pol->nodes in
    a local variable.
    
    The race condition is between offset_il_node and cpuset_change_task_nodemask:
    
      CPU0:                                     CPU1:
      alloc_pages_vma()
        interleave_nid(pol,)
          offset_il_node(pol,)
            first_node(pol->v.nodes)            cpuset_change_task_nodemask
                            //nodes==0xc          mpol_rebind_task
                                                    mpol_rebind_policy
                                                      mpol_rebind_nodemask(pol,nodes)
                            //nodes==0x3
            next_node(nid, pol->v.nodes)//return MAX_NUMNODES

    mm,vmscan: fix divide by zero in get_scan_count
    
    commit 32d4f4b782bb8f0ceb78c6b5dc46eb577ae25bf7 upstream.
    
    Commit f56ce412a59d ("mm: memcontrol: fix occasional OOMs due to
    proportional memory.low reclaim") introduced a divide by zero corner
    case when oomd is being used in combination with cgroup memory.low
    protection.
    
    When oomd decides to kill a cgroup, it will force the cgroup memory to
    be reclaimed after killing the tasks, by writing to the memory.max file
    for that cgroup, forcing the remaining page cache and reclaimable slab
    to be reclaimed down to zero.
    
    Previously, on cgroups with some memory.low protection that would result
    in the memory being reclaimed down to the memory.low limit, or likely
    not at all, having the page cache reclaimed asynchronously later.
    
    With f56ce412a59d the oomd write to memory.max tries to reclaim all the
    way down to zero, which may race with another reclaimer, to the point of
    ending up with the divide by zero below.
    
    This patch implements the obvious fix.

    mm/hugetlb: initialize hugetlb_usage in mm_init
    
    commit 13db8c50477d83ad3e3b9b0ae247e5cd833a7ae4 upstream.
    
    After fork, the child process will get incorrect (2x) hugetlb_usage.  If
    a process uses 5 2MB hugetlb pages in an anonymous mapping,
    
            HugetlbPages:      10240 kB
    
    and then forks, the child will show,
    
            HugetlbPages:      20480 kB
    
    The reason for double the amount is because hugetlb_usage will be copied
    from the parent and then increased when we copy page tables from parent
    to child.  Child will have 2x actual usage.
    
    Fix this by adding hugetlb_count_init in mm_init.

    mm/hmm: bypass devmap pte when all pfn requested flags are fulfilled
    
    commit 4b42fb213678d2b6a9eeea92a9be200f23e49583 upstream.
    
    Previously, we noticed the one rpma example was failed[1] since commit
    36f30e486dce ("IB/core: Improve ODP to use hmm_range_fault()"), where it
    will use ODP feature to do RDMA WRITE between fsdax files.
    
    After digging into the code, we found hmm_vma_handle_pte() will still
    return EFAULT even though all the its requesting flags has been
    fulfilled.  That's because a DAX page will be marked as (_PAGE_SPECIAL |
    PAGE_DEVMAP) by pte_mkdevmap().

    mm/memory_hotplug: use "unsigned long" for PFN in zone_for_pfn_range()
    
    commit 7cf209ba8a86410939a24cb1aeb279479a7e0ca6 upstream.
    
    Patch series "mm/memory_hotplug: preparatory patches for new online policy and memory"
    
    These are all cleanups and one fix previously sent as part of [1]:
    [PATCH v1 00/12] mm/memory_hotplug: "auto-movable" online policy and memory
    groups.
    
    These patches make sense even without the other series, therefore I pulled
    them out to make the other series easier to digest.
    
    [1] https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210607195430.48228-1-david@redhat.com
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    Checkpatch complained on a follow-up patch that we are using "unsigned"
    here, which defaults to "unsigned int" and checkpatch is correct.
    
    As we will search for a fitting zone using the wrong pfn, we might end
    up onlining memory to one of the special kernel zones, such as ZONE_DMA,
    which can end badly as the onlined memory does not satisfy properties of
    these zones.
    
    Use "unsigned long" instead, just as we do in other places when handling
    PFNs.  This can bite us once we have physical addresses in the range of
    multiple TB.

    hugetlb: fix hugetlb cgroup refcounting during vma split
    
    commit 09a26e832705fdb7a9484495b71a05e0bbc65207 upstream.
    
    Guillaume Morin reported hitting the following WARNING followed by GPF or
    NULL pointer deference either in cgroups_destroy or in the kill_css path.:
    
        percpu ref (css_release) <= 0 (-1) after switching to atomic

           ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30
    
    Upon further examination, it was discovered that the css structure was
    associated with hugetlb reservations.
    
    For private hugetlb mappings the vma points to a reserve map that
    contains a pointer to the css.  At mmap time, reservations are set up
    and a reference to the css is taken.  This reference is dropped in the
    vma close operation; hugetlb_vm_op_close.  However, if a vma is split no
    additional reference to the css is taken yet hugetlb_vm_op_close will be
    called twice for the split vma resulting in an underflow.
    
    Fix by taking another reference in hugetlb_vm_op_open.  Note that the
    reference is only taken for the owner of the reserve map.  In the more
    common fork case, the pointer to the reserve map is cleared for
    non-owning vmas.

    mm: fix panic caused by __page_handle_poison()
    
    commit f87060d345232c7d855167a43faf006e24afa999 upstream.
    
    In commit 510d25c92ec4 ("mm/hwpoison: disable pcp for
    page_handle_poison()"), __page_handle_poison() was introduced, and if we
    mark:
    
    RET_A = dissolve_free_huge_page();
    RET_B = take_page_off_buddy();
    
    then __page_handle_poison was supposed to return TRUE When RET_A == 0 &&
    RET_B == TRUE
    
    But since it failed to take care the case when RET_A is -EBUSY or -ENOMEM,
    and just return the ret as a bool which actually become TRUE, it break the
    original logic.
    
    The following result is a huge page in freelist but was
    referenced as poisoned, and lead into the final panic:

    s390/topology: fix topology information when calling cpu hotplug notifiers
    
    commit a052096bdd6809eeab809202726634d1ac975aa1 upstream.
    
    The cpu hotplug notifiers are called without updating the core/thread
    masks when a new CPU is added. This causes problems with code setting
    up data structures in a cpu hotplug notifier, and relying on that later
    in normal code.
    
    This caused a crash in the new core scheduling code (SCHED_CORE),
    where rq->core was set up in a notifier depending on cpu masks.
    
    To fix this, add a cpu_setup_mask which is used in update_cpu_masks()
    instead of the cpu_online_mask to determine whether the cpu masks should
    be set for a certain cpu. Also move update_cpu_masks() to update the
    masks before calling notify_cpu_starting() so that the notifiers are
    seeing the updated masks.

    s390/pv: fix the forcing of the swiotlb
    
    commit 93ebb6828723b8aef114415c4dc3518342f7dcad upstream.
    
    Since commit 903cd0f315fe ("swiotlb: Use is_swiotlb_force_bounce for
    swiotlb data bouncing") if code sets swiotlb_force it needs to do so
    before the swiotlb is initialised. Otherwise
    io_tlb_default_mem->force_bounce will not get set to true, and devices
    that use (the default) swiotlb will not bounce despite switolb_force
    having the value of SWIOTLB_FORCE.
    
    Let us restore swiotlb functionality for PV by fulfilling this new
    requirement.
    
    This change addresses what turned out to be a fragility in
    commit 64e1f0c531d1 ("s390/mm: force swiotlb for protected
    virtualization"), which ain't exactly broken in its original context,
    but could give us some more headache if people backport the broken
    change and forget this fix.

    commit f34ee9cb2c5ac5af426fee6fa4591a34d187e696 upstream.
    
    In the numa=off kernel command-line configuration init_chip_info() loops
    around the number of chips and attempts to copy the cpumask of that node
    which is NULL for all iterations after the first chip.
    
    Hence, store the cpu mask for each chip instead of derving cpumask from
    node while populating the "chips" struct array and copy that to the
    chips[i].mask

    scsi: qla2xxx: Sync queue idx with queue_pair_map idx
    
    commit c8fadf019964d0eb1da410ba8b629494d3339db9 upstream.
    
    The first invocation of function find_first_zero_bit will return 0 and
    queue_id gets set to 0.
    
    An index of queue_pair_map also gets set to 0.
    
            qpair_id = find_first_zero_bit(ha->qpair_qid_map, ha->max_qpairs);
    
            set_bit(qpair_id, ha->qpair_qid_map);
            ha->queue_pair_map[qpair_id] = qpair;
    
    In the alloc_queue callback driver checks the map, if queue is already
    allocated:
    
            ha->queue_pair_map[qidx]
    
    This works fine as long as max_qpairs is greater than nvme_max_hw_queues(8)
    since the size of the queue_pair_map is equal to max_qpair. In case nr_cpus
    is less than 8, max_qpairs is less than 8. This creates wrong value
    returned as qpair.

    printk/console: Check consistent sequence number when handling race in console_unlock()
    
    commit 11e4b63abbe23872b45f325a7c6c8b7f9ff42cad upstream.
    
    The standard printk() tries to flush the message to the console
    immediately. It tries to take the console lock. If the lock is
    already taken then the current owner is responsible for flushing
    even the new message.
    
    There is a small race window between checking whether a new message is
    available and releasing the console lock. It is solved by re-checking
    the state after releasing the console lock. If the check is positive
    then console_unlock() tries to take the lock again and process the new
    message as well.
    
    The commit 996e966640ddea7b535c ("printk: remove logbuf_lock") causes that
    console_seq is not longer read atomically. As a result, the re-check might
    be done with an inconsistent 64-bit index.
    
    Solve it by using the last sequence number that has been checked under
    the console lock. In the worst case, it will take the lock again only
    to realized that the new message has already been proceed. But it
    was possible even before.
    
    The variable next_seq is marked as __maybe_unused to call down compiler
    warning when CONFIG_PRINTK is not defined.

    parisc: Fix compile failure when building 64-bit kernel natively
    
    commit 5f6e0fe01b6b33894cf6f61b359ab5a6d2b7674e upstream.
    
    Commit 23243c1ace9f ("arch: use cross_compiling to check whether it is
    a cross build or not") broke 64-bit parisc builds on 32-bit parisc
    systems.
    
    Helge mentioned:
      - 64-bit parisc userspace is not supported yet [1]
      - hppa gcc does not support "-m64" flag [2]
    
    That means, parisc developers working on a 32-bit parisc machine need
    to use hppa64-linux-gnu-gcc (cross compiler) for building the 64-bit
    parisc kernel.
    
    After the offending commit, gcc is used in such a case because
    both $(SRCARCH) and $(SUBARCH) are 'parisc', hence cross_compiling is
    unset.
    
    A correct way is to introduce ARCH=parisc64 because building the 64-bit
    parisc kernel on a 32-bit parisc system is not exactly a native build,
    but rather a semi-cross build.

    parisc: fix crash with signals and alloca
    
    commit 030f653078316a9cc9ca6bd1b0234dcf858be35d upstream.
    
    I was debugging some crashes on parisc and I found out that there is a
    crash possibility if a function using alloca is interrupted by a signal.
    The reason for the crash is that the gcc alloca implementation leaves
    garbage in the upper 32 bits of the sp register. This normally doesn't
    matter (the upper bits are ignored because the PSW W-bit is clear),
    however the signal delivery routine in the kernel uses full 64 bits of sp
    and it fails with -EFAULT if the upper 32 bits are not zero.
    
    I created this program that demonstrates the problem:
    
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <signal.h>
    #include <alloca.h>
    
    static __attribute__((noinline,noclone)) void aa(int *size)
    {
            void * volatile p = alloca(-*size);
            while (1) ;
    }
    
    static void handler(int sig)
    {
            write(1, "signal delivered\n", 17);
            _exit(0);
    }
    
    int main(void)
    {
            int size = -0x100;
            signal(SIGALRM, handler);
            alarm(1);
            aa(&size);
    }
    
    If you compile it with optimizations, it will crash.
    The "aa" function has this disassembly:
    
    000106a0 <aa>:
       106a0:       08 03 02 41     copy r3,r1

       106ac:       37 dc 3f c1     ldo -20(sp),ret0

    ath9k: fix sleeping in atomic context
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c48662b9d56666219f526a71ace8c15e6e12f1f ]
    
    The problem is that gpio_free() can sleep and the cfg_soc() can be
    called with spinlocks held. One problematic call tree is:
    
    --> ath_reset_internal() takes &sc->sc_pcu_lock spin lock
       --> ath9k_hw_reset()
          --> ath9k_hw_gpio_request_in()
             --> ath9k_hw_gpio_request()
                --> ath9k_hw_gpio_cfg_soc()
    
    Remove gpio_free(), use error message instead, so we should make sure
    there is no GPIO conflict.
    
    Also remove ath9k_hw_gpio_free() from ath9k_hw_apply_gpio_override(),
    as gpio_mask will never be set for SOC chips.

    ath9k: fix OOB read ar9300_eeprom_restore_internal
    
    [ Upstream commit 23151b9ae79e3bc4f6a0c4cd3a7f355f68dad128 ]
    
    Bad header can have large length field which can cause OOB.
    cptr is the last bytes for read, and the eeprom is parsed
    from high to low address. The OOB, triggered by the condition
    length > cptr could cause memory error with a read on
    negative index.
    
    There are some sanity check around length, but it is not
    compared with cptr (the remaining bytes). Here, the
    corrupted/bad EEPROM can cause panic.
    
    I was able to reproduce the crash, but I cannot find the
    log and the reproducer now. After I applied the patch, the
    bug is no longer reproducible.

    wcn36xx: Fix missing frame timestamp for beacon/probe-resp
    
    [ Upstream commit 8678fd31f2d3eb14f2b8b39c9bc266f16fa24b22 ]
    
    When receiving a beacon or probe response, we should update the
    boottime_ns field which is the timestamp the frame was received at.
    (cf mac80211.h)
    
    This fixes a scanning issue with Android since it relies on this

    iwlwifi: mvm: don't schedule the roc_done_wk if it is already running
    
    [ Upstream commit a76b57311b1a247e31b055872d021c38707dc3a8 ]
    
    When P2P roc is removed, the IWL_MVM_STATUS_NEED_FLUSH_P2P bit is set
    to indicate to iwl_mvm_roc_done_wk() that the removed roc is a P2P
    one, so it will flush the broadcast station and not the aux station.
    
    However, since setting this bit and scheduling the worker is done
    in roc ended flow as well as in case the roc is removed, there is
    a race where the worker has already started running (but did not
    test this bit yet) and then it is scheduled again. In this case,
    the first run of the worker will clear this bit, and thus the second
    run will find it already cleared and will try to flush and remove
    the aux station by mistake.
    
    Fix it by scheduling the worker only if this bit is not yet set. In
    case this bit is already set, the worker is either running or
    scheduled, so there is no need to re-schedule it.

    iwlwifi: mvm: avoid static queue number aliasing
    
    [ Upstream commit c6ce1c74ef2923b8ffd85f7f8b486f804f343b39 ]
    
    When TVQM is enabled (iwl_mvm_has_new_tx_api() is true), then
    queue numbers are just sequentially assigned 0, 1, 2, ...
    Prior to TVQM, in DQA, there were some statically allocated
    queue numbers:
     * IWL_MVM_DQA_AUX_QUEUE == 1,
     * both IWL_MVM_DQA_INJECT_MONITOR_QUEUE and
       IWL_MVM_DQA_P2P_DEVICE_QUEUE == 2, and
     * IWL_MVM_DQA_AP_PROBE_RESP_QUEUE == 9.
    
    Now, these values are assigned to the members mvm->aux_queue,
    mvm->snif_queue, mvm->probe_queue and mvm->p2p_dev_queue by
    default. Normally, this doesn't really matter, and if TVQM is
    in fact available we override them to the real values after
    allocating a queue for use there.
    
    However, this allocation doesn't always happen. For example,
    for mvm->p2p_dev_queue (== 2) it only happens when the P2P
    Device interface is started, if any. If it's not started, the
    value in mvm->p2p_dev_queue remains 2. This wouldn't really
    matter all that much if it weren't for iwl_mvm_is_static_queue()
    which checks a queue number against one of those four static
    numbers.
    
    Now, if no P2P Device or monitor interface is added then queue
    2 may be dynamically allocated, yet alias mvm->p2p_dev_queue or
    mvm->snif_queue, and thus iwl_mvm_is_static_queue() erroneously
    returns true for it. If it then gets full, all interface queues
    are stopped, instead of just backpressuring against the one TXQ
    that's really the only affected one.
    
    This clearly can lead to issues, as everything is stopped even
    if just a single TXQ filled its corresponding HW queue, if it
    happens to have an appropriate number (2 or 9, AUX is always
    reassigned.) Due to a mac80211 bug, this also led to a situation
    in which the queues remained stopped across a deauthentication
    and then attempts to connect to a new AP started failing, but
    that's fixed separately.
    
    Fix all of this by simply initializing the queue numbers to
    the invalid value until they're used, if TVQM is enabled, and
    also setting them back to that value when the queues are later
    freed again.

    iwlwifi: pcie: free RBs during configure
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ac5720086c8b176794eb74c5cc09f8b79017f38 ]
    
    When switching op-modes, or more generally when reconfiguring,
    we might switch the RB size. In _iwl_pcie_rx_init() we have a
    comment saying we must free all RBs since we might switch the
    size, but this is actually too late: the switch has been done
    and we'll free the buffers with the wrong size.
    
    Fix this by always freeing the buffers, if any, at the start
    of configure, instead of only after the size may have changed.

    nfs: don't atempt blocking locks on nfs reexports
    
    [ Upstream commit f657f8eef3ff870552c9fd2839e0061046f44618 ]
    
    NFS implements blocking locks by blocking inside its lock method.  In
    the reexport case, this blocks the nfs server thread, which could lead
    to deadlocks since an nfs server thread might be required to unlock the
    conflicting lock.  It also causes a crash, since the nfs server thread
    assumes it can free the lock when its lm_notify lock callback is called.
    
    Ideal would be to make the nfs lock method return without blocking in
    this case, but for now it works just not to attempt blocking locks.  The
    difference is just that the original client will have to poll (as it
    does in the v4.0 case) instead of getting a callback when the lock's
    available.

    drm/amdkfd: Account for SH/SE count when setting up cu masks.
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ec06c2dee679e9f089e78ed20cb74ee90155f61 ]
    
    On systems with multiple SH per SE compute_static_thread_mgmt_se#
    is split into independent masks, one for each SH, in the upper and
    lower 16 bits.  We need to detect this and apply cu masking to each
    SH.  The cu mask bits are assigned first to each SE, then to
    alternate SHs, then finally to higher CU id.  This ensures that
    the maximum number of SPIs are engaged as early as possible while
    balancing CU assignment to each SH.
    
    v2: Use max SH/SE rather than max SH in cu_per_sh.
    
    v3: Fix comment blocks, ensure se_mask is initially zero filled,
        and correctly assign se.sh.cu positions to unset bits in cu_mask.

    ASoC: soc-pcm: protect BE dailink state changes in trigger
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c75fc7193387776c10f7c7b440d93496e3d5e21 ]
    
    When more than one FE is connected to a BE, e.g. in a mixing use case,
    the BE can be triggered multiple times when the FE are opened/started
    concurrently. This race condition is problematic in the case of
    SoundWire BE dailinks, and this is not desirable in a general
    case. The code carefully checks when the BE can be stopped or
    hw_free'ed, but the trigger code does not use any mutual exclusion.
    
    Fix by using the same spinlock already used to check FE states, and
    set the state before the trigger. In case of errors,  the initial
    state will be restored.
    
    This patch does not change how the triggers are handled, it only makes
    sure the states are handled in critical sections.

    usb: xhci-mtk: Do not use xhci's virt_dev in drop_endpoint
    
    [ Upstream commit b8731209958a1dffccc2888121f4c0280c990550 ]
    
    xhci-mtk depends on xhci's internal virt_dev when it retrieves its
    internal data from usb_host_endpoint both in add_endpoint and
    drop_endpoint callbacks. But when setup packet was retired by
    transaction errors in xhci_setup_device() path, a virt_dev for the slot
    is newly created with real_port 0. This leads to xhci-mtks's NULL pointer
    dereference from drop_endpoint callback as xhci-mtk assumes that virt_dev's
    real_port is always started from one. The similar problems were addressed
    by [1] but that can't cover the failure cases from setup_device.
    
    This patch drops the usages of xhci's virt_dev in xhci-mtk's drop_endpoint
    callback by adopting rhashtable for searching mtk's schedule entity
    from a given usb_host_endpoint pointer instead of searching a linked list.
    So mtk's drop_endpoint callback doesn't have to rely on virt_dev at all.

    usbip:vhci_hcd USB port can get stuck in the disabled state
    
    [ Upstream commit 66cce9e73ec61967ed1f97f30cee79bd9a2bb7ee ]
    
    When a remote usb device is attached to the local Virtual USB
    Host Controller Root Hub port, the bound device driver may send
    a port reset command.
    
    vhci_hcd accepts port resets only when the device doesn't have
    port address assigned to it. When reset happens device is in
    assigned/used state and vhci_hcd rejects it leaving the port in
    a stuck state.
    
    This problem was found when a blue-tooth or xbox wireless dongle
    was passed through using usbip.
    
    A few drivers reset the port during probe including mt76 driver
    specific to this bug report. Fix the problem with a change to
    honor reset requests when device is in used state (VDEV_ST_USED).

    Revert "USB: xhci: fix U1/U2 handling for hardware with XHCI_INTEL_HOST quirk set"
    
    [ Upstream commit 2847c46c61486fd8bca9136a6e27177212e78c69 ]
    
    This reverts commit 5d5323a6f3625f101dbfa94ba3ef7706cce38760.
    
    That commit effectively disabled Intel host initiated U1/U2 lpm for devices
    with periodic endpoints.
    
    Before that commit we disabled host initiated U1/U2 lpm if the exit latency
    was larger than any periodic endpoint service interval, this is according
    to xhci spec xhci 1.1 specification section 4.23.5.2
    
    After that commit we incorrectly checked that service interval was smaller
    than U1/U2 inactivity timeout. This is not relevant, and can't happen for
    Intel hosts as previously set U1/U2 timeout = 105% * service interval.
    
    Patch claimed it solved cases where devices can't be enumerated because of

    samples: pktgen: fix to print when terminated normally
    
    [ Upstream commit c0e9422c4e6ca9abd4bd6e1598400c7231eb600b ]
    
    Currently, most pktgen samples print the execution result when the
    program is terminated normally. However, sample03 doesn't work
    appropriately.
    
    This is results of samples:
    
        # DEV=eth0 DEST_IP=10.1.0.1 DST_MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55 ./pktgen_sample04_many_flows.sh -n 1
        Running... ctrl^C to stop
        Device: eth0@0
        Result: OK: 19(c5+d13) usec, 1 (60byte,0frags)
        51762pps 24Mb/sec (24845760bps) errors: 0
    
        # DEV=eth0 DEST_IP=10.1.0.1 DST_MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55 ./pktgen_sample03_burst_single_flow.sh -n 1
        Running... ctrl^C to stop
    
    The reason why it doesn't print the execution result when the program is
    terminated usually is that sample03 doesn't call the function which
    prints the result, unlike other samples.
    
    So, this commit solves this issue by calling the function before
    termination. Also, this commit changes control_c function to
    print_result to maintain consistency with other samples.

    mmc: core: Return correct emmc response in case of ioctl error
    
    [ Upstream commit e72a55f2e5ddcfb3dce0701caf925ce435b87682 ]
    
    When a read/write command is sent via ioctl to the kernel,
    and the command fails, the actual error response of the emmc
    is not sent to the user.
    
    IOCTL read/write tests are carried out using commands
    17 (Single BLock Read), 24 (Single Block Write),
    18 (Multi Block Read), 25 (Multi Block Write)
    
    The tests are carried out on a 64Gb emmc device. All of these
    tests try to access an "out of range" sector address (0x09B2FFFF).
    
    It is seen that without the patch the response received by the user
    is not OUT_OF_RANGE error (R1 response 31st bit is not set) as per
    JEDEC specification. After applying the patch proper response is seen.
    This is because the function returns without copying the response to
    the user in case of failure. This patch fixes the issue.
    
    Hence, this memcpy is required whether we get an error response or not.
    Therefor it is moved up from the current position up to immediately
    after we have called mmc_wait_for_req().
    
    The test code and the output of only the CMD17 is included in the
    commit to limit the message length.
    
    CMD17 (Test Code Snippet):
    ==========================
            printf("Forming CMD%d\n", opt_idx);
            /*  single block read */

            cmd.blocks = 1;
            cmd.write_flag = 0;
            cmd.opcode = 17;
            //cmd.arg = atoi(argv[3]);
            cmd.arg = 0x09B2FFFF;
            /* Expecting response R1B */
            cmd.flags = MMC_RSP_SPI_R1 | MMC_RSP_R1 | MMC_CMD_ADTC;
    
            memset(data, 0, sizeof(__u8) * 512);
            mmc_ioc_cmd_set_data(cmd, data);
    
            printf("Sending CMD%d: ARG[0x%08x]\n", opt_idx, cmd.arg);
            if(ioctl(fd, MMC_IOC_CMD, &cmd))
                    perror("Error");
    
            printf("\nResponse: %08x\n", cmd.response[0]);

    In practice, i tried to pin it to only one cpu by 'taskset 0x01 ./test_maps',
    and knew 10S is likely enough, but i still perfer to a larger value 30.

    mmc: rtsx_pci: Fix long reads when clock is prescaled
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ac5e45291f3f0d699a721357380d4593bc2dcb3 ]
    
    For unexplained reasons, the prescaler register for this device needs to
    be cleared (set to 1) while performing a data read or else the command
    will hang. This does not appear to affect the real clock rate sent out
    on the bus, so I assume it's purely to work around a hardware bug.
    
    During normal operation, the prescaler is already set to 1, so nothing
    needs to be done. However, in "initial mode" (which is used for sub-MHz
    clock speeds, like the core sets while enumerating cards), it's set to
    128 and so we need to reset it during data reads. We currently fail to
    do this for long reads.
    
    This has no functional affect on the driver's operation currently
    written, as the MMC core always sets a clock above 1MHz before
    attempting any long reads. However, the core could conceivably set any
    clock speed at any time and the driver should still work, so I think
    this fix is worthwhile.
    
    I personally encountered this issue while performing data recovery on an
    external chip. My connections had poor signal integrity, so I modified
    the core code to reduce the clock speed. Without this change, I saw the
    card enumerate but was unable to actually read any data.
    
    Writes don't seem to work in the situation described above even with
    this change (and even if the workaround is extended to encompass data
    write commands). I was not able to find a way to get them working.

    soundwire: intel: fix potential race condition during power down
    
    [ Upstream commit ea6942dad4b2a7e1735aa0f10f3d0b04b847750f ]
    
    The power down sequence sets the link_up flag as false outside of the
    mutex_lock. This is potentially unsafe.
    
    In additional the flow in that sequence can be improved by first
    testing if the link was powered, setting the link_up flag as false and
    proceeding with the power down. In case the CPA bits cannot be
    cleared, we only flag an error since we cannot deal with interrupts
    any longer.

    btrfs: tree-log: check btrfs_lookup_data_extent return value
    
    [ Upstream commit 3736127a3aa805602b7a2ad60ec9cfce68065fbb ]
    
    Function btrfs_lookup_data_extent calls btrfs_search_slot to verify if
    the EXTENT_ITEM exists in the extent tree. btrfs_search_slot can return
    values bellow zero if an error happened.
    
    Function replay_one_extent currently checks if the search found
    something (0 returned) and increments the reference, and if not, it
    seems to evaluate as 'not found'.
    
    Fix the condition by checking if the value was bellow zero and return
    early.

    btrfs: remove racy and unnecessary inode transaction update when using no-holes
    
    [ Upstream commit cceaa89f02f15f232391ae4be214137b0a0285c0 ]
    
    When using the NO_HOLES feature and expanding the size of an inode, we
    update the inode's last_trans, last_sub_trans and last_log_commit fields
    at maybe_insert_hole() so that a fsync does know that the inode needs to
    be logged (by making sure that btrfs_inode_in_log() returns false). This
    happens for expanding truncate operations, buffered writes, direct IO
    writes and when cloning extents to an offset greater than the inode's
    i_size.
    
    However the way we do it is racy, because in between setting the inode's
    last_sub_trans and last_log_commit fields, the log transaction ID that was
    assigned to last_sub_trans might be committed before we read the root's
    last_log_commit and assign that value to last_log_commit. If that happens
    it would make a future call to btrfs_inode_in_log() return true. This is
    a race that should be extremely unlikely to be hit in practice, and it is
    the same that was described by commit bc0939fcfab0d7 ("btrfs: fix race
    between marking inode needs to be logged and log syncing").
    
    The fix would simply be to set last_log_commit to the value we assigned
    to last_sub_trans minus 1, like it was done in that commit. However
    updating these two fields plus the last_trans field is pointless here
    because all the callers of btrfs_cont_expand() (which is the only
    caller of maybe_insert_hole()) always call btrfs_set_inode_last_trans()
    or btrfs_update_inode() after calling btrfs_cont_expand(). Calling either
    btrfs_set_inode_last_trans() or btrfs_update_inode() guarantees that the
    next fsync will log the inode, as it makes btrfs_inode_in_log() return
    false.
    
    So just remove the code that explicitly sets the inode's last_trans,
    last_sub_trans and last_log_commit fields.

    As far as I can tell, this is a bug with the m68kmmu architecture, not
    with my driver:
    The CONFIG_ISA_DMA_API option is provided for coldfire, which implements it,
    but dragonball also sets the option as a side-effect, without actually
    implementing
    the interfaces. The patch below should fix it.

    In current wow flow, driver calls rtw_wow_fw_start and sleep for 100ms,
    to wait firmware finish preliminary work and then update the value of

    function with power-saving mode, in which mode the value of

    Locks have two sets of op arrays, fl_lmops for the lock manager (lockd
    or nfsd), fl_ops for the filesystem.  The server-side lockd code has
    been setting its own fl_ops, which leads to confusion (and crashes) in
    the reexport case, where the filesystem expects to be the only one
    setting fl_ops.
    
    And there's no reason for it that I can see-the lm_get/put_owner ops do
    the same job.

    gfs2: Don't call dlm after protocol is unmounted
    
    [ Upstream commit d1340f80f0b8066321b499a376780da00560e857 ]
    
    In the gfs2 withdraw sequence, the dlm protocol is unmounted with a call
    to lm_unmount. After a withdraw, users are allowed to unmount the
    withdrawn file system. But at that point we may still have glocks left
    over that we need to free via unmount's call to gfs2_gl_hash_clear.
    These glocks may have never been completed because of whatever problem
    caused the withdraw (IO errors or whatever).
    
    Before this patch, function gdlm_put_lock would still try to call into
    dlm to unlock these leftover glocks, which resulted in dlm returning
    -EINVAL because the lock space was abandoned. These glocks were never
    freed because there was no mechanism after that to free them.
    
    This patch adds a check to gdlm_put_lock to see if the locking protocol
    was inactive (DFL_UNMOUNT flag) and if so, free the glock and not
    make the invalid call into dlm.
    
    I could have combined this "if" with the one that follows, related to
    leftover glock LVBs, but I felt the code was more readable with its own
    if clause.

    for all clk without checking NULL. In other words, all adg->clk[i]
    should not NULL.
    
    Some SoC might doesn't have clk_a/b/c/i. devm_clk_get() returns error in
    such case. This driver calls rsnd_adg_null_clk_get() and use null_clk
    instead of NULL in such cases.
    
    But devm_clk_get() might returns NULL even though such clocks exist, but
    it doesn't mean error (user deliberately chose to disable the feature).
    NULL clk itself is not error from clk point of view, but is error from
    this driver point of view because it is not assuming such case.
    
    But current code is using IS_ERR() which doesn't care NULL.
    This driver uses IS_ERR_OR_NULL() instead of IS_ERR() for clk check.
    And it uses ERR_CAST() to clarify null_clk error.
    
    One concern here is that it unconditionally uses null_clk if clk_a/b/c/i
    was error. It is correct if it doesn't exist, but is not correct if it
    returns error even though it exist.
    It needs to check "clock-names" from DT before calling devm_clk_get() to
    handling such case. But let's assume it is overkill so far.

    net: Fix offloading indirect devices dependency on qdisc order creation
    
    [ Upstream commit 74fc4f828769cca1c3be89ea92cb88feaa27ef52 ]
    
    Currently, when creating an ingress qdisc on an indirect device before
    the driver registered for callbacks, the driver will not have a chance
    to register its filter configuration callbacks.
    
    To fix that, modify the code such that it keeps track of all the ingress
    qdiscs that call flow_indr_dev_setup_offload(). When a driver calls
    flow_indr_dev_register(),  go through the list of tracked ingress qdiscs
    and call the driver callback entry point so as to give it a chance to
    register its callback.

    selftests/bpf: Fix flaky send_signal test
    
    [ Upstream commit b16ac5bf732a5e23d164cf908ec7742d6a6120d3 ]
    
    libbpf CI has reported send_signal test is flaky although
    I am not able to reproduce it in my local environment.
    But I am able to reproduce with on-demand libbpf CI ([1]).
    
    Through code analysis, the following is possible reason.
    The failed subtest runs bpf program in softirq environment.
    Since bpf_send_signal() only sends to a fork of "test_progs"
    process. If the underlying current task is
    not "test_progs", bpf_send_signal() will not be triggered
    and the subtest will fail.
    
    To reduce the chances where the underlying process is not
    the intended one, this patch boosted scheduling priority to
    -20 (highest allowed by setpriority() call). And I did
    10 runs with on-demand libbpf CI with this patch and I
    didn't observe any failures.

    As follow-up to the discussion with Jakub Kicinski about iavf locking
    being insufficient [1] convert iavf to use mutexes instead of bitops.
    The locking logic is kept as is, just a drop-in replacement of
    enum iavf_critical_section_t with separate mutexes.
    The only difference is that the mutexes will be destroyed before the
    module is unloaded.

    tcp: enable data-less, empty-cookie SYN with TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD
    
    [ Upstream commit e3faa49bcecdfcc80e94dd75709d6acb1a5d89f6 ]
    
    Since the original TFO server code was implemented in commit
    168a8f58059a22feb9e9a2dcc1b8053dbbbc12ef ("tcp: TCP Fast Open Server -
    main code path") the TFO server code has supported the sysctl bit flag
    TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD. Currently, when the TFO_SERVER_ENABLE and
    TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD sysctl bit flags are set, a server connection
    will accept a SYN with N bytes of data (N > 0) that has no TFO cookie,
    create a new fast open connection, process the incoming data in the SYN,
    and make the connection ready for accepting. After accepting, the
    connection is ready for read()/recvmsg() to read the N bytes of data in
    the SYN, ready for write()/sendmsg() calls and data transmissions to
    transmit data.
    
    This commit changes an edge case in this feature by changing this
    behavior to apply to (N >= 0) bytes of data in the SYN rather than only
    (N > 0) bytes of data in the SYN. Now, a server will accept a data-less
    SYN without a TFO cookie if TFO_SERVER_COOKIE_NOT_REQD is set.
    
    Caveat! While this enables a new kind of TFO (data-less empty-cookie
    SYN), some firewall rules setup may not work if they assume such packets
    are not legit TFOs and will filter them.

    iomap: pass writeback errors to the mapping
    
    [ Upstream commit b69eea82d37d9ee7cfb3bf05103549dd4ed5ffc3 ]
    
    Modern-day mapping_set_error has the ability to squash the usual
    negative error code into something appropriate for long-term storage in
    a struct address_space -- ENOSPC becomes AS_ENOSPC, and everything else
    becomes EIO.  iomap squashes /everything/ to EIO, just as XFS did before
    that, but this doesn't make sense.
    
    Fix this by making it so that we can pass ENOSPC to userspace when
    writeback fails due to space problems.

    On receiving event for first NOP, the work scheduled on hdev->cmd_timer
    is not cancelled and second NOP is dequeued and sent to controller.
    
    While waiting for an event for second NOP command, work scheduled on
    cmd_timer for the first NOP can get scheduled, resulting in sending third
    NOP command (sending back to back NOP commands). This might
    cause issues at controller side (like memory overrun, controller going
    unresponsive) resulting in hci tx timeouts, hardware errors etc.
    
    The fix to this issue is to cancel the delayed work scheduled on
    cmd_timer on receiving command status or command complete event for
    NOP command (this patch handles NOP command same as any other SIG
    command).

    Bluetooth: Fix handling of LE Enhanced Connection Complete

    LE Enhanced Connection Complete contains the Local RPA used in the
    connection which must be used when set otherwise there could problems
    when pairing since the address used by the remote stack could be the
    Local RPA:

    nvme: code command_id with a genctr for use-after-free validation
    
    [ Upstream commit e7006de6c23803799be000a5dcce4d916a36541a ]
    
    We cannot detect a (perhaps buggy) controller that is sending us
    a completion for a request that was already completed (for example
    sending a completion twice), this phenomenon was seen in the wild
    a few times.
    
    So to protect against this, we use the upper 4 msbits of the nvme sqe
    command_id to use as a 4-bit generation counter and verify it matches
    the existing request generation that is incrementing on every execution.
    
    The 16-bit command_id structure now is constructed by:
    | xxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |
      gen    request tag
    
    This means that we are giving up some possible queue depth as 12 bits
    allow for a maximum queue depth of 4095 instead of 65536, however we
    never create such long queues anyways so no real harm done.

    The GW71xx has a USB Type-C connector with USB 2.0 signaling. GPIO1_12
    is the power-enable to the TPS25821 Source controller and power switch
    responsible for monitoring the CC pins and enabling VBUS. Therefore
    GPIO1_12 must always be enabled and the vbus output enable from the
    IMX8MM can be ignored.
    
    To fix USB OTG VBUS enable a pull-up on GPIO1_12 to always power the
    TPS25821 and change the regulator output to GPIO1_10 which is
    unconnected.

    schematics. USB works fine with both GPIOs being disabled, so remove the
    bogus USB VBUS regulators. The USB VBUS of USB3 is supplied from the fixed
    5v system regulator and device-mode USB1 doesn't have VBUS switches.

    mac80211: Fix monitor MTU limit so that A-MSDUs get through
    
    [ Upstream commit 79f5962baea74ce1cd4e5949598944bff854b166 ]
    
    The maximum MTU was set to 2304, which is the maximum MSDU size. While
    this is valid for normal WLAN interfaces, it is too low for monitor
    interfaces. A monitor interface may receive and inject MPDU frames, and
    the maximum MPDU frame size is larger than 2304. The MPDU may also
    contain an A-MSDU frame, in which case the size may be much larger than
    the MTU limit. Since the maximum size of an A-MSDU depends on the PHY
    mode of the transmitting STA, it is not possible to set an exact MTU
    limit for a monitor interface. Now the maximum MTU for a monitor
    interface is unrestricted.

    Initialize both pre-emphasis and voltage swing level to 0 before
    start link training and do not end link training until video is
    ready to reduce the period between end of link training and video
    start to meet Link Layer CTS requirement.  Some dongle main link

    soon enough after completion of link training 2. Host have to re
    train main link if loss of symbol locked detected before end link
    training so that the coming video stream can be transmitted to sink
    properly. This fixes Link Layer CTS cases 4.3.2.1, 4.3.2.2, 4.3.2.3

    Chain exists of:
      sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_SCO --> &hdev->lock --> hci_cb_list_lock
    
     Possible unsafe locking scenario:
    
           CPU0                    CPU1
           ----                    ----
      lock(hci_cb_list_lock);
                                   lock(&hdev->lock);
                                   lock(hci_cb_list_lock);
      lock(sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_SCO);
    
     *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    The issue is that the lock hierarchy should go from &hdev->lock -->
    hci_cb_list_lock --> sk_lock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_SCO. For example,
    one such call trace is:
    
      hci_dev_do_close():
        hci_dev_lock();
        hci_conn_hash_flush():
          hci_disconn_cfm():
            mutex_lock(&hci_cb_list_lock);
            sco_disconn_cfm():
            sco_conn_del():
              lock_sock(sk);
    
    However, in sco_sock_connect, we call lock_sock before calling
    hci_dev_lock inside sco_connect, thus inverting the lock hierarchy.
    
    We fix this by pulling the call to hci_dev_lock out from sco_connect.

    Bluetooth: schedule SCO timeouts with delayed_work
    
    [ Upstream commit ba316be1b6a00db7126ed9a39f9bee434a508043 ]
    
    struct sock.sk_timer should be used as a sock cleanup timer. However,
    SCO uses it to implement sock timeouts.
    
    This causes issues because struct sock.sk_timer's callback is run in
    an IRQ context, and the timer callback function sco_sock_timeout takes
    a spin lock on the socket. However, other functions such as
    sco_conn_del and sco_conn_ready take the spin lock with interrupts
    enabled.
    
    This inconsistent {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} -> {IN-SOFTIRQ-W} lock usage could
    lead to deadlocks as reported by Syzbot [1]:
           CPU0
           ----
      lock(slock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_SCO);
      <Interrupt>
        lock(slock-AF_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO_SCO);
    
    To fix this, we use delayed work to implement SCO sock timouts
    instead. This allows us to avoid taking the spin lock on the socket in
    an IRQ context, and corrects the misuse of struct sock.sk_timer.
    
    As a note, cancel_delayed_work is used instead of
    cancel_delayed_work_sync in sco_sock_set_timer and
    sco_sock_clear_timer to avoid a deadlock. In the future, the call to
    bh_lock_sock inside sco_sock_timeout should be changed to lock_sock to
    synchronize with other functions using lock_sock. However, since
    sco_sock_set_timer and sco_sock_clear_timer are sometimes called under
    the locked socket (in sco_connect and __sco_sock_close),
    cancel_delayed_work_sync might cause them to sleep until an
    sco_sock_timeout that has started finishes running. But
    sco_sock_timeout would also sleep until it can grab the lock_sock.
    
    Using cancel_delayed_work is fine because sco_sock_timeout does not
    change from run to run, hence there is no functional difference
    between:
    1. waiting for a timeout to finish running before scheduling another
    timeout
    2. scheduling another timeout while a timeout is running.

    AMD host router has lane adapters at 2 and 3 and link ports at adapter 2
    is not considered due to which lane bonding gets disabled.

    drm: xlnx: zynqmp: release reset to DP controller before accessing DP registers
    
    [ Upstream commit a338619bd76011035d462f0f9e8b2f24d7fe5a1e ]
    
    When insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko after rmmod it, system will hang with the
    error log as below:
    
    root@xilinx-zynqmp:~# insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko
    [   88.391289] [drm] Initialized zynqmp-dpsub 1.0.0 20130509 for fd4a0000.display on minor 0

    root@xilinx-zynqmp:~# insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko
            <hang here>
    
    This is because that in zynqmp_dp_probe it tries to access some DP
    registers while the DP controller is still in the reset state. When
    running "rmmod zynqmp_dpsub", zynqmp_dp_reset(dp, true) in
    zynqmp_dp_phy_exit is called to force the DP controller into the reset
    state. Then insmod will call zynqmp_dp_probe to program the DP registers,
    but at this moment the DP controller hasn't been brought out of the reset
    state yet since the function zynqmp_dp_reset(dp, false) is called later and
    this will result the system hang.
    
    Releasing the reset to DP controller before any read/write operation to it
    will fix this issue. And for symmetry, move zynqmp_dp_reset() call from
    zynqmp_dp_phy_exit() to zynqmp_dp_remove().

    drm: xlnx: zynqmp_dpsub: Call pm_runtime_get_sync before setting pixel clock
    
    [ Upstream commit a19effb6dbe5bd1be77a6d68eba04dba8993ffeb ]
    
    The Runtime PM subsystem will force the device "fd4a0000.zynqmp-display"
    to enter suspend state while booting if the following conditions are met:
    - the usage counter is zero (pm_runtime_get_sync hasn't been called yet)
    - no 'active' children (no zynqmp-dp-snd-xx node under dpsub node)
    - no other device in the same power domain (dpdma node has no
                    "power-domains = <&zynqmp_firmware PD_DP>" property)
    
    So there is a scenario as below:
    1) DP device enters suspend state   <- call zynqmp_gpd_power_off
    2) zynqmp_disp_crtc_setup_clock     <- configurate register VPLL_FRAC_CFG
    3) pm_runtime_get_sync              <- call zynqmp_gpd_power_on and clear previous
                                           VPLL_FRAC_CFG configuration
    4) clk_prepare_enable(disp->pclk)   <- enable failed since VPLL_FRAC_CFG
                                           configuration is corrupted
    
    From above, we can see that pm_runtime_get_sync may clear register
    VPLL_FRAC_CFG configuration and result the failure of clk enabling.
    Putting pm_runtime_get_sync at the very beginning of the function

    net: ethernet: stmmac: Do not use unreachable() in ipq806x_gmac_probe()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4367355dd90942a71641c98c40c74589c9bddf90 ]
    
    When compiling with clang in certain configurations, an objtool warning
    appears:
    
    drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac-ipq806x.o: warning: objtool:
    ipq806x_gmac_probe() falls through to next function phy_modes()
    
    This happens because the unreachable annotation in the third switch
    statement is not eliminated. The compiler should know that the first
    default case would prevent the second and third from being reached as
    the comment notes but sanitizer options can make it harder for the
    compiler to reason this out.
    
    Help the compiler out by eliminating the unreachable() annotation and
    unifying the default case error handling so that there is no objtool
    warning, the meaning of the code stays the same, and there is less
    duplication.

    nvmem: qfprom: Fix up qfprom_disable_fuse_blowing() ordering
    
    [ Upstream commit 11c4b3e264d68ba6dcd52d12dbcfd3f564f2f137 ]
    
    qfprom_disable_fuse_blowing() disables a bunch of resources,
    and then does a few register writes in the 'conf' address
    space.
    It works perhaps because the resources are needed only for the
    'raw' register space writes, and that the 'conf' space allows
    read/writes regardless.
    However that makes the code look confusing, so just move the
    register writes before turning off the resources in the
    function.

    misc: sram: Only map reserved areas in Tegra SYSRAM
    
    [ Upstream commit fec29bf04994b478a43a7e60e6dd5ac1f7cb53ae ]
    
    On Tegra186 and later, a portion of the SYSRAM may be reserved for use
    by TZ. Non-TZ memory accesses to this portion, including speculative
    accesses, trigger SErrors that bring down the system. This does also
    happen in practice occasionally (due to speculative accesses).
    
    To fix the issue, add a flag to the SRAM driver to only map the
    device tree-specified reserved areas depending on a flag set
    based on the compatibility string. This would not affect non-Tegra
    systems that rely on the entire thing being memory mapped.
    
    If 64K pages are being used, we cannot exactly map the 4K regions
    that are placed in SYSRAM - ioremap code instead aligns to closest
    64K pages. However, since in practice the non-accessible memory area
    is 64K aligned, these mappings do not overlap with the non-accessible
    memory area and things work out.

    [ Upstream commit 1fe0e1fa3209ad8e9124147775bd27b1d9f04bd4 ]
    
    Handle optional overrun-throttle-ms property as done for 8250_fsl in commit
    6d7f677a2afa ("serial: 8250: Rate limit serial port rx interrupts during
    input overruns"). This can be used to rate limit the UART interrupts on
    noisy lines that end up producing messages like the following:
    
    ttyS ttyS2: 4 input overrun(s)
    
    At least on droid4, the multiplexed USB and UART port is left to UART mode
    by the bootloader for a debug console, and if a USB charger is connected
    on boot, we get noise on the UART until the PMIC related drivers for PHY
    and charger are loaded.
    
    With this patch and overrun-throttle-ms = <500> we avoid the extra rx
    interrupts.

    gfs2: Fix glock recursion in freeze_go_xmote_bh
    
    [ Upstream commit 9d9b16054b7d357afde69a027514c695092b0d22 ]
    
    We must not call gfs2_consist (which does a file system withdraw) from
    the freeze glock's freeze_go_xmote_bh function because the withdraw
    will try to use the freeze glock, thus causing a glock recursion error.
    
    This patch changes freeze_go_xmote_bh to call function
    gfs2_assert_withdraw_delayed instead of gfs2_consist to avoid recursion.

    These for-loops should test against v4l2_dv_timings_presets[i].bt.width,
    not if i < v4l2_dv_timings_presets[i].bt.width. Luckily nothing ever broke,
    since the smallest width is still a lot higher than the total number of
    presets, but it is wrong.
    
    The last item in the presets array is all 0, so the for-loop must stop
    when it reaches that sentinel.

    When the stream fails to start, the first two buffers in the queue have
    been moved to the active_vb2_buf array and are returned to vb2 by
    imx7_csi_dma_unsetup_vb2_buf(). The function is called with the buffer
    state set to VB2_BUF_STATE_ERROR unconditionally, which is correct when
    stopping the stream, but not when the start operation fails. In that
    case, the state should be set to VB2_BUF_STATE_QUEUED. Fix it.

    media: imx258: Limit the max analogue gain to 480
    
    [ Upstream commit f809665ee75fff3f4ea8907f406a66d380aeb184 ]
    
    The range for analog gain mentioned in the datasheet is [0, 480].
    The real gain formula mentioned in the datasheet is:
    
            Gain = 512 / (512 – X)
    
    Hence, values larger than 511 clearly makes no sense. The gain
    register field is also documented to be of 9-bits in the datasheet.
    
    Certainly, it is enough to infer that, the kernel driver currently
    advertises an arbitrary analog gain max. Fix it by rectifying the
    value as per the data sheet i.e. 480.

    media: imx258: Rectify mismatch of VTS value
    
    [ Upstream commit 51f93add3669f1b1f540de1cf397815afbd4c756 ]
    
    The frame_length_lines (0x0340) registers are hard-coded as follows:
    
    - 4208x3118
      frame_length_lines = 0x0c50
    
    - 2104x1560
      frame_length_lines = 0x0638
    
    - 1048x780
      frame_length_lines = 0x034c
    
    The driver exposes the V4L2_CID_VBLANK control in read-only mode and
    sets its value to vts_def - height, where vts_def is a mode-dependent
    value coming from the supported_modes array. It is set using one of
    the following macros defined in the driver:
    
      #define IMX258_VTS_30FPS                0x0c98
      #define IMX258_VTS_30FPS_2K             0x0638
      #define IMX258_VTS_30FPS_VGA            0x034c
    
    There's a clear mismatch in the value for the full resolution mode i.e.
    IMX258_VTS_30FPS. Fix it by rectifying the macro with the value set for
    the frame_length_lines register as stated above.

    Code was checking if random_addr and hdev->rpa match without first

    clearing HCI_RPA_EXPIRED before the command completes and the RPA is
    actually programmed which in case of failure would leave the expired

    Since advertising instance have a similar problem the clearing of

    address is in fact the hdev->rap and then proceed to set the expire
    timeout.

    ASoC: Intel: update sof_pcm512x quirks
    
    [ Upstream commit 22414cade8dfec25ab94df52b3a4f7aa8edb6120 ]
    
    The default SOF topology enables SSP capture and DMICs, even though
    both of these hardware capabilities are not always available in
    hardware (specific versions of HiFiberry and DMIC kit needed).
    
    For the SSP capture, this leads to annoying "SP5-Codec: ASoC: no
    backend capture" and "streamSSP5-Codec: ASoC: no users capture at
    close - state 0" errors.
    
    Update the quirks to match what the topology needs, which also allows
    for the ability to remove SSP capture and DMIC support.

    bonding: 3ad: fix the concurrency between __bond_release_one() and bond_3ad_state_machine_handler()
    
    [ Upstream commit 220ade77452c15ecb1ab94c3f8aaeb6d033c3582 ]
    
    Some time ago, I reported a calltrace issue
    "did not find a suitable aggregator", please see[1].
    After a period of analysis and reproduction, I find
    that this problem is caused by concurrency.
    
    Before the problem occurs, the bond structure is like follows:
    
    bond0 - slaver0(eth0) - agg0.lag_ports -> port0 - port1
                          \
                            port0
          \
            slaver1(eth1) - agg1.lag_ports -> NULL
                          \
                            port1
    
    If we run 'ifenslave bond0 -d eth1', the process is like below:
    
    excuting __bond_release_one()
    |
    bond_upper_dev_unlink()[step1]
    |                       |                       |
    |                       |                       bond_3ad_lacpdu_recv()
    |                       |                       ->bond_3ad_rx_indication()
    |                       |                       spin_lock_bh()
    |                       |                       ->ad_rx_machine()
    |                       |                       ->__record_pdu()[step2]
    |                       |                       spin_unlock_bh()
    |                       |                       |
    |                       bond_3ad_state_machine_handler()
    |                       spin_lock_bh()
    |                       ->ad_port_selection_logic()
    |                       ->try to find free aggregator[step3]
    |                       ->try to find suitable aggregator[step4]
    |                       ->did not find a suitable aggregator[step5]
    |                       spin_unlock_bh()
    |                       |
    |                       |
    bond_3ad_unbind_slave() |
    spin_lock_bh()
    spin_unlock_bh()
    
    step1: already removed slaver1(eth1) from list, but port1 remains
    step2: receive a lacpdu and update port0
    step3: port0 will be removed from agg0.lag_ports. The struct is
           "agg0.lag_ports -> port1" now, and agg0 is not free. At the
               same time, slaver1/agg1 has been removed from the list by step1.
               So we can't find a free aggregator now.
    step4: can't find suitable aggregator because of step2
    step5: cause a calltrace since port->aggregator is NULL
    
    To solve this concurrency problem, put bond_upper_dev_unlink()
    after bond_3ad_unbind_slave(). In this way, we can invalid the port
    first and skip this port in bond_3ad_state_machine_handler(). This
    eliminates the situation that the slaver has been removed from the
    list but the port is still valid.

    Bluetooth: skip invalid hci_sync_conn_complete_evt
    
    [ Upstream commit 92fe24a7db751b80925214ede43f8d2be792ea7b ]
    
    Syzbot reported a corrupted list in kobject_add_internal [1]. This
    happens when multiple HCI_EV_SYNC_CONN_COMPLETE event packets with
    status 0 are sent for the same HCI connection. This causes us to
    register the device more than once which corrupts the kset list.
    
    As this is forbidden behavior, we add a check for whether we're
    trying to process the same HCI_EV_SYNC_CONN_COMPLETE event multiple
    times for one connection. If that's the case, the event is invalid, so
    we report an error that the device is misbehaving, and ignore the
    packet.

    libbpf: Fix race when pinning maps in parallel
    
    [ Upstream commit 043c5bb3c4f43670ab4fea0b847373ab42d25f3e ]
    
    When loading in parallel multiple programs which use the same to-be
    pinned map, it is possible that two instances of the loader will call
    bpf_object__create_maps() at the same time. If the map doesn't exist
    when both instances call bpf_object__reuse_map(), then one of the
    instances will fail with EEXIST when calling bpf_map__pin().
    
    Fix the race by retrying reusing a map if bpf_map__pin() returns
    EEXIST. The fix is similar to the one in iproute2: e4c4685fd6e4 ("bpf:
    Fix race condition with map pinning").
    
    Before retrying the pinning, we don't do any special cleaning of an
    internal map state. The closer code inspection revealed that it's not
    required:
    
        - bpf_object__create_map(): map->inner_map is destroyed after a
          successful call, map->fd is closed if pinning fails.
        - bpf_object__populate_internal_map(): created map elements is
          destroyed upon close(map->fd).
        - init_map_slots(): slots are freed after their initialization.

    samples: bpf: Fix tracex7 error raised on the missing argument
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d07006f05922b95518be403f08ef8437b67aa32 ]
    
    The current behavior of 'tracex7' doesn't consist with other bpf samples
    tracex{1..6}. Other samples do not require any argument to run with, but
    tracex7 should be run with btrfs device argument. (it should be executed
    with test_override_return.sh)
    
    Currently, tracex7 doesn't have any description about how to run this
    program and raises an unexpected error. And this result might be
    confusing since users might not have a hunch about how to run this
    program.
    
        // Current behavior
        # ./tracex7
        sh: 1: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")
        // Fixed behavior
        # ./tracex7
        ERROR: Run with the btrfs device argument!
    
    In order to fix this error, this commit adds logic to report a message
    and exit when running this program with a missing argument.
    
    Additionally in test_override_return.sh, there is a problem with
    multiple directory(tmpmnt) creation. So in this commit adds a line with
    removing the directory with every execution.

    serial: 8250: Define RX trigger levels for OxSemi 950 devices
    
    [ Upstream commit d7aff291d069c4418285f3c8ee27b0ff67ce5998 ]
    
    Oxford Semiconductor 950 serial port devices have a 128-byte FIFO and in
    the enhanced (650) mode, which we select in `autoconfig_has_efr' with
    the ECB bit set in the EFR register, they support the receive interrupt
    trigger level selectable with FCR bits 7:6 from the set of 16, 32, 112,
    120.  This applies to the original OX16C950 discrete UART[1] as well as
    950 cores embedded into more complex devices.
    
    For these devices we set the default to 112, which sets an excessively
    high level of 112 or 7/8 of the FIFO capacity, unlike with other port
    types where we choose at most 1/2 of their respective FIFO capacities.
    Additionally we don't make the trigger level configurable.  Consequently
    frequent input overruns happen with high bit rates where hardware flow
    control cannot be used (e.g. terminal applications) even with otherwise
    highly-performant systems.
    
    Lower the default receive interrupt trigger level to 32 then, and make
    it configurable.  Document the trigger levels along with other port

    s390: make PCI mio support a machine flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 3322ba0d7bea1e24ae464418626f6a15b69533ab ]
    
    Kernel support for the newer PCI mio instructions can be toggled off
    with the pci=nomio command line option which needs to integrate with
    common code PCI option parsing. However this option then toggles static
    branches which can't be toggled yet in an early_param() call.
    
    Thus commit 9964f396f1d0 ("s390: fix setting of mio addressing control")
    moved toggling the static branches to the PCI init routine.
    
    With this setup however we can't check for mio support outside the PCI
    code during early boot, i.e. before switching the static branches, which
    we need to be able to export this as an ELF HWCAP.
    
    Improve on this by turning mio availability into a machine flag that
    gets initially set based on CONFIG_PCI and the facility bit and gets
    toggled off if pci=nomio is found during PCI option parsing allowing
    simple access to this machine flag after early init.

    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy().  So, the compiler legitimately complains about it. As these
    are just a couple of members, fix this by copying each one of them in
    separate calls to memcpy().
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
    and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE routines
    on memcpy().

    [ Upstream commit 6321c7acb82872ef6576c520b0e178eaad3a25c0 ]
    
    Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:
    
        In function 'ip_copy_addrs',
            inlined from '__ip_queue_xmit' at net/ipv4/ip_output.c:517:2:

    The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
    couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
    memcpy(). This causes a legitimate compiler warning because memcpy()
    overruns the length of &iph->saddr and &fl4->saddr. As these are just
    a couple of struct members, fix this by using direct assignments,
    instead of memcpy().
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds

    net: ipa: always validate filter and route tables

    All checks in ipa_table_validate_build() are computed at build time,
    so build that unconditionally.
    
    In ipa_table_valid() calls to ipa_table_valid_one() are missing the
    IPA pointer parameter is missing in (a bug that shows up only when
    IPA_VALIDATE is defined).  Don't bother checking whether hashed
    table memory regions are valid if hashed tables are not supported.
    
    With those things fixed, have these table validation functions built
    unconditionally (not dependent on IPA_VALIDATE).

    Stop supporting different sizes for hashed and non-hashed filter or
    route tables.  Add BUILD_BUG_ON() calls to verify the sizes of the
    fields in the filter/route table initialization immediate command
    are the same.
    
    Add a check to ipa_cmd_table_valid() to ensure the size of the
    memory region being checked fits within the immediate command field
    that must hold it.
    
    Remove two Boolean parameters used only for error reporting.  This
    actually fixes a bug that would only show up if IPA_VALIDATE were
    defined.  Define ipa_cmd_table_valid() unconditionally (no longer
    dependent on IPA_VALIDATE).

    [ Upstream commit 7ab1f6539762946de06ca14d7401ae123821bc40 ]
    
    Regulator node names don't reflect class of the device. Fix that by
    prefixing names with "regulator-".

    drm/bridge: nwl-dsi: Avoid potential multiplication overflow on 32-bit
    
    [ Upstream commit 47956bc86ee4e8530cac386a04f62a6095f7afbe ]
    
    As nwl_dsi.lanes is u32, and NSEC_PER_SEC is 1000000000L, the second
    multiplication in
    
        dsi->lanes * 8 * NSEC_PER_SEC
    
    will overflow on a 32-bit platform.  Fix this by making the constant
    unsigned long long, forcing 64-bit arithmetic.
    
    As iMX8 is arm64, this driver is currently used on 64-bit platforms
    only, where long is 64-bit, so this cannot happen.  But the issue will
    start to happen when the driver is reused for a 32-bit SoC (e.g.
    i.MX7ULP), or when code is copied for a new driver.

    bpf/tests: Do not PASS tests without actually testing the result
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b7e9f25e590726cca76700ebdb10e92a7a72ca1 ]
    
    Each test case can have a set of sub-tests, where each sub-test can
    run the cBPF/eBPF test snippet with its own data_size and expected
    result. Before, the end of the sub-test array was indicated by both
    data_size and result being zero. However, most or all of the internal
    eBPF tests has a data_size of zero already. When such a test also had
    an expected value of zero, the test was never run but reported as
    PASS anyway.
    
    Now the test runner always runs the first sub-test, regardless of the
    data_size and result values. The sub-test array zero-termination only
    applies for any additional sub-tests.
    
    There are other ways fix it of course, but this solution at least
    removes the surprise of eBPF tests with a zero result always succeeding.

    [ Upstream commit 3addbde269f21ffc735f6d3d0c2237664923824e ]
    
    [Why]
    During headless boot, DIG may be on which causes HW/SW discrepancies.
    To avoid this we power down hardware on boot if DIG is turned on. With
    introduction of multiple eDP, hardware power down is being bypassed
    under certain conditions.
    
    [How]
    Fixed hardware power down bypass, and ensured hardware will power down
    if DIG is on and seamless boot is not enabled.

    ethtool: improve compat ioctl handling
    
    [ Upstream commit dd98d2895de6485c884a9cb42de69fed02826fa4 ]
    
    The ethtool compat ioctl handling is hidden away in net/socket.c,
    which introduces a couple of minor oddities:
    
    - The implementation may end up diverging, as seen in the RXNFC
      extension in commit 84a1d9c48200 ("net: ethtool: extend RXNFC
      API to support RSS spreading of filter matches") that does not work
      in compat mode.
    
    - Most architectures do not need the compat handling at all
      because u64 and compat_u64 have the same alignment.
    
    - On x86, the conversion is done for both x32 and i386 user space,
      but it's actually wrong to do it for x32 and cannot work there.
    
    - On 32-bit Arm, it never worked for compat oabi user space, since
      that needs to do the same conversion but does not.
    
    - It would be nice to get rid of both compat_alloc_user_space()
      and copy_in_user() throughout the kernel.
    
    None of these actually seems to be a serious problem that real
    users are likely to encounter, but fixing all of them actually
    leads to code that is both shorter and more readable.

    [ Upstream commit 28b6a003bcdfa1fc4603b9185b247ecca7af9bef ]
    
    The virtual machine monitor (QEMU) exposes the pvpanic-pci
    device to the guest. On guest side the module exists but
    currently isn't loaded automatically. So the driver fails
    to be probed and does not its job of handling guest panic
    events.
    
    Instead of requiring manual modprobe, let's include a device
    database using the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro and let the
    module auto-load when the guest gets exposed with such a
    pvpanic-pci device.

    Some versions of the MC firmware wrongly report 0 for register base

    them unusable. This is particularly troublesome in ACPI boot scenarios
    where the legacy way of extracting this base address from the device

    usb: gadget: composite: Allow bMaxPower=0 if self-powered
    
    [ Upstream commit bcacbf06c891374e7fdd7b72d11cda03b0269b43 ]
    
    Currently the composite driver encodes the MaxPower field of
    the configuration descriptor by reading the c->MaxPower of the
    usb_configuration only if it is non-zero, otherwise it falls back
    to using the value hard-coded in CONFIG_USB_GADGET_VBUS_DRAW.
    However, there are cases when a configuration must explicitly set
    bMaxPower to 0, particularly if its bmAttributes also has the
    Self-Powered bit set, which is a valid combination.
    
    This is specifically called out in the USB PD specification section
    9.1, in which a PDUSB device "shall report zero in the bMaxPower
    field after negotiating a mutually agreeable Contract", and also
    verified by the USB Type-C Functional Test TD.4.10.2 Sink Power
    Precedence Test.
    
    The fix allows the c->MaxPower to be used for encoding the bMaxPower
    even if it is 0, if the self-powered bit is also set.  An example
    usage of this would be for a ConfigFS gadget to be dynamically
    updated by userspace when the Type-C connection is determined to be
    operating in Power Delivery mode.

    mv_ehci_enable() did not disable and unprepare clocks in case of

    usb: gadget: u_ether: fix a potential null pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ae01239609b29ec2eff55967c8e0fe3650cfa09 ]
    
    f_ncm tx timeout can call us with null skb to flush
    a pending frame.  In this case skb is NULL to begin
    with but ceases to be null after dev->wrap() completes.
    
    In such a case in->maxpacket will be read, even though
    we've failed to check that 'in' is not NULL.
    
    Though I've never observed this fail in practice,
    however the 'flush operation' simply does not make sense with
    a null usb IN endpoint - there's nowhere to flush to...
    (note that we're the gadget/device, and IN is from the point
     of view of the host, so here IN actually means outbound...)

    drm: protect drm_master pointers in drm_lease.c
    
    [ Upstream commit 56f0729a510f92151682ff6c89f69724d5595d6e ]
    
    drm_file->master pointers should be protected by
    drm_device.master_mutex or drm_file.master_lookup_lock when being
    dereferenced.
    
    However, in drm_lease.c, there are multiple instances where
    drm_file->master is accessed and dereferenced while neither lock is
    held. This makes drm_lease.c vulnerable to use-after-free bugs.
    
    We address this issue in 2 ways:
    
    1. Add a new drm_file_get_master() function that calls drm_master_get
    on drm_file->master while holding on to
    drm_file.master_lookup_lock. Since drm_master_get increments the
    reference count of master, this prevents master from being freed until
    we unreference it with drm_master_put.
    
    2. In each case where drm_file->master is directly accessed and
    eventually dereferenced in drm_lease.c, we wrap the access in a call
    to the new drm_file_get_master function, then unreference the master
    pointer once we are done using it.

    drm: serialize drm_file.master with a new spinlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b0860a3cf5eccf183760b1177a1dcdb821b0b66 ]
    
    Currently, drm_file.master pointers should be protected by
    drm_device.master_mutex when being dereferenced. This is because
    drm_file.master is not invariant for the lifetime of drm_file. If
    drm_file is not the creator of master, then drm_file.is_master is
    false, and a call to drm_setmaster_ioctl will invoke
    drm_new_set_master, which then allocates a new master for drm_file and
    puts the old master.
    
    Thus, without holding drm_device.master_mutex, the old value of
    drm_file.master could be freed while it is being used by another
    concurrent process.
    
    However, it is not always possible to lock drm_device.master_mutex to
    dereference drm_file.master. Through the fbdev emulation code, this
    might occur in a deep nest of other locks. But drm_device.master_mutex
    is also the outermost lock in the nesting hierarchy, so this leads to
    potential deadlocks.
    
    To address this, we introduce a new spin lock at the bottom of the
    lock hierarchy that only serializes drm_file.master. With this change,
    the value of drm_file.master changes only when both
    drm_device.master_mutex and drm_file.master_lookup_lock are
    held. Hence, any process holding either of those locks can ensure that
    the value of drm_file.master will not change concurrently.
    
    Since no lock depends on the new drm_file.master_lookup_lock, when
    drm_file.master is dereferenced, but drm_device.master_mutex cannot be
    held, we can safely protect the master pointer with
    drm_file.master_lookup_lock.

    drm: avoid blocking in drm_clients_info's rcu section
    
    [ Upstream commit 5eff9585de220cdd131237f5665db5e6c6bdf590 ]
    
    Inside drm_clients_info, the rcu_read_lock is held to lock
    pid_task()->comm. However, within this protected section, a call to
    drm_is_current_master is made, which involves a mutex lock in a future
    patch. However, this is illegal because the mutex lock might block
    while in the RCU read-side critical section.
    
    Since drm_is_current_master isn't protected by rcu_read_lock, we avoid
    this by moving it out of the RCU critical section.
    
    The following report came from intel-gfx ci's

    net: ipa: fix IPA v4.11 interconnect data
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ac26271344478ff718329fa9d4ef81d4bcbc43b ]
    
    Currently three interconnects are defined for the Qualcomm SC7280
    SoC, but this was based on a misunderstanding.  There should only be
    two interconnects defined:  one between the IPA and system memory;
    and another between the AP and IPA config space.  The bandwidths
    defined for the memory and config interconnects do not match what I
    understand to be proper values, so update these.

    arm64: dts: qcom: Fix usb entries for SA8155p adp board
    
    [ Upstream commit 12dd4ebda47abd5e3907da386b6fe1d8181ad179 ]
    
    SA8155p adp board has two USB A-type receptacles called
    USB-portB and USB-portC respectively.
    
    While USB-portB is a USB High-Speed connector/interface, the
    USB-portC one is a USB 3.1 Super-Speed connector/interface.
    
    Also the USB-portB is used as the USB emergency
    download port (for image download purposes).
    
    Enable both the ports on the board in USB Host mode (since all
    the USB interfaces are brought out to USB Type A
    connectors).

    drm/ast: Disable fast reset after DRAM initial
    
    [ Upstream commit f34bf652d680cf65783e7c57d61c94ee87f092bd ]
    
    [Bug][AST2500]
    
    V1:
    When AST2500 acts as stand-alone VGA so that DRAM and DVO initialization
    have to be achieved by VGA driver with P2A (PCI to AHB) enabling.
    However, HW suggests disable Fast reset mode after DRAM initializaton,
    because fast reset mode is mainly designed for ARM ICE debugger.
    Once Fast reset is checked as enabling, WDT (Watch Dog Timer) should be
    first enabled to avoid system deadlock before disable fast reset mode.
    
    V2:
    Use to_pci_dev() to get revision of PCI configuration.
    
    V3:
    If SCU00 is not unlocked, just enter its password again.
    It is unnecessary to clear AHB lock condition and restore WDT default
    setting again, before Fast-reset clearing.
    
    V4:
    repatch after "error : could not build fake ancestor" resolved.
    
    V5:
    Since CVE_2019_6260 item3, Most of AST2500 have disabled P2A(PCIe to AMBA).
    However, for backward compatibility, some patches about P2A, such as items
    of v5.2 and v5.3, are considered to be upstreamed with comments.
    1. Add define macro to improve source readability.
    ast_drv.h, ast_main.c, ast_post.c
    2. Add comment about "Fast restet" is enabled for ARM-ICE debugger
    ast_post.c
    3. Add comment about Reset USB port to patch USB unknown device issue

    iavf: fix locking of critical sections
    
    [ Upstream commit 226d528512cfac890a1619aea4301f3dd314fe60 ]
    
    To avoid races between iavf_init_task(), iavf_reset_task(),
    iavf_watchdog_task(), iavf_adminq_task() as well as the shutdown and
    remove functions more locking is required.
    The current protection by __IAVF_IN_CRITICAL_TASK is needed in
    additional places.
    
    - The reset task performs state transitions, therefore needs locking.
    - The adminq task acts on replies from the PF in
      iavf_virtchnl_completion() which may alter the states.
    - The init task is not only run during probe but also if a VF gets stuck
      to reinitialize it.
    - The shutdown function performs a state transition.
    - The remove function performs a state transition and also free's
      resources.
    
    iavf_lock_timeout() is introduced to avoid waiting infinitely
    and cause a deadlock. Rather unlock and print a warning.

    iavf: do not override the adapter state in the watchdog task
    
    [ Upstream commit 22c8fd71d3a5e6fe584ccc2c1e8760e5baefd5aa ]
    
    The iavf watchdog task overrides adapter->state to __IAVF_RESETTING
    when it detects a pending reset. Then schedules iavf_reset_task() which
    takes care of the reset.
    
    The reset task is capable of handling the reset without changing
    adapter->state. In fact we lose the state information when the watchdog
    task prematurely changes the adapter state. This may lead to a crash if
    instead of the reset task the iavf_remove() function gets called before
    the reset task.
    In that case (if we were in state __IAVF_RUNNING previously) the
    iavf_remove() function triggers iavf_close() which fails to close the
    device because of the incorrect state information.
    
    This may result in a crash due to pending interrupts.

    iio: dac: ad5624r: Fix incorrect handling of an optional regulator.
    
    [ Upstream commit 97683c851f9cdbd3ea55697cbe2dcb6af4287bbd ]
    
    The naming of the regulator is problematic.  VCC is usually a supply
    voltage whereas these devices have a separate VREF pin.
    
    Secondly, the regulator core might have provided a stub regulator if
    a real regulator wasn't provided. That would in turn have failed to
    provide a voltage when queried. So reality was that there was no way
    to use the internal reference.
    
    In order to avoid breaking any dts out in the wild, make sure to fallback
    to the original vcc naming if vref is not available.

    tipc: keep the skb in rcv queue until the whole data is read
    
    [ Upstream commit f4919ff59c2828064b4156e3c3600a169909bcf4 ]
    
    Currently, when userspace reads a datagram with a buffer that is
    smaller than this datagram, the data will be truncated and only
    part of it can be received by users. It doesn't seem right that
    users don't know the datagram size and have to use a huge buffer
    to read it to avoid the truncation.
    
    This patch to fix it by keeping the skb in rcv queue until the
    whole data is read by users. Only the last msg of the datagram
    will be marked with MSG_EOR, just as TCP/SCTP does.
    
    Note that this will work as above only when MSG_EOR is set in the
    flags parameter of recvmsg(), so that it won't break any old user
    applications.

    PCI: Use pci_update_current_state() in pci_enable_device_flags()
    
    [ Upstream commit 14858dcc3b3587f4bb5c48e130ee7d68fc2b0a29 ]
    
    Updating the current_state field of struct pci_dev the way it is done
    in pci_enable_device_flags() before calling do_pci_enable_device() may
    not work.  For example, if the given PCI device depends on an ACPI
    power resource whose _STA method initially returns 0 ("off"), but the
    config space of the PCI device is accessible and the power state
    retrieved from the PCI_PM_CTRL register is D0, the current_state
    field in the struct pci_dev representing that device will get out of
    sync with the power.state of its ACPI companion object and that will
    lead to power management issues going forward.
    
    To avoid such issues, make pci_enable_device_flags() call
    pci_update_current_state() which takes ACPI device power management
    into account, if present, to retrieve the current power state of the
    device.

    x86/hyperv: fix for unwanted manipulation of sched_clock when TSC marked unstable
    
    [ Upstream commit c445535c3efbfb8cb42d098e624d46ab149664b7 ]
    
    Marking TSC as unstable has a side effect of marking sched_clock as
    unstable when TSC is still being used as the sched_clock. This is not
    desirable. Hyper-V ultimately uses a paravirtualized clock source that
    provides a stable scheduler clock even on systems without TscInvariant
    CPU capability. Hence, mark_tsc_unstable() call should be called _after_
    scheduler clock has been changed to the paravirtualized clocksource. This
    will prevent any unwanted manipulation of the sched_clock. Only TSC will
    be correctly marked as unstable.

    drm/vkms: Let shadow-plane helpers prepare the plane's FB
    
    [ Upstream commit b43e2ec03b0de040d536591713ea9c875ff34ba9 ]
    
    Replace vkms' prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions with the generic
    code for shadow-buffered planes. No functional changes.
    
    This change also fixes a problem where IGT kms_flip tests would
    create a segmentation fault within vkms. The driver's prepare_fb
    function did not report an error if a BO's vmap operation failed.
    The kernel later tried to operate on the non-mapped memory areas.
    The shared shadow-plane helpers handle errors correctly, so that
    the driver now avoids the segmantation fault.

    libbpf: Fix reuse of pinned map on older kernel
    
    [ Upstream commit 97eb31384af943d6b97eb5947262cee4ef25cb87 ]
    
    When loading a BPF program with a pinned map, the loader checks whether
    the pinned map can be reused, i.e. their properties match. To derive
    such of the pinned map, the loader invokes BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD and
    then does the comparison.
    
    Unfortunately, on < 4.12 kernels the BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD is not
    available, so loading the program fails with the following error:
    
            libbpf: failed to get map info for map FD 5: Invalid argument
            libbpf: couldn't reuse pinned map at
                    '/sys/fs/bpf/tc/globals/cilium_call_policy': parameter
                    mismatch"
            libbpf: map 'cilium_call_policy': error reusing pinned map
            libbpf: map 'cilium_call_policy': failed to create:
                    Invalid argument(-22)
            libbpf: failed to load object 'bpf_overlay.o'
    
    To fix this, fallback to derivation of the map properties via
    /proc/$PID/fdinfo/$MAP_FD if BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD fails with EINVAL,
    which can be used as an indicator that the kernel doesn't support
    the latter.

    [ Upstream commit 892c37f8a3d673b945e951a8754695c119a2b1b0 ]
    
    When starting streaming the driver currently programs the buffer
    address to the CAL base-address register and assigns the buffer pointer
    to ctx->dma.pending. This is not correct, as the buffer is not
    "pending", but active, and causes the first buffer to be needlessly
    written twice.
    
    Fix this by assigning the buffer pointer to ctx->dma.active.

    On a config (such as arch/sh/) which does not set HAS_DMA when MMU
    is not set, several ATMEL ASoC drivers select symbols that cause
    kconfig warnings. There is one "depends on HAS_DMA" which is no longer
    needed. Dropping it eliminates the kconfig warnings and still builds
    with no problems reported.
    
    Fix the following kconfig warnings:

    [ Upstream commit bbdd3f4dbe81e19b9123bc54e23ed54517615524 ]
    
    The DIT mode support has not been tested due to lack of platform where it
    can be tested.
    To be able to use the McASP on OMAP4/5 (only supporting DIT mode) we need
    to have DIT mode working in the McASP driver on a know platform.
    After hacking around (on BBW, mcasp1.axr1 can be routed out for this) it
    appeared that DIT mode is broken.
    
    This patch fixes it up and 16/24 bit audio works along with passthrough,
    but I have only tested with DTS example and test files.

    - Pick in spi-cpha and spi-cpol from the SPI node parent,
      this will specify that we are "type 3" in the device tree
      rather than hardcoding it in the operating system.
    - Drop the u32 ref from the SPI frequency: comes in from
      the SPI host bindings.
    - Make spi-cpha, spi-cpol and port compulsory.
    - Update the example with a real-world SPI controller,
      spi-gpio.

    [ Upstream commit 1d9d2ca85b32605ac9c74c8fa42d0c1cfbe019d4 ]
    
    Debugfs RAS EEPROM files are available when
    the ASIC supports RAS, and when the debugfs is
    enabled, an also when "ras_enable" module
    parameter is set to 0. However in this case,
    we get a kernel oops when accessing some of
    the "ras_..." controls in debugfs. The reason
    for this is that struct amdgpu_ras::adev is
    unset. This commit sets it, thus enabling access
    to those facilities. Note that this facilitates
    EEPROM access and not necessarily RAS features or
    functionality.

    drm/vc4: hdmi: Set HD_CTL_WHOLSMP and HD_CTL_CHALIGN_SET
    
    [ Upstream commit 1698ecb218eb82587dbfc71a2e26ded66e5ecf59 ]
    
    Symptom is random switching of speakers when using multichannel.
    
    Repeatedly running speakertest -c8 occasionally starts with
    channels jumbled. This is fixed with HD_CTL_WHOLSMP.
    
    The other bit looks beneficial and apears harmless in testing so
    I'd suggest adding it too.
    
    Documentation says: HD_CTL_WHILSMP_SET
    Wait for whole sample. When this bit is set MAI transmit will start
    only when there is at least one whole sample available in the fifo.
    
    Documentation says: HD_CTL_CHALIGN_SET
    Channel Align When Overflow. This bit is used to realign the audio
    channels in case of an overflow.
    If this bit is set, after the detection of an overflow, equal
    amount of dummy words to the missing words will be written to fifo,
    filling up the broken sample and maintaining alignment.

    userfaultfd: prevent concurrent API initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit 22e5fe2a2a279d9a6fcbdfb4dffe73821bef1c90 ]
    
    userfaultfd assumes that the enabled features are set once and never
    changed after UFFDIO_API ioctl succeeded.
    
    However, currently, UFFDIO_API can be called concurrently from two
    different threads, succeed on both threads and leave userfaultfd's
    features in non-deterministic state.  Theoretically, other uffd operations
    (ioctl's and page-faults) can be dispatched while adversely affected by
    such changes of features.
    
    Moreover, the writes to ctx->state and ctx->features are not ordered,
    which can - theoretically, again - let userfaultfd_ioctl() think that
    userfaultfd API completed, while the features are still not initialized.
    
    To avoid races, it is arguably best to get rid of ctx->state.  Since there
    are only 2 states, record the API initialization in ctx->features as the
    uppermost bit and remove ctx->state.

    f2fs_read_multi_pages() which checks EOF first. If there's any page beyond EOF,
    we unlock the page and set cc->rpages[i] = NULL, which we can't put the page
    anymore. This makes page leak, so let's fix by putting that page.

           return -ENOENT
     - force return value from ENOENT to 0
    
    It should be fine for read case, since it indicates a hole condition,
    and caller could use .m_next_pgofs to skip the hole and continue the
    lookup.
    
    However it may cause confusing for write case, since leaving a hole
    there, and said nothing was wrong doesn't help.
    
    There is at least one case from dax_iomap_actor() will complain that,
    so fix this in prior to supporting dax in f2fs.

    KVM: PPC: Fix clearing never mapped TCEs in realmode
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d78dfde33a02da1d816279c2e3452978b7abd39 ]
    
    Since commit e1a1ef84cd07 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S: Allocate guest TCEs on
    demand too"), pages for TCE tables for KVM guests are allocated only
    when needed. This allows skipping any update when clearing TCEs. This
    works mostly fine as TCE updates are handled when the MMU is enabled.
    The realmode handlers fail with H_TOO_HARD when pages are not yet
    allocated, except when clearing a TCE in which case KVM prints a warning
    and proceeds to dereference a NULL pointer, which crashes the host OS.
    
    This has not been caught so far as the change in commit e1a1ef84cd07 is
    reasonably new, and POWER9 runs mostly radix which does not use realmode
    handlers. With hash, the default TCE table is memset() by QEMU when the
    machine is reset which triggers page faults and the KVM TCE device's
    kvm_spapr_tce_fault() handles those with MMU on. And the huge DMA
    windows are not cleared by VMs which instead successfully create a DMA
    window big enough to map the VM memory 1:1 and then VMs just map
    everything without clearing.
    
    This started crashing now as commit 381ceda88c4c ("powerpc/pseries/iommu:
    Make use of DDW for indirect mapping") added a mode when a dymanic DMA
    window not big enough to map the VM memory 1:1 but it is used anyway,
    and the VM now is the first (i.e. not QEMU) to clear a just created
    table. Note that upstream QEMU needs to be modified to trigger the VM to
    trigger the host OS crash.
    
    This replaces WARN_ON_ONCE_RM() with a check and return, and adds
    another warning if TCE is not being cleared.

    clk: ralink: avoid to set 'CLK_IS_CRITICAL' flag for gates
    
    [ Upstream commit c16edf5ff8ece9c4135175da4103cee1bec360be ]
    
    'clk_init_data' for gates is setting up 'CLK_IS_CRITICAL'
    flag for all of them. This was being doing because some
    drivers of this SoC might not be ready to use the clock
    and we don't wanted the kernel to disable them since default
    behaviour without clock driver was to set all gate bits to
    enabled state. After a bit more testing and checking driver
    code it is safe to remove this flag and just let the kernel
    to disable those gates that are not in use. No regressions
    seems to appear.

    fscache: Fix cookie key hashing
    
    [ Upstream commit 35b72573e977ed6b18b094136a4fa3e0ffb13603 ]
    
    The current hash algorithm used for hashing cookie keys is really bad,
    producing almost no dispersion (after a test kernel build, ~30000 files
    were split over just 18 out of the 32768 hash buckets).
    
    Borrow the full_name_hash() hash function into fscache to do the hashing
    for cookie keys and, in the future, volume keys.
    
    I don't want to use full_name_hash() as-is because I want the hash value to
    be consistent across arches and over time as the hash value produced may
    get used on disk.
    
    I can also optimise parts of it away as the key will always be a padded
    array of aligned 32-bit words.

    powerpc/smp: Update cpu_core_map on all PowerPc systems
    
    [ Upstream commit b8b928030332a0ca16d42433eb2c3085600d8704 ]
    
    lscpu() uses core_siblings to list the number of sockets in the
    system. core_siblings is set using topology_core_cpumask.
    
    While optimizing the powerpc bootup path, Commit 4ca234a9cbd7
    ("powerpc/smp: Stop updating cpu_core_mask").  it was found that
    updating cpu_core_mask() ended up taking a lot of time. It was thought
    that on Powerpc, cpu_core_mask() would always be same as
    cpu_cpu_mask() i.e number of sockets will always be equal to number of
    nodes. As an optimization, cpu_core_mask() was made a snapshot of
    cpu_cpu_mask().
    
    However that was found to be false with PowerPc KVM guests, where each
    node could have more than one socket. So with Commit c47f892d7aa6
    ("powerpc/smp: Reintroduce cpu_core_mask"), cpu_core_mask was updated
    based on chip_id but in an optimized way using some mask manipulations
    and chip_id caching.
    
    However on non-PowerNV and non-pseries KVM guests (i.e not
    implementing cpu_to_chip_id(), continued to use a copy of
    cpu_cpu_mask().
    
    There are two issues that were noticed on such systems
    1. lscpu would report one extra socket.
    On a IBM,9009-42A (aka zz system) which has only 2 chips/ sockets/
    nodes, lscpu would report
    Architecture:        ppc64le
    Byte Order:          Little Endian
    CPU(s):              160
    On-line CPU(s) list: 0-159
    Thread(s) per core:  8
    Core(s) per socket:  6
    Socket(s):           3                <--------------
    NUMA node(s):        2
    Model:               2.2 (pvr 004e 0202)
    Model name:          POWER9 (architected), altivec supported
    Hypervisor vendor:   pHyp
    Virtualization type: para
    L1d cache:           32K
    L1i cache:           32K
    L2 cache:            512K
    L3 cache:            10240K
    NUMA node0 CPU(s):   0-79
    NUMA node1 CPU(s):   80-159
    
    2. Currently cpu_cpu_mask is updated when a core is
    added/removed. However its not updated when smt mode switching or on
    CPUs are explicitly offlined. However all other percpu masks are
    updated to ensure only active/online CPUs are in the masks.
    This results in build_sched_domain traces since there will be CPUs in
    cpu_cpu_mask() but those CPUs are not present in SMT / CACHE / MC /
    NUMA domains. A loop of threads running smt mode switching and core
    add/remove will soon show this trace.
    Hence cpu_cpu_mask has to be update at smt mode switch.
    
    This will have impact on cpu_core_mask(). cpu_core_mask() is a
    snapshot of cpu_cpu_mask. Different CPUs within the same socket will
    end up having different cpu_core_masks since they are snapshots at
    different points of time. This means when lscpu will start reporting
    many more sockets than the actual number of sockets/ nodes / chips.
    
    Different ways to handle this problem:
    A. Update the snapshot aka cpu_core_mask for all CPUs whenever
       cpu_cpu_mask is updated. This would a non-optimal solution.
    B. Instead of a cpumask_var_t, make cpu_core_map a cpumask pointer
       pointing to cpu_cpu_mask. However percpu cpumask pointer is frowned
       upon and we need a clean way to handle PowerPc KVM guest which is
       not a snapshot.
    C. Update cpu_core_masks all PowerPc systems like in PowerPc KVM
    guests using mask manipulations. This approach is relatively simple
    and unifies with the existing code.
    D. On top of 3, we could also resurrect get_physical_package_id which
       could return a nid for the said CPU. However this is not needed at this
       time.
    
    Option C is the preferred approach for now.
    
    While this is somewhat a revert of Commit 4ca234a9cbd7 ("powerpc/smp:
    Stop updating cpu_core_mask").
    
    1. Plain revert has some conflicts
    2. For chip_id == -1, the cpu_core_mask is made identical to
    cpu_cpu_mask, unlike previously where cpu_core_mask was set to a core
    if chip_id doesn't exist.
    
    This goes by the principle that if chip_id is not exposed, then
    sockets / chip / node share the same set of CPUs.
    
    With the fix, lscpu o/p would be
    Architecture:        ppc64le
    Byte Order:          Little Endian

    dip_idx and dgid should be a one-to-one mapping relationship, but when
    qp_num loops back to the start number, it may happen that two different
    dgid are assiociated to the same dip_idx incorrectly.
    
    One solution is to store the qp_num that is not assigned to dip_idx in an
    array. When a dip_idx needs to be allocated to a new dgid, an spare qp_num
    is extracted and assigned to dip_idx.

    [ Upstream commit 3c69a5f22223fa3e312689ec218b5059784d49d7 ]
    
    Incase of random sampling, there can be scenarios where
    Sample Instruction Address Register(SIAR) may not latch
    to the sampled instruction and could result in
    the value of 0. In these scenarios it is preferred to
    return regs->nip. These corner cases are seen in the
    previous generation (p9) also.
    
    Patch adds the check for SIAR value along with regs_use_siar
    and siar_valid checks so that the function will return
    regs->nip incase SIAR is zero.
    
    Patch drops the code under PPMU_P10_DD1 flag check
    which handles SIAR 0 case only for Power10 DD1.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Reflect guest PMU in-use to L0 when guest SPRs are live
    
    [ Upstream commit 1782663897945a5cf28e564ba5eed730098e9aa4 ]
    
    After the L1 saves its PMU SPRs but before loading the L2's PMU SPRs,
    switch the pmcregs_in_use field in the L1 lppaca to the value advertised
    by the L2 in its VPA. On the way out of the L2, set it back after saving
    the L2 PMU registers (if they were in-use).
    
    This transfers the PMU liveness indication between the L1 and L2 at the
    points where the registers are not live.
    
    This fixes the nested HV bug for which a workaround was added to the L0
    HV by commit 63279eeb7f93a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Always save guest pmu
    for guest capable of nesting"), which explains the problem in detail.
    That workaround is no longer required for guests that include this bug
    fix.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix copy_tofrom_guest routines
    
    [ Upstream commit 5d7d6dac8fe99ed59eee2300e4a03370f94d5222 ]
    
    The __kvmhv_copy_tofrom_guest_radix function was introduced along with
    nested HV guest support. It uses the platform's Radix MMU quadrants to
    provide a nested hypervisor with fast access to its nested guests
    memory (H_COPY_TOFROM_GUEST hypercall). It has also since been added
    as a fast path for the kvmppc_ld/st routines which are used during
    instruction emulation.
    
    The commit def0bfdbd603 ("powerpc: use probe_user_read() and
    probe_user_write()") changed the low level copy function from
    raw_copy_from_user to probe_user_read, which adds a check to
    access_ok. In powerpc that is:
    
     static inline bool __access_ok(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size)
     {
             return addr < TASK_SIZE_MAX && size <= TASK_SIZE_MAX - addr;
     }
    
    and TASK_SIZE_MAX is 0x0010000000000000UL for 64-bit, which means that
    setting the two MSBs of the effective address (which correspond to the
    quadrant) now cause access_ok to reject the access.
    
    This was not caught earlier because the most common code path via
    kvmppc_ld/st contains a fallback (kvm_read_guest) that is likely to
    succeed for L1 guests. For nested guests there is no fallback.
    
    Another issue is that probe_user_read (now __copy_from_user_nofault)
    does not return the number of bytes not copied in case of failure, so
    the destination memory is not being cleared anymore in
    kvmhv_copy_from_guest_radix:
    
     ret = kvmhv_copy_tofrom_guest_radix(vcpu, eaddr, to, NULL, n);
     if (ret > 0)                            <-- always false!
             memset(to + (n - ret), 0, ret);
    
    This patch fixes both issues by skipping access_ok and open-coding the
    low level __copy_to/from_user_inatomic.

    clk: imx8m: fix clock tree update of TF-A managed clocks
    
    [ Upstream commit d36207b848a6490e14664e2197a1c8ab51d8148e ]
    
    On the i.MX8M*, the TF-A exposes a SiP (Silicon Provider) service
    for DDR frequency scaling. The imx8m-ddrc-devfreq driver calls the
    SiP and then does clk_set_parent on the DDR muxes to synchronize
    the clock tree.
    
    Since 936c383673b9 ("clk: imx: fix composite peripheral flags"),
    these TF-A managed muxes have SET_PARENT_GATE set, which results
    in imx8m-ddrc-devfreq's clk_set_parent after SiP failing with -EBUSY:
    
            echo 25000000 > userspace/set_freq
            imx8m-ddrc-devfreq 3d400000.memory-controller: failed to set
                    dram_apb parent: -16
    
    Fix this by adding a new i.MX composite flag for firmware managed
    clocks, which clears SET_PARENT_GATE.
    
    This is safe to do, because updating the Linux clock tree to reflect
    reality will always be glitch-free.

    Referencing files: drivers/hid/Makefile, drivers/hid/hid-quirks.c
    
    Following the discussion (see Link), CONFIG_HID_THRUSTMASTER is the

    [ Upstream commit ccc89737aa6b9f248cf1623014038beb6c2b7f56 ]
    
    This driver has some left over "return 1" on failure style code mixed with
    "return negative error codes" style code.  The caller doesn't care so we
    should just convert everything to return negative error codes.
    
    Then there was a problem that there were two variables used to store error
    codes which just resulted in confusion.  If qedf_alloc_bdq() returned a
    negative error code, we accidentally returned success instead of
    propagating the error code.  So get rid of the "rc" variable and use
    "status" every where.
    
    Also remove the "status = 0" initialization so that these sorts of bugs
    will be detected by the compiler in the future.

    scsi: qedi: Fix error codes in qedi_alloc_global_queues()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4dbe57d46d54a847875fa33e7d05877bb341585e ]
    
    This function had some left over code that returned 1 on error instead
    negative error codes.  Convert everything to use negative error codes.  The
    caller treats all non-zero returns the same so this does not affect run
    time.
    
    A couple places set "rc" instead of "status" so those error paths ended up
    returning success by mistake.  Get rid of the "rc" variable and use
    "status" everywhere.
    
    Remove the bogus "status = 0" initialization, as a future proofing measure
    so the compiler will warn about uninitialized error codes.

    platform/x86: ISST: Fix optimization with use of numa
    
    [ Upstream commit d36d4a1d75d2a8bd14ec00d5cb0ce166f6886146 ]
    
    When numa is used to map CPU to PCI device, the optimized path to read
    from cached data is not working and still calls _isst_if_get_pci_dev().
    
    The reason is that when caching the mapping, numa information is not
    available as it is read later. So move the assignment of
    isst_cpu_info[cpu].numa_node before calling _isst_if_get_pci_dev().

    powerpc/numa: Consider the max NUMA node for migratable LPAR
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c7248bb8de31f51c693bfa6a6ea53b1c07e0fa8 ]
    
    When a LPAR is migratable, we should consider the maximum possible NUMA
    node instead of the number of NUMA nodes from the actual system.
    
    The DT property 'ibm,current-associativity-domains' defines the maximum
    number of nodes the LPAR can see when running on that box. But if the
    LPAR is being migrated on another box, it may see up to the nodes
    defined by 'ibm,max-associativity-domains'. So if a LPAR is migratable,
    that value should be used.
    
    Unfortunately, there is no easy way to know if an LPAR is migratable or
    not. The hypervisor exports the property 'ibm,migratable-partition' in
    the case it set to migrate partition, but that would not mean that the
    current partition is migratable.
    
    Without this patch, when a LPAR is started on a 2 node box and then
    migrated to a 3 node box, the hypervisor may spread the LPAR's CPUs on
    the 3rd node. In that case if a CPU from that 3rd node is added to the
    LPAR, it will be wrongly assigned to the node because the kernel has
    been set to use up to 2 nodes (the configuration of the departure node).
    With this patch applies, the CPU is correctly added to the 3rd node.

    scsi: ufshcd: Fix device links when BOOT WLUN fails to probe
    
    [ Upstream commit bf25967ac54129ffb676ee0dbe3b8b34af6c6232 ]
    
    Managed device links are deleted by device_del(). However it is possible to
    add a device link to a consumer before device_add(), and then discovering
    an error prevents the device from being used. In that case normally
    references to the device would be dropped and the device would be deleted.
    However the device link holds a reference to the device, so the device link
    and device remain indefinitely (unless the supplier is deleted).
    
    For UFSHCD, if a LUN fails to probe (e.g. absent BOOT WLUN), the device
    will not have been registered but can still have a device link holding a
    reference to the device. The unwanted device link will prevent runtime
    suspend indefinitely.
    
    Amend device link removal to accept removal of a link with an unregistered
    consumer device (suggested by Rafael), and fix UFSHCD by explicitly
    deleting the device link when SCSI destroys the SCSI device.

    [ Upstream commit f99fa50880f5300fbbb3c0754ddc7f8738d24fe7 ]
    
    The xprtrdma client code currently relies on the task that initiated the
    connect to hold the XPRT_LOCK for the duration of the connection
    attempt. If the task is woken early, due to some other event, then that
    lock could get released early.
    Avoid races by using the same mechanism that the socket code uses of
    transferring lock ownership to the RDMA connect worker itself. That
    frees us to call rpcrdma_xprt_disconnect() directly since we're now
    guaranteed exclusion w.r.t. other callers.

    Process A opens the folder, and has been reading without closing it.
    During this period, Process B created a file under the folder (occupying
    multiple f2fs_dir_entry, exceeding the d.max of the inline dir). After
    creation, process A uses the d.max of inline dir to read it again, and
    it will read that de->name_len is 0.
    
    And Chao pointed out that w/o inline conversion, the race condition still
    can happen as below:
    
    dir_entry1: A
    dir_entry2: B
    dir_entry3: C
    free slot: _
    ctx->pos: ^
    
    Thread A is traversing directory,
    ctx-pos moves to below position after readdir() by thread A:
    AAAABBBB___
            ^
    
    Then thread B delete dir_entry2, and create dir_entry3.
    
    Thread A calls readdir() to lookup dirents starting from middle
    of new dirent slots as below:
    AAAACCCCCC_
            ^
    In these scenarios, the file system is not damaged, and it's hard to
    avoid it. But we can bypass tagging FSCK flag if:
    a) bit_pos (:= ctx->pos % d->max) is non-zero and
    b) before bit_pos moves to first valid dir_entry.

    cpuidle: pseries: Mark pseries_idle_proble() as __init
    
    [ Upstream commit d04691d373e75c83424b85c0e68e4a3f9370c10d ]
    
    After commit 7cbd631d4dec ("cpuidle: pseries: Fixup CEDE0 latency only
    for POWER10 onwards"), pseries_idle_probe() is no longer inlined when
    compiling with clang, which causes a modpost warning:
    
    WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0xc86a54): Section mismatch in
    reference from the function pseries_idle_probe() to the function
    .init.text:fixup_cede0_latency()
    The function pseries_idle_probe() references
    the function __init fixup_cede0_latency().
    This is often because pseries_idle_probe lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of fixup_cede0_latency is wrong.
    
    pseries_idle_probe() is a non-init function, which calls
    fixup_cede0_latency(), which is an init function, explaining the
    mismatch. pseries_idle_probe() is only called from
    pseries_processor_idle_init(), which is an init function, so mark
    pseries_idle_probe() as __init so there is no more warning.

    cpuidle: pseries: Fixup CEDE0 latency only for POWER10 onwards
    
    [ Upstream commit 50741b70b0cbbafbd9199f5180e66c0c53783a4a ]
    
    Commit d947fb4c965c ("cpuidle: pseries: Fixup exit latency for
    CEDE(0)") sets the exit latency of CEDE(0) based on the latency values
    of the Extended CEDE states advertised by the platform
    
    On POWER9 LPARs, the firmwares advertise a very low value of 2us for
    CEDE1 exit latency on a Dedicated LPAR. The latency advertized by the
    PHYP hypervisor corresponds to the latency required to wakeup from the
    underlying hardware idle state. However the wakeup latency from the
    LPAR perspective should include
    
    1. The time taken to transition the CPU from the Hypervisor into the
       LPAR post wakeup from platform idle state
    
    2. Time taken to send the IPI from the source CPU (waker) to the idle
       target CPU (wakee).
    
    1. can be measured via timer idle test, where we queue a timer, say
    for 1ms, and enter the CEDE state. When the timer fires, in the timer
    handler we compute how much extra timer over the expected 1ms have we
    consumed. On a a POWER9 LPAR the numbers are
    
    CEDE latency measured using a timer (numbers in ns)
    N       Min      Median   Avg       90%ile  99%ile    Max    Stddev
    400     2601     5677     5668.74    5917    6413     9299   455.01
    
    1. and 2. combined can be determined by an IPI latency test where we
    send an IPI to an idle CPU and in the handler compute the time
    difference between when the IPI was sent and when the handler ran. We
    see the following numbers on POWER9 LPAR.
    
    CEDE latency measured using an IPI (numbers in ns)
    N       Min      Median   Avg       90%ile  99%ile    Max    Stddev
    400     711      7564     7369.43   8559    9514      9698   1200.01
    
    Suppose, we consider the 99th percentile latency value measured using
    the IPI to be the wakeup latency, the value would be 9.5us This is in
    the ballpark of the default value of 10us.
    
    Hence, use the exit latency of CEDE(0) based on the latency values
    advertized by platform only from POWER10 onwards. The values
    advertized on POWER10 platforms is more realistic and informed by the
    latency measurements. For earlier platforms stick to the default value
    of 10us. The fix was suggested by Michael Ellerman.

    scsi: ufs: Fix the SCSI abort handler
    
    [ Upstream commit 64180742605f772d511903c9e50262afb13726c6 ]
    
    Make the following changes in ufshcd_abort():
    
     - Return FAILED instead of SUCCESS if the abort handler notices that a
       SCSI command has already been completed. Returning SUCCESS in this case
       triggers a use-after-free and may trigger a kernel crash.
    
     - Fix the code for aborting SCSI commands submitted to a WLUN.
    
    The current approach for aborting SCSI commands that have been submitted to
    a WLUN and that timed out is as follows:
    
     - Report to the SCSI core that the command has completed successfully.
       Let the block layer free any data buffers associated with the command.
    
     - Mark the command as outstanding in 'outstanding_reqs'.
    
     - If the block layer tries to reuse the tag associated with the aborted
       command, busy-wait until the tag is freed.
    
    This approach can result in:
    
     - Memory corruption if the controller accesses the data buffer after the
       block layer has freed the associated data buffers.
    
     - A race condition if ufshcd_queuecommand() or ufshcd_exec_dev_cmd()
       checks the bit that corresponds to an aborted command in
       'outstanding_reqs' after it has been cleared and before it is reset.
    
     - High energy consumption if ufshcd_queuecommand() repeatedly returns
       SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY.
    
    Fix this by reporting to the SCSI error handler that aborting a SCSI
    command failed if the SCSI command was submitted to a WLUN.

    IB/hfi1: Adjust pkey entry in index 0
    
    [ Upstream commit 62004871e1fa7f9a60797595c03477af5b5ec36f ]
    
    It is possible for the primary IPoIB network device associated with any
    RDMA device to fail to join certain multicast groups preventing IPv6
    neighbor discovery and possibly other network ULPs from working
    correctly. The IPv4 broadcast group is not affected as the IPoIB network
    device handles joining that multicast group directly.
    
    This is because the primary IPoIB network device uses the pkey at ndex 0
    in the associated RDMA device's pkey table. Anytime the pkey value of
    index 0 changes, the primary IPoIB network device automatically modifies
    it's broadcast address (i.e. /sys/class/net/[ib0]/broadcast), since the
    broadcast address includes the pkey value, and then bounces carrier. This
    includes initial pkey assignment, such as when the pkey at index 0
    transitions from the opa default of invalid (0x0000) to some value such as
    the OPA default pkey for Virtual Fabric 0: 0x8001 or when the fabric
    manager is restarted with a configuration change causing the pkey at index
    0 to change. Many network ULPs are not sensitive to the carrier bounce and
    are not expecting the broadcast address to change including the linux IPv6
    stack.  This problem does not affect IPoIB child network devices as their
    pkey value is constant for all time.
    
    To mitigate this issue, change the default pkey in at index 0 to 0x8001 to
    cover the predominant case and avoid issues as ipoib comes up and the FM
    sweeps.
    
    At some point, ipoib multicast support should automatically fix
    non-broadcast addresses as it does with the primary broadcast address.

    clk: rockchip: drop GRF dependency for rk3328/rk3036 pll types
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fffe52fb336ec2063270a7305652a93ea677ca1 ]
    
    The rk3036/rk3328 pll types were converted to checking the lock status
    via the internal register in january 2020, so don't need the grf
    reference since then.
    
    But it was forgotten to remove grf check when deciding between the
    pll rate ops (read-only vs. read-write), so a clock driver without
    the needed grf reference might've been put into the read-only mode
    just because the grf reference was missing.
    
    This affected the rk356x that needs to reclock certain plls at boot.
    
    Fix this by removing the check for the grf for selecting the utilized
    operations.

    pinctrl: armada-37xx: Correct PWM pins definitions
    
    [ Upstream commit baf8d6899b1e8906dc076ef26cc633e96a8bb0c3 ]
    
    The PWM pins on North Bridge on Armada 37xx can be configured into PWM
    or GPIO functions. When in PWM function, each pin can also be configured
    to drive low on 0 and tri-state on 1 (LED mode).
    
    The current definitions handle this by declaring two pin groups for each
    pin:
    - group "pwmN" with functions "pwm" and "gpio"
    - group "ledN_od" ("od" for open drain) with functions "led" and "gpio"
    
    This is semantically incorrect. The correct definition for each pin
    should be one group with three functions: "pwm", "led" and "gpio".
    
    Change the "pwmN" groups to support "led" function.
    
    Remove "ledN_od" groups. This cannot break backwards compatibility with
    older device trees: no device tree uses it since there is no PWM driver
    for this SOC yet. Also "ledN_od" groups are not even documented.

    The power supply states of discharging, charging, full, etc, represent
    state of charging, not the capacity level of the battery (for which
    we have a separate property). Current HID usage tables to not allow
    for expressing charging state of the batteries found in generic
    styli, so we should simply assume that the battery is discharging
    even if current capacity is at 100% when battery strength reporting
    is done via HID interface. In fact, we were doing just that before
    commit 581c4484769e.
    
    This change helps UIs to not mis-represent fully charged batteries in
    styli as being charging/topping-off.

    queue_depth and SERVICE_CON_QUEUE_DEPTH, and track it for both heartbeat
    and IO, so the sq queue full accounting is correct.

    f2fs: compress: fix to set zstd compress level correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 01f6afd0f3ccaa2d5f7fb87e7bd910dc17eef06b ]
    
    As 5kft reported in [1]:
    
    set_compress_context() should set compress level into .i_compress_flag
    for zstd as well as lz4hc, otherwise, zstd compressor will still use
    default zstd compress level during compression, fix it.

    PCI: aardvark: Increase polling delay to 1.5s while waiting for PIO response
    
    commit 02bcec3ea5591720114f586960490b04b093a09e upstream.
    
    Measurements in different conditions showed that aardvark hardware PIO
    response can take up to 1.44s. Increase wait timeout from 1ms to 1.5s to
    ensure that we do not miss responses from hardware. After 1.44s hardware
    returns errors (e.g. Completer abort).
    
    The previous two patches fixed checking for PIO status, so now we can use
    it to also catch errors which are reported by hardware after 1.44s.
    
    After applying this patch, kernel can detect and print PIO errors to dmesg:
    
        [    6.879999] advk-pcie d0070000.pcie: Non-posted PIO Response Status: CA, 0xe00 @ 0x100004

    PCI: aardvark: Fix checking for PIO status
    
    commit fcb461e2bc8b83b7eaca20cb2221e8b940f2189c upstream.
    
    There is an issue that when PCIe switch is connected to an Armada 3700
    board, there will be lots of warnings about PIO errors when reading the
    config space. According to Aardvark PIO read and write sequence in HW
    specification, the current way to check PIO status has the following
    issues:
    
    1) For PIO read operation, it reports the error message, which should be
       avoided according to HW specification.
    
    2) For PIO read and write operations, it only checks PIO operation complete
       status, which is not enough, and error status should also be checked.
    
    This patch aligns the code with Aardvark PIO read and write sequence in HW
    specification on PIO status check and fix the warnings when reading config
    space.

    PCI: aardvark: Configure PCIe resources from 'ranges' DT property
    
    commit 64f160e19e9264a7f6d89c516baae1473b6f8359 upstream.
    
    In commit 6df6ba974a55 ("PCI: aardvark: Remove PCIe outbound window
    configuration") was removed aardvark PCIe outbound window configuration and
    commit description said that was recommended solution by HW designers.
    
    But that commit completely removed support for configuring PCIe IO
    resources without removing PCIe IO 'ranges' from DTS files. After that
    commit PCIe IO space started to be treated as PCIe MEM space and accessing
    it just caused kernel crash.
    
    Moreover implementation of PCIe outbound windows prior that commit was
    incorrect. It completely ignored offset between CPU address and PCIe bus
    address and expected that in DTS is CPU address always same as PCIe bus
    address without doing any checks. Also it completely ignored size of every
    PCIe resource specified in 'ranges' DTS property and expected that every
    PCIe resource has size 128 MB (also for PCIe IO range). Again without any
    check. Apparently none of PCIe resource has in DTS specified size of 128
    MB. So it was completely broken and thanks to how aardvark mask works,
    configuration was completely ignored.
    
    This patch reverts back support for PCIe outbound window configuration but
    implementation is a new without issues mentioned above. PCIe outbound
    window is required when DTS specify in 'ranges' property non-zero offset
    between CPU and PCIe address space. To address recommendation by HW
    designers as specified in commit description of 6df6ba974a55, set default
    outbound parameters as PCIe MEM access without translation and therefore
    for this PCIe 'ranges' it is not needed to configure PCIe outbound window.
    For PCIe IO space is needed to configure aardvark PCIe outbound window.
    
    This patch fixes kernel crash when trying to access PCIe IO space.

    this should be enough for simple operation.
    Normally this clock is enabled by default by firmware but there are

    PCI: Return ~0 data on pciconfig_read() CAP_SYS_ADMIN failure
    
    commit a8bd29bd49c4156ea0ec5a97812333e2aeef44e7 upstream.
    
    The pciconfig_read() syscall reads PCI configuration space using
    hardware-dependent config accessors.
    
    If the read fails on PCI, most accessors don't return an error; they
    pretend the read was successful and got ~0 data from the device, so the
    syscall returns success with ~0 data in the buffer.
    
    When the accessor does return an error, pciconfig_read() normally fills the
    user's buffer with ~0 and returns an error in errno.  But after
    e4585da22ad0 ("pci syscall.c: Switch to refcounting API"), we don't fill
    the buffer with ~0 for the EPERM "user lacks CAP_SYS_ADMIN" error.
    
    Userspace may rely on the ~0 data to detect errors, but after e4585da22ad0,
    that would not detect CAP_SYS_ADMIN errors.
    
    Restore the original behaviour of filling the buffer with ~0 when the
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN check fails.

    PCI: Restrict ASMedia ASM1062 SATA Max Payload Size Supported
    
    commit b12d93e9958e028856cbcb061b6e64728ca07755 upstream.
    
    The ASMedia ASM1062 SATA controller advertises Max_Payload_Size_Supported
    of 512, but in fact it cannot handle incoming TLPs with payload size of
    512.
    
    We discovered this issue on PCIe controllers capable of MPS = 512 (Aardvark
    and DesignWare), where the issue presents itself as an External Abort.
    Bjorn Helgaas says:
    
      Probably ASM1062 reports a Malformed TLP error when it receives a data
      payload of 512 bytes, and Aardvark, DesignWare, etc convert this to an
      arm64 External Abort. [1]
    
    To avoid this problem, limit the ASM1062 Max Payload Size Supported to 256
    bytes, so we set the Max Payload Size of devices that may send TLPs to the
    ASM1062 to 256 or less.

    PCI/portdrv: Enable Bandwidth Notification only if port supports it
    
    commit 00823dcbdd415c868390feaca16f0265101efab4 upstream.
    
    Previously we assumed that all Root Ports and Switch Downstream Ports
    supported Link Bandwidth Notification.  Per spec, this is only required
    for Ports supporting Links wider than x1 and/or multiple Link speeds
    (PCIe r5.0, sec 7.5.3.6).
    
    Because we assumed all Ports supported it, we tried to set up a Bandwidth
    Notification IRQ, which failed for devices that don't support IRQs at all,
    which meant pcieport didn't attach to the Port at all.
    
    Check the Link Bandwidth Notification Capability bit and enable the service
    only when the Port supports it.

    sched: Prevent balance_push() on remote runqueues
    
    commit 868ad33bfa3bf39960982682ad3a0f8ebda1656e upstream.
    
    sched_setscheduler() and rt_mutex_setprio() invoke the run-queue balance
    callback after changing priorities or the scheduling class of a task. The
    run-queue for which the callback is invoked can be local or remote.
    
    That's not a problem for the regular rq::push_work which is serialized with
    a busy flag in the run-queue struct, but for the balance_push() work which
    is only valid to be invoked on the outgoing CPU that's wrong. It not only
    triggers the debug warning, but also leaves the per CPU variable push_work
    unprotected, which can result in double enqueues on the stop machine list.
    
    Remove the warning and validate that the function is invoked on the
    outgoing CPU.

    ARM: 9105/1: atags_to_fdt: don't warn about stack size
    
    commit b30d0289de72c62516df03fdad8d53f552c69839 upstream.
    
    The merge_fdt_bootargs() function by definition consumes more than 1024
    bytes of stack because it has a 1024 byte command line on the stack,
    meaning that we always get a warning when building this file:
    
    arch/arm/boot/compressed/atags_to_fdt.c: In function 'merge_fdt_bootargs':
    arch/arm/boot/compressed/atags_to_fdt.c:98:1: warning: the frame size of 1032 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
    
    However, as this is the decompressor and we know that it has a very shallow
    call chain, and we do not actually risk overflowing the kernel stack
    at runtime here.
    
    This just shuts up the warning by disabling the warning flag for this
    file.

    libata: add ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM for Samsung 860 and 870 SSDs
    
    commit 8a6430ab9c9c87cb64c512e505e8690bbaee190b upstream.
    
    Commit ca6bfcb2f6d9 ("libata: Enable queued TRIM for Samsung SSD 860")
    limited the existing ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk from "Samsung SSD 8*",
    covering all Samsung 800 series SSDs, to only apply to "Samsung SSD 840*"
    and "Samsung SSD 850*" series based on information from Samsung.
    
    But there is a large number of users which is still reporting issues
    with the Samsung 860 and 870 SSDs combined with Intel, ASmedia or
    Marvell SATA controllers and all reporters also report these problems
    going away when disabling queued trims.
    
    Note that with AMD SATA controllers users are reporting even worse
    issues and only completely disabling NCQ helps there, this will be

    s390/qdio: fix roll-back after timeout on ESTABLISH ccw
    
    commit 2c197870e4701610ec3b1143808d4e31152caf30 upstream.
    
    When qdio_establish() times out while waiting for the ESTABLISH ccw to
    complete, it calls qdio_shutdown() to roll back all of its previous
    actions. But at this point the qdio_irq's state is still
    QDIO_IRQ_STATE_INACTIVE, so qdio_shutdown() will exit immediately
    without doing any actual work.
    
    Which means that eg. the qdio_irq's thinint-indicator stays registered,
    and cdev->handler isn't restored to its old value. And since
    commit 954d6235be41 ("s390/qdio: make thinint registration symmetric")
    the qdio_irq also stays on the tiq_list, so on the next qdio_establish()
    we might get a helpful BUG from the list-debugging code:

    As warned by smatch:

    those two functions call uvc_query_ctrl passing a pointer to
    a data at the DMA stack. those are used to send URBs via
    usb_control_msg(). Using DMA stack is not supported and should
    not work anymore on modern Linux versions.
    
    So, use a kmalloc'ed buffer.

    When a queue pair is created by the following call, it will not
    register the user memory if the page_store is NULL, and the
    entry->state will be set to VMCIQPB_CREATED_NO_MEM.

    When unmapping this queue pair, qp_host_unregister_user_memory() will
    be called to unregister the non-existent user memory, which will
    result in a null pointer reference. It will also change
    VMCIQPB_CREATED_NO_MEM to VMCIQPB_CREATED_MEM, which should not be
    present in this operation.
    
    Only when the qp broker has mem, it can unregister the user
    memory when unmapping the qp broker.
    
    Only when the qp broker has no mem, it can register the user
    memory when mapping the qp broker.

    during the firmware initialization and unlocked during the shutdown.
    While the TMR is locked, access to it is disallowed.
    
    Currently, the CCP driver does not shutdown the firmware during the
    kexec reboot, leaving the TMR memory locked.
    
    Register a callback to shutdown the SEV firmware on the kexec boot.

    dm crypt: Avoid percpu_counter spinlock contention in crypt_page_alloc()
    
    commit 528b16bfc3ae5f11638e71b3b63a81f9999df727 upstream.
    
    On systems with many cores using dm-crypt, heavy spinlock contention in
    percpu_counter_compare() can be observed when the page allocation limit
    for a given device is reached or close to be reached. This is due
    to percpu_counter_compare() taking a spinlock to compute an exact
    result on potentially many CPUs at the same time.
    
    Switch to non-exact comparison of allocated and allowed pages by using
    the value returned by percpu_counter_read_positive() to avoid taking
    the percpu_counter spinlock.
    
    This may over/under estimate the actual number of allocated pages by at
    most (batch-1) * num_online_cpus().
    
    Currently, batch is bounded by 32. The system on which this issue was
    first observed has 256 CPUs and 512GB of RAM. With a 4k page size, this
    change may over/under estimate by 31MB. With ~10G (2%) allowed dm-crypt
    allocations, this seems an acceptable error. Certainly preferred over
    running into the spinlock contention.
    
    This behavior was reproduced on an EC2 c5.24xlarge instance with 96 CPUs
    and 192GB RAM as follows, but can be provoked on systems with less CPUs
    as well.
    
     * Disable swap
     * Tune vm settings to promote regular writeback
         $ echo 50 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs
         $ echo 25 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
         $ echo $((128 * 1024 * 1024)) > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_bytes
    
     * Create 8 dmcrypt devices based on files on a tmpfs
     * Create and mount an ext4 filesystem on each crypt devices
     * Run stress-ng --hdd 8 within one of above filesystems
    
    Total %system usage collected from sysstat goes to ~35%. Write throughput
    on the underlying loop device is ~2GB/s. perf profiling an individual
    kworker kcryptd thread shows the following profile, indicating spinlock
    contention in percpu_counter_compare():

    commit 54784ffa5b267f57161eb8fbb811499f22a0a0bf upstream.
    
    Reading status register can fail in the interrupt handler.  In such
    case, the regmap_read() will not store anything useful under passed
    'val' variable and random stack value will be used to determine type of
    interrupt.
    
    Handle the regmap_read() failure to avoid handling interrupt type and
    triggering changed power supply event based on random stack value.

    For a request that has a priority level equal to or larger than

    defaults to setting the request new_ioprio field to IOPRIO_BE_NR. This

    crypto: public_key: fix overflow during implicit conversion
    
    commit f985911b7bc75d5c98ed24d8aaa8b94c590f7c6a upstream.
    
    Hit kernel warning like this, it can be reproduced by verifying 256
    bytes datafile by keyctl command, run script:
    RAWDATA=rawdata
    SIGDATA=sigdata
    
    modprobe pkcs8_key_parser
    
    rm -rf *.der *.pem *.pfx
    rm -rf $RAWDATA
    dd if=/dev/random of=$RAWDATA bs=256 count=1
    
    openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
      -subj "/C=CN/ST=GD/L=SZ/O=vihoo/OU=dev/CN=xx.com/emailAddress=yy@xx.com"
    
    KEY_ID=`openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -outform DER | keyctl \
      padd asymmetric 123 @s`
    
    keyctl pkey_sign $KEY_ID 0 $RAWDATA enc=pkcs1 hash=sha1 > $SIGDATA
    keyctl pkey_verify $KEY_ID 0 $RAWDATA $SIGDATA enc=pkcs1 hash=sha1
    
    Then the kernel reports:
     WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 344556 at crypto/rsa-pkcs1pad.c:540
       pkcs1pad_verify+0x160/0x190

    The reason of this issue, in function 'asymmetric_key_verify_signature':
    '.digest_size(u8) = params->in_len(u32)' leads overflow of an u8 value,
    so use u32 instead of u8 for digest_size field. And reorder struct

    commit b76d26d69ecc97ebb24aaf40427a13c808a4f488 upstream.
    
    There is no reason to assume that the IRQ rising edge (indicating that
    the device start up phase is done) will happen after we request the IRQ.
    If the device is already up by the time we request it, the call to
    'wait_for_completion_timeout()' will timeout and we will fail the device
    probe even though there's nothing wrong.
    
    Fix it by just polling the status register until we get the indication that
    the device is up and running. As a side effect of this fix, requesting the
    IRQ is also moved to after the setup function.

    arm64: head: avoid over-mapping in map_memory
    
    commit 90268574a3e8a6b883bd802d702a2738577e1006 upstream.
    
    The `compute_indices` and `populate_entries` macros operate on inclusive
    bounds, and thus the `map_memory` macro which uses them also operates
    on inclusive bounds.
    
    We pass `_end` and `_idmap_text_end` to `map_memory`, but these are
    exclusive bounds, and if one of these is sufficiently aligned (as a
    result of kernel configuration, physical placement, and KASLR), then:
    
    * In `compute_indices`, the computed `iend` will be in the page/block *after*
      the final byte of the intended mapping.
    
    * In `populate_entries`, an unnecessary entry will be created at the end
      of each level of table. At the leaf level, this entry will map up to
      SWAPPER_BLOCK_SIZE bytes of physical addresses that we did not intend
      to map.
    
    As we may map up to SWAPPER_BLOCK_SIZE bytes more than intended, we may
    violate the boot protocol and map physical address past the 2MiB-aligned
    end address we are permitted to map. As we map these with Normal memory
    attributes, this may result in further problems depending on what these
    physical addresses correspond to.
    
    The final entry at each level may require an additional table at that
    level. As EARLY_ENTRIES() calculates an inclusive bound, we allocate
    enough memory for this.
    
    Avoid the extraneous mapping by having map_memory convert the exclusive
    end address to an inclusive end address by subtracting one, and do
    likewise in EARLY_ENTRIES() when calculating the number of required
    tables. For clarity, comments are updated to more clearly document which
    boundaries the macros operate on.  For consistency with the other
    macros, the comments in map_memory are also updated to describe `vstart`
    and `vend` as virtual addresses.

    arm64: mm: Fix TLBI vs ASID rollover
    
    commit 5e10f9887ed85d4f59266d5c60dd09be96b5dbd4 upstream.
    
    When switching to an 'mm_struct' for the first time following an ASID
    rollover, a new ASID may be allocated and assigned to 'mm->context.id'.
    This reassignment can happen concurrently with other operations on the
    mm, such as unmapping pages and subsequently issuing TLB invalidation.
    
    Consequently, we need to ensure that (a) accesses to 'mm->context.id'
    are atomic and (b) all page-table updates made prior to a TLBI using the
    old ASID are guaranteed to be visible to CPUs running with the new ASID.
    
    This was found by inspection after reviewing the VMID changes from
    Shameer but it looks like a real (yet hard to hit) bug.

    commit a89f355e469dcda129c2522be4fdba00c1c74c83 upstream.
    
    In "qmp_cooling_devices_register", the count value is initially
    QMP_NUM_COOLING_RESOURCES, which is 2. Based on the initial count value,
    the memory for cooling_devs is allocated. Then while calling the
    "qmp_cooling_device_add" function, count value is post-incremented for
    each child node.
    
    This makes the out of bound access to the cooling_dev array. Fix it by
    passing the QMP_NUM_COOLING_RESOURCES definition to devm_kzalloc() and
    initializing the count to 0.
    
    While at it, let's also free the memory allocated to cooling_dev if no
    cooling device is found in DT and during unroll phase.

    commit 7261851e938f4b0fe8c0f5a8e627ae90e1ba9875 upstream.
    
    The ingenic_set_bias() function's "bias" argument is not a
    "enum pin_config_param", so its value should not be compared against
    values of that enum.
    
    This should fix the bias config not working on the X2000(E) SoCs.

    pinctrl: stmfx: Fix hazardous u8[] to unsigned long cast
    
    commit 1b73e588f47397dee6e4bdfd953e0306c60b5fe5 upstream.
    
    Casting a small array of u8 to an unsigned long is *never* OK:
    
    - it does funny thing when the array size is less than that of a long,
      as it accesses random places in the stack
    - it makes everything even more fun with a BE kernel
    
    Fix this by building the unsigned long used as a bitmap byte by byte,
    in a way that works across endianess and has no undefined behaviours.
    
    An extra BUILD_BUG_ON() catches the unlikely case where the array
    would be larger than a single unsigned long.

    The selftest for ftrace checks some features by checking if the README has
    text that states the feature is supported by that kernel. Unfortunately,
    this check gives false positives because it many not be checked if there's
    spaces in the string to check. This is due to the compare between the
    required variable with the ":README" string stripped, because neither has
    quotes around them.

     - if the loop ran through the whole list, priv->client is invalid and
    it is more appropriate and sufficient to check for the end of
    list_for_each_entry loop condition.

    xen: fix setting of max_pfn in shared_info
    
    commit 4b511d5bfa74b1926daefd1694205c7f1bcf677f upstream.
    
    Xen PV guests are specifying the highest used PFN via the max_pfn
    field in shared_info. This value is used by the Xen tools when saving
    or migrating the guest.
    
    Unfortunately this field is misnamed, as in reality it is specifying
    the number of pages (including any memory holes) of the guest, so it
    is the highest used PFN + 1. Renaming isn't possible, as this is a
    public Xen hypervisor interface which needs to be kept stable.
    
    The kernel will set the value correctly initially at boot time, but
    when adding more pages (e.g. due to memory hotplug or ballooning) a
    real PFN number is stored in max_pfn. This is done when expanding the
    p2m array, and the PFN stored there is even possibly wrong, as it
    should be the last possible PFN of the just added P2M frame, and not
    one which led to the P2M expansion.
    
    Fix that by setting shared_info->max_pfn to the last possible PFN + 1.

    powerpc/perf/hv-gpci: Fix counter value parsing
    
    commit f9addd85fbfacf0d155e83dbee8696d6df5ed0c7 upstream.
    
    H_GetPerformanceCounterInfo (0xF080) hcall returns the counter data in
    the result buffer. Result buffer has specific format defined in the PAPR
    specification. One of the fields is counter offset and width of the
    counter data returned.
    
    Counter data are returned in a unsigned char array in big endian byte
    order. To get the final counter data, the values must be left shifted
    byte at a time. But commit 220a0c609ad17 ("powerpc/perf: Add support for
    the hv gpci (get performance counter info) interface") made the shifting
    bitwise and also assumed little endian order. Because of that, hcall
    counters values are reported incorrectly.
    
    In particular this can lead to counters go backwards which messes up the
    counter prev vs now calculation and leads to huge counter value
    reporting:

    blk-zoned: allow BLKREPORTZONE without CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    
    commit 4d643b66089591b4769bcdb6fd1bfeff2fe301b8 upstream.
    
    A user space process should not need the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability set
    in order to perform a BLKREPORTZONE ioctl.
    
    Getting the zone report is required in order to get the write pointer.
    Neither read() nor write() requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, so it is reasonable
    that a user space process that can read/write from/to the device, also
    can get the write pointer. (Since e.g. writes have to be at the write
    pointer.)

    blk-zoned: allow zone management send operations without CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    
    commit ead3b768bb51259e3a5f2287ff5fc9041eb6f450 upstream.
    
    Zone management send operations (BLKRESETZONE, BLKOPENZONE, BLKCLOSEZONE
    and BLKFINISHZONE) should be allowed under the same permissions as write().
    (write() does not require CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
    
    Additionally, other ioctls like BLKSECDISCARD and BLKZEROOUT only check if
    the fd was successfully opened with FMODE_WRITE.
    (They do not require CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
    
    Currently, zone management send operations require both CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    and that the fd was successfully opened with FMODE_WRITE.
    
    Remove the CAP_SYS_ADMIN requirement, so that zone management send
    operations match the access control requirement of write(), BLKSECDISCARD
    and BLKZEROOUT.

    btrfs: zoned: fix double counting of split ordered extent
    
    commit f79645df806565a03abb2847a1d20e6930b25e7e upstream.
    
    btrfs_add_ordered_extent_*() add num_bytes to fs_info->ordered_bytes.
    Then, splitting an ordered extent will call btrfs_add_ordered_extent_*()
    again for split extents, leading to double counting of the region of
    a split extent. These leaked bytes are finally reported at unmount time
    as follow:
    
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): at unmount dio bytes count 364544
    
    Fix the double counting by subtracting split extent's size from
    fs_info->ordered_bytes.

    This happens when close_ctree is called while a dev_replace hasn't
    completed. In close_ctree, we suspend the dev_replace, but keep the
    replace target around so that we can resume the dev_replace procedure
    when we mount the root again. This is the call trace:

        btrfs_dev_replace_suspend_for_unmount();
        btrfs_close_devices():

                     &device->dev_state));
    
    However, since the replace target sticks around, there is a device
    with BTRFS_DEV_STATE_REPLACE_TGT set on close, and we fail the
    assertion in btrfs_close_one_device.
    
    To fix this, if we come across the replace target device when
    closing, we should properly reset it back to allocation state. This
    fix also ensures that if a non-target device has a corrupted state and
    has the BTRFS_DEV_STATE_REPLACE_TGT bit set, the assertion will still
    catch the error.

    btrfs: fix upper limit for max_inline for page size 64K
    
    commit 6f93e834fa7c5faa0372e46828b4b2a966ac61d7 upstream.
    
    The mount option max_inline ranges from 0 to the sectorsize (which is
    now equal to page size). But we parse the mount options too early and
    before the actual sectorsize is read from the superblock. So the upper
    limit of max_inline is unaware of the actual sectorsize and is limited
    by the temporary sectorsize 4096, even on a system where the default
    sectorsize is 64K.
    
    Fix this by reading the superblock sectorsize before the mount option
    parse.

    btrfs: do not do preemptive flushing if the majority is global rsv
    
    commit 114623979405abf0b143f9c6688b3ff00ee48338 upstream.
    
    A common characteristic of the bug report where preemptive flushing was
    going full tilt was the fact that the vast majority of the free metadata
    space was used up by the global reserve.  The hard 90% threshold would
    cover the majority of these cases, but to be even smarter we should take
    into account how much of the outstanding reservations are covered by the
    global block reserve.  If the global block reserve accounts for the vast
    majority of outstanding reservations, skip preemptive flushing, as it
    will likely just cause churn and pain.

    btrfs: reduce the preemptive flushing threshold to 90%
    
    commit 93c60b17f2b5fca2c5931d7944788d1ef5f25528 upstream.
    
    The preemptive flushing code was added in order to avoid needing to
    synchronously wait for ENOSPC flushing to recover space.  Once we're
    almost full however we can essentially flush constantly.  We were using
    98% as a threshold to determine if we were simply full, however in
    practice this is a really high bar to hit.  For example reports of
    systems running into this problem had around 94% usage and thus
    continued to flush.  Fix this by lowering the threshold to 90%, which is
    a more sane value, especially for smaller file systems.

    btrfs: wait on async extents when flushing delalloc
    
    commit e16460707e94c3d4c1b5418cb68b28b8efa903b2 upstream.
    
    I've been debugging an early ENOSPC problem in production and finally
    root caused it to this problem.  When we switched to the per-inode in
    38d715f494f2 ("btrfs: use btrfs_start_delalloc_roots in
    shrink_delalloc") I pulled out the async extent handling, because we
    were doing the correct thing by calling filemap_flush() if we had async
    extents set.  This would properly wait on any async extents by locking
    the page in the second flush, thus making sure our ordered extents were
    properly set up.
    
    However when I switched us back to page based flushing, I used
    sync_inode(), which allows us to pass in our own wbc.  The problem here
    is that sync_inode() is smarter than the filemap_* helpers, it tries to
    avoid calling writepages at all.  This means that our second call could
    skip calling do_writepages altogether, and thus not wait on the pagelock
    for the async helpers.  This means we could come back before any ordered
    extents were created and then simply continue on in our flushing
    mechanisms and ENOSPC out when we have plenty of space to use.
    
    Fix this by putting back the async pages logic in shrink_delalloc.  This
    allows us to bulk write out everything that we need to, and then we can
    wait in one place for the async helpers to catch up, and then wait on
    any ordered extents that are created.

    btrfs: wake up async_delalloc_pages waiters after submit
    
    commit ac98141d140444fe93e26471d3074c603b70e2ca upstream.
    
    We use the async_delalloc_pages mechanism to make sure that we've
    completed our async work before trying to continue our delalloc
    flushing.  The reason for this is we need to see any ordered extents
    that were created by our delalloc flushing.  However we're waking up
    before we do the submit work, which is before we create the ordered
    extents.  This is a pretty wide race window where we could potentially
    think there are no ordered extents and thus exit shrink_delalloc
    prematurely.  Fix this by waking us up after we've done the work to
    create ordered extents.

    btrfs: use delalloc_bytes to determine flush amount for shrink_delalloc
    
    commit 03fe78cc2942c55cc13be5ca42578750f17204a1 upstream.
    
    We have been hitting some early ENOSPC issues in production with more
    recent kernels, and I tracked it down to us simply not flushing delalloc
    as aggressively as we should be.  With tracing I was seeing us failing
    all tickets with all of the block rsvs at or around 0, with very little
    pinned space, but still around 120MiB of outstanding bytes_may_used.
    Upon further investigation I saw that we were flushing around 14 pages
    per shrink call for delalloc, despite having around 2GiB of delalloc
    outstanding.
    
    Consider the example of a 8 way machine, all CPUs trying to create a
    file in parallel, which at the time of this commit requires 5 items to
    do.  Assuming a 16k leaf size, we have 10MiB of total metadata reclaim
    size waiting on reservations.  Now assume we have 128MiB of delalloc
    outstanding.  With our current math we would set items to 20, and then
    set to_reclaim to 20 * 256k, or 5MiB.
    
    Assuming that we went through this loop all 3 times, for both
    FLUSH_DELALLOC and FLUSH_DELALLOC_WAIT, and then did the full loop
    twice, we'd only flush 60MiB of the 128MiB delalloc space.  This could
    leave a fair bit of delalloc reservations still hanging around by the
    time we go to ENOSPC out all the remaining tickets.
    
    Fix this two ways.  First, change the calculations to be a fraction of
    the total delalloc bytes on the system.  Prior to this change we were
    calculating based on dirty inodes so our math made more sense, now it's
    just completely unrelated to what we're actually doing.
    
    Second add a FLUSH_DELALLOC_FULL state, that we hold off until we've
    gone through the flush states at least once.  This will empty the system
    of all delalloc so we're sure to be truly out of space when we start
    failing tickets.
    
    I'm tagging stable 5.10 and forward, because this is where we started
    using the page stuff heavily again.  This affects earlier kernel
    versions as well, but would be a pain to backport to them as the
    flushing mechanisms aren't the same.

    io-wq: fix race between adding work and activating a free worker
    
    commit 94ffb0a282872c2f4b14f757fa1aef2302aeaabb upstream.
    
    The attempt to find and activate a free worker for new work is currently
    combined with creating a new one if we don't find one, but that opens
    io-wq up to a race where the worker that is found and activated can
    put itself to sleep without knowing that it has been selected to perform
    this new work.
    
    Fix this by moving the activation into where we add the new work item,
    then we can retain it within the wqe->lock scope and elimiate the race
    with the worker itself checking inside the lock, but sleeping outside of
    it.

    io-wq: fix wakeup race when adding new work
    
    commit 87df7fb922d18e96992aa5e824aa34b2065fef59 upstream.
    
    When new work is added, io_wqe_enqueue() checks if we need to wake or
    create a new worker. But that check is done outside the lock that
    otherwise synchronizes us with a worker going to sleep, so we can end
    up in the following situation:
    
    CPU0                            CPU1
    lock
    insert work
    unlock
    atomic_read(nr_running) != 0
                                    lock
                                    atomic_dec(nr_running)
    no wakeup needed
    
    Hold the wqe lock around the "need to wakeup" check. Then we can also get
    rid of the temporary work_flags variable, as we know the work will remain
    valid as long as we hold the lock.

    io_uring: fix io_try_cancel_userdata race for iowq
    
    commit dadebc350da2bef62593b1df007a6e0b90baf42a upstream.

    io_try_cancel_userdata() can be called from io_async_cancel() executing
    in the io-wq context, so the warning fires, which is there to alert
    anyone accessing task->io_uring->io_wq in a racy way. However,
    io_wq_put_and_exit() always first waits for all threads to complete,
    so the only detail left is to zero tctx->io_wq after the context is
    removed.
    
    note: one little assumption is that when IO_WQ_WORK_CANCEL, the executor
    won't touch ->io_wq, because io_wq_destroy() might cancel left pending
    requests in such a way.

    io_uring: add ->splice_fd_in checks
    
    commit 26578cda3db983b17cabe4e577af26306beb9987 upstream.
    
    ->splice_fd_in is used only by splice/tee, but no other request checks
    it for validity. Add the check for most of request types excluding
    reads/writes/sends/recvs, we don't want overhead for them and can leave
    them be as is until the field is actually used.

    Makefile: use -Wno-main in the full kernel tree
    
    commit 49832c819ab85b33b7a2a1429c8d067e82be2977 upstream.
    
    When using gcc (SUSE Linux) 7.5.0 (on openSUSE 15.3), I see a build
    warning:
    
      kernel/trace/trace_osnoise.c: In function 'start_kthread':
      kernel/trace/trace_osnoise.c:1461:8: warning: 'main' is usually a function [-Wmain]
        void *main = osnoise_main;
              ^~~~
    
    Quieten that warning by using "-Wno-main".  It's OK to use "main" as a
    declaration name in the kernel.
    
    Build-tested on most ARCHes.
    
    [ v2: only do it for gcc, since clang doesn't have that particular warning ]
