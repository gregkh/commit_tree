    pty: return EINVAL for TIOCGPTN for BSD ptys
    
    commit ded2f295a36d17838fe97e80d7b6ea83381474f8 upstream.
    
    Commit bbb63c514a3464342967237a51a21ea8f61ab951 (drivers:tty:fix up
    ENOIOCTLCMD error handling) changed the default return value from tty
    ioctl to be ENOTTY and not EINVAL. This is appropriate.
    
    But in case of TIOCGPTN for the old BSD ptys glibc started failing
    because it expects EINVAL to be returned. Only then it continues to
    obtain the pts name the other way around.
    
    So fix this case by explicit return of EINVAL in this case.

    mxs: uart: fix setting RTS from software
    
    commit a6833214cfc6fa8a7c59426af77794cc190c6cfc upstream.
    
    With the patch "serial: mxs-auart: fix the wrong RTS hardware flow control" the
    mainline mxs-uart driver now sets RTSEN only when hardware flow control is
    enabled via software. It is not possible any longer to set RTS manually via
    software. However, the manual modification is a valid operation.
    Regain the possibility to set RTS via software and only set RTSEN when hardware
    flow control is explicitly enabled via settermios cflag CRTSCTS.

    staging: vt6656: Fix inconsistent structure packing
    
    commit 1ee4c55fc9620451b2a825d793042a7e0775391b upstream.
    
    vt6656 has several headers that use the #pragma pack(1) directive to
    enable structure packing, but never disable it.  The layout of
    structures defined in other headers can then depend on which order the
    various headers are included in, breaking the One Definition Rule.
    
    In practice this resulted in crashes on x86_64 until the order of header
    inclusion was changed for some files in commit 11d404cb56ecd ('staging:
    vt6656: fix headers and add cfg80211.').  But we need a proper fix that
    won't be affected by future changes to the order of inclusion.
    
    This removes the #pragma pack(1) directives and adds __packed to the
    structure definitions for which packing appears to have been intended.

    8250/16?50: Add support for Broadcom TruManage redirected serial port
    
    commit ebebd49a8eab5e9aa1b1f8f1614ccc3c2120f886 upstream.
    
    Add support for the UART device present in Broadcom TruManage capable
    NetXtreme chips (ie: 5761m 5762, and 5725).
    
    This implementation has a hidden transmit FIFO, so running in single-byte
    interrupt mode results in too many interrupts.  The UART_CAP_HFIFO
    capability was added to track this.  It continues to reload the THR as long
    as the THRE and TSRE bits are set in the LSR up to a specified limit (1024
    is used here).

    commit 1ee0a224bc9aad1de496c795f96bc6ba2c394811 upstream.
    
    The tty is NULL when the port is hanging up.
    chase_port() needs to check for this.
    
    This patch is intended for stable series.
    The behavior was observed and tested in Linux 3.2 and 3.7.1.
    
    Johan Hovold submitted a more elaborate patch for the mainline kernel.

    xen: Fix stack corruption in xen_failsafe_callback for 32bit PVOPS guests.
    
    commit 9174adbee4a9a49d0139f5d71969852b36720809 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2013-0190 / XSA-40
    
    There has been an error on the xen_failsafe_callback path for failed
    iret, which causes the stack pointer to be wrong when entering the
    iret_exc error path.  This can result in the kernel crashing.
    
    In the classic kernel case, the relevant code looked a little like:
    
            popl %eax      # Error code from hypervisor
            jz 5f
            addl $16,%esp
            jmp iret_exc   # Hypervisor said iret fault
    5:      addl $16,%esp
                           # Hypervisor said segment selector fault
    
    Here, there are two identical addls on either option of a branch which
    appears to have been optimised by hoisting it above the jz, and
    converting it to an lea, which leaves the flags register unaffected.
    
    In the PVOPS case, the code looks like:
    
            popl_cfi %eax         # Error from the hypervisor
            lea 16(%esp),%esp     # Add $16 before choosing fault path
            CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET -16
            jz 5f
            addl $16,%esp         # Incorrectly adjust %esp again
            jmp iret_exc
    
    It is possible unprivileged userspace applications to cause this
    behaviour, for example by loading an LDT code selector, then changing
    the code selector to be not-present.  At this point, there is a race
    condition where it is possible for the hypervisor to return back to

    xen/grant-table: correctly initialize grant table version 1
    
    commit d0b4d64aadb9f4a90669848de9ef3819050a98cd upstream.
    
    Commit 85ff6acb075a484780b3d763fdf41596d8fc0970 (xen/granttable: Grant
    tables V2 implementation) changed the GREFS_PER_GRANT_FRAME macro from
    a constant to a conditional expression. The expression depends on
    grant_table_version being appropriately set. Unfortunately, at init
    time grant_table_version will be 0. The GREFS_PER_GRANT_FRAME
    conditional expression checks for "grant_table_version == 1", and
    therefore returns the number of grant references per frame for v2.
    
    This causes gnttab_init() to allocate fewer pages for gnttab_list, as
    a frame can old half the number of v2 entries than v1 entries. After
    gnttab_resume() is called, grant_table_version is appropriately
    set. nr_init_grefs will then be miscalculated and gnttab_free_count
    will hold a value larger than the actual number of free gref entries.
    
    If a guest is heavily utilizing improperly initialized v1 grant
    tables, memory corruption can occur. One common manifestation is
    corruption of the vmalloc list, resulting in a poisoned pointer
    derefrence when accessing /proc/meminfo or /proc/vmallocinfo:
    
    [   40.770064] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000200200001407
    [   40.770083] IP: [<ffffffff811a6fb0>] get_vmalloc_info+0x70/0x110

    [   40.770107] Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP
    [   40.770114] CPU 10
    
    This patch introduces a static variable, grefs_per_grant_frame, to
    cache the calculated value. gnttab_init() now calls
    gnttab_request_version() early so that grant_table_version and
    grefs_per_grant_frame can be appropriately set. A few BUG_ON()s have
    been added to prevent this type of bug from reoccurring in the future.

    ALSA: usb - fix race in creation of M-Audio Fast track pro driver
    
    commit b98ae2729dea161edc96c9d177459b6c28bcbba5 upstream.
    
    A patch in the 3.2 kernel caused regression with hotplugging the
    M-Audio Fast track pro, or sound after suspend. I don't have the
    device so I haven't done a full analysis, but it seems userspace
    (both udev and pulseaudio) got confused when a card was created,
    immediately destroyed, and then created again.
    
    However, at least one person in the bug report (martin djfun)
    reports that this patch resolves the issue for him. It also leaves
    a message in the log:
    "snd-usb-audio: probe of 1-1.1:1.1 failed with error -5" which is
    a bit misleading. It is better than non-working audio, but maybe
    there's a more elegant solution?

    s390/time: fix sched_clock() overflow
    
    commit ed4f20943cd4c7b55105c04daedf8d63ab6d499c upstream.
    
    Converting a 64 Bit TOD format value to nanoseconds means that the value
    must be divided by 4.096. In order to achieve that we multiply with 125
    and divide by 512.
    When used within sched_clock() this triggers an overflow after appr.
    417 days. Resulting in a sched_clock() return value that is much smaller
    than previously and therefore may cause all sort of weird things in
    subsystems that rely on a monotonic sched_clock() behaviour.
    
    To fix this implement a tod_to_ns() helper function which converts TOD
    values without overflow and call this function from both places that
    open coded the conversion: sched_clock() and kvm_s390_handle_wait().

    target: Fix use-after-free in LUN RESET handling
    
    commit 72b59d6ee8adaa51f70377db0a1917ed489bead8 upstream.
    
    If a backend IO takes a really long then an initiator might abort a
    command, and then when it gives up on the abort, send a LUN reset too,
    all before we process any of the original command or the abort.  (The
    abort will wait for the backend IO to complete too)
    
    When the backend IO final completes (or fails), the abort handling
    will proceed and queue up a "return aborted status" operation.  Then,
    while that's still pending, the LUN reset might find the original
    command still on the LUN's list of commands and try to return aborted
    status again, which leads to a use-after free when the first
    se_tfo->queue_status call frees the command and then the second
    se_tfo->queue_status call runs.
    
    Fix this by removing a command from the LUN state_list when we first
    are about to queue aborted status; we shouldn't do anything
    LUN-related after we've started returning status, so this seems like
    the correct thing to do.

    target: Fix missing CMD_T_ACTIVE bit regression for pending WRITEs
    
    commit e627c615553a356f6f70215ebb3933c6e057553e upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a regression bug introduced during v3.6.x code with
    the following commit to drop transport_add_cmd_to_queue(), which
    originally re-set CMD_T_ACTIVE during pending WRITE I/O submission:
    
    commit af8772926f019b7bddd7477b8de5f3b0f12bad21
    Author: Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>
    Date:   Sun Jul 8 15:58:49 2012 -0400
    
        target: replace the processing thread with a TMR work queue
    
    The following sequence happens for write commands (or any other
    commands with a data out phase):
    
     - The transport calls target_submit_cmd(), which sets CMD_T_ACTIVE in
       cmd->transport_state and sets cmd->t_state to TRANSPORT_NEW_CMD.
     - Things go on transport_generic_new_cmd(), which notices that the
       command needs to transfer data, so it sets cmd->t_state to
       TRANSPORT_WRITE_PENDING and calls transport_cmd_check_stop().
     - transport_cmd_check_stop() clears CMD_T_ACTIVE in cmd->transport_state
       and returns in the normal case.
     - Then we continue on to call ->se_tfo->write_pending().
     - The data comes back from the initiator, and the transport calls
       target_execute_cmd(), which sets cmd->t_state to TRANSPORT_PROCESSING
       and calls into the backend to actually write the data.
    
    At this point, the backend might take a long time to complete the
    command, since it has to do real IO.  If an abort request comes in for
    this command at this point, it will not wait for the command to finish
    since CMD_T_ACTIVE is not set.  Then when the command does finally
    finish, we blow up with use-after-free.
    
    Avoid this by setting CMD_T_ACTIVE in target_execute_cmd() so that
    transport_wait_for_tasks() waits for the command to finish executing.
    This matches the behavior from before commit 1389533ef944 ("target:
    remove transport_generic_handle_data"), when data was signaled via
    transport_generic_handle_data(), which set CMD_T_ACTIVE because it
    called transport_add_cmd_to_queue().

    commit 02522463c84748b3b8ad770f9424bcfa70a5b4c4 upstream.
    
    Marking non-present ptes as read-only can corrupt file ptes, breaking
    things like swap and file mappings.
    
    This patch ensures that we only manipulate user pte bits when the pte
    is marked present.

    firmware: make sure the fw file size is not 0
    
    commit 4adf07fba3bd64472921a01aae0e116f9f948b77 upstream.
    
    If the requested firmware file size is 0 bytes in the filesytem, we
    will try to vmalloc(0), which causes a warning:

    ALSA: hda/hdmi - Work around "alsactl restore" errors
    
    commit 6f54c361329dbb67dac9de174e938992651d12d7 upstream.
    
    When "alsactl restore" is performed on HDMI codecs, it tries to
    restore the channel map value since the channel map controls are
    writable.  But hdmi_chmap_ctl_put() returns -EBADFD when no PCM stream
    is assigned yet, and this results in an error message from alsactl.
    Although the error is harmless, it's certainly ugly and can be
    regarded as a regression.
    
    As a workaround, this patch changes the return code in such a case to
    be zero for making others happy.  (A slight excuse is: when the chmap
    is changed through the proper alsa-lib API, the PCM status is checked
    there anyway, so we don't have to be too strict in the kernel side.)
