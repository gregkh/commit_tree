    Fix firmware loader uevent buffer NULL pointer dereference
    
    commit 6f957724b94cb19f5c1c97efd01dd4df8ced323c upstream.
    
    The firmware class uevent function accessed the "fw_priv->buf" buffer
    without the proper locking and testing for NULL.  This is an old bug
    (looks like it goes back to 2012 and commit 1244691c73b2: "firmware
    loader: introduce firmware_buf"), but for some reason it's triggering
    only now in 4.2-rc1.
    
    Shuah Khan is trying to bisect what it is that causes this to trigger
    more easily, but in the meantime let's just fix the bug since others are
    hitting it too (at least Ingo reports having seen it as well).

    rbd: use GFP_NOIO in rbd_obj_request_create()
    
    commit 5a60e87603c4c533492c515b7f62578189b03c9c upstream.
    
    rbd_obj_request_create() is called on the main I/O path, so we need to
    use GFP_NOIO to make sure allocation doesn't blow back on us.  Not all
    callers need this, but I'm still hardcoding the flag inside rather than
    making it a parameter because a) this is going to stable, and b) those
    callers shouldn't really use rbd_obj_request_create() and will be fixed
    in the future.
    
    More memory allocation fixes will follow.

    fixing infinite OPEN loop in 4.0 stateid recovery
    
    commit e8d975e73e5fa05f983fbf2723120edcf68e0b38 upstream.
    
    Problem: When an operation like WRITE receives a BAD_STATEID, even though
    recovery code clears the RECLAIM_NOGRACE recovery flag before recovering
    the open state, because of clearing delegation state for the associated
    inode, nfs_inode_find_state_and_recover() gets called and it makes the
    same state with RECLAIM_NOGRACE flag again. As a results, when we restart
    looking over the open states, we end up in the infinite loop instead of
    breaking out in the next test of state flags.
    
    Solution: unset the RECLAIM_NOGRACE set because of
    calling of nfs_inode_find_state_and_recover() after returning from calling
    recover_open() function.

    watchdog: omap: assert the counter being stopped before reprogramming
    
    commit 530c11d432727c697629ad5f9d00ee8e2864d453 upstream.
    
    The omap watchdog has the annoying behaviour that writes to most
    registers don't have any effect when the watchdog is already running.
    Quoting the AM335x reference manual:
    
            To modify the timer counter value (the WDT_WCRR register),
            prescaler ratio (the WDT_WCLR[4:2] PTV bit field), delay
            configuration value (the WDT_WDLY[31:0] DLY_VALUE bit field), or
            the load value (the WDT_WLDR[31:0] TIMER_LOAD bit field), the
            watchdog timer must be disabled by using the start/stop sequence
            (the WDT_WSPR register).
    
    Currently the timer is stopped in the .probe callback but still there
    are possibilities that yield to a situation where omap_wdt_start is
    entered with the timer running (e.g. when /dev/watchdog is closed
    without stopping and then reopened). In such a case programming the
    timeout silently fails!
    
    To circumvent this stop the timer before reprogramming.
    
    Assuming one of the first things the watchdog user does is setting the
    timeout explicitly nothing too bad should happen because this explicit
    setting works fine.

    USB: usbfs: allow URBs to be reaped after disconnection
    
    commit 3f2cee73b650921b2e214bf487b2061a1c266504 upstream.
    
    The usbfs API has a peculiar hole: Users are not allowed to reap their
    URBs after the device has been disconnected.  There doesn't seem to be
    any good reason for this; it is an ad-hoc inconsistency.
    
    The patch allows users to issue the USBDEVFS_REAPURB and
    USBDEVFS_REAPURBNDELAY ioctls (together with their 32-bit counterparts
    on 64-bit systems) even after the device is gone.  If no URBs are
    pending for a disconnected device then the ioctls will return -ENODEV
    rather than -EAGAIN, because obviously no new URBs will ever be able
    to complete.
    
    The patch also adds a new capability flag for
    USBDEVFS_GET_CAPABILITIES to indicate that the reap-after-disconnect
    feature is supported.

    mac80211: prevent possible crypto tx tailroom corruption
    
    commit ab499db80fcf07c18e4053f91a619500f663e90e upstream.
    
    There was a possible race between
    ieee80211_reconfig() and
    ieee80211_delayed_tailroom_dec(). This could
    result in inability to transmit data if driver
    crashed during roaming or rekeying and subsequent
    skbs with insufficient tailroom appeared.
    
    This race was probably never seen in the wild
    because a device driver would have to crash AND
    recover within 0.5s which is very unlikely.
    
    I was able to prove this race exists after
    changing the delay to 10s locally and crashing
    ath10k via debugfs immediately after GTK
    rekeying. In case of ath10k the counter went below
    0. This was harmless but other drivers which
    actually require tailroom (e.g. for WEP ICV or
    MMIC) could end up with the counter at 0 instead
    of >0 and introduce insufficient skb tailroom
    failures because mac80211 would not resize skbs
    appropriately anymore.

    __bitmap_parselist: fix bug in empty string handling
    
    commit 2528a8b8f457d7432552d0e2b6f0f4046bb702f4 upstream.
    
    bitmap_parselist("", &mask, nmaskbits) will erroneously set bit zero in
    the mask.  The same bug is visible in cpumask_parselist() since it is
    layered on top of the bitmask code, e.g.  if you boot with "isolcpus=",
    you will actually end up with cpu zero isolated.
    
    The bug was introduced in commit 4b060420a596 ("bitmap, irq: add
    smp_affinity_list interface to /proc/irq") when bitmap_parselist() was
    generalized to support userspace as well as kernelspace.

    mmc: card: Fixup request missing in mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq
    
    commit 29535f7b797df35cc9b6b3bca635591cdd3dd2a8 upstream.
    
    The current handler of MMC_BLK_CMD_ERR in mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq function
    may cause new coming request permanent missing when the ongoing
    request (previoulsy started) complete end.
    
    The problem scenario is as follows:
    (1) Request A is ongoing;
    (2) Request B arrived, and finally mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() is called;
    (3) Request A encounters the MMC_BLK_CMD_ERR error;
    (4) In the error handling of MMC_BLK_CMD_ERR, suppose mmc_blk_cmd_err()
        end request A completed and return zero. Continue the error handling,
        suppose mmc_blk_reset() reset device success;
    (5) Continue the execution, while loop completed because variable ret
        is zero now;
    (6) Finally, mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() return without processing request B.
    
    The process related to the missing request may wait that IO request
    complete forever, possibly crashing the application or hanging the system.
    
    Fix this issue by starting new request when reset success.

    iser-target: release stale iser connections
    
    commit 2f1b6b7d9a815f341b18dfd26a363f37d4d3c96a upstream.
    
    When receiving a new iser connect request we serialize
    the pending requests by adding the newly created iser connection
    to the np accept list and let the login thread process the connect
    request one by one (np_accept_wait).
    
    In case we received a disconnect request before the iser_conn
    has begun processing (still linked in np_accept_list) we should
    detach it from the list and clean it up and not have the login
    thread process a stale connection. We do it only when the connection
    state is not already terminating (initiator driven disconnect) as
    this might lead us to access np_accept_mutex after the np was released
    in live shutdown scenarios.

    commit 88dcd2dab5c23b1c9cfc396246d8f476c872f0ca upstream.
    
    This patch converts iscsi-target code to use modern kthread.h API
    callers for creating RX/TX threads for each new iscsi_conn descriptor,
    and releasing associated RX/TX threads during connection shutdown.
    
    This is done using iscsit_start_kthreads() -> kthread_run() to start
    new kthreads from within iscsi_post_login_handler(), and invoking
    kthread_stop() from existing iscsit_close_connection() code.
    
    Also, convert iscsit_logout_post_handler_closesession() code to use
    cmpxchg when determing when iscsit_cause_connection_reinstatement()
    needs to sleep waiting for completion.

    crush: fix a bug in tree bucket decode
    
    commit 82cd003a77173c91b9acad8033fb7931dac8d751 upstream.
    
    struct crush_bucket_tree::num_nodes is u8, so ceph_decode_8_safe()
    should be used.  -Wconversion catches this, but I guess it went
    unnoticed in all the noise it spews.  The actual problem (at least for
    common crushmaps) isn't the u32 -> u8 truncation though - it's the
    advancement by 4 bytes instead of 1 in the crushmap buffer.

    Btrfs: use kmem_cache_free when freeing entry in inode cache
    
    commit c3f4a1685bb87e59c886ee68f7967eae07d4dffa upstream.
    
    The free space entries are allocated using kmem_cache_zalloc(),
    through __btrfs_add_free_space(), therefore we should use
    kmem_cache_free() and not kfree() to avoid any confusion and
    any potential problem. Looking at the kfree() definition at
    mm/slab.c it has the following comment:
    
      /*
       * (...)
       *
       * Don't free memory not originally allocated by kmalloc()
       * or you will run into trouble.
       */
    
    So better be safe and use kmem_cache_free().

    hwmon: (mcp3021) Fix broken output scaling
    
    commit 347d7e45bd09ce09cbc30d5cea9de377eb22f55c upstream.
    
    The mcp3021 scaling code is dividing the VDD (full-scale) value in
    millivolts by the A2D resolution to obtain the scaling factor. When VDD
    is 3300mV (the standard value) and the resolution is 12-bit (4096
    divisions), the result is a scale factor of 3300/4096, which is always
    one.  Effectively, the raw A2D reading is always being returned because
    no scaling is applied.
    
    This patch fixes the issue and simplifies the register-to-volts
    calculation, removing the unneeded "output_scale" struct member.

    tracing: Have branch tracer use recursive field of task struct
    
    commit 6224beb12e190ff11f3c7d4bf50cb2922878f600 upstream.
    
    Fengguang Wu's tests triggered a bug in the branch tracer's start up
    test when CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT set. This was because that config
    adds some debug logic in the per cpu field, which calls back into
    the branch tracer.
    
    The branch tracer has its own recursive checks, but uses a per cpu
    variable to implement it. If retrieving the per cpu variable calls
    back into the branch tracer, you can see how things will break.
    
    Instead of using a per cpu variable, use the trace_recursion field
    of the current task struct. Simply set a bit when entering the
    branch tracing and clear it when leaving. If the bit is set on
    entry, just don't do the tracing.
    
    There's also the case with lockdep, as the local_irq_save() called
    before the recursion can also trigger code that can call back into
    the function. Changing that to a raw_local_irq_save() will protect
    that as well.
    
    This prevents the recursion and the inevitable crash that follows.

    tracing/filter: Do not allow infix to exceed end of string
    
    commit 6b88f44e161b9ee2a803e5b2b1fbcf4e20e8b980 upstream.
    
    While debugging a WARN_ON() for filtering, I found that it is possible
    for the filter string to be referenced after its end. With the filter:
    
     # echo '>' > /sys/kernel/debug/events/ext4/ext4_truncate_exit/filter
    
    The filter_parse() function can call infix_get_op() which calls
    infix_advance() that updates the infix filter pointers for the cnt
    and tail without checking if the filter is already at the end, which
    will put the cnt to zero and the tail beyond the end. The loop then calls
    infix_next() that has
    
            ps->infix.cnt--;
            return ps->infix.string[ps->infix.tail++];
    
    The cnt will now be below zero, and the tail that is returned is
    already passed the end of the filter string. So far the allocation
    of the filter string usually has some buffer that is zeroed out, but
    if the filter string is of the exact size of the allocated buffer
    there's no guarantee that the charater after the nul terminating
    character will be zero.
    
    Luckily, only root can write to the filter.

    tracing/filter: Do not WARN on operand count going below zero
    
    commit b4875bbe7e68f139bd3383828ae8e994a0df6d28 upstream.
    
    When testing the fix for the trace filter, I could not come up with
    a scenario where the operand count goes below zero, so I added a
    WARN_ON_ONCE(cnt < 0) to the logic. But there is legitimate case
    that it can happen (although the filter would be wrong).
    
     # echo '>' > /sys/kernel/debug/events/ext4/ext4_truncate_exit/filter
    
    That is, a single operation without any operands will hit the path
    where the WARN_ON_ONCE() can trigger. Although this is harmless,
    and the filter is reported as a error. But instead of spitting out
    a warning to the kernel dmesg, just fail nicely and report it via
    the proper channels.

    xfs: fix remote symlinks on V5/CRC filesystems
    
    commit 2ac56d3d4bd625450a54d4c3f9292d58f6b88232 upstream.
    
    If we create a CRC filesystem, mount it, and create a symlink with
    a path long enough that it can't live in the inode, we get a very
    strange result upon remount:
    
    # ls -l mnt
    total 4
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 929 Jun 15 16:58 link -> XSLM
    
    XSLM is the V5 symlink block header magic (which happens to be
    followed by a NUL, so the string looks terminated).
    
    xfs_readlink_bmap() advanced cur_chunk by the size of the header
    for CRC filesystems, but never actually used that pointer; it
    kept reading from bp->b_addr, which is the start of the block,
    rather than the start of the symlink data after the header.
    
    Looks like this problem goes back to v3.10.
    
    Fixing this gets us reading the proper link target, again.

    commit 1c7518794a3647eb345d59ee52844e8a40405198 upstream.
    
    Allocate memory using GFP_NOIO when deleting a btree.  dm_btree_del()
    can be called via an ioctl and we don't want to recurse into the FS or

    dm btree remove: fix bug in redistribute3
    
    commit 4c7e309340ff85072e96f529582d159002c36734 upstream.
    
    redistribute3() shares entries out across 3 nodes.  Some entries were
    being moved the wrong way, breaking the ordering.  This manifested as a
    BUG() in dm-btree-remove.c:shift() when entries were removed from the
    btree.

    usb: xhci: Bugfix for NULL pointer deference in xhci_endpoint_init() function
    
    commit 3496810663922617d4b706ef2780c279252ddd6a upstream.
    
    virt_dev->num_cached_rings counts on freed ring and is not updated
    correctly. In xhci_free_or_cache_endpoint_ring() function, the free ring
    is added into cache and then num_rings_cache is incremented as below:
                    virt_dev->ring_cache[rings_cached] =
                            virt_dev->eps[ep_index].ring;
                    virt_dev->num_rings_cached++;
    here, free ring pointer is added to a current index and then
    index is incremented.
    So current index always points to empty location in the ring cache.
    For getting available free ring, current index should be decremented
    first and then corresponding ring buffer value should be taken from ring
    cache.
    
    But In function xhci_endpoint_init(), the num_rings_cached index is
    accessed before decrement.
                    virt_dev->eps[ep_index].new_ring =
                            virt_dev->ring_cache[virt_dev->num_rings_cached];
                    virt_dev->ring_cache[virt_dev->num_rings_cached] = NULL;
                    virt_dev->num_rings_cached--;
    This is bug in manipulating the index of ring cache.
    And it should be as below:
                    virt_dev->num_rings_cached--;
                    virt_dev->eps[ep_index].new_ring =
                            virt_dev->ring_cache[virt_dev->num_rings_cached];
                    virt_dev->ring_cache[virt_dev->num_rings_cached] = NULL;

    usb: dwc3: Reset the transfer resource index on SET_INTERFACE
    
    commit aebda618718157a69c0dc0adb978d69bc2b8723c upstream.
    
    This fixes an issue introduced in commit b23c843992b6 (usb: dwc3:
    gadget: fix DEPSTARTCFG for non-EP0 EPs) that made sure we would
    only use DEPSTARTCFG once per SetConfig.
    
    The trick is that we should use one DEPSTARTCFG per SetConfig *OR*
    SetInterface. SetInterface was completely missed from the original
    patch.
    
    This problem became aparent after commit 76e838c9f776 (usb: dwc3:
    gadget: return error if command sent to DEPCMD register fails)
    added checking of the return status of device endpoint commands.
    
    'Set Endpoint Transfer Resource' command was caught failing
    occasionally. This is because the Transfer Resource
    Index was not getting reset during a SET_INTERFACE request.
    
    Finally, to fix the issue, was we have to do is make sure that
    our start_config_issued flag gets reset whenever we receive a
    SetInterface request.
    
    To verify the problem (and its fix), all we have to do is run
    test 9 from testusb with 'testusb -t 9 -s 2048 -a -c 5000'.

    libata: increase the timeout when setting transfer mode
    
    commit d531be2ca2f27cca5f041b6a140504999144a617 upstream.
    
    I have a ST4000DM000 disk. If Linux is booted while the disk is spun down,
    the command that sets transfer mode causes the disk to spin up. The
    spin-up takes longer than the default 5s timeout, so the command fails and
    timeout is reported.
    
    Fix this by increasing the timeout to 15s, which is enough for the disk to
    spin up.

    i2c: at91: fix a race condition when using the DMA controller
    
    commit 93563a6a71bb69dd324fc7354c60fb05f84aae6b upstream.
    
    For TX transactions, the TXCOMP bit in the Status Register is cleared
    when the first data is written into the Transmit Holding Register.
    
    In the lines from at91_do_twi_transfer():
    at91_twi_write_data_dma(dev);
    at91_twi_write(dev, AT91_TWI_IER, AT91_TWI_TXCOMP);
    
    the TXCOMP interrupt may be enabled before the DMA controller has
    actually started to write into the THR. In such a case, the TXCOMP bit
    is still set into the Status Register so the interrupt is triggered
    immediately. The driver understands that a transaction completion has
    occurred but this transaction hasn't started yet. Hence the TXCOMP
    interrupt is no longer enabled by at91_do_twi_transfer() but instead
    by at91_twi_write_data_dma_callback().
    
    Also, the TXCOMP bit in the Status Register in not a clear on read flag
    but a snapshot of the transmission state at the time the Status
    Register is read.
    When a NACK error is dectected by the I2C controller, the TXCOMP, NACK
    and TXRDY bits are set together to 1 in the SR. If enabled, the TXCOMP
    interrupt is triggered at the same time. Also setting the TXRDY to 1
    triggers the DMA controller to write the next data into the THR. Such
    a write resets the TXCOMP bit to 0 in the SR. So depending on when the
    interrupt handler reads the SR, it may fail to detect the NACK error
    if it relies on the TXCOMP bit. The NACK bit and its interrupt should
    be used instead.
    
    For RX transactions, the TXCOMP bit in the Status Register is cleared
    when the START bit is set into the Control Register. However to unify
    the management of the TXCOMP bit when the DMA controller is used, the
    TXCOMP interrupt is now enabled by the DMA callbacks for both TX and
    RX transfers.

    jbd2: fix ocfs2 corrupt when updating journal superblock fails
    
    commit 6f6a6fda294506dfe0e3e0a253bb2d2923f28f0a upstream.
    
    If updating journal superblock fails after journal data has been
    flushed, the error is omitted and this will mislead the caller as a
    normal case.  In ocfs2, the checkpoint will be treated successfully
    and the other node can get the lock to update. Since the sb_start is
    still pointing to the old log block, it will rewrite the journal data
    during journal recovery by the other node. Thus the new updates will
    be overwritten and ocfs2 corrupts.  So in above case we have to return
    the error, and ocfs2_commit_cache will take care of the error and
    prevent the other node to do update first.  And only after recovering
    journal it can do the new updates.

    commit 7444a072c387a93ebee7066e8aee776954ab0e41 upstream.
    
    ext4_free_blocks is looping around the allocation request and mimics
    __GFP_NOFAIL behavior without any allocation fallback strategy. Let's
    remove the open coded loop and replace it with __GFP_NOFAIL. Without the
    flag the allocator has no way to find out never-fail requirement and
    cannot help in any way.

    ext4: correctly migrate a file with a hole at the beginning
    
    commit 8974fec7d72e3e02752fe0f27b4c3719c78d9a15 upstream.
    
    Currently ext4_ind_migrate() doesn't correctly handle a file which
    contains a hole at the beginning of the file.  This caused the migration
    to be done incorrectly, and then if there is a subsequent following
    delayed allocation write to the "hole", this would reclaim the same data
    blocks again and results in fs corruption.
    
      # assmuing 4k block size ext4, with delalloc enabled
      # skip the first block and write to the second block
      xfs_io -fc "pwrite 4k 4k" -c "fsync" /mnt/ext4/testfile
    
      # converting to indirect-mapped file, which would move the data blocks
      # to the beginning of the file, but extent status cache still marks
      # that region as a hole
      chattr -e /mnt/ext4/testfile
    
      # delayed allocation writes to the "hole", reclaim the same data block
      # again, results in i_blocks corruption

    ext4: be more strict when migrating to non-extent based file
    
    commit d6f123a9297496ad0b6335fe881504c4b5b2a5e5 upstream.
    
    Currently the check in ext4_ind_migrate() is not enough before doing the
    real conversion:
    
    a) delayed allocated extents could bypass the check on eh->eh_entries
       and eh->eh_depth
    
    This can be demonstrated by this script
    
      xfs_io -fc "pwrite 0 4k" -c "pwrite 8k 4k" /mnt/ext4/testfile
      chattr -e /mnt/ext4/testfile
    
    where testfile has two extents but still be converted to non-extent
    based file format.
    
    b) only extent length is checked but not the offset, which would result
       in data lose (delalloc) or fs corruption (nodelalloc), because
       non-extent based file only supports at most (12 + 2^10 + 2^20 + 2^30)
       blocks
    
    This can be demostrated by
    
      xfs_io -fc "pwrite 5T 4k" /mnt/ext4/testfile
      chattr -e /mnt/ext4/testfile
      sync
    
    If delalloc is enabled, dmesg prints
      EXT4-fs warning (device dm-4): ext4_block_to_path:105: block 1342177280 > max in inode 53
      EXT4-fs (dm-4): Delayed block allocation failed for inode 53 at logical offset 1342177280 with max blocks 1 with error 5
      EXT4-fs (dm-4): This should not happen!! Data will be lost
    
    If delalloc is disabled, e2fsck -nf shows corruption
      Inode 53, i_size is 5497558142976, should be 4096.  Fix? no
    
    Fix the two issues by
    
    a) forcing all delayed allocation blocks to be allocated before checking
       eh->eh_depth and eh->eh_entries
    b) limiting the last logical block of the extent is within direct map

    ext4: fix reservation release on invalidatepage for delalloc fs
    
    commit 9705acd63b125dee8b15c705216d7186daea4625 upstream.
    
    On delalloc enabled file system on invalidatepage operation
    in ext4_da_page_release_reservation() we want to clear the delayed
    buffer and remove the extent covering the delayed buffer from the extent
    status tree.
    
    However currently there is a bug where on the systems with page size >
    block size we will always remove extents from the start of the page
    regardless where the actual delayed buffers are positioned in the page.
    This leads to the errors like this:
    
    EXT4-fs warning (device loop0): ext4_da_release_space:1225:
    ext4_da_release_space: ino 13, to_free 1 with only 0 reserved data
    blocks
    
    This however can cause data loss on writeback time if the file system is
    in ENOSPC condition because we're releasing reservation for someones
    else delayed buffer.
    
    Fix this by only removing extents that corresponds to the part of the
    page we want to invalidate.
    
    This problem is reproducible by the following fio receipt (however I was
    only able to reproduce it with fio-2.1 or older.

    ext4: don't retry file block mapping on bigalloc fs with non-extent file
    
    commit 292db1bc6c105d86111e858859456bcb11f90f91 upstream.
    
    ext4 isn't willing to map clusters to a non-extent file.  Don't signal
    this with an out of space error, since the FS will retry the
    allocation (which didn't fail) forever.  Instead, return EUCLEAN so
    that the operation will fail immediately all the way back to userspace.
    
    (The fix is either to run e2fsck -E bmap2extent, or to chattr +e the file.)

    try to force them out to memory before calling invalidate_bdev().

    ext4: fix race between truncate and __ext4_journalled_writepage()
    
    commit bdf96838aea6a265f2ae6cbcfb12a778c84a0b8e upstream.
    
    The commit cf108bca465d: "ext4: Invert the locking order of page_lock
    and transaction start" caused __ext4_journalled_writepage() to drop
    the page lock before the page was written back, as part of changing
    the locking order to jbd2_journal_start -> page_lock.  However, this
    introduced a potential race if there was a truncate racing with the
    data=journalled writeback mode.
    
    Fix this by grabbing the page lock after starting the journal handle,
    and then checking to see if page had gotten truncated out from under
    us.
    
    This fixes a number of different warnings or BUG_ON's when running
    xfstests generic/086 in data=journalled mode, including:

    commit cab462140f8a183e3cca0b51c8b59ef715cb6148 upstream.
    
    With an RTL8191SU USB adaptor, sometimes the hints for a fragmented
    packet are set, but the packet length is too large. Allocate enough
    space to prevent memory corruption and a resulting kernel panic [1].

    AR93xx and newer needs to stop rx before tx to avoid getting the DMA

    This should reduce/fix the occurence of "Failed to stop Tx DMA" logspam.

    On A MIPS 32-cores machine a BUG_ON was triggered because some acesses to
    mtd->usecount were done without taking mtd_table_mutex.

            void (*release)(struct mtd_blktrans_dev *dev);
    ...
    };
    
    But we weren't following it.

    In big endian mode regmap_bulk_read gives incorrect data
    for byte reads.
    
    This is because memcpy of a single byte from an address

    arm64: vdso: work-around broken ELF toolchains in Makefile
    
    commit 6f1a6ae87c0c60d7c462ef8fd071f291aa7a9abb upstream.
    
    When building the kernel with a bare-metal (ELF) toolchain, the -shared
    option may not be passed down to collect2, resulting in silent corruption
    of the vDSO image (in particular, the DYNAMIC section is omitted).
    
    The effect of this corruption is that the dynamic linker fails to find
    the vDSO symbols and libc is instead used for the syscalls that we
    intended to optimise (e.g. gettimeofday). Functionally, there is no
    issue as the sigreturn trampoline is still intact and located by the
    kernel.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by explicitly passing -shared to the linker
    when building the vDSO.

    arm64: mm: Fix freeing of the wrong memmap entries with !SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP
    
    commit b9bcc919931611498e856eae9bf66337330d04cc upstream.
    
    The memmap freeing code in free_unused_memmap() computes the end of
    each memblock by adding the memblock size onto the base.  However,
    if SPARSEMEM is enabled then the value (start) used for the base
    may already have been rounded downwards to work out which memmap
    entries to free after the previous memblock.
    
    This may cause memmap entries that are in use to get freed.
    
    In general, you're not likely to hit this problem unless there
    are at least 2 memblocks and one of them is not aligned to a
    sparsemem section boundary.  Note that carve-outs can increase
    the number of memblocks by splitting the regions listed in the
    device tree.
    
    This problem doesn't occur with SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP, because the
    vmemmap code deals with freeing the unused regions of the memmap
    instead of requiring the arch code to do it.
    
    This patch gets the memblock base out of the memblock directly when
    computing the block end address to ensure the correct value is used.

    After secondary CPU boot or hotplug, the active_mm of the idle thread is
    &init_mm. The init_mm.pgd (swapper_pg_dir) is only meant for TTBR1_EL1
    and must not be set in TTBR0_EL1. Since when active_mm == &init_mm the
    TTBR0_EL1 is already set to the reserved value, there is no need to
    perform any context reset.

    ARC: add compiler barrier to LLSC based cmpxchg
    
    commit d57f727264f1425a94689bafc7e99e502cb135b5 upstream.
    
    When auditing cmpxchg call sites, Chuck noted that gcc was optimizing
    away some of the desired LDs.
    
    |       do {
    |               new = old = *ipi_data_ptr;
    |               new |= 1U << msg;
    |       } while (cmpxchg(ipi_data_ptr, old, new) != old);
    
    was generating to below
    
    | 8015cef8:     ld         r2,[r4,0]  <-- First LD
    | 8015cefc:     bset       r1,r2,r1
    |
    | 8015cf00:     llock      r3,[r4]  <-- atomic op
    | 8015cf04:     brne       r3,r2,8015cf10
    | 8015cf08:     scond      r1,[r4]
    | 8015cf0c:     bnz        8015cf00
    |
    | 8015cf10:     brne       r3,r2,8015cf00  <-- Branch doesn't go to orig LD
    
    Although this was fixed by adding a ACCESS_ONCE in this call site, it
    seems safer (for now at least) to add compiler barrier to LLSC based
    cmpxchg

    ALSA: hda - Fix the dock headphone output on Fujitsu Lifebook E780
    
    commit 4df3fd1700abbb53bd874143dfd1f9ac9e7cbf4b upstream.
    
    Fujitsu Lifebook E780 sets the sequence number 0x0f to only only of
    the two headphones, thus the driver tries to assign another as the
    line-out, and this results in the inconsistent mapping between the
    created jack ctl and the actual I/O.  Due to this, PulseAudio doesn't
    handle it properly and gets the silent output.
    
    The fix is to ignore the non-HP sequencer checks.

    ALSA: hda - Add headset support to Acer Aspire V5
    
    commit 7819717b11346b8a5420b223b46600e394049c66 upstream.
    
    Acer Aspire V5 with ALC282 codec needs the similar quirk like Dell
    laptops to support the headset mic.  The headset mic pin is 0x19 and
    it's not exposed by BIOS, thus we need to fix the pincfg as well.

    Disable write buffering on Toshiba ToPIC95
    
    commit 2fb22a8042fe96b4220843f79241c116d90922c4 upstream.
    
    Disable write buffering on the Toshiba ToPIC95 if it is enabled by
    somebody (it is not supposed to be a power-on default according to
    the datasheet). On the ToPIC95, practically no 32-bit Cardbus card
    will work under heavy load without locking up the whole system if
    this is left enabled. I tried about a dozen. It does not affect
    16-bit cards. This is similar to the O2 bugs in early controller
    revisions it seems.

    ipr: Increase default adapter init stage change timeout
    
    commit 45c44b5ff9caa743ed9c2bfd44307c536c9caf1e upstream.
    
    Increase the default init stage change timeout from 15 seconds to 30 seconds.
    This resolves issues we have seen with some adapters not transitioning
    to the first init stage within 15 seconds, which results in adapter
    initialization failures.
