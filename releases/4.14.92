    MIPS: Only include mmzone.h when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y
    
    commit 66a4059ba72c23ae74a7c702894ff76c4b7eac1f upstream.
    
    MIPS' asm/mmzone.h includes the machine/platform mmzone.h
    unconditionally, but since commit bb53fdf395ee ("MIPS: c-r4k: Add
    r4k_blast_scache_node for Loongson-3") is included by asm/rk4cache.h for
    all r4k-style configs regardless of CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES.
    
    This is problematic when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=n because both the
    loongson3 & ip27 mmzone.h headers unconditionally define the NODE_DATA
    preprocessor macro which is aready defined by linux/mmzone.h, resulting
    in the following build error:
    
      In file included from ./arch/mips/include/asm/mmzone.h:10,
                       from ./arch/mips/include/asm/r4kcache.h:23,
                       from arch/mips/mm/c-r4k.c:33:
      ./arch/mips/include/asm/mach-loongson64/mmzone.h:48: error: "NODE_DATA" redefined [-Werror]
       #define NODE_DATA(n)  (&__node_data[(n)]->pglist)
    
      In file included from ./include/linux/topology.h:32,
                       from ./include/linux/irq.h:19,
                       from ./include/asm-generic/hardirq.h:13,
                       from ./arch/mips/include/asm/hardirq.h:16,
                       from ./include/linux/hardirq.h:9,
                       from arch/mips/mm/c-r4k.c:11:
      ./include/linux/mmzone.h:907: note: this is the location of the previous definition
       #define NODE_DATA(nid)  (&contig_page_data)
    
    Resolve this by only including the machine mmzone.h when
    CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y, which also removes the need for the empty
    mach-generic version of the header which we delete.

    rtc: m41t80: Correct alarm month range with RTC reads
    
    commit 3cc9ffbb1f51eb4320575a48e4805a8f52e0e26b upstream.
    
    Add the missing adjustment of the month range on alarm reads from the
    RTC, correcting an issue coming from commit 9c6dfed92c3e ("rtc: m41t80:
    add alarm functionality").  The range is 1-12 for hardware and 0-11 for
    `struct rtc_time', and is already correctly handled on alarm writes to
    the RTC.
    
    It was correct up until commit 48e9766726eb ("drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t80.c:
    remove disabled alarm functionality") too, which removed the previous
    implementation of alarm support.

    arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Force VM halt when changing the active state of GICv3 PPIs/SGIs
    
    commit 107352a24900fb458152b92a4e72fbdc83fd5510 upstream.
    
    We currently only halt the guest when a vCPU messes with the active
    state of an SPI. This is perfectly fine for GICv2, but isn't enough
    for GICv3, where all vCPUs can access the state of any other vCPU.
    
    Let's broaden the condition to include any GICv3 interrupt that
    has an active state (i.e. all but LPIs).

    arm64: KVM: Avoid setting the upper 32 bits of VTCR_EL2 to 1
    
    commit df655b75c43fba0f2621680ab261083297fd6d16 upstream.
    
    Although bit 31 of VTCR_EL2 is RES1, we inadvertently end up setting all
    of the upper 32 bits to 1 as well because we define VTCR_EL2_RES1 as
    signed, which is sign-extended when assigning to kvm->arch.vtcr.
    
    Lucky for us, the architecture currently treats these upper bits as RES0
    so, whilst we've been naughty, we haven't set fire to anything yet.

    CIFS: Fix error mapping for SMB2_LOCK command which caused OFD lock problem
    
    commit 9a596f5b39593414c0ec80f71b94a226286f084e upstream.
    
    While resolving a bug with locks on samba shares found a strange behavior.
    When a file locked by one node and we trying to lock it from another node
    it fail with errno 5 (EIO) but in that case errno must be set to
    (EACCES | EAGAIN).
    This isn't happening when we try to lock file second time on same node.
    In this case it returns EACCES as expected.
    Also this issue not reproduces when we use SMB1 protocol (vers=1.0 in
    mount options).
    
    Further investigation showed that the mapping from status_to_posix_error
    is different for SMB1 and SMB2+ implementations.
    For SMB1 mapping is [NT_STATUS_LOCK_NOT_GRANTED to ERRlock]
    (See fs/cifs/netmisc.c line 66)
    but for SMB2+ mapping is [STATUS_LOCK_NOT_GRANTED to -EIO]
    (see fs/cifs/smb2maperror.c line 383)
    
    Quick changes in SMB2+ mapping from EIO to EACCES has fixed issue.

    MIPS: Expand MIPS32 ASIDs to 64 bits
    
    commit ff4dd232ec45a0e45ea69f28f069f2ab22b4908a upstream.
    
    ASIDs have always been stored as unsigned longs, ie. 32 bits on MIPS32
    kernels. This is problematic because it is feasible for the ASID version
    to overflow & wrap around to zero.
    
    We currently attempt to handle this overflow by simply setting the ASID
    version to 1, using asid_first_version(), but we make no attempt to
    account for the fact that there may be mm_structs with stale ASIDs that
    have versions which we now reuse due to the overflow & wrap around.
    
    Encountering this requires that:
    
      1) A struct mm_struct X is active on CPU A using ASID (V,n).
    
      2) That mm is not used on CPU A for the length of time that it takes
         for CPU A's asid_cache to overflow & wrap around to the same
         version V that the mm had in step 1. During this time tasks using
         the mm could either be sleeping or only scheduled on other CPUs.
    
      3) Some other mm Y becomes active on CPU A and is allocated the same
         ASID (V,n).
    
      4) mm X now becomes active on CPU A again, and now incorrectly has the
         same ASID as mm Y.
    
    Where struct mm_struct ASIDs are represented above in the format
    (version, EntryHi.ASID), and on a typical MIPS32 system version will be
    24 bits wide & EntryHi.ASID will be 8 bits wide.
    
    The length of time required in step 2 is highly dependent upon the CPU &
    workload, but for a hypothetical 2GHz CPU running a workload which
    generates a new ASID every 10000 cycles this period is around 248 days.
    Due to this long period of time & the fact that tasks need to be
    scheduled in just the right (or wrong, depending upon your inclination)
    way, this is obviously a difficult bug to encounter but it's entirely
    possible as evidenced by reports.
    
    In order to fix this, simply extend ASIDs to 64 bits even on MIPS32
    builds. This will extend the period of time required for the
    hypothetical system above to encounter the problem from 28 days to
    around 3 trillion years, which feels safely outside of the realms of
    possibility.
    
    The cost of this is slightly more generated code in some commonly
    executed paths, but this is pretty minimal:
    
                             | Code Size Gain | Percentage
      -----------------------|----------------|-------------
        decstation_defconfig |           +270 | +0.00%
            32r2el_defconfig |           +652 | +0.01%
            32r6el_defconfig |          +1000 | +0.01%
    
    I have been unable to measure any change in performance of the LMbench
    lat_ctx or lat_proc tests resulting from the 64b ASIDs on either
    32r2el_defconfig+interAptiv or 32r6el_defconfig+I6500 systems.

    MIPS: Align kernel load address to 64KB
    
    commit bec0de4cfad21bd284dbddee016ed1767a5d2823 upstream.
    
    KEXEC needs the new kernel's load address to be aligned on a page
    boundary (see sanity_check_segment_list()), but on MIPS the default
    vmlinuz load address is only explicitly aligned to 16 bytes.
    
    Since the largest PAGE_SIZE supported by MIPS kernels is 64KB, increase
    the alignment calculated by calc_vmlinuz_load_addr to 64KB.

    commit adcc81f148d733b7e8e641300c5590a2cdc13bf3 upstream.
    
    Mapping the delay slot emulation page as both writeable & executable
    presents a security risk, in that if an exploit can write to & jump into
    the page then it can be used as an easy way to execute arbitrary code.
    
    Prevent this by mapping the page read-only for userland, and using
    access_process_vm() with the FOLL_FORCE flag to write to it from
    mips_dsemul().
    
    This will likely be less efficient due to copy_to_user_page() performing
    cache maintenance on a whole page, rather than a single line as in the
    previous use of flush_cache_sigtramp(). However this delay slot
    emulation code ought not to be running in any performance critical paths
    anyway so this isn't really a problem, and we can probably do better in
    copy_to_user_page() anyway in future.
    
    A major advantage of this approach is that the fix is small & simple to
    backport to stable kernels.

    f2fs: fix validation of the block count in sanity_check_raw_super
    
    commit 88960068f25fcc3759455d85460234dcc9d43fef upstream.
    
    Treat "block_count" from struct f2fs_super_block as 64-bit little endian
    value in sanity_check_raw_super() because struct f2fs_super_block
    declares "block_count" as "__le64".
    
    This fixes a bug where the superblock validation fails on big endian
    devices with the following error:
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Wrong segment_count / block_count (61439 > 0)
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Can't find valid F2FS filesystem in 1th superblock
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Wrong segment_count / block_count (61439 > 0)
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Can't find valid F2FS filesystem in 2th superblock
    As result of this the partition cannot be mounted.
    
    With this patch applied the superblock validation works fine and the
    partition can be mounted again:
      F2FS-fs (sda1): Mounted with checkpoint version = 7c84
    
    My little endian x86-64 hardware was able to mount the partition without
    this fix.
    To confirm that mounting f2fs filesystems works on big endian machines
    again I tested this on a 32-bit MIPS big endian (lantiq) device.

    (not in Linus's tree now, but in nf.git + linux-next.git already.)
    
    age is signed integer, so result can be negative when the timestamps
    have a large delta.  In this case we want to discard the entry.
    
    Instead of using age >= 2 || age < 0, just make it unsigned.

    netfilter: nf_conncount: fix garbage collection confirm race
    
    commit b36e4523d4d56e2595e28f16f6ccf1cd6a9fc452 upstream.
    
    Yi-Hung Wei and Justin Pettit found a race in the garbage collection scheme
    used by nf_conncount.
    
    When doing list walk, we lookup the tuple in the conntrack table.
    If the lookup fails we remove this tuple from our list because
    the conntrack entry is gone.
    
    This is the common cause, but turns out its not the only one.
    The list entry could have been created just before by another cpu, i.e. the
    conntrack entry might not yet have been inserted into the global hash.
    
    The avoid this, we introduce a timestamp and the owning cpu.
    If the entry appears to be stale, evict only if:
     1. The current cpu is the one that added the entry, or,
     2. The timestamp is older than two jiffies
    
    The second constraint allows GC to be taken over by other
    cpu too (e.g. because a cpu was offlined or napi got moved to another
    cpu).
    
    We can't pretend the 'doubtful' entry wasn't in our list.
    Instead, when we don't find an entry indicate via IS_ERR
    that entry was removed ('did not exist' or withheld
    ('might-be-unconfirmed').
    
    This most likely also fixes a xt_connlimit imbalance earlier reported by
    Dmitry Andrianov.

    Btrfs: fix fsync of files with multiple hard links in new directories
    
    commit 41bd60676923822de1df2c50b3f9a10171f4338a upstream.
    
    The log tree has a long standing problem that when a file is fsync'ed we
    only check for new ancestors, created in the current transaction, by
    following only the hard link for which the fsync was issued. We follow the
    ancestors using the VFS' dget_parent() API. This means that if we create a
    new link for a file in a directory that is new (or in an any other new
    ancestor directory) and then fsync the file using an old hard link, we end
    up not logging the new ancestor, and on log replay that new hard link and
    ancestor do not exist. In some cases, involving renames, the file will not
    exist at all.
    
    Example:
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
      mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      mkdir /mnt/A
      touch /mnt/foo
      ln /mnt/foo /mnt/A/bar
      xfs_io -c fsync /mnt/foo
    
      <power failure>
    
    In this example after log replay only the hard link named 'foo' exists
    and directory A does not exist, which is unexpected. In other major linux
    filesystems, such as ext4, xfs and f2fs for example, both hard links exist
    and so does directory A after mounting again the filesystem.
    
    Checking if any new ancestors are new and need to be logged was added in
    2009 by commit 12fcfd22fe5b ("Btrfs: tree logging unlink/rename fixes"),
    however only for the ancestors of the hard link (dentry) for which the
    fsync was issued, instead of checking for all ancestors for all of the
    inode's hard links.
    
    So fix this by tracking the id of the last transaction where a hard link
    was created for an inode and then on fsync fallback to a full transaction
    commit when an inode has more than one hard link and at least one new hard
    link was created in the current transaction. This is the simplest solution
    since this is not a common use case (adding frequently hard links for
    which there's an ancestor created in the current transaction and then
    fsync the file). In case it ever becomes a common use case, a solution
    that consists of iterating the fs/subvol btree for each hard link and
    check if any ancestor is new, could be implemented.
    
    This solves many unexpected scenarios reported by Jayashree Mohan and
    Vijay Chidambaram, and for which there is a new test case for fstests
    under review.

    cdc-acm: fix abnormal DATA RX issue for Mediatek Preloader.
    
    commit eafb27fa5283599ce6c5492ea18cf636a28222bb upstream.
    
    Mediatek Preloader is a proprietary embedded boot loader for loading
    Little Kernel and Linux into device DRAM.
    
    This boot loader also handle firmware update. Mediatek Preloader will be
    enumerated as a virtual COM port when the device is connected to Windows
    or Linux OS via CDC-ACM class driver. When the USB enumeration has been
    done, Mediatek Preloader will send out handshake command "READY" to PC
    actively instead of waiting command from the download tool.
    
    Since Linux 4.12, the commit "tty: reset termios state on device
    registration" (93857edd9829e144acb6c7e72d593f6e01aead66) causes Mediatek
    Preloader receiving some abnoraml command like "READYXX" as it sent.
    This will be recognized as an incorrect response. The behavior change
    also causes the download handshake fail. This change only affects
    subsequent connects if the reconnected device happens to get the same minor
    number.
    
    By disabling the ECHO termios flag could avoid this problem. However, it
    cannot be done by user space configuration when download tool open
    /dev/ttyACM0. This is because the device running Mediatek Preloader will
    send handshake command "READY" immediately once the CDC-ACM driver is
    ready.
    
    This patch wants to fix above problem by introducing "DISABLE_ECHO"
    property in driver_info. When Mediatek Preloader is connected, the
    CDC-ACM driver could disable ECHO flag in termios to avoid the problem.

    cgroup: fix CSS_TASK_ITER_PROCS
    
    commit e9d81a1bc2c48ea9782e3e8b53875f419766ef47 upstream.
    
    CSS_TASK_ITER_PROCS implements process-only iteration by making
    css_task_iter_advance() skip tasks which aren't threadgroup leaders;
    however, when an iteration is started css_task_iter_start() calls the
    inner helper function css_task_iter_advance_css_set() instead of
    css_task_iter_advance().  As the helper doesn't have the skip logic,
    when the first task to visit is a non-leader thread, it doesn't get
    skipped correctly as shown in the following example.
    
      # ps -L 2030
        PID   LWP TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
       2030  2030 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread
       2030  2031 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread
      # mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b
      # echo threaded > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/cgroup.type
      # echo threaded > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b/cgroup.type
      # echo 2030 > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/cgroup.procs
      # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/cgroup.threads
      2030
      2031
      # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/x/cgroup.procs
      2030
      # echo 2030 > /sys/fs/cgroup/x/a/b/cgroup.threads
      # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/x/cgroup.procs
      2031
      2030
    
    The last read of cgroup.procs is incorrectly showing non-leader 2031
    in cgroup.procs output.
    
    This can be fixed by updating css_task_iter_advance() to handle the
    first advance and css_task_iters_tart() to call
    css_task_iter_advance() instead of the inner helper.  After the fix,
    the same commands result in the following (correct) result:
    
      # ps -L 2062
        PID   LWP TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
       2062  2062 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread
       2062  2063 pts/0    Sl+    0:00 ./test-thread

    crypto: cavium/nitrox - fix a DMA pool free failure
    
    commit 7172122be6a4712d699da4d261f92aa5ab3a78b8 upstream.
    
    In crypto_alloc_context(), a DMA pool is allocated through dma_pool_alloc()
    to hold the crypto context. The meta data of the DMA pool, including the
    pool used for the allocation 'ndev->ctx_pool' and the base address of the
    DMA pool used by the device 'dma', are then stored to the beginning of the
    pool. These meta data are eventually used in crypto_free_context() to free
    the DMA pool through dma_pool_free(). However, given that the DMA pool can
    also be accessed by the device, a malicious device can modify these meta
    data, especially when the device is controlled to deploy an attack. This
    can cause an unexpected DMA pool free failure.
    
    To avoid the above issue, this patch introduces a new structure
    crypto_ctx_hdr and a new field chdr in the structure nitrox_crypto_ctx hold
    the meta data information of the DMA pool after the allocation. Note that
    the original structure ctx_hdr is not changed to ensure the compatibility.

    spi: bcm2835: Avoid finishing transfer prematurely in IRQ mode
    
    commit 56c1723426d3cfd4723bfbfce531d7b38bae6266 upstream.
    
    The IRQ handler bcm2835_spi_interrupt() first reads as much as possible
    from the RX FIFO, then writes as much as possible to the TX FIFO.
    Afterwards it decides whether the transfer is finished by checking if
    the TX FIFO is empty.
    
    If very few bytes were written to the TX FIFO, they may already have
    been transmitted by the time the FIFO's emptiness is checked.  As a
    result, the transfer will be declared finished and the chip will be
    reset without reading the corresponding received bytes from the RX FIFO.
    
    The odds of this happening increase with a high clock frequency (such
    that the TX FIFO drains quickly) and either passing "threadirqs" on the
    command line or enabling CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_BASE (such that the IRQ
    handler may be preempted between filling the TX FIFO and checking its
    emptiness).
    
    Fix by instead checking whether rx_len has reached zero, which means
    that the transfer has been received in full.  This is also more
    efficient as it avoids one bus read access per interrupt.  Note that
    bcm2835_spi_transfer_one_poll() likewise uses rx_len to determine
    whether the transfer has finished.

    spi: bcm2835: Fix book-keeping of DMA termination
    
    commit dbc944115eed48af110646992893dc43321368d8 upstream.
    
    If submission of a DMA TX transfer succeeds but submission of the
    corresponding RX transfer does not, the BCM2835 SPI driver terminates
    the TX transfer but neglects to reset the dma_pending flag to false.
    
    Thus, if the next transfer uses interrupt mode (because it is shorter
    than BCM2835_SPI_DMA_MIN_LENGTH) and runs into a timeout,
    dmaengine_terminate_all() will be called both for TX (once more) and
    for RX (which was never started in the first place).  Fix it.

    ext4: force inode writes when nfsd calls commit_metadata()
    
    commit fde872682e175743e0c3ef939c89e3c6008a1529 upstream.
    
    Some time back, nfsd switched from calling vfs_fsync() to using a new
    commit_metadata() hook in export_operations().  If the file system did
    not provide a commit_metadata() hook, it fell back to using
    sync_inode_metadata().  Unfortunately doesn't work on all file
    systems.  In particular, it doesn't work on ext4 due to how the inode
    gets journalled --- the VFS writeback code will not always call
    ext4_write_inode().
    
    So we need to provide our own ext4_nfs_commit_metdata() method which
    calls ext4_write_inode() directly.

    won't be properly terminated.

    ext4: add ext4_sb_bread() to disambiguate ENOMEM cases
    
    commit fb265c9cb49e2074ddcdd4de99728aefdd3b3592 upstream.
    
    Today, when sb_bread() returns NULL, this can either be because of an
    I/O error or because the system failed to allocate the buffer.  Since
    it's an old interface, changing would require changing many call
    sites.
    
    So instead we create our own ext4_sb_bread(), which also allows us to
    set the REQ_META flag.
    
    Also fixed a problem in the xattr code where a NULL return in a
    function could also mean that the xattr was not found, which could
    lead to the wrong error getting returned to userspace.

    commit 11a64a05dc649815670b1be9fe63d205cb076401 upstream.
    
    Depending on which functions are inlined in util/pmu.c, the snprintf()
    calls in perf_pmu__parse_{scale,unit,per_pkg,snapshot}() might trigger a
    warning:
    
      util/pmu.c: In function 'pmu_aliases':

                                   ^~
    
    I found this when trying to build perf from Linux 3.16 with gcc 8.
    However I can reproduce the problem in mainline if I force
    __perf_pmu__new_alias() to be inlined.
    
    Suppress this by using scnprintf() as has been done elsewhere in perf.

    platform-msi: Free descriptors in platform_msi_domain_free()
    
    commit 81b1e6e6a8590a19257e37a1633bec098d499c57 upstream.
    
    Since the addition of platform MSI support, there were two helpers
    supposed to allocate/free IRQs for a device:
    
        platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs()
        platform_msi_domain_free_irqs()
    
    In these helpers, IRQ descriptors are allocated in the "alloc" routine
    while they are freed in the "free" one.
    
    Later, two other helpers have been added to handle IRQ domains on top
    of MSI domains:
    
        platform_msi_domain_alloc()
        platform_msi_domain_free()
    
    Seen from the outside, the logic is pretty close with the former
    helpers and people used it with the same logic as before: a
    platform_msi_domain_alloc() call should be balanced with a
    platform_msi_domain_free() call. While this is probably what was
    intended to do, the platform_msi_domain_free() does not remove/free
    the IRQ descriptor(s) created/inserted in
    platform_msi_domain_alloc().
    
    One effect of such situation is that removing a module that requested
    an IRQ will let one orphaned IRQ descriptor (with an allocated MSI
    entry) in the device descriptors list. Next time the module will be
    inserted back, one will observe that the allocation will happen twice
    in the MSI domain, one time for the remaining descriptor, one time for
    the new one. It also has the side effect to quickly overshoot the
    maximum number of allocated MSI and then prevent any module requesting
    an interrupt in the same domain to be inserted anymore.
    
    This situation has been met with loops of insertion/removal of the
    mvpp2.ko module (requesting 15 MSIs each time).

    KVM: x86: Use jmp to invoke kvm_spurious_fault() from .fixup
    
    commit e81434995081fd7efb755fd75576b35dbb0850b1 upstream.
    
    ____kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() provides a generic exception fixup
    handler that is used to cleanly handle faults on VMX/SVM instructions
    during reboot (or at least try to).  If there isn't a reboot in
    progress, ____kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() treats any exception as
    fatal to KVM and invokes kvm_spurious_fault(), which in turn generates
    a BUG() to get a stack trace and die.
    
    When it was originally added by commit 4ecac3fd6dc2 ("KVM: Handle
    virtualization instruction #UD faults during reboot"), the "call" to
    kvm_spurious_fault() was handcoded as PUSH+JMP, where the PUSH'd value
    is the RIP of the faulting instructing.
    
    The PUSH+JMP trickery is necessary because the exception fixup handler
    code lies outside of its associated function, e.g. right after the
    function.  An actual CALL from the .fixup code would show a slightly
    bogus stack trace, e.g. an extra "random" function would be inserted
    into the trace, as the return RIP on the stack would point to no known
    function (and the unwinder will likely try to guess who owns the RIP).
    
    Unfortunately, the JMP was replaced with a CALL when the macro was
    reworked to not spin indefinitely during reboot (commit b7c4145ba2eb
    "KVM: Don't spin on virt instruction faults during reboot").  This
    causes the aforementioned behavior where a bogus function is inserted
    into the stack trace, e.g. my builds like to blame free_kvm_area().
    
    Revert the CALL back to a JMP.  The changelog for commit b7c4145ba2eb
    ("KVM: Don't spin on virt instruction faults during reboot") contains
    nothing that indicates the switch to CALL was deliberate.  This is
    backed up by the fact that the PUSH <insn RIP> was left intact.
    
    Note that an alternative to the PUSH+JMP magic would be to JMP back
    to the "real" code and CALL from there, but that would require adding
    a JMP in the non-faulting path to avoid calling kvm_spurious_fault()
    and would add no value, i.e. the stack trace would be the same.
    
    Using CALL:

    x86/mm: Drop usage of __flush_tlb_all() in kernel_physical_mapping_init()
    
    commit ba6f508d0ec4adb09f0a939af6d5e19cdfa8667d upstream.
    
    Commit:
    
      f77084d96355 "x86/mm/pat: Disable preemption around __flush_tlb_all()"
    
    addressed a case where __flush_tlb_all() is called without preemption
    being disabled. It also left a warning to catch other cases where
    preemption is not disabled.
    
    That warning triggers for the memory hotplug path which is also used for
    persistent memory enabling:
    
     WARNING: CPU: 35 PID: 911 at ./arch/x86/include/asm/tlbflush.h:460
     RIP: 0010:__flush_tlb_all+0x1b/0x3a

    Andy wondered why a path that can sleep was using __flush_tlb_all() [1]
    and Dave confirmed the expectation for TLB flush is for modifying /
    invalidating existing PTE entries, but not initial population [2]. Drop
    the usage of __flush_tlb_all() in phys_{p4d,pud,pmd}_init() on the
    expectation that this path is only ever populating empty entries for the
    linear map. Note, at linear map teardown time there is a call to the
    all-cpu flush_tlb_all() to invalidate the removed mappings.

    x86/speculation/l1tf: Drop the swap storage limit restriction when l1tf=off
    
    commit 5b5e4d623ec8a34689df98e42d038a3b594d2ff9 upstream.
    
    Swap storage is restricted to max_swapfile_size (~16TB on x86_64) whenever
    the system is deemed affected by L1TF vulnerability. Even though the limit
    is quite high for most deployments it seems to be too restrictive for
    deployments which are willing to live with the mitigation disabled.
    
    We have a customer to deploy 8x 6,4TB PCIe/NVMe SSD swap devices which is
    clearly out of the limit.
    
    Drop the swap restriction when l1tf=off is specified. It also doesn't make
    much sense to warn about too much memory for the l1tf mitigation when it is
    forcefully disabled by the administrator.

    qmi_wwan: apply SET_DTR quirk to the SIMCOM shared device ID
    
    commit 102cd909635612c0be784a519651954a7924c786 upstream.
    
    SIMCOM are reusing a single device ID for many (all of their?)
    different modems, based on different chipsets and firmwares. Newer
    Qualcomm chipset generations require setting DTR to wake the QMI
    function.  The SIM7600E modem is using such a chipset, making it
    fail to work with this driver despite the device ID match.
    
    Fix by unconditionally enabling the SET_DTR quirk for all SIMCOM
    modems using this specific device ID.  This is similar to what
    we already have done for another case of device IDs recycled over
    multiple chipset generations: 14cf4a771b30 ("drivers: net: usb:
    qmi_wwan: add QMI_QUIRK_SET_DTR for Telit PID 0x1201")
    
    Initial testing on an older SIM7100 modem shows no immediate side
    effects.

    usb: r8a66597: Fix a possible concurrency use-after-free bug in r8a66597_endpoint_disable()
    
    commit c85400f886e3d41e69966470879f635a2b50084c upstream.
    
    The function r8a66597_endpoint_disable() and r8a66597_urb_enqueue() may
    be concurrently executed.
    The two functions both access a possible shared variable "hep->hcpriv".
    
    This shared variable is freed by r8a66597_endpoint_disable() via the
    call path:
    r8a66597_endpoint_disable
      kfree(hep->hcpriv) (line 1995 in Linux-4.19)
    
    This variable is read by r8a66597_urb_enqueue() via the call path:
    r8a66597_urb_enqueue
      spin_lock_irqsave(&r8a66597->lock)
      init_pipe_info
        enable_r8a66597_pipe
          pipe = hep->hcpriv (line 802 in Linux-4.19)
    
    The read operation is protected by a spinlock, but the free operation
    is not protected by this spinlock, thus a concurrency use-after-free bug
    may occur.
    
    To fix this bug, the spin-lock and spin-unlock function calls in
    r8a66597_endpoint_disable() are moved to protect the free operation.

    ALSA: hda/tegra: clear pending irq handlers
    
    commit 63d2a9ec310d8bcc955574220d4631aa55c1a80c upstream.
    
    Even after disabling interrupts on the module, it could be possible
    that irq handlers are still running. System hang is seen during
    suspend path. It was found that, there were pending writes on the
    HDA bus and clock was disabled by that time.
    
    Above mentioned issue is fixed by clearing any pending irq handlers
    before disabling clocks and returning from hda suspend.

    commit 5ef108c53e6efd695e32aad969638ccbc35b4be9 upstream.
    
    An initial commit to add tracepoints for packets without CIP headers
    uses different print formats for added tracepoints. However this is not
    convenient for users/developers to prepare debug tools.
    
    This commit uses the same format for the two tracepoints.

    ALSA: firewire-lib: fix wrong handling payload_length as payload_quadlet
    
    commit ada79fa5a0b374dd2c2262137c734da7524a8263 upstream.
    
    In IEC 61883-1/6 engine of ALSA firewire stack, a packet handler has a
    second argument for 'the number of bytes in payload of isochronous
    packet'. However, an incoming packet handler without CIP header uses the
    value as 'the number of quadlets in the payload'. This brings userspace
    applications to receive the number of PCM frames as four times against
    real time.
    
    This commit fixes the bug.

    commit 3d16200a3e55a39caa1c88419cb559c00316f721 upstream.
    
    According to my memo at hand and saved records, writing 0x00000001 to

    mtd: atmel-quadspi: disallow building on ebsa110
    
    commit 2a9d92fb3a1282a4659f1bb6d5684018846537b7 upstream.
    
    I ran into a link-time error with the atmel-quadspi driver on the
    EBSA110 platform:
    
    drivers/mtd/built-in.o: In function `atmel_qspi_run_command':
    :(.text+0x1ee3c): undefined reference to `_memcpy_toio'
    :(.text+0x1ee48): undefined reference to `_memcpy_fromio'
    
    The problem is that _memcpy_toio/_memcpy_fromio are not available on
    that platform, and we have to prevent building the driver there.
    
    In case we want to backport this to older kernels: between linux-4.8
    and linux-4.20, the Kconfig entry was in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/Kconfig
    but had the same problem.

    commit 4aea96f4237cea0c51a8bc87c0db31f0f932f1f0 upstream.
    
    info.mode and info.port are indirectly controlled by user-space,
    hence leading to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1
    vulnerability.
    
    These issues were detected with the help of Smatch:
    
    sound/synth/emux/emux_hwdep.c:72 snd_emux_hwdep_misc_mode() warn: potential spectre issue 'emu->portptrs[i]->ctrls' [w] (local cap)

    sound/synth/emux/emux_hwdep.c:75 snd_emux_hwdep_misc_mode() warn: potential spectre issue 'emu->portptrs[info.port]->ctrls' [w] (local cap)
    
    Fix this by sanitizing both info.mode and info.port before using them
    to index emu->portptrs[i]->ctrls, emu->portptrs[info.port]->ctrls and
    emu->portptrs.
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].

    sock: Make sock->sk_stamp thread-safe
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a0ed3e9619738067214871e9cb826fa23b2ddb9 ]
    
    Al Viro mentioned (Message-ID
    <20170626041334.GZ10672@ZenIV.linux.org.uk>)
    that there is probably a race condition
    lurking in accesses of sk_stamp on 32-bit machines.
    
    sock->sk_stamp is of type ktime_t which is always an s64.
    On a 32 bit architecture, we might run into situations of
    unsafe access as the access to the field becomes non atomic.
    
    Use seqlocks for synchronization.
    This allows us to avoid using spinlocks for readers as
    readers do not need mutual exclusion.
    
    Another approach to solve this is to require sk_lock for all
    modifications of the timestamps. The current approach allows
    for timestamps to have their own lock: sk_stamp_lock.
    This allows for the patch to not compete with already
    existing critical sections, and side effects are limited
    to the paths in the patch.
    
    The addition of the new field maintains the data locality
    optimizations from
    commit 9115e8cd2a0c ("net: reorganize struct sock for better data
    locality")
    
    Note that all the instances of the sk_stamp accesses
    are either through the ioctl or the syscall recvmsg.

    [ Upstream commit 78abe3d0dfad196959b1246003366e2610775ea6 ]
    
    clcsock can be released while kernel_accept() references it in TCP
    listen worker. Also, clcsock needs to wake up before released if TCP
    fallback is used and the clcsock is blocked by accept. Add a lock to
    safely release clcsock and call kernel_sock_shutdown() to wake up
    clcsock from accept in smc_release().

    tipc: compare remote and local protocols in tipc_udp_enable()
    
    [ Upstream commit fb83ed496b9a654f60cd1d58a0e1e79ec5694808 ]
    
    When TIPC_NLA_UDP_REMOTE is an IPv6 mcast address but
    TIPC_NLA_UDP_LOCAL is an IPv4 address, a NULL-ptr deref is triggered
    as the UDP tunnel sock is initialized to IPv4 or IPv6 sock merely
    based on the protocol in local address.
    
    We should just error out when the remote address and local address
    have different protocols.

    tipc: use lock_sock() in tipc_sk_reinit()
    
    [ Upstream commit 15ef70e286176165d28b0b8a969b422561a68dfc ]
    
    lock_sock() must be used in process context to be race-free with
    other lock_sock() callers, for example, tipc_release(). Otherwise
    using the spinlock directly can't serialize a parallel tipc_release().
    
    As it is blocking, we have to hold the sock refcnt before
    rhashtable_walk_stop() and release it after rhashtable_walk_start().

    mlxsw: core: Increase timeout during firmware flash process
    
    [ Upstream commit cf0b70e71b32137ccf9c1f3dd9fb30cbf89b4322 ]
    
    During the firmware flash process, some of the EMADs get timed out, which
    causes the driver to send them again with a limit of 5 retries. There are
    some situations in which 5 retries is not enough and the EMAD access fails.
    If the failed EMAD was related to the flashing process, the driver fails
    the flashing.
    
    The reason for these timeouts during firmware flashing is cache misses in
    the CPU running the firmware. In case the CPU needs to fetch instructions
    from the flash when a firmware is flashed, it needs to wait for the
    flashing to complete. Since flashing takes time, it is possible for pending
    EMADs to timeout.
    
    Fix by increasing EMADs' timeout while flashing firmware.

    When the completion queue of the RQ is empty, do not immediately return.
    If left-over decompressed CQEs (from the previous cycle) were processed,
    need to go to the finalization part of the poll function.
    
    Bug exists only when CQE compression is turned ON.

    VSOCK: Send reset control packet when socket is partially bound
    
    [ Upstream commit a915b982d8f5e4295f64b8dd37ce753874867e88 ]
    
    If a server side socket is bound to an address, but not in the listening
    state yet, incoming connection requests should receive a reset control
    packet in response. However, the function used to send the reset
    silently drops the reset packet if the sending socket isn't bound
    to a remote address (as is the case for a bound socket not yet in
    the listening state). This change fixes this by using the src
    of the incoming packet as destination for the reset packet in
    this case.

    tcp: fix a race in inet_diag_dump_icsk()
    
    [ Upstream commit f0c928d878e7d01b613c9ae5c971a6b1e473a938 ]
    
    Alexei reported use after frees in inet_diag_dump_icsk() [1]
    
    Because we use refcount_set() when various sockets are setup and
    inserted into ehash, we also need to make sure inet_diag_dump_icsk()
    wont race with the refcount_set() operations.
    
    Jonathan Lemon sent a patch changing net_twsk_hashdance() but
    other spots would need risky changes.
    
    Instead, fix inet_diag_dump_icsk() as this bug came with
    linux-4.10 only.
    
    [1] Quoting Alexei :
    
    First something iterating over sockets finds already freed tw socket:
    
    refcount_t: increment on 0; use-after-free.

    __ptr_ring_swap_queue() tries to move pointers from the old
    ring to the new one, but it forgets to check if ->producer
    is beyond the new size at the end of the operation. This leads

    When x25_asy_open() fails, it already cleans up by itself,
    so its caller doesn't need to free the memory again.
    
    It seems we still have to call x25_asy_free() to clear the SLF_INUSE
    bit, so just set these pointers to NULL after kfree().

    nr_find_socket(), nr_find_peer() and nr_find_listener() lock the
    sock after finding it in the global list. However, the call path
    requires BH disabled for the sock lock consistently.
    
    Actually the locking is unnecessary at this point, we can just hold
    the sock refcnt to make sure it is not gone after we unlock the global
    list, and lock it later only when needed.

    net: phy: Fix the issue that netif always links up after resuming
    
    [ Upstream commit 8742beb50f2db903d3b6d69ddd81d67ce9914453 ]
    
    Even though the link is down before entering hibernation,
    there is an issue that the network interface always links up after resuming
    from hibernation.
    
    If the link is still down before enabling the network interface,
    and after resuming from hibernation, the phydev->state is forcibly set
    to PHY_UP in mdio_bus_phy_restore(), and the link becomes up.
    
    In suspend sequence, only if the PHY is attached, mdio_bus_phy_suspend()
    calls phy_stop_machine(), and mdio_bus_phy_resume() calls
    phy_start_machine().
    In resume sequence, it's enough to do the same as mdio_bus_phy_resume()
    because the state has been preserved.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by calling phy_start_machine() in
    mdio_bus_phy_restore() in the same way as mdio_bus_phy_resume().

    net: macb: restart tx after tx used bit read
    
    [ Upstream commit 4298388574dae6168fa8940b3edc7ba965e8a7ab ]
    
    On some platforms (currently detected only on SAMA5D4) TX might stuck
    even the pachets are still present in DMA memories and TX start was
    issued for them. This happens due to race condition between MACB driver
    updating next TX buffer descriptor to be used and IP reading the same
    descriptor. In such a case, the "TX USED BIT READ" interrupt is asserted.
    GEM/MACB user guide specifies that if a "TX USED BIT READ" interrupt
    is asserted TX must be restarted. Restart TX if used bit is read and
    packets are present in software TX queue. Packets are removed from software
    TX queue if TX was successful for them (see macb_tx_interrupt()).

    net: ipv4: do not handle duplicate fragments as overlapping
    
    [ Upstream commit ade446403bfb79d3528d56071a84b15351a139ad ]
    
    Since commit 7969e5c40dfd ("ip: discard IPv4 datagrams with overlapping
    segments.") IPv4 reassembly code drops the whole queue whenever an
    overlapping fragment is received. However, the test is written in a way
    which detects duplicate fragments as overlapping so that in environments
    with many duplicate packets, fragmented packets may be undeliverable.
    
    Add an extra test and for (potentially) duplicate fragment, only drop the
    new fragment rather than the whole queue. Only starting offset and length
    are checked, not the contents of the fragments as that would be too
    expensive. For similar reason, linear list ("run") of a rbtree node is not
    iterated, we only check if the new fragment is a subset of the interval
    covered by existing consecutive fragments.
    
    v2: instead of an exact check iterating through linear list of an rbtree
    node, only check if the new fragment is subset of the "run" (suggested
    by Eric Dumazet)

    ipv6: explicitly initialize udp6_addr in udp_sock_create6()
    
    [ Upstream commit fb24274546310872eeeaf3d1d53799d8414aa0f2 ]
    
    syzbot reported the use of uninitialized udp6_addr::sin6_scope_id.
    We can just set ::sin6_scope_id to zero, as tunnels are unlikely
    to use an IPv6 address that needs a scope id and there is no
    interface to bind in this context.
    
    For net-next, it looks different as we have cfg->bind_ifindex there
    so we can probably call ipv6_iface_scope_id().
    
    Same for ::sin6_flowinfo, tunnels don't use it.
    
    Fixes: 8024e02879dd ("udp: Add udp_sock_create for UDP tunnels to open listener socket")

    ibmveth: fix DMA unmap error in ibmveth_xmit_start error path
    
    [ Upstream commit 756af9c642329d54f048bac2a62f829b391f6944 ]
    
    Commit 33a48ab105a7 ("ibmveth: Fix DMA unmap error") fixed an issue in the
    normal code path of ibmveth_xmit_start() that was originally introduced by
    Commit 6e8ab30ec677 ("ibmveth: Add scatter-gather support"). This original
    fix missed the error path where dma_unmap_page is wrongly called on the
    header portion in descs[0] which was mapped with dma_map_single. As a
    result a failure to DMA map any of the frags results in a dmesg warning
    when CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is enabled.

    gro_cell: add napi_disable in gro_cells_destroy
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e1da73acded4751a93d4166458a7e640f37d26c ]
    
    Add napi_disable routine in gro_cells_destroy since starting from
    commit c42858eaf492 ("gro_cells: remove spinlock protecting receive
    queues") gro_cell_poll and gro_cells_destroy can run concurrently on
    napi_skbs list producing a kernel Oops if the tunnel interface is
    removed while gro_cell_poll is running. The following Oops has been
    triggered removing a vxlan device while the interface is receiving
    traffic

    ax25: fix a use-after-free in ax25_fillin_cb()
    
    [ Upstream commit c433570458e49bccea5c551df628d058b3526289 ]
    
    There are multiple issues here:
    
    1. After freeing dev->ax25_ptr, we need to set it to NULL otherwise
       we may use a dangling pointer.
    
    2. There is a race between ax25_setsockopt() and device notifier as
       reported by syzbot. Close it by holding RTNL lock.
    
    3. We need to test if dev->ax25_ptr is NULL before using it.

    ip6mr: Fix potential Spectre v1 vulnerability
    
    [ Upstream commit 69d2c86766da2ded2b70281f1bf242cb0d58a778 ]
    
    vr.mifi is indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
    a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
    
    net/ipv6/ip6mr.c:1845 ip6mr_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'mrt->vif_table' [r] (local cap)
    net/ipv6/ip6mr.c:1919 ip6mr_compat_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'mrt->vif_table' [r] (local cap)
    
    Fix this by sanitizing vr.mifi before using it to index mrt->vif_table'
    
    Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
    to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
    completed with a dependent load/store [1].
