    xen: xenbus driver must not accept invalid transaction ids
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 639b08810d6ad74ded2c5f6e233c4fcb9d147168 ]
    
    When accessing Xenstore in a transaction the user is specifying a
    transaction id which he normally obtained from Xenstore when starting
    the transaction. Xenstore is validating a transaction id against all
    known transaction ids of the connection the request came in. As all
    requests of a domain not being the one where Xenstore lives share
    one connection, validation of transaction ids of different users of
    Xenstore in that domain should be done by the kernel of that domain
    being the multiplexer between the Xenstore users in that domain and
    Xenstore.
    
    In order to prohibit one Xenstore user "hijacking" a transaction from
    another user the xenbus driver has to verify a given transaction id
    against all known transaction ids of the user before forwarding it to
    Xenstore.

    nvmet: fix KATO offset in Set Features
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c73f949300f17851f53fa80c9d1611ccd6909d3 ]
    
    The Set Features implementation for Keep Alive Timer was using the wrong
    structure when retrieving the KATO value; it was treating the Set
    Features command as a Property Set command.
    
    The NVMe spec defines the Keep Alive Timer feature as having one input
    in CDW11 (4 bytes at offset 44 in the command) whereas the code was
    reading 8 bytes at offset 48.
    
    Since the Linux NVMe over Fabrics host never sets this feature, this
    code has presumably never been tested.

    crypto: marvell - Copy IVDIG before launching partial DMA ahash requests
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 8759fec4af222f338d08f8f1a7ad6a77ca6cb301 ]
    
    Currently, inner IV/DIGEST data are only copied once into the hash
    engines and not set explicitly before launching a request that is not a
    first frag. This is an issue especially when multiple ahash reqs are
    computed in parallel or chained with cipher request, as the state of the
    request being computed is not updated into the hash engine. It leads to
    non-deterministic corrupted digest results.

    drm: Apply range restriction after color adjustment when allocation
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3db93756b501e5f0a3951c79cfa9ed43c26d3455 ]
    
    mm->color_adjust() compares the hole with its neighbouring nodes. They
    only abutt before we restrict the hole, so we have to apply color_adjust
    before we apply the range restriction.

    gpio: mockup: dynamically allocate memory for chip name
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ad6d8004fa29a8958381b60215e32d1e903b0492 ]
    
    Currently the chip name buffer is allocated on the stack and the
    address of the buffer is passed to the gpio framework. It's invalid
    after probe() returns, so the sysfs label attribute displays garbage.
    
    Use devm_kasprintf() for each string instead.

    ath10k: set CTS protection VDEV param only if VDEV is up
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7cfe0455ee1218add152e986b89b4bb8dbeafcdd ]
    
    The cts protection vdev parameter, in new QCA9377 TF2.0 firmware,
    requires bss peer to be created for the STATION vdev type.
    bss peer is being allocated by the firmware after vdev_start/_up commands.
    mac80211 may call the cts protection setup at any time, so the
    we needs to track the situation and defer the cts configuration
    to prevent firmware asserts, like below:

    ath10k: fix incorrect txpower set by P2P_DEVICE interface
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 88407beb1b1462f706a1950a355fd086e1c450b6 ]
    
    Ath10k reports the phy capability that supports P2P_DEVICE interface.
    
    When we use the P2P supported wpa_supplicant to start connection, it'll
    create two interfaces, one is wlan0 (vdev_id=0) and one is P2P_DEVICE
    p2p-dev-wlan0 which is for p2p control channel (vdev_id=1).
    
            ath10k_pci mac vdev create 0 (add interface) type 2 subtype 0
            ath10k_add_interface: vdev_id: 0, txpower: 0, bss_power: 0
            ...
            ath10k_pci mac vdev create 1 (add interface) type 2 subtype 1
            ath10k_add_interface: vdev_id: 1, txpower: 0, bss_power: 0
    
    And the txpower in per vif bss_conf will only be set to valid tx power when
    the interface is assigned with channel_ctx.
    
    But this P2P_DEVICE interface will never be used for any connection, so
    that the uninitialized bss_conf.txpower=0 is assinged to the
    arvif->txpower when interface created.
    
    Since the txpower configuration is firmware per physical interface.
    So the smallest txpower of all vifs will be the one limit the tx power
    of the physical device, that causing the low txpower issue on other
    active interfaces.
    
            wlan0: Limiting TX power to 21 (24 - 3) dBm
            ath10k_pci mac vdev_id 0 txpower 21
            ath10k_mac_txpower_recalc: vdev_id: 1, txpower: 0
            ath10k_mac_txpower_recalc: vdev_id: 0, txpower: 21
            ath10k_pci mac txpower 0
    
    This issue only happens when we use the wpa_supplicant that supports
    P2P or if we use the iw tool to create the control P2P_DEVICE interface.

    net: Allow IP_MULTICAST_IF to set index to L3 slave
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bb387c5ab12aeac3d5eea28686489ff46b53ca9 ]
    
    IP_MULTICAST_IF fails if sk_bound_dev_if is already set and the new index
    does not match it. e.g.,
    
        ntpd[15381]: setsockopt IP_MULTICAST_IF 192.168.1.23 fails: Invalid argument
    
    Relax the check in setsockopt to allow setting mc_index to an L3 slave if
    sk_bound_dev_if points to an L3 master.
    
    Make a similar change for IPv6. In this case change the device lookup to
    take the rcu_read_lock avoiding a refcnt. The rcu lock is also needed for
    the lookup of a potential L3 master device.
    
    This really only silences a setsockopt failure since uses of mc_index are
    secondary to sk_bound_dev_if if it is set. In both cases, if either index
    is an L3 slave or master, lookups are directed to the same FIB table so
    relaxing the check at setsockopt time causes no harm.
    
    Patch is based on a suggested change by Darwin for a problem noted in
    their code base.

    fscrypt: use ENOTDIR when setting encryption policy on nondirectory
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dffd0cfa06d4ed83bb3ae8eb067989ceec5d18e1 ]
    
    As part of an effort to clean up fscrypt-related error codes, make
    FS_IOC_SET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY fail with ENOTDIR when the file descriptor
    does not refer to a directory.  This is more descriptive than EINVAL,
    which was ambiguous with some of the other error cases.
    
    I am not aware of any users who might be relying on the previous error
    code of EINVAL, which was never documented anywhere, and in some buggy
    kernels did not exist at all as the S_ISDIR() check was missing.
    
    This failure case will be exercised by an xfstest.

    As part of an effort to clean up fscrypt-related error codes, make
    attempting to create a file in an encrypted directory that hasn't been
    "unlocked" fail with ENOKEY.  Previously, several error codes were used
    for this case, including ENOENT, EACCES, and EPERM, and they were not
    consistent between and within filesystems.  ENOKEY is a better choice
    because it expresses that the failure is due to lacking the encryption
    key.  It also matches the error code returned when trying to open an
    encrypted regular file without the key.
    
    I am not aware of any users who might be relying on the previous
    inconsistent error codes, which were never documented anywhere.
    
    This failure case will be exercised by an xfstest.

    If 'sun4i_backend_drm_format_to_layer()' does not return 0, then 'val' is
    left unmodified.
    As it is not initialized either, the return value can be anything.
    
    It is likely that returning the error code was expected here.
    
    As the only caller of 'sun4i_backend_update_layer_formats()' does not check

    PCI: Apply _HPX settings only to relevant devices
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 977509f7c5c6fb992ffcdf4291051af343b91645 ]
    
    Previously we didn't check the type of device before trying to apply Type 1
    (PCI-X) or Type 2 (PCIe) Setting Records from _HPX.
    
    We don't support PCI-X Setting Records, so this was harmless, but the
    warning was useless.
    
    We do support PCIe Setting Records, and we didn't check whether a device
    was PCIe before applying settings.  I don't think anything bad happened on
    non-PCIe devices because pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word(),
    pcie_cap_has_lnkctl(), etc., would fail before doing any harm.  But it's
    ugly to depend on those internals.
    
    Check the device type before attempting to apply Type 1 and Type 2 Setting
    Records (Type 0 records are applicable to PCI, PCI-X, and PCIe devices).
    
    A side benefit is that this prevents useless "not supported" warnings when
    a BIOS supplies a Type 1 (PCI-X) Setting Record and we try to apply it to
    every single device:
    
      pci 0000:00:00.0: PCI-X settings not supported
    
    After this patch, we'll get the warning only when a BIOS supplies a Type 1
    record and we have a PCI-X device to which it should be applied.

    e1000e: Avoid receiver overrun interrupt bursts
    
    commit 4aea7a5c5e940c1723add439f4088844cd26196d upstream.
    
    When e1000e_poll() is not fast enough to keep up with incoming traffic, the
    adapter (when operating in msix mode) raises the Other interrupt to signal
    Receiver Overrun.
    
    This is a double problem because 1) at the moment e1000_msix_other()
    assumes that it is only called in case of Link Status Change and 2) if the
    condition persists, the interrupt is repeatedly raised again in quick
    succession.
    
    Ideally we would configure the Other interrupt to not be raised in case of
    receiver overrun but this doesn't seem possible on this adapter. Instead,
    we handle the first part of the problem by reverting to the practice of
    reading ICR in the other interrupt handler, like before commit 16ecba59bc33
    ("e1000e: Do not read ICR in Other interrupt"). Thanks to commit
    0a8047ac68e5 ("e1000e: Fix msi-x interrupt automask") which cleared IAME
    from CTRL_EXT, reading ICR doesn't interfere with RxQ0, TxQ0 interrupts
    anymore. We handle the second part of the problem by not re-enabling the
    Other interrupt right away when there is overrun. Instead, we wait until
    traffic subsides, napi polling mode is exited and interrupts are
    re-enabled.

    e1000e: Separate signaling for link check/link up
    
    commit 19110cfbb34d4af0cdfe14cd243f3b09dc95b013 upstream.
    
    Lennart reported the following race condition:
    
    \ e1000_watchdog_task
        \ e1000e_has_link
            \ hw->mac.ops.check_for_link() === e1000e_check_for_copper_link
                /* link is up */
                mac->get_link_status = false;
    
                                /* interrupt */
                                \ e1000_msix_other
                                    hw->mac.get_link_status = true;
    
            link_active = !hw->mac.get_link_status
            /* link_active is false, wrongly */
    
    This problem arises because the single flag get_link_status is used to
    signal two different states: link status needs checking and link status is
    down.
    
    Avoid the problem by using the return value of .check_for_link to signal
    the link status to e1000e_has_link().

    fscrypt: lock mutex before checking for bounce page pool
    
    commit a0b3bc855374c50b5ea85273553485af48caf2f7 upstream.
    
    fscrypt_initialize(), which allocates the global bounce page pool when
    an encrypted file is first accessed, uses "double-checked locking" to
    try to avoid locking fscrypt_init_mutex.  However, it doesn't use any
    memory barriers, so it's theoretically possible for a thread to observe
    a bounce page pool which has not been fully initialized.  This is a
    classic bug with "double-checked locking".
    
    While "only a theoretical issue" in the latest kernel, in pre-4.8
    kernels the pointer that was checked was not even the last to be
    initialized, so it was easily possible for a crash (NULL pointer
    dereference) to happen.  This was changed only incidentally by the large
    refactor to use fs/crypto/.
    
    Solve both problems in a trivial way that can easily be backported: just
    always take the mutex.  It's theoretically less efficient, but it
    shouldn't be noticeable in practice as the mutex is only acquired very
    briefly once per encrypted file.
    
    Later I'd like to make this use a helper macro like DO_ONCE().  However,
    DO_ONCE() runs in atomic context, so we'd need to add a new macro that
    allows blocking.

    sched/rt: Simplify the IPI based RT balancing logic
    
    commit 4bdced5c9a2922521e325896a7bbbf0132c94e56 upstream.
    
    When a CPU lowers its priority (schedules out a high priority task for a
    lower priority one), a check is made to see if any other CPU has overloaded
    RT tasks (more than one). It checks the rto_mask to determine this and if so
    it will request to pull one of those tasks to itself if the non running RT
    task is of higher priority than the new priority of the next task to run on
    the current CPU.
    
    When we deal with large number of CPUs, the original pull logic suffered
    from large lock contention on a single CPU run queue, which caused a huge
    latency across all CPUs. This was caused by only having one CPU having
    overloaded RT tasks and a bunch of other CPUs lowering their priority. To
    solve this issue, commit:
    
      b6366f048e0c ("sched/rt: Use IPI to trigger RT task push migration instead of pulling")
    
    changed the way to request a pull. Instead of grabbing the lock of the
    overloaded CPU's runqueue, it simply sent an IPI to that CPU to do the work.
    
    Although the IPI logic worked very well in removing the large latency build
    up, it still could suffer from a large number of IPIs being sent to a single
    CPU. On a 80 CPU box, I measured over 200us of processing IPIs. Worse yet,
    when I tested this on a 120 CPU box, with a stress test that had lots of
    RT tasks scheduling on all CPUs, it actually triggered the hard lockup
    detector! One CPU had so many IPIs sent to it, and due to the restart
    mechanism that is triggered when the source run queue has a priority status
    change, the CPU spent minutes! processing the IPIs.
    
    Thinking about this further, I realized there's no reason for each run queue
    to send its own IPI. As all CPUs with overloaded tasks must be scanned
    regardless if there's one or many CPUs lowering their priority, because
    there's no current way to find the CPU with the highest priority task that
    can schedule to one of these CPUs, there really only needs to be one IPI
    being sent around at a time.
    
    This greatly simplifies the code!
    
    The new approach is to have each root domain have its own irq work, as the
    rto_mask is per root domain. The root domain has the following fields
    attached to it:
    
      rto_push_work  - the irq work to process each CPU set in rto_mask
      rto_lock       - the lock to protect some of the other rto fields
      rto_loop_start - an atomic that keeps contention down on rto_lock
                        the first CPU scheduling in a lower priority task
                        is the one to kick off the process.
      rto_loop_next  - an atomic that gets incremented for each CPU that
                        schedules in a lower priority task.
      rto_loop       - a variable protected by rto_lock that is used to
                        compare against rto_loop_next
      rto_cpu        - The cpu to send the next IPI to, also protected by
                        the rto_lock.
    
    When a CPU schedules in a lower priority task and wants to make sure
    overloaded CPUs know about it. It increments the rto_loop_next. Then it
    atomically sets rto_loop_start with a cmpxchg. If the old value is not "0",
    then it is done, as another CPU is kicking off the IPI loop. If the old
    value is "0", then it will take the rto_lock to synchronize with a possible
    IPI being sent around to the overloaded CPUs.
    
    If rto_cpu is greater than or equal to nr_cpu_ids, then there's either no
    IPI being sent around, or one is about to finish. Then rto_cpu is set to the
    first CPU in rto_mask and an IPI is sent to that CPU. If there's no CPUs set
    in rto_mask, then there's nothing to be done.
    
    When the CPU receives the IPI, it will first try to push any RT tasks that is
    queued on the CPU but can't run because a higher priority RT task is
    currently running on that CPU.
    
    Then it takes the rto_lock and looks for the next CPU in the rto_mask. If it
    finds one, it simply sends an IPI to that CPU and the process continues.
    
    If there's no more CPUs in the rto_mask, then rto_loop is compared with
    rto_loop_next. If they match, everything is done and the process is over. If
    they do not match, then a CPU scheduled in a lower priority task as the IPI
    was being passed around, and the process needs to start again. The first CPU
    in rto_mask is sent the IPI.
    
    This change removes this duplication of work in the IPI logic, and greatly
    lowers the latency caused by the IPIs. This removed the lockup happening on
    the 120 CPU machine. It also simplifies the code tremendously. What else
    could anyone ask for?
    
    Thanks to Peter Zijlstra for simplifying the rto_loop_start atomic logic and
    supplying me with the rto_start_trylock() and rto_start_unlock() helper
    functions.

    media: v4l2-ctrl: Fix flags field on Control events
    
    commit 9cac9d2fb2fe0e0cadacdb94415b3fe49e3f724f upstream.
    
    VIDIOC_DQEVENT and VIDIOC_QUERY_EXT_CTRL should give the same output for
    the control flags field.
    
    This patch creates a new function user_flags(), that calculates the user
    exported flags value (which is different than the kernel internal flags
    structure). This function is then used by all the code that exports the
    internal flags to userspace.

    powerpc/signal: Properly handle return value from uprobe_deny_signal()
    
    commit 46725b17f1c6c815a41429259b3f070c01e71bc1 upstream.
    
    When a uprobe is installed on an instruction that we currently do not
    emulate, we copy the instruction into a xol buffer and single step
    that instruction. If that instruction generates a fault, we abort the
    single stepping before invoking the signal handler. Once the signal
    handler is done, the uprobe trap is hit again since the instruction is
    retried and the process repeats.
    
    We use uprobe_deny_signal() to detect if the xol instruction triggered
    a signal. If so, we clear TIF_SIGPENDING and set TIF_UPROBE so that the
    signal is not handled until after the single stepping is aborted. In
    this case, uprobe_deny_signal() returns true and get_signal() ends up
    returning 0. However, in do_signal(), we are not looking at the return
    value, but depending on ksig.sig for further action, all with an
    uninitialized ksig that is not touched in this scenario. Fix the same
    by initializing ksig.sig to 0.

    parisc: Fix validity check of pointer size argument in new CAS implementation
    
    commit 05f016d2ca7a4fab99d5d5472168506ddf95e74f upstream.
    
    As noted by Christoph Biedl, passing a pointer size of 4 in the new CAS
    implementation causes a kernel crash.  The attached patch corrects the
    off by one error in the argument validity check.
    
    In reviewing the code, I noticed that we only perform word operations
    with the pointer size argument.  The subi instruction intentionally uses
    a word condition on 64-bit kernels.  Nullification was used instead of a
    cmpib instruction as the branch should never be taken.  The shlw
    pseudo-operation generates a depw,z instruction and it clears the target
    before doing a shift left word deposit.  Thus, we don't need to clip the
    upper 32 bits of this argument on 64-bit kernels.
    
    Tested with a gcc testsuite run with a 64-bit kernel.  The gcc atomic
    code in libgcc is the only direct user of the new CAS implementation
    that I am aware of.

    ixgbe: Fix skb list corruption on Power systems
    
    commit 0a9a17e3bb4564caf4bfe2a6783ae1287667d188 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue seen on Power systems with ixgbe which results
    in skb list corruption and an eventual kernel oops. The following is what
    was observed:
    
    CPU 1                                   CPU2
    ============================            ============================
    1: ixgbe_xmit_frame_ring                ixgbe_clean_tx_irq
    2:  first->skb = skb                     eop_desc = tx_buffer->next_to_watch
    3:  ixgbe_tx_map                         read_barrier_depends()
    4:   wmb                                 check adapter written status bit
    5:   first->next_to_watch = tx_desc      napi_consume_skb(tx_buffer->skb ..);
    6:   writel(i, tx_ring->tail);
    
    The read_barrier_depends is insufficient to ensure that tx_buffer->skb does not
    get loaded prior to tx_buffer->next_to_watch, which then results in loading
    a stale skb pointer. This patch replaces the read_barrier_depends with
    smp_rmb to ensure loads are ordered with respect to the load of
    tx_buffer->next_to_watch.

    commit 7b8edcc685b5e2c3c37aa13dc50a88e84a5bfef8 upstream.
    
    The original issue being fixed in this patch was seen with the ixgbe
    driver, but the same issue exists with fm10k as well, as the code is
    very similar. read_barrier_depends is not sufficient to ensure
    loads following it are not speculatively loaded out of order
    by the CPU, which can result in stale data being loaded, causing
    potential system crashes.

    ixgbevf: Use smp_rmb rather than read_barrier_depends
    
    commit ae0c585d93dfaf923d2c7eb44b2c3ab92854ea9b upstream.
    
    The original issue being fixed in this patch was seen with the ixgbe
    driver, but the same issue exists with ixgbevf as well, as the code is
    very similar. read_barrier_depends is not sufficient to ensure
    loads following it are not speculatively loaded out of order
    by the CPU, which can result in stale data being loaded, causing
    potential system crashes.

    NFC: fix device-allocation error return
    
    commit c45e3e4c5b134b081e8af362109905427967eb19 upstream.
    
    A recent change fixing NFC device allocation itself introduced an
    error-handling bug by returning an error pointer in case device-id
    allocation failed. This is clearly broken as the callers still expected
    NULL to be returned on errors as detected by Dan's static checker.
    
    Fix this up by returning NULL in the event that we've run out of memory
    when allocating a new device id.
    
    Note that the offending commit is marked for stable (3.8) so this fix
    needs to be backported along with it.

    libnvdimm, namespace: fix label initialization to use valid seq numbers
    
    commit b18d4b8a25af6fe83d7692191d6ff962ea611c4f upstream.
    
    The set of valid sequence numbers is {1,2,3}. The specification
    indicates that an implementation should consider 0 a sign of a critical
    error:
    
        UEFI 2.7: 13.19 NVDIMM Label Protocol
    
        Software never writes the sequence number 00, so a correctly
        check-summed Index Block with this sequence number probably indicates a
        critical error. When software discovers this case it treats it as an
        invalid Index Block indication.
    
    While the expectation is that the invalid block is just thrown away, the
    Robustness Principle says we should fix this to make both sequence
    numbers valid.

    KVM: SVM: obey guest PAT
    
    commit 15038e14724799b8c205beb5f20f9e54896013c3 upstream.
    
    For many years some users of assigned devices have reported worse
    performance on AMD processors with NPT than on AMD without NPT,
    Intel or bare metal.
    
    The reason turned out to be that SVM is discarding the guest PAT
    setting and uses the default (PA0=PA4=WB, PA1=PA5=WT, PA2=PA6=UC-,
    PA3=UC).  The guest might be using a different setting, and
    especially might want write combining but isn't getting it
    (instead getting slow UC or UC- accesses).
    
    Thanks a lot to geoff@hostfission.com for noticing the relation
    to the g_pat setting.  The patch has been tested also by a bunch
    of people on VFIO users forums.

    mtd: nand: mtk: fix infinite ECC decode IRQ issue
    
    commit 1d2fcdcf33339c7c8016243de0f7f31cf6845e8d upstream.
    
    For MT2701 NAND Controller, there may generate infinite ECC decode IRQ
    during long time burn test on some platforms. Once this issue occurred,
    the ECC decode IRQ status cannot be cleared in the IRQ handler function,
    and threads cannot be scheduled.
    
    ECC HW generates decode IRQ each sector, so there will have more than one
    decode IRQ if read one page of large page NAND.
    
    Currently, ECC IRQ handle flow is that we will check whether it is decode
    IRQ at first by reading the register ECC_DECIRQ_STA. This is a read-clear
    type register. If this IRQ is decode IRQ, then the ECC IRQ signal will be
    cleared at the same time.
    Secondly, we will check whether all sectors are decoded by reading the
    register ECC_DECDONE. This is because the current IRQ may be not dealed
    in time, and the next sectors have been decoded before reading the
    register ECC_DECIRQ_STA. Then, the next sectors's decode IRQs will not
    be generated.
    Thirdly, if all sectors are decoded by comparing with ecc->sectors, then we
    will complete ecc->done, set ecc->sectors as 0, and disable ECC IRQ by
    programming the register ECC_IRQ_REG(op) as 0. Otherwise, wait for the
    next ECC IRQ.
    
    But, there is a timing issue between step one and two. When we read the
    reigster ECC_DECIRQ_STA, all sectors are decoded except the last sector,
    and the ECC IRQ signal is cleared. But the last sector is decoded before
    reading ECC_DECDONE, so the ECC IRQ signal is enabled again by ECC HW, and
    it means we will receive one extra ECC IRQ later. In step three, we will
    find that all sectors were decoded, then disable ECC IRQ and return.
    When deal with the extra ECC IRQ, the ECC IRQ status cannot be cleared
    anymore. That is because the register ECC_DECIRQ_STA can only be cleared
    when the register ECC_IRQ_REG(op) is enabled. But actually we have
    disabled ECC IRQ in the previous ECC IRQ handle. So, there will
    keep receiving ECC decode IRQ.
    
    Now, we read the register ECC_DECIRQ_STA once again before completing the
    ecc done event. This ensures that there will be no extra ECC decode IRQ.
    
    Also, remove writel(0, ecc->regs + ECC_IRQ_REG(op)) from irq handler,
    because ECC IRQ is disabled in mtk_ecc_disable(). And clear ECC_DECIRQ_STA
    in mtk_ecc_disable() in case there is a timeout to wait decode IRQ.

    commit 30863e38ebeb500a31cecee8096fb5002677dd9b upstream.
    
    When mtdoops calls mtd_panic_write(), it eventually calls
    panic_nand_write() in nand_base.c. In order to properly wait for the
    nand chip to be ready in panic_nand_wait(), the chip must first be

    When using the atmel nand flash controller, a panic would occur due to
    a NULL pointer exception.

    mtd: nand: omap2: Fix subpage write
    
    commit 739c64414f01748a36e7d82c8e0611dea94412bd upstream.
    
    Since v4.12, NAND subpage writes were causing a NULL pointer
    dereference on OMAP platforms (omap2-nand) using OMAP_ECC_BCH4_CODE_HW,
    OMAP_ECC_BCH8_CODE_HW and OMAP_ECC_BCH16_CODE_HW.
    
    This is because for those ECC modes, omap_calculate_ecc_bch()
    generates ECC bytes for the entire (multi-sector) page and this can
    overflow the ECC buffer provided by nand_write_subpage_hwecc()
    as it expects ecc.calculate() to return ECC bytes for just one sector.
    
    However, the root cause of the problem is present since v3.9
    but was not seen then as NAND buffers were being allocated
    as one big chunk prior to commit 3deb9979c731 ("mtd: nand: allocate
    aligned buffers if NAND_OWN_BUFFERS is unset").
    
    Fix the issue by providing a OMAP optimized write_subpage()
    implementation.

    target: Fix QUEUE_FULL + SCSI task attribute handling
    
    commit 1c79df1f349fb6050016cea4ef1dfbc3853a5685 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a bug during QUEUE_FULL where transport_complete_qf()
    calls transport_complete_task_attr() after it's already been invoked
    by target_complete_ok_work() or transport_generic_request_failure()
    during initial completion, preceeding QUEUE_FULL.
    
    This will result in se_device->simple_cmds, se_device->dev_cur_ordered_id
    and/or se_device->dev_ordered_sync being updated multiple times for
    a single se_cmd.
    
    To address this bug, clear SCF_TASK_ATTR_SET after the first call
    to transport_complete_task_attr(), and avoid updating SCSI task
    attribute related counters for any subsequent calls.
    
    Also, when a se_cmd is deferred due to ordered tags and executed
    via target_restart_delayed_cmds(), set CMD_T_SENT before execution
    matching what target_execute_cmd() does.

    ALSA: hda: Fix too short HDMI/DP chmap reporting
    
    commit c2432466f583cb719b35a41e757da587d9ab1d00 upstream.
    
    We got a regression report about the HD-audio HDMI chmap, where some
    surround channels are reported as UNKNOWN.  The git bisection pointed
    the culprit at the commit 9b3dc8aa3fb1 ("ALSA: hda - Register chmap
    obj as priv data instead of codec").  The story behind scene is like
    this:
    
    - While moving the code out of the legacy HDA to the HDA common place,
      the patch modifies the code to obtain the chmap array indirectly in
      a byte array, and it expands it to kctl value array.
    - At the latter operation, the size of the array is wrongly passed by
      sizeof() to the pointer.
    - It can be 4 on 32bit arch, thus too short for 6+ channels.
      (And that's the reason why it didn't hit other persons; it's 8 on
      64bit arch, thus it's usually enough.)
    
    The code was further changed meanwhile, but the problem persisted.
    Let's fix it by correctly evaluating the array size.

    commit 3d4e8303f2c747c8540a0a0126d0151514f6468b upstream.
    
    Some timer compat ioctls have NULL checks of timer instance with

    Actually the condition can be met in the normal situation and it's

    ALSA: pcm: update tstamp only if audio_tstamp changed
    
    commit 20e3f985bb875fea4f86b04eba4b6cc29bfd6b71 upstream.
    
    commit 3179f6200188 ("ALSA: core: add .get_time_info") had a side effect
    of changing the behaviour of the PCM runtime tstamp.  Prior to this
    change tstamp was not updated by snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0() unless the
    hw_ptr had moved, after this change tstamp was always updated.
    
    For an application using alsa-lib, doing snd_pcm_readi() followed by
    snd_pcm_status() to estimate the age of the read samples by subtracting
    status->avail * [sample rate] from status->tstamp this change degraded
    the accuracy of the estimate on devices where the pcm hw does not
    provide a granular hw_ptr, e.g., devices using
    soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm.c and a dma-engine with residue_granularity
    DMA_RESIDUE_GRANULARITY_DESCRIPTOR.  The accuracy of the estimate
    depended on the latency between the PCM hw completing a period and the
    driver called snd_pcm_period_elapsed() to notify ALSA core, typically
    determined by interrupt handling latency.  After the change the accuracy
    of the estimate depended on the latency between the PCM hw completing a
    period and the application calling snd_pcm_status(), determined by the
    scheduling of the application process.  The maximum error of the
    estimate is one period length in both cases, but the error average and
    variance is smaller when it depends on interrupt latency.
    
    Instead of always updating tstamp, update it only if audio_tstamp
    changed.

    ext4: fix interaction between i_size, fallocate, and delalloc after a crash
    
    commit 51e3ae81ec58e95f10a98ef3dd6d7bce5d8e35a2 upstream.
    
    If there are pending writes subject to delayed allocation, then i_size
    will show size after the writes have completed, while i_disksize
    contains the value of i_size on the disk (since the writes have not
    been persisted to disk).
    
    If fallocate(2) is called with the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag, either
    with or without the FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE flag set, and the new size
    after the fallocate(2) is between i_size and i_disksize, then after a
    crash, if a journal commit has resulted in the changes made by the
    fallocate() call to be persisted after a crash, but the delayed
    allocation write has not resolved itself, i_size would not be updated,
    and this would cause the following e2fsck complaint:
    
    Inode 12, end of extent exceeds allowed value
            (logical block 33, physical block 33441, len 7)
    
    This can only take place on a sparse file, where the fallocate(2) call
    is allocating blocks in a range which is before a pending delayed
    allocation write which is extending i_size.  Since this situation is
    quite rare, and the window in which the crash must take place is
    typically < 30 seconds, in practice this condition will rarely happen.
    
    Nevertheless, it can be triggered in testing, and in particular by
    xfstests generic/456.

    commit 3f2a162fab15aee243178b5308bb5d1206fc4043 upstream.
    
    We set rtlhal->last_suspend_sec to an uninitialized stack variable,

    while working on another patch. I opened a gcc bug for this.
    
    Presumably the value of rtlhal->last_suspend_sec is not all that

    rtlwifi: rtl8192ee: Fix memory leak when loading firmware
    
    commit 519ce2f933fa14acf69d5c8cabcc18711943d629 upstream.
    
    In routine rtl92ee_set_fw_rsvdpagepkt(), the driver allocates an skb, but
    never calls rtl_cmd_send_packet(), which will free the buffer. All other
    rtlwifi drivers perform this operation correctly.
    
    This problem has been in the driver since it was included in the kernel.
    Fortunately, each firmware load only leaks 4 buffers, which likely
    explains why it has not previously been detected.

    nfsd: deal with revoked delegations appropriately
    
    commit 95da1b3a5aded124dd1bda1e3cdb876184813140 upstream.
    
    If a delegation has been revoked by the server, operations using that
    delegation should error out with NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED in the >4.1
    case, and NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID otherwise.
    
    The server needs NFSv4.1 clients to explicitly free revoked delegations.
    If the server returns NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, the client will do that;
    otherwise it may just forget about the delegation and be unable to
    recover when it later sees SEQ4_STATUS_RECALLABLE_STATE_REVOKED set on a
    SEQUENCE reply.  That can cause the Linux 4.1 client to loop in its
    stage manager.

    NFS: Avoid RCU usage in tracepoints
    
    commit 3944369db701f075092357b511fd9f5755771585 upstream.
    
    There isn't an obvious way to acquire and release the RCU lock during a
    tracepoint, so we can't use the rpc_peeraddr2str() function here.
    Instead, rely on the client's cl_hostname, which should have similar
    enough information without needing an rcu_dereference().

    nfs: Fix ugly referral attributes
    
    commit c05cefcc72416a37eba5a2b35f0704ed758a9145 upstream.
    
    Before traversing a referral and performing a mount, the mounted-on
    directory looks strange:
    
    dr-xr-xr-x. 2 4294967294 4294967294 0 Dec 31  1969 dir.0
    
    nfs4_get_referral is wiping out any cached attributes with what was
    returned via GETATTR(fs_locations), but the bit mask for that
    operation does not request any file attributes.
    
    Retrieve owner and timestamp information so that the memcpy in
    nfs4_get_referral fills in more attributes.
    
    Changes since v1:
    - Don't request attributes that the client unconditionally replaces
    - Request only MOUNTED_ON_FILEID or FILEID attribute, not both
    - encode_fs_locations() doesn't use the third bitmask word

    isofs: fix timestamps beyond 2027
    
    commit 34be4dbf87fc3e474a842305394534216d428f5d upstream.
    
    isofs uses a 'char' variable to load the number of years since
    1900 for an inode timestamp. On architectures that use a signed
    char type by default, this results in an invalid date for
    anything beyond 2027.
    
    This changes the function argument to a 'u8' array, which
    is defined the same way on all architectures, and unambiguously
    lets us use years until 2155.
    
    This should be backported to all kernels that might still be
    in use by that date.

    bcache: check ca->alloc_thread initialized before wake up it
    
    commit 91af8300d9c1d7c6b6a2fd754109e08d4798b8d8 upstream.
    
    In bcache code, sysfs entries are created before all resources get
    allocated, e.g. allocation thread of a cache set.
    
    There is posibility for NULL pointer deference if a resource is accessed
    but which is not initialized yet. Indeed Jorg Bornschein catches one on
    cache set allocation thread and gets a kernel oops.
    
    The reason for this bug is, when bch_bucket_alloc() is called during
    cache set registration and attaching, ca->alloc_thread is not properly
    allocated and initialized yet, call wake_up_process() on ca->alloc_thread
    triggers NULL pointer deference failure. A simple and fast fix is, before
    waking up ca->alloc_thread, checking whether it is allocated, and only
    wake up ca->alloc_thread when it is not NULL.

    This can be hit by fuzzers.  As this is merely bad input and not a

    nilfs2: fix race condition that causes file system corruption
    
    commit 31ccb1f7ba3cfe29631587d451cf5bb8ab593550 upstream.
    
    There is a race condition between nilfs_dirty_inode() and
    nilfs_set_file_dirty().
    
    When a file is opened, nilfs_dirty_inode() is called to update the
    access timestamp in the inode.  It calls __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() in a
    separate transaction.  __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() caches the ifile
    buffer_head in the i_bh field of the inode info structure and marks it
    as dirty.
    
    After some data was written to the file in another transaction, the
    function nilfs_set_file_dirty() is called, which adds the inode to the
    ns_dirty_files list.
    
    Then the segment construction calls nilfs_segctor_collect_dirty_files(),
    which goes through the ns_dirty_files list and checks the i_bh field.
    If there is a cached buffer_head in i_bh it is not marked as dirty
    again.
    
    Since nilfs_dirty_inode() and nilfs_set_file_dirty() use separate
    transactions, it is possible that a segment construction that writes out
    the ifile occurs in-between the two.  If this happens the inode is not
    on the ns_dirty_files list, but its ifile block is still marked as dirty
    and written out.
    
    In the next segment construction, the data for the file is written out
    and nilfs_bmap_propagate() updates the b-tree.  Eventually the bmap root
    is written into the i_bh block, which is not dirty, because it was
    written out in another segment construction.
    
    As a result the bmap update can be lost, which leads to file system
    corruption.  Either the virtual block address points to an unallocated
    DAT block, or the DAT entry will be reused for something different.
    
    The error can remain undetected for a long time.  A typical error
    message would be one of the "bad btree" errors or a warning that a DAT
    entry could not be found.
    
    This bug can be reproduced reliably by a simple benchmark that creates
    and overwrites millions of 4k files.

    autofs: don't fail mount for transient error
    
    commit ecc0c469f27765ed1e2b967be0aa17cee1a60b76 upstream.
    
    Currently if the autofs kernel module gets an error when writing to the
    pipe which links to the daemon, then it marks the whole moutpoint as
    catatonic, and it will stop working.
    
    It is possible that the error is transient.  This can happen if the
    daemon is slow and more than 16 requests queue up.  If a subsequent
    process tries to queue a request, and is then signalled, the write to
    the pipe will return -ERESTARTSYS and autofs will take that as total
    failure.
    
    So change the code to assess -ERESTARTSYS and -ENOMEM as transient
    failures which only abort the current request, not the whole mountpoint.
    
    It isn't a crash or a data corruption, but having autofs mountpoints
    suddenly stop working is rather inconvenient.
    
    Ian said:
    
    : And given the problems with a half dozen (or so) user space applications
    : consuming large amounts of CPU under heavy mount and umount activity this
    : could happen more easily than we expect.

    rt2x00usb: mark device removed when get ENOENT usb error
    
    commit bfa62a52cad93686bb8d8171ea5288813248a7c6 upstream.
    
    ENOENT usb error mean "specified interface or endpoint does not exist or
    is not enabled". Mark device not present when we encounter this error
    similar like we do with ENODEV error.
    
    Otherwise we can have infinite loop in rt2x00usb_work_rxdone(), because
    we remove and put again RX entries to the queue infinitely.
    
    We can have similar situation when submit urb will fail all the time
    with other error, so we need consider to limit number of entries
    processed by rxdone work. But for now, since the patch fixes
    reproducible soft lockup issue on single processor systems
    and taken ENOENT error meaning, let apply this fix.
    
    Patch adds additional ENOENT check not only in rx kick routine, but
    also on other places where we check for ENODEV error.

    MIPS: Fix an n32 core file generation regset support regression
    
    commit 547da673173de51f73887377eb275304775064ad upstream.
    
    Fix a commit 7aeb753b5353 ("MIPS: Implement task_user_regset_view.")
    regression, then activated by commit 6a9c001b7ec3 ("MIPS: Switch ELF
    core dumper to use regsets.)", that caused n32 processes to dump o32
    core files by failing to set the EF_MIPS_ABI2 flag in the ELF core file
    header's `e_flags' member:
    
    $ file tls-core
    tls-core: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, N32 MIPS64 rel2 version 1 (SYSV), [...]
    $ ./tls-core
    Aborted (core dumped)
    $ file core
    core: ELF 32-bit MSB core file MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style
    $
    
    Previously the flag was set as the result of a:
    
    statement placed in arch/mips/kernel/binfmt_elfn32.c, however in the
    regset case, i.e. when CORE_DUMP_USE_REGSET is set, ELF_CORE_EFLAGS is
    no longer used by `fill_note_info' in fs/binfmt_elf.c, and instead the
    `->e_flags' member of the regset view chosen is.  We have the views
    defined in arch/mips/kernel/ptrace.c, however only an o32 and an n64
    one, and the latter is used for n32 as well.  Consequently an o32 core
    file is incorrectly dumped from n32 processes (the ELF32 vs ELF64 class
    is chosen elsewhere, and the 32-bit one is correctly selected for n32).
    
    Correct the issue then by defining an n32 regset view and using it as
    appropriate.  Issue discovered in GDB testing.

    MIPS: Fix odd fp register warnings with MIPS64r2
    
    commit c7fd89a6407ea3a44a2a2fa12d290162c42499c4 upstream.
    
    Building 32-bit MIPS64r2 kernels produces warnings like the following
    on certain toolchains (such as GNU assembler 2.24.90, but not GNU
    assembler 2.28.51) since commit 22b8ba765a72 ("MIPS: Fix MIPS64 FP
    save/restore on 32-bit kernels"), due to the exposure of fpu_save_16odd
    from fpu_save_double and fpu_restore_16odd from fpu_restore_double:
    
    arch/mips/kernel/r4k_fpu.S:47: Warning: float register should be even, was 1
    ...
    arch/mips/kernel/r4k_fpu.S:59: Warning: float register should be even, was 1
    ...
    
    This appears to be because .set mips64r2 does not change the FPU ABI to
    64-bit when -march=mips64r2 (or e.g. -march=xlp) is provided on the
    command line on that toolchain, from the default FPU ABI of 32-bit due
    to the -mabi=32. This makes access to the odd FPU registers invalid.
    
    Fix by explicitly changing the FPU ABI with .set fp=64 directives in
    fpu_save_16odd and fpu_restore_16odd, and moving the undefine of fp up
    in asmmacro.h so fp doesn't turn into $30.

    dm: fix race between dm_get_from_kobject() and __dm_destroy()
    
    commit b9a41d21dceadf8104812626ef85dc56ee8a60ed upstream.
    
    The following BUG_ON was hit when testing repeat creation and removal of
    DM devices:
    
        kernel BUG at drivers/md/dm.c:2919!

         [<ffffffff817b606e>] system_call_fastpath+0x12/0x71
    
    The bug can be easily triggered, if an extra delay (e.g. 10ms) is added
    between the test of DMF_FREEING & DMF_DELETING and dm_get() in
    dm_get_from_kobject().
    
    To fix it, we need to ensure the test of DMF_FREEING & DMF_DELETING and
    dm_get() are done in an atomic way, so _minor_lock is used.
    
    The other callers of dm_get() have also been checked to be OK: some
    callers invoke dm_get() under _minor_lock, some callers invoke it under
    _hash_lock, and dm_start_request() invoke it after increasing
    md->open_count.

    dm: allocate struct mapped_device with kvzalloc
    
    commit 856eb0916d181da6d043cc33e03f54d5c5bbe54a upstream.
    
    The structure srcu_struct can be very big, its size is proportional to the
    value CONFIG_NR_CPUS. The Fedora kernel has CONFIG_NR_CPUS 8192, the field
    io_barrier in the struct mapped_device has 84kB in the debugging kernel
    and 50kB in the non-debugging kernel. The large size may result in failure
    of the function kzalloc_node.
    
    In order to avoid the allocation failure, we use the function
    kvzalloc_node, this function falls back to vmalloc if a large contiguous
    chunk of memory is not available. This patch also moves the field
    io_barrier to the last position of struct mapped_device - the reason is
    that on many processor architectures, short memory offsets result in
    smaller code than long memory offsets - on x86-64 it reduces code size by
    320 bytes.
    
    Note to stable kernel maintainers - the kernels 4.11 and older don't have
    the function kvzalloc_node, you can use the function vzalloc_node instead.

    dm bufio: fix integer overflow when limiting maximum cache size
    
    commit 74d4108d9e681dbbe4a2940ed8fdff1f6868184c upstream.
    
    The default max_cache_size_bytes for dm-bufio is meant to be the lesser
    of 25% of the size of the vmalloc area and 2% of the size of lowmem.
    However, on 32-bit systems the intermediate result in the expression
    
        (VMALLOC_END - VMALLOC_START) * DM_BUFIO_VMALLOC_PERCENT / 100
    
    overflows, causing the wrong result to be computed.  For example, on a
    32-bit system where the vmalloc area is 520093696 bytes, the result is
    1174405 rather than the expected 130023424, which makes the maximum
    cache size much too small (far less than 2% of lowmem).  This causes
    severe performance problems for dm-verity users on affected systems.
    
    Fix this by using mult_frac() to correctly multiply by a percentage.  Do
    this for all places in dm-bufio that multiply by a percentage.  Also
    replace (VMALLOC_END - VMALLOC_START) with VMALLOC_TOTAL, which contrary
    to the comment is now defined in include/linux/vmalloc.h.

    ARM: 8721/1: mm: dump: check hardware RO bit for LPAE
    
    commit 3b0c0c922ff4be275a8beb87ce5657d16f355b54 upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_ARM_LPAE is set, the PMD dump relies on the software
    read-only bit to determine whether a page is writable. This
    concealed a bug which left the kernel text section writable
    (AP2=0) while marked read-only in the software bit.
    
    In a kernel with the AP2 bug, the dump looks like this:
    
        ---[ Kernel Mapping ]---
        0xc0000000-0xc0200000           2M RW NX SHD
        0xc0200000-0xc0600000           4M ro x  SHD
        0xc0600000-0xc0800000           2M ro NX SHD
        0xc0800000-0xc4800000          64M RW NX SHD
    
    The fix is to check that the software and hardware bits are both
    set before displaying "ro". The dump then shows the true perms:
    
        ---[ Kernel Mapping ]---
        0xc0000000-0xc0200000           2M RW NX SHD
        0xc0200000-0xc0600000           4M RW x  SHD
        0xc0600000-0xc0800000           2M RW NX SHD
        0xc0800000-0xc4800000          64M RW NX SHD

    ARM: 8722/1: mm: make STRICT_KERNEL_RWX effective for LPAE
    
    commit 400eeffaffc7232c0ae1134fe04e14ae4fb48d8c upstream.
    
    Currently, for ARM kernels with CONFIG_ARM_LPAE and
    CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX enabled, the 2MiB pages mapping the
    kernel code and rodata are writable. They are marked read-only in
    a software bit (L_PMD_SECT_RDONLY) but the hardware read-only bit
    is not set (PMD_SECT_AP2).
    
    For user mappings, the logic that propagates the software bit
    to the hardware bit is in set_pmd_at(); but for the kernel,
    section_update() writes the PMDs directly, skipping this logic.
    
    The fix is to set PMD_SECT_AP2 for read-only sections in
    section_update(), at the same time as L_PMD_SECT_RDONLY.

    arm64: Implement arch-specific pte_access_permitted()
    
    commit 6218f96c58dbf44a06aeaf767aab1f54fc397838 upstream.
    
    The generic pte_access_permitted() implementation only checks for
    pte_present() (together with the write permission where applicable).
    However, for both kernel ptes and PROT_NONE mappings pte_present() also
    returns true on arm64 even though such mappings are not user accessible.
    Additionally, arm64 now supports execute-only user permission
    (PROT_EXEC) which is implemented by clearing the PTE_USER bit.
    
    With this patch the arm64 implementation of pte_access_permitted()
    checks for the PTE_VALID and PTE_USER bits together with writable access
    if applicable.

    x86/entry/64: Add missing irqflags tracing to native_load_gs_index()
    
    commit ca37e57bbe0cf1455ea3e84eb89ed04a132d59e1 upstream.
    
    Running this code with IRQs enabled (where dummy_lock is a spinlock):
    
    static void check_load_gs_index(void)
    {
            /* This will fail. */
            load_gs_index(0xffff);
    
            spin_lock(&dummy_lock);
            spin_unlock(&dummy_lock);
    }
    
    Will generate a lockdep warning.  The issue is that the actual write
    to %gs would cause an exception with IRQs disabled, and the exception
    handler would, as an inadvertent side effect, update irqflag tracing
    to reflect the IRQs-off status.  native_load_gs_index() would then
    turn IRQs back on and return with irqflag tracing still thinking that
    IRQs were off.  The dummy lock-and-unlock causes lockdep to notice the
    error and warn.
    
    Fix it by adding the missing tracing.
    
    Apparently nothing did this in a context where it mattered.  I haven't
    tried to find a code path that would actually exhibit the warning if
    appropriately nasty user code were running.
    
    I suspect that the security impact of this bug is very, very low --
    production systems don't run with lockdep enabled, and the warning is
    mostly harmless anyway.
    
    Found during a quick audit of the entry code to try to track down an
    unrelated bug that Ingo found in some still-in-development code.

    x86/decoder: Add new TEST instruction pattern
    
    commit 12a78d43de767eaf8fb272facb7a7b6f2dc6a9df upstream.
    
    The kbuild test robot reported this build warning:
    
      Warning: arch/x86/tools/test_get_len found difference at <jump_table>:ffffffff8103dd2c
    
      Warning: ffffffff8103dd82: f6 09 d8 testb $0xd8,(%rcx)
      Warning: objdump says 3 bytes, but insn_get_length() says 2
      Warning: decoded and checked 1569014 instructions with 1 warnings
    
    This sequence seems to be a new instruction not in the opcode map in the Intel SDM.
    
    The instruction sequence is "F6 09 d8", means Group3(F6), MOD(00)REG(001)RM(001), and 0xd8.
    Intel SDM vol2 A.4 Table A-6 said the table index in the group is "Encoding of Bits 5,4,3 of
    the ModR/M Byte (bits 2,1,0 in parenthesis)"
    
    In that table, opcodes listed by the index REG bits as:
    
      000         001       010 011  100        101        110         111
     TEST Ib/Iz,(undefined),NOT,NEG,MUL AL/rAX,IMUL AL/rAX,DIV AL/rAX,IDIV AL/rAX
    
    So, it seems TEST Ib is assigned to 001.

    commit 1d9ddde12e3c9bab7f3d3484eb9446315e3571ca upstream.
    
    On a non-preemptible kernel, if KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE is called with the
    largest permitted inputs (16384 bits), the kernel spends 10+ seconds
    doing modular exponentiation in mpi_powm() without rescheduling.  If all
    threads do it, it locks up the system.  Moreover, it can cause
    rcu_sched-stall warnings.
    
    Notwithstanding the insanity of doing this calculation in kernel mode
    rather than in userspace, fix it by calling cond_resched() as each bit
    from the exponent is processed.  It's still noninterruptible, but at
    least it's preemptible now.
    
    Do the cond_resched() once per bit rather than once per MPI limb because
    each limb might still easily take 100+ milliseconds on slow CPUs.

    sched: Make resched_cpu() unconditional
    
    commit 7c2102e56a3f7d85b5d8f33efbd7aecc1f36fdd8 upstream.
    
    The current implementation of synchronize_sched_expedited() incorrectly
    assumes that resched_cpu() is unconditional, which it is not.  This means
    that synchronize_sched_expedited() can hang when resched_cpu()'s trylock
    fails as follows (analysis by Neeraj Upadhyay):
    
    o       CPU1 is waiting for expedited wait to complete:
    
            sync_rcu_exp_select_cpus
                 rdp->exp_dynticks_snap & 0x1   // returns 1 for CPU5
                 IPI sent to CPU5
    
            synchronize_sched_expedited_wait
                     ret = swait_event_timeout(rsp->expedited_wq,
                                               sync_rcu_preempt_exp_done(rnp_root),
                                               jiffies_stall);
    
            expmask = 0x20, CPU 5 in idle path (in cpuidle_enter())
    
    o       CPU5 handles IPI and fails to acquire rq lock.
    
            Handles IPI
                 sync_sched_exp_handler
                     resched_cpu
                         returns while failing to try lock acquire rq->lock
                     need_resched is not set
    
    o       CPU5 calls  rcu_idle_enter() and as need_resched is not set, goes to
            idle (schedule() is not called).
    
    o       CPU 1 reports RCU stall.
    
    Given that resched_cpu() is now used only by RCU, this commit fixes the
    assumption by making resched_cpu() unconditional.

    ipv6: only call ip6_route_dev_notify() once for NETDEV_UNREGISTER
    
    commit 76da0704507bbc51875013f6557877ab308cfd0a upstream.
    
    In commit 242d3a49a2a1 ("ipv6: reorder ip6_route_dev_notifier after ipv6_dev_notf")
    I assumed NETDEV_REGISTER and NETDEV_UNREGISTER are paired,
    unfortunately, as reported by jeffy, netdev_wait_allrefs()
    could rebroadcast NETDEV_UNREGISTER event until all refs are
    gone.
    
    We have to add an additional check to avoid this corner case.
    For netdev_wait_allrefs() dev->reg_state is NETREG_UNREGISTERED,
    for dev_change_net_namespace(), dev->reg_state is
    NETREG_REGISTERED. So check for dev->reg_state != NETREG_UNREGISTERED.

    x86/mm: fix use-after-free of vma during userfaultfd fault
    
    commit cb0631fd3cf9e989cd48293fe631cbc402aec9a9 upstream.
    
    Syzkaller with KASAN has reported a use-after-free of vma->vm_flags in
    __do_page_fault() with the following reproducer:
    
      mmap(&(0x7f0000000000/0xfff000)=nil, 0xfff000, 0x3, 0x32, 0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0)
      mmap(&(0x7f0000011000/0x3000)=nil, 0x3000, 0x1, 0x32, 0xffffffffffffffff, 0x0)
      r0 = userfaultfd(0x0)
      ioctl$UFFDIO_API(r0, 0xc018aa3f, &(0x7f0000002000-0x18)={0xaa, 0x0, 0x0})
      ioctl$UFFDIO_REGISTER(r0, 0xc020aa00, &(0x7f0000019000)={{&(0x7f0000012000/0x2000)=nil, 0x2000}, 0x1, 0x0})
      r1 = gettid()
      syz_open_dev$evdev(&(0x7f0000013000-0x12)="2f6465762f696e7075742f6576656e742300", 0x0, 0x0)
      tkill(r1, 0x7)
    
    The vma should be pinned by mmap_sem, but handle_userfault() might (in a
    return to userspace scenario) release it and then acquire again, so when
    we return to __do_page_fault() (with other result than VM_FAULT_RETRY),
    the vma might be gone.
    
    Specifically, per Andrea the scenario is
     "A return to userland to repeat the page fault later with a
      VM_FAULT_NOPAGE retval (potentially after handling any pending signal
      during the return to userland). The return to userland is identified
      whenever FAULT_FLAG_USER|FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE are both set in
      vmf->flags"
    
    However, since commit a3c4fb7c9c2e ("x86/mm: Fix fault error path using
    unsafe vma pointer") there is a vma_pkey() read of vma->vm_flags after
    that point, which can thus become use-after-free.  Fix this by moving
    the read before calling handle_mm_fault().

    ACPI / EC: Fix regression related to triggering source of EC event handling
    
    commit 53c5eaabaea9a1b7a96f95ccc486d2ad721d95bb upstream.
    
    Originally the Samsung quirks removed by commit 4c237371 can be covered
    by commit e923e8e7 and ec_freeze_events=Y mode. But commit 9c40f956
    changed ec_freeze_events=Y back to N, making this problem re-surface.
    
    Actually, if commit e923e8e7 is robust enough, we can freely change
    ec_freeze_events mode, so this patch fixes the issue by improving
    commit e923e8e7.

    s390/disassembler: increase show_code buffer size
    
    commit b192571d1ae375e0bbe0aa3ccfa1a3c3704454b9 upstream.
    
    Current buffer size of 64 is too small. objdump shows that there are
    instructions which would require up to 75 bytes buffer (with current
    formating). 128 bytes "ought to be enough for anybody".
    
    Also replaces 8 spaces with a single tab to reduce the memory footprint.
    
    Fixes the following KASAN finding:

    s390/disassembler: add missing end marker for e7 table
    
    commit 5c50538752af7968f53924b22dede8ed4ce4cb3b upstream.
    
    The e7 opcode table does not have an end marker. Hence when trying to
    find an unknown e7 instruction the code will access memory behind the
    table until it finds something that matches the opcode, or the kernel
    crashes, whatever comes first.
    
    This affects not only the in-kernel disassembler but also uprobes and
    kprobes which refuse to set a probe on unknown instructions, and
    therefore search the opcode tables to figure out if instructions are
    known or not.

    s390/runtime instrumention: fix possible memory corruption
    
    commit d6e646ad7cfa7034d280459b2b2546288f247144 upstream.
    
    For PREEMPT enabled kernels the runtime instrumentation (RI) code
    contains a possible use-after-free bug. If a task that makes use of RI
    exits, it will execute do_exit() while still enabled for preemption.
    
    That function will call exit_thread_runtime_instr() via
    exit_thread(). If exit_thread_runtime_instr() gets preempted after the
    RI control block of the task has been freed but before the pointer to
    it is set to NULL, then save_ri_cb(), called from switch_to(), will
    write to already freed memory.
    
    Avoid this and simply disable preemption while freeing the control
    block and setting the pointer to NULL.

    There are several bugs with control register handling with respect to
    transactional execution:
    
    - on task switch update_per_regs() is only called if the next task has
      an mm (is not a kernel thread). This however is incorrect. This
      breaks e.g. for user mode helper handling, where the kernel creates
      a kernel thread and then execve's a user space program. Control
      register contents related to transactional execution won't be
      updated on execve. If the previous task ran with transactional
      execution disabled then the new task will also run with
      transactional execution disabled, which is incorrect. Therefore call
      update_per_regs() unconditionally within switch_to().
    
    - on startup the transactional execution facility is not enabled for
      the idle thread. This is not really a bug, but an inconsistency to
      other facilities. Therefore enable the facility if it is available.
    
    - on fork the new thread's per_flags field is not cleared. This means
      that a child process inherits the PER_FLAG_NO_TE flag. This flag can
      be set with a ptrace request to disable transactional execution for
      the current process. It should not be inherited by new child
      processes in order to be consistent with the handling of all other
      PER related debugging options. Therefore clear the per_flags field in
      copy_thread_tls().
