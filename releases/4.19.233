    net: dcb: disable softirqs in dcbnl_flush_dev()
    
    commit 10b6bb62ae1a49ee818fc479cf57b8900176773e upstream.
    
    Ido Schimmel points out that since commit 52cff74eef5d ("dcbnl : Disable
    software interrupts before taking dcb_lock"), the DCB API can be called
    by drivers from softirq context.
    
    One such in-tree example is the chelsio cxgb4 driver:
    dcb_rpl
    -> cxgb4_dcb_handle_fw_update
       -> dcb_ieee_setapp
    
    If the firmware for this driver happened to send an event which resulted
    in a call to dcb_ieee_setapp() at the exact same time as another
    DCB-enabled interface was unregistering on the same CPU, the softirq
    would deadlock, because the interrupted process was already holding the
    dcb_lock in dcbnl_flush_dev().
    
    Fix this unlikely event by using spin_lock_bh() in dcbnl_flush_dev() as
    in the rest of the dcbnl code.

    btrfs: add missing run of delayed items after unlink during log replay
    
    commit 4751dc99627e4d1465c5bfa8cb7ab31ed418eff5 upstream.
    
    During log replay, whenever we need to check if a name (dentry) exists in
    a directory we do searches on the subvolume tree for inode references or
    or directory entries (BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY keys, and BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY
    keys as well, before kernel 5.17). However when during log replay we
    unlink a name, through btrfs_unlink_inode(), we may not delete inode
    references and dir index keys from a subvolume tree and instead just add
    the deletions to the delayed inode's delayed items, which will only be
    run when we commit the transaction used for log replay. This means that
    after an unlink operation during log replay, if we attempt to search for
    the same name during log replay, we will not see that the name was already
    deleted, since the deletion is recorded only on the delayed items.
    
    We run delayed items after every unlink operation during log replay,
    except at unlink_old_inode_refs() and at add_inode_ref(). This was due
    to an overlook, as delayed items should be run after evert unlink, for
    the reasons stated above.
    
    So fix those two cases.

    tracing/histogram: Fix sorting on old "cpu" value
    
    commit 1d1898f65616c4601208963c3376c1d828cbf2c7 upstream.
    
    When trying to add a histogram against an event with the "cpu" field, it
    was impossible due to "cpu" being a keyword to key off of the running CPU.
    So to fix this, it was changed to "common_cpu" to match the other generic
    fields (like "common_pid"). But since some scripts used "cpu" for keying
    off of the CPU (for events that did not have "cpu" as a field, which is
    most of them), a backward compatibility trick was added such that if "cpu"
    was used as a key, and the event did not have "cpu" as a field name, then
    it would fallback and switch over to "common_cpu".
    
    This fix has a couple of subtle bugs. One was that when switching over to
    "common_cpu", it did not change the field name, it just set a flag. But
    the code still found a "cpu" field. The "cpu" field is used for filtering
    and is returned when the event does not have a "cpu" field.
    
    This was found by:
    
      # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
      # echo hist:key=cpu,pid:sort=cpu > events/sched/sched_wakeup/trigger
      # cat events/sched/sched_wakeup/hist
    
    Which showed the histogram unsorted:
    
    { cpu:         19, pid:       1175 } hitcount:          1
    { cpu:          6, pid:        239 } hitcount:          2
    { cpu:         23, pid:       1186 } hitcount:         14
    { cpu:         12, pid:        249 } hitcount:          2
    { cpu:          3, pid:        994 } hitcount:          5
    
    Instead of hard coding the "cpu" checks, take advantage of the fact that
    trace_event_field_field() returns a special field for "cpu" and "CPU" if
    the event does not have "cpu" as a field. This special field has the
    "filter_type" of "FILTER_CPU". Check that to test if the returned field is
    of the CPU type instead of doing the string compare.
    
    Also, fix the sorting bug by testing for the hist_field flag of
    HIST_FIELD_FL_CPU when setting up the sort routine. Otherwise it will use
    the special CPU field to know what compare routine to use, and since that
    special field does not have a size, it returns tracing_map_cmp_none.

    memfd: fix F_SEAL_WRITE after shmem huge page allocated
    
    commit f2b277c4d1c63a85127e8aa2588e9cc3bd21cb99 upstream.
    
    Wangyong reports: after enabling tmpfs filesystem to support transparent
    hugepage with the following command:
    
      echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled
    
    the docker program tries to add F_SEAL_WRITE through the following
    command, but it fails unexpectedly with errno EBUSY:
    
      fcntl(5, F_ADD_SEALS, F_SEAL_WRITE) = -1.
    
    That is because memfd_tag_pins() and memfd_wait_for_pins() were never
    updated for shmem huge pages: checking page_mapcount() against
    page_count() is hopeless on THP subpages - they need to check
    total_mapcount() against page_count() on THP heads only.
    
    Make memfd_tag_pins() (compared > 1) as strict as memfd_wait_for_pins()
    (compared != 1): either can be justified, but given the non-atomic
    total_mapcount() calculation, it is better now to be strict.  Bear in
    mind that total_mapcount() itself scans all of the THP subpages, when
    choosing to take an XA_CHECK_SCHED latency break.
    
    Also fix the unlikely xa_is_value() case in memfd_wait_for_pins(): if a
    page has been swapped out since memfd_tag_pins(), then its refcount must
    have fallen, and so it can safely be untagged.

    Input: elan_i2c - fix regulator enable count imbalance after suspend/resume
    
    commit 04b7762e37c95d9b965d16bb0e18dbd1fa2e2861 upstream.
    
    Before these changes elan_suspend() would only disable the regulator
    when device_may_wakeup() returns false; whereas elan_resume() would
    unconditionally enable it, leading to an enable count imbalance when
    device_may_wakeup() returns true.
    
    This triggers the "WARN_ON(regulator->enable_count)" in regulator_put()
    when the elan_i2c driver gets unbound, this happens e.g. with the
    hot-plugable dock with Elan I2C touchpad for the Asus TF103C 2-in-1.
    
    Fix this by making the regulator_enable() call also be conditional
    on device_may_wakeup() returning false.

    elan_disable_power() is called conditionally on suspend, where as

    As the possible failure of the ioremap(), the par_io could be NULL.

    But, I also notice that all the caller like mpc85xx_qe_par_io_init() in
    `arch/powerpc/platforms/85xx/common.c` don't check the return value of
    the par_io_init().
    Actually, par_io_init() needs to check to handle the potential error.
    I will submit another patch to fix that.
    Anyway, par_io_init() itsely should be fixed.

    can: gs_usb: change active_channels's type from atomic_t to u8
    
    commit 035b0fcf02707d3c9c2890dc1484b11aa5335eb1 upstream.
    
    The driver uses an atomic_t variable: gs_usb:active_channels to keep
    track of the number of opened channels in order to only allocate
    memory for the URBs when this count changes from zero to one.
    
    However, the driver does not decrement the counter when an error
    occurs in gs_can_open(). This issue is fixed by changing the type from
    atomic_t to u8 and by simplifying the logic accordingly.
    
    It is safe to use an u8 here because the network stack big kernel lock
    (a.k.a. rtnl_mutex) is being hold. For details, please refer to [1].

    efivars: Respect "block" flag in efivar_entry_set_safe()
    
    commit 258dd902022cb10c83671176688074879517fd21 upstream.
    
    When the "block" flag is false, the old code would sometimes still call
    check_var_size(), which wrongly tells ->query_variable_store() that it can
    block.
    
    As far as I can tell, this can't really materialize as a bug at the moment,
    because ->query_variable_store only does something on X86 with generic EFI,
    and in that configuration we always take the efivar_entry_set_nonblocking()
    path.

    net: arcnet: com20020: Fix null-ptr-deref in com20020pci_probe()
    
    commit bd6f1fd5d33dfe5d1b4f2502d3694a7cc13f166d upstream.
    
    During driver initialization, the pointer of card info, i.e. the
    variable 'ci' is required. However, the definition of
    'com20020pci_id_table' reveals that this field is empty for some
    devices, which will cause null pointer dereference when initializing
    these devices.
    
    The following log reveals it:

    mac80211: fix forwarded mesh frames AC & queue selection
    
    commit 859ae7018316daa4adbc496012dcbbb458d7e510 upstream.
    
    There are two problems with the current code that have been highlighted
    with the AQL feature that is now enbaled by default.
    
    First problem is in ieee80211_rx_h_mesh_fwding(),
    ieee80211_select_queue_80211() is used on received packets to choose
    the sending AC queue of the forwarding packet although this function
    should only be called on TX packet (it uses ieee80211_tx_info).
    This ends with forwarded mesh packets been sent on unrelated random AC
    queue. To fix that, AC queue can directly be infered from skb->priority
    which has been extracted from QOS info (see ieee80211_parse_qos()).
    
    Second problem is the value of queue_mapping set on forwarded mesh
    frames via skb_set_queue_mapping() is not the AC of the packet but a
    hardware queue index. This may or may not work depending on AC to HW
    queue mapping which is driver specific.
    
    Both of these issues lead to improper AC selection while forwarding
    mesh packets but more importantly due to improper airtime accounting
    (which is done on a per STA, per AC basis) caused traffic stall with
    the introduction of AQL.

    xen/netfront: destroy queues before real_num_tx_queues is zeroed
    
    commit dcf4ff7a48e7598e6b10126cc02177abb8ae4f3f upstream.
    
    xennet_destroy_queues() relies on info->netdev->real_num_tx_queues to
    delete queues. Since d7dac083414eb5bb99a6d2ed53dc2c1b405224e5
    ("net-sysfs: update the queue counts in the unregistration path"),
    unregister_netdev() indirectly sets real_num_tx_queues to 0. Those two
    facts together means, that xennet_destroy_queues() called from
    xennet_remove() cannot do its job, because it's called after
    unregister_netdev(). This results in kfree-ing queues that are still
    linked in napi, which ultimately crashes:

    PCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power fault
    
    commit 23584c1ed3e15a6f4bfab8dc5a88d94ab929ee12 upstream.
    
    The Power Fault Detected bit in the Slot Status register differs from
    all other hotplug events in that it is sticky:  It can only be cleared
    after turning off slot power.  Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:
    
      If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,
      it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].
      The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to
      the hot-plug slot.
    
    The stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops which
    were fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe ("PCI pciehp: fix power fault
    interrupt storm problem") and 99f0169c17f3 ("PCI: pciehp: enable
    software notification on empty slots").
    
    Unfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertently
    reintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 ("PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interrupt
    race"):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit until
    pciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQ
    thread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirq
    handler is stuck in an infinite loop.  Fix by setting the
    power_fault_detected flag already in the hardirq handler.

    net/smc: fix unexpected SMC_CLC_DECL_ERR_REGRMB error cause by server
    
    commit 4940a1fdf31c39f0806ac831cde333134862030b upstream.
    
    The problem of SMC_CLC_DECL_ERR_REGRMB on the server is very clear.
    Based on the fact that whether a new SMC connection can be accepted or
    not depends on not only the limit of conn nums, but also the available
    entries of rtoken. Since the rtoken release is trigger by peer, while
    the conn nums is decrease by local, tons of thing can happen in this
    time difference.
    
    This only thing that needs to be mentioned is that now all connection
    creations are completely protected by smc_server_lgr_pending lock, it's
    enough to check only the available entries in rtokens_used_mask.

    net/smc: fix unexpected SMC_CLC_DECL_ERR_REGRMB error generated by client
    
    commit 0537f0a2151375dcf90c1bbfda6a0aaf57164e89 upstream.
    
    The main reason for this unexpected SMC_CLC_DECL_ERR_REGRMB in client
    dues to following execution sequence:
    
    Server Conn A:           Server Conn B:                 Client Conn B:
    
    smc_lgr_unregister_conn
                            smc_lgr_register_conn
                            smc_clc_send_accept     ->
                                                            smc_rtoken_add
    smcr_buf_unuse
                    ->              Client Conn A:
                                    smc_rtoken_delete
    
    smc_lgr_unregister_conn() makes current link available to assigned to new
    incoming connection, while smcr_buf_unuse() has not executed yet, which
    means that smc_rtoken_add may fail because of insufficient rtoken_entry,
    reversing their execution order will avoid this problem.

    net: dcb: flush lingering app table entries for unregistered devices
    
    commit 91b0383fef06f20b847fa9e4f0e3054ead0b1a1b upstream.
    
    If I'm not mistaken (and I don't think I am), the way in which the
    dcbnl_ops work is that drivers call dcb_ieee_setapp() and this populates
    the application table with dynamically allocated struct dcb_app_type
    entries that are kept in the module-global dcb_app_list.
    
    However, nobody keeps exact track of these entries, and although
    dcb_ieee_delapp() is supposed to remove them, nobody does so when the
    interface goes away (example: driver unbinds from device). So the
    dcb_app_list will contain lingering entries with an ifindex that no
    longer matches any device in dcb_app_lookup().
    
    Reclaim the lost memory by listening for the NETDEV_UNREGISTER event and
    flushing the app table entries of interfaces that are now gone.
    
    In fact something like this used to be done as part of the initial
    commit (blamed below), but it was done in dcbnl_exit() -> dcb_flushapp(),
    essentially at module_exit time. That became dead code after commit
    7a6b6f515f77 ("DCB: fix kconfig option") which essentially merged
    "tristate config DCB" and "bool config DCBNL" into a single "bool config
    DCB", so net/dcb/dcbnl.c could not be built as a module anymore.
    
    Commit 36b9ad8084bd ("net/dcb: make dcbnl.c explicitly non-modular")
    recognized this and deleted dcbnl_exit() and dcb_flushapp() altogether,
    leaving us with the version we have today.
    
    Since flushing application table entries can and should be done as soon
    as the netdevice disappears, fundamentally the commit that is to blame
    is the one that introduced the design of this API.

    batman-adv: Don't expect inter-netns unique iflink indices
    
    commit 6c1f41afc1dbe59d9d3c8bb0d80b749c119aa334 upstream.
    
    The ifindex doesn't have to be unique for multiple network namespaces on
    the same machine.
    
      $ ip netns add test1
      $ ip -net test1 link add dummy1 type dummy
      $ ip netns add test2
      $ ip -net test2 link add dummy2 type dummy
    
      $ ip -net test1 link show dev dummy1
      6: dummy1: <BROADCAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
          link/ether 96:81:55:1e:dd:85 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
      $ ip -net test2 link show dev dummy2
      6: dummy2: <BROADCAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
          link/ether 5a:3c:af:35:07:c3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    
    But the batman-adv code to walk through the various layers of virtual
    interfaces uses this assumption because dev_get_iflink handles it
    internally and doesn't return the actual netns of the iflink. And
    dev_get_iflink only documents the situation where ifindex == iflink for
    physical devices.
    
    But only checking for dev->netdev_ops->ndo_get_iflink is also not an option
    because ipoib_get_iflink implements it even when it sometimes returns an
    iflink != ifindex and sometimes iflink == ifindex. The caller must
    therefore make sure itself to check both netns and iflink + ifindex for
    equality. Only when they are equal, a "physical" interface was detected
    which should stop the traversal. On the other hand, vxcan_get_iflink can
    also return 0 in case there was currently no valid peer. In this case, it
    is still necessary to stop.

    There is no need to call dev_get_iflink multiple times for the same
    net_device in batadv_get_real_netdevice. And since some of the
    ndo_get_iflink callbacks are dynamic (for example via RCUs like in
    vxcan_get_iflink), it could easily happen that the returned values are not
    stable. The pre-checks before __dev_get_by_index are then of course bogus.

    xfrm: enforce validity of offload input flags
    
    commit 7c76ecd9c99b6e9a771d813ab1aa7fa428b3ade1 upstream.
    
    struct xfrm_user_offload has flags variable that received user input,
    but kernel didn't check if valid bits were provided. It caused a situation
    where not sanitized input was forwarded directly to the drivers.
    
    For example, XFRM_OFFLOAD_IPV6 define that was exposed, was used by
    strongswan, but not implemented in the kernel at all.
    
    As a solution, check and sanitize input flags to forward
    XFRM_OFFLOAD_INBOUND to the drivers.

    xfrm: fix MTU regression
    
    commit 6596a0229541270fb8d38d989f91b78838e5e9da upstream.
    
    Commit 749439bfac6e1a2932c582e2699f91d329658196 ("ipv6: fix udpv6
    sendmsg crash caused by too small MTU") breaks PMTU for xfrm.
    
    A Packet Too Big ICMPv6 message received in response to an ESP
    packet will prevent all further communication through the tunnel
    if the reported MTU minus the ESP overhead is smaller than 1280.
    
    E.g. in a case of a tunnel-mode ESP with sha256/aes the overhead
    is 92 bytes. Receiving a PTB with MTU of 1371 or less will result
    in all further packets in the tunnel dropped. A ping through the
    tunnel fails with "ping: sendmsg: Invalid argument".
    
    Apparently the MTU on the xfrm route is smaller than 1280 and
    fails the check inside ip6_setup_cork() added by 749439bf.
    
    We found this by debugging USGv6/ipv6ready failures. Failing
    tests are: "Phase-2 Interoperability Test Scenario IPsec" /
    5.3.11 and 5.4.11 (Tunnel Mode: Fragmentation).
    
    Commit b515d2637276a3810d6595e10ab02c13bfd0b63a ("xfrm:
    xfrm_state_mtu should return at least 1280 for ipv6") attempted
    to fix this but caused another regression in TCP MSS calculations
    and had to be reverted.
    
    The patch below fixes the situation by dropping the MTU
    check and instead checking for the underflows described in the
    749439bf commit message.

    While the $val/$val2 values passed in from userspace are always >= 0
    integers, the limits of the control can be signed integers and the $min
    can be non-zero and less than zero. To correctly validate $val/$val2
    against platform_max, add the $min offset to val first.

    PCM buffers might be allocated dynamically when the buffer
    preallocation failed or a larger buffer is requested, and it's not
    guaranteed that substream->dma_buffer points to the actually used
    buffer.  The driver needs to refer to substream->runtime->dma_addr
    instead for the buffer address.

    When cifs_get_root() fails during cifs_smb3_do_mount() we call
    deactivate_locked_super() which eventually will call delayed_free() which
    will free the context.
    In this situation we should not proceed to enter the out: section in
    cifs_smb3_do_mount() and free the same resources a second time.

    Input: clear BTN_RIGHT/MIDDLE on buttonpads
    
    [ Upstream commit 37ef4c19b4c659926ce65a7ac709ceaefb211c40 ]
    
    Buttonpads are expected to map the INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property bit
    and the BTN_LEFT key bit.
    
    As explained in the specification, where a device has a button type
    value of 0 (click-pad) or 1 (pressure-pad) there should not be
    discrete buttons:
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/touchpad-windows-precision-touchpad-collection#device-capabilities-feature-report
    
    However, some drivers map the BTN_RIGHT and/or BTN_MIDDLE key bits even
    though the device is a buttonpad and therefore does not have those
    buttons.
    
    This behavior has forced userspace applications like libinput to
    implement different workarounds and quirks to detect buttonpads and
    offer to the user the right set of features and configuration options.
    For more information:
    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/merge_requests/726
    
    In order to avoid this issue clear the BTN_RIGHT and BTN_MIDDLE key
    bits when the input device is register if the INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD
    property bit is set.
    
    Notice that this change will not affect udev because it does not check
    for buttons. See systemd/src/udev/udev-builtin-input_id.c.

    ASoC: rt5682: do not block workqueue if card is unbound
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c33de0673ced9c7c37b3bbd9bfe0fda72340b2a ]
    
    The current rt5682_jack_detect_handler() assumes the component
    and card will always show up and implements an infinite usleep
    loop waiting for them to show up.
    
    This does not hold true if a codec interrupt (or other
    event) occurs when the card is unbound. The codec driver's
    remove  or shutdown functions cannot cancel the workqueue due
    to the wait loop. As a result, code can either end up blocking
    the workqueue, or hit a kernel oops when the card is freed.
    
    Fix the issue by rescheduling the jack detect handler in
    case the card is not ready. In case card never shows up,
    the shutdown/remove/suspend calls can now cancel the detect
    task.

    i2c: bcm2835: Avoid clock stretching timeouts
    
    [ Upstream commit 9495b9b31abe525ebd93da58de2c88b9f66d3a0e ]
    
    The CLKT register contains at poweron 0x40, which at our typical 100kHz
    bus rate means .64ms. But there is no specified limit to how long devices
    should be able to stretch the clocks, so just disable the timeout. We
    still have a timeout wrapping the entire transfer.

    mac80211_hwsim: initialize ieee80211_tx_info at hw_scan_work
    
    [ Upstream commit cacfddf82baf1470e5741edeecb187260868f195 ]
    
    In mac80211_hwsim, the probe_req frame is created and sent while
    scanning. It is sent with ieee80211_tx_info which is not initialized.
    Uninitialized ieee80211_tx_info can cause problems when using
    mac80211_hwsim with wmediumd. wmediumd checks the tx_rates field of
    ieee80211_tx_info and doesn't relay probe_req frame to other clients
    even if it is a broadcasting message.
    
    Call ieee80211_tx_prepare_skb() to initialize ieee80211_tx_info for
    the probe_req that is created by hw_scan_work in mac80211_hwsim.
