    Btrfs: fix fs corruption on transaction abort if device supports discard
    
    commit 678886bdc6378c1cbd5072da2c5a3035000214e3 upstream.
    
    When we abort a transaction we iterate over all the ranges marked as dirty
    in fs_info->freed_extents[0] and fs_info->freed_extents[1], clear them
    from those trees, add them back (unpin) to the free space caches and, if
    the fs was mounted with "-o discard", perform a discard on those regions.
    Also, after adding the regions to the free space caches, a fitrim ioctl call
    can see those ranges in a block group's free space cache and perform a discard
    on the ranges, so the same issue can happen without "-o discard" as well.
    
    This causes corruption, affecting one or multiple btree nodes (in the worst
    case leaving the fs unmountable) because some of those ranges (the ones in
    the fs_info->pinned_extents tree) correspond to btree nodes/leafs that are
    referred by the last committed super block - breaking the rule that anything
    that was committed by a transaction is untouched until the next transaction
    commits successfully.
    
    I ran into this while running in a loop (for several hours) the fstest that
    I recently submitted:
    
      [PATCH] fstests: add btrfs test to stress chunk allocation/removal and fstrim
    
    The corruption always happened when a transaction aborted and then fsck complained
    like this:
    
       _check_btrfs_filesystem: filesystem on /dev/sdc is inconsistent
       *** fsck.btrfs output ***
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       Check tree block failed, want=94945280, have=0
       read block failed check_tree_block
       Couldn't open file system
    
    In this case 94945280 corresponded to the root of a tree.
    Using frace what I observed was the following sequence of steps happened:
    
       1) transaction N started, fs_info->pinned_extents pointed to
          fs_info->freed_extents[0];
    
       2) node/eb 94945280 is created;
    
       3) eb is persisted to disk;
    
       4) transaction N commit starts, fs_info->pinned_extents now points to
          fs_info->freed_extents[1], and transaction N completes;
    
       5) transaction N + 1 starts;
    
       6) eb is COWed, and btrfs_free_tree_block() called for this eb;
    
       7) eb range (94945280 to 94945280 + 16Kb) is added to
          fs_info->pinned_extents (fs_info->freed_extents[1]);
    
       8) Something goes wrong in transaction N + 1, like hitting ENOSPC
          for example, and the transaction is aborted, turning the fs into
          readonly mode. The stack trace I got for example:

          [112065.264997] BTRFS info (device sdc): forced readonly
    
       9) The clear kthread sees that the BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR bit is set in
          fs_info->fs_state and calls btrfs_cleanup_transaction(), which in
          turn calls btrfs_destroy_pinned_extent();
    
       10) Then btrfs_destroy_pinned_extent() iterates over all the ranges
           marked as dirty in fs_info->freed_extents[], and for each one
           it calls discard, if the fs was mounted with "-o discard", and
           adds the range to the free space cache of the respective block
           group;
    
       11) btrfs_trim_block_group(), invoked from the fitrim ioctl code path,
           sees the free space entries and performs a discard;
    
       12) After an umount and mount (or fsck), our eb's location on disk was full
           of zeroes, and it should have been untouched, because it was marked as
           dirty in the fs_info->pinned_extents tree, and therefore used by the
           trees that the last committed superblock points to.
    
    Fix this by not performing a discard and not adding the ranges to the free space
    caches - it's useless from this point since the fs is now in readonly mode and
    we won't write free space caches to disk anymore (otherwise we would leak space)
    nor any new superblock. By not adding the ranges to the free space caches, it
    prevents other code paths from allocating that space and write to it as well,
    therefore being safer and simpler.
    
    This isn't a new problem, as it's been present since 2011 (git commit
    acce952b0263825da32cf10489413dec78053347).

    Btrfs: make sure logged extents complete in the current transaction V3
    
    commit 50d9aa99bd35c77200e0e3dd7a72274f8304701f upstream.
    
    Liu Bo pointed out that my previous fix would lose the generation update in the
    scenario I described.  It is actually much worse than that, we could lose the
    entire extent if we lose power right after the transaction commits.  Consider
    the following
    
    write extent 0-4k
    log extent in log tree
    commit transaction
            < power fail happens here
    ordered extent completes
    
    We would lose the 0-4k extent because it hasn't updated the actual fs tree, and
    the transaction commit will reset the log so it isn't replayed.  If we lose
    power before the transaction commit we are save, otherwise we are not.
    
    Fix this by keeping track of all extents we logged in this transaction.  Then
    when we go to commit the transaction make sure we wait for all of those ordered
    extents to complete before proceeding.  This will make sure that if we lose
    power after the transaction commit we still have our data.  This also fixes the
    problem of the improperly updated extent generation.  Thanks,

    Btrfs: do not move em to modified list when unpinning
    
    commit a28046956c71985046474283fa3bcd256915fb72 upstream.
    
    We use the modified list to keep track of which extents have been modified so we
    know which ones are candidates for logging at fsync() time.  Newly modified
    extents are added to the list at modification time, around the same time the
    ordered extent is created.  We do this so that we don't have to wait for ordered
    extents to complete before we know what we need to log.  The problem is when
    something like this happens
    
    log extent 0-4k on inode 1
    copy csum for 0-4k from ordered extent into log
    sync log
    commit transaction
    log some other extent on inode 1
    ordered extent for 0-4k completes and adds itself onto modified list again
    log changed extents
    see ordered extent for 0-4k has already been logged
            at this point we assume the csum has been copied
    sync log
    crash
    
    On replay we will see the extent 0-4k in the log, drop the original 0-4k extent
    which is the same one that we are replaying which also drops the csum, and then
    we won't find the csum in the log for that bytenr.  This of course causes us to
    have errors about not having csums for certain ranges of our inode.  So remove
    the modified list manipulation in unpin_extent_cache, any modified extents
    should have been added well before now, and we don't want them re-logged.  This
    fixes my test that I could reliably reproduce this problem with.  Thanks,

    Btrfs: make sure we wait on logged extents when fsycning two subvols
    
    commit 9dba8cf128ef98257ca719722280c9634e7e9dc7 upstream.
    
    If we have two fsync()'s race on different subvols one will do all of its work
    to get into the log_tree, wait on it's outstanding IO, and then allow the
    log_tree to finish it's commit.  The problem is we were just free'ing that
    subvols logged extents instead of waiting on them, so whoever lost the race
    wouldn't really have their data on disk.  Fix this by waiting properly instead
    of freeing the logged extents.  Thanks,

    eCryptfs: Force RO mount when encrypted view is enabled
    
    commit 332b122d39c9cbff8b799007a825d94b2e7c12f2 upstream.
    
    The ecryptfs_encrypted_view mount option greatly changes the
    functionality of an eCryptfs mount. Instead of encrypting and decrypting
    lower files, it provides a unified view of the encrypted files in the
    lower filesystem. The presence of the ecryptfs_encrypted_view mount
    option is intended to force a read-only mount and modifying files is not
    supported when the feature is in use. See the following commit for more
    information:
    
      e77a56d [PATCH] eCryptfs: Encrypted passthrough
    
    This patch forces the mount to be read-only when the
    ecryptfs_encrypted_view mount option is specified by setting the
    MS_RDONLY flag on the superblock. Additionally, this patch removes some
    broken logic in ecryptfs_open() that attempted to prevent modifications
    of files when the encrypted view feature was in use. The check in
    ecryptfs_open() was not sufficient to prevent file modifications using
    system calls that do not operate on a file descriptor.

    mm/CMA: fix boot regression due to physical address of high_memory
    
    commit 6b101e2a3ce4d2a0312087598bd1ab4a1db2ac40 upstream.
    
    high_memory isn't direct mapped memory so retrieving it's physical address
    isn't appropriate.  But, it would be useful to check physical address of
    highmem boundary so it's justfiable to get physical address from it.  In
    x86, there is a validation check if CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL and it triggers
    following boot failure reported by Ingo.
    
      ...
      BUG: Int 6: CR2 00f06f53
      ...
      Call Trace:
        dump_stack+0x41/0x52

    To fix boot regression, this patch implements workaround to avoid
    validation check in x86 when retrieving physical address of high_memory.
    __pa_nodebug() used by this patch is implemented only in x86 so there is
    no choice but to use dirty #ifdef.

    If some error happens in NCP_IOC_SETROOT ioctl, the appropriate error
    return value is then (in most cases) just overwritten before we return.
    This can result in reporting success to userspace although error happened.

    crypto: af_alg - fix backlog handling
    
    commit 7e77bdebff5cb1e9876c561f69710b9ab8fa1f7e upstream.
    
    If a request is backlogged, it's complete() handler will get called
    twice: once with -EINPROGRESS, and once with the final error code.
    
    af_alg's complete handler, unlike other users, does not handle the
    -EINPROGRESS but instead always completes the completion that recvmsg()
    is waiting on.  This can lead to a return to user space while the
    request is still pending in the driver.  If userspace closes the sockets
    before the requests are handled by the driver, this will lead to
    use-after-frees (and potential crashes) in the kernel due to the tfm
    having been freed.
    
    The crashes can be easily reproduced (for example) by reducing the max
    queue length in cryptod.c and running the following (from
    http://www.chronox.de/libkcapi.html) on AES-NI capable hardware:
    
     $ while true; do kcapi -x 1 -e -c '__ecb-aes-aesni' \
        -k 00000000000000000000000000000000 \
        -p 00000000000000000000000000000000 >/dev/null & done

    audit: restore AUDIT_LOGINUID unset ABI
    
    commit 041d7b98ffe59c59fdd639931dea7d74f9aa9a59 upstream.
    
    A regression was caused by commit 780a7654cee8:
             audit: Make testing for a valid loginuid explicit.
    (which in turn attempted to fix a regression caused by e1760bd)
    
    When audit_krule_to_data() fills in the rules to get a listing, there was a
    missing clause to convert back from AUDIT_LOGINUID_SET to AUDIT_LOGINUID.
    
    This broke userspace by not returning the same information that was sent and
    expected.
    
    The rule:
            auditctl -a exit,never -F auid=-1
    gives:
            auditctl -l
                    LIST_RULES: exit,never f24=0 syscall=all
    when it should give:
                    LIST_RULES: exit,never auid=-1 (0xffffffff) syscall=all
    
    Tag it so that it is reported the same way it was set.  Create a new
    private flags audit_krule field (pflags) to store it that won't interact with
    the public one from the API.

    audit: don't attempt to lookup PIDs when changing PID filtering audit rules
    
    commit 3640dcfa4fd00cd91d88bb86250bdb496f7070c0 upstream.
    
    Commit f1dc4867 ("audit: anchor all pid references in the initial pid
    namespace") introduced a find_vpid() call when adding/removing audit
    rules with PID/PPID filters; unfortunately this is problematic as
    find_vpid() only works if there is a task with the associated PID
    alive on the system.  The following commands demonstrate a simple
    reproducer.
    
            # auditctl -D
            # auditctl -l
            # autrace /bin/true
            # auditctl -l
    
    This patch resolves the problem by simply using the PID provided by
    the user without any additional validation, e.g. no calls to check to
    see if the task/PID exists.

    audit: use supplied gfp_mask from audit_buffer in kauditd_send_multicast_skb
    
    commit 54dc77d974a50147d6639dac6f59cb2c29207161 upstream.

    audit_log_end(), which can come from any context (aka even a sleeping context)
    GFP_KERNEL can't be used.  Since the audit_buffer knows what context it should

    userns: Allow setting gid_maps without privilege when setgroups is disabled
    
    commit 66d2f338ee4c449396b6f99f5e75cd18eb6df272 upstream.
    
    Now that setgroups can be disabled and not reenabled, setting gid_map
    without privielge can now be enabled when setgroups is disabled.
    
    This restores most of the functionality that was lost when unprivileged
    setting of gid_map was removed.  Applications that use this functionality
    will need to check to see if they use setgroups or init_groups, and if they
    don't they can be fixed by simply disabling setgroups before writing to
    gid_map.

    userns: Add a knob to disable setgroups on a per user namespace basis
    
    commit 9cc46516ddf497ea16e8d7cb986ae03a0f6b92f8 upstream.
    
    - Expose the knob to user space through a proc file /proc/<pid>/setgroups
    
      A value of "deny" means the setgroups system call is disabled in the
      current processes user namespace and can not be enabled in the
      future in this user namespace.
    
      A value of "allow" means the segtoups system call is enabled.
    
    - Descendant user namespaces inherit the value of setgroups from
      their parents.
    
    - A proc file is used (instead of a sysctl) as sysctls currently do
      not allow checking the permissions at open time.
    
    - Writing to the proc file is restricted to before the gid_map
      for the user namespace is set.
    
      This ensures that disabling setgroups at a user namespace
      level will never remove the ability to call setgroups
      from a process that already has that ability.
    
      A process may opt in to the setgroups disable for itself by
      creating, entering and configuring a user namespace or by calling
      setns on an existing user namespace with setgroups disabled.
      Processes without privileges already can not call setgroups so this
      is a noop.  Prodcess with privilege become processes without
      privilege when entering a user namespace and as with any other path
      to dropping privilege they would not have the ability to call
      setgroups.  So this remains within the bounds of what is possible
      without a knob to disable setgroups permanently in a user namespace.

    userns: Only allow the creator of the userns unprivileged mappings
    
    commit f95d7918bd1e724675de4940039f2865e5eec5fe upstream.
    
    If you did not create the user namespace and are allowed
    to write to uid_map or gid_map you should already have the necessary
    privilege in the parent user namespace to establish any mapping
    you want so this will not affect userspace in practice.
    
    Limiting unprivileged uid mapping establishment to the creator of the
    user namespace makes it easier to verify all credentials obtained with
    the uid mapping can be obtained without the uid mapping without
    privilege.
    
    Limiting unprivileged gid mapping establishment (which is temporarily
    absent) to the creator of the user namespace also ensures that the
    combination of uid and gid can already be obtained without privilege.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2014-8989.

    commit 80dd00a23784b384ccea049bfb3f259d3f973b9d upstream.
    
    setresuid allows the euid to be set to any of uid, euid, suid, and
    fsuid.  Therefor it is safe to allow an unprivileged user to map
    their euid and use CAP_SETUID privileged with exactly that uid,
    as no new credentials can be obtained.
    
    I can not find a combination of existing system calls that allows setting
    uid, euid, suid, and fsuid from the fsuid making the previous use
    of fsuid for allowing unprivileged mappings a bug.

    commit be7c6dba2332cef0677fbabb606e279ae76652c3 upstream.
    
    As any gid mapping will allow and must allow for backwards
    compatibility dropping groups don't allow any gid mappings to be
    established without CAP_SETGID in the parent user namespace.
    
    For a small class of applications this change breaks userspace
    and removes useful functionality.  This small class of applications
    includes tools/testing/selftests/mount/unprivilged-remount-test.c
    
    Most of the removed functionality will be added back with the addition
    of a one way knob to disable setgroups.  Once setgroups is disabled
    setting the gid_map becomes as safe as setting the uid_map.
    
    For more common applications that set the uid_map and the gid_map
    with privilege this change will have no affect.
    
    This is part of a fix for CVE-2014-8989.

    userns: Don't allow setgroups until a gid mapping has been setablished
    
    commit 273d2c67c3e179adb1e74f403d1e9a06e3f841b5 upstream.
    
    setgroups is unique in not needing a valid mapping before it can be called,
    in the case of setgroups(0, NULL) which drops all supplemental groups.
    
    The design of the user namespace assumes that CAP_SETGID can not actually
    be used until a gid mapping is established.  Therefore add a helper function
    to see if the user namespace gid mapping has been established and call
    that function in the setgroups permission check.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2014-8989, being able to drop groups
    without privilege using user namespaces.

    userns: Document what the invariant required for safe unprivileged mappings.
    
    commit 0542f17bf2c1f2430d368f44c8fcf2f82ec9e53e upstream.
    
    The rule is simple.  Don't allow anything that wouldn't be allowed
    without unprivileged mappings.
    
    It was previously overlooked that establishing gid mappings would
    allow dropping groups and potentially gaining permission to files and
    directories that had lesser permissions for a specific group than for
    all other users.
    
    This is the rule needed to fix CVE-2014-8989 and prevent any other
    security issues with new_idmap_permitted.
    
    The reason for this rule is that the unix permission model is old and
    there are programs out there somewhere that take advantage of every
    little corner of it.  So allowing a uid or gid mapping to be
    established without privielge that would allow anything that would not
    be allowed without that mapping will result in expectations from some
    code somewhere being violated.  Violated expectations about the
    behavior of the OS is a long way to say a security issue.

    permission checking has diverged.  Add a common function so that

    This corrects the current oversight in the current permission checks

    Forced unmount affects not just the mount namespace but the underlying
    superblock as well.  Restrict forced unmount to the global root user
    for now.  Otherwise it becomes possible a user in a less privileged
    mount namespace to force the shutdown of a superblock of a filesystem
    in a more privileged mount namespace, allowing a DOS attack on root.

    mnt: Update unprivileged remount test
    
    commit 4a44a19b470a886997d6647a77bb3e38dcbfa8c5 upstream.
    
    - MNT_NODEV should be irrelevant except when reading back mount flags,
      no longer specify MNT_NODEV on remount.
    
    - Test MNT_NODEV on devpts where it is meaningful even for unprivileged mounts.
    
    - Add a test to verify that remount of a prexisting mount with the same flags
      is allowed and does not change those flags.
    
    - Cleanup up the definitions of MS_REC, MS_RELATIME, MS_STRICTATIME that are used
      when the code is built in an environment without them.
    
    - Correct the test error messages when tests fail.  There were not 5 tests
      that tested MS_RELATIME.

    mnt: Implicitly add MNT_NODEV on remount when it was implicitly added by mount
    
    commit 3e1866410f11356a9fd869beb3e95983dc79c067 upstream.
    
    Now that remount is properly enforcing the rule that you can't remove
    nodev at least sandstorm.io is breaking when performing a remount.
    
    It turns out that there is an easy intuitive solution implicitly
    add nodev on remount when nodev was implicitly added on mount.

    mnt: Fix a memory stomp in umount
    
    commit c297abfdf15b4480704d6b566ca5ca9438b12456 upstream.
    
    While reviewing the code of umount_tree I realized that when we append
    to a preexisting unmounted list we do not change pprev of the former
    first item in the list.
    
    Which means later in namespace_unlock hlist_del_init(&mnt->mnt_hash) on
    the former first item of the list will stomp unmounted.first leaving
    it set to some random mount point which we are likely to free soon.
    
    This isn't likely to hit, but if it does I don't know how anyone could
    track it down.
    
    [ This happened because we don't have all the same operations for
      hlist's as we do for normal doubly-linked lists. In particular,
      list_splice() is easy on our standard doubly-linked lists, while
      hlist_splice() doesn't exist and needs both start/end entries of the
      hlist.  And commit 38129a13e6e7 incorrectly open-coded that missing
      hlist_splice().
    
      We should think about making these kinds of "mindless" conversions
      easier to get right by adding the missing hlist helpers   - Linus ]

    mac80211: free management frame keys when removing station
    
    commit 28a9bc68124c319b2b3dc861e80828a8865fd1ba upstream.
    
    When writing the code to allow per-station GTKs, I neglected to
    take into account the management frame keys (index 4 and 5) when
    freeing the station and only added code to free the first four
    data frame keys.
    
    Fix this by iterating the array of keys over the right length.

    As multicast-frames can't be fragmented, "dot11MulticastReceivedFrameCount"
    stopped being incremented after the use-after-free fix. Furthermore, the

    KEYS: Fix stale key registration at error path
    
    commit b26bdde5bb27f3f900e25a95e33a0c476c8c2c48 upstream.
    
    When loading encrypted-keys module, if the last check of
    aes_get_sizes() in init_encrypted() fails, the driver just returns an
    error without unregistering its key type.  This results in the stale
    entry in the list.  In addition to memory leaks, this leads to a kernel
    crash when registering a new key type later.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by swapping the calls of aes_get_sizes()
    and register_key_type(), and releasing resources properly at the error
    paths.

    I'm such a moron! The simple solution of saving the BSP patch
    for use on resume was too simple (and wrong!), hint:
    sizeof(struct microcode_intel).
    
    What needs to be done instead is to fish out the microcode patch
    we have stashed previously and apply that on the BSP in case the
    late loader hasn't been utilized.
    
    So do that instead.

    Normally, we do reapply microcode on resume. However, in the cases where
    that microcode comes from the early loader and the late loader hasn't
    been utilized yet, there's no easy way for us to go and apply the patch
    applied during boot by the early loader.
    
    Thus, reuse the patch stashed by the early loader for the BSP.

    commit a18a0f6850d4b286a5ebf02cd5b22fe496b86349 upstream.
    
    Paravirtual guests are not expected to load microcode into processors
    and therefore it is not necessary to initialize microcode loading
    logic.
    
    In fact, under certain circumstances initializing this logic may cause
    the guest to crash. Specifically, 32-bit kernels use __pa_nodebug()
    macro which does not work in Xen (the code path that leads to this macro
    happens during resume when we call mc_bp_resume()->load_ucode_ap()
    ->check_loader_disabled_ap())

    commit 3fb2f4237bb452eb4e98f6a5dbd5a445b4fed9d0 upstream.
    
    It turns out that there's a lurking ABI issue.  GCC, when
    compiling this in a 32-bit program:
    
    struct user_desc desc = {
            .entry_number    = idx,
            .base_addr       = base,
            .limit           = 0xfffff,
            .seg_32bit       = 1,
            .contents        = 0, /* Data, grow-up */
            .read_exec_only  = 0,
            .limit_in_pages  = 1,
            .seg_not_present = 0,
            .useable         = 0,
    };
    
    will leave .lm uninitialized.  This means that anything in the
    kernel that reads user_desc.lm for 32-bit tasks is unreliable.
    
    Revert the .lm check in set_thread_area().  The value never did
    anything in the first place.

    ARM: mvebu: remove conflicting muxing on Armada 370 DB
    
    commit b4607572ef86b288a856b9df410ea593c5371dec upstream.
    
    Back when audio was enabled, the muxing of some MPP pins was causing
    problems. However, since commit fea038ed55ae ("ARM: mvebu: Add proper
    pin muxing on the Armada 370 DB board"), those problematic MPP pins
    have been assigned a proper muxing for the Ethernet interfaces. This
    proper muxing is now conflicting with the hog pins muxing that had
    been added as part of 249f3822509b ("ARM: mvebu: add audio support to
    Armada 370 DB").
    
    Therefore, this commit simply removes the hog pins muxing, which
    solves a warning a boot time due to the conflicting muxing
    requirements.

     - On Armada 375, 38x and XP, the cache policy must be set to
       write-allocate, the pages must be mapped with the shareable
       attribute, and the SMP bit must be set
    
    Currently, on Armada XP, when CONFIG_SMP is enabled, those conditions
    are met. However, when Armada XP is used in a !CONFIG_SMP kernel, none
    of these conditions are met. With Armada 370, the situation is worse:
    since the processor is single core, regardless of whether CONFIG_SMP
    or !CONFIG_SMP is used, the cache policy will be set to write-back by
    the kernel and not write-allocate.
    
    Since solving this problem turns out to be quite complicated, and we
    don't want to let users with a mainline kernel known to have
    infrequent but existing data corruptions, this commit proposes to
    simply disable hardware I/O coherency in situations where it is known
    not to work.
    
    And basically, the is_smp() function of the kernel tells us whether it
    is OK to enable hardware I/O coherency or not, so this commit slightly
    refactors the coherency_type() function to return
    COHERENCY_FABRIC_TYPE_NONE when is_smp() is false, or the appropriate
    type of the coherency fabric in the other case.
    
    Thanks to this, the I/O coherency fabric will no longer be used at all
    in !CONFIG_SMP configurations. It will continue to be used in
    CONFIG_SMP configurations on Armada XP, Armada 375 and Armada 38x
    (which are multiple cores processors), but will no longer be used on
    Armada 370 (which is a single core processor).
    
    In the process, it simplifies the implementation of the
    coherency_type() function, and adds a missing call to of_node_put().

    ARM: mvebu: make the coherency_ll.S functions work with no coherency fabric
    
    commit 30cdef97107370a7f63ab5d80fd2de30540750c8 upstream.
    
    The ll_add_cpu_to_smp_group(), ll_enable_coherency() and
    ll_disable_coherency() are used on Armada XP to control the coherency
    fabric. However, they make the assumption that the coherency fabric is
    always available, which is currently a correct assumption but will no
    longer be true with a followup commit that disables the usage of the
    coherency fabric when the conditions are not met to use it.
    
    Therefore, this commit modifies those functions so that they check the
    return value of ll_get_coherency_base(), and if the return value is 0,
    they simply return without configuring anything in the coherency
    fabric.
    
    The ll_get_coherency_base() function is also modified to properly
    return 0 when the function is called with the MMU disabled. In this
    case, it normally returns the physical address of the coherency
    fabric, but we now check if the virtual address is 0, and if that's
    case, return a physical address of 0 to indicate that the coherency
    fabric is not enabled.

    commit 51c9fbb1b146f3336a93d398c439b6fbfe5ab489 upstream.
    
    Earlier implementation assumed last instruction is BPF_EXIT.
    Since this is no longer a restriction in eBPF, we remove this
    limitation.
    
    Per Alexei Starovoitov [1]:
    > classic BPF has a restriction that last insn is always BPF_RET.
    > eBPF doesn't have BPF_RET instruction and this restriction.
    > It has BPF_EXIT insn which can appear anywhere in the program
    > one or more times and it doesn't have to be last insn.

    dm thin: fix missing out-of-data-space to write mode transition if blocks are released
    
    commit 2c43fd26e46734430122b8d2ad3024bb532df3ef upstream.
    
    Discard bios and thin device deletion have the potential to release data
    blocks.  If the thin-pool is in out-of-data-space mode, and blocks were
    released, transition the thin-pool back to full write mode.
    
    The correct time to do this is just after the thin-pool metadata commit.
    It cannot be done before the commit because the space maps will not
    allow immediate reuse of the data blocks in case there's a rollback
    following power failure.

    This incorrect function pointer meant the discard was being passed down,

    dm bufio: fix memleak when using a dm_buffer's inline bio
    
    commit 445559cdcb98a141f5de415b94fd6eaccab87e6d upstream.
    
    When dm-bufio sets out to use the bio built into a struct dm_buffer to
    issue an IO, it needs to call bio_reset after it's done with the bio
    so that we can free things attached to the bio such as the integrity
    payload.  Therefore, inject our own endio callback to take care of
    the bio_reset after calling submit_io's end_io callback.
    
    Test case:
    1. modprobe scsi_debug delay=0 dif=1 dix=199 ato=1 dev_size_mb=300
    2. Set up a dm-bufio client, e.g. dm-verity, on the scsi_debug device
    3. Repeatedly read metadata and watch kmalloc-192 leak!

    started at 0x100, so the write messes with the FIFO and completely
    breaks the driver.
    
    If the version id < 240A, return early from dw_mci_ctl_rd_thld() so as
    not to hit this problem.

    commit 1a5fb99de4850cba710d91becfa2c65653048589 upstream.
    
    Some boards with TC6393XB chip require full state restore during system
    resume thanks to chip's VCC being cut off during suspend (Sharp SL-6000
    tosa is one of them). Failing to do so would result in ohci Oops on
    resume due to internal memory contentes being changed. Fail ohci suspend
    on tc6393xb is full state restore is required.
    
    Recommended workaround is to unbind tmio-ohci driver before suspend and
    rebind it after resume.

    clocksource: arch_timer: Fix code to use physical timers when requested
    
    commit 0b46b8a718c6e90910a1b1b0fe797be3c167e186 upstream.
    
    This is a bug fix for using physical arch timers when
    the arch_timer_use_virtual boolean is false.  It restores the
    arch_counter_get_cntpct() function after removal in
    
    0d651e4e "clocksource: arch_timer: use virtual counters"
    
    We need this on certain ARMv7 systems which are architected like this:
    
    * The firmware doesn't know and doesn't care about hypervisor mode and
      we don't want to add the complexity of hypervisor there.
    
    * The firmware isn't involved in SMP bringup or resume.
    
    * The ARCH timer come up with an uninitialized offset between the
      virtual and physical counters.  Each core gets a different random
      offset.
    
    * The device boots in "Secure SVC" mode.
    
    * Nothing has touched the reset value of CNTHCTL.PL1PCEN or
      CNTHCTL.PL1PCTEN (both default to 1 at reset)
    
    One example of such as system is RK3288 where it is much simpler to
    use the physical counter since there's nobody managing the offset and
    each time a core goes down and comes back up it will get reinitialized
    to some other random value.

    x86, kvm: Clear paravirt_enabled on KVM guests for espfix32's benefit
    
    commit 29fa6825463c97e5157284db80107d1bfac5d77b upstream.
    
    paravirt_enabled has the following effects:
    
     - Disables the F00F bug workaround warning.  There is no F00F bug
       workaround any more because Linux's standard IDT handling already
       works around the F00F bug, but the warning still exists.  This
       is only cosmetic, and, in any event, there is no such thing as
       KVM on a CPU with the F00F bug.
    
     - Disables 32-bit APM BIOS detection.  On a KVM paravirt system,
       there should be no APM BIOS anyway.
    
     - Disables tboot.  I think that the tboot code should check the
       CPUID hypervisor bit directly if it matters.
    
     - paravirt_enabled disables espfix32.  espfix32 should *not* be
       disabled under KVM paravirt.
    
    The last point is the purpose of this patch.  It fixes a leak of the
    high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit KVM paravirt
    guests.  Fixes CVE-2014-8134.

    x86_64, switch_to(): Load TLS descriptors before switching DS and ES
    
    commit f647d7c155f069c1a068030255c300663516420e upstream.
    
    Otherwise, if buggy user code points DS or ES into the TLS
    array, they would be corrupted after a context switch.
    
    This also significantly improves the comments and documents some
    gotchas in the code.

    x86/tls: Disallow unusual TLS segments
    
    commit 0e58af4e1d2166e9e33375a0f121e4867010d4f8 upstream.
    
    Users have no business installing custom code segments into the
    GDT, and segments that are not present but are otherwise valid
    are a historical source of interesting attacks.
    
    For completeness, block attempts to set the L bit.  (Prior to
    this patch, the L bit would have been silently dropped.)
    
    This is an ABI break.  I've checked glibc, musl, and Wine, and
    none of them look like they'll have any trouble.
    
    Note to stable maintainers: this is a hardening patch that fixes
    no known bugs.  Given the possibility of ABI issues, this
    probably shouldn't be backported quickly.

    x86/tls: Validate TLS entries to protect espfix
    
    commit 41bdc78544b8a93a9c6814b8bbbfef966272abbe upstream.
    
    Installing a 16-bit RW data segment into the GDT defeats espfix.
    AFAICT this will not affect glibc, Wine, or dosemu at all.

    isofs: Fix infinite looping over CE entries
    
    commit f54e18f1b831c92f6512d2eedb224cd63d607d3d upstream.
    
    Rock Ridge extensions define so called Continuation Entries (CE) which
    define where is further space with Rock Ridge data. Corrupted isofs
    image can contain arbitrarily long chain of these, including a one
    containing loop and thus causing kernel to end in an infinite loop when
    traversing these entries.
    
    Limit the traversal to 32 entries which should be more than enough space
    to store all the Rock Ridge data.
