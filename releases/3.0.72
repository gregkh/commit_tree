    bonding: get netdev_rx_handler_unregister out of locks
    
    [ Upstream commit fcd99434fb5c137274d2e15dd2a6a7455f0f29ff ]
    
    Now that netdev_rx_handler_unregister contains synchronize_net(), we need
    to call it outside of bond->lock, cause it might sleep. Also, remove the
    already unneded synchronize_net().

    iommu/amd: Make sure dma_ops are set for hotplug devices
    
    commit c2a2876e863356b092967ea62bebdb4dd663af80 upstream.
    
    There is a bug introduced with commit 27c2127 that causes
    devices which are hot unplugged and then hot-replugged to
    not have per-device dma_ops set. This causes these devices
    to not function correctly. Fixed with this patch.

    smsc75xx: fix jumbo frame support
    
    [ Upstream commit 4c51e53689569398d656e631c17308d9b8e84650 ]
    
    This patch enables RX of jumbo frames for LAN7500.
    
    Previously the driver would transmit jumbo frames succesfully but
    would drop received jumbo frames (incrementing the interface errors
    count).
    
    With this patch applied the device can succesfully receive jumbo
    frames up to MTU 9000 (9014 bytes on the wire including ethernet
    header).

    net: add a synchronize_net() in netdev_rx_handler_unregister()
    
    [ Upstream commit 00cfec37484761a44a3b6f4675a54caa618210ae ]
    
    commit 35d48903e97819 (bonding: fix rx_handler locking) added a race
    in bonding driver, reported by Steven Rostedt who did a very good
    diagnosis :
    
    <quoting Steven>
    
    I'm currently debugging a crash in an old 3.0-rt kernel that one of our
    customers is seeing. The bug happens with a stress test that loads and
    unloads the bonding module in a loop (I don't know all the details as
    I'm not the one that is directly interacting with the customer). But the
    bug looks to be something that may still be present and possibly present
    in mainline too. It will just be much harder to trigger it in mainline.
    
    In -rt, interrupts are threads, and can schedule in and out just like
    any other thread. Note, mainline now supports interrupt threads so this
    may be easily reproducible in mainline as well. I don't have the ability
    to tell the customer to try mainline or other kernels, so my hands are
    somewhat tied to what I can do.
    
    But according to a core dump, I tracked down that the eth irq thread
    crashed in bond_handle_frame() here:
    
            slave = bond_slave_get_rcu(skb->dev);
            bond = slave->bond; <--- BUG
    
    the slave returned was NULL and accessing slave->bond caused a NULL
    pointer dereference.
    
    Looking at the code that unregisters the handler:
    
    void netdev_rx_handler_unregister(struct net_device *dev)
    {
    
            ASSERT_RTNL();
            RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->rx_handler, NULL);
            RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->rx_handler_data, NULL);
    }
    
    Which is basically:
            dev->rx_handler = NULL;
            dev->rx_handler_data = NULL;
    
    And looking at __netif_receive_skb() we have:
    
            rx_handler = rcu_dereference(skb->dev->rx_handler);
            if (rx_handler) {
                    if (pt_prev) {
                            ret = deliver_skb(skb, pt_prev, orig_dev);
                            pt_prev = NULL;
                    }
                    switch (rx_handler(&skb)) {
    
    My question to all of you is, what stops this interrupt from happening
    while the bonding module is unloading?  What happens if the interrupt
    triggers and we have this:
    
            CPU0                    CPU1
            ----                    ----
      rx_handler = skb->dev->rx_handler
    
                            netdev_rx_handler_unregister() {
                               dev->rx_handler = NULL;
                               dev->rx_handler_data = NULL;
    
      rx_handler()
       bond_handle_frame() {
        slave = skb->dev->rx_handler;
        bond = slave->bond; <-- NULL pointer dereference!!!
    
    What protection am I missing in the bond release handler that would
    prevent the above from happening?
    
    </quoting Steven>
    
    We can fix bug this in two ways. First is adding a test in
    bond_handle_frame() and others to check if rx_handler_data is NULL.
    
    A second way is adding a synchronize_net() in
    netdev_rx_handler_unregister() to make sure that a rcu protected reader
    has the guarantee to see a non NULL rx_handler_data.
    
    The second way is better as it avoids an extra test in fast path.

    unix: fix a race condition in unix_release()
    
    [ Upstream commit ded34e0fe8fe8c2d595bfa30626654e4b87621e0 ]
    
    As reported by Jan, and others over the past few years, there is a
    race condition caused by unix_release setting the sock->sk pointer
    to NULL before properly marking the socket as dead/orphaned.  This
    can cause a problem with the LSM hook security_unix_may_send() if
    there is another socket attempting to write to this partially
    released socket in between when sock->sk is set to NULL and it is
    marked as dead/orphaned.  This patch fixes this by only setting
    sock->sk to NULL after the socket has been marked as dead; I also
    take the opportunity to make unix_release_sock() a void function
    as it only ever returned 0/success.
    
    Dave, I think this one should go on the -stable pile.
    
    Special thanks to Jan for coming up with a reproducer for this
    problem.

    sky2: Threshold for Pause Packet is set wrong
    
    [ Upstream commit 74f9f42c1c1650e74fb464f76644c9041f996851 ]
    
    The sky2 driver sets the Rx Upper Threshold for Pause Packet generation to a
    wrong value which leads to only 2kB of RAM remaining space. This can lead to
    Rx overflow errors even with activated flow-control.
    
    Fix: We should increase the value to 8192/8

    sky2: Receive Overflows not counted
    
    [ Upstream commit 9cfe8b156c21cf340b3a10ecb3022fbbc1c39185 ]
    
    The sky2 driver doesn't count the Receive Overflows because the MAC
    interrupt for this event is not set in the MAC's interrupt mask.
    The MAC's interrupt mask is set only for Transmit FIFO Underruns.
    
    Fix: The correct setting should be (GM_IS_TX_FF_UR | GM_IS_RX_FF_OR)
    Otherwise the Receive Overflow event will not generate any interrupt.
    The  Receive Overflow interrupt is handled correctly

    tracing: Prevent buffer overwrite disabled for latency tracers
    
    commit 613f04a0f51e6e68ac6fe571ab79da3c0a5eb4da upstream.
    
    The latency tracers require the buffers to be in overwrite mode,
    otherwise they get screwed up. Force the buffers to stay in overwrite
    mode when latency tracers are enabled.
    
    Added a flag_changed() method to the tracer structure to allow
    the tracers to see what flags are being changed, and also be able
    to prevent the change from happing.

    tracing: Protect tracer flags with trace_types_lock
    
    commit 69d34da2984c95b33ea21518227e1f9470f11d95 upstream.
    
    Seems that the tracer flags have never been protected from
    synchronous writes. Luckily, admins don't usually modify the
    tracing flags via two different tasks. But if scripts were to
    be used to modify them, then they could get corrupted.
    
    Move the trace_types_lock that protects against tracers changing
    to also protect the flags being set.

    commit 90ba983f6889e65a3b506b30dc606aa9d1d46cd2 upstream.
    
    A user who was using a 8TB+ file system and with a very large flexbg
    size (> 65536) could cause the atomic_t used in the struct flex_groups
    to overflow.  This was detected by PaX security patchset:

    efivars: Handle duplicate names from get_next_variable()
    
    commit e971318bbed610e28bb3fde9d548e6aaf0a6b02e upstream.

    There's not much we can do to work around and keep traversing the
    variable list once we hit this firmware bug. Our only solution is to
    terminate the loop because, as Lingzhu reports, some machines get
    stuck when they encounter duplicate names,
    
      > I had an IBM System x3100 M4 and x3850 X5 on which kernel would
      > get stuck in infinite loop creating duplicate sysfs files because,
      > for some reason, there are several duplicate boot entries in nvram
      > getting GetNextVariableName into a circle of iteration (with
      > period > 2).
    
    Also disable the workqueue, as efivar_update_sysfs_entries() uses
    GetNextVariableName() to figure out which variables have been created
    since the last iteration. That algorithm isn't going to work if
    GetNextVariableName() returns duplicates. Note that we don't disable
    EFI variable creation completely on the affected machines, it's just
    that any pstore dump-* files won't appear in sysfs until the next
    boot.

    efivars: explicitly calculate length of VariableName
    
    commit ec50bd32f1672d38ddce10fb1841cbfda89cfe9a upstream.
    
    It's not wise to assume VariableNameSize represents the length of
    VariableName, as not all firmware updates VariableNameSize in the same
    way (some don't update it at all if EFI_SUCCESS is returned). There
    are even implementations out there that update VariableNameSize with
    values that are both larger than the string returned in VariableName
    and smaller than the buffer passed to GetNextVariableName(), which
    resulted in the following bug report from Michael Schroeder,
    
      > On HP z220 system (firmware version 1.54), some EFI variables are
      > incorrectly named :
      >
      > ls -d /sys/firmware/efi/vars/*8be4d* | grep -v -- -8be returns
      > /sys/firmware/efi/vars/dbxDefault-pport8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c
      > /sys/firmware/efi/vars/KEKDefault-pport8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c
      > /sys/firmware/efi/vars/SecureBoot-pport8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c
      > /sys/firmware/efi/vars/SetupMode-Information8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c
    
    The issue here is that because we blindly use VariableNameSize without
    verifying its value, we can potentially read garbage values from the
    buffer containing VariableName if VariableNameSize is larger than the
    length of VariableName.
    
    Since VariableName is a string, we can calculate its size by searching
    for the terminating NULL character.

    loop: prevent bdev freeing while device in use
    
    commit c1681bf8a7b1b98edee8b862a42c19c4e53205fd upstream.
    
    struct block_device lifecycle is defined by its inode (see fs/block_dev.c) -
    block_device allocated first time we access /dev/loopXX and deallocated on
    bdev_destroy_inode. When we create the device "losetup /dev/loopXX afile"
    we want that block_device stay alive until we destroy the loop device
    with "losetup -d".
    
    But because we do not hold /dev/loopXX inode its counter goes 0, and
    inode/bdev can be destroyed at any moment. Usually it happens at memory
    pressure or when user drops inode cache (like in the test below). When later in
    loop_clr_fd() we want to use bdev we have use-after-free error with following
    stack:
    
    BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000280
      bd_set_size+0x10/0xa0
      loop_clr_fd+0x1f8/0x420 [loop]
      lo_ioctl+0x200/0x7e0 [loop]

      compat_sys_ioctl+0xc1/0xf20
      do_sys_open+0x16e/0x1d0
      sysenter_dispatch+0x7/0x1a
    
    To prevent use-after-free we need to grab the device in loop_set_fd()
    and put it later in loop_clr_fd().
    
    The issue is reprodusible on current Linus head and v3.3. Here is the test:
    
      dd if=/dev/zero of=loop.file bs=1M count=1
      while [ true ]; do
        losetup /dev/loop0 loop.file
        echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
        losetup -d /dev/loop0
      done
    
    [ Doing bdgrab/bput in loop_set_fd/loop_clr_fd is safe, because every
      time we call loop_set_fd() we check that loop_device->lo_state is
      Lo_unbound and set it to Lo_bound If somebody will try to set_fd again
      it will get EBUSY.  And if we try to loop_clr_fd() on unbound loop
      device we'll get ENXIO.
    
      loop_set_fd/loop_clr_fd (and any other loop ioctl) is called under
      loop_device->lo_ctl_mutex. ]

    KVM: x86: invalid opcode oops on SET_SREGS with OSXSAVE bit set (CVE-2012-4461)
    
    commit 6d1068b3a98519247d8ba4ec85cd40ac136dbdf9 upstream.
    
    On hosts without the XSAVE support unprivileged local user can trigger
    oops similar to the one below by setting X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit in guest
    cr4 register using KVM_SET_SREGS ioctl and later issuing KVM_RUN
    ioctl.

    QEMU first retrieves the supported features via KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID
    and then sets them later. So guest's X86_FEATURE_XSAVE should be masked
    out on hosts without X86_FEATURE_XSAVE, making kvm_set_cr4 with
    X86_CR4_OSXSAVE fail. Userspaces that allow specifying guest cpuid with
    X86_FEATURE_XSAVE even on hosts that do not support it, might be
    susceptible to this attack from inside the guest as well.
    
    Allow setting X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit only if host has XSAVE support.

    mm/hotplug: correctly add new zone to all other nodes' zone lists
    
    commit 08dff7b7d629807dbb1f398c68dd9cd58dd657a1 upstream.
    
    When online_pages() is called to add new memory to an empty zone, it
    rebuilds all zone lists by calling build_all_zonelists().  But there's a
    bug which prevents the new zone to be added to other nodes' zone lists.
    
    online_pages() {
            build_all_zonelists()
            .....
            node_set_state(zone_to_nid(zone), N_HIGH_MEMORY)
    }
    
    Here the node of the zone is put into N_HIGH_MEMORY state after calling
    build_all_zonelists(), but build_all_zonelists() only adds zones from
    nodes in N_HIGH_MEMORY state to the fallback zone lists.
    build_all_zonelists()
    
        ->__build_all_zonelists()
            ->build_zonelists()
                ->find_next_best_node()
                    ->for_each_node_state(n, N_HIGH_MEMORY)
    
    So memory in the new zone will never be used by other nodes, and it may
    cause strange behavor when system is under memory pressure.  So put node
    into N_HIGH_MEMORY state before calling build_all_zonelists().

    KVM: Fix buffer overflow in kvm_set_irq()
    
    commit f2ebd422f71cda9c791f76f85d2ca102ae34a1ed upstream.
    
    kvm_set_irq() has an internal buffer of three irq routing entries, allowing
    connecting a GSI to three IRQ chips or on MSI.  However setup_routing_entry()
    does not properly enforce this, allowing three irqchip routes followed by
    an MSI route to overflow the buffer.
    
    Fix by ensuring that an MSI entry is added to an empty list.

    - Return error when caller provides vectors whose num is greater than UIO_MAXIOV.
    - Linearize part of skb when userspace provides vectors grater than MAX_SKB_FRAGS.

    KVM: Ensure all vcpus are consistent with in-kernel irqchip settings
    
    commit 3e515705a1f46beb1c942bb8043c16f8ac7b1e9e upstream.
    
    If some vcpus are created before KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP, then
    irqchip_in_kernel() and vcpu->arch.apic will be inconsistent, leading
    to potential NULL pointer dereferences.
    
    Fix by:
    - ensuring that no vcpus are installed when KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP is called
    - ensuring that a vcpu has an apic if it is installed after KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP
    
    This is somewhat long winded because vcpu->arch.apic is created without
    kvm->lock held.

    NFSv4: Fix an Oops in the NFSv4 getacl code
    
    commit 331818f1c468a24e581aedcbe52af799366a9dfe upstream.
    
    Commit bf118a342f10dafe44b14451a1392c3254629a1f (NFSv4: include bitmap
    in nfsv4 get acl data) introduces the 'acl_scratch' page for the case
    where we may need to decode multi-page data. However it fails to take
    into account the fact that the variable may be NULL (for the case where
    we're not doing multi-page decode), and it also attaches it to the
    encoding xdr_stream rather than the decoding one.
    
    The immediate result is an Oops in nfs4_xdr_enc_getacl due to the
    call to page_address() with a NULL page pointer.

    NFSv4: include bitmap in nfsv4 get acl data
    
    commit bf118a342f10dafe44b14451a1392c3254629a1f upstream.
    
    The NFSv4 bitmap size is unbounded: a server can return an arbitrary
    sized bitmap in an FATTR4_WORD0_ACL request.  Replace using the
    nfs4_fattr_bitmap_maxsz as a guess to the maximum bitmask returned by a server
    with the inclusion of the bitmap (xdr length plus bitmasks) and the acl data
    xdr length to the (cached) acl page data.
    
    This is a general solution to commit e5012d1f "NFSv4.1: update
    nfs4_fattr_bitmap_maxsz" and fixes hitting a BUG_ON in xdr_shrink_bufhead
    when getting ACLs.
    
    Fix a bug in decode_getacl that returned -EINVAL on ACLs > page when getxattr
    was called with a NULL buffer, preventing ACL > PAGE_SIZE from being retrieved.

    KVM: x86: Prevent starting PIT timers in the absence of irqchip support
    
    commit 0924ab2cfa98b1ece26c033d696651fd62896c69 upstream.
    
    User space may create the PIT and forgets about setting up the irqchips.
    In that case, firing PIT IRQs will crash the host:
    
    BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000128
    IP: [<ffffffffa10f6280>] kvm_set_irq+0x30/0x170 [kvm]

    Prevent this by checking the irqchip mode before starting a timer. We
    can't deny creating the PIT if the irqchips aren't set up yet as
    current user land expects this order to work.

    commit cb101ed2c3c7c0224d16953fe77bfb9d6c2cb9df upstream.
    
    There are multiple locations in the X.25 packet layer where a skb is
    assumed to be of at least a certain size and that all its data is
    currently available at skb->data.  These assumptions are not checked,
    hence buffer overreads may occur.  Use pskb_may_pull to check these
    minimal size assumptions and ensure that data is available at skb->data
    when necessary, as well as use skb_copy_bits where needed.

    Btrfs: limit the global reserve to 512mb
    
    commit fdf30d1c1b386e1b73116cc7e0fb14e962b763b0 upstream.
    
    A user reported a problem where he was getting early ENOSPC with hundreds of
    gigs of free data space and 6 gigs of free metadata space.  This is because the
    global block reserve was taking up the entire free metadata space.  This is
    ridiculous, we have infrastructure in place to throttle if we start using too
    much of the global reserve, so instead of letting it get this huge just limit it
    to 512mb so that users can still get work done.  This allowed the user to
    complete his rsync without issues.  Thanks

    commit 1c11a172cb30492f5f6a82c6e118fdcd9946c34f upstream.
    
    Use proper macro while extracting TRB transfer length from
    Transfer event TRBs. Adding a macro EVENT_TRB_LEN (bits 0:23)
    for the same, and use it instead of TRB_LEN (bits 0:16) in
    case of event TRBs.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that
    contain the commit b10de142119a676552df3f0d2e3a9d647036c26a "USB: xhci:
    Bulk transfer support".  This patch will have issues applying to older
    kernels.

    mwifiex: cancel cmd timer and free curr_cmd in shutdown process
    
    commit 084c7189acb3f969c855536166042e27f5dd703f upstream.
    
    curr_cmd points to the command that is in processing or waiting
    for its command response from firmware. If the function shutdown
    happens to occur at this time we should cancel the cmd timer and
    put the command back to free queue.

    Commit 7708992 ("xen/blkback: Seperate the bio allocation and the bio
    submission") consolidated the pendcnt updates to just a single write,
    neglecting the fact that the error path relied on it getting set to 1
    up front (such that the decrement in __end_block_io_op() would actually
    drop the count to zero, triggering the necessary cleanup actions).
    
    Also remove a misleading and a stale (after said commit) comment.

    b43: A fix for DMA transmission sequence errors
    
    commit b251412db99ccd4495ce372fec7daee27bf06923 upstream.
    
    Intermittently, b43 will report "Out of order TX status report on DMA ring".
    When this happens, the driver must be reset before communication can resume.
    The cause of the problem is believed to be an error in the closed-source
    firmware; however, all versions of the firmware are affected.
    
    This change uses the observation that the expected status is always 2 less
    than the observed value, and supplies a fake status report to skip one
    header/data pair.
    
    Not all devices suffer from this problem, but it can occur several times
    per second under heavy load. As each occurence kills the unmodified driver,
    this patch makes if possible for the affected devices to function. The patch
    logs only the first instance of the reset operation to prevent spamming
    the logs.

    sysfs: handle failure path correctly for readdir()
    
    commit e5110f411d2ee35bf8d202ccca2e89c633060dca upstream.
    
    In case of 'if (filp->f_pos ==  0 or 1)' of sysfs_readdir(),
    the failure from filldir() isn't handled, and the reference counter
    of the sysfs_dirent object pointed by filp->private_data will be
    released without clearing filp->private_data, so use after free
    bug will be triggered later.
    
    This patch returns immeadiately under the situation for fixing the bug,
    and it is reasonable to return from readdir() when filldir() fails.

    sysfs: fix race between readdir and lseek
    
    commit 991f76f837bf22c5bb07261cfd86525a0a96650c upstream.
    
    While readdir() is running, lseek() may set filp->f_pos as zero,
    then may leave filp->private_data pointing to one sysfs_dirent
    object without holding its reference counter, so the sysfs_dirent
    object may be used after free in next readdir().
    
    This patch holds inode->i_mutex to avoid the problem since
    the lock is always held in readdir path.

    staging: comedi: s626: fix continuous acquisition
    
    commit e4317ce877a31dbb9d96375391c1c4ad2210d637 upstream.
    
    For the s626 driver, there is a bug in the handling of asynchronous
    commands on the AI subdevice when the stop source is `TRIG_NONE`.  The
    command should run continuously until cancelled, but the interrupt
    handler stops the command running after the first scan.
    
    The command set-up function `s626_ai_cmd()` contains this code:
    
            switch (cmd->stop_src) {
            case TRIG_COUNT:
                    /*  data arrives as one packet */
                    devpriv->ai_sample_count = cmd->stop_arg;
                    devpriv->ai_continous = 0;
                    break;
            case TRIG_NONE:
                    /*  continous acquisition */
                    devpriv->ai_continous = 1;
                    devpriv->ai_sample_count = 0;
                    break;
            }
    
    The interrupt handler `s626_irq_handler()` contains this code:
    
                    if (!(devpriv->ai_continous))
                            devpriv->ai_sample_count--;
                    if (devpriv->ai_sample_count <= 0) {
                            devpriv->ai_cmd_running = 0;
                            /* ... */
                    }
    
    So `devpriv->ai_sample_count` is only decremented for the `TRIG_COUNT`
    case, but `devpriv->ai_cmd_running` is set to 0 (and the command
    stopped) regardless.
    
    Fix this in `s626_ai_cmd()` by setting `devpriv->ai_sample_count = 1`
    for the `TRIG_NONE` case.  The interrupt handler will not decrement it
    so it will remain greater than 0 and the check for stopping the
    acquisition will fail.

    SUNRPC: Add barriers to ensure read ordering in rpc_wake_up_task_queue_locked
    
    commit 1166fde6a923c30f4351515b6a9a1efc513e7d00 upstream.
    
    We need to be careful when testing task->tk_waitqueue in
    rpc_wake_up_task_queue_locked, because it can be changed while we
    are holding the queue->lock.
    By adding appropriate memory barriers, we can ensure that it is safe to
    test task->tk_waitqueue for equality if the RPC_TASK_QUEUED bit is set.

    kernel/signal.c: use __ARCH_HAS_SA_RESTORER instead of SA_RESTORER
    
    commit 522cff142d7d2f9230839c9e1f21a4d8bcc22a4a upstream.
    
    __ARCH_HAS_SA_RESTORER is the preferred conditional for use in 3.9 and
    later kernels, per Kees.

    signal: Define __ARCH_HAS_SA_RESTORER so we know whether to clear sa_restorer
    
    Vaguely based on upstream commit 574c4866e33d 'consolidate kernel-side
    struct sigaction declarations'.
    
    flush_signal_handlers() needs to know whether sigaction::sa_restorer
    is defined, not whether SA_RESTORER is defined.  Define the
    __ARCH_HAS_SA_RESTORER macro to indicate this.
