    xen/netfront: react properly to failing gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref()
    
    Commit 66e3531b33ee51dad17c463b4d9c9f52e341503d upstream.
    
    When calling gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() the returned value must
    be tested and the reaction to that value should be appropriate.
    
    In case of failure in xennet_get_responses() the reaction should not be
    to crash the system, but to disable the network device.
    
    The calls in setup_netfront() can be replaced by calls of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access(). While at it avoid double free of ring
    pages and grant references via xennet_disconnect_backend() in this case.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23042 / part of XSA-396.

    xen/gnttab: fix gnttab_end_foreign_access() without page specified
    
    Commit 42baefac638f06314298087394b982ead9ec444b upstream.
    
    gnttab_end_foreign_access() is used to free a grant reference and
    optionally to free the associated page. In case the grant is still in
    use by the other side processing is being deferred. This leads to a
    problem in case no page to be freed is specified by the caller: the
    caller doesn't know that the page is still mapped by the other side
    and thus should not be used for other purposes.
    
    The correct way to handle this situation is to take an additional
    reference to the granted page in case handling is being deferred and
    to drop that reference when the grant reference could be freed
    finally.
    
    This requires that there are no users of gnttab_end_foreign_access()
    left directly repurposing the granted page after the call, as this
    might result in clobbered data or information leaks via the not yet
    freed grant reference.
    
    This is part of CVE-2022-23041 / XSA-396.

    xen/9p: use alloc/free_pages_exact()
    
    Commit 5cadd4bb1d7fc9ab201ac14620d1a478357e4ebd upstream.
    
    Instead of __get_free_pages() and free_pages() use alloc_pages_exact()
    and free_pages_exact(). This is in preparation of a change of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access() which will prohibit use of high-order
    pages.
    
    By using the local variable "order" instead of ring->intf->ring_order
    in the error path of xen_9pfs_front_alloc_dataring() another bug is
    fixed, as the error path can be entered before ring->intf->ring_order
    is being set.
    
    By using alloc_pages_exact() the size in bytes is specified for the
    allocation, which fixes another bug for the case of
    order < (PAGE_SHIFT - XEN_PAGE_SHIFT).
    
    This is part of CVE-2022-23041 / XSA-396.

    xen: remove gnttab_query_foreign_access()
    
    Commit 1dbd11ca75fe664d3e54607547771d021f531f59 upstream.
    
    Remove gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as it is unused and unsafe to
    use.
    
    All previous use cases assumed a grant would not be in use after
    gnttab_query_foreign_access() returned 0. This information is useless
    in best case, as it only refers to a situation in the past, which could
    have changed already.

    Commit d3b6372c5881cb54925212abb62c521df8ba4809 upstream.
    
    Using gnttab_query_foreign_access() is unsafe, as it is racy by design.
    
    The use case in the gntalloc driver is not needed at all. While at it
    replace the call of gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() with a call of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access(), which is what is really wanted there. In
    case the grant wasn't used due to an allocation failure, just free the
    grant via gnttab_free_grant_reference().
    
    This is CVE-2022-23039 / part of XSA-396.

    Commit 6b1775f26a2da2b05a6dc8ec2b5d14e9a4701a1a upstream.
    
    Add a new grant table function gnttab_try_end_foreign_access(), which
    will remove and free a grant if it is not in use.
    
    Its main use case is to either free a grant if it is no longer in use,
    or to take some other action if it is still in use. This other action
    can be an error exit, or (e.g. in the case of blkfront persistent grant
    feature) some special handling.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23038 / part of XSA-396.

    xen/xenbus: don't let xenbus_grant_ring() remove grants in error case
    
    Commit 3777ea7bac3113005b7180e6b9dadf16d19a5827 upstream.
    
    Letting xenbus_grant_ring() tear down grants in the error case is
    problematic, as the other side could already have used these grants.
    Calling gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() without checking success is
    resulting in an unclear situation for any caller of xenbus_grant_ring()
    as in the error case the memory pages of the ring page might be
    partially mapped. Freeing them would risk unwanted foreign access to
    them, while not freeing them would leak memory.
    
    In order to remove the need to undo any gnttab_grant_foreign_access()
    calls, use gnttab_alloc_grant_references() to make sure no further
    error can occur in the loop granting access to the ring pages.
    
    It should be noted that this way of handling removes leaking of
    grant entries in the error case, too.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23040 / part of XSA-396.

    arm/arm64: smccc/psci: add arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit()
    
    commit 6b7fe77c334ae59fed9500140e08f4f896b36871 upstream.
    
    SMCCC callers are currently amassing a collection of enums for the SMCCC
    conduit, and are having to dig into the PSCI driver's internals in order
    to figure out what to do.
    
    Let's clean this up, with common SMCCC_CONDUIT_* definitions, and an
    arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit() helper that abstracts the PSCI driver's
    internal state.
    
    We can kill off the PSCI_CONDUIT_* definitions once we've migrated users
    over to the new interface.

    arm/arm64: Provide a wrapper for SMCCC 1.1 calls
    
    commit 541625ac47ce9d0835efaee0fcbaa251b0000a37 upstream.
    
    SMCCC 1.1 calls may use either HVC or SMC depending on the PSCI
    conduit. Rather than coding this in every call site, provide a macro
    which uses the correct instruction. The macro also handles the case
    where no conduit is configured/available returning a not supported error
    in res, along with returning the conduit used for the call.
    
    This allow us to remove some duplicated code and will be useful later
    when adding paravirtualized time hypervisor calls.

    x86/speculation: Warn about eIBRS + LFENCE + Unprivileged eBPF + SMT
    
    commit 0de05d056afdb00eca8c7bbb0c79a3438daf700c upstream.
    
    The commit
    
       44a3918c8245 ("x86/speculation: Include unprivileged eBPF status in Spectre v2 mitigation reporting")
    
    added a warning for the "eIBRS + unprivileged eBPF" combination, which
    has been shown to be vulnerable against Spectre v2 BHB-based attacks.
    
    However, there's no warning about the "eIBRS + LFENCE retpoline +
    unprivileged eBPF" combo. The LFENCE adds more protection by shortening
    the speculation window after a mispredicted branch. That makes an attack
    significantly more difficult, even with unprivileged eBPF. So at least
    for now the logic doesn't warn about that combination.
    
    But if you then add SMT into the mix, the SMT attack angle weakens the
    effectiveness of the LFENCE considerably.
    
    So extend the "eIBRS + unprivileged eBPF" warning to also include the
    "eIBRS + LFENCE + unprivileged eBPF + SMT" case.

    x86/speculation: Warn about Spectre v2 LFENCE mitigation
    
    commit eafd987d4a82c7bb5aa12f0e3b4f8f3dea93e678 upstream.
    
    With:
    
      f8a66d608a3e ("x86,bugs: Unconditionally allow spectre_v2=retpoline,amd")
    
    it became possible to enable the LFENCE "retpoline" on Intel. However,
    Intel doesn't recommend it, as it has some weaknesses compared to
    retpoline.
    
    Now AMD doesn't recommend it either.
    
    It can still be left available as a cmdline option. It's faster than
    retpoline but is weaker in certain scenarios -- particularly SMT, but
    even non-SMT may be vulnerable in some cases.
    
    So just unconditionally warn if the user requests it on the cmdline.

    x86/speculation: Use generic retpoline by default on AMD
    
    commit 244d00b5dd4755f8df892c86cab35fb2cfd4f14b upstream.
    
    AMD retpoline may be susceptible to speculation. The speculation
    execution window for an incorrect indirect branch prediction using
    LFENCE/JMP sequence may potentially be large enough to allow
    exploitation using Spectre V2.
    
    By default, don't use retpoline,lfence on AMD.  Instead, use the
    generic retpoline.

    When both are enabled, print a warning message and report it in the
    'spectre_v2' sysfs vulnerabilities file.

    commit 1e19da8522c81bf46b335f84137165741e0d82b7 upstream.
    
    Thanks to the chaps at VUsec it is now clear that eIBRS is not
    sufficient, therefore allow enabling of retpolines along with eIBRS.
    
    Add spectre_v2=eibrs, spectre_v2=eibrs,lfence and
    spectre_v2=eibrs,retpoline options to explicitly pick your preferred
    means of mitigation.
    
    Since there's new mitigations there's also user visible changes in
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2 to reflect these
    new mitigations.

    x86/speculation: Rename RETPOLINE_AMD to RETPOLINE_LFENCE
    
    commit d45476d9832409371537013ebdd8dc1a7781f97a upstream.
    
    The RETPOLINE_AMD name is unfortunate since it isn't necessarily
    AMD only, in fact Hygon also uses it. Furthermore it will likely be
    sufficient for some Intel processors. Therefore rename the thing to
    RETPOLINE_LFENCE to better describe what it is.
    
    Add the spectre_v2=retpoline,lfence option as an alias to
    spectre_v2=retpoline,amd to preserve existing setups. However, the output
    of /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2 will be changed.
