    xen/netfront: react properly to failing gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref()
    
    Commit 66e3531b33ee51dad17c463b4d9c9f52e341503d upstream.
    
    When calling gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() the returned value must
    be tested and the reaction to that value should be appropriate.
    
    In case of failure in xennet_get_responses() the reaction should not be
    to crash the system, but to disable the network device.
    
    The calls in setup_netfront() can be replaced by calls of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access(). While at it avoid double free of ring
    pages and grant references via xennet_disconnect_backend() in this case.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23042 / part of XSA-396.

    xen/gnttab: fix gnttab_end_foreign_access() without page specified
    
    Commit 42baefac638f06314298087394b982ead9ec444b upstream.
    
    gnttab_end_foreign_access() is used to free a grant reference and
    optionally to free the associated page. In case the grant is still in
    use by the other side processing is being deferred. This leads to a
    problem in case no page to be freed is specified by the caller: the
    caller doesn't know that the page is still mapped by the other side
    and thus should not be used for other purposes.
    
    The correct way to handle this situation is to take an additional
    reference to the granted page in case handling is being deferred and
    to drop that reference when the grant reference could be freed
    finally.
    
    This requires that there are no users of gnttab_end_foreign_access()
    left directly repurposing the granted page after the call, as this
    might result in clobbered data or information leaks via the not yet
    freed grant reference.
    
    This is part of CVE-2022-23041 / XSA-396.

    xen: remove gnttab_query_foreign_access()
    
    Commit 1dbd11ca75fe664d3e54607547771d021f531f59 upstream.
    
    Remove gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as it is unused and unsafe to
    use.
    
    All previous use cases assumed a grant would not be in use after
    gnttab_query_foreign_access() returned 0. This information is useless
    in best case, as it only refers to a situation in the past, which could
    have changed already.

    xen/gntalloc: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access()
    
    Commit d3b6372c5881cb54925212abb62c521df8ba4809 upstream.
    
    Using gnttab_query_foreign_access() is unsafe, as it is racy by design.
    
    The use case in the gntalloc driver is not needed at all. While at it
    replace the call of gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() with a call of
    gnttab_end_foreign_access(), which is what is really wanted there. In
    case the grant wasn't used due to an allocation failure, just free the
    grant via gnttab_free_grant_reference().
    
    This is CVE-2022-23039 / part of XSA-396.

    Commit 6b1775f26a2da2b05a6dc8ec2b5d14e9a4701a1a upstream.
    
    Add a new grant table function gnttab_try_end_foreign_access(), which
    will remove and free a grant if it is not in use.
    
    Its main use case is to either free a grant if it is no longer in use,
    or to take some other action if it is still in use. This other action
    can be an error exit, or (e.g. in the case of blkfront persistent grant
    feature) some special handling.

    xen/xenbus: don't let xenbus_grant_ring() remove grants in error case
    
    Commit 3777ea7bac3113005b7180e6b9dadf16d19a5827 upstream.
    
    Letting xenbus_grant_ring() tear down grants in the error case is
    problematic, as the other side could already have used these grants.
    Calling gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() without checking success is
    resulting in an unclear situation for any caller of xenbus_grant_ring()
    as in the error case the memory pages of the ring page might be
    partially mapped. Freeing them would risk unwanted foreign access to
    them, while not freeing them would leak memory.
    
    In order to remove the need to undo any gnttab_grant_foreign_access()
    calls, use gnttab_alloc_grant_references() to make sure no further
    error can occur in the loop granting access to the ring pages.
    
    It should be noted that this way of handling removes leaking of
    grant entries in the error case, too.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23040 / part of XSA-396.

    x86/build: Fix compiler support check for CONFIG_RETPOLINE
    
    commit 25896d073d8a0403b07e6dec56f58e6c33678207 upstream.
    
    It is troublesome to add a diagnostic like this to the Makefile
    parse stage because the top-level Makefile could be parsed with
    a stale include/config/auto.conf.
    
    Once you are hit by the error about non-retpoline compiler, the
    compilation still breaks even after disabling CONFIG_RETPOLINE.
    
    The easiest fix is to move this check to the "archprepare" like
    this commit did:

    commit b9baf5c8c5c356757f4f9d8180b5e9d234065bc3 upstream.
    
    Workaround the Spectre BHB issues for Cortex-A15, Cortex-A57,
    Cortex-A72, Cortex-A73 and Cortex-A75. We also include Brahma B15 as
    well to be safe, which is affected by Spectre V2 in the same ways as
    Cortex-A15.

    arm/arm64: smccc/psci: add arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit()
    
    commit 6b7fe77c334ae59fed9500140e08f4f896b36871 upstream.
    
    SMCCC callers are currently amassing a collection of enums for the SMCCC
    conduit, and are having to dig into the PSCI driver's internals in order
    to figure out what to do.
    
    Let's clean this up, with common SMCCC_CONDUIT_* definitions, and an
    arm_smccc_1_1_get_conduit() helper that abstracts the PSCI driver's
    internal state.
    
    We can kill off the PSCI_CONDUIT_* definitions once we've migrated users
    over to the new interface.

    arm/arm64: Provide a wrapper for SMCCC 1.1 calls
    
    commit 541625ac47ce9d0835efaee0fcbaa251b0000a37 upstream.
    
    SMCCC 1.1 calls may use either HVC or SMC depending on the PSCI
    conduit. Rather than coding this in every call site, provide a macro
    which uses the correct instruction. The macro also handles the case
    where no conduit is configured/available returning a not supported error
    in res, along with returning the conduit used for the call.
    
    This allow us to remove some duplicated code and will be useful later
    when adding paravirtualized time hypervisor calls.

    x86/speculation: Warn about eIBRS + LFENCE + Unprivileged eBPF + SMT
    
    commit 0de05d056afdb00eca8c7bbb0c79a3438daf700c upstream.
    
    The commit
    
       44a3918c8245 ("x86/speculation: Include unprivileged eBPF status in Spectre v2 mitigation reporting")
    
    added a warning for the "eIBRS + unprivileged eBPF" combination, which
    has been shown to be vulnerable against Spectre v2 BHB-based attacks.
    
    However, there's no warning about the "eIBRS + LFENCE retpoline +
    unprivileged eBPF" combo. The LFENCE adds more protection by shortening
    the speculation window after a mispredicted branch. That makes an attack
    significantly more difficult, even with unprivileged eBPF. So at least
    for now the logic doesn't warn about that combination.
    
    But if you then add SMT into the mix, the SMT attack angle weakens the
    effectiveness of the LFENCE considerably.
    
    So extend the "eIBRS + unprivileged eBPF" warning to also include the
    "eIBRS + LFENCE + unprivileged eBPF + SMT" case.

    x86/speculation: Warn about Spectre v2 LFENCE mitigation
    
    commit eafd987d4a82c7bb5aa12f0e3b4f8f3dea93e678 upstream.
    
    With:
    
      f8a66d608a3e ("x86,bugs: Unconditionally allow spectre_v2=retpoline,amd")
    
    it became possible to enable the LFENCE "retpoline" on Intel. However,
    Intel doesn't recommend it, as it has some weaknesses compared to
    retpoline.
    
    Now AMD doesn't recommend it either.
    
    It can still be left available as a cmdline option. It's faster than
    retpoline but is weaker in certain scenarios -- particularly SMT, but
    even non-SMT may be vulnerable in some cases.
    
    So just unconditionally warn if the user requests it on the cmdline.

    commit 244d00b5dd4755f8df892c86cab35fb2cfd4f14b upstream.
    
    AMD retpoline may be susceptible to speculation. The speculation
    execution window for an incorrect indirect branch prediction using
    LFENCE/JMP sequence may potentially be large enough to allow
    exploitation using Spectre V2.
    
    By default, don't use retpoline,lfence on AMD.  Instead, use the
    generic retpoline.

    commit 1e19da8522c81bf46b335f84137165741e0d82b7 upstream.
    
    Thanks to the chaps at VUsec it is now clear that eIBRS is not
    sufficient, therefore allow enabling of retpolines along with eIBRS.
    
    Add spectre_v2=eibrs, spectre_v2=eibrs,lfence and
    spectre_v2=eibrs,retpoline options to explicitly pick your preferred
    means of mitigation.
    
    Since there's new mitigations there's also user visible changes in
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2 to reflect these
    new mitigations.

    x86/speculation: Rename RETPOLINE_AMD to RETPOLINE_LFENCE
    
    commit d45476d9832409371537013ebdd8dc1a7781f97a upstream.
    
    The RETPOLINE_AMD name is unfortunate since it isn't necessarily
    AMD only, in fact Hygon also uses it. Furthermore it will likely be
    sufficient for some Intel processors. Therefore rename the thing to
    RETPOLINE_LFENCE to better describe what it is.
    
    Add the spectre_v2=retpoline,lfence option as an alias to
    spectre_v2=retpoline,amd to preserve existing setups. However, the output
    of /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2 will be changed.

    Documentation: refer to config RANDOMIZE_BASE for kernel address-space randomization
    
    commit 82ca67321f55a8d1da6ac3ed611da3c32818bb37 upstream.
    
    The config RANDOMIZE_SLAB does not exist, the authors probably intended to
    refer to the config RANDOMIZE_BASE, which provides kernel address-space
    randomization. They probably just confused SLAB with BASE (these two
    four-letter words coincidentally share three common letters), as they also
    point out the config SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM as further randomization within
    the same sentence.
    
    Fix the reference of the config for kernel address-space randomization to
    the config that provides that.

    Now that CONFIG_RETPOLINE hard depends on compiler support, there is no
    reason to keep the minimal retpoline support around which only provided
    basic protection in the assembly files.

    x86/retpoline: Make CONFIG_RETPOLINE depend on compiler support
    
    commit 4cd24de3a0980bf3100c9dcb08ef65ca7c31af48 upstream.
    
    Since retpoline capable compilers are widely available, make
    CONFIG_RETPOLINE hard depend on the compiler capability.
    
    Break the build when CONFIG_RETPOLINE is enabled and the compiler does not
    support it. Emit an error message in that case:
    
     "arch/x86/Makefile:226: *** You are building kernel with non-retpoline
      compiler, please update your compiler..  Stop."
    
    [dwmw: Fail the build with non-retpoline compiler]
