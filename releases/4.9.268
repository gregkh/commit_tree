    net: hso: fix NULL-deref on disconnect regression
    
    commit 2ad5692db72874f02b9ad551d26345437ea4f7f3 upstream.
    
    Commit 8a12f8836145 ("net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device
    unregistration") fixed the racy minor allocation reported by syzbot, but
    introduced an unconditional NULL-pointer dereference on every disconnect
    instead.
    
    Specifically, the serial device table must no longer be accessed after
    the minor has been released by hso_serial_tty_unregister().

    x86/crash: Fix crash_setup_memmap_entries() out-of-bounds access
    
    commit 5849cdf8c120e3979c57d34be55b92d90a77a47e upstream.
    
    Commit in Fixes: added support for kexec-ing a kernel on panic using a
    new system call. As part of it, it does prepare a memory map for the new
    kernel.
    
    However, while doing so, it wrongly accesses memory it has not
    allocated: it accesses the first element of the cmem->ranges[] array in
    memmap_exclude_ranges() but it has not allocated the memory for it in
    crash_setup_memmap_entries(). As KASAN reports:

    ia64: fix discontig.c section mismatches

    Fix IA64 discontig.c Section mismatch warnings.
    
    When CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y and CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y, the functions
    computer_pernodesize() and scatter_node_data() should not be marked as
    __meminit because they are needed after init, on any memory hotplug
    event.  Also, early_nr_cpus_node() is called by compute_pernodesize(),
    so early_nr_cpus_node() cannot be __meminit either.
    
      WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x1612): Section mismatch in reference from the function arch_alloc_nodedata() to the function .meminit.text:compute_pernodesize()
      The function arch_alloc_nodedata() references the function __meminit compute_pernodesize().
      This is often because arch_alloc_nodedata lacks a __meminit annotation or the annotation of compute_pernodesize is wrong.
    
      WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x1692): Section mismatch in reference from the function arch_refresh_nodedata() to the function .meminit.text:scatter_node_data()

    xen-netback: Check for hotplug-status existence before watching
    
    [ Upstream commit 2afeec08ab5c86ae21952151f726bfe184f6b23d ]
    
    The logic in connect() is currently written with the assumption that
    xenbus_watch_pathfmt() will return an error for a node that does not
    exist.  This assumption is incorrect: xenstore does allow a watch to
    be registered for a nonexistent node (and will send notifications
    should the node be subsequently created).
    
    As of commit 1f2565780 ("xen-netback: remove 'hotplug-status' once it
    has served its purpose"), this leads to a failure when a domU
    transitions into XenbusStateConnected more than once.  On the first
    domU transition into Connected state, the "hotplug-status" node will
    be deleted by the hotplug_status_changed() callback in dom0.  On the
    second or subsequent domU transition into Connected state, the
    hotplug_status_changed() callback will therefore never be invoked, and
    so the backend will remain stuck in InitWait.
    
    This failure prevents scenarios such as reloading the xen-netfront
    module within a domU, or booting a domU via iPXE.  There is
    unfortunately no way for the domU to work around this dom0 bug.
    
    Fix by explicitly checking for existence of the "hotplug-status" node,
    thereby creating the behaviour that was previously assumed to exist.

    s390/entry: save the caller of psw_idle
    
    [ Upstream commit a994eddb947ea9ebb7b14d9a1267001699f0a136 ]
    
    Currently psw_idle does not allocate a stack frame and does not
    save its r14 and r15 into the save area. Even though this is valid from
    call ABI point of view, because psw_idle does not make any calls
    explicitly, in reality psw_idle is an entry point for controlled
    transition into serving interrupts. So, in practice, psw_idle stack
    frame is analyzed during stack unwinding. Depending on build options
    that r14 slot in the save area of psw_idle might either contain a value
    saved by previous sibling call or complete garbage.

    So, to make a stacktrace nicer and actually point for the real caller of
    psw_idle in this frequently occurring case, make psw_idle save its r14.

    net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration
    
    commit 8a12f8836145ffe37e9c8733dce18c22fb668b66 upstream
    
    Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double
    unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds
    but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.
    
    The get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number
    but doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller
    later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()
    would return the same minor number.
    
    Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number
    immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor()
    to better reflect what it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index()
    to release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the
    given hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding
    release_minor() call.

    usbip: vudc synchronize sysfs code paths
    
    commit bd8b82042269a95db48074b8bb400678dbac1815 upstream.
    
    Fuzzing uncovered race condition between sysfs code paths in usbip
    drivers. Device connect/disconnect code paths initiated through
    sysfs interface are prone to races if disconnect happens during
    connect and vice versa.
    
    Use sysfs_lock to protect sysfs paths in vudc.

    usbip: add sysfs_lock to synchronize sysfs code paths
    
    commit 4e9c93af7279b059faf5bb1897ee90512b258a12 upstream.
    
    Fuzzing uncovered race condition between sysfs code paths in usbip
    drivers. Device connect/disconnect code paths initiated through
    sysfs interface are prone to races if disconnect happens during
    connect and vice versa.
    
    This problem is common to all drivers while it can be reproduced easily
    in vhci_hcd. Add a sysfs_lock to usbip_device struct to protect the paths.
    
    Use this in vhci_hcd to protect sysfs paths. For a complete fix, usip_host
    and usip-vudc drivers and the event handler will have to use this lock to
    protect the paths. These changes will be done in subsequent patches.

    ARM: 9071/1: uprobes: Don't hook on thumb instructions
    
    commit d2f7eca60b29006285d57c7035539e33300e89e5 upstream.
    
    Since uprobes is not supported for thumb, check that the thumb bit is
    not set when matching the uprobes instruction hooks.
    
    The Arm UDF instructions used for uprobes triggering
    (UPROBE_SWBP_ARM_INSN and UPROBE_SS_ARM_INSN) coincidentally share the
    same encoding as a pair of unallocated 32-bit thumb instructions (not
    UDF) when the condition code is 0b1111 (0xf). This in effect makes it
    possible to trigger the uprobes functionality from thumb, and at that
    using two unallocated instructions which are not permanently undefined.

    i40e: fix the panic when running bpf in xdpdrv mode
    
    commit 4e39a072a6a0fc422ba7da5e4336bdc295d70211 upstream.
    
    Fix this panic by adding more rules to calculate the value of @rss_size_max
    which could be used in allocating the queues when bpf is loaded, which,
    however, could cause the failure and then trigger the NULL pointer of
    vsi->rx_rings. Prio to this fix, the machine doesn't care about how many
    cpus are online and then allocates 256 queues on the machine with 32 cpus
    online actually.
    
    Once the load of bpf begins, the log will go like this "failed to get
    tracking for 256 queues for VSI 0 err -12" and this "setup of MAIN VSI
    failed".
    
    Thus, I attach the key information of the crash-log here.

    scsi: libsas: Reset num_scatter if libata marks qc as NODATA
    
    commit 176ddd89171ddcf661862d90c5d257877f7326d6 upstream.
    
    When the cache_type for the SCSI device is changed, the SCSI layer issues a
    MODE_SELECT command. The caching mode details are communicated via a
    request buffer associated with the SCSI command with data direction set as
    DMA_TO_DEVICE (scsi_mode_select()). When this command reaches the libata
    layer, as a part of generic initial setup, libata layer sets up the
    scatterlist for the command using the SCSI command (ata_scsi_qc_new()).
    This command is then translated by the libata layer into
    ATA_CMD_SET_FEATURES (ata_scsi_mode_select_xlat()). The libata layer treats
    this as a non-data command (ata_mselect_caching()), since it only needs an
    ATA taskfile to pass the caching on/off information to the device. It does
    not need the scatterlist that has been setup, so it does not perform
    dma_map_sg() on the scatterlist (ata_qc_issue()). Unfortunately, when this
    command reaches the libsas layer (sas_ata_qc_issue()), libsas layer sees it
    as a non-data command with a scatterlist. It cannot extract the correct DMA
    length since the scatterlist has not been mapped with dma_map_sg() for a
    DMA operation. When this partially constructed SAS task reaches pm80xx
    LLDD, it results in the following warning:
    
    "pm80xx_chip_sata_req 6058: The sg list address
    start_addr=0x0000000000000000 data_len=0x0end_addr_high=0xffffffff
    end_addr_low=0xffffffff has crossed 4G boundary"
    
    Update libsas to handle ATA non-data commands separately so num_scatter and
    total_xfer_len remain 0.

    [ Upstream commit 5582d641e6740839c9b83efd1fbf9bcd00b6f5fc ]
    
    This patch stops dumping llsec devs for monitors which we don't support
    yet. Otherwise we will access llsec mib which isn't initialized for
    monitors.

    ASoC: fsl_esai: Fix TDM slot setup for I2S mode
    
    [ Upstream commit e7a48c710defa0e0fef54d42b7d9e4ab596e2761 ]
    
    When using the driver in I2S TDM mode, the fsl_esai_startup()
    function rewrites the number of slots previously set by the
    fsl_esai_set_dai_tdm_slot() function to 2.
    To fix this, let's use the saved slot count value or, if TDM
    is not used and the number of slots is not set, the driver will use
    the default value (2), which is set by fsl_esai_probe().

    neighbour: Disregard DEAD dst in neigh_update
    
    [ Upstream commit d47ec7a0a7271dda08932d6208e4ab65ab0c987c ]
    
    After a short network outage, the dst_entry is timed out and put
    in DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD. We are in this code because arp reply comes
    from this neighbour after network recovers. There is a potential
    race condition that dst_entry is still in DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD.
    With that, another neighbour lookup causes more harm than good.
    
    In best case all packets in arp_queue are lost. This is
    counterproductive to the original goal of finding a better path
    for those packets.
    
    I observed a worst case with 4.x kernel where a dst_entry in
    DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD state is associated with loopback net_device.
    It leads to an ethernet header with all zero addresses.
    A packet with all zero source MAC address is quite deadly with
    mac80211, ath9k and 802.11 block ack.  It fails
    ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr in ath9k (xmit.c). Ath9k flushes tx
    queue (ath_tx_complete_aggr). BAW (block ack window) is not
    updated. BAW logic is damaged and ath9k transmission is disabled.

    Input: nspire-keypad - enable interrupts only when opened
    
    [ Upstream commit 69d5ff3e9e51e23d5d81bf48480aa5671be67a71 ]
    
    The driver registers an interrupt handler in _probe, but didn't configure
    them until later when the _open function is called. In between, the keypad
    can fire an IRQ due to touchpad activity, which the handler ignores. This
    causes the kernel to disable the interrupt, blocking the keypad from
    working.
    
    Fix this by disabling interrupts before registering the handler.
    Additionally, disable them in _close, so that they're only enabled while
    open.

    net/sctp: fix race condition in sctp_destroy_sock
    
    commit b166a20b07382b8bc1dcee2a448715c9c2c81b5b upstream.
    
    If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
    held and sp->do_auto_asconf is true, then an element is removed
    from the auto_asconf_splist without any proper locking.
    
    This can happen in the following functions:
    1. In sctp_accept, if sctp_sock_migrate fails.
    2. In inet_create or inet6_create, if there is a bpf program
       attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE which denies
       creation of the sctp socket.
    
    The bug is fixed by acquiring addr_wq_lock in sctp_destroy_sock
    instead of sctp_close.
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-23133.
