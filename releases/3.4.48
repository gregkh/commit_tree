    thinkpad-acpi: recognize latest V-Series using DMI_BIOS_VENDOR
    
    commit a4f46bb9fa84642e356898ee44b670989622f8bb upstream.
    
    In the latest V-series bios DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION does not contain
    the string Lenovo or Thinkpad, but is set to the model number, this
    causes the thinkpad_acpi module to fail to load. Recognize laptop
    as Lenovo using DMI_BIOS_VENDOR instead, which is set to Lenovo.
    
    Test on V490u

    mac80211: close AP_VLAN interfaces before unregistering all
    
    commit c8aa22db0112f640ac6631347f850879c621840b upstream.
    
    Since Eric's commit efe117ab8 ("Speedup ieee80211_remove_interfaces")
    there's a bug in mac80211 when it unregisters with AP_VLAN interfaces
    up. If the AP_VLAN interface was registered after the AP it belongs
    to (which is the typical case) and then we get into this code path,
    unregister_netdevice_many() will crash because it isn't prepared to
    deal with interfaces being closed in the middle of it. Exactly this
    happens though, because we iterate the list, find the AP master this
    AP_VLAN belongs to and dev_close() the dependent VLANs. After this,
    unregister_netdevice_many() won't pick up the fact that the AP_VLAN
    is already down and will do it again, causing a crash.

    commit 9271b0b4b2044c6db06051fe60bc58cdd4f17c7c upstream.
    
    The latest GCC 4.8 does some more checking on type attributes that
    break the build for ARCH=um -> fill them in.  Specifically, the
    "asmlinkage" attributes is now tested for consistency.

    iommu/amd: Workaround for ERBT1312
    
    commit d3263bc29706e42f74d8800807c2dedf320d77f1 upstream.
    
    Work around an IOMMU  hardware bug where clearing the
    EVT_INT or PPR_INT bit in the status register may race with
    the hardware trying to set it again. When not handled the
    bit might not be cleared and we lose all future event or ppr
    interrupts.

    iommu/amd: Re-enable IOMMU event log interrupt after handling.
    
    commit 925fe08bce38d1ff052fe2209b9e2b8d5fbb7f98 upstream.
    
    Current driver does not clear the IOMMU event log interrupt bit
    in the IOMMU status register after processing an interrupt.
    This causes the IOMMU hardware to generate event log interrupt only once.
    This has been observed in both IOMMU v1 and V2 hardware.
    This patch clears the bit by writing 1 to bit 1 of the IOMMU
    status register (MMIO Offset 2020h)

    jfs: fix a couple races
    
    commit 73aaa22d5ffb2630456bac2f9a4ed9b81d0d7271 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes races uncovered by xfstests testcase 068.
    
    One race is the result of jfs_sync() trying to write a sync point to the
    journal after it has been frozen (or possibly in the process). Since
    freezing sync's the journal, there is no need to write a sync point so
    we simply want to return.
    
    The second involves jfs_write_inode() being called on a deleted inode.
    It calls jfs_flush_journal which is held up by the jfs_commit thread
    doing the final iput on the same deleted inode, which itself is
    waiting for the I_SYNC flag to be cleared. jfs_write_inode need not
    do anything when i_nlink is zero, which is the easy fix.

    xen/events: Handle VIRQ_TIMER before any other hardirq in event loop.
    
    commit bee980d9e9642e96351fa3ca9077b853ecf62f57 upstream.
    
    This avoids any other hardirq handler seeing a very stale jiffies
    value immediately after wakeup from a long idle period. The one
    observable symptom of this was a USB keyboard, with software keyboard
    repeat, which would always repeat a key immediately that it was
    pressed. This is due to the key press waking the guest, the key
    handler immediately runs, sees an old jiffies value, and then that
    jiffies value significantly updated, before the key is unpressed.

    m68k/mac: Fix unexpected interrupt with CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK
    
    commit df66834a43c461de2565c45d815288ba1c0def37 upstream.
    
    The present code does not wait for the SCC to finish resetting itself
    before trying to initialise the device. The result is that the SCC
    interrupt sources become enabled (if they weren't already). This leads to
    an early boot crash (unexpected interrupt) given CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK. Fix
    this by adding a delay. A successful reset disables the interrupt sources.
    
    Also, after the reset for channel A setup, the SCC then gets a second
    reset for channel B setup which leaves channel A uninitialised again. Fix
    this by performing the reset only once.

    libata: make ata_exec_internal_sg honor DMADIR
    
    commit e771451c0a831d96a7c14b0ca8a8ec671d98567b upstream.
    
    libata honors DMADIR for regular commands, but not for internal commands
    used (among other) during device initialisation.
    
    This makes SATA-host-to-PATA-device bridges based on Silicon Image SiL3611
    (such as "Abit Serillel 2") end up disabled when used with an ATAPI device
    after a few tries.
    
    Log output of the bridge being hot-plugged with an ATAPI drive:

    cifs: fix potential buffer overrun when composing a new options string
    
    commit 166faf21bd14bc5c5295a44874bf7f3930c30b20 upstream.
    
    Consider the case where we have a very short ip= string in the original
    mount options, and when we chase a referral we end up with a very long
    IPv6 address. Be sure to allow for that possibility when estimating the
    size of the string to allocate.

    commit 09fb8bd1a63b0f9f15e655c4fe8d047e5d2bf67a upstream.
    
    Newer asics have variable numbers of crtcs.  Use that
    rather than the asic family to determine which crtcs
    to check.  This avoids checking non-existent crtcs or
    missing crtcs on certain asics.

    We should not use set_pmd_at to update pmd_t with pgtable_t pointer.

    mm/pagewalk.c: walk_page_range should avoid VM_PFNMAP areas
    
    commit a9ff785e4437c83d2179161e012f5bdfbd6381f0 upstream.
    
    A panic can be caused by simply cat'ing /proc/<pid>/smaps while an
    application has a VM_PFNMAP range.  It happened in-house when a
    benchmarker was trying to decipher the memory layout of his program.
    
    /proc/<pid>/smaps and similar walks through a user page table should not
    be looking at VM_PFNMAP areas.
    
    Certain tests in walk_page_range() (specifically split_huge_page_pmd())
    assume that all the mapped PFN's are backed with page structures.  And
    this is not usually true for VM_PFNMAP areas.  This can result in panics
    on kernel page faults when attempting to address those page structures.
    
    There are a half dozen callers of walk_page_range() that walk through a
    task's entire page table (as N.  Horiguchi pointed out).  So rather than
    change all of them, this patch changes just walk_page_range() to ignore
    VM_PFNMAP areas.
    
    The logic of hugetlb_vma() is moved back into walk_page_range(), as we
    want to test any vma in the range.
    
    VM_PFNMAP areas are used by:
    - graphics memory manager   gpu/drm/drm_gem.c
    - global reference unit     sgi-gru/grufile.c
    - sgi special memory        char/mspec.c
    - and probably several out-of-tree modules

    mm: mmu_notifier: re-fix freed page still mapped in secondary MMU
    
    commit d34883d4e35c0a994e91dd847a82b4c9e0c31d83 upstream.
    
    Commit 751efd8610d3 ("mmu_notifier_unregister NULL Pointer deref and
    multiple ->release()") breaks the fix 3ad3d901bbcf ("mm: mmu_notifier:
    fix freed page still mapped in secondary MMU").
    
    Since hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() is changed now, we can not revert that
    patch directly, so this patch reverts the commit and simply fix the bug
    spotted by that patch
    
    This bug spotted by commit 751efd8610d3 is:
    
        There is a race condition between mmu_notifier_unregister() and
        __mmu_notifier_release().
    
        Assume two tasks, one calling mmu_notifier_unregister() as a result
        of a filp_close() ->flush() callout (task A), and the other calling
        mmu_notifier_release() from an mmput() (task B).
    
                            A                               B
        t1                                            srcu_read_lock()
        t2            if (!hlist_unhashed())
        t3                                            srcu_read_unlock()
        t4            srcu_read_lock()
        t5                                            hlist_del_init_rcu()
        t6                                            synchronize_srcu()
        t7            srcu_read_unlock()
        t8            hlist_del_rcu()  <--- NULL pointer deref.
    
    This can be fixed by using hlist_del_init_rcu instead of hlist_del_rcu.
    
    The another issue spotted in the commit is "multiple ->release()
    callouts", we needn't care it too much because it is really rare (e.g,
    can not happen on kvm since mmu-notify is unregistered after
    exit_mmap()) and the later call of multiple ->release should be fast
    since all the pages have already been released by the first call.
    Anyway, this issue should be fixed in a separate patch.
    
    -stable suggestions: Any version that has commit 751efd8610d3 need to be
    backported.  I find the oldest version has this commit is 3.0-stable.

    nilfs2: fix issue of nilfs_set_page_dirty() for page at EOF boundary
    
    commit 136e8770cd5d1fe38b3c613100dd6dc4db6d4fa6 upstream.
    
    nilfs2: fix issue of nilfs_set_page_dirty for page at EOF boundary
    
    DESCRIPTION:
     There are use-cases when NILFS2 file system (formatted with block size
    lesser than 4 KB) can be remounted in RO mode because of encountering of
    "broken bmap" issue.
    
    The issue was reported by Anthony Doggett <Anthony2486@interfaces.org.uk>:
     "The machine I've been trialling nilfs on is running Debian Testing,
      Linux version 3.2.0-4-686-pae (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc
      version 4.6.3 (Debian 4.6.3-14) ) #1 SMP Debian 3.2.35-2), but I've
      also reproduced it (identically) with Debian Unstable amd64 and Debian
      Experimental (using the 3.8-trunk kernel).  The problematic partitions
      were formatted with "mkfs.nilfs2 -b 1024 -B 8192"."
    
    SYMPTOMS:
    (1) System log contains error messages likewise:
    
        [63102.496756] nilfs_direct_assign: invalid pointer: 0
        [63102.496786] NILFS error (device dm-17): nilfs_bmap_assign: broken bmap (inode number=28)
        [63102.496798]
        [63102.524403] Remounting filesystem read-only
    
    (2) The NILFS2 file system is remounted in RO mode.
    
    REPRODUSING PATH:
    (1) Create volume group with name "unencrypted" by means of vgcreate utility.
    (2) Run script (prepared by Anthony Doggett <Anthony2486@interfaces.org.uk>):

    REPRODUCIBILITY: 100%
    
    INVESTIGATION:
    As it was discovered, the issue takes place during segment
    construction after executing such sequence of user-space operations:
    
      open("_darcs/index", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY, 0666) = 7
      fstat(7, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
      ftruncate(7, 60)
    
    The error message "NILFS error (device dm-17): nilfs_bmap_assign: broken
    bmap (inode number=28)" takes place because of trying to get block
    number for third block of the file with logical offset #3072 bytes.  As
    it is possible to see from above output, the file has 60 bytes of the
    whole size.  So, it is enough one block (1 KB in size) allocation for
    the whole file.  Trying to operate with several blocks instead of one
    takes place because of discovering several dirty buffers for this file
    in nilfs_segctor_scan_file() method.
    
    The root cause of this issue is in nilfs_set_page_dirty function which
    is called just before writing to an mmapped page.
    
    When nilfs_page_mkwrite function handles a page at EOF boundary, it
    fills hole blocks only inside EOF through __block_page_mkwrite().
    
    The __block_page_mkwrite() function calls set_page_dirty() after filling
    hole blocks, thus nilfs_set_page_dirty function (=
    a_ops->set_page_dirty) is called.  However, the current implementation
    of nilfs_set_page_dirty() wrongly marks all buffers dirty even for page
    at EOF boundary.
    
    As a result, buffers outside EOF are inconsistently marked dirty and
    queued for write even though they are not mapped with nilfs_get_block
    function.
    
    FIX:
    This modifies nilfs_set_page_dirty() not to mark hole blocks dirty.

    wait: fix false timeouts when using wait_event_timeout()
    
    commit 4c663cfc523a88d97a8309b04a089c27dc57fd7e upstream.
    
    Many callers of the wait_event_timeout() and
    wait_event_interruptible_timeout() expect that the return value will be
    positive if the specified condition becomes true before the timeout
    elapses.  However, at the moment this isn't guaranteed.  If the wake-up
    handler is delayed enough, the time remaining until timeout will be
    calculated as 0 - and passed back as a return value - even if the
    condition became true before the timeout has passed.
    
    Fix this by returning at least 1 if the condition becomes true.  This
    semantic is in line with what wait_for_condition_timeout() does; see
    commit bb10ed09 ("sched: fix wait_for_completion_timeout() spurious
    failure under heavy load").
    
    Daniel said "We have 3 instances of this bug in drm/i915.  One case even
    where we switch between the interruptible and not interruptible
    wait_event_timeout variants, foolishly presuming they have the same
    semantics.  I very much like this."

    klist: del waiter from klist_remove_waiters before wakeup waitting process
    
    commit ac5a2962b02f57dea76d314ef2521a2170b28ab6 upstream.
    
    There is a race between klist_remove and klist_release. klist_remove
    uses a local var waiter saved on stack. When klist_release calls
    wake_up_process(waiter->process) to wake up the waiter, waiter might run
    immediately and reuse the stack. Then, klist_release calls
    list_del(&waiter->list) to change previous
    wait data and cause prior waiter thread corrupt.
    
    The patch fixes it against kernel 3.9.

    mm compaction: fix of improper cache flush in migration code
    
    commit c2cc499c5bcf9040a738f49e8051b42078205748 upstream.
    
    Page 'new' during MIGRATION can't be flushed with flush_cache_page().
    Using flush_cache_page(vma, addr, pfn) is justified only if the page is
    already placed in process page table, and that is done right after
    flush_cache_page().  But without it the arch function has no knowledge
    of process PTE and does nothing.
    
    Besides that, flush_cache_page() flushes an application cache page, but
    the kernel has a different page virtual address and dirtied it.
    
    Replace it with flush_dcache_page(new) which is the proper usage.
    
    The old page is flushed in try_to_unmap_one() before migration.
    
    This bug takes place in Sead3 board with M14Kc MIPS CPU without cache
    aliasing (but Harvard arch - separate I and D cache) in tight memory
    environment (128MB) each 1-3days on SOAK test.  It fails in cc1 during
    kernel build (SIGILL, SIGBUS, SIGSEG) if CONFIG_COMPACTION is switched
    ON.

    drivers/leds/leds-ot200.c: fix error caused by shifted mask
    
    commit 4b949b8af12e24b8a48fa5bb775a13b558d9f4da upstream.
    
    During the development of this driver an in-house register documentation
    was used.  The last week some integration tests were done and this
    problem was found.  It turned out that the released register
    documentation is wrong.
    
    The fix is very simple: shift all masks by one.

    ocfs2: goto out_unlock if ocfs2_get_clusters_nocache() failed in ocfs2_fiemap()
    
    commit b4ca2b4b577c3530e34dcfaafccb2cc680ce95d1 upstream.
    
    Last time we found there is lock/unlock bug in ocfs2_file_aio_write, and
    then we did a thorough search for all lock resources in
    ocfs2_inode_info, including rw, inode and open lockres and found this
    bug.  My kernel version is 3.0.13, and it is also in the lastest version
    3.9.  In ocfs2_fiemap, once ocfs2_get_clusters_nocache failed, it should
    goto out_unlock instead of out, because we need release buffer head, up
    read alloc sem and unlock inode.

    commit c2b93e0699723700f886ce17bb65ffd771195a6d upstream.
    
    It's generally not safe to reset the inode ops once they've been set. In
    the case where the inode was originally thought to be a directory and
    then later found to be a DFS referral, this can lead to an oops when we
    try to trigger an inode op on it after changing the ops to the blank
    referral operations.

    USB: UHCI: fix for suspend of virtual HP controller
    
    commit 997ff893603c6455da4c5e26ba1d0f81adfecdfc upstream.
    
    HP's virtual UHCI host controller takes a long time to suspend
    (several hundred microseconds), even when no devices are attached.
    This provokes a warning message from uhci-hcd in the auto-stop case.
    
    To prevent this from happening, this patch adds a test to avoid
    performing an auto-stop when the wait_for_hp quirk flag is set.  The
    controller will still suspend through the normal runtime PM mechanism.
    And since that pathway includes a 1-ms delay, the slowness of the
    virtual hardware won't matter.

    USB: xHCI: override bogus bulk wMaxPacketSize values
    
    commit e4f47e3675e6f1f40906b785b934ce963e9f2eb3 upstream.
    
    This patch shortens the logic in xhci_endpoint_init() by moving common
    calculations involving max_packet and max_burst outside the switch
    statement, rather than repeating the same code in multiple
    case-specific statements.  It also replaces two usages of max_packet
    which were clearly intended to be max_burst all along.
    
    More importantly, it compensates for a common bug in high-speed bulk
    endpoint descriptors.  In many devices there is a bulk endpoint having
    a wMaxPacketSize value smaller than 512, which is forbidden by the USB
    spec.  Some xHCI controllers can't handle this and refuse to accept
    the endpoint.  This patch changes the max_packet value to 512, which
    allows the controller to use the endpoint properly.
    
    In practice the bogus maxpacket size doesn't matter, because none of
    the transfers sent via these endpoints are longer than the maxpacket
    value anyway.

    TTY: Fix tty miss restart after we turn off flow-control
    
    commit dab73b4eb9ef924a2b90dab84e539076d82b256f upstream.
    
    I meet emacs hang in start if I do the operation below:
      1: echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
      2: emacs BigFile
      3: Press CTRL-S follow 2 immediately
    
    Then emacs hang on, CTRL-Q can't resume, the terminal
    hang on, you can do nothing with this terminal except
    close it.
    
    The reason is before emacs takeover control the tty,
    we use CTRL-S to XOFF it. Then when emacs takeover the
    control, it may don't use the flow-control, so emacs hang.
    This patch fix it.
    
    This patch will fix a kind of strange tty relation hang problem,
    I believe I meet it with vim in ssh, and also see below bug report:

    ARM: plat-orion: Fix num_resources and id for ge10 and ge11
    
    commit 2b8b2797142c7951e635c6eec5d1705ee9bc45c5 upstream.
    
    When platform data were moved from arch/arm/mach-mv78xx0/common.c to
    arch/arm/plat-orion/common.c with the commit "7e3819d ARM: orion:
    Consolidate ethernet platform data", there were few typo made on
    gigabit Ethernet interface ge10 and ge11. This commit writes back
    their initial value, which allows to use this interfaces again.
