    KVM: arm64: Fix nVHE hyp panic host context restore
    
    Commit c4b000c3928d4f20acef79dccf3a65ae3795e0b0 upstream.
    
    When panicking from the nVHE hyp and restoring the host context, x29 is
    expected to hold a pointer to the host context. This wasn't being done
    so fix it to make sure there's a valid pointer the host context being
    used.
    
    Rather than passing a boolean indicating whether or not the host context
    should be restored, instead pass the pointer to the host context. NULL
    is passed to indicate that no context should be restored.

    xen/events: avoid handling the same event on two cpus at the same time
    
    commit b6622798bc50b625a1e62f82c7190df40c1f5b21 upstream.
    
    When changing the cpu affinity of an event it can happen today that
    (with some unlucky timing) the same event will be handled on the old
    and the new cpu at the same time.
    
    Avoid that by adding an "event active" flag to the per-event data and
    call the handler only if this flag isn't set.

    xen/events: don't unmask an event channel when an eoi is pending
    
    commit 25da4618af240fbec6112401498301a6f2bc9702 upstream.
    
    An event channel should be kept masked when an eoi is pending for it.
    When being migrated to another cpu it might be unmasked, though.
    
    In order to avoid this keep three different flags for each event channel
    to be able to distinguish "normal" masking/unmasking from eoi related
    masking/unmasking and temporary masking. The event channel should only
    be able to generate an interrupt if all flags are cleared.

    mm/page_alloc.c: refactor initialization of struct page for holes in memory layout
    
    commit 0740a50b9baa4472cfb12442df4b39e2712a64a4 upstream.
    
    There could be struct pages that are not backed by actual physical memory.
    This can happen when the actual memory bank is not a multiple of
    SECTION_SIZE or when an architecture does not register memory holes
    reserved by the firmware as memblock.memory.
    
    Such pages are currently initialized using init_unavailable_mem() function
    that iterates through PFNs in holes in memblock.memory and if there is a
    struct page corresponding to a PFN, the fields of this page are set to
    default values and it is marked as Reserved.
    
    init_unavailable_mem() does not take into account zone and node the page
    belongs to and sets both zone and node links in struct page to zero.
    
    Before commit 73a6e474cb37 ("mm: memmap_init: iterate over memblock
    regions rather that check each PFN") the holes inside a zone were
    re-initialized during memmap_init() and got their zone/node links right.
    However, after that commit nothing updates the struct pages representing
    such holes.
    
    On a system that has firmware reserved holes in a zone above ZONE_DMA, for
    instance in a configuration below:
    
            # grep -A1 E820 /proc/iomem
            7a17b000-7a216fff : Unknown E820 type
            7a217000-7bffffff : System RAM
    
    unset zone link in struct page will trigger
    
            VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!zone_spans_pfn(page_zone(page), pfn), page);
    
    in set_pfnblock_flags_mask() when called with a struct page from a range
    other than E820_TYPE_RAM because there are pages in the range of
    ZONE_DMA32 but the unset zone link in struct page makes them appear as a
    part of ZONE_DMA.
    
    Interleave initialization of the unavailable pages with the normal
    initialization of memory map, so that zone and node information will be
    properly set on struct pages that are not backed by the actual memory.
    
    With this change the pages for holes inside a zone will get proper
    zone/node links and the pages that are not spanned by any node will get
    links to the adjacent zone/node.  The holes between nodes will be
    prepended to the zone/node above the hole and the trailing pages in the
    last section that will be appended to the zone/node below.

    KVM: arm64: Ensure I-cache isolation between vcpus of a same VM
    
    Commit 01dc9262ff5797b675c32c0c6bc682777d23de05 upstream.
    
    It recently became apparent that the ARMv8 architecture has interesting
    rules regarding attributes being used when fetching instructions
    if the MMU is off at Stage-1.
    
    In this situation, the CPU is allowed to fetch from the PoC and
    allocate into the I-cache (unless the memory is mapped with
    the XN attribute at Stage-2).
    
    If we transpose this to vcpus sharing a single physical CPU,
    it is possible for a vcpu running with its MMU off to influence
    another vcpu running with its MMU on, as the latter is expected to
    fetch from the PoU (and self-patching code doesn't flush below that
    level).
    
    In order to solve this, reuse the vcpu-private TLB invalidation
    code to apply the same policy to the I-cache, nuking it every time
    the vcpu runs on a physical CPU that ran another vcpu of the same
    VM in the past.
    
    This involve renaming __kvm_tlb_flush_local_vmid() to
    __kvm_flush_cpu_context(), and inserting a local i-cache invalidation
    there.

    mm/madvise: replace ptrace attach requirement for process_madvise
    
    commit 96cfe2c0fd23ea7c2368d14f769d287e7ae1082e upstream.
    
    process_madvise currently requires ptrace attach capability.
    PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH gives one process complete control over another
    process.  It effectively removes the security boundary between the two
    processes (in one direction).  Granting ptrace attach capability even to a
    system process is considered dangerous since it creates an attack surface.
    This severely limits the usage of this API.
    
    The operations process_madvise can perform do not affect the correctness
    of the operation of the target process; they only affect where the data is
    physically located (and therefore, how fast it can be accessed).  What we
    want is the ability for one process to influence another process in order
    to optimize performance across the entire system while leaving the
    security boundary intact.
    
    Replace PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH with a combination of PTRACE_MODE_READ and
    CAP_SYS_NICE.  PTRACE_MODE_READ to prevent leaking ASLR metadata and
    CAP_SYS_NICE for influencing process performance.

    mm/userfaultfd: fix memory corruption due to writeprotect
    
    commit 6ce64428d62026a10cb5d80138ff2f90cc21d367 upstream.
    
    Userfaultfd self-test fails occasionally, indicating a memory corruption.
    
    Analyzing this problem indicates that there is a real bug since mmap_lock
    is only taken for read in mwriteprotect_range() and defers flushes, and
    since there is insufficient consideration of concurrent deferred TLB
    flushes in wp_page_copy().  Although the PTE is flushed from the TLBs in
    wp_page_copy(), this flush takes place after the copy has already been
    performed, and therefore changes of the page are possible between the time
    of the copy and the time in which the PTE is flushed.
    
    To make matters worse, memory-unprotection using userfaultfd also poses a
    problem.  Although memory unprotection is logically a promotion of PTE
    permissions, and therefore should not require a TLB flush, the current
    userrfaultfd code might actually cause a demotion of the architectural PTE
    permission: when userfaultfd_writeprotect() unprotects memory region, it
    unintentionally *clears* the RW-bit if it was already set.  Note that this
    unprotecting a PTE that is not write-protected is a valid use-case: the
    userfaultfd monitor might ask to unprotect a region that holds both
    write-protected and write-unprotected PTEs.
    
    The scenario that happens in selftests/vm/userfaultfd is as follows:
    
    cpu0                            cpu1                    cpu2

                                    set_pte_at_notify()
    
    This race exists since commit 292924b26024 ("userfaultfd: wp: apply
    _PAGE_UFFD_WP bit").  Yet, as Yu Zhao pointed, these races became apparent
    since commit 09854ba94c6a ("mm: do_wp_page() simplification") which made
    wp_page_copy() more likely to take place, specifically if page_count(page)
    > 1.
    
    To resolve the aforementioned races, check whether there are pending
    flushes on uffd-write-protected VMAs, and if there are, perform a flush
    before doing the COW.
    
    Further optimizations will follow to avoid during uffd-write-unprotect
    unnecassary PTE write-protection and TLB flushes.

    KVM: arm64: Fix exclusive limit for IPA size
    
    commit 262b003d059c6671601a19057e9fe1a5e7f23722 upstream.
    
    When registering a memslot, we check the size and location of that
    memslot against the IPA size to ensure that we can provide guest
    access to the whole of the memory.
    
    Unfortunately, this check rejects memslot that end-up at the exact
    limit of the addressing capability for a given IPA size. For example,
    it refuses the creation of a 2GB memslot at 0x8000000 with a 32bit
    IPA space.
    
    Fix it by relaxing the check to accept a memslot reaching the
    limit of the IPA space.

    KVM: arm64: Reject VM creation when the default IPA size is unsupported
    
    commit 7d717558dd5ef10d28866750d5c24ff892ea3778 upstream.
    
    KVM/arm64 has forever used a 40bit default IPA space, partially
    due to its 32bit heritage (where the only choice is 40bit).
    
    However, there are implementations in the wild that have a *cough*
    much smaller *cough* IPA space, which leads to a misprogramming of
    VTCR_EL2, and a guest that is stuck on its first memory access
    if userspace dares to ask for the default IPA setting (which most
    VMMs do).
    
    Instead, blundly reject the creation of such VM, as we can't
    satisfy the requirements from userspace (with a one-off warning).
    Also clarify the boot warning, and document that the VM creation
    will fail when an unsupported IPA size is provided.
    
    Although this is an ABI change, it doesn't really change much
    for userspace:
    
    - the guest couldn't run before this change, but no error was
      returned. At least userspace knows what is happening.
    
    - a memory slot that was accepted because it did fit the default
      IPA space now doesn't even get a chance to be registered.
    
    The other thing that is left doing is to convince userspace to
    actually use the IPA space setting instead of relying on the
    antiquated default.

    KVM: arm64: nvhe: Save the SPE context early
    
    commit b96b0c5de685df82019e16826a282d53d86d112c upstream.
    
    The nVHE KVM hyp drains and disables the SPE buffer, before
    entering the guest, as the EL1&0 translation regime
    is going to be loaded with that of the guest.
    
    But this operation is performed way too late, because :
      - The owning translation regime of the SPE buffer
        is transferred to EL2. (MDCR_EL2_E2PB == 0)
      - The guest Stage1 is loaded.
    
    Thus the flush could use the host EL1 virtual address,
    but use the EL2 translations instead of host EL1, for writing
    out any cached data.
    
    Fix this by moving the SPE buffer handling early enough.
    The restore path is doing the right thing.

    KVM: arm64: Avoid corrupting vCPU context register in guest exit
    
    commit 31948332d5fa392ad933f4a6a10026850649ed76 upstream.
    
    Commit 7db21530479f ("KVM: arm64: Restore hyp when panicking in guest
    context") tracks the currently running vCPU, clearing the pointer to
    NULL on exit from a guest.
    
    Unfortunately, the use of 'set_loaded_vcpu' clobbers x1 to point at the
    kvm_hyp_ctxt instead of the vCPU context, causing the subsequent RAS
    code to go off into the weeds when it saves the DISR assuming that the
    CPU context is embedded in a struct vCPU.
    
    Leave x1 alone and use x3 as a temporary register instead when clearing
    the vCPU on the guest exit path.

    KVM: arm64: Fix range alignment when walking page tables
    
    commit 357ad203d45c0f9d76a8feadbd5a1c5d460c638b upstream.
    
    When walking the page tables at a given level, and if the start
    address for the range isn't aligned for that level, we propagate
    the misalignment on each iteration at that level.
    
    This results in the walker ignoring a number of entries (depending
    on the original misalignment) on each subsequent iteration.
    
    Properly aligning the address before the next iteration addresses
    this issue.

    When posting a deadline timer interrupt, open code the checks guarding
    __kvm_wait_lapic_expire() in order to skip the lapic_timer_int_injected()
    check in kvm_wait_lapic_expire().  The injection check will always fail
    since the interrupt has not yet be injected.  Moving the call after
    injection would also be wrong as that wouldn't actually delay delivery
    of the IRQ if it is indeed sent via posted interrupt.

    commit 5d5675df792ff67e74a500c4c94db0f99e6a10ef upstream.
    
    On a 32-bit fast syscall that fails to read its arguments from user

        ...
        strace: pid 264258: entering, ptrace_syscall_info.op == 2
        ...
    
    This is a minimal fix intended for ease of backporting.  A more
    complete cleanup is coming.

    x86/unwind/orc: Disable KASAN checking in the ORC unwinder, part 2
    
    commit e504e74cc3a2c092b05577ce3e8e013fae7d94e6 upstream.
    
    KASAN reserves "redzone" areas between stack frames in order to detect
    stack overruns.  A read or write to such an area triggers a KASAN
    "stack-out-of-bounds" BUG.
    
    Normally, the ORC unwinder stays in-bounds and doesn't access the
    redzone.  But sometimes it can't find ORC metadata for a given
    instruction.  This can happen for code which is missing ORC metadata, or
    for generated code.  In such cases, the unwinder attempts to fall back
    to frame pointers, as a best-effort type thing.
    
    This fallback often works, but when it doesn't, the unwinder can get
    confused and go off into the weeds into the KASAN redzone, triggering
    the aforementioned KASAN BUG.
    
    But in this case, the unwinder's confusion is actually harmless and
    working as designed.  It already has checks in place to prevent
    off-stack accesses, but those checks get short-circuited by the KASAN
    BUG.  And a BUG is a lot more disruptive than a harmless unwinder
    warning.
    
    Disable the KASAN checks by using READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() for all stack
    accesses.  This finishes the job started by commit 881125bfe65b
    ("x86/unwind: Disable KASAN checking in the ORC unwinder"), which only
    partially fixed the issue.

    binfmt_misc: fix possible deadlock in bm_register_write
    
    commit e7850f4d844e0acfac7e570af611d89deade3146 upstream.
    
    There is a deadlock in bm_register_write:
    
    First, in the begining of the function, a lock is taken on the binfmt_misc
    root inode with inode_lock(d_inode(root)).
    
    Then, if the user used the MISC_FMT_OPEN_FILE flag, the function will call
    open_exec on the user-provided interpreter.
    
    open_exec will call a path lookup, and if the path lookup process includes
    the root of binfmt_misc, it will try to take a shared lock on its inode
    again, but it is already locked, and the code will get stuck in a deadlock

    $ echo ":iiiii:E::ii::/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/bla:F" > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

    powerpc: Fix missing declaration of [en/dis]able_kernel_vsx()
    
    commit bd73758803c2eedc037c2268b65a19542a832594 upstream.
    
    Add stub instances of enable_kernel_vsx() and disable_kernel_vsx()
    when CONFIG_VSX is not set, to avoid following build failure.

    This works because the caller is checking if VSX is available using
    cpu_has_feature():
    
      #define DC_FP_START() { \
            if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_VSX_COMP)) { \
                    preempt_disable(); \
                    enable_kernel_vsx(); \
            } else if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_ALTIVEC_COMP)) { \
                    preempt_disable(); \
                    enable_kernel_altivec(); \
            } else if (!cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_FPU_UNAVAILABLE)) { \
                    preempt_disable(); \
                    enable_kernel_fp(); \
            } \
    
    When CONFIG_VSX is not selected, cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_VSX_COMP)
    constant folds to 'false' so the call to enable_kernel_vsx() is
    discarded and the build succeeds.

    commit 73ac79881804eed2e9d76ecdd1018037f8510cb1 upstream.
    
    This bit operation was inverted and set the low bit rather than
    cleared it, breaking the ability to ptrace non-volatile GPRs after
    exec. Fix.

    efi: stub: omit SetVirtualAddressMap() if marked unsupported in RT_PROP table
    
    commit 9e9888a0fe97b9501a40f717225d2bef7100a2c1 upstream.
    
    The EFI_RT_PROPERTIES_TABLE contains a mask of runtime services that are
    available after ExitBootServices(). This mostly does not concern the EFI
    stub at all, given that it runs before that. However, there is one call
    that is made at runtime, which is the call to SetVirtualAddressMap()
    (which is not even callable at boot time to begin with)
    
    So add the missing handling of the RT_PROP table to ensure that we only
    call SetVirtualAddressMap() if it is not being advertised as unsupported
    by the firmware.

    commit ce29ddc47b91f97e7f69a0fb7cbb5845f52a9825 upstream.
    
    The function sync_runqueues_membarrier_state() should copy the
    membarrier state from the @mm received as parameter to each runqueue
    currently running tasks using that mm.
    
    However, the use of smp_call_function_many() skips the current runqueue,
    which is unintended. Replace by a call to on_each_cpu_mask().

    linux/compiler-clang.h: define HAVE_BUILTIN_BSWAP*
    
    commit 97e4910232fa1f81e806aa60c25a0450276d99a2 upstream.
    
    Separating compiler-clang.h from compiler-gcc.h inadventently dropped the
    definitions of the three HAVE_BUILTIN_BSWAP macros, which requires falling
    back to the open-coded version and hoping that the compiler detects it.
    
    Since all versions of clang support the __builtin_bswap interfaces, add
    back the flags and have the headers pick these up automatically.
    
    This results in a 4% improvement of compilation speed for arm defconfig.
    
    Note: it might also be worth revisiting which architectures set
    CONFIG_ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP for one compiler or the other, today this is
    set on six architectures (arm32, csky, mips, powerpc, s390, x86), while
    another ten architectures define custom helpers (alpha, arc, ia64, m68k,
    mips, nios2, parisc, sh, sparc, xtensa), and the rest (arm64, h8300,
    hexagon, microblaze, nds32, openrisc, riscv) just get the unoptimized
    version and rely on the compiler to detect it.
    
    A long time ago, the compiler builtins were architecture specific, but
    nowadays, all compilers that are able to build the kernel have correct
    implementations of them, though some may not be as optimized as the inline
    asm versions.
    
    The patch that dropped the optimization landed in v4.19, so as discussed
    it would be fairly safe to backport this revert to stable kernels to the
    4.19/5.4/5.10 stable kernels, but there is a remaining risk for
    regressions, and it has no known side-effects besides compile speed.

    zram: fix return value on writeback_store
    
    commit 57e0076e6575a7b7cef620a0bd2ee2549ef77818 upstream.
    
    writeback_store's return value is overwritten by submit_bio_wait's return
    value.  Thus, writeback_store will return zero since there was no IO
    error.  In the end, write syscall from userspace will see the zero as
    return value, which could make the process stall to keep trying the write
    until it will succeed.

    Fix a sparse warning by using rcu_dereference().  Technically this is a
    bug and a sufficiently aggressive compiler could reload the `real_parent'
    pointer outside the protection of the rcu lock (and access freed memory),
    but I think it's pretty unlikely to happen.

    stop_machine: mark helpers __always_inline
    
    [ Upstream commit cbf78d85079cee662c45749ef4f744d41be85d48 ]
    
    With clang-13, some functions only get partially inlined, with a
    specialized version referring to a global variable.  This triggers a
    harmless build-time check for the intel-rng driver:
    
    WARNING: modpost: drivers/char/hw_random/intel-rng.o(.text+0xe): Section mismatch in reference from the function stop_machine() to the function .init.text:intel_rng_hw_init()
    The function stop_machine() references
    the function __init intel_rng_hw_init().
    This is often because stop_machine lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of intel_rng_hw_init is wrong.
    
    In this instance, an easy workaround is to force the stop_machine()
    function to be inline, along with related interfaces that did not show the
    same behavior at the moment, but theoretically could.
    
    The combination of the two patches listed below triggers the behavior in
    clang-13, but individually these commits are correct.

    hrtimer: Update softirq_expires_next correctly after __hrtimer_get_next_event()
    
    [ Upstream commit 46eb1701c046cc18c032fa68f3c8ccbf24483ee4 ]
    
    hrtimer_force_reprogram() and hrtimer_interrupt() invokes
    __hrtimer_get_next_event() to find the earliest expiry time of hrtimer
    bases. __hrtimer_get_next_event() does not update
    cpu_base::[softirq_]_expires_next to preserve reprogramming logic. That
    needs to be done at the callsites.
    
    hrtimer_force_reprogram() updates cpu_base::softirq_expires_next only when
    the first expiring timer is a softirq timer and the soft interrupt is not
    activated. That's wrong because cpu_base::softirq_expires_next is left
    stale when the first expiring timer of all bases is a timer which expires
    in hard interrupt context. hrtimer_interrupt() does never update
    cpu_base::softirq_expires_next which is wrong too.
    
    That becomes a problem when clock_settime() sets CLOCK_REALTIME forward and
    the first soft expiring timer is in the CLOCK_REALTIME_SOFT base. Setting
    CLOCK_REALTIME forward moves the clock MONOTONIC based expiry time of that
    timer before the stale cpu_base::softirq_expires_next.
    
    cpu_base::softirq_expires_next is cached to make the check for raising the
    soft interrupt fast. In the above case the soft interrupt won't be raised
    until clock monotonic reaches the stale cpu_base::softirq_expires_next
    value. That's incorrect, but what's worse it that if the softirq timer
    becomes the first expiring timer of all clock bases after the hard expiry
    timer has been handled the reprogramming of the clockevent from
    hrtimer_interrupt() will result in an interrupt storm. That happens because
    the reprogramming does not use cpu_base::softirq_expires_next, it uses
    __hrtimer_get_next_event() which returns the actual expiry time. Once clock
    MONOTONIC reaches cpu_base::softirq_expires_next the soft interrupt is
    raised and the storm subsides.
    
    Change the logic in hrtimer_force_reprogram() to evaluate the soft and hard
    bases seperately, update softirq_expires_next and handle the case when a
    soft expiring timer is the first of all bases by comparing the expiry times
    and updating the required cpu base fields. Split this functionality into a
    separate function to be able to use it in hrtimer_interrupt() as well
    without copy paste.

    [ Upstream commit afbef30149587ad46f4780b1e0cc5e219745ce90 ]
    
    To supply a PID/TID for large PEBS, it requires flushing the PEBS buffer
    in a context switch.
    
    For normal LBRs, a context switch can flip the address space and LBR
    entries are not tagged with an identifier, we need to wipe the LBR, even
    for per-cpu events.
    
    For LBR callstack, save/restore the stack is required during a context
    switch.
    
    Set PERF_ATTACH_SCHED_CB for the event with large PEBS & LBR.

    perf/core: Flush PMU internal buffers for per-CPU events
    
    [ Upstream commit a5398bffc01fe044848c5024e5e867e407f239b8 ]
    
    Sometimes the PMU internal buffers have to be flushed for per-CPU events
    during a context switch, e.g., large PEBS. Otherwise, the perf tool may
    report samples in locations that do not belong to the process where the
    samples are processed in, because PEBS does not tag samples with PID/TID.
    
    The current code only flush the buffers for a per-task event. It doesn't
    check a per-CPU event.
    
    Add a new event state flag, PERF_ATTACH_SCHED_CB, to indicate that the
    PMU internal buffers have to be flushed for this event during a context
    switch.
    
    Add sched_cb_entry and perf_sched_cb_usages back to track the PMU/cpuctx
    which is required to be flushed.
    
    Only need to invoke the sched_task() for per-CPU events in this patch.
    The per-task events have been handled in perf_event_context_sched_in/out
    already.

    arm64: mm: use a 48-bit ID map when possible on 52-bit VA builds
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ba8f2b2d652cd8d8a2ab61f4be66973e70f9f88 ]
    
    52-bit VA kernels can run on hardware that is only 48-bit capable, but
    configure the ID map as 52-bit by default. This was not a problem until
    recently, because the special T0SZ value for a 52-bit VA space was never
    programmed into the TCR register anwyay, and because a 52-bit ID map
    happens to use the same number of translation levels as a 48-bit one.
    
    This behavior was changed by commit 1401bef703a4 ("arm64: mm: Always update
    TCR_EL1 from __cpu_set_tcr_t0sz()"), which causes the unsupported T0SZ
    value for a 52-bit VA to be programmed into TCR_EL1. While some hardware
    simply ignores this, Mark reports that Amberwing systems choke on this,
    resulting in a broken boot. But even before that commit, the unsupported
    idmap_t0sz value was exposed to KVM and used to program TCR_EL2 incorrectly
    as well.
    
    Given that we already have to deal with address spaces being either 48-bit
    or 52-bit in size, the cleanest approach seems to be to simply default to
    a 48-bit VA ID map, and only switch to a 52-bit one if the placement of the
    kernel in DRAM requires it. This is guaranteed not to happen unless the
    system is actually 52-bit VA capable.

    configfs: fix a use-after-free in __configfs_open_file
    
    [ Upstream commit 14fbbc8297728e880070f7b077b3301a8c698ef9 ]
    
    Commit b0841eefd969 ("configfs: provide exclusion between IO and removals")
    uses ->frag_dead to mark the fragment state, thus no bothering with extra
    refcount on config_item when opening a file. The configfs_get_config_item
    was removed in __configfs_open_file, but not with config_item_put. So the
    refcount on config_item will lost its balance, causing use-after-free
    issues in some occasions like this:
    
    Test:
    1. Mount configfs on /config with read-only items:
    drwxrwx--- 289 root   root            0 2021-04-01 11:55 /config
    drwxr-xr-x   2 root   root            0 2021-04-01 11:54 /config/a
    --w--w--w-   1 root   root         4096 2021-04-01 11:53 /config/a/1.txt
    ......
    
    2. Then run:
    for file in /config
    do
    echo $file
    grep -R 'key' $file
    done
    
    3. __configfs_open_file will be called in parallel, the first one
    got called will do:
    if (file->f_mode & FMODE_READ) {
            if (!(inode->i_mode & S_IRUGO))
                    goto out_put_module;
                            config_item_put(buffer->item);
                                    kref_put()
                                            package_details_release()
                                                    kfree()
    
    the other one will run into use-after-free issues like this:

    nvme-fc: fix racing controller reset and create association
    
    [ Upstream commit f20ef34d71abc1fc56b322aaa251f90f94320140 ]
    
    Recent patch to prevent calling __nvme_fc_abort_outstanding_ios in
    interrupt context results in a possible race condition. A controller
    reset results in errored io completions, which schedules error
    work. The change of error work to a work element allows it to fire
    after the ctrl state transition to NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING, causing
    any outstanding io (used to initialize the controller) to fail and
    cause problems for connect_work.
    
    Add a state check to only schedule error work if not in the RESETTING
    state.

    Furthermore, if this is a negative dentry, and we haven't actually done
    a new lookup, then we have no reason yet to believe the directory has

    invalidation altogether when called from

    [ Upstream commit eeb0753ba27b26f609e61f9950b14f1b934fe429 ]
    
    pfn_valid() validates a pfn but basically it checks for a valid struct page
    backing for that pfn. It should always return positive for memory ranges
    backed with struct page mapping. But currently pfn_valid() fails for all
    ZONE_DEVICE based memory types even though they have struct page mapping.
    
    pfn_valid() asserts that there is a memblock entry for a given pfn without
    MEMBLOCK_NOMAP flag being set. The problem with ZONE_DEVICE based memory is
    that they do not have memblock entries. Hence memblock_is_map_memory() will
    invariably fail via memblock_search() for a ZONE_DEVICE based address. This
    eventually fails pfn_valid() which is wrong. memblock_is_map_memory() needs
    to be skipped for such memory ranges. As ZONE_DEVICE memory gets hotplugged
    into the system via memremap_pages() called from a driver, their respective
    memory sections will not have SECTION_IS_EARLY set.
    
    Normal hotplug memory will never have MEMBLOCK_NOMAP set in their memblock
    regions. Because the flag MEMBLOCK_NOMAP was specifically designed and set
    for firmware reserved memory regions. memblock_is_map_memory() can just be
    skipped as its always going to be positive and that will be an optimization
    for the normal hotplug memory. Like ZONE_DEVICE based memory, all normal
    hotplugged memory too will not have SECTION_IS_EARLY set for their sections
    
    Skipping memblock_is_map_memory() for all non early memory sections would
    fix pfn_valid() problem for ZONE_DEVICE based memory and also improve its
    performance for normal hotplug memory as well.

    According  to  the RZ/A1H Group, RZ/A1M Group User's Manual: Hardware,
    Rev. 4.00, the TRSCER register has bit 9 reserved, hence we can't use

    commit d660f4f42ccea50262c6ee90c8e7ad19a69fb225 upstream.
    
    The memdup_user() function does not necessarily return a NUL terminated
    string so this can lead to a read overflow.  Switch from memdup_user()
    to strndup_user() to fix this bug.

    commit 2334de198fed3da72e9785ecdd691d101aa96e77 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit fce3c5c1a2d9cd888f2987662ce17c0c651916b2.
    
    FIFO is triggered 4 intervals after receiving a byte, it's good
    when we don't care about the time of reception, but are only
    interested in the presence of any activity on the line.
    Unfortunately, this method is not suitable for all tasks,
    for example, the RS-485 protocol will not work properly,
    since the state machine must track the request-response time
    and after the timeout expires, a decision is made that the device
    on the line is not responding.

    usbip: fix vudc usbip_sockfd_store races leading to gpf
    
    commit 46613c9dfa964c0c60b5385dbdf5aaa18be52a9c upstream.
    
    usbip_sockfd_store() is invoked when user requests attach (import)
    detach (unimport) usb gadget device from usbip host. vhci_hcd sends
    import request and usbip_sockfd_store() exports the device if it is
    free for export.
    
    Export and unexport are governed by local state and shared state
    - Shared state (usbip device status, sockfd) - sockfd and Device
      status are used to determine if stub should be brought up or shut
      down. Device status is shared between host and client.
    - Local state (tcp_socket, rx and tx thread task_struct ptrs)
      A valid tcp_socket controls rx and tx thread operations while the
      device is in exported state.
    - While the device is exported, device status is marked used and socket,
      sockfd, and thread pointers are valid.
    
    Export sequence (stub-up) includes validating the socket and creating
    receive (rx) and transmit (tx) threads to talk to the client to provide
    access to the exported device. rx and tx threads depends on local and
    shared state to be correct and in sync.
    
    Unexport (stub-down) sequence shuts the socket down and stops the rx and
    tx threads. Stub-down sequence relies on local and shared states to be
    in sync.
    
    There are races in updating the local and shared status in the current
    stub-up sequence resulting in crashes. These stem from starting rx and
    tx threads before local and global state is updated correctly to be in
    sync.
    
    1. Doesn't handle kthread_create() error and saves invalid ptr in local
       state that drives rx and tx threads.
    2. Updates tcp_socket and sockfd,  starts stub_rx and stub_tx threads
       before updating usbip_device status to SDEV_ST_USED. This opens up a
       race condition between the threads and usbip_sockfd_store() stub up
       and down handling.
    
    Fix the above problems:
    - Stop using kthread_get_run() macro to create/start threads.
    - Create threads and get task struct reference.
    - Add kthread_create() failure handling and bail out.
    - Hold usbip_device lock to update local and shared states after
      creating rx and tx threads.
    - Update usbip_device status to SDEV_ST_USED.
    - Update usbip_device tcp_socket, sockfd, tcp_rx, and tcp_tx
    - Start threads after usbip_device (tcp_socket, sockfd, tcp_rx, tcp_tx,
      and status) is complete.
    
    Credit goes to syzbot and Tetsuo Handa for finding and root-causing the
    kthread_get_run() improper error handling problem and others. This is a
    hard problem to find and debug since the races aren't seen in a normal
    case. Fuzzing forces the race window to be small enough for the
    kthread_get_run() error path bug and starting threads before updating the
    local and shared state bug in the stub-up sequence.

    USB: serial: ch341: add new Product ID
    
    commit 5563b3b6420362c8a1f468ca04afe6d5f0a8d0a3 upstream.
    
    Add PID for CH340 that's found on cheap programmers.
    
    The driver works flawlessly as soon as the new PID (0x9986) is added to it.
    These look like ANU232MI but ship with a ch341 inside. They have no special
    identifiers (mine only has the string "DB9D20130716" printed on the PCB and
    nothing identifiable on the packaging. The merchant i bought it from
    doesn't sell these anymore).

    xhci: Fix repeated xhci wake after suspend due to uncleared internal wake state
    
    commit d26c00e7276fc92b18c253d69e872f6b03832bad upstream.
    
    If port terminations are detected in suspend, but link never reaches U0
    then xHCI may have an internal uncleared wake state that will cause an
    immediate wake after suspend.
    
    This wake state is normally cleared when driver clears the PORT_CSC bit,
    which is set after a device is enabled and in U0.
    
    Write 1 to clear PORT_CSC for ports that don't have anything connected
    when suspending. This makes sure any pending internal wake states in
    xHCI are cleared.

    usb: xhci: Fix ASMedia ASM1042A and ASM3242 DMA addressing
    
    commit b71c669ad8390dd1c866298319ff89fe68b45653 upstream.
    
    I've confirmed that both the ASMedia ASM1042A and ASM3242 have the same
    problem as the ASM1142 and ASM2142/ASM3142, where they lose some of the
    upper bits of 64-bit DMA addresses. As with the other chips, this can
    cause problems on systems where the upper bits matter, and adding the
    XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT quirk completely fixes the issue.

    xhci: Improve detection of device initiated wake signal.
    
    commit 253f588c70f66184b1f3a9bbb428b49bbda73e80 upstream.
    
    A xHC USB 3 port might miss the first wake signal from a USB 3 device
    if the port LFPS reveiver isn't enabled fast enough after xHC resume.
    
    xHC host will anyway be resumed by a PME# signal, but will go back to
    suspend if no port activity is seen.
    The device resends the U3 LFPS wake signal after a 100ms delay, but
    by then host is already suspended, starting all over from the
    beginning of this issue.
    
    USB 3 specs say U3 wake LFPS signal is sent for max 10ms, then device
    needs to delay 100ms before resending the wake.
    
    Don't suspend immediately if port activity isn't detected in resume.
    Instead add a retry. If there is no port activity then delay for 120ms,
    and re-check for port activity.

    usb: xhci: do not perform Soft Retry for some xHCI hosts
    
    commit a4a251f8c23518899d2078c320cf9ce2fa459c9f upstream.
    
    On some systems rt2800usb and mt7601u devices are unable to operate since
    commit f8f80be501aa ("xhci: Use soft retry to recover faster from
    transaction errors")
    
    Seems that some xHCI controllers can not perform Soft Retry correctly,
    affecting those devices.
    
    To avoid the problem add xhci->quirks flag that restore pre soft retry
    xhci behaviour for affected xHCI controllers. Currently those are
    AMD_PROMONTORYA_4 and AMD_PROMONTORYA_2, since it was confirmed
    by the users: on those xHCI hosts issue happen and is gone after
    disabling Soft Retry.

    usb: renesas_usbhs: Clear PIPECFG for re-enabling pipe with other EPNUM
    
    commit b1d25e6ee57c2605845595b6c61340d734253eb3 upstream.
    
    According to the datasheet, this controller has a restriction
    which "set an endpoint number so that combinations of the DIR bit and
    the EPNUM bits do not overlap.". However, since the udc core driver is
    possible to assign a bulk pipe as an interrupt endpoint, an endpoint
    number may not match the pipe number. After that, when user rebinds
    another gadget driver, this driver broke the restriction because
    the driver didn't clear any configuration in usb_ep_disable().
    
    Example:
     # modprobe g_ncm
     Then, EP3 = pipe 3, EP4 = pipe 4, EP5 = pipe 6
     # rmmod g_ncm
     # modprobe g_hid
     Then, EP3 = pipe 6, EP4 = pipe 7.
     So, pipe 3 and pipe 6 are set as EP3.
    
    So, clear PIPECFG register in usbhs_pipe_free().

    USB: usblp: fix a hang in poll() if disconnected
    
    commit 9de2c43acf37a17dc4c69ff78bb099b80fb74325 upstream.
    
    Apparently an application that opens a device and calls select()
    on it, will hang if the decice is disconnected. It's a little
    surprising that we had this bug for 15 years, but apparently
    nobody ever uses select() with a printer: only write() and read(),
    and those work fine. Well, you can also select() with a timeout.
    
    The fix is modeled after devio.c. A few other drivers check the
    condition first, then do not add the wait queue in case the
    device is disconnected. We doubt that's completely race-free.
    So, this patch adds the process first, then locks properly
    and checks for the disconnect.

    slot.
    
    Previous endpoint max_packet_size calculation code
    was adding sometimes +1 audio slot due to DIV_ROUND_UP
    behaviour which was rounding up to closest integer.
    However this doesn't work if the numbers are divisible.
    
    It had no any impact with Linux hosts which ignore
    this issue, but in case of more strict Windows it
    caused rejected enumeration
    
    Thus always add +1 audio slot to endpoint's max packet size

    Goodix Fingerprint device is not a modem
    
    commit 4d8654e81db7346f915eca9f1aff18f385cab621 upstream.
    
    The CDC ACM driver is false matching the Goodix Fingerprint device
    against the USB_CDC_ACM_PROTO_AT_V25TER.
    
    The Goodix Fingerprint device is a biometrics sensor that should be
    handled in user-space. libfprint has some support for Goodix
    fingerprint sensors, although not for this particular one. It is
    possible that the vendor allocates a PID per OEM (Lenovo, Dell etc).
    If this happens to be the case then more devices from the same vendor
    could potentially match the ACM modem module table.

    cifs: do not send close in compound create+close requests
    
    commit 04ad69c342fc4de5bd23be9ef15ea7574fb1a87e upstream.
    
    In case of interrupted syscalls, prevent sending CLOSE commands for
    compound CREATE+CLOSE requests by introducing an
    CIFS_CP_CREATE_CLOSE_OP flag to indicate lower layers that it should
    not send a CLOSE command to the MIDs corresponding the compound
    CREATE+CLOSE request.
    
    A simple reproducer:
    
        #!/bin/bash
    
        mount //server/share /mnt -o username=foo,password=***

    mmc: mmci: Add MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY for the stm32 variants
    
    commit 774514bf977377c9137640a0310bd64eed0f7323 upstream.
    
    An issue has been observed on STM32MP157C-EV1 board, with an erase command
    with secure erase argument, ending up waiting for ~4 hours before timeout.
    
    The requested busy timeout from the mmc core ends up with 14784000ms (~4
    hours), but the supported host->max_busy_timeout is 86767ms, which leads to
    that the core switch to use an R1 response in favor of the R1B and polls
    for busy with the host->card_busy() ops. In this case the polling doesn't
    work as expected, as we never detects that the card stops signaling busy,
    which leads to the following message:
    
     mmc1: Card stuck being busy! __mmc_poll_for_busy
    
    The problem boils done to that the stm32 variants can't use R1 responses in
    favor of R1B responses, as it leads to an internal state machine in the
    controller to get stuck. To continue to process requests, it would need to
    be reset.
    
    To fix this problem, let's set MMC_CAP_NEED_RSP_BUSY for the stm32 variant,
    which prevent the mmc core from switching to R1 responses. Additionally,
    let's cap the cmd->busy_timeout to the host->max_busy_timeout, thus rely on
    86767ms to be sufficient (~66 seconds was need for this test case).

    xen/events: reset affinity of 2-level event when tearing it down
    
    commit 9e77d96b8e2724ed00380189f7b0ded61113b39f upstream.
    
    When creating a new event channel with 2-level events the affinity
    needs to be reset initially in order to avoid using an old affinity
    from earlier usage of the event channel port. So when tearing an event
    channel down reset all affinity bits.
    
    The same applies to the affinity when onlining a vcpu: all old
    affinity settings for this vcpu must be reset. As percpu events get
    initialized before the percpu event channel hook is called,
    resetting of the affinities happens after offlining a vcpu (this is
    working, as initial percpu memory is zeroed out).

    s390/dasd: fix hanging IO request during DASD driver unbind
    
    commit 66f669a272898feb1c69b770e1504aa2ec7723d1 upstream.
    
    Prevent that an IO request is build during device shutdown initiated by
    a driver unbind. This request will never be able to be processed or
    canceled and will hang forever. This will lead also to a hanging unbind.
    
    Fix by checking not only if the device is in READY state but also check
    that there is no device offline initiated before building a new IO request.

    s390/dasd: fix hanging DASD driver unbind
    
    commit 7d365bd0bff3c0310c39ebaffc9a8458e036d666 upstream.
    
    In case of an unbind of the DASD device driver the function
    dasd_generic_remove() is called which shuts down the device.
    Among others this functions removes the int_handler from the cdev.
    During shutdown the device cancels all outstanding IO requests and waits
    for completion of the clear request.
    Unfortunately the clear interrupt will never be received when there is no
    interrupt handler connected.
    
    Fix by moving the int_handler removal after the call to the state machine
    where no request or interrupt is outstanding.

    commit 7bb8bc6eb550116c504fb25af8678b9d7ca2abc5 upstream.
    
    Commit 0fdf1bb75953 ("arm64: perf: Avoid PMXEV* indirection") changed
    armv8pmu_read_evcntr() to return a u32 instead of u64. The result is
    silent truncation of the event counter when using 64-bit counters. Given
    the offending commit appears to have passed thru several folks, it seems
    likely this was a bad rebase after v8.5 PMU 64-bit counters landed.

    arm64: mte: Map hotplugged memory as Normal Tagged
    
    commit d15dfd31384ba3cb93150e5f87661a76fa419f74 upstream.
    
    In a system supporting MTE, the linear map must allow reading/writing
    allocation tags by setting the memory type as Normal Tagged. Currently,
    this is only handled for memory present at boot. Hotplugged memory uses
    Normal non-Tagged memory.
    
    Introduce pgprot_mhp() for hotplugged memory and use it in
    add_memory_resource(). The arm64 code maps pgprot_mhp() to
    pgprot_tagged().
    
    Note that ZONE_DEVICE memory should not be mapped as Tagged and
    therefore setting the memory type in arch_add_memory() is not feasible.

    arm64: kasan: fix page_alloc tagging with DEBUG_VIRTUAL
    
    commit 86c83365ab76e4b43cedd3ce07a07d32a4dc79ba upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL is enabled, the default page_to_virt() macro
    implementation from include/linux/mm.h is used. That definition doesn't
    account for KASAN tags, which leads to no tags on page_alloc allocations.
    
    Provide an arm64-specific definition for page_to_virt() when
    CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL is enabled that takes care of KASAN tags.

    block: Try to handle busy underlying device on discard
    
    commit 56887cffe946bb0a90c74429fa94d6110a73119d upstream.
    
    Commit 384d87ef2c95 ("block: Do not discard buffers under a mounted
    filesystem") made paths issuing discard or zeroout requests to the
    underlying device try to grab block device in exclusive mode. If that
    failed we returned EBUSY to userspace. This however caused unexpected
    fallout in userspace where e.g. FUSE filesystems issue discard requests
    from userspace daemons although the device is open exclusively by the
    kernel. Also shrinking of logical volume by LVM issues discard requests
    to a device which may be claimed exclusively because there's another LV
    on the same PV. So to avoid these userspace regressions, fall back to
    invalidate_inode_pages2_range() instead of returning EBUSY to userspace
    and return EBUSY only of that call fails as well (meaning that there's
    indeed someone using the particular device range we are trying to
    discard).

    block: Discard page cache of zone reset target range
    
    commit e5113505904ea1c1c0e1f92c1cfa91fbf4da1694 upstream.
    
    When zone reset ioctl and data read race for a same zone on zoned block
    devices, the data read leaves stale page cache even though the zone
    reset ioctl zero clears all the zone data on the device. To avoid
    non-zero data read from the stale page cache after zone reset, discard
    page cache of reset target zones in blkdev_zone_mgmt_ioctl(). Introduce
    the helper function blkdev_truncate_zone_range() to discard the page
    cache. Ensure the page cache discarded by calling the helper function
    before and after zone reset in same manner as fallocate does.
    
    This patch can be applied back to the stable kernel version v5.10.y.
    Rework is needed for older stable kernels.

    I overlooked the issue because when I was working on the said commit,
    only the front audio is tested. Apology for that.
    
    Changing supports_autosuspend in driver is too late for disabling
    autosuspend, because it was already used by USB probe routine, so it can
    break the balance on the following code that depends on
    supports_autosuspend.
    
    Fix it by using usb_disable_autosuspend() helper, and balance the
    suspend count in disconnect callback.

    commit 06abcb18b3a021ba1a3f2020cbefb3ed04e59e72 upstream.
    
    Other Plantronics headset models seem requiring the same workaround as
    C320-M to add the 20ms delay for the control messages, too.  Apply the
    workaround generically for devices with the vendor ID 0x047f.
    
    Note that the problem didn't surface before 5.11 just with luck.
    Since 5.11 got a big code rewrite about the stream handling, the
    parameter setup procedure has changed, and this seemed triggering the
    problem more often.

    ALSA: hda: Avoid spurious unsol event handling during S3/S4
    
    commit 5ff9dde42e8c72ed8102eb8cb62e03f9dc2103ab upstream.
    
    When HD-audio bus receives unsolicited events during its system
    suspend/resume (S3 and S4) phase, the controller driver may still try
    to process events although the codec chips are already (or yet)
    powered down.  This might screw up the codec communication, resulting
    in CORB/RIRB errors.  Such events should be rather skipped, as the
    codec chip status such as the jack status will be fully refreshed at
    the system resume time.
    
    Since we're tracking the system suspend/resume state in codec
    power.power_state field, let's add the check in the common unsol event
    handler entry point to filter out such events.

    ALSA: hda: Flush pending unsolicited events before suspend
    
    commit 13661fc48461282e43fe8f76bf5bf449b3d40687 upstream.
    
    The HD-audio controller driver processes the unsolicited events via
    its work asynchronously, and this might be pending when the system
    goes to suspend.  When a lengthy event handling like ELD byte reads is
    running, this might trigger unexpected accesses among suspend/resume
    procedure, typically seen with Nvidia driver that still requires the
    handling via unsolicited event verbs for ELD updates.
    
    This patch adds the flush of unsol_work to assure that pending events
    are processed before going into suspend.

    ALSA: hda: Drop the BATCH workaround for AMD controllers
    
    commit 28e96c1693ec1cdc963807611f8b5ad400431e82 upstream.
    
    The commit c02f77d32d2c ("ALSA: hda - Workaround for crackled sound on
    AMD controller (1022:1457)") introduced a few workarounds for the
    recent AMD HD-audio controller, and one of them is the forced BATCH
    PCM mode so that PulseAudio avoids the timer-based scheduling.  This
    was thought to cover for some badly working applications, but this
    actually worsens for more others.  In total, this wasn't a good idea
    to enforce it.
    
    This is a partial revert of the commit above for dropping the PCM
    BATCH enforcement part to recover from the regression again.
    
    Fixes: c02f77d32d2c ("ALSA: hda - Workaround for crackled sound on AMD controller (1022:1457)")

    ALSA: hda/conexant: Add quirk for mute LED control on HP ZBook G5

    The mute and mic-mute LEDs on HP ZBook Studio G5 are controlled via
    GPIO bits 0x10 and 0x20, respectively, and we need the extra setup for
    those.
    
    As the similar code is already present for other HP models but with
    different GPIO pins, this patch factors out the common helper code and
    applies those GPIO values for each model.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi: Cancel pending works before suspend
    
    commit eea46a0879bcca23e15071f9968c0f6e6596e470 upstream.
    
    The per_pin->work might be still floating at the suspend, and this may
    hit the access to the hardware at an unexpected timing.  Cancel the
    work properly at the suspend callback for avoiding the buggy access.
    
    Note that the bug doesn't trigger easily in the recent kernels since
    the work is queued only when the repoll count is set, and usually it's
    only at the resume callback, but it's still possible to hit in
    theory.

    ARM: efistub: replace adrl pseudo-op with adr_l macro invocation
    
    commit 67e3f828bd4bf5e4eb4214dc4eb227d8f1c8a877 upstream.
    
    The ARM 'adrl' pseudo instruction is a bit problematic, as it does not
    exist in Thumb mode, and it is not implemented by Clang either. Since
    the Thumb variant has a slightly bigger range, it is sometimes necessary
    to emit the 'adrl' variant in ARM mode where Thumb mode can use adr just
    fine. However, that still leaves the Clang issue, which does not appear
    to be supporting this any time soon.
    
    So let's switch to the adr_l macro, which works for both ARM and Thumb,
    and has unlimited range.

    ARM: assembler: introduce adr_l, ldr_l and str_l macros
    
    commit 0b1674638a5c69cbace63278625c199100955490 upstream.
    
    Like arm64, ARM supports position independent code sequences that
    produce symbol references with a greater reach than the ordinary
    adr/ldr instructions. Since on ARM, the adrl pseudo-instruction is
    only supported in ARM mode (and not at all when using Clang), having
    a adr_l macro like we do on arm64 is useful, and increases symmetry
    as well.
    
    Currently, we use open coded instruction sequences involving literals
    and arithmetic operations. Instead, we can use movw/movt pairs on v7
    CPUs, circumventing the D-cache entirely.
    
    E.g., on v7+ CPUs, we can emit a PC-relative reference as follows:
    
           movw         <reg>, #:lower16:<sym> - (1f + 8)
           movt         <reg>, #:upper16:<sym> - (1f + 8)
      1:   add          <reg>, <reg>, pc
    
    For older CPUs, we can emit the literal into a subsection, allowing it
    to be emitted out of line while retaining the ability to perform
    arithmetic on label offsets.
    
    E.g., on pre-v7 CPUs, we can emit a PC-relative reference as follows:
    
           ldr          <reg>, 2f
      1:   add          <reg>, <reg>, pc
           .subsection  1
      2:   .long        <sym> - (1b + 8)
           .previous
    
    This is allowed by the assembler because, unlike ordinary sections,
    subsections are combined into a single section in the object file, and
    so the label references are not true cross-section references that are
    visible as relocations. (Subsections have been available in binutils
    since 2004 at least, so they should not cause any issues with older
    toolchains.)
    
    So use the above to implement the macros mov_l, adr_l, ldr_l and str_l,
    all of which will use movw/movt pairs on v7 and later CPUs, and use
    PC-relative literals otherwise.

    commit 3c9f5708b7aed6a963e2aefccbd1854802de163e upstream.
    
    This patch replaces 6 IWMMXT instructions Clang's integrated assembler
    does not support in iwmmxt.S using macros, while making sure GNU
    assembler still emit the same instructions. This should be easier than
    providing full IWMMXT support in Clang.  This is one of the last bits of
    kernel code that could be compiled but not assembled with clang. Once
    all of it works with IAS, we no longer need to special-case 32-bit Arm
    in Kbuild, or turn off CONFIG_IWMMXT when build-testing.
    
    "Intel Wireless MMX Technology - Developer Guide - August, 2002" should
    be referenced for the encoding schemes of these extensions.

    The GPU GX GDSC has GPU_GX_BCR reset and gfx3d_clk CXC, as stated
    on downstream kernels (and as verified upstream, because otherwise
    random lockups happen).
    Also, add PWRSTS_RET and NO_RET_PERIPH: also as found downstream,
    and also as verified here, to avoid GPU related lockups it is
    necessary to force retain mem, but *not* peripheral when enabling
    this GDSC (and, of course, the inverse on disablement).
    
    With this change, the GPU finally works flawlessly on my four
    different MSM8998 devices from two different manufacturers.

    drivers/base/memory: don't store phys_device in memory blocks
    
    [ Upstream commit e9a2e48e8704c9d20a625c6f2357147d03ea7b97 ]
    
    No need to store the value for each and every memory block, as we can
    easily query the value at runtime.  Reshuffle the members to optimize the
    memory layout.  Also, let's clarify what the interface once was used for
    and why it's legacy nowadays.
    
    "phys_device" was used on s390x in older versions of lsmem[2]/chmem[3],
    back when they were still part of s390x-tools.  They were later replaced
    by the variants in linux-utils.  For example, RHEL6 and RHEL7 contain
    lsmem/chmem from s390-utils.  RHEL8 switched to versions from util-linux
    on s390x [4].
    
    "phys_device" was added with sysfs support for memory hotplug in commit
    3947be1969a9 ("[PATCH] memory hotplug: sysfs and add/remove functions") in
    2005.  It always returned 0.
    
    s390x started returning something != 0 on some setups (if sclp.rzm is set
    by HW) in 2010 via commit 57b552ba0b2f ("memory hotplug/s390: set
    phys_device").
    
    For s390x, it allowed for identifying which memory block devices belong to
    the same storage increment (RZM).  Only if all memory block devices
    comprising a single storage increment were offline, the memory could
    actually be removed in the hypervisor.
    
    Since commit e5d709bb5fb7 ("s390/memory hotplug: provide
    memory_block_size_bytes() function") in 2013 a memory block device spans
    at least one storage increment - which is why the interface isn't really
    helpful/used anymore (except by old lsmem/chmem tools).
    
    There were once RFC patches to make use of "phys_device" in ACPI context;
    however, the underlying problem could be solved using different interfaces
    [1].

    kasan: fix memory corruption in kasan_bitops_tags test
    
    [ Upstream commit e66e1799a76621003e5b04c9c057826a2152e103 ]
    
    Since the hardware tag-based KASAN mode might not have a redzone that
    comes after an allocated object (when kasan.mode=prod is enabled), the
    kasan_bitops_tags() test ends up corrupting the next object in memory.
    
    Change the test so it always accesses the redzone that lies within the
    allocated object's boundaries.

    kbuild: clamp SUBLEVEL to 255
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b82f13e7ef316cdc0a8858f1349f4defce3f9e0 ]
    
    Right now if SUBLEVEL becomes larger than 255 it will overflow into the
    territory of PATCHLEVEL, causing havoc in userspace that tests for
    specific kernel version.
    
    While userspace code tests for MAJOR and PATCHLEVEL, it doesn't test
    SUBLEVEL at any point as ABI changes don't happen in the context of
    stable tree.
    
    Thus, to avoid overflows, simply clamp SUBLEVEL to it's maximum value in
    the context of LINUX_VERSION_CODE. This does not affect "make
    kernelversion" and such.

    ext4: don't try to processed freed blocks until mballoc is initialized
    
    [ Upstream commit 027f14f5357279655c3ebc6d14daff8368d4f53f ]
    
    If we try to make any changes via the journal between when the journal
    is initialized, but before the multi-block allocated is initialized,
    we will end up deferencing a NULL pointer when the journal commit
    callback function calls ext4_process_freed_data().
    
    The proximate cause of this failure was commit 2d01ddc86606 ("ext4:
    save error info to sb through journal if available") since file system
    corruption problems detected before the call to ext4_mb_init() would
    result in a journal commit before we aborted the mount of the file
    system.... and we would then trigger the NULL pointer deref.

    PCI/LINK: Remove bandwidth notification
    
    [ Upstream commit b4c7d2076b4e767dd2e075a2b3a9e57753fc67f5 ]
    
    The PCIe Bandwidth Change Notification feature logs messages when the link
    bandwidth changes.  Some users have reported that these messages occur
    often enough to significantly reduce NVMe performance.  GPUs also seem to
    generate these messages.
    
    We don't know why the link bandwidth changes, but in the reported cases
    there's no indication that it's caused by hardware failures.
    
    Remove the bandwidth change notifications for now.  Hopefully we can add
    this back when we have a better understanding of why this happens and how
    we can make the messages useful instead of overwhelming.

    PCI: mediatek: Add missing of_node_put() to fix reference leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 42814c438aac79746d310f413a27d5b0b959c5de ]
    
    The for_each_available_child_of_node helper internally makes use of the
    of_get_next_available_child() which performs an of_node_get() on each
    iteration when searching for next available child node.
    
    Should an available child node be found, then it would return a device
    node pointer with reference count incremented, thus early return from
    the middle of the loop requires an explicit of_node_put() to prevent
    reference count leak.
    
    To stop the reference leak, explicitly call of_node_put() before
    returning after an error occurred.

    The response to a command may never arrive or it may be corrupted (and
    hence dropped) for some reason. While exceedingly rare, when it did
    happen it blocked all further commands. One way to fix this was to
    do a suspend/resume. However, recovering automatically seems like a
    nicer option. Hence this puts a time limit (1 sec) on how long we're
    willing to wait for a response, after which we assume it got lost.

    sparc64: Use arch_validate_flags() to validate ADI flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 147d8622f2a26ef34beacc60e1ed8b66c2fa457f ]
    
    When userspace calls mprotect() to enable ADI on an address range,
    do_mprotect_pkey() calls arch_validate_prot() to validate new
    protection flags. arch_validate_prot() for sparc looks at the first
    VMA associated with address range to verify if ADI can indeed be
    enabled on this address range. This has two issues - (1) Address
    range might cover multiple VMAs while arch_validate_prot() looks at
    only the first VMA, (2) arch_validate_prot() peeks at VMA without
    holding mmap lock which can result in race condition.
    
    arch_validate_flags() from commit c462ac288f2c ("mm: Introduce
    arch_validate_flags()") allows for VMA flags to be validated for all
    VMAs that cover the address range given by user while holding mmap
    lock. This patch updates sparc code to move the VMA check from
    arch_validate_prot() to arch_validate_flags() to fix above two
    issues.

    will generate chaos and panics during GPU suspend time (mainly, the

    iommu/amd: Fix performance counter initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit 6778ff5b21bd8e78c8bd547fd66437cf2657fd9b ]
    
    Certain AMD platforms enable power gating feature for IOMMU PMC,
    which prevents the IOMMU driver from updating the counter while
    trying to validate the PMC functionality in the init_iommu_perf_ctr().
    This results in disabling PMC support and the following error message:
    
        "AMD-Vi: Unable to read/write to IOMMU perf counter"
    
    To workaround this issue, disable power gating temporarily by programming
    the counter source to non-zero value while validating the counter,
    and restore the prior state afterward.

    powerpc/64: Fix stack trace not displaying final frame
    
    [ Upstream commit e3de1e291fa58a1ab0f471a4b458eff2514e4b5f ]
    
    In commit bf13718bc57a ("powerpc: show registers when unwinding
    interrupt frames") we changed our stack dumping logic to show the full
    registers whenever we find an interrupt frame on the stack.
    
    However we didn't notice that on 64-bit this doesn't show the final
    frame, ie. the interrupt that brought us in from userspace, whereas on
    32-bit it does.
    
    That is due to confusion about the size of that last frame. The code
    in show_stack() calls validate_sp(), passing it STACK_INT_FRAME_SIZE
    to check the sp is at least that far below the top of the stack.
    
    However on 64-bit that size is too large for the final frame, because

    HID: logitech-dj: add support for the new lightspeed connection iteration
    
    [ Upstream commit fab3a95654eea01d6b0204995be8b7492a00d001 ]
    
    This new connection type is the new iteration of the Lightspeed
    connection and will probably be used in some of the newer gaming
    devices. It is currently use in the G Pro X Superlight.
    
    This patch should be backported to older versions, as currently the
    driver will panic when seing the unsupported connection. This isn't
    an issue when using the receiver that came with the device, as Logitech
    has been using different PIDs when they change the connection type, but
    is an issue when using a generic receiver (well, generic Lightspeed
    receiver), which is the case of the one in the Powerplay mat. Currently,
    the only generic Ligthspeed receiver we support, and the only one that
    exists AFAIK, is ther Powerplay.
    
    As it stands, the driver will panic when seeing a G Pro X Superlight
    connected to the Powerplay receiver and won't send any input events to
    userspace! The kernel will warn about this so the issue should be easy
    to identify, but it is still very worrying how hard it will fail :(

    powerpc/perf: Record counter overflow always if SAMPLE_IP is unset
    
    [ Upstream commit d137845c973147a22622cc76c7b0bc16f6206323 ]
    
    While sampling for marked events, currently we record the sample only
    if the SIAR valid bit of Sampled Instruction Event Register (SIER) is
    set. SIAR_VALID bit is used for fetching the instruction address from
    Sampled Instruction Address Register(SIAR). But there are some
    usecases, where the user is interested only in the PMU stats at each
    counter overflow and the exact IP of the overflow event is not
    required. Dropping SIAR invalid samples will fail to record some of
    the counter overflows in such cases.
    
    Example of such usecase is dumping the PMU stats (event counts) after
    some regular amount of instructions/events from the userspace (ex: via
    ptrace). Here counter overflow is indicated to userspace via signal
    handler, and captured by monitoring and enabling I/O signaling on the
    event file descriptor. In these cases, we expect to get
    sample/overflow indication after each specified sample_period.
    
    Perf event attribute will not have PERF_SAMPLE_IP set in the
    sample_type if exact IP of the overflow event is not requested. So
    while profiling if SAMPLE_IP is not set, just record the counter
    overflow irrespective of SIAR_VALID check.

    powerpc/pci: Add ppc_md.discover_phbs()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5537fcb319d016ce387f818dd774179bc03217f5 ]
    
    On many powerpc platforms the discovery and initalisation of
    pci_controllers (PHBs) happens inside of setup_arch(). This is very early
    in boot (pre-initcalls) and means that we're initialising the PHB long
    before many basic kernel services (slab allocator, debugfs, a real ioremap)
    are available.
    
    On PowerNV this causes an additional problem since we map the PHB registers
    with ioremap(). As of commit d538aadc2718 ("powerpc/ioremap: warn on early
    use of ioremap()") a warning is printed because we're using the "incorrect"
    API to setup and MMIO mapping in searly boot. The kernel does provide
    early_ioremap(), but that is not intended to create long-lived MMIO
    mappings and a seperate warning is printed by generic code if
    early_ioremap() mappings are "leaked."
    
    This is all fixable with dumb hacks like using early_ioremap() to setup
    the initial mapping then replacing it with a real ioremap later on in
    boot, but it does raise the question: Why the hell are we setting up the
    PHB's this early in boot?
    
    The old and wise claim it's due to "hysterical rasins." Aside from amused
    grapes there doesn't appear to be any real reason to maintain the current
    behaviour. Already most of the newer embedded platforms perform PHB
    discovery in an arch_initcall and between the end of setup_arch() and the
    start of initcalls none of the generic kernel code does anything PCI
    related. On powerpc scanning PHBs occurs in a subsys_initcall so it should
    be possible to move the PHB discovery to a core, postcore or arch initcall.
    
    This patch adds the ppc_md.discover_phbs hook and a core_initcall stub that
    calls it. The core_initcalls are the earliest to be called so this will
    any possibly issues with dependency between initcalls. This isn't just an
    academic issue either since on pseries and PowerNV EEH init occurs in an
    arch_initcall and depends on the pci_controllers being available, similarly
    the creation of pci_dns occurs at core_initcall_sync (i.e. between core and
    postcore initcalls). These problems need to be addressed seperately.

    mmc: sdhci-iproc: Add ACPI bindings for the RPi
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f9833d3ec8da34861cd0680b00c73e653877eb9 ]
    
    The RPi4 has an Arasan controller it carries over from the RPi3 and a newer
    eMMC2 controller.  Because of a couple of quirks, it seems wiser to bind
    these controllers to the same driver that DT is using on this platform
    rather than the generic sdhci_acpi driver with PNP0D40.
    
    So, BCM2847 describes the older Arasan and BRCME88C describes the newer
    eMMC2. The older Arasan is reusing an existing ACPI _HID used by other OSes
    booting these tables on the RPi.
    
    With this change, Linux is capable of utilizing the SD card slot, and the
    Wi-Fi when booted with UEFI+ACPI on the RPi4.

    iommu/vt-d: Clear PRQ overflow only when PRQ is empty
    
    [ Upstream commit 28a77185f1cd0650b664f54614143aaaa3a7a615 ]
    
    It is incorrect to always clear PRO when it's set w/o first checking
    whether the overflow condition has been cleared. Current code assumes
    that if an overflow condition occurs it must have been cleared by earlier
    loop. However since the code runs in a threaded context, the overflow
    condition could occur even after setting the head to the tail under some
    extreme condition. To be sane, we should read both head/tail again when
    seeing a pending PRO and only clear PRO after all pending PRs have been
    handled.

    udf: fix silent AED tagLocation corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit 63c9e47a1642fc817654a1bc18a6ec4bbcc0f056 ]
    
    When extending a file, udf_do_extend_file() may enter following empty
    indirect extent. At the end of udf_do_extend_file() we revert prev_epos
    to point to the last written extent. However if we end up not adding any
    further extent in udf_do_extend_file(), the reverting points prev_epos
    into the header area of the AED and following updates of the extents
    (in udf_update_extents()) will corrupt the header.
    
    Make sure that we do not follow indirect extent if we are not going to
    add any more extents so that returning back to the last written extent
    works correctly.

    To avoid the HW race condition on R-Car Gen2 and earlier, we need to
    write to ICMCR as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. We can
    improve this by writing a static value instead of masking out bits.

    ath11k: fix AP mode for QCA6390
    
    [ Upstream commit 77d7e87128d4dfb400df4208b2812160e999c165 ]
    
    Commit c134d1f8c436 ("ath11k: Handle errors if peer creation fails") completely
    broke AP mode on QCA6390:
    
    kernel: [  151.230734] ath11k_pci 0000:06:00.0: failed to create peer after vdev start delay: -22
    wpa_supplicant[2307]: Failed to set beacon parameters
    wpa_supplicant[2307]: Interface initialization failed
    wpa_supplicant[2307]: wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->DISABLED
    wpa_supplicant[2307]: wlan0: AP-DISABLED
    wpa_supplicant[2307]: wlan0: Unable to setup interface.
    wpa_supplicant[2307]: Failed to initialize AP interface
    
    This was because commit c134d1f8c436 ("ath11k: Handle errors if peer creation
    fails") added error handling for ath11k_peer_create(), which had been failing
    all along but was unnoticed due to the missing error handling. The actual bug
    was introduced already in commit aa44b2f3ecd4 ("ath11k: start vdev if a bss peer is
    already created").
    
    ath11k_peer_create() was failing because for AP mode the peer is created
    already earlier op_add_interface() and we should skip creation here, but the
    check for modes was wrong.  Fixing that makes AP mode work again.
    
    This shouldn't affect IPQ8074 nor QCN9074 as they have hw_params.vdev_start_delay disabled.

    [ Upstream commit aa44b2f3ecd41f90b7e477158036648a49d21a32 ]
    
    For QCA6390, bss peer must be created before vdev is to start. This
    change is to start vdev if a bss peer is created. Otherwise, ath11k
    delays to start vdev.
    
    This fixes an issue in a case where HT/VHT/HE settings change between
    authentication and association, e.g., due to the user space request
    to disable HT.

    net: enetc: initialize RFS/RSS memories for unused ports too
    
    [ Upstream commit 3222b5b613db558e9a494bbf53f3c984d90f71ea ]
    
    Michael reports that since linux-next-20210211, the AER messages for ECC
    errors have started reappearing, and this time they can be reliably
    reproduced with the first ping on one of his LS1028A boards.
    
    $ ping 1[   33.258069] pcieport 0000:00:1f.0: AER: Multiple Corrected error received: 0000:00:00.0
    72.16.0.1
    PING [   33.267050] pcieport 0000:00:1f.0: AER: can't find device of ID0000

    $ devmem 0x1f8010e10 32
    0xC0000006
    
    It isn't clear why this is necessary, but it seems that for the errors
    to go away, we must clear the entire RFS and RSS memory, not just for
    the ports in use.
    
    Sadly the code is structured in such a way that we can't have unified
    logic for the used and unused ports. For the minimal initialization of
    an unused port, we need just to enable and ioremap the PF memory space,
    and a control buffer descriptor ring. Unused ports must then free the
    CBDR because the driver will exit, but used ports can not pick up from
    where that code path left, since the CBDR API does not reinitialize a
    ring when setting it up, so its producer and consumer indices are out of
    sync between the software and hardware state. So a separate
    enetc_init_unused_port function was created, and it gets called right
    after the PF memory space is enabled.

    Now that we have a central TX reallocation procedure that accounts for

    skb_cow_head call.
    
    This one is interesting, the DSA tag is 8 bytes on RX and 4 bytes on TX.
    Because DSA is unaware of asymmetrical tag lengths, the overhead/needed
    headroom is declared as 8 bytes and therefore 4 bytes larger than it
    needs to be. If this becomes a problem, and the GSWIP driver can't be
    converted to a uniform header length, we might need to make DSA aware of
    separate RX/TX overhead values.

    Similar to the EtherType DSA tagger, the old Marvell tagger can
    transform an 802.1Q header if present into a DSA tag, so there is no
    headroom required in that case. But we are ensuring that it exists,
    regardless (practically speaking, the headroom must be 4 bytes larger
    than it needs to be).

    Note that the VLAN code path needs a smaller extra headroom than the

    net: dsa: implement a central TX reallocation procedure
    
    [ Upstream commit a3b0b6479700a5b0af2c631cb2ec0fb7a0d978f2 ]
    
    At the moment, taggers are left with the task of ensuring that the skb
    headers are writable (which they aren't, if the frames were cloned for
    TX timestamping, for flooding by the bridge, etc), and that there is
    enough space in the skb data area for the DSA tag to be pushed.
    
    Moreover, the life of tail taggers is even harder, because they need to
    ensure that short frames have enough padding, a problem that normal
    taggers don't have.
    
    The principle of the DSA framework is that everything except for the
    most intimate hardware specifics (like in this case, the actual packing
    of the DSA tag bits) should be done inside the core, to avoid having
    code paths that are very rarely tested.
    
    So provide a TX reallocation procedure that should cover the known needs
    of DSA today.
    
    Note that this patch also gives the network stack a good hint about the
    headroom/tailroom it's going to need. Up till now it wasn't doing that.
    So the reallocation procedure should really be there only for the
    exceptional cases, and for cloned packets which need to be unshared.

    s390/qeth: fix notification for pending buffers during teardown
    
    [ Upstream commit 7eefda7f353ef86ad82a2dc8329e8a3538c08ab6 ]
    
    The cited commit reworked the state machine for pending TX buffers.
    In qeth_iqd_tx_complete() it turned PENDING into a transient state, and
    uses NEED_QAOB for buffers that get parked while waiting for their QAOB
    completion.
    
    But it missed to adjust the check in qeth_tx_complete_buf(). So if
    qeth_tx_complete_pending_bufs() is called during teardown to drain
    the parked TX buffers, we no longer raise a notification for af_iucv.
    
    Instead of updating the checked state, just move this code into
    qeth_tx_complete_pending_bufs() itself. This also gets rid of the
    special-case in the common TX completion path.

    s390/qeth: improve completion of pending TX buffers
    
    [ Upstream commit c20383ad1656b0f6354dd50e4acd894f9d94090d ]
    
    The current design attaches a pending TX buffer to a custom
    single-linked list, which is anchored at the buffer's slot on the
    TX ring. The buffer is then checked for final completion whenever
    this slot is processed during a subsequent TX NAPI poll cycle.
    
    But if there's insufficient traffic on the ring, we might never make
    enough progress to get back to this ring slot and discover the pending
    buffer's final TX completion. In particular if this missing TX
    completion blocks the application from sending further traffic.
    
    So convert the custom single-linked list code to a per-queue list_head,
    and scan this list on every TX NAPI cycle.

    s390/qeth: don't replace a fully completed async TX buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit db4ffdcef7c9a842e55228c9faef7abf8b72382f ]
    
    For TX buffers that require an additional async notification via QAOB, the
    TX completion code can now manage all the necessary processing if the
    notification has already occurred (or is occurring concurrently).
    
    In such cases we can avoid replacing the metadata that is associated
    with the buffer's slot on the ring, and just keep using the current one.
    
    As qeth_clear_output_buffer() will also handle any kmem cache-allocated
    memory that was mapped into the TX buffer, qeth_qdio_handle_aob()
    doesn't need to worry about it.
    
    While at it, also remove the unneeded forward declaration for
    qeth_init_qdio_out_buf().

    media: rc: compile rc-cec.c into rc-core
    
    commit f09f9f93afad770a04b35235a0aa465fcc8d6e3d upstream.
    
    The rc-cec keymap is unusual in that it can't be built as a module,
    instead it is registered directly in rc-main.c if CONFIG_MEDIA_CEC_RC
    is set. This is because it can be called from drm_dp_cec_set_edid() via
    cec_register_adapter() in an asynchronous context, and it is not
    allowed to use request_module() to load rc-cec.ko in that case. Trying to
    do so results in a 'WARN_ON_ONCE(wait && current_is_async())'.
    
    Since this keymap is only used if CONFIG_MEDIA_CEC_RC is set, we
    just compile this keymap into the rc-core module and never as a
    separate module.

    media: usbtv: Fix deadlock on suspend
    
    commit 8a7e27fd5cd696ba564a3f62cedef7269cfd0723 upstream.
    
    usbtv doesn't support power management, so on system suspend the
    .disconnect callback of the driver is called. The teardown sequence
    includes a call to snd_card_free. Its implementation waits until the
    refcount of the sound card device drops to zero, however, if its file is
    open, snd_card_file_add takes a reference, which can't be dropped during
    the suspend, because the userspace processes are already frozen at this
    point. snd_card_free waits for completion forever, leading to a hang on
    suspend.
    
    This commit fixes this deadlock condition by replacing snd_card_free
    with snd_card_free_when_closed, that doesn't wait until all references
    are released, allowing suspend to progress.

    Commit 311a50e76a33 ("drm/i915: Add support for mandatory cmdparsing")
    introduced mandatory command parsing but setup failures were not
    translated into wedging the GPU which was probably the intent.
    
    Possible errors come in two categories. Either the sanity check on
    internal tables has failed, which should be caught in CI unless an
    affected platform would be missed in testing; or memory allocation failure
    happened during driver load, which should be extremely unlikely but for
    correctness should still be handled.

    drm: Use USB controller's DMA mask when importing dmabufs
    
    commit 659ab7a49cbebe0deffcbe1f9560e82006b21817 upstream.
    
    USB devices cannot perform DMA and hence have no dma_mask set in their
    device structure. Therefore importing dmabuf into a USB-based driver
    fails, which breaks joining and mirroring of display in X11.
    
    For USB devices, pick the associated USB controller as attachment device.
    This allows the DRM import helpers to perform the DMA setup. If the DMA
    controller does not support DMA transfers, we're out of luck and cannot
    import. Our current USB-based DRM drivers don't use DMA, so the actual
    DMA device is not important.
    
    Tested by joining/mirroring displays of udl and radeon under Gnome/X11.
    
    v8:
            * release dmadev if device initialization fails (Noralf)
            * fix commit description (Noralf)
    v7:
            * fix use-before-init bug in gm12u320 (Dan)
    v6:
            * implement workaround in DRM drivers and hold reference to
              DMA device while USB device is in use
            * remove dev_is_usb() (Greg)
            * collapse USB helper into usb_intf_get_dma_device() (Alan)
            * integrate Daniel's TODO statement (Daniel)
            * fix typos (Greg)
    v5:
            * provide a helper for USB interfaces (Alan)
            * add FIXME item to documentation and TODO list (Daniel)
    v4:
            * implement workaround with USB helper functions (Greg)

    v3:

    v2:

    drm/shmem-helper: Don't remove the offset in vm_area_struct pgoff
    
    commit 11d5a4745e00e73745774671dbf2fb07bd6e2363 upstream.
    
    When mmapping the shmem, it would previously adjust the pgoff in the
    vm_area_struct to remove the fake offset that is added to be able to
    identify the buffer. This patch removes the adjustment and makes the
    fault handler use the vm_fault address to calculate the page offset
    instead. Although using this address is apparently discouraged, several
    DRM drivers seem to be doing it anyway.
    
    The problem with removing the pgoff is that it prevents
    drm_vma_node_unmap from working because that searches the mapping tree
    by address. That doesn't work because all of the mappings are at offset
    0. drm_vma_node_unmap is being used by the shmem helpers when purging
    the buffer.
    
    This fixes a bug in Panfrost which is using drm_gem_shmem_purge. Without
    this the mapping for the purged buffer can still be accessed which might
    mean it would access random pages from other buffers
    
    v2: Don't check whether the unsigned page_offset is less than 0.

    When a buffer is madvised as not needed and then purged, any attempts to

    drm/amd/display: Fix nested FPU context in dcn21_validate_bandwidth()
    
    commit 15e8b95d5f7509e0b09289be8c422c459c9f0412 upstream.
    
    Commit 41401ac67791 added FPU wrappers to dcn21_validate_bandwidth(),
    which was correct. Unfortunately a nested function alredy contained
    DC_FP_START()/DC_FP_END() calls, which results in nested FPU context
    enter/exit and complaints by kernel_fpu_begin_mask().
    This can be observed e.g. with 5.10.20, which backported 41401ac67791
    and now emits the following warning on boot:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 858 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/core.c:129 kernel_fpu_begin_mask+0xa5/0xc0
    Call Trace:

     dcn21_validate_bandwidth+0x29/0x40 [amdgpu]
     dc_validate_global_state+0x3c7/0x4c0 [amdgpu]
    
    The warning is emitted due to the additional DC_FP_START/END calls in
    patch_bounding_box(), which is inlined into dcn21_calculate_wm(),
    its only caller. Removing the calls brings the code in line with
    dcn20 and makes the warning disappear.

    After fixing nested FPU contexts caused by 41401ac67791 we're still seeing

    commit 7a46f05e5e163c00e41892e671294286e53fe15c upstream.
    
    There seem devices that don't work with the aux channel backlight
    control.  For allowing such users to test with the other backlight
    control method, provide a new module option, aux_backlight, to specify
    enabling or disabling the aux backport support explicitly.  As
    default, the aux support is detected by the hardware capability.
    
    v2: make the backlight option generic in case we add future
    backlight types (Alex)

    drm/compat: Clear bounce structures
    
    commit de066e116306baf3a6a62691ac63cfc0b1dabddb upstream.
    
    Some of them have gaps, or fields we don't clear. Native ioctl code
    does full copies plus zero-extends on size mismatch, so nothing can
    leak. But compat is more hand-rolled so need to be careful.
    
    None of these matter for performance, so just memset.
    
    Also I didn't fix up the CONFIG_DRM_LEGACY or CONFIG_DRM_AGP ioctl, those
    are security holes anyway.

    gpio: pca953x: Set IRQ type when handle Intel Galileo Gen 2
    
    commit eb441337c7147514ab45036cadf09c3a71e4ce31 upstream.
    
    The commit 0ea683931adb ("gpio: dwapb: Convert driver to using the
    GPIO-lib-based IRQ-chip") indeliberately made a regression on how
    IRQ line from GPIO I²C expander is handled. I.e. it reveals that
    the quirk for Intel Galileo Gen 2 misses the part of setting IRQ type
    which previously was predefined by gpio-dwapb driver. Now, we have to
    reorganize the approach to call necessary parts, which can be done via
    ACPI_GPIO_QUIRK_ABSOLUTE_NUMBER quirk.
    
    Without this fix and with above mentioned change the kernel hangs
    on the first IRQ event with:
    
        gpio gpiochip3: Persistence not supported for GPIO 1
        irq 32, desc: 62f8fb50, depth: 0, count: 0, unhandled: 0

    gpiolib: acpi: Add ACPI_GPIO_QUIRK_ABSOLUTE_NUMBER quirk
    
    commit 62d5247d239d4b48762192a251c647d7c997616a upstream.
    
    On some systems the ACPI tables has wrong pin number and instead of
    having a relative one it provides an absolute one in the global GPIO
    number space.
    
    Add ACPI_GPIO_QUIRK_ABSOLUTE_NUMBER quirk to cope with such cases.

    bnxt_en: reliably allocate IRQ table on reset to avoid crash
    
    commit 20d7d1c5c9b11e9f538ed4a2289be106de970d3e upstream.

    of 'bp->irq_tbl' in bnxt_setup_inta() on an Aarch64 system after many
    device resets:

    Ordinarily, a call to bnxt_setup_inta() (not in trace due to inlining)
    would not be expected on a system supporting MSIX at all. However, if
    bnxt_init_int_mode() does not end up being called after the call to
    bnxt_clear_int_mode() in bnxt_fw_reset_close(), then the driver will
    think that only INTA is supported and bp->irq_tbl will be NULL,
    causing the above crash.
    
    In the error recovery scenario, we call bnxt_clear_int_mode() in
    bnxt_fw_reset_close() early in the sequence. Ordinarily, we will
    call bnxt_init_int_mode() in bnxt_hwrm_if_change() after we
    reestablish communication with the firmware after reset.  However,
    if the sequence has to abort before we call bnxt_init_int_mode() and
    if the user later attempts to re-open the device, then it will cause
    the crash above.
    
    We fix it in 2 ways:
    
    1. Check for bp->irq_tbl in bnxt_setup_int_mode(). If it is NULL, call
    bnxt_init_init_mode().
    
    2. If we need to abort in bnxt_hwrm_if_change() and cannot complete
    the error recovery sequence, set the BNXT_STATE_ABORT_ERR flag.  This
    will cause more drastic recovery at the next attempt to re-open the
    device, including a call to bnxt_init_int_mode().

    perf report: Fix -F for branch & mem modes
    
    commit 6740a4e70e5d1b9d8e7fe41fd46dd5656d65dadf upstream.
    
    perf report fails to add valid additional fields with -F when
    used with branch or mem modes. Fix it.
    
    Before patch:
    
      $ perf record -b
      $ perf report -b -F +srcline_from --stdio
      Error:
      Invalid --fields key: `srcline_from'
    
    After patch:
    
      $ perf report -b -F +srcline_from --stdio
      # Samples: 8K of event 'cycles'
      # Event count (approx.): 8784
      ...
    
    Committer notes:
    
    There was an inversion: when looking at branch stack dimensions (keys)
    it was checking if the sort mode was 'mem', not 'branch'.

    mlxsw: spectrum_ethtool: Add an external speed to PTYS register
    
    commit ae9b24ddb69b4e31cda1b5e267a5a08a1db11717 upstream.
    
    Currently, only external bits are added to the PTYS register, whereas
    there is one external bit that is wrongly marked as internal, and so was
    recently removed from the register.
    
    Add that bit to the PTYS register again, as this bit is no longer
    internal.
    
    Its removal resulted in '100000baseLR4_ER4/Full' link mode no longer
    being supported, causing a regression on some setups.

    selftests: forwarding: Fix race condition in mirror installation
    
    commit edcbf5137f093b5502f5f6b97cce3cbadbde27aa upstream.
    
    When mirroring to a gretap in hardware the device expects to be
    programmed with the egress port and all the encapsulating headers. This
    requires the driver to resolve the path the packet will take in the
    software data path and program the device accordingly.
    
    If the path cannot be resolved (in this case because of an unresolved
    neighbor), then mirror installation fails until the path is resolved.
    This results in a race that causes the test to sometimes fail.
    
    Fix this by setting the neighbor's state to permanent, so that it is
    always valid.

    commit c511819d138de38e1637eedb645c207e09680d0f upstream.
    
    stmmac_xmit() call stmmac_tx_timer_arm() at the end to modify tx timer to
    do the transmission cleanup work. Imagine such a situation, stmmac enters
    suspend immediately after tx timer modified, it's expire callback
    stmmac_tx_clean() would not be invoked. This could affect BQL, since
    netdev_tx_sent_queue() has been called, but netdev_tx_completed_queue()
    have not been involved, as a result, dql_avail(&dev_queue->dql) finally
    always return a negative value.

                    netif_xmit_frozen_or_stopped(txq)) // __QUEUE_STATE_STACK_XOFF is set
    
    Net core will stop transmitting any more. Finillay, net watchdong would timeout.
    To fix this issue, we should call netdev_tx_reset_queue() in stmmac_resume().

    perf build: Fix ccache usage in $(CC) when generating arch errno table
    
    commit dacfc08dcafa7d443ab339592999e37bbb8a3ef0 upstream.
    
    This was introduced by commit e4ffd066ff440a57 ("perf: Normalize gcc
    parameter when generating arch errno table").
    
    Assuming the first word of $(CC) is the actual compiler breaks usage
    like CC="ccache gcc": the script ends up calling ccache directly with
    gcc arguments, what fails. Instead of getting the first word, just
    remove from $(CC) any word that starts with a "-". This maintains the
    spirit of the original patch, while not breaking ccache users.

    tools/resolve_btfids: Fix build error with older host toolchains
    
    commit 41462c6e730ca0e63f5fed5a517052385d980c54 upstream.
    
    Older libelf.h and glibc elf.h might not yet define the ELF compression
    types.
    
    Checking and defining SHF_COMPRESSED fix the build error when compiling
    with older toolchains. Also, the tool resolve_btfids is compiled with host
    toolchain. The host toolchain is more likely to be older than the cross
    compile toolchain.

    commit e7a36d27f6b9f389e41d8189a8a08919c6835732 upstream.
    
    When qeth_alloc_qdio_queues() fails to allocate one of the buffers that
    back an Output Queue, the 'out_freeoutqbufs' path will free all
    previously allocated buffers for this queue. But it misses to free the

    net: enetc: allow hardware timestamping on TX queues with tc-etf enabled
    
    commit 29d98f54a4fe1b6a9089bec8715a1b89ff9ad59c upstream.
    
    The txtime is passed to the driver in skb->skb_mstamp_ns, which is
    actually in a union with skb->tstamp (the place where software
    timestamps are kept).
    
    Since commit b50a5c70ffa4 ("net: allow simultaneous SW and HW transmit
    timestamping"), __sock_recv_timestamp has some logic for making sure
    that the two calls to skb_tstamp_tx:
    
    skb_tx_timestamp(skb) # Software timestamp in the driver
    -> skb_tstamp_tx(skb, NULL)
    
    and
    
    skb_tstamp_tx(skb, &shhwtstamps) # Hardware timestamp in the driver
    
    will both do the right thing and in a race-free manner, meaning that
    skb_tx_timestamp will deliver a cmsg with the software timestamp only,
    and skb_tstamp_tx with a non-NULL hwtstamps argument will deliver a cmsg
    with the hardware timestamp only.
    
    Why are races even possible? Well, because although the software timestamp
    skb->tstamp is private per skb, the hardware timestamp skb_hwtstamps(skb)
    lives in skb_shinfo(skb), an area which is shared between skbs and their
    clones. And skb_tstamp_tx works by cloning the packets when timestamping
    them, therefore attempting to perform hardware timestamping on an skb's
    clone will also change the hardware timestamp of the original skb. And
    the original skb might have been yet again cloned for software
    timestamping, at an earlier stage.
    
    So the logic in __sock_recv_timestamp can't be as simple as saying
    "does this skb have a hardware timestamp? if yes I'll send the hardware
    timestamp to the socket, otherwise I'll send the software timestamp",
    precisely because the hardware timestamp is shared.
    Instead, it's quite the other way around: __sock_recv_timestamp says
    "does this skb have a software timestamp? if yes, I'll send the software
    timestamp, otherwise the hardware one". This works because the software
    timestamp is not shared with clones.
    
    But that means we have a problem when we attempt hardware timestamping
    with skbs that don't have the skb->tstamp == 0. __sock_recv_timestamp
    will say "oh, yeah, this must be some sort of odd clone" and will not
    deliver the hardware timestamp to the socket. And this is exactly what
    is happening when we have txtime enabled on the socket: as mentioned,
    that is put in a union with skb->tstamp, so it is quite easy to mistake
    it.
    
    Do what other drivers do (intel igb/igc) and write zero to skb->tstamp
    before taking the hardware timestamp. It's of no use to us now (we're
    already on the TX confirmation path).

    net: lapbether: Remove netif_start_queue / netif_stop_queue
    
    commit f7d9d4854519fdf4d45c70a4d953438cd88e7e58 upstream.
    
    For the devices in this driver, the default qdisc is "noqueue",
    because their "tx_queue_len" is 0.
    
    In function "__dev_queue_xmit" in "net/core/dev.c", devices with the
    "noqueue" qdisc are specially handled. Packets are transmitted without
    being queued after a "dev->flags & IFF_UP" check. However, it's possible
    that even if this check succeeds, "ops->ndo_stop" may still have already
    been called. This is because in "__dev_close_many", "ops->ndo_stop" is
    called before clearing the "IFF_UP" flag.
    
    If we call "netif_stop_queue" in "ops->ndo_stop", then it's possible in
    "__dev_queue_xmit", it sees the "IFF_UP" flag is present, and then it
    checks "netif_xmit_stopped" and finds that the queue is already stopped.
    In this case, it will complain that:
    "Virtual device ... asks to queue packet!"
    
    To prevent "__dev_queue_xmit" from generating this complaint, we should
    not call "netif_stop_queue" in "ops->ndo_stop".
    
    We also don't need to call "netif_start_queue" in "ops->ndo_open",
    because after a netdev is allocated and registered, the
    "__QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF" flag is initially not set, so there is no need
    to call "netif_start_queue" to clear it.

    cipso,calipso: resolve a number of problems with the DOI refcounts
    
    commit ad5d07f4a9cd671233ae20983848874731102c08 upstream.
    
    The current CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting scheme for the DOI
    definitions is a bit flawed in that we:
    
    1. Don't correctly match gets/puts in netlbl_cipsov4_list().
    2. Decrement the refcount on each attempt to remove the DOI from the
       DOI list, only removing it from the list once the refcount drops
       to zero.
    
    This patch fixes these problems by adding the missing "puts" to
    netlbl_cipsov4_list() and introduces a more conventional, i.e.
    not-buggy, refcounting mechanism to the DOI definitions.  Upon the
    addition of a DOI to the DOI list, it is initialized with a refcount
    of one, removing a DOI from the list removes it from the list and
    drops the refcount by one; "gets" and "puts" behave as expected with
    respect to refcounts, increasing and decreasing the DOI's refcount by
    one.

    commit 053d8ad10d585adf9891fcd049637536e2fe9ea7 upstream.
    
    When using MLO_AN_PHY or MLO_AN_FIXED, the MII_BMCR of the SGMII PCS is
    read before resetting the switch so it can be reprogrammed afterwards.
    This works for the speeds of 1Gbps and 100Mbps, but not for 10Mbps,
    because SPEED_10 is actually 0, so AND-ing anything with 0 is false,
    therefore that last branch is dead code.
    
    Do what others do (genphy_read_status_fixed, phy_mii_ioctl) and just
    remove the check for SPEED_10, let it fall into the default case.

    nexthop: Do not flush blackhole nexthops when loopback goes down
    
    commit 76c03bf8e2624076b88d93542d78e22d5345c88e upstream.
    
    As far as user space is concerned, blackhole nexthops do not have a
    nexthop device and therefore should not be affected by the
    administrative or carrier state of any netdev.
    
    However, when the loopback netdev goes down all the blackhole nexthops
    are flushed. This happens because internally the kernel associates
    blackhole nexthops with the loopback netdev.
    
    This behavior is both confusing to those not familiar with kernel
    internals and also diverges from the legacy API where blackhole IPv4
    routes are not flushed when the loopback netdev goes down:
    
     # ip route add blackhole 198.51.100.0/24
     # ip link set dev lo down
     # ip route show 198.51.100.0/24
     blackhole 198.51.100.0/24
    
    Blackhole IPv6 routes are flushed, but at least user space knows that
    they are associated with the loopback netdev:
    
     # ip -6 route show 2001:db8:1::/64
     blackhole 2001:db8:1::/64 dev lo metric 1024 pref medium
    
    Fix this by only flushing blackhole nexthops when the loopback netdev is
    unregistered.

    net/mlx4_en: update moderation when config reset
    
    commit 00ff801bb8ce6711e919af4530b6ffa14a22390a upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a bug that the moderation config will not be
    applied when calling mlx4_en_reset_config. For example, when
    turning on rx timestamping, mlx4_en_reset_config() will be called,
    causing the NIC to forget previous moderation config.
    
    This fix is in phase with a previous fix:
    commit 79c54b6bbf06 ("net/mlx4_en: Fix TX moderation info loss
    after set_ringparam is called")
    
    Tested: Before this patch, on a host with NIC using mlx4, run
    netserver and stream TCP to the host at full utilization.
    $ sar -I SUM 1
                     INTR    intr/s
    14:03:56          sum  48758.00
    
    After rx hwtstamp is enabled:
    $ sar -I SUM 1
    14:10:38          sum 317771.00
    We see the moderation is not working properly and issued 7x more
    interrupts.
    
    After the patch, and turned on rx hwtstamp, the rate of interrupts
    is as expected:
    $ sar -I SUM 1
    14:52:11          sum  49332.00

    net: enetc: keep RX ring consumer index in sync with hardware
    
    commit 3a5d12c9be6f30080600c8bacaf310194e37d029 upstream.
    
    The RX rings have a producer index owned by hardware, where newly
    received frame buffers are placed, and a consumer index owned by
    software, where newly allocated buffers are placed, in expectation of
    hardware being able to place frame data in them.
    
    Hardware increments the producer index when a frame is received, however
    it is not allowed to increment the producer index to match the consumer
    index (RBCIR) since the ring can hold at most RBLENR[LENGTH]-1 received
    BDs. Whenever the producer index matches the value of the consumer
    index, the ring has no unprocessed received frames and all BDs in the
    ring have been initialized/prepared by software, i.e. hardware owns all
    BDs in the ring.
    
    The code uses the next_to_clean variable to keep track of the producer
    index, and the next_to_use variable to keep track of the consumer index.
    
    The RX rings are seeded from enetc_refill_rx_ring, which is called from
    two places:
    
    1. initially the ring is seeded until full with enetc_bd_unused(rx_ring),
       i.e. with 511 buffers. This will make next_to_clean=0 and next_to_use=511:
    
    .ndo_open
    -> enetc_open
       -> enetc_setup_bdrs
          -> enetc_setup_rxbdr
             -> enetc_refill_rx_ring
    
    2. then during the data path processing, it is refilled with 16 buffers
       at a time:
    
    enetc_msix
    -> napi_schedule
       -> enetc_poll
          -> enetc_clean_rx_ring
             -> enetc_refill_rx_ring
    
    There is just one problem: the initial seeding done during .ndo_open
    updates just the producer index (ENETC_RBPIR) with 0, and the software
    next_to_clean and next_to_use variables. Notably, it will not update the
    consumer index to make the hardware aware of the newly added buffers.
    
    Wait, what? So how does it work?
    
    Well, the reset values of the producer index and of the consumer index
    of a ring are both zero. As per the description in the second paragraph,
    it means that the ring is full of buffers waiting for hardware to put
    frames in them, which by coincidence is almost true, because we have in
    fact seeded 511 buffers into the ring.
    
    But will the hardware attempt to access the 512th entry of the ring,
    which has an invalid BD in it? Well, no, because in order to do that, it
    would have to first populate the first 511 entries, and the NAPI
    enetc_poll will kick in by then. Eventually, after 16 processed slots
    have become available in the RX ring, enetc_clean_rx_ring will call
    enetc_refill_rx_ring and then will [ finally ] update the consumer index
    with the new software next_to_use variable. From now on, the
    next_to_clean and next_to_use variables are in sync with the producer
    and consumer ring indices.
    
    So the day is saved, right? Well, not quite. Freeing the memory
    allocated for the rings is done in:
    
    enetc_close
    -> enetc_clear_bdrs
       -> enetc_clear_rxbdr
          -> this just disables the ring
    -> enetc_free_rxtx_rings
       -> enetc_free_rx_ring
          -> sets next_to_clean and next_to_use to 0
    
    but again, nothing is committed to the hardware producer and consumer
    indices (yay!). The assumption is that the ring is disabled, so the
    indices don't matter anyway, and it's the responsibility of the "open"
    code path to set those up.
    
    .. Except that the "open" code path does not set those up properly.
    
    While initially, things almost work, during subsequent enetc_close ->
    enetc_open sequences, we have problems. To be precise, the enetc_open
    that is subsequent to enetc_close will again refill the ring with 511
    entries, but it will leave the consumer index untouched. Untouched
    means, of course, equal to the value it had before disabling the ring
    and draining the old buffers in enetc_close.
    
    But as mentioned, enetc_setup_rxbdr will at least update the producer
    index though, through this line of code:
    
            enetc_rxbdr_wr(hw, idx, ENETC_RBPIR, 0);
    
    so at this stage we'll have:
    
    next_to_clean=0 (in hardware 0)
    next_to_use=511 (in hardware we'll have the refill index prior to enetc_close)
    
    Again, the next_to_clean and producer index are in sync and set to
    correct values, so the driver manages to limp on. Eventually, 16 ring
    entries will be consumed by enetc_poll, and the savior
    enetc_clean_rx_ring will come and call enetc_refill_rx_ring, and then
    update the hardware consumer ring based upon the new next_to_use.
    
    So.. it works?
    Well, by coincidence, it almost does, but there's a circumstance where
    enetc_clean_rx_ring won't be there to save us. If the previous value of
    the consumer index was 15, there's a problem, because the NAPI poll
    sequence will only issue a refill when 16 or more buffers have been
    consumed.
    
    It's easiest to illustrate this with an example:
    
    ip link set eno0 up
    ip addr add 192.168.100.1/24 dev eno0
    ping 192.168.100.1 -c 20 # ping this port from another board
    ip link set eno0 down
    ip link set eno0 up
    ping 192.168.100.1 -c 20 # ping it again from the same other board
    
    One by one:
    
    1. ip link set eno0 up
    -> calls enetc_setup_rxbdr:
       -> calls enetc_refill_rx_ring(511 buffers)
       -> next_to_clean=0 (in hw 0)
       -> next_to_use=511 (in hw 0)
    
    2. ping 192.168.100.1 -c 20 # ping this port from another board
    enetc_clean_rx_ring: rx_frm_cnt=1 cleaned_cnt=1 next_to_clean 0 (in hw 1) next_to_use 511 (in hw 0)

    20 packets transmitted, 12 packets received, 40% packet loss
    
    And there it dies. No enetc_refill_rx_ring (because cleaned_cnt must be equal
    to 15 for that to happen), no nothing. The hardware enters the condition where
    the producer (14) + 1 is equal to the consumer (15) index, which makes it
    believe it has no more free buffers to put packets in, so it starts discarding
    them:
    
    ip netns exec ns0 ethtool -S eno0 | grep -v ': 0'
    NIC statistics:
         Rx ring  0 discarded frames: 8
    
    Summarized, if the interface receives between 16 and 32 (mod 512) frames
    and then there is a link flap, then the port will eventually die with no
    way to recover. If it receives less than 16 (mod 512) frames, then the
    initial NAPI poll [ before the link flap ] will not update the consumer
    index in hardware (it will remain zero) which will be ok when the buffers
    are later reinitialized. If more than 32 (mod 512) frames are received,
    the initial NAPI poll has the chance to refill the ring twice, updating
    the consumer index to at least 32. So after the link flap, the consumer
    index is still wrong, but the post-flap NAPI poll gets a chance to
    refill the ring once (because it passes through cleaned_cnt=15) and
    makes the consumer index be again back in sync with next_to_use.
    
    The solution to this problem is actually simple, we just need to write
    next_to_use into the hardware consumer index at enetc_open time, which
    always brings it back in sync after an initial buffer seeding process.
    
    The simpler thing would be to put the write to the consumer index into
    enetc_refill_rx_ring directly, but there are issues with the MDIO
    locking: in the NAPI poll code we have the enetc_lock_mdio() taken from
    top-level and we use the unlocked enetc_wr_reg_hot, whereas in
    enetc_open, the enetc_lock_mdio() is not taken at the top level, but
    instead by each individual enetc_wr_reg, so we are forced to put an
    additional enetc_wr_reg in enetc_setup_rxbdr. Better organization of
    the code is left as a refactoring exercise.

    net: enetc: remove bogus write to SIRXIDR from enetc_setup_rxbdr
    
    commit 96a5223b918c8b79270fc0fec235a7ebad459098 upstream.
    
    The Station Interface Receive Interrupt Detect Register (SIRXIDR)
    contains a 16-bit wide mask of 'interrupt detected' events for each ring
    associated with a port. Bit i is write-1-to-clean for RX ring i.
    
    I have no explanation whatsoever how this line of code came to be
    inserted in the blamed commit. I checked the downstream versions of that
    patch and none of them have it.
    
    The somewhat comical aspect of it is that we're writing a binary number
    to the SIRXIDR register, which is derived from enetc_bd_unused(rx_ring).
    Since the RX rings have 512 buffer descriptors, we end up writing 511 to
    this register, which is 0x1ff, so we are effectively clearing the
    'interrupt detected' event for rings 0-8.
    
    This register is not what is used for interrupt handling though - it
    only provides a summary for the entire SI. The hardware provides one
    separate Interrupt Detect Register per RX ring, which auto-clears upon
    read. So there doesn't seem to be any adverse effect caused by this
    bogus write.
    
    There is, however, one reason why this should be handled as a bugfix:
    next_to_clean _should_ be committed to hardware, just not to that
    register, and this was obscuring the fact that it wasn't. This is fixed
    in the next patch, and removing the bogus line now allows the fix patch
    to be backported beyond that point.

    net: enetc: force the RGMII speed and duplex instead of operating in inband mode
    
    commit c76a97218dcbb2cb7cec1404ace43ef96c87d874 upstream.
    
    The ENETC port 0 MAC supports in-band status signaling coming from a PHY
    when operating in RGMII mode, and this feature is enabled by default.
    
    It has been reported that RGMII is broken in fixed-link, and that is not
    surprising considering the fact that no PHY is attached to the MAC in
    that case, but a switch.
    
    This brings us to the topic of the patch: the enetc driver should have
    not enabled the optional in-band status signaling for RGMII unconditionally,
    but should have forced the speed and duplex to what was resolved by
    phylink.
    
    Note that phylink does not accept the RGMII modes as valid for in-band
    signaling, and these operate a bit differently than 1000base-x and SGMII
    (notably there is no clause 37 state machine so no ACK required from the
    MAC, instead the PHY sends extra code words on RXD[3:0] whenever it is
    not transmitting something else, so it should be safe to leave a PHY
    with this option unconditionally enabled even if we ignore it). The spec
    talks about this here:

    net: enetc: don't disable VLAN filtering in IFF_PROMISC mode
    
    commit a74dbce9d4541888fe0d39afe69a3a95004669b4 upstream.
    
    Quoting from the blamed commit:
    
        In promiscuous mode, it is more intuitive that all traffic is received,
        including VLAN tagged traffic. It appears that it is necessary to set
        the flag in PSIPVMR for that to be the case, so VLAN promiscuous mode is
        also temporarily enabled. On exit from promiscuous mode, the setting
        made by ethtool is restored.
    
    Intuitive or not, there isn't any definition issued by a standards body
    which says that promiscuity has anything to do with VLAN filtering - it
    only has to do with accepting packets regardless of destination MAC address.
    
    In fact people are already trying to use this misunderstanding/bug of
    the enetc driver as a justification to transform promiscuity into
    something it never was about: accepting every packet (maybe that would
    be the "rx-all" netdev feature?):
    https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20201110153958.ci5ekor3o2ekg3ky@ipetronik.com/
    
    This is relevant because there are use cases in the kernel (such as
    tc-flower rules with the protocol 802.1Q and a vlan_id key) which do not
    (yet) use the vlan_vid_add API to be compatible with VLAN-filtering NICs
    such as enetc, so for those, disabling rx-vlan-filter is currently the
    only right solution to make these setups work:
    https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CA+h21hoxwRdhq4y+w8Kwgm74d4cA0xLeiHTrmT-VpSaM7obhkg@mail.gmail.com/
    The blamed patch has unintentionally introduced one more way for this to
    work, which is to enable IFF_PROMISC, however this is non-portable
    because port promiscuity is not meant to disable VLAN filtering.
    Therefore, it could invite people to write broken scripts for enetc, and
    then wonder why they are broken when migrating to other drivers that
    don't handle promiscuity in the same way.

    net: enetc: take the MDIO lock only once per NAPI poll cycle
    
    commit 6d36ecdbc4410e61a0e02adc5d3abeee22a8ffd3 upstream.
    
    The workaround for the ENETC MDIO erratum caused a performance
    degradation of 82 Kpps (seen with IP forwarding of two 1Gbps streams of
    64B packets). This is due to excessive locking and unlocking in the fast
    path, which can be avoided.
    
    By taking the MDIO read-side lock only once per NAPI poll cycle, we are
    able to regain 54 Kpps (65%) of the performance hit. The rest of the
    performance degradation comes from the TX data path, but unfortunately
    it doesn't look like we can optimize that away easily, even with
    netdev_xmit_more(), there just isn't any skb batching done, to help with
    taking the MDIO lock less often than once per packet.
    
    We need to change the register accessor type for enetc_get_tx_tstamp,
    because it now runs under the enetc_lock_mdio as per the new call path
    detailed below:
    
    enetc_msix

    net: enetc: don't overwrite the RSS indirection table when initializing
    
    commit c646d10dda2dcde82c6ce5a474522621ab2b8b19 upstream.
    
    After the blamed patch, all RX traffic gets hashed to CPU 0 because the
    hashing indirection table set up in:
    
    enetc_pf_probe
    -> enetc_alloc_si_resources
       -> enetc_configure_si
          -> enetc_setup_default_rss_table
    
    is overwritten later in:
    
    enetc_pf_probe
    -> enetc_init_port_rss_memory
    
    which zero-initializes the entire port RSS table in order to avoid ECC errors.
    
    The trouble really is that enetc_init_port_rss_memory really neads
    enetc_alloc_si_resources to be called, because it depends upon
    enetc_alloc_cbdr and enetc_setup_cbdr. But that whole enetc_configure_si
    thing could have been better thought out, it has nothing to do in a
    function called "alloc_si_resources", especially since its counterpart,
    "free_si_resources", does nothing to unwind the configuration of the SI.
    
    The point is, we need to pull out enetc_configure_si out of
    enetc_alloc_resources, and move it after enetc_init_port_rss_memory.
    This allows us to set up the default RSS indirection table after
    initializing the memory.

    commit 9eb8bc593a5eed167dac2029abef343854c5ba75 upstream.
    
    Commit 86dd9868b878 has several issues, but was accepted too soon
    before anyone could take a look.
    
    - Double free. dsa_slave_xmit() will free the skb if the xmit function
      returns NULL, but the skb is already freed by eth_skb_pad(). Use
      __skb_put_padto() to avoid that.
    - Unnecessary allocation. It has been done by DSA core since commit
      a3b0b6479700.
    - A u16 pointer points to skb data. It should be __be16 for network
      byte order.
    - Typo in comments. "numer" -> "number".
    
    Fixes: 86dd9868b878 ("net: dsa: tag_rtl4_a: Support also egress tags")

    Revert "mm, slub: consider rest of partial list if acquire_slab() fails"
    
    commit 9b1ea29bc0d7b94d420f96a0f4121403efc3dd85 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 8ff60eb052eeba95cfb3efe16b08c9199f8121cf.
    
    The kernel test robot reports a huge performance regression due to the
    commit, and the reason seems fairly straightforward: when there is
    contention on the page list (which is what causes acquire_slab() to
    fail), we do _not_ want to just loop and try again, because that will
    transfer the contention to the 'n->list_lock' spinlock we hold, and
    just make things even worse.
    
    This is admittedly likely a problem only on big machines - the kernel
    test robot report comes from a 96-thread dual socket Intel Xeon Gold
    6252 setup, but the regression there really is quite noticeable:
    
       -47.9% regression of stress-ng.rawpkt.ops_per_sec
    
    and the commit that was marked as being fixed (7ced37197196: "slub:
    Acquire_slab() avoid loop") actually did the loop exit early very
    intentionally (the hint being that "avoid loop" part of that commit
    message), exactly to avoid this issue.
    
    The correct thing to do may be to pick some kind of reasonable middle
    ground: instead of breaking out of the loop on the very first sign of
    contention, or trying over and over and over again, the right thing may
    be to re-try _once_, and then give up on the second failure (or pick
    your favorite value for "once"..).

    cifs: return proper error code in statfs(2)
    
    commit 14302ee3301b3a77b331cc14efb95bf7184c73cc upstream.
    
    In cifs_statfs(), if server->ops->queryfs is not NULL, then we should
    use its return value rather than always returning 0.  Instead, use rc
    variable as it is properly set to 0 in case there is no
    server->ops->queryfs.

    mount: fix mounting of detached mounts onto targets that reside on shared mounts
    
    commit ee2e3f50629f17b0752b55b2566c15ce8dafb557 upstream.
    
    Creating a series of detached mounts, attaching them to the filesystem,
    and unmounting them can be used to trigger an integer overflow in
    ns->mounts causing the kernel to block any new mounts in count_mounts()
    and returning ENOSPC because it falsely assumes that the maximum number
    of mounts in the mount namespace has been reached, i.e. it thinks it
    can't fit the new mounts into the mount namespace anymore.
    
    Depending on the number of mounts in your system, this can be reproduced
    on any kernel that supportes open_tree() and move_mount() by compiling
    and running the following program:

    and wait for the kernel to refuse any new mounts by returning ENOSPC.
    How many iterations are needed depends on the number of mounts in your
    system. Assuming you have something like 50 mounts on a standard system
    it should be almost instantaneous.
    
    The root cause of this is that detached mounts aren't handled correctly
    when source and target mount are identical and reside on a shared mount
    causing a broken mount tree where the detached source itself is
    propagated which propagation prevents for regular bind-mounts and new
    mounts. This ultimately leads to a miscalculation of the number of
    mounts in the mount namespace.
    
    Detached mounts created via
    open_tree(fd, path, OPEN_TREE_CLONE)
    are essentially like an unattached new mount, or an unattached
    bind-mount. They can then later on be attached to the filesystem via
    move_mount() which calls into attach_recursive_mount(). Part of
    attaching it to the filesystem is making sure that mounts get correctly
    propagated in case the destination mountpoint is MS_SHARED, i.e. is a
    shared mountpoint. This is done by calling into propagate_mnt() which
    walks the list of peers calling propagate_one() on each mount in this
    list making sure it receives the propagation event.
    The propagate_one() functions thereby skips both new mounts and bind
    mounts to not propagate them "into themselves". Both are identified by
    checking whether the mount is already attached to any mount namespace in
    mnt->mnt_ns. The is what the IS_MNT_NEW() helper is responsible for.
    
    However, detached mounts have an anonymous mount namespace attached to
    them stashed in mnt->mnt_ns which means that IS_MNT_NEW() doesn't
    realize they need to be skipped causing the mount to propagate "into
    itself" breaking the mount table and causing a disconnect between the
    number of mounts recorded as being beneath or reachable from the target
    mountpoint and the number of mounts actually recorded/counted in
    ns->mounts ultimately causing an overflow which in turn prevents any new
    mounts via the ENOSPC issue.
    
    So teach propagation to handle detached mounts by making it aware of
    them. I've been tracking this issue down for the last couple of days and
    then verifying that the fix is correct by
    unmounting everything in my current mount table leaving only /proc and
    /sys mounted and running the reproducer above overnight verifying the
    number of mounts counted in ns->mounts. With this fix the counts are
    correct and the ENOSPC issue can't be reproduced.
    
    This change will only have an effect on mounts created with the new
    mount API since detached mounts cannot be created with the old mount API
    so regressions are extremely unlikely.

    powerpc/603: Fix protection of user pages mapped with PROT_NONE
    
    commit c119565a15a628efdfa51352f9f6c5186e506a1c upstream.
    
    On book3s/32, page protection is defined by the PP bits in the PTE
    which provide the following protection depending on the access
    keys defined in the matching segment register:
    - PP 00 means RW with key 0 and N/A with key 1.
    - PP 01 means RW with key 0 and RO with key 1.
    - PP 10 means RW with both key 0 and key 1.
    - PP 11 means RO with both key 0 and key 1.
    
    Since the implementation of kernel userspace access protection,
    PP bits have been set as follows:
    - PP00 for pages without _PAGE_USER
    - PP01 for pages with _PAGE_USER and _PAGE_RW
    - PP11 for pages with _PAGE_USER and without _PAGE_RW
    
    For kernelspace segments, kernel accesses are performed with key 0
    and user accesses are performed with key 1. As PP00 is used for
    non _PAGE_USER pages, user can't access kernel pages not flagged
    _PAGE_USER while kernel can.
    
    For userspace segments, both kernel and user accesses are performed
    with key 0, therefore pages not flagged _PAGE_USER are still
    accessible to the user.
    
    This shouldn't be an issue, because userspace is expected to be
    accessible to the user. But unlike most other architectures, powerpc
    implements PROT_NONE protection by removing _PAGE_USER flag instead of
    flagging the page as not valid. This means that pages in userspace
    that are not flagged _PAGE_USER shall remain inaccessible.
    
    To get the expected behaviour, just mimic other architectures in the
    TLB miss handler by checking _PAGE_USER permission on userspace
    accesses as if it was the _PAGE_PRESENT bit.
    
    Note that this problem only is only for 603 cores. The 604+ have
    an hash table, and hash_page() function already implement the
    verification of _PAGE_USER permission on userspace pages.

    ibmvnic: always store valid MAC address
    
    commit 67eb211487f0c993d9f402d1c196ef159fd6a3b5 upstream.
    
    The last change to ibmvnic_set_mac(), 8fc3672a8ad3, meant to prevent
    users from setting an invalid MAC address on an ibmvnic interface
    that has not been brought up yet. The change also prevented the
    requested MAC address from being stored by the adapter object for an
    ibmvnic interface when the state of the ibmvnic interface is
    VNIC_PROBED - that is after probing has finished but before the
    ibmvnic interface is brought up. The MAC address stored by the
    adapter object is used and sent to the hypervisor for checking when
    an ibmvnic interface is brought up.
    
    The ibmvnic driver ignoring the requested MAC address when in
    VNIC_PROBED state caused LACP bonds (bonds in 802.3ad mode) with more
    than one slave to malfunction. The bonding code must be able to
    change the MAC address of its slaves before they are brought up
    during enslaving. The inability of kernels with 8fc3672a8ad3 to set
    the MAC addresses of bonding slaves is observable in the output of
    "ip address show". The MAC addresses of the slaves are the same as
    the MAC address of the bond on a working system whereas the slaves
    retain their original MAC addresses on a system with a malfunctioning
    LACP bond.

    libbpf: Clear map_info before each bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd
    
    commit 2b2aedabc44e9660f90ccf7ba1ca2706d75f411f upstream.
    
    xsk_lookup_bpf_maps, based on prog_fd, looks whether current prog has a
    reference to XSKMAP. BPF prog can include insns that work on various BPF
    maps and this is covered by iterating through map_ids.
    
    The bpf_map_info that is passed to bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd for filling
    needs to be cleared at each iteration, so that it doesn't contain any
    outdated fields and that is currently missing in the function of
    interest.
    
    To fix that, zero-init map_info via memset before each
    bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd call.
    
    Also, since the area of this code is touched, in general strcmp is
    considered harmful, so let's convert it to strncmp and provide the
    size of the array name for current map_info.
    
    While at it, do s/continue/break/ once we have found the xsks_map to
    terminate the search.

    selftests/bpf: Mask bpf_csum_diff() return value to 16 bits in test_verifier
    
    commit 6185266c5a853bb0f2a459e3ff594546f277609b upstream.
    
    The verifier test labelled "valid read map access into a read-only array
    2" calls the bpf_csum_diff() helper and checks its return value. However,
    architecture implementations of csum_partial() (which is what the helper
    uses) differ in whether they fold the return value to 16 bit or not. For
    example, x86 version has ...
    
            if (unlikely(odd)) {
                    result = from32to16(result);
                    result = ((result >> 8) & 0xff) | ((result & 0xff) << 8);
            }
    
    ... while generic lib/checksum.c does:
    
            result = from32to16(result);
            if (odd)
                    result = ((result >> 8) & 0xff) | ((result & 0xff) << 8);
    
    This makes the helper return different values on different architectures,
    breaking the test on non-x86. To fix this, add an additional instruction
    to always mask the return value to 16 bits, and update the expected return
    value accordingly.

    selftests/bpf: No need to drop the packet when there is no geneve opt
    
    commit 557c223b643a35effec9654958d8edc62fd2603a upstream.
    
    In bpf geneve tunnel test we set geneve option on tx side. On rx side we
    only call bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt(). Since commit 9c2e14b48119 ("ip_tunnels:
    Set tunnel option flag when tunnel metadata is present") geneve_rx() will
    not add TUNNEL_GENEVE_OPT flag if there is no geneve option, which cause
    bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt() return ENOENT and _geneve_get_tunnel() in
    test_tunnel_kern.c drop the packet.
    
    As it should be valid that bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt() return error when
    there is not tunnel option, there is no need to drop the packet and
    break all geneve rx traffic. Just set opt_class to 0 in this test and
    keep returning TC_ACT_OK.

    If phy uses generic driver and autoneg is on, enter command

    command "ethtool eth0" shows speed is 50Mb/s because phydev->speed
    has been set to 50 and no update later.
    
    And duplex setting has same problem too.
    
    However, if autoneg is on, phy only changes speed and duplex according to
    phydev->advertising, but not phydev->speed and phydev->duplex. So in this
    case, phydev->speed and phydev->duplex don't need to be set in function
    phy_ethtool_ksettings_set() if autoneg is on.

    net: always use icmp{,v6}_ndo_send from ndo_start_xmit
    
    commit 4372339efc06bc2a796f4cc9d0a7a929dfda4967 upstream.
    
    There were a few remaining tunnel drivers that didn't receive the prior
    conversion to icmp{,v6}_ndo_send. Knowing now that this could lead to
    memory corrution (see ee576c47db60 ("net: icmp: pass zeroed opts from
    icmp{,v6}_ndo_send before sending") for details), there's even more
    imperative to have these all converted. So this commit goes through the
    remaining cases that I could find and does a boring translation to the
    ndo variety.
    
    The Fixes: line below is the merge that originally added icmp{,v6}_
    ndo_send and converted the first batch of icmp{,v6}_send users. The
    rationale then for the change applies equally to this patch. It's just
    that these drivers were left out of the initial conversion because these
    network devices are hiding in net/ rather than in drivers/net/.

    netfilter: nf_nat: undo erroneous tcp edemux lookup
    
    commit 03a3ca37e4c6478e3a84f04c8429dd5889e107fd upstream.
    
    Under extremely rare conditions TCP early demux will retrieve the wrong
    socket.
    
    1. local machine establishes a connection to a remote server, S, on port
       p.
    
       This gives:
       laddr:lport -> S:p
       ... both in tcp and conntrack.
    
    2. local machine establishes a connection to host H, on port p2.
       2a. TCP stack choses same laddr:lport, so we have
       laddr:lport -> H:p2 from TCP point of view.
       2b). There is a destination NAT rewrite in place, translating
            H:p2 to S:p.  This results in following conntrack entries:
    
       I)  laddr:lport -> S:p  (origin)  S:p -> laddr:lport (reply)
       II) laddr:lport -> H:p2 (origin)  S:p -> laddr:lport2 (reply)
    
       NAT engine has rewritten laddr:lport to laddr:lport2 to map
       the reply packet to the correct origin.
    
       When server sends SYN/ACK to laddr:lport2, the PREROUTING hook
       will undo-the SNAT transformation, rewriting IP header to
       S:p -> laddr:lport
    
       This causes TCP early demux to associate the skb with the TCP socket
       of the first connection.
    
       The INPUT hook will then reverse the DNAT transformation, rewriting
       the IP header to H:p2 -> laddr:lport.
    
    Because packet ends up with the wrong socket, the new connection
    never completes: originator stays in SYN_SENT and conntrack entry
    remains in SYN_RECV until timeout, and responder retransmits SYN/ACK
    until it gives up.
    
    To resolve this, orphan the skb after the input rewrite:
    Because the source IP address changed, the socket must be incorrect.
    We can't move the DNAT undo to prerouting due to backwards
    compatibility, doing so will make iptables/nftables rules to no longer
    match the way they did.
    
    After orphan, the packet will be handed to the next protocol layer
    (tcp, udp, ...) and that will repeat the socket lookup just like as if
    early demux was disabled.

    tcp: Fix sign comparison bug in getsockopt(TCP_ZEROCOPY_RECEIVE)
    
    commit 2107d45f17bedd7dbf4178462da0ac223835a2a7 upstream.
    
    getsockopt(TCP_ZEROCOPY_RECEIVE) has a bug where we read a
    user-provided "len" field of type signed int, and then compare the
    value to the result of an "offsetofend" operation, which is unsigned.
    
    Negative values provided by the user will be promoted to large
    positive numbers; thus checking that len < offsetofend() will return
    false when the intention was that it return true.
    
    Note that while len is originally checked for negative values earlier
    on in do_tcp_getsockopt(), subsequent calls to get_user() re-read the
    value from userspace which may have changed in the meantime.
    
    Therefore, re-add the check for negative values after the call to
    get_user in the handler code for TCP_ZEROCOPY_RECEIVE.

    can: tcan4x5x: tcan4x5x_init(): fix initialization - clear MRAM before entering Normal Mode
    
    commit 2712625200ed69c642b9abc3a403830c4643364c upstream.
    
    This patch prevents a potentially destructive race condition. The
    device is fully operational on the bus after entering Normal Mode, so
    zeroing the MRAM after entering this mode may lead to loss of
    information, e.g. new received messages.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by first initializing the MRAM, then
    bringing the device into Normale Mode.

    can: skb: can_skb_set_owner(): fix ref counting if socket was closed before setting skb ownership
    
    commit e940e0895a82c6fbaa259f2615eb52b57ee91a7e upstream.
    
    There are two ref count variables controlling the free()ing of a socket:
    - struct sock::sk_refcnt - which is changed by sock_hold()/sock_put()
    - struct sock::sk_wmem_alloc - which accounts the memory allocated by
      the skbs in the send path.
    
    In case there are still TX skbs on the fly and the socket() is closed,
    the struct sock::sk_refcnt reaches 0. In the TX-path the CAN stack
    clones an "echo" skb, calls sock_hold() on the original socket and
    references it. This produces the following back trace:

    net: l2tp: reduce log level of messages in receive path, add counter instead
    
    commit 3e59e8856758eb5a2dfe1f831ef53b168fd58105 upstream.
    
    Commit 5ee759cda51b ("l2tp: use standard API for warning log messages")
    changed a number of warnings about invalid packets in the receive path
    so that they are always shown, instead of only when a special L2TP debug
    flag is set. Even with rate limiting these warnings can easily cause
    significant log spam - potentially triggered by a malicious party
    sending invalid packets on purpose.
    
    In addition these warnings were noticed by projects like Tunneldigger [1],
    which uses L2TP for its data path, but implements its own control
    protocol (which is sufficiently different from L2TP data packets that it
    would always be passed up to userspace even with future extensions of
    L2TP).
    
    Some of the warnings were already redundant, as l2tp_stats has a counter
    for these packets. This commit adds one additional counter for invalid
    packets that are passed up to userspace. Packets with unknown session are
    not counted as invalid, as there is nothing wrong with the format of
    these packets.
    
    With the additional counter, all of these messages are either redundant
    or benign, so we reduce them to pr_debug_ratelimited().

    net: avoid infinite loop in mpls_gso_segment when mpls_hlen == 0
    
    commit d348ede32e99d3a04863e9f9b28d224456118c27 upstream.
    
    A packet with skb_inner_network_header(skb) == skb_network_header(skb)
    and ETH_P_MPLS_UC will prevent mpls_gso_segment from pulling any headers
    from the packet. Subsequently, the call to skb_mac_gso_segment will
    again call mpls_gso_segment with the same packet leading to an infinite
    loop. In addition, ensure that the header length is a multiple of four,
    which should hold irrespective of the number of stacked labels.

    net: check if protocol extracted by virtio_net_hdr_set_proto is correct
    
    commit 924a9bc362a5223cd448ca08c3dde21235adc310 upstream.
    
    For gso packets, virtio_net_hdr_set_proto sets the protocol (if it isn't
    set) based on the type in the virtio net hdr, but the skb could contain
    anything since it could come from packet_snd through a raw socket. If
    there is a mismatch between what virtio_net_hdr_set_proto sets and
    the actual protocol, then the skb could be handled incorrectly later
    on.
    
    An example where this poses an issue is with the subsequent call to
    skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys_basic which relies on skb->protocol being set
    correctly. A specially crafted packet could fool
    skb_flow_dissect_flow_keys_basic preventing EINVAL to be returned.
    
    Avoid blindly trusting the information provided by the virtio net header
    by checking that the protocol in the packet actually matches the
    protocol set by virtio_net_hdr_set_proto. Note that since the protocol
    is only checked if skb->dev implements header_ops->parse_protocol,
    packets from devices without the implementation are not checked at this
    stage.

    net: Fix gro aggregation for udp encaps with zero csum
    
    commit 89e5c58fc1e2857ccdaae506fb8bc5fed57ee063 upstream.
    
    We noticed a GRO issue for UDP-based encaps such as vxlan/geneve when the
    csum for the UDP header itself is 0. In that case, GRO aggregation does
    not take place on the phys dev, but instead is deferred to the vxlan/geneve
    driver (see trace below).
    
    The reason is essentially that GRO aggregation bails out in udp_gro_receive()
    for such case when drivers marked the skb with CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY (ice, i40e,
    others) where for non-zero csums 2abb7cdc0dc8 ("udp: Add support for doing
    checksum unnecessary conversion") promotes those skbs to CHECKSUM_COMPLETE
    and napi context has csum_valid set. This is however not the case for zero
    UDP csum (here: csum_cnt is still 0 and csum_valid continues to be false).
    
    At the same time 57c67ff4bd92 ("udp: additional GRO support") added matches
    on !uh->check ^ !uh2->check as part to determine candidates for aggregation,
    so it certainly is expected to handle zero csums in udp_gro_receive(). The
    purpose of the check added via 662880f44203 ("net: Allow GRO to use and set
    levels of checksum unnecessary") seems to catch bad csum and stop aggregation
    right away.
    
    One way to fix aggregation in the zero case is to only perform the !csum_valid
    check in udp_gro_receive() if uh->check is infact non-zero.

    ath9k: fix transmitting to stations in dynamic SMPS mode
    
    commit 3b9ea7206d7e1fdd7419cbd10badd3b2c80d04b4 upstream.
    
    When transmitting to a receiver in dynamic SMPS mode, all transmissions that
    use multiple spatial streams need to be sent using CTS-to-self or RTS/CTS to
    give the receiver's extra chains some time to wake up.
    This fixes the tx rate getting stuck at <= MCS7 for some clients, especially
    Intel ones, which make aggressive use of SMPS.

    powerpc/pseries: Don't enforce MSI affinity with kdump
    
    commit f9619d5e5174867536b7e558683bc4408eab833f upstream.
    
    Depending on the number of online CPUs in the original kernel, it is
    likely for CPU #0 to be offline in a kdump kernel. The associated IRQs
    in the affinity mappings provided by irq_create_affinity_masks() are
    thus not started by irq_startup(), as per-design with managed IRQs.
    
    This can be a problem with multi-queue block devices driven by blk-mq :
    such a non-started IRQ is very likely paired with the single queue
    enforced by blk-mq during kdump (see blk_mq_alloc_tag_set()). This
    causes the device to remain silent and likely hangs the guest at
    some point.
    
    This is a regression caused by commit 9ea69a55b3b9 ("powerpc/pseries:
    Pass MSI affinity to irq_create_mapping()"). Note that this only happens
    with the XIVE interrupt controller because XICS has a workaround to bypass
    affinity, which is activated during kdump with the "noirqdistrib" kernel
    parameter.
    
    The issue comes from a combination of factors:
    - discrepancy between the number of queues detected by the multi-queue
      block driver, that was used to create the MSI vectors, and the single
      queue mode enforced later on by blk-mq because of kdump (i.e. keeping
      all queues fixes the issue)
    - CPU#0 offline (i.e. kdump always succeed with CPU#0)
    
    Given that I couldn't reproduce on x86, which seems to always have CPU#0
    online even during kdump, I'm not sure where this should be fixed. Hence
    going for another approach : fine-grained affinity is for performance
    and we don't really care about that during kdump. Simply revert to the
    previous working behavior of ignoring affinity masks in this case only.

    The above trace shows that while the CPU was handling a performance
    monitor exception, there was a call to security_perf_event_open()
    function. In powerpc core-book3s, this function is called from
    perf_allow_kernel() check during recording of data address in the
    sample via perf_get_data_addr().
    
    Commit da97e18458fb ("perf_event: Add support for LSM and SELinux
    checks") introduced security enhancements to perf. As part of this
    commit, the new security hook for perf_event_open() was added in all
    places where perf paranoid check was previously used. In powerpc
    core-book3s code, originally had paranoid checks in
    perf_get_data_addr() and power_pmu_bhrb_read(). So
    perf_paranoid_kernel() checks were replaced with perf_allow_kernel()
    in these PMU helper functions as well.
    
    The intention of paranoid checks in core-book3s was to verify
    privilege access before capturing some of the sample data. Along with
    paranoid checks, perf_allow_kernel() also does a
    security_perf_event_open(). Since these functions are accessed while
    recording a sample, we end up calling selinux_perf_event_open() in PMI
    context. Some of the security functions use spinlock like
    sidtab_sid2str_put(). If a perf interrupt hits under a spin lock and
    if we end up in calling selinux hook functions in PMI handler, this
    could cause a dead lock.
    
    Since the purpose of this security hook is to control access to
    perf_event_open(), it is not right to call this in interrupt context.
    
    The paranoid checks in powerpc core-book3s were done at interrupt time
    which is also not correct.
    
    Reference commits:
      Commit cd1231d7035f ("powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak via perf_get_data_addr()")
      Commit bb19af816025 ("powerpc/perf: Prevent kernel address leak to userspace via BHRB buffer")
    
    We only allow creation of events that have already passed the
    privilege checks in perf_event_open(). So these paranoid checks are
    not needed at event time. As a fix, patch uses
    'event->attr.exclude_kernel' check to prevent exposing kernel address
    for userspace only sampling.

    uapi: nfnetlink_cthelper.h: fix userspace compilation error
    
    commit c33cb0020ee6dd96cc9976d6085a7d8422f6dbed upstream.
    
    Apparently, <linux/netfilter/nfnetlink_cthelper.h> and
    <linux/netfilter/nfnetlink_acct.h> could not be included into the same
    compilation unit because of a cut-and-paste typo in the former header.
