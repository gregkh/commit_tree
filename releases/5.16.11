    When the KCONFIG_AUTOCONFIG is specified (e.g. export \
    KCONFIG_AUTOCONFIG=output/config/auto.conf), the directory of
    include/config/ will not be created, so kconfig can't create deps
    files in it and auto.conf can't be generated.

    net: macb: Align the dma and coherent dma masks
    
    [ Upstream commit 37f7860602b5b2d99fc7465f6407f403f5941988 ]
    
    Single page and coherent memory blocks can use different DMA masks
    when the macb accesses physical memory directly. The kernel is clever
    enough to allocate pages that fit into the requested address width.
    
    When using the ARM SMMU, the DMA mask must be the same for single
    pages and big coherent memory blocks. Otherwise the translation
    tables turn into one big mess.

    memory mappings, this commit always aligns DMA and coherent masks.

    drm/amd/display: Cap pflip irqs per max otg number
    
    [ Upstream commit 328e34a5ad227399391891d454043e5d73e598d2 ]
    
    [Why]
    pflip interrupt order are mapped 1 to 1 to otg id.
    e.g. if irq_src=26 corresponds to otg0 then 27->otg1, 28->otg2...
    
    Linux DM registers pflip interrupts per number of crtcs.
    In fused pipe case crtc numbers can be less than otg id.
    
    e.g. if one pipe out of 3(otg#0-2) is fused adev->mode_info.num_crtc=2
    so DM only registers irq_src 26,27.
    This is a bug since if pipe#2 remains unfused DM never gets
    otg2 pflip interrupt (irq_src=28)
    That may results in gfx failure due to pflip timeout.
    
    [How]
    Register pflip interrupts per max num of otg instead of num_crtc

    tracing: Fix tp_printk option related with tp_printk_stop_on_boot
    
    [ Upstream commit 3203ce39ac0b2a57a84382ec184c7d4a0bede175 ]
    
    The kernel parameter "tp_printk_stop_on_boot" starts with "tp_printk" which is
    the same as another kernel parameter "tp_printk". If "tp_printk" setup is
    called before the "tp_printk_stop_on_boot", it will override the latter
    and keep it from being set.
    
    This is similar to other kernel parameter issues, such as:
      Commit 745a600cf1a6 ("um: console: Ignore console= option")
    or init/do_mounts.c:45 (setup function of "ro" kernel param)
    
    Fix it by checking for a "_" right after the "tp_printk" and if that
    exists do not process the parameter.

    kconfig: let 'shell' return enough output for deep path names
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a4c5b2a6d8ea079fa36034e8167de87ab6f8880 ]
    
    The 'shell' built-in only returns the first 256 bytes of the command's
    output. In some cases, 'shell' is used to return a path; by bumping up
    the buffer size to 4096 this lets us capture up to PATH_MAX.
    
    The specific case where I ran into this was due to commit 1e860048c53e
    ("gcc-plugins: simplify GCC plugin-dev capability test"). After this
    change, we now use `$(shell,$(CC) -print-file-name=plugin)` to return
    a path; if the gcc path is particularly long, then the path ends up
    truncated at the 256 byte mark, which makes the HAVE_GCC_PLUGINS
    depends test always fail.

    ACPI: PM: Revert "Only mark EC GPE for wakeup on Intel systems"
    
    [ Upstream commit d6ebb17ccc7b37872a32bc25b4a21f1e5af8c7e3 ]
    
    Testing on various upcoming OEM systems shows commit 7b167c4cb48e ("ACPI:
    PM: Only mark EC GPE for wakeup on Intel systems") was short
    sighted and the symptoms were indicative of other problems. Some OEMs
    do have the dedicated GPIOs for the power button but also rely upon
    an interrupt to the EC SCI to let the lid work.
    
    The original commit showed spurious activity on Lenovo systems:
         * On both Lenovo T14 and P14s the keyboard wakeup doesn't work, and
           sometimes the power button event doesn't work.
    
    This was confirmed on my end at that time.
    
    However further development in the kernel showed that the issue was
    actually the IRQ for the GPIO controller was also shared with the EC SCI.
    This was actually fixed by commit 2d54067fcd23 ("pinctrl: amd: Fix
    wakeups when IRQ is shared with SCI").
    
    The original commit also showed problems with AC adapter:
         * On HP 635 G7 detaching or attaching AC during suspend will cause
           the system not to wakeup
         * On Asus vivobook to prevent detaching AC causing resume problems
         * On Lenovo 14ARE05 to prevent detaching AC causing resume problems
         * On HP ENVY x360  to prevent detaching AC causing resume problems
    
    Detaching AC adapter causing problems appears to have been a problem
    because the EC SCI went off to notify the OS of the power adapter change
    but the SCI was ignored and there was no other way to wake up this system
    since GPIO controller wasn't properly enabled.  The wakeups were fixed by
    enabling the GPIO controller in commit acd47b9f28e5 ("pinctrl: amd: Handle
    wake-up interrupt").
    
    I've confirmed on a variety of OEM notebooks with the following test
    
     1) echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/power/pm_debug_messages
     2) sudo systemctl suspend
     3) unplug AC adapter, make sure system is still asleep
     4) wake system from lid (which is provided by ACPI SCI on some of them)
     5) dmesg
        a) see the EC GPE dispatched, timekeeping for X seconds (matching ~time
           until AC adapter plug out)
        b) see timekeeping for Y seconds until woke (matching ~time from AC
           adapter until lid event)
     6) Look at /sys/kernel/debug/amd_pmc/s0ix_stats
        "Time (in us) in S0i3" = X + Y - firmware processing time

    mm: io_uring: allow oom-killer from io_uring_setup
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a3f1e0beacf6cc8ae5f846b0641c1df476e83d6 ]
    
    On an overcommitted system which is running multiple workloads of
    varying priorities, it is preferred to trigger an oom-killer to kill a
    low priority workload than to let the high priority workload receiving
    ENOMEMs. On our memory overcommitted systems, we are seeing a lot of
    ENOMEMs instead of oom-kills because io_uring_setup callchain is using
    __GFP_NORETRY gfp flag which avoids the oom-killer. Let's remove it and

    selftests: fixup build warnings in pidfd / clone3 tests
    
    [ Upstream commit e2aa5e650b07693477dff554053605976789fd68 ]
    
    These are some trivial fixups, which were needed to build the tests with
    clang and -Werror. The following issues are fixed:
    
    - Remove various unused variables.
    - In child_poll_leader_exit_test, clang isn't smart enough to realize
      syscall(SYS_exit, 0) won't return, so it complains we never return
      from a non-void function. Add an extra exit(0) to appease it.
    - In test_pidfd_poll_leader_exit, ret may be branched on despite being
      uninitialized, if we have !use_waitpid. Initialize it to zero to get
      the right behavior in that case.

    pidfd: fix test failure due to stack overflow on some arches
    
    [ Upstream commit 4cbd93c3c110447adc66cb67c08af21f939ae2d7 ]
    
    When running the pidfd_fdinfo_test on arm64, it fails for me. After some
    digging, the reason is that the child exits due to SIGBUS, because it
    overflows the 1024 byte stack we've reserved for it.
    
    To fix the issue, increase the stack size to 8192 bytes (this number is
    somewhat arbitrary, and was arrived at through experimentation -- I kept
    doubling until the failure no longer occurred).
    
    Also, let's make the issue easier to debug. wait_for_pid() returns an
    ambiguous value: it may return -1 in all of these cases:
    
    1. waitpid() itself returned -1
    2. waitpid() returned success, but we found !WIFEXITED(status).
    3. The child process exited, but it did so with a -1 exit code.
    
    There's no way for the caller to tell the difference. So, at least log
    which occurred, so the test runner can debug things.
    
    While debugging this, I found that we had !WIFEXITED(), because the
    child exited due to a signal. This seems like a reasonably common case,
    so also print out whether or not we have WIFSIGNALED(), and the
    associated WTERMSIG() (if any). This lets us see the SIGBUS I'm fixing
    clearly when it occurs.
    
    Finally, I'm suspicious of allocating the child's stack on our stack.
    man clone(2) suggests that the correct way to do this is with mmap(),
    and in particular by setting MAP_STACK. So, switch to doing it that way
    instead.

    x86/bug: Merge annotate_reachable() into _BUG_FLAGS() asm
    
    [ Upstream commit bfb1a7c91fb7758273b4a8d735313d9cc388b502 ]
    
    In __WARN_FLAGS(), we had two asm statements (abbreviated):
    
      asm volatile("ud2");
      asm volatile(".pushsection .discard.reachable");
    
    These pair of statements are used to trigger an exception, but then help
    objtool understand that for warnings, control flow will be restored
    immediately afterwards.
    
    The problem is that volatile is not a compiler barrier. GCC explicitly
    documents this:
    
    > Note that the compiler can move even volatile asm instructions
    > relative to other code, including across jump instructions.
    
    Also, no clobbers are specified to prevent instructions from subsequent
    statements from being scheduled by compiler before the second asm
    statement. This can lead to instructions from subsequent statements
    being emitted by the compiler before the second asm statement.
    
    Providing a scheduling model such as via -march= options enables the
    compiler to better schedule instructions with known latencies to hide
    latencies from data hazards compared to inline asm statements in which
    latencies are not estimated.
    
    If an instruction gets scheduled by the compiler between the two asm
    statements, then objtool will think that it is not reachable, producing
    a warning.
    
    To prevent instructions from being scheduled in between the two asm
    statements, merge them.
    
    Also remove an unnecessary unreachable() asm annotation from BUG() in
    favor of __builtin_unreachable(). objtool is able to track that the ud2
    from BUG() terminates control flow within the function.

    [ Upstream commit 1d4df649cbb4b26d19bea38ecff4b65b10a1bbca ]
    
    The thead,c900-plic has been used in opensbi to distinguish
    PLIC [1]. Although PLICs have the same behaviors in Linux,
    they are different hardware with some custom initializing in
    firmware(opensbi).
    
    Qute opensbi patch commit-msg by Samuel:
    
      The T-HEAD PLIC implementation requires setting a delegation bit
      to allow access from S-mode. Now that the T-HEAD PLIC has its own
      compatible string, set this bit automatically from the PLIC driver,
      instead of reaching into the PLIC's MMIO space from another driver.

    phy: usb: Leave some clocks running during suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 42fed57046fc74586d7058bd51a1c10ac9c690cb ]
    
    The PHY client driver does a phy_exit() call on suspend or rmmod and
    the PHY driver needs to know the difference because some clocks need
    to be kept running for suspend but can be shutdown on unbind/rmmod
    (or if there are no PHY clients at all).
    
    The fix is to use a PM notifier so the driver can tell if a PHY
    client is calling exit() because of a system suspend or a driver
    unbind/rmmod.

    [ Upstream commit 7c174f305cbee6bdba5018aae02b84369e7ab995 ]
    
    The find_arch_event() returns a "unsigned int" value,
    which is used by the pmc_reprogram_counter() to
    program a PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE type perf_event.
    
    The returned value is actually the kernel defined generic
    perf_hw_id, let's rename it to pmc_perf_hw_id() with simpler
    incoming parameters for better self-explanation.

    lockdep: Correct lock_classes index mapping
    
    commit 28df029d53a2fd80c1b8674d47895648ad26dcfb upstream.
    
    A kernel exception was hit when trying to dump /proc/lockdep_chains after

    Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00054005450e05c3

    The lock_classes[-1] located at chain_hlocks array. When printing

    ice: enable parsing IPSEC SPI headers for RSS
    
    commit 86006f996346e8a5a1ea80637ec949ceeea4ecbc upstream.
    
    The COMMS package can enable the hardware parser to recognize IPSEC
    frames with ESP header and SPI identifier.  If this package is available
    and configured for loading in /lib/firmware, then the driver will
    succeed in enabling this protocol type for RSS.
    
    This in turn allows the hardware to hash over the SPI and use it to pick
    a consistent receive queue for the same secure flow. Without this all
    traffic is steered to the same queue for multiple traffic threads from
    the same IP address. For that reason this is marked as a fix, as the
    driver supports the model, but it wasn't enabled.
    
    If the package is not available, adding this type will fail, but the
    failure is ignored on purpose as it has no negative affect.

    ASoC: wm_adsp: Correct control read size when parsing compressed buffer
    
    commit a887f9c7a4d37a8e874ba8415a42a92a1b5139fc upstream.
    
    When parsing the compressed stream the whole buffer descriptor is
    now read in a single cs_dsp_coeff_read_ctrl; on older firmwares
    this descriptor is just 4 bytes but on more modern firmwares it is
    24 bytes. The current code reads the full 24 bytes regardless, this
    was working but reading junk for the last 20 bytes. However commit
    f444da38ac92 ("firmware: cs_dsp: Add offset to cs_dsp read/write")
    added a size check into cs_dsp_coeff_read_ctrl, causing the older
    firmwares to now return an error.
    
    Update the code to only read the amount of data appropriate for
    the firmware loaded.

    scsi: qedi: Fix ABBA deadlock in qedi_process_tmf_resp() and qedi_process_cmd_cleanup_resp()
    
    commit f10f582d28220f50099d3f561116256267821429 upstream.
    
    This fixes a deadlock added with commit b40f3894e39e ("scsi: qedi: Complete
    TMF works before disconnect")
    
    Bug description from Jia-Ju Bai:
    
    qedi_process_tmf_resp()
      spin_lock(&session->back_lock); --> Line 201 (Lock A)
      spin_lock(&qedi_conn->tmf_work_lock); --> Line 230 (Lock B)
    
    qedi_process_cmd_cleanup_resp()
      spin_lock_bh(&qedi_conn->tmf_work_lock); --> Line 752 (Lock B)
      spin_lock_bh(&conn->session->back_lock); --> Line 784 (Lock A)
    
    When qedi_process_tmf_resp() and qedi_process_cmd_cleanup_resp() are
    concurrently executed, the deadlock can occur.
    
    This patch fixes the deadlock by not holding the tmf_work_lock in
    qedi_process_cmd_cleanup_resp while holding the back_lock. The
    tmf_work_lock is only needed while we remove the tmf_work from the
    work_list.

    One way to solve this problem is to move the fd_install() call out of
    the sighand->siglock critical section.
    
    Before commit 6fd2fe494b17 ("copy_process(): don't use ksys_close()
    on cleanups"), the pidfd installation was done without holding both
    the task_list lock and the sighand->siglock. Obviously, holding these
    two locks are not really needed to protect the fd_install() call.
    So move the fd_install() call down to after the releases of both locks.

    dmaengine: ptdma: Fix the error handling path in pt_core_init()
    
    commit 3c62fd3406e0b2277c76a6984d3979c7f3f1d129 upstream.
    
    In order to free resources correctly in the error handling path of
    pt_core_init(), 2 goto's have to be switched. Otherwise, some resources
    will leak and we will try to release things that have not been allocated
    yet.
    
    Also move a dev_err() to a place where it is more meaningful.

    i2c: qcom-cci: don't put a device tree node before i2c_add_adapter()
    
    commit 02a4a69667a2ad32f3b52ca906f19628fbdd8a01 upstream.
    
    There is a minor chance for a race, if a pointer to an i2c-bus subnode
    is stored and then reused after releasing its reference, and it would
    be sufficient to get one more reference under a loop over children
    subnodes.

    i2c: qcom-cci: don't delete an unregistered adapter
    
    commit a0d48505a1d68e27220369e2dd1e3573a2f362d2 upstream.
    
    If i2c_add_adapter() fails to add an I2C adapter found on QCOM CCI
    controller, on error path i2c_del_adapter() is still called.
    
    Fortunately there is a sanity check in the I2C core, so the only
    visible implication is a printed debug level message:
    
        i2c-core: attempting to delete unregistered adapter [Qualcomm-CCI]
    
    Nevertheless it would be reasonable to correct the probe error path.

    tests: fix idmapped mount_setattr test
    
    commit d1c56bfdaca465bd1d0e913053a9c5cafe8b6a6c upstream.
    
    The test treated zero as a successful run when it really should treat
    non-zero as a successful run. A mount's idmapping can't change once it
    has been attached to the filesystem.

    net: sched: limit TC_ACT_REPEAT loops
    
    commit 5740d068909676d4bdb5c9c00c37a83df7728909 upstream.
    
    We have been living dangerously, at the mercy of malicious users,
    abusing TC_ACT_REPEAT, as shown by this syzpot report [1].
    
    Add an arbitrary limit (32) to the number of times an action can
    return TC_ACT_REPEAT.
    
    v2: switch the limit to 32 instead of 10.
        Use net_warn_ratelimited() instead of pr_err_once().

    ucounts: Move RLIMIT_NPROC handling after set_user
    
    commit c923a8e7edb010da67424077cbf1a6f1396ebd2e upstream.
    
    During set*id() which cred->ucounts to charge the the current process
    to is not known until after set_cred_ucounts.  So move the
    RLIMIT_NPROC checking into a new helper flag_nproc_exceeded and call
    flag_nproc_exceeded after set_cred_ucounts.
    
    This is very much an arbitrary subset of the places where we currently
    change the RLIMIT_NPROC accounting, designed to preserve the existing
    logic.
    
    Fixing the existing logic will be the subject of another series of
    changes.

    In commit 2863643fb8b9 ("set_user: add capability check when
    rlimit(RLIMIT_NPROC) exceeds") capable calls were added to set_user to
    make it more consistent with fork.  Unfortunately because of call site
    differences those capable calls were checking the credentials of the
    user before set*id() instead of after set*id().
    
    This breaks enforcement of RLIMIT_NPROC for applications that set the
    rlimit and then call set*id() while holding a full set of
    capabilities.  The capabilities are only changed in the new credential
    in security_task_fix_setuid().
    
    The code in apache suexec appears to follow this pattern.
    
    Commit 909cc4ae86f3 ("[PATCH] Fix two bugs with process limits
    (RLIMIT_NPROC)") where this check was added describes the targes of this
    capability check as:
    
      2/ When a root-owned process (e.g. cgiwrap) sets up process limits and then
          calls setuid, the setuid should fail if the user would then be running
          more than rlim_cur[RLIMIT_NPROC] processes, but it doesn't.  This patch
          adds an appropriate test.  With this patch, and per-user process limit
          imposed in cgiwrap really works.
    
    So the original use case of this check also appears to match the broken
    pattern.
    
    Restore the enforcement of RLIMIT_NPROC by removing the bad capable
    checks added in set_user.  This unfortunately restores the
    inconsistent state the code has been in for the last 11 years, but
    dealing with the inconsistencies looks like a larger problem.

    This can be fixed either by fixing the test or by moving the increment
    to be before the test.  Fix it my moving copy_creds which contains
    the increment before is_ucounts_overlimit.
    
    In the case of CLONE_NEWUSER the ucounts in the task_cred changes.
    The function is_ucounts_overlimit needs to use the final version of
    the ucounts for the new process.  Which means moving the
    is_ucounts_overlimit test after copy_creds is necessary.
    
    Both the test in fork and the test in set_user were semantically
    changed when the code moved to ucounts.  The change of the test in
    fork was bad because it was before the increment.  The test in
    set_user was wrong and the change to ucounts fixed it.  So this
    fix only restores the old behavior in one lcation not two.

    ucounts: Handle wrapping in is_ucounts_overlimit
    
    commit 0cbae9e24fa7d6c6e9f828562f084da82217a0c5 upstream.
    
    While examining is_ucounts_overlimit and reading the various messages
    I realized that is_ucounts_overlimit fails to deal with counts that
    may have wrapped.
    
    Being wrapped should be a transitory state for counts and they should
    never be wrapped for long, but it can happen so handle it.

    I looked at cred->ucount and it is only used for rlimit operations
    that were previously stored in cred->user.  Making the fact
    cred->ucount can refer to a different user from cred->user a bug,
    affecting all uses of cred->ulimit not just RLIMIT_NPROC.
    
    Fix set_cred_ucounts to always use the real uid not the effective uid.
    
    Further simplify set_cred_ucounts by noticing that set_cred_ucounts
    somehow retained a draft version of the check to see if alloc_ucounts
    was needed that checks the new->user and new->user_ns against the
    current_real_cred().  Remove that draft version of the check.
    
    All that matters for setting the cred->ucounts are the user_ns and uid
    fields in the cred.

    x86/ptrace: Fix xfpregs_set()'s incorrect xmm clearing
    
    commit 44cad52cc14ae10062f142ec16ede489bccf4469 upstream.
    
    xfpregs_set() handles 32-bit REGSET_XFP and 64-bit REGSET_FP. The actual
    code treats these regsets as modern FX state (i.e. the beginning part of
    XSTATE). The declarations of the regsets thought they were the legacy
    i387 format. The code thought they were the 32-bit (no xmm8..15) variant
    of XSTATE and, for good measure, made the high bits disappear by zeroing
    the wrong part of the buffer. The latter broke ptrace, and everything
    else confused anyone trying to understand the code. In particular, the
    nonsense definitions of the regsets confused me when I wrote this code.
    
    Clean this all up. Change the declarations to match reality (which
    shouldn't change the generated code, let alone the ABI) and fix
    xfpregs_set() to clear the correct bits and to only do so for 32-bit
    callers.

    EDAC: Fix calculation of returned address and next offset in edac_align_ptr()
    
    commit f8efca92ae509c25e0a4bd5d0a86decea4f0c41e upstream.
    
    Do alignment logic properly and use the "ptr" local variable for
    calculating the remainder of the alignment.
    
    This became an issue because struct edac_mc_layer has a size that is not
    zero modulo eight, and the next offset that was prepared for the private
    data was unaligned, causing an alignment exception.
    
    The patch in Fixes: which broke this actually wanted to "what we
    actually care about is the alignment of the actual pointer that's about
    to be returned." But it didn't check that alignment.
    
    Use the correct variable "ptr" for that.

    commit 7f4c5a26f735dea4bbc0eb8eb9da99cda95a8563 upstream.
    
    When connected point to point, the driver does not know the FC4's supported
    by the other end. In Fabrics, it can query the nameserver.  Thus the driver
    must send PRLIs for the FC4s it supports and enable support based on the
    acc(ept) or rej(ect) of the respective FC4 PRLI.  Currently the driver
    supports SCSI and NVMe PRLIs.
    
    Unfortunately, although the behavior is per standard, many devices have
    come to expect only SCSI PRLIs. In this particular example, the NVMe PRLI
    is properly RJT'd but the target decided that it must LOGO after seeing the
    unexpected NVMe PRLI. The LOGO causes the sequence to restart and login is
    now in an infinite failure loop.
    
    Fix the problem by having the driver, on a pt2pt link, remember NVMe PRLI
    accept or reject status across logout as long as the link stays "up".  When
    retrying login, if the prior NVMe PRLI was rejected, it will not be sent on
    the next login.

    mtd: rawnand: brcmnand: Fixed incorrect sub-page ECC status
    
    commit 36415a7964711822e63695ea67fede63979054d9 upstream.
    
    The brcmnand driver contains a bug in which if a page (example 2k byte)
    is read from the parallel/ONFI NAND and within that page a subpage (512
    byte) has correctable errors which is followed by a subpage with
    uncorrectable errors, the page read will return the wrong status of
    correctable (as opposed to the actual status of uncorrectable.)
    
    The bug is in function brcmnand_read_by_pio where there is a check for
    uncorrectable bits which will be preempted if a previous status for
    correctable bits is detected.
    
    The fix is to stop checking for bad bits only if we already have a bad
    bits status.

    mtd: phram: Prevent divide by zero bug in phram_setup()
    
    commit 3e3765875b1b8864898603768fd5c93eeb552211 upstream.
    
    The problem is that "erasesize" is a uint64_t type so it might be
    non-zero but the lower 32 bits are zero so when it's truncated,
    "(uint32_t)erasesize", then that value is zero. This leads to a
    divide by zero bug.
    
    Avoid the bug by delaying the divide until after we have validated
    that "erasesize" is non-zero and within the uint32_t range.

    mtd: rawnand: qcom: Fix clock sequencing in qcom_nandc_probe()
    
    commit 5c23b3f965bc9ee696bf2ed4bdc54d339dd9a455 upstream.
    
    Interacting with a NAND chip on an IPQ6018 I found that the qcomsmem NAND
    partition parser was returning -EPROBE_DEFER waiting for the main smem
    driver to load.
    
    This caused the board to reset. Playing about with the probe() function
    shows that the problem lies in the core clock being switched off before the
    nandc_unalloc() routine has completed.
    
    If we look at how qcom_nandc_remove() tears down allocated resources we see
    the expected order is
    
    qcom_nandc_unalloc(nandc);
    
    clk_disable_unprepare(nandc->aon_clk);
    clk_disable_unprepare(nandc->core_clk);
    
    dma_unmap_resource(&pdev->dev, nandc->base_dma, resource_size(res),
                       DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL, 0);
    
    Tweaking probe() to both bring up and tear-down in that order removes the
    reset if we end up deferring elsewhere.

    tty: n_tty: do not look ahead for EOL character past the end of the buffer
    
    commit 3593030761630e09200072a4bd06468892c27be3 upstream.
    
    Daniel Gibson reports that the n_tty code gets line termination wrong in
    very specific cases:
    
     "If you feed a line with exactly 64 chars + terminating newline, and
      directly afterwards (without reading) another line into a pseudo
      terminal, the the first read() on the other side will return the 64
      char line *without* terminating newline, and the next read() will
      return the missing terminating newline AND the complete next line (if
      it fits in the buffer)"
    
    and bisected the behavior to commit 3b830a9c34d5 ("tty: convert
    tty_ldisc_ops 'read()' function to take a kernel pointer").
    
    Now, digging deeper, it turns out that the behavior isn't exactly new:
    what changed in commit 3b830a9c34d5 was that the tty line discipline
    .read() function is now passed an intermediate kernel buffer rather than
    the final user space buffer.
    
    And that intermediate kernel buffer is 64 bytes in size - thus that
    special case with exactly 64 bytes plus terminating newline.
    
    The same problem did exist before, but historically the boundary was not
    the 64-byte chunk, but the user-supplied buffer size, which is obviously
    generally bigger (and potentially bigger than N_TTY_BUF_SIZE, which
    would hide the issue entirely).
    
    The reason is that the n_tty canon_copy_from_read_buf() code would look
    ahead for the EOL character one byte further than it would actually
    copy.  It would then decide that it had found the terminator, and unmark
    it as an EOL character - which in turn explains why the next read
    wouldn't then be terminated by it.
    
    Now, the reason it did all this in the first place is related to some
    historical and pretty obscure EOF behavior, see commit ac8f3bf8832a
    ("n_tty: Fix poll() after buffer-limited eof push read") and commit
    40d5e0905a03 ("n_tty: Fix EOF push handling").
    
    And the reason for the EOL confusion is that we treat EOF as a special
    EOL condition, with the EOL character being NUL (aka "__DISABLED_CHAR"
    in the kernel sources).
    
    So that EOF look-ahead also affects the normal EOL handling.
    
    This patch just removes the look-ahead that causes problems, because EOL
    is much more critical than the historical "EOF in the middle of a line
    that coincides with the end of the buffer" handling ever was.
    
    Now, it is possible that we should indeed re-introduce the "look at next
    character to see if it's a EOF" behavior, but if so, that should be done
    not at the kernel buffer chunk boundary in canon_copy_from_read_buf(),
    but at a higher level, when we run out of the user buffer.
    
    In particular, the place to do that would be at the top of
    'n_tty_read()', where we check if it's a continuation of a previously
    started read, and there is no more buffer space left, we could decide to
    just eat the __DISABLED_CHAR at that point.
    
    But that would be a separate patch, because I suspect nobody actually
    cares, and I'd like to get a report about it before bothering.

    bfq_exit_queue(). Only re-enable wbt when bfq exit.

    ASoC: qcom: Actually clear DMA interrupt register for HDMI
    
    commit c8d251f51ee61df06ee0e419348d8c9160bbfb86 upstream.
    
    In commit da0363f7bfd3 ("ASoC: qcom: Fix for DMA interrupt clear reg
    overwriting") we changed regmap_write() to regmap_update_bits() so that
    we can avoid overwriting bits that we didn't intend to modify.
    Unfortunately this change breaks the case where a register is writable
    but not readable, which is exactly how the HDMI irq clear register is
    designed (grep around LPASS_HDMITX_APP_IRQCLEAR_REG to see how it's
    write only). That's because regmap_update_bits() tries to read the
    register from the hardware and if it isn't readable it looks in the
    regmap cache to see what was written there last time to compare against
    what we want to write there. Eventually, we're unable to modify this
    register at all because the bits that we're trying to set are already
    set in the cache.
    
    This is doubly bad for the irq clear register because you have to write
    the bit to clear an interrupt. Given the irq is level triggered, we see
    an interrupt storm upon plugging in an HDMI cable and starting audio
    playback. The irq storm is so great that performance degrades
    significantly, leading to CPU soft lockups.
    
    Fix it by using regmap_write_bits() so that we really do write the bits
    in the clear register that we want to. This brings the number of irqs
    handled by lpass_dma_interrupt_handler() down from ~150k/sec to ~10/sec.

    scsi: ufs: Fix a deadlock in the error handler
    
    commit 945c3cca05d78351bba29fa65d93834cb7934c7b upstream.
    
    The following deadlock has been observed on a test setup:
    
     - All tags allocated
    
     - The SCSI error handler calls ufshcd_eh_host_reset_handler()
    
     - ufshcd_eh_host_reset_handler() queues work that calls
       ufshcd_err_handler()
    
     - ufshcd_err_handler() locks up as follows:
    
    Workqueue: ufs_eh_wq_0 ufshcd_err_handler.cfi_jt
    Call trace:

    powerpc/lib/sstep: fix 'ptesync' build error
    
    commit fe663df7825811358531dc2e8a52d9eaa5e3515e upstream.
    
    Building tinyconfig with gcc (Debian 11.2.0-16) and assembler (Debian
    2.37.90.20220207) the following build error shows up:
    
      {standard input}: Assembler messages:
      {standard input}:2088: Error: unrecognized opcode: `ptesync'
      make[3]: *** [/builds/linux/scripts/Makefile.build:287: arch/powerpc/lib/sstep.o] Error 1
    
    Add the 'ifdef CONFIG_PPC64' around the 'ptesync' in function
    'emulate_update_regs()' to like it is in 'analyse_instr()'. Since it looks like
    it got dropped inadvertently by commit 3cdfcbfd32b9 ("powerpc: Change
    analyse_instr so it doesn't modify *regs").
    
    A key detail is that analyse_instr() will never recognise lwsync or
    ptesync on 32-bit (because of the existing ifdef), and as a result
    emulate_update_regs() should never be called with an op specifying
    either of those on 32-bit. So removing them from emulate_update_regs()
    should be a nop in terms of runtime behaviour.

    powerpc/603: Fix boot failure with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and KFENCE
    
    commit 9bb162fa26ed76031ed0e7dbc77ccea0bf977758 upstream.
    
    Allthough kernel text is always mapped with BATs, we still have
    inittext mapped with pages, so TLB miss handling is required
    when CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC or CONFIG_KFENCE is set.
    
    The final solution should be to set a BAT that also maps inittext
    but that BAT then needs to be cleared at end of init, and it will
    require more changes to be able to do it properly.
    
    As DEBUG_PAGEALLOC or KFENCE are debugging, performance is not a big
    deal so let's fix it simply for now to enable easy stable application.

    commit bfe55a1f7fd6bfede16078bf04c6250fbca11588 upstream.
    
    Add and ACPI idle power level limit for 32-bit ThinkPad T40.
    
    There is a regression on T40 introduced by commit d6b88ce2, starting
    with kernel 5.16:

      ACPI: processor idle: Allow playing dead in C3 state
    
    The above patch is trying to enter C3 state during init, what is causing
    a T40 system freeze. I have not found a similar issue on any other of my
    32-bit machines.
    
    The fix is to add another exception to the processor_power_dmi_table[] list.
    As a result the dmesg shows as expected:
    
    [2.155398] ACPI: IBM ThinkPad T40 detected - limiting to C2 max_cstate. Override with "processor.max_cstate=9"
    [2.155404] ACPI: processor limited to max C-state 2
    
    The fix is trivial and affects only vintage T40 systems.

    commit 6317f7449348a897483a2b4841f7a9190745c81b upstream.
    
    The forced probe mask via probe_mask 0x100 bit doesn't work any longer
    as expected since the bus init code was moved and it's clearing the
    codec_mask value that was set beforehand.  This patch fixes the

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix deadlock by COEF mutex
    
    commit 2a845837e3d0ddaed493b4c5c4643d7f0542804d upstream.
    
    The recently introduced coef_mutex for Realtek codec seems causing a
    deadlock when the relevant code is invoked from the power-off state;
    then the HD-audio core tries to power-up internally, and this kicks
    off the codec runtime PM code that tries to take the same coef_mutex.
    
    In order to avoid the deadlock, do the temporary power up/down around
    the coef_mutex acquisition and release.  This assures that the
    power-up sequence runs before the mutex, hence no re-entrance will
    happen.

    commit 19d20c7a29bf2e46ff1ab8e8c4fcd2da8a4f38e2 upstream.
    
    Commit 83b7dcbc51c930fc2079ab6c6fc9d719768321f1 introduced a generic
    implicit feedback parser, which fails to execute for M-Audio FastTrack
    Ultra sound cards. The issue is with the ENDPOINT_SYNCTYPE check in
    add_generic_implicit_fb() where the SYNCTYPE is ADAPTIVE instead of ASYNC.
    The reason is that the sync type of the FastTrack output endpoints are
    set to adaptive in the quirks table since commit
    65f04443c96dbda11b8fff21d6390e082846aa3c.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Don't abort resume upon errors
    
    commit 9a5adeb28b77416446658e75bdef3bbe5fb92a83 upstream.
    
    The default mixer resume code treats the errors at restoring the
    modified mixer items as a fatal error, and it returns back to the
    caller.  This ends up in the resume failure, and the device will be
    come unavailable, although basically those errors are intermittent and
    can be safely ignored.
    
    The problem itself has been present from the beginning, but it didn't
    hit usually because the code tries to resume only the modified items.
    But now with the recent commit to forcibly initialize each item at the
    probe time, the problem surfaced more often, hence it appears as a
    regression.
    
    This patch fixes the regression simply by ignoring the errors at
    resume.

    net: bridge: multicast: notify switchdev driver whenever MC processing gets disabled
    
    commit c832962ac972082b3a1f89775c9d4274c8cb5670 upstream.
    
    Whenever bridge driver hits the max capacity of MDBs, it disables
    the MC processing (by setting corresponding bridge option), but never
    notifies switchdev about such change (the notifiers are called only upon
    explicit setting of this option, through the registered netlink interface).
    
    This could lead to situation when Software MDB processing gets disabled,
    but this event never gets offloaded to the underlying Hardware.
    
    Fix this by adding a notify message in such case.

    commit 032062f363b4bf02b1d547f329aa5d97b6a17410 upstream.
    
    When a link comes up we add its presence to the name table to make it
    possible for users to subscribe for link up/down events. However, after
    a previous call signature change the binding is wrongly published with
    the peer node as publishing node, instead of the own node as it should
    be. This has the effect that the command 'tipc name table show' will
    list the link binding (service type 2) with node scope and a peer node
    as originator, something that obviously is impossible.

    copies of these callback functions will be overwritten incorrectly,
    resulting in a loop call issue:
    
    clcsk->sk_error_report
     |- smc_fback_error_report() <------------------------------|
         |- smc_fback_forward_wakeup()                          | (loop)
             |- clcsock_callback()  (incorrectly overwritten)   |
                 |- smc->clcsk_error_report() ------------------|
    
    So this patch fixes the issue by saving these function pointers only
    once in the fallback and avoiding overwriting.

    libsubcmd: Fix use-after-free for realloc(..., 0)
    
    commit 52a9dab6d892763b2a8334a568bd4e2c1a6fde66 upstream.
    
    GCC 12 correctly reports a potential use-after-free condition in the
    xrealloc helper. Fix the warning by avoiding an implicit "free(ptr)"
    when size == 0:

    nfp: flower: netdev offload check for ip6gretap
    
    commit 7dbcda584eaa5bdb4a281c379207dacc1a5e6081 upstream.
    
    IPv6 GRE tunnels are not being offloaded, this is caused by a missing
    netdev offload check. The functionality of IPv6 GRE tunnel offloading
    was previously added but this check was not included. Adding the
    ip6gretap check allows IPv6 GRE tunnels to be offloaded correctly.

    bonding: fix data-races around agg_select_timer
    
    commit 9ceaf6f76b203682bb6100e14b3d7da4c0bedde8 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported that two threads might write over agg_select_timer
    at the same time. Make agg_select_timer atomic to fix the races.

    crypto: af_alg - get rid of alg_memory_allocated
    
    commit 25206111512de994dfc914f5b2972a22aa904ef3 upstream.
    
    alg_memory_allocated does not seem to be really used.
    
    alg_proto does have a .memory_allocated field, but no
    corresponding .sysctl_mem.
    
    This means sk_has_account() returns true, but all sk_prot_mem_limits()
    users will trigger a NULL dereference [1].
    
    THis was not a problem until SO_RESERVE_MEM addition.

    annotations to netdev->qdisc, and proper accessors
    to get LOCKDEP support.

    bonding: force carrier update when releasing slave
    
    commit a6ab75cec1e461f8a35559054c146c21428430b8 upstream.
    
    In __bond_release_one(), bond_set_carrier() is only called when bond
    device has no slave. Therefore, if we remove the up slave from a master
    with two slaves and keep the down slave, the master will remain up.
    
    Fix this by moving bond_set_carrier() out of if (!bond_has_slaves(bond))
    statement.
    
    Reproducer:
    $ insmod bonding.ko mode=0 miimon=100 max_bonds=2
    $ ifconfig bond0 up
    $ ifenslave bond0 eth0 eth1
    $ ifconfig eth0 down
    $ ifenslave -d bond0 eth1
    $ cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0

    ping: fix the dif and sdif check in ping_lookup
    
    commit 35a79e64de29e8d57a5989aac57611c0cd29e13e upstream.
    
    When 'ping' changes to use PING socket instead of RAW socket by:
    
       # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 100"
    
    There is another regression caused when matching sk_bound_dev_if
    and dif, RAW socket is using inet_iif() while PING socket lookup
    is using skb->dev->ifindex, the cmd below fails due to this:
    
      # ip link add dummy0 type dummy
      # ip link set dummy0 up
      # ip addr add 192.168.111.1/24 dev dummy0
      # ping -I dummy0 192.168.111.1 -c1
    
    The issue was also reported on:
    
      https://github.com/iputils/iputils/issues/104
    
    But fixed in iputils in a wrong way by not binding to device when
    destination IP is on device, and it will cause some of kselftests
    to fail, as Jianlin noticed.
    
    This patch is to use inet(6)_iif and inet(6)_sdif to get dif and
    sdif for PING socket, and keep consistent with RAW socket.

    net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: flush switchdev FDB workqueue before removing VLAN
    
    commit a2614140dc0f467a83aa3bb4b6ee2d6480a76202 upstream.
    
    mv88e6xxx is special among DSA drivers in that it requires the VTU to
    contain the VID of the FDB entry it modifies in
    mv88e6xxx_port_db_load_purge(), otherwise it will return -EOPNOTSUPP.
    
    Sometimes due to races this is not always satisfied even if external
    code does everything right (first deletes the FDB entries, then the
    VLAN), because DSA commits to hardware FDB entries asynchronously since
    commit c9eb3e0f8701 ("net: dsa: Add support for learning FDB through
    notification").
    
    Therefore, the mv88e6xxx driver must close this race condition by
    itself, by asking DSA to flush the switchdev workqueue of any FDB
    deletions in progress, prior to exiting a VLAN.

    cfg80211: fix race in netlink owner interface destruction
    
    commit f0a6fd1527067da537e9c48390237488719948ed upstream.
    
    My previous fix here to fix the deadlock left a race where
    the exact same deadlock (see the original commit referenced
    below) can still happen if cfg80211_destroy_ifaces() already
    runs while nl80211_netlink_notify() is still marking some
    interfaces as nl_owner_dead.
    
    The race happens because we have two loops here - first we
    dev_close() all the netdevs, and then we destroy them. If we
    also have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)
    then we can find one during the first iteration, close it,
    and go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try
    to destroy also the one we didn't close yet.
    
    Fix this by only iterating once.

    Revert "net: ethernet: bgmac: Use devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname"
    
    commit 6aba04ee3263669b335458c4cf4c7d97d6940229 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 3710e80952cf2dc48257ac9f145b117b5f74e0a5.
    
    Since idm_base and nicpm_base are still optional resources not present
    on all platforms, this breaks the driver for everything except Northstar
    2 (which has both).
    
    The same change was already reverted once with 755f5738ff98 ("net:
    broadcom: fix a mistake about ioremap resource").
    
    So let's do it again.

    ipv6: per-netns exclusive flowlabel checks
    
    commit 0b0dff5b3b98c5c7ce848151df9da0b3cdf0cc8b upstream.
    
    Ipv6 flowlabels historically require a reservation before use.
    Optionally in exclusive mode (e.g., user-private).
    
    Commit 59c820b2317f ("ipv6: elide flowlabel check if no exclusive
    leases exist") introduced a fastpath that avoids this check when no
    exclusive leases exist in the system, and thus any flowlabel use
    will be granted.
    
    That allows skipping the control operation to reserve a flowlabel
    entirely. Though with a warning if the fast path fails:
    
      This is an optimization. Robust applications still have to revert to
      requesting leases if the fast path fails due to an exclusive lease.
    
    Still, this is subtle. Better isolate network namespaces from each
    other. Flowlabels are per-netns. Also record per-netns whether
    exclusive leases are in use. Then behavior does not change based on
    activity in other netns.
    
    Changes
      v2
        - wrap in IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6) to avoid breakage if disabled

    ipv6: mcast: use rcu-safe version of ipv6_get_lladdr()
    
    commit 26394fc118d6115390bd5b3a0fb17096271da227 upstream.
    
    Some time ago 8965779d2c0e ("ipv6,mcast: always hold idev->lock before mca_lock")
    switched ipv6_get_lladdr() to __ipv6_get_lladdr(), which is rcu-unsafe
    version. That was OK, because idev->lock was held for these codepaths.
    
    In 88e2ca308094 ("mld: convert ifmcaddr6 to RCU") these external locks were
    removed, so we probably need to restore the original rcu-safe call.
    
    Otherwise, we occasionally get a machine crashed/stalled with the following
    in dmesg:

    fib_alias_hw_flags_set() can be used by concurrent threads,
    and is only RCU protected.
    
    We need to annotate accesses to following fields of struct fib_alias:
    
        offload, trap, offload_failed
    
    Because of READ_ONCE()WRITE_ONCE() limitations, make these
    field u8.

    selftests: netfilter: disable rp_filter on router
    
    commit bbe4c0896d25009a7c86285d2ab024eed4374eea upstream.
    
    Some distros may enable rp_filter by default. After ns1 change addr to
    10.0.2.99 and set default router to 10.0.2.1, while the connected router
    address is still 10.0.1.1. The router will not reply the arp request
    from ns1. Fix it by setting the router's veth0 rp_filter to 0.
    
    Before the fix:
      # ./nft_fib.sh
      PASS: fib expression did not cause unwanted packet drops
      Netns nsrouter-HQkDORO2 fib counter doesn't match expected packet count of 1 for 1.1.1.1
      table inet filter {
              chain prerouting {
                      type filter hook prerouting priority filter; policy accept;
                      ip daddr 1.1.1.1 fib saddr . iif oif missing counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop
                      ip6 daddr 1c3::c01d fib saddr . iif oif missing counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop
              }
      }
    
    After the fix:
      # ./nft_fib.sh
      PASS: fib expression did not cause unwanted packet drops
      PASS: fib expression did drop packets for 1.1.1.1
      PASS: fib expression did drop packets for 1c3::c01d

    selftests: netfilter: fix exit value for nft_concat_range
    
    commit 2e71ec1a725a794a16e3862791ed43fe5ba6a06b upstream.
    
    When the nft_concat_range test failed, it exit 1 in the code
    specifically.
    
    But when part of, or all of the test passed, it will failed the
    [ ${passed} -eq 0 ] check and thus exit with 1, which is the same
    exit value with failure result. Fix it by exit 0 when passed is not 0.

    iwlwifi: mvm: don't send SAR GEO command for 3160 devices
    
    commit 5f06f6bf8d816578c390a2b8a485d40adcca4749 upstream.
    
    SAR GEO offsets are not supported on 3160 devices.  The code was
    refactored and caused us to start sending the command anyway, which
    causes a FW assertion failure.  Fix that only considering this feature
    supported on FW API with major version is 17 if the device is not
    3160.
    
    Additionally, fix the caller of iwl_mvm_sar_geo_init() so that it
    checks for the return value, which it was ignoring.

    iwlwifi: fix iwl_legacy_rate_to_fw_idx
    
    commit 973f02c932b0be41a26bb9bdf38b7b92721611d2 upstream.
    
    There are a couple of bugs in this function:
    
    1. It is declared as a non-static function, even though
       it's only used in one file.
    2. Its return value should be of type u32 but it returns
       (in some cases) -1.
    
    Fix them by making this function static and returning an
    error value of type unsigned.
    
    In addition, we're assigning the return value of this function
    as the legacy rate even if the function returned an error value.
    Fix this by assigning the lowest rate in this case.

    drm/cma-helper: Set VM_DONTEXPAND for mmap
    
    commit 59f39bfa6553d598cb22f694d45e89547f420d85 upstream.
    
    drm_gem_cma_mmap() cannot assume every implementation of dma_mmap_wc()
    will end up calling remap_pfn_range() (which happens to set the relevant
    vma flag, among others), so in order to make sure expectations around
    VM_DONTEXPAND are met, let it explicitly set the flag like most other
    GEM mmap implementations do.
    
    This avoids repeated warnings on a small minority of systems where the
    display is behind an IOMMU, and has a simple driver which does not
    override drm_gem_cma_default_funcs. Arm hdlcd is an in-tree affected
    driver. Out-of-tree, the Apple DCP driver is affected; this fix is
    required for DCP to be mainlined.

    optee: use driver internal tee_context for some rpc
    
    commit aceeafefff736057e8f93f19bbfbef26abd94604 upstream.
    
    Adds a driver private tee_context by moving the tee_context in struct
    optee_notif to struct optee. This tee_context was previously used when
    doing internal calls to secure world to deliver notification.
    
    The new driver internal tee_context is now also when allocating driver
    private shared memory. This decouples the shared memory object from its
    original tee_context. This is needed when the life time of such a memory
    allocation outlives the client tee_context.
    
    This patch fixes the problem described below:
    
    The addition of a shutdown hook by commit f25889f93184 ("optee: fix tee out
    of memory failure seen during kexec reboot") introduced a kernel shutdown
    regression that can be triggered after running the OP-TEE xtest suites.
    
    Once the shutdown hook is called it is not possible to communicate any more
    with the supplicant process because the system is not scheduling task any
    longer. Thus if the optee driver shutdown path receives a supplicant RPC
    request from the OP-TEE we will deadlock the kernel's shutdown.

    vsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by a signal
    
    commit b9208492fcaecff8f43915529ae34b3bcb03877c upstream.
    
    vsock_connect() expects that the socket could already be in the
    TCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes up with a signal
    pending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and
    it is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it's
    common for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is
    successful the socket will be added to the connected table a second
    time, corrupting the list.
    
    Prevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received
    while waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in
    the connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will
    prevent list corruption from a double add.
    
    Note for backporting: this patch requires d5afa82c977e ("vsock: correct
    removal of socket from the list"), which is in all current stable trees
    except 4.9.y.

    drm/i915: Fix dbuf slice config lookup
    
    commit 698bef8ff5d2edea5d1c9d6e5adf1bfed1e8a106 upstream.

    drm/i915/opregion: check port number bounds for SWSCI display power state
    
    commit ea958422291de248b9e2eaaeea36004e84b64043 upstream.
    
    The mapping from enum port to whatever port numbering scheme is used by
    the SWSCI Display Power State Notification is odd, and the memory of it
    has faded. In any case, the parameter only has space for ports numbered
    [0..4], and UBSAN reports bit shift beyond it when the platform has port
    F or more.
    
    Since the SWSCI functionality is supposed to be obsolete for new
    platforms (i.e. ones that might have port F or more), just bail out
    early if the mapped and mangled port number is beyond what the Display
    Power State Notification can support.

    drm/amdgpu: skipping SDMA hw_init and hw_fini for S0ix.
    
    commit f8f4e2a518347063179def4e64580b2d28233d03 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    SDMA ring buffer test failed if suspend is aborted during
    S0i3 resume.
    
    [How]
    If suspend is aborted for some reason during S0i3 resume
    cycle, it follows SDMA ring test failing and errors in amdgpu
    resume. For RN/CZN/Picasso, SMU saves and restores SDMA
    registers during S0ix cycle. So, skipping SDMA suspend and

    drm/mediatek: mtk_dsi: Avoid EPROBE_DEFER loop with external bridge
    
    commit 647474b8d980256b26b1cd112d7333a4dbd4260a upstream.
    
    DRM bridge drivers are now attaching their DSI device at probe time,
    which requires us to register our DSI host in order to let the bridge
    to probe: this recently started producing an endless -EPROBE_DEFER
    loop on some machines that are using external bridges, like the
    parade-ps8640, found on the ACER Chromebook R13.
    
    Now that the DSI hosts/devices probe sequence is documented, we can
    do adjustments to the mtk_dsi driver as to both fix now and make sure
    to avoid this situation in the future: for this, following what is
    documented in drm_bridge.c, move the mtk_dsi component_add() to the
    mtk_dsi_ops.attach callback and delete it in the detach callback;
    keeping in mind that we are registering a drm_bridge for our DSI,
    which is only used/attached if the DSI Host is bound, it wouldn't
    make sense to keep adding our bridge at probe time (as it would
    be useless to have it if mtk_dsi_ops.attach() fails!), so also move
    that one to the dsi host attach function (and remove it in detach).

    iwlwifi: fix use-after-free
    
    commit bea2662e7818e15d7607d17d57912ac984275d94 upstream.
    
    If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the
    firmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling
    device_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in
    iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However
    the new code I added will still erroneously access it after it
    was freed.
    
    Set 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data
    was already freed anyway.

    KVM: x86: nSVM: mark vmcb01 as dirty when restoring SMM saved state
    
    commit e8efa4ff00374d2e6f47f6e4628ca3b541c001af upstream.
    
    While usually, restoring the smm state makes the KVM enter
    the nested guest thus a different vmcb (vmcb02 vs vmcb01),
    KVM should still mark it as dirty, since hardware
    can in theory cache multiple vmcbs.
    
    Failure to do so, combined with lack of setting the
    nested_run_pending (which is fixed in the next patch),
    might make KVM re-enter vmcb01, which was just exited from,
    with completely different set of guest state registers
    (SMM vs non SMM) and without proper dirty bits set,
    which results in the CPU reusing stale IDTR pointer
    which leads to a guest shutdown on any interrupt.
    
    On the real hardware this usually doesn't happen,
    but when running nested, L0's KVM does check and
    honour few dirty bits, causing this issue to happen.
    
    This patch fixes boot of hyperv and SMM enabled
    windows VM running nested on KVM.

    KVM: x86: nSVM: fix potential NULL derefernce on nested migration
    
    commit e1779c2714c3023e4629825762bcbc43a3b943df upstream.
    
    Turns out that due to review feedback and/or rebases
    I accidentally moved the call to nested_svm_load_cr3 to be too early,
    before the NPT is enabled, which is very wrong to do.
    
    KVM can't even access guest memory at that point as nested NPT
    is needed for that, and of course it won't initialize the walk_mmu,
    which is main issue the patch was addressing.
    
    Fix this for real.

    KVM: x86: SVM: don't passthrough SMAP/SMEP/PKE bits in !NPT && !gCR0.PG case
    
    commit c53bbe2145f51d3bc0438c2db02e737b9b598bf3 upstream.
    
    When the guest doesn't enable paging, and NPT/EPT is disabled, we
    use guest't paging CR3's as KVM's shadow paging pointer and
    we are technically in direct mode as if we were to use NPT/EPT.
    
    In direct mode we create SPTEs with user mode permissions
    because usually in the direct mode the NPT/EPT doesn't
    need to restrict access based on guest CPL
    (there are MBE/GMET extenstions for that but KVM doesn't use them).
    
    In this special "use guest paging as direct" mode however,
    and if CR4.SMAP/CR4.SMEP are enabled, that will make the CPU
    fault on each access and KVM will enter endless loop of page faults.
    
    Since page protection doesn't have any meaning in !PG case,
    just don't passthrough these bits.
    
    The fix is the same as was done for VMX in commit:
    commit 656ec4a4928a ("KVM: VMX: fix SMEP and SMAP without EPT")
    
    This fixes the boot of windows 10 without NPT for good.
    (Without this patch, BSP boots, but APs were stuck in endless
    loop of page faults, causing the VM boot with 1 CPU)

    commit 759cbd59674a6c0aec616a3f4f0740ebd3f5fbef upstream.

    unlike setting the nested state.

    KVM: x86/xen: Fix runstate updates to be atomic when preempting vCPU
    
    commit fcb732d8f8cf6084f8480015ad41d25fb023a4dd upstream.
    
    There are circumstances whem kvm_xen_update_runstate_guest() should not
    sleep because it ends up being called from __schedule() when the vCPU
    is preempted:
    
    [  222.830825]  kvm_xen_update_runstate_guest+0x24/0x100
    [  222.830878]  kvm_arch_vcpu_put+0x14c/0x200
    [  222.830920]  kvm_sched_out+0x30/0x40
    [  222.830960]  __schedule+0x55c/0x9f0
    
    To handle this, make it use the same trick as __kvm_xen_has_interrupt(),
    of using the hva from the gfn_to_hva_cache directly. Then it can use
    pagefault_disable() around the accesses and just bail out if the page
    is absent (which is unlikely).
    
    I almost switched to using a gfn_to_pfn_cache here and bailing out if
    kvm_map_gfn() fails, like kvm_steal_time_set_preempted() does — but on
    closer inspection it looks like kvm_map_gfn() will *always* fail in
    atomic context for a page in IOMEM, which means it will silently fail
    to make the update every single time for such guests, AFAICT. So I
    didn't do it that way after all. And will probably fix that one too.

    [ Upstream commit 042e293e16e3aa9794ce60c29f5b7b0c8170f933 ]
    
    When account() is called, and the amount of entropy dips below

    can write some more in. However, the RNDZAPENTCNT/RNDCLEARPOOL ioctl

    Revert "module, async: async_synchronize_full() on module init iff async is used"
    
    [ Upstream commit 67d6212afda218d564890d1674bab28e8612170f ]
    
    This reverts commit 774a1221e862b343388347bac9b318767336b20b.
    
    We need to finish all async code before the module init sequence is
    done.  In the reverted commit the PF_USED_ASYNC flag was added to mark a
    thread that called async_schedule().  Then the PF_USED_ASYNC flag was
    used to determine whether or not async_synchronize_full() needs to be
    invoked.  This works when modprobe thread is calling async_schedule(),
    but it does not work if module dispatches init code to a worker thread
    which then calls async_schedule().
    
    For example, PCI driver probing is invoked from a worker thread based on
    a node where device is attached:
    
            if (cpu < nr_cpu_ids)
                    error = work_on_cpu(cpu, local_pci_probe, &ddi);
            else
                    error = local_pci_probe(&ddi);
    
    We end up in a situation where a worker thread gets the PF_USED_ASYNC
    flag set instead of the modprobe thread.  As a result,
    async_synchronize_full() is not invoked and modprobe completes without
    waiting for the async code to finish.
    
    The issue was discovered while loading the pm80xx driver:
    (scsi_mod.scan=async)
    
    modprobe pm80xx                      worker
    ...
      do_init_module()
      ...
        pci_call_probe()
          work_on_cpu(local_pci_probe)

            async_synchronize_full();
    
    Commit 21c3c5d28007 ("block: don't request module during elevator init")
    fixed the deadlock issue which the reverted commit 774a1221e862
    ("module, async: async_synchronize_full() on module init iff async is
    used") tried to fix.
    
    Since commit 0fdff3ec6d87 ("async, kmod: warn on synchronous
    request_module() from async workers") synchronous module loading from
    async is not allowed.
    
    Given that the original deadlock issue is fixed and it is no longer
    allowed to call synchronous request_module() from async we can remove
    PF_USED_ASYNC flag to make module init consistently invoke
    async_synchronize_full() unless async module probe is requested.

    x86/Xen: streamline (and fix) PV CPU enumeration
    
    [ Upstream commit e25a8d959992f61b64a58fc62fb7951dc6f31d1f ]
    
    This started out with me noticing that "dom0_max_vcpus=<N>" with <N>
    larger than the number of physical CPUs reported through ACPI tables
    would not bring up the "excess" vCPU-s. Addressing this is the primary
    purpose of the change; CPU maps handling is being tidied only as far as
    is necessary for the change here (with the effect of also avoiding the
    setting up of too much per-CPU infrastructure, i.e. for CPUs which can
    never come online).
    
    Noticing that xen_fill_possible_map() is called way too early, whereas
    xen_filter_cpu_maps() is called too late (after per-CPU areas were
    already set up), and further observing that each of the functions serves
    only one of Dom0 or DomU, it looked like it was better to simplify this.
    Use the .get_smp_config hook instead, uniformly for Dom0 and DomU.
    xen_fill_possible_map() can be dropped altogether, while
    xen_filter_cpu_maps() is re-purposed but not otherwise changed.

    nvme: fix a possible use-after-free in controller reset during load
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fa0f99fc84e41057cbdd2efbfe91c6b2f47dd9d ]
    
    Unlike .queue_rq, in .submit_async_event drivers may not check the ctrl
    readiness for AER submission. This may lead to a use-after-free
    condition that was observed with nvme-tcp.
    
    The race condition may happen in the following scenario:
    1. driver executes its reset_ctrl_work
    2. -> nvme_stop_ctrl - flushes ctrl async_event_work
    3. ctrl sends AEN which is received by the host, which in turn
       schedules AEN handling
    4. teardown admin queue (which releases the queue socket)
    5. AEN processed, submits another AER, calling the driver to submit
    6. driver attempts to send the cmd
    ==> use-after-free
    
    In order to fix that, add ctrl state check to validate the ctrl
    is actually able to accept the AER submission.
    
    This addresses the above race in controller resets because the driver
    during teardown should:
    1. change ctrl state to RESETTING
    2. flush async_event_work (as well as other async work elements)
    
    So after 1,2, any other AER command will find the
    ctrl state to be RESETTING and bail out without submitting the AER.

    [ Upstream commit a6ed2035878e5ad2e43ed175d8812ac9399d6c40 ]
    
    On some OEM setups users can configure the BIOS for S3 or S2idle.
    When configured to S3 users can still choose 's2idle' in the kernel by
    using `/sys/power/mem_sleep`.  Before commit 6dc8265f9803 ("drm/amdgpu:
    always reset the asic in suspend (v2)"), the GPU would crash.  Now when
    configured this way, the system should resume but will use more power.
    
    As such, adjust the `amdpu_acpi_is_s0ix function` to warn users about
    potential power consumption issues during their first attempt at
    suspending.

    scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task
    
    [ Upstream commit df7abcaa1246e2537ab4016077b5443bb3c09378 ]
    
    Currently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upper
    layer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() or
    mpi_sata_completion().
    
    In this case, the following are the two steps in handling those I/O
    completions:
    
     - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of
       the I/O.
    
     - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in
       pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.
    
    When complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such,
    we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in the
    pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.
    
    Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.

    [ Upstream commit 61f162aa4381845acbdc7f2be4dfb694d027c018 ]
    
    Currently a use-after-free may occur if a TMF sas_task is aborted before we
    handle the IO completion in mpi_ssp_completion(). The abort occurs due to
    timeout.
    
    When the timeout occurs, the SAS_TASK_STATE_ABORTED flag is set and the
    sas_task is freed in pm8001_exec_internal_tmf_task().
    
    However, if the I/O completion occurs later, the I/O completion still
    thinks that the sas_task is available. Fix this by clearing the ccb->task
    if the TMF times out - the I/O completion handler does nothing if this
    pointer is cleared.

    scsi: core: Reallocate device's budget map on queue depth change
    
    [ Upstream commit edb854a3680bacc9ef9b91ec0c5ff6105886f6f3 ]
    
    We currently use ->cmd_per_lun as initial queue depth for setting up the
    budget_map. Martin Wilck reported that it is common for the queue_depth to
    be subsequently updated in slave_configure() based on detected hardware
    characteristics.
    
    As a result, for some drivers, the static host template settings for
    cmd_per_lun and can_queue won't actually get used in practice. And if the
    default values are used to allocate the budget_map, memory may be consumed
    unnecessarily.
    
    Fix the issue by reallocating the budget_map after ->slave_configure()
    returns. At that time the device queue_depth should accurately reflect what
    the hardware needs.

    [ Upstream commit c26b85ea16365079be8d206b20556a60a0c69ad4 ]
    
    Current code handles completions for SATA devices in mpi_sata_completion()
    and mpi_sata_event().
    
    However, at the time when any SATA event happens, for almost all the event
    types, the command is still in the target. It is therefore incorrect to
    complete the task in sata_event().
    
    There are some events for which we get sata_completions, some need recovery
    procedure and others abort. All the tasks must be completed via
    sata_completion() path.
    
    Removed the task done related code from sata_events().  For tasks where we
    don't get completions, let top layer call abort() to abort the command post
    timeout.

    pinctrl: bcm63xx: fix unmet dependency on REGMAP for GPIO_REGMAP
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a5286955bf5febc3d151bcb2c5e272e383b64aa ]
    
    When PINCTRL_BCM63XX is selected,
    and REGMAP is not selected,
    Kbuild gives the following warning:
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for GPIO_REGMAP
      Depends on [n]: GPIOLIB [=y] && REGMAP [=n]
      Selected by [y]:

    This is because PINCTRL_BCM63XX
    selects GPIO_REGMAP without selecting or depending on
    REGMAP, despite GPIO_REGMAP depending on REGMAP.
    
    This unmet dependency bug was detected by Kismet,
    a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise
    if this is not the appropriate solution.

    cifs: unlock chan_lock before calling cifs_put_tcp_session
    
    [ Upstream commit 489f710a738e24d887823a010b8b206b4124e26f ]
    
    While removing an smb session, we need to free up the
    tcp session for each channel for that session. We were
    doing this with chan_lock held. This results in a
    cyclic dependency with cifs_tcp_ses_lock.
    
    For now, unlock the chan_lock temporarily before calling
    cifs_put_tcp_session. This should not cause any problem
    for now, since we do not remove channels anywhere else.
    And this code segment will not be called by two threads.
    
    When we do implement the code for removing channels, we
    will need to execute proper ref counting here.

    ax25: improve the incomplete fix to avoid UAF and NPD bugs
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e0f718daf97d47cf7dec122da1be970f145c809 ]
    
    The previous commit 1ade48d0c27d ("ax25: NPD bug when detaching
    AX25 device") introduce lock_sock() into ax25_kill_by_device to
    prevent NPD bug. But the concurrency NPD or UAF bug will occur,
    when lock_sock() or release_sock() dereferences the ax25_cb->sock.
    
    The NULL pointer dereference bug can be shown as below:
    
    ax25_kill_by_device()        | ax25_release()
                                 |   ax25_destroy_socket()
                                 |     ax25_cb_del()
      ...                        |     ...
                                 |     ax25->sk=NULL;
      lock_sock(s->sk); //(1)    |
      s->ax25_dev = NULL;        |     ...
      release_sock(s->sk); //(2) |
      ...                        |
    
    The root cause is that the sock is set to null before dereference
    site (1) or (2). Therefore, this patch extracts the ax25_cb->sock
    in advance, and uses ax25_list_lock to protect it, which can synchronize
    with ax25_cb_del() and ensure the value of sock is not null before
    dereference sites.
    
    The concurrency UAF bug can be shown as below:
    
    ax25_kill_by_device()        | ax25_release()
                                 |   ax25_destroy_socket()
      ...                        |   ...
                                 |   sock_put(sk); //FREE
      lock_sock(s->sk); //(1)    |
      s->ax25_dev = NULL;        |   ...
      release_sock(s->sk); //(2) |
      ...                        |
    
    The root cause is that the sock is released before dereference
    site (1) or (2). Therefore, this patch uses sock_hold() to increase
    the refcount of sock and uses ax25_list_lock to protect it, which
    can synchronize with ax25_cb_del() in ax25_destroy_socket() and
    ensure the sock wil not be released before dereference sites.

    selftests/zram: Adapt the situation that /dev/zram0 is being used
    
    [ Upstream commit 01dabed20573804750af5c7bf8d1598a6bf7bf6e ]
    
    If zram-generator package is installed and works, then we can not remove
    zram module because zram swap is being used. This case needs a clean zram
    environment, change this test by using hot_add/hot_remove interface. So
    even zram device is being used, we still can add zram device and remove
    them in cleanup.
    
    The two interface was introduced since kernel commit 6566d1a32bf7("zram:
    add dynamic device add/remove functionality") in v4.2-rc1. If kernel
    supports these two interface, we use hot_add/hot_remove to slove this
    problem, if not, just check whether zram is being used or built in, then
    skip it on old kernel.

    [ Upstream commit d18da7ec3719559d6e74937266d0416e6c7e0b31 ]
    
    zram01 uses `free -m` to measure zram memory usage. The results are no
    sense because they are polluted by all running processes on the system.
    
    We Should only calculate the free memory delta for the current process.
    So use the third field of /sys/block/zram<id>/mm_stat to measure memory
    usage instead. The file is available since kernel 4.1.
    
    orig_data_size(first): uncompressed size of data stored in this disk.
    compr_data_size(second): compressed size of data stored in this disk
    mem_used_total(third): the amount of memory allocated for this disk
    
    Also remove useless zram cleanup call in zram_fill_fs and so we don't
    need to cleanup zram twice if fails.

    net: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb's
    
    [ Upstream commit e5ce576d45bf72fd0e3dc37eff897bfcc488f6a9 ]
    
    Upon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Only
    ieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. In the Tx case we then leak
    the skb structure.
    
    Free the skb structure upon error before returning when appropriate.
    
    As the 'is_tx = 0' cannot be moved in the complete handler because of a
    possible race between the delay in switching to STATE_RX_AACK_ON and a
    new interrupt, we introduce an intermediate 'was_tx' boolean just for
    this purpose.
    
    There is no Fixes tag applying here, many changes have been made on this
    area and the issue kind of always existed.

    We have some many cases that will create child process as well, such as

    such case, if child process doesn't terminate itself, ksefltest framework
    will hang forever.
    
    Here we group all its child processes so that kill() can signal all of
    them in timeout.

    selftests: rtc: Increase test timeout so that all tests run
    
    [ Upstream commit f034cc1301e7d83d4ec428dd6b8ffb57ca446efb ]
    
    The timeout setting for the rtc kselftest is currently 90 seconds. This
    setting is used by the kselftest runner to stop running a test if it
    takes longer than the assigned value.
    
    However, two of the test cases inside rtc set alarms. These alarms are
    set to the next beginning of the minute, so each of these test cases may
    take up to, in the worst case, 60 seconds.
    
    In order to allow for all test cases in rtc to run, even in the worst
    case, when using the kselftest runner, the timeout value should be
    increased to at least 120. Set it to 180, so there's some additional
    slack.
    
    Correct operation can be tested by running the following command right
    after the start of a minute (low second count), and checking that all
    test cases run:
    
            ./run_kselftest.sh -c rtc

    distinguish between two programs from a similar family but different

    The call sequence suggested that misc_device /dev file can be opened
    before misc device is yet to be registered, which is done only once.
    
    Here punit_misc_dev_lock was used as common lock, to protect the
    registration by multiple ISST HW drivers, one time setup, prevent
    duplicate registry of misc device and prevent load/unload when device
    is open.
    
    We can split into locks:
    - One which just prevent duplicate call to misc_register() and one
    time setup. Also never call again if the misc_register() failed or
    required one time setup is failed. This lock is not shared with
    any misc device callbacks.
    
    - The other lock protects registry, load and unload of HW drivers.
    
    Sequence in isst_if_cdev_register()
    - Register callbacks under punit_misc_dev_open_lock
    - Call isst_misc_reg() which registers misc_device on the first
    registry which is under punit_misc_dev_reg_lock, which is not
    shared with callbacks.
    
    Sequence in isst_if_cdev_unregister
    Just opposite of isst_if_cdev_register

    ASoC: mediatek: fix unmet dependency on GPIOLIB for SND_SOC_DMIC
    
    [ Upstream commit 579b2c8f72d974f27d85bbd53846f34675ee3b01 ]
    
    When SND_SOC_MT8195_MT6359_RT1011_RT5682 is selected,
    and GPIOLIB is not selected,
    Kbuild gives the following warning:

    btrfs: defrag: don't try to defrag extents which are under writeback
    
    commit 0d1ffa2228cb34f485f8fe927f134b82a0ea62ae upstream.
    
    Once we start writeback (have called btrfs_run_delalloc_range()), we
    allocate an extent, create an extent map point to that extent, with a
    generation of (u64)-1, created the ordered extent and then clear the
    DELALLOC bit from the range in the inode's io tree.
    
    Such extent map can pass the first call of defrag_collect_targets(), as
    its generation is (u64)-1, meets any possible minimal generation check.
    And the range will not have DELALLOC bit, also passing the DELALLOC bit
    check.
    
    It will only be re-checked in the second call of
    defrag_collect_targets(), which will wait for writeback.
    
    But at that stage we have already spent our time waiting for some IO we
    may or may not want to defrag.
    
    Let's reject such extents early so we won't waste our time.

    btrfs: don't hold CPU for too long when defragging a file
    
    commit ea0eba69a2a8125229b1b6011644598039bc53aa upstream.
    
    There is a user report about "btrfs filesystem defrag" causing 120s
    timeout problem.
    
    For btrfs_defrag_file() it will iterate all file extents if called from
    defrag ioctl, thus it can take a long time.
    
    There is no reason not to release the CPU during such a long operation.
    
    Add cond_resched() after defragged one cluster.

    HID: apple: Set the tilde quirk flag on the Wellspring 5 and later
    
    commit e26a78057c25dd56f112d536319c38735ed92ba4 upstream.
    
    Markus reports that his 2011 MacBook with a German ISO keyboard (USB
    product code 05ac:0246, HID country code 13) has the tilde key quirk.
    Seeing as all of the standalone Apple ISO keyboards since about 2008
    have the quirk, it seems reasonable to assume that once the integrated
    laptop keyboards started having the quirk, they likewise never stopped
    having it.

    commit 3149efcdf2c6314420c418dfc94de53bfd076b1f upstream.
    
    When kernel boots with a NUMA topology with some NUMA nodes offline, the PCI
    driver should only set an online NUMA node on the device. This can happen
    during KDUMP where some NUMA nodes are not made online by the KDUMP kernel.
    
    This patch also fixes the case where kernel is booting with "numa=off".

    HID: i2c-hid: goodix: Fix a lockdep splat
    
    commit 2787710f73fcce4a9bdab540aaf1aef778a27462 upstream.
    
    I'm was on the receiving end of a lockdep splat from this driver and after
    scratching my head I couldn't be entirely sure it was a false positive
    given we would also have to think about whether the regulator locking is
    safe (since the notifier is called whilst holding regulator locks which
    are also needed for regulator_is_enabled() ).
    
    Regardless of whether it is a real bug or not, the mutex isn't needed.
    We can use reference counting tricks instead to avoid races with the
    notifier calls.
    
    The observed splat follows:
    
    ------------------------------------------------------
    kworker/u16:3/127 is trying to acquire lock:

    mm: don't try to NUMA-migrate COW pages that have other uses
    
    commit 80d47f5de5e311cbc0d01ebb6ee684e8f4c196c6 upstream.
    
    Oded Gabbay reports that enabling NUMA balancing causes corruption with
    his Gaudi accelerator test load:
    
     "All the details are in the bug, but the bottom line is that somehow,
      this patch causes corruption when the numa balancing feature is
      enabled AND we don't use process affinity AND we use GUP to pin pages
      so our accelerator can DMA to/from system memory.
    
      Either disabling numa balancing, using process affinity to bind to
      specific numa-node or reverting this patch causes the bug to
      disappear"
    
    and Oded bisected the issue to commit 09854ba94c6a ("mm: do_wp_page()
    simplification").
    
    Now, the NUMA balancing shouldn't actually be changing the writability
    of a page, and as such shouldn't matter for COW.  But it appears it
    does.  Suspicious.
    
    However, regardless of that, the condition for enabling NUMA faults in
    change_pte_range() is nonsensical.  It uses "page_mapcount(page)" to
    decide if a COW page should be NUMA-protected or not, and that makes
    absolutely no sense.
    
    The number of mappings a page has is irrelevant: not only does GUP get a
    reference to a page as in Oded's case, but the other mappings migth be
    paged out and the only reference to them would be in the page count.
    
    Since we should never try to NUMA-balance a page that we can't move
    anyway due to other references, just fix the code to use 'page_count()'.
    Oded confirms that that fixes his issue.
    
    Now, this does imply that something in NUMA balancing ends up changing
    page protections (other than the obvious one of making the page
    inaccessible to get the NUMA faulting information).  Otherwise the COW
    simplification wouldn't matter - since doing the GUP on the page would
    make sure it's writable.
    
    The cause of that permission change would be good to figure out too,
    since it clearly results in spurious COW events - but fixing the
    nonsensical test that just happened to work before is obviously the
    CorrectThing(tm) to do regardless.

    mmc: block: fix read single on recovery logic
    
    commit 54309fde1a352ad2674ebba004a79f7d20b9f037 upstream.
    
    On reads with MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK that fail,
    the recovery handler will use MMC_READ_SINGLE_BLOCK for
    each of the blocks, up to MMC_READ_SINGLE_RETRIES times each.
    The logic for this is fixed to never report unsuccessful reads
    as success to the block layer.
    
    On command error with retries remaining, blk_update_request was
    called with whatever value error was set last to.
    In case it was last set to BLK_STS_OK (default), the read will be
    reported as success, even though there was no data read from the device.
    This could happen on a CRC mismatch for the response,
    a card rejecting the command (e.g. again due to a CRC mismatch).
    In case it was last set to BLK_STS_IOERR, the error is reported correctly,
    but no retries will be attempted.

    The bug is caused by overrunning the sglist and incorrectly testing
    sg_dma_len(sglist) before nents. Normally this doesn't cause a crash,
    but in this case sglist crossed a page boundary. This occurs in the
    following code:
    
            while (sg_dma_len(sglist) && nents--) {
    
    The fix is simply to test nents first and move the decrement of nents
    into the loop.

    parisc: Drop __init from map_pages declaration
    
    commit 9129886b88185962538180625ca8051362b01327 upstream.
    
    With huge kernel pages, we randomly eat a SPARC in map_pages(). This
    is fixed by dropping __init from the declaration.
    
    However, map_pages references the __init routine memblock_alloc_try_nid
    via memblock_alloc.  Thus, it needs to be marked with __ref.
    
    memblock_alloc is only called before the kernel text is set to readonly.
    
    The __ref on free_initmem is no longer needed.
    
    Comment regarding map_pages being in the init section is removed.

    commit 6e8793674bb0d1135ca0e5c9f7e16fecbf815926 upstream.
    
    There is a build error when using a kernel .config file from
    'kernel test robot' for a different build problem:
    
    hppa64-linux-ld: drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_gsc.o: in function `.LC3':
    (.data.rel.ro+0x18): undefined reference to `iosapic_serial_irq'
    
    when:
      CONFIG_GSC=y
      CONFIG_SERIO_GSCPS2=y
      CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_GSC=y
      CONFIG_PCI is not set
        and hence PCI_LBA is not set.
      IOSAPIC depends on PCI_LBA, so IOSAPIC is not set/enabled.
    
    Make the use of iosapic_serial_irq() conditional to fix the build error.

    bpf: Add MEM_RDONLY for helper args that are pointers to rdonly mem.
    
    commit 216e3cd2f28dbbf1fe86848e0e29e6693b9f0a20 upstream.
    
    Some helper functions may modify its arguments, for example,
    bpf_d_path, bpf_get_stack etc. Previously, their argument types
    were marked as ARG_PTR_TO_MEM, which is compatible with read-only
    mem types, such as PTR_TO_RDONLY_BUF. Therefore it's legitimate,
    but technically incorrect, to modify a read-only memory by passing
    it into one of such helper functions.
    
    This patch tags the bpf_args compatible with immutable memory with
    MEM_RDONLY flag. The arguments that don't have this flag will be
    only compatible with mutable memory types, preventing the helper
    from modifying a read-only memory. The bpf_args that have
    MEM_RDONLY are compatible with both mutable memory and immutable
    memory.

    bpf: Make per_cpu_ptr return rdonly PTR_TO_MEM.
    
    commit 34d3a78c681e8e7844b43d1a2f4671a04249c821 upstream.
    
    Tag the return type of {per, this}_cpu_ptr with RDONLY_MEM. The
    returned value of this pair of helpers is kernel object, which
    can not be updated by bpf programs. Previously these two helpers
    return PTR_OT_MEM for kernel objects of scalar type, which allows
    one to directly modify the memory. Now with RDONLY_MEM tagging,
    the verifier will reject programs that write into RDONLY_MEM.

    We have introduced a new type to make bpf_reg composable, by

    1. PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE_OR_NULL
    2. PTR_TO_SOCKET_OR_NULL
    3. PTR_TO_SOCK_COMMON_OR_NULL
    4. PTR_TO_TCP_SOCK_OR_NULL
    5. PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL
    6. PTR_TO_MEM_OR_NULL
    7. PTR_TO_RDONLY_BUF_OR_NULL
    8. PTR_TO_RDWR_BUF_OR_NULL
    
    [haoluo: backport notes
     There was a reg_type_may_be_null() in adjust_ptr_min_max_vals() in
     5.16.x, but didn't exist in the upstream commit. This backport
     converted that reg_type_may_be_null() to type_may_be_null() as well.]

    commit 3c4807322660d4290ac9062c034aed6b87243861 upstream.
    
    We have introduced a new type to make bpf_ret composable, by
    reserving high bits to represent flags.
    
    One of the flag is PTR_MAYBE_NULL, which indicates a pointer

    1. RET_PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE_OR_NULL
    2. RET_PTR_TO_SOCKET_OR_NULL

    bpf: Introduce composable reg, ret and arg types.
    
    commit d639b9d13a39cf15639cbe6e8b2c43eb60148a73 upstream.
    
    There are some common properties shared between bpf reg, ret and arg
    values. For instance, a value may be a NULL pointer, or a pointer to
    a read-only memory. Previously, to express these properties, enumeration
    was used. For example, in order to test whether a reg value can be NULL,
    reg_type_may_be_null() simply enumerates all types that are possibly
    NULL. The problem of this approach is that it's not scalable and causes
    a lot of duplication. These properties can be combined, for example, a
    type could be either MAYBE_NULL or RDONLY, or both.
    
    This patch series rewrites the layout of reg_type, arg_type and
    ret_type, so that common properties can be extracted and represented as
    composable flag. For example, one can write
    
     ARG_PTR_TO_MEM | PTR_MAYBE_NULL
    
    which is equivalent to the previous
    
     ARG_PTR_TO_MEM_OR_NULL
    
    The type ARG_PTR_TO_MEM are called "base type" in this patch. Base
    types can be extended with flags. A flag occupies the higher bits while
    base types sits in the lower bits.
    
    This patch in particular sets up a set of macro for this purpose. The
    following patches will rewrite arg_types, ret_types and reg_types
    respectively.
