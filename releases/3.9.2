    NFSv4.x: Fix handling of partially delegated locks
    
    commit c5a2a15f8146fdfe45078df7873a6dc1006b3869 upstream.
    
    If a NFS client receives a delegation for a file after it has taken
    a lock on that file, we can currently end up in a situation where
    we mistakenly skip unlocking that file.
    
    The following patch swaps an erroneous check in nfs4_proc_unlck for
    whether or not the file has a delegation to one which checks whether
    or not we hold a lock stateid for that file.

    PCI: Delay final fixups until resources are assigned
    
    commit e253aaf0af51c1e4dc7dd3b26ea8e666bf9a2d8d upstream.
    
    Commit 4f535093cf "PCI: Put pci_dev in device tree as early as possible"
    moved final fixups from pci_bus_add_device() to pci_device_add().  But
    pci_device_add() happens before resource assignment, so BARs may not be
    valid yet.
    
    Typical flow for hot-add:
    
        pciehp_configure_device
          pci_scan_slot
            pci_scan_single_device
              pci_device_add
                pci_fixup_device(pci_fixup_final, dev)  # previous location
          # resource assignment happens here
          pci_bus_add_devices
            pci_bus_add_device
              pci_fixup_device(pci_fixup_final, dev)    # new location

    EDAC: Don't give write permission to read-only files
    
    commit c8c64d165ccfd2274058ac84e0c680f9b48c4ec1 upstream.
    
    I get the following warning on boot:
    
    ------------[ cut here ]------------
    WARNING: at drivers/base/core.c:575 device_create_file+0x9a/0xa0()
    Hardware name:  -[8737R2A]-
    Write permission without 'store'
    ...
    </snip>
    
    Drilling down, this is related to dynamic channel ce_count attribute
    files sporting a S_IWUSR mode without a ->store() function. Looking
    around, it appears that they aren't supposed to have a ->store()
    function. So remove the bogus write permission to get rid of the
    warning.

    but for O_DIRECT.  I missed this when I fixed the problem originally, we were
    still using the em for the orig_start and orig_block_len, which would be the
    merged extent.  We need to use the actual extent from the on disk file extent
    item, which we have to lookup to make sure it's ok to nocow anyway so just pass
    in some pointers to hold this info.  Thanks,

    Btrfs: compare relevant parts of delayed tree refs
    
    commit 41b0fc42800569f63e029549b75c4c9cb63f2dfd upstream.
    
    A user reported a panic while running a balance.  What was happening was he was
    relocating a block, which added the reference to the relocation tree.  Then
    relocation would walk through the relocation tree and drop that reference and
    free that block, and then it would walk down a snapshot which referenced the
    same block and add another ref to the block.  The problem is this was all
    happening in the same transaction, so the parent block was free'ed up when we
    drop our reference which was immediately available for allocation, and then it
    was used _again_ to add a reference for the same block from a different
    snapshot.  This resulted in something like this in the delayed ref tree
    
    add ref to 90234880, parent=2067398656, ref_root 1766, level 1
    del ref to 90234880, parent=2067398656, ref_root 18446744073709551608, level 1
    add ref to 90234880, parent=2067398656, ref_root 1767, level 1
    
    as you can see the ref_root's don't match, because when we inc the ref we use
    the header owner, which is the original tree the block belonged to, instead of
    the data reloc tree.  Then when we remove the extent we use the reloc tree
    objectid.  But none of this matters, since it is a shared reference which means
    only the parent matters.  When the delayed ref stuff runs it adds all the
    increments first, and then does all the drops, to make sure that we don't delete
    the ref if we net a positive ref count.  But tree blocks aren't allowed to have
    multiple refs from the same block, so this panics when it tries to add the
    second ref.  We need the add and the drop to cancel each other out in memory so
    we only do the final add.
    
    So to fix this we need to adjust how the delayed refs are added to the tree.
    Only the ref_root matters when it is a normal backref, and only the parent
    matters when it is a shared backref.  So make our decision based on what ref
    type we have.  This allows us to keep the ref_root in memory in case anybody
    wants to use it for something else, and it allows the delayed refs to be merged
    properly so we don't end up with this panic.
    
    With this patch the users image no longer panics on mount, and it has a clean
    fsck after a normal mount/umount cycle.  Thanks,

    tracing: Fix ftrace_dump()
    
    commit 7fe70b579c9e3daba71635e31b6189394e7b79d3 upstream.
    
    ftrace_dump() had a lot of issues. What ftrace_dump() does, is when
    ftrace_dump_on_oops is set (via a kernel parameter or sysctl), it
    will dump out the ftrace buffers to the console when either a oops,
    panic, or a sysrq-z occurs.
    
    This was written a long time ago when ftrace was fragile to recursion.
    But it wasn't written well even for that.
    
    There's a possible deadlock that can occur if a ftrace_dump() is happening
    and an NMI triggers another dump. This is because it grabs a lock
    before checking if the dump ran.
    
    It also totally disables ftrace, and tracing for no good reasons.
    
    As the ring_buffer now checks if it is read via a oops or NMI, where
    there's a chance that the buffer gets corrupted, it will disable
    itself. No need to have ftrace_dump() do the same.
    
    ftrace_dump() is now cleaned up where it uses an atomic counter to
    make sure only one dump happens at a time. A simple atomic_inc_return()
    is enough that is needed for both other CPUs and NMIs. No need for
    a spinlock, as if one CPU is running the dump, no other CPU needs
    to do it too.
    
    The tracing_on variable is turned off and not turned on. The original
    code did this, but it wasn't pretty. By just disabling this variable
    we get the result of not seeing traces that happen between crashes.
    
    For sysrq-z, it doesn't get turned on, but the user can always write
    a '1' to the tracing_on file. If they are using sysrq-z, then they should
    know about tracing_on.
    
    The new code is much easier to read and less error prone. No more
    deadlock possibility when an NMI triggers here.

    drm/i915: correct the calculation of first_pd_entry_in_global_pt
    
    commit 43b27290dd42b40f3f23f49677a7faa5a4eb1eff upstream.
    
    When ppgtt is enabled, dev_priv->gtt.total has excluded the gtt space
    occupied by ppgtt table in i915_gem_init_global_gtt() function. So the
    calculation of first_pd_entry_in_global_pt doesn't need to subtract
    I915_PPGTT_PD_ENTRIES again. Or else PPGTT directory table will be
    destroyed by global gtt allocation.

    drm/i915: Fixup Oops in the pipe config computation
    
    commit b6c5164d7bf624f3e1b750787ddb983150c5117c upstream.
    
    Yet again our current confusion between doing the modeset globally,
    but only having the new parameters for one crtc at a time.
    
    So that intel_set_mode essentially already does a global modeset:
    intel_modeset_affected_pipes compares the current state with where we
    want to go to (which is carefully set up by intel_crtc_set_config) and
    then goes through the modeset sequence for any crtc which needs
    updating.
    
    Now the issue is that the actual interface with the remaining code
    still only works on one crtc, and so we only pass in one fb and one
    mode. In intel_set_mode we also only compute one intel_crtc_config
    (which should be the one for the crtc we're doing a modeset on).
    
    The reason for that mismatch is twofold:
    - We want to eventually do all modeset as global state changes, so
    it's just infrastructure prep.
    - But even the old semantics can change more than one crtc when you
    e.g. move a connector from crtc A to crtc B, then both crtc A and B
    need to be updated. Usually that means one pipe is disabled and the
    other enabled. This is also the reason why the hack doesn't touch the
    disable_pipes mask.
    
    Now hilarity ensued in our kms config restore paths when we actually
    try to do a modeset on all crtcs: If the first crtc should be off and
    the second should be on, then the call on the first crtc will notice
    that the 2nd one should be switched on and so tries to compute the
    pipe_config. But due to a lack of passed-in fb (crtc 1 should be off
    after all) it only results in tears.
    
    This case is ridiculously easy to hit on gen2/3 where the lvds output
    is restricted to pipe B. Note that before the pipe_config bpp rework
    gen2/3 didn't care really about the fb->depth, so this is a regression
    brought to light with

        drm/i915: precompute pipe bpp before touching the hw
    
    But apparently Ajax also managed to blow up pch platforms, probably
    with some randomized configs, and pch platforms trip up over the lack
    of an fb even in the old code. So this actually goes back to the first
    introduction of the new modeset restore code in

    restore code they've been a bit outdated.

    drm/i915: ensure single initialization and cleanup of backlight device
    
    commit dc652f90e088798bfa31f496ba994ddadd5d5680 upstream.
    
    Backlight cleanup in the eDP connector destroy callback caused the
    backlight device to be removed on some systems that first initialized LVDS
    and then attempted to initialize eDP. Prevent multiple backlight
    initializations, and ensure backlight cleanup is only done once by moving
    it to modeset cleanup.
    
    A small wrinkle is the introduced asymmetry in backlight
    setup/cleanup. This could be solved by adding refcounting, but it seems
    overkill considering that there should only ever be one backlight device.

    commit f30da187cdcd0939288038e11fb3bfbd1b655564 upstream.
    
    It will be only consistent once we've restored all the crtcs. Since a
    bunch of other callers also want to just restore a single crtc, add a
    boolean to disable checking only where it doesn't make sense.
    
    Note that intel_modeset_setup_hw_state already has a call to
    intel_modeset_check_state at the end, so we don't reduce the amount of
    checking.
    
    v2: Try harder not to create a big patch (Chris).
    
    v3: Even smaller (still Chris). Also fix a trailing space.

    drm/i915: Use MLC (l3$) for context objects
    
    commit 4615d4c9e27eda42c3e965f208a4b4065841498c upstream.
    
    Enabling context support increases SwapBuffers latency by about 20%
    (measured on an i7-3720qm). We can offset that loss slightly by enabling
    faster caching for the contexts. As they are not backed by any
    particular cache (such as the sampler or render caches) our only option
    is to select the generic mid-level cache. This reduces the latency of
    the swap by about 5%.
    
    Oddly this effect can be observed running smokin-guns on IVB at
    1280x1024:
    Using BLT copies for swaps: 151.67 fps
    Using Render copies for swaps (unpatched):  141.70 fps
    With contexts disabled: 150.23 fps
    With contexts in L3$: 150.77 fps

    drm/i915: Fix SDVO connector and encoder get_hw_state functions
    
    commit 7a7d1fb79fb581553f4830498045de774a9659f8 upstream.
    
    The connector associated with the encoder is considered active when the
    output associtated with this connector is active on the encoder. The
    encoder itself is considered active when either there is an active
    output on  it or the  respective SDVO channel is active.
    Having active outputs when the SDVO channel is inactive seems to be
    inconsistent: such states can be found when intel_modeset_setup_hw_state()
    collects the hardware state set by the BIOS.
    This inconsistency will be fixed in intel_sanitize_crtc()
    (when intel_crtc_update_dpms() is called), this however only happens
    when the encoder is associated with a crtc.
    
    This patch also reverts:

    The "Mobile Sandy Bridge CPUs" in the Fujitsu Esprimo Q900
    mini desktop PCs are probably misleading the LVDS detection
    code in intel_lvds_supported. Nothing is connected to the
    LVDS ports in these systems.

    drm/i915: Fix sdvo connector get_hw_state function
    
    commit bd6946e87a98fea11907b2a47368e13044458a35 upstream.
    
    The active output is only the currently selected one, which does not
    imply that it's actually enabled. Since we don't use the sdvo encoder
    side dpms support, we need to check whether the chip-side sdvo port is
    enabled instead.

    drm/ast: deal with bo reserve fail in dirty update path
    
    commit 306373b645d80625335b8e684fa09b14ba460cec upstream.
    
    Port over the mgag200 fix to ast as it suffers the same issue.
    
        On F19 testing, it was noticed we get a lot of errors in dmesg
        about being unable to reserve the buffer when plymouth starts,
        this is due to the buffer being in the process of migrating,

    drm/prime: keep a reference from the handle to exported dma-buf (v6)
    
    commit 219b47339ced80ca580bb6ce7d1636166984afa7 upstream.
    
    Currently we have a problem with this:
    1. i915: create gem object
    2. i915: export gem object to prime
    3. radeon: import gem object
    4. close prime fd
    5. radeon: unref object
    6. i915: unref object
    
    i915 has an imported object reference in its file priv, that isn't
    cleaned up properly until fd close. The reference gets added at step 2,
    but at step 6 we don't have enough info to clean it up.
    
    The solution is to take a reference on the dma-buf when we export it,
    and drop the reference when the gem handle goes away.
    
    So when we export a dma_buf from a gem object, we keep track of it
    with the handle, we take a reference to the dma_buf. When we close
    the handle (i.e. userspace is finished with the buffer), we drop
    the reference to the dma_buf, and it gets collected.
    
    This patch isn't meant to fix any other problem or bikesheds, and it doesn't
    fix any races with other scenarios.
    
    v1.1: move export symbol line back up.
    
    v2: okay I had to do a bit more, as the first patch showed a leak
    on one of my tests, that I found using the dma-buf debugfs support,
    the problem case is exporting a buffer twice with the same handle,
    we'd add another export handle for it unnecessarily, however
    we now fail if we try to export the same object with a different gem handle,
    however I'm not sure if that is a case I want to support, and I've
    gotten the code to WARN_ON if we hit something like that.
    
    v2.1: rebase this patch, write better commit msg.
    v3: cleanup error handling, track import vs export in linked list,
    these two patches were separate previously, but seem to work better
    like this.
    v4: danvet is correct, this code is no longer useful, since the buffer
    better exist, so remove it.
    v5: always take a reference to the dma buf object, import or export.
    (Imre Deak contributed this originally)
    v6: square the circle, remove import vs export tracking now
    that there is no difference

    drm: prime: fix refcounting on the dmabuf import error path
    
    commit 011c2282c74db120f01a8414edc66c3f217f5511 upstream.
    
    In commit be8a42ae60 we inroduced a refcount problem, where on the
    drm_gem_prime_fd_to_handle() error path we'll call dma_buf_put() for
    self imported dma buffers.
    
    Fix this by taking a reference on the dma buffer in the .gem_import
    hook instead of assuming the caller had taken one. Besides fixing the
    bug this is also more logical.

    drm/gma500: fix backlight hotkeys behaviour on netbooks
    
    commit e127dc28cc3057575da0216cde85687153ca180f upstream.
    
    Backlight hotkeys weren't working before on certain cedartrail laptops.
    
    The source of this problem is that the hotkeys' ASLE opregion interrupts
    were simply ignored. Driver seemed to expect the interrupt to be
    associated with a pipe, but it wasn't.
    
    Accepting the ASLE interrupt without an associated pipe event flag fixes
    the issue, the backlight code is called when needed, making the
    brightness keys work properly.
    
    [patrik: This patch affects irq handling on any netbook with opregion support]

    block: fix max discard sectors limit
    
    commit 871dd9286e25330c8a581e5dacfa8b1dfe1dd641 upstream.
    
    linux-v3.8-rc1 and later support for plug for blkdev_issue_discard with
    commit 0cfbcafcae8b7364b5fa96c2b26ccde7a3a296a9
    (block: add plug for blkdev_issue_discard )
    
    For example,
    1) DISCARD rq-1 with size size 4GB
    2) DISCARD rq-2 with size size 1GB
    
    If these 2 discard requests get merged, final request size will be 5GB.
    
    In this case, request's __data_len field may overflow as it can store
    max 4GB(unsigned int).
    
    This issue was observed while doing mkfs.f2fs on 5GB SD card:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/4/1/292
    
    Info: sector size = 512
    Info: total sectors = 11370496 (in 512bytes)
    Info: zone aligned segment0 blkaddr: 512

    mkfs process gets stuck in D state and I see the following in the dmesg:

    blkcg: fix "scheduling while atomic" in blk_queue_bypass_start
    
    commit e5072664f8237cf53b0bd68a51aa1a7bc69061c5 upstream.
    
    Since 749fefe677 in v3.7 ("block: lift the initial queue bypass mode
    on blk_register_queue() instead of blk_init_allocated_queue()"),
    the following warning appears when multipath is used with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y.
    
    This patch moves blk_queue_bypass_start() before radix_tree_preload()
    to avoid the sleeping call while preemption is disabled.

    arm64: Ignore the 'write' ESR flag on cache maintenance faults
    
    commit 0e7f7bcc3fc87489cda5aa6aff8ce40eed912279 upstream.
    
    ESR.WnR bit is always set on data cache maintenance faults even though
    the page is not required to have write permission. If a translation
    fault (page not yet mapped) happens for read-only user address range,
    Linux incorrectly assumes a permission fault. This patch adds the check
    of the ESR.CM bit during the page fault handling to ignore the 'write'
    flag.

    RDMA/cxgb4: Fix SQ allocation when on-chip SQ is disabled
    
    commit 5b0c275926b8149c555da874bb4ec258ea3292aa upstream.
    
    Commit c079c28714e4 ("RDMA/cxgb4: Fix error handling in create_qp()")
    broke SQ allocation.  Instead of falling back to host allocation when
    on-chip allocation fails, it tries to allocate both.  And when it
    does, and we try to free the address from the genpool using the host
    address, we hit a BUG and the system crashes as below.
    
    We create a new function that has the previous behavior and properly
    propagate the error, as intended.

    MODSIGN: do not send garbage to stderr when enabling modules signature
    
    commit 07c449bbc6aa514098c4f12c7b04180cec2417c6 upstream.
    
    When compiling kernel with -jN (N > 1), all warning/error messages
    printed while openssl is generating key pair may get mixed dots and
    other symbols openssl sends to stderr. This patch makes sure openssl
    logs go to default stdout.
    
    Example of the garbage on stderr:

    commit 6e15eb3ba6c0249c9e8c783517d131b47db995ca upstream.
    
    The LBR 'from' adddress is under full userspace control; ensure
    we validate it before reading from it.
    
    Note: is_module_text_address() can potentially be quite
    expensive; for those running into that with high overhead
    in modules optimize it using an RCU backed rb-tree.

    net/eth/ibmveth: Fixup retrieval of MAC address
    
    commit 13f85203e1060da83d9ec1c1c5a63343eaab8de4 upstream.
    
    Some ancient pHyp versions used to create a 8 bytes local-mac-address
    property in the device-tree instead of a 6 bytes one for veth.
    
    The Linux driver code to deal with that is an insane hack which also
    happens to break with some choices of MAC addresses in qemu by testing
    for a bit in the address rather than just looking at the size of the
    property.
    
    Sanitize this by doing the latter instead.

    hugetlbfs: fix mmap failure in unaligned size request
    
    commit af73e4d9506d3b797509f3c030e7dcd554f7d9c4 upstream.
    
    The current kernel returns -EINVAL unless a given mmap length is
    "almost" hugepage aligned.  This is because in sys_mmap_pgoff() the
    given length is passed to vm_mmap_pgoff() as it is without being aligned
    with hugepage boundary.
    
    This is a regression introduced in commit 40716e29243d ("hugetlbfs: fix
    alignment of huge page requests"), where alignment code is pushed into
    hugetlb_file_setup() and the variable len in caller side is not changed.
    
    To fix this, this patch partially reverts that commit, and adds
    alignment code in caller side.  And it also introduces hstate_sizelog()
    in order to get proper hstate to specified hugepage size.

    autofs - remove autofs dentry mount check
    
    commit ce8a5dbdf9e709bdaf4618d7ef8cceb91e8adc69 upstream.
    
    When checking if an autofs mount point is busy it isn't sufficient to
    only check if it's a mount point.
    
    For example, if the mount of an offset mountpoint in a tree is denied
    for this host by its export and the dentry becomes a process working
    directory the check incorrectly returns the mount as not in use at
    expire.
    
    This can happen since the default when mounting within a tree is
    nostrict, which means ingnore mount fails on mounts within the tree and
    continue.  The nostrict option is meant to allow mounting in this case.

    powerpc: fix numa distance for form0 device tree
    
    commit 7122beeee7bc1757682049780179d7c216dd1c83 upstream.
    
    The following commit breaks numa distance setup for old powerpc
    systems that use form0 encoding in device tree.
    
    commit 41eab6f88f24124df89e38067b3766b7bef06ddb
    powerpc/numa: Use form 1 affinity to setup node distance
    
    Device tree node /rtas/ibm,associativity-reference-points would
    index into /cpus/PowerPCxxxx/ibm,associativity based on form0 or
    form1 encoding detected by ibm,architecture-vec-5 property.
    
    All modern systems use form1 and current kernel code is correct.
    However, on older systems with form0 encoding, the numa distance
    will get hard coded as LOCAL_DISTANCE for all nodes.  This causes
    task scheduling anomaly since scheduler will skip building numa
    level domain (topmost domain with all cpus) if all numa distances
    are same.  (value of 'level' in sched_init_numa() will remain 0)
    
    Prior to the above commit:
    ((from) == (to) ? LOCAL_DISTANCE : REMOTE_DISTANCE)
    
    Restoring compatible behavior with this patch for old powerpc systems
    with device tree where numa distance are encoded as form0.

    powerpc: Emulate non privileged DSCR read and write
    
    commit 73d2fb758e678c93bc76d40876c2359f0729b0ef upstream.
    
    POWER8 allows read and write of the DSCR in userspace. We added
    kernel emulation so applications could always use the instructions
    regardless of the CPU type.
    
    Unfortunately there are two SPRs for the DSCR and we only added
    emulation for the privileged one. Add code to match the non
    privileged one.
    
    A simple test was created to verify the fix:
    
    http://ozlabs.org/~anton/junkcode/user_dscr_test.c
    
    Without the patch we get a SIGILL and it passes with the patch.
