    mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Fix READOOB implementation
    
    commit fee4380f368e84ed216b62ccd2fbc4126f2bf40b upstream.
    
    In the current driver, OOB bytes are accessed in raw mode, and when a
    page access is done with NDCR_SPARE_EN set and NDCR_ECC_EN cleared, the
    driver must read the whole spare area (64 bytes in case of a 2k page,
    16 bytes for a 512 page). The driver was only reading the free OOB
    bytes, which was leaving some unread data in the FIFO and was somehow
    leading to a timeout.
    
    We could patch the driver to read ->spare_size + ->ecc_size instead of
    just ->spare_size when READOOB is requested, but we'd better make
    in-band and OOB accesses consistent.
    Since the driver is always accessing in-band data in non-raw mode (with
    the ECC engine enabled), we should also access OOB data in this mode.
    That's particularly useful when using the BCH engine because in this
    mode the free OOB bytes are also ECC protected.

    x86/tlb: Drop the _GPL from the cpu_tlbstate export
    
    commit 1e5476815fd7f98b888e01a0f9522b63085f96c9 upstream.
    
    The recent changes for PTI touch cpu_tlbstate from various tlb_flush
    inlines. cpu_tlbstate is exported as GPL symbol, so this causes a
    regression when building out of tree drivers for certain graphics cards.
    
    Aside of that the export was wrong since it was introduced as it should
    have been EXPORT_PER_CPU_SYMBOL_GPL().
    
    Use the correct PER_CPU export and drop the _GPL to restore the previous
    state which allows users to utilize the cards they payed for.
    
    As always I'm really thrilled to make this kind of change to support the
    #friends (or however the hot hashtag of today is spelled) from that closet
    sauce graphics corp.

    parisc: Fix alignment of pa_tlb_lock in assembly on 32-bit SMP kernel
    
    commit 88776c0e70be0290f8357019d844aae15edaa967 upstream.
    
    Qemu for PARISC reported on a 32bit SMP parisc kernel strange failures
    about "Not-handled unaligned insn 0x0e8011d6 and 0x0c2011c9."
    
    Those opcodes evaluate to the ldcw() assembly instruction which requires
    (on 32bit) an alignment of 16 bytes to ensure atomicity.
    
    As it turns out, qemu is correct and in our assembly code in entry.S and
    pacache.S we don't pay attention to the required alignment.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by aligning the lock offset in assembly
    code in the same manner as we do in our C-code.

    iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Cope with duplicated Stream IDs
    
    commit 563b5cbe334e9503ab2b234e279d500fc4f76018 upstream.
    
    For PCI devices behind an aliasing PCIe-to-PCI/X bridge, the bridge
    alias to DevFn 0.0 on the subordinate bus may match the original RID of
    the device, resulting in the same SID being present in the device's
    fwspec twice. This causes trouble later in arm_smmu_write_strtab_ent()
    when we wind up visiting the STE a second time and find it already live.
    
    Avoid the issue by giving arm_smmu_install_ste_for_dev() the cleverness
    to skip over duplicates. It seems mildly counterintuitive compared to
    preventing the duplicates from existing in the first place, but since
    the DT and ACPI probe paths build their fwspecs differently, this is
    actually the cleanest and most self-contained way to deal with it.

    kernel/signal.c: remove the no longer needed SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE check in complete_signal()
    
    commit 426915796ccaf9c2bd9bb06dc5702225957bc2e5 upstream.
    
    complete_signal() checks SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE before it starts to destroy
    the thread group, today this is wrong in many ways.
    
    If nothing else, fatal_signal_pending() should always imply that the
    whole thread group (except ->group_exit_task if it is not NULL) is
    killed, this check breaks the rule.
    
    After the previous changes we can rely on sig_task_ignored();
    sig_fatal(sig) && SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE can only be true if we actually want
    to kill this task and sig == SIGKILL OR it is traced and debugger can
    intercept the signal.
    
    This should hopefully fix the problem reported by Dmitry.  This
    test-case
    
            static int init(void *arg)
            {
                    for (;;)
                            pause();
            }
    
            int main(void)
            {
                    char stack[16 * 1024];
    
                    for (;;) {
                            int pid = clone(init, stack + sizeof(stack)/2,
                                            CLONE_NEWPID | SIGCHLD, NULL);
                            assert(pid > 0);
    
                            assert(ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0) == 0);
                            assert(waitpid(-1, NULL, WSTOPPED) == pid);
    
                            assert(ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, pid, 0, SIGSTOP) == 0);
                            assert(syscall(__NR_tkill, pid, SIGKILL) == 0);
                            assert(pid == wait(NULL));
                    }
            }
    
    triggers the WARN_ON_ONCE(!(task->jobctl & JOBCTL_STOP_PENDING)) in
    task_participate_group_stop().  do_signal_stop()->signal_group_exit()
    checks SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT and return false, but task_set_jobctl_pending()
    checks fatal_signal_pending() and does not set JOBCTL_STOP_PENDING.
    
    And his should fix the minor security problem reported by Kyle,
    SECCOMP_RET_TRACE can miss fatal_signal_pending() the same way if the
    task is the root of a pid namespace.

    kernel/signal.c: protect the traced SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE tasks from SIGKILL
    
    commit 628c1bcba204052d19b686b5bac149a644cdb72e upstream.
    
    The comment in sig_ignored() says "Tracers may want to know about even
    ignored signals" but SIGKILL can not be reported to debugger and it is
    just wrong to return 0 in this case: SIGKILL should only kill the
    SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE task if it comes from the parent ns.
    
    Change sig_ignored() to ignore ->ptrace if sig == SIGKILL and rely on
    sig_task_ignored().
    
    SISGTOP coming from within the namespace is not really right too but at
    least debugger can intercept it, and we can't drop it here because this
    will break "gdb -p 1": ptrace_attach() won't work.  Perhaps we will add
    another ->ptrace check later, we will see.

    kernel: make groups_sort calling a responsibility group_info allocators
    
    commit bdcf0a423ea1c40bbb40e7ee483b50fc8aa3d758 upstream.
    
    In testing, we found that nfsd threads may call set_groups in parallel
    for the same entry cached in auth.unix.gid, racing in the call of
    groups_sort, corrupting the groups for that entry and leading to
    permission denials for the client.
    
    This patch:
     - Make groups_sort globally visible.
     - Move the call to groups_sort to the modifiers of group_info
     - Remove the call to groups_sort from set_groups

    fscache: Fix the default for fscache_maybe_release_page()
    
    commit 98801506552593c9b8ac11021b0cdad12cab4f6b upstream.
    
    Fix the default for fscache_maybe_release_page() for when the cookie isn't
    valid or the page isn't cached.  It mustn't return false as that indicates
    the page cannot yet be freed.
    
    The problem with the default is that if, say, there's no cache, but a
    network filesystem's pages are using up almost all the available memory, a
    system can OOM because the filesystem ->releasepage() op will not allow
    them to be released as fscache_maybe_release_page() incorrectly prevents
    it.
    
    This can be tested by writing a sequence of 512MiB files to an AFS mount.
    It does not affect NFS or CIFS because both of those wrap the call in a
    check of PG_fscache and it shouldn't bother Ceph as that only has
    PG_private set whilst writeback is in progress.  This might be an issue for
    9P, however.
    
    Note that the pages aren't entirely stuck.  Removing a file or unmounting
    will clear things because that uses ->invalidatepage() instead.

    sunxi-rsb: Include OF based modalias in device uevent
    
    commit e2bf801ecd4e62222a46d1ba9e57e710171d29c1 upstream.
    
    Include the OF-based modalias in the uevent sent when registering devices
    on the sunxi RSB bus, so that user space has a chance to autoload the
    kernel module for the device.
    
    Fixes a regression caused by commit 3f241bfa60bd ("arm64: allwinner: a64:
    pine64: Use dcdc1 regulator for mmc0"). When the axp20x-rsb module for
    the AXP803 PMIC is built as a module, it is not loaded and the system
    ends up with an disfunctional MMC controller.

    crypto: pcrypt - fix freeing pcrypt instances
    
    commit d76c68109f37cb85b243a1cf0f40313afd2bae68 upstream.
    
    pcrypt is using the old way of freeing instances, where the ->free()
    method specified in the 'struct crypto_template' is passed a pointer to
    the 'struct crypto_instance'.  But the crypto_instance is being
    kfree()'d directly, which is incorrect because the memory was actually
    allocated as an aead_instance, which contains the crypto_instance at a
    nonzero offset.  Thus, the wrong pointer was being kfree()'d.
    
    Fix it by switching to the new way to free aead_instance's where the
    ->free() method is specified in the aead_instance itself.

    crypto: chacha20poly1305 - validate the digest size
    
    commit e57121d08c38dabec15cf3e1e2ad46721af30cae upstream.
    
    If the rfc7539 template was instantiated with a hash algorithm with
    digest size larger than 16 bytes (POLY1305_DIGEST_SIZE), then the digest
    overran the 'tag' buffer in 'struct chachapoly_req_ctx', corrupting the
    subsequent memory, including 'cryptlen'.  This caused a crash during
    crypto_skcipher_decrypt().
    
    Fix it by, when instantiating the template, requiring that the
    underlying hash algorithm has the digest size expected for Poly1305.

        #include <linux/if_alg.h>
        #include <sys/socket.h>

                unsigned char buf[32] = { 0 };

    crypto: n2 - cure use after free
    
    commit 203f45003a3d03eea8fa28d74cfc74c354416fdb upstream.
    
    queue_cache_init is first called for the Control Word Queue
    (n2_crypto_probe). At that time, queue_cache[0] is NULL and a new
    kmem_cache will be allocated. If the subsequent n2_register_algs call
    fails, the kmem_cache will be released in queue_cache_destroy, but
    queue_cache_init[0] is not set back to NULL.
    
    So when the Module Arithmetic Unit gets probed next (n2_mau_probe),
    queue_cache_init will not allocate a kmem_cache again, but leave it
    as its bogus value, causing a BUG() to trigger when queue_cache[0] is
    eventually passed to kmem_cache_zalloc:

    kernel/acct.c: fix the acct->needcheck check in check_free_space()
    
    commit 4d9570158b6260f449e317a5f9ed030c2504a615 upstream.
    
    As Tsukada explains, the time_is_before_jiffies(acct->needcheck) check
    is very wrong, we need time_is_after_jiffies() to make sys_acct() work.
    
    Ignoring the overflows, the code should "goto out" if needcheck >
    jiffies, while currently it checks "needcheck < jiffies" and thus in the
    likely case check_free_space() does nothing until jiffies overflow.
    
    In particular this means that sys_acct() is simply broken, acct_on()
    sets acct->needcheck = jiffies and expects that check_free_space()
    should set acct->active = 1 after the free-space check, but this won't
    happen if jiffies increments in between.
    
    This was broken by commit 32dc73086015 ("get rid of timer in
    kern/acct.c") in 2011, then another (correct) commit 795a2f22a8ea
    ("acct() should honour the limits from the very beginning") made the
    problem more visible.
