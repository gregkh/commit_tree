    ovl: prevent private clone if bind mount is not allowed
    
    commit 427215d85e8d1476da1a86b8d67aceb485eb3631 upstream.
    
    Add the following checks from __do_loopback() to clone_private_mount() as
    well:
    
     - verify that the mount is in the current namespace

    ppp: Fix generating ppp unit id when ifname is not specified
    
    commit 3125f26c514826077f2a4490b75e9b1c7a644c42 upstream.
    
    When registering new ppp interface via PPPIOCNEWUNIT ioctl then kernel has
    to choose interface name as this ioctl API does not support specifying it.
    
    Kernel in this case register new interface with name "ppp<id>" where <id>
    is the ppp unit id, which can be obtained via PPPIOCGUNIT ioctl. This
    applies also in the case when registering new ppp interface via rtnl
    without supplying IFLA_IFNAME.
    
    PPPIOCNEWUNIT ioctl allows to specify own ppp unit id which will kernel
    assign to ppp interface, in case this ppp id is not already used by other
    ppp interface.
    
    In case user does not specify ppp unit id then kernel choose the first free
    ppp unit id. This applies also for case when creating ppp interface via
    rtnl method as it does not provide a way for specifying own ppp unit id.
    
    If some network interface (does not have to be ppp) has name "ppp<id>"
    with this first free ppp id then PPPIOCNEWUNIT ioctl or rtnl call fails.
    
    And registering new ppp interface is not possible anymore, until interface
    which holds conflicting name is renamed. Or when using rtnl method with
    custom interface name in IFLA_IFNAME.
    
    As list of allocated / used ppp unit ids is not possible to retrieve from
    kernel to userspace, userspace has no idea what happens nor which interface
    is doing this conflict.
    
    So change the algorithm how ppp unit id is generated. And choose the first
    number which is not neither used as ppp unit id nor in some network
    interface with pattern "ppp<id>".
    
    This issue can be simply reproduced by following pppd call when there is no
    ppp interface registered and also no interface with name pattern "ppp<id>":
    
        pppd ifname ppp1 +ipv6 noip noauth nolock local nodetach pty "pppd +ipv6 noip noauth nolock local nodetach notty"
    
    Or by creating the one ppp interface (which gets assigned ppp unit id 0),
    renaming it to "ppp1" and then trying to create a new ppp interface (which
    will always fails as next free ppp unit id is 1, but network interface with
    name "ppp1" exists).
    
    This patch fixes above described issue by generating new and new ppp unit
    id until some non-conflicting id with network interfaces is generated.

    USB:ehci:fix Kunpeng920 ehci hardware problem
    
    commit 26b75952ca0b8b4b3050adb9582c8e2f44d49687 upstream.
    
    Kunpeng920's EHCI controller does not have SBRN register.
    Reading the SBRN register when the controller driver is
    initialized will get 0.
    
    When rebooting the EHCI driver, ehci_shutdown() will be called.
    if the sbrn flag is 0, ehci_shutdown() will return directly.
    The sbrn flag being 0 will cause the EHCI interrupt signal to
    not be turned off after reboot. this interrupt that is not closed
    will cause an exception to the device sharing the interrupt.
    
    Therefore, the EHCI controller of Kunpeng920 needs to skip
    the read operation of the SBRN register.

    has already acquired the spin lock, so the driver should not call 'ssleep'

    alpha: Send stop IPI to send to online CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit caace6ca4e06f09413fb8f8a63319594cfb7d47d ]
    
    This issue was noticed while debugging a shutdown issue where some
    secondary CPUs are not being shutdown correctly.  A fix for that [1] requires
    that secondary cpus be offlined using the cpu_online_mask so that the
    stop operation is a no-op if CPU HOTPLUG is disabled.  I, like the author in
    [1] looked at the architectures and found that alpha is one of two
    architectures that executes smp_send_stop() on all possible CPUs.
    
    On alpha, smp_send_stop() sends an IPI to all possible CPUs but only needs
    to send them to online CPUs.
    
    Send the stop IPI to only the online CPUs.

    reiserfs: check directory items on read from disk
    
    [ Upstream commit 13d257503c0930010ef9eed78b689cec417ab741 ]
    
    While verifying the leaf item that we read from the disk, reiserfs
    doesn't check the directory items, this could cause a crash when we
    read a directory item from the disk that has an invalid deh_location.
    
    This patch adds a check to the directory items read from the disk that
    does a bounds check on deh_location for the directory entries. Any
    directory entry header with a directory entry offset greater than the
    item length is considered invalid.

    MIPS: Malta: Do not byte-swap accesses to the CBUS UART
    
    commit 9a936d6c3d3d6c33ecbadf72dccdb567b5cd3c72 upstream.
    
    Correct big-endian accesses to the CBUS UART, a Malta on-board discrete
    TI16C550C part wired directly to the system controller's device bus, and
    do not use byte swapping with the 32-bit accesses to the device.
    
    The CBUS is used for devices such as the boot flash memory needed early
    on in system bootstrap even before PCI has been initialised.  Therefore
    it uses the system controller's device bus, which follows the endianness
    set with the CPU, which means no byte-swapping is ever required for data
    accesses to CBUS, unlike with PCI.
    
    The CBUS UART uses the UPIO_MEM32 access method, that is the `readl' and
    `writel' MMIO accessors, which on the MIPS platform imply byte-swapping
    with PCI systems.  Consequently the wrong byte lane is accessed with the
    big-endian configuration and the UART is not correctly accessed.
    
    As it happens the UPIO_MEM32BE access method makes use of the `ioread32'
    and `iowrite32' MMIO accessors, which still use `readl' and `writel'
    respectively, however they byte-swap data passed, effectively cancelling
    swapping done with the accessors themselves and making it suitable for
    the CBUS UART.
    
    Make the CBUS UART switch between UPIO_MEM32 and UPIO_MEM32BE then,
    based on the endianness selected.  With this change in place the device
    is correctly recognised with big-endian Malta at boot, along with the
    Super I/O devices behind PCI:
    
    Serial: 8250/16550 driver, 5 ports, IRQ sharing enabled

    serial: 8250: Mask out floating 16/32-bit bus bits
    
    commit e5227c51090e165db4b48dcaa300605bfced7014 upstream.
    
    Make sure only actual 8 bits of the IIR register are used in determining
    the port type in `autoconfig'.
    
    The `serial_in' port accessor returns the `unsigned int' type, meaning
    that with UPIO_AU, UPIO_MEM16, UPIO_MEM32, and UPIO_MEM32BE access types
    more than 8 bits of data are returned, of which the high order bits will
    often come from bus lines that are left floating in the data phase.  For
    example with the MIPS Malta board's CBUS UART, where the registers are
    aligned on 8-byte boundaries and which uses 32-bit accesses, data as
    follows is returned:

    Evidently high-order 24 bits return values previously driven in the
    address phase (the 3 highest order address bits used with the command
    above are masked out in the simple virtual address mapping used here and
    come out at zeros on the external bus), a common scenario with bus lines
    left floating, due to bus capacitance.
    
    Consequently when the value of IIR, mapped at 0x1f000910, is retrieved
    in `autoconfig', it comes out at 0x1f0009c1 and when it is right-shifted
    by 6 and then assigned to 8-bit `scratch' variable, the value calculated
    is 0x27, not one of 0, 1, 2, 3 expected in port type determination.
    
    Fix the issue then, by assigning the value returned from `serial_in' to
    `scratch' first, which masks out 24 high-order bits retrieved, and only
    then right-shift the resulting 8-bit data quantity, producing the value
    of 3 in this case, as expected.  Fix the same issue in `serial_dl_read'.
    
    The problem first appeared with Linux 2.6.9-rc3 which predates our repo
    history, but the origin could be identified with the old MIPS/Linux repo
    also at: <git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ralf/linux.git>
    as commit e0d2356c0777 ("Merge with Linux 2.6.9-rc3."), where code in
    `serial_in' was updated with this case:
    
    +       case UPIO_MEM32:
    +               return readl(up->port.membase + offset);
    +
    
    which made it produce results outside the unsigned 8-bit range for the
    first time, though obviously it is system dependent what actual values
    appear in the high order bits retrieved and it may well have been zeros
    in the relevant positions with the system the change originally was
    intended for.  It is at that point that code in `autoconf' should have
    been updated accordingly, but clearly it was overlooked.

    media: rtl28xxu: fix zero-length control request
    
    commit 76f22c93b209c811bd489950f17f8839adb31901 upstream.
    
    The direction of the pipe argument must match the request-type direction
    bit or control requests may fail depending on the host-controller-driver
    implementation.
    
    Control transfers without a data stage are treated as OUT requests by
    the USB stack and should be using usb_sndctrlpipe(). Failing to do so
    will now trigger a warning.
    
    The driver uses a zero-length i2c-read request for type detection so
    update the control-request code to use usb_sndctrlpipe() in this case.
    
    Note that actually trying to read the i2c register in question does not
    work as the register might not exist (e.g. depending on the demodulator)
    as reported by Eero Lehtinen <debiangamer2@gmail.com>.

    usb: otg-fsm: Fix hrtimer list corruption
    
    commit bf88fef0b6f1488abeca594d377991171c00e52a upstream.
    
    The HNP work can be re-scheduled while it's still in-fly. This results in
    re-initialization of the busy work, resetting the hrtimer's list node of
    the work and crashing kernel with null dereference within kernel/timer
    once work's timer is expired. It's very easy to trigger this problem by
    re-plugging USB cable quickly. Initialize HNP work only once to fix this
    trouble.

    USB: serial: ch341: fix character loss at high transfer rates
    
    commit 3c18e9baee0ef97510dcda78c82285f52626764b upstream.
    
    The chip supports high transfer rates, but with the small default buffers
    (64 bytes read), some entire blocks are regularly lost. This typically
    happens at 1.5 Mbps (which is the default speed on Rockchip devices) when
    used as a console to access U-Boot where the output of the "help" command
    misses many lines and where "printenv" mangles the environment.
    
    The FTDI driver doesn't suffer at all from this. One difference is that
    it uses 512 bytes rx buffers and 256 bytes tx buffers. Adopting these
    values completely resolved the issue, even the output of "dmesg" is
    reliable. I preferred to leave the Tx value unchanged as it is not
    involved in this issue, while a change could increase the risk of
    triggering the same issue with other devices having too small buffers.
    
    I verified that it backports well (and works) at least to 5.4. It's of
    low importance enough to be dropped where it doesn't trivially apply
    anymore.

    Bluetooth: defer cleanup of resources in hci_unregister_dev()
    
    [ Upstream commit e04480920d1eec9c061841399aa6f35b6f987d8b ]
    
    syzbot is hitting might_sleep() warning at hci_sock_dev_event() due to
    calling lock_sock() with rw spinlock held [1].
    
    It seems that history of this locking problem is a trial and error.
    
    Commit b40df5743ee8 ("[PATCH] bluetooth: fix socket locking in
    hci_sock_dev_event()") in 2.6.21-rc4 changed bh_lock_sock() to
    lock_sock() as an attempt to fix lockdep warning.
    
    Then, commit 4ce61d1c7a8e ("[BLUETOOTH]: Fix locking in
    hci_sock_dev_event().") in 2.6.22-rc2 changed lock_sock() to
    local_bh_disable() + bh_lock_sock_nested() as an attempt to fix the
    sleep in atomic context warning.
    
    Then, commit 4b5dd696f81b ("Bluetooth: Remove local_bh_disable() from
    hci_sock.c") in 3.3-rc1 removed local_bh_disable().
    
    Then, commit e305509e678b ("Bluetooth: use correct lock to prevent UAF
    of hdev object") in 5.13-rc5 again changed bh_lock_sock_nested() to
    lock_sock() as an attempt to fix CVE-2021-3573.
    
    This difficulty comes from current implementation that
    hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) is responsible for dropping all
    references from sockets because hci_unregister_dev() immediately
    reclaims resources as soon as returning from
    hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG).
    
    But the history suggests that hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) was not
    doing what it should do.
    
    Therefore, instead of trying to detach sockets from device, let's accept
    not detaching sockets from device at hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG),
    by moving actual cleanup of resources from hci_unregister_dev() to
    hci_cleanup_dev() which is called by bt_host_release() when all
    references to this unregistered device (which is a kobject) are gone.
    
    Since hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) no longer resets
    hci_pi(sk)->hdev, we need to check whether this device was unregistered
    and return an error based on HCI_UNREGISTER flag.  There might be subtle
    behavioral difference in "monitor the hdev" functionality; please report
    if you found something went wrong due to this patch.

    net: pegasus: fix uninit-value in get_interrupt_interval
    
    [ Upstream commit af35fc37354cda3c9c8cc4961b1d24bdc9d27903 ]
    
    Syzbot reported uninit value pegasus_probe(). The problem was in missing
    error handling.
    
    get_interrupt_interval() internally calls read_eprom_word() which can
    fail in some cases. For example: failed to receive usb control message.
    These cases should be handled to prevent uninit value bug, since
    read_eprom_word() will not initialize passed stack variable in case of
    internal failure.
    
    Fail log:

    mips: Fix non-POSIX regexp
    
    [ Upstream commit 28bbbb9875a35975904e46f9b06fa689d051b290 ]
    
    When cross compiling a MIPS kernel on a BSD based HOSTCC leads
    to errors like
    
      SYNC    include/config/auto.conf.cmd - due to: .config
    egrep: empty (sub)expression
      UPD     include/config/kernel.release
      HOSTCC  scripts/dtc/dtc.o - due to target missing
    
    It turns out that egrep uses this egrep pattern:
    
                    (|MINOR_|PATCHLEVEL_)
    
    This is not valid syntax or gives undefined results according
    to POSIX 9.5.3 ERE Grammar
    
            https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html
    
    It seems to be silently accepted by the Linux egrep implementation
    while a BSD host complains.
    
    Such patterns can be replaced by a transformation like
    
            "(|p1|p2)" -> "(p1|p2)?"

    media: videobuf2-core: dequeue if start_streaming fails
    
    [ Upstream commit c592b46907adbeb81243f7eb7a468c36692658b8 ]
    
    If a vb2_queue sets q->min_buffers_needed then when the number of
    queued buffers reaches q->min_buffers_needed, vb2_core_qbuf() will call
    the start_streaming() callback. If start_streaming() returns an error,
    then that error was just returned by vb2_core_qbuf(), but the buffer
    was still queued. However, userspace expects that if VIDIOC_QBUF fails,
    the buffer is returned dequeued.
    
    So if start_streaming() fails, then remove the buffer from the queue,
    thus avoiding this unwanted side-effect.

    scsi: sr: Return correct event when media event code is 3
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c04243a56a7977185b00400e59ca7e108004faf ]
    
    Media event code 3 is defined in the MMC-6 spec as follows:
    
      "MediaRemoval: The media has been removed from the specified slot, and
       the Drive is unable to access the media without user intervention. This
       applies to media changers only."
    
    This indicated that treating the condition as an EJECT_REQUEST was
    appropriate. However, doing so had the unfortunate side-effect of causing
    the drive tray to be physically ejected on resume. Instead treat the event
    as a MEDIA_CHANGE request.

    ALSA: seq: Fix racy deletion of subscriber
    
    commit 97367c97226aab8b298ada954ce12659ee3ad2a4 upstream.
    
    It turned out that the current implementation of the port subscription
    is racy.  The subscription contains two linked lists, and we have to
    add to or delete from both lists.  Since both connection and
    disconnection procedures perform the same order for those two lists
    (i.e. src list, then dest list), when a deletion happens during a
    connection procedure, the src list may be deleted before the dest list
    addition completes, and this may lead to a use-after-free or an Oops,
    even though the access to both lists are protected via mutex.
    
    The simple workaround for this race is to change the access order for
    the disconnection, namely, dest list, then src list.  This assures
    that the connection has been established when disconnecting, and also
    the concurrent deletion can be avoided.
