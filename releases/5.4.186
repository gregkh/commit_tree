    fixup for "arm64 entry: Add macro for reading symbol address from the trampoline"
    
    __sdei_asm_trampoline_next_handler shouldn't have its own name as the
    tramp_data_read_var takes the symbol name, and generates the name for
    the value in the data page if CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE is clear.
    
    This means when CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE is clear, this code won't compile
    as __sdei_asm_trampoline_next_handler doesn't exist.
    
    Use the proper name, and let the macro do its thing.

    VRR capable property is not attached by default to the connector
    It is attached only if VRR is supported.
    So if the driver tries to call drm core set prop function without
    it being attached that causes NULL dereference.

    ARM: 9178/1: fix unmet dependency on BITREVERSE for HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE
    
    [ Upstream commit 11c57c3ba94da74c3446924260e34e0b1950b5d7 ]
    
    Resending this to properly add it to the patch tracker - thanks for letting
    me know, Arnd :)
    
    When ARM is enabled, and BITREVERSE is disabled,
    Kbuild gives the following warning:
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE
      Depends on [n]: BITREVERSE [=n]
      Selected by [y]:
      - ARM [=y] && (CPU_32v7M [=n] || CPU_32v7 [=y]) && !CPU_32v6 [=n]
    
    This is because ARM selects HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE
    without selecting BITREVERSE, despite
    HAVE_ARCH_BITREVERSE depending on BITREVERSE.
    
    This unmet dependency bug was found by Kismet,
    a static analysis tool for Kconfig. Please advise if this
    is not the appropriate solution.

    ...for each but CPU 0/boot.
    Basic debug printks right before the mentioned line say:
    
    [    0.048170] CPU: 1, smt_mask:
    
    So smt_mask, which is sibling mask obviously, is empty when entering
    the function.
    This is critical, as sched_core_cpu_starting() calculates
    core-scheduling parameters only once per CPU start, and it's crucial
    to have all the parameters filled in at that moment (at least it
    uses cpu_smt_mask() which in fact is `&cpu_sibling_map[cpu]` on
    MIPS).
    
    A bit of debugging led me to that set_cpu_sibling_map() performing
    the actual map calculation, was being invocated after
    notify_cpu_start(), and exactly the latter function starts CPU HP
    callback round (sched_core_cpu_starting() is basically a CPU HP
    callback).
    While the flow is same on ARM64 (maps after the notifier, although
    before calling set_cpu_online()), x86 started calculating sibling
    maps earlier than starting the CPU HP callbacks in Linux 4.14 (see
    [0] for the reference). Neither me nor my brief tests couldn't find
    any potential caveats in calculating the maps right after performing
    delay calibration, but the WARN splat is now gone.
    The very same debug prints now yield exactly what I expected from
    them:

    arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3399-puma eMMC HS400 signal integrity
    
    [ Upstream commit 62966cbdda8a92f82d966a45aa671e788b2006f7 ]
    
    There are signal integrity issues running the eMMC at 200MHz on Puma
    RK3399-Q7.
    
    Similar to the work-around found for RK3399 Gru boards, lowering the
    frequency to 100MHz made the eMMC much more stable, so let's lower the
    frequency to 100MHz.
    
    It might be possible to run at 150MHz as on RK3399 Gru boards but only
    100MHz was extensively tested.

    xfrm: Fix xfrm migrate issues when address family changes
    
    [ Upstream commit e03c3bba351f99ad932e8f06baa9da1afc418e02 ]
    
    xfrm_migrate cannot handle address family change of an xfrm_state.
    The symptons are the xfrm_state will be migrated to a wrong address,
    and sending as well as receiving packets wil be broken.
    
    This commit fixes it by breaking the original xfrm_state_clone
    method into two steps so as to update the props.family before
    running xfrm_init_state. As the result, xfrm_state's inner mode,
    outer mode, type and IP header length in xfrm_state_migrate can
    be updated with the new address family.

    xfrm: Check if_id in xfrm_migrate
    
    [ Upstream commit c1aca3080e382886e2e58e809787441984a2f89b ]
    
    This patch enables distinguishing SAs and SPs based on if_id during
    the xfrm_migrate flow. This ensures support for xfrm interfaces
    throughout the SA/SP lifecycle.
    
    When there are multiple existing SPs with the same direction,
    the same xfrm_selector and different endpoint addresses,
    xfrm_migrate might fail with ENODATA.
    
    Specifically, the code path for performing xfrm_migrate is:
      Stage 1: find policy to migrate with
        xfrm_migrate_policy_find(sel, dir, type, net)
      Stage 2: find and update state(s) with
        xfrm_migrate_state_find(mp, net)
      Stage 3: update endpoint address(es) of template(s) with
        xfrm_policy_migrate(pol, m, num_migrate)
    
    Currently "Stage 1" always returns the first xfrm_policy that
    matches, and "Stage 3" looks for the xfrm_tmpl that matches the
    old endpoint address. Thus if there are multiple xfrm_policy
    with same selector, direction, type and net, "Stage 1" might
    rertun a wrong xfrm_policy and "Stage 3" will fail with ENODATA
    because it cannot find a xfrm_tmpl with the matching endpoint
    address.
    
    The fix is to allow userspace to pass an if_id and add if_id
    to the matching rule in Stage 1 and Stage 2 since if_id is a
    unique ID for xfrm_policy and xfrm_state. For compatibility,
    if_id will only be checked if the attribute is set.

    commit 228a26b912287934789023b4132ba76065d9491c upstream.
    
    Future CPUs may implement a clearbhb instruction that is sufficient
    to mitigate SpectreBHB. CPUs that implement this instruction, but
    not CSV2.3 must be affected by Spectre-BHB.
    
    Add support to use this instruction as the BHB mitigation on CPUs
    that support it. The instruction is in the hint space, so it will
    be treated by a NOP as older CPUs.

    arm64: Mitigate spectre style branch history side channels
    
    commit 558c303c9734af5a813739cd284879227f7297d2 upstream.
    
    Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors can
    make use of branch history to influence future speculation.
    When taking an exception from user-space, a sequence of branches
    or a firmware call overwrites or invalidates the branch history.
    
    The sequence of branches is added to the vectors, and should appear
    before the first indirect branch. For systems using KPTI the sequence
    is added to the kpti trampoline where it has a free register as the exit
    from the trampoline is via a 'ret'. For systems not using KPTI, the same
    register tricks are used to free up a register in the vectors.
    
    For the firmware call, arch-workaround-3 clobbers 4 registers, so
    there is no choice but to save them to the EL1 stack. This only happens
    for entry from EL0, so if we take an exception due to the stack access,
    it will not become re-entrant.
    
    For KVM, the existing branch-predictor-hardening vectors are used.
    When a spectre version of these vectors is in use, the firmware call
    is sufficient to mitigate against Spectre-BHB. For the non-spectre
    versions, the sequence of branches is added to the indirect vector.

    KVM: arm64: Add templates for BHB mitigation sequences

    arm64: Add percpu vectors for EL1
    
    commit bd09128d16fac3c34b80bd6a29088ac632e8ce09 upstream.
    
    The Spectre-BHB workaround adds a firmware call to the vectors. This
    is needed on some CPUs, but not others. To avoid the unaffected CPU in
    a big/little pair from making the firmware call, create per cpu vectors.
    
    The per-cpu vectors only apply when returning from EL0.
    
    Systems using KPTI can use the canonical 'full-fat' vectors directly at
    EL1, the trampoline exit code will switch to this_cpu_vector on exit to
    EL0. Systems not using KPTI should always use this_cpu_vector.
    
    this_cpu_vector will point at a vector in tramp_vecs or
    __bp_harden_el1_vectors, depending on whether KPTI is in use.

    arm64: entry: Add macro for reading symbol addresses from the trampoline
    
    commit b28a8eebe81c186fdb1a0078263b30576c8e1f42 upstream.
    
    The trampoline code needs to use the address of symbols in the wider
    kernel, e.g. vectors. PC-relative addressing wouldn't work as the
    trampoline code doesn't run at the address the linker expected.
    
    tramp_ventry uses a literal pool, unless CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE is
    set, in which case it uses the data page as a literal pool because
    the data page can be unmapped when running in user-space, which is
    required for CPUs vulnerable to meltdown.
    
    Pull this logic out as a macro, instead of adding a third copy
    of it.

    commit ba2689234be92024e5635d30fe744f4853ad97db upstream.
    
    Some CPUs affected by Spectre-BHB need a sequence of branches, or a
    firmware call to be run before any indirect branch. This needs to go
    in the vectors. No CPU needs both.
    
    While this can be patched in, it would run on all CPUs as there is a
    single set of vectors. If only one part of a big/little combination is
    affected, the unaffected CPUs have to run the mitigation too.
    
    Create extra vectors that include the sequence. Subsequent patches will
    allow affected CPUs to select this set of vectors. Later patches will
    modify the loop count to match what the CPU requires.

    Systems using kpti enter and exit the kernel through a trampoline mapping

    to find the address of a symbol in the trampoline mapping.
    
    Adding extra sets of vectors will expand the size of the entry.tramp.text

    use the extra register to avoid the 4K limit of the 12 bit immediate.

    commit c091fb6ae059cda563b2a4d93fdbc548ef34e1d6 upstream.
    
    The trampoline code has a data page that holds the address of the vectors,
    which is unmapped when running in user-space. This ensures that with
    CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE, the randomised address of the kernel can't be
    discovered until after the kernel has been mapped.
    
    If the trampoline text page is extended to include multiple sets of
    vectors, it will be larger than a single page, making it tricky to
    find the data page without knowing the size of the trampoline text
    pages, which will vary with PAGE_SIZE.
    
    Move the data page to appear before the text page. This allows the
    data page to be found without knowing the size of the trampoline text
    pages. 'tramp_vectors' is used to refer to the beginning of the
    .entry.tramp.text section, do that explicitly.

    arm64: entry: Free up another register on kpti's tramp_exit path
    
    commit 03aff3a77a58b5b52a77e00537a42090ad57b80b upstream.
    
    Kpti stashes x30 in far_el1 while it uses x30 for all its work.
    
    Making the vectors a per-cpu data structure will require a second
    register.
    
    Allow tramp_exit two registers before it unmaps the kernel, by
    leaving x30 on the stack, and stashing x29 in far_el1.

    arm64: entry: Make the trampoline cleanup optional
    
    commit d739da1694a0eaef0358a42b76904b611539b77b upstream.
    
    Subsequent patches will add additional sets of vectors that use
    the same tricks as the kpti vectors to reach the full-fat vectors.
    The full-fat vectors contain some cleanup for kpti that is patched
    in by alternatives when kpti is in use. Once there are additional
    vectors, the cleanup will be needed in more cases.
    
    But on big/little systems, the cleanup would be harmful if no
    trampoline vector were in use. Instead of forcing CPUs that don't
    need a trampoline vector to use one, make the trampoline cleanup
    optional.
    
    Entry at the top of the vectors will skip the cleanup. The trampoline
    vectors can then skip the first instruction, triggering the cleanup
    to run.

    sctp: fix the processing for INIT chunk
    
    commit eae5783908042a762c24e1bd11876edb91d314b1 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes the problems below:
    
    1. In non-shutdown_ack_sent states: in sctp_sf_do_5_1B_init() and
       sctp_sf_do_5_2_2_dupinit():
    
      chunk length check should be done before any checks that may cause
      to send abort, as making packet for abort will access the init_tag
      from init_hdr in sctp_ootb_pkt_new().
    
    2. In shutdown_ack_sent state: in sctp_sf_do_9_2_reshutack():
    
      The same checks as does in sctp_sf_do_5_2_2_dupinit() is needed
      for sctp_sf_do_9_2_reshutack().
