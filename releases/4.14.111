    ACPI / video: Extend chassis-type detection with a "Lunch Box" check
    
    [ Upstream commit d693c008e3ca04db5916ff72e68ce661888a913b ]
    
    Commit 53fa1f6e8a59 ("ACPI / video: Only default only_lcd to true on
    Win8-ready _desktops_") introduced chassis type detection, limiting the
    lcd_only check for the backlight to devices where the chassis-type
    indicates their is no builtin LCD panel.
    
    The purpose of the lcd_only check is to avoid advertising a backlight
    interface on desktops, since skylake and newer machines seem to always
    have a backlight interface even if there is no LCD panel. The limiting
    of this check to desktops only was done to avoid breaking backlight
    support on some laptops which do not have the lcd flag set.
    
    The Fujitsu ESPRIMO Q910 which is a compact (NUC like) desktop machine
    has a chassis type of 0x10 aka "Lunch Box". Without the lcd_only check
    we end up falsely advertising backlight/brightness control on this
    device. This commit extend the dmi_is_desktop check to return true
    for type 0x10 to fix this.

    drm/dp/mst: Configure no_stop_bit correctly for remote i2c xfers
    
    [ Upstream commit c978ae9bde582e82a04c63a4071701691dd8b35c ]
    
    We aren't supposed to force a stop+start between every i2c msg
    when performing multi message transfers. This should eg. cause
    the DDC segment address to be reset back to 0 between writing
    the segment address and reading the actual EDID extension block.
    
    To quote the E-DDC spec:
    "... this standard requires that the segment pointer be
     reset to 00h when a NO ACK or a STOP condition is received."
    
    Since we're going to touch this might as well consult the
    I2C_M_STOP flag to determine whether we want to force the stop
    or not.

    dmaengine: tegra: avoid overflow of byte tracking
    
    [ Upstream commit e486df39305864604b7e25f2a95d51039517ac57 ]
    
    The dma_desc->bytes_transferred counter tracks the number of bytes
    moved by the DMA channel. This is then used to calculate the information
    passed back in the in the tegra_dma_tx_status callback, which is usually
    fine.
    
    When the DMA channel is configured as continous, then the bytes_transferred
    counter will increase over time and eventually overflow to become negative
    so the residue count will become invalid and the ALSA sound-dma code will
    report invalid hardware pointer values to the application. This results in
    some users becoming confused about the playout position and putting audio
    data in the wrong place.
    
    To fix this issue, always ensure the bytes_transferred field is modulo the
    size of the request. We only do this for the case of the cyclic transfer
    done ISR as anyone attempting to move 2GiB of DMA data in one transfer
    is unlikely.
    
    Note, we don't fix the issue that we should /never/ transfer a negative
    number of bytes so we could make those fields unsigned.

    clk: rockchip: fix frac settings of GPLL clock for rk3328
    
    [ Upstream commit a0e447b0c50240a90ab84b7126b3c06b0bab4adc ]
    
    This patch fixes settings of GPLL frequency in fractional mode for
    rk3328. In this mode, FOUTVCO is calcurated by following formula:
      FOUTVCO = FREF * FBDIV / REFDIV + ((FREF * FRAC / REFDIV) >> 24)
    
    The problem is in FREF * FRAC >> 24 term. This result always lacks
    one from target value is specified by rate member. For example first
    itme of rk3328_pll_frac_rate originally has
      - rate  : 1016064000
      - refdiv: 3
      - fbdiv : 127
      - frac  : 134217
      - FREF * FBDIV / REFDIV        = 1016000000
      - (FREF * FRAC / REFDIV) >> 24 = 63999
    Thus calculated rate is 1016063999. It seems wrong.
    
    If frac has 134218 (it is increased 1 from original value), second
    term is 64000. All other items have same situation. So this patch
    adds 1 to frac member in all items of rk3328_pll_frac_rate.

    x86/build: Mark per-CPU symbols as absolute explicitly for LLD
    
    [ Upstream commit d071ae09a4a1414c1433d5ae9908959a7325b0ad ]
    
    Accessing per-CPU variables is done by finding the offset of the
    variable in the per-CPU block and adding it to the address of the
    respective CPU's block.
    
    Section 3.10.8 of ld.bfd's documentation states:
    
      For expressions involving numbers, relative addresses and absolute
      addresses, ld follows these rules to evaluate terms:
    
      Other binary operations, that is, between two relative addresses
      not in the same section, or between a relative address and an
      absolute address, first convert any non-absolute term to an
      absolute address before applying the operator."
    
    Note that LLVM's linker does not adhere to the GNU ld's implementation
    and as such requires implicitly-absolute terms to be explicitly marked
    as absolute in the linker script. If not, it fails currently with:
    
      ld.lld: error: ./arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds:153: at least one side of the expression must be absolute
      ld.lld: error: ./arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds:154: at least one side of the expression must be absolute
      Makefile:1040: recipe for target 'vmlinux' failed
    
    This is not a functional change for ld.bfd which converts the term to an
    absolute symbol anyways as specified above.

    selinux: do not override context on context mounts
    
    [ Upstream commit 53e0c2aa9a59a48e3798ef193d573ade85aa80f5 ]
    
    Ignore all selinux_inode_notifysecctx() calls on mounts with SBLABEL_MNT
    flag unset. This is achived by returning -EOPNOTSUPP for this case in
    selinux_inode_setsecurtity() (because that function should not be called
    in such case anyway) and translating this error to 0 in
    selinux_inode_notifysecctx().
    
    This fixes behavior of kernfs-based filesystems when mounted with the
    'context=' option. Before this patch, if a node's context had been
    explicitly set to a non-default value and later the filesystem has been
    remounted with the 'context=' option, then this node would show up as
    having the manually-set context and not the mount-specified one.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
        # mount -t cgroup2 cgroup2 /sys/fs/cgroup/unified
        # chcon unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 /sys/fs/cgroup/unified/cgroup.stat

    x86/build: Specify elf_i386 linker emulation explicitly for i386 objects
    
    [ Upstream commit 927185c124d62a9a4d35878d7f6d432a166b74e3 ]
    
    The kernel uses the OUTPUT_FORMAT linker script command in it's linker
    scripts. Most of the time, the -m option is passed to the linker with
    correct architecture, but sometimes (at least for x86_64) the -m option
    contradicts the OUTPUT_FORMAT directive.
    
    Specifically, arch/x86/boot and arch/x86/realmode/rm produce i386 object
    files, but are linked with the -m elf_x86_64 linker flag when building
    for x86_64.
    
    The GNU linker manpage doesn't explicitly state any tie-breakers between
    -m and OUTPUT_FORMAT. But with BFD and Gold linkers, OUTPUT_FORMAT
    overrides the emulation value specified with the -m option.
    
    LLVM lld has a different behavior, however. When supplied with
    contradicting -m and OUTPUT_FORMAT values it fails with the following
    error message:
    
      ld.lld: error: arch/x86/realmode/rm/header.o is incompatible with elf_x86_64
    
    Therefore, just add the correct -m after the incorrect one (it overrides
    it), so the linker invocation looks like this:
    
      ld -m elf_x86_64 -z max-page-size=0x200000 -m elf_i386 --emit-relocs -T \
        realmode.lds header.o trampoline_64.o stack.o reboot.o -o realmode.elf
    
    This is not a functional change for GNU ld, because (although not
    explicitly documented) OUTPUT_FORMAT overrides -m EMULATION.
    
    Tested by building x86_64 kernel with GNU gcc/ld toolchain and booting
    it in QEMU.

    drm: Auto-set allow_fb_modifiers when given modifiers at plane init
    
    [ Upstream commit 890880ddfdbe256083170866e49c87618b706ac7 ]

    planes, we can infer that they allow framebuffer modifiers and set the
    driver's allow_fb_modifiers mode config element.
    
    In case the allow_fb_modifiers element was not set (some drivers tend
    to set them after registering planes), the modifiers will still be
    registered but won't be available to userspace unless the flag is set
    later. However in that case, the IN_FORMATS blob won't be created.
    
    In order to avoid this case and generally reduce the trouble associated
    with the flag, always set allow_fb_modifiers when a non-empty list of
    format modifiers is passed at plane init.

    regulator: act8865: Fix act8600_sudcdc_voltage_ranges setting
    
    [ Upstream commit f01a7beb6791f1c419424c1a6958b7d0a289c974 ]
    
    The act8600_sudcdc_voltage_ranges setting does not match the datasheet.
    
    The problems in below entry:
      REGULATOR_LINEAR_RANGE(19000000, 191, 255, 400000),
    
    1. The off-by-one min_sel causes wrong volatage calculation.
       The min_sel should be 192.
    2. According to the datasheet[1] Table 7. (on page 43):
       The selector 248 (0b11111000) ~ 255 (0b11111111) are 41.400V.
    
    Also fix off-by-one for ACT8600_SUDCDC_VOLTAGE_NUM.

    media: s5p-jpeg: Check for fmt_ver_flag when doing fmt enumeration
    
    [ Upstream commit 49710c32cd9d6626a77c9f5f978a5f58cb536b35 ]
    
    Previously when doing format enumeration, it was returning all
     formats supported by driver, even if they're not supported by hw.
    Add missing check for fmt_ver_flag, so it'll be fixed and only those
     supported by hw will be returned. Similar thing is already done
     in s5p_jpeg_find_format.
    
    It was found by using v4l2-compliance tool and checking result
     of VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT/FRAMESIZES/FRAMEINTERVALS test
    and using v4l2-ctl to get list of all supported formats.
    
    Tested on s5pv210-galaxys (Samsung i9000 phone).

    netfilter: physdev: relax br_netfilter dependency
    
    [ Upstream commit 8e2f311a68494a6677c1724bdcb10bada21af37c ]
    
    Following command:
      iptables -D FORWARD -m physdev ...
    causes connectivity loss in some setups.
    
    Reason is that iptables userspace will probe kernel for the module revision
    of the physdev patch, and physdev has an artificial dependency on
    br_netfilter (xt_physdev use makes no sense unless a br_netfilter module
    is loaded).
    
    This causes the "phydev" module to be loaded, which in turn enables the
    "call-iptables" infrastructure.
    
    bridged packets might then get dropped by the iptables ruleset.
    
    The better fix would be to change the "call-iptables" defaults to 0 and
    enforce explicit setting to 1, but that breaks backwards compatibility.
    
    This does the next best thing: add a request_module call to checkentry.
    This was a stray '-D ... -m physdev' won't activate br_netfilter
    anymore.

    In async_tx_test_ack(), it uses flags in struct dma_async_tx_descriptor
    to check the ACK status. As hidma reuses the descriptor in a free list
    when hidma_prep_dma_*(memcpy/memset) is called, the flag will keep ACKed
    if the descriptor has been used before. This will cause a BUG_ON in
    async_tx_quiesce().

    [ Upstream commit 546c0547555efca8ba8c120716c325435e29df1b ]
    
    When dma_cookie_complete() is called in hidma_process_completed(),
    dma_cookie_status() will return DMA_COMPLETE in hidma_tx_status(). Then,
    hidma_txn_is_success() will be called to use channel cookie

    assigns mchan->last_success after dma_cookie_complete(). This causes

      commit 40fa3780bac2 ("sched/core: Take the hotplug lock in sched_init_smp()")
    
    Those warnings are actually harmless, since we cannot have hotplug
    operations at the time they appear. Instead of starting to sprinkle
    useless hotplug lock operations in the init codepaths, mute the
    warnings until they start warning about real problems.

    [ Upstream commit 24d48a61f2666630da130cc2ec2e526eacf229e3 ]
    
    Commit '3d035f580699 ("drivers/char/hpet.c: allow user controlled mmap for
    user processes")' introduced a new kernel command line parameter hpet_mmap,
    that is required to expose the memory map of the HPET registers to
    user-space. Unfortunately the kernel command line parameter 'hpet_mmap' is
    broken and never takes effect due to missing '=' character in the __setup()
    code of hpet_mmap_enable.
    
    Before this patch:
    
    dmesg output with the kernel command line parameter hpet_mmap=1

    HID: intel-ish: ipc: handle PIMR before ish_wakeup also clear PISR busy_clear bit
    
    [ Upstream commit 2edefc056e4f0e6ec9508dd1aca2c18fa320efef ]
    
    Host driver should handle interrupt mask register earlier than wake up ish FW
    else there will be conditions when FW interrupt comes, host PIMR register still
    not set ready, so move the interrupt mask setting before ish_wakeup.
    
    Clear PISR busy_clear bit in ish_irq_handler. If not clear, there will be
    conditions host driver received a busy_clear interrupt (before the busy_clear
    mask bit is ready), it will return IRQ_NONE after check_generated_interrupt,
    the interrupt will never be cleared, causing the DEVICE not sending following
    IRQ.
    
    Since PISR clear should not be called for the CHV device we do this change.
    After the change, both ISH2HOST interrupt and busy_clear interrupt will be
    considered as interrupt from ISH, busy_clear interrupt will return IRQ_HANDLED
    from IPC_IS_BUSY check.

    hwrng: virtio - Avoid repeated init of completion
    
    [ Upstream commit aef027db48da56b6f25d0e54c07c8401ada6ce21 ]
    
    The virtio-rng driver uses a completion called have_data to wait for a
    virtio read to be fulfilled by the hypervisor. The completion is reset
    before placing a buffer on the virtio queue and completed by the virtio
    callback once data has been written into the buffer.
    
    Prior to this commit, the driver called init_completion on this
    completion both during probe as well as when registering virtio buffers
    as part of a hwrng read operation. The second of these init_completion
    calls should instead be reinit_completion because the have_data
    completion has already been inited by probe. As described in
    Documentation/scheduler/completion.txt, "Calling init_completion() twice
    on the same completion object is most likely a bug".
    
    This bug was present in the initial implementation of virtio-rng in
    f7f510ec1957 ("virtio: An entropy device, as suggested by hpa"). Back
    then the have_data completion was a single static completion rather than
    a member of one of potentially multiple virtrng_info structs as
    implemented later by 08e53fbdb85c ("virtio-rng: support multiple
    virtio-rng devices"). The original driver incorrectly used
    init_completion rather than INIT_COMPLETION to reset have_data during
    read.
    
    Tested by running `head -c48 /dev/random | hexdump` within crosvm, the
    Chrome OS virtual machine monitor, and confirming that the virtio-rng
    driver successfully produces random bytes from the host.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix OTG events when gadget driver isn't loaded
    
    [ Upstream commit 169e3b68cadb5775daca009ced4faf01ffd97dcf ]
    
    On v3.10a in dual-role mode, if port is in device mode
    and gadget driver isn't loaded, the OTG event interrupts don't
    come through.
    
    It seems that if the core is configured to be OTG2.0 only,
    then we can't leave the DCFG.DEVSPD at Super-speed (default)
    if we expect OTG to work properly. It must be set to High-speed.
    
    Fix this issue by configuring DCFG.DEVSPD to the supported
    maximum speed at gadget init. Device tree still needs to provide
    correct supported maximum speed for this to work.
    
    This issue wasn't present on v2.40a but is seen on v3.10a.
    It doesn't cause any side effects on v2.40a.

    powerpc/pseries: Perform full re-add of CPU for topology update post-migration
    
    [ Upstream commit 81b61324922c67f73813d8a9c175f3c153f6a1c6 ]
    
    On pseries systems, performing a partition migration can result in
    altering the nodes a CPU is assigned to on the destination system. For
    exampl, pre-migration on the source system CPUs are in node 1 and 3,
    post-migration on the destination system CPUs are in nodes 2 and 3.
    
    Handling the node change for a CPU can cause corruption in the slab
    cache if we hit a timing where a CPUs node is changed while cache_reap()
    is invoked. The corruption occurs because the slab cache code appears
    to rely on the CPU and slab cache pages being on the same node.
    
    The current dynamic updating of a CPUs node done in arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c
    does not prevent us from hitting this scenario.
    
    Changing the device tree property update notification handler that
    recognizes an affinity change for a CPU to do a full DLPAR remove and
    add of the CPU instead of dynamically changing its node resolves this
    issue.

    tty: increase the default flip buffer limit to 2*640K
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ab57b76ebf632bf2231ccabe26bea33868118c6 ]
    
    We increase the default limit for buffer memory allocation by a factor of
    10 to 640K to prevent data loss when using fast serial interfaces.
    
    For example when using RS485 without flow-control at speeds of 1Mbit/s
    an upwards we've run into problems such as applications being too slow
    to read out this buffer (on embedded devices based on imx53 or imx6).
    
    If you want to write transmitted data to a slow SD card and thus have
    realtime requirements, this limit can become a problem.
    
    That shouldn't be the case and 640K buffers fix such problems for us.
    
    This value is a maximum limit for allocation only. It has no effect
    on systems that currently run fine. When transmission is slow enough
    applications and hardware can keep up and increasing this limit
    doesn't change anything.
    
    It only _allows_ to allocate more than 2*64K in cases we currently fail to
    allocate memory despite having some.

    cgroup/pids: turn cgroup_subsys->free() into cgroup_subsys->release() to fix the accounting
    
    [ Upstream commit 51bee5abeab2058ea5813c5615d6197a23dbf041 ]
    
    The only user of cgroup_subsys->free() callback is pids_cgrp_subsys which
    needs pids_free() to uncharge the pid.
    
    However, ->free() is called from __put_task_struct()->cgroup_free() and this
    is too late. Even the trivial program which does
    
            for (;;) {
                    int pid = fork();
                    assert(pid >= 0);
                    if (pid)
                            wait(NULL);
                    else
                            exit(0);
            }
    
    can run out of limits because release_task()->call_rcu(delayed_put_task_struct)
    implies an RCU gp after the task/pid goes away and before the final put().
    
    Test-case:
    
            mkdir -p /tmp/CG
            mount -t cgroup2 none /tmp/CG
            echo '+pids' > /tmp/CG/cgroup.subtree_control
    
            mkdir /tmp/CG/PID
            echo 2 > /tmp/CG/PID/pids.max
    
            perl -e 'while ($p = fork) { wait; } $p // die "fork failed: $!\n"' &
            echo $! > /tmp/CG/PID/cgroup.procs
    
    Without this patch the forking process fails soon after migration.
    
    Rename cgroup_subsys->free() to cgroup_subsys->release() and move the callsite
    into the new helper, cgroup_release(), called by release_task() which actually
    frees the pid(s).

    expect it to never exit - at least not until the system as a whole is
    reset by some method.
    
    In the absence of erratum 754327, this code assembles to:
    
            b       .
    
    In other words, an infinite loop.  When erratum 754327 is enabled,
    this becomes:
    
    1:      dmb
            b       1b
    
    It has been observed that on some systems (eg, OMAP4) where, if a
    crash is triggered, the system tries to kexec into the panic kernel,
    but fails after taking the secondary CPU down - placing it into one
    of these loops.  This causes the system to livelock, and the most
    noticable effect is the system stops after issuing:
    
            Loading crashdump kernel...
    
    to the system console.
    
    The tested as working solution I came up with was to add wfe() to
    these infinite loops thusly:
    
            while (1) {
                    cpu_relax();
                    wfe();
            }
    
    which, without 754327 builds to:
    
    1:      wfe
            b       1b
    
    or with 754327 is enabled:
    
    1:      dmb
            wfe
            b       1b
    
    Adding "wfe" does two things depending on the environment we're running
    under:
    - where we're running on bare metal, and the processor implements
      "wfe", it stops us spinning endlessly in a loop where we're never
      going to do any useful work.
    - if we're running in a VM, it allows the CPU to be given back to the
      hypervisor and rescheduled for other purposes (maybe a different VM)
      rather than wasting CPU cycles inside a crashed VM.
    
    However, in light of erratum 794072, Will Deacon wanted to see 10 nops
    as well - which is reasonable to cover the case where we have erratum
    754327 enabled _and_ we have a processor that doesn't implement the
    wfe hint.
    
    So, we now end up with:
    
    1:      wfe
            b       1b
    
    when erratum 754327 is disabled, or:
    
    1:      dmb
            nop
            nop
            nop
            nop
            nop
            nop
            nop
            nop
            nop
            nop
            wfe
            b       1b
    
    when erratum 754327 is enabled.  We also get the dmb + 10 nop
    sequence elsewhere in the kernel, in terminating loops.
    
    This is reasonable - it means we get the workaround for erratum
    794072 when erratum 754327 is enabled, but still relinquish the dead
    processor - either by placing it in a lower power mode when wfe is
    implemented as such or by returning it to the hypervisior, or in the
    case where wfe is a no-op, we use the workaround specified in erratum
    794072 to avoid the problem.
    
    These as two entirely orthogonal problems - the 10 nops addresses
    erratum 794072, and the wfe is an optimisation that makes the system
    more efficient when crashed either in terms of power consumption or
    by allowing the host/other VMs to make use of the CPU.
    
    I don't see any reason not to use kexec() inside a VM - it has the
    potential to provide automated recovery from a failure of the VMs
    kernel with the opportunity for saving a crashdump of the failure.
    A panic() with a reboot timeout won't do that, and reading the
    libvirt documentation, setting on_reboot to "preserve" won't either
    (the documentation states "The preserve action for an on_reboot event
    is treated as a destroy".)  Surely it has to be a good thing to
    avoiding having CPUs spinning inside a VM that is doing no useful
    work.

    ARM: 8830/1: NOMMU: Toggle only bits in EXC_RETURN we are really care of
    
    [ Upstream commit 72cd4064fccaae15ab84d40d4be23667402df4ed ]
    
    ARMv8M introduces support for Security extension to M class, among
    other things it affects exception handling, especially, encoding of
    EXC_RETURN.
    
    The new bits have been added:
    
    Bit [6] Secure or Non-secure stack
    Bit [5] Default callee register stacking
    Bit [0] Exception Secure
    
    which conflicts with hard-coded value of EXC_RETURN:
    
    In fact, we only care of few bits:
    
    Bit [3]  Mode (0 - Handler, 1 - Thread)
    Bit [2]  Stack pointer selection (0 - Main, 1 - Process)
    
    We can toggle only those bits and left other bits as they were on
    exception entry.
    
    It is basically, what patch does - saves EXC_RETURN when we do
    transition form Thread to Handler mode (it is first svc), so later
    saved value is used instead of EXC_RET_THREADMODE_PROCESSSTACK.

    efi/arm/arm64: Allow SetVirtualAddressMap() to be omitted
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e46c2a956215482418d7b315749fb1b6c6bc224 ]
    
    The UEFI spec revision 2.7 errata A section 8.4 has the following to
    say about the virtual memory runtime services:
    
      "This section contains function definitions for the virtual memory
      support that may be optionally used by an operating system at runtime.
      If an operating system chooses to make EFI runtime service calls in a
      virtual addressing mode instead of the flat physical mode, then the
      operating system must use the services in this section to switch the
      EFI runtime services from flat physical addressing to virtual
      addressing."
    
    So it is pretty clear that calling SetVirtualAddressMap() is entirely
    optional, and so there is no point in doing so unless it achieves
    anything useful for us.
    
    This is not the case for 64-bit ARM. The identity mapping used by the
    firmware is arbitrarily converted into another permutation of userland
    addresses (i.e., bits [63:48] cleared), and the runtime code could easily
    deal with the original layout in exactly the same way as it deals with
    the converted layout. However, due to constraints related to page size
    differences if the OS is not running with 4k pages, and related to
    systems that may expose the individual sections of PE/COFF runtime
    modules as different memory regions, creating the virtual layout is a
    bit fiddly, and requires us to sort the memory map and reason about
    adjacent regions with identical memory types etc etc.
    
    So the obvious fix is to stop calling SetVirtualAddressMap() altogether
    on arm64 systems. However, to avoid surprises, which are notoriously
    hard to diagnose when it comes to OS<->firmware interactions, let's
    start by making it an opt-out feature, and implement support for the
    'efi=novamap' kernel command line parameter on ARM and arm64 systems.
    
    ( Note that 32-bit ARM generally does require SetVirtualAddressMap() to be
      used, given that the physical memory map and the kernel virtual address
      map are not guaranteed to be non-overlapping like on arm64. However,
      having support for efi=novamap,noruntime on 32-bit ARM, combined with
      the recently proposed support for earlycon=efifb, is likely to be useful
      to diagnose boot issues on such systems if they have no accessible serial
      port. )

    Improve the DTS files by removing all the leading "0x" and zeros to fix
    the following dtc warnings:
    
    Warning (unit_address_format): Node /XXX unit name should not have leading "0x"
    
    and
    
    Warning (unit_address_format): Node /XXX unit name should not have leading 0s
    
    Converted using the following command:
    
    find . -type f \( -iname *.dts -o -iname *.dtsi \) -exec sed -i -e "s/@\([0-9a-fA-FxX\.;:#]+\)\s*{/@\L\1 {/g" -e "s/@0x\(.*\) {/@\1 {/g" -e "s/@0+\(.*\) {/@\1 {/g" {} +
    
    For simplicity, two sed expressions were used to solve each warnings
    separately.
    
    To make the regex expression more robust a few other issues were resolved,
    namely setting unit-address to lower case, and adding a whitespace before
    the opening curly brace:
    
    https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Linux#Linux_conventions
    
    This will solve as a side effect warning:
    
    Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /XXX@<UPPER> simple-bus unit address format error, expected "<lower>"

    efi/memattr: Don't bail on zero VA if it equals the region's PA
    
    [ Upstream commit 5de0fef0230f3c8d75cff450a71740a7bf2db866 ]
    
    The EFI memory attributes code cross-references the EFI memory map with
    the more granular EFI memory attributes table to ensure that they are in
    sync before applying the strict permissions to the regions it describes.
    
    Since we always install virtual mappings for the EFI runtime regions to
    which these strict permissions apply, we currently perform a sanity check
    on the EFI memory descriptor, and ensure that the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME bit
    is set, and that the virtual address has been assigned.
    
    However, in cases where a runtime region exists at physical address 0x0,
    and the virtual mapping equals the physical mapping, e.g., when running
    in mixed mode on x86, we encounter a memory descriptor with the runtime
    attribute and virtual address 0x0, and incorrectly draw the conclusion
    that a runtime region exists for which no virtual mapping was installed,
    and give up altogether. The consequence of this is that firmware mappings
    retain their read-write-execute permissions, making the system more
    vulnerable to attacks.
    
    So let's only bail if the virtual address of 0x0 has been assigned to a
    physical region that does not reside at address 0x0.

    sched/debug: Initialize sd_sysctl_cpus if !CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK
    
    [ Upstream commit 1ca4fa3ab604734e38e2a3000c9abf788512ffa7 ]
    
    register_sched_domain_sysctl() copies the cpu_possible_mask into
    sd_sysctl_cpus, but only if sd_sysctl_cpus hasn't already been
    allocated (ie, CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is set).  However, when
    CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is not set, sd_sysctl_cpus is left
    uninitialized (all zeroes) and the kernel may fail to initialize
    sched_domain sysctl entries for all possible CPUs.
    
    This is visible to the user if the kernel is booted with maxcpus=n, or
    if ACPI tables have been modified to leave CPUs offline, and then
    checking for missing /proc/sys/kernel/sched_domain/cpu* entries.
    
    Fix this by separating the allocation and initialization, and adding a
    flag to initialize the possible CPU entries while system booting only.

    platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Fix PCH IP sts reading
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e68eeea9894feeba2edf7ec63e4551b87f39621 ]
    
    A previous commit "platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Make the driver PCH
    family agnostic <c977b98bbef5898ed3d30b08ea67622e9e82082a>" provided
    better abstraction to this driver but has some fundamental issues.
    
    e.g. the following condition
    
    for (index = 0; index < pmcdev->map->ppfear_buckets &&
            index < PPFEAR_MAX_NUM_ENTRIES; index++, iter++)
    
    is wrong because for CNL, PPFEAR_MAX_NUM_ENTRIES is hardcoded as 5 which
    is _wrong_ and even though ppfear_buckets is 8, the loop fails to read
    all eight registers needed for CNL PCH i.e. PPFEAR0 and PPFEAR1. This

    e1000e: fix cyclic resets at link up with active tx
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f9e980bf5ee1a97e2e401c846b2af989eb21c61 ]
    
    I'm seeing series of e1000e resets (sometimes endless) at system boot
    if something generates tx traffic at this time. In my case this is
    netconsole who sends message "e1000e 0000:02:00.0: Some CPU C-states
    have been disabled in order to enable jumbo frames" from e1000e itself.
    As result e1000_watchdog_task sees used tx buffer while carrier is off
    and start this reset cycle again.

    The only sensible explanation is that cdrom_sysctl_register() is called
    twice, once from the module init function and once from register_cdrom().
    cdrom_sysctl_register() is not mutex protected and may happily execute
    twice if the second call is made before the first call is complete.
    
    Use a static atomic to ensure that the function is executed exactly once.

    iw_cxgb4: fix srqidx leak during connection abort
    
    [ Upstream commit f368ff188ae4b3ef6f740a15999ea0373261b619 ]
    
    When an application aborts the connection by moving QP from RTS to ERROR,
    then iw_cxgb4's modify_rc_qp() RTS->ERROR logic sets the
    *srqidxp to 0 via t4_set_wq_in_error(&qhp->wq, 0), and aborts the
    connection by calling c4iw_ep_disconnect().
    
    c4iw_ep_disconnect() does the following:
     1. sends up a close_complete_upcall(ep, -ECONNRESET) to libcxgb4.
     2. sends abort request CPL to hw.
    
    But, since the close_complete_upcall() is sent before sending the
    ABORT_REQ to hw, libcxgb4 would fail to release the srqidx if the
    connection holds one. Because, the srqidx is passed up to libcxgb4 only
    after corresponding ABORT_RPL is processed by kernel in abort_rpl().
    
    This patch handle the corner-case by moving the call to
    close_complete_upcall() from c4iw_ep_disconnect() to abort_rpl().  So that
    libcxgb4 is notified about the -ECONNRESET only after abort_rpl(), and
    libcxgb4 can relinquish the srqidx properly.

    genirq: Avoid summation loops for /proc/stat
    
    [ Upstream commit 1136b0728969901a091f0471968b2b76ed14d9ad ]
    
    Waiman reported that on large systems with a large amount of interrupts the
    readout of /proc/stat takes a long time to sum up the interrupt
    statistics. In principle this is not a problem. but for unknown reasons
    some enterprise quality software reads /proc/stat with a high frequency.
    
    The reason for this is that interrupt statistics are accounted per cpu. So
    the /proc/stat logic has to sum up the interrupt stats for each interrupt.
    
    This can be largely avoided for interrupts which are not marked as
    'PER_CPU' interrupts by simply adding a per interrupt summation counter
    which is incremented along with the per interrupt per cpu counter.
    
    The PER_CPU interrupts need to avoid that and use only per cpu accounting
    because they share the interrupt number and the interrupt descriptor and
    concurrent updates would conflict or require unwanted synchronization.

    bcache: improve sysfs_strtoul_clamp()
    
    [ Upstream commit 596b5a5dd1bc2fa019fdaaae522ef331deef927f ]
    
    Currently sysfs_strtoul_clamp() is defined as,
     82 #define sysfs_strtoul_clamp(file, var, min, max)                   \
     83 do {                                                               \
     84         if (attr == &sysfs_ ## file)                               \
     85                 return strtoul_safe_clamp(buf, var, min, max)      \
     86                         ?: (ssize_t) size;                         \
     87 } while (0)
    
    The problem is, if bit width of var is less then unsigned long, min and
    max may not protect var from integer overflow, because overflow happens
    in strtoul_safe_clamp() before checking min and max.
    
    To fix such overflow in sysfs_strtoul_clamp(), to make min and max take
    effect, this patch adds an unsigned long variable, and uses it to macro
    strtoul_safe_clamp() to convert an unsigned long value in range defined
    by [min, max]. Then assign this value to var. By this method, if bit
    width of var is less than unsigned long, integer overflow won't happen
    before min and max are checking.
    
    Now sysfs_strtoul_clamp() can properly handle smaller data type like
    unsigned int, of cause min and max should be defined in range of
    unsigned int too.

    bcache: fix input overflow to sequential_cutoff
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c27a3953e92eb0b22dbb03d599f543a05f9574e ]
    
    People may set sequential_cutoff of a cached device via sysfs file,
    but current code does not check input value overflow. E.g. if value
    4294967295 (UINT_MAX) is written to file sequential_cutoff, its value
    is 4GB, but if 4294967296 (UINT_MAX + 1) is written into, its value
    will be 0. This is an unexpected behavior.
    
    This patch replaces d_strtoi_h() by sysfs_strtoul_clamp() to convert
    input string to unsigned integer value, and limit its range in
    [0, UINT_MAX]. Then the input overflow can be fixed.

    bcache: fix input overflow to cache set sysfs file io_error_halflife
    
    [ Upstream commit a91fbda49f746119828f7e8ad0f0aa2ab0578f65 ]
    
    Cache set sysfs entry io_error_halflife is used to set c->error_decay.
    c->error_decay is in type unsigned int, and it is converted by
    strtoul_or_return(), therefore overflow to c->error_decay is possible
    for a large input value.
    
    This patch fixes the overflow by using strtoul_safe_clamp() to convert
    input string to an unsigned long value in range [0, UINT_MAX], then
    divides by 88 and set it to c->error_decay.

    The percpu members of struct sd_data and s_data are declared as:
    
            struct ... ** __percpu member;
    
    So their type is:
    
            __percpu pointer to pointer to struct ...
    
    But looking at how they're used, their type should be:
    
            pointer to __percpu pointer to struct ...
    
    and they should thus be declared as:
    
            struct ... * __percpu *member;
    
    So fix the placement of '__percpu' in the definition of these
    structures.
    
    This addresses a bunch of Sparse's warnings like:
    
            warning: incorrect type in initializer (different address spaces)
              expected void const [noderef] <asn:3> *__vpp_verify
              got struct sched_domain **

    usb: f_fs: Avoid crash due to out-of-scope stack ptr access
    
    [ Upstream commit 54f64d5c983f939901dacc8cfc0983727c5c742e ]
    
    Since the 5.0 merge window opened, I've been seeing frequent
    crashes on suspend and reboot with the trace:

    I isolated this down to in ffs_epfile_io():
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_fs.c#n1065
    
    Where the completion done is setup on the stack:
      DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(done);
    
    Then later we setup a request and queue it, and wait for it:
      if (unlikely(wait_for_completion_interruptible(&done))) {
        /*
        * To avoid race condition with ffs_epfile_io_complete,
        * dequeue the request first then check
        * status. usb_ep_dequeue API should guarantee no race
        * condition with req->complete callback.
        */
        usb_ep_dequeue(ep->ep, req);
        interrupted = ep->status < 0;
      }
    
    The problem is, that we end up being interrupted, dequeue the
    request, and exit.
    
    But then the irq triggers and we try calling complete() on the
    context pointer which points to now random stack space, which
    results in the panic.
    
    Alan Stern pointed out there is a bug here, in that the snippet
    above "assumes that usb_ep_dequeue() waits until the request has
    been completed." And that:
    
        wait_for_completion(&done);
    
    Is needed right after the usb_ep_dequeue().
    
    Thus this patch implements that change. With it I no longer see
    the crashes on suspend or reboot.
    
    This issue seems to have been uncovered by behavioral changes in
    the dwc3 driver in commit fec9095bdef4e ("usb: dwc3: gadget:
    remove wait_end_transfer").

    ALSA: PCM: check if ops are defined before suspending PCM
    
    [ Upstream commit d9c0b2afe820fa3b3f8258a659daee2cc71ca3ef ]
    
    BE dai links only have internal PCM's and their substream ops may
    not be set. Suspending these PCM's will result in their
     ops->trigger() being invoked and cause a kernel oops.
    So skip suspending PCM's if their ops are NULL.
    
    [ NOTE: this change is required now for following the recent PCM core
      change to get rid of snd_pcm_suspend() call.  Since DPCM BE takes
      the runtime carried from FE while keeping NULL ops, it can hit this
      bug.  See details at:

    ARM: 8833/1: Ensure that NEON code always compiles with Clang
    
    [ Upstream commit de9c0d49d85dc563549972edc5589d195cd5e859 ]
    
    While building arm32 allyesconfig, I ran into the following errors:
    
      arch/arm/lib/xor-neon.c:17:2: error: You should compile this file with
      '-mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=neon'
    
      In file included from lib/raid6/neon1.c:27:
      /home/nathan/cbl/prebuilt/lib/clang/8.0.0/include/arm_neon.h:28:2:
      error: "NEON support not enabled"
    
    Building V=1 showed NEON_FLAGS getting passed along to Clang but
    __ARM_NEON__ was not getting defined. Ultimately, it boils down to Clang
    only defining __ARM_NEON__ when targeting armv7, rather than armv6k,
    which is the '-march' value for allyesconfig.
    
    >From lib/Basic/Targets/ARM.cpp in the Clang source:
    
      // This only gets set when Neon instructions are actually available, unlike
      // the VFP define, hence the soft float and arch check. This is subtly
      // different from gcc, we follow the intent which was that it should be set
      // when Neon instructions are actually available.
      if ((FPU & NeonFPU) && !SoftFloat && ArchVersion >= 7) {
        Builder.defineMacro("__ARM_NEON", "1");
        Builder.defineMacro("__ARM_NEON__");
        // current AArch32 NEON implementations do not support double-precision
        // floating-point even when it is present in VFP.
        Builder.defineMacro("__ARM_NEON_FP",
                            "0x" + Twine::utohexstr(HW_FP & ~HW_FP_DP));
      }
    
    Ard Biesheuvel recommended explicitly adding '-march=armv7-a' at the
    beginning of the NEON_FLAGS definitions so that __ARM_NEON__ always gets
    definined by Clang. This doesn't functionally change anything because
    that code will only run where NEON is supported, which is implicitly
    armv7.

    netfilter: conntrack: fix cloned unconfirmed skb->_nfct race in __nf_conntrack_confirm
    
    [ Upstream commit 13f5251fd17088170c18844534682d9cab5ff5aa ]
    
    For bridge(br_flood) or broadcast/multicast packets, they could clone
    skb with unconfirmed conntrack which break the rule that unconfirmed
    skb->_nfct is never shared.  With nfqueue running on my system, the race
    can be easily reproduced with following warning calltrace:

    The original code just triggered the warning but do nothing. It will
    caused the shared conntrack moves to the dying list and the packet be

          // goto __nf_conntrack_confirm with softirq context on CPU 0
    
    Because conntrack confirm can happen at both INPUT and POSTROUTING
    stage.  So with NFQUEUE running, skb->_nfct with the same unconfirmed
    conntrack could race on different core.

    ACPI / video: Refactor and fix dmi_is_desktop()
    
    [ Upstream commit cecf3e3e0803462335e25d083345682518097334 ]
    
    This commit refactors the chassis-type detection introduced by
    commit 53fa1f6e8a59 ("ACPI / video: Only default only_lcd to true on
    Win8-ready _desktops_") (where desktop means anything without a builtin
    screen).
    
    The DMI chassis_type is an unsigned integer, so rather then doing a
    whole bunch of string-compares on it, convert it to an int and feed
    the result to a switch case.
    
    Note the switch case uses hex values, this is done because the spec
    uses hex values too. This changes the check for "Main Server Chassis"
    from checking for 11 decimal to 11 hexadecimal, this is a bug fix,
    the original check for 11 decimal was wrong.

    iwlwifi: pcie: fix emergency path
    
    [ Upstream commit c6ac9f9fb98851f47b978a9476594fc3c477a34d ]
    
    Allocator swaps the pending requests with 0 when it starts
    working. This means that relying on it n RX path to decide if
    to move to emergency is not always a good idea, since it may
    be zero, but there are still a lot of unallocated RBs in the

    leds: lp55xx: fix null deref on firmware load failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ddb0869bfc1bca6cfc592c74c64a026f936638c ]
    
    I've stumbled upon a kernel crash and the logs
    pointed me towards the lp5562 driver:
    
    > <4>[306013.841294] lp5562 0-0030: Direct firmware load for lp5562 failed with error -2

    After taking a look I noticed firmware_release()
    could be called with either NULL or a dangling
    pointer.

    jbd2: fix race when writing superblock
    
    [ Upstream commit 538bcaa6261b77e71d37f5596c33127c1a3ec3f7 ]
    
    The jbd2 superblock is lockless now, so there is probably a race
    condition between writing it so disk and modifing contents of it, which
    may lead to checksum error. The following race is the one case that we
    have captured.
    
    jbd2                                fsstress
    jbd2_journal_commit_transaction
     jbd2_journal_update_sb_log_tail
      jbd2_write_superblock
       jbd2_superblock_csum_set         jbd2_journal_revoke
                                         jbd2_journal_set_features(revork)
                                         modify superblock
       submit_bh(checksum incorrect)
    
    Fix this by locking the buffer head before modifing it.  We always
    write the jbd2 superblock after we modify it, so this just means
    calling the lock_buffer() a little earlier.
    
    This checksum corruption problem can be reproduced by xfstests
    generic/475.

    HID: intel-ish-hid: avoid binding wrong ishtp_cl_device
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d28f49412405d87d3aae83da255070a46e67627 ]
    
    When performing a warm reset in ishtp bus driver, the ishtp_cl_device
    will not be removed, its fw_client still points to the already freed
    ishtp_device.fw_clients array.
    
    Later after driver finishing ishtp client enumeration, this dangling
    pointer may cause driver to bind the wrong ishtp_cl_device to the new
    client, causing wrong callback to be called for messages intended for
    the new client.
    
    This helps in development of firmware where frequent switching of
    firmwares is required without Linux reboot.

    vfs: fix preadv64v2 and pwritev64v2 compat syscalls with offset == -1
    
    [ Upstream commit cc4b1242d7e3b42eed73881fc749944146493e4f ]
    
    The preadv2 and pwritev2 syscalls are supposed to emulate the readv and
    writev syscalls when offset == -1. Therefore the compat code should
    check for offset before calling do_compat_preadv64 and
    do_compat_pwritev64. This is the case for the preadv2 and pwritev2
    syscalls, but handling of offset == -1 is missing in their 64-bit
    equivalent.
    
    This patch fixes that, calling do_compat_readv and do_compat_writev when
    offset == -1. This fixes the following glibc tests on x32:
     - misc/tst-preadvwritev2
     - misc/tst-preadvwritev64v2

    perf test: Fix failure of 'evsel-tp-sched' test on s390
    
    [ Upstream commit 03d309711d687460d1345de8a0363f45b1c8cd11 ]
    
    Commit 489338a717a0 ("perf tests evsel-tp-sched: Fix bitwise operator")
    causes test case 14 "Parse sched tracepoints fields" to fail on s390.
    
    This test succeeds on x86.
    
    In fact this test now fails on all architectures with type char treated
    as type unsigned char.
    
    The root cause is the signed-ness of character arrays in the tracepoints
    sched_switch for structure members prev_comm and next_comm.
    
    On s390 the output of:
    
     [root@m35lp76 perf]# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/format
     name: sched_switch
     ID: 287
     format:
       field:unsigned short common_type; offset:0; size:2;  signed:0;
       ...
       field:char prev_comm[16]; offset:8; size:16; signed:0;
       ...
       field:char next_comm[16]; offset:40; size:16; signed:0;
    
    reveals the character arrays prev_comm and next_comm are per
    default unsigned char and have values in the range of 0..255.
    
    On x86 both fields are signed as this output shows:
     [root@f29]# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/format
     name: sched_switch
     ID: 287
     format:
       field:unsigned short common_type; offset:0; size:2;  signed:0;
       ...
       field:char prev_comm[16]; offset:8; size:16; signed:1;
       ...
       field:char next_comm[16]; offset:40; size:16; signed:1;
    
    and the character arrays prev_comm and next_comm are per default signed
    char and have values in the range of -1..127.  The implementation of
    type char is architecture specific.
    
    Since the character arrays in both tracepoints sched_switch and
    sched_wakeup should contain ascii characters, simply omit the check for
    signedness in the test case.
    
    Output before:
    
      [root@m35lp76 perf]# ./perf test -F 14
      14: Parse sched tracepoints fields                        :

    scsi: fcoe: make use of fip_mode enum complete
    
    [ Upstream commit 8beb90aaf334a6efa3e924339926b5f93a234dbb ]
    
    commit 1917d42d14b7 ("fcoe: use enum for fip_mode") introduces a separate
    enum for the fip_mode that shall be used during initialisation handling
    until it is passed to fcoe_ctrl_link_up to set the initial fip_state.  That
    change was incomplete and gcc quietly converted in various places between
    the fip_mode and the fip_state enum values with implicit enum conversions,
    which fortunately cannot cause any issues in the actual code's execution.
    
    clang however warns about these implicit enum conversions in the scsi
    drivers. This commit consolidates the use of the two enums, guided by
    clang's enum-conversion warnings.
    
    This commit now completes the use of the fip_mode: It expects and uses
    fip_mode in {bnx2fc,fcoe}_interface_create and fcoe_ctlr_init, and it calls
    fcoe_ctrl_set_set() with the correct values in fcoe_ctlr_link_up().  It
    also breaks the association between FIP_MODE_AUTO and FIP_ST_AUTO to
    indicate these two enums are distinct.

    efi: cper: Fix possible out-of-bounds access
    
    [ Upstream commit 45b14a4ffcc1e0b5caa246638f942cbe7eaea7ad ]
    
    When checking a generic status block, we iterate over all the generic
    data blocks. The loop condition only checks that the start of the
    generic data block is valid (within estatus->data_length) but not the
    whole block. Because the size of data blocks (excluding error data) may
    vary depending on the revision and the revision is contained within the
    data block, ensure that enough of the current data block is valid before
    dereferencing any members otherwise an out-of-bounds access may occur if
    estatus->data_length is invalid.
    
    This relies on the fact that struct acpi_hest_generic_data_v300 is a
    superset of the earlier version.  Also rework the other checks to avoid
    potential underflow.

    There is some rare cases where CPB (and possibly IDA) are missing on
    processors.
    
    This is the case fixed by commit f7f3dc00f612 ("x86/cpu/AMD: Fix
    erratum 1076 (CPB bit)") and following.
    
    In such context, the boost status isn't reported by
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost.
    
    This commit is about printing a message to report that the CPU
    doesn't expose the boost capabilities.
    
    This message could help debugging platforms hit by this phenomena.

    clk: fractional-divider: check parent rate only if flag is set
    
    [ Upstream commit d13501a2bedfbea0983cc868d3f1dc692627f60d ]
    
    Custom approximation of fractional-divider may not need parent clock
    rate checking. For example Rockchip SoCs work fine using grand parent
    clock rate even if target rate is greater than parent.
    
    This patch checks parent clock rate only if CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag
    is set.
    
    For detailed example, clock tree of Rockchip I2S audio hardware.
      - Clock rate of CPLL is 1.2GHz, GPLL is 491.52MHz.
      - i2s1_div is integer divider can divide N (N is 1~128).
        Input clock is CPLL or GPLL. Initial divider value is N = 1.
        Ex) PLL = CPLL, N = 10, i2s1_div output rate is
          CPLL / 10 = 1.2GHz / 10 = 120MHz
      - i2s1_frac is fractional divider can divide input to x/y, x and
        y are 16bit integer.
    
    CPLL --> | selector | ---> i2s1_div -+--> | selector | --> I2S1 MCLK
    GPLL --> |          | ,--------------'    |          |
                          `--> i2s1_frac ---> |          |
    
    Clock mux system try to choose suitable one from i2s1_div and
    i2s1_frac for master clock (MCLK) of I2S1.
    
    Bad scenario as follows:
      - Try to set MCLK to 8.192MHz (32kHz audio replay)
        Candidate setting is
        - i2s1_div: GPLL / 60 = 8.192MHz
        i2s1_div candidate is exactly same as target clock rate, so mux
        choose this clock source. i2s1_div output rate is changed
        491.52MHz -> 8.192MHz
    
      - After that try to set to 11.2896MHz (44.1kHz audio replay)
        Candidate settings are
        - i2s1_div : CPLL / 107 = 11.214945MHz
        - i2s1_frac: i2s1_div   = 8.192MHz
          This is because clk_fd_round_rate() thinks target rate
          (11.2896MHz) is higher than parent rate (i2s1_div = 8.192MHz)
          and returns parent clock rate.
    
    Above is current upstreamed behavior. Clock mux system choose
    i2s1_div, but this clock rate is not acceptable for I2S driver, so
    users cannot replay audio.
    
    Expected behavior is:
      - Try to set master clock to 11.2896MHz (44.1kHz audio replay)
        Candidate settings are
        - i2s1_div : CPLL / 107          = 11.214945MHz
        - i2s1_frac: i2s1_div * 147/6400 = 11.2896MHz
                     Change i2s1_div to GPLL / 1 = 491.52MHz at same
                     time.
    
    If apply this commit, clk_fd_round_rate() calls custom approximate
    function of Rockchip even if target rate is higher than parent.
    Custom function changes both grand parent (i2s1_div) and parent
    (i2s_frac) settings at same time. Clock mux system can choose
    i2s1_frac and audio works fine.

    IB/mlx4: Increase the timeout for CM cache
    
    [ Upstream commit 2612d723aadcf8281f9bf8305657129bd9f3cd57 ]
    
    Using CX-3 virtual functions, either from a bare-metal machine or
    pass-through from a VM, MAD packets are proxied through the PF driver.
    
    Since the VF drivers have separate name spaces for MAD Transaction Ids
    (TIDs), the PF driver has to re-map the TIDs and keep the book keeping
    in a cache.
    
    Following the RDMA Connection Manager (CM) protocol, it is clear when
    an entry has to evicted form the cache. But life is not perfect,
    remote peers may die or be rebooted. Hence, it's a timeout to wipe out
    a cache entry, when the PF driver assumes the remote peer has gone.
    
    During workloads where a high number of QPs are destroyed concurrently,
    excessive amount of CM DREQ retries has been observed
    
    The problem can be demonstrated in a bare-metal environment, where two
    nodes have instantiated 8 VFs each. This using dual ported HCAs, so we
    have 16 vPorts per physical server.
    
    64 processes are associated with each vPort and creates and destroys
    one QP for each of the remote 64 processes. That is, 1024 QPs per
    vPort, all in all 16K QPs. The QPs are created/destroyed using the
    CM.
    
    When tearing down these 16K QPs, excessive CM DREQ retries (and
    duplicates) are observed. With some cat/paste/awk wizardry on the
    infiniband_cm sysfs, we observe as sum of the 16 vPorts on one of the
    nodes:
    
    cm_rx_duplicates:
          dreq  2102
    cm_rx_msgs:
          drep  1989
          dreq  6195
           rep  3968
           req  4224
           rtu  4224
    cm_tx_msgs:
          drep  4093
          dreq 27568
           rep  4224
           req  3968
           rtu  3968
    cm_tx_retries:
          dreq 23469
    
    Note that the active/passive side is equally distributed between the
    two nodes.
    
    Enabling pr_debug in cm.c gives tons of:
    
    [171778.814239] <mlx4_ib> mlx4_ib_multiplex_cm_handler: id{slave:
    1,sl_cm_id: 0xd393089f} is NULL!
    
    By increasing the CM_CLEANUP_CACHE_TIMEOUT from 5 to 30 seconds, the
    tear-down phase of the application is reduced from approximately 90 to
    50 seconds. Retries/duplicates are also significantly reduced:
    
    cm_rx_duplicates:
          dreq  2460
    []
    cm_tx_retries:
          dreq  3010
           req    47
    
    Increasing the timeout further didn't help, as these duplicates and
    retries stems from a too short CMA timeout, which was 20 (~4 seconds)
    on the systems. By increasing the CMA timeout to 22 (~17 seconds), the
    numbers fell down to about 10 for both of them.
    
    Adjustment of the CMA timeout is not part of this commit.

    mmc: omap: fix the maximum timeout setting
    
    [ Upstream commit a6327b5e57fdc679c842588c3be046c0b39cc127 ]
    
    When running OMAP1 kernel on QEMU, MMC access is annoyingly noisy:
    
            MMC: CTO of 0xff and 0xfe cannot be used!
            MMC: CTO of 0xff and 0xfe cannot be used!
            MMC: CTO of 0xff and 0xfe cannot be used!
            [ad inf.]
    
    Emulator warnings appear to be valid. The TI document SPRU680 [1]
    ("OMAP5910 Dual-Core Processor MultiMedia Card/Secure Data Memory Card
    (MMC/SD) Reference Guide") page 36 states that the maximum timeout is 253
    cycles and "0xff and 0xfe cannot be used".
    
    Fix by using 0xfd as the maximum timeout.
    
    Tested using QEMU 2.5 (Siemens SX1 machine, OMAP310), and also checked on
    real hardware using Palm TE (OMAP310), Nokia 770 (OMAP1710) and Nokia N810
    (OMAP2420) that MMC works as before.

    This fixes selftest va_128TBswitch --run-hugetlb reporting failures when
    run as non root user for
    
    mmap(-1, MAP_HUGETLB)
    
    The bug is that a non-root user requesting address -1 will be given address 0
    which will then fail, whereas they should have been given something else that
    would have succeeded.
    
    We also avoid the first mmap(-1, MAP_HUGETLB) returning NULL address as mmap address
    with this change. So we think this is not a security issue, because it only affects
    whether we choose an address below mmap_min_addr, not whether we
    actually allow that address to be mapped. ie. there are existing capability
    checks to prevent a user mapping below mmap_min_addr and those will still be
    honoured even without this fix.

    coresight: etm4x: Add support to enable ETMv4.2
    
    [ Upstream commit 5666dfd1d8a45a167f0d8b4ef47ea7f780b1f24a ]
    
    SDM845 has ETMv4.2 and can use the existing etm4x driver.
    But the current etm driver checks only for ETMv4.0 and
    errors out for other etm4x versions. This patch adds this
    missing support to enable SoC's with ETMv4x to use same
    driver by checking only the ETM architecture major version
    number.
    
    Without this change, we get below error during etm probe:

    [ Upstream commit e7140639b1de65bba435a6bd772d134901141f86 ]
    
    When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:
    
      arch/powerpc/xmon/ppc-dis.c:157:7: warning: variable 'opcode' is used
      uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false

      1 warning generated.
    
    This warning seems to make no sense on the surface because opcode is set
    to NULL right below this statement. However, there is a comma instead of
    semicolon to end the dialect assignment, meaning that the opcode
    assignment only happens in the if statement. Properly terminate that
    line so that Clang no longer warns.

    [ 5526.588562] scsi_alloc_sdev: Allocation failure during SCSI scanning, some SCSI devices might not be configured
    
    Looking at the code of scsi_alloc_sdev(), and all the calling contexts,
    there seems to be no reason to use GFP_ATMOIC here. All the different
    call-contexts use a mutex at some point, and nothing in between that
    requires no sleeping, as far as I could see. Additionally, the code that
    later allocates the block queue for the device (scsi_mq_alloc_queue())
    already uses GFP_KERNEL.
    
    There are similar allocations in two other functions:
    scsi_probe_and_add_lun(), and scsi_add_lun(),; that can also be done with
    GFP_KERNEL.
    
    Here is the contexts for the three functions so far:
    
        scsi_alloc_sdev()
            scsi_probe_and_add_lun()
                scsi_sequential_lun_scan()
                    __scsi_scan_target()
                        scsi_scan_target()
                            mutex_lock()
                        scsi_scan_channel()
                            scsi_scan_host_selected()
                                mutex_lock()
                scsi_report_lun_scan()
                    __scsi_scan_target()
                        ...
                __scsi_add_device()
                    mutex_lock()
                __scsi_scan_target()
                    ...
            scsi_report_lun_scan()
                ...
            scsi_get_host_dev()
                mutex_lock()
    
        scsi_probe_and_add_lun()
            ...
    
        scsi_add_lun()
            scsi_probe_and_add_lun()
                ...
    
    So replace all these, and give them a bit of a better chance to succeed,
    with more chances of reclaim.

    usb: chipidea: Grab the (legacy) USB PHY by phandle first
    
    [ Upstream commit 68ef236274793066b9ba3154b16c0acc1c891e5c ]
    
    According to the chipidea driver bindings, the USB PHY is specified via
    the "phys" phandle node. However, this only takes effect for USB PHYs
    that use the common PHY framework. For legacy USB PHYs, a simple lookup
    based on the USB PHY type is done instead.
    
    This does not play out well when more than one USB PHY is registered,
    since the first registered PHY matching the type will always be
    returned regardless of what the driver was bound to.
    
    Fix this by looking up the PHY based on the "phys" phandle node.
    Although generic PHYs are rather matched by their "phys-name" and not
    the "phys" phandle directly, there is no helper for similar lookup on
    legacy PHYs and it's probably not worth the effort to add it.
    
    When no legacy USB PHY is found by phandle, fallback to grabbing any
    registered USB2 PHY. This ensures backward compatibility if some users
    were actually relying on this mechanism.

    crypto: cavium/zip - fix collision with generic cra_driver_name
    
    [ Upstream commit 41798036430015ad45137db2d4c213cd77fd0251 ]
    
    The cavium/zip implementation of the deflate compression algorithm is
    incorrectly being registered under the generic driver name, which
    prevents the generic implementation from being registered with the
    crypto API when CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_CAVIUM_ZIP=y.  Similarly the lzs
    algorithm (which does not currently have a generic implementation...)
    is incorrectly being registered as lzs-generic.
    
    Fix the naming collision by adding a suffix "-cavium" to the
    cra_driver_name of the cavium/zip algorithms.

    PCI/PME: Fix hotplug/sysfs remove deadlock in pcie_pme_remove()
    
    [ Upstream commit 95c80bc6952b6a5badc7b702d23e5bf14d251e7c ]
    
    Dongdong reported a deadlock triggered by a hotplug event during a sysfs
    "remove" operation:
    
      pciehp 0000:00:0c.0:pcie004: Slot(0-1): Link Up
      # echo 1 > 0000:00:0c.0/remove
    
      PME and hotplug share an MSI/MSI-X vector.  The sysfs "remove" side is:
    
        remove_store
           pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device_locked
             pci_lock_rescan_remove
             pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device
               ...
               pcie_pme_remove
                 pcie_pme_suspend
                   synchronize_irq        # wait for hotplug IRQ handler
             pci_unlock_rescan_remove
    
      The hotplug side is:
    
        pciehp_ist
           pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change
             pciehp_configure_device

    It is incorrect to call pcie_pme_suspend() from pcie_pme_remove() for two
    reasons.
    
    First, pcie_pme_suspend() calls synchronize_irq(), which will wait for the
    native hotplug interrupt handler as well as for the PME one, because they
    share one IRQ (as per the spec).  That may deadlock if hotplug is signaled
    while pcie_pme_remove() is running and the latter calls
    pci_lock_rescan_remove() before the former.
    
    Second, if pcie_pme_suspend() figures out that wakeup needs to be enabled
    for the port, it will return without disabling the interrupt as expected by
    pcie_pme_remove() which was overlooked by commit c7b5a4e6e8fb ("PCI / PM:
    Fix native PME handling during system suspend/resume").
    
    To fix that, rework pcie_pme_remove() to disable the PME interrupt, clear
    its status and prevent the PME worker function from re-enabling it before
    calling free_irq() on it, which should be sufficient.

    Fix buffer overflow observed when running perf test.
    
    The overflow is when trying to evaluate "1ULL << (64 - 1)" which is
    resulting in -9223372036854775808 which overflows the 20 character
    buffer.
    
    If is possible this bug has been reported before but I still don't see
    any fix checked in:

    fs: fix guard_bio_eod to check for real EOD errors
    
    [ Upstream commit dce30ca9e3b676fb288c33c1f4725a0621361185 ]
    
    guard_bio_eod() can truncate a segment in bio to allow it to do IO on
    odd last sectors of a device.
    
    It already checks if the IO starts past EOD, but it does not consider
    the possibility of an IO request starting within device boundaries can
    contain more than one segment past EOD.
    
    In such cases, truncated_bytes can be bigger than PAGE_SIZE, and will
    underflow bvec->bv_len.
    
    Fix this by checking if truncated_bytes is lower than PAGE_SIZE.
    
    This situation has been found on filesystems such as isofs and vfat,
    which doesn't check the device size before mount, if the device is
    smaller than the filesystem itself, a readahead on such filesystem,
    which spans EOD, can trigger this situation, leading a call to
    zero_user() with a wrong size possibly corrupting memory.
    
    I didn't see any crash, or didn't let the system run long enough to
    check if memory corruption will be hit somewhere, but adding
    instrumentation to guard_bio_end() to check truncated_bytes size, was
    enough to see the error.
    
    The following script can trigger the error.
    
    MNT=/mnt
    IMG=./DISK.img
    DEV=/dev/loop0
    
    mkfs.vfat $IMG
    mount $IMG $MNT
    cp -R /etc $MNT &> /dev/null
    umount $MNT
    
    losetup -D
    
    losetup --find --show --sizelimit 16247280 $IMG
    mount $DEV $MNT
    
    find $MNT -type f -exec cat {} + >/dev/null

    dm thin: add sanity checks to thin-pool and external snapshot creation
    
    [ Upstream commit 70de2cbda8a5d788284469e755f8b097d339c240 ]
    
    Invoking dm_get_device() twice on the same device path with different
    modes is dangerous.  Because in that case, upgrade_mode() will alloc a
    new 'dm_dev' and free the old one, which may be referenced by a previous
    caller.  Dereferencing the dangling pointer will trigger kernel NULL
    pointer dereference.
    
    The following two cases can reproduce this issue.  Actually, they are
    invalid setups that must be disallowed, e.g.:
    
    1. Creating a thin-pool with read_only mode, and the same device as
    both metadata and data.
    
    dmsetup create thinp --table \
        "0 41943040 thin-pool /dev/vdb /dev/vdb 128 0 1 read_only"

    fs/file.c: initialize init_files.resize_wait
    
    [ Upstream commit 5704a06810682683355624923547b41540e2801a ]
    
    (Taken from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200647)
    
    'get_unused_fd_flags' in kthread cause kernel crash.  It works fine on
    4.1, but causes crash after get 64 fds.  It also cause crash on
    ubuntu1404/1604/1804, centos7.5, and the crash messages are almost the
    same.
    
    The crash message on centos7.5 shows below:
    
      start fd 61
      start fd 62
      start fd 63

    ocfs2: fix a panic problem caused by o2cb_ctl
    
    [ Upstream commit cc725ef3cb202ef2019a3c67c8913efa05c3cce6 ]
    
    In the process of creating a node, it will cause NULL pointer
    dereference in kernel if o2cb_ctl failed in the interval (mkdir,
    o2cb_set_node_attribute(node_num)] in function o2cb_add_node.
    
    The node num is initialized to 0 in function o2nm_node_group_make_item,
    o2nm_node_group_drop_item will mistake the node number 0 for a valid
    node number when we delete the node before the node number is set
    correctly.  If the local node number of the current host happens to be
    0, cluster->cl_local_node will be set to O2NM_INVALID_NODE_NUM while
    o2hb_thread still running.  The panic stack is generated as follows:
    
      o2hb_thread
          \-o2hb_do_disk_heartbeat
              \-o2hb_check_own_slot
                  |-slot = &reg->hr_slots[o2nm_this_node()];
                  //o2nm_this_node() return O2NM_INVALID_NODE_NUM
    
    We need to check whether the node number is set when we delete the node.

    mm/slab.c: kmemleak no scan alien caches
    
    [ Upstream commit 92d1d07daad65c300c7d0b68bbef8867e9895d54 ]
    
    Kmemleak throws endless warnings during boot due to in
    __alloc_alien_cache(),
    
        alc = kmalloc_node(memsize, gfp, node);
        init_arraycache(&alc->ac, entries, batch);
        kmemleak_no_scan(ac);
    
    Kmemleak does not track the array cache (alc->ac) but the alien cache
    (alc) instead, so let it track the latter by lifting kmemleak_no_scan()
    out of init_arraycache().
    
    There is another place that calls init_arraycache(), but
    alloc_kmem_cache_cpus() uses the percpu allocation where will never be
    considered as a leak.

    As it's difficult to report where exactly the uninit value resides in
    the mempolicy object, we have to guess a bit.  mm/mempolicy.c:353
    contains this part of mpol_rebind_policy():
    
            if (!mpol_store_user_nodemask(pol) &&
                nodes_equal(pol->w.cpuset_mems_allowed, *newmask))
    
    "mpol_store_user_nodemask(pol)" is testing pol->flags, which I couldn't
    ever see being uninitialized after leaving mpol_new().  So I'll guess
    it's actually about accessing pol->w.cpuset_mems_allowed on line 354,
    but still part of statement starting on line 353.
    
    For w.cpuset_mems_allowed to be not initialized, and the nodes_equal()
    reachable for a mempolicy where mpol_set_nodemask() is called in
    do_mbind(), it seems the only possibility is a MPOL_PREFERRED policy
    with empty set of nodes, i.e.  MPOL_LOCAL equivalent, with MPOL_F_LOCAL
    flag.  Let's exclude such policies from the nodes_equal() check.  Note
    the uninit access should be benign anyway, as rebinding this kind of
    policy is always a no-op.  Therefore no actual need for stable
    inclusion.

    mm/page_ext.c: fix an imbalance with kmemleak
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c81585499601acd1d0e1cbf424cabfaee60628c ]
    
    After offlining a memory block, kmemleak scan will trigger a crash, as
    it encounters a page ext address that has already been freed during
    memory offlining.  At the beginning in alloc_page_ext(), it calls
    kmemleak_alloc(), but it does not call kmemleak_free() in
    free_page_ext().

    mm/cma.c: cma_declare_contiguous: correct err handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d3bd18a5efd66097ef58622b898d3139790aa9d ]
    
    In case cma_init_reserved_mem failed, need to free the memblock
    allocated by memblock_reserve or memblock_alloc_range.
    
    Quote Catalin's comments:
      https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/26/482
    
    Kmemleak is supposed to work with the memblock_{alloc,free} pair and it
    ignores the memblock_reserve() as a memblock_alloc() implementation
    detail. It is, however, tolerant to memblock_free() being called on
    a sub-range or just a different range from a previous memblock_alloc().
    So the original patch looks fine to me. FWIW:

    iio: adc: fix warning in Qualcomm PM8xxx HK/XOADC driver
    
    [ Upstream commit e0f0ae838a25464179d37f355d763f9ec139fc15 ]
    
    The pm8xxx_get_channel() implementation is unclear, and causes gcc to
    suddenly generate odd warnings.  The trigger for the warning (at least
    for me) was the entirely unrelated commit 79a4e91d1bb2 ("device.h: Add
    __cold to dev_<level> logging functions"), which apparently changes gcc
    code generation in the caller function enough to cause this:
    
      drivers/iio/adc/qcom-pm8xxx-xoadc.c: In function ‘pm8xxx_xoadc_probe’:
      drivers/iio/adc/qcom-pm8xxx-xoadc.c:633:8: warning: ‘ch’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
        ret = pm8xxx_read_channel_rsv(adc, ch, AMUX_RSV4,
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 &read_nomux_rsv4, true);
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      drivers/iio/adc/qcom-pm8xxx-xoadc.c:426:27: note: ‘ch’ was declared here
        struct pm8xxx_chan_info *ch;
                                 ^~
    
    because gcc for some reason then isn't able to see that the termination
    condition for the "for( )" loop in that function is also the condition
    for returning NULL.
    
    So it's not _actually_ uninitialized, but the function is admittedly
    just unnecessarily oddly written.
    
    Simplify and clarify the function, making gcc also see that it always
    returns a valid initialized value.

    scsi: hisi_sas: Set PHY linkrate when disconnected
    
    [ Upstream commit efdcad62e7b8a02fcccc5ccca57806dce1482ac8 ]
    
    When the PHY comes down, we currently do not set the negotiated linkrate:
    
    root@(none)$ pwd
    /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-0:0
    root@(none)$ more enable
    1
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    12.0 Gbit
    root@(none)$ echo 0 > enable
    root@(none)$ more negotiated_linkrate
    12.0 Gbit
    root@(none)$
    
    This patch fixes the driver code to set it properly when the PHY comes
    down.
    
    If the PHY had been enabled, then set unknown; otherwise, flag as disabled.
    
    The logical place to set the negotiated linkrate for this scenario is PHY
    down routine, which is called from the PHY down ISR.
    
    However, it is not possible to know if the PHY comes down due to PHY
    disable or loss of link, as sas_phy.enabled member is not set until after
    the transport disable routine is complete, which races with the PHY down
    ISR.
    
    As an imperfect solution, use sas_phy_data.enable as the flag to know if
    the PHY is down due to disable. It's imperfect, as sas_phy_data is internal
    to libsas.
    
    I can't see another way without adding a new field to hisi_sas_phy and
    managing it, or changing SCSI SAS transport.

    enic: fix build warning without CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK
    
    [ Upstream commit 43d281662fdb46750d49417559b71069f435298d ]
    
    The enic driver relies on the CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK feature to
    dynamically allocate a struct member, but this is normally intended for
    local variables.
    
    Building with clang, I get a warning for a few locations that check the
    address of the cpumask_var_t:
    
    drivers/net/ethernet/cisco/enic/enic_main.c:122:22: error: address of array 'enic->msix[i].affinity_mask' will always evaluate to 'true' [-Werror,-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
    
    As far as I can tell, the code is still correct, as the truth value of
    the pointer is what we need in this configuration. To get rid of
    the warning, use cpumask_available() instead of checking the
    pointer directly.

    sysctl: handle overflow for file-max
    
    [ Upstream commit 32a5ad9c22852e6bd9e74bdec5934ef9d1480bc5 ]
    
    Currently, when writing
    
      echo 18446744073709551616 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
    
    /proc/sys/fs/file-max will overflow and be set to 0.  That quickly
    crashes the system.
    
    This commit sets the max and min value for file-max.  The max value is
    set to long int.  Any higher value cannot currently be used as the
    percpu counters are long ints and not unsigned integers.
    
    Note that the file-max value is ultimately parsed via
    __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax().  This function does not report error when
    min or max are exceeded.  Which means if a value largen that long int is
    written userspace will not receive an error instead the old value will be
    kept.  There is an argument to be made that this should be changed and
    __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax() should return an error when a dedicated min
    or max value are exceeded.  However this has the potential to break
    userspace so let's defer this to an RFC patch.

    include/linux/relay.h: fix percpu annotation in struct rchan
    
    [ Upstream commit 62461ac2e5b6520b6d65fc6d7d7b4b8df4b848d8 ]
    
    The percpu member of this structure is declared as:
            struct ... ** __percpu member;
    So its type is:
            __percpu pointer to pointer to struct ...
    
    But looking at how it's used, its type should be:
            pointer to __percpu pointer to struct ...
    and it should thus be declared as:
            struct ... * __percpu *member;
    
    So fix the placement of '__percpu' in the definition of this
    structures.
    
    This silents a few Sparse's warnings like:
            warning: incorrect type in initializer (different address spaces)

    cleared if the interrupt status register is cleared while the interrupt
    is enabled. However, we are currently clearing it with the interrupt
    disabled for level-based interrupts.
    
    It is acknowledged that this observed behaviour conflicts with a
    statement in the TRM:
    
    CAUTION
      After servicing the interrupt, the status bit in the interrupt status
      register (GPIOi.GPIO_IRQSTATUS_0 or GPIOi.GPIO_IRQSTATUS_1) must be
      reset and the interrupt line released (by setting the corresponding
      bit of the interrupt status register to 1) before enabling an
      interrupt for the GPIO channel in the interrupt-enable register
      (GPIOi.GPIO_IRQSTATUS_SET_0 or GPIOi.GPIO_IRQSTATUS_SET_1) to prevent
      the occurrence of unexpected interrupts when enabling an interrupt
      for the GPIO channel.
    
    However, this does not appear to be a practical problem.
    
    Further, as reported by Grygorii Strashko <grygorii.strashko@ti.com>,
    the TI Android kernel tree has an earlier similar patch as "GPIO: OMAP:
    Fix the sequence to clear the IRQ status" saying:
    
     if the status is cleared after disabling the IRQ then sWAKEUP will not
     be cleared and gates the module transition
    
    When we unmask the level interrupt after the interrupt has been handled,
    enable the interrupt and only then clear the interrupt. If the interrupt
    is still pending, the hardware will re-assert the interrupt status.
    
    Should the caution note in the TRM prove to be a problem, we could
    use a clear-enable-clear sequence instead.

    tracing: kdb: Fix ftdump to not sleep
    
    [ Upstream commit 31b265b3baaf55f209229888b7ffea523ddab366 ]
    
    As reported back in 2016-11 [1], the "ftdump" kdb command triggers a
    BUG for "sleeping function called from invalid context".
    
    kdb's "ftdump" command wants to call ring_buffer_read_prepare() in
    atomic context.  A very simple solution for this is to add allocation
    flags to ring_buffer_read_prepare() so kdb can call it without
    triggering the allocation error.  This patch does that.
    
    Note that in the original email thread about this, it was suggested
    that perhaps the solution for kdb was to either preallocate the buffer
    ahead of time or create our own iterator.  I'm hoping that this
    alternative of adding allocation flags to ring_buffer_read_prepare()
    can be considered since it means I don't need to duplicate more of the
    core trace code into "trace_kdb.c" (for either creating my own
    iterator or re-preparing a ring allocator whose memory was already
    allocated).
    
    NOTE: another option for kdb is to actually figure out how to make it
    reuse the existing ftrace_dump() function and totally eliminate the
    duplication.  This sounds very appealing and actually works (the "sr
    z" command can be seen to properly dump the ftrace buffer).  The
    downside here is that ftrace_dump() fully consumes the trace buffer.
    Unless that is changed I'd rather not use it because it means "ftdump
    | grep xyz" won't be very useful to search the ftrace buffer since it
    will throw away the whole trace on the first grep.  A future patch to
    dump only the last few lines of the buffer will also be hard to
    implement.

    f2fs: fix to avoid deadlock in f2fs_read_inline_dir()

    sometimes, dead lock when make system call SYS_getdents64 with fsync() is

    1.  task 9785 held sbi->cp_rwsem and waiting lock_page()
    2.  task 10349 held mm_sem and waiting sbi->cp_rwsem
    3. task 9709 held lock_page() and waiting mm_sem
    
    so this is a dead lock scenario.

    Since f2fs_readdir is protected by inode.i_rwsem, there should not be
    any updates in inode page, we're safe to lookup dents in inode page
    without its lock held, so taking off the lock to improve concurrency
    of readdir and avoid potential deadlock.

    h8300: use cc-cross-prefix instead of hardcoding h8300-unknown-linux-
    
    [ Upstream commit fc2b47b55f17fd996f7a01975ce1c33c2f2513f6 ]
    
    It believe it is a bad idea to hardcode a specific compiler prefix
    that may or may not be installed on a user's system. It is annoying
    when testing features that should not require compilers at all.
    
    For example, mrproper, headers_install, etc. should work without
    any compiler.
    
    They look like follows on my machine.
    
    $ make ARCH=h8300 mrproper
    ./scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 26: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: command not found
    ./scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 27: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: command not found
    make: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: Command not found
    make: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: Command not found
      [ a bunch of the same error messages continue ]
    
    $ make ARCH=h8300 headers_install
    ./scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 26: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: command not found
    ./scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 27: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: command not found
    make: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: Command not found

    make: h8300-unknown-linux-gcc: Command not found
      WRAP    arch/h8300/include/generated/uapi/asm/kvm_para.h
      [ snip ]
    
    The solution is to delete this line, or to use cc-cross-prefix like
    some architectures do. I chose the latter as a moderate fixup.
    
    I added an alternative 'h8300-linux-' because it is available at:

    When Linux closes a FD (close(), close-on-exec, dup2(), ...) it calls
    filp_close() which also removes all posix locks.
    
    The lock struct is initialized like so in filp_close() and passed
    down to cifs
    
            ...
            lock.fl_type = F_UNLCK;
            lock.fl_flags = FL_POSIX | FL_CLOSE;
            lock.fl_start = 0;
            lock.fl_end = OFFSET_MAX;
            ...
    
    Note the FL_CLOSE flag, which hints the VFS code that this unlocking
    is done for closing the fd.
    
    filp_close()
      locks_remove_posix(filp, id);
        vfs_lock_file(filp, F_SETLK, &lock, NULL);
          return filp->f_op->lock(filp, cmd, fl) => cifs_lock()
            rc = cifs_setlk(file, flock, type, wait_flag, posix_lck, lock, unlock, xid);
              rc = server->ops->mand_unlock_range(cfile, flock, xid);
              if (flock->fl_flags & FL_POSIX && !rc)
                      rc = locks_lock_file_wait(file, flock)
    
    Notice how we don't call locks_lock_file_wait() which does the
    generic VFS lock/unlock/wait work on the inode if rc != 0.
    
    If we are closing the handle, the SMB server is supposed to remove any
    locks associated with it. Similarly, cifs.ko frees and wakes up any
    lock and lock waiter when closing the file:
    
    cifs_close()
      cifsFileInfo_put(file->private_data)
            /*
             * Delete any outstanding lock records. We'll lose them when the file
             * is closed anyway.
             */
            down_write(&cifsi->lock_sem);
            list_for_each_entry_safe(li, tmp, &cifs_file->llist->locks, llist) {
                    list_del(&li->llist);
                    cifs_del_lock_waiters(li);
                    kfree(li);
            }
            list_del(&cifs_file->llist->llist);
            kfree(cifs_file->llist);
            up_write(&cifsi->lock_sem);
    
    So we can safely ignore unlocking failures in cifs_lock() if they
    happen with the FL_CLOSE flag hint set as both the server and the
    client take care of it during the actual closing.
    
    This is not a proper fix for the unlocking failure but it's safe and
    it seems to prevent the lock leakages and crashes the customer
    experiences.

    mm: mempolicy: make mbind() return -EIO when MPOL_MF_STRICT is specified
    
    commit a7f40cfe3b7ada57af9b62fd28430eeb4a7cfcb7 upstream.
    
    When MPOL_MF_STRICT was specified and an existing page was already on a
    node that does not follow the policy, mbind() should return -EIO.  But
    commit 6f4576e3687b ("mempolicy: apply page table walker on
    queue_pages_range()") broke the rule.
    
    And commit c8633798497c ("mm: mempolicy: mbind and migrate_pages support
    thp migration") didn't return the correct value for THP mbind() too.
    
    If MPOL_MF_STRICT is set, ignore vma_migratable() to make sure it
    reaches queue_pages_to_pte_range() or queue_pages_pmd() to check if an
    existing page was already on a node that does not follow the policy.
    And, non-migratable vma may be used, return -EIO too if MPOL_MF_MOVE or
    MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL was specified.
    
    Tested with https://github.com/metan-ucw/ltp/blob/master/testcases/kernel/syscalls/mbind/mbind02.c

    tty/serial: atmel: RS485 HD w/DMA: enable RX after TX is stopped
    
    commit 69646d7a3689fbe1a65ae90397d22ac3f1b8d40f upstream.
    
    In half-duplex operation, RX should be started after TX completes.
    
    If DMA is used, there is a case when the DMA transfer completes but the
    TX FIFO is not emptied, so the RX cannot be restarted just yet.
    
    Use a boolean variable to store this state and rearm TX interrupt mask
    to be signaled again that the transfer finished. In interrupt transmit
    handler this variable is used to start RX. A warning message is generated
    if RX is activated before TX fifo is cleared.

    lib/int_sqrt: optimize initial value compute
    
    commit f8ae107eef209bff29a5816bc1aad40d5cd69a80 upstream.
    
    The initial value (@m) compute is:
    
            m = 1UL << (BITS_PER_LONG - 2);
            while (m > x)
                    m >>= 2;
    
    Which is a linear search for the highest even bit smaller or equal to @x
    We can implement this using a binary search using __fls() (or better when
    its hardware implemented).
    
            m = 1UL << (__fls(x) & ~1UL);
    
    Especially for small values of @x; which are the more common arguments
    when doing a CDF on idle times; the linear search is near to worst case,
    while the binary search of __fls() is a constant 6 (or 5 on 32bit)
    branches.

    ext4: cleanup bh release code in ext4_ind_remove_space()
    
    commit 5e86bdda41534e17621d5a071b294943cae4376e upstream.
    
    Currently, we are releasing the indirect buffer where we are done with
    it in ext4_ind_remove_space(), so we can see the brelse() and
    BUFFER_TRACE() everywhere.  It seems fragile and hard to read, and we
    may probably forget to release the buffer some day.  This patch cleans
    up the code by putting of the code which releases the buffers to the
    end of the function.

    arm64: debug: Don't propagate UNKNOWN FAR into si_code for debug signals
    
    commit b9a4b9d084d978f80eb9210727c81804588b42ff upstream.
    
    FAR_EL1 is UNKNOWN for all debug exceptions other than those caused by
    taking a hardware watchpoint. Unfortunately, if a debug handler returns
    a non-zero value, then we will propagate the UNKNOWN FAR value to
    userspace via the si_addr field of the SIGTRAP siginfo_t.
    
    Instead, let's set si_addr to take on the PC of the faulting instruction,
    which we have available in the current pt_regs.
