    drm/i915: Treat crtc->mode.clock == 0 as disabled
    
    commit 3490ea5de6ac4af309c3df8a26a5cca61306334c upstream.
    
    Prevent a divide-by-zero by consistently treating an 'active' CRTC
    without a mode set as actually disabled.

    i915: ensure that VGA plane is disabled
    
    commit 0fde901f1ddd2ce0e380a6444f1fb7ca555859e9 upstream.
    
    Some broken systems (like HP nc6120) in some cases, usually after LID
    close/open, enable VGA plane, making display unusable (black screen on LVDS,
    some strange mode on VGA output). We used to disable VGA plane only once at
    startup. Now we also check, if VGA plane is still disabled while changing
    mode, and fix that if something changed it.

    drm/i915: force restore on lid open
    
    commit 45e2b5f640b3766da3eda48f6c35f088155c06f3 upstream.

    If client sends cap message that requests new max size during

    rbd: remove linger unconditionally
    
    (cherry picked from commit 61c74035626beb25a39b0273ccf7d75510bc36a1)
    
    In __unregister_linger_request(), the request is being removed
    from the osd client's req_linger list only when the request
    has a non-null osd pointer.  It should be done whether or not
    the request currently has an osd.
    
    This is most likely a non-issue because I believe the request
    will always have an osd when this function is called.

    rbd: get rid of RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN
    
    (cherry picked from commit 2fd82b9e92c2a718ae81fc987b4468ceeee6979b)
    
    RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN represents the maximum length of an rbd object
    name (i.e., one of the objects providing storage backing an rbd
    image).
    
    Another symbol, MAX_OBJ_NAME_SIZE, is used in the osd client code to
    define the maximum length of any object name in an osd request.
    
    Right now they disagree, with RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN being too big.
    
    There's no real benefit at this point to defining the rbd object
    name length limit separate from any other object name, so just
    get rid of RBD_MAX_SEG_NAME_LEN and use MAX_OBJ_NAME_SIZE in its
    place.

    (cherry picked from commit 42382b709bd1d143b9f0fa93e0a3a1f2f4210707)
    
    There is no check in rbd_remove() to see if anybody holds open the

    Add a simple open count that goes up and down with opens and closes
    (releases) of the device, and don't allow an rbd image to be removed
    if the count is non-zero.
    
    Protect the updates of the open count value with ctl_mutex to ensure
    the underlying rbd device doesn't get removed while concurrently
    being opened.

    rbd: remove snapshots on error in rbd_add()
    
    (cherry picked from commit 41f38c2b2f8b66b176a0e548ef06294343a7bfa2)
    
    If rbd_dev_snaps_update() has ever been called for an rbd device
    structure there could be snapshot structures on its snaps list.
    In rbd_add(), this function is called but a subsequent error
    path neglected to clean up any of these snapshots.
    
    Add a call to rbd_remove_all_snaps() in the appropriate spot to
    remedy this.  Change a couple of error labels to be a little
    clearer while there.
    
    Drop the leading underscores from the function name; there's nothing
    special about that function that they might signify.  As suggested
    in review, the leading underscores in __rbd_remove_snap_dev() have
    been removed as well.

    rbd: increase maximum snapshot name length
    
    (cherry picked from commit d4b125e9eb43babd14538ba61718e3db71a98d29)
    
    Change RBD_MAX_SNAP_NAME_LEN to be based on NAME_MAX.  That is a
    practical limit for the length of a snapshot name (based on the
    presence of a directory using the name under /sys/bus/rbd to
    represent the snapshot).
    
    The /sys entry is created by prefixing it with "snap_"; define that
    prefix symbolically, and take its length into account in defining
    the snapshot name length limit.
    
    Enforce the limit in rbd_add_parse_args().  Also delete a dout()
    call in that function that was not meant to be committed.

    rbd: zero return code in rbd_dev_image_id()
    
    (cherry picked from commit a0ea3a40fd20b8c66381f747c454f89d6d1f50d4)
    
    When rbd_dev_probe() calls rbd_dev_image_id() it expects to get
    a 0 return code if successful, but it is getting a positive value.
    
    The reason is that rbd_dev_image_id() returns the value it gets from
    rbd_req_sync_exec(), which returns the number of bytes read in as a
    result of the request.  (This ultimately comes from
    ceph_copy_from_page_vector() in rbd_req_sync_op()).
    
    Force the return value to 0 when successful in rbd_dev_image_id().
    Do the same in rbd_dev_v2_object_prefix().

    libceph: remove 'osdtimeout' option
    
    (cherry picked from commit 83aff95eb9d60aff5497e9f44a2ae906b86d8e88)
    
    This would reset a connection with any OSD that had an outstanding
    request that was taking more than N seconds.  The idea was that if the
    OSD was buggy, the client could compensate by resending the request.
    
    In reality, this only served to hide server bugs, and we haven't
    actually seen such a bug in quite a while.  Moreover, the userspace
    client code never did this.
    
    More importantly, often the request is taking a long time because the
    OSD is trying to recover, or overloaded, and killing the connection
    and retrying would only make the situation worse by giving the OSD
    more work to do.

    libceph: avoid using freed osd in __kick_osd_requests()
    
    (cherry picked from commit 685a7555ca69030739ddb57a47f0ea8ea80196a4)
    
    If an osd has no requests and no linger requests, __reset_osd()
    will just remove it with a call to __remove_osd().  That drops
    a reference to the osd, and therefore the osd may have been free
    by the time __reset_osd() returns.  That function offers no
    indication this may have occurred, and as a result the osd will
    continue to be used even when it's no longer valid.
    
    Change__reset_osd() so it returns an error (ENODEV) when it
    deletes the osd being reset.  And change __kick_osd_requests() so it
    returns immediately (before referencing osd again) if __reset_osd()
    returns *any* error.

    libceph: fix protocol feature mismatch failure path
    
    (cherry picked from commit 0fa6ebc600bc8e830551aee47a0e929e818a1868)
    
    We should not set con->state to CLOSED here; that happens in
    ceph_fault() in the caller, where it first asserts that the state
    is not yet CLOSED.  Avoids a BUG when the features don't match.
    
    Since the fail_protocol() has become a trivial wrapper, replace
    calls to it with direct calls to reset_connection().

    The bogus lvds output is actually a lvds->hdmi bridge, which we don't

    libceph: WARN, don't BUG on unexpected connection states
    
    (cherry picked from commit 122070a2ffc91f87fe8e8493eb0ac61986c5557c)
    
    A number of assertions in the ceph messenger are implemented with
    BUG_ON(), killing the system if connection's state doesn't match
    what's expected.  At this point our state model is (evidently) not
    well understood enough for these assertions to trigger a BUG().
    Convert all BUG_ON(con->state...) calls to be WARN_ON(con->state...)
    so we learn about these issues without killing the machine.
    
    We now recognize that a connection fault can occur due to a socket
    closure at any time, regardless of the state of the connection.  So
    there is really nothing we can assert about the state of the
    connection at that point so eliminate that assertion.

    libceph: always reset osds when kicking
    
    (cherry picked from commit e6d50f67a6b1a6252a616e6e629473b5c4277218)
    
    When ceph_osdc_handle_map() is called to process a new osd map,
    kick_requests() is called to ensure all affected requests are
    updated if necessary to reflect changes in the osd map.  This
    happens in two cases:  whenever an incremental map update is
    processed; and when a full map update (or the last one if there is
    more than one) gets processed.
    
    In the former case, the kick_requests() call is followed immediately
    by a call to reset_changed_osds() to ensure any connections to osds
    affected by the map change are reset.  But for full map updates
    this isn't done.
    
    Both cases should be doing this osd reset.
    
    Rather than duplicating the reset_changed_osds() call, move it into
    the end of kick_requests().

    libceph: move linger requests sooner in kick_requests()
    
    (cherry picked from commit ab60b16d3c31b9bd9fd5b39f97dc42c52a50b67d)
    
    The kick_requests() function is called by ceph_osdc_handle_map()
    when an osd map change has been indicated.  Its purpose is to
    re-queue any request whose target osd is different from what it
    was when it was originally sent.
    
    It is structured as two loops, one for incomplete but registered
    requests, and a second for handling completed linger requests.
    As a special case, in the first loop if a request marked to linger
    has not yet completed, it is moved from the request list to the
    linger list.  This is as a quick and dirty way to have the second
    loop handle sending the request along with all the other linger
    requests.
    
    Because of the way it's done now, however, this quick and dirty
    solution can result in these incomplete linger requests never
    getting re-sent as desired.  The problem lies in the fact that
    the second loop only arranges for a linger request to be sent
    if it appears its target osd has changed.  This is the proper
    handling for *completed* linger requests (it avoids issuing
    the same linger request twice to the same osd).
    
    But although the linger requests added to the list in the first loop
    may have been sent, they have not yet completed, so they need to be
    re-sent regardless of whether their target osd has changed.
    
    The first required fix is we need to avoid calling __map_request()
    on any incomplete linger request.  Otherwise the subsequent
    __map_request() call in the second loop will find the target osd
    has not changed and will therefore not re-send the request.
    
    Second, we need to be sure that a sent but incomplete linger request
    gets re-sent.  If the target osd is the same with the new osd map as
    it was when the request was originally sent, this won't happen.
    This can be fixed through careful handling when we move these
    requests from the request list to the linger list, by unregistering
    the request *before* it is registered as a linger request.  This
    works because a side-effect of unregistering the request is to make
    the request's r_osd pointer be NULL, and *that* will ensure the
    second loop actually re-sends the linger request.
    
    Processing of such a request is done at that point, so continue with
    the next one once it's been moved.

    libceph: don't use rb_init_node() in ceph_osdc_alloc_request()
    
    (cherry picked from commit a978fa20fb657548561dddbfb605fe43654f0825)
    
    The red-black node in the ceph osd request structure is initialized
    in ceph_osdc_alloc_request() using rbd_init_node().  We do need to
    initialize this, because in __unregister_request() we call
    RB_EMPTY_NODE(), which expects the node it's checking to have
    been initialized.  But rb_init_node() is apparently overkill, and
    may in fact be on its way out.  So use RB_CLEAR_NODE() instead.

    libceph: report connection fault with warning
    
    (cherry picked from commit 28362986f8743124b3a0fda20a8ed3e80309cce1)
    
    When a connection's socket disconnects, or if there's a protocol
    error of some kind on the connection, a fault is signaled and
    the connection is reset (closed and reopened, basically).  We
    currently get an error message on the log whenever this occurs.
    
    A ceph connection will attempt to reestablish a socket connection
    repeatedly if a fault occurs.  This means that these error messages
    will get repeatedly added to the log, which is undesirable.
    
    Change the error message to be a warning, so they don't get
    logged by default.

    dm thin: fix race between simultaneous io and discards to same block
    
    commit e8088073c9610af017fd47fddd104a2c3afb32e8 upstream.
    
    There is a race when discard bios and non-discard bios are issued
    simultaneously to the same block.
    
    Discard support is expensive for all thin devices precisely because you
    have to be careful to quiesce the area you're discarding.  DM thin must
    handle this conflicting IO pattern (simultaneous non-discard vs discard)
    even though a sane application shouldn't be issuing such IO.
    
    The race manifests as follows:
    
    1. A non-discard bio is mapped in thin_bio_map.
       This doesn't lock out parallel activity to the same block.
    
    2. A discard bio is issued to the same block as the non-discard bio.
    
    3. The discard bio is locked in a dm_bio_prison_cell in process_discard
       to lock out parallel activity against the same block.
    
    4. The non-discard bio's mapping continues and its all_io_entry is
       incremented so the bio is accounted for in the thin pool's all_io_ds
       which is a dm_deferred_set used to track time locality of non-discard IO.
    
    5. The non-discard bio is finally locked in a dm_bio_prison_cell in
       process_bio.
    
    The race can result in deadlock, leaving the block layer hanging waiting
    for completion of a discard bio that never completes, e.g.:
    
    INFO: task ruby:15354 blocked for more than 120 seconds.
    "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

    The thinp-test-suite's test_discard_random_sectors reliably hits this
    deadlock on fast SSD storage.
    
    The fix for this race is that the all_io_entry for a bio must be
    incremented whilst the dm_bio_prison_cell is held for the bio's
    associated virtual and physical blocks.  That cell locking wasn't
    occurring early enough in thin_bio_map.  This patch fixes this.
    
    Care is taken to always call the new function inc_all_io_entry() with
    the relevant cells locked, but they are generally unlocked before
    calling issue() to try to avoid holding the cells locked across
    generic_submit_request.
    
    Also, now that thin_bio_map may lock bios in a cell, process_bio() is no
    longer the only thread that will do so.  Because of this we must be sure
    to use cell_defer_except() to release all non-holder entries, that
    were added by the other thread, because they must be deferred.
    
    This patch depends on "dm thin: replace dm_cell_release_singleton with
    cell_defer_except".

    commit bc3b7756b5ff66828acf7bc24f148d28b8d61108 upstream.
    
    Current code does integer division (min_vol = min_uV / 1000) before pass
    min_vol to max8997_get_voltage_proper_val().
    So it is possible min_vol is truncated to a smaller value.
    
    For example, if the request min_uV is 800900 for ldo.
    min_vol = 800900 / 1000 = 800 (mV)
    Then max8997_get_voltage_proper_val returns 800 mV for this case which is lower
    than the requested voltage.
    
    Use uV rather than mV in voltage_map_desc to prevent truncation by integer
    division.

    USB: ehci: make debug port in-use detection functional again
    
    commit 75e1a2ae1f61ce1ae640410ba757bba84bd9fefe upstream.
    
    Debug port in-use determination must be done before the controller gets
    reset the first time, i.e. before the call to ehci_setup() as of commit
    1a49e2ac9651df7349867a5cf44e2c83de1046af. That commit effectively
    rendered commit 9fa5780beea1274d498a224822397100022da7d4 useless.
    
    While moving that code around, also fix the BAR determination - the
    respective capability field is a 3- rather than a 2-bit one -, and use
    PCI_CAP_ID_DBG instead of the literal 0x0a.
    
    It's unclear to me whether the debug port functionality is important
    enough to warrant fixing this in stable kernels too.

    xhci: Handle HS bulk/ctrl endpoints that don't NAK.
    
    commit 55c1945edaac94c5338a3647bc2e85ff75d9cf36 upstream.
    
    A high speed control or bulk endpoint may have bInterval set to zero,
    which means it does not NAK.  If bInterval is non-zero, it means the
    endpoint NAKs at a rate of 2^(bInterval - 1).
    
    The xHCI code to compute the NAK interval does not handle the special
    case of zero properly.  The current code unconditionally subtracts one
    from bInterval and uses it as an exponent.  This causes a very large
    bInterval to be used, and warning messages like these will be printed:
    
    usb 1-1: ep 0x1 - rounding interval to 32768 microframes, ep desc says 0 microframes
    
    This may cause the xHCI host hardware to reject the Configure Endpoint
    command, which means the HS device will be unusable under xHCI ports.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that contain
    commit dfa49c4ad120a784ef1ff0717168aa79f55a483a "USB: xhci - fix math in

    xhci: Avoid "dead ports", add roothub port polling.
    
    commit c52804a472649b2e5005342308739434cbd51119 upstream.
    
    The USB core hub thread (khubd) is designed with external USB hubs in
    mind.  It expects that if a port status change bit is set, the hub will
    continue to send a notification through the hub status data transfer.
    Basically, it expects hub notifications to be level-triggered.
    
    The xHCI host controller is designed to be edge-triggered on the logical
    'OR' of all the port status change bits.  When all port status change
    bits are clear, and a new change bit is set, the xHC will generate a
    Port Status Change Event.  If another change bit is set in the same port
    status register before the first bit is cleared, it will not send
    another event.
    
    This means that the hub code may lose port status changes because of
    race conditions between clearing change bits.  The user sees this as a
    "dead port" that doesn't react to device connects.
    
    The fix is to turn on port polling whenever a new change bit is set.
    Once the USB core issues a hub status request that shows that no change
    bits are set in any USB ports, turn off port polling.
    
    We can't allow the USB core to poll the roothub for port events during
    host suspend because if the PCI host is in D3cold, the port registers
    will be all f's.  Instead, stop the port polling timer, and
    unconditionally restart it when the host resumes.  If there are no port
    change bits set after the resume, the first call to hub_status_data will
    disable polling.
    
    This patch should be backported to stable kernels with the first xHCI
    support, 2.6.31 and newer, that include the commit
    0f2a79300a1471cf92ab43af165ea13555c8b0a5 "USB: xhci: Root hub support."
    There will be merge conflicts because the check for HC_STATE_SUSPENDED
    was moved into xhci_suspend in 3.8.

    USB: Handle warm reset failure on empty port.
    
    commit 65bdac5effd15d6af619b3b7218627ef4d84ed6a upstream.
    
    An empty port can transition to either Inactive or Compliance Mode if a
    newly connected USB 3.0 device fails to link train.  In that case, we
    issue a warm reset.  Some devices, such as John's Roseweil eusb3
    enclosure, slip back into Compliance Mode after the warm reset.
    
    The current warm reset code does not check for device connect status on
    warm reset completion, and it incorrectly reports the warm reset
    succeeded.  This causes the USB core to attempt to send a Set Address
    control transfer to a port in Compliance Mode, which will always fail.
    
    Make hub_port_wait_reset check the current connect status and link state
    after the warm reset completes.  Return a failure status if the device
    is disconnected or the link state is Compliance Mode or SS.Inactive.
    
    Make hub_events disable the port if warm reset fails.  This will disable
    the port, and then bring it back into the RxDetect state.  Make the USB
    core ignore the connect change until the device reconnects.
    
    Note that this patch does NOT handle connected devices slipping into the
    Inactive state very well.  This is a concern, because devices can go
    into the Inactive state on U1/U2 exit failure.  However, the fix for
    that case is too large for stable, so it will be submitted in a separate
    patch.
    
    This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, contain the
    commit ID 75d7cf72ab9fa01dc70877aa5c68e8ef477229dc "usbcore: refine warm

    USB: Ignore port state until reset completes.
    
    commit 4f43447e62b37ee19c82a13f72f35b1ca60a74d3 upstream.
    
    The port reset code bails out early if the current connect status is
    cleared (device disconnected).  If we're issuing a hot reset, it may
    also look at the link state before the reset is finished.
    
    Section 10.14.2.6 of the USB 3.0 spec says that when a port enters the
    Error state or Resetting state, the port connection bit retains the
    value from the previous state.  Therefore we can't trust it until the
    reset finishes.  Also, the xHCI spec section 4.19.1.2.5 says software
    shall ignore the link state while the port is resetting, as it can be in
    an unknown state.
    
    The port state during reset is also unknown for USB 2.0 hubs.  The hub
    sends a reset signal by driving the bus into an SE0 state.  This
    overwhelms the "connect" signal from the device, so the port can't tell
    whether anything is connected or not.
    
    Fix the port reset code to ignore the port link state and current
    connect bit until the reset finishes, and USB_PORT_STAT_RESET is
    cleared.
    
    Remove the check for USB_PORT_STAT_C_BH_RESET in the warm reset case,
    because it's redundant.  When the warm reset finishes, the port reset
    bit will be cleared at the same time USB_PORT_STAT_C_BH_RESET is set.
    Remove the now-redundant check for a cleared USB_PORT_STAT_RESET bit
    in the code to deal with the finished reset.
    
    This patch should be backported to all stable kernels.

    USB: Increase reset timeout.
    
    commit 77c7f072c87fa951e9a74805febf26466f31170c upstream.
    
    John's NEC 0.96 xHCI host controller needs a longer timeout for a warm
    reset to complete.  The logs show it takes 650ms to complete the warm
    reset, so extend the hub reset timeout to 800ms to be on the safe side.

    USB: Allow USB 3.0 ports to be disabled.
    
    commit 41e7e056cdc662f704fa9262e5c6e213b4ab45dd upstream.
    
    If hot and warm reset fails, or a port remains in the Compliance Mode,
    the USB core needs to be able to disable a USB 3.0 port.  Unlike USB 2.0
    ports, once the port is placed into the Disabled link state, it will not
    report any new device connects.  To get device connect notifications, we
    need to put the link into the Disabled state, and then the RxDetect
    state.
    
    The xHCI driver needs to atomically clear all change bits on USB 3.0
    port disable, so that we get Port Status Change Events for future port
    changes.  We could technically do this in the USB core instead of in the
    xHCI roothub code, since the port state machine can't advance out of the
    disabled state until we set the link state to RxDetect.  However,
    external USB 3.0 hubs don't need this code.  They are level-triggered,
    not edge-triggered like xHCI, so they will continue to send interrupt
    events when any change bit is set.  Therefore it doesn't make sense to
    put this code in the USB core.
    
    This patch is part of a series to fix several reports of infinite loops
    on device enumeration failure.  This includes John, when he boots with
    a USB 3.0 device (Roseweil eusb3 enclosure) attached to his NEC 0.96
    host controller.  The fix requires warm reset support, so it does not
    make sense to backport this patch to stable kernels without warm reset
    support.

    USB: Ignore xHCI Reset Device status.
    
    commit 8b8132bc3d1cc3d4c0687e4d638a482fa920d98a upstream.
    
    When the USB core finishes reseting a USB device, the xHCI driver sends
    a Reset Device command to the host.  The xHC then updates its internal
    representation of the USB device to the 'Default' device state.  If the
    device was already in the Default state, the xHC will complete the
    command with an error status.
    
    If a device needs to be reset several times during enumeration, the
    second reset will always fail because of the xHCI Reset Device command.
    This can cause issues during enumeration.
    
    For example, usb_reset_and_verify_device calls into hub_port_init in a
    loop.  Say that on the first call into hub_port_init, the device is
    successfully reset, but doesn't respond to several set address control
    transfers.  Then the port will be disabled, but the udev will remain in
    tact.  usb_reset_and_verify_device will call into hub_port_init again.
    
    On the second call into hub_port_init, the device will be reset, and the
    xHCI driver will issue a Reset Device command.  This command will fail
    (because the device is already in the Default state), and
    usb_reset_and_verify_device will fail.  The port will be disabled, and
    the device won't be able to enumerate.
    
    Fix this by ignoring the return value of the HCD reset_device callback.

    USB 3.0 hubs and roothubs will automatically transition a failed hot

    drm/nvc0/fb: fix crash when different mutex is used to protect same list
    
    commit 43f789792e2c7ea2bff37195e4c4b4239e9e02b7 upstream.
    
    Fixes regression introduced in commit 861d2107
    "drm/nouveau/fb: merge fb/vram and port to subdev interfaces"
    
    nv50_fb_vram_{new,del} functions were changed to use
    nouveau_subdev->mutex instead of the old nouveau_mm->mutex.
    nvc0_fb_vram_new still uses the nouveau_mm->mutex, but nvc0 doesn't
    have its own fb_vram_del function, using nv50_fb_vram_del instead.
    Because of this, on nvc0 a different mutex ends up being used to protect
    additions and deletions to the same list.
    
    This patch is a -stable candidate for 3.7.

    drm/nouveau/clock: fix support for more than 2 monitors on nve0
    
    commit d19528a9e4f220519c2cb3f56ef0c84ead3ee440 upstream.
    
    Fixes regression introduced in commit 70790f4f
    "drm/nouveau/clock: pull in the implementation from all over the place"
    
    When code was moved from nv50_crtc_set_clock to nvc0_clock_pll_set,
    the PLLs it is used for got limited to only the first two VPLLs.
    
    nv50_crtc_set_clock was only called to change VPLLs, so it didn't
    limit what it was used for in any way. Since nvc0_clock_pll_set is
    used for all PLLs, it has to specify which PLLs the code is used for,
    and only listed the first two VPLLs.

    drm/nouveau: fix blank LVDS screen regression on pre-nv50 cards
    
    commit 92441b2263866c27ef48137be5aa6c8c692652fc upstream.
    
    Commit 2a44e499 ("drm/nouveau/disp: introduce proper init/fini, separate
    from create/destroy") started to call display init routines on pre-nv50
    hardware on module load. But LVDS init code sets driver state in a way
    which prevents modesetting code from operating properly.
    
    nv04_display_init calls nv04_dfp_restore, which sets encoder->last_dpms to
    NV_DPMS_CLEARED.
    
    drm_crtc_helper_set_mode
      nv04_dfp_prepare
        nv04_lvds_dpms(DRM_MODE_DPMS_OFF)
    
    nv04_lvds_dpms checks last_dpms mode (which is NV_DPMS_CLEARED) and wrongly
    assumes it's a "powersaving mode", the new one (DRM_MODE_DPMS_OFF) is too,
    so it skips calling some crucial lvds scripts.

    drm/nv17-50: restore fence buffer on resume
    
    commit f20ebd034eab43fd38c58b11c5bb5fb125e5f7d7 upstream.
    
    Since commit 5e120f6e4b3f35b741c5445dfc755f50128c3c44 "drm/nouveau/fence:
    convert to exec engine, and improve channel sync" nouveau fence sync
    implementation for nv17-50 and nvc0+ started to rely on state of fence buffer
    left by previous sync operation. But as pinned bo's (where fence state is
    stored) are not saved+restored across suspend/resume, we need to do it
    manually.
    
    nvc0+ was fixed by commit d6ba6d215a538a58f0f0026f0961b0b9125e8042
    "drm/nvc0/fence: restore pre-suspend fence buffer context on resume".

    usb: gadget: dummy: fix enumeration with g_multi
    
    commit 1d16638e3b9cc195bac18a8fcbca748f33c1bc24 upstream.
    
    If we do have endpoints named like "ep-a" then bEndpointAddress is
    counted internally by the gadget framework.
    
    If we do have endpoints named like "ep-1" then bEndpointAddress is
    assigned from the digit after "ep-".
    
    If we do have both, then it is likely that after we used up the
    "generic" endpoints we will use the digits and thus assign one
    bEndpointAddress to multiple endpoints.
    
    This theory can be proofed by using the completely enabled g_multi.
    Without this patch, the mass storage won't enumerate and times out
    because it shares endpoints with RNDIS.
    
    This patch also adds fills up the endpoints list so we have in total
    endpoints 1 to 15 in + out available while some of them are restricted
    to certain types like BULK or ISO. Without this change the nokia gadget
    won't load because the system does not provide enough (BULK) endpoints
    but it did before ep-a - ep-f were removed.

    b43: Fix firmware loading when driver is built into the kernel
    
    commit 5e20a4b53094651d80f856ff55a916b999dbb57a upstream.
    
    Recent versions of udev cause synchronous firmware loading from the
    probe routine to fail because the request to user space would time
    out. The original fix for b43 (commit 6b6fa58) moved the firmware
    load from the probe routine to a work queue, but it still used synchronous
    firmware loading. This method is OK when b43 is built as a module;
    however, it fails when the driver is compiled into the kernel.
    
    This version changes the code to load the initial firmware file
    using request_firmware_nowait(). A completion event is used to
    hold the work queue until that file is available. This driver
    reads several firmware files - the remainder can be read synchronously.
    On some test systems, the async read fails; however, a following synch
    read works, thus the async failure falls through to the sync try.

    commit 9c969d8ccb1e17bd20742f4ac9f00c1a64487234 upstream.

    required. Also, we have removed mwifiex_cancel_pending_ioctl()
    call to avoid a chance of sending second command to FW by other path
    as soon as we clear current command node. FW can not handle two
    commands simultaneously.

    commit a56f992cdabc63f56b4b142885deebebf936ff76 upstream.
    
    This is a very old bug, but there's nothing that prevents the
    timer from running while the module is being removed when we
    only do del_timer() instead of del_timer_sync().
    
    The timer should normally not be running at this point, but
    it's not clearly impossible (or we could just remove this.)

    mac80211: fix station destruction in AP/mesh modes
    
    commit 97f97b1f5fe0878b35c8e314f98591771696321b upstream.
    
    Unfortunately, commit b22cfcfcae5b, intended to speed up roaming
    by avoiding the synchronize_rcu() broke AP/mesh modes as it moved
    some code into that work item that will still call into the driver
    at a time where it's no longer expected to handle this: after the
    AP or mesh has been stopped.
    
    To fix this problem remove the per-station work struct, maintain a
    station cleanup list instead and flush this list when stations are
    flushed. To keep this patch smaller for stable, do this when the
    stations are flushed (sta_info_flush()). This unfortunately brings
    back the original roaming delay; I'll fix that again in a separate
    patch.
    
    Also, Ben reported that the original commit could sometimes (with
    many interfaces) cause long delays when an interface is set down,
    due to blocking on flush_workqueue(). Since we now maintain the
    cleanup list, this particular change of the original patch can be
    reverted.

    staging: zram: fix invalid memory references during disk write
    
    commit 397c60668aa5ae7130b5ad4e73870d7b8a787085 upstream.
    
    Fixes a bug introduced by commit c8f2f0db1 ("zram: Fix handling
    of incompressible pages") which caused invalid memory references
    during disk write. Invalid references could occur in two cases:
     - Incoming data expands on compression: In this case, reference was
    made to kunmap()'ed bio page.
     - Partial (non PAGE_SIZE) write with incompressible data: In this
    case, reference was made to a kfree()'ed buffer.
    
    Fixes bug 50081:

    staging: comedi: comedi_test: fix race when cancelling command
    
    commit c0729eeefdcd76db338f635162bf0739fd2c5f6f upstream.
    
    Éric Piel reported a kernel oops in the "comedi_test" module.  It was a
    NULL pointer dereference within `waveform_ai_interrupt()` (actually a
    timer function) that sometimes occurred when a running asynchronous
    command is cancelled (either by the `COMEDI_CANCEL` ioctl or by closing
    the device file).
    
    This seems to be a race between the caller of `waveform_ai_cancel()`
    which on return from that function goes and tears down the running
    command, and the timer function which uses the command.  In particular,
    `async->cmd.chanlist` gets freed (and the pointer set to NULL) by
    `do_become_nonbusy()` in "comedi_fops.c" but a previously scheduled
    `waveform_ai_interrupt()` timer function will dereference that pointer
    regardless, leading to the oops.
    
    Fix it by replacing the `del_timer()` call in `waveform_ai_cancel()`
    with `del_timer_sync()`.

    commit 34b55d8c48f4f76044d8f4d6ec3dc786cf210312 upstream.
    
    The minimum period was set to 357 ns, while the divider for these boards is 50
    ns. This prevented to output at maximum speed as ni_ao_cmdtest() would return
    357 but would not accept it.
    
    Not sure why it was set to 357 ns (this was done before the git history,
    which starts 5 years ago). My guess is that it comes from reading the
    specification stating a 2.8 MHz rate (~ 357 ns). The latest
    specification states a 2.86 MHz rate (~ 350 ns), which makes a lot
    more sense.

    staging: comedi: prevent auto-unconfig of manually configured devices
    
    commit 7d3135af399e92cf4c9bbc5f86b6c140aab3b88c upstream.
    
    When a low-level comedi driver auto-configures a device, a `struct
    comedi_dev_file_info` is allocated (as well as a `struct
    comedi_device`) by `comedi_alloc_board_minor()`.  A pointer to the
    hardware `struct device` is stored as a cookie in the `struct
    comedi_dev_file_info`.  When the low-level comedi driver
    auto-unconfigures the device, `comedi_auto_unconfig()` uses the cookie
    to find the `struct comedi_dev_file_info` so it can detach the comedi
    device from the driver, clean it up and free it.
    
    A problem arises if the user manually unconfigures and reconfigures the
    comedi device using the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl so that is no longer
    associated with the original hardware device.  The problem is that the
    cookie is not cleared, so that a call to `comedi_auto_unconfig()` from
    the low-level driver will still find it, detach it, clean it up and free
    it.
    
    Stop this problem occurring by always clearing the `hardware_device`
    cookie in the `struct comedi_dev_file_info` whenever the
    `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl call is successful.

    ALSA: pxa27x: fix ac97 warm reset
    
    commit 3b4bc7bccc7857274705b05cf81a0c72cfd0b0dd upstream.
    
    This patch fixes some code that implements a work-around to a hardware bug in
    the ac97 controller on the pxa27x.  A bug in the controller's warm reset
    functionality requires that the mfp used by the controller as the AC97_nRESET
    line be temporarily reconfigured as a generic output gpio (AF0) and manually
    held high for the duration of the warm reset cycle.  This is what was done in
    the original code, but it was broken long ago by commit fb1bf8cd
        ([ARM] pxa: introduce processor specific pxa27x_assert_ac97reset())
    which changed the mfp to a GPIO input instead of a high output.
    
    The fix requires the ac97 controller to obtain the gpio via gpio_request_one(),
    with arguments that configure the gpio as an output initially driven high.
    
    Tested on a palm treo 680 machine.  Reportedly, this broken code only prevents a
    warm reset on hardware that lacks a pull-up on the line, which appears to be the
    case for me.

    commit 41b645c8624df6ace020a8863ad1449d69140f7d upstream.
    
    Cold reset on the pxa27x currently fails and
    
         pxa2xx_ac97_try_cold_reset: cold reset timeout (GSR=0x44)
    
    appears in the kernel log.  Through trial-and-error (the pxa270 developer's
    manual is mostly incoherent on the topic of ac97 reset), I got cold reset to
    complete by setting the WARM_RST bit in the GCR register (and later noticed that
    pxa3xx does this for cold reset as well).  Also, a timeout loop is needed to
    wait for the reset to complete.

    vfs: add missing virtual cache flush after editing partial pages
    
    commit 6d283dba3721cc43be014b50a1acc2f35860a65a upstream.
    
    Andrew Morton pointed this out a month ago, and then I completely forgot
    about it.
    
    If we read a partial last page of a block device, we will zero out the
    end of the page, but since that page can then be mapped into user space,
    we should also make sure to flush the cache on architectures that have
    virtual caches.  We have the flush_dcache_page() function for this, so
    use it.
    
    Now, in practice this really never matters, because nobody sane uses
    virtual caches to begin with, and they largely exist on old broken RISC
    arhitectures.
    
    And even if you did run on one of those obsolete CPU's, the whole "mmap
    and access the last partial page of a block device" behavior probably
    doesn't actually exist.  The normal IO functions (read/write) will never
    see the zeroed-out part of the page that migth not be coherent in the
    cache, because they honor the size of the device.
    
    So I'm marking this for stable (3.7 only), but I'm not sure anybody will
    ever care.

    udldrmfb: Fix EDID not working with monitors with EDID extension blocks
    
    commit c930812fe5ebe725760422c9c351d1f6fde1502d upstream.
    
    udldrmfb only reads the main EDID block, and if that advertises extensions
    the drm_edid code expects them to be present, and starts reading beyond the
    buffer udldrmfb passes it.
    
    Although it may be possible to read more EDID info with the udl we simpy don't
    know how, and even if trial and error gets it working on one device, that is
    no guarantee it will work on other revisions. So this patch does a simple fix
    in the form of patching the EDID info to report 0 extension blocks, this
    fixes udldrmfb only doing 1024x768 on monitors with EDID extension blocks.

    Both the mask and mode settings are wrong in current code.
    
    According to the datasheet:
    
    S2PCFG0 (0x0A)
    BIT[3:1] DATA_FORMAT
            serial interface protocol format:
            000: left Justified

            010: right justified
            100: PCM no delay
            101: PCM delay
            111: DSP
    
    Thus fixes the defines for LEFT_J_DATA_FORMAT, I2S_DATA_FORMAT, and

    The USB recovery mode present in i.MX23 ROM emulates USB HID.  It needs this

    Even if the official branding of the chip is Freescale i.MX23, I named it
    Sigmatel STMP3780 since that's what the chip really is and it even reports
    itself as STMP3780.

    epoll: prevent missed events on EPOLL_CTL_MOD
    
    commit 128dd1759d96ad36c379240f8b9463e8acfd37a1 upstream.
    
    EPOLL_CTL_MOD sets the interest mask before calling f_op->poll() to
    ensure events are not missed.  Since the modifications to the interest
    mask are not protected by the same lock as ep_poll_callback, we need to
    ensure the change is visible to other CPUs calling ep_poll_callback.
    
    We also need to ensure f_op->poll() has an up-to-date view of past
    events which occured before we modified the interest mask.  So this
    barrier also pairs with the barrier in wq_has_sleeper().
    
    This should guarantee either ep_poll_callback or f_op->poll() (or both)
    will notice the readiness of a recently-ready/modified item.

    aoe: remove vestigial request queue allocation
    
    commit 0a41409c518083133e79015092585d68915865be upstream.
    
    Before the aoe driver was an I/O request handler, it was a
    make_request-style block driver.  Even so, there was a problem where
    sysfs expected a request queue to exist, so one was provided in commit
    7135a71b19be ("aoe: allocate unused request_queue for sysfs").
    
    During the transition to the request-handler style, a patch was merged
    that was based on a driver without the noop queue, and the noop queue
    remained in place after the patch was merged, even though a new
    functional queue was introduced by the patch, allocated through
    blk_init_queue.
    
    The user impact is a memory leak proportional to the number of AoE
    targets discovered.  This patch removes the memory leak and cleans up
    vestiges of the old do-nothing queue from the aoeblk_gdalloc function.

    ext4: avoid hang when mounting non-journal filesystems with orphan list
    
    commit 0e9a9a1ad619e7e987815d20262d36a2f95717ca upstream.
    
    When trying to mount a file system which does not contain a journal,
    but which does have a orphan list containing an inode which needs to
    be truncated, the mount call with hang forever in
    ext4_orphan_cleanup() because ext4_orphan_del() will return
    immediately without removing the inode from the orphan list, leading
    to an uninterruptible loop in kernel code which will busy out one of
    the CPU's on the system.
    
    This can be trivially reproduced by trying to mount the file system
    found in tests/f_orphan_extents_inode/image.gz from the e2fsprogs
    source tree.  If a malicious user were to put this on a USB stick, and
    mount it on a Linux desktop which has automatic mounts enabled, this
    could be considered a potential denial of service attack.  (Not a big
    deal in practice, but professional paranoids worry about such things,
    and have even been known to allocate CVE numbers for such problems.)

    Commit c278531d39 added a warning when ext4_flush_unwritten_io() is
    called without i_mutex being taken.  It had previously not been taken
    during orphan cleanup since races weren't possible at that point in
    the mount process, but as a result of this c278531d39, we will now see
    a kernel WARN_ON in this case.  Take the i_mutex in
    ext4_orphan_cleanup() to suppress this warning.

    ext4: do not try to write superblock on ro remount w/o journal
    
    commit d096ad0f79a782935d2e06ae8fb235e8c5397775 upstream.
    
    When a journal-less ext4 filesystem is mounted on a read-only block
    device (blockdev --setro will do), each remount (for other, unrelated,
    flags, like suid=>nosuid etc) results in a series of scary messages
    from kernel telling about I/O errors on the device.
    
    This is becauese of the following code ext4_remount():
    
           if (sbi->s_journal == NULL)
                    ext4_commit_super(sb, 1);
    
    at the end of remount procedure, which forces writing (flushing) of
    a superblock regardless whenever it is dirty or not, if the filesystem
    is readonly or not, and whenever the device itself is readonly or not.
    
    We only need call ext4_commit_super when the file system had been
    previously mounted read/write.
    
    Thanks to Eric Sandeen for help in diagnosing this issue.

    PM: Move disabling/enabling runtime PM to late suspend/early resume
    
    commit 9f6d8f6ab26b42620a914d67f29822f9bba90233 upstream.
    
    Currently, the PM core disables runtime PM for all devices right
    after executing subsystem/driver .suspend() callbacks for them
    and re-enables it right before executing subsystem/driver .resume()
    callbacks for them.  This may lead to problems when there are
    two devices such that the .suspend() callback executed for one of
    them depends on runtime PM working for the other.  In that case,
    if runtime PM has already been disabled for the second device,
    the first one's .suspend() won't work correctly (and analogously
    for resume).
    
    To make those issues go away, make the PM core disable runtime PM
    for devices right before executing subsystem/driver .suspend_late()
    callbacks for them and enable runtime PM for them right after
    executing subsystem/driver .resume_early() callbacks for them.  This
    way the potential conflitcs between .suspend_late()/.resume_early()
    and their runtime PM counterparts are still prevented from happening,
    but the subtle ordering issues related to disabling/enabling runtime
    PM for devices during system suspend/resume are much easier to avoid.

    commit 6c1ecba8d84841277d68140ef485335d5be28485 upstream.
    
    The VDCTRL4 register does not provide the MXS SET/CLR/TOGGLE feature.
    The write in mxsfb_disable_controller() sets the data_cnt for the LCD
    DMA to 0 which obviously means the max. count for the LCD DMA and
    leads to overwriting arbitrary memory when the display is unblanked.

    audit: create explicit AUDIT_SECCOMP event type
    
    commit 7b9205bd775afc4439ed86d617f9042ee9e76a71 upstream.
    
    The seccomp path was using AUDIT_ANOM_ABEND from when seccomp mode 1
    could only kill a process.  While we still want to make sure an audit
    record is forced on a kill, this should use a separate record type since
    seccomp mode 2 introduces other behaviors.
    
    In the case of "handled" behaviors (process wasn't killed), only emit a
    record if the process is under inspection.  This change also fixes
    userspace examination of seccomp audit events, since it was considered
    malformed due to missing fields of the AUDIT_ANOM_ABEND event type.

    hwmon: (lm73} Detect and report i2c bus errors
    
    commit 0602934f302e016e2ea5dc6951681bfac77455ef upstream.
    
    If an LM73 device does not exist on an I2C bus, attempts to communicate
    with the device result in an error code returned from the i2c read/write
    functions.  The current lm73 driver casts that return value from a s32
    type to a s16 type, then converts it to a temperature in celsius.
    Because negative temperatures are valid, it is difficult to distinguish
    between an error code printed to the response buffer and a negative
    temperature recorded by the sensor.
    
    The solution is to evaluate the return value from the i2c functions
    before performing any temperature calculations.  If the i2c function did
    not succeed, the error code should be passed back through the virtual
    file system layer instead of being printed into the response buffer.
    
    Before:
    
       $ cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/temp1_input
       -46
    
    After:
    
       $ cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/temp1_input
       cat: read error: No such device or address

    dm thin: replace dm_cell_release_singleton with cell_defer_except
    
    commit b7ca9c9273e5eebd63880dd8a6e4e5c18fc7901d upstream.
    
    Change existing users of the function dm_cell_release_singleton to share
    cell_defer_except instead, and then remove the now-unused function.
    
    Everywhere that calls dm_cell_release_singleton, the bio in question
    is the holder of the cell.
    
    If there are no non-holder entries in the cell then cell_defer_except
    behaves exactly like dm_cell_release_singleton.  Conversely, if there
    *are* non-holder entries then dm_cell_release_singleton must not be used
    because those entries would need to be deferred.
    
    Consequently, it is safe to replace use of dm_cell_release_singleton
    with cell_defer_except.
    
    This patch is a pre-requisite for "dm thin: fix race between
    simultaneous io and discards to same block".

    dm ioctl: prevent unsafe change to dm_ioctl data_size
    
    commit e910d7ebecd1aac43125944a8641b6cb1a0dfabe upstream.
    
    Abort dm ioctl processing if userspace changes the data_size parameter
    after we validated it but before we finished copying the data buffer
    from userspace.
    
    The dm ioctl parameters are processed in the following sequence:
     1. ctl_ioctl() calls copy_params();
     2. copy_params() makes a first copy of the fixed-sized portion of the
        userspace parameters into the local variable "tmp";
     3. copy_params() then validates tmp.data_size and allocates a new
        structure big enough to hold the complete data and copies the whole
        userspace buffer there;
     4. ctl_ioctl() reads userspace data the second time and copies the whole
        buffer into the pointer "param";
     5. ctl_ioctl() reads param->data_size without any validation and stores it
        in the variable "input_param_size";
     6. "input_param_size" is further used as the authoritative size of the
        kernel buffer.
    
    The problem is that userspace code could change the contents of user
    memory between steps 2 and 4.  In particular, the data_size parameter
    can be changed to an invalid value after the kernel has validated it.
    This lets userspace force the kernel to access invalid kernel memory.
    
    The fix is to ensure that the size has not changed at step 4.
    
    This patch shouldn't have a security impact because CAP_SYS_ADMIN is
    required to run this code, but it should be fixed anyway.

    commit c1a94672a830e01d58c7c7e8de530c3f136d6ff2 upstream.
    
    WRITE SAME bios are not yet handled correctly by device-mapper so
    disable their use on device-mapper devices by setting
    max_write_same_sectors to zero.
    
    As an example, a ciphertext device is incompatible because the data
    gets changed according to the location at which it written and so the
    dm crypt target cannot support it.

        drm/i915: Track unbound pages
    
    Closer inspection of that patch revealed a bunch of unrelated changes
    in the shrinker:
    - The shrinker count is now in pages instead of objects.
    - For counting the shrinkable objects the old code only looked at the
      inactive list, the new code looks at all bounds objects (including
      pinned ones). That is obviously in addition to the new unbound list.
    - The shrinker cound is no longer scaled with
      sysctl_vfs_cache_pressure. Note though that with the default tuning
      value of vfs_cache_pressue = 100 this doesn't affect the shrinker
      behaviour.
    - When actually shrinking objects, the old code first dropped
      purgeable objects, then normal (inactive) objects. Only then did it,
      in a last-ditch effort idle the gpu and evict everything. The new
      code omits the intermediate step of evicting normal inactive
      objects.
    
    Safe for the first change, which seems benign, and the shrinker count
    scaling, which is a bit a different story, the endresult of all these
    changes is that the shrinker is _much_ more likely to fall back to the
    last-ditch resort of idling the gpu and evicting everything.  The old
    code could only do that if something else evicted lots of objects
    meanwhile (since without any other changes the nr_to_scan will be
    smaller than the object count).
    
    Reverting the vfs_cache_pressure behaviour itself is a bit bogus: Only
    dentry/inode object caches should scale their shrinker counts with
    vfs_cache_pressure. Originally I've had that change reverted, too. But
    Chris Wilson insisted that it's too bogus and shouldn't again see the
    light of day.
    
    Hence revert all these other changes and restore the old shrinker
    behaviour, with the minor adjustment that we now first scan the
    unbound list, then the inactive list for each object category
    (purgeable or normal).
    
    A similar patch has been tested by a few people affected by the gen4/5
    hangs which started to appear in 3.7, which some people bisected to
    the "drm/i915: Track unbound pages" commit. But just disabling the
    unbound logic alone didn't change things at all.
    
    Note that this patch doesn't fix the referenced bugs, it only hides
    the underlying bug(s) well enough to restore pre-3.7 behaviour. The
    key to achieve that is to massively reduce the likelyhood of going
    into a full gpu stall and evicting everything.
    
    v2: Reword commit message a bit, taking Chris Wilson's comment into
    account.
    
    v3: On Chris Wilson's insistency, do not reinstate the rather bogus
    vfs_cache_pressure change.

    drm/prime: drop reference on imported dma-buf come from gem
    
    commit be8a42ae60addd8b6092535c11b42d099d6470ec upstream.
    
    Increasing ref counts of both dma-buf and gem for imported dma-buf come from gem
    makes memory leak. release function of dma-buf cannot be called because f_count
    of dma-buf increased by importing gem and gem ref count cannot be decrease
    because of exported dma-buf.
    
    So I add dma_buf_put() for imported gem come from its own gem into each drivers
    having prime_import and prime_export capabilities. With this, only gem ref
    count is increased if importing gem exported from gem of same driver.

    drm/i915: don't disable disconnected outputs
    
    commit b0a2658acb5bf9ca86b4aab011b7106de3af0add upstream.
    
    This piece of neat lore has been ported painstakingly and bug-for-bug
    compatible from the old crtc helper code.
    
    Imo it's utter nonsense.
    
    If you disconnected a cable and before you reconnect it, userspace (or
    the kernel) does an set_crtc call, this will result in that connector
    getting disabled. Which will result in a nice black screen when
    plugging in the cable again.
    
    There's absolutely no reason the kernel does such policy enforcements
    - if userspace tries to set up a mode on something disconnected we
    might fail loudly (since the dp link training fails), but silently
    adjusting the output configuration behind userspace's back is a recipe
    for disaster. Specifically I think that this could explain some of our
    MI_WAIT hangs around suspend, where userspace issues a scanline wait
    on a disable pipe. This mechanisims here could explain how that pipe
    got disabled without userspace noticing.
    
    Note that this fixes a NULL deref at BIOS takeover when the firmware
    sets up a disconnected output in a clone configuration with a
    connected output on the 2nd pipe: When doing the full modeset we don't
    have a mode for the 2nd pipe and OOPS. On the first pipe this doesn't
    matter, since at boot-up the fbdev helpers will set up the choosen
    configuration on that on first. Since this is now the umptenth bug
    around handling this imo brain-dead semantics correctly, I think it's
    time to kill it and see whether there's any userspace out there which
    relies on this.
    
    It also nicely demonstrates that we have a tiny window where DP
    hotplug can still kill the driver.

    drm/i915: Flush outstanding unpin tasks before pageflipping
    
    commit b4a98e57fc27854b5938fc8b08b68e5e68b91e1f upstream.
    
    If we accumulate unpin tasks because we are pageflipping faster than the
    system can schedule its workers, we can effectively create a
    pin-leak. The solution taken here is to limit the number of unpin tasks
    we have per-crtc and to flush those outstanding tasks if we accumulate
    too many. This should prevent any jitter in the normal case, and also
    prevent the hang if we should run too fast.
    
    Note: It is important that we switch from the system workqueue to our
    own dev_priv->wq since all work items on that queue are guaranteed to
    only need the dev->struct_mutex and not any modeset resources. For
    otherwise if we have a work item ahead in the queue which needs the
    modeset lock (like the output detect work used by both polling or
    hpd), this work and so the unpin work will never execute since the
    pageflip code already holds that lock. Unfortunately there's no
    lockdep support for this scenario in the workqueue code.

    drm/i915: Close race between processing unpin task and queueing the flip
    
    commit e7d841ca03b7ab668620045cd7b428eda9f41601 upstream.
    
    Before queuing the flip but crucially after attaching the unpin-work to
    the crtc, we continue to setup the unpin-work. However, should the
    hardware fire early, we see the connected unpin-work and queue the task.
    The task then promptly runs and unpins the fb before we finish taking
    the required references or even pinning it... Havoc.
    
    To close the race, we use the flip-pending atomic to indicate when the
    flip is finally setup and enqueued. So during the flip-done processing,
    we can check more accurately whether the flip was expected.
    
    v2: Add the appropriate mb() to ensure that the writes to the page-flip
    worker are complete prior to marking it active and emitting the MI_FLIP.
    On the read side, the mb should be enforced by the spinlocks.

    [danvet: Review the barriers a bit, we need a write barrier both

    well-ordered irqs only one barrier in each place should be required,
    but since this patch explicitly sets out to combat spurious interrupts
    with is staged activation of the unpin work we need to go full-bore on
    the barriers, too. Discussed with Chris Wilson on irc and changes

    mm: compaction: partially revert capture of suitable high-order page
    
    commit 8fb74b9fb2b182d54beee592350d9ea1f325917a upstream.
    
    Eric Wong reported on 3.7 and 3.8-rc2 that ppoll() got stuck when
    waiting for POLLIN on a local TCP socket.  It was easier to trigger if
    there was disk IO and dirty pages at the same time and he bisected it to
    commit 1fb3f8ca0e92 ("mm: compaction: capture a suitable high-order page
    immediately when it is made available").
    
    The intention of that patch was to improve high-order allocations under
    memory pressure after changes made to reclaim in 3.6 drastically hurt
    THP allocations but the approach was flawed.  For Eric, the problem was
    that page->pfmemalloc was not being cleared for captured pages leading
    to a poor interaction with swap-over-NFS support causing the packets to
    be dropped.  However, I identified a few more problems with the patch
    including the fact that it can increase contention on zone->lock in some
    cases which could result in async direct compaction being aborted early.
    
    In retrospect the capture patch took the wrong approach.  What it should
    have done is mark the pageblock being migrated as MIGRATE_ISOLATE if it
    was allocating for THP and avoided races that way.  While the patch was
    showing to improve allocation success rates at the time, the benefit is
    marginal given the relative complexity and it should be revisited from
    scratch in the context of the other reclaim-related changes that have
    taken place since the patch was first written and tested.  This patch
    partially reverts commit 1fb3f8ca0e92 ("mm: compaction: capture a
    suitable high-order page immediately when it is made available").

    drm/radeon: restore modeset late in GPU reset path
    
    commit d3493574e267c203836bfdcb9c58d8af46fc0da1 upstream.
    
    Modeset path seems to conflict sometimes with the memory management
    leading to kernel deadlock. This move modesetting reset after GPU
    acceleration reset.

    intel-iommu: Free old page tables before creating superpage
    
    commit 6491d4d02893d9787ba67279595990217177b351 upstream.
    
    The dma_pte_free_pagetable() function will only free a page table page
    if it is asked to free the *entire* 2MiB range that it covers. So if a
    page table page was used for one or more small mappings, it's likely to
    end up still present in the page tables... but with no valid PTEs.
    
    This was fine when we'd only be repopulating it with 4KiB PTEs anyway
    but the same virtual address range can end up being reused for a
    *large-page* mapping. And in that case were were trying to insert the
    large page into the second-level page table, and getting a complaint
    from the sanity check in __domain_mapping() because there was already a
    corresponding entry. This was *relatively* harmless; it led to a memory
    leak of the old page table page, but no other ill-effects.
    
    Fix it by calling dma_pte_clear_range (hopefully redundant) and
    dma_pte_free_pagetable() before setting up the new large page.

    SUNRPC: Ensure we release the socket write lock if the rpc_task exits early
    
    commit 87ed50036b866db2ec2ba16b2a7aec4a2b0b7c39 upstream.
    
    If the rpc_task exits while holding the socket write lock before it has
    allocated an rpc slot, then the usual mechanism for releasing the write
    lock in xprt_release() is defeated.
    
    The problem occurs if the call to xprt_lock_write() initially fails, so
    that the rpc_task is put on the xprt->sending wait queue. If the task
    exits after being assigned the lock by __xprt_lock_write_func, but
    before it has retried the call to xprt_lock_and_alloc_slot(), then
    it calls xprt_release() while holding the write lock, but will
    immediately exit due to the test for task->tk_rqstp != NULL.

    Commit bbf43dc888833ac0539e437dbaeb28bfd4fbab9f "sunrpc/cache.h: replace
    simple_strtoul" introduced new range-checking which could cause get_int
    to fail on unsigned integers too large to be represented as an int.
    
    We could parse them as unsigned instead--but it turns out svcgssd is
    actually passing down "-1" in some cases.  Which is perhaps stupid, but
    there's nothing we can do about it now.
    
    So just revert back to the previous "sloppy" behavior that accepts
    either representation.

    OMAP: board-files: fix i2c_bus for tfp410
    
    commit ca2e16faa7378878c1522a7c1b6c38211de3331d upstream.
    
    The i2c handling in tfp410 driver, which handles converting parallel RGB
    to DVI, was changed in 958f2717b84e88bf833d996997fda8f73276f2af
    (OMAPDSS: TFP410: pdata rewrite). The patch changed what value the
    driver considers as invalid/undefined.  Before the patch, 0 was the
    invalid value, but as 0 is a valid bus number, the patch changed this to
    -1.
    
    However, the fact was missed that many board files do not define the bus
    number at all, thus it's left to 0. This causes the driver to fail to
    get the i2c bus, exiting from the driver's probe with an error, meaning
    that the DVI output does not work for those boards.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by changing the i2c_bus number field in the
    driver's platform data from u16 to int, and setting the bus number to -1
    in the board files for the boards that did not define the bus. The
    exception is devkit8000, for which the bus is set to 1, which is the
    correct bus for that board.
    
    The bug exists in v3.5+ kernels.

    mtd: nand: gpmi: reset BCH earlier, too, to avoid NAND startup problems
    
    commit 6f2a6a52560ad8d85710aabd92b7a3239b3a6b07 upstream.
    
    It could happen (1 out of 100 times) that NAND did not start up
    correctly after warm rebooting, so the kernel could not find the UBI or
    DMA timed out due to a stalled BCH. When resetting BCH together with
    GPMI, the issue could not be observed anymore (after 10000+ reboots). We
    probably need the consistent state already before sending any command to
    NAND, even when no ECC is needed. I chose to keep the extra reset for
    BCH when changing the flash layout to be on the safe side.

    mfd: Remove Unicode Byte Order Marks from da9055
    
    commit 90a38d999739f35f4fc925c875e6ee518546b66c upstream.
    
    Older gcc (< 4.4) doesn't like files starting with Unicode BOMs:
    
    include/linux/mfd/da9055/core.h:1: error: stray ‘\357’ in program

    Remove the BOMs, the rest of the files is plain ASCII anyway.

    mfd: Only unregister platform devices allocated by the mfd core
    
    commit b9fbb62eb61452d728c39b2e5020739c575aac53 upstream.
    
    mfd_remove_devices would iterate over all devices sharing a parent with
    an mfd device regardless of whether they were allocated by the mfd core
    or not. This especially caused problems when the device structure was
    not contained within a platform_device, because to_platform_device is
    used on each device pointer.
    
    This patch defines a device_type for mfd devices and checks this is
    present from mfd_remove_devices_fn before processing the device.

    commit e1fe2060d7e8f58a69374135e32e90f0bb79a7fd upstream.
    
    If the TPG memory is allocated successfully, but we fail further along
    in the function, a dangling pointer to freed memory is left in the TPort
    structure. This is mostly harmless, but does prevent re-trying the
    operation without first removing the TPort altogether.

    target/tcm_fc: fix the lockdep warning due to inconsistent lock state
    
    commit 9f4ad44b264f8bb61ffdd607148215566568430d upstream.
    
    The lockdep warning below is in theory correct but it will be in really weird
    rare situation that ends up that deadlock since the tcm fc session is hashed
    based the rport id. Nonetheless, the complaining below is about rcu callback
    that does the transport_deregister_session() is happening in softirq, where
    transport_register_session() that happens earlier is not. This triggers the
    lockdep warning below. So, just fix this to make lockdep happy by disabling
    the soft irq before calling transport_register_session() in ft_prli.
    
    BTW, this was found in FCoE VN2VN over two VMs, couple of create and destroy
    would get this triggered.
    
    v1: was enforcing register to be in softirq context which was not righ. See,
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/target-devel/msg03614.html
    
    v2: following comments from Roland&Nick (thanks), it seems we don't have to
    do transport_deregister_session() in rcu callback, so move it into ft_sess_free()
    but still do kfree() of the corresponding ft_sess struct in rcu callback to
    make sure the ft_sess is not freed till the rcu callback.

    This patch changes vectored file I/O to use kmap + kunmap when mapping
    incoming SGL memory -> struct iovec in order to properly support 32-bit
    highmem configurations.  This is because an extra bounce buffer may be
    required when processing scatterlist pages allocated with GFP_KERNEL.

    libata: set dma_mode to 0xff in reset
    
    commit 5416912af75de9cba5d1c75b99a7888b0bbbd2fb upstream.
    
    ata_device->dma_mode's initial value is zero, which is not a valid dma
    mode, but ata_dma_enabled will return true for this value. This patch
    sets dma_mode to 0xff in reset function, so that ata_dma_enabled will
    not return true for this case, or it will cause problem for pata_acpi.

    pstore/ram: Fix undefined usage of rounddown_pow_of_two(0)
    
    commit b042e47491ba5f487601b5141a3f1d8582304170 upstream.
    
    record_size / console_size / ftrace_size can be 0 (this is how you disable
    the feature), but rounddown_pow_of_two(0) is undefined. As suggested by
    Kees Cook, use !is_power_of_2() as a condition to call
    rounddown_pow_of_two and avoid its undefined behavior on the value 0. This
    issue has been present since commit 1894a253 (ramoops: Move to
    fs/pstore/ram.c).

    The slave_state_lock spinlock is used in both interrupt context and

    IB/mlx4: Fix spinlock order to avoid lockdep warnings
    
    commit ceb7decb366591e9b67d70832e07f5d240572a3d upstream.
    
    lockdep warns about taking a hard-irq-unsafe lock (sriov->id_map_lock)
    inside a hard-irq-safe lock (sriov->going_down_lock).
    
    Since id_map_lock is never taken in the interrupt context, we can
    simply reverse the order of taking the two spinlocks, thus avoiding
    the warning and the depencency.

    sony-laptop: fix SNC buffer calls when SN06 returns Integers
    
    commit dcbeec264d73b7228ffdfe767eab69b2353099b1 upstream.
    
    SN06 in some cases returns an Integer instead of a buffer. While the
    code handling the return value was trying to cope with the difference,
    the memcpy call was not making any difference between the two types of
    acpi_object union. This regression was introduced in 3.5.
    While there also rework the return value logic to improve readability.

    sata_promise: fix hardreset lockdep error
    
    commit 3100d49d3cd236443faae9d81137c81b22d36003 upstream.
    
    sata_promise's pdc_hard_reset_port() needs to serialize because it
    flips a port-specific bit in controller register that's shared by
    all ports. The code takes the ata host lock for this, but that's
    broken because an interrupt may arrive on our irq during the hard
    reset sequence, and that too will take the ata host lock. With
    lockdep enabled a big nasty warning is seen.
    
    Fixed by adding private state to the ata host structure, containing
    a second lock used only for serializing the hard reset sequences.
    This eliminated the lockdep warnings both on my test rig and on
    the original reporter's machine.

    SCSI: qla2xxx: Test and clear FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED atomically.
    
    commit a394aac88506159e047630fc90dc2242568382d8 upstream.
    
    When the qla2xxx driver loses access to multiple, remote ports, there is a race
    condition which can occur which will keep the request stuck on a scsi request
    queue indefinitely.
    
    This bad state occurred do to a race condition with how the FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED
    bit is set in qla2x00_schedule_rport_del(), and how it is cleared in
    qla2x00_do_dpc().  The problem port has its drport pointer set, but it has never
    been processed by the driver to inform the fc transport that the port has been
    lost.  qla2x00_schedule_rport_del() sets drport, and then sets the
    FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED bit.  In qla2x00_do_dpc(), the port lists are walked and
    any drport pointer is handled and the fc transport informed of the port loss,
    then the FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED bit is cleared.  This leaves a race where the
    dpc thread is processing one port removal, another port removal is marked
    with a call to qla2x00_schedule_rport_del(), and the dpc thread clears the
    bit for both removals, even though only the first removal was actually
    handled.  Until another event occurs to set FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED, the later
    port removal is never finished and qla2xxx stays in a bad state which causes
    requests to become stuck on request queues.
    
    This patch updates the driver to test and clear FCPORT_UPDATE_NEEDED
    atomically.  This ensures the port state changes are processed and not lost.

    SCSI: prevent stack buffer overflow in host_reset
    
    commit 072f19b4bea31cdd482d79f805413f2f9ac9e233 upstream.
    
    store_host_reset() has tried to re-invent the wheel to compare sysfs strings.
    Unfortunately it did so poorly and never bothered to check the input from
    userspace before overwriting stack with it, so something simple as:
    
    echo "WoopsieWoopsie" >
    /sys/devices/pseudo_0/adapter0/host0/scsi_host/host0/host_reset
    
    would result in:

    SCSI: mvsas: fix undefined bit shift
    
    commit beecadea1b8d67f591b13f7099559f32f3fd601d upstream.
    
    The macro bit(n) is defined as ((u32)1 << n), and thus it doesn't work
    with n >= 32, such as in mvs_94xx_assign_reg_set():
    
            if (i >= 32) {
                    mvi->sata_reg_set |= bit(i);
                    ...
            }
    
    The shift ((u32)1 << n) with n >= 32 also leads to undefined behavior.
    The result varies depending on the architecture.
    
    This patch changes bit(n) to do a 64-bit shift.  It also simplifies
    mv_ffc64() using __ffs64(), since invoking ffz() with ~0 is undefined.

    watchdog: Fix disable/enable regression
    
    commit 3935e89505a1c3ab3f3b0c7ef0eae54124f48905 upstream.
    
    Commit 8d4516904b39 ("watchdog: Fix CPU hotplug regression") causes an
    oops or hard lockup when doing
    
     echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
     echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
    
    and the kernel is booted with nmi_watchdog=1 (default)
    
    Running laptop-mode-tools and disconnecting/connecting AC power will
    cause this to trigger, making it a common failure scenario on laptops.
    
    Instead of bailing out of watchdog_disable() when !watchdog_enabled we
    can initialize the hrtimer regardless of watchdog_enabled status.  This
    makes it safe to call watchdog_disable() in the nmi_watchdog=0 case,
    without the negative effect on the enabled => disabled => enabled case.
    
    All these tests pass with this patch:
    - nmi_watchdog=1
      echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
      echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
    
    - nmi_watchdog=0
      echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
    
    - nmi_watchdog=0

    firewire: net: Fix handling of fragmented multicast/broadcast packets.
    
    commit 9d2373420900a39f5212a3b289331aa3535b1000 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes both the transmit and receive portion of sending
    fragmented mutlicast and broadcast packets.
    
    The transmit section was broken because the offset for INTFRAG and
    LASTFRAG packets were just miscalculated by IEEE1394_GASP_HDR_SIZE (which
    was reserved with skb_push() in fwnet_send_packet).
    
    The receive section was broken because in fwnet_incoming_packet is a call
    to fwnet_peer_find_by_node_id(). Called with generation == -1 it will

    [Stefan R:  The fix to use context->card->generation is not perfect.
    It relies on the IR tasklet which processes packets from the prior bus
    generation to run before the self-ID-complete worklet which sets the
    current card generation.  Alas, there is no simple way of a race-free
    implementation.  Let's do it this way for now.]

    carl9170: fix -EINVAL bailout during init with !CONFIG_MAC80211_MESH
    
    commit 6c653f66772c39c5e25db715bbd4730596fccd9e upstream.
    
    Sean reported that as of 3.7, his AR9170 device no longer works
    because the driver fails during initialization. He noted this
    is due to:
    "In carl9170/fw.c, ar->hw->wiphy is tagged with
    NL80211_IFTYPE_MESH_POINT support if the firmware has Content
    after Beacon Queuing. This is both in interface_modes and the
    only iface_combinations entry.
    
    If CONFIG_MAC80211_MESH is not set, ieee80211_register_hw
    removes NL80211_IFTYPE_MESH_POINT from interface_modes, but
    not iface_combinations.
    
    wiphy_register then checks to see if every interface type in
    every interface combination is in interface_modes.
    NL80211_IFTYPE_MESH_POINT was removed, so you get a WARN_ON
    warning and it returns -EINVAL, giving up."
    
    Unfortunately, the iface_combination (types) feature bitmap
    in ieee80211_iface_limit is part of a const member in the
    ieee80211_iface_combination struct. Hence, the MESH_POINT
    feature flag can't be masked by wiphy_register in the
    same way as interface_modes in ieee80211_register_hw.

    mac80211: introduce IEEE80211_HW_TEARDOWN_AGGR_ON_BAR_FAIL
    
    commit 5b632fe85ec82e5c43740b52e74c66df50a37db3 upstream.
    
    Commit f0425beda4d404a6e751439b562100b902ba9c98 "mac80211: retry sending
    failed BAR frames later instead of tearing down aggr" caused regression
    on rt2x00 hardware (connection hangs). This regression was fixed by
    commit be03d4a45c09ee5100d3aaaedd087f19bc20d01 "rt2x00: Don't let
    mac80211 send a BAR when an AMPDU subframe fails". But the latter
    commit caused yet another problem reported in
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42828#c22
    
    After long discussion in this thread:
    http://mid.gmane.org/20121018075615.GA18212@redhat.com
    and testing various alternative solutions, which failed on one or other
    setup, we have no other good fix for the issues like just revert both
    mentioned earlier commits.
    
    To do not affect other hardware which benefit from commit
    f0425beda4d404a6e751439b562100b902ba9c98, instead of reverting it,
    introduce flag that when used will restore mac80211 behaviour before
    the commit.

    ath9k_hw: Fix signal strength / channel noise reporting
    
    commit b7c0c238898d200e80487516e2b67aba2a522cc0 upstream.
    
    While AR_PHY_CCA_NOM_VAL_* does contain the expected internal noise floor
    for a chip measured in clean air, it refers to the lowest expected reading.
    
    Depending on the frequency, this measurement can vary by about 6db, thus
    causing a higher reported channel noise and signal strength.
    
    Factor in the 6db offset when converting internal noisefloor to channel noise.
    
    This patch makes the reported values more accurate for all chips without
    affecting NF calibration behavior.

    mm: bootmem: fix free_all_bootmem_core() with odd bitmap alignment
    
    commit 10d73e655cef6e86ea8589dca3df4e495e4900b0 upstream.
    
    Currently free_all_bootmem_core ignores that node_min_pfn may be not
    multiple of BITS_PER_LONG.  Eg commit 6dccdcbe2c3e ("mm: bootmem: fix
    checking the bitmap when finally freeing bootmem") shifts vec by lower
    bits of start instead of lower bits of idx.  Also
    
      if (IS_ALIGNED(start, BITS_PER_LONG) && vec == ~0UL)
    
    assumes that vec bit 0 corresponds to start pfn, which is only true when
    node_min_pfn is a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG.  Also loop in the else
    clause can double-free pages (e.g.  with node_min_pfn == start == 1,
    map[0] == ~0 on 32-bit machine page 32 will be double-freed).
    
    This bug causes the following message during xtensa kernel boot:
    
      bootmem::free_all_bootmem_core nid=0 start=1 end=8000
      BUG: Bad page state in process swapper  pfn:00001

        should_never_return+0x0/0x3be7
    
    The fix is the following:
     - always align vec so that its bit 0 corresponds to start
     - provide BITS_PER_LONG bits in vec, if those bits are available in the
       map
     - don't free pages past next start position in the else clause.

    mm: use aligned zone start for pfn_to_bitidx calculation
    
    commit c060f943d0929f3e429c5d9522290584f6281d6e upstream.
    
    The current calculation in pfn_to_bitidx assumes that (pfn -
    zone->zone_start_pfn) >> pageblock_order will return the same bit for
    all pfn in a pageblock.  If zone_start_pfn is not aligned to
    pageblock_nr_pages, this may not always be correct.
    
    Consider the following with pageblock order = 10, zone start 2MB:
    
      pfn     | pfn - zone start | (pfn - zone start) >> page block order
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      0x26000 | 0x25e00        |  0x97
      0x26100 | 0x25f00        |  0x97
      0x26200 | 0x26000        |  0x98
      0x26300 | 0x26100        |  0x98
    
    This means that calling {get,set}_pageblock_migratetype on a single page
    will not set the migratetype for the full block.  Fix this by rounding
    down zone_start_pfn when doing the bitidx calculation.
    
    For our use case, the effects of this bug were mostly tied to the fact
    that CMA allocations would either take a long time or fail to happen.
    Depending on the driver using CMA, this could result in anything from
    visual glitches to application failures.

    mm: compaction: fix echo 1 > compact_memory return error issue
    
    commit 7964c06d66c76507d8b6b662bffea770c29ef0ce upstream.
    
    when run the folloing command under shell, it will return error
    
      sh/$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory
      sh/$ sh: write error: Bad address
    
    After strace, I found the following log:
    
      ...
      write(1, "1\n", 2)               = 3
      write(1, "", 4294967295)         = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
      write(2, "echo: write error: Bad address\n", 31echo: write error: Bad address
      ) = 31
    
    This tells system return 3(COMPACT_COMPLETE) after write data to
    compact_memory.
    
    The fix is to make the system just return 0 instead 3(COMPACT_COMPLETE)
    from sysctl_compaction_handler after compaction_nodes finished.

    MIPS: Fix poweroff failure when HOTPLUG_CPU configured.
    
    commit 8add1ecb81f541ef2fcb0b85a5470ad9ecfb4a84 upstream.
    
    When poweroff machine, kernel_power_off() call disable_nonboot_cpus().
    And if we have HOTPLUG_CPU configured, disable_nonboot_cpus() is not an
    empty function but attempt to actually disable the nonboot cpus. Since
    system state is SYSTEM_POWER_OFF, play_dead() won't be called and thus
    disable_nonboot_cpus() hangs. Therefore, we make this patch to avoid
    poweroff failure.

    s390/cio: fix pgid reserved check
    
    commit d99e79ec5574fc556c988f613ed6175f6de66f4a upstream.
    
    The check to whom a device is reserved is done by checking the path
    state of the affected channel paths. If it turns out that one path is
    flagged as reserved by someone else the whole device is marked as such.
    
    However the meaning of the RESVD_ELSE bit is that the addressed device
    is reserved to a different pathgroup (and not reserved to a different
    LPAR). If we do this test on a path which is currently not a member of
    the pathgroup we could erroneously mark the device as reserved to
    someone else.
    
    To fix this collect the reserved state for all potential members of the

    KVM: Fix user memslot overlap check
    
    commit 5419369ed6bd4cf711fdda5e52a5999b940413f5 upstream.
    
    Prior to memory slot sorting this loop compared all of the user memory
    slots for overlap with new entries.  With memory slot sorting, we're
    just checking some number of entries in the array that may or may not
    be user slots.  Instead, walk all the slots with kvm_for_each_memslot,
    which has the added benefit of terminating early when we hit the first
    empty slot, and skip comparison to private slots.

    commit e6449c9b2d90c1bd9a5985bf05ddebfd1631cd6b upstream.

    (sections: fix section conflicts in arch/powerpc), however the root
    cause of this is that the NULL terminator were not added in commit

    powerpc/vdso: Remove redundant locking in update_vsyscall_tz()
    
    commit ce73ec6db47af84d1466402781ae0872a9e7873c upstream.
    
    The locking in update_vsyscall_tz() is not only unnecessary because the vdso
    code copies the data unproteced in __kernel_gettimeofday() but also
    introduces a hard to reproduce race condition between update_vsyscall()
    and update_vsyscall_tz(), which causes user space process to loop
    forever in vdso code.
    
    The following patch removes the locking from update_vsyscall_tz().
    
    Locking is not only unnecessary because the vdso code copies the data
    unprotected in __kernel_gettimeofday() but also erroneous because updating
    the tb_update_count is not atomic and introduces a hard to reproduce race
    condition between update_vsyscall() and update_vsyscall_tz(), which further
    causes user space process to loop forever in vdso code.
    
    The below scenario describes the race condition,
    x==0    Boot CPU                        other CPU
            proc_P: x==0
                timer interrupt
                    update_vsyscall
    x==1                x++;sync            settimeofday
                                                update_vsyscall_tz
    x==2                                            x++;sync
    x==3                sync;x++
                                                    sync;x++
            proc_P: x==3 (loops until x becomes even)
    
    Because the ++ operator would be implemented as three instructions and not
    atomic on powerpc.
    
    A similar change was made for x86 in commit 6c260d58634
    ("x86: vdso: Remove bogus locking in update_vsyscall_tz")

    s390/kvm: Fix address space mixup
    
    commit ce6a04ac1b759beafc88dbc443ae5da867579eeb upstream.
    
    I was chasing down a bug of random validity intercepts on s390.
    (guest prefix page not mapped in the host virtual aspace). Turns out
    that the problem was a wrong address space control element. The
    cause was quite complex:
    
    During paging activity a DAT protection during SIE caused a program
    interrupt. Normally, the sie retry loop tries to catch all
    interrupts during and shortly before sie to rerun the setup. The
    problem is now that protection causes a suppressing program interrupt,
    causing the PSW to point to the instruction AFTER SIE in case of DAT
    protection. This confused the logic of the retry loop to not trigger,
    instead we jumped directly back to SIE after return from
    the program  interrupt. (the protection fault handler itself did
    a rewind of the psw). This usually works quite well, but:
    
    If now the protection fault handler has to wait, another program
    might be scheduled in. Later on the sie process will be schedules
    in again. In that case the content of CR1 (primary address space)
    will be wrong because switch_to will put the user space ASCE into CR1
    and not the guest ASCE.
    
    In addition the program parameter is also wrong for every protection
    fault of a guest, since we dont issue the SPP instruction.
    
    So lets also check for PSW == instruction after SIE in the program
    check handler. Instead of expensively checking all program
    interruption codes that might be suppressing we assume that a program
    interrupt pointing after SIE was always a program interrupt in SIE.
    (Otherwise we have a kernel bug anyway).
    
    We also have to compensate the rewinding, since the C-level handlers
    will do that. Therefore we need to add a nop with the same length
    as SIE before the sie_loop.

    s390/kvm: dont announce RRBM support
    
    commit 87cac8f879a5ecd7109dbe688087e8810b3364eb upstream.
    
    Newer kernels (linux-next with the transparent huge page patches)
    use rrbm if the feature is announced via feature bit 66.
    RRBM will cause intercepts, so KVM does not handle it right now,
    causing an illegal instruction in the guest.
    The  easy solution is to disable the feature bit for the guest.
    
    This fixes bugs like:

    iwlwifi: silently ignore fw flaws in Tx path
    
    commit 27edb1accf5695ff00a32c85c4a00ac7e1e7f298 upstream.
    
    We know that we have issues with the fw in the reclaim path.
    This is why iwl_reclaim doesn't complain too loud when it
    happens since it is recoverable. Somehow, the caller of
    iwl_reclaim however WARNed when it happens. This doesn't
    make any sense.
    
    When I digged into the history of that code, I discovered
    that this bug occurs only when we receive a BA notification.
    So move the W/A in the BA notification handling code where
    it was before.

    iwlwifi: don't handle masked interrupt
    
    commit 25a172655f837bdb032e451f95441bb4acec51bb upstream.
    
    This can lead to a panic if the driver isn't ready to
    handle them. Since our interrupt line is shared, we can get
    an interrupt at any time (and CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ checks
    that even when the interrupt is being freed).
    
    If the op_mode has gone away, we musn't call it. To avoid
    this the transport disables the interrupts when the hw is
    stopped and the op_mode is leaving.
    If there is an event that would cause an interrupt the INTA
    register is updated regardless of the enablement of the
    interrupts: even if the interrupts are disabled, the INTA
    will be changed, but the device won't issue an interrupt.
    But the ISR can be called at any time, so we ought ignore
    the value in the INTA otherwise we can call the op_mode
    after it was freed.
    
    I found this bug when the op_mode_start failed, and called
    iwl_trans_stop_hw(trans, true). Then I played with the
    RFKILL button, and removed the module.
    While removing the module, the IRQ is freed, and the ISR is
    called (CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled). Panic.
