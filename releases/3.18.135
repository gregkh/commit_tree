    pinctrl: msm: fix gpio-hog related boot issues
    
    commit a86caa9ba5d70696ceb35d1d39caa20d8b641387 upstream.
    
    Sven Eckelmann reported an issue with the current IPQ4019 pinctrl.
    Setting up any gpio-hog in the device-tree for his device would
    "kill the bootup completely":
    
    | [    0.477838] msm_serial 78af000.serial: could not find pctldev for node /soc/pinctrl@1000000/serial_pinmux, deferring probe
    | [    0.499828] spi_qup 78b5000.spi: could not find pctldev for node /soc/pinctrl@1000000/spi_0_pinmux, deferring probe
    | [    1.298883] requesting hog GPIO enable USB2 power (chip 1000000.pinctrl, offset 58) failed, -517
    | [    1.299609] gpiochip_add_data: GPIOs 0..99 (1000000.pinctrl) failed to register
    | [    1.308589] ipq4019-pinctrl 1000000.pinctrl: Failed register gpiochip
    | [    1.316586] msm_serial 78af000.serial: could not find pctldev for node /soc/pinctrl@1000000/serial_pinmux, deferring probe
    | [    1.322415] spi_qup 78b5000.spi: could not find pctldev for node /soc/pinctrl@1000000/spi_0_pinmux, deferri
    
    This was also verified on a RT-AC58U (IPQ4018) which would
    no longer boot, if a gpio-hog was specified. (Tried forcing
    the USB LED PIN (GPIO0) to high.).
    
    The problem is that Pinctrl+GPIO registration is currently
    peformed in the following order in pinctrl-msm.c:
            1. pinctrl_register()
            2. gpiochip_add()
            3. gpiochip_add_pin_range()
    
    The actual error code -517 == -EPROBE_DEFER is coming from
    pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range(), which is called through:
            gpiochip_add
                of_gpiochip_add
                    of_gpiochip_scan_gpios
                        gpiod_hog
                            gpiochip_request_own_desc
                                __gpiod_request
                                    chip->request
                                        gpiochip_generic_request
                                           pinctrl_gpio_request
                                              pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range
    
    pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range() is unable to find any valid
    pin ranges, since nothing has been added to the pinctrldev_list yet.
    so the range can't be found, and the operation fails with -EPROBE_DEFER.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by adding the "gpio-ranges" property to
    the pinctrl device node of all upstream Qcom SoC. The pin ranges are
    then added by the gpio core.
    
    In order to remain compatible with older, existing DTs (and ACPI)
    a check for the "gpio-ranges" property has been added to
    msm_gpio_init(). This prevents the driver of adding the same entry
    to the pinctrldev_list twice.

    dump_thread32() in aout_core_dump() does not clear the user32 structure
    allocated on the stack as the first thing on function entry.
    
    As a result, the dump.u_comm, dump.u_ar0 and dump.signal which get
    assigned before the clearing, get overwritten.
    
    Rename that function to fill_dump() to make it clear what it does and
    call it first thing.

    signal: Restore the stop PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT
    
    commit cf43a757fd49442bc38f76088b70c2299eed2c2f upstream.
    
    In the middle of do_exit() there is there is a call
    "ptrace_event(PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT, code);" That call places the process
    in TACKED_TRACED aka "(TASK_WAKEKILL | __TASK_TRACED)" and waits for
    for the debugger to release the task or SIGKILL to be delivered.
    
    Skipping past dequeue_signal when we know a fatal signal has already
    been delivered resulted in SIGKILL remaining pending and
    TIF_SIGPENDING remaining set.  This in turn caused the
    scheduler to not sleep in PTACE_EVENT_EXIT as it figured
    a fatal signal was pending.  This also caused ptrace_freeze_traced
    in ptrace_check_attach to fail because it left a per thread
    SIGKILL pending which is what fatal_signal_pending tests for.
    
    This difference in signal state caused strace to report
    strace: Exit of unknown pid NNNNN ignored
    
    Therefore update the signal handling state like dequeue_signal
    would when removing a per thread SIGKILL, by removing SIGKILL
    from the per thread signal mask and clearing TIF_SIGPENDING.

    tracing/uprobes: Fix output for multiple string arguments
    
    commit 0722069a5374b904ec1a67f91249f90e1cfae259 upstream.
    
    When printing multiple uprobe arguments as strings the output for the
    earlier arguments would also include all later string arguments.
    
    This is best explained in an example:
    
    Consider adding a uprobe to a function receiving two strings as
    parameters which is at offset 0xa0 in strlib.so and we want to print
    both parameters when the uprobe is hit (on x86_64):
    
    $ echo 'p:func /lib/strlib.so:0xa0 +0(%di):string +0(%si):string' > \
        /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events
    
    When the function is called as func("foo", "bar") and we hit the probe,
    the trace file shows a line like the following:
    
      [...] func: (0x7f7e683706a0) arg1="foobar" arg2="bar"
    
    Note the extra "bar" printed as part of arg1. This behaviour stacks up
    for additional string arguments.
    
    The strings are stored in a dynamically growing part of the uprobe
    buffer by fetch_store_string() after copying them from userspace via
    strncpy_from_user(). The return value of strncpy_from_user() is then
    directly used as the required size for the string. However, this does
    not take the terminating null byte into account as the documentation
    for strncpy_from_user() cleary states that it "[...] returns the
    length of the string (not including the trailing NUL)" even though the
    null byte will be copied to the destination.
    
    Therefore, subsequent calls to fetch_store_string() will overwrite
    the terminating null byte of the most recently fetched string with
    the first character of the current string, leading to the
    "accumulation" of strings in earlier arguments in the output.
    
    Fix this by incrementing the return value of strncpy_from_user() by
    one if we did not hit the maximum buffer size.

    alpha: Fix Eiger NR_IRQS to 128
    
    commit bfc913682464f45bc4d6044084e370f9048de9d5 upstream.
    
    Eiger machine vector definition has nr_irqs 128, and working 2.6.26
    boot shows SCSI getting IRQ-s 64 and 65. Current kernel boot fails
    because Symbios SCSI fails to request IRQ-s and does not find the disks.
    It has been broken at least since 3.18 - the earliest I could test with
    my gcc-5.
    
    The headers have moved around and possibly another order of defines has
    worked in the past - but since 128 seems to be correct and used, fix
    arch/alpha/include/asm/irq.h to have NR_IRQS=128 for Eiger.
    
    This fixes 4.19-rc7 boot on my Force Flexor A264 (Eiger subarch).

    alpha: fix page fault handling for r16-r18 targets
    
    commit 491af60ffb848b59e82f7c9145833222e0bf27a5 upstream.
    
    Fix page fault handling code to fixup r16-r18 registers.
    Before the patch code had off-by-two registers bug.
    This bug caused overwriting of ps,pc,gp registers instead
    of fixing intended r16,r17,r18 (see `struct pt_regs`).
    
    More details:
    
    Initially Dmitry noticed a kernel bug as a failure
    on strace test suite. Test passes unmapped userspace
    pointer to io_submit:
    
    ```c
        #include <err.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <sys/mman.h>
        #include <asm/unistd.h>
        int main(void)
        {
            unsigned long ctx = 0;
            if (syscall(__NR_io_setup, 1, &ctx))
                err(1, "io_setup");
            const size_t page_size = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
            const size_t size = page_size * 2;
            void *ptr = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                             MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
            if (MAP_FAILED == ptr)
                err(1, "mmap(%zu)", size);
            if (munmap(ptr, size))
                err(1, "munmap");
            syscall(__NR_io_submit, ctx, 1, ptr + page_size);
            syscall(__NR_io_destroy, ctx);
            return 0;
        }
    ```
    
    Running this test causes kernel to crash when handling page fault:
    
    ```

        Trace:
        [<fffffc0000311404>] entSys+0xa4/0xc0
    ```
    
    Here `gp` has invalid value. `gp is s overwritten by a fixup for the
    following page fault handler in `io_submit` syscall handler:
    
    ```
        __se_sys_io_submit
        ...
            ldq     a1,0(t1)
            bne     t0,4280 <__se_sys_io_submit+0x180>
    ```
    
    After a page fault `t0` should contain -EFALUT and `a1` is 0.
    Instead `gp` was overwritten in place of `a1`.
    
    This happens due to a off-by-two bug in `dpf_reg()` for `r16-r18`
    (aka `a0-a2`).
    
    I think the bug went unnoticed for a long time as `gp` is one
    of scratch registers. Any kernel function call would re-calculate `gp`.
    
    Dmitry tracked down the bug origin back to 2.1.32 kernel version
    where trap_a{0,1,2} fields were inserted into struct pt_regs.
    And even before that `dpf_reg()` contained off-by-one error.

    Input: bma150 - register input device after setting private data
    
    commit 90cc55f067f6ca0e64e5e52883ece47d8af7b67b upstream.
    
    Otherwise we introduce a race condition where userspace can request input
    before we're ready leading to null pointer dereference such as
    
    input: bma150 as /devices/platform/i2c-gpio-2/i2c-5/5-0038/input/input3
    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000018

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix implicit fb endpoint setup by quirk
    
    commit 2bc16b9f3223d049b57202ee702fcb5b9b507019 upstream.
    
    The commit a60945fd08e4 ("ALSA: usb-audio: move implicit fb quirks to
    separate function") introduced an error in the handling of quirks for
    implicit feedback endpoints. This commit fixes this.
    
    If a quirk successfully sets up an implicit feedback endpoint, usb-audio
    no longer tries to find the implicit fb endpoint itself.

    perf/core: Fix impossible ring-buffer sizes warning
    
    commit 528871b456026e6127d95b1b2bd8e3a003dc1614 upstream.
    
    The following commit:
    
      9dff0aa95a32 ("perf/core: Don't WARN() for impossible ring-buffer sizes")
    
    results in perf recording failures with larger mmap areas:
    
      root@skl:/tmp# perf record -g -a
      failed to mmap with 12 (Cannot allocate memory)
    
    The root cause is that the following condition is buggy:
    
            if (order_base_2(size) >= MAX_ORDER)
                    goto fail;
    
    The problem is that @size is in bytes and MAX_ORDER is in pages,
    so the right test is:
    
            if (order_base_2(size) >= PAGE_SHIFT+MAX_ORDER)
                    goto fail;
    
    Fix it.

    cifs: Limit memory used by lock request calls to a page
    
    [ Upstream commit 92a8109e4d3a34fb6b115c9098b51767dc933444 ]
    
    The code tries to allocate a contiguous buffer with a size supplied by
    the server (maxBuf). This could fail if memory is fragmented since it
    results in high order allocations for commonly used server
    implementations. It is also wasteful since there are probably
    few locks in the usual case. Limit the buffer to be no larger than a
    page to avoid memory allocation failures due to fragmentation.

    gpio: pl061: handle failed allocations
    
    [ Upstream commit df209c43a0e8258e096fb722dfbdae4f0dd13fde ]
    
    devm_kzalloc(), devm_kstrdup() and devm_kasprintf() all can
    fail internal allocation and return NULL. Using any of the assigned
    objects without checking is not safe. As this is early in the boot
    phase and these allocations really should not fail, any failure here
    is probably an indication of a more serious issue so it makes little
    sense to try and rollback the previous allocated resources or try to
    continue;  but rather the probe function is simply exited with -ENOMEM.

    It turns out that people do actually depend on the shebang string being

    just re-interpret it entirely to get the full argument list.

    batman-adv: Force mac header to start of data on xmit
    
    commit 9114daa825fc3f335f9bea3313ce667090187280 upstream.
    
    The caller of ndo_start_xmit may not already have called
    skb_reset_mac_header. The returned value of skb_mac_header/eth_hdr
    therefore can be in the wrong position and even outside the current skbuff.
    This for example happens when the user binds to the device using a
    PF_PACKET-SOCK_RAW with enabled qdisc-bypass:
    
      int opt = 4;
      setsockopt(sock, SOL_PACKET, PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, &opt, sizeof(opt));
    
    Since eth_hdr is used all over the codebase, the batadv_interface_tx
    function must always take care of resetting it.

    batman-adv: Avoid WARN on net_device without parent in netns
    
    commit 955d3411a17f590364238bd0d3329b61f20c1cd2 upstream.
    
    It is not allowed to use WARN* helpers on potential incorrect input from
    the user or transient problems because systems configured as panic_on_warn
    will reboot due to such a problem.
    
    A NULL return value of __dev_get_by_index can be caused by various problems
    which can either be related to the system configuration or problems
    (incorrectly returned network namespaces) in other (virtual) net_device
    drivers. batman-adv should not cause a (harmful) WARN in this situation and
    instead only report it via a simple message.

    xfrm: refine validation of template and selector families
    
    commit 35e6103861a3a970de6c84688c6e7a1f65b164ca upstream.
    
    The check assumes that in transport mode, the first templates family
    must match the address family of the policy selector.
    
    Syzkaller managed to build a template using MODE_ROUTEOPTIMIZATION,
    with ipv4-in-ipv6 chain, leading to following splat:
    
    BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in xfrm_state_find+0x1db/0x1854
    Read of size 4 at addr ffff888063e57aa0 by task a.out/2050
     xfrm_state_find+0x1db/0x1854
     xfrm_tmpl_resolve+0x100/0x1d0
     xfrm_resolve_and_create_bundle+0x108/0x1000 [..]
    
    Problem is that addresses point into flowi4 struct, but xfrm_state_find
    treats them as being ipv6 because it uses templ->encap_family is used
    (AF_INET6 in case of reproducer) rather than family (AF_INET).
    
    This patch inverts the logic: Enforce 'template family must match
    selector' EXCEPT for tunnel and BEET mode.
    
    In BEET and Tunnel mode, xfrm_tmpl_resolve_one will have remote/local
    address pointers changed to point at the addresses found in the template,
    rather than the flowi ones, so no oob read will occur.

                                    con_fault()

                                        set state to STANDBY
                                      ...
                                    mutex_unlock(&con->mutex)
      set KEEPALIVE_PENDING
      set WRITE_PENDING
    
    This triggers warnings in clear_standby() when either ceph_con_send()
    or ceph_con_keepalive() get to clearing STANDBY next time.
    
    I don't see a reason to condition queue_con() call on the previous
    value of KEEPALIVE_PENDING, so move the setting of KEEPALIVE_PENDING
    into the critical section -- unlike WRITE_PENDING, KEEPALIVE_PENDING
    could have been a non-atomic flag.

    HID: debug: fix the ring buffer implementation
    
    commit 13054abbaa4f1fd4e6f3b4b63439ec033b4c8035 upstream.
    
    Ring buffer implementation in hid_debug_event() and hid_debug_events_read()
    is strange allowing lost or corrupted data. After commit 717adfdaf147
    ("HID: debug: check length before copy_to_user()") it is possible to enter
    an infinite loop in hid_debug_events_read() by providing 0 as count, this
    locks up a system. Fix this by rewriting the ring buffer implementation
    with kfifo and simplify the code.
    
    This fixes CVE-2019-3819.
    
    v2: fix an execution logic and add a comment
    v3: use __set_current_state() instead of set_current_state()
    
    Backport to v3.18: some (tree-wide) patches are missing in v3.18 so
    cherry-pick relevant pieces from:
     * 6396bb221514 ("treewide: kzalloc() -> kcalloc()")

    drm/vmwgfx: Return error code from vmw_execbuf_copy_fence_user
    
    commit 728354c005c36eaf44b6e5552372b67e60d17f56 upstream.
    
    The function was unconditionally returning 0, and a caller would have to
    rely on the returned fence pointer being NULL to detect errors. However,
    the function vmw_execbuf_copy_fence_user() would expect a non-zero error
    code in that case and would BUG otherwise.
    
    So make sure we return a proper non-zero error code if the fence pointer
    returned is NULL.

    debugfs: fix debugfs_rename parameter checking
    
    commit d88c93f090f708c18195553b352b9f205e65418f upstream.
    
    debugfs_rename() needs to check that the dentries passed into it really
    are valid, as sometimes they are not (i.e. if the return value of
    another debugfs call is passed into this one.)  So fix this up by
    properly checking if the two parent directories are errors (they are
    allowed to be NULL), and if the dentry to rename is not NULL or an
    error.

    signal: Better detection of synchronous signals
    
    commit 7146db3317c67b517258cb5e1b08af387da0618b upstream.
    
    Recently syzkaller was able to create unkillablle processes by
    creating a timer that is delivered as a thread local signal on SIGHUP,
    and receiving SIGHUP SA_NODEFERER.  Ultimately causing a loop failing
    to deliver SIGHUP but always trying.
    
    When the stack overflows delivery of SIGHUP fails and force_sigsegv is
    called.  Unfortunately because SIGSEGV is numerically higher than
    SIGHUP next_signal tries again to deliver a SIGHUP.
    
    From a quality of implementation standpoint attempting to deliver the
    timer SIGHUP signal is wrong.  We should attempt to deliver the
    synchronous SIGSEGV signal we just forced.
    
    We can make that happening in a fairly straight forward manner by
    instead of just looking at the signal number we also look at the
    si_code.  In particular for exceptions (aka synchronous signals) the
    si_code is always greater than 0.
    
    That still has the potential to pick up a number of asynchronous
    signals as in a few cases the same si_codes that are used
    for synchronous signals are also used for asynchronous signals,
    and SI_KERNEL is also included in the list of possible si_codes.
    
    Still the heuristic is much better and timer signals are definitely
    excluded.  Which is enough to prevent all known ways for someone
    sending a process signals fast enough to cause unexpected and
    arguably incorrect behavior.

    and receiving SIGHUP SA_NODEFERER.  Ultimately causing a loop
    failing to deliver SIGHUP but always trying.
    
    Upon examination it turns out part of the problem is actually most of
    the solution.  Since 2.5 signal delivery has found all fatal signals,
    marked the signal group for death, and queued SIGKILL in every threads
    thread queue relying on signal->group_exit_code to preserve the
    information of which was the actual fatal signal.
    
    The conversion of all fatal signals to SIGKILL results in the
    synchronous signal heuristic in next_signal kicking in and preferring
    SIGHUP to SIGKILL.  Which is especially problematic as all
    fatal signals have already been transformed into SIGKILL.
    
    Instead of dequeueing signals and depending upon SIGKILL to
    be the first signal dequeued, first test if the signal group
    has already been marked for death.  This guarantees that
    nothing in the signal queue can prevent a process that needs
    to exit from exiting.

    mtd: rawnand: gpmi: fix MX28 bus master lockup problem
    
    commit d5d27fd9826b59979b184ec288e4812abac0e988 upstream.
    
    Disable BCH soft reset according to MX23 erratum #2847 ("BCH soft
    reset may cause bus master lock up") for MX28 too. It has the same
    problem.
    
    Observed problem: once per 100,000+ MX28 reboots NAND read failed on
    DMA timeout errors:
    [    1.770823] UBI: attaching mtd3 to ubi0
    [    2.768088] gpmi_nand: DMA timeout, last DMA :1
    [    3.958087] gpmi_nand: BCH timeout, last DMA :1
    [    4.156033] gpmi_nand: Error in ECC-based read: -110
    [    4.161136] UBI warning: ubi_io_read: error -110 while reading 64
    bytes from PEB 0:0, read only 0 bytes, retry
    [    4.171283] step 1 error
    [    4.173846] gpmi_nand: Chip: 0, Error -1
    
    Without BCH soft reset we successfully executed 1,000,000 MX28 reboots.
    
    I have a quote from NXP regarding this problem, from July 18th 2016:
    
    "As the i.MX23 and i.MX28 are of the same generation, they share many
    characteristics. Unfortunately, also the erratas may be shared.
    In case of the documented erratas and the workarounds, you can also
    apply the workaround solution of one device on the other one. This have
    been reported, but I’m afraid that there are not an estimated date for
    updating the Errata documents.
    Please accept our apologies for any inconveniences this may cause."

    perf/core: Don't WARN() for impossible ring-buffer sizes
    
    commit 9dff0aa95a324e262ffb03f425d00e4751f3294e upstream.
    
    The perf tool uses /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb to determine how
    large its ringbuffer mmap should be. This can be configured to arbitrary
    values, which can be larger than the maximum possible allocation from
    kmalloc.
    
    When this is configured to a suitably large value (e.g. thanks to the
    perf fuzzer), attempting to use perf record triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE() in
    __alloc_pages_nodemask():
    
       WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 5666 at mm/page_alloc.c:4511 __alloc_pages_nodemask+0x3f8/0xbc8
    
    Let's avoid this by checking that the requested allocation is possible
    before calling kzalloc.

    perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Node ID mask
    
    commit 9e63a7894fd302082cf3627fe90844421a6cbe7f upstream.
    
    Some PCI uncore PMUs cannot be registered on an 8-socket system (HPE
    Superdome Flex).
    
    To understand which Socket the PCI uncore PMUs belongs to, perf retrieves
    the local Node ID of the uncore device from CPUNODEID(0xC0) of the PCI
    configuration space, and the mapping between Socket ID and Node ID from
    GIDNIDMAP(0xD4). The Socket ID can be calculated accordingly.
    
    The local Node ID is only available at bit 2:0, but current code doesn't
    mask it. If a BIOS doesn't clear the rest of the bits, an incorrect Node ID
    will be fetched.
    
    Filter the Node ID by adding a mask.

    KVM: x86: work around leak of uninitialized stack contents (CVE-2019-7222)
    
    commit 353c0956a618a07ba4bbe7ad00ff29fe70e8412a upstream.
    
    Bugzilla: 1671930
    
    Emulation of certain instructions (VMXON, VMCLEAR, VMPTRLD, VMWRITE with
    memory operand, INVEPT, INVVPID) can incorrectly inject a page fault
    when passed an operand that points to an MMIO address.  The page fault
    will use uninitialized kernel stack memory as the CR2 and error code.
    
    The right behavior would be to abort the VM with a KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR
    exit to userspace; however, it is not an easy fix, so for now just
    ensure that the error code and CR2 are zero.

    dmaengine: imx-dma: fix wrong callback invoke
    
    commit 341198eda723c8c1cddbb006a89ad9e362502ea2 upstream.
    
    Once the "ld_queue" list is not empty, next descriptor will migrate
    into "ld_active" list. The "desc" variable will be overwritten
    during that transition. And later the dmaengine_desc_get_callback_invoke()
    will use it as an argument. As result we invoke wrong callback.
    
    That behaviour was in place since:
    commit fcaaba6c7136 ("dmaengine: imx-dma: fix callback path in tasklet").
    But after commit 4cd13c21b207 ("softirq: Let ksoftirqd do its job")
    things got worse, since possible delay between tasklet_schedule()
    from DMA irq handler and actual tasklet function execution got bigger.
    And that gave more time for new DMA request to be submitted and
    to be put into "ld_queue" list.
    
    It has been noticed that DMA issue is causing problems for "mxc-mmc"
    driver. While stressing the system with heavy network traffic and
    writing/reading to/from sd card simultaneously the timeout may happen:
    
    10013000.sdhci: mxcmci_watchdog: read time out (status = 0x30004900)
    
    That often lead to file system corruption.

    commit 9509941e9c534920ccc4771ae70bd6cbbe79df1c upstream.
    
    Some of the pipe_buf_release() handlers seem to assume that the pipe is
    locked - in particular, anon_pipe_buf_release() accesses pipe->tmp_page

    ALSA: compress: Fix stop handling on compressed capture streams
    
    commit 4f2ab5e1d13d6aa77c55f4914659784efd776eb4 upstream.
    
    It is normal user behaviour to start, stop, then start a stream
    again without closing it. Currently this works for compressed
    playback streams but not capture ones.
    
    The states on a compressed capture stream go directly from OPEN to
    PREPARED, unlike a playback stream which moves to SETUP and waits
    for a write of data before moving to PREPARED. Currently however,
    when a stop is sent the state is set to SETUP for both types of
    streams. This leaves a capture stream in the situation where a new
    start can't be sent as that requires the state to be PREPARED and
    a new set_params can't be sent as that requires the state to be
    OPEN. The only option being to close the stream, and then reopen.
    
    Correct this issues by allowing snd_compr_drain_notify to set the
    state depending on the stream direction, as we already do in
    set_params.

    net: dsa: slave: Don't propagate flag changes on down slave interfaces
    
    [ Upstream commit 17ab4f61b8cd6f9c38e9d0b935d86d73b5d0d2b5 ]
    
    The unbalance of master's promiscuity or allmulti will happen after ifdown
    and ifup a slave interface which is in a bridge.
    
    When we ifdown a slave interface , both the 'dsa_slave_close' and
    'dsa_slave_change_rx_flags' will clear the master's flags. The flags
    of master will be decrease twice.
    In the other hand, if we ifup the slave interface again, since the
    slave's flags were cleared the 'dsa_slave_open' won't set the master's
    flag, only 'dsa_slave_change_rx_flags' that triggered by 'br_add_if'
    will set the master's flags. The flags of master is increase once.
    
    Only propagating flag changes when a slave interface is up makes
    sure this does not happen. The 'vlan_dev_change_rx_flags' had the
    same problem and was fixed, and changes here follows that fix.

    net: systemport: Fix WoL with password after deep sleep
    
    [ Upstream commit 8dfb8d2cceb76b74ad5b58cc65c75994329b4d5e ]
    
    Broadcom STB chips support a deep sleep mode where all register
    contents are lost. Because we were stashing the MagicPacket password
    into some of these registers a suspend into that deep sleep then a
    resumption would not lead to being able to wake-up from MagicPacket with
    password again.
    
    Fix this by keeping a software copy of the password and program it
    during suspend.

    skge: potential memory corruption in skge_get_regs()
    
    [ Upstream commit 294c149a209c6196c2de85f512b52ef50f519949 ]
    
    The "p" buffer is 0x4000 bytes long.  B3_RI_WTO_R1 is 0x190.  The value
    of "regs->len" is in the 1-0x4000 range.  The bug here is that
    "regs->len - B3_RI_WTO_R1" can be a negative value which would lead to
    memory corruption and an abrupt crash.

    exec: load_script: don't blindly truncate shebang string
    
    [ Upstream commit 8099b047ecc431518b9bb6bdbba3549bbecdc343 ]
    
    load_script() simply truncates bprm->buf and this is very wrong if the
    length of shebang string exceeds BINPRM_BUF_SIZE-2.  This can silently
    truncate i_arg or (worse) we can execute the wrong binary if buf[2:126]
    happens to be the valid executable path.
    
    Change load_script() to return ENOEXEC if it can't find '\n' or zero in
    bprm->buf.  Note that '\0' can come from either
    prepare_binprm()->memset() or from kernel_read(), we do not care.

    fs/epoll: drop ovflist branch prediction
    
    [ Upstream commit 76699a67f3041ff4c7af6d6ee9be2bfbf1ffb671 ]
    
    The ep->ovflist is a secondary ready-list to temporarily store events
    that might occur when doing sproc without holding the ep->wq.lock.  This
    accounts for every time we check for ready events and also send events
    back to userspace; both callbacks, particularly the latter because of
    copy_to_user, can account for a non-trivial time.
    
    As such, the unlikely() check to see if the pointer is being used, seems
    both misleading and sub-optimal.  In fact, we go to an awful lot of
    trouble to sync both lists, and populating the ovflist is far from an
    uncommon scenario.
    
    For example, profiling a concurrent epoll_wait(2) benchmark, with
    CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES shows that for a two threads a 33%
    incorrect rate was seen; and when incrementally increasing the number of
    epoll instances (which is used, for example for multiple queuing load
    balancing models), up to a 90% incorrect rate was seen.
    
    Similarly, by deleting the prediction, 3% throughput boost was seen
    across incremental threads.

    kernel/hung_task.c: break RCU locks based on jiffies
    
    [ Upstream commit 304ae42739b108305f8d7b3eb3c1aec7c2b643a9 ]
    
    check_hung_uninterruptible_tasks() is currently calling rcu_lock_break()
    for every 1024 threads.  But check_hung_task() is very slow if printk()
    was called, and is very fast otherwise.
    
    If many threads within some 1024 threads called printk(), the RCU grace
    period might be extended enough to trigger RCU stall warnings.
    Therefore, calling rcu_lock_break() for every some fixed jiffies will be
    safer.

    This value doesn't get reset when the device is closed which means the

    gdrom: fix a memory leak bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 093c48213ee37c3c3ff1cf5ac1aa2a9d8bc66017 ]
    
    In probe_gdrom(), the buffer pointed by 'gd.cd_info' is allocated through
    kzalloc() and is used to hold the information of the gdrom device. To
    register and unregister the device, the pointer 'gd.cd_info' is passed to
    the functions register_cdrom() and unregister_cdrom(), respectively.
    However, this buffer is not freed after it is used, which can cause a
    memory leak bug.
    
    This patch simply frees the buffer 'gd.cd_info' in exit_gdrom() to fix the
    above issue.

    To fix these bugs, the calls to spin_lock_irqsave() and

    ocfs2: don't clear bh uptodate for block read
    
    [ Upstream commit 70306d9dce75abde855cefaf32b3f71eed8602a3 ]
    
    For sync io read in ocfs2_read_blocks_sync(), first clear bh uptodate flag
    and submit the io, second wait io done, last check whether bh uptodate, if
    not return io error.
    
    If two sync io for the same bh were issued, it could be the first io done
    and set uptodate flag, but just before check that flag, the second io came
    in and cleared uptodate, then ocfs2_read_blocks_sync() for the first io
    will return IO error.
    
    Indeed it's not necessary to clear uptodate flag, as the io end handler
    end_buffer_read_sync() will set or clear it based on io succeed or failed.
    
    The following message was found from a nfs server but the underlying

    scripts/decode_stacktrace: only strip base path when a prefix of the path
    
    [ Upstream commit 67a28de47faa83585dd644bd4c31e5a1d9346c50 ]
    
    Running something like:
    
            decodecode vmlinux .
    
    leads to interested results where not only the leading "." gets stripped
    from the displayed paths, but also anywhere in the string, displaying
    something like:
    
            kvm_vcpu_check_block (arch/arm64/kvm/virt/kvm/kvm_mainc:2141)
    
    which doesn't help further processing.
    
    Fix it by only stripping the base path if it is a prefix of the path.

    Changing protection is a very high cost operation in UML
    because in addition to an extra syscall it also interrupts
    mmap merge sequences generated by the tlb.
    
    While the condition is not particularly common it is worth

    cifs: check ntwrk_buf_start for NULL before dereferencing it
    
    [ Upstream commit 59a63e479ce36a3f24444c3a36efe82b78e4a8e0 ]
    
    RHBZ: 1021460
    
    There is an issue where when multiple threads open/close the same directory
    ntwrk_buf_start might end up being NULL, causing the call to smbCalcSize
    later to oops with a NULL deref.
    
    The real bug is why this happens and why this can become NULL for an
    open cfile, which should not be allowed.
    This patch tries to avoid a oops until the time when we fix the underlying
    issue.

    NFS: nfs_compare_mount_options always compare auth flavors.
    
    [ Upstream commit 594d1644cd59447f4fceb592448d5cd09eb09b5e ]
    
    This patch removes the check from nfs_compare_mount_options to see if a
    `sec' option was passed for the current mount before comparing auth
    flavors and instead just always compares auth flavors.
    
    Consider the following scenario:
    
    You have a server with the address 192.168.1.1 and two exports /export/a
    and /export/b.  The first export supports `sys' and `krb5' security, the
    second just `sys'.
    
    Assume you start with no mounts from the server.
    
    The following results in EIOs being returned as the kernel nfs client
    incorrectly thinks it can share the underlying `struct nfs_server's:
    
    $ mkdir /tmp/{a,b}
    $ sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3,sec=krb5 192.168.1.1:/export/a /tmp/a
    $ sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3          192.168.1.1:/export/b /tmp/b

    fbdev: fbcon: Fix unregister crash when more than one framebuffer
    
    [ Upstream commit 2122b40580dd9d0620398739c773d07a7b7939d0 ]
    
    When unregistering fbdev using unregister_framebuffer(), any bound
    console will unbind automatically. This is working fine if this is the
    only framebuffer, resulting in a switch to the dummy console. However if
    there is a fb0 and I unregister fb1 having a bound console, I eventually
    get a crash. The fastest way for me to trigger the crash is to do a
    reboot, resulting in this splat:

    igb: Fix an issue that PME is not enabled during runtime suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 1fb3a7a75e2efcc83ef21f2434069cddd6fae6f5 ]
    
    I210 ethernet card doesn't wakeup when a cable gets plugged. It's
    because its PME is not set.
    
    Since commit 42eca2302146 ("PCI: Don't touch card regs after runtime
    suspend D3"), if the PCI state is saved, pci_pm_runtime_suspend() stops
    calling pci_finish_runtime_suspend(), which enables the PCI PME.
    
    To fix the issue, let's not to save PCI states when it's runtime
    suspend, to let the PCI subsystem enables PME.

    fbdev: fbmem: behave better with small rotated displays and many CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit f75df8d4b4fabfad7e3cba2debfad12741c6fde7 ]
    
    Blitting an image with "negative" offsets is not working since there
    is no clipping. It hopefully just crashes. For the bootup logo, there
    is protection so that blitting does not happen as the image is drawn
    further and further to the right (ROTATE_UR) or further and further
    down (ROTATE_CW). There is however no protection when drawing in the
    opposite directions (ROTATE_UD and ROTATE_CCW).
    
    Add back this protection.
    
    The regression is 20-odd years old but the mindless warning-killing
    mentality displayed in commit 34bdb666f4b2 ("fbdev: fbmem: remove
    positive test on unsigned values") is also to blame, methinks.

    drbd: skip spurious timeout (ping-timeo) when failing promote
    
    [ Upstream commit 9848b6ddd8c92305252f94592c5e278574e7a6ac ]
    
    If you try to promote a Secondary while connected to a Primary
    and allow-two-primaries is NOT set, we will wait for "ping-timeout"
    to give this node a chance to detect a dead primary,
    in case the cluster manager noticed faster than we did.
    
    But if we then are *still* connected to a Primary,
    we fail (after an additional timeout of ping-timout).
    
    This change skips the spurious second timeout.
    
    Most people won't notice really,
    since "ping-timeout" by default is half a second.
    
    But in some installations, ping-timeout may be 10 or 20 seconds or more,
    and spuriously delaying the error return becomes annoying.

    drbd: disconnect, if the wrong UUIDs are attached on a connected peer
    
    [ Upstream commit b17b59602b6dcf8f97a7dc7bc489a48388d7063a ]
    
    With "on-no-data-accessible suspend-io", DRBD requires the next attach
    or connect to be to the very same data generation uuid tag it lost last.
    
    If we first lost connection to the peer,
    then later lost connection to our own disk,
    we would usually refuse to re-connect to the peer,
    because it presents the wrong data set.
    
    However, if the peer first connects without a disk,
    and then attached its disk, we accepted that same wrong data set,
    which would be "unexpected" by any user of that DRBD
    and cause "undefined results" (read: very likely data corruption).
    
    The fix is to forcefully disconnect as soon as we notice that the peer
    attached to the "wrong" dataset.

    drbd: narrow rcu_read_lock in drbd_sync_handshake
    
    [ Upstream commit d29e89e34952a9ad02c77109c71a80043544296e ]
    
    So far there was the possibility that we called
    genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO)/mutex_lock() while holding an rcu_read_lock().
    
    This included cases like:
    
    drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
      drbd_asb_recover_1p
        drbd_khelper
          drbd_bcast_event
            genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO) --> may sleep
    
    drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
      drbd_asb_recover_1p
        drbd_khelper
          notify_helper
            genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO) --> may sleep
    
    drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
      drbd_asb_recover_1p
        drbd_khelper
          notify_helper
            mutex_lock --> may sleep
    
    While using GFP_ATOMIC whould have been possible in the first two cases,
    the real fix is to narrow the rcu_read_lock.

    arm64: KVM: Skip MMIO insn after emulation
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d640732dbebed0f10f18526de21652931f0b2f2 ]
    
    When we emulate an MMIO instruction, we advance the CPU state within
    decode_hsr(), before emulating the instruction effects.
    
    Having this logic in decode_hsr() is opaque, and advancing the state
    before emulation is problematic. It gets in the way of applying
    consistent single-step logic, and it prevents us from being able to fail
    an MMIO instruction with a synchronous exception.
    
    Clean this up by only advancing the CPU state *after* the effects of the
    instruction are emulated.

    We can use MEMSTICK_POWER_{ON,OFF} along with pm_runtime_{get,put}
    helpers to let memstick host support runtime pm.
    
    The rpm count may go down to zero before the memstick host powers on, so
    the host can be runtime suspended.
    
    So before doing card detection, increment the rpm count to avoid the
    host gets runtime suspended. Balance the rpm count after card detection
    is done.

    ARM: dts: Fix OMAP4430 SDP Ethernet startup
    
    [ Upstream commit 84fb6c7feb1494ebb7d1ec8b95cfb7ada0264465 ]
    
    It was noticed that unbinding and rebinding the KSZ8851 ethernet
    resulted in the driver reporting "failed to read device ID" at probe.
    Probing the reset line with a 'scope while repeatedly attempting to
    bind the driver in a shell loop revealed that the KSZ8851 RSTN pin is
    constantly held at zero, meaning the device is held in reset, and
    does not respond on the SPI bus.
    
    Experimentation with the startup delay on the regulator set to 50ms
    shows that the reset is positively released after 20ms.
    
    Schematics for this board are not available, and the traces are buried
    in the inner layers of the board which makes tracing where the RSTN pin
    extremely difficult.  We can only guess that the RSTN pin is wired to a
    reset generator chip driven off the ethernet supply, which fits the
    observed behaviour.
    
    Include this delay in the regulator startup delay - effectively
    treating the reset as a "supply stable" indicator.
    
    This can not be modelled as a delay in the KSZ8851 driver since the
    reset generation is board specific - if the RSTN pin had been wired to
    a GPIO, reset could be released earlier via the already provided support
    in the KSZ8851 driver.
    
    This also got confirmed by Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com> based
    on Blaze schematics that should be very close to SDP4430:
    
    TPS22902YFPR is used as the regulator switch (gpio48 controlled):

    timekeeping: Use proper seqcount initializer
    
    [ Upstream commit ce10a5b3954f2514af726beb78ed8d7350c5e41c ]
    
    tk_core.seq is initialized open coded, but that misses to initialize the
    lockdep map when lockdep is enabled. Lockdep splats involving tk_core seq
    consequently lack a name and are hard to read.
    
    Use the proper initializer which takes care of the lockdep map
    initialization.

    usb: hub: delay hub autosuspend if USB3 port is still link training
    
    [ Upstream commit e86108940e541febf35813402ff29fa6f4a9ac0b ]
    
    When initializing a hub we want to give a USB3 port in link training
    the same debounce delay time before autosuspening the hub as already
    trained, connected enabled ports.
    
    USB3 ports won't reach the enabled state with "current connect status" and
    "connect status change" bits set until the USB3 link training finishes.
    
    Catching the port in link training (polling) and adding the debounce delay
    prevents unnecessary failed attempts to autosuspend the hub.

    smack: fix access permissions for keyring
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b841bfab695e3b8ae793172a9ff7990f99cc3e2 ]
    
    Function smack_key_permission() only issues smack requests for the
    following operations:
     - KEY_NEED_READ (issues MAY_READ)
     - KEY_NEED_WRITE (issues MAY_WRITE)
     - KEY_NEED_LINK (issues MAY_WRITE)
     - KEY_NEED_SETATTR (issues MAY_WRITE)
    A blank smack request is issued in all other cases, resulting in
    smack access being granted if there is any rule defined between
    subject and object, or denied with -EACCES otherwise.
    
    Request MAY_READ access for KEY_NEED_SEARCH and KEY_NEED_VIEW.
    Fix the logic in the unlikely case when both MAY_READ and
    MAY_WRITE are needed. Validate access permission field for valid
    contents.

    arm64: ftrace: don't adjust the LR value
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e803e2e6e367db9a0d6ecae1bd24bb5752011bd ]
    
    The core ftrace code requires that when it is handed the PC of an
    instrumented function, this PC is the address of the instrumented
    instruction. This is necessary so that the core ftrace code can identify
    the specific instrumentation site. Since the instrumented function will
    be a BL, the address of the instrumented function is LR - 4 at entry to
    the ftrace code.
    
    This fixup is applied in the mcount_get_pc and mcount_get_pc0 helpers,
    which acquire the PC of the instrumented function.
    
    The mcount_get_lr helper is used to acquire the LR of the instrumented
    function, whose value does not require this adjustment, and cannot be
    adjusted to anything meaningful. No adjustment of this value is made on
    other architectures, including arm. However, arm64 adjusts this value by
    4.
    
    This patch brings arm64 in line with other architectures and removes the
    adjustment of the LR value.

    ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Fix some section annotations
    
    [ Upstream commit c10b26abeb53cabc1e6271a167d3f3d396ce0218 ]
    
    When building the kernel with Clang, the following section mismatch
    warnings appears:
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d398): Section mismatch in reference from
    the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_iclk_autoidle()
    The function _setup() references
    the function __init _setup_iclk_autoidle().
    This is often because _setup lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of _setup_iclk_autoidle is wrong.
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d3a0): Section mismatch in reference from
    the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_reset()
    The function _setup() references
    the function __init _setup_reset().
    This is often because _setup lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of _setup_reset is wrong.
    
    WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x2d408): Section mismatch in reference from
    the function _setup() to the function .init.text:_setup_postsetup()
    The function _setup() references
    the function __init _setup_postsetup().
    This is often because _setup lacks a __init
    annotation or the annotation of _setup_postsetup is wrong.
    
    _setup is used in omap_hwmod_allocate_module, which isn't marked __init
    and looks like it shouldn't be, meaning to fix these warnings, those
    functions must be moved out of the init section, which this patch does.

    In the expression "word1 << 16", word1 starts as u16, but is promoted to a
    signed int, then sign-extended to resource_size_t, which is probably not

    If CPU 1 calls panic_smp_self_stop() before crash_smp_send_stop(), kdump
    fails. CPU1 can't receive the ipi irq, CPU1 will be always online.
    To fix this problem, this patch split out the panic_smp_self_stop()
    and add set_cpu_online(smp_processor_id(), false).

    staging: iio: adc: ad7280a: handle error from __ad7280_read32()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0559ef7fde67bc6c83c6eb6329dbd6649528263e ]
    
    Inside __ad7280_read32(), the spi_sync_transfer() can fail with negative
    error code. This change will ensure that this error is being passed up
    in the call stack, so it can be handled.
