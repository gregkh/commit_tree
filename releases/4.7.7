    ALSA: hda - Add the top speaker pin config for HP Spectre x360
    
    commit 0eec880966e77bdbee0112989a2be67d92e39929 upstream.
    
    HP Spectre x360 with CX20724 codec has two speaker outputs while the
    BIOS sets up only the bottom one (NID 0x17) and disables the top one
    (NID 0x1d).
    
    This patch adds a fixup simply defining the proper pincfg for NID 0x1d
    so that the top speaker works as is.

    We have two new Dell laptop models, they have the same ALC255 pin
    definition, but not in the pin quirk table yet, as a result, the
    headset microphone can't work. After adding the definition in the

    Revert "usbtmc: convert to devm_kzalloc"
    
    commit ab21b63e8aedfc73565dd9cdd51eb338341177cb upstream.
    
    This reverts commit e6c7efdcb76f11b04e3d3f71c8d764ab75c9423b.
    
    Turns out it was totally wrong.  The memory is supposed to be bound to
    the kref, as the original code was doing correctly, not the
    device/driver binding as the devm_kzalloc() would cause.
    
    This fixes an oops when read would be called after the device was
    unbound from the driver.

    usb: usbip: vudc: fix left shift overflow
    
    commit 238b7bd91b16d5a08326f858db42229b212e53d8 upstream.
    
    In v_recv_cmd_submit(), urb_p->urb->pipe has the type unsigned int
    (which is 32-bit long on x86_64) but 11<<30 results in a 34-bit integer.
    Therefore the 2 leading bits are truncated and
    
        urb_p->urb->pipe &= ~(11 << 30);
    
    has the same meaning as
    
        urb_p->urb->pipe &= ~(3 << 30);
    
    This second statement seems to be how the code was intended to be
    written, as PIPE_ constants have values between 0 and 3.
    
    The overflow has been detected with a clang warning:
    
        drivers/usb/usbip/vudc_rx.c:145:27: warning: signed shift result
        (0x2C0000000) requires 35 bits to represent, but 'int' only has 32

    usb: misc: legousbtower: Fix NULL pointer deference
    
    commit 2fae9e5a7babada041e2e161699ade2447a01989 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race codition in
    the probe function of the legousbtower driver. It re-structures the
    probe function to only register the interface after successfully reading
    the board's firmware ID.
    
    The probe function does not deregister the usb interface after an error
    receiving the devices firmware ID. The device file registered
    (/dev/usb/legousbtower%d) may be read/written globally before the probe
    function returns. When tower_delete is called in the probe function
    (after an r/w has been initiated), core dev structures are deleted while
    the file operation functions are still running. If the 0 address is
    mappable on the machine, this vulnerability can be used to create a
    Local Priviege Escalation exploit via a write-what-where condition by
    remapping dev->interrupt_out_buffer in tower_write. A forged USB device
    and local program execution would be required for LPE. The USB device
    would have to delay the control message in tower_probe and accept
    the control urb in tower_open whilst guest code initiated a write to the
    device file as tower_delete is called from the error in tower_probe.
    
    This bug has existed since 2003. Patch tested by emulated device.

    dm log writes: fix bug with too large bios
    
    commit 7efb367320f56fc4d549875b6f3a6940018ef2e5 upstream.
    
    bio_alloc() can allocate a bio with at most BIO_MAX_PAGES (256) vector
    entries.  However, the incoming bio may have more vector entries if it
    was allocated by other means.  For example, bcache submits bios with
    more than BIO_MAX_PAGES entries.  This results in bio_alloc() failure.
    
    To avoid the failure, change the code so that it allocates bio with at
    most BIO_MAX_PAGES entries.  If the incoming bio has more entries,
    bio_add_page() will fail and a new bio will be allocated - the code that
    handles bio_add_page() failure already exists in the dm-log-writes
    target.

    aio: mark AIO pseudo-fs noexec
    
    commit 22f6b4d34fcf039c63a94e7670e0da24f8575a5a upstream.
    
    This ensures that do_mmap() won't implicitly make AIO memory mappings
    executable if the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag is set.  Such
    behavior is problematic because the security_mmap_file LSM hook doesn't
    catch this case, potentially permitting an attacker to bypass a W^X
    policy enforced by SELinux.
    
    I have tested the patch on my machine.
    
    To test the behavior, compile and run this:
    
        #define _GNU_SOURCE
        #include <unistd.h>
        #include <sys/personality.h>
        #include <linux/aio_abi.h>
        #include <err.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <sys/syscall.h>
    
        int main(void) {
            personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC);
            aio_context_t ctx = 0;
            if (syscall(__NR_io_setup, 1, &ctx))
                err(1, "io_setup");
    
            char cmd[1000];
            sprintf(cmd, "cat /proc/%d/maps | grep -F '/[aio]'",
                (int)getpid());
            system(cmd);
            return 0;
        }
    
    In the output, "rw-s" is good, "rwxs" is bad.

    tpm_crb: fix mapping of the buffers
    
    commit 422eac3f7deae34dbaffd08e03e27f37a5394a56 upstream.
    
    On my Lenovo x250 the following situation occurs:
    
    [18697.813871] tpm_crb MSFT0101:00: can't request region for resource
    [mem 0xacdff080-0xacdfffff]
    
    The mapping of the control area overlaps the mapping of the command
    buffer. The control area is mapped over page, which is not right. It
    should mapped over sizeof(struct crb_control_area).
    
    Fixing this issue unmasks another issue. Command and response buffers
    can overlap and they do interleave on this machine. According to the PTP
    specification the overlapping means that they are mapped to the same
    buffer.
    
    The commit has been also on a Haswell NUC where things worked before
    applying this fix so that the both code paths for response buffer
    initialization are tested.

    IB/mlx4: Use correct subnet-prefix in QP1 mads under SR-IOV
    
    commit 8ec07bf8a8b57d6c58927a16a0a22c0115cf2855 upstream.
    
    When sending QP1 MAD packets which use a GRH, the source GID
    (which consists of the 64-bit subnet prefix, and the 64 bit port GUID)
    must be included in the packet GRH.
    
    For SR-IOV, a GID cache is used, since the source GID needs to be the
    slave's source GID, and not the Hypervisor's GID. This cache also
    included a subnet_prefix. Unfortunately, the subnet_prefix field in
    the cache was never initialized (to the default subnet prefix 0xfe80::0).
    As a result, this field remained all zeroes.  Therefore, when SR-IOV
    was active, all QP1 packets which included a GRH had a source GID
    subnet prefix of all-zeroes.
    
    However, the subnet-prefix should initially be 0xfe80::0 (the default
    subnet prefix). In addition, if OpenSM modifies a port's subnet prefix,
    the new subnet prefix must be used in the GRH when sending QP1 packets.
    To fix this we now initialize the subnet prefix in the SR-IOV GID cache
    to the default subnet prefix. We update the cached value if/when OpenSM
    modifies the port's subnet prefix. We take this cached value when sending
    QP1 packets when SR-IOV is active.
    
    Note that the value is stored as an atomic64. This eliminates any need
    for locking when the subnet prefix is being updated.
    
    Note also that we depend on the FW generating the "port management change"
    event for tracking subnet-prefix changes performed by OpenSM. If running
    early FW (before 2.9.4630), subnet prefix changes will not be tracked (but
    the default subnet prefix still will be stored in the cache; therefore
    users who do not modify the subnet prefix will not have a problem).
    IF there is a need for such tracking also for early FW, we will add that
    capability in a subsequent patch.

    IB/mlx4: Fix incorrect MC join state bit-masking on SR-IOV
    
    commit e5ac40cd66c2f3cd11bc5edc658f012661b16347 upstream.
    
    Because of an incorrect bit-masking done on the join state bits, when
    handling a join request we failed to detect a difference between the
    group join state and the request join state when joining as send only
    full member (0x8). This caused the MC join request not to be sent.
    This issue is relevant only when SRIOV is enabled and SM supports
    send only full member.
    
    This fix separates scope bits and join states bits a nibble each.

    flag, this means that if while flushing we have a MC join in progress
    and the QP was attached to BC MGID we can have a mismatches when
    re-attaching a QP to the BC MGID.
    
    The light flush would set the broadcast group to NULL causing an on
    the fly join to rejoin and reattach to the BC MCG as well as adding
    the BC MGID to the multicast list. The flush process would later on
    remove the BC MGID and detach it from the QP. On the next flush
    the BC MGID is present in the multicast list but not found when trying
    to detach it because of the previous double attach and single detach.

    should obtain the SAS address from a scsi device or not. This will
    prevent us from tripping on the BUG_ON() in sas_sdev_to_rdev() if the

    regmap: rbtree: Avoid overlapping nodes
    
    commit 1bc8da4e143c0fd8807e061a66d91d5972601ab1 upstream.
    
    When searching for a suitable node that should be used for inserting a new
    register, which does not fall within the range of any existing node, we not
    only looks for nodes which are directly adjacent to the new register, but
    for nodes within a certain proximity. This is done to avoid creating lots
    of small nodes with just a few registers spacing in between, which would
    increase memory usage as well as tree traversal time.
    
    This means there might be multiple node candidates which fall within the
    proximity range of the new register. If we choose the first node we
    encounter, under certain register insertion patterns it is possible to end
    up with overlapping ranges. This will break order in the rbtree and can
    cause the cached register value to become corrupted.
    
    E.g. take the simplified example where the proximity range is 2 and the
    register insertion sequence is 1, 4, 2, 3, 5.
     * Insert of register 1 creates a new node, this is the root of the rbtree
     * Insert of register 4 creates a new node, which is inserted to the right
       of the root.
     * Insert of register 2 gets inserted to the first node
     * Insert of register 3 gets inserted to the first node
     * Insert of register 5 also gets inserted into the first node since
       this is the first node encountered and it is within the proximity range.
       Now there are two overlapping nodes.
    
    To avoid this always choose the node that is closest to the new register.
    This will ensure that nodes will not overlap. The tree traversal is still
    done as a binary search, we just don't stop at the first node found. So the
    complexity of the algorithm stays within the same order.
    
    Ideally if a new register is in the range of two adjacent blocks those
    blocks should be merged, but that is a much more invasive change and left
    for later.
    
    The issue was initially introduced in commit 472fdec7380c ("regmap: rbtree:
    Reduce number of nodes, take 2"), but became much more exposed by commit
    6399aea629b0 ("regmap: rbtree: When adding a reg do a bsearch for target
    node") which changed the order in which nodes are looked-up.

    IB/ipoib: Fix memory corruption in ipoib cm mode connect flow
    
    commit 546481c2816ea3c061ee9d5658eb48070f69212e upstream.
    
    When a new CM connection is being requested, ipoib driver copies data
    from the path pointer in the CM/tx object, the path object might be
    invalid at the point and memory corruption will happened later when now
    the CM driver will try using that data.
    
    The next scenario demonstrates it:
            neigh_add_path --> ipoib_cm_create_tx -->
            queue_work (pointer to path is in the cm/tx struct)
            #while the work is still in the queue,
            #the port goes down and causes the ipoib_flush_paths:
            ipoib_flush_paths --> path_free --> kfree(path)
            #at this point the work scheduled starts.
            ipoib_cm_tx_start --> copy from the (invalid)path pointer:
            (memcpy(&pathrec, &p->path->pathrec, sizeof pathrec);)
             -> memory corruption.
    
    To fix that the driver now starts the CM/tx connection only if that
    specific path exists in the general paths database.
    This check is protected with the relevant locks, and uses the gid from
    the neigh member in the CM/tx object which is valid according to the ref
    count that was taken by the CM/tx.

    ceph: do not modify fi->frag in need_reset_readdir()
    
    commit 0f5aa88a7bb28b73253fb42b3df8202142769f39 upstream.
    
    Commit f3c4ebe65ea1 ("ceph: using hash value to compose dentry offset")
    modified "if (fpos_frag(new_pos) != fi->frag)" to "if (fi->frag |=
    fpos_frag(new_pos))" in need_reset_readdir(), thus replacing a
    comparison operator with an assignment one.

    KVM: nVMX: postpone VMCS changes on MSR_IA32_APICBASE write
    
    commit dccbfcf52cebb8963246eba5b177b77f26b34da0 upstream.
    
    If vmcs12 does not intercept APIC_BASE writes, then KVM will handle the
    write with vmcs02 as the current VMCS.
    This will incorrectly apply modifications intended for vmcs01 to vmcs02
    and L2 can use it to gain access to L0's x2APIC registers by disabling
    virtualized x2APIC while using msr bitmap that assumes enabled.
    
    Postpone execution of vmx_set_virtual_x2apic_mode until vmcs01 is the
    current VMCS.  An alternative solution would temporarily make vmcs01 the
    current VMCS, but it requires more care.

    lib/test_hash.c: fix warning in preprocessor symbol evaluation
    
    commit e6173ba42bbdba05fd4f3021c0beda0506271507 upstream.
    
    Some versions of gcc don't like tests for the value of an undefined
    preprocessor symbol, even in the #else branch of an #ifndef:
    
        lib/test_hash.c:224:7: warning: "HAVE_ARCH__HASH_32" is not defined [-Wundef]
         #elif HAVE_ARCH__HASH_32 != 1

         #elif HAVE_ARCH_HASH_64 != 1
               ^
    
    Seen with gcc 4.9, not seen with 4.1.2.
    
    Change the logic to only check the value inside an #ifdef to fix this.

    kernel/fork: fix CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID regression in nscd
    
    commit 735f2770a770156100f534646158cb58cb8b2939 upstream.
    
    Commit fec1d0115240 ("[PATCH] Disable CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID for abnormal
    exit") has caused a subtle regression in nscd which uses
    CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID to clear the nscd_certainly_running flag in the
    shared databases, so that the clients are notified when nscd is
    restarted.  Now, when nscd uses a non-persistent database, clients that
    have it mapped keep thinking the database is being updated by nscd, when
    in fact nscd has created a new (anonymous) one (for non-persistent
    databases it uses an unlinked file as backend).
    
    The original proposal for the CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID change claimed
    (https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/25/233):
    
    : The NPTL library uses the CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID flag on clone() syscalls
    : on behalf of pthread_create() library calls.  This feature is used to
    : request that the kernel clear the thread-id in user space (at an address
    : provided in the syscall) when the thread disassociates itself from the
    : address space, which is done in mm_release().
    :
    : Unfortunately, when a multi-threaded process incurs a core dump (such as
    : from a SIGSEGV), the core-dumping thread sends SIGKILL signals to all of
    : the other threads, which then proceed to clear their user-space tids
    : before synchronizing in exit_mm() with the start of core dumping.  This
    : misrepresents the state of process's address space at the time of the
    : SIGSEGV and makes it more difficult for someone to debug NPTL and glibc
    : problems (misleading him/her to conclude that the threads had gone away
    : before the fault).
    :
    : The fix below is to simply avoid the CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID action if a
    : core dump has been initiated.
    
    The resulting patch from Roland (https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/269)
    seems to have a larger scope than the original patch asked for.  It
    seems that limitting the scope of the check to core dumping should work
    for SIGSEGV issue describe above.

    sysctl: handle error writing UINT_MAX to u32 fields
    
    commit e7d316a02f683864a12389f8808570e37fb90aa3 upstream.
    
    We have scripts which write to certain fields on 3.18 kernels but this
    seems to be failing on 4.4 kernels.  An entry which we write to here is
    xfrm_aevent_rseqth which is u32.
    
      echo 4294967295  > /proc/sys/net/core/xfrm_aevent_rseqth
    
    Commit 230633d109e3 ("kernel/sysctl.c: detect overflows when converting
    to int") prevented writing to sysctl entries when integer overflow
    occurs.  However, this does not apply to unsigned integers.
    
    Heinrich suggested that we introduce a new option to handle 64 bit
    limits and set min as 0 and max as UINT_MAX.  This might not work as it
    leads to issues similar to __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax.  Alternatively,
    we would need to change the datatype of the entry to 64 bit.
    
      static int __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax(void *data, struct ctl_table
      {
          i = (unsigned long *) data;   //This cast is causing to read beyond the size of data (u32)
          vleft = table->maxlen / sizeof(unsigned long); //vleft is 0 because maxlen is sizeof(u32) which is lesser than sizeof(unsigned long) on x86_64.
    
    Introduce a new proc handler proc_douintvec.  Individual proc entries
    will need to be updated to use the new handler.

    powerpc/prom: Fix sub-processor option passed to ibm, client-architecture-support
    
    commit 66443efa83dc73775100b7442962ce2cb0d4472e upstream.
    
    When booting from an OpenFirmware which supports it, we use the
    "ibm,client-architecture-support" firmware call to communicate
    our capabilities to firmware.
    
    The format of the structure we pass to firmware is specified in
    PAPR (Power Architecture Platform Requirements), or the public version
    LoPAPR (Linux on Power Architecture Platform Reference).
    
    Referring to table 244 in LoPAPR v1.1, option vector 5 contains a 4 byte
    field at bytes 17-20 for the "Platform Facilities Enable". This is
    followed by a 1 byte field at byte 21 for "Sub-Processor Represenation
    Level".
    
    Comparing to the code, there we have the Platform Facilities
    options (OV5_PFO_*) at byte 17, but we fail to pad that field out to its
    full width of 4 bytes. This means the OV5_SUB_PROCESSORS option is
    incorrectly placed at byte 18.
    
    Fix it by adding zero bytes for bytes 18, 19, 20, and comment the bytes
    to hopefully make it clearer in future.
    
    As far as I'm aware nothing actually consumes this value at this time,
    so the effect of this bug is nil in practice.
    
    It does mean we've been incorrectly setting bit 15 of the "Platform
    Facilities Enable" option for the past ~3 1/2 years, so we should avoid
    allocating that bit to anything else in future.

    xprtrdma: Remove FMRs from the unmap list after unmapping
    
    commit 38f1932e60ba249660bbae585f61ef2dee3313a4 upstream.
    
    ib_unmap_fmr() takes a list of FMRs to unmap. However, it does not
    remove the FMRs from this list as it processes them. Other
    ib_unmap_fmr() call sites are careful to remove FMRs from the list
    after ib_unmap_fmr() returns.
    
    Since commit 7c7a5390dc6c8 ("xprtrdma: Add ro_unmap_sync method for FMR")
    fmr_op_unmap_sync passes more than one FMR to ib_unmap_fmr(), but
    it didn't bother to remove the FMRs from that list once the call was
    complete.
    
    I've noticed some instability that could be related to list
    tangling by the new fmr_op_unmap_sync() logic. In an abundance
    of caution, add some defensive logic to clean up properly after
    ib_unmap_fmr().

    watchdog: core: Clear WDOG_HW_RUNNING before calling the stop function
    
    commit 3c10bbde10fe4dca52726e246cefa6b0a1dfbd3e upstream.
    
    WDOG_HW_RUNNING indicates that the hardware watchdog is running while the
    watchdog device is closed. The flag may be set by the driver when it is
    instantiated to indicate that the watchdog is running, and that the
    watchdog core needs to send heartbeat requests to the driver until the
    watchdog device is opened.
    
    When the watchdog device is closed, the flag can be used by the driver's
    stop function to indicate to the watchdog core that it was unable to stop
    the watchdog, and that the watchdog core needs to send heartbeat requests.
    This only works if the flag is actually cleared when the watchdog is
    stopped. To avoid having to clear the flag in each driver's stop function,
    clear it in the watchdog core before calling the stop function.

    NFS: Don't drop CB requests with invalid principals

    Before commit 778be232a207 ("NFS do not find client in NFSv4
    pg_authenticate"), the Linux callback server replied with
    RPC_AUTH_ERROR / RPC_AUTH_BADCRED, instead of dropping the CB
    request. Let's restore that behavior so the server has a chance to
    do something useful about it, and provide a warning that helps
    admins correct the problem.

    mm, kasan: account for object redzone in SLUB's nearest_obj()
    
    commit c146a2b98eb5898eb0fab15a332257a4102ecae9 upstream.
    
    When looking up the nearest SLUB object for a given address, correctly

    Previously, when KASAN had detected an error on an object from a cache
    with SLAB_RED_ZONE set, the actual start address of the object was
    miscalculated, which led to random stacks having been reported.

    tdev->signal is not set NULL after it's freed. This will cause random
    exceptions when the stale pointer is accessed after tdev->signal is
    freed. Also, since tdev->signal allocation is skipped the next time
    it's written, this leads to continuous fault finally leading to the

    v4l: vsp1: Fix crash when resetting pipeline
    
    commit d69e40fade97b6b19837c1772efa516bc28cc870 upstream.
    
    The vsp1_pipeline_reset() function loops over pipeline inputs and output
    and resets them. When doing so it assumes both that the pipeline has
    been correctly configured with an output, and that inputs are are stored
    in the pipe inputs array at positions 0 to num_inputs-1.
    
    Both the assumptions are incorrect. The pipeline might need to be reset
    after a failed attempts to configure it, without any output specified.
    Furthermore, inputs are stored in a positiong equal to their RPF index,
    possibly creating holes in the inputs array if the RPFs are not used in
    sequence.
    
    Fix both issues by looping over the whole inputs array and skipping
    unused entries, and ignoring the output when not set.

    tile: Define AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH for ARCH_DLINFO
    
    commit cdf8b4633075f2171d440d2e37c9c2609019a81a upstream.
    
    AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH should be defined with the maximum number of
    NEW_AUX_ENT entries that ARCH_DLINFO can contain, but it wasn't defined
    for tile at all even though ARCH_DLINFO will contain one NEW_AUX_ENT for
    the VDSO address.
    
    This shouldn't be a problem as AT_VECTOR_SIZE_BASE includes space for
    AT_BASE_PLATFORM which tile doesn't use, but lets define it now and add
    the comment above ARCH_DLINFO as found in several other architectures to
    remind future modifiers of ARCH_DLINFO to keep AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH up to
    date.

    pstore: drop file opened reference count
    
    commit 52d210d961a62a9662e27f14d6505d6741b2fb02 upstream.
    
    In ee1d267423a1 ("pstore: add pstore unregister") I added:
            .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    in both pstore_fs_type and pstore_file_operations to increase a reference
    count when pstore filesystem is mounted and pstore file is opened.
    
    But, it's repetitive. There is no need to increase the opened reference
    count. We only need to increase the mounted reference count. When a file
    is opened, the filesystem can't be unmounted. Hence the pstore module
    can't be unloaded either.
    
    So I drop the opened reference count in this patch.

    blk-mq: actually hook up defer list when running requests
    
    commit 52b9c330c6a8a4b5a1819bdaddf4ec76ab571e81 upstream.
    
    If ->queue_rq() returns BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_OK, we use continue and skip
    over the rest of the loop body. However, dptr is assigned later in the
    loop body, and the BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_OK case is exactly the case that we'd
    want it for.
    
    NVMe isn't actually using BLK_MQ_F_DEFER_ISSUE yet, nor is any other
    in-tree driver, but if the code's going to be there, it might as well
    work.

    hwrng: omap - Fix assumption that runtime_get_sync will always succeed
    
    commit 61dc0a446e5d08f2de8a24b45f69a1e302bb1b1b upstream.
    
    pm_runtime_get_sync does return a error value that must be checked for
    error conditions, else, due to various reasons, the device maynot be
    enabled and the system will crash due to lack of clock to the hardware
    module.

    PCMCIA suspend/resume no longer works since the commit mentioned below,
    as the callbacks are no longer made.  Convert the driver to the new
    dev_pm_ops, which restores the suspend/resume functionality.  Tested on

    ARM: sa1111: fix pcmcia suspend/resume
    
    commit 06dfe5cc0cc684e735cb0232fdb756d30780b05d upstream.
    
    SA1111 PCMCIA was broken when PCMCIA switched to using dev_pm_ops for
    the PCMCIA socket class.  PCMCIA used to handle suspend/resume via the
    socket hosting device, which happened at normal device suspend/resume
    time.
    
    However, the referenced commit changed this: much of the resume now
    happens much earlier, in the noirq resume handler of dev_pm_ops.
    
    However, on SA1111, the PCMCIA device is not accessible as the SA1111
    has not been resumed at _noirq time.  It's slightly worse than that,
    because the SA1111 has already been put to sleep at _noirq time, so
    suspend doesn't work properly.
    
    Fix this by converting the core SA1111 code to use dev_pm_ops as well,
    and performing its own suspend/resume at noirq time.
    
    This fixes these errors in the kernel log:
    
    pcmcia_socket pcmcia_socket0: time out after reset
    pcmcia_socket pcmcia_socket1: time out after reset
    
    and the resulting lack of PCMCIA cards after a S2RAM cycle.

    ARM: shmobile: fix regulator quirk for Gen2
    
    commit c2f321126e31cd69365e65ecd4a7c774e4fc71d2 upstream.
    
    The current implementation only works if the da9xxx devices are added
    before their drivers are registered. Only then it can apply the fixes to
    both devices. Otherwise, the driver for the first device gets probed
    before the fix for the second device can be applied. This is what
    fails when using the IP core switcher or when having the i2c master
    driver as a module.
    
    So, we need to disable both da9xxx once we detected one of them. We now
    use i2c_transfer with hardcoded i2c_messages and device addresses, so we
    don't need the da9xxx client devices to be instantiated. Because the
    fixup is used on specific boards only, the addresses are not going to
    change.

    also match the RPM based regulator driver which calls these by
    their 5vs names (see qcom_smd-regulator.c). There aren't any
    users of these regulators so far, so there aren't any concerns of
    DT ABI breakage here. While we're here making updates to the
    switches, also mandate usage of the OCP irq for these switches
    too.

    commit c333dfe8dba7d3e47e97e1cee3c38123e19ae73c upstream.
    
    The S4 supply is sometimes called the boost regulator because it
    outputs 5V. Typically it's connected to the 5vs1 and 5vs2
    switches for use in USB OTG and HDMI applications. Add support
    for this regulator which was mistakenly left out from the initial
    submission of this driver.

    regulator: pwm: Fix regulator ramp delay for continuous mode
    
    commit c2588393e6315ab68207323d37d2a73713d6bc81 upstream.
    
    The original commit adding support for continuous voltage mode didn't
    handle the regulator ramp delay properly.  It treated the delay as a
    fixed delay in uS despite the property being defined as uV / uS.  Let's
    adjust it.  Luckily there appear to be no users of this ramp delay for
    PWM regulators (as per grepping through device trees in linuxnext).
    
    Note also that the upper bound of usleep_range probably shouldn't be a
    full 1 ms longer than the lower bound since I've seen plenty of hardware
    with a ramp rate of ~5000 uS / uV and for small jumps the total delays
    are in the tens of uS.  1000 is way too much.  We'll try to be dynamic
    and use 10%.
    
    NOTE: This commit doesn't add support for regulator-enable-ramp-delay.
    That could be done in a future patch when someone has a user of that
    featre.
    
    Though this patch is shows as "fixing" a bug, there are no actual known
    users of continuous mode PWM regulator w/ ramp delay in mainline and so
    this likely won't have any effect on anyone unless they are working
    out-of-tree with private patches.  For anyone in this state, it is
    highly encouraged to also pick Boris Brezillon's WIP patches to get
    yourself a reliable and glitch-free regulator.

    Bluetooth: split sk_filter in l2cap_sock_recv_cb
    
    commit dbb50887c8f619fc5c3489783ebc3122bc134a31 upstream.
    
    During an audit for sk_filter(), we found that rx_busy_skb handling
    in l2cap_sock_recv_cb() and l2cap_sock_recvmsg() looks not quite as
    intended.
    
    The assumption from commit e328140fdacb ("Bluetooth: Use event-driven
    approach for handling ERTM receive buffer") is that errors returned
    from sock_queue_rcv_skb() are due to receive buffer shortage. However,
    nothing should prevent doing a setsockopt() with SO_ATTACH_FILTER on
    the socket, that could drop some of the incoming skbs when handled in
    sock_queue_rcv_skb().
    
    In that case sock_queue_rcv_skb() will return with -EPERM, propagated
    from sk_filter() and if in L2CAP_MODE_ERTM mode, wrong assumption was
    that we failed due to receive buffer being full. From that point onwards,
    due to the to-be-dropped skb being held in rx_busy_skb, we cannot make
    any forward progress as rx_busy_skb is never cleared from l2cap_sock_recvmsg(),
    due to the filter drop verdict over and over coming from sk_filter().
    Meanwhile, in l2cap_sock_recv_cb() all new incoming skbs are being
    dropped due to rx_busy_skb being occupied.
    
    Instead, just use __sock_queue_rcv_skb() where an error really tells that
    there's a receive buffer issue. Split the sk_filter() and enable it for
    non-segmented modes at queuing time since at this point in time the skb has
    already been through the ERTM state machine and it has been acked, so dropping
    is not allowed. Instead, for ERTM and streaming mode, call sk_filter() in
    l2cap_data_rcv() so the packet can be dropped before the state machine sees it.

    Commit bbeddf52adc1 ("printk: move braille console support into separate

    _braille_console_setup(), changing the type of variable str from char*
    to char**.  In this commit, memcmp(str, "brl,", 4) was correctly updated
    to memcmp(*str, "brl,", 4) but not memcmp(str, "brl=", 4).
    
    Update the code to make "brl=" option work again and replace memcmp()
    with strncmp() to make the compiler able to detect such an issue.

    MIPS: Malta: Fix IOCU disable switch read for MIPS64
    
    commit 305723ab439e14debc1d339aa04e835d488b8253 upstream.
    
    Malta boards used with CPU emulators feature a switch to disable use of
    an IOCU. Software has to check this switch & ignore any present IOCU if
    the switch is closed. The read used to do this was unsafe for 64 bit
    kernels, as it simply casted the address 0xbf403000 to a pointer &
    dereferenced it. Whilst in a 32 bit kernel this would access kseg1, in a
    64 bit kernel this attempts to access xuseg & results in an address
    error exception.
    
    Fix by accessing a correctly formed ckseg1 address generated using the
    CKSEG1ADDR macro.
    
    Whilst modifying this code, define the name of the register and the bit
    we care about within it, which indicates whether PCI DMA is routed to
    the IOCU or straight to DRAM. The code previously checked that bit 0 was
    also set, but the least significant 7 bits of the CONFIG_GEN0 register
    contain the value of the MReqInfo signal provided to the IOCU OCP bus,
    so singling out bit 0 makes little sense & that part of the check is
    dropped.

    MIPS: uprobes: remove incorrect set_orig_insn
    
    commit ddabfa5c2e33f1b495f3e0176de7057850915c0b upstream.
    
    Generic kernel code implements a weak version of set_orig_insn that
    moves cached 'insn' from arch_uprobe to the original code location when
    the trap is removed.
    MIPS variant used arch_uprobe->orig_inst which was never initialised
    properly, so this code only inserted a nop instead of the original
    instruction. With that change orig_inst can also be safely removed.

    arm64: debug: avoid resetting stepping state machine when TIF_SINGLESTEP
    
    commit 3a402a709500c5a3faca2111668c33d96555e35a upstream.
    
    When TIF_SINGLESTEP is set for a task, the single-step state machine is
    enabled and we must take care not to reset it to the active-not-pending
    state if it is already in the active-pending state.
    
    Unfortunately, that's exactly what user_enable_single_step does, by
    unconditionally setting the SS bit in the SPSR for the current task.
    This causes failures in the GDB testsuite, where GDB ends up missing
    expected step traps if the instruction being stepped generates another
    trap, e.g. PTRACE_EVENT_FORK from an SVC instruction.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by preserving the current state of the
    stepping state machine when TIF_SINGLESTEP is set on the current thread.

    ARM: 8618/1: decompressor: reset ttbcr fields to use TTBR0 on ARMv7
    
    commit 117e5e9c4cfcb7628f08de074fbfefec1bb678b7 upstream.
    
    If the bootloader uses the long descriptor format and jumps to
    kernel decompressor code, TTBCR may not be in a right state.
    Before enabling the MMU, it is required to clear the TTBCR.PD0
    field to use TTBR0 for translation table walks.
    
    The commit dbece45894d3a ("ARM: 7501/1: decompressor:
    reset ttbcr for VMSA ARMv7 cores") does the reset of TTBCR.N, but
    doesn't consider all the bits for the size of TTBCR.N.
    
    Clear TTBCR.PD0 field and reset all the three bits of TTBCR.N to
    indicate the use of TTBR0 and the correct base address width.

    irqchip/gicv3: Silence noisy DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS warning
    
    commit 727653d6ce7103b245eb8041f55dd5885f4c3289 upstream.
    
    gic_raise_softirq() walks the list of cpus using for_each_cpu(), it calls
    gic_compute_target_list() which advances the iterator by the number of
    CPUs in the cluster.
    
    If gic_compute_target_list() reaches the last CPU it leaves the iterator
    pointing at the last CPU. This means the next time round the for_each_cpu()
    loop cpumask_next() will be called with an invalid CPU.

    batman-adv: fix elp packet data reservation
    
    commit 1e5d343b8f23770e8ac5d31f5c439826bdb35148 upstream.
    
    The skb_reserve() call only reserved headroom for the mac header, but
    not the elp packet header itself.
    
    Fixing this by using skb_put()'ing towards the skb tail instead of
    skb_push()'ing towards the skb head.

    commit 936523441bb64cdc9a5b263e8fd2782e70313a57 upstream.
    
    batadv_find_router dereferences last_bonding_candidate from
    orig_node without making sure that it has a valid reference. This reference
    has to be retrieved by increasing the reference counter while holding
    neigh_list_lock. The lock is required to avoid that
    batadv_last_bonding_replace removes the current last_bonding_candidate,
    reduces the reference counter and maybe destroys the object in this
    process.

    commit b71121b4b70a995c0b794026e84c880c4f26c361 upstream.
    
    Device notifications are not received after the first interface is
    closed; since there is an unregister for notifications on every
    interface close. Correct this by unregistering for device
    notifications only when the last interface is closed. Also, make
    all operations on the i40iw_notifiers_registered atomic as it
    can be read/modified concurrently.

    commit 5a7d87da8d9b9f04ecdbebe7e5710a1391f85fa8 upstream.
    
    gcc is apparently unablel to track the state of the local 'resp_v2'
    variable across the kzalloc() function, and warns about the response
    variable being used without an initialization:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/nvm.c: In function ‘iwl_mvm_update_mcc’:
    drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/nvm.c:727:36: warning: ‘mcc_resp_v1’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

       memcpy(resp_cp, mcc_resp, resp_len);
    
    The warning showed up in x86 allmodconfig after my patch to
    unhide -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings by default was merged,
    though it always existed in randconfig builds. I did not
    catch the warning earlier because I was testing on ARM, which
    never produced the warning.
    
    This rearranges the code in a way that improves readability for
    both humans and the compiler, and that avoids the warning.

    commit d5d0689aefc59c6a5352ca25d7e6d47d03f543ce upstream.
    
    This fixes a pretty ancient bug that hasn't manifested itself
    until now.
    The scratchbuf for command queue is allocated only for 32 slots
    but is accessed with the queue write pointer - which can be
    up to 256.
    Since the scratch buf size was 16 and there are up to 256 TFDs
    we never passed a page boundary when accessing the scratch buffer,
    but when attempting to increase the size of the scratch buffer a
    panic was quick to follow when trying to access the address resulted
    in a page boundary.

    iwlwifi: mvm: write the correct internal TXF index
    
    commit e7c9bd1cc632e924a69bf704385484386bb10933 upstream.
    
    The TX fifos are arranged consecutively in the SMEM, beginning
    with the regular fifos, and tailed by the internal fifos.
    In the current code, while trying to read the internal fifos,
    we read the fifos beginning with the index zero.
    By doing this we actually re-read the regular fifos.
    
    In order to read the internal fifos, start the reading index
    from the number of regular fifos configured by the fw.

    iwlwifi: mvm: fix txq aggregation bug
    
    commit 2c4a247e42526d9aae8f5ce1f190b893532f2806 upstream.
    
    Fix an issue where nullfunc frames and block ack requests
    had the same tid as aggregation frames and were queued on
    a non aggregation queue. The pending frames counter included
    those frames but the check whether to decrement the pending
    frames counter relied on the tid status and not on the txq id.
    The result was an inconsistent state of the pending frames
    counter followed by a failure to remove the station.
    This failure triggered SYSASSERT 0x3421.
    
    In addition, fix a situation in DQA mode where the number
    of pending frames turned negative. This was due to the TX queue
    being on the IWL_EMPTYING_HW_QUEUE_DELBA state and its frames
    were still decremented.
    
    Even though the SYSASSERT issue is fixed when DQA is disabled,
    the issue is not completely solved when DQA is enabled and
    should still be fixed.

    commit c3ccf357c3d75bd2924e049b6a991f7c0c111068 upstream.
    
    The conversion from a look-up table to a calculation for clock generator
    parameters forgot to take into account that BRDV x 1/1 is valid only if
    BRPS is x 1/1 or x 1/2, leading to undefined behavior (e.g. arbitrary

    sched/cputime: Fix prev steal time accouting during CPU hotplug
    
    commit 3d89e5478bf550a50c99e93adf659369798263b0 upstream.
    
    Commit:
    
      e9532e69b8d1 ("sched/cputime: Fix steal time accounting vs. CPU hotplug")
    
    ... set rq->prev_* to 0 after a CPU hotplug comes back, in order to
    fix the case where (after CPU hotplug) steal time is smaller than
    rq->prev_steal_time.
    
    However, this should never happen. Steal time was only smaller because of the
    KVM-specific bug fixed by the previous patch.  Worse, the previous patch
    triggers a bug on CPU hot-unplug/plug operation: because
    rq->prev_steal_time is cleared, all of the CPU's past steal time will be
    accounted again on hot-plug.
    
    Since the root cause has been fixed, we can just revert commit e9532e69b8d1.

    mmc: tegra: Only advertise UHS modes if IO regulator is present
    
    commit 4f6aa3264af4d44caaa649dd3ff1fe98f5817251 upstream.
    
    To support UHS modes for Tegra an external regulator must be present
    to adjust the IO voltage accordingly. Even if the regulator is not
    present but the host supports the UHS modes and the device supports the
    UHS modes, then we will attempt to switch to a high-speed mode. Without
    an external regulator, Tegra will fail to switch to the high-speed
    mode.
    
    It has been found that with some SD cards, that once it has been switch
    to operate at a high-speed mode, all subsequent commands issues to the
    card will fail and so it will not be possible to switch back to a non
    high-speed mode and so the SD card initialisation will fail.
    
    The SDHCI core does not require that the host have an external regulator
    when switching to UHS modes and therefore, the Tegra SDHCI host
    controller should only advertise the UHS modes as being supported if the
    regulator for the IO voltage is present. Fortunately, Tegra has a vendor
    specific register which can be used to control which modes are
    advertised via the SDHCI_CAPABILITIES register. Hence, if there is no IO
    voltage regulator available for the Tegra SDHCI host, then don't
    advertise the UHS modes.
    
    Note that if the regulator is not available, we also don't advertise that
    the SDHCI is compatible with v3.0 of the SDHCI specification because
    this will read the SDHCI_CAPABILITIES_1 register which will enable other
    UHS modes.
    
    This fixes commit 7ad2ed1dfcbe ("mmc: tegra: enable UHS-I modes") which
    enables UHS mode without checking if the board can support them.

    perf/core: Use this_cpu_ptr() when stopping AUX events
    
    commit 8b6a3fe8fab97716990a3abde1a01fb5a34552a3 upstream.
    
    When tearing down an AUX buf for an event via perf_mmap_close(),
    __perf_event_output_stop() is called on the event's CPU to ensure that
    trace generation is halted before the process of unmapping and
    freeing the buffer pages begins.
    
    The callback is performed via cpu_function_call(), which ensures that it
    runs with interrupts disabled and is therefore not preemptible.
    Unfortunately, the current code grabs the per-cpu context pointer using
    get_cpu_ptr(), which unnecessarily disables preemption and doesn't pair
    the call with put_cpu_ptr(), leading to a preempt_count() imbalance and
    a BUG when freeing the AUX buffer later on:

    This patch uses this_cpu_ptr() instead of get_cpu_ptr(), since preemption is
    already disabled by the caller.

    rcuperf: Don't treat gp_exp mis-setting as a WARN
    
    commit af06d4f74a7d2132c805339bfd5ab771b5706f42 upstream.
    
    0day found a boot warning triggered in rcu_perf_writer() on !SMP kernel:
    
            WARN_ON(rcu_gp_is_normal() && gp_exp);
    
    , the root cause of which is trying to measure expedited grace
    periods(by setting gp_exp to true by default) when all the grace periods
    are normal(TINY RCU only has normal grace periods).
    
    However, such a mis-setting would only result in failing to measure the
    performance for a specific kind of grace periods, therefore using a
    WARN_ON to check this is a little overkilling. We could handle this
    inside rcuperf module via some error messages to tell users about the
    mis-settings.
    
    Therefore this patch removes the WARN_ON in rcu_perf_writer() and
    handles those checkings in rcu_perf_init() with plain if() code.
    
    Moreover, this patch changes the default value of gp_exp to 1) align
    with rcutorture tests and 2) make the default setting work for all RCU
    implementations by default.

    over the entire physical memory range (e.g.) Keystone 2 systems with 4GB RAM
    can only do DMA over the first 2GB. [K2E-EVM].
    
    What happens there is that without this patch SCSI layer sets a wrong
    bounce buffer limit in scsi_calculate_bounce_limit() for the USB mass
    storage device. dma_max_pfn() evaluates to 0x8fffff and bounce_limit
    is set to 0x8fffff000 whereas maximum DMA'ble physical memory on Keystone 2
    is 0x87fffffff. This results in non DMA'ble pages being given to the
    USB controller and hence the lock-up.
    
    NOTE: in the above case, USB-SCSI-device's dma_pfn_offset was showing as 0.
    This should have really been 0x780000 as on K2e, LOWMEM_START is 0x80000000
    and HIGHMEM_START is 0x800000000. DMA zone is 2GB so dma_max_pfn should be
    0x87ffff. The incorrect dma_pfn_offset for the USB storage device is because
    USB devices are not correctly inheriting the dma_pfn_offset from the
    USB host controller. This will be fixed by a separate patch.

    ARM: 8616/1: dt: Respect property size when parsing CPUs
    
    commit ba6dea4f7cedb4b1c17e36f4087675d817c2e24b upstream.
    
    Whilst MPIDR values themselves are less than 32 bits, it is still
    perfectly valid for a DT to have #address-cells > 1 in the CPUs node,
    resulting in the "reg" property having leading zero cell(s). In that
    situation, the big-endian nature of the data conspires with the current
    behaviour of only reading the first cell to cause the kernel to think
    all CPUs have ID 0, and become resoundingly unhappy as a consequence.
    
    Take the full property length into account when parsing CPUs so as to
    be correct under any circumstances.

    can: dev: fix deadlock reported after bus-off
    
    commit 9abefcb1aaa58b9d5aa40a8bb12c87d02415e4c8 upstream.
    
    A timer was used to restart after the bus-off state, leading to a
    relatively large can_restart() executed in an interrupt context,
    which in turn sets up pinctrl. When this happens during system boot,
    there is a high probability of grabbing the pinctrl_list_mutex,
    which is locked already by the probe() of other device, making the
    kernel suspect a deadlock condition [1].
    
    To resolve this issue, the restart_timer is replaced by a delayed
    work.

    mm,ksm: fix endless looping in allocating memory when ksm enable
    
    commit 5b398e416e880159fe55eefd93c6588fa072cd66 upstream.
    
    I hit the following hung task when runing a OOM LTP test case with 4.1
    kernel.
    
    Call trace:

    The oom victim cannot terminate because it needs to take mmap_sem for
    write while the lock is held by ksmd for read which loops in the page
    allocator
    
    ksm_do_scan
            scan_get_next_rmap_item
                    down_read
                    get_next_rmap_item
                            alloc_rmap_item   #ksmd will loop permanently.
    
    There is no way forward because the oom victim cannot release any memory
    in 4.1 based kernel.  Since 4.6 we have the oom reaper which would solve
    this problem because it would release the memory asynchronously.
    Nevertheless we can relax alloc_rmap_item requirements and use
    __GFP_NORETRY because the allocation failure is acceptable as ksm_do_scan
    would just retry later after the lock got dropped.
    
    Such a patch would be also easy to backport to older stable kernels which
    do not have oom_reaper.
    
    While we are at it add GFP_NOWARN so the admin doesn't have to be alarmed
    by the allocation failure.

    mtd: nand: davinci: Reinitialize the HW ECC engine in 4bit hwctl
    
    commit f6d7c1b5598b6407c3f1da795dd54acf99c1990c upstream.
    
    This fixes subpage writes when using 4-bit HW ECC.
    
    There has been numerous reports about ECC errors with devices using this
    driver for a while.  Also the 4-bit ECC has been reported as broken with
    subpages in [1] and with 16 bits NANDs in the driver and in mach* board
    files both in mainline and in the vendor BSPs.
    
    What I saw with 4-bit ECC on a 16bits NAND (on an LCDK) which got me to
    try reinitializing the ECC engine:
    - R/W on whole pages properly generates/checks RS code
    - try writing the 1st subpage only of a blank page, the subpage is well
      written and the RS code properly generated, re-reading the same page
      the HW detects some ECC error, reading the same page again no ECC
      error is detected
    
    Note that the ECC engine is already reinitialized in the 1-bit case.
    
    Tested on my LCDK with UBI+UBIFS using subpages.
    This could potentially get rid of the issue workarounded in [1].

    cgroup: fix invalid controller enable rejections with cgroup namespace
    
    commit 9157056da8f8c4a6305f15619e269f164b63a6de upstream.
    
    On the v2 hierarchy, "cgroup.subtree_control" rejects controller
    enables if the cgroup has processes in it.  The enforcement of this
    logic assumes that the cgroup wouldn't have any css_sets associated
    with it if there are no tasks in the cgroup, which is no longer true
    since a79a908fd2b0 ("cgroup: introduce cgroup namespaces").
    
    When a cgroup namespace is created, it pins the css_set of the
    creating task to use it as the root css_set of the namespace.  This
    extra reference stays as long as the namespace is around and makes
    "cgroup.subtree_control" think that the namespace root cgroup is not
    empty even when it is and thus reject controller enables.
    
    Fix it by making cgroup_subtree_control() walk and test emptiness of
    each css_set instead of testing whether the list_head is empty.
    
    While at it, update the comment of cgroup_task_count() to indicate
    that the returned value may be higher than the number of tasks, which
    has always been true due to temporary references and doesn't break
    anything.

    cpuset: handle race between CPU hotplug and cpuset_hotplug_work
    
    commit 28b89b9e6f7b6c8fef7b3af39828722bca20cfee upstream.
    
    A discrepancy between cpu_online_mask and cpuset's effective_cpus
    mask is inevitable during hotplug since cpuset defers updating of
    effective_cpus mask using a workqueue, during which time nothing
    prevents the system from more hotplug operations.  For that reason
    guarantee_online_cpus() walks up the cpuset hierarchy until it finds
    an intersection under the assumption that top cpuset's effective_cpus
    mask intersects with cpu_online_mask even with such a race occurring.
    
    However a sequence of CPU hotplugs can open a time window, during which
    none of the effective CPUs in the top cpuset intersect with
    cpu_online_mask.
    
    For example when there are 4 possible CPUs 0-3 and only CPU0 is online:
    
      ========================  ===========================
       cpu_online_mask           top_cpuset.effective_cpus
      ========================  ===========================
       echo 1 > cpu2/online.
       CPU hotplug notifier woke up hotplug work but not yet scheduled.
          [0,2]                     [0]
    
       echo 0 > cpu0/online.
       The workqueue is still runnable.
          [2]                       [0]
      ========================  ===========================
    
      Now there is no intersection between cpu_online_mask and
      top_cpuset.effective_cpus.  Thus invoking sys_sched_setaffinity() at
      this moment can cause following:
    
       Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000d0

    The top cpuset's effective_cpus are guaranteed to be identical to
    cpu_online_mask eventually.  Hence fall back to cpu_online_mask when
    there is no intersection between top cpuset's effective_cpus and
