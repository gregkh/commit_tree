    perf symbols: Fix debuginfo search for Ubuntu
    
    commit 85afd35575a3c1a3a905722dde5ee70b49282e70 upstream.
    
    Reportedly, from 19.10 Ubuntu has begun mixing up the location of some
    debug symbol files, putting files expected to be in
    /usr/lib/debug/usr/lib into /usr/lib/debug/lib instead. Fix by adding
    another dso_binary_type.
    
    Example on Ubuntu 20.04
    
      Before:
    
        $ perf record -e intel_pt//u uname
        Linux
        [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
        [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.030 MB perf.data ]
        $ perf script --call-trace | head -5
               uname 14003 [005] 15321.764958566:  cbr: 42 freq: 4219 MHz (156%)

    perf probe: Do not show the skipped events
    
    commit f41ebe9defacddeae96a872a33f0f22ced0bfcef upstream.
    
    When a probe point is expanded to several places (like inlined) and if
    some of them are skipped because of blacklisted or __init function,
    those trace_events has no event name. It must be skipped while showing
    results.
    
    Without this fix, you can see "(null):(null)" on the list,
    
      # ./perf probe request_resource
      reserve_setup is out of .text, skip it.
      Added new events:
        (null):(null)        (on request_resource)
        probe:request_resource (on request_resource)
    
      You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:
    
            perf record -e probe:request_resource -aR sleep 1
    
      #
    
    With this fix, it is ignored:
    
      # ./perf probe request_resource
      reserve_setup is out of .text, skip it.
      Added new events:
        probe:request_resource (on request_resource)

    mtd: rawnand: pasemi: Fix the probe error path
    
    commit f51466901c07e6930435d30b02a21f0841174f61 upstream.
    
    nand_cleanup() is supposed to be called on error after a successful
    call to nand_scan() to free all NAND resources.
    
    There is no real Fixes tag applying here as the use of nand_release()
    in this driver predates by far the introduction of nand_cleanup() in
    commit d44154f969a4 ("mtd: nand: Provide nand_cleanup() function to free NAND related resources")
    which makes this change possible, hence pointing it as the commit to
    fix for backporting purposes, even if this commit is not introducing
    any bug.

    sunrpc: clean up properly in gss_mech_unregister()
    
    commit 24c5efe41c29ee3e55bcf5a1c9f61ca8709622e8 upstream.
    
    gss_mech_register() calls svcauth_gss_register_pseudoflavor() for each
    flavour, but gss_mech_unregister() does not call auth_domain_put().
    This is unbalanced and makes it impossible to reload the module.
    
    Change svcauth_gss_register_pseudoflavor() to return the registered
    auth_domain, and save it for later release.

    sunrpc: svcauth_gss_register_pseudoflavor must reject duplicate registrations.
    
    commit d47a5dc2888fd1b94adf1553068b8dad76cec96c upstream.
    
    There is no valid case for supporting duplicate pseudoflavor
    registrations.
    Currently the silent acceptance of such registrations is hiding a bug.
    The rpcsec_gss_krb5 module registers 2 flavours but does not unregister
    them, so if you load, unload, reload the module, it will happily
    continue to use the old registration which now has pointers to the
    memory were the module was originally loaded.  This could lead to
    unexpected results.
    
    So disallow duplicate registrations.

    commit 4b50c8c4eaf06a825d1c005c0b1b4a8307087b83 upstream.
    
    This code does not work as stated in the comment.
    
    $(CONFIG_MODVERSIONS) is always empty because it is expanded before
    include/config/auto.conf is included. Hence, 'make modules' with
    CONFIG_MODVERSION=y cannot record the version CRCs.
    
    This has been broken since 2003, commit ("kbuild: Enable modules to be

    drivers/macintosh: Fix memleak in windfarm_pm112 driver
    
    commit 93900337b9ac2f4eca427eff6d187be2dc3b5551 upstream.
    
    create_cpu_loop() calls smu_sat_get_sdb_partition() which does
    kmalloc() and returns the allocated buffer. In fact it's called twice,
    and neither buffer is freed.
    
    This results in a memory leak as reported by Erhard:

    ARM: tegra: Correct PL310 Auxiliary Control Register initialization

    The PL310 Auxiliary Control Register shouldn't have the "Full line of
    zero" optimization bit being set before L2 cache is enabled. The L2X0
    driver takes care of enabling the optimization by itself.

    that cache optimization is erroneously enabled without enabling it for
    the CPU:

    kernel/cpu_pm: Fix uninitted local in cpu_pm
    
    commit b5945214b76a1f22929481724ffd448000ede914 upstream.
    
    cpu_pm_notify() is basically a wrapper of notifier_call_chain().
    notifier_call_chain() doesn't initialize *nr_calls to 0 before it
    starts incrementing it--presumably it's up to the callers to do this.
    
    Unfortunately the callers of cpu_pm_notify() don't init *nr_calls.
    This potentially means you could get too many or two few calls to
    CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED or CPU_CLUSTER_PM_ENTER_FAILED depending on the
    luck of the stack.
    
    Let's fix this.

    However, access to caller's memory (storing the result in
    genregs32_get(), fetching the new values in case of genregs32_set())
    should be done by normal uaccess primitives.

    commit cf51e129b96847f969bfb8af1ee1516a01a70b39 upstream.
    
    It needs access_process_vm() if the traced process does not share
    mm with the caller.  Solution is similar to what sparc64 does.
    Note that genregs32_set() is only ever called with pos being 0
    or 32 * sizeof(u32) (the latter - as part of PTRACE_SETREGS
    handling).

    pinctrl: samsung: Save/restore eint_mask over suspend for EINT_TYPE GPIOs
    
    commit f354157a7d184db430c1a564c506434e33b1bec5 upstream.
    
    Currently, for EINT_TYPE GPIOs, the CON and FLTCON registers
    are saved and restored over a suspend/resume cycle.  However, the
    EINT_MASK registers are not.
    
    On S5PV210 at the very least, these registers are not retained over
    suspend, leading to the interrupts remaining masked upon resume and
    therefore no interrupts being triggered for the device.  There should
    be no effect on any SoCs that do retain these registers as theoretically
    we would just be re-writing what was already there.

    ".suppress_bind_attrs = true" to prevent userspace from doing something

    igb: Report speed and duplex as unknown when device is runtime suspended
    
    commit 165ae7a8feb53dc47fb041357e4b253bfc927cf9 upstream.
    
    igb device gets runtime suspended when there's no link partner. We can't
    get correct speed under that state:
    $ cat /sys/class/net/enp3s0/speed
    1000
    
    In addition to that, an error can also be spotted in dmesg:
    [  385.991957] igb 0000:03:00.0 enp3s0: PCIe link lost
    
    Since device can only be runtime suspended when there's no link partner,
    we can skip reading register and let the following logic set speed and
    duplex with correct status.
    
    The more generic approach will be wrap get_link_ksettings() with begin()
    and complete() callbacks. However, for this particular issue, begin()
    calls igb_runtime_resume() , which tries to rtnl_lock() while the lock
    is already hold by upper ethtool layer.
    
    So let's take this approach until the igb_runtime_resume() no longer
    needs to hold rtnl_lock.

    b43_legacy: Fix connection problem with WPA3
    
    commit 6a29d134c04a8acebb7a95251acea7ad7abba106 upstream.
    
    Since the driver was first introduced into the kernel, it has only
    handled the ciphers associated with WEP, WPA, and WPA2. It fails with
    WPA3 even though mac80211 can handle those additional ciphers in software,
    b43legacy did not report that it could handle them. By setting MFP_CAPABLE using
    ieee80211_set_hw(), the problem is fixed.
    
    With this change, b43legacy will handle the ciphers it knows in hardware,
    and let mac80211 handle the others in software. It is not necessary to
    use the module parameter NOHWCRYPT to turn hardware encryption off.
    Although this change essentially eliminates that module parameter,
    I am choosing to keep it for cases where the hardware is broken,
    and software encryption is required for all ciphers.

    b43legacy: Fix case where channel status is corrupted
    
    commit ec4d3e3a054578de34cd0b587ab8a1ac36f629d9 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes commit 75388acd0cd8 ("add mac80211-based driver for
    legacy BCM43xx devices")
    
    In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=207093, a defect in
    b43legacy is reported. Upon testing, thus problem exists on PPC and
    X86 platforms, is present in the oldest kernel tested (3.2), and
    has been present in the driver since it was first added to the kernel.
    
    The problem is a corrupted channel status received from the device.
    Both the internal card in a PowerBook G4 and the PCMCIA version
    (Broadcom BCM4306 with PCI ID 14e4:4320) have the problem. Only Rev, 2
    (revision 4 of the 802.11 core) of the chip has been tested. No other
    devices using b43legacy are available for testing.
    
    Various sources of the problem were considered. Buffer overrun and
    other sources of corruption within the driver were rejected because
    the faulty channel status is always the same, not a random value.
    It was concluded that the faulty data is coming from the device, probably
    due to a firmware bug. As that source is not available, the driver
    must take appropriate action to recover.
    
    At present, the driver reports the error, and them continues to process
    the bad packet. This is believed that to be a mistake, and the correct
    action is to drop the correpted packet.

    e1000e: Relax condition to trigger reset for ME workaround
    
    commit d601afcae2febc49665008e9a79e701248d56c50 upstream.
    
    It's an error if the value of the RX/TX tail descriptor does not match
    what was written. The error condition is true regardless the duration
    of the interference from ME. But the driver only performs the reset if
    E1000_ICH_FWSM_PCIM2PCI_COUNT (2000) iterations of 50us delay have
    transpired. The extra condition can lead to inconsistency between the
    state of hardware as expected by the driver.
    
    Fix this by dropping the check for number of delay iterations.
    
    While at it, also make __ew32_prepare() static as it's not used
    anywhere else.

    PCI: Program MPS for RCiEP devices
    
    commit aa0ce96d72dd2e1b0dfd0fb868f82876e7790878 upstream.
    
    Root Complex Integrated Endpoints (RCiEPs) do not have an upstream bridge,
    so pci_configure_mps() previously ignored them, which may result in reduced
    performance.
    
    Instead, program the Max_Payload_Size of RCiEPs to the maximum supported
    value (unless it is limited for the PCIE_BUS_PEER2PEER case).  This also
    affects the subsequent programming of Max_Read_Request_Size because Linux
    programs MRRS based on the MPS value.

    _blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues, just after freezing queues.
    
    In the backport this landed (in blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues instead),
    just after unfreezeing queues.

    btrfs: fix error handling when submitting direct I/O bio
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d3113a193e3385c72240096fe397618ecab6e43 ]
    
    In btrfs_submit_direct_hook(), if a direct I/O write doesn't span a RAID
    stripe or chunk, we submit orig_bio without cloning it. In this case, we
    don't increment pending_bios. Then, if btrfs_submit_dio_bio() fails, we
    decrement pending_bios to -1, and we never complete orig_bio. Fix it by
    initializing pending_bios to 1 instead of incrementing later.
    
    Fixing this exposes another bug: we put orig_bio prematurely and then
    put it again from end_io. Fix it by not putting orig_bio.
    
    After this change, pending_bios is really more of a reference count, but
    I'll leave that cleanup separate to keep the fix small.

    ext4: fix race between ext4_sync_parent() and rename()
    
    commit 08adf452e628b0e2ce9a01048cfbec52353703d7 upstream.
    
    'igrab(d_inode(dentry->d_parent))' without holding dentry->d_lock is
    broken because without d_lock, d_parent can be concurrently changed due
    to a rename().  Then if the old directory is immediately deleted, old
    d_parent->inode can be NULL.  That causes a NULL dereference in igrab().
    
    To fix this, use dget_parent() to safely grab a reference to the parent
    dentry, which pins the inode.  This also eliminates the need to use
    d_find_any_alias() other than for the initial inode, as we no longer
    throw away the dentry at each step.
    
    This is an extremely hard race to hit, but it is possible.  Adding a
    udelay() in between the reads of ->d_parent and its ->d_inode makes it
    reproducible on a no-journal filesystem using the following program:
    
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <unistd.h>
    
        int main()
        {
            if (fork()) {
                for (;;) {
                    mkdir("dir1", 0700);

                    write(fd, "X", 1);
                    close(fd);
                }

    commit 067a436b1b0aafa593344fddd711a755a58afb3b upstream.
    
    This patch prevents the following oops:

    It occurs when there is a failure during IMA initialization, and
    ima_init_policy() is not called. IMA hooks still call ima_match_policy()
    but ima_rules is NULL. This patch prevents the crash by directly assigning
    the ima_default_policy pointer to ima_rules when ima_rules is defined. This
    wouldn't alter the existing behavior, as ima_rules is always set at the end
    of ima_init_policy().

    ima: Fix ima digest hash table key calculation
    
    commit 1129d31b55d509f15e72dc68e4b5c3a4d7b4da8d upstream.
    
    Function hash_long() accepts unsigned long, while currently only one byte
    is passed from ima_hash_key(), which calculates a key for ima_htable.
    
    Given that hashing the digest does not give clear benefits compared to
    using the digest itself, remove hash_long() and return the modulus
    calculated on the first two bytes of the digest with the number of slots.
    Also reduce the depth of the hash table by doubling the number of slots.

    mm: thp: make the THP mapcount atomic against __split_huge_pmd_locked()
    
    commit c444eb564fb16645c172d550359cb3d75fe8a040 upstream.
    
    Write protect anon page faults require an accurate mapcount to decide
    if to break the COW or not. This is implemented in the THP path with
    reuse_swap_page() ->
    page_trans_huge_map_swapcount()/page_trans_huge_mapcount().
    
    If the COW triggers while the other processes sharing the page are
    under a huge pmd split, to do an accurate reading, we must ensure the
    mapcount isn't computed while it's being transferred from the head
    page to the tail pages.
    
    reuse_swap_cache() already runs serialized by the page lock, so it's
    enough to add the page lock around __split_huge_pmd_locked too, in
    order to add the missing serialization.
    
    Note: the commit in "Fixes" is just to facilitate the backporting,
    because the code before such commit didn't try to do an accurate THP
    mapcount calculation and it instead used the page_count() to decide if
    to COW or not. Both the page_count and the pin_count are THP-wide
    refcounts, so they're inaccurate if used in
    reuse_swap_page(). Reverting such commit (besides the unrelated fix to
    the local anon_vma assignment) would have also opened the window for
    memory corruption side effects to certain workloads as documented in
    such commit header.

    btrfs: send: emit file capabilities after chown
    
    commit 89efda52e6b6930f80f5adda9c3c9edfb1397191 upstream.
    
    Whenever a chown is executed, all capabilities of the file being touched
    are lost.  When doing incremental send with a file with capabilities,
    there is a situation where the capability can be lost on the receiving
    side. The sequence of actions bellow shows the problem:
    
      $ mount /dev/sda fs1
      $ mount /dev/sdb fs2
    
      $ touch fs1/foo.bar
      $ setcap cap_sys_nice+ep fs1/foo.bar
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap_init
      $ btrfs send fs1/snap_init | btrfs receive fs2
    
      $ chgrp adm fs1/foo.bar
      $ setcap cap_sys_nice+ep fs1/foo.bar
    
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap_complete
      $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap_incremental
    
      $ btrfs send fs1/snap_complete | btrfs receive fs2
      $ btrfs send -p fs1/snap_init fs1/snap_incremental | btrfs receive fs2
    
    At this point, only a chown was emitted by "btrfs send" since only the
    group was changed. This makes the cap_sys_nice capability to be dropped
    from fs2/snap_incremental/foo.bar
    
    To fix that, only emit capabilities after chown is emitted. The current
    code first checks for xattrs that are new/changed, emits them, and later
    emit the chown. Now, __process_new_xattr skips capabilities, letting
    only finish_inode_if_needed to emit them, if they exist, for the inode
    being processed.
    
    This behavior was being worked around in "btrfs receive" side by caching
    the capability and only applying it after chown. Now, xattrs are only
    emmited _after_ chown, making that workaround not needed anymore.

    spi: dw: Return any value retrieved from the dma_transfer callback
    
    [ Upstream commit f0410bbf7d0fb80149e3b17d11d31f5b5197873e ]
    
    DW APB SSI DMA-part of the driver may need to perform the requested
    SPI-transfer synchronously. In that case the dma_transfer() callback
    will return 0 as a marker of the SPI transfer being finished so the
    SPI core doesn't need to wait and may proceed with the SPI message
    trasnfers pumping procedure. This will be needed to fix the problem
    when DMA transactions are finished, but there is still data left in
    the SPI Tx/Rx FIFOs being sent/received. But for now make dma_transfer
    to return 1 as the normal dw_spi_transfer_one() method.

    staging: greybus: sdio: Respect the cmd->busy_timeout from the mmc core
    
    [ Upstream commit a389087ee9f195fcf2f31cd771e9ec5f02c16650 ]
    
    Using a fixed 1s timeout for all commands is a bit problematic.
    
    For some commands it means waiting longer than needed for the timeout to
    expire, which may not a big issue, but still. For other commands, like for
    an erase (CMD38) that uses a R1B response, may require longer timeouts than
    1s. In these cases, we may end up treating the command as it failed, while
    it just needed some more time to complete successfully.
    
    Fix the problem by respecting the cmd->busy_timeout, which is provided by
    the mmc core.

    mips: Add udelay lpj numbers adjustment
    
    [ Upstream commit ed26aacfb5f71eecb20a51c4467da440cb719d66 ]
    
    Loops-per-jiffies is a special number which represents a number of
    noop-loop cycles per CPU-scheduler quantum - jiffies. As you
    understand aside from CPU-specific implementation it depends on
    the CPU frequency. So when a platform has the CPU frequency fixed,
    we have no problem and the current udelay interface will work
    just fine. But as soon as CPU-freq driver is enabled and the cores
    frequency changes, we'll end up with distorted udelay's. In order
    to fix this we have to accordinly adjust the per-CPU udelay_val
    (the same as the global loops_per_jiffy) number. This can be done
    in the CPU-freq transition event handler. We subscribe to that event
    in the MIPS arch time-inititalization method.

    x86/boot: Correct relocation destination on old linkers
    
    [ Upstream commit 5214028dd89e49ba27007c3ee475279e584261f0 ]
    
    For the 32-bit kernel, as described in
    
      6d92bc9d483a ("x86/build: Build compressed x86 kernels as PIE"),
    
    pre-2.26 binutils generates R_386_32 relocations in PIE mode. Since the
    startup code does not perform relocation, any reloc entry with R_386_32
    will remain as 0 in the executing code.
    
    Commit
    
      974f221c84b0 ("x86/boot: Move compressed kernel to the end of the
                     decompression buffer")
    
    added a new symbol _end but did not mark it hidden, which doesn't give
    the correct offset on older linkers. This causes the compressed kernel
    to be copied beyond the end of the decompression buffer, rather than
    flush against it. This region of memory may be reserved or already
    allocated for other purposes by the bootloader.
    
    Mark _end as hidden to fix. This changes the relocation from R_386_32 to
    R_386_RELATIVE even on the pre-2.26 binutils.
    
    For 64-bit, this is not strictly necessary, as the 64-bit kernel is only
    built as PIE if the linker supports -z noreloc-overflow, which implies
    binutils-2.27+, but for consistency, mark _end as hidden here too.
    
    The below illustrates the before/after impact of the patch using
    binutils-2.25 and gcc-4.6.4 (locally compiled from source) and QEMU.

    mwifiex: Fix memory corruption in dump_station
    
    [ Upstream commit 3aa42bae9c4d1641aeb36f1a8585cd1d506cf471 ]
    
    The mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_station() uses static variable for iterating
    over a linked list of all associated stations (when the driver is in UAP
    role). This has a race condition if .dump_station is called in parallel
    for multiple interfaces. This corruption can be triggered by registering
    multiple SSIDs and calling, in parallel for multiple interfaces
        iw dev <iface> station dump

    This patch drops the use of the static iterator, and instead every time
    the function is called iterates to the idx-th position of the
    linked-list.
    
    It would be better to convert the code not to use linked list for
    associated stations storage (since the chip has a limited number of
    associated stations anyway - it could just be an array). Such a change
    may be proposed in the future. In the meantime this patch can backported
    into stable kernels in this simple form.

    rtlwifi: Fix a double free in _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup()
    
    [ Upstream commit beb12813bc75d4a23de43b85ad1c7cb28d27631e ]
    
    Seven years ago we tried to fix a leak but actually introduced a double
    free instead.  It was an understandable mistake because the code was a
    bit confusing and the free was done in the wrong place.  The "skb"
    pointer is freed in both _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup() and _rtl_usb_transmit().
    The free belongs _rtl_usb_transmit() instead of _rtl_usb_tx_urb_setup()
    and I've cleaned the code up a bit to hopefully make it more clear.

    the flush is necessary to avoid race condition, so leave it as it is.

    kgdb: Fix spurious true from in_dbg_master()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3fec4aecb311995189217e64d725cfe84a568de3 ]
    
    Currently there is a small window where a badly timed migration could
    cause in_dbg_master() to spuriously return true. Specifically if we
    migrate to a new core after reading the processor id and the previous
    core takes a breakpoint then we will evaluate true if we read
    kgdb_active before we get the IPI to bring us to halt.
    
    Fix this by checking irqs_disabled() first. Interrupts are always
    disabled when we are executing the kgdb trap so this is an acceptable
    prerequisite. This also allows us to replace raw_smp_processor_id()
    with smp_processor_id() since the short circuit logic will prevent
    warnings from PREEMPT_DEBUG.

    mips: cm: Fix an invalid error code of INTVN_*_ERR
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a0efb8b101665a843205eab3d67ab09cb2d9a8d ]
    
    Commit 3885c2b463f6 ("MIPS: CM: Add support for reporting CM cache
    errors") adds cm2_causes[] array with map of error type ID and
    pointers to the short description string. There is a mistake in
    the table, since according to MIPS32 manual CM2_ERROR_TYPE = {17,18}
    correspond to INTVN_WR_ERR and INTVN_RD_ERR, while the table
    claims they have {0x17,0x18} codes. This is obviously hex-dec
    copy-paste bug. Moreover codes {0x18 - 0x1a} indicate L2 ECC errors.

    while bfd will strip 64bit address into 32bit silently.

    [ Upstream commit 88413a6bfbbe2f648df399b62f85c934460b7a4d ]
    
    Currently, we may perform a copy_to_user (through
    simple_read_from_buffer()) while holding a context's register_lock,
    while accessing the context save area.
    
    This change uses a temporary buffer for the context save area data,
    which we then pass to simple_read_from_buffer.

    exit: Move preemption fixup up, move blocking operations down
    
    [ Upstream commit 586b58cac8b4683eb58a1446fbc399de18974e40 ]
    
    With CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y and CONFIG_CGROUPS=y, kernel oopses in
    non-preemptible context look untidy; after the main oops, the kernel prints
    a "sleeping function called from invalid context" report because
    exit_signals() -> cgroup_threadgroup_change_begin() -> percpu_down_read()
    can sleep, and that happens before the preempt_count_set(PREEMPT_ENABLED)
    fixup.
    
    It looks like the same thing applies to profile_task_exit() and
    kcov_task_exit().
    
    Fix it by moving the preemption fixup up and the calls to
    profile_task_exit() and kcov_task_exit() down.

    This special case for umul_ppmm for MIPS64r6 was added in
    commit bbc25bee37d2b ("lib/mpi: Fix umul_ppmm() for MIPS64r6"), due to
    GCC being inefficient and emitting a __multi3 intrinsic.
    
    There is no such issue with clang; with this patch applied, I can build
    this configuration without any problems and there are no link errors
    like mentioned in the commit above (which I can still reproduce with
    GCC 9.3.0 when that commit is reverted). Only use this definition when
    GCC is being used.
    
    This really should have been caught by commit b0c091ae04f67 ("lib/mpi:
    Eliminate unused umul_ppmm definitions for MIPS") when I was messing
    around in this area but I was not testing 64-bit MIPS at the time.

    MIPS: Make sparse_init() using top-down allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit 269b3a9ac538c4ae87f84be640b9fa89914a2489 ]
    
    In the current code, if CONFIG_SWIOTLB is set, when failed to get IO TLB
    memory from the low pages by plat_swiotlb_setup(), it may lead to the boot
    process failed with kernel panic.
    
    (1) On the Loongson and SiByte platform
    arch/mips/loongson64/dma.c
    arch/mips/sibyte/common/dma.c
    void __init plat_swiotlb_setup(void)
    {
            swiotlb_init(1);
    }
    
    kernel/dma/swiotlb.c
    void  __init
    swiotlb_init(int verbose)
    {
    ...
            vstart = memblock_alloc_low(PAGE_ALIGN(bytes), PAGE_SIZE);
            if (vstart && !swiotlb_init_with_tbl(vstart, io_tlb_nslabs, verbose))
                    return;
    ...
            pr_warn("Cannot allocate buffer");
            no_iotlb_memory = true;
    }
    
    phys_addr_t swiotlb_tbl_map_single()
    {
    ...
            if (no_iotlb_memory)
                    panic("Can not allocate SWIOTLB buffer earlier ...");
    ...
    }
    
    (2) On the Cavium OCTEON platform
    arch/mips/cavium-octeon/dma-octeon.c
    void __init plat_swiotlb_setup(void)
    {
    ...
            octeon_swiotlb = memblock_alloc_low(swiotlbsize, PAGE_SIZE);
            if (!octeon_swiotlb)
                    panic("%s: Failed to allocate %zu bytes align=%lx\n",
                          __func__, swiotlbsize, PAGE_SIZE);
    ...
    }
    
    Because IO_TLB_DEFAULT_SIZE is 64M, if the rest size of low memory is less
    than 64M when call plat_swiotlb_setup(), we can easily reproduce the panic
    case.
    
    In order to reduce the possibility of kernel panic when failed to get IO
    TLB memory under CONFIG_SWIOTLB, it is better to allocate low memory as
    small as possible before plat_swiotlb_setup(), so make sparse_init() using
    top-down allocation.

    media: platform: fcp: Set appropriate DMA parameters
    
    [ Upstream commit dd844fb8e50b12e65bbdc5746c9876c6735500df ]
    
    Enabling CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG=y and CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG_SG=y will
    enable extra validation on DMA operations ensuring that the size
    restraints are met.
    
    When using the FCP in conjunction with the VSP1/DU, and display frames,
    the size of the DMA operations is larger than the default maximum
    segment size reported by the DMA core (64K). With the DMA debug enabled,
    this produces a warning such as the following:
    
    "DMA-API: rcar-fcp fea27000.fcp: mapping sg segment longer than device
    claims to support [len=3145728] [max=65536]"
    
    We have no specific limitation on the segment size which isn't already
    handled by the VSP1/DU which actually handles the DMA allcoations and
    buffer management, so define a maximum segment size of up to 4GB (a 32
    bit mask).

    e1000: Distribute switch variables for initialization
    
    [ Upstream commit a34c7f5156654ebaf7eaace102938be7ff7036cb ]
    
    Variables declared in a switch statement before any case statements
    cannot be automatically initialized with compiler instrumentation (as
    they are not part of any execution flow). With GCC's proposed automatic
    stack variable initialization feature, this triggers a warning (and they
    don't get initialized). Clang's automatic stack variable initialization
    (via CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL=y) doesn't throw a warning, but it also
    doesn't initialize such variables[1]. Note that these warnings (or silent
    skipping) happen before the dead-store elimination optimization phase,
    so even when the automatic initializations are later elided in favor of
    direct initializations, the warnings remain.
    
    To avoid these problems, move such variables into the "case" where
    they're used or lift them up into the main function body.

    net: vmxnet3: fix possible buffer overflow caused by bad DMA value in vmxnet3_get_rss()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e1c6846b9e108740ef8a37be80314053f5dd52a ]
    
    The value adapter->rss_conf is stored in DMA memory, and it is assigned
    to rssConf, so rssConf->indTableSize can be modified at anytime by
    malicious hardware. Because rssConf->indTableSize is assigned to n,
    buffer overflow may occur when the code "rssConf->indTable[n]" is
    executed.
    
    To fix this possible bug, n is checked after being used.

    x86/kvm/hyper-v: Explicitly align hcall param for kvm_hyperv_exit
    
    [ Upstream commit f7d31e65368aeef973fab788aa22c4f1d5a6af66 ]
    
    The problem the patch is trying to address is the fact that 'struct
    kvm_hyperv_exit' has different layout on when compiling in 32 and 64 bit
    modes.
    
    In 64-bit mode the default alignment boundary is 64 bits thus
    forcing extra gaps after 'type' and 'msr' but in 32-bit mode the
    boundary is at 32 bits thus no extra gaps.
    
    This is an issue as even when the kernel is 64 bit, the userspace using
    the interface can be both 32 and 64 bit but the same 32 bit userspace has
    to work with 32 bit kernel.
    
    The issue is fixed by forcing the 64 bit layout, this leads to ABI
    change for 32 bit builds and while we are obviously breaking '32 bit
    userspace with 32 bit kernel' case, we're fixing the '32 bit userspace
    with 64 bit kernel' one.
    
    As the interface has no (known) users and 32 bit KVM is rather baroque
    nowadays, this seems like a reasonable decision.

    ARM: 8978/1: mm: make act_mm() respect THREAD_SIZE
    
    [ Upstream commit e1de94380af588bdf6ad6f0cc1f75004c35bc096 ]
    
    Recent work with KASan exposed the folling hard-coded bitmask
    in arch/arm/mm/proc-macros.S:
    
      bic     rd, sp, #8128
      bic     rd, rd, #63
    
    This forms the bitmask 0x1FFF that is coinciding with
    (PAGE_SIZE << THREAD_SIZE_ORDER) - 1, this code was assuming
    that THREAD_SIZE is always 8K (8192).
    
    As KASan was increasing THREAD_SIZE_ORDER to 2, I ran into
    this bug.
    
    Fix it by this little oneline suggested by Ard:
    
      bic     rd, sp, #(THREAD_SIZE - 1) & ~63
    
    Where THREAD_SIZE is defined using THREAD_SIZE_ORDER.
    
    We have to also include <linux/const.h> since the THREAD_SIZE
    expands to use the _AC() macro.

    btrfs: do not ignore error from btrfs_next_leaf() when inserting checksums
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e4a3f7ed5d54926ec671bbb13e171cfe179cc50 ]
    
    We are currently treating any non-zero return value from btrfs_next_leaf()
    the same way, by going to the code that inserts a new checksum item in the
    tree. However if btrfs_next_leaf() returns an error (a value < 0), we
    should just stop and return the error, and not behave as if nothing has
    happened, since in that case we do not have a way to know if there is a
    next leaf or we are currently at the last leaf already.
    
    So fix that by returning the error from btrfs_next_leaf().

    clocksource: dw_apb_timer_of: Fix missing clockevent timers
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d2e16a3181bafb77b535095c39ad1c8b9558c8c ]
    
    Commit 100214889973 ("clocksource: dw_apb_timer_of: use
    clocksource_of_init") replaced a publicly available driver
    initialization method with one called by the timer_probe() method
    available after CLKSRC_OF. In current implementation it traverses
    all the timers available in the system and calls their initialization
    methods if corresponding devices were either in dtb or in acpi. But
    if before the commit any number of available timers would be installed
    as clockevent and clocksource devices, after that there would be at most
    two. The rest are just ignored since default case branch doesn't do
    anything. I don't see a reason of such behaviour, neither the commit
    message explains it. Moreover this might be wrong if on some platforms
    these timers might be used for different purpose, as virtually CPU-local
    clockevent timers and as an independent broadcast timer. So in order
    to keep the compatibility with the platforms where the order of the
    timers detection has some meaning, lets add the secondly discovered
    timer to be of clocksource/sched_clock type, while the very first and
    the others would provide the clockevents service.

    It's pointless to track the Tx overrun interrupts if Rx-only SPI

    So lets unmask the interrupts only if corresponding SPI

    kgdb: Prevent infinite recursive entries to the debugger
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ca676e4ca60d1834bb77535dafe24169cadacef ]
    
    If we detect that we recursively entered the debugger we should hack
    our I/O ops to NULL so that the panic() in the next line won't
    actually cause another recursion into the debugger.  The first line of
    kgdb_panic() will check this and return.

    Bluetooth: Add SCO fallback for invalid LMP parameters error
    
    [ Upstream commit 56b5453a86203a44726f523b4133c1feca49ce7c ]
    
    Bluetooth PTS test case HFP/AG/ACC/BI-12-I accepts SCO connection
    with invalid parameter at the first SCO request expecting AG to
    attempt another SCO request with the use of "safe settings" for
    given codec, base on section 5.7.1.2 of HFP 1.7 specification.
    
    This patch addresses it by adding "Invalid LMP Parameters" (0x1e)
    to the SCO fallback case. Verified with below log:

    Commit ea6f3af4c5e63f69 ("ACPI: GED: add support for _Exx / _Lxx handler
    methods") added a reference to the 'triggering' field of either the
    normal or the extended ACPI IRQ resource struct, but inadvertently used
    the wrong pointer in the latter case. Note that both pointers refer to the
    same union, and the 'triggering' field appears at the same offset in both
    struct types, so it currently happens to work by accident. But let's fix
    it nonetheless

    The fe_status variable s is not initialized meaning it can have any
    random garbage status.  This could be problematic if fe->ops.tune is
    false as s is not updated by the call to fe->ops.tune() and a
    subsequent check on the change status will using a garbage value.
    Fix this by adding FE_NONE to the enum fe_status and initializing
    s to this.

    agp/intel: Reinforce the barrier after GTT updates
    
    commit f30d3ced9fafa03e4855508929b5b6334907f45e upstream.
    
    After changing the timing between GTT updates and execution on the GPU,
    we started seeing sporadic failures on Ironlake. These were narrowed
    down to being an insufficiently strong enough barrier/delay after
    updating the GTT and scheduling execution on the GPU. By forcing the
    uncached read, and adding the missing barrier for the singular
    insert_page (relocation paths), the sporadic failures go away.

    perf: Add cond_resched() to task_function_call()
    
    commit 2ed6edd33a214bca02bd2b45e3fc3038a059436b upstream.
    
    Under rare circumstances, task_function_call() can repeatedly fail and
    cause a soft lockup.
    
    There is a slight race where the process is no longer running on the cpu
    we targeted by the time remote_function() runs.  The code will simply
    try again.  If we are very unlucky, this will continue to fail, until a
    watchdog fires.  This can happen in a heavily loaded, multi-core virtual
    machine.

    mm/slub: fix a memory leak in sysfs_slab_add()
    
    commit dde3c6b72a16c2db826f54b2d49bdea26c3534a2 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reports for memory leak when kobject_init_and_add() returns an
    error in the function sysfs_slab_add() [1]
    
    When this happened, the function kobject_put() is not called for the
    corresponding kobject, which potentially leads to memory leak.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by calling kobject_put() even if
    kobject_init_and_add() fails.
    
    [1]

    KVM: arm64: Make vcpu_cp1x() work on Big Endian hosts
    
    commit 3204be4109ad681523e3461ce64454c79278450a upstream.
    
    AArch32 CP1x registers are overlayed on their AArch64 counterparts
    in the vcpu struct. This leads to an interesting problem as they
    are stored in their CPU-local format, and thus a CP1x register
    doesn't "hit" the lower 32bit portion of the AArch64 register on
    a BE host.
    
    To workaround this unfortunate situation, introduce a bias trick
    in the vcpu_cp1x() accessors which picks the correct half of the
    64bit register.

    KVM: MIPS: Fix VPN2_MASK definition for variable cpu_vmbits
    
    commit 5816c76dea116a458f1932eefe064e35403248eb upstream.
    
    If a CPU support more than 32bit vmbits (which is true for 64bit CPUs),
    VPN2_MASK set to fixed 0xffffe000 will lead to a wrong EntryHi in some
    functions such as _kvm_mips_host_tlb_inv().
    
    The cpu_vmbits definition of 32bit CPU in cpu-features.h is 31, so we
    still use the old definition.

    commit fe2b73dba47fb6d6922df1ad44e83b1754d5ed4d upstream.
    
    The code in decode_config4() of arch/mips/kernel/cpu-probe.c
    
            asid_mask = MIPS_ENTRYHI_ASID;
            if (config4 & MIPS_CONF4_AE)

            set_cpu_asid_mask(c, asid_mask);
    
    set asid_mask to cpuinfo->asid_mask.
    
    So in order to support variable ASID_MASK, KVM_ENTRYHI_ASID should also
    be changed to cpu_asid_mask(&boot_cpu_data).

    KVM: nVMX: Consult only the "basic" exit reason when routing nested exit
    
    commit 2ebac8bb3c2d35f5135466490fc8eeaf3f3e2d37 upstream.
    
    Consult only the basic exit reason, i.e. bits 15:0 of vmcs.EXIT_REASON,
    when determining whether a nested VM-Exit should be reflected into L1 or
    handled by KVM in L0.
    
    For better or worse, the switch statement in nested_vmx_exit_reflected()
    currently defaults to "true", i.e. reflects any nested VM-Exit without
    dedicated logic.  Because the case statements only contain the basic
    exit reason, any VM-Exit with modifier bits set will be reflected to L1,
    even if KVM intended to handle it in L0.
    
    Practically speaking, this only affects EXIT_REASON_MCE_DURING_VMENTRY,
    i.e. a #MC that occurs on nested VM-Enter would be incorrectly routed to
    L1, as "failed VM-Entry" is the only modifier that KVM can currently
    encounter.  The SMM modifiers will never be generated as KVM doesn't
    support/employ a SMI Transfer Monitor.  Ditto for "exit from enclave",
    as KVM doesn't yet support virtualizing SGX, i.e. it's impossible to
    enter an enclave in a KVM guest (L1 or L2).

    Restoring the ASID from the hsave area on VMEXIT is wrong, because its

    commit 18722d48a6bb9c2e8d046214c0a5fd19d0a7c9f6 upstream.
    
    Some memory is vmalloc'ed in the 'w100fb_save_vidmem' function and freed in
    the 'w100fb_restore_vidmem' function. (these functions are called
    respectively from the 'suspend' and the 'resume' functions)
    
    However, it is also freed in the 'remove' function.
    
    In order to avoid a potential double free, set the corresponding pointer
    to NULL once freed in the 'w100fb_restore_vidmem' function.

    proc: Use new_inode not new_inode_pseudo
    
    commit ef1548adada51a2f32ed7faef50aa465e1b4c5da upstream.
    
    Recently syzbot reported that unmounting proc when there is an ongoing
    inotify watch on the root directory of proc could result in a use
    after free when the watch is removed after the unmount of proc
    when the watcher exits.
    
    Commit 69879c01a0c3 ("proc: Remove the now unnecessary internal mount
    of proc") made it easier to unmount proc and allowed syzbot to see the
    problem, but looking at the code it has been around for a long time.
    
    Looking at the code the fsnotify watch should have been removed by
    fsnotify_sb_delete in generic_shutdown_super.  Unfortunately the inode
    was allocated with new_inode_pseudo instead of new_inode so the inode
    was not on the sb->s_inodes list.  Which prevented
    fsnotify_unmount_inodes from finding the inode and removing the watch
    as well as made it so the "VFS: Busy inodes after unmount" warning
    could not find the inodes to warn about them.
    
    Make all of the inodes in proc visible to generic_shutdown_super,
    and fsnotify_sb_delete by using new_inode instead of new_inode_pseudo.
    The only functional difference is that new_inode places the inodes
    on the sb->s_inodes list.
    
    I wrote a small test program and I can verify that without changes it
    can trigger this issue, and by replacing new_inode_pseudo with
    new_inode the issues goes away.

    ovl: initialize error in ovl_copy_xattr
    
    commit 520da69d265a91c6536c63851cbb8a53946974f0 upstream.
    
    In ovl_copy_xattr, if all the xattrs to be copied are overlayfs private
    xattrs, the copy loop will terminate without assigning anything to the
    error variable, thus returning an uninitialized value.
    
    If ovl_copy_xattr is called from ovl_clear_empty, this uninitialized error
    value is put into a pointer by ERR_PTR(), causing potential invalid memory
    accesses down the line.
    
    This commit initialize error with 0. This is the correct value because when
    there's no xattr to copy, because all xattrs are private, ovl_copy_xattr
    should succeed.
    
    This bug is discovered with the help of INIT_STACK_ALL and clang.

    spi: bcm2835: Fix controller unregister order
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dd277ff92d06f6aa95b39936ad83981d781f49b ]
    
    The BCM2835 SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_controller() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    bcm2835_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  bcm2835_spi_remove() tears down the DMA
    channels and turns off the SPI controller, including its interrupts
    and clock.  The SPI controller is thus no longer usable.
    
    When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered, it unbinds all
    its slave devices.  If their drivers need to access the SPI bus,
    e.g. to quiesce their interrupts, unbinding will fail.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_controller() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed
    after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by using the non-devm variant spi_register_controller().  Note that
    the struct spi_controller as well as the driver-private data are not
    freed until after bcm2835_spi_remove() has finished, so accessing them
    is safe.

    spi: pxa2xx: Fix controller unregister order
    
    [ Upstream commit 32e5b57232c0411e7dea96625c415510430ac079 ]
    
    The PXA2xx SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_controller() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    pxa2xx_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  pxa2xx_spi_remove() disables the chip,
    rendering the SPI bus inaccessible even though the SPI controller is
    still registered.  When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered,
    it unbinds all its slave devices.  Because their drivers cannot access
    the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce interrupts, the slave devices may be left
    in an improper state.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_controller() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed after
    unregistering the controller and specifically after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by reverting to the non-devm variant of spi_register_controller().
    
    An alternative approach would be to use device-managed functions for all
    steps in pxa2xx_spi_remove(), e.g. by calling devm_add_action_or_reset()
    on probe.  However that approach would add more LoC to the driver and
    it wouldn't lend itself as well to backporting to stable.
    
    The improper use of devm_spi_register_controller() was introduced in 2013
    by commit a807fcd090d6 ("spi: pxa2xx: use devm_spi_register_master()"),
    but all earlier versions of the driver going back to 2006 were likewise
    broken because they invoked spi_unregister_master() at the end of
    pxa2xx_spi_remove(), rather than at the beginning.

    However since commit ffbbdd21329f ("spi: create a message queueing

    slaves.  It sets ctlr->running = false, thereby preventing SPI bus
    access and causing unbinding of slave devices to fail.

    x86/speculation: PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE enforcement for indirect branches.
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d8df8cbb9156b0a0ab3f802b80cb5db57acc0bf ]
    
    Currently, it is possible to enable indirect branch speculation even after
    it was force-disabled using the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE option. Moreover, the
    PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL command gives afterwards an incorrect result
    (force-disabled when it is in fact enabled). This also is inconsistent
    vs. STIBP and the documention which cleary states that
    PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE cannot be undone.
    
    Fix this by actually enforcing force-disabled indirect branch
    speculation. PR_SPEC_ENABLE called after PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE now fails
    with -EPERM as described in the documentation.

    x86/speculation: Avoid force-disabling IBPB based on STIBP and enhanced IBRS.
    
    [ Upstream commit 21998a351512eba4ed5969006f0c55882d995ada ]
    
    When STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available, Linux
    force-disables the IBPB mitigation of Spectre-BTB even when simultaneous
    multithreading is disabled. While attempts to enable IBPB using
    prctl(PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL, PR_SPEC_INDIRECT_BRANCH, ...) fail with
    EPERM, the seccomp syscall (or its prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, ...) equivalent)
    which are used e.g. by Chromium or OpenSSH succeed with no errors but the
    application remains silently vulnerable to cross-process Spectre v2 attacks
    (classical BTB poisoning). At the same time the SYSFS reporting
    (/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2) displays that IBPB is
    conditionally enabled when in fact it is unconditionally disabled.
    
    STIBP is useful only when SMT is enabled. When SMT is disabled and STIBP is
    unavailable, it makes no sense to force-disable also IBPB, because IBPB
    protects against cross-process Spectre-BTB attacks regardless of the SMT
    state. At the same time since missing STIBP was only observed on AMD CPUs,
    AMD does not recommend using STIBP, but recommends using IBPB, so disabling
    IBPB because of missing STIBP goes directly against AMD's advice:
    https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Architecture_Guidelines_Update_Indirect_Branch_Control.pdf
    
    Similarly, enhanced IBRS is designed to protect cross-core BTB poisoning
    and BTB-poisoning attacks from user space against kernel (and
    BTB-poisoning attacks from guest against hypervisor), it is not designed
    to prevent cross-process (or cross-VM) BTB poisoning between processes (or
    VMs) running on the same core. Therefore, even with enhanced IBRS it is
    necessary to flush the BTB during context-switches, so there is no reason
    to force disable IBPB when enhanced IBRS is available.
    
    Enable the prctl control of IBPB even when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced
    IBRS is available.

    x86/speculation: Add support for STIBP always-on preferred mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 20c3a2c33e9fdc82e9e8e8d2a6445b3256d20191 ]
    
    Different AMD processors may have different implementations of STIBP.
    When STIBP is conditionally enabled, some implementations would benefit
    from having STIBP always on instead of toggling the STIBP bit through MSR
    writes. This preference is advertised through a CPUID feature bit.
    
    When conditional STIBP support is requested at boot and the CPU advertises
    STIBP always-on mode as preferred, switch to STIBP "on" support. To show
    that this transition has occurred, create a new spectre_v2_user_mitigation
    value and a new spectre_v2_user_strings message. The new mitigation value
    is used in spectre_v2_user_select_mitigation() to print the new mitigation
    message as well as to return a new string from stibp_state().

    spi: bcm-qspi: when tx/rx buffer is NULL set to 0
    
    commit 4df3bea7f9d2ddd9ac2c29ba945c7c4db2def29c upstream.
    
    Currently we set the tx/rx buffer to 0xff when NULL. This causes
    problems with some spi slaves where 0xff is a valid command. Looking
    at other drivers, the tx/rx buffer is usually set to 0x00 when NULL.
    Following this convention solves the issue.

    spi: bcm2835aux: Fix controller unregister order
    
    commit b9dd3f6d417258ad0beeb292a1bc74200149f15d upstream.
    
    The BCM2835aux SPI driver uses devm_spi_register_master() on bind.
    As a consequence, on unbind, __device_release_driver() first invokes
    bcm2835aux_spi_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
    devres_release_all().
    
    This order is incorrect:  bcm2835aux_spi_remove() turns off the SPI
    controller, including its interrupts and clock.  The SPI controller
    is thus no longer usable.
    
    When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered, it unbinds all
    its slave devices.  If their drivers need to access the SPI bus,
    e.g. to quiesce their interrupts, unbinding will fail.
    
    As a rule, devm_spi_register_master() must not be used if the
    ->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed
    after unbinding of slaves.
    
    Fix by using the non-devm variant spi_register_master().  Note that the
    struct spi_master as well as the driver-private data are not freed until
    after bcm2835aux_spi_remove() has finished, so accessing them is safe.

    nilfs2: fix null pointer dereference at nilfs_segctor_do_construct()
    
    commit 8301c719a2bd131436438e49130ee381d30933f5 upstream.
    
    After commit c3aab9a0bd91 ("mm/filemap.c: don't initiate writeback if

    been reported on nilfs2:

    WB_WRITEBACK) where inode_to_wb(inode) is NULL if the inode of
    underlying block device does not have an associated wb.
    
    This fixes the issue by calling inode_attach_wb() in advance to ensure
    to associate the bdev inode with its wb.

    ACPI: PM: Avoid using power resources if there are none for D0
    
    commit 956ad9d98b73f59e442cc119c98ba1e04e94fe6d upstream.
    
    As recently reported, some platforms provide a list of power
    resources for device power state D3hot, through the _PR3 object,
    but they do not provide a list of power resources for device power
    state D0.
    
    Among other things, this causes acpi_device_get_power() to return
    D3hot as the current state of the device in question if all of the
    D3hot power resources are "on", because it sees the power_resources
    flag set and calls acpi_power_get_inferred_state() which finds that
    D3hot is the shallowest power state with all of the associated power
    resources turned "on", so that's what it returns.  Moreover, that
    value takes precedence over the acpi_dev_pm_explicit_get() return
    value, because it means a deeper power state.  The device may very
    well be in D0 physically at that point, however.
    
    Moreover, the presence of _PR3 without _PR0 for a given device
    means that only one D3-level power state can be supported by it.
    Namely, because there are no power resources to turn "off" when
    transitioning the device from D0 into D3cold (which should be
    supported since _PR3 is present), the evaluation of _PS3 should
    be sufficient to put it straight into D3cold, but this means that
    the effect of turning "on" the _PR3 power resources is unclear,
    so it is better to avoid doing that altogether.  Consequently,
    there is no practical way do distinguish D3cold from D3hot for
    the device in question and the power states of it can be labeled
    so that D3hot is the deepest supported one (and Linux assumes
    that putting a device into D3hot via ACPI may cause power to be
    removed from it anyway, for legacy reasons).
    
    To work around the problem described above modify the ACPI
    enumeration of devices so that power resources are only used
    for device power management if the list of D0 power resources
    is not empty and make it mart D3cold as supported only if that
    is the case and the D3hot list of power resources is not empty
    too.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix inconsistent card PM state after resume
    
    commit 862b2509d157c629dd26d7ac6c6cdbf043d332eb upstream.
    
    When a USB-audio interface gets runtime-suspended via auto-pm feature,
    the driver suspends all functionality and increment
    chip->num_suspended_intf.  Later on, when the system gets suspended to
    S3, the driver increments chip->num_suspended_intf again, skips the
    device changes, and sets the card power state to
    SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot.  In return, when the system gets resumed from
    S3, the resume callback decrements chip->num_suspended_intf.  Since
    this refcount is still not zero (it's been runtime-suspended), the
    whole resume is skipped.  But there is a small pitfall here.
    
    The problem is that the driver doesn't restore the card power state
    after this resume call, leaving it as SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot.  So,
    even after the system resume finishes, the card instance still appears
    as if it were system-suspended, and this confuses many ioctl accesses
    that are blocked unexpectedly.
    
    In details, we have two issues behind the scene: one is that the card
    power state is changed only when the refcount becomes zero, and
    another is that the prior auto-suspend check is kept in a boolean
    flag.  Although the latter problem is almost negligible since the
    auto-pm feature is imposed only on the primary interface, but this can
    be a potential problem on the devices with multiple interfaces.
    
    This patch addresses those issues by the following:
    
    - Replace chip->autosuspended boolean flag with chip->system_suspend
      counter
    
    - At the first system-suspend, chip->num_suspended_intf is recorded to
      chip->system_suspend
    
    - At system-resume, the card power state is restored when the
      chip->num_suspended_intf refcount reaches to chip->system_suspend,
      i.e. the state returns to the auto-suspended
    
    Also, the patch fixes yet another hidden problem by the code
    refactoring along with the fixes above: namely, when some resume
    procedure failed, the driver left chip->num_suspended_intf that was
    already decreased, and it might lead to the refcount unbalance.
    In the new code, the refcount decrement is done after the whole resume
    procedure, and the problem is avoided as well.

    x86/speculation: Prevent rogue cross-process SSBD shutdown
    
    commit dbbe2ad02e9df26e372f38cc3e70dab9222c832e upstream.
    
    On context switch the change of TIF_SSBD and TIF_SPEC_IB are evaluated
    to adjust the mitigations accordingly. This is optimized to avoid the
    expensive MSR write if not needed.
    
    This optimization is buggy and allows an attacker to shutdown the SSBD
    protection of a victim process.
    
    The update logic reads the cached base value for the speculation control
    MSR which has neither the SSBD nor the STIBP bit set. It then OR's the
    SSBD bit only when TIF_SSBD is different and requests the MSR update.
    
    That means if TIF_SSBD of the previous and next task are the same, then
    the base value is not updated, even if TIF_SSBD is set. The MSR write is
    not requested.
    
    Subsequently if the TIF_STIBP bit differs then the STIBP bit is updated
    in the base value and the MSR is written with a wrong SSBD value.
    
    This was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB
    switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching.
    
    It is exploitable if the attacker creates a process which enforces SSBD
    and has the contrary value of STIBP than the victim process (i.e. if the
    victim process enforces STIBP, the attacker process must not enforce it;
    if the victim process does not enforce STIBP, the attacker process must
    enforce it) and schedule it on the same core as the victim process. If
    the victim runs after the attacker the victim becomes vulnerable to
    Spectre V4.
    
    To fix this, update the MSR value independent of the TIF_SSBD difference
    and dependent on the SSBD mitigation method available. This ensures that
    a subsequent STIPB initiated MSR write has the correct state of SSBD.

    x86_64: Fix jiffies ODR violation
    
    commit d8ad6d39c35d2b44b3d48b787df7f3359381dcbf upstream.
    
    'jiffies' and 'jiffies_64' are meant to alias (two different symbols that
    share the same address).  Most architectures make the symbols alias to the
    same address via a linker script assignment in their
    arch/<arch>/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S:
    
    jiffies = jiffies_64;
    
    which is effectively a definition of jiffies.
    
    jiffies and jiffies_64 are both forward declared for all architectures in
    include/linux/jiffies.h. jiffies_64 is defined in kernel/time/timer.c.
    
    x86_64 was peculiar in that it wasn't doing the above linker script
    assignment, but rather was:
    1. defining jiffies in arch/x86/kernel/time.c instead via the linker script.
    2. overriding the symbol jiffies_64 from kernel/time/timer.c in
    arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.s via 'jiffies_64 = jiffies;'.
    
    As Fangrui notes:
    
      In LLD, symbol assignments in linker scripts override definitions in
      object files. GNU ld appears to have the same behavior. It would
      probably make sense for LLD to error "duplicate symbol" but GNU ld
      is unlikely to adopt for compatibility reasons.
    
    This results in an ODR violation (UB), which seems to have survived
    thus far. Where it becomes harmful is when;
    
    1. -fno-semantic-interposition is used:
    
    As Fangrui notes:
    
      Clang after LLVM commit 5b22bcc2b70d
      ("[X86][ELF] Prefer to lower MC_GlobalAddress operands to .Lfoo$local")
      defaults to -fno-semantic-interposition similar semantics which help
      -fpic/-fPIC code avoid GOT/PLT when the referenced symbol is defined
      within the same translation unit. Unlike GCC
      -fno-semantic-interposition, Clang emits such relocations referencing
      local symbols for non-pic code as well.
    
    This causes references to jiffies to refer to '.Ljiffies$local' when
    jiffies is defined in the same translation unit. Likewise, references to
    jiffies_64 become references to '.Ljiffies_64$local' in translation units
    that define jiffies_64.  Because these differ from the names used in the
    linker script, they will not be rewritten to alias one another.
    
    2. Full LTO
    
    Full LTO effectively treats all source files as one translation
    unit, causing these local references to be produced everywhere.  When
    the linker processes the linker script, there are no longer any
    references to jiffies_64' anywhere to replace with 'jiffies'.  And
    thus '.Ljiffies$local' and '.Ljiffies_64$local' no longer alias
    at all.
    
    In the process of porting patches enabling Full LTO from arm64 to x86_64,
    spooky bugs have been observed where the kernel appeared to boot, but init
    doesn't get scheduled.
    
    Avoid the ODR violation by matching other architectures and define jiffies
    only by linker script.  For -fno-semantic-interposition + Full LTO, there
    is no longer a global definition of jiffies for the compiler to produce a
    local symbol which the linker script won't ensure aliases to jiffies_64.

    ath9k_htc: Silence undersized packet warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit 450edd2805982d14ed79733a82927d2857b27cac ]
    
    Some devices like TP-Link TL-WN722N produces this kind of messages
    frequently.

    This warning is useful for developers to recognize that the device
    (Wi-Fi dongle or USB hub etc) is noisy but not for general users. So
    this patch make this warning to debug message.

    sched/fair: Don't NUMA balance for kthreads
    
    [ Upstream commit 18f855e574d9799a0e7489f8ae6fd8447d0dd74a ]
    
    Stefano reported a crash with using SQPOLL with io_uring:
    
      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000003b0
      CPU: 2 PID: 1307 Comm: io_uring-sq Not tainted 5.7.0-rc7 #11

    which is task_numa_work() oopsing on current->mm being NULL.
    
    The task work is queued by task_tick_numa(), which checks if current->mm is
    NULL at the time of the call. But this state isn't necessarily persistent,
    if the kthread is using use_mm() to temporarily adopt the mm of a task.
    
    Change the task_tick_numa() check to exclude kernel threads in general,
    as it doesn't make sense to attempt ot balance for kthreads anyway.

    ARM: 8977/1: ptrace: Fix mask for thumb breakpoint hook
    
    [ Upstream commit 3866f217aaa81bf7165c7f27362eee5d7919c496 ]
    
    call_undef_hook() in traps.c applies the same instr_mask for both 16-bit
    and 32-bit thumb instructions. If instr_mask then is only 16 bits wide
    (0xffff as opposed to 0xffffffff), the first half-word of 32-bit thumb
    instructions will be masked out. This makes the function match 32-bit
    thumb instructions where the second half-word is equal to instr_val,
    regardless of the first half-word.
    
    The result in this case is that all undefined 32-bit thumb instructions
    with the second half-word equal to 0xde01 (udf #1) work as breakpoints
    and will raise a SIGTRAP instead of a SIGILL, instead of just the one
    intended 16-bit instruction. An example of such an instruction is
    0xeaa0de01, which is unallocated according to Arm ARM and should raise a
    SIGILL, but instead raises a SIGTRAP.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by setting all the bits in instr_mask, which
    will still match the intended 16-bit thumb instruction (where the
    upper half is always 0), but not any 32-bit thumb instructions.

    vxlan: Avoid infinite loop when suppressing NS messages with invalid options
    
    [ Upstream commit 8066e6b449e050675df48e7c4b16c29f00507ff0 ]
    
    When proxy mode is enabled the vxlan device might reply to Neighbor
    Solicitation (NS) messages on behalf of remote hosts.
    
    In case the NS message includes the "Source link-layer address" option
    [1], the vxlan device will use the specified address as the link-layer
    destination address in its reply.
    
    To avoid an infinite loop, break out of the options parsing loop when
    encountering an option with length zero and disregard the NS message.
    
    This is consistent with the IPv6 ndisc code and RFC 4886 which states
    that "Nodes MUST silently discard an ND packet that contains an option
    with length zero" [2].

    ipv6: fix IPV6_ADDRFORM operation logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 79a1f0ccdbb4ad700590f61b00525b390cb53905 ]
    
    Socket option IPV6_ADDRFORM supports UDP/UDPLITE and TCP at present.
    Previously the checking logic looks like:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol != IPPROTO_TCP)
            break;
    
    After commit b6f6118901d1 ("ipv6: restrict IPV6_ADDRFORM operation"), TCP
    was blocked as the logic changed to:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
            break;
    else
            break;
    
    Then after commit 82c9ae440857 ("ipv6: fix restrict IPV6_ADDRFORM operation")
    UDP/UDPLITE were blocked as the logic changed to:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
    
    if (sk->sk_protocol != IPPROTO_TCP)
            break;
    
    Fix it by using Eric's code and simply remove the break in TCP check, which
    looks like:
    if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDP || sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_UDPLITE)
            do_some_check;
    else if (sk->sk_protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
            do_some_check;
    else
            break;
