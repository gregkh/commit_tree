    xfs: only return -errno or success from attr ->put_listent
    
    commit 2a6fba6d2311151598abaa1e7c9abd5f8d024a43 upstream.
    
    Today, the put_listent formatters return either 1 or 0; if
    they return 1, some callers treat this as an error and return
    it up the stack, despite "1" not being a valid (negative)
    error code.
    
    The intent seems to be that if the input buffer is full,
    we set seen_enough or set count = -1, and return 1;
    but some callers check the return before checking the
    seen_enough or count fields of the context.
    
    Fix this by only returning non-zero for actual errors
    encountered, and rely on the caller to first check the
    return value, then check the values in the context to
    decide what to do.

    xfs: bad assertion for delalloc an extent that start at i_size
    
    commit 892d2a5f705723b2cb488bfb38bcbdcf83273184 upstream.
    
    By run fsstress long enough time enough in RHEL-7, I find an
    assertion failure (harder to reproduce on linux-4.11, but problem
    is still there):
    
      XFS: Assertion failed: (iflags & BMV_IF_DELALLOC) != 0, file: fs/xfs/xfs_bmap_util.c
    
    The assertion is in xfs_getbmap() funciton:
    
      if (map[i].br_startblock == DELAYSTARTBLOCK &&
    -->   map[i].br_startoff <= XFS_B_TO_FSB(mp, XFS_ISIZE(ip)))
              ASSERT((iflags & BMV_IF_DELALLOC) != 0);
    
    When map[i].br_startoff == XFS_B_TO_FSB(mp, XFS_ISIZE(ip)), the
    startoff is just at EOF. But we only need to make sure delalloc
    extents that are within EOF, not include EOF.

    xfs: fix indlen accounting error on partial delalloc conversion
    
    commit 0daaecacb83bc6b656a56393ab77a31c28139bc7 upstream.
    
    The delalloc -> real block conversion path uses an incorrect
    calculation in the case where the middle part of a delalloc extent
    is being converted. This is documented as a rare situation because
    XFS generally attempts to maximize contiguity by converting as much
    of a delalloc extent as possible.
    
    If this situation does occur, the indlen reservation for the two new
    delalloc extents left behind by the conversion of the middle range
    is calculated and compared with the original reservation. If more
    blocks are required, the delta is allocated from the global block
    pool. This delta value can be characterized as the difference
    between the new total requirement (temp + temp2) and the currently
    available reservation minus those blocks that have already been
    allocated (startblockval(PREV.br_startblock) - allocated).
    
    The problem is that the current code does not account for previously
    allocated blocks correctly. It subtracts the current allocation
    count from the (new - old) delta rather than the old indlen
    reservation. This means that more indlen blocks than have been
    allocated end up stashed in the remaining extents and free space
    accounting is broken as a result.
    
    Fix up the calculation to subtract the allocated block count from
    the original extent indlen and thus correctly allocate the
    reservation delta based on the difference between the new total
    requirement and the unused blocks from the original reservation.
    Also remove a bogus assert that contradicts the fact that the new
    indlen reservation can be larger than the original indlen
    reservation.

    xfs: wait on new inodes during quotaoff dquot release
    
    commit e20c8a517f259cb4d258e10b0cd5d4b30d4167a0 upstream.
    
    The quotaoff operation has a race with inode allocation that results
    in a livelock. An inode allocation that occurs before the quota
    status flags are updated acquires the appropriate dquots for the
    inode via xfs_qm_vop_dqalloc(). It then inserts the XFS_INEW inode
    into the perag radix tree, sometime later attaches the dquots to the
    inode and finally clears the XFS_INEW flag. Quotaoff expects to
    release the dquots from all inodes in the filesystem via
    xfs_qm_dqrele_all_inodes(). This invokes the AG inode iterator,
    which skips inodes in the XFS_INEW state because they are not fully
    constructed. If the scan occurs after dquots have been attached to
    an inode, but before XFS_INEW is cleared, the newly allocated inode
    will continue to hold a reference to the applicable dquots. When
    quotaoff invokes xfs_qm_dqpurge_all(), the reference count of those
    dquot(s) remain elevated and the dqpurge scan spins indefinitely.
    
    To address this problem, update the xfs_qm_dqrele_all_inodes() scan
    to wait on inodes marked on the XFS_INEW state. We wait on the
    inodes explicitly rather than skip and retry to avoid continuous
    retry loops due to a parallel inode allocation workload. Since
    quotaoff updates the quota state flags and uses a synchronous
    transaction before the dqrele scan, and dquots are attached to
    inodes after radix tree insertion iff quota is enabled, one INEW
    waiting pass through the AG guarantees that the scan has processed
    all inodes that could possibly hold dquot references.

    xfs: update ag iterator to support wait on new inodes
    
    commit ae2c4ac2dd39b23a87ddb14ceddc3f2872c6aef5 upstream.
    
    The AG inode iterator currently skips new inodes as such inodes are
    inserted into the inode radix tree before they are fully
    constructed. Certain contexts require the ability to wait on the
    construction of new inodes, however. The fs-wide dquot release from
    the quotaoff sequence is an example of this.
    
    Update the AG inode iterator to support the ability to wait on
    inodes flagged with XFS_INEW upon request. Create a new
    xfs_inode_ag_iterator_flags() interface and support a set of
    iteration flags to modify the iteration behavior. When the
    XFS_AGITER_INEW_WAIT flag is set, include XFS_INEW flags in the
    radix tree inode lookup and wait on them before the callback is
    executed.

    xfs: support ability to wait on new inodes
    
    commit 756baca27fff3ecaeab9dbc7a5ee35a1d7bc0c7f upstream.
    
    Inodes that are inserted into the perag tree but still under
    construction are flagged with the XFS_INEW bit. Most contexts either
    skip such inodes when they are encountered or have the ability to
    handle them.
    
    The runtime quotaoff sequence introduces a context that must wait
    for construction of such inodes to correctly ensure that all dquots
    in the fs are released. In anticipation of this, support the ability
    to wait on new inodes. Wake the appropriate bit when XFS_INEW is

    The quotacheck error handling of the delwri buffer list assumes the

    delwri queue. Update the helper to clear the delwri queue flag and
    call it from quotacheck.

    xfs: prevent multi-fsb dir readahead from reading random blocks
    
    commit cb52ee334a45ae6c78a3999e4b473c43ddc528f4 upstream.
    
    Directory block readahead uses a complex iteration mechanism to map
    between high-level directory blocks and underlying physical extents.
    This mechanism attempts to traverse the higher-level dir blocks in a
    manner that handles multi-fsb directory blocks and simultaneously
    maintains a reference to the corresponding physical blocks.
    
    This logic doesn't handle certain (discontiguous) physical extent
    layouts correctly with multi-fsb directory blocks. For example,
    consider the case of a 4k FSB filesystem with a 2 FSB (8k) directory
    block size and a directory with the following extent layout:
    
     EXT: FILE-OFFSET      BLOCK-RANGE      AG AG-OFFSET        TOTAL
       0: [0..7]:          88..95            0 (88..95)             8
       1: [8..15]:         80..87            0 (80..87)             8
       2: [16..39]:        168..191          0 (168..191)          24
       3: [40..63]:        5242952..5242975  1 (72..95)            24
    
    Directory block 0 spans physical extents 0 and 1, dirblk 1 lies
    entirely within extent 2 and dirblk 2 spans extents 2 and 3. Because
    extent 2 is larger than the directory block size, the readahead code
    erroneously assumes the block is contiguous and issues a readahead
    based on the physical mapping of the first fsb of the dirblk. This
    results in read verifier failure and a spurious corruption or crc
    failure, depending on the filesystem format.
    
    Further, the subsequent readahead code responsible for walking
    through the physical table doesn't correctly advance the physical
    block reference for dirblk 2. Instead of advancing two physical
    filesystem blocks, the first iteration of the loop advances 1 block
    (correctly), but the subsequent iteration advances 2 more physical
    blocks because the next physical extent (extent 3, above) happens to
    cover more than dirblk 2. At this point, the higher-level directory
    block walking is completely off the rails of the actual physical
    layout of the directory for the respective mapping table.
    
    Update the contiguous dirblock logic to consider the current offset
    in the physical extent to avoid issuing directory readahead to
    unrelated blocks. Also, update the mapping table advancing code to
    consider the current offset within the current dirblock to avoid
    advancing the mapping reference too far beyond the dirblock.

    xfs: handle array index overrun in xfs_dir2_leaf_readbuf()
    
    commit 023cc840b40fad95c6fe26fff1d380a8c9d45939 upstream.
    
    Carlos had a case where "find" seemed to start spinning
    forever and never return.
    
    This was on a filesystem with non-default multi-fsb (8k)
    directory blocks, and a fragmented directory with extents
    like this:
    
    0:[0,133646,2,0]
    1:[2,195888,1,0]
    2:[3,195890,1,0]
    3:[4,195892,1,0]
    4:[5,195894,1,0]
    5:[6,195896,1,0]
    6:[7,195898,1,0]
    7:[8,195900,1,0]
    8:[9,195902,1,0]
    9:[10,195908,1,0]
    10:[11,195910,1,0]
    11:[12,195912,1,0]
    12:[13,195914,1,0]
    ...
    
    i.e. the first extent is a contiguous 2-fsb dir block, but
    after that it is fragmented into 1 block extents.
    
    At the top of the readdir path, we allocate a mapping array
    which (for this filesystem geometry) can hold 10 extents; see
    the assignment to map_info->map_size.  During readdir, we are
    therefore able to map extents 0 through 9 above into the array
    for readahead purposes.  If we count by 2, we see that the last
    mapped index (9) is the first block of a 2-fsb directory block.
    
    At the end of xfs_dir2_leaf_readbuf() we have 2 loops to fill
    more readahead; the outer loop assumes one full dir block is
    processed each loop iteration, and an inner loop that ensures
    that this is so by advancing to the next extent until a full
    directory block is mapped.
    
    The problem is that this inner loop may step past the last
    extent in the mapping array as it tries to reach the end of
    the directory block.  This will read garbage for the extent
    length, and as a result the loop control variable 'j' may
    become corrupted and never fail the loop conditional.
    
    The number of valid mappings we have in our array is stored
    in map->map_valid, so stop this inner loop based on that limit.
    
    There is an ASSERT at the top of the outer loop for this
    same condition, but we never made it out of the inner loop,
    so the ASSERT never fired.
    
    Huge appreciation for Carlos for debugging and isolating
    the problem.

    xfs: fix off-by-one on max nr_pages in xfs_find_get_desired_pgoff()
    
    commit 8affebe16d79ebefb1d9d6d56a46dc89716f9453 upstream.
    
    xfs_find_get_desired_pgoff() is used to search for offset of hole or
    data in page range [index, end] (both inclusive), and the max number
    of pages to search should be at least one, if end == index.
    Otherwise the only page is missed and no hole or data is found,
    which is not correct.
    
    When block size is smaller than page size, this can be demonstrated
    by preallocating a file with size smaller than page size and writing
    data to the last block. E.g. run this xfs_io command on a 1k block
    size XFS on x86_64 host.
    
      # xfs_io -fc "falloc 0 3k" -c "pwrite 2k 1k" \
                -c "seek -d 0" /mnt/xfs/testfile
      wrote 1024/1024 bytes at offset 2048
      1 KiB, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (33.675 MiB/sec and 34482.7586 ops/sec)
      Whence  Result
      DATA    EOF
    
    Data at offset 2k was missed, and lseek(2) returned ENXIO.
    
    This is uncovered by generic/285 subtest 07 and 08 on ppc64 host,
    where pagesize is 64k. Because a recent change to generic/285
    reduced the preallocated file size to smaller than 64k.

    xfs_io -c "falloc 0 256k" -c "pwrite 0 56k" -c "pwrite 128k 8k"
           -c "seek -h 0" file
    wrote 57344/57344 bytes at offset 0
    56 KiB, 14 ops; 0.0000 sec (49.312 MiB/sec and 12623.9856 ops/sec)
    wrote 8192/8192 bytes at offset 131072
    8 KiB, 2 ops; 0.0000 sec (70.383 MiB/sec and 18018.0180 ops/sec)
    Whence  Result
    HOLE    139264
    
    Where we can see that hole at offset 56k was just ignored by SEEK_HOLE
    implementation. The bug is in xfs_find_get_desired_pgoff() which does
    not properly detect the case when pages are not contiguous.
    
    Fix the problem by properly detecting when found page has larger offset
    than expected.

    mlock: fix mlock count can not decrease in race condition
    
    commit 70feee0e1ef331b22cc51f383d532a0d043fbdcc upstream.
    
    Kefeng reported that when running the follow test, the mlock count in
    meminfo will increase permanently:
    
     [1] testcase
     linux:~ # cat test_mlockal
     grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo
      for j in `seq 0 10`
      do
            for i in `seq 4 15`
            do
                    ./p_mlockall >> log &
            done
            sleep 0.2
     done
     # wait some time to let mlock counter decrease and 5s may not enough
     sleep 5
     grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo
    
     linux:~ # cat p_mlockall.c
     #include <sys/mman.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
    
     #define SPACE_LEN      4096
    
     int main(int argc, char ** argv)
     {
                    int ret;
                    void *adr = malloc(SPACE_LEN);
                    if (!adr)
                            return -1;
    
                    ret = mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE);
                    printf("mlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);
    
                    ret = munlockall();
                    printf("munlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);
    
                    free(adr);
                    return 0;
             }
    
    In __munlock_pagevec() we should decrement NR_MLOCK for each page where
    we clear the PageMlocked flag.  Commit 1ebb7cc6a583 ("mm: munlock: batch
    NR_MLOCK zone state updates") has introduced a bug where we don't
    decrement NR_MLOCK for pages where we clear the flag, but fail to
    isolate them from the lru list (e.g.  when the pages are on some other
    cpu's percpu pagevec).  Since PageMlocked stays cleared, the NR_MLOCK
    accounting gets permanently disrupted by this.
    
    Fix it by counting the number of page whose PageMlock flag is cleared.

    mm/migrate: fix refcount handling when !hugepage_migration_supported()
    
    commit 30809f559a0d348c2dfd7ab05e9a451e2384962e upstream.
    
    On failing to migrate a page, soft_offline_huge_page() performs the
    necessary update to the hugepage ref-count.
    
    But when !hugepage_migration_supported() , unmap_and_move_hugepage()
    also decrements the page ref-count for the hugepage.  The combined
    behaviour leaves the ref-count in an inconsistent state.
    
    This leads to soft lockups when running the overcommitted hugepage test
    from mce-tests suite.

    This only triggers on systems that enable memory failure handling
    (ARCH_SUPPORTS_MEMORY_FAILURE) but not hugepage migration
    (!ARCH_ENABLE_HUGEPAGE_MIGRATION).
    
    I imagine this wasn't triggered as there aren't many systems running
    this configuration.

    drm/gma500/psb: Actually use VBT mode when it is found
    
    commit 82bc9a42cf854fdf63155759c0aa790bd1f361b0 upstream.
    
    With LVDS we were incorrectly picking the pre-programmed mode instead of
    the prefered mode provided by VBT. Make sure we pick the VBT mode if
    one is provided. It is likely that the mode read-out code is still wrong
    but this patch fixes the immediate problem on most machines.

    slub/memcg: cure the brainless abuse of sysfs attributes
    
    commit 478fe3037b2278d276d4cd9cd0ab06c4cb2e9b32 upstream.
    
    memcg_propagate_slab_attrs() abuses the sysfs attribute file functions
    to propagate settings from the root kmem_cache to a newly created
    kmem_cache.  It does that with:
    
         attr->show(root, buf);
         attr->store(new, buf, strlen(bug);
    
    Aside of being a lazy and absurd hackery this is broken because it does
    not check the return value of the show() function.
    
    Some of the show() functions return 0 w/o touching the buffer.  That
    means in such a case the store function is called with the stale content
    of the previous show().  That causes nonsense like invoking
    kmem_cache_shrink() on a newly created kmem_cache.  In the worst case it
    would cause handing in an uninitialized buffer.
    
    This should be rewritten proper by adding a propagate() callback to
    those slub_attributes which must be propagated and avoid that insane
    conversion to and from ASCII, but that's too large for a hot fix.
    
    Check at least the return value of the show() function, so calling
    store() with stale content is prevented.
    
    Steven said:
     "It can cause a deadlock with get_online_cpus() that has been uncovered
      by recent cpu hotplug and lockdep changes that Thomas and Peter have
      been doing.
    
         Possible unsafe locking scenario:
    
               CPU0                    CPU1

    drm/radeon: Unbreak HPD handling for r600+
    
    commit 3d18e33735a02b1a90aecf14410bf3edbfd4d3dc upstream.
    
    We end up reading the interrupt register for HPD5, and then writing it
    to HPD6 which on systems without anything using HPD5 results in
    permanently disabling hotplug on one of the display outputs after the
    first time we acknowledge a hotplug interrupt from the GPU.
    
    This code is really bad. But for now, let's just fix this. I will
    hopefully have a large patch series to refactor all of this soon.

    scsi: mpt3sas: Force request partial completion alignment
    
    commit f2e767bb5d6ee0d988cb7d4e54b0b21175802b6b upstream.
    
    The firmware or device, possibly under a heavy I/O load, can return on a
    partial unaligned boundary. Scsi-ml expects these requests to be
    completed on an alignment boundary. Scsi-ml blindly requeues the I/O
    without checking the alignment boundary of the I/O request for the
    remaining bytes. This leads to errors, since devices cannot perform
    non-aligned read/write operations.
    
    This patch fixes the issue in the driver. It aligns unaligned
    completions of FS requests, by truncating them to the nearest alignment
    boundary.

    HID: wacom: Have wacom_tpc_irq guard against possible NULL dereference
    
    commit 2ac97f0f6654da14312d125005c77a6010e0ea38 upstream.
    
    The following Smatch complaint was generated in response to commit
    2a6cdbd ("HID: wacom: Introduce new 'touch_input' device"):
    
        drivers/hid/wacom_wac.c:1586 wacom_tpc_irq()
                 error: we previously assumed 'wacom->touch_input' could be null (see line 1577)
    
    The 'touch_input' and 'pen_input' variables point to the 'struct input_dev'
    used for relaying touch and pen events to userspace, respectively. If a
    device does not have a touch interface or pen interface, the associated
    input variable is NULL. The 'wacom_tpc_irq()' function is responsible for
    forwarding input reports to a more-specific IRQ handler function. An
    unknown report could theoretically be mistaken as e.g. a touch report
    on a device which does not have a touch interface. This can be prevented
    by only calling the pen/touch functions are called when the pen/touch
    pointers are valid.

    commit f5f968f2371ccdebb8a365487649673c9af68d09 upstream.
    
    The stingray SDHCI hardware supports ACMD12 and automatically
    issues after multi block transfer completed.
    
    If ACMD12 in SDHCI is disabled, spurious tx done interrupts are seen
    on multi block read command with below error message:
    
    Got data interrupt 0x00000002 even though no data
    operation was in progress.
    
    This patch uses SDHCI_QUIRK_MULTIBLOCK_READ_ACMD12 to enable

    i2c: i2c-tiny-usb: fix buffer not being DMA capable
    
    commit 5165da5923d6c7df6f2927b0113b2e4d9288661e upstream.
    
    Since v4.9 i2c-tiny-usb generates the below call trace
    and longer works, since it can't communicate with the
    USB device. The reason is, that since v4.9 the USB
    stack checks, that the buffer it should transfer is DMA
    capable. This was a requirement since v2.2 days, but it
    usually worked nevertheless.

    vlan: Fix tcp checksum offloads in Q-in-Q vlans
    
    commit 35d2f80b07bbe03fb358afb0bdeff7437a7d67ff upstream.
    
    It appears that TCP checksum offloading has been broken for
    Q-in-Q vlans.  The behavior was execerbated by the
    series
        commit afb0bc972b52 ("Merge branch 'stacked_vlan_tso'")
    that that enabled accleleration features on stacked vlans.
    
    However, event without that series, it is possible to trigger
    this issue.  It just requires a lot more specialized configuration.
    
    The root cause is the interaction between how
    netdev_intersect_features() works, the features actually set on
    the vlan devices and HW having the ability to run checksum with
    longer headers.
    
    The issue starts when netdev_interesect_features() replaces
    NETIF_F_HW_CSUM with a combination of NETIF_F_IP_CSUM | NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM,
    if the HW advertises IP|IPV6 specific checksums.  This happens
    for tagged and multi-tagged packets.   However, HW that enables
    IP|IPV6 checksum offloading doesn't gurantee that packets with
    arbitrarily long headers can be checksummed.
    
    This patch disables IP|IPV6 checksums on the packet for multi-tagged
    packets.

    netem: fix skb_orphan_partial()
    
    commit f6ba8d33cfbb46df569972e64dbb5bb7e929bfd9 upstream.
    
    I should have known that lowering skb->truesize was dangerous :/
    
    In case packets are not leaving the host via a standard Ethernet device,
    but looped back to local sockets, bad things can happen, as reported
    by Michael Madsen ( https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195713 )
    
    So instead of tweaking skb->truesize, lets change skb->destructor
    and keep a reference on the owner socket via its sk_refcnt.

    ipv4: add reference counting to metrics
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3fb07daff8e99243366a081e5129560734de4ada ]
    
    Andrey Konovalov reported crashes in ipv4_mtu()
    
    I could reproduce the issue with KASAN kernels, between
    10.246.7.151 and 10.246.7.152 :
    
    1) 20 concurrent netperf -t TCP_RR -H 10.246.7.152 -l 1000 &
    
    2) At the same time run following loop :
    while :
    do
     ip ro add 10.246.7.152 dev eth0 src 10.246.7.151 mtu 1500
     ip ro del 10.246.7.152 dev eth0 src 10.246.7.151 mtu 1500
    done
    
    Cong Wang attempted to add back rt->fi in commit
    82486aa6f1b9 ("ipv4: restore rt->fi for reference counting")
    but this proved to add some issues that were complex to solve.
    
    Instead, I suggested to add a refcount to the metrics themselves,
    being a standalone object (in particular, no reference to other objects)
    
    I tried to make this patch as small as possible to ease its backport,
    instead of being super clean. Note that we believe that only ipv4 dst
    need to take care of the metric refcount. But if this is wrong,
    this patch adds the basic infrastructure to extend this to other
    families.
    
    Many thanks to Julian Anastasov for reviewing this patch, and Cong Wang
    for his efforts on this problem.

    sctp: fix ICMP processing if skb is non-linear
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 804ec7ebe8ea003999ca8d1bfc499edc6a9e07df ]
    
    sometimes ICMP replies to INIT chunks are ignored by the client, even if
    the encapsulated SCTP headers match an open socket. This happens when the
    ICMP packet is carried by a paged skb: use skb_header_pointer() to read
    packet contents beyond the SCTP header, so that chunk header and initiate
    tag are validated correctly.
    
    v2:
    - don't use skb_header_pointer() to read the transport header, since
      icmp_socket_deliver() already puts these 8 bytes in the linear area.
    - change commit message to make specific reference to INIT chunks.

    tcp: avoid fastopen API to be used on AF_UNSPEC
    
    
    [ Upstream commit ba615f675281d76fd19aa03558777f81fb6b6084 ]
    
    Fastopen API should be used to perform fastopen operations on the TCP
    socket. It does not make sense to use fastopen API to perform disconnect
    by calling it with AF_UNSPEC. The fastopen data path is also prone to
    race conditions and bugs when using with AF_UNSPEC.
    
    One issue reported and analyzed by Vegard Nossum is as follows:
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    Thread A:                            Thread B:

              |                           - tcp_sendmsg()

              |                                    - return 0; // no reconnect!
              |                           - sk_stream_wait_connect()
              |                                 - sock_error()
              |                                    - xchg(&sk->sk_err, 0)
              |                                    - return -ECONNRESET
            - ... // wake up, see sk->sk_err == 0
        - skb_entail() on TCP_CLOSE socket
    
    If the connection is reopened then we will send a brand new SYN packet
    after thread A has already queued a buffer. At this point I think the
    socket internal state (sequence numbers etc.) becomes messed up.
    
    When the new connection is closed, the FIN-ACK is rejected because the
    sequence number is outside the window. The other side tries to
    retransmit,
    but __tcp_retransmit_skb() calls tcp_trim_head() on an empty skb which
    corrupts the skb data length and hits a BUG() in copy_and_csum_bits().
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    
    Hence, this patch adds a check for AF_UNSPEC in the fastopen data path
    and return EOPNOTSUPP to user if such case happens.

    At least some of the be2net cards do not seem to be capabled
    of performing checksum offload computions on Q-in-Q packets.
    In these case, the recevied checksum on the remote is invalid

    This patch adds a call to check disbled acceleration features
    on Q-in-Q tagged traffic.

    Andrey Konovalov and idaifish@gmail.com reported crashes caused by
    one skb shared_info being overwritten from __ip6_append_data()
    
    Andrey program lead to following state :
    
    copy -4200 datalen 2000 fraglen 2040
    maxfraglen 2040 alloclen 2048 transhdrlen 0 offset 0 fraggap 6200
    
    The skb_copy_and_csum_bits(skb_prev, maxfraglen, data + transhdrlen,
    fraggap, 0); is overwriting skb->head and skb_shared_info
    
    Since we apparently detect this rare condition too late, move the
    code earlier to even avoid allocating skb and risking crashes.
    
    Once again, many thanks to Andrey and syzkaller team.

    bridge: start hello_timer when enabling KERNEL_STP in br_stp_start
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d18c732b95c0a9d35e9f978b4438bba15412284 ]
    
    Since commit 76b91c32dd86 ("bridge: stp: when using userspace stp stop
    kernel hello and hold timers"), bridge would not start hello_timer if
    stp_enabled is not KERNEL_STP when br_dev_open.
    
    The problem is even if users set stp_enabled with KERNEL_STP later,
    the timer will still not be started. It causes that KERNEL_STP can
    not really work. Users have to re-ifup the bridge to avoid this.
    
    This patch is to fix it by starting br->hello_timer when enabling
    KERNEL_STP in br_stp_start.
    
    As an improvement, it's also to start hello_timer again only when
    br->stp_enabled is KERNEL_STP in br_hello_timer_expired, there is
    no reason to start the timer again when it's NO_STP.

    Lenovo has decided to use a new USB device ID for the wwan modules in
    their 2017 laptops.  The actual hardware is still the Sierra Wireless
    EM7455 or EM7430, depending on region.

    bridge: netlink: check vlan_default_pvid range
    
    
    [ Upstream commit a285860211bf257b0e6d522dac6006794be348af ]
    
    Currently it is allowed to set the default pvid of a bridge to a value
    above VLAN_VID_MASK (0xfff). This patch adds a check to br_validate and
    returns -EINVAL in case the pvid is out of bounds.
    
    Reproduce by calling:
    
    [root@test ~]# ip l a type bridge
    [root@test ~]# ip l a type dummy
    [root@test ~]# ip l s bridge0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
    [root@test ~]# ip l s bridge0 type bridge vlan_default_pvid 9999
    [root@test ~]# ip l s dummy0 master bridge0
    [root@test ~]# bridge vlan
    port    vlan ids
    bridge0  9999 PVID Egress Untagged
    
    dummy0   9999 PVID Egress Untagged

    ipv6: Prevent overrun when parsing v6 header options
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2423496af35d94a87156b063ea5cedffc10a70a1 ]
    
    The KASAN warning repoted below was discovered with a syzkaller
    program.  The reproducer is basically:
      int s = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, NEXTHDR_HOP);
      send(s, &one_byte_of_data, 1, MSG_MORE);
      send(s, &more_than_mtu_bytes_data, 2000, 0);
    
    The socket() call sets the nexthdr field of the v6 header to
    NEXTHDR_HOP, the first send call primes the payload with a non zero
    byte of data, and the second send call triggers the fragmentation path.
    
    The fragmentation code tries to parse the header options in order
    to figure out where to insert the fragment option.  Since nexthdr points
    to an invalid option, the calculation of the size of the network header
    can made to be much larger than the linear section of the skb and data
    is read outside of it.
    
    This fix makes ip6_find_1stfrag return an error if it detects
    running out-of-bounds.

    net: Improve handling of failures on link and route dumps
    
    
    [ Upstream commit f6c5775ff0bfa62b072face6bf1d40f659f194b2 ]
    
    In general, rtnetlink dumps do not anticipate failure to dump a single
    object (e.g., link or route) on a single pass. As both route and link
    objects have grown via more attributes, that is no longer a given.
    
    netlink dumps can handle a failure if the dump function returns an
    error; specifically, netlink_dump adds the return code to the response
    if it is <= 0 so userspace is notified of the failure. The missing
    piece is the rtnetlink dump functions returning the error.
    
    Fix route and link dump functions to return the errors if no object is
    added to an skb (detected by skb->len != 0). IPv6 route dumps
    (rt6_dump_route) already return the error; this patch updates IPv4 and
    link dumps. Other dump functions may need to be ajusted as well.

    tcp: eliminate negative reordering in tcp_clean_rtx_queue
    
    
    [ Upstream commit bafbb9c73241760023d8981191ddd30bb1c6dbac ]
    
    tcp_ack() can call tcp_fragment() which may dededuct the
    value tp->fackets_out when MSS changes. When prior_fackets
    is larger than tp->fackets_out, tcp_clean_rtx_queue() can
    invoke tcp_update_reordering() with negative values. This
    results in absurd tp->reodering values higher than
    sysctl_tcp_max_reordering.
    
    Note that tcp_update_reordering indeeds sets tp->reordering
    to min(sysctl_tcp_max_reordering, metric), but because
    the comparison is signed, a negative metric always wins.

    sctp: fix src address selection if using secondary addresses for ipv6
    
    
    [ Upstream commit dbc2b5e9a09e9a6664679a667ff81cff6e5f2641 ]
    
    Commit 0ca50d12fe46 ("sctp: fix src address selection if using secondary
    addresses") has fixed a src address selection issue when using secondary
    addresses for ipv4.
    
    Now sctp ipv6 also has the similar issue. When using a secondary address,
    sctp_v6_get_dst tries to choose the saddr which has the most same bits
    with the daddr by sctp_v6_addr_match_len. It may make some cases not work
    as expected.
    
    hostA:
      [1] fd21:356b:459a:cf10::11 (eth1)
      [2] fd21:356b:459a:cf20::11 (eth2)
    
    hostB:
      [a] fd21:356b:459a:cf30::2  (eth1)
      [b] fd21:356b:459a:cf40::2  (eth2)
    
    route from hostA to hostB:
      fd21:356b:459a:cf30::/64 dev eth1  metric 1024  mtu 1500
    
    The expected path should be:
      fd21:356b:459a:cf10::11 <-> fd21:356b:459a:cf30::2
    But addr[2] matches addr[a] more bits than addr[1] does, according to
    sctp_v6_addr_match_len. It causes the path to be:
      fd21:356b:459a:cf20::11 <-> fd21:356b:459a:cf30::2
    
    This patch is to fix it with the same way as Marcelo's fix for sctp ipv4.
    As no ip_dev_find for ipv6, this patch is to use ipv6_chk_addr to check
    if the saddr is in a dev instead.
    
    Note that for backwards compatibility, it will still do the addr_match_len
    check here when no optimal is found.

    tcp: avoid fragmenting peculiar skbs in SACK
    
    
    [ Upstream commit b451e5d24ba6687c6f0e7319c727a709a1846c06 ]
    
    This patch fixes a bug in splitting an SKB during SACK
    processing. Specifically if an skb contains multiple
    packets and is only partially sacked in the higher sequences,
    tcp_match_sack_to_skb() splits the skb and marks the second fragment
    as SACKed.
    
    The current code further attempts rounding up the first fragment
    to MSS boundaries. But it misses a boundary condition when the
    rounded-up fragment size (pkt_len) is exactly skb size.  Spliting
    such an skb is pointless and causses a kernel warning and aborts
    the SACK processing. This patch universally checks such over-split
    before calling tcp_fragment to prevent these unnecessary warnings.

    s390/qeth: unbreak OSM and OSN support
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d2ebb3ed0c6acfb014f98e427298673a5d07b82 ]
    
    commit b4d72c08b358 ("qeth: bridgeport support - basic control")
    broke the support for OSM and OSN devices as follows:
    
    As OSM and OSN are L2 only, qeth_core_probe_device() does an early
    setup by loading the l2 discipline and calling qeth_l2_probe_device().
    In this context, adding the l2-specific bridgeport sysfs attributes
    via qeth_l2_create_device_attributes() hits a BUG_ON in fs/sysfs/group.c,
    since the basic sysfs infrastructure for the device hasn't been
    established yet.
    
    Note that OSN actually has its own unique sysfs attributes
    (qeth_osn_devtype), so the additional attributes shouldn't be created
    at all.
    For OSM, add a new qeth_l2_devtype that contains all the common
    and l2-specific sysfs attributes.
    When qeth_core_probe_device() does early setup for OSM or OSN, assign
    the corresponding devtype so that the ccwgroup probe code creates the
    full set of sysfs attributes.
    This allows us to skip qeth_l2_create_device_attributes() in case
    of an early setup.
    
    Any device that can't do early setup will initially have only the
    generic sysfs attributes, and when it's probed later
    qeth_l2_probe_device() adds the l2-specific attributes.
    
    If an early-setup device is removed (by calling ccwgroup_ungroup()),
    device_unregister() will - using the devtype - delete the
    l2-specific attributes before qeth_l2_remove_device() is called.
    So make sure to not remove them twice.
    
    What complicates the issue is that qeth_l2_probe_device() and
    qeth_l2_remove_device() is also called on a device when its
    layer2 attribute changes (ie. its layer mode is switched).
    For early-setup devices this wouldn't work properly - we wouldn't
    remove the l2-specific attributes when switching to L3.
    But switching the layer mode doesn't actually make any sense;
    we already decided that the device can only operate in L2!
    So just refuse to switch the layer mode on such devices. Note that
    OSN doesn't have a layer2 attribute, so we only need to special-case
    OSM.
    
    Based on an initial patch by Ursula Braun.

    When setting up the device from within the layer discipline's

    Report this error back to the caller, and handle it by
    releasing the layer discipline.

    sparc: Fix -Wstringop-overflow warning
    
    
    [ Upstream commit deba804c90642c8ed0f15ac1083663976d578f54 ]
    
    Greetings,
    
    GCC 7 introduced the -Wstringop-overflow flag to detect buffer overflows
    in calls to string handling functions [1][2]. Due to the way
    ``empty_zero_page'' is declared in arch/sparc/include/setup.h, this
    causes a warning to trigger at compile time in the function mem_init(),
    which is subsequently converted to an error. The ensuing patch fixes
    this issue and aligns the declaration of empty_zero_page to that of
    other architectures. Thank you.
    
    Cheers,
    Orlando.
