    arm64: dts: ls1046ardb: set RGMII interfaces to RGMII_ID mode
    
    commit d79e9d7c1e4ba5f95f2ff3541880c40ea9722212 upstream.
    
    The correct setting for the RGMII ports on LS1046ARDB is to
    enable delay on both Rx and Tx so the interface mode used must
    be PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.
    
    Since commit 1b3047b5208a80 ("net: phy: realtek: add support for
    configuring the RX delay on RTL8211F") the Realtek 8211F PHY driver
    has control over the RGMII RX delay and it is disabling it for
    RGMII_TXID. The LS1046ARDB uses two such PHYs in RGMII_ID mode but
    in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii".
    
    Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.

    arm64: dts: ls1043a-rdb: correct RGMII delay mode to rgmii-id
    
    commit 4022d808c45277693ea86478fab1f081ebf997e8 upstream.

    RGMII_TXID. The LS1043ARDB uses two such PHYs in RGMII_ID mode but
    in the device tree the mode was described as "rgmii_txid".
    This issue was not apparent at the time as the PHY driver took the
    same action for RGMII_TXID and RGMII_ID back then but it became
    visible (RX no longer working) after the above patch.
    
    Changing the phy-connection-type to "rgmii-id" to address the issue.

    perf map: Fix off by one in strncpy() size argument
    
    commit db2c549407d4a76563c579e4768f7d6d32afefba upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
    tools/perf/util/map.c. The issue is that in:
    
            strncmp(filename, "/system/lib/", 11)
    
    the passed string literal: "/system/lib/" has 12 bytes (without the NULL
    byte) and the passed size argument is 11. As a result, the logic won't
    match the ending "/" byte and will pass filepaths that are stored in
    other directories e.g. "/system/libmalicious/bin" or just
    "/system/libmalicious".
    
    This functionality seems to be present only on Android. I assume the
    /system/ directory is only writable by the root user, so I don't think
    this bug has much (or any) security impact.

    arm64: alternative: fix build with clang integrated assembler
    
    commit 6f5459da2b8736720afdbd67c4bd2d1edba7d0e3 upstream.
    
    Building an arm64 defconfig with clang's integrated assembler, this error
    occurs:
        <instantiation>:2:2: error: unrecognized instruction mnemonic

        ^
    
    While GNU as seems fine with case-sensitive macro instantiations, clang
    doesn't, so use the actual macro name (_asm_extable) as in the rest of
    the file.
    
    Also checked that the generated assembly matches the GCC output.

    net: ks8851-ml: Fix IO operations, again
    
    commit 8262e6f9b1034ede34548a04dec4c302d92c9497 upstream.
    
    This patch reverts 58292104832f ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit IO operation")
    and edacb098ea9c ("net: ks8851-ml: Fix 16-bit data access"), because it
    turns out these were only necessary due to buggy hardware. This patch adds
    a check for such a buggy hardware to prevent any such mistakes again.
    
    While working further on the KS8851 driver, it came to light that the
    KS8851-16MLL is capable of switching bus endianness by a hardware strap,
    EESK pin. If this strap is incorrect, the IO accesses require such endian
    swapping as is being reverted by this patch. Such swapping also impacts
    the performance significantly.
    
    Hence, in addition to removing it, detect that the hardware is broken,
    report to user, and fail to bind with such hardware.

    gpiolib: acpi: Add quirk to ignore EC wakeups on HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288 model
    
    commit 0c625ccfe6f754d0896b8881f5c85bcb81699f1f upstream.
    
    There are at least 3 models of the HP x2 10 models:
    
    Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
    
    Like on the other HP x2 10 models we need to ignore wakeup for ACPI GPIO
    events on the external embedded-controller pin to avoid spurious wakeups
    on the HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288 model too.
    
    This commit adds an extra DMI based quirk for the HP x2 10 CHT + AXP288
    model, ignoring wakeups for ACPI GPIO events on the EC interrupt pin
    on this model. This fixes spurious wakeups from suspend on this model.

    Trying to initialize a structure with "= {};" will not always clean out
    all padding locations in a structure. So be explicit and call memset to
    initialize everything for a number of bpf information structures that
    are then copied from userspace, sometimes from smaller memory locations
    than the size of the structure.

    bpf: Explicitly memset the bpf_attr structure
    
    commit 8096f229421f7b22433775e928d506f0342e5907 upstream.
    
    For the bpf syscall, we are relying on the compiler to properly zero out
    the bpf_attr union that we copy userspace data into. Unfortunately that
    doesn't always work properly, padding and other oddities might not be
    correctly zeroed, and in some tests odd things have been found when the
    stack is pre-initialized to other values.
    
    Fix this by explicitly memsetting the structure to 0 before using it.

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix use-after-free in vt_in_use()
    
    commit 7cf64b18b0b96e751178b8d0505d8466ff5a448f upstream.
    
    vt_in_use() dereferences console_driver->ttys[i] without proper locking.
    This is broken because the tty can be closed and freed concurrently.
    
    We could fix this by using 'READ_ONCE(console_driver->ttys[i]) != NULL'
    and skipping the check of tty_struct::count.  But, looking at
    console_driver->ttys[i] isn't really appropriate anyway because even if
    it is NULL the tty can still be in the process of being closed.
    
    Instead, fix it by making vt_in_use() require console_lock() and check
    whether the vt is allocated and has port refcount > 1.  This works since
    following the patch "vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use
    virtual console" the port refcount is incremented while the vt is open.
    
    Reproducer (very unreliable, but it worked for me after a few minutes):

    vt: vt_ioctl: fix VT_DISALLOCATE freeing in-use virtual console
    
    commit ca4463bf8438b403596edd0ec961ca0d4fbe0220 upstream.
    
    The VT_DISALLOCATE ioctl can free a virtual console while tty_release()
    is still running, causing a use-after-free in con_shutdown().  This
    occurs because VT_DISALLOCATE considers a virtual console's
    'struct vc_data' to be unused as soon as the corresponding tty's
    refcount hits 0.  But actually it may be still being closed.
    
    Fix this by making vc_data be reference-counted via the embedded
    'struct tty_port'.  A newly allocated virtual console has refcount 1.
    Opening it for the first time increments the refcount to 2.  Closing it
    for the last time decrements the refcount (in tty_operations::cleanup()
    so that it happens late enough), as does VT_DISALLOCATE.

    vt: vt_ioctl: remove unnecessary console allocation checks
    
    commit 1aa6e058dd6cd04471b1f21298270014daf48ac9 upstream.
    
    The vc_cons_allocated() checks in vt_ioctl() and vt_compat_ioctl() are
    unnecessary because they can only be reached by calling ioctl() on an
    open tty, which implies the corresponding virtual console is allocated.
    
    And even if the virtual console *could* be freed concurrently, then
    these checks would be broken since they aren't done under console_lock,
    and the vc_data is dereferenced before them anyway.
    
    So, remove these unneeded checks to avoid confusion.

    commit ce2e1ca703071723ca2dd94d492a5ab6d15050da upstream.
    
    mac80211 used to check port authorization in the Data frame enqueue case
    when going through start_xmit(). However, that authorization status may
    change while the frame is waiting in a queue. Add a similar check in the
    dequeue case to avoid sending previously accepted frames after
    authorization change. This provides additional protection against
    potential leaking of frames after a station has been disconnected and
    the keys for it are being removed.

    libfs: fix infoleak in simple_attr_read()
    
    commit a65cab7d7f05c2061a3e2490257d3086ff3202c6 upstream.
    
    Reading from a debugfs file at a nonzero position, without first reading
    at position 0, leaks uninitialized memory to userspace.
    
    It's a bit tricky to do this, since lseek() and pread() aren't allowed
    on these files, and write() doesn't update the position on them.  But
    writing to them with splice() *does* update the position:
    
            #define _GNU_SOURCE 1
            #include <fcntl.h>
            #include <stdio.h>
            #include <unistd.h>
            int main()
            {
                    int pipes[2], fd, n, i;
                    char buf[32];
    
                    pipe(pipes);
                    write(pipes[1], "0", 1);
                    fd = open("/sys/kernel/debug/fault_around_bytes", O_RDWR);
                    splice(pipes[0], NULL, fd, NULL, 1, 0);
                    n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
                    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
                            printf("%02x", buf[i]);
                    printf("\n");
            }
    
    Output:
            5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a30
    
    Fix the infoleak by making simple_attr_read() always fill
    simple_attr::get_buf if it hasn't been filled yet.

    media: usbtv: fix control-message timeouts
    
    commit 536f561d871c5781bc33d26d415685211b94032e upstream.
    
    The driver was issuing synchronous uninterruptible control requests
    without using a timeout. This could lead to the driver hanging on
    various user requests due to a malfunctioning (or malicious) device
    until the device is physically disconnected.
    
    The USB upper limit of five seconds per request should be more than
    enough.

    media: flexcop-usb: fix endpoint sanity check
    
    commit bca243b1ce0e46be26f7c63b5591dfbb41f558e5 upstream.
    
    commit 1b976fc6d684 ("media: b2c2-flexcop-usb: add sanity checking") added
    an endpoint sanity check to address a NULL-pointer dereference on probe.
    Unfortunately the check was done on the current altsetting which was later
    changed.
    
    Fix this by moving the sanity check to after the altsetting is changed.

    usb: musb: fix crash with highmen PIO and usbmon
    
    commit 52974d94a206ce428d9d9b6eaa208238024be82a upstream.
    
    When handling a PIO bulk transfer with highmem buffer, a temporary
    mapping is assigned to urb->transfer_buffer.  After the transfer is
    complete, an invalid address is left behind in this pointer.  This is
    not ordinarily a problem since nothing touches that buffer before the
    urb is released.  However, when usbmon is active, usbmon_urb_complete()
    calls (indirectly) mon_bin_get_data() which does access the transfer
    buffer if it is set.  To prevent an invalid memory access here, reset
    urb->transfer_buffer to NULL when finished (musb_host_rx()), or do not
    set it at all (musb_host_tx()).

    xfrm: fix uctx len check in verify_sec_ctx_len
    
    commit 171d449a028573b2f0acdc7f31ecbb045391b320 upstream.
    
    It's not sufficient to do 'uctx->len != (sizeof(struct xfrm_user_sec_ctx) +
    uctx->ctx_len)' check only, as uctx->len may be greater than nla_len(rt),
    in which case it will cause slab-out-of-bounds when accessing uctx->ctx_str

    This patch is to fix it by return -EINVAL when uctx->len > nla_len(rt).

    genirq: Fix reference leaks on irq affinity notifiers
    
    commit df81dfcfd6991d547653d46c051bac195cd182c1 upstream.
    
    The handling of notify->work did not properly maintain notify->kref in two
     cases:
    1) where the work was already scheduled, another irq_set_affinity_locked()
       would get the ref and (no-op-ly) schedule the work.  Thus when
       irq_affinity_notify() ran, it would drop the original ref but not the
       additional one.
    2) when cancelling the (old) work in irq_set_affinity_notifier(), if there
       was outstanding work a ref had been got for it but was never put.
    Fix both by checking the return values of the work handling functions
     (schedule_work() for (1) and cancel_work_sync() for (2)) and put the
     extra ref if the return value indicates preexisting work.

    RDMA/core: Ensure security pkey modify is not lost
    
    commit 2d47fbacf2725a67869f4d3634c2415e7dfab2f4 upstream.
    
    The following modify sequence (loosely based on ipoib) will lose a pkey
    modifcation:
    
    - Modify (pkey index, port)
    - Modify (new pkey index, NO port)
    
    After the first modify, the qp_pps list will have saved the pkey and the
    unit on the main list.
    
    During the second modify, get_new_pps() will fetch the port from qp_pps
    and read the new pkey index from qp_attr->pkey_index.  The state will
    still be zero, or IB_PORT_PKEY_NOT_VALID. Because of the invalid state,
    the new values will never replace the one in the qp pps list, losing the
    new pkey.
    
    This happens because the following if statements will never correct the
    state because the first term will be false. If the code had been executed,
    it would incorrectly overwrite valid values.
    
      if ((qp_attr_mask & IB_QP_PKEY_INDEX) && (qp_attr_mask & IB_QP_PORT))
              new_pps->main.state = IB_PORT_PKEY_VALID;
    
      if (!(qp_attr_mask & (IB_QP_PKEY_INDEX | IB_QP_PORT)) && qp_pps) {
              new_pps->main.port_num = qp_pps->main.port_num;
              new_pps->main.pkey_index = qp_pps->main.pkey_index;
              if (qp_pps->main.state != IB_PORT_PKEY_NOT_VALID)
                      new_pps->main.state = IB_PORT_PKEY_VALID;
      }
    
    Fix by joining the two if statements with an or test to see if qp_pps is
    non-NULL and in the correct state.

    gpiolib: acpi: Add quirk to ignore EC wakeups on HP x2 10 BYT + AXP288 model
    
    commit 0e91506ba00730f088961a8d39f8693b0f8e3fea upstream.
    
    Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
    quirk mechanism") was added to deal with spurious wakeups on one specific
    model of the HP x2 10 series. In the mean time I have learned that there
    are at least 3 different HP x2 10 models:
    
    Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
    Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
    
    And the original quirk is only correct for (and only matches the)
    Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC model.
    
    The Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC model has different DMI strings, has
    the external EC interrupt on a different GPIO pin and only needs to ignore
    wakeups on the EC interrupt, the INT0002 device works fine on this model.
    
    This commit adds an extra DMI based quirk for the HP x2 10 BYT + AXP288
    model, ignoring wakeups for ACPI GPIO events on the EC interrupt pin
    on this model. This fixes spurious wakeups from suspend on this model.

    gpiolib: acpi: Rework honor_wakeup option into an ignore_wake option
    
    commit 2ccb21f5516afef5e251184eeefbf36db90206d7 upstream.
    
    Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
    quirk mechanism") was added to deal with spurious wakeups on one specific
    model of the HP x2 10 series.
    
    The approach taken there was to add a bool controlling wakeup support for
    all ACPI GPIO events. This was sufficient for the specific HP x2 10 model
    the commit was trying to fix, but in the mean time other models have
    turned up which need a similar workaround to avoid spurious wakeups from
    suspend, but only for one of the pins on which the ACPI tables request
    ACPI GPIO events.
    
    Since the honor_wakeup option was added to be able to ignore wake events,
    the name was perhaps not the best, this commit renames it to ignore_wake
    and changes it to a string with the following format:
    gpiolib_acpi.ignore_wake=controller@pin[,controller@pin[,...]]
    
    This allows working around spurious wakeup issues on a per pin basis.
    
    This commit also reworks the existing quirk for the HP x2 10 so that
    it functions as before.
    
    Note:
    -This removes the honor_wakeup parameter. This has only been upstream for
     a short time and to the best of my knowledge there are no users using
     this module parameter.
    
    -The controller@pin[,controller@pin[,...]] syntax is based on an existing
     kernel module parameter using the same controller@pin format. That version
     uses ';' as separator, but in practice that is problematic because grub2
     cannot handle this without taking special care to escape the ';', so here
     we are using a ',' as separator instead which does not have this issue.

    gpiolib: acpi: Correct comment for HP x2 10 honor_wakeup quirk
    
    commit efaa87fa0947d525cf7c075316adde4e3ac7720b upstream.
    
    Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
    quirk mechanism") added a quirk for some models of the HP x2 10 series.
    
    There are 2 issues with the comment describing the quirk:
    1) The comment claims the DMI quirk applies to all Cherry Trail based HP x2
       10 models. In the mean time I have learned that there are at least 3
       models of the HP x2 10 models:
    
       Bay Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
       Cherry Trail SoC + AXP288 PMIC
       Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
    
       And this quirk's DMI matches only match the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC
       SoC, which is good because we want a slightly different quirk for the
       others. This commit updates the comment to make it clear that the quirk
       is only for the Cherry Trail SoC + TI PMIC models.
    
    2) The comment says that it is ok to disable wakeup on all ACPI GPIO event
       handlers, because there is only the one for the embedded-controller
       events. This is not true, there also is a handler for the special
       INT0002 device which is related to USB wakeups. We need to also disable
       wakeups on that one because the device turns of the USB-keyboard built
       into the dock when closing the lid. The XHCI controller takes a while
       to notice this, so it only notices it when already suspended, causing
       a spurious wakeup because of this. So disabling wakeup on all handlers
       is the right thing to do, but not because there only is the one handler
       for the EC events. This commit updates the comment to correctly reflect
       this.

    so before removing its keys. This allows frames transmitted to it
    to be rejected, providing additional protection against leaking

    scsi: sd: Fix optimal I/O size for devices that change reported values
    
    commit ea697a8bf5a4161e59806fab14f6e4a46dc7dcb0 upstream.
    
    Some USB bridge devices will return a default set of characteristics during
    initialization. And then, once an attached drive has spun up, substitute
    the actual parameters reported by the drive. According to the SCSI spec,
    the device should return a UNIT ATTENTION in case any reported parameters
    change. But in this case the change is made silently after a small window
    where default values are reported.
    
    Commit a83da8a4509d ("scsi: sd: Optimal I/O size should be a multiple of
    physical block size") validated the reported optimal I/O size against the
    physical block size to overcome problems with devices reporting nonsensical
    transfer sizes. However, this validation did not account for the fact that
    aforementioned devices will return default values during a brief window
    during spin-up. The subsequent change in reported characteristics would
    invalidate the checking that had previously been performed.
    
    Unset a previously configured optimal I/O size should the sanity checking
    fail on subsequent revalidate attempts.

    scripts/dtc: Remove redundant YYLOC global declaration
    
    commit e33a814e772cdc36436c8c188d8c42d019fda639 upstream.
    
    gcc 10 will default to -fno-common, which causes this error at link
    time:
    
      (.text+0x0): multiple definition of `yylloc'; dtc-lexer.lex.o (symbol from plugin):(.text+0x0): first defined here
    
    This is because both dtc-lexer as well as dtc-parser define the same
    global symbol yyloc. Before with -fcommon those were merged into one
    defintion. The proper solution would be to to mark this as "extern",
    however that leads to:
    
      dtc-lexer.l:26:16: error: redundant redeclaration of 'yylloc' [-Werror=redundant-decls]
       26 | extern YYLTYPE yylloc;
          |                ^~~~~~
    In file included from dtc-lexer.l:24:
    dtc-parser.tab.h:127:16: note: previous declaration of 'yylloc' was here
      127 | extern YYLTYPE yylloc;
          |                ^~~~~~
    cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
    
    which means the declaration is completely redundant and can just be
    dropped.

    tools: Let O= makes handle a relative path with -C option
    
    commit be40920fbf1003c38ccdc02b571e01a75d890c82 upstream.
    
    When I tried to compile tools/perf from the top directory with the -C
    option, the O= option didn't work correctly if I passed a relative path:
    
      $ make O=BUILD -C tools/perf/
      make: Entering directory '/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf'
        BUILD:   Doing 'make -j8' parallel build
      ../scripts/Makefile.include:4: *** O=/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf/BUILD does not exist.  Stop.
      make: *** [Makefile:70: all] Error 2
      make: Leaving directory '/home/mhiramat/ksrc/linux/tools/perf'
    
    The O= directory existence check failed because the check script ran in
    the build target directory instead of the directory where I ran the make
    command.
    
    To fix that, once change directory to $(PWD) and check O= directory,
    since the PWD is set to where the make command runs.

    perf probe: Do not depend on dwfl_module_addrsym()
    
    commit 1efde2754275dbd9d11c6e0132a4f09facf297ab upstream.
    
    Do not depend on dwfl_module_addrsym() because it can fail on user-space
    shared libraries.
    
    Actually, same bug was fixed by commit 664fee3dc379 ("perf probe: Do not
    use dwfl_module_addrsym if dwarf_diename finds symbol name"), but commit
    07d369857808 ("perf probe: Fix wrong address verification) reverted to
    get actual symbol address from symtab.
    
    This fixes it again by getting symbol address from DIE, and only if the
    DIE has only address range, it uses dwfl_module_addrsym().

    ARM: dts: omap5: Add bus_dma_limit for L3 bus
    
    commit dfa7ea303f56a3a8b1ed3b91ef35af2da67ca4ee upstream.
    
    The L3 interconnect's memory map is from 0x0 to
    0xffffffff. Out of this, System memory (SDRAM) can be
    accessed from 0x80000000 to 0xffffffff (2GB)
    
    OMAP5 does support 4GB of SDRAM but upper 2GB can only be
    accessed by the MPU subsystem.
    
    Add the dma-ranges property to reflect the physical address limit
    of the L3 bus.

    ARM: dts: dra7: Add bus_dma_limit for L3 bus
    
    commit cfb5d65f25959f724081bae8445a0241db606af6 upstream.
    
    The L3 interconnect's memory map is from 0x0 to
    0xffffffff. Out of this, System memory (SDRAM) can be
    accessed from 0x80000000 to 0xffffffff (2GB)
    
    DRA7 does support 4GB of SDRAM but upper 2GB can only be
    accessed by the MPU subsystem.
    
    Add the dma-ranges property to reflect the physical address limit
    of the L3 bus.
    
    Issues ere observed only with SATA on DRA7-EVM with 4GB RAM
    and CONFIG_ARM_LPAE enabled. This is because the controller
    supports 64-bit DMA and its driver sets the dma_mask to 64-bit
    thus resulting in DMA accesses beyond L3 limit of 2G.
    
    Setting the correct bus_dma_limit fixes the issue.

    This has already been documented in the code, but let's also make the fact
    that this is intentional clear to the semantic analysis tools such as sparse.

    This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in

            strncmp(opt, "eee_timer:", 6)
    
    the passed string literal: "eee_timer:" has 10 bytes (without the NULL
    byte) and the passed size argument is 6. As a result, the logic will
    also accept other, malformed strings, e.g. "eee_tiXXX:".

    module's cmdline parsing code.

    As a part of the scan process Linux will allocate and configure a
    scsi_device for each target to be scanned. If the device is not present,
    then the scsi_device is torn down. As a part of scsi_device teardown a
    workqueue item will be scheduled and the lockups we see are because there
    are 250k workqueue items to be processed.  Accoding to the specification of
    SIS-64 sas controller, max_channel should be decreased on SIS-64 adapters
    to 4.
    
    The patch fixes softlockup issue.
    
    Thanks for Oliver Halloran's help with debugging and explanation!

    dt-bindings: net: FMan erratum A050385
    
    [ Upstream commit 26d5bb9e4c4b541c475751e015072eb2cbf70d15 ]
    
    FMAN DMA read or writes under heavy traffic load may cause FMAN
    internal resource leak; thus stopping further packet processing.
    
    The FMAN internal queue can overflow when FMAN splits single
    read or write transactions into multiple smaller transactions
    such that more than 17 AXI transactions are in flight from FMAN
    to interconnect. When the FMAN internal queue overflows, it can
    stall further packet processing. The issue can occur with any one
    of the following three conditions:
    
      1. FMAN AXI transaction crosses 4K address boundary (Errata
         A010022)
      2. FMAN DMA address for an AXI transaction is not 16 byte
         aligned, i.e. the last 4 bits of an address are non-zero
      3. Scatter Gather (SG) frames have more than one SG buffer in
         the SG list and any one of the buffers, except the last
         buffer in the SG list has data size that is not a multiple
         of 16 bytes, i.e., other than 16, 32, 48, 64, etc.
    
    With any one of the above three conditions present, there is
    likelihood of stalled FMAN packet processing, especially under
    stress with multiple ports injecting line-rate traffic.
    
    To avoid situations that stall FMAN packet processing, all of the
    above three conditions must be avoided; therefore, configure the
    system with the following rules:
    
      1. Frame buffers must not span a 4KB address boundary, unless
         the frame start address is 256 byte aligned
      2. All FMAN DMA start addresses (for example, BMAN buffer
         address, FD[address] + FD[offset]) are 16B aligned
      3. SG table and buffer addresses are 16B aligned and the size
         of SG buffers are multiple of 16 bytes, except for the last
         SG buffer that can be of any size.
    
    Additional workaround notes:
    - Address alignment of 64 bytes is recommended for maximally
    efficient system bus transactions (although 16 byte alignment is
    sufficient to avoid the stall condition)
    - To support frame sizes that are larger than 4K bytes, there are
    two options:
      1. Large single buffer frames that span a 4KB page boundary can
         be converted into SG frames to avoid transaction splits at
         the 4KB boundary,
      2. Align the large single buffer to 256B address boundaries,
         ensure that the frame address plus offset is 256B aligned.
    - If software generated SG frames have buffers that are unaligned
    and with random non-multiple of 16 byte lengths, before
    transmitting such frames via FMAN, frames will need to be copied
    into a new single buffer or multiple buffer SG frame that is
    compliant with the three rules listed above.

    cgroup1: don't call release_agent when it is ""
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e5383d7904e60529136727e49629a82058a5607 ]
    
    Older (and maybe current) versions of systemd set release_agent to "" when
    shutting down, but do not set notify_on_release to 0.
    
    Since 64e90a8acb85 ("Introduce STATIC_USERMODEHELPER to mediate
    call_usermodehelper()"), we filter out such calls when the user mode helper
    path is "". However, when used in conjunction with an actual (i.e. non "")
    STATIC_USERMODEHELPER, the path is never "", so the real usermode helper
    will be called with argv[0] == "".
    
    Let's avoid this by not invoking the release_agent when it is "".

    net: ipv4: don't let PMTU updates increase route MTU
    
    [ Upstream commit 28d35bcdd3925e7293408cdb8aa5f2aac5f0d6e3 ]
    
    When an MTU update with PMTU smaller than net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu is
    received, we must clamp its value. However, we can receive a PMTU
    exception with PMTU < old_mtu < ip_rt_min_pmtu, which would lead to an
    increase in PMTU.
    
    To fix this, take the smallest of the old MTU and ip_rt_min_pmtu.
    
    Before this patch, in case of an update, the exception's MTU would
    always change. Now, an exception can have only its lock flag updated,
    but not the MTU, so we need to add a check on locking to the following
    "is this exception getting updated, or close to expiring?" test.

    The hsr module has been supporting the list and status command.
    (HSR_C_GET_NODE_LIST and HSR_C_GET_NODE_STATUS)
    These commands send node information to the user-space via generic netlink.
    But, in the non-init_net namespace, these commands are not allowed
    because .netnsok flag is false.
    So, there is no way to get node information in the non-init_net namespace.

    net: dsa: mt7530: Change the LINK bit to reflect the link status
    
    [ Upstream commit 22259471b51925353bd7b16f864c79fdd76e425e ]
    
    Andrew reported:
    
    After a number of network port link up/down changes, sometimes the switch
    port gets stuck in a state where it thinks it is still transmitting packets
    but the cpu port is not actually transmitting anymore. In this state you
    will see a message on the console
    "mtk_soc_eth 1e100000.ethernet eth0: transmit timed out" and the Tx counter
    in ifconfig will be incrementing on virtual port, but not incrementing on
    cpu port.
    
    The issue is that MAC TX/RX status has no impact on the link status or
    queue manager of the switch. So the queue manager just queues up packets
    of a disabled port and sends out pause frames when the queue is full.
    
    Change the LINK bit to reflect the link status.

    bnxt_en: fix memory leaks in bnxt_dcbnl_ieee_getets()
    
    [ Upstream commit 62d4073e86e62e316bea2c53e77db10418fd5dd7 ]
    
    The allocated ieee_ets structure goes out of scope without being freed,
    leaking memory. Appropriate result codes should be returned so that
    callers do not rely on invalid data passed by reference.
    
    Also cache the ETS config retrieved from the device so that it doesn't
    need to be freed. The balance of the code was clearly written with the
    intent of having the results of querying the hardware cached in the
    device structure. The commensurate store was evidently missed though.

    net_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d1c3530e1bd38382edef72591b78e877e0edcd3 ]
    
    In commit 599be01ee567 ("net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex")
    I moved cp->hash calculation before the first
    tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp->alloc_hash is left untouched.
    This difference could lead to another out of bound access.
    
    cp->alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we should
    update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().

    net_sched: cls_route: remove the right filter from hashtable
    
    [ Upstream commit ef299cc3fa1a9e1288665a9fdc8bff55629fd359 ]
    
    route4_change() allocates a new filter and copies values from
    the old one. After the new filter is inserted into the hash
    table, the old filter should be removed and freed, as the final
    step of the update.
    
    However, the current code mistakenly removes the new one. This
    looks apparently wrong to me, and it causes double "free" and
    use-after-free too, as reported by syzbot.

    net/packet: tpacket_rcv: avoid a producer race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit 61fad6816fc10fb8793a925d5c1256d1c3db0cd2 ]
    
    PACKET_RX_RING can cause multiple writers to access the same slot if a
    fast writer wraps the ring while a slow writer is still copying. This
    is particularly likely with few, large, slots (e.g., GSO packets).
    
    Synchronize kernel thread ownership of rx ring slots with a bitmap.
    
    Writers acquire a slot race-free by testing tp_status TP_STATUS_KERNEL
    while holding the sk receive queue lock. They release this lock before
    copying and set tp_status to TP_STATUS_USER to release to userspace
    when done. During copying, another writer may take the lock, also see
    TP_STATUS_KERNEL, and start writing to the same slot.
    
    Introduce a new rx_owner_map bitmap with a bit per slot. To acquire a
    slot, test and set with the lock held. To release race-free, update
    tp_status and owner bit as a transaction, so take the lock again.
    
    This is the one of a variety of discussed options (see Link below):
    
    * instead of a shadow ring, embed the data in the slot itself, such as
    in tp_padding. But any test for this field may match a value left by
    userspace, causing deadlock.
    
    * avoid the lock on release. This leaves a small race if releasing the
    shadow slot before setting TP_STATUS_USER. The below reproducer showed
    that this race is not academic. If releasing the slot after tp_status,
    the race is more subtle. See the first link for details.
    
    * add a new tp_status TP_KERNEL_OWNED to avoid the transactional store
    of two fields. But, legacy applications may interpret all non-zero
    tp_status as owned by the user. As libpcap does. So this is possible
    only opt-in by newer processes. It can be added as an optional mode.
    
    * embed the struct at the tail of pg_vec to avoid extra allocation.
    The implementation proved no less complex than a separate field.
    
    The additional locking cost on release adds contention, no different
    than scaling on multicore or multiqueue h/w. In practice, below
    reproducer nor small packet tcpdump showed a noticeable change in
    perf report in cycles spent in spinlock. Where contention is
    problematic, packet sockets support mitigation through PACKET_FANOUT.
    And we can consider adding opt-in state TP_KERNEL_OWNED.
    
    Easy to reproduce by running multiple netperf or similar TCP_STREAM
    flows concurrently with `tcpdump -B 129 -n greater 60000`.
    
    Based on an earlier patchset by Jon Rosen. See links below.
    
    I believe this issue goes back to the introduction of tpacket_rcv,
    which predates git history.

    hsr: fix general protection fault in hsr_addr_is_self()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a303cfdd28d5f930a307c82e8a9d996394d5ebd ]
    
    The port->hsr is used in the hsr_handle_frame(), which is a
    callback of rx_handler.
    hsr master and slaves are initialized in hsr_add_port().
    This function initializes several pointers, which includes port->hsr after
    registering rx_handler.
    So, in the rx_handler routine, un-initialized pointer would be used.
    In order to fix this, pointers should be initialized before
    registering rx_handler.

    Revert "drm/dp_mst: Skip validating ports during destruction, just ref"
    
    commit 9765635b30756eb74e05e260ac812659c296cd28 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit:
    
    c54c7374ff44 ("drm/dp_mst: Skip validating ports during destruction, just ref")
    
    ugh.
    
    In drm_dp_destroy_connector_work(), we have a pretty good chance of
    freeing the actual struct drm_dp_mst_port. However, after destroying
    things we send a hotplug through (*mgr->cbs->hotplug)(mgr) which is
    where the problems start.
    
    For i915, this calls all the way down to the fbcon probing helpers,
    which start trying to access the port in a modeset.

    So, this definitely isn't a fix that we want. This being said; there's
    no real easy fix for this problem because of some of the catch-22's of
    the MST helpers current design. For starters; we always need to validate
    a port with drm_dp_get_validated_port_ref(), but validation relies on
    the lifetime of the port in the actual topology. So once the port is
    gone, it can't be validated again.
    
    If we were to try to make the payload helpers not use port validation,
    then we'd cause another problem: if the port isn't validated, it could
    be freed and we'd just start causing more KASAN issues. There are
    already hacks that attempt to workaround this in
    drm_dp_mst_destroy_connector_work() by re-initializing the kref so that
    it can be used again and it's memory can be freed once the VCPI helpers
    finish removing the port's respective payloads. But none of these really
    do anything helpful since the port still can't be validated since it's
    gone from the topology. Also, that workaround is immensely confusing to
    read through.
    
    What really needs to be done in order to fix this is to teach DRM how to
    track the lifetime of the structs for MST ports and branch devices
    separately from their lifetime in the actual topology. Simply put; this
    means having two different krefs-one that removes the port/branch device
    from the topology, and one that finally calls kfree(). This would let us
    simplify things, since we'd now be able to keep ports around without
    having to keep them in the topology at the same time, which is exactly
    what we need in order to teach our VCPI helpers to only validate ports
    when it's actually necessary without running the risk of trying to use
    unallocated memory.
    
    Such a fix is on it's way, but for now let's play it safe and just
    revert this. If this bug has been around for well over a year, we can
    wait a little while to get an actual proper fix here.

    staging: greybus: loopback_test: fix potential path truncations
    
    commit ae62cf5eb2792d9a818c2d93728ed92119357017 upstream.
    
    Newer GCC warns about possible truncations of two generated path names as
    we're concatenating the configurable sysfs and debugfs path prefixes
    with a filename and placing the results in buffers of the same size as
    the maximum length of the prefixes.
    
            snprintf(d->name, MAX_STR_LEN, "gb_loopback%u", dev_id);
    
            snprintf(d->sysfs_entry, MAX_SYSFS_PATH, "%s%s/",
                     t->sysfs_prefix, d->name);
    
            snprintf(d->debugfs_entry, MAX_SYSFS_PATH, "%sraw_latency_%s",
                     t->debugfs_prefix, d->name);
    
    Fix this by separating the maximum path length from the maximum prefix
    length and reducing the latter enough to fit the generated strings.
    
    Note that we also need to reduce the device-name buffer size as GCC
    isn't smart enough to figure out that we ever only used MAX_STR_LEN
    bytes of it.

    Newer GCC warns about a possible truncation of a generated sysfs path

    arm64: smp: fix crash_smp_send_stop() behaviour
    
    commit f50b7dacccbab2b9e3ef18f52a6dcc18ed2050b9 upstream.
    
    On a system configured to trigger a crash_kexec() reboot, when only one CPU
    is online and another CPU panics while starting-up, crash_smp_send_stop()
    will fail to send any STOP message to the other already online core,
    resulting in fail to freeze and registers not properly saved.
    
    Moreover even if the proper messages are sent (case CPUs > 2)
    it will similarly fail to account for the booting CPU when executing
    the final stop wait-loop, so potentially resulting in some CPU not
    been waited for shutdown before rebooting.
    
    A tangible effect of this behaviour can be observed when, after a panic
    with kexec enabled and loaded, on the following reboot triggered by kexec,
    the cpu that could not be successfully stopped fails to come back online:

    futex: Unbreak futex hashing
    
    commit 8d67743653dce5a0e7aa500fcccb237cde7ad88e upstream.
    
    The recent futex inode life time fix changed the ordering of the futex key
    union struct members, but forgot to adjust the hash function accordingly,
    
    As a result the hashing omits the leading 64bit and even hashes beyond the
    futex key causing a bad hash distribution which led to a ~100% performance
    regression.
    
    Hand in the futex key pointer instead of a random struct member and make
    the size calculation based of the struct offset.

    commit 8019ad13ef7f64be44d4f892af9c840179009254 upstream.
    
    As reported by Jann, ihold() does not in fact guarantee inode
    persistence. And instead of making it so, replace the usage of inode
    pointers with a per boot, machine wide, unique inode identifier.
    
    This sequence number is global, but shared (file backed) futexes are
    rare enough that this should not become a performance issue.

    kbuild: Disable -Wpointer-to-enum-cast
    
    commit 82f2bc2fcc0160d6f82dd1ac64518ae0a4dd183f upstream.
    
    Clang's -Wpointer-to-int-cast deviates from GCC in that it warns when
    casting to enums. The kernel does this in certain places, such as device
    tree matches to set the version of the device being used, which allows
    the kernel to avoid using a gigantic union.
    
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5.8/source/drivers/ata/ahci_brcm.c#L428
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5.8/source/drivers/ata/ahci_brcm.c#L402
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5.8/source/include/linux/mod_devicetable.h#L264
    
    To avoid a ton of false positive warnings, disable this particular part
    of the warning, which has been split off into a separate diagnostic so
    that the entire warning does not need to be turned off for clang. It
    will be visible under W=1 in case people want to go about fixing these
    easily and enabling the warning treewide.

    iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: fix channel configuration for differential channels
    
    [ Upstream commit f0c8d1f6dc8eac5a1fbf441c8e080721a7b6c0ff ]
    
    When iterating through the channels, the index in the array is not the
    scan index. Added an xlate function to translate to the proper index.
    The result of the bug is that the channel array is indexed with a wrong index,
    thus instead of the proper channel, we access invalid memory, which may
    lead to invalid results and/or corruption.
    This will be used also for devicetree channel xlate.

    USB: cdc-acm: fix rounding error in TIOCSSERIAL
    
    [ Upstream commit b401f8c4f492cbf74f3f59c9141e5be3071071bb ]
    
    By default, tty_port_init() initializes those parameters to a multiple
    of HZ. For instance in line 69 of tty_port.c:
       port->close_delay = (50 * HZ) / 100;
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/tty/tty_port.c#L69
    
    With e.g. CONFIG_HZ = 250 (as this is the case for Ubuntu 18.04
    linux-image-4.15.0-37-generic), the default setting for close_delay is
    thus 125.
    
    When ioctl(fd, TIOCGSERIAL, &s) is executed, the setting returned in
    user space is '12' (125/10). When ioctl(fd, TIOCSSERIAL, &s) is then
    executed with the same setting '12', the value is interpreted as '120'
    which is different from the current setting and a EPERM error may be
    raised by set_serial_info() if !CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

    x86/mm: split vmalloc_sync_all()
    
    commit 763802b53a427ed3cbd419dbba255c414fdd9e7c upstream.
    
    Commit 3f8fd02b1bf1 ("mm/vmalloc: Sync unmappings in
    __purge_vmap_area_lazy()") introduced a call to vmalloc_sync_all() in
    the vunmap() code-path.  While this change was necessary to maintain
    correctness on x86-32-pae kernels, it also adds additional cycles for
    architectures that don't need it.
    
    Specifically on x86-64 with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y some people reported
    severe performance regressions in micro-benchmarks because it now also
    calls the x86-64 implementation of vmalloc_sync_all() on vunmap().  But
    the vmalloc_sync_all() implementation on x86-64 is only needed for newly
    created mappings.
    
    To avoid the unnecessary work on x86-64 and to gain the performance
    back, split up vmalloc_sync_all() into two functions:
    
            * vmalloc_sync_mappings(), and
            * vmalloc_sync_unmappings()
    
    Most call-sites to vmalloc_sync_all() only care about new mappings being
    synchronized.  The only exception is the new call-site added in the
    above mentioned commit.
    
    Shile Zhang directed us to a report of an 80% regression in reaim
    throughput.

    This is a PowerPC platform with following NUMA topology:

      node distances:
      node   0   1
        0:  10  40
        1:  40  10
    
      possible numa nodes: 0-31
    
    This only happens with a mmotm patch "mm/memcontrol.c: allocate
    shrinker_map on appropriate NUMA node" [2] which effectively calls
    kmalloc_node for each possible node.  SLUB however only allocates
    kmem_cache_node on online N_NORMAL_MEMORY nodes, and relies on
    node_to_mem_node to return such valid node for other nodes since commit
    a561ce00b09e ("slub: fall back to node_to_mem_node() node if allocating
    on memoryless node").  This is however not true in this configuration
    where the _node_numa_mem_ array is not initialized for nodes 0 and 2-31,
    thus it contains zeroes and get_partial() ends up accessing
    non-allocated kmem_cache_node.
    
    A related issue was reported by Bharata (originally by Ramachandran) [3]
    where a similar PowerPC configuration, but with mainline kernel without
    patch [2] ends up allocating large amounts of pages by kmalloc-1k
    kmalloc-512.  This seems to have the same underlying issue with
    node_to_mem_node() not behaving as expected, and might probably also
    lead to an infinite loop with CONFIG_SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL [4].
    
    This patch should fix both issues by not relying on node_to_mem_node()
    anymore and instead simply falling back to NUMA_NO_NODE, when
    kmalloc_node(node) is attempted for a node that's not online, or has no
    usable memory.  The "usable memory" condition is also changed from
    node_present_pages() to N_NORMAL_MEMORY node state, as that is exactly
    the condition that SLUB uses to allocate kmem_cache_node structures.
    The check in get_partial() is removed completely, as the checks in
    ___slab_alloc() are now sufficient to prevent get_partial() being
    reached with an invalid node.

    mm: slub: be more careful about the double cmpxchg of freelist
    
    commit 5076190daded2197f62fe92cf69674488be44175 upstream.
    
    This is just a cleanup addition to Jann's fix to properly update the
    transaction ID for the slub slowpath in commit fd4d9c7d0c71 ("mm: slub:
    add missing TID bump..").
    
    The transaction ID is what protects us against any concurrent accesses,
    but we should really also make sure to make the 'freelist' comparison
    itself always use the same freelist value that we then used as the new
    next free pointer.
    
    Jann points out that if we do all of this carefully, we could skip the
    transaction ID update for all the paths that only remove entries from
    the lists, and only update the TID when adding entries (to avoid the ABA
    issue with cmpxchg and list handling re-adding a previously seen value).
    
    But this patch just does the "make sure to cmpxchg the same value we
    used" rather than then try to be clever.

    memcg: fix NULL pointer dereference in __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event

    An eventfd monitors multiple memory thresholds of the cgroup, closes them,

    are deleted, another eventfd monitors the memory threshold of this cgroup,
    leading to a crash:

    We can reproduce this problem in the following ways:
    
    1. We create a new cgroup subdirectory and a new eventfd, and then we
       monitor multiple memory thresholds of the cgroup through this eventfd.
    
    2.  closing this eventfd, and __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event ()
       will be called multiple times to delete all events related to this
       eventfd.
    
    The first time __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event() is called, the
    kernel will clear all items related to this eventfd in thresholds->
    primary.
    
    Since there is currently only one eventfd, thresholds-> primary becomes
    empty, so the kernel will set thresholds-> primary and hresholds-> spare
    to NULL.  If at this time, the user creates a new eventfd and monitor
    the memory threshold of this cgroup, kernel will re-initialize
    thresholds-> primary.
    
    Then when __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event () is called for the
    second time, because thresholds-> primary is not empty, the system will
    access thresholds-> spare, but thresholds-> spare is NULL, which will
    trigger a crash.
    
    In general, the longer it takes to delete all events related to this
    eventfd, the easier it is to trigger this problem.
    
    The solution is to check whether the thresholds associated with the
    eventfd has been cleared when deleting the event.  If so, we do nothing.

    xhci: Do not open code __print_symbolic() in xhci trace events
    
    commit 045706bff837ee89c13f1ace173db71922c1c40b upstream.
    
    libtraceevent (used by perf and trace-cmd) failed to parse the
    xhci_urb_dequeue trace event. This is because the user space trace
    event format parsing is not a full C compiler. It can handle some basic
    logic, but is not meant to be able to handle everything C can do.
    
    In cases where a trace event field needs to be converted from a number
    to a string, there's the __print_symbolic() macro that should be used:
    
     See samples/trace_events/trace-events-sample.h
    
    Some xhci trace events open coded the __print_symbolic() causing the
    user spaces tools to fail to parse it. This has to be replaced with
    __print_symbolic() instead.

    commit b500c086e4110829a308c23e83a7cdc65b26228a upstream.
    
    At the moment, reading from in_magn_*_raw in sysfs tends to return
    large values around 65000, even though the output of ak8974 is actually
    limited to ±32768. This happens because the value is never converted
    to the signed 16-bit integer variant.
    
    Add an explicit cast to s16 to fix this.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Remove WARNING from snd_pcm_plug_alloc() checks
    
    commit 5461e0530c222129dfc941058be114b5cbc00837 upstream.
    
    The return value checks in snd_pcm_plug_alloc() are covered with
    snd_BUG_ON() macro that may trigger a kernel WARNING depending on the
    kconfig.  But since the error condition can be triggered by a weird
    user space parameter passed to OSS layer, we shouldn't give the kernel
    stack trace just for that.  As it's a normal error condition, let's
    remove snd_BUG_ON() macro usage there.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Avoid plugin buffer overflow
    
    commit f2ecf903ef06eb1bbbfa969db9889643d487e73a upstream.
    
    Each OSS PCM plugins allocate its internal buffer per pre-calculation
    of the max buffer size through the chain of plugins (calling
    src_frames and dst_frames callbacks).  This works for most plugins,
    but the rate plugin might behave incorrectly.  The calculation in the
    rate plugin involves with the fractional position, i.e. it may vary
    depending on the input position.  Since the buffer size
    pre-calculation is always done with the offset zero, it may return a
    shorter size than it might be; this may result in the out-of-bound
    access as spotted by fuzzer.
    
    This patch addresses those possible buffer overflow accesses by simply
    setting the upper limit per the given buffer size for each plugin
    before src_frames() and after dst_frames() calls.

    commit 4384f167ce5fa7241b61bb0984d651bc528ddebe upstream.
    
    The virmidi driver handles sysex event exceptionally in a short-cut
    snd_seq_dump_var_event() call, but this missed the reset of the
    running status.  As a result, it may lead to an incomplete command
    right after the sysex when an event with the same running status was
    queued.
    
    Fix it by clearing the running status properly via alling
    snd_midi_event_reset_decode() for that code path.

    ALSA: line6: Fix endless MIDI read loop
    
    commit d683469b3c93d7e2afd39e6e1970f24700eb7a68 upstream.
    
    The MIDI input event parser of the LINE6 driver may enter into an
    endless loop when the unexpected data sequence is given, as it tries
    to continue the secondary bytes without termination.  Also, when the
    input data is too short, the parser returns a negative error, while
    the caller doesn't handle it properly.  This would lead to the
    unexpected behavior as well.
    
    This patch addresses those issues by checking the return value
    correctly and handling the one-byte event in the parser properly.
    
    The bug was reported by syzkaller.

    usb: quirks: add NO_LPM quirk for RTL8153 based ethernet adapters
    
    commit 75d7676ead19b1fbb5e0ee934c9ccddcb666b68c upstream.
    
    We have been receiving bug reports that ethernet connections over
    RTL8153 based ethernet adapters stops working after a while with
    errors like these showing up in dmesg when the ethernet stops working:
    
    [12696.189484] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    [12702.333456] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    [12707.965422] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    
    This has been reported on Dell WD15 docks, Belkin USB-C Express Dock 3.1
    docks and with generic USB to ethernet dongles using the RTL8153
    chipsets. Some users have tried adding usbcore.quirks=0bda:8153:k to
    the kernel commandline and all users who have tried this report that
    this fixes this.
    
    Also note that we already have an existing NO_LPM quirk for the RTL8153
    used in the Microsoft Surface Dock (where it uses a different usb-id).
    
    This commit adds a NO_LPM quirk for the generic Realtek RTL8153
    0bda:8153 usb-id, fixing the Tx timeout errors on these devices.

    block, bfq: fix overwrite of bfq_group pointer in bfq_find_set_group()
    
    [ Upstream commit 14afc59361976c0ba39e3a9589c3eaa43ebc7e1d ]
    
    The bfq_find_set_group() function takes as input a blkcg (which represents
    a cgroup) and retrieves the corresponding bfq_group, then it updates the
    bfq internal group hierarchy (see comments inside the function for why
    this is needed) and finally it returns the bfq_group.
    In the hierarchy update cycle, the pointer holding the correct bfq_group
    that has to be returned is mistakenly used to traverse the hierarchy
    bottom to top, meaning that in each iteration it gets overwritten with the
    parent of the current group. Since the update cycle stops at root's
    children (depth = 2), the overwrite becomes a problem only if the blkcg
    describes a cgroup at a hierarchy level deeper than that (depth > 2). In
    this case the root's child that happens to be also an ancestor of the
    correct bfq_group is returned. The main consequence is that processes
    contained in a cgroup at depth greater than 2 are wrongly placed in the
    group described above by BFQ.
    
    This commits fixes this problem by using a different bfq_group pointer in
    the update cycle in order to avoid the overwrite of the variable holding
    the original group reference.

    altera-stapl: altera_get_note: prevent write beyond end of 'key'
    
    [ Upstream commit 3745488e9d599916a0b40d45d3f30e3d4720288e ]
    
    altera_get_note is called from altera_init, where key is kzalloc(33).
    
    When the allocation functions are annotated to allow the compiler to see
    the sizes of objects, and with FORTIFY_SOURCE, we see:
    
    In file included from drivers/misc/altera-stapl/altera.c:14:0:
    In function ‘strlcpy’,
        inlined from ‘altera_init’ at drivers/misc/altera-stapl/altera.c:2189:5:
    include/linux/string.h:378:4: error: call to ‘__write_overflow’ declared with attribute error: detected write beyond size of object passed as 1st parameter
        __write_overflow();
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    That refers to this code in altera_get_note:
    
        if (key != NULL)
                strlcpy(key, &p[note_strings +
                                get_unaligned_be32(
                                &p[note_table + (8 * i)])],
                        length);
    
    The error triggers because the length of 'key' is 33, but the copy
    uses length supplied as the 'length' parameter, which is always
    256. Split the size parameter into key_len and val_len, and use the
    appropriate length depending on what is being copied.
    
    Detected by compiler error, only compile-tested.

    Writing to the built-in strings arrays doesn't work if driver is loaded
    as kernel module. This is also considered as a bad pattern. Fix this by
    adding a call to clk_get() with legacy clock name. This fixes following

    spi/zynqmp: remove entry that causes a cs glitch
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dd8304981ecffa77bb72b1c57c4be5dfe6cfae9 ]
    
    In the public interface for chipselect, there is always an entry
    commented as "Dummy generic FIFO entry" pushed down to the fifo right
    after the activate/deactivate command. The dummy entry is 0x0,
    irregardless if the intention was to activate or deactive the cs. This
    causes the cs line to glitch rather than beeing activated in the case
    when there was an activate command.
    
    This has been observed on oscilloscope, and have caused problems for at
    least one specific flash device type connected to the qspi port. After
    the change the glitch is gone and cs goes active when intended.
    
    The reason why this worked before (except for the glitch) was because
    when sending the actual data, the CS bits are once again set. Since
    most flashes uses mode 0, there is always a half clk period anyway for
    cs to clk active setup time. If someone would rely on timing from a
    chip_select call to a transfer_one, it would fail though.
    
    It is unknown why the dummy entry was there in the first place, git log
    seems to be of no help in this case. The reference manual gives no
    indication of the necessity of this. In fact the lower 8 bits are a
    setup (or hold in case of deactivate) time expressed in cycles. So this
    should not be needed to fulfill any setup/hold timings.

    spi: pxa2xx: Add CS control clock quirk
    
    [ Upstream commit 683f65ded66a9a7ff01ed7280804d2132ebfdf7e ]
    
    In some circumstances on Intel LPSS controllers, toggling the LPSS
    CS control register doesn't actually cause the CS line to toggle.
    This seems to be failure of dynamic clock gating that occurs after
    going through a suspend/resume transition, where the controller
    is sent through a reset transition. This ruins SPI transactions
    that either rely on delay_usecs, or toggle the CS line without
    sending data.
    
    Whenever CS is toggled, momentarily set the clock gating register
    to "Force On" to poke the controller into acting on CS.

    ARM: dts: dra7: Add "dma-ranges" property to PCIe RC DT nodes
    
    [ Upstream commit 27f13774654ea6bd0b6fc9b97cce8d19e5735661 ]
    
    'dma-ranges' in a PCI bridge node does correctly set dma masks for PCI
    devices not described in the DT. Certain DRA7 platforms (e.g., DRA76)
    has RAM above 32-bit boundary (accessible with LPAE config) though the
    PCIe bridge will be able to access only 32-bits. Add 'dma-ranges'
    property in PCIe RC DT nodes to indicate the host bridge can access
    only 32 bits.
