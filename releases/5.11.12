    Before IO threads accepted signals, the freezer using take signals to wake

    riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before enabling user access
    
    commit 285a76bb2cf51b0c74c634f2aaccdb93e1f2a359 upstream.
    
    The <asm/uaccess.h> header has a problem with put_user(a, ptr) if
    the 'a' is not a simple variable, such as a function. This can lead
    to the compiler producing code as so:
    
    1:      enable_user_access()
    2:      evaluate 'a' into register 'r'
    3:      put 'r' to 'ptr'
    4:      disable_user_acess()
    
    The issue is that 'a' is now being evaluated with the user memory
    protections disabled. So we try and force the evaulation by assigning
    'x' to __val at the start, and hoping the compiler barriers in
     enable_user_access() do the job of ordering step 2 before step 1.
    
    This has shown up in a bug where 'a' sleeps and thus schedules out
    and loses the SR_SUM flag. This isn't sufficient to fully fix, but
    should reduce the window of opportunity. The first instance of this
    we found is in scheudle_tail() where the code does:
    
    $ less -N kernel/sched/core.c
    
    4263  if (current->set_child_tid)
    4264         put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);
    
    Here, the task_pid_vnr(current) is called within the block that has
    enabled the user memory access. This can be made worse with KASAN
    which makes task_pid_vnr() a rather large call with plenty of
    opportunity to sleep.

    driver core: clear deferred probe reason on probe retry
    
    commit f0acf637d60ffcef3ccb6e279f743e587b3c7359 upstream.
    
    When retrying a deferred probe, any old defer reason string should be
    discarded. Otherwise, if the probe is deferred again at a different spot,
    but without setting a message, the now incorrect probe reason will remain.
    
    This was observed with the i.MX I2C driver, which ultimately failed
    to probe due to lack of the GPIO driver. The probe defer for GPIO
    doesn't record a message, but a previous probe defer to clock_get did.
    This had the effect that /sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred listed
    a misleading probe deferral reason.

    staging: rtl8192e: Change state information from u16 to u8
    
    commit e78836ae76d20f38eed8c8c67f21db97529949da upstream.
    
    The "u16 CcxRmState[2];" array field in struct "rtllib_network" has 4
    bytes in total while the operations performed on this array through-out
    the code base are only 2 bytes.
    
    The "CcxRmState" field is fed only 2 bytes of data using memcpy():
    
    (In rtllib_rx.c:1972)
            memcpy(network->CcxRmState, &info_element->data[4], 2)
    
    With "info_element->data[]" being a u8 array, if 2 bytes are written
    into "CcxRmState" (whose one element is u16 size), then the 2 u8
    elements from "data[]" gets squashed and written into the first element
    ("CcxRmState[0]") while the second element ("CcxRmState[1]") is never
    fed with any data.
    
    Same in file rtllib_rx.c:2522:
             memcpy(dst->CcxRmState, src->CcxRmState, 2);
    
    The above line duplicates "src" data to "dst" but only writes 2 bytes
    (and not 4, which is the actual size). Again, only 1st element gets the
    value while the 2nd element remains uninitialized.
    
    This later makes operations done with CcxRmState unpredictable in the
    following lines as the 1st element is having a squashed number while the
    2nd element is having an uninitialized random number.
    
    rtllib_rx.c:1973:    if (network->CcxRmState[0] != 0)
    rtllib_rx.c:1977:    network->MBssidMask = network->CcxRmState[1] & 0x07;
    
    network->MBssidMask is also of type u8 and not u16.
    
    Fix this by changing the type of "CcxRmState" from u16 to u8 so that the
    data written into this array and read from it make sense and are not
    random values.
    
    NOTE: The wrong initialization of "CcxRmState" can be seen in the
    following commit:
    
    commit ecdfa44610fa ("Staging: add Realtek 8192 PCI wireless driver")
    
    The above commit created a file `rtl8192e/ieee80211.h` which used to
    have the faulty line. The file has been deleted (or possibly renamed)
    with the contents copied in to a new file `rtl8192e/rtllib.h` along with

    staging: rtl8192e: Fix incorrect source in memcpy()
    
    commit 72ad25fbbb78930f892b191637359ab5b94b3190 upstream.
    
    The variable "info_element" is of the following type:
    
            struct rtllib_info_element *info_element
    
    defined in drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib.h:
    
            struct rtllib_info_element {
                    u8 id;
                    u8 len;
                    u8 data[];
            } __packed;
    
    The "len" field defines the size of the "data[]" array. The code is
    supposed to check if "info_element->len" is greater than 4 and later
    equal to 6. If this is satisfied then, the last two bytes (the 4th and
    5th element of u8 "data[]" array) are copied into "network->CcxRmState".
    
    Right now the code uses "memcpy()" with the source as "&info_element[4]"
    which would copy in wrong and unintended information. The struct
    "rtllib_info_element" has a size of 2 bytes for "id" and "len",
    therefore indexing will be done in interval of 2 bytes. So,
    "info_element[4]" would point to data which is beyond the memory
    allocated for this pointer (that is, at x+8, while "info_element" has
    been allocated only from x to x+7 (2 + 6 => 8 bytes)).
    
    This patch rectifies this error by using "&info_element->data[4]" which
    correctly copies the last two bytes of "data[]".
    
    NOTE: The faulty line of code came from the following commit:
    
    commit ecdfa44610fa ("Staging: add Realtek 8192 PCI wireless driver")
    
    The above commit created the file `rtl8192e/ieee80211/ieee80211_rx.c`
    which had the faulty line of code. This file has been deleted (or
    possibly renamed) with the contents copied in to a new file
    `rtl8192e/rtllib_rx.c` along with additional code in the commit

    commit 29d96eb261345c8d888e248ae79484e681be2faa upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 048eb908a1f2 ("soc: qcom-geni-se: Add interconnect
    support to fix earlycon crash")
    
    ICC core and platforms drivers supports sync_state feature, which
    ensures that the default ICC BW votes from the bootloader is not
    removed until all it's consumers are probes.
    
    The proxy votes were needed in case other QUP child drivers
    I2C, SPI probes before UART, they can turn off the QUP-CORE clock
    which is shared resources for all QUP driver, this causes unclocked
    access to HW from earlycon.
    
    Given above support from ICC there is no longer need to maintain
    proxy votes on QUP-CORE ICC node from QUP wrapper driver for early
    console usecase, the default votes won't be removed until real
    console is probed.

    usb: gadget: udc: amd5536udc_pci fix null-ptr-dereference
    
    commit 72035f4954f0bca2d8c47cf31b3629c42116f5b7 upstream.
    
    init_dma_pools() calls dma_pool_create(...dev->dev) to create dma pool.
    however, dev->dev is actually set after calling init_dma_pools(), which
    effectively makes dma_pool_create(..NULL) and cause crash.
    To fix this issue, init dma only after dev->dev is set.

    commit 4e49bf376c0451ad2eae2592e093659cde12be9a upstream.
    
    If tty-device registration fails the driver would fail to release the
    data interface. When the device is later disconnected, the disconnect
    callback would still be called for the data interface and would go about
    releasing already freed resources.

    USB: quirks: ignore remote wake-up on Fibocom L850-GL LTE modem
    
    commit 0bd860493f81eb2a46173f6f5e44cc38331c8dbd upstream.
    
    This LTE modem (M.2 card) has a bug in its power management:
    there is some kind of race condition for U3 wake-up between the host and
    the device. The modem firmware sometimes crashes/locks when both events
    happen at the same time and the modem fully drops off the USB bus (and
    sometimes re-enumerates, sometimes just gets stuck until the next
    reboot).
    
    Tested with the modem wired to the XHCI controller on an AMD 3015Ce
    platform. Without the patch, the modem dropped of the USB bus 5 times in
    3 days. With the quirk, it stayed connected for a week while the
    'runtime_suspended_time' counter incremented as excepted.

    firewire: nosy: Fix a use-after-free bug in nosy_ioctl()
    
    [ Upstream commit 829933ef05a951c8ff140e814656d73e74915faf ]
    
    For each device, the nosy driver allocates a pcilynx structure.
    A use-after-free might happen in the following scenario:
    
     1. Open nosy device for the first time and call ioctl with command
        NOSY_IOC_START, then a new client A will be malloced and added to
        doubly linked list.
     2. Open nosy device for the second time and call ioctl with command
        NOSY_IOC_START, then a new client B will be malloced and added to
        doubly linked list.
     3. Call ioctl with command NOSY_IOC_START for client A, then client A
        will be readded to the doubly linked list. Now the doubly linked
        list is messed up.
     4. Close the first nosy device and nosy_release will be called. In
        nosy_release, client A will be unlinked and freed.
     5. Close the second nosy device, and client A will be referenced,
        resulting in UAF.
    
    The root cause of this bug is that the element in the doubly linked list
    is reentered into the list.
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check before inserting a client.  If a client
    is already in the linked list, don't insert it.
    
    The following KASAN report reveals it:

    powerpc/mm/book3s64: Use the correct storage key value when calling H_PROTECT
    
    [ Upstream commit 53f1d31708f6240e4615b0927df31f182e389e2f ]
    
    H_PROTECT expects the flag value to include flags:
      AVPN, pp0, pp1, pp2, key0-key4, Noexec, CMO Option flags
    
    This patch updates hpte_updatepp() to fetch the storage key value from
    the linux page table and use the same in H_PROTECT hcall.
    
    native_hpte_updatepp() is not updated because the kernel doesn't clear
    the existing storage key value there. The kernel also doesn't use
    hpte_updatepp() callback for updating storage keys.
    
    This fixes the below kernel crash observed with KUAP enabled.

    With KUAP enabled the kernel uses storage key 3 for all its
    translations. But as shown by the debug print, in this specific case we
    have the hash page table entry created with key value 0.
    
      Found HPTE: v = 0x40070adbb6fffc05 r = 0x1ffffffffff1194
    
    and DSISR indicates a key fault.
    
    This can happen due to parallel fault on the same EA by different CPUs:
    
      CPU 0                                 CPU 1
      fault on X
    
      H_PAGE_BUSY set
                                            fault on X
    
      finish fault handling and
      clear H_PAGE_BUSY
                                            check for H_PAGE_BUSY
                                            continue with fault handling.
    
    This implies CPU1 will end up calling hpte_updatepp for address X and
    the kernel updated the hash pte entry with key 0

    video: hyperv_fb: Fix a double free in hvfb_probe
    
    [ Upstream commit 37df9f3fedb6aeaff5564145e8162aab912c9284 ]
    
    Function hvfb_probe() calls hvfb_getmem(), expecting upon return that
    info->apertures is either NULL or points to memory that should be freed
    by framebuffer_release().  But hvfb_getmem() is freeing the memory and
    leaving the pointer non-NULL, resulting in a double free if an error
    occurs or later if hvfb_remove() is called.
    
    Fix this by removing all kfree(info->apertures) calls in hvfb_getmem().
    This will allow framebuffer_release() to free the memory, which follows
    the pattern of other fbdev drivers.

    powerpc/pseries/mobility: handle premature return from H_JOIN
    
    [ Upstream commit 274cb1ca2e7ce02cab56f5f4c61a74aeb566f931 ]
    
    The pseries join/suspend sequence in its current form was written with
    the assumption that it was the only user of H_PROD and that it needn't
    handle spurious successful returns from H_JOIN. That's wrong;
    powerpc's paravirt spinlock code uses H_PROD, and CPUs entering
    do_join() can be woken prematurely from H_JOIN with a status of
    H_SUCCESS as a result. This causes all CPUs to exit the sequence
    early, preventing suspend from occurring at all.
    
    Add a 'done' boolean flag to the pseries_suspend_info struct, and have
    the waking thread set it before waking the other threads. Threads
    which receive H_SUCCESS from H_JOIN retry if the 'done' flag is still
    unset.

    vfio/nvlink: Add missing SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU depends
    
    commit e0146a108ce4d2c22b9510fd12268e3ee72a0161 upstream.
    
    Compiling the nvlink stuff relies on the SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU otherwise there
    are compile errors:
    
     drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_nvlink2.c:101:10: error: implicit declaration of function 'mm_iommu_put' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
                                ret = mm_iommu_put(data->mm, data->mem);
    
    As PPC only defines these functions when the config is set.
    
    Previously this wasn't a problem by chance as SPAPR_TCE_IOMMU was the only
    IOMMU that could have satisfied IOMMU_API on POWERNV.

    drm/tegra: sor: Grab runtime PM reference across reset
    
    commit ac097aecfef0bb289ca53d2fe0b73fc7e1612a05 upstream.
    
    The SOR resets are exclusively shared with the SOR power domain. This
    means that exclusive access can only be granted temporarily and in order
    for that to work, a rigorous sequence must be observed. To ensure that a
    single consumer gets exclusive access to a reset, each consumer must
    implement a rigorous protocol using the reset_control_acquire() and
    reset_control_release() functions.
    
    However, these functions alone don't provide any guarantees at the
    system level. Drivers need to ensure that the only a single consumer has
    access to the reset at the same time. In order for the SOR to be able to
    exclusively access its reset, it must therefore ensure that the SOR
    power domain is not powered off by holding on to a runtime PM reference
    to that power domain across the reset assert/deassert operation.
    
    This used to work fine by accident, but was revealed when recently more
    devices started to rely on the SOR power domain.

    drm/tegra: dc: Restore coupling of display controllers
    
    commit a31500fe7055451ed9043c8fff938dfa6f70ee37 upstream.
    
    Coupling of display controllers used to rely on runtime PM to take the
    companion controller out of reset. Commit fd67e9c6ed5a ("drm/tegra: Do
    not implement runtime PM") accidentally broke this when runtime PM was
    removed.
    
    Restore this functionality by reusing the hierarchical host1x client
    suspend/resume infrastructure that's similar to runtime PM and which
    perfectly fits this use-case.

    reiserfs: update reiserfs_xattrs_initialized() condition
    
    commit 5e46d1b78a03d52306f21f77a4e4a144b6d31486 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference at reiserfs_security_init()
    [1], for commit ab17c4f02156c4f7 ("reiserfs: fixup xattr_root caching")
    is assuming that REISERFS_SB(s)->xattr_root != NULL in
    reiserfs_xattr_jcreate_nblocks() despite that commit made
    REISERFS_SB(sb)->priv_root != NULL && REISERFS_SB(s)->xattr_root == NULL
    case possible.
    
    I guess that commit 6cb4aff0a77cc0e6 ("reiserfs: fix oops while creating
    privroot with selinux enabled") wanted to check xattr_root != NULL
    before reiserfs_xattr_jcreate_nblocks(), for the changelog is talking
    about the xattr root.
    
      The issue is that while creating the privroot during mount
      reiserfs_security_init calls reiserfs_xattr_jcreate_nblocks which
      dereferences the xattr root. The xattr root doesn't exist, so we get
      an oops.
    
    Therefore, update reiserfs_xattrs_initialized() to check both the
    privroot and the xattr root.

    drm/amdkfd: dqm fence memory corruption
    
    commit e92049ae4548ba09e53eaa9c8f6964b07ea274c9 upstream.
    
    Amdgpu driver uses 4-byte data type as DQM fence memory,
    and transmits GPU address of fence memory to microcode
    through query status PM4 message. However, query status
    PM4 message definition and microcode processing are all
    processed according to 8 bytes. Fence memory only allocates
    4 bytes of memory, but microcode does write 8 bytes of memory,
    so there is a memory corruption.
    
    Changes since v1:
      * Change dqm->fence_addr as a u64 pointer to fix this issue,
    also fix up query_status and amdkfd_fence_wait_timeout function
    uses 64 bit fence value to make them consistent.

    mm: fix race by making init_zero_pfn() early_initcall
    
    commit e720e7d0e983bf05de80b231bccc39f1487f0f16 upstream.
    
    There are code paths that rely on zero_pfn to be fully initialized
    before core_initcall.  For example, wq_sysfs_init() is a core_initcall
    function that eventually results in a call to kernel_execve, which
    causes a page fault with a subsequent mmput.  If zero_pfn is not
    initialized by then it may not get cleaned up properly and result in an
    error:
    
      BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:(ptrval) type:MM_ANONPAGES val:1
    
    Here is an analysis of the race as seen on a MIPS device. On this
    particular MT7621 device (Ubiquiti ER-X), zero_pfn is PFN 0 until
    initialized, at which point it becomes PFN 5120:
    
      1. wq_sysfs_init calls into kobject_uevent_env at core_initcall:
           kobject_uevent_env+0x7e4/0x7ec
           kset_register+0x68/0x88
           bus_register+0xdc/0x34c
           subsys_virtual_register+0x34/0x78
           wq_sysfs_init+0x1c/0x4c
           do_one_initcall+0x50/0x1a8
           kernel_init_freeable+0x230/0x2c8
           kernel_init+0x10/0x100
           ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1c
    
      2. kobject_uevent_env() calls call_usermodehelper_exec() which executes
         kernel_execve asynchronously.
    
      3. Memory allocations in kernel_execve cause a page fault, bumping the
         MM reference counter:
           add_mm_counter_fast+0xb4/0xc0
           handle_mm_fault+0x6e4/0xea0
           __get_user_pages.part.78+0x190/0x37c
           __get_user_pages_remote+0x128/0x360
           get_arg_page+0x34/0xa0
           copy_string_kernel+0x194/0x2a4
           kernel_execve+0x11c/0x298
           call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0x114/0x194
    
      4. In case zero_pfn has not been initialized yet, zap_pte_range does
         not decrement the MM_ANONPAGES RSS counter and the BUG message is
         triggered shortly afterwards when __mmdrop checks the ref counters:
           __mmdrop+0x98/0x1d0
           free_bprm+0x44/0x118
           kernel_execve+0x160/0x1d8
           call_usermodehelper_exec_async+0x114/0x194
           ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1c
    
    To avoid races such as described above, initialize init_zero_pfn at
    early_initcall level.  Depending on the architecture, ZERO_PAGE is
    either constant or gets initialized even earlier, at paging_init, so
    there is no issue with initializing zero_pfn earlier.

    s390/vdso: fix tod_steering_delta type
    
    commit b24bacd67ffddd9192c4745500fd6f73dbfe565e upstream.
    
    The s390 specific vdso function __arch_get_hw_counter() is supposed to
    consider tod clock steering.
    
    If a tod clock steering event happens and the tod clock is set to a
    new value __arch_get_hw_counter() will not return the real tod clock
    value but slowly drift it from the old delta until the returned value
    finally matches the real tod clock value again.
    
    Unfortunately the type of tod_steering_delta unsigned while it is
    supposed to be signed. It depends on if tod_steering_delta is negative
    or positive in which direction the vdso code drifts the clock value.
    
    Worst case is now that instead of drifting the clock slowly it will
    jump into the opposite direction by a factor of two.
    
    Fix this by simply making tod_steering_delta signed.

    When converting the vdso assembler code to C it was forgotten to

    tracing: Fix stack trace event size
    
    commit 9deb193af69d3fd6dd8e47f292b67c805a787010 upstream.
    
    Commit cbc3b92ce037 fixed an issue to modify the macros of the stack trace
    event so that user space could parse it properly. Originally the stack
    trace format to user space showed that the called stack was a dynamic
    array. But it is not actually a dynamic array, in the way that other
    dynamic event arrays worked, and this broke user space parsing for it. The
    update was to make the array look to have 8 entries in it. Helper
    functions were added to make it parse it correctly, as the stack was
    dynamic, but was determined by the size of the event stored.
    
    Although this fixed user space on how it read the event, it changed the
    internal structure used for the stack trace event. It changed the array
    size from [0] to [8] (added 8 entries). This increased the size of the
    stack trace event by 8 words. The size reserved on the ring buffer was the
    size of the stack trace event plus the number of stack entries found in
    the stack trace. That commit caused the amount to be 8 more than what was
    needed because it did not expect the caller field to have any size. This
    produced 8 entries of garbage (and reading random data) from the stack
    trace event:
    
              <idle>-0       [002] d... 1976396.837549: <stack trace>
     => trace_event_raw_event_sched_switch
     => __traceiter_sched_switch
     => __schedule
     => schedule_idle
     => do_idle
     => cpu_startup_entry
     => secondary_startup_64_no_verify
     => 0xc8c5e150ffff93de
     => 0xffff93de
     => 0
     => 0
     => 0xc8c5e17800000000
     => 0x1f30affff93de
     => 0x00000004
     => 0x200000000
    
    Instead, subtract the size of the caller field from the size of the event
    to make sure that only the amount needed to store the stack trace is
    reserved.

    PM: runtime: Fix race getting/putting suppliers at probe
    
    commit 9dfacc54a8661bc8be6e08cffee59596ec59f263 upstream.
    
    pm_runtime_put_suppliers() must not decrement rpm_active unless the
    consumer is suspended. That is because, otherwise, it could suspend
    suppliers for an active consumer.
    
    That can happen as follows:
    
     static int driver_probe_device(struct device_driver *drv, struct device *dev)
     {
            int ret = 0;
    
            if (!device_is_registered(dev))
                    return -ENODEV;
    
            dev->can_match = true;
            pr_debug("bus: '%s': %s: matched device %s with driver %s\n",
                     drv->bus->name, __func__, dev_name(dev), drv->name);
    
            pm_runtime_get_suppliers(dev);
            if (dev->parent)
                    pm_runtime_get_sync(dev->parent);
    
     At this point, dev can runtime suspend so rpm_put_suppliers() can run,
     rpm_active becomes 1 (the lowest value).
    
            pm_runtime_barrier(dev);
            if (initcall_debug)
                    ret = really_probe_debug(dev, drv);
            else
                    ret = really_probe(dev, drv);
    
     Probe callback can have runtime resumed dev, and then runtime put
     so dev is awaiting autosuspend, but rpm_active is 2.
    
            pm_request_idle(dev);
    
            if (dev->parent)
                    pm_runtime_put(dev->parent);
    
            pm_runtime_put_suppliers(dev);
    
     Now pm_runtime_put_suppliers() will put the supplier
     i.e. rpm_active 2 -> 1, but consumer can still be active.
    
            return ret;
     }
    
    Fix by checking the runtime status. For any status other than
    RPM_SUSPENDED, rpm_active can be considered to be "owned" by
    rpm_[get/put]_suppliers() and pm_runtime_put_suppliers() need do nothing.

    KVM: SVM: ensure that EFER.SVME is set when running nested guest or on nested vmexit
    
    commit 3c346c0c60ab06a021d1c0884a0ef494bc4ee3a7 upstream.
    
    Fixing nested_vmcb_check_save to avoid all TOC/TOU races
    is a bit harder in released kernels, so do the bare minimum
    by avoiding that EFER.SVME is cleared.  This is problematic
    because svm_set_efer frees the data structures for nested
    virtualization if EFER.SVME is cleared.
    
    Also check that EFER.SVME remains set after a nested vmexit;
    clearing it could happen if the bit is zero in the save area
    that is passed to KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE (the save area of the
    nested state corresponds to the nested hypervisor's state
    and is restored on the next nested vmexit).

    commit a58d9166a756a0f4a6618e4f593232593d6df134 upstream.
    
    Avoid races between check and use of the nested VMCB controls.  This
    for example ensures that the VMRUN intercept is always reflected to the
    nested hypervisor, instead of being processed by the host.  Without this
    patch, it is possible to end up with svm->nested.hsave pointing to

    xtensa: move coprocessor_flush to the .text section
    
    commit ab5eb336411f18fd449a1fb37d36a55ec422603f upstream.
    
    coprocessor_flush is not a part of fast exception handlers, but it uses
    parts of fast coprocessor handling code that's why it's in the same
    source file. It uses call0 opcode to invoke those parts so there are no
    limitations on their relative location, but the rest of the code calls
    coprocessor_flush with call8 and that doesn't work when vectors are
    placed in a different gigabyte-aligned area than the rest of the kernel.
    
    Move coprocessor_flush from the .exception.text section to the .text so
    that it's reachable from the rest of the kernel with call8.

    commit 7b9acbb6aad4f54623dcd4bd4b1a60fe0c727b09 upstream.
    
    If a uaccess (e.g. get_user()) triggers a fault and there's a
    fault signal pending, the handler will return to the uaccess without
    having performed a uaccess fault fixup, and so the CPU will immediately
    execute the uaccess instruction again, whereupon it will livelock
    bouncing between that instruction and the fault handler.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: call alc_update_headset_mode() in hp_automute_hook
    
    commit e54f30befa7990b897189b44a56c1138c6bfdbb5 upstream.
    
    We found the alc_update_headset_mode() is not called on some machines
    when unplugging the headset, as a result, the mode of the
    ALC_HEADSET_MODE_UNPLUGGED can't be set, then the current_headset_type
    is not cleared, if users plug a differnt type of headset next time,
    the determine_headset_type() will not be called and the audio jack is
    set to the headset type of previous time.
    
    On the Dell machines which connect the dmic to the PCH, if we open
    the gnome-sound-setting and unplug the headset, this issue will
    happen. Those machines disable the auto-mute by ucm and has no
    internal mic in the input source, so the update_headset_mode() will
    not be called by cap_sync_hook or automute_hook when unplugging, and
    because the gnome-sound-setting is opened, the codec will not enter
    the runtime_suspend state, so the update_headset_mode() will not be
    called by alc_resume when unplugging. In this case the
    hp_automute_hook is called when unplugging, so add
    update_headset_mode() calling to this function.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: fix a determine_headset_type issue for a Dell AIO
    
    commit febf22565549ea7111e7d45e8f2d64373cc66b11 upstream.
    
    We found a recording issue on a Dell AIO, users plug a headset-mic and
    select headset-mic from UI, but can't record any sound from
    headset-mic. The root cause is the determine_headset_type() returns a
    wrong type, e.g. users plug a ctia type headset, but that function
    returns omtp type.
    
    On this machine, the internal mic is not connected to the codec, the
    "Input Source" is headset mic by default. And when users plug a
    headset, the determine_headset_type() will be called immediately, the
    codec on this AIO is alc274, the delay time for this codec in the
    determine_headset_type() is only 80ms, the delay is too short to
    correctly determine the headset type, the fail rate is nearly 99% when
    users plug the headset with the normal speed.
    
    Other codecs set several hundred ms delay time, so here I change the
    delay time to 850ms for alc2x4 series, after this change, the fail
    rate is zero unless users plug the headset slowly on purpose.

    ACPI: scan: Fix _STA getting called on devices with unmet dependencies
    
    commit 3e759425cc3cf9a43392309819d34c65a3644c59 upstream.
    
    Commit 71da201f38df ("ACPI: scan: Defer enumeration of devices with
    _DEP lists") dropped the following 2 lines from acpi_init_device_object():
    
            /* Assume there are unmet deps until acpi_device_dep_initialize() runs */
            device->dep_unmet = 1;
    
    Leaving the initial value of dep_unmet at the 0 from the kzalloc(). This
    causes the acpi_bus_get_status() call in acpi_add_single_object() to
    actually call _STA, even though there maybe unmet deps, leading to errors
    like these:
    
    [    0.123579] ACPI Error: No handler for Region [ECRM] (00000000ba9edc4c)
                   [GenericSerialBus] (20170831/evregion-166)
    [    0.123601] ACPI Error: Region GenericSerialBus (ID=9) has no handler
                   (20170831/exfldio-299)

                   \_SB.I2C1.BAT1._STA, AE_NOT_EXIST (20170831/psparse-550)
    
    Fix this by re-adding the dep_unmet = 1 initialization to
    acpi_init_device_object() and modifying acpi_bus_check_add() to make sure
    that dep_unmet always gets setup there, overriding the initial 1 value.
    
    This re-fixes the issue initially fixed by
    commit 63347db0affa ("ACPI / scan: Use acpi_bus_get_status() to initialize
    ACPI_TYPE_DEVICE devs"), which introduced the removed
    "device->dep_unmet = 1;" statement.
    
    This issue was noticed; and the fix tested on a Dell Venue 10 Pro 5055.

    In fact, the above mentioned commit only revealed the problem and did
    not introduce it. On x86, to wakeup CPU an NMI is being used and
    hlt_play_dead()/mwait_play_dead() loops are prepared to handle it:
    
            /*
             * If NMI wants to wake up CPU0, start CPU0.
             */
            if (wakeup_cpu0())
                    start_cpu0();
    
    cpuidle_play_dead() -> acpi_idle_play_dead() (which is now being called on
    systems where it wasn't called before the above mentioned commit) serves
    the same purpose but it doesn't have a path for CPU0. What happens now on
    wakeup is:
     - NMI is sent to CPU0
     - wakeup_cpu0_nmi() works as expected
     - we get back to while (1) loop in acpi_idle_play_dead()
     - safe_halt() puts CPU0 to sleep again.
    
    The straightforward/minimal fix is add the special handling for CPU0 on x86
    and that's what the patch is doing.

    ACPI: tables: x86: Reserve memory occupied by ACPI tables
    
    commit 1a1c130ab7575498eed5bcf7220037ae09cd1f8a upstream.
    
    The following problem has been reported by George Kennedy:
    
     Since commit 7fef431be9c9 ("mm/page_alloc: place pages to tail
     in __free_pages_core()") the following use after free occurs
     intermittently when ACPI tables are accessed.
    
     BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in ibft_init+0x134/0xc49
     Read of size 4 at addr ffff8880be453004 by task swapper/0/1

     ACPI tables mapped via kmap() do not have their mapped pages
     reserved and the pages can be "stolen" by the buddy allocator.
    
    Apparently, on the affected system, the ACPI table in question is
    not located in "reserved" memory, like ACPI NVS or ACPI Data, that
    will not be used by the buddy allocator, so the memory occupied by
    that table has to be explicitly reserved to prevent the buddy
    allocator from using it.
    
    In order to address this problem, rearrange the initialization of the
    ACPI tables on x86 to locate the initial tables earlier and reserve
    the memory occupied by them.
    
    The other architectures using ACPI should not be affected by this
    change.

    bpf: Remove MTU check in __bpf_skb_max_len
    
    commit 6306c1189e77a513bf02720450bb43bd4ba5d8ae upstream.
    
    Multiple BPF-helpers that can manipulate/increase the size of the SKB uses
    __bpf_skb_max_len() as the max-length. This function limit size against
    the current net_device MTU (skb->dev->mtu).
    
    When a BPF-prog grow the packet size, then it should not be limited to the
    MTU. The MTU is a transmit limitation, and software receiving this packet
    should be allowed to increase the size. Further more, current MTU check in
    __bpf_skb_max_len uses the MTU from ingress/current net_device, which in
    case of redirects uses the wrong net_device.
    
    This patch keeps a sanity max limit of SKB_MAX_ALLOC (16KiB). The real limit
    is elsewhere in the system. Jesper's testing[1] showed it was not possible
    to exceed 8KiB when expanding the SKB size via BPF-helper. The limiting
    factor is the define KMALLOC_MAX_CACHE_SIZE which is 8192 for
    SLUB-allocator (CONFIG_SLUB) in-case PAGE_SIZE is 4096. This define is
    in-effect due to this being called from softirq context see code
    __gfp_pfmemalloc_flags() and __do_kmalloc_node(). Jakub's testing showed
    that frames above 16KiB can cause NICs to reset (but not crash). Keep this
    sanity limit at this level as memory layer can differ based on kernel
    config.

    net: 9p: advance iov on empty read
    
    [ Upstream commit d65614a01d24704b016635abf5cc028a54e45a62 ]
    
    I met below warning when cating a small size(about 80bytes) txt file
    on 9pfs(msize=2097152 is passed to 9p mount option), the reason is we
    miss iov_iter_advance() if the read count is 0 for zerocopy case, so
    we didn't truncate the pipe, then iov_iter_pipe() thinks the pipe is
    full. Fix it by removing the exception for 0 to ensure to call
    iov_iter_advance() even on empty read for zerocopy case.

    [ Upstream commit 62e69bc419772638369eff8ff81340bde8aceb61 ]
    
    lmc set sc->lmc_media pointer when there is a matching device.
    However, when no matching device is found, this pointer is NULL
    and the following dereference will result in a null-ptr-deref.
    
    To fix this issue, unregister the hdlc device and return an error.

    net: ipa: fix register write command validation
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d65ed76924bc772d3974b0894d870b1aa63b34a ]
    
    In ipa_cmd_register_write_valid() we verify that values we will
    supply to a REGISTER_WRITE IPA immediate command will fit in
    the fields that need to hold them.  This patch fixes some issues
    in that function and ipa_cmd_register_write_offset_valid().
    
    The dev_err() call in ipa_cmd_register_write_offset_valid() has
    some printf format errors:
      - The name of the register (corresponding to the string format
        specifier) was not supplied.
      - The IPA base offset and offset need to be supplied separately to
        match the other format specifiers.
    Also make the ~0 constant used there to compute the maximum
    supported offset value explicitly unsigned.
    
    There are two other issues in ipa_cmd_register_write_valid():
      - There's no need to check the hash flush register for platforms
        (like IPA v4.2) that do not support hashed tables
      - The highest possible endpoint number, whose status register
        offset is computed, is COUNT - 1, not COUNT.
    
    Fix these problems, and add some additional commentary.

    [ Upstream commit 571b1e7e58ad30b3a842254aea50d2e83b2396e1 ]
    
    This patch actually fixes a bug, though it doesn't affect the two
    platforms supported currently.  The fix implements GSI memory
    pointers a bit differently.
    
    For IPA version 4.5 and above, the address space for almost all GSI
    registers is adjusted downward by a fixed amount.  This is currently
    handled by adjusting the I/O virtual address pointer after it has
    been mapped.  The bug is that the pointer is not "de-adjusted" as it
    should be when it's unmapped.
    
    This patch fixes that error, but it does so by maintaining one "raw"
    pointer for the mapped memory range.  This is assigned when the
    memory is mapped and used to unmap the memory.  This pointer is also
    used to access the two registers that do *not* sit in the "adjusted"
    memory space.
    
    Rather than adjusting *that* pointer, we maintain a separate pointer
    that's an adjusted copy of the "raw" pointer, and that is used for
    most GSI register accesses.

    net: ipa: remove two unused register definitions
    
    [ Upstream commit d5bc5015eb9d64cbd14e467db1a56db1472d0d6c ]
    
    We do not support inter-EE channel or event ring commands.  Inter-EE
    interrupts are disabled (and never re-enabled) for all channels and
    event rings, so we have no need for the GSI registers that clear
    those interrupt conditions.  So remove their definitions.

    appletalk: Fix skb allocation size in loopback case
    
    [ Upstream commit 39935dccb21c60f9bbf1bb72d22ab6fd14ae7705 ]
    
    If a DDP broadcast packet is sent out to a non-gateway target, it is
    also looped back. There is a potential for the loopback device to have a
    longer hardware header length than the original target route's device,
    which can result in the skb not being created with enough room for the
    loopback device's hardware header. This patch fixes the issue by
    determining that a loopback will be necessary prior to allocating the
    skb, and if so, ensuring the skb has enough room.
    
    This was discovered while testing a new driver that creates a LocalTalk
    network interface (LTALK_HLEN = 1). It caused an skb_under_panic.

    net: ethernet: aquantia: Handle error cleanup of start on open
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a28af7a3e85ddf358f8c41e401a33002f7a9587 ]
    
    The aq_nic_start function can fail in a variety of cases which leaves
    the device in broken state.
    
    An example case where the start function fails is the
    request_threaded_irq which can be interrupted, resulting in a EINTR
    result. This can be manually triggered by bringing the link up (e.g. ip
    link set up) and triggering a SIGINT on the initiating process (e.g.
    Ctrl+C). This would put the device into a half configured state.
    Subsequently bringing the link up again would cause the napi_enable to
    BUG.
    
    In order to correctly clean up the failed attempt to start a device call
    aq_nic_stop.

    ath10k: hold RCU lock when calling ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr()
    
    [ Upstream commit 09078368d516918666a0122f2533dc73676d3d7e ]
    
    ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() must be called under the RCU lock and
    the resulting pointer is only valid under RCU lock as well.
    
    Fix ath10k_wmi_tlv_op_pull_peer_stats_info() to hold RCU lock before it
    calls ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() and release it when the resulting
    pointer is no longer needed.
    
    This problem was found while reviewing code to debug RCU warn from
    ath10k_wmi_tlv_parse_peer_stats_info().

    [ Upstream commit 874020f8adce535cd318af1768ffe744251b6593 ]
    
    The only thing we do touching the device in hard interrupt context
    is, at most, writing an interrupt ACK register, which isn't racing
    in with anything protected by the reg_lock.
    
    Thus, avoid disabling interrupts here for potentially long periods
    of time, particularly long periods have been observed with dumping
    of firmware memory (leading to lockup warnings on some devices.)

    brcmfmac: clear EAP/association status bits on linkdown events
    
    [ Upstream commit e862a3e4088070de352fdafe9bd9e3ae0a95a33c ]
    
    This ensure that previous association attempts do not leave stale statuses
    on subsequent attempts.
    
    This fixes the WARN_ON(!cr->bss)) from __cfg80211_connect_result() when
    connecting to an AP after a previous connection failure (e.g. where EAP fails
    due to incorrect psk but association succeeded). In some scenarios, indeed,
    brcmf_is_linkup() was reporting a link up event too early due to stale
    BRCMF_VIF_STATUS_ASSOC_SUCCESS bit, thus reporting to cfg80211 a connection
    result with a zeroed bssid (vif->profile.bssid is still empty), causing the
    WARN_ON due to the call to cfg80211_get_bss() with the empty bssid.

    net: introduce CAN specific pointer in the struct net_device
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e096a18867a5a989b510f6999d9c6b6622e8f7b ]
    
    Since 20dd3850bcf8 ("can: Speed up CAN frame receiption by using
    ml_priv") the CAN framework uses per device specific data in the AF_CAN
    protocol. For this purpose the struct net_device->ml_priv is used. Later
    the ml_priv usage in CAN was extended for other users, one of them being
    CAN_J1939.
    
    Later in the kernel ml_priv was converted to an union, used by other
    drivers. E.g. the tun driver started storing it's stats pointer.
    
    Since tun devices can claim to be a CAN device, CAN specific protocols
    will wrongly interpret this pointer, which will cause system crashes.
    Mostly this issue is visible in the CAN_J1939 stack.
    
    To fix this issue, we request a dedicated CAN pointer within the
    net_device struct.

    [ Upstream commit d8b59efa64060d17b7b61f97d891de2d9f2bd9f0 ]
    
    The mptcp subflow route_req() callback performs the subflow
    req initialization after the route_req() check. If the latter
    fails, mptcp-specific bits of the current request sockets
    are left uninitialized.
    
    The above causes bad things at req socket disposal time, when
    the mptcp resources are cleared.
    
    This change addresses the issue by splitting subflow_init_req()
    into the actual initialization and the mptcp-specific checks.
    The initialization is moved before any possibly failing check.

    io_uring: call req_set_fail_links() on short send[msg]()/recv[msg]() with MSG_WAITALL
    
    [ Upstream commit 0031275d119efe16711cd93519b595e6f9b4b330 ]
    
    Without that it's not safe to use them in a linked combination with
    others.
    
    Now combinations like IORING_OP_SENDMSG followed by IORING_OP_SPLICE
    should be possible.
    
    We already handle short reads and writes for the following opcodes:
    
    - IORING_OP_READV
    - IORING_OP_READ_FIXED
    - IORING_OP_READ
    - IORING_OP_WRITEV
    - IORING_OP_WRITE_FIXED
    - IORING_OP_WRITE
    - IORING_OP_SPLICE
    - IORING_OP_TEE
    
    Now we have it for these as well:
    
    - IORING_OP_SENDMSG
    - IORING_OP_SEND
    - IORING_OP_RECVMSG
    - IORING_OP_RECV
    
    For IORING_OP_RECVMSG we also check for the MSG_TRUNC and MSG_CTRUNC
    flags in order to call req_set_fail_links().
    
    There might be applications arround depending on the behavior
    that even short send[msg]()/recv[msg]() retuns continue an
    IOSQE_IO_LINK chain.
    
    It's very unlikely that such applications pass in MSG_WAITALL,
    which is only defined in 'man 2 recvmsg', but not in 'man 2 sendmsg'.
    
    It's expected that the low level sock_sendmsg() call just ignores
    MSG_WAITALL, as MSG_ZEROCOPY is also ignored without explicitly set
    SO_ZEROCOPY.
    
    We also expect the caller to know about the implicit truncation to
    MAX_RW_COUNT, which we don't detect.

    ext4: do not iput inode under running transaction in ext4_rename()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dccdc5a1916d4266edd251f20bbbb113a5c495f ]
    
    In ext4_rename(), when RENAME_WHITEOUT failed to add new entry into

    running transaction. After commit <9b88f9fb0d2> ("ext4: Do not iput inode
    under running transaction"), we follow the assumptions that evict() does
    not get called from a transaction context but in ext4_rename() it breaks
    this suggestion. Although it's not a real problem, better to obey it, so
    this patch add inode to orphan list and stop transaction before final
    iput().

    static_call: Align static_call_is_init() patching condition
    
    [ Upstream commit 698bacefe993ad2922c9d3b1380591ad489355e9 ]
    
    The intent is to avoid writing init code after init (because the text
    might have been freed). The code is needlessly different between
    jump_label and static_call and not obviously correct.
    
    The existing code relies on the fact that the module loader clears the
    init layout, such that within_module_init() always fails, while
    jump_label relies on the module state which is more obvious and
    matches the kernel logic.

    This patch causes a panic when rebooting my Dell Poweredge r440.  I do
    not have the full panic log as it's lost at that stage of the reboot and
    I do not have a serial console.  Reverting this patch makes my system
    able to reboot again.

    locking/ww_mutex: Fix acquire/release imbalance in ww_acquire_init()/ww_acquire_fini()
    
    [ Upstream commit bee645788e07eea63055d261d2884ea45c2ba857 ]
    
    In ww_acquire_init(), mutex_acquire() is gated by CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC.
    The dep_map in the ww_acquire_ctx structure is also gated by the
    same config. However mutex_release() in ww_acquire_fini() is gated by
    CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES. It is possible to set CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES without
    setting CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC though it is an unlikely configuration.
    That may cause a compilation error as dep_map isn't defined in this
    case. Fix this potential problem by enclosing mutex_release() inside
    CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC.

    locking/ww_mutex: Simplify use_ww_ctx & ww_ctx handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 5de2055d31ea88fd9ae9709ac95c372a505a60fa ]
    
    The use_ww_ctx flag is passed to mutex_optimistic_spin(), but the
    function doesn't use it. The frequent use of the (use_ww_ctx && ww_ctx)
    combination is repetitive.
    
    In fact, ww_ctx should not be used at all if !use_ww_ctx.  Simplify
    ww_mutex code by dropping use_ww_ctx from mutex_optimistic_spin() an
    clear ww_ctx if !use_ww_ctx. In this way, we can replace (use_ww_ctx &&
    ww_ctx) by just (ww_ctx).

    thermal/core: Add NULL pointer check before using cooling device stats
    
    [ Upstream commit 2046a24ae121cd107929655a6aaf3b8c5beea01f ]
    
    There is a possible chance that some cooling device stats buffer
    allocation fails due to very high cooling device max state value.
    Later cooling device update sysfs can try to access stats data
    for the same cooling device. It will lead to NULL pointer
    dereference issue.
    
    Add a NULL pointer check before accessing thermal cooling device
    stats data. It fixes the following bug

    We do some IO operations in the snd_soc_component_set_jack callback
    function and snd_soc_component_set_jack() will be called when soc
    component is removed. However, we should not access SoundWire registers
    when the bus is suspended.
    So set regcache_cache_only(regmap, true) to avoid accessing in the

    io_sq_thread_finish() is called in io_ring_ctx_free(), so SQPOLL task is
    potentially running submitting new requests. It's not a disaster because
    of using a "try" variant of percpu_ref_get, but is far from nice.
    
    Remove ctx from the sqd ctx list earlier, before cancellation loop, so
    SQPOLL can't find it and so won't submit new requests.

        vhost_reset_is_le(vq);
        vhost_disable_cross_endian(vq);
    
    And so user_be is used before being set.
    
    To fix that, reverse the lines order as there is no other dependency
    between them.

    ASoC: soc-core: Prevent warning if no DMI table is present
    
    [ Upstream commit 7de14d581dbed57c2b3c6afffa2c3fdc6955a3cd ]
    
    Many systems do not use ACPI and hence do not provide a DMI table. On
    non-ACPI systems a warning, such as the following, is printed on boot.
    
     WARNING KERN tegra-audio-graph-card sound: ASoC: no DMI vendor name!
    
    The variable 'dmi_available' is not exported and so currently cannot be
    used by kernel modules without adding an accessor. However, it is
    possible to use the function is_acpi_device_node() to determine if the
    sound card is an ACPI device and hence indicate if we expect a DMI table
    to be present. Therefore, call is_acpi_device_node() to see if we are
    using ACPI and only parse the DMI table if we are booting with ACPI.

    ASoC: sgtl5000: set DAP_AVC_CTRL register to correct default value on probe
    
    [ Upstream commit f86f58e3594fb0ab1993d833d3b9a2496f3c928c ]
    
    According to the SGTL5000 datasheet [1], the DAP_AVC_CTRL register has
    the following bit field definitions:
    
    | BITS  | FIELD       | RW | RESET | DEFINITION                        |
    | 15    | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 14    | RSVD        | RW | 0x1   | Reserved                          |
    | 13:12 | MAX_GAIN    | RW | 0x1   | Max Gain of AVC in expander mode  |
    | 11:10 | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 9:8   | LBI_RESP    | RW | 0x1   | Integrator Response               |
    | 7:6   | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 5     | HARD_LMT_EN | RW | 0x0   | Enable hard limiter mode          |
    | 4:1   | RSVD        | RO | 0x0   | Reserved                          |
    | 0     | EN          | RW | 0x0   | Enable/Disable AVC                |
    
    The original default value written to the DAP_AVC_CTRL register during
    sgtl5000_i2c_probe() was 0x0510.  This would incorrectly write values to
    bits 4 and 10, which are defined as RESERVED.  It would also not set
    bits 12 and 14 to their correct RESET values of 0x1, and instead set
    them to 0x0.  While the DAP_AVC module is effectively disabled because
    the EN bit is 0, this default value is still writing invalid values to
    registers that are marked as read-only and RESERVED as well as not
    setting bits 12 and 14 to their correct default values as defined by the
    datasheet.
    
    The correct value that should be written to the DAP_AVC_CTRL register is
    0x5100, which configures the register bits to the default values defined
    by the datasheet, and prevents any writes to bits defined as
    'read-only'.  Generally speaking, it is best practice to NOT attempt to
    write values to registers/bits defined as RESERVED, as it generally
    produces unwanted/undefined behavior, or errors.
    
    Also, all credit for this patch should go to my colleague Dan MacDonald
    <dmacdonald@curbellmedical.com> for finding this error in the first
    place.

    ASoC: rt5651: Fix dac- and adc- vol-tlv values being off by a factor of 10
    
    [ Upstream commit eee51df776bd6cac10a76b2779a9fdee3f622b2b ]
    
    The adc_vol_tlv volume-control has a range from -17.625 dB to +30 dB,
    not -176.25 dB to + 300 dB. This wrong scale is esp. a problem in userspace
    apps which translate the dB scale to a linear scale. With the logarithmic
    dB scale being of by a factor of 10 we loose all precision in the lower
    area of the range when apps translate things to a linear scale.
    
    E.g. the 0 dB default, which corresponds with a value of 47 of the
    0 - 127 range for the control, would be shown as 0/100 in alsa-mixer.
    
    Since the centi-dB values used in the TLV struct cannot represent the
    0.375 dB step size used by these controls, change the TLV definition
    for them to specify a min and max value instead of min + stepsize.
    
    Note this mirrors commit 3f31f7d9b540 ("ASoC: rt5670: Fix dac- and adc-
    vol-tlv values being off by a factor of 10") which made the exact same

    iomap: Fix negative assignment to unsigned sis->pages in iomap_swapfile_activate
    
    [ Upstream commit 5808fecc572391867fcd929662b29c12e6d08d81 ]
    
    In case if isi.nr_pages is 0, we are making sis->pages (which is
    unsigned int) a huge value in iomap_swapfile_activate() by assigning -1.
    This could cause a kernel crash in kernel v4.18 (with below signature).
    Or could lead to unknown issues on latest kernel if the fake big swap gets
    used.
    
    Fix this issue by returning -EINVAL in case of nr_pages is 0, since it
    is anyway a invalid swapfile. Looks like this issue will be hit when
    we have pagesize < blocksize type of configuration.
    
    I was able to hit the issue in case of a tiny swap file with below
    test script.
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riteshharjani/LinuxStudy/master/scripts/swap-issue.sh
    
    kernel crash analysis on v4.18
    ==============================
    On v4.18 kernel, it causes a kernel panic, since sis->pages becomes
    a huge value and isi.nr_extents is 0. When 0 is returned it is
    considered as a swapfile over NFS and SWP_FILE is set (sis->flags |= SWP_FILE).
    Then when swapoff was getting called it was calling a_ops->swap_deactivate()
    if (sis->flags & SWP_FILE) is true. Since a_ops->swap_deactivate() is
    NULL in case of XFS, it causes below panic.
    
    Panic signature on v4.18 kernel:

    rpc: fix NULL dereference on kmalloc failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ddc942394013f08992fc379ca04cffacbbe3dae ]
    
    I think this is unlikely but possible:
    
    svc_authenticate sets rq_authop and calls svcauth_gss_accept.  The
    kmalloc(sizeof(*svcdata), GFP_KERNEL) fails, leaving rq_auth_data NULL,
    and returning SVC_DENIED.
    
    This causes svc_process_common to go to err_bad_auth, and eventually
    call svc_authorise.  That calls ->release == svcauth_gss_release, which

    fs: nfsd: fix kconfig dependency warning for NFSD_V4
    
    [ Upstream commit 7005227369079963d25fb2d5d736d0feb2c44cf6 ]
    
    When NFSD_V4 is enabled and CRYPTO is disabled,
    Kbuild gives the following warning:
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for CRYPTO_SHA256
      Depends on [n]: CRYPTO [=n]
      Selected by [y]:
      - NFSD_V4 [=y] && NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS [=y] && NFSD [=y] && PROC_FS [=y]
    
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for CRYPTO_MD5
      Depends on [n]: CRYPTO [=n]
      Selected by [y]:
      - NFSD_V4 [=y] && NETWORK_FILESYSTEMS [=y] && NFSD [=y] && PROC_FS [=y]
    
    This is because NFSD_V4 selects CRYPTO_MD5 and CRYPTO_SHA256,
    without depending on or selecting CRYPTO, despite those config options
    being subordinate to CRYPTO.

    ext4: shrink race window in ext4_should_retry_alloc()
    
    [ Upstream commit efc61345274d6c7a46a0570efbc916fcbe3e927b ]
    
    When generic/371 is run on kvm-xfstests using 5.10 and 5.11 kernels, it
    fails at significant rates on the two test scenarios that disable
    delayed allocation (ext3conv and data_journal) and force actual block
    allocation for the fallocate and pwrite functions in the test.  The
    failure rate on 5.10 for both ext3conv and data_journal on one test
    system typically runs about 85%.  On 5.11, the failure rate on ext3conv
    sometimes drops to as low as 1% while the rate on data_journal
    increases to nearly 100%.
    
    The observed failures are largely due to ext4_should_retry_alloc()
    cutting off block allocation retries when s_mb_free_pending (used to
    indicate that a transaction in progress will free blocks) is 0.
    However, free space is usually available when this occurs during runs
    of generic/371.  It appears that a thread attempting to allocate
    blocks is just missing transaction commits in other threads that
    increase the free cluster count and reset s_mb_free_pending while
    the allocating thread isn't running.  Explicitly testing for free space
    availability avoids this race.
    
    The current code uses a post-increment operator in the conditional
    expression that determines whether the retry limit has been exceeded.
    This means that the conditional expression uses the value of the
    retry counter before it's increased, resulting in an extra retry cycle.
    The current code actually retries twice before hitting its retry limit
    rather than once.
    
    Increasing the retry limit to 3 from the current actual maximum retry
    count of 2 in combination with the change described above reduces the
    observed failure rate to less that 0.1% on both ext3conv and
    data_journal with what should be limited impact on users sensitive to
    the overhead caused by retries.
    
    A per filesystem percpu counter exported via sysfs is added to allow
    users or developers to track the number of times the retry limit is
    exceeded without resorting to debugging methods.  This should provide
    some insight into worst case retry behavior.

    virtiofs: Fail dax mount if device does not support it
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f9b9efd82a84f27e95d0414f852caf1fa839e83 ]
    
    Right now "mount -t virtiofs -o dax myfs /mnt/virtiofs" succeeds even
    if filesystem deivce does not have a cache window and hence DAX can't
    be supported.
    
    This gives a false sense to user that they are using DAX with virtiofs
    but fact of the matter is that they are not.
    
    Fix this by returning error if dax can't be supported and user has asked
    for it.

    arm64: mm: correct the inside linear map range during hotplug check
    
    [ Upstream commit ee7febce051945be28ad86d16a15886f878204de ]
    
    Memory hotplug may fail on systems with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE because the
    linear map range is not checked correctly.
    
    The start physical address that linear map covers can be actually at the
    end of the range because of randomization. Check that and if so reduce it
    to 0.
    
    This can be verified on QEMU with setting kaslr-seed to ~0ul:
    
    memstart_offset_seed = 0xffff
    START: __pa(_PAGE_OFFSET(vabits_actual)) = ffff9000c0000000
    END:   __pa(PAGE_END - 1) =  1000bfffffff
