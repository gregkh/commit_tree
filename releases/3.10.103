    spi: spi-xilinx: cleanup a check in xilinx_spi_txrx_bufs()
    
    commit e33d085d11e54bc9fb07b2555cd104d8e7b3089b upstream.
    
    '!' has higher precedence than comparisons so the original condition
    is equivalent to "if (xspi->remaining_bytes == 0)".  This makes the
    static checkers complain.
    
    xspi->remaining_bytes is signed and from looking at the code
    briefly, I think it might be able to go negative.  I suspect that
    going negative may cause a bug, but I don't have the hardware and
    can't test.

    net: rfkill: Do not ignore errors from regulator_enable()
    
    commit dee08ab83d0378d922b67e7cf10bbec3e4ea343b upstream.
    
    Function regulator_enable() may return an error that has to be checked.
    This patch changes function rfkill_regulator_set_block() so that it checks
    for the return code.  Also, rfkill_data->reg_enabled is set to 'true' only
    if there is no error.
    
    This fixes the following compilation warning:

    Signing a module should only make it trusted by the specific kernel it
    was built for, not anything else.  Loading a signed module meant for a
    kernel with a different ABI could have interesting effects.
    Therefore, treat all signatures as invalid when a module is
    force-loaded.

    dm flakey: error READ bios during the down_interval
    
    commit 99f3c90d0d85708e7401a81ce3314e50bf7f2819 upstream.
    
    When the corrupt_bio_byte feature was introduced it caused READ bios to
    no longer be errored with -EIO during the down_interval.  This had to do
    with the complexity of needing to submit READs if the corrupt_bio_byte
    feature was used.
    
    Fix it so READ bios are properly errored with -EIO; doing so early in
    flakey_map() as long as there isn't a match for the corrupt_bio_byte
    feature.

    ubi: Make volume resize power cut aware
    
    commit 4946784bd3924b1374f05eebff2fd68660bae866 upstream.
    
    When the volume resize operation shrinks a volume,
    LEBs will be unmapped. Since unmapping will not erase these
    LEBs immediately we have to wait for that operation to finish.
    Otherwise in case of a power cut right after writing the new
    volume table the UBI attach process can find more LEBs than the
    volume table knows. This will render the UBI image unattachable.
    
    Fix this issue by waiting for erase to complete and write the new
    volume table afterward.

    metag: Fix __cmpxchg_u32 asm constraint for CMP
    
    commit 6154c187b97ee7513046bb4eb317a89f738f13ef upstream.
    
    The LNKGET based atomic sequence in __cmpxchg_u32 has slightly incorrect
    constraints for the return value which under certain circumstances can
    allow an address unit register to be used as the first operand of a CMP
    instruction. This isn't a valid instruction however as the encodings
    only allow a data unit to be specified. This would result in an
    assembler error like the following:
    
      Error: failed to assemble instruction: "CMP A0.2,D0Ar6"
    
    Fix by changing the constraint from "=&da" (assigned, early clobbered,
    data or address unit register) to "=&d" (data unit register only).
    
    The constraint for the second operand, "bd" (an op2 register where op1
    is a data unit register and the instruction supports O2R) is already
    correct assuming the first operand is a data unit register.
    
    Other cases of CMP in inline asm have had their constraints checked, and
    appear to all be fine.

    ftrace/recordmcount: Work around for addition of metag magic but not relocations
    
    commit b2e1c26f0b62531636509fbcb6dab65617ed8331 upstream.
    
    glibc recently did a sync up (94e73c95d9b5 "elf.h: Sync with the gabi

    This triggers build errors:

    scripts/recordmcount.c:466:28: error: 'R_METAG_ADDR32' undeclared (first use in this function)

         rel_type_nop = R_METAG_NONE;
                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Work around this change with some more #ifdefery for the relocations.

    balloon: check the number of available pages in leak balloon
    
    commit 37cf99e08c6fb4dcea0f9ad2b13b6daa8c76a711 upstream.
    
    The balloon has a special mechanism that is subscribed to the oom
    notification which leads to deflation for a fixed number of pages.
    The number is always fixed even when the balloon is fully deflated.
    But leak_balloon did not expect that the pages to deflate will be more
    than taken, and raise a "BUG" in balloon_page_dequeue when page list
    will be empty.
    
    So, the simplest solution would be to check that the number of releases
    pages is less or equal to the number taken pages.

    commit 0e0e36774081534783aa8eeb9f6fbddf98d3c061 upstream.
    
    It seems risky to always rely on the caller to ensure the socket's
    address family is correct before passing it to the NetLabel kAPI,
    especially since we see at least one LSM which didn't. Add address

    commit 8d9535b6efd86e6c07da59f97e68f44efb7fe080 upstream.
    
    When opening a file with O_CREAT flag, check to see if the file opened
    is an existing directory.
    
    This prevents the directory from being opened which subsequently causes
    a crash when the close function for directories cifs_closedir() is called
    which frees up the file->private_data memory while the file is still
    listed on the open file list for the tcon.

    commit 6311f1261f59ce5e51fbe5cc3b5e7737197316ac upstream.
    
    When s5p_mfc_remove() calls put_device() for the reserved memory region

    Device 's5p-mfc-l' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed.
    
    Also, the declared DMA memory using dma_declare_coherent_memory() isn't

    gpio: pca953x: Fix NBANK calculation for PCA9536
    
    commit a246b8198f776a16d1d3a3bbfc2d437bad766b29 upstream.
    
    NBANK() macro assumes that ngpios is a multiple of 8(BANK_SZ) and
    hence results in 0 banks for PCA9536 which has just 4 gpios. This is
    wrong as PCA9356 has 1 bank with 4 gpios. This results in uninitialized
    PCA953X_INVERT register. Fix this by using DIV_ROUND_UP macro in
    NBANK().

    This problem can occur in the following situation:
    
    open()
     - pread()
        - .seq_start()
           - iter = kmalloc() // succeeds
           - seqf->private = iter
        - .seq_stop()
           - kfree(seqf->private)
     - pread()
        - .seq_start()
           - iter = kmalloc() // fails
        - .seq_stop()
           - class_dev_iter_exit(seqf->private) // boom! old pointer
    
    As the comment in disk_seqf_stop() says, stop is called even if start
    failed, so we need to reinitialise the private pointer to NULL when seq
    iteration stops.
    
    An alternative would be to set the private pointer to NULL when the
    kmalloc() in disk_seqf_start() fails.

    scsi_lib: correctly retry failed zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands
    
    commit a621bac3044ed6f7ec5fa0326491b2d4838bfa93 upstream.
    
    When SCSI was written, all commands coming from the filesystem
    (REQ_TYPE_FS commands) had data.  This meant that our signal for needing
    to complete the command was the number of bytes completed being equal to
    the number of bytes in the request.  Unfortunately, with the advent of
    flush barriers, we can now get zero length REQ_TYPE_FS commands, which
    confuse this logic because they satisfy the condition every time.  This
    means they never get retried even for retryable conditions, like UNIT
    ATTENTION because we complete them early assuming they're done.  Fix
    this by special casing the early completion condition to recognise zero
    length commands with errors and let them drop through to the retry code.

    KEYS: 64-bit MIPS needs to use compat_sys_keyctl for 32-bit userspace
    
    commit 20f06ed9f61a185c6dabd662c310bed6189470df upstream.
    
    MIPS64 needs to use compat_sys_keyctl for 32-bit userspace rather than
    calling sys_keyctl.  The latter will work in a lot of cases, thereby hiding
    the issue.

    sctp: Prevent soft lockup when sctp_accept() is called during a timeout event
    
    commit 635682a14427d241bab7bbdeebb48a7d7b91638e upstream.
    
    A case can occur when sctp_accept() is called by the user during
    a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way handshake.  Since
    sctp_assoc_migrate() changes both assoc->base.sk and assoc->ep, the
    bh_sock_lock in sctp_generate_heartbeat_event() will be taken with
    the listening socket but released with the new association socket.
    The result is a deadlock on any future attempts to take the listening
    socket lock.
    
    Note that this race can occur with other SCTP timeouts that take
    the bh_lock_sock() in the event sctp_accept() is called.

    net: mvneta: set real interrupt per packet for tx_done
    
    commit 06708f81528725148473c0869d6af5f809c6824b upstream.
    
    Commit aebea2ba0f74 ("net: mvneta: fix Tx interrupt delay") intended to
    set coalescing threshold to a value guaranteeing interrupt generation
    per each sent packet, so that buffers can be released with no delay.
    
    In fact setting threshold to '1' was wrong, because it causes interrupt
    every two packets. According to the documentation a reason behind it is
    following - interrupt occurs once sent buffers counter reaches a value,
    which is higher than one specified in MVNETA_TXQ_SIZE_REG(q). This
    behavior was confirmed during tests. Also when testing the SoC working
    as a NAS device, better performance was observed with int-per-packet,
    as it strongly depends on the fact that all transmitted packets are
    released immediately.
    
    This commit enables NETA controller work in interrupt per sent packet mode
    by setting coalescing threshold to 0.

    commit 25e1ed6e64f52a692ba3191c4fde650aab3ecc07 upstream.
    
    For 'real' hardware CAN devices the netlink interface is used to set CAN

    At high bus load it could happen that "at91_poll()" enters with all RX

    well, "rx_next" will not be reset to the first RX mailbox and hence the

    It fixed a local root exploit but also introduced a dependency on
    the lower file system implementing an mmap operation just to open a file,
    which is a bit of a heavy hammer.  The right fix is to have mmap depend
    on the existence of the mmap handler instead.

    xen/pciback: Fix conf_space read/write overlap check.
    
    commit 02ef871ecac290919ea0c783d05da7eedeffc10e upstream.
    
    Current overlap check is evaluating to false a case where a filter
    field is fully contained (proper subset) of a r/w request.  This
    change applies classical overlap check instead to include all the
    scenarios.
    
    More specifically, for (Hilscher GmbH CIFX 50E-DP(M/S)) device driver
    the logic is such that the entire confspace is read and written in 4
    byte chunks. In this case as an example, CACHE_LINE_SIZE,
    LATENCY_TIMER and PCI_BIST are arriving together in one call to
    xen_pcibk_config_write() with offset == 0xc and size == 4.  With the
    exsisting overlap check the LATENCY_TIMER field (offset == 0xd, length
    == 1) is fully contained in the write request and hence is excluded
    from write, which is incorrect.

    fs/nilfs2: fix potential underflow in call to crc32_le
    
    commit 63d2f95d63396059200c391ca87161897b99e74a upstream.
    
    The value `bytes' comes from the filesystem which is about to be
    mounted.  We cannot trust that the value is always in the range we
    expect it to be.
    
    Check its value before using it to calculate the length for the crc32_le
    call.  It value must be larger (or equal) sumoff + 4.
    
    This fixes a kernel bug when accidentially mounting an image file which
    had the nilfs2 magic value 0x3434 at the right offset 0x406 by chance.
    The bytes 0x01 0x00 were stored at 0x408 and were interpreted as a
    s_bytes value of 1.  This caused an underflow when substracting sumoff +
    4 (20) in the call to crc32_le.

    xen/acpi: allow xen-acpi-processor driver to load on Xen 4.7
    
    commit 6f2d9d99213514360034c6d52d2c3919290b3504 upstream.
    
    As of Xen 4.7 PV CPUID doesn't expose either of CPUID[1].ECX[7] and
    CPUID[0x80000007].EDX[7] anymore, causing the driver to fail to load on
    both Intel and AMD systems. Doing any kind of hardware capability
    checks in the driver as a prerequisite was wrong anyway: With the
    hypervisor being in charge, all such checking should be done by it. If
    ACPI data gets uploaded despite some missing capability, the hypervisor
    is free to ignore part or all of that data.
    
    Ditch the entire check_prereq() function, and do the only valid check
    (xen_initial_domain()) in the caller in its place.

    Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect long after socket reconnect
    
    commit 4fcd1813e6404dd4420c7d12fb483f9320f0bf93 upstream.
    
    Azure server blocks clients that open a socket and don't do anything on it.
    In our reconnect scenarios, we can reconnect the tcp session and
    detect the socket is available but we defer the negprot and SMB3 session
    setup and tree connect reconnection until the next i/o is requested, but
    this looks suspicous to some servers who expect SMB3 negprog and session
    setup soon after a socket is created.
    
    In the echo thread, reconnect SMB3 sessions and tree connections
    that are disconnected.  A later patch will replay persistent (and
    resilient) handle opens.

    scsi: fix race between simultaneous decrements of ->host_failed
    
    commit 72d8c36ec364c82bf1bf0c64dfa1041cfaf139f7 upstream.
    
    sas_ata_strategy_handler() adds the works of the ata error handler to
    system_unbound_wq. This workqueue asynchronously runs work items, so the
    ata error handler will be performed concurrently on different CPUs. In
    this case, ->host_failed will be decreased simultaneously in
    scsi_eh_finish_cmd() on different CPUs, and become abnormal.
    
    It will lead to permanently inequality between ->host_failed and
    ->host_busy, and scsi error handler thread won't start running. IO
    errors after that won't be handled.
    
    Since all scmds must have been handled in the strategy handler, just
    remove the decrement in scsi_eh_finish_cmd() and zero ->host_busy after
    the strategy handler to fix this race.

    ALSA: ctl: Stop notification after disconnection
    
    commit f388cdcdd160687c6650833f286b9c89c50960ff upstream.
    
    snd_ctl_remove() has a notification for the removal event.  It's
    superfluous when done during the device got disconnected.  Although
    the notification itself is mostly harmless, it may potentially be
    harmful, and should be suppressed.  Actually some components PCM may
    free ctl elements during the disconnect or free callbacks, thus it's
    no theoretical issue.
    
    This patch adds the check of card->shutdown flag for avoiding
    unnecessary notifications after (or during) the disconnect.

    tty/vt/keyboard: fix OOB access in do_compute_shiftstate()
    
    commit 510cccb5b0c8868a2b302a0ab524da7912da648b upstream.
    
    The size of individual keymap in drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c is NR_KEYS,
    which is currently 256, whereas number of keys/buttons in input device (and
    therefor in key_down) is much larger - KEY_CNT - 768, and that can cause
    out-of-bound access when we do
    
            sym = U(key_maps[0][k]);
    
    with large 'k'.
    
    To fix it we should not attempt iterating beyond smaller of NR_KEYS and
    KEY_CNT.
    
    Also while at it let's switch to for_each_set_bit() instead of open-coding
    it.

    iio:ad7266: Fix probe deferral for vref
    
    commit 68b356eb3d9f5e38910fb62e22a78e2a18d544ae upstream.
    
    Currently the ad7266 driver treats any failure to get vref as though the
    regulator were not present but this means that if probe deferral is
    triggered the driver will act as though the regulator were not present.
    Instead only use the internal reference if we explicitly got -ENODEV which
    is what is returned for absent regulators.

    All regulator_get() variants return either a pointer to a regulator or an
    ERR_PTR() so testing for NULL makes no sense and may lead to bugs if we
    use NULL as a valid regulator. Fix this by using IS_ERR() as expected.

    base: make module_create_drivers_dir race-free
    
    commit 7e1b1fc4dabd6ec8e28baa0708866e13fa93c9b3 upstream.
    
    Modules which register drivers via standard path (driver_register) in
    parallel can cause a warning:
    WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3492 at ../fs/sysfs/dir.c:31 sysfs_warn_dup+0x62/0x80

     [<ffffffffa0033011>] hexium_init_module+0x11/0x1000 [hexium_gemini]
    ...
    
    As can be (mostly) seen, driver_register causes this call sequence:
      -> bus_add_driver
        -> module_add_driver
          -> module_create_drivers_dir
    The last one creates "drivers" directory in /sys/module/<...>. When
    this is done in parallel, the directory is attempted to be created
    twice at the same time.
    
    This can be easily reproduced by loading mxb and hexium_gemini in
    parallel:
    while :; do
      modprobe mxb &
      modprobe hexium_gemini
      wait
      rmmod mxb hexium_gemini saa7146_vv saa7146
    done
    
    saa7146 calls pci_register_driver for both mxb and hexium_gemini,
    which means /sys/module/saa7146/drivers is to be created for both of
    them.
    
    Fix this by a new mutex in module_create_drivers_dir which makes the
    test-and-create "drivers" dir atomic.
    
    I inverted the condition and removed 'return' to avoid multiple
    unlocks or a goto.

    tracing: Handle NULL formats in hold_module_trace_bprintk_format()
    
    commit 70c8217acd4383e069fe1898bbad36ea4fcdbdcc upstream.
    
    If a task uses a non constant string for the format parameter in
    trace_printk(), then the trace_printk_fmt variable is set to NULL. This
    variable is then saved in the __trace_printk_fmt section.
    
    The function hold_module_trace_bprintk_format() checks to see if duplicate
    formats are used by modules, and reuses them if so (saves them to the list
    if it is new). But this function calls lookup_format() that does a strcmp()
    to the value (which is now NULL) and can cause a kernel oops.
    
    This wasn't an issue till 3debb0a9ddb ("tracing: Fix trace_printk() to print
    when not using bprintk()") which added "__used" to the trace_printk_fmt
    variable, and before that, the kernel simply optimized it out (no NULL value
    was saved).
    
    The fix is simply to handle the NULL pointer in lookup_format() and have the
    caller ignore the value if it was NULL.

    irq_routes->nr: 1024, gsi_count: 1024.
    
    That's to say when irq_routes->nr == 1024, there are 1024 routing entries,
    but in the kernel code when routes->nr >= 1024, will just return -EINVAL;
    
    The nr is the number of the routing entries which is in of
    [1 ~ KVM_MAX_IRQ_ROUTES], not the index in [0 ~ KVM_MAX_IRQ_ROUTES - 1].

    cdc_ncm: workaround for EM7455 "silent" data interface
    
    commit c086e7096170390594c425114d98172bc9aceb8a upstream.
    
    Several Lenovo users have reported problems with their Sierra
    Wireless EM7455 modem. The driver has loaded successfully and
    the MBIM management channel has appeared to work, including
    establishing a connection to the mobile network. But no frames
    have been received over the data interface.
    
    The problem affects all EM7455 and MC7455, and is assumed to
    affect other modems based on the same Qualcomm chipset and
    baseband firmware.
    
    Testing narrowed the problem down to what seems to be a
    firmware timing bug during initialization. Adding a short sleep
    while probing is sufficient to make the problem disappear.
    Experiments have shown that 1-2 ms is too little to have any
    effect, while 10-20 ms is enough to reliably succeed.

    UBIFS is using PagePrivate() which can have different meanings across
    filesystems. Therefore the generic page migration code cannot handle this
    case correctly.
    We have to implement our own migration function which basically does a
    plain copy but also duplicates the page private flag.
    UBIFS is not a block device filesystem and cannot use buffer_migrate_page().

    NFS: Fix another OPEN_DOWNGRADE bug
    
    commit e547f2628327fec6afd2e03b46f113f614cca05b upstream.
    
    Olga Kornievskaia reports that the following test fails to trigger
    an OPEN_DOWNGRADE on the wire, and only triggers the final CLOSE.
    
            fd0 = open(foo, RDRW)   -- should be open on the wire for "both"
            fd1 = open(foo, RDONLY)  -- should be open on the wire for "read"
            close(fd0) -- should trigger an open_downgrade
            read(fd1)
            close(fd1)
    
    The issue is that we're missing a check for whether or not the current
    state transitioned from an O_RDWR state as opposed to having transitioned
    from a combination of O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY.

    x86/amd_nb: Fix boot crash on non-AMD systems
    
    commit 1ead852dd88779eda12cb09cc894a03d9abfe1ec upstream.
    
    Fix boot crash that triggers if this driver is built into a kernel and
    run on non-AMD systems.
    
    AMD northbridges users call amd_cache_northbridges() and it returns
    a negative value to signal that we weren't able to cache/detect any
    northbridges on the system.
    
    At least, it should do so as all its callers expect it to do so. But it
    does return a negative value only when kmalloc() fails.
    
    Fix it to return -ENODEV if there are no NBs cached as otherwise, amd_nb
    users like amd64_edac, for example, which relies on it to know whether
    it should load or not, gets loaded on systems like Intel Xeons where it
    shouldn't.

    kprobes/x86: Clear TF bit in fault on single-stepping
    
    commit dcfc47248d3f7d28df6f531e6426b933de94370d upstream.
    
    Fix kprobe_fault_handler() to clear the TF (trap flag) bit of
    the flags register in the case of a fault fixup on single-stepping.
    
    If we put a kprobe on the instruction which caused a
    page fault (e.g. actual mov instructions in copy_user_*),
    that fault happens on the single-stepping buffer. In this
    case, kprobes resets running instance so that the CPU can
    retry execution on the original ip address.
    
    However, current code forgets to reset the TF bit. Since this
    fault happens with TF bit set for enabling single-stepping,
    when it retries, it causes a debug exception and kprobes
    can not handle it because it already reset itself.
    
    On the most of x86-64 platform, it can be easily reproduced
    by using kprobe tracer. E.g.
    
      # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
      # echo p copy_user_enhanced_fast_string+5 > kprobe_events
      # echo 1 > events/kprobes/enable
    
    And you'll see a kernel panic on do_debug(), since the debug
    trap is not handled by kprobes.
    
    To fix this problem, we just need to clear the TF bit when
    resetting running kprobe.

    ipoib_neigh_get unconditionally updates the "alive" variable member on
    any packet send.  This prevents the neighbor garbage collection from
    cleaning out a dead neighbor entry if we are still queueing packets
    for it.  If the queue for this neighbor is full, then don't update the
    alive timestamp.  That way the neighbor can time out even if packets
    are still being queued as long as none of them are being sent.

    IB/security: Restrict use of the write() interface
    
    commit e6bd18f57aad1a2d1ef40e646d03ed0f2515c9e3 upstream.
    
    The drivers/infiniband stack uses write() as a replacement for
    bi-directional ioctl().  This is not safe. There are ways to
    trigger write calls that result in the return structure that
    is normally written to user space being shunted off to user
    specified kernel memory instead.
    
    For the immediate repair, detect and deny suspicious accesses to
    the write API.
    
    For long term, update the user space libraries and the kernel API
    to something that doesn't present the same security vulnerabilities
    (likely a structured ioctl() interface).
    
    The impacted uAPI interfaces are generally only available if
    hardware from drivers/infiniband is installed in the system.

    commit 8c5122e45a10a9262f872b53f151a592e870f905 upstream.
    
    When this code was reworked for IBoE support the order of assignments
    for the sl_tclass_flowlabel got flipped around resulting in
    TClass & FlowLabel being permanently set to 0 in the packet headers.
    
    This breaks IB routers that rely on these headers, but only affects

    commit fe7a7c57629e8dcbc0e297363a9b2366d67a6dc5 upstream.
    
    Currently, the mesh paths associated with a nexthop station are cleaned
    up in the following code path:
    
        __sta_info_destroy_part1
        synchronize_net()
        __sta_info_destroy_part2
         -> cleanup_single_sta
           -> mesh_sta_cleanup
             -> mesh_plink_deactivate
               -> mesh_path_flush_by_nexthop
    
    However, there are a couple of problems here:
    
    1) the paths aren't flushed at all if the MPM is running in userspace
       (e.g. when using wpa_supplicant or authsae)
    
    2) there is no synchronize_rcu between removing the path and readers
       accessing the nexthop, which means the following race is possible:
    
    CPU0                            CPU1
    ~~~~                            ~~~~
                                    sta_info_destroy_part1()
                                    synchronize_net()
    rcu_read_lock()
    mesh_nexthop_resolve()
      mpath = mesh_path_lookup()
                                    [...] -> mesh_path_flush_by_nexthop()
      sta = rcu_dereference(
        mpath->next_hop)
                                    kfree(sta)
      access sta <-- CRASH
    
    Fix both of these by unconditionally flushing paths before destroying
    the sta, and by adding a synchronize_net() after path flush to ensure
    no active readers can still dereference the sta.
    
    Fixes this crash:

    net: alx: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue
    
    commit 881d0327db37ad917a367c77aff1afa1ee41e0a9 upstream.
    
    Note: This is a verified backported patch for stable 4.4 kernel, and it
    could also be applied to 4.3/4.2/4.1/3.18/3.16
    
    There is a problem with alx devices, that the network link will be
    lost in 1-5 minutes after the device is up.
    
    >From debugging without datasheet, we found the error always
    happen when the DMA RX address is set to 0x....fc0, which is very
    likely to be a HW/silicon problem.
    
    This patch will apply rx skb with 64 bytes longer space, and if the
    allocated skb has a 0x...fc0 address, it will use skb_resever(skb, 64)
    to advance the address, so that the RX overflow can be avoided.

    sit: correct IP protocol used in ipip6_err
    
    commit d5d8760b78d0cfafe292f965f599988138b06a70 upstream.
    
    Since 32b8a8e59c9c ("sit: add IPv4 over IPv4 support")
    ipip6_err() may be called for packets whose IP protocol is
    IPPROTO_IPIP as well as those whose IP protocol is IPPROTO_IPV6.
    
    In the case of IPPROTO_IPIP packets the correct protocol value is not
    passed to ipv4_update_pmtu() or ipv4_redirect().
    
    This patch resolves this problem by using the IP protocol of the packet
    rather than a hard-coded value. This appears to be consistent
    with the usage of the protocol of a packet by icmp_socket_deliver()
    the caller of ipip6_err().
    
    I was able to exercise the redirect case by using a setup where an ICMP
    redirect was received for the destination of the encapsulated packet.
    However, it appears that although incorrect the protocol field is not used
    in this case and thus no problem manifests.  On inspection it does not
    appear that a problem will manifest in the fragmentation needed/update pmtu
    case either.
    
    In short I believe this is a cosmetic fix. None the less, the use of
    IPPROTO_IPV6 seems wrong and confusing.

    crypto: scatterwalk - Fix test in scatterwalk_done
    
    commit 5f070e81bee35f1b7bd1477bb223a873ff657803 upstream.
    
    When there is more data to be processed, the current test in
    scatterwalk_done may prevent us from calling pagedone even when
    we should.
    
    In particular, if we're on an SG entry spanning multiple pages
    where the last page is not a full page, we will incorrectly skip
    calling pagedone on the second last page.
    
    This patch fixes this by adding a separate test for whether we've
    reached the end of a page.

    commit b30bdfa86431afbafe15284a3ad5ac19b49b88e3 upstream.
    
    As it is if you ask for a sync gcm you may actually end up with
    an async one because it does not filter out async implementations
    of ghash.
    
    This patch fixes this by adding the necessary filter when looking
    for ghash.

    The hash buffer is really HASH_BLOCK_SIZE bytes, someone
    must have thought that memmove takes n*u32 words by mistake.
    Tests work as good/bad as before after this patch.

    fix d_walk()/non-delayed __d_free() race
    
    commit 3d56c25e3bb0726a5c5e16fc2d9e38f8ed763085 upstream.
    
    Ascend-to-parent logics in d_walk() depends on all encountered child
    dentries not getting freed without an RCU delay.  Unfortunately, in
    quite a few cases it is not true, with hard-to-hit oopsable race as
    the result.
    
    Fortunately, the fix is simiple; right now the rule is "if it ever
    been hashed, freeing must be delayed" and changing it to "if it
    ever had a parent, freeing must be delayed" closes that hole and
    covers all cases the old rule used to cover.  Moreover, pipes and
    sockets remain _not_ covered, so we do not introduce RCU delay in
    the cases which are the reason for having that delay conditional

    ecryptfs: forbid opening files without mmap handler
    
    commit 2f36db71009304b3f0b95afacd8eba1f9f046b87 upstream.
    
    This prevents users from triggering a stack overflow through a recursive
    invocation of pagefault handling that involves mapping procfs files into
    virtual memory.

    parisc: Fix pagefault crash in unaligned __get_user() call
    
    commit 8b78f260887df532da529f225c49195d18fef36b upstream.

    This means the userspace program clock_adjtime called the clock_adjtime()
    syscall and then crashed inside the compat_get_timex() function.
    Syscalls should never crash programs, but instead return EFAULT.
    
    The IIR register contains the executed instruction, which disassebles
    into "ldw 0(sr3,r5),r9".
    This load-word instruction is part of __get_user() which tried to read the word
    at %r5/IOR (0xfa6f7fff). This means the unaligned handler jumped in.  The
    unaligned handler is able to emulate all ldw instructions, but it fails if it
    fails to read the source e.g. because of page fault.
    
    The following program reproduces the problem:
    
    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/syscall.h>
    #include <sys/mman.h>
    
    int main(void) {
            /* allocate 8k */
            char *ptr = mmap(NULL, 2*4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
            /* free second half (upper 4k) and make it invalid. */
            munmap(ptr+4096, 4096);
            /* syscall where first int is unaligned and clobbers into invalid memory region */
            /* syscall should return EFAULT */
            return syscall(__NR_clock_adjtime, 0, ptr+4095);
    }
    
    To fix this issue we simply need to check if the faulting instruction address
    is in the exception fixup table when the unaligned handler failed. If it
    is, call the fixup routine instead of crashing.
    
    While looking at the unaligned handler I found another issue as well: The
    target register should not be modified if the handler was unsuccessful.

    ARM: fix PTRACE_SETVFPREGS on SMP systems
    
    commit e2dfb4b880146bfd4b6aa8e138c0205407cebbaf upstream.
    
    PTRACE_SETVFPREGS fails to properly mark the VFP register set to be
    reloaded, because it undoes one of the effects of vfp_flush_hwstate().
    
    Specifically vfp_flush_hwstate() sets thread->vfpstate.hard.cpu to
    an invalid CPU number, but vfp_set() overwrites this with the original
    CPU number, thereby rendering the hardware state as apparently "valid",
    even though the software state is more recent.
    
    Fix this by reverting the previous change.

    xfs: xfs_iflush_cluster fails to abort on error
    
    commit b1438f477934f5a4d5a44df26f3079a7575d5946 upstream.
    
    When a failure due to an inode buffer occurs, the error handling
    fails to abort the inode writeback correctly. This can result in the
    inode being reclaimed whilst still in the AIL, leading to
    use-after-free situations as well as filesystems that cannot be
    unmounted as the inode log items left in the AIL never get removed.
    
    Fix this by ensuring fatal errors from xfs_imap_to_bp() result in
    the inode flush being aborted correctly.

    free_entries_lock again.  Avoid the problem by doing the printk after

    ext4: fix reference counting bug on block allocation error
    
    commit 554a5ccc4e4a20c5f3ec859de0842db4b4b9c77e upstream.
    
    If we hit this error when mounted with errors=continue or
    errors=remount-ro:
    
        EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_mb_mark_diskspace_used:2940: comm ext4.exe: Allocating blocks 5090-6081 which overlap fs metadata
    
    then ext4_mb_new_blocks() will call ext4_mb_release_context() and try to
    continue. However, ext4_mb_release_context() is the wrong thing to call
    here since we are still actually using the allocation context.
    
    Instead, just error out. We could retry the allocation, but there is a
    possibility of getting stuck in an infinite loop instead, so this seems
    safer.

    ext4: don't call ext4_should_journal_data() on the journal inode
    
    commit 6a7fd522a7c94cdef0a3b08acf8e6702056e635c upstream.
    
    If ext4_fill_super() fails early, it's possible for ext4_evict_inode()
    to call ext4_should_journal_data() before superblock options and flags
    are fully set up.  In that case, the iput() on the journal inode can
    end up causing a BUG().
    
    Work around this problem by reordering the tests so we only call
    ext4_should_journal_data() after we know it's not the journal inode.

    ext4: check for extents that wrap around
    
    commit f70749ca42943faa4d4dcce46dfdcaadb1d0c4b6 upstream.
    
    An extent with lblock = 4294967295 and len = 1 will pass the
    ext4_valid_extent() test:
    
            ext4_lblk_t last = lblock + len - 1;
    
            if (len == 0 || lblock > last)
                    return 0;
    
    since last = 4294967295 + 1 - 1 = 4294967295. This would later trigger
    the BUG_ON(es->es_lblk + es->es_len < es->es_lblk) in ext4_es_end().
    
    We can simplify it by removing the - 1 altogether and changing the test
    to use lblock + len <= lblock, since now if len = 0, then lblock + 0 ==
    lblock and it fails, and if len > 0 then lblock + len > lblock in order
    to pass (i.e. it doesn't overflow).

    ext4: verify extent header depth
    
    commit 7bc9491645118c9461bd21099c31755ff6783593 upstream.
    
    Although the extent tree depth of 5 should enough be for the worst
    case of 2*32 extents of length 1, the extent tree code does not
    currently to merge nodes which are less than half-full with a sibling
    node, or to shrink the tree depth if possible.  So it's possible, at
    least in theory, for the tree depth to be greater than 5.  However,
    even in the worst case, a tree depth of 32 is highly unlikely, and if
    the file system is maliciously corrupted, an insanely large eh_depth
    can cause memory allocation failures that will trigger kernel warnings
    (here, eh_depth = 65280):

    ext4: silence UBSAN in ext4_mb_init()
    
    commit 935244cd54b86ca46e69bc6604d2adfb1aec2d42 upstream.
    
    Currently, in ext4_mb_init(), there's a loop like the following:
    
      do {
        ...
        offset += 1 << (sb->s_blocksize_bits - i);
        i++;
      } while (i <= sb->s_blocksize_bits + 1);
    
    Note that the updated offset is used in the loop's next iteration only.
    
    However, at the last iteration, that is at i == sb->s_blocksize_bits + 1,
    the shift count becomes equal to (unsigned)-1 > 31 (c.f. C99 6.5.7(3))
    and UBSAN reports

    Unless compilers start to do some fancy transformations (which at least
    GCC 6.0.0 doesn't currently do), the issue is of cosmetic nature only: the
    such calculated value of offset is never used again.
    
    Silence UBSAN by introducing another variable, offset_incr, holding the
    next increment to apply to offset and adjust that one by right shifting it
    by one position per loop iteration.

    ext4: fix hang when processing corrupted orphaned inode list
    
    commit c9eb13a9105e2e418f72e46a2b6da3f49e696902 upstream.
    
    If the orphaned inode list contains inode #5, ext4_iget() returns a
    bad inode (since the bootloader inode should never be referenced
    directly).  Because of the bad inode, we end up processing the inode
    repeatedly and this hangs the machine.
    
    This can be reproduced via:
    
       mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 100
       debugfs -w -R "ssv last_orphan 5" /tmp/foo.img
       mount -o loop /tmp/foo.img /mnt
    
    (But don't do this if you are using an unpatched kernel if you care
    about the system staying functional.  :-)
    
    This bug was found by the port of American Fuzzy Lop into the kernel
    to find file system problems[1].  (Since it *only* happens if inode #5
    shows up on the orphan list --- 3, 7, 8, etc. won't do it, it's not
    surprising that AFL needed two hours before it found it.)

    drm/radeon: Poll for both connect/disconnect on analog connectors
    
    commit 14ff8d48f2235295dfb3117693008e367b49cdb5 upstream.
    
    DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_CONNECT only enables polling for connections, not
    disconnections. Because of this, we end up losing hotplug polling for
    analog connectors once they get connected.
    
    Easy way to reproduce:
     - Grab a machine with a radeon GPU and a VGA port
     - Plug a monitor into the VGA port, wait for it to update the connector
       from disconnected to connected
     - Disconnect the monitor on VGA, a hotplug event is never sent for the
       removal of the connector.
    
    Originally, only using DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_CONNECT might have been a good
    idea since doing VGA polling can sometimes result in having to mess with
    the DAC voltages to figure out whether or not there's actually something
    there since VGA doesn't have HPD. Doing this would have the potential of
    showing visible artifacts on the screen every time we ran a poll while a
    VGA display was connected. Luckily, radeon_vga_detect() only resorts to
    this sort of polling if the poll is forced, and DRM's polling helper
    doesn't force it's polls.
    
    Additionally, this removes some assignments to connector->polled that
    weren't actually doing anything.

    commit 05082b8bbd1a0ffc74235449c4b8930a8c240f85 upstream.
    
    When executing in a PCI passthrough based virtuzliation environment, the
    hypervisor will usually attempt to send a PCIe bus reset signal to the
    ASIC when the VM reboots. In this scenario, the card is not correctly
    initialized, but we still consider it to be posted. Therefore, in a
    passthrough based environemnt we should always post the card to guarantee
    it is in a good state for driver initialization.

    drm/fb_helper: Fix references to dev->mode_config.num_connector
    
    commit 255f0e7c418ad95a4baeda017ae6182ba9b3c423 upstream.
    
    During boot, MST hotplugs are generally expected (even if no physical
    hotplugging occurs) and result in DRM's connector topology changing.
    This means that using num_connector from the current mode configuration
    can lead to the number of connectors changing under us. This can lead to
    some nasty scenarios in fbcon:
    
    - We allocate an array to the size of dev->mode_config.num_connectors.
    - MST hotplug occurs, dev->mode_config.num_connectors gets incremented.
    - We try to loop through each element in the array using the new value
      of dev->mode_config.num_connectors, and end up going out of bounds
      since dev->mode_config.num_connectors is now larger then the array we
      allocated.
    
    fb_helper->connector_count however, will always remain consistent while
    we do a modeset in fb_helper.
    
    Note: This is just polish for 4.7, Dave Airlie's drm_connector
    refcounting fixed these bugs for real. But it's good enough duct-tape
    for stable kernel backporting, since backporting the refcounting
    changes is way too invasive.

    drm/gma500: Fix possible out of bounds read
    
    commit 7ccca1d5bf69fdd1d3c5fcf84faf1659a6e0ad11 upstream.
    
    Fix possible out of bounds read, by adding missing comma.
    The code may read pass the end of the dsi_errors array
    when the most significant bit (bit #31) in the intr_stat register
    is set.
    This bug has been detected using CppCheck (static analysis tool).

    sunrpc: fix stripping of padded MIC tokens
    
    commit c0cb8bf3a8e4bd82e640862cdd8891400405cb89 upstream.
    
    The length of the GSS MIC token need not be a multiple of four bytes.
    It is then padded by XDR to a multiple of 4 B, but unwrap_integ_data()
    would previously only trim mic.len + 4 B. The remaining up to three
    bytes would then trigger a check in nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs(),
    leading to a "garbage args" error and mount failure:
    
    nfs4svc_decode_compoundargs: compound not properly padded!
    nfsd: failed to decode arguments!
    
    This would prevent older clients using the pre-RFC 4121 MIC format
    (37-byte MIC including a 9-byte OID) from mounting exports from v3.9+
    servers using krb5i.
    
    The trimming was introduced by commit 4c190e2f913f ("sunrpc: trim off
    trailing checksum before returning decrypted or integrity authenticated
    buffer").

    powerpc/tm: Always reclaim in start_thread() for exec() class syscalls
    
    commit 8e96a87c5431c256feb65bcfc5aec92d9f7839b6 upstream.
    
    Userspace can quite legitimately perform an exec() syscall with a
    suspended transaction. exec() does not return to the old process, rather
    it load a new one and starts that, the expectation therefore is that the
    new process starts not in a transaction. Currently exec() is not treated
    any differently to any other syscall which creates problems.
    
    Firstly it could allow a new process to start with a suspended
    transaction for a binary that no longer exists. This means that the
    checkpointed state won't be valid and if the suspended transaction were
    ever to be resumed and subsequently aborted (a possibility which is
    exceedingly likely as exec()ing will likely doom the transaction) the
    new process will jump to invalid state.
    
    Secondly the incorrect attempt to keep the transactional state while
    still zeroing state for the new process creates at least two TM Bad
    Things. The first triggers on the rfid to return to userspace as
    start_thread() has given the new process a 'clean' MSR but the suspend
    will still be set in the hardware MSR. The second TM Bad Thing triggers
    in __switch_to() as the processor is still transactionally suspended but
    __switch_to() wants to zero the TM sprs for the new process.
    
    This is an example of the outcome of calling exec() with a suspended
    transaction. Note the first 700 is likely the first TM bad thing
    decsribed earlier only the kernel can't report it as we've loaded
    userspace registers. c000000000009980 is the rfid in
    fast_exception_return()

    powerpc/pseries: Fix PCI config address for DDW
    
    commit 8a934efe94347eee843aeea65bdec8077a79e259 upstream.
    
    In commit 8445a87f7092 "powerpc/iommu: Remove the dependency on EEH
    struct in DDW mechanism", the PE address was replaced with the PCI
    config address in order to remove dependency on EEH. According to PAPR
    spec, firmware (pHyp or QEMU) should accept "xxBBSSxx" format PCI config
    address, not "xxxxBBSS" provided by the patch. Note that "BB" is PCI bus
    number and "SS" is the combination of slot and function number.
    
    This fixes the PCI address passed to DDW RTAS calls.

    powerpc/iommu: Remove the dependency on EEH struct in DDW mechanism
    
    commit 8445a87f7092bc8336ea1305be9306f26b846d93 upstream.
    
    Commit 39baadbf36ce ("powerpc/eeh: Remove eeh information from pci_dn")
    changed the pci_dn struct by removing its EEH-related members.
    As part of this clean-up, DDW mechanism was modified to read the device
    configuration address from eeh_dev struct.
    
    As a consequence, now if we disable EEH mechanism on kernel command-line
    for example, the DDW mechanism will fail, generating a kernel oops by
    dereferencing a NULL pointer (which turns to be the eeh_dev pointer).
    
    This patch just changes the configuration address calculation on DDW
    functions to a manual calculation based on pci_dn members instead of
    using eeh_dev-based address.
    
    No functional changes were made. This was tested on pSeries, both
    in PHyp and qemu guest.

    powerpc/pseries/eeh: Handle RTAS delay requests in configure_bridge
    
    commit 871e178e0f2c4fa788f694721a10b4758d494ce1 upstream.
    
    In the "ibm,configure-pe" and "ibm,configure-bridge" RTAS calls, the
    spec states that values of 9900-9905 can be returned, indicating that
    software should delay for 10^x (where x is the last digit, i.e. 990x)
    milliseconds and attempt the call again. Currently, the kernel doesn't
    know about this, and respecting it fixes some PCI failures when the
    hypervisor is busy.
    
    The delay is capped at 0.2 seconds.

    powerpc: Fix definition of SIAR and SDAR registers
    
    commit d23fac2b27d94aeb7b65536a50d32bfdc21fe01e upstream.
    
    The SIAR and SDAR registers are available twice, one time as SPRs
    780 / 781 (unprivileged, but read-only), and one time as the SPRs
    796 / 797 (privileged, but read and write). The Linux kernel code
    currently uses the unprivileged  SPRs - while this is OK for reading,
    writing to that register of course does not work.
    Since the KVM code tries to write to this register, too (see the mtspr
    in book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S), the contents of this register sometimes get
    lost for the guests, e.g. during migration of a VM.
    To fix this issue, simply switch to the privileged SPR numbers instead.

    powerpc/book3s64: Fix branching to OOL handlers in relocatable kernel
    
    commit 8ed8ab40047a570fdd8043a40c104a57248dd3fd upstream.
    
    Some of the interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER server processors are only
    32 bytes long (8 instructions), which is not enough for the full
    first-level interrupt handler. For these we need to branch to an
    out-of-line (OOL) handler. But when we are running a relocatable kernel,
    interrupt vectors till __end_interrupts marker are copied down to real
    address 0x100. So, branching to labels (ie. OOL handlers) outside this
    section must be handled differently (see LOAD_HANDLER()), considering
    relocatable kernel, which would need at least 4 instructions.
    
    However, branching from interrupt vector means that we corrupt the
    CFAR (come-from address register) on POWER7 and later processors as
    mentioned in commit 1707dd16. So, EXCEPTION_PROLOG_0 (6 instructions)
    that contains the part up to the point where the CFAR is saved in the
    PACA should be part of the short interrupt vectors before we branch out
    to OOL handlers.
    
    But as mentioned already, there are interrupt vectors on 64-bit POWER
    server processors that are only 32 bytes long (like vectors 0x4f00,
    0x4f20, etc.), which cannot accomodate the above two cases at the same
    time owing to space constraint. Currently, in these interrupt vectors,
    we simply branch out to OOL handlers, without using LOAD_HANDLER(),
    which leaves us vulnerable when running a relocatable kernel (eg. kdump
    case). While this has been the case for sometime now and kdump is used
    widely, we were fortunate not to see any problems so far, for three
    reasons:
    
      1. In almost all cases, production kernel (relocatable) is used for
         kdump as well, which would mean that crashed kernel's OOL handler
         would be at the same place where we end up branching to, from short
         interrupt vector of kdump kernel.
      2. Also, OOL handler was unlikely the reason for crash in almost all
         the kdump scenarios, which meant we had a sane OOL handler from
         crashed kernel that we branched to.
      3. On most 64-bit POWER server processors, page size is large enough
         that marking interrupt vector code as executable (see commit
         429d2e83) leads to marking OOL handler code from crashed kernel,
         that sits right below interrupt vector code from kdump kernel, as
         executable as well.
    
    Let us fix this by moving the __end_interrupts marker down past OOL
    handlers to make sure that we also copy OOL handlers to real address
    0x100 when running a relocatable kernel.
    
    This fix has been tested successfully in kdump scenario, on an LPAR with
    4K page size by using different default/production kernel and kdump
    kernel.
    
    Also tested by manually corrupting the OOL handlers in the first kernel
    and then kdump'ing, and then causing the OOL handlers to fire - mpe.

      pci 0000:ff:12.0: BAR 6: failed to assign [mem size 0x00000001 pref]
    
    Move the non-compliant BAR check from __pci_read_base() up to
    pci_read_bases() so it applies to the expansion ROM BAR as well as
    to BARs 0-5.
    
    Note that direct callers of __pci_read_base(), like sriov_init(), will now
    bypass this check.  We haven't had reports of devices with broken SR-IOV
    BARs yet.

    aacraid: Fix for aac_command_thread hang
    
    commit fc4bf75ea300a5e62a2419f89dd0e22189dd7ab7 upstream.
    
    Typically under error conditions, it is possible for aac_command_thread()
    to miss the wakeup from kthread_stop() and go back to sleep, causing it
    to hang aac_shutdown.
    
    In the observed scenario, the adapter is not functioning correctly and so
    aac_fib_send() never completes (or time-outs depending on how it was
    called). Shortly after aac_command_thread() starts it performs
    aac_fib_send(SendHostTime) which hangs. When aac_probe_one
    /aac_get_adapter_info send time outs, kthread_stop is called which breaks
    the command thread out of it's hang.
    
    The code will still go back to sleep in schedule_timeout() without
    checking kthread_should_stop() so it causes aac_probe_one to hang until
    the schedule_timeout() which is 30 minutes.
    
    Fixed by: Adding another kthread_should_stop() before schedule_timeout()

    aacraid: Relinquish CPU during timeout wait
    
    commit 07beca2be24cc710461c0b131832524c9ee08910 upstream.
    
    aac_fib_send has a special function case for initial commands during
    driver initialization using wait < 0(pseudo sync mode). In this case,
    the command does not sleep but rather spins checking for timeout.This
    loop is calls cpu_relax() in an attempt to allow other processes/threads
    to use the CPU, but this function does not relinquish the CPU and so the
    command will hog the processor. This was observed in a KDUMP
    "crashkernel" and that prevented the "command thread" (which is
    responsible for completing the command from being timed out) from
    starting because it could not get the CPU.
    
    Fixed by replacing "cpu_relax()" call with "schedule()"

    MIPS: KVM: Fix modular KVM under QEMU
    
    commit 797179bc4fe06c89e47a9f36f886f68640b423f8 upstream.
    
    Copy __kvm_mips_vcpu_run() into unmapped memory, so that we can never
    get a TLB refill exception in it when KVM is built as a module.
    
    This was observed to happen with the host MIPS kernel running under
    QEMU, due to a not entirely transparent optimisation in the QEMU TLB
    handling where TLB entries replaced with TLBWR are copied to a separate
    part of the TLB array. Code in those pages continue to be executable,
    but those mappings persist only until the next ASID switch, even if they
    are marked global.
    
    An ASID switch happens in __kvm_mips_vcpu_run() at exception level after
    switching to the guest exception base. Subsequent TLB mapped kernel
    instructions just prior to switching to the guest trigger a TLB refill
    exception, which enters the guest exception handlers without updating
    EPC. This appears as a guest triggered TLB refill on a host kernel
    mapped (host KSeg2) address, which is not handled correctly as user
    (guest) mode accesses to kernel (host) segments always generate address
    error exceptions.

    MIPS: ath79: make bootconsole wait for both THRE and TEMT
    
    commit f5b556c94c8490d42fea79d7b4ae0ecbc291e69d upstream.
    
    This makes the ath79 bootconsole behave the same way as the generic 8250
    bootconsole.
    
    Also waiting for TEMT (transmit buffer is empty) instead of just THRE
    (transmit buffer is not full) ensures that all characters have been
    transmitted before the real serial driver starts reconfiguring the serial
    controller (which would sometimes result in garbage being transmitted.)
    This change does not cause a visible performance loss.
    
    In addition, this seems to fix a hang observed in certain configurations on
    many AR7xxx/AR9xxx SoCs during autoconfig of the real serial driver.
    
    A more complete follow-up patch will disable 8250 autoconfig for ath79
    altogether (the serial controller is detected as a 16550A, which is not
    fully compatible with the ath79 serial, and the autoconfig may lead to
    undefined behavior on ath79.)

    When emulating a jalr instruction with rd == $0, the code in

    always remain zeroed. This would lead to any further instructions

    context switched, at which point the value of $0 in the task context
    would be restored to the correct zero by a store in SAVE_SOME. Fix this
    by not writing to rd if it is $0.

    MIPS: KVM: Fix mapped fault broken commpage handling
    
    commit c604cffa93478f8888bec62b23d6073dad03d43a upstream.
    
    kvm_mips_handle_mapped_seg_tlb_fault() appears to map the guest page at
    virtual address 0 to PFN 0 if the guest has created its own mapping
    there. The intention is unclear, but it may have been an attempt to
    protect the zero page from being mapped to anything but the comm page in
    code paths you wouldn't expect from genuine commpage accesses (guest
    kernel mode cache instructions on that address, hitting trapping
    instructions when executing from that address with a coincidental TLB
    eviction during the KVM handling, and guest user mode accesses to that
    address).
    
    Fix this to check for mappings exactly at KVM_GUEST_COMMPAGE_ADDR (it
    may not be at address 0 since commit 42aa12e74e91 ("MIPS: KVM: Move
    commpage so 0x0 is unmapped")), and set the corresponding EntryLo to be
    interpreted as 0 (invalid).

    tcp: consider recv buf for the initial window scale
    
    commit f626300a3e776ccc9671b0dd94698fb3aa315966 upstream.
    
    tcp_select_initial_window() intends to advertise a window
    scaling for the maximum possible window size. To do so,
    it considers the maximum of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2] and
    net.core.rmem_max as the only possible upper-bounds.
    However, users with CAP_NET_ADMIN can use SO_RCVBUFFORCE
    to set the socket's receive buffer size to values
    larger than net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2] and net.core.rmem_max.
    Thus, SO_RCVBUFFORCE is effectively ignored by
    tcp_select_initial_window().
    
    To fix this, consider the maximum of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem[2],

    tcp: make challenge acks less predictable
    
    commit 75ff39ccc1bd5d3c455b6822ab09e533c551f758 upstream.
    
    From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
    
    Yue Cao claims that current host rate limiting of challenge ACKS
    (RFC 5961) could leak enough information to allow a patient attacker
    to hijack TCP sessions. He will soon provide details in an academic
    paper.
    
    This patch increases the default limit from 100 to 1000, and adds
    some randomization so that the attacker can no longer hijack
    sessions without spending a considerable amount of probes.
    
    Based on initial analysis and patch from Linus.
    
    Note that we also have per socket rate limiting, so it is tempting
    to remove the host limit in the future.
    
    v2: randomize the count of challenge acks per second, not the period.

    tmpfs: fix regression hang in fallocate undo
    
    commit 7f556567036cb7f89aabe2f0954b08566b4efb53 upstream.
    
    The well-spotted fallocate undo fix is good in most cases, but not when
    fallocate failed on the very first page.  index 0 then passes lend -1
    to shmem_undo_range(), and that has two bad effects: (a) that it will
    undo every fallocation throughout the file, unrestricted by the current
    range; but more importantly (b) it can cause the undo to hang, because
    lend -1 is treated as truncation, which makes it keep on retrying until
    every page has gone, but those already fully instantiated will never go
    away.  Big thank you to xfstests generic/269 which demonstrates this.

    When fallocate is interrupted it will undo a range that extends one byte

    libceph: apply new_state before new_up_client on incrementals
    
    commit 930c532869774ebf8af9efe9484c597f896a7d46 upstream.
    
    Currently, osd_weight and osd_state fields are updated in the encoding
    order.  This is wrong, because an incremental map may look like e.g.
    
        new_up_client: { osd=6, addr=... } # set osd_state and addr
        new_state: { osd=6, xorstate=EXISTS } # clear osd_state
    
    Suppose osd6's current osd_state is EXISTS (i.e. osd6 is down).  After
    applying new_up_client, osd_state is changed to EXISTS | UP.  Carrying
    on with the new_state update, we flip EXISTS and leave osd6 in a weird
    "!EXISTS but UP" state.  A non-existent OSD is considered down by the
    mapping code
    
    2087    for (i = 0; i < pg->pg_temp.len; i++) {
    2088            if (ceph_osd_is_down(osdmap, pg->pg_temp.osds[i])) {
    2089                    if (ceph_can_shift_osds(pi))
    2090                            continue;
    2091
    2092                    temp->osds[temp->size++] = CRUSH_ITEM_NONE;
    
    and so requests get directed to the second OSD in the set instead of
    the first, resulting in OSD-side errors like:
    
    [WRN] : client.4239 192.168.122.21:0/2444980242 misdirected client.4239.1:2827 pg 2.5df899f2 to osd.4 not [1,4,6] in e680/680
    
    and hung rbds on the client:
    
    [  493.566367] rbd: rbd0: write 400000 at 11cc00000 (0)
    [  493.566805] rbd: rbd0:   result -6 xferred 400000
    [  493.567011] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev rbd0, sector 9330688
    
    The fix is to decouple application from the decoding and:
    - apply new_weight first
    - apply new_state before new_up_client
    - twiddle osd_state flags if marking in
    - clear out some of the state if osd is destroyed

    printk: do cond_resched() between lines while outputting to consoles
    
    commit 8d91f8b15361dfb438ab6eb3b319e2ded43458ff upstream.
    
    @console_may_schedule tracks whether console_sem was acquired through
    lock or trylock.  If the former, we're inside a sleepable context and
    console_conditional_schedule() performs cond_resched().  This allows
    console drivers which use console_lock for synchronization to yield
    while performing time-consuming operations such as scrolling.
    
    However, the actual console outputting is performed while holding
    irq-safe logbuf_lock, so console_unlock() clears @console_may_schedule
    before starting outputting lines.  Also, only a few drivers call
    console_conditional_schedule() to begin with.  This means that when a
    lot of lines need to be output by console_unlock(), for example on a
    console registration, the task doing console_unlock() may not yield for
    a long time on a non-preemptible kernel.
    
    If this happens with a slow console devices, for example a serial
    console, the outputting task may occupy the cpu for a very long time.
    Long enough to trigger softlockup and/or RCU stall warnings, which in
    turn pile more messages, sometimes enough to trigger the next cycle of
    warnings incapacitating the system.
    
    Fix it by making console_unlock() insert cond_resched() between lines if
    @console_may_schedule.

    mm: migrate dirty page without clear_page_dirty_for_io etc
    
    commit 42cb14b110a5698ccf26ce59c4441722605a3743 upstream.
    
    clear_page_dirty_for_io() has accumulated writeback and memcg subtleties
    since v2.6.16 first introduced page migration; and the set_page_dirty()
    which completed its migration of PageDirty, later had to be moderated to
    __set_page_dirty_nobuffers(); then PageSwapBacked had to skip that too.
    
    No actual problems seen with this procedure recently, but if you look into
    what the clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)+set_page_dirty(newpage) is actually
    achieving, it turns out to be nothing more than moving the PageDirty flag,
    and its NR_FILE_DIRTY stat from one zone to another.
    
    It would be good to avoid a pile of irrelevant decrementations and
    incrementations, and improper event counting, and unnecessary descent of
    the radix_tree under tree_lock (to set the PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY which
    radix_tree_replace_slot() left in place anyway).
    
    Do the NR_FILE_DIRTY movement, like the other stats movements, while
    interrupts still disabled in migrate_page_move_mapping(); and don't even
    bother if the zone is the same.  Do the PageDirty movement there under
    tree_lock too, where old page is frozen and newpage not yet visible:
    bearing in mind that as soon as newpage becomes visible in radix_tree, an
    un-page-locked set_page_dirty() might interfere (or perhaps that's just
    not possible: anything doing so should already hold an additional
    reference to the old page, preventing its migration; but play safe).
    
    But we do still need to transfer PageDirty in migrate_page_copy(), for
    those who don't go the mapping route through migrate_page_move_mapping().

    KEYS: potential uninitialized variable
    
    commit 38327424b40bcebe2de92d07312c89360ac9229a upstream.
    
    If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
    added a check to fix that.
    
    This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
    difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
    would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():
    
     (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
         to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
         attempt.
    
     (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
         and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
         time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
         from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
         of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
         rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
         has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.
    
     (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
         keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
         sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
         so that it fails with EDQUOT.
    
    The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
    following:
    
            echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
            keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t
    
    The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
    easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
    the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
    between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
    changing the amount of quota used.
    
    Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:

    pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes
    
    commit 759c01142a5d0f364a462346168a56de28a80f52 upstream.
    
    On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
    OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
    typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).

    x86/mm: Add barriers and document switch_mm()-vs-flush synchronization
    
    commit 71b3c126e61177eb693423f2e18a1914205b165e upstream.
    
    When switch_mm() activates a new PGD, it also sets a bit that
    tells other CPUs that the PGD is in use so that TLB flush IPIs
    will be sent.  In order for that to work correctly, the bit
    needs to be visible prior to loading the PGD and therefore
    starting to fill the local TLB.
    
    Document all the barriers that make this work correctly and add
    a couple that were missing.

    usb: renesas_usbhs: protect the CFIFOSEL setting in usbhsg_ep_enable()
    
    commit 15e4292a2d21e9997fdb2b8c014cc461b3f268f0 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes an issue that the CFIFOSEL register value is possible
    to be changed by usbhsg_ep_enable() wrongly. And then, a data transfer
    using CFIFO may not work correctly.
    
    For example:
     # modprobe g_multi file=usb-storage.bin
     # ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.1 up
     (During the USB host is sending file to the mass storage)
     # ifconfig usb0 down
    
    In this case, since the u_ether.c may call usb_ep_enable() in
    eth_stop(), if the renesas_usbhs driver is also using CFIFO for
    mass storage, the mass storage may not work correctly.
    
    So, this patch adds usbhs_lock() and usbhs_unlock() calling in
    usbhsg_ep_enable() to protect CFIFOSEL register. This is because:
     - CFIFOSEL.CURPIPE = 0 is also needed for the pipe configuration
     - The CFIFOSEL (fifo->sel) is already protected by usbhs_lock()

    commit f3eec0cf784e0d6c47822ca6b66df3d5812af7e6 upstream.
    
    shared_fifo endpoints would only get a previous tx state cleared
    out, the rx state was only cleared for non shared_fifo endpoints
    Change this so that the rx state is cleared for all endpoints.
    This addresses an issue that resulted in rx packets being dropped

    usb: musb: Stop bulk endpoint while queue is rotated
    
    commit 7b2c17f829545df27a910e8d82e133c21c9a8c9c upstream.
    
    Ensure that the endpoint is stopped by clearing REQPKT before
    clearing DATAERR_NAKTIMEOUT before rotating the queue on the
    dedicated bulk endpoint.
    This addresses an issue where a race could result in the endpoint
    receiving data before it was reprogrammed resulting in a warning
    about such data from musb_rx_reinit before it was thrown away.
    The data thrown away was a valid packet that had been correctly
    ACKed which meant the host and device got out of sync.

    USB: fix invalid memory access in hub_activate()
    
    commit e50293ef9775c5f1cf3fcc093037dd6a8c5684ea upstream.
    
    Commit 8520f38099cc ("USB: change hub initialization sleeps to
    delayed_work") changed the hub_activate() routine to make part of it
    run in a workqueue.  However, the commit failed to take a reference to
    the usb_hub structure or to lock the hub interface while doing so.  As
    a result, if a hub is plugged in and quickly unplugged before the work
    routine can run, the routine will try to access memory that has been
    deallocated.  Or, if the hub is unplugged while the routine is
    running, the memory may be deallocated while it is in active use.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by taking a reference to the usb_hub at
    the start of hub_activate() and releasing it at the end (when the work
    is finished), and by locking the hub interface while the work routine
    is running.  It also adds a check at the start of the routine to see
    if the hub has already been disconnected, in which nothing should be
    done.

    udp: properly support MSG_PEEK with truncated buffers
    
    commit 197c949e7798fbf28cfadc69d9ca0c2abbf93191 upstream.
    
    Backport of this upstream commit into stable kernels :
    89c22d8c3b27 ("net: Fix skb csum races when peeking")
    exposed a bug in udp stack vs MSG_PEEK support, when user provides
    a buffer smaller than skb payload.
    
    In this case,
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr),
                                     msg->msg_iov);
    returns -EFAULT.
    
    This bug does not happen in upstream kernels since Al Viro did a great
    job to replace this into :
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_msg(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr), msg);
    This variant is safe vs short buffers.
    
    For the time being, instead reverting Herbert Xu patch and add back
    skb->ip_summed invalid changes, simply store the result of
    udp_lib_checksum_complete() so that we avoid computing the checksum a
    second time, and avoid the problematic
    skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec() call.
    
    This patch can be applied on recent kernels as it avoids a double
    checksumming, then backported to stable kernels as a bug fix.

    PCI/ACPI: Fix _OSC ordering to allow PCIe hotplug use when available
    
    commit 3dc48af310709b85d07c8b0d3aa8f1ead02829d3 upstream.
    
    This fixes the problem of acpiphp claiming slots that should be managed
    by pciehp, which may keep ExpressCard slots from working.
    
    The acpiphp driver claims PCIe slots unless the BIOS has granted us
    control of PCIe native hotplug via _OSC.  Prior to v3.10, the acpiphp
    .add method (add_bridge()) was always called *after* we had requested
    native hotplug control with _OSC.
    
    But after 3b63aaa70e ("PCI: acpiphp: Do not use ACPI PCI subdriver
    mechanism"), which appeared in v3.10, acpiphp initialization is done
    during the bus scan via the pcibios_add_bus() hook, and this happens
    *before* we request native hotplug control.
    
    Therefore, acpiphp doesn't know yet whether the BIOS will grant control,
    and it claims slots that we should be handling with native hotplug.
    
    This patch requests native hotplug control earlier, so we know whether
    the BIOS granted it to us before we initialize acpiphp.
    
    To avoid reintroducing the ASPM issue fixed by b8178f130e ('Revert
    "PCI/ACPI: Request _OSC control before scanning PCI root bus"'), we run
    _OSC earlier but defer the actual ASPM calls until after the bus scan is
    complete.
    
    Tested successfully by myself.

    signal: remove warning about using SI_TKILL in rt_[tg]sigqueueinfo
    
    commit 69828dce7af2cb6d08ef5a03de687d422fb7ec1f upstream.
    
    Sending SI_TKILL from rt_[tg]sigqueueinfo was deprecated, so now we issue
    a warning on the first attempt of doing it.  We use WARN_ON_ONCE, which is
    not informative and, what is worse, taints the kernel, making the trinity
    syscall fuzzer complain false-positively from time to time.
    
    It does not look like we need this warning at all, because the behaviour
    changed quite a long time ago (2.6.39), and if an application relies on
    the old API, it gets EPERM anyway and can issue a warning by itself.
    
    So let us zap the warning in kernel.

    perf/x86: Honor the architectural performance monitoring version
    
    commit 2c33645d366d13b969d936b68b9f4875b1fdddea upstream.
    
    Architectural performance monitoring, version 1, doesn't support fixed counters.
    
    Currently, even if a hypervisor advertises support for architectural
    performance monitoring version 1, perf may still try to use the fixed
    counters, as the constraints are set up based on the CPU model.
    
    This patch ensures that perf honors the architectural performance monitoring
    version returned by CPUID, and it only uses the fixed counters for version 2
    and above.
    
    (Some of the ideas in this patch came from Peter Zijlstra.)

    commit d26e2c9ffa385dd1b646f43c1397ba12af9ed431 upstream.
    
    This partially reverts commit 1086bbe97a07 ("netfilter: ensure number of
    counters is >0 in do_replace()") in net/bridge/netfilter/ebtables.c.
    
    Setting rules with ebtables does not work any more with 1086bbe97a07 place.
    
    There is an error message and no rules set in the end.
    
    e.g.
    
    ~# ebtables -t nat -A POSTROUTING --src 12:34:56:78:9a:bc -j DROP
    Unable to update the kernel. Two possible causes:
    1. Multiple ebtables programs were executing simultaneously. The ebtables
       userspace tool doesn't by default support multiple ebtables programs
    running
    
    Reverting the ebtables part of 1086bbe97a07 makes this work again.

    netfilter: x_tables: do compat validation via translate_table
    
    commit 09d9686047dbbe1cf4faa558d3ecc4aae2046054 upstream.
    
    This looks like refactoring, but its also a bug fix.
    
    Problem is that the compat path (32bit iptables, 64bit kernel) lacks a few
    sanity tests that are done in the normal path.
    
    For example, we do not check for underflows and the base chain policies.
    
    While its possible to also add such checks to the compat path, its more
    copy&pastry, for instance we cannot reuse check_underflow() helper as
    e->target_offset differs in the compat case.
    
    Other problem is that it makes auditing for validation errors harder; two
    places need to be checked and kept in sync.
    
    At a high level 32 bit compat works like this:
    1- initial pass over blob:
       validate match/entry offsets, bounds checking
       lookup all matches and targets
       do bookkeeping wrt. size delta of 32/64bit structures
       assign match/target.u.kernel pointer (points at kernel
       implementation, needed to access ->compatsize etc.)
    
    2- allocate memory according to the total bookkeeping size to
       contain the translated ruleset
    
    3- second pass over original blob:
       for each entry, copy the 32bit representation to the newly allocated
       memory.  This also does any special match translations (e.g.
       adjust 32bit to 64bit longs, etc).
    
    4- check if ruleset is free of loops (chase all jumps)
    
    5-first pass over translated blob:
       call the checkentry function of all matches and targets.
    
    The alternative implemented by this patch is to drop steps 3&4 from the
    compat process, the translation is changed into an intermediate step
    rather than a full 1:1 translate_table replacement.
    
    In the 2nd pass (step #3), change the 64bit ruleset back to a kernel
    representation, i.e. put() the kernel pointer and restore ->u.user.name .
    
    This gets us a 64bit ruleset that is in the format generated by a 64bit
    iptables userspace -- we can then use translate_table() to get the
    'native' sanity checks.
    
    This has two drawbacks:
    
    1. we re-validate all the match and target entry structure sizes even
    though compat translation is supposed to never generate bogus offsets.
    2. we put and then re-lookup each match and target.
    
    THe upside is that we get all sanity tests and ruleset validations
    provided by the normal path and can remove some duplicated compat code.
    
    iptables-restore time of autogenerated ruleset with 300k chains of form
    -A CHAIN0001 -m limit --limit 1/s -j CHAIN0002
    -A CHAIN0002 -m limit --limit 1/s -j CHAIN0003
    
    shows no noticeable differences in restore times:
    old:   0m30.796s
    new:   0m31.521s
    64bit: 0m25.674s

    netfilter: ensure number of counters is >0 in do_replace()
    
    commit 1086bbe97a074844188c6c988fa0b1a98c3ccbb9 upstream.
    
    After improving setsockopt() coverage in trinity, I started triggering
    vmalloc failures pretty reliably from this code path:
    
    warn_alloc_failed+0xe9/0x140
    __vmalloc_node_range+0x1be/0x270
    vzalloc+0x4b/0x50
    __do_replace+0x52/0x260 [ip_tables]
    do_ipt_set_ctl+0x15d/0x1d0 [ip_tables]
    nf_setsockopt+0x65/0x90
    ip_setsockopt+0x61/0xa0
    raw_setsockopt+0x16/0x60
    sock_common_setsockopt+0x14/0x20
    SyS_setsockopt+0x71/0xd0
    
    It turns out we don't validate that the num_counters field in the
    struct we pass in from userspace is initialized.
    
    The same problem also exists in ebtables, arptables, ipv6, and the
    compat variants.

    netfilter: x_tables: don't reject valid target size on some architectures
    
    commit 7b7eba0f3515fca3296b8881d583f7c1042f5226 upstream.
    
    Quoting John Stultz:
      In updating a 32bit arm device from 4.6 to Linus' current HEAD, I
      noticed I was having some trouble with networking, and realized that
      /proc/net/ip_tables_names was suddenly empty.
      Digging through the registration process, it seems we're catching on the:
    
       if (strcmp(t->u.user.name, XT_STANDARD_TARGET) == 0 &&
           target_offset + sizeof(struct xt_standard_target) != next_offset)
             return -EINVAL;
    
      Where next_offset seems to be 4 bytes larger then the
      offset + standard_target struct size.
    
    next_offset needs to be aligned via XT_ALIGN (so we can access all members
    of ip(6)t_entry struct).
    
    This problem didn't show up on i686 as it only needs 4-byte alignment for
    u64, but iptables userspace on other 32bit arches does insert extra padding.

    commit ce683e5f9d045e5d67d1312a42b359cb2ab2a13c upstream.
    
    We're currently asserting that targetoff + targetsize <= nextoff.
    
    Extend it to also check that targetoff is >= sizeof(xt_entry).
    Since this is generic code, add an argument pointing to the start of the
    match/target, we can then derive the base structure size from the delta.
    
    We also need the e->elems pointer in a followup change to validate matches.

    netfilter: x_tables: check standard target size too
    
    commit 7ed2abddd20cf8f6bd27f65bd218f26fa5bf7f44 upstream.
    
    We have targets and standard targets -- the latter carries a verdict.
    
    The ip/ip6tables validation functions will access t->verdict for the
    standard targets to fetch the jump offset or verdict for chainloop
    detection, but this happens before the targets get checked/validated.
    
    Thus we also need to check for verdict presence here, else t->verdict
    can point right after a blob.

    that t->u.target_size fits within the current rule.
    
    Unfortunately these checks are not sufficient.

    checks into a helper, then extend this helper in followup patches.

    netfilter: x_tables: fix unconditional helper
    
    commit 54d83fc74aa9ec72794373cb47432c5f7fb1a309 upstream.
    
    Ben Hawkes says:
    
     In the mark_source_chains function (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c) it
     is possible for a user-supplied ipt_entry structure to have a large
     next_offset field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing a
     counter value at the supplied offset.
    
    Problem is that mark_source_chains should not have been called --
    the rule doesn't have a next entry, so its supposed to return
    an absolute verdict of either ACCEPT or DROP.
    
    However, the function conditional() doesn't work as the name implies.
    It only checks that the rule is using wildcard address matching.
    
    However, an unconditional rule must also not be using any matches
    (no -m args).
    
    The underflow validator only checked the addresses, therefore
    passing the 'unconditional absolute verdict' test, while
    mark_source_chains also tested for presence of matches, and thus
    proceeeded to the next (not-existent) rule.
    
    Unify this so that all the callers have same idea of 'unconditional rule'.
