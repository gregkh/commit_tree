    netfilter: nf_conntrack_ipv6: Plug sk_buff leak in fragment handling
    
    commit 142dcdd3c25fc7a3866bb06980e8f93a2ed7e050 upstream.
    
    In commit 4cdd3408 ("netfilter: nf_conntrack_ipv6: improve fragmentation
    handling"), an sk_buff leak was introduced when dealing with reassembled
    packets by grabbing a reference to the original skb instead of the
    reassembled skb.  At this point, the leak only impacted conntracks with an
    associated helper.
    
    In commit 58a317f1 ("netfilter: ipv6: add IPv6 NAT support"), the bug was
    expanded to include all reassembled packets with unconfirmed conntracks.
    
    Fix this by grabbing a reference to the proper reassembled skb.  This
    closes netfilter bugzilla #823.

    mac80211: work around broken APs not including HT info
    
    commit 35d865afbbdf79e492f7d61df92b1a9e1d93d26f upstream.
    
    There are some APs, notably 2G/3G/4G Wifi routers, specifically the
    "Onda PN51T", "Vodafone PocketWiFi 2", "ZTE MF60" and a similar
    T-Mobile branded device [1] that erroneously don't include all the
    needed information in (re)association response frames. Work around
    this by assuming the information is the same as it was in the
    beacon or probe response and using the data from there instead.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58881.
    
    [1] https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1277305
    
    Note that this requires marking the first ieee802_11_parse_elems()
    argument const, otherwise we'd get a compiler warning.

    can: usb_8dev: unregister netdev before free()ing
    
    commit 4afe2156eb639e563d6ef0c2706b66ea400348b2 upstream.
    
    The usb_8dev hardware has problems on some xhci USB hosts. The driver fails to
    read the firmware revision in the probe function. This leads to the following
    Oops:
    
        [ 3356.635912] kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:5701!
    
    The driver tries to free the netdev, which has already been registered, without
    unregistering it.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by unregistering the netdev in the error path.

    libata-acpi: add back ACPI based hotplug functionality
    
    commit 44521527be36172864e6e7a6fba4b66e9aa48e40 upstream.
    
    Commit 30dcf76acc69 "libata: migrate ACPI code over to new bindings"
    mistakenly dropped the code to register hotplug notificaion handler
    for ATA port/devices, causing regression for people using ATA bay,
    as kernel bug #59871 shows.
    
    Fix this by adding back the hotplug notification handler registration
    code.  Since this code has to be run once and notification needs to
    be installed on every ATA port/devices handle no matter if there is
    actual device attached, we can't do this in binding time for ATA
    device ACPI handle, as the binding only occurs when a SCSI device is
    created, i.e. there is device attached.  So introduce the
    ata_acpi_hotplug_init() function to loop scan all ATA ACPI handles
    and if it is available, install the notificaion handler for it during
    ATA init time.
    
    With the ATA ACPI handle binding to SCSI device tree, it is possible
    now that when the SCSI hotplug work removes the SCSI device, the ACPI
    unbind function will find that the corresponding ACPI device has
    already been deleted by dock driver, causing a scaring message like:
    [  128.263966] scsi 4:0:0:0: Oops, 'acpi_handle' corrupt
    Fix this by waiting for SCSI hotplug task finish in our notificaion
    handler, so that the removal of ACPI device done in ACPI unbind
    function triggered by the removal of SCSI device is run earlier when
    ACPI device is still available.
    
    [The only change I've made is to remove the two NULL params in
    register_hotplug_dock_device, which doesn't accept those params
    in pre-v3.10 kernels. - aaron.lu]

    UBIFS: fix a horrid bug
    
    commit 605c912bb843c024b1ed173dc427cd5c08e5d54d upstream.
    
    Al Viro pointed me to the fact that '->readdir()' and '->llseek()' have no
    mutual exclusion, which means the 'ubifs_dir_llseek()' can be run while we are
    in the middle of 'ubifs_readdir()'.
    
    This means that 'file->private_data' can be freed while 'ubifs_readdir()' uses
    it, and this is a very bad bug: not only 'ubifs_readdir()' can return garbage,
    but this may corrupt memory and lead to all kinds of problems like crashes an
    security holes.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by using the 'file->f_version' field, which
    '->llseek()' always unconditionally sets to zero. We set it to 1 in
    'ubifs_readdir()' and whenever we detect that it became 0, we know there was a
    seek and it is time to clear the state saved in 'file->private_data'.
    
    I tested this patch by writing a user-space program which runds readdir and
    seek in parallell. I could easily crash the kernel without these patches, but
    could not crash it with these patches.

    UBIFS: prepare to fix a horrid bug
    
    commit 33f1a63ae84dfd9ad298cf275b8f1887043ced36 upstream.
    
    Al Viro pointed me to the fact that '->readdir()' and '->llseek()' have no
    mutual exclusion, which means the 'ubifs_dir_llseek()' can be run while we are
    in the middle of 'ubifs_readdir()'.
    
    First of all, this means that 'file->private_data' can be freed while
    'ubifs_readdir()' uses it.  But this particular patch does not fix the problem.
    This patch is only a preparation, and the fix will follow next.
    
    In this patch we make 'ubifs_readdir()' stop using 'file->f_pos' directly,
    because 'file->f_pos' can be changed by '->llseek()' at any point. This may
    lead 'ubifs_readdir()' to returning inconsistent data: directory entry names
    may correspond to incorrect file positions.
    
    So here we introduce a local variable 'pos', read 'file->f_pose' once at very
    the beginning, and then stick to 'pos'. The result of this is that when
    'ubifs_dir_llseek()' changes 'file->f_pos' while we are in the middle of
    'ubifs_readdir()', the latter "wins".

    The use of wait_for_completion_interruptible is intentional so that
    we don't lock up the thread if a bug causes us to never wake up.
    
    This bug is caused by the helper thread using the larval without
    holding a reference count on it.  If the helper thread completes
    after the original thread requesting for help has gone away and
    destroyed the larval, then we get the crash above.
    
    So the fix is to hold a reference count on the larval.

    perf: Disable monitoring on setuid processes for regular users
    
    commit 2976b10f05bd7f6dab9f9e7524451ddfed656a89 upstream.
    
    There was a a bug in setup_new_exec(), whereby
    the test to disabled perf monitoring was not
    correct because the new credentials for the
    process were not yet committed and therefore
    the get_dumpable() test was never firing.
    
    The patch fixes the problem by moving the
    perf_event test until after the credentials
    are committed.

    iommu/vt-d: add quirk for broken interrupt remapping on 55XX chipsets
    
    commit 03bbcb2e7e292838bb0244f5a7816d194c911d62 upstream.
    
    A few years back intel published a spec update:
    http://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/specification-update/5520-and-5500-chipset-ioh-specification-update.pdf
    
    For the 5520 and 5500 chipsets which contained an errata (specificially errata
    53), which noted that these chipsets can't properly do interrupt remapping, and
    as a result the recommend that interrupt remapping be disabled in bios.  While
    many vendors have a bios update to do exactly that, not all do, and of course
    not all users update their bios to a level that corrects the problem.  As a
    result, occasionally interrupts can arrive at a cpu even after affinity for that
    interrupt has be moved, leading to lost or spurrious interrupts (usually
    characterized by the message:
    kernel: do_IRQ: 7.71 No irq handler for vector (irq -1)
    
    There have been several incidents recently of people seeing this error, and
    investigation has shown that they have system for which their BIOS level is such
    that this feature was not properly turned off.  As such, it would be good to
    give them a reminder that their systems are vulnurable to this problem.  For
    details of those that reported the problem, please see:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=887006

    rt2800: fix RT5390 & RT3290 TX power settings regression
    
    commit 8c8d2017ba25c510ddf093419048460db1109bc4 upstream.
    
    My change:
    
    commit cee2c7315f60beeff6137ee59e99acc77d636eeb

        rt2800: use BBP_R1 for setting tx power
    
    unfortunately does not work well with RT5390 and RT3290 chips as they
    require different temperature compensation TX power settings (TSSI
    tuning). Since that commit make wireless connection very unstable on
    those chips, restore previous behavior to fix regression. Once we
    implement proper TSSI tuning on 5390/3290 we can restore back setting
    TX power by BBP_R1 register for those chips.

    commit c46b54f7406780ec4cf9c9124d1cfb777674dc70 upstream.
    
    All architectures must implement IRQ functions.  Since various
    dependencies on !S390 were removed, there are various drivers that can
    be selected but will fail to link.  Provide a dummy implementation of
    these functions for the !PCI case.

    iwlwifi: dvm: fix chain noise calibration
    
    commit b28b6dfe580ab1ab8bf08b908fd69e299b877103 upstream.
    
    First step of chain noise calibration process had disable flag
    check inverted. Chain noise calibration never started because
    of this.
    
    Tested on intel 5300 with two antennas attached. The driver
    correctly disabled one chain.

    hw_breakpoint: Use cpu_possible_mask in {reserve,release}_bp_slot()
    
    commit c790b0ad23f427c7522ffed264706238c57c007e upstream.
    
    fetch_bp_busy_slots() and toggle_bp_slot() use
    for_each_online_cpu(), this is obviously wrong wrt cpu_up() or
    cpu_down(), we can over/under account the per-cpu numbers.
    
    For example:
    
            # echo 0 >> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
            # perf record -e mem:0x10 -p 1 &
            # echo 1 >> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
            # perf record -e mem:0x10,mem:0x10,mem:0x10,mem:0x10 -C1 -a &
            # taskset -p 0x2 1
    
    triggers the same WARN_ONCE("Can't find any breakpoint slot") in
    arch_install_hw_breakpoint().

    hw_breakpoint: Fix cpu check in task_bp_pinned(cpu)
    
    commit 8b4d801b2b123b6c09742f861fe44a8527b84d47 upstream.
    
    trinity fuzzer triggered WARN_ONCE("Can't find any breakpoint
    slot") in arch_install_hw_breakpoint() but the problem is not
    arch-specific.
    
    The problem is, task_bp_pinned(cpu) checks "cpu == iter->cpu"
    but this doesn't account the "all cpus" events with iter->cpu <
    0.
    
    This means that, say, register_user_hw_breakpoint(tsk) can
    happily create the arbitrary number > HBP_NUM of breakpoints
    which can not be activated. toggle_bp_task_slot() is equally
    wrong by the same reason and nr_task_bp_pinned[] can have
    negative entries.
    
    Simple test:
    
            # perl -e 'sleep 1 while 1' &
            # perf record -e mem:0x10,mem:0x10,mem:0x10,mem:0x10,mem:0x10 -p `pidof perl`
    
    Before this patch this triggers the same problem/WARN_ON(),
    after the patch it correctly fails with -ENOSPC.

    Bluetooth: Fix invalid length check in l2cap_information_rsp()
    
    commit 3f6fa3d489e127ca5a5b298eabac3ff5dbe0e112 upstream.
    
    The length check is invalid since the length varies with type of

    This was introduced by the commit cb3b3152b2f5939d67005cff841a1ca748b19888
    
    Because of this, l2cap info rsp is not handled and command reject is sent.

    Bluetooth: Fix crash in l2cap_build_cmd() with small MTU
    
    commit 300b962e5244a1ea010df7e88595faa0085b461d upstream.
    
    If a too small MTU value is set with ioctl(HCISETACLMTU) or by a bogus
    controller, memory corruption happens due to a memcpy() call with
    negative length.
    
    Fix this crash on either incoming or outgoing connections with a MTU
    smaller than L2CAP_HDR_SIZE + L2CAP_CMD_HDR_SIZE:

    ARM: 7755/1: handle user space mapped pages in flush_kernel_dcache_page
    
    commit 1bc39742aab09248169ef9d3727c9def3528b3f3 upstream.
    
    Commit f8b63c1 made flush_kernel_dcache_page a no-op assuming that
    the pages it needs to handle are kernel mapped only.  However, for
    example when doing direct I/O, pages with user space mappings may
    occur.
    
    Thus, continue to do lazy flushing if there are no user space
    mappings.  Otherwise, flush the kernel cache lines directly.

    s390/ipl: Fix FCP WWPN and LUN format strings for read
    
    commit eda4ddf7e3a2245888e8c45c566fd514cdd5abbb upstream.
    
    The following git commit changed the behavior of sscanf:

        sscanf: don't ignore field widths for numeric conversions
    
    This broke the WWPN and LUN sysfs attributes for s390 reipl and dump
    on panic.
    
    Example:
    
    $ echo 0x0123456701234567 > /sys/firmware/reipl/fcp/wwpn
    $ cat /sys/firmware/reipl/fcp/wwpn
    0x0001234567012345
    
    So fix this and use format strings that work also with the
    new sscanf implementation:
    
    $ echo 0x012345670123456789 > /sys/firmware/reipl/fcp/wwpn
    $ cat /sys/firmware/reipl/fcp/wwpn
    0x0123456701234567
