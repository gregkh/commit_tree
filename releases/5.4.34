    scsi: target: fix hang when multiple threads try to destroy the same iscsi session
    
    [ Upstream commit 57c46e9f33da530a2485fa01aa27b6d18c28c796 ]
    
    A number of hangs have been reported against the target driver; they are
    due to the fact that multiple threads may try to destroy the iscsi session
    at the same time. This may be reproduced for example when a "targetcli
    iscsi/iqn.../tpg1 disable" command is executed while a logout operation is
    underway.
    
    When this happens, two or more threads may end up sleeping and waiting for
    iscsit_close_connection() to execute "complete(session_wait_comp)".  Only
    one of the threads will wake up and proceed to destroy the session
    structure, the remaining threads will hang forever.
    
    Note that if the blocked threads are somehow forced to wake up with
    complete_all(), they will try to free the same iscsi session structure
    destroyed by the first thread, causing double frees, memory corruptions
    etc...
    
    With this patch, the threads that want to destroy the iscsi session will
    increase the session refcount and will set the "session_close" flag to 1;
    then they wait for the driver to close the remaining active connections.
    When the last connection is closed, iscsit_close_connection() will wake up
    all the threads and will wait for the session's refcount to reach zero;
    when this happens, iscsit_close_connection() will destroy the session
    structure because no one is referencing it anymore.

    x86/resctrl: Fix invalid attempt at removing the default resource group
    
    commit b0151da52a6d4f3951ea24c083e7a95977621436 upstream.
    
    The default resource group ("rdtgroup_default") is associated with the
    root of the resctrl filesystem and should never be removed. New resource
    groups can be created as subdirectories of the resctrl filesystem and
    they can be removed from user space.
    
    There exists a safeguard in the directory removal code
    (rdtgroup_rmdir()) that ensures that only subdirectories can be removed
    by testing that the directory to be removed has to be a child of the
    root directory.
    
    A possible deadlock was recently fixed with
    
      334b0f4e9b1b ("x86/resctrl: Fix a deadlock due to inaccurate reference").
    
    This fix involved associating the private data of the "mon_groups"
    and "mon_data" directories to the resource group to which they belong
    instead of NULL as before. A consequence of this change was that
    the original safeguard code preventing removal of "mon_groups" and
    "mon_data" found in the root directory failed resulting in attempts to
    remove the default resource group that ends in a BUG:
    
      kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:3969!
      invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
    
      Call Trace:
      rdtgroup_rmdir+0x16b/0x2c0

      do_syscall_64+0x55/0x1d0
      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
    
    Fix this by improving the directory removal safeguard to ensure that
    subdirectories of the resctrl root directory can only be removed if they
    are a child of the resctrl filesystem's root _and_ not associated with
    the default resource group.

    x86/resctrl: Preserve CDP enable over CPU hotplug
    
    commit 9fe0450785abbc04b0ed5d3cf61fcdb8ab656b4b upstream.
    
    Resctrl assumes that all CPUs are online when the filesystem is mounted,
    and that CPUs remember their CDP-enabled state over CPU hotplug.
    
    This goes wrong when resctrl's CDP-enabled state changes while all the
    CPUs in a domain are offline.
    
    When a domain comes online, enable (or disable!) CDP to match resctrl's
    current setting.

    irqchip/ti-sci-inta: Fix processing of masked irqs
    
    commit 3688b0db5c331f4ec3fa5eb9f670a4b04f530700 upstream.
    
    The ti_sci_inta_irq_handler() does not take into account INTA IRQs state
    (masked/unmasked) as it uses INTA_STATUS_CLEAR_j register to get INTA IRQs
    status, which provides raw status value.
    This causes hard IRQ handlers to be called or threaded handlers to be
    scheduled many times even if corresponding INTA IRQ is masked.
    Above, first of all, affects the LEVEL interrupts processing and causes
    unexpected behavior up the system stack or crash.
    
    Fix it by using the Interrupt Masked Status INTA_STATUSM_j register which
    provides masked INTA IRQs status.

    ext4: do not zeroout extents beyond i_disksize
    
    commit 801674f34ecfed033b062a0f217506b93c8d5e8a upstream.
    
    We do not want to create initialized extents beyond end of file because
    for e2fsck it is impossible to distinguish them from a case of corrupted
    file size / extent tree and so it complains like:
    
    Inode 12, i_size is 147456, should be 163840.  Fix? no
    
    Code in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() and
    ext4_split_convert_extents() try to make sure it does not create
    initialized extents beyond inode size however they check against
    inode->i_size which is wrong. They should instead check against
    EXT4_I(inode)->i_disksize which is the current inode size on disk.
    That's what e2fsck is going to see in case of crash before all dirty
    data is written. This bug manifests as generic/456 test failure (with
    recent enough fstests where fsx got fixed to properly pass
    FALLOC_KEEP_SIZE_FL flags to the kernel) when run with dioread_lock
    mount option.

    i2c: designware: platdrv: Remove DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND flag on BYT and CHT
    
    commit d79294d0de12ddd1420110813626d691f440b86f upstream.
    
    We already set DPM_FLAG_SMART_PREPARE, so we completely skip all
    callbacks (other then prepare) where possible, quoting from
    dw_i2c_plat_prepare():
    
            /*
             * If the ACPI companion device object is present for this device, it
             * may be accessed during suspend and resume of other devices via I2C
             * operation regions, so tell the PM core and middle layers to avoid
             * skipping system suspend/resume callbacks for it in that case.
             */
            return !has_acpi_companion(dev);
    
    Also setting the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND will cause acpi_subsys_suspend()
    to leave the controller runtime-suspended even if dw_i2c_plat_prepare()
    returned 0.
    
    Leaving the controller runtime-suspended normally, when the I2C controller
    is suspended during the suspend_late phase, is not an issue because
    the pm_runtime_get_sync() done by i2c_dw_xfer() will (runtime-)resume it.
    
    But for dw I2C controllers on Bay- and Cherry-Trail devices acpi_lpss.c
    leaves the controller alive until the suspend_noirq phase, because it may
    be used by the _PS3 ACPI methods of PCI devices and PCI devices are left
    powered on until the suspend_noirq phase.
    
    Between the suspend_late and resume_early phases runtime-pm is disabled.
    So for any ACPI I2C OPRegion accesses done after the suspend_late phase,
    the pm_runtime_get_sync() done by i2c_dw_xfer() is a no-op and the
    controller is left runtime-suspended.
    
    i2c_dw_xfer() has a check to catch this condition (rather then waiting
    for the I2C transfer to timeout because the controller is suspended).
    acpi_subsys_suspend() leaving the controller runtime-suspended in
    combination with an ACPI I2C OPRegion access done after the suspend_late
    phase triggers this check, leading to the following error being logged
    on a Bay Trail based Lenovo Thinkpad 8 tablet:
    
    [   93.275882] i2c_designware 80860F41:00: Transfer while suspended

    ...
    
    So since on BYT and CHT platforms we want ACPI I2c OPRegion accesses
    to work until the suspend_noirq phase, we need the controller to be
    runtime-resumed during the suspend phase if it is runtime-suspended
    suspended at that time. This means that we must not set the
    DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND on these platforms.
    
    On BYT and CHT we already have a special ACCESS_NO_IRQ_SUSPEND flag
    to make sure the controller stays functional until the suspend_noirq
    phase. This commit makes the driver not set the DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND
    flag when that flag is set.

    net/mlx5e: Use preactivate hook to set the indirection table
    
    [ Upstream commit fe867cac9e1967c553e4ac2aece5fc8675258010 ]
    
    mlx5e_ethtool_set_channels updates the indirection table before
    switching to the new channels. If the switch fails, the indirection
    table is new, but the channels are old, which is wrong. Fix it by using
    the preactivate hook of mlx5e_safe_switch_channels to update the
    indirection table at the stage when nothing can fail anymore.
    
    As the code that updates the indirection table is now encapsulated into
    a new function, use that function in the attach flow when the driver has
    to reduce the number of channels, and prepare the code for the next
    commit.

    net/mlx5e: Rename hw_modify to preactivate
    
    [ Upstream commit dca147b3dce5abb5284ff747211960fd2db5ec2e ]
    
    mlx5e_safe_switch_channels accepts a callback to be called before

    configuration has changed.
    
    Recently, this callback has started being used to update the driver's
    internal MLX5E_STATE_XDP_OPEN flag, and the following patches also
    intend to use this callback for software preparations. This patch
    renames the hw_modify callback to preactivate, so that the name fits

    mac80211_hwsim: Use kstrndup() in place of kasprintf()
    
    commit 7ea862048317aa76d0f22334202779a25530980c upstream.
    
    syzbot reports a warning:
    
    precision 33020 too large
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9618 at lib/vsprintf.c:2471 set_precision+0x150/0x180 lib/vsprintf.c:2471

    Thus it seems that kasprintf() with "%.*s" format can not be used for
    duplicating a string with arbitrary length. Replace it with kstrndup().
    
    Note that later this string is limited to NL80211_WIPHY_NAME_MAXLEN == 64,
    but the code is simpler this way.

    mac80211: fix race in ieee80211_register_hw()
    
    commit 52e04b4ce5d03775b6a78f3ed1097480faacc9fd upstream.
    
    A race condition leading to a kernel crash is observed during invocation
    of ieee80211_register_hw() on a dragonboard410c device having wcn36xx
    driver built as a loadable module along with a wifi manager in user-space
    waiting for a wifi device (wlanX) to be active.
    
    Sequence diagram for a particular kernel crash scenario:
    
        user-space  ieee80211_register_hw()  ieee80211_tasklet_handler()
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

           |              Kernel crash            |

           |              workqueue.              |
           |                    |                 |

           |              Misc wiphy init.        |

           |                    |                 |
    
    As evident from above sequence diagram, this race condition isn't specific
    to a particular wifi driver but rather the initialization sequence in
    ieee80211_register_hw() needs to be fixed. So re-order the initialization
    sequence and the updated sequence diagram would look like:
    
        user-space  ieee80211_register_hw()  ieee80211_tasklet_handler()

    btrfs: check commit root generation in should_ignore_root
    
    commit 4d4225fc228e46948486d8b8207955f0c031b92e upstream.
    
    Previously we would set the reloc root's last snapshot to transid - 1.
    However there was a problem with doing this, and we changed it to
    setting the last snapshot to the generation of the commit node of the fs
    root.
    
    This however broke should_ignore_root().  The assumption is that if we
    are in a generation newer than when the reloc root was created, then we
    would find the reloc root through normal backref lookups, and thus can
    ignore any fs roots we find with an old enough reloc root.
    
    Now that the last snapshot could be considerably further in the past
    than before, we'd end up incorrectly ignoring an fs root.  Thus we'd
    find no nodes for the bytenr we were searching for, and we'd fail to
    relocate anything.  We'd loop through the relocate code again and see
    that there were still used space in that block group, attempt to
    relocate those bytenr's again, fail in the same way, and just loop like
    this forever.  This is tricky in that we have to not modify the fs root
    at all during this time, so we need to have a block group that has data
    in this fs root that is not shared by any other root, which is why this
    has been difficult to reproduce.

    tracing: Fix the race between registering 'snapshot' event trigger and triggering 'snapshot' operation
    
    commit 0bbe7f719985efd9adb3454679ecef0984cb6800 upstream.
    
    Traced event can trigger 'snapshot' operation(i.e. calls snapshot_trigger()
    or snapshot_count_trigger()) when register_snapshot_trigger() has completed
    registration but doesn't allocate buffer for 'snapshot' event trigger.  In
    the rare case, 'snapshot' operation always detects the lack of allocated
    buffer so make register_snapshot_trigger() allocate buffer first.
    
    trigger-snapshot.tc in kselftest reproduces the issue on slow vm:

    keys: Fix proc_keys_next to increase position index
    
    commit 86d32f9a7c54ad74f4514d7fef7c847883207291 upstream.
    
    If seq_file .next function does not change position index,
    read after some lseek can generate unexpected output:
    
        $ dd if=/proc/keys bs=1  # full usual output
        0f6bfdf5 I--Q---     2 perm 3f010000  1000  1000 user      4af2f79ab8848d0a: 740

    But a read after lseek in middle of last line results in the partial
    last line and then a repeat of the final line:
    
        $ dd if=/proc/keys bs=500 skip=1
        dd: /proc/keys: cannot skip to specified offset
        g   _uid_ses.1000: 1

    arm64: vdso: don't free unallocated pages
    
    commit 9cc3d0c6915aee5140f8335d41bbc3ff1b79aa4e upstream.
    
    The aarch32_vdso_pages[] array never has entries allocated in the C_VVAR
    or C_VDSO slots, and as the array is zero initialized these contain
    NULL.
    
    However in __aarch32_alloc_vdso_pages() when
    aarch32_alloc_kuser_vdso_page() fails we attempt to free the page whose
    struct page is at NULL, which is obviously nonsensical.
    
    This patch removes the erroneous page freeing.

    commit 3507245b82b4362dc9721cbc328644905a3efa22 upstream.
    
    The mapping table may contain also ignore_ctl_error flag for devices
    that are known to behave wild.  Since this flag always writes the
    card's own ignore_ctl_error flag, it overrides the value already set
    by the module option, so it doesn't follow user's expectation.
    Let's fix the code not to clear the flag that has been set by user.

    commit 48cc42973509afac24e83d6edc23901d102872d1 upstream.
    
    The ignore_ctl_error option should filter the error at kctl accesses,
    but there was an overlook: mixer_ctl_connector_get() returns an error
    from the request.
    
    This patch covers the forgotten code path and apply filter_error()
    properly.  The locking error is still returned since this is a fatal
    error that has to be reported even with ignore_ctl_error option.

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Enable the headset mic on Asus FX505DT
    
    commit 4963d66b8a26c489958063abb6900ea6ed8e4836 upstream.
    
    On Asus FX505DT with Realtek ALC233, the headset mic is connected
    to pin 0x19, with default 0x411111f0.
    
    Enable headset mic by reconfiguring the pin to an external mic
    associated with the headphone on 0x21. Mic jack detection was also
    found to be working.

    ASoC: Intel: mrfld: return error codes when an error occurs
    
    commit 3025571edd9df653e1ad649f0638368a39d1bbb5 upstream.
    
    Currently function sst_platform_get_resources always returns zero and
    error return codes set by the function are never returned. Fix this
    by returning the error return code in variable ret rather than the
    hard coded zero.

    pwm: pca9685: Fix PWM/GPIO inter-operation
    
    commit 9cc5f232a4b6a0ef6e9b57876d61b88f61bdd7c2 upstream.
    
    This driver allows pwms to be requested as gpios via gpiolib. Obviously,
    it should not be allowed to request a GPIO when its corresponding PWM is
    already requested (and vice versa). So it requires some exclusion code.
    
    Given that the PWMm and GPIO cores are not synchronized with respect to
    each other, this exclusion code will also require proper
    synchronization.
    
    Such a mechanism was in place, but was inadvertently removed by Uwe's
    clean-up in commit e926b12c611c ("pwm: Clear chip_data in pwm_put()").
    
    Upon revisiting the synchronization mechanism, we found that
    theoretically, it could allow two threads to successfully request
    conflicting PWMs/GPIOs.
    
    Replace with a bitmap which tracks PWMs in-use, plus a mutex. As long as
    PWM and GPIO's respective request/free functions modify the in-use
    bitmap while holding the mutex, proper synchronization will be
    guaranteed.

    perf report: Fix no branch type statistics report issue
    
    commit c3b10649a80e9da2892c1fd3038c53abd57588f6 upstream.
    
    Previously we could get the report of branch type statistics.
    
    For example:
    
      # perf record -j any,save_type ...
      # t perf report --stdio
    
      #
      # Branch Statistics:
      #
      COND_FWD:  40.6%
      COND_BWD:   4.1%
      CROSS_4K:  24.7%
      CROSS_2M:  12.3%
          COND:  44.7%
        UNCOND:   0.0%
           IND:   6.1%
          CALL:  24.5%
           RET:  24.7%
    
    But now for the recent perf, it can't report the branch type statistics.
    
    It's a regression issue caused by commit 40c39e304641 ("perf report: Fix
    a no annotate browser displayed issue"), which only counts the branch
    type statistics for browser mode.
    
    This patch moves the branch_type_count() outside of ui__has_annotation()
    checking, then branch type statistics can work for stdio mode.

    acpi/nfit: improve bounds checking for 'func'
    
    commit 01091c496f920e634ea84b689f480c39016752a8 upstream.
    
    The 'func' variable can come from the user in the __nd_ioctl().  If it's
    too high then the (1 << func) shift in acpi_nfit_clear_to_send() is
    undefined.  In acpi_nfit_ctl() we pass 'func' to test_bit(func, &dsm_mask)
    which could result in an out of bounds access.
    
    To fix these issues, I introduced the NVDIMM_CMD_MAX (31) define and
    updated nfit_dsm_revid() to use that define as well instead of magic
    numbers.

    commit f775ac78fcfc6bdc96bdda07029d11f2a5e84869 upstream.
    
    Host event can be sent by remoteproc by any time, and
    cros_ec_rpmsg_callback would be called after cros_ec_rpmsg_create_ept.
    But the cros_ec_device is initialized after that, which cause host event
    handler to use cros_ec_device that are not initialized properly yet.
    
    Fix this by don't schedule host event handler before cros_ec_register
    returns. Instead, remember that we have a pending host event, and
    schedule host event handler after cros_ec_register.

    Specifically, it also relaxed the pre-condition that index=on for
    consistent i_ino. This opened the corner case of lower hardlink in
    ovl_get_inode(), which calls ovl_fill_inode() with ino=0 and then
    ovl_init_inode() is called to set i_ino to lower real ino without the xino
    mapping.
    
    Pass the correct values of ino;fsid in this case to ovl_fill_inode(), so it
    can initialize i_ino correctly.

    net: stmmac: dwmac-sunxi: Provide TX and RX fifo sizes
    
    [ Upstream commit 806fd188ce2a4f8b587e83e73c478e6484fbfa55 ]
    
    After commit bfcb813203e619a8960a819bf533ad2a108d8105 ("net: dsa:
    configure the MTU for switch ports") my Lamobo R1 platform which uses
    an allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac compatible Ethernet MAC started to fail
    by rejecting a MTU of 1536. The reason for that is that the DMA
    capabilities are not readable on this version of the IP, and there
    is also no 'tx-fifo-depth' property being provided in Device Tree. The
    property is documented as optional, and is not provided.
    
    Chen-Yu indicated that the FIFO sizes are 4KB for TX and 16KB for RX, so
    provide these values through platform data as an immediate fix until
    various Device Tree sources get updated accordingly.

    [ Upstream commit 70f478ca085deec4d6c1f187f773f5827ddce7e8 ]
    
    Current value of nest_level, assigned from net_device lower_level value,
    does not reflect the actual number of vlan headers, needed to pop.
    For ex., if we have untagged ingress traffic sended over vlan devices,
    instead of one pop action, driver will perform two pop actions.
    To fix that, calculate nest_level as difference between vlan device and

    net: ipv6: do not consider routes via gateways for anycast address check
    
    [ Upstream commit 03e2a984b6165621f287fadf5f4b5cd8b58dcaba ]
    
    The behaviour for what is considered an anycast address changed in
    commit 45e4fd26683c ("ipv6: Only create RTF_CACHE routes after
    encountering pmtu exception"). This now considers the first
    address in a subnet where there is a route via a gateway
    to be an anycast address.
    
    This breaks path MTU discovery and traceroutes when a host in a
    remote network uses the address at the start of a prefix
    (eg 2600:: advertised as 2600::/48 in the DFZ) as ICMP errors
    will not be sent to anycast addresses.
    
    This patch excludes any routes with a gateway, or via point to
    point links, like the behaviour previously from
    rt6_is_gw_or_nonexthop in net/ipv6/route.c.
    
    This can be tested with:
    ip link add v1 type veth peer name v2
    ip netns add test
    ip netns exec test ip link set lo up
    ip link set v2 netns test
    ip link set v1 up
    ip netns exec test ip link set v2 up
    ip addr add 2001:db8::1/64 dev v1 nodad
    ip addr add 2001:db8:100:: dev lo nodad
    ip netns exec test ip addr add 2001:db8::2/64 dev v2 nodad
    ip netns exec test ip route add unreachable 2001:db8:1::1
    ip netns exec test ip route add 2001:db8:100::/64 via 2001:db8::1
    ip netns exec test sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
    ip route add 2001:db8:1::1 via 2001:db8::2
    ping -I 2001:db8::1 2001:db8:1::1 -c1
    ping -I 2001:db8:100:: 2001:db8:1::1 -c1
    ip addr delete 2001:db8:100:: dev lo
    ip netns delete test
    
    Currently the first ping will get back a destination unreachable ICMP
    error, but the second will never get a response, with "icmp6_send:
    acast source" logged. After this patch, both get destination
    unreachable ICMP replies.

    l2tp: Allow management of tunnels and session in user namespace
    
    [ Upstream commit 2abe05234f2e892728c388169631e4b99f354c86 ]
    
    Creation and management of L2TPv3 tunnels and session through netlink
    requires CAP_NET_ADMIN. However, a process with CAP_NET_ADMIN in a
    non-initial user namespace gets an EPERM due to the use of the
    genetlink GENL_ADMIN_PERM flag. Thus, management of L2TP VPNs inside
    an unprivileged container won't work.
    
    We replaced the GENL_ADMIN_PERM by the GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM flag
    similar to other network modules which also had this problem, e.g.,
    openvswitch (commit 4a92602aa1cd "openvswitch: allow management from
    inside user namespaces") and nl80211 (commit 5617c6cd6f844 "nl80211:
    Allow privileged operations from user namespaces").
    
    I tested this in the container runtime trustm3 (trustm3.github.io)
    and was able to create l2tp tunnels and sessions in unpriviliged
    (user namespaced) containers using a private network namespace.
    For other runtimes such as docker or lxc this should work, too.

    hsr: check protocol version in hsr_newlink()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4faab8c446def7667adf1f722456c2f4c304069c ]
    
    In the current hsr code, only 0 and 1 protocol versions are valid.
    But current hsr code doesn't check the version, which is received by
    userspace.
    
    Test commands:
        ip link add dummy0 type dummy
        ip link add dummy1 type dummy
        ip link add hsr0 type hsr slave1 dummy0 slave2 dummy1 version 4
    
    In the test commands, version 4 is invalid.
    So, the command should be failed.
    
    After this patch, following error will occur.
    "Error: hsr: Only versions 0..1 are supported."

    amd-xgbe: Use __napi_schedule() in BH context
    
    [ Upstream commit d518691cbd3be3dae218e05cca3f3fc9b2f1aa77 ]
    
    The driver uses __napi_schedule_irqoff() which is fine as long as it is
    invoked with disabled interrupts by everybody. Since the commit
    mentioned below the driver may invoke xgbe_isr_task() in tasklet/softirq
    context. This may lead to list corruption if another driver uses
    __napi_schedule_irqoff() in IRQ context.
    
    Use __napi_schedule() which safe to use from IRQ and softirq context.
