    doc: gcc-plugins: update gcc-plugins.rst
    
    commit 9b6164342e981d751e69f5a165dd596ffcdfd6fe upstream.
    
    This document was written a long time ago. Update it.
    
    [1] Drop the version information
    
    The range of the supported GCC versions are always changing. The
    current minimal GCC version is 4.9, and commit 1e860048c53e
    ("gcc-plugins: simplify GCC plugin-dev capability test") removed the
    old code accordingly.
    
    We do not need to mention specific version ranges like "all gcc versions
    from 4.5 to 6.0" since we forget to update the documentation when we
    raise the minimal compiler version.
    
    [2] Drop the C compiler statements
    
    Since commit 77342a02ff6e ("gcc-plugins: drop support for GCC <= 4.7")
    the GCC plugin infrastructure only supports g++.
    
    [3] Drop supported architectures
    
    As of v5.11-rc4, the infrastructure supports more architectures;
    arm, arm64, mips, powerpc, riscv, s390, um, and x86. (just grep
    "select HAVE_GCC_PLUGINS") Again, we miss to update this document when a
    new architecture is supported. Let's just say "only some architectures".
    
    [4] Update the apt-get example
    
    We are now discussing to bump the minimal version to GCC 5. The GCC 4.9
    support will be removed sooner or later. Change the package example to
    gcc-10-plugin-dev while we are here.
    
    [5] Update the build target
    
    Since commit ce2fd53a10c7 ("kbuild: descend into scripts/gcc-plugins/
    via scripts/Makefile"), "make gcc-plugins" is not supported.
    "make scripts" builds all the enabled plugins, including some other
    tools.
    
    [6] Update the steps for adding a new plugin
    
    At first, all CONFIG options for GCC plugins were located in arch/Kconfig.
    After commit 45332b1bdfdc ("gcc-plugins: split out Kconfig entries to
    scripts/gcc-plugins/Kconfig"), scripts/gcc-plugins/Kconfig became the
    central place to collect plugin CONFIG options. In my understanding,
    this requirement no longer exists because commit 9f671e58159a ("security:
    Create "kernel hardening" config area") moved some of plugin CONFIG
    options to another file. Find an appropriate place to add the new CONFIG.
    
    The sub-directory support was never used by anyone, and removed by
    commit c17d6179ad5a ("gcc-plugins: remove unused GCC_PLUGIN_SUBDIR").
    
    Remove the useless $(src)/ prefix.

    bpf: Add selftests to cover packet access corner cases
    
    commit b560b21f71eb4ef9dfc7c8ec1d0e4d7f9aa54b51 upstream.
    
    This commit adds BPF verifier selftests that cover all corner cases by
    packet boundary checks. Specifically, 8-byte packet reads are tested at
    the beginning of data and at the beginning of data_meta, using all kinds
    of boundary checks (all comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=; both
    permutations of operands: data + length compared to end, end compared to
    data + length). For each case there are three tests:
    
    1. Length is just enough for an 8-byte read. Length is either 7 or 8,
       depending on the comparison.
    
    2. Length is increased by 1 - should still pass the verifier. These
       cases are useful, because they failed before commit 2fa7d94afc1a
       ("bpf: Fix the off-by-two error in range markings").
    
    3. Length is decreased by 1 - should be rejected by the verifier.
    
    Some existing tests are just renamed to avoid duplication.

    commit 6661146427cbbce6d1fe3dbb11ff1c487f55799a upstream.
    
    IIO trigger handlers must call iio_trigger_notify_done() when done. This

    iio_trigger_notify_done() is included in the error exit path.

    iio: adc: stm32: fix a current leak by resetting pcsel before disabling vdda
    
    commit f711f28e71e965c0d1141c830fa7131b41abbe75 upstream.
    
    Some I/Os are connected to ADC input channels, when the corresponding bit
    in PCSEL register are set on STM32H7 and STM32MP15. This is done in the
    prepare routine of stm32-adc driver.
    There are constraints here, as PCSEL shouldn't be set when VDDA supply
    is disabled. Enabling/disabling of VDDA supply in done via stm32-adc-core
    runtime PM routines (before/after ADC is enabled/disabled).
    
    Currently, PCSEL remains set when disabling ADC. Later on, PM runtime
    can disable the VDDA supply. This creates some conditions on I/Os that
    can start to leak current.
    So PCSEL needs to be cleared when disabling the ADC.

    commit 652e7df485c6884d552085ae2c73efa6cfea3547 upstream.
    
    Use scan_type when processing raw data which also fixes that the sign
    extension was from the wrong bit.
    
    Use channel definition as root of trust and replace constant
    when reading elements directly using the raw sysfs attributes.

    iio: itg3200: Call iio_trigger_notify_done() on error
    
    commit 67fe29583e72b2103abb661bb58036e3c1f00277 upstream.
    
    IIO trigger handlers must call iio_trigger_notify_done() when done. This
    must be done even when an error occurred. Otherwise the trigger will be
    seen as busy indefinitely and the trigger handler will never be called
    again.
    
    The itg3200 driver neglects to call iio_trigger_notify_done() when there is
    an error reading the gyro data. Fix this by making sure that
    iio_trigger_notify_done() is included in the error exit path.

    iio: kxsd9: Don't return error code in trigger handler
    
    commit 45febe0d63917ee908198c5be08511c64ee1790a upstream.
    
    IIO trigger handlers need to return one of the irqreturn_t values.
    Returning an error code is not supported.
    
    The kxsd9 interrupt handler returns an error code if reading the data
    registers fails. In addition when exiting due to an error the trigger
    handler does not call `iio_trigger_notify_done()`. Which when not done
    keeps the triggered disabled forever.
    
    Modify the code so that the function returns a valid irqreturn_t value as
    well as calling `iio_trigger_notify_done()` on all exit paths.
    
    Since we can't return the error code make sure to at least log it as part
    of the error message.

    iio: mma8452: Fix trigger reference couting
    
    commit cd0082235783f814241a1c9483fb89e405f4f892 upstream.
    
    The mma8452 driver directly assigns a trigger to the struct iio_dev. The
    IIO core when done using this trigger will call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop
    the reference count by 1.
    
    Without the matching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference count
    can reach 0 too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a
    use-after-free occurs.
    
    Fix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning it to the
    IIO device.

    iio: trigger: Fix reference counting
    
    commit a827a4984664308f13599a0b26c77018176d0c7c upstream.
    
    In viio_trigger_alloc() device_initialize() is used to set the initial
    reference count of the trigger to 1. Then another get_device() is called on
    trigger. This sets the reference count to 2 before the trigger is returned.
    
    iio_trigger_free(), which is the matching API to viio_trigger_alloc(),
    calls put_device() which decreases the reference count by 1. But the second
    reference count acquired in viio_trigger_alloc() is never dropped.
    
    As a result the iio_trigger_release() function is never called and the
    memory associated with the trigger is never freed.
    
    Since there is no reason for the trigger to start its lifetime with two
    reference counts just remove the extra get_device() in
    viio_trigger_alloc().

    xhci: avoid race between disable slot command and host runtime suspend
    
    commit 7faac1953ed1f658f719cdf7bb7303fa5eef822c upstream.
    
    Make xhci_disable_slot() synchronous, thus ensuring it, and
    xhci_free_dev() calling it return after xHC controller completes
    the disable slot command.
    
    Otherwise the roothub and xHC host may runtime suspend, and clear the
    command ring while the disable slot command is being processed.
    
    This causes a command completion mismatch as the completion event can't
    be mapped to the correct command.
    Command ring gets out of sync and commands time out.
    Driver finally assumes host is unresponsive and bails out.

    xhci: Remove CONFIG_USB_DEFAULT_PERSIST to prevent xHCI from runtime suspending
    
    commit 811ae81320da53a5670c36970cefacca8519f90e upstream.
    
    When the xHCI is quirked with XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME, runtime resume
    routine also resets the controller.
    
    This is bad for USB drivers without reset_resume callback, because
    there's no subsequent call of usb_dev_complete() ->
    usb_resume_complete() to force rebinding the driver to the device. For
    instance, btusb device stops working after xHCI controller is runtime
    resumed, if the controlled is quirked with XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME.
    
    So always take XHCI_RESET_ON_RESUME into account to solve the issue.

    For example, suppose ping is using a SOCK_RAW socket for ICMP messages.
    When receiving ping replies, in __raw_v4_lookup(), sk->sk_bound_dev_if
    is 3 (dummy1), but dif (skb_rtable(skb)->rt_iif) says 2 (dummy0), so the
    raw_sk_bound_dev_eq() check fails.  Similar things happen in
    ping_lookup() for SOCK_DGRAM sockets.
    
    These tests used to pass due to a bug [1] in iputils, where "ping -I"
    actually did not bind ICMP message sockets to device.  The bug has been
    fixed by iputils commit f455fee41c07 ("ping: also bind the ICMP socket
    to the specific device") in 2016, which is why our rp_filter tests
    started to fail.  See [2] .
    
    Fixing the tests while keeping everything in one netns turns out to be
    nontrivial.  Rework the tests and build the following topology:
    
     ┌─────────────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
     │  network namespace 1 (ns1)  │    │  network namespace 2 (ns2)  │
     │                             │    │                             │
     │  ┌────┐     ┌─────┐         │    │  ┌─────┐            ┌────┐  │
     │  │ lo │<───>│veth1│<────────┼────┼─>│veth2│<──────────>│ lo │  │
     │  └────┘     ├─────┴──────┐  │    │  ├─────┴──────┐     └────┘  │

     │             └────────────┘  │    │  └────────────┘             │
     └─────────────────────────────┘    └─────────────────────────────┘
    
    Consider sending an ICMP_ECHO packet A in ns2.  Both source and
    destination IP addresses are 192.0.2.1, and we use strict mode rp_filter
    in both ns1 and ns2:
    
      1. A is routed to lo since its destination IP address is one of ns2's
         local addresses (veth2);
      2. A is redirected from lo's egress to veth2's egress using mirred;
      3. A arrives at veth1's ingress in ns1;
      4. A is redirected from veth1's ingress to lo's ingress, again, using
         mirred;
      5. In __fib_validate_source(), fib_info_nh_uses_dev() returns false,
         since A was received on lo, but reverse path lookup says veth1;
      6. However A is not dropped since we have relaxed this check for lo in
         commit 66f8209547cc ("fib: relax source validation check for loopback
         packets");
    
    Making sure A is not dropped here in this corner case is the whole point
    of having this test.
    
      7. As A reaches the ICMP layer, an ICMP_ECHOREPLY packet, B, is
         generated;
      8. Similarly, B is redirected from lo's egress to veth1's egress (in
         ns1), then redirected once again from veth2's ingress to lo's
         ingress (in ns2), using mirred.
    
    Also test "ping 127.0.0.1" from ns2.  It does not trigger the relaxed
    check in __fib_validate_source(), but just to make sure the topology
    works with loopback addresses.

    net/qla3xxx: fix an error code in ql_adapter_up()
    
    commit d17b9737c2bc09b4ac6caf469826e5a7ce3ffab7 upstream.
    
    The ql_wait_for_drvr_lock() fails and returns false, then this
    function should return an error code instead of returning success.
    
    The other problem is that the success path prints an error message
    netdev_err(ndev, "Releasing driver lock\n");  Delete that and
    re-order the code a little to make it more clear.

    net, neigh: clear whole pneigh_entry at alloc time
    
    commit e195e9b5dee6459d8c8e6a314cc71a644a0537fd upstream.
    
    Commit 2c611ad97a82 ("net, neigh: Extend neigh->flags to 32 bit
    to allow for extensions") enables a new KMSAM warning [1]
    
    I think the bug is actually older, because the following intruction
    only occurred if ndm->ndm_flags had NTF_PROXY set.
    
            pn->flags = ndm->ndm_flags;
    
    Let's clear all pneigh_entry fields at alloc time.

    net: fec: only clear interrupt of handling queue in fec_enet_rx_queue()
    
    commit b5bd95d17102b6719e3531d627875b9690371383 upstream.
    
    Background:
    We have a customer is running a Profinet stack on the 8MM which receives and
    responds PNIO packets every 4ms and PNIO-CM packets every 40ms. However, from
    time to time the received PNIO-CM package is "stock" and is only handled when
    receiving a new PNIO-CM or DCERPC-Ping packet (tcpdump shows the PNIO-CM and
    the DCERPC-Ping packet at the same time but the PNIO-CM HW timestamp is from
    the expected 40 ms and not the 2s delay of the DCERPC-Ping).
    
    After debugging, we noticed PNIO, PNIO-CM and DCERPC-Ping packets would
    be handled by different RX queues.
    
    The root cause should be driver ack all queues' interrupt when handle a
    specific queue in fec_enet_rx_queue(). The blamed patch is introduced to
    receive as much packets as possible once to avoid interrupt flooding.
    But it's unreasonable to clear other queues'interrupt when handling one
    queue, this patch tries to fix it.

    net: cdc_ncm: Allow for dwNtbOutMaxSize to be unset or zero
    
    commit 2be6d4d16a0849455a5c22490e3c5983495fed00 upstream.
    
    Currently, due to the sequential use of min_t() and clamp_t() macros,
    in cdc_ncm_check_tx_max(), if dwNtbOutMaxSize is not set, the logic
    sets tx_max to 0.  This is then used to allocate the data area of the
    SKB requested later in cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame().
    
    This does not cause an issue presently because when memory is
    allocated during initialisation phase of SKB creation, more memory
    (512b) is allocated than is required for the SKB headers alone (320b),
    leaving some space (512b - 320b = 192b) for CDC data (172b).
    
    However, if more elements (for example 3 x u64 = [24b]) were added to
    one of the SKB header structs, say 'struct skb_shared_info',
    increasing its original size (320b [320b aligned]) to something larger
    (344b [384b aligned]), then suddenly the CDC data (172b) no longer
    fits in the spare SKB data area (512b - 384b = 128b).
    
    Consequently the SKB bounds checking semantics fails and panics:
    
      skbuff: skb_over_panic: text:ffffffff830a5b5f len:184 put:172   \
         head:ffff888119227c00 data:ffff888119227c00 tail:0xb8 end:0x80 dev:<NULL>

    tools build: Remove needless libpython-version feature check that breaks test-all fast path
    
    commit 3d1d57debee2d342a47615707588b96658fabb85 upstream.
    
    Since 66dfdff03d196e51 ("perf tools: Add Python 3 support") we don't use
    the tools/build/feature/test-libpython-version.c version in any Makefile
    feature check:
    
      $ find tools/ -type f | xargs grep feature-libpython-version
      $
    
    The only place where this was used was removed in 66dfdff03d196e51:
    
      -        ifneq ($(feature-libpython-version), 1)
      -          $(warning Python 3 is not yet supported; please set)
      -          $(warning PYTHON and/or PYTHON_CONFIG appropriately.)
      -          $(warning If you also have Python 2 installed, then)
      -          $(warning try something like:)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(warning $(and ,)  make PYTHON=python2)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(warning Otherwise, disable Python support entirely:)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(warning $(and ,)  make NO_LIBPYTHON=1)
      -          $(warning $(and ,))
      -          $(error   $(and ,))
      -        else
      -          LDFLAGS += $(PYTHON_EMBED_LDFLAGS)
      -          EXTLIBS += $(PYTHON_EMBED_LIBADD)
      -          LANG_BINDINGS += $(obj-perf)python/perf.so
      -          $(call detected,CONFIG_LIBPYTHON)
      -        endif
    
    And nowadays we either build with PYTHON=python3 or just install the
    python3 devel packages and perf will build against it.
    
    But the leftover feature-libpython-version check made the fast path
    feature detection to break in all cases except when python2 devel files
    were installed:
    
      $ rpm -qa | grep python.*devel
      python3-devel-3.9.7-1.fc34.x86_64
      $ rm -rf /tmp/build/perf ; mkdir -p /tmp/build/perf ;
      $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf install-bin
      make: Entering directory '/var/home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf'
        BUILD:   Doing 'make -j32' parallel build
        HOSTCC  /tmp/build/perf/fixdep.o
      <SNIP>
      $ cat /tmp/build/perf/feature/test-all.make.output
      In file included from test-all.c:18:
      test-libpython-version.c:5:10: error: #error

            libpython3.9.so.1.0 => /lib64/libpython3.9.so.1.0 (0x00007fda6dbcf000)
      $
    
    As python3 is the norm these days, fix this by just removing the unused
    feature-libpython-version feature check, making the test-all fast path
    to work with the common case.
    
    With this:
    
      $ rm -rf /tmp/build/perf ; mkdir -p /tmp/build/perf ;
      $ make -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf install-bin |& head

    dt-bindings: net: Reintroduce PHY no lane swap binding
    
    commit 96db48c9d777a73a33b1d516c5cfed7a417a5f40 upstream.
    
    This binding was already documented in phy.txt, commit 252ae5330daa
    ("Documentation: devicetree: Add PHY no lane swap binding"), but got
    accidently removed during YAML conversion in commit d8704342c109
    ("dt-bindings: net: Add a YAML schemas for the generic PHY options").
    
    Note: 'enet-phy-lane-no-swap' and the absence of 'enet-phy-lane-swap' are
    not identical, as the former one disable this feature, while the latter
    one doesn't change anything.

    Documentation/locking/locktypes: Update migrate_disable() bits.
    
    commit 6a631c0432dcccbcf45839016a07c015e335e9ae upstream.
    
    The initial implementation of migrate_disable() for mainline was a
    wrapper around preempt_disable(). RT kernels substituted this with
    a real migrate disable implementation.
    
    Later on mainline gained true migrate disable support, but the
    documentation was not updated.
    
    Update the documentation, remove the claims about migrate_disable()
    mapping to preempt_disable() on non-PREEMPT_RT kernels.

    Revert "PCI: aardvark: Fix support for PCI_ROM_ADDRESS1 on emulated bridge"
    
    commit 39bd54d43b3f8b3c7b3a75f5d868d8bb858860e7 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 239edf686c14a9ff926dec2f350289ed7adfefe2.
    
    239edf686c14 ("PCI: aardvark: Fix support for PCI_ROM_ADDRESS1 on emulated
    bridge") added support for the Type 1 Expansion ROM BAR at config offset
    0x38, based on the register being listed in the Marvell Armada A3720 spec.
    But the spec doesn't document it at all for RC mode, and there is no ROM in
    the SOC, so remove this emulation for now.
    
    The PCI bridge which represents aardvark's PCIe Root Port has an Expansion
    ROM Base Address register at offset 0x30, but its meaning is different than
    PCI's Expansion ROM BAR register, although the layout is the same.  (This
    is why we thought it does the same thing.)
    
    First: there is no ROM (or part of BootROM) in the A3720 SOC dedicated for
    PCIe Root Port (or controller in RC mode) containing executable code that
    would initialize the Root Port, suitable for execution in bootloader (this
    is how Expansion ROM BAR is used on x86).
    
    Second: in A3720 spec the register (address 0xD0070030) is not documented
    at all for Root Complex mode, but similar to other BAR registers, it has an
    "entangled partner" in register 0xD0075920, which does address translation
    for the BAR in 0xD0070030:
    
      - the BAR register sets the address from the view of PCIe bus
    
      - the translation register sets the address from the view of the CPU
    
    The other BAR registers also have this entangled partner, and they can be
    used to:
    
      - in RC mode: address-checking on the receive side of the RC (they can
        define address ranges for memory accesses from remote Endpoints to the
        RC)
    
      - in Endpoint mode: allow the remote CPU to access memory on A3720
    
    The Expansion ROM BAR has only the Endpoint part documented, but from the
    similarities we think that it can also be used in RC mode in that way.
    
    So either Expansion ROM BAR has different meaning (if the hypothesis above
    is true), or we don't know it's meaning (since it is not documented for RC
    mode).
    
    Remove the register from the emulated bridge accessing functions.

    mtd: rawnand: fsmc: Fix timing computation
    
    commit 9472335eaa1452b51dc8e8edaa1a342997cb80c7 upstream.
    
    Under certain circumstances, the timing settings calculated by
    the FSMC NAND controller driver were inaccurate.
    These settings led to incorrect data reads or fallback to
    timing mode 0 depending on the NAND chip used.
    
    The timing computation did not take into account the following
    constraint given in SPEAr3xx reference manual:
      twait >= tCEA - (tset * TCLK) + TOUTDEL + TINDEL
    
    Enhance the timings calculation by taking into account this
    additional constraint.
    
    This change has no impact on slow timing modes such as mode 0.
    Indeed, on mode 0, computed values are the same with and
    without the patch.
    
    NANDs which previously stayed in mode 0 because of fallback to
    mode 0 can now work at higher speeds and NANDs which were not
    working at all because of the corrupted data work at high
    speeds without troubles.
    
    Overall improvement on a Micron/MT29F1G08 (flash_speed tool):
                            mode0       mode3
    eraseblock write speed  3220 KiB/s  4511 KiB/s
    eraseblock read speed   4491 KiB/s  7529 KiB/s

    RDMA/hns: Do not destroy QP resources in the hw resetting phase
    
    commit b0969f83890bf8b47f5c8bd42539599b2b52fdeb upstream.
    
    When hns_roce_v2_destroy_qp() is called, the brief calling process of the
    driver is as follows:
    
     ......
     hns_roce_v2_destroy_qp
     hns_roce_v2_qp_modify
               hns_roce_cmd_mbox
     hns_roce_qp_destroy
    
    If hns_roce_cmd_mbox() detects that the hardware is being reset during the
    execution of the hns_roce_cmd_mbox(), the driver will not be able to get
    the return value from the hardware (the firmware cannot respond to the
    driver's mailbox during the hardware reset phase).
    
    The driver needs to wait for the hardware reset to complete before
    continuing to execute hns_roce_qp_destroy(), otherwise it may happen that
    the driver releases the resources but the hardware is still accessing. In
    order to fix this problem, HNS RoCE needs to add a piece of code to wait
    for the hardware reset to complete.
    
    The original interface get_hw_reset_stat() is the instantaneous state of
    the hardware reset, which cannot accurately reflect whether the hardware
    reset is completed, so it needs to be replaced with the ae_dev_reset_cnt
    interface.
    
    The sign that the hardware reset is complete is that the return value of
    the ae_dev_reset_cnt interface is greater than the original value
    reset_cnt recorded by the driver.

    commit 52414e27d6b568120b087d1fbafbb4482b0ccaab upstream.
    
    is_reset is used to indicate whether the hardware starts to reset. When
    hns_roce_hw_v2_reset_notify_down() is called, the hardware has not yet
    started to reset. If is_reset is set at this time, all mailbox operations
    of resource destroy actions will be intercepted by driver. When the driver
    cleans up resources, but the hardware is still accessed, the following
    errors will appear:

    ASoC: codecs: wcd934x: handle channel mappping list correctly
    
    commit 23ba28616d3063bd4c4953598ed5e439ca891101 upstream.
    
    Currently each channel is added as list to dai channel list, however
    there is danger of adding same channel to multiple dai channel list
    which endups corrupting the other list where its already added.
    
    This patch ensures that the channel is actually free before adding to
    the dai channel list and also ensures that the channel is on the list
    before deleting it.
    
    This check was missing previously, and we did not hit this issue as
    we were testing very simple usecases with sequence of amixer commands.

    According to ZBC and SPC specifications, the unit of ALLOCATION LENGTH

    tracefs: Set all files to the same group ownership as the mount option
    
    commit 48b27b6b5191e2e1f2798cd80877b6e4ef47c351 upstream.
    
    As people have been asking to allow non-root processes to have access to
    the tracefs directory, it was considered best to only allow groups to have
    access to the directory, where it is easier to just set the tracefs file
    system to a specific group (as other would be too dangerous), and that way
    the admins could pick which processes would have access to tracefs.
    
    Unfortunately, this broke tooling on Android that expected the other bit
    to be set. For some special cases, for non-root tools to trace the system,
    tracefs would be mounted and change the permissions of the top level
    directory which gave access to all running tasks permission to the
    tracing directory. Even though this would be dangerous to do in a
    production environment, for testing environments this can be useful.
    
    Now with the new changes to not allow other (which is still the proper
    thing to do), it breaks the testing tooling. Now more code needs to be
    loaded on the system to change ownership of the tracing directory.
    
    The real solution is to have tracefs honor the gid=xxx option when
    mounting. That is,
    
    (tracing group tracing has value 1003)
    
     mount -t tracefs -o gid=1003 tracefs /sys/kernel/tracing
    
    should have it that all files in the tracing directory should be of the
    given group.
    
    Copy the logic from d_walk() from dcache.c and simplify it for the mount
    case of tracefs if gid is set. All the files in tracefs will be walked and
    their group will be set to the value passed in.

    net: mvpp2: fix XDP rx queues registering
    
    commit a50e659b2a1be14784e80f8492aab177e67c53a2 upstream.
    
    The registration of XDP queue information is incorrect because the
    RX queue id we use is invalid. When port->id == 0 it appears to works
    as expected yet it's no longer the case when port->id != 0.
    
    The problem arised while using a recent kernel version on the
    MACCHIATOBin. This board has several ports:
     * eth0 and eth1 are 10Gbps interfaces ; both ports has port->id == 0;
     * eth2 is a 1Gbps interface with port->id != 0.
    
    Code from xdp-tutorial (more specifically advanced03-AF_XDP) was used
    to test packet capture and injection on all these interfaces. The XDP
    kernel was simplified to:
    
            SEC("xdp_sock")
            int xdp_sock_prog(struct xdp_md *ctx)
            {
                    int index = ctx->rx_queue_index;
    
                    /* A set entry here means that the correspnding queue_id
                    * has an active AF_XDP socket bound to it. */
                    if (bpf_map_lookup_elem(&xsks_map, &index))
                            return bpf_redirect_map(&xsks_map, index, 0);
    
                    return XDP_PASS;
            }
    
    Starting the program using:
    
            ./af_xdp_user -d DEV
    
    Gives the following result:
    
     * eth0 : ok
     * eth1 : ok
     * eth2 : no capture, no injection
    
    Investigating the issue shows that XDP rx queues for eth2 are wrong:
    XDP expects their id to be in the range [0..3] but we found them to be
    in the range [32..35].
    
    Trying to force rx queue ids using:
    
            ./af_xdp_user -d eth2 -Q 32
    
    fails as expected (we shall not have more than 4 queues).
    
    When we register the XDP rx queue information (using
    xdp_rxq_info_reg() in function mvpp2_rxq_init()) we tell it to use
    rxq->id as the queue id. This value is computed as:
    
            rxq->id = port->id * max_rxq_count + queue_id
    
    where max_rxq_count depends on the device version. In the MACCHIATOBin
    case, this value is 32, meaning that rx queues on eth2 are numbered
    from 32 to 35 - there are four of them.
    
    Clearly, this is not the per-port queue id that XDP is expecting:
    it wants a value in the range [0..3]. It shall directly use queue_id
    which is stored in rxq->logic_rxq -- so let's use that value instead.
    
    rxq->id is left untouched ; its value is indeed valid but it should
    not be used in this context.
    
    This is consistent with the remaining part of the code in
    mvpp2_rxq_init().
    
    With this change, packet capture is working as expected on all the
    MACCHIATOBin ports.

    aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling
    
    commit 50252e4b5e989ce64555c7aef7516bdefc2fea72 upstream.
    
    signalfd_poll() and binder_poll() are special in that they use a
    waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
    file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
    blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
    require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
    before it is freed, by sending a POLLFREE notification to all waiters.
    
    Unfortunately, only eventpoll handles POLLFREE.  A second type of
    non-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernel v4.18, and it doesn't
    handle POLLFREE.  This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or
    binder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueue gets freed.
    
    Fix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE.
    
    A patch by Ramji Jiyani <ramjiyani@google.com>
    (https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)
    tried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the request
    inline if POLLFREE is seen.  However, that solution had two bugs.
    First, it introduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio
    context while holding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal
    locking order.  Second, it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications
    are missed while the request has been temporarily de-queued.
    
    The second problem was solved by my previous patch.  This patch then
    properly fixes the use-after-free by handling POLLFREE in a
    deadlock-free way.  It does this by taking advantage of the fact that
    freeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to what eventpoll does.

    aio: keep poll requests on waitqueue until completed
    
    commit 363bee27e25804d8981dd1c025b4ad49dc39c530 upstream.
    
    Currently, aio_poll_wake() will always remove the poll request from the
    waitqueue.  Then, if aio_poll_complete_work() sees that none of the
    polled events are ready and the request isn't cancelled, it re-adds the
    request to the waitqueue.  (This can easily happen when polling a file
    that doesn't pass an event mask when waking up its waitqueue.)
    
    This is fundamentally broken for two reasons:
    
      1. If a wakeup occurs between vfs_poll() and the request being
         re-added to the waitqueue, it will be missed because the request
         wasn't on the waitqueue at the time.  Therefore, IOCB_CMD_POLL
         might never complete even if the polled file is ready.
    
      2. When the request isn't on the waitqueue, there is no way to be
         notified that the waitqueue is being freed (which happens when its
         lifetime is shorter than the struct file's).  This is supposed to
         happen via the waitqueue entries being woken up with POLLFREE.
    
    Therefore, leave the requests on the waitqueue until they are actually
    completed (or cancelled).  To keep track of when aio_poll_complete_work
    needs to be scheduled, use new fields in struct poll_iocb.  Remove the
    'done' field which is now redundant.
    
    Note that this is consistent with how sys_poll() and eventpoll work;
    their wakeup functions do *not* remove the waitqueue entries.

    wait: add wake_up_pollfree()
    
    commit 42288cb44c4b5fff7653bc392b583a2b8bd6a8c0 upstream.
    
    Several ->poll() implementations are special in that they use a
    waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
    file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
    blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
    require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
    before it is freed, using 'wake_up_poll(wq, EPOLLHUP | POLLFREE);'.
    
    However, that has a bug: wake_up_poll() calls __wake_up() with
    nr_exclusive=1.  Therefore, if there are multiple "exclusive" waiters,
    and the wakeup function for the first one returns a positive value, only
    that one will be called.  That's *not* what's needed for POLLFREE;
    POLLFREE is special in that it really needs to wake up everyone.
    
    Considering the three non-blocking poll systems:
    
    - io_uring poll doesn't handle POLLFREE at all, so it is broken anyway.
    
    - aio poll is unaffected, since it doesn't support exclusive waits.
      However, that's fragile, as someone could add this feature later.
    
    - epoll doesn't appear to be broken by this, since its wakeup function
      returns 0 when it sees POLLFREE.  But this is fragile.
    
    Although there is a workaround (see epoll), it's better to define a
    function which always sends POLLFREE to all waiters.  Add such a
    function.  Also make it verify that the queue really becomes empty after
    all waiters have been woken up.

    commit f58ac1adc76b5beda43c64ef359056077df4d93a upstream.
    
    With the design of this driver, this condition is often triggered.
    However, the counter that this interrupt indicates an overflow is never
    read either, so overflowing is harmless.
    
    On my system, when a CAN bus starts flapping up and down, this locks up
    the whole system with lots of interrupts and printks.
    
    Specifically, this interrupt indicates the CEL field of ECR has
    overflowed. All reads of ECR mask out CEL.

    drm/syncobj: Deal with signalled fences in drm_syncobj_find_fence.
    
    commit b19926d4f3a660a8b76e5d989ffd1168e619a5c4 upstream.
    
    dma_fence_chain_find_seqno only ever returns the top fence in the
    chain or an unsignalled fence. Hence if we request a seqno that
    is already signalled it returns a NULL fence. Some callers are
    not prepared to handle this, like the syncobj transfer functions
    for example.
    
    This behavior is "new" with timeline syncobj and it looks like
    not all callers were updated. To fix this behavior make sure
    that a successful drm_sync_find_fence always returns a non-NULL
    fence.
    
    v2: Move the fix to drm_syncobj_find_fence from the transfer
        functions.

    nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race
    
    commit 548ec0805c399c65ed66c6641be467f717833ab5 upstream.
    
    A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A
    delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in
    nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we
    then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be
    freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being
    removed from del_recall_lru.
    
    Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,
    usually in the laundromat thread.
    
    I suspect aba2072f4523 "nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding
    writes" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0
    and it looks to me it already had the same problem.  So I'm not sure
    where the bug was introduced; it may have been there from the beginning.

    This happens because we're trying to read from a extent buffer page that
    is !PageUptodate.  This happens because we will clear the page uptodate
    when we have an IO error, but we don't clear the extent buffer uptodate.
    If we do a read later and find this extent buffer we'll think its valid
    and not return an error, and then trip over this warning.
    
    Fix this by also clearing uptodate on the extent buffer when this
    happens, so that we get an error when we do a btrfs_search_slot() and
    find this block later.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Format log strings only if needed
    
    commit 69002c8ce914ef0ae22a6ea14b43bb30b9a9a6a8 upstream.
    
    Commit 598a90f2002c ("scsi: qla2xxx: add ring buffer for tracing debug
    logs") introduced unconditional log string formatting to ql_dbg() even if
    ql_dbg_log event is disabled. It harms performance because some strings are
    formatted in fastpath and/or interrupt context.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Limit the period size to 16MB
    
    commit 8839c8c0f77ab8fc0463f4ab8b37fca3f70677c2 upstream.
    
    Set the practical limit to the period size (the fragment shift in OSS)
    instead of a full 31bit; a too large value could lead to the exhaust
    of memory as we allocate temporary buffers of the period size, too.
    
    As of this patch, we set to 16MB limit, which should cover all use
    cases.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix negative period/buffer sizes
    
    commit 9d2479c960875ca1239bcb899f386970c13d9cfe upstream.
    
    The period size calculation in OSS layer may receive a negative value
    as an error, but the code there assumes only the positive values and
    handle them with size_t.  Due to that, a too big value may be passed
    to the lower layers.
    
    This patch changes the code to handle with ssize_t and adds the proper
    error checks appropriately.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix quirk for TongFang PHxTxX1
    
    commit 619764cc2ec9ce1283a8bbcd89a1376a7c68293b upstream.
    
    This fixes the SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) of the TongFang PHxTxX1 barebone. This
    fixes the issue of sound not working after s3 suspend.
    
    When waking up from s3 suspend the Coef 0x10 is set to 0x0220 instead of
    0x0020. Setting the value manually makes the sound work again. This patch
    does this automatically.
    
    While being on it, I also fixed the comment formatting of the quirk and
    shortened variable and function names.

    ALSA: ctl: Fix copy of updated id with element read/write
    
    commit b6409dd6bdc03aa178bbff0d80db2a30d29b63ac upstream.
    
    When control_compat.c:copy_ctl_value_to_user() is used, by
    ctl_elem_read_user() & ctl_elem_write_user(), it must also copy back the
    snd_ctl_elem_id value that may have been updated (filled in) by the call
    to snd_ctl_elem_read/snd_ctl_elem_write().
    
    This matches the functionality provided by snd_ctl_elem_read_user() and
    snd_ctl_elem_write_user(), via snd_ctl_build_ioff().
    
    Without this, and without making additional calls to snd_ctl_info()
    which are unnecessary when using the non-compat calls, a userspace
    application will not know the numid value for the element and
    consequently will not be able to use the poll/read interface on the
    control file to determine which elements have updates.

    mm: bdi: initialize bdi_min_ratio when bdi is unregistered
    
    commit 3c376dfafbf7a8ea0dea212d095ddd83e93280bb upstream.
    
    Initialize min_ratio if it is set during bdi unregistration.  This can
    prevent problems that may occur a when bdi is removed without resetting
    min_ratio.
    
    For example.
    1) insert external sdcard
    2) set external sdcard's min_ratio 70
    3) remove external sdcard without setting min_ratio 0
    4) insert external sdcard
    5) set external sdcard's min_ratio 70 << error occur(can't set)
    
    Because when an sdcard is removed, the present bdi_min_ratio value will
    remain.  Currently, the only way to reset bdi_min_ratio is to reboot.

    KVM: x86: Wait for IPIs to be delivered when handling Hyper-V TLB flush hypercall
    
    commit 1ebfaa11ebb5b603a3c3f54b2e84fcf1030f5a14 upstream.
    
    Prior to commit 0baedd792713 ("KVM: x86: make Hyper-V PV TLB flush use
    tlb_flush_guest()"), kvm_hv_flush_tlb() was using 'KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH |
    KVM_REQUEST_NO_WAKEUP' when making a request to flush TLBs on other vCPUs
    and KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH is/was defined as:
    
     (0 | KVM_REQUEST_WAIT | KVM_REQUEST_NO_WAKEUP)
    
    so KVM_REQUEST_WAIT was lost. Hyper-V TLFS, however, requires that
    "This call guarantees that by the time control returns back to the
    caller, the observable effects of all flushes on the specified virtual
    processors have occurred." and without KVM_REQUEST_WAIT there's a small
    chance that the vCPU making the TLB flush will resume running before
    all IPIs get delivered to other vCPUs and a stale mapping can get read
    there.
    
    Fix the issue by adding KVM_REQUEST_WAIT flag to KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH_GUEST:
    kvm_hv_flush_tlb() is the sole caller which uses it for
    kvm_make_all_cpus_request()/kvm_make_vcpus_request_mask() where
    KVM_REQUEST_WAIT makes a difference.

    commit 61c2402665f1e10c5742033fce18392e369931d7 upstream.
    
    For some reason, fq_pie_destroy() did not copy
    working code from pie_destroy() and other qdiscs,
    thus causing elusive bug.
    
    Before calling del_timer_sync(&q->adapt_timer),
    we need to ensure timer will not rearm itself.

    devlink: fix netns refcount leak in devlink_nl_cmd_reload()
    
    commit 4dbb0dad8e63fcd0b5a117c2861d2abe7ff5f186 upstream.
    
    While preparing my patch series adding netns refcount tracking,
    I spotted bugs in devlink_nl_cmd_reload()
    
    Some error paths forgot to release a refcount on a netns.
    
    To fix this, we can reduce the scope of get_net()/put_net()
    section around the call to devlink_reload().

    IB/hfi1: Correct guard on eager buffer deallocation
    
    commit 9292f8f9a2ac42eb320bced7153aa2e63d8cc13a upstream.
    
    The code tests the dma address which legitimately can be 0.
    
    The code should test the kernel logical address to avoid leaking eager

    iavf: Fix reporting when setting descriptor count
    
    commit 1a1aa356ddf3f16539f5962c01c5f702686dfc15 upstream.
    
    iavf_set_ringparams doesn't communicate to the user that
    
    1. The user requested descriptor count is out of range. Instead it
       just quietly sets descriptors to the "clamped" value and calls it
       done. This makes it look an invalid value was successfully set as
       the descriptor count when this isn't actually true.
    
    2. The user provided descriptor count needs to be inflated for alignment
       reasons.
    
    This behavior is confusing. The ice driver has already addressed this
    by rejecting invalid values for descriptor count and
    messaging for alignment adjustments.
    Do the same thing here by adding the error and info messages.

    iavf: restore MSI state on reset
    
    commit 7e4dcc13965c57869684d57a1dc6dd7be589488c upstream.
    
    If the PF experiences an FLR, the VF's MSI and MSI-X configuration will
    be conveniently and silently removed in the process. When this happens,
    reset recovery will appear to complete normally but no traffic will
    pass. The netdev watchdog will helpfully notify everyone of this issue.
    
    To prevent such public embarrassment, restore MSI configuration at every
    reset. For normal resets, this will do no harm, but for VF resets
    resulting from a PF FLR, this will keep the VF working.

            kfree_skb(skb);
            return -EINVAL;
        }
    
    skb->len contains network and transport header len here, we should use
    only data len instead.

    seg6: fix the iif in the IPv6 socket control block
    
    commit ae68d93354e5bf5191ee673982251864ea24dd5c upstream.
    
    When an IPv4 packet is received, the ip_rcv_core(...) sets the receiving
    interface index into the IPv4 socket control block (v5.16-rc4,
    net/ipv4/ip_input.c line 510):
    
        IPCB(skb)->iif = skb->skb_iif;
    
    If that IPv4 packet is meant to be encapsulated in an outer IPv6+SRH
    header, the seg6_do_srh_encap(...) performs the required encapsulation.
    In this case, the seg6_do_srh_encap function clears the IPv6 socket control
    block (v5.16-rc4 net/ipv6/seg6_iptunnel.c line 163):
    
        memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IP6CB(skb)));
    
    The memset(...) was introduced in commit ef489749aae5 ("ipv6: sr: clear
    IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation") a long time ago (2019-01-29).
    
    Since the IPv6 socket control block and the IPv4 socket control block share
    the same memory area (skb->cb), the receiving interface index info is lost
    (IP6CB(skb)->iif is set to zero).
    
    As a side effect, that condition triggers a NULL pointer dereference if
    commit 0857d6f8c759 ("ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig
    netdev") is applied.
    
    To fix that issue, we set the IP6CB(skb)->iif with the index of the
    receiving interface once again.

    ice: ignore dropped packets during init
    
    commit 28dc1b86f8ea9fd6f4c9e0b363db73ecabf84e22 upstream.
    
    If the hardware is constantly receiving unicast or broadcast packets
    during driver load, the device previously counted many GLV_RDPC (VSI
    dropped packets) events during init. This causes confusing dropped
    packet statistics during driver load. The dropped packets counter
    incrementing does stop once the driver finishes loading.
    
    Avoid this problem by baselining our statistics at the end of driver
    open instead of the end of probe.

    bpf: Fix the off-by-two error in range markings
    
    commit 2fa7d94afc1afbb4d702760c058dc2d7ed30f226 upstream.
    
    The first commit cited below attempts to fix the off-by-one error that
    appeared in some comparisons with an open range. Due to this error,
    arithmetically equivalent pieces of code could get different verdicts
    from the verifier, for example (pseudocode):
    
      // 1. Passes the verifier:
      if (data + 8 > data_end)
          return early
      read *(u64 *)data, i.e. [data; data+7]
    
      // 2. Rejected by the verifier (should still pass):
      if (data + 7 >= data_end)
          return early
      read *(u64 *)data, i.e. [data; data+7]
    
    The attempted fix, however, shifts the range by one in a wrong
    direction, so the bug not only remains, but also such piece of code
    starts failing in the verifier:
    
      // 3. Rejected by the verifier, but the check is stricter than in #1.
      if (data + 8 >= data_end)
          return early
      read *(u64 *)data, i.e. [data; data+7]
    
    The change performed by that fix converted an off-by-one bug into
    off-by-two. The second commit cited below added the BPF selftests
    written to ensure than code chunks like #3 are rejected, however,
    they should be accepted.
    
    This commit fixes the off-by-two error by adjusting new_range in the
    right direction and fixes the tests by changing the range into the
    one that should actually fail.

    vrf: don't run conntrack on vrf with !dflt qdisc
    
    commit d43b75fbc23f0ac1ef9c14a5a166d3ccb761a451 upstream.
    
    After the below patch, the conntrack attached to skb is set to "notrack" in
    the context of vrf device, for locally generated packets.
    But this is true only when the default qdisc is set to the vrf device. When
    changing the qdisc, notrack is not set anymore.
    In fact, there is a shortcut in the vrf driver, when the default qdisc is
    set, see commit dcdd43c41e60 ("net: vrf: performance improvements for
    IPv4") for more details.
    
    This patch ensures that the behavior is always the same, whatever the qdisc
    is.
    
    To demonstrate the difference, a new test is added in conntrack_vrf.sh.

    commit 33b8aad21ac175eba9577a73eb62b0aa141c241c upstream.
    
    Rework the reproducer for the vrf+conntrack regression reported
    by Eugene into a selftest and also add a test for ip masquerading
    that Lahav fixed recently.
    
    With net or net-next tree, the first test fails and the latter
    two pass.
    
    With 09e856d54bda5f28 ("vrf: Reset skb conntrack connection on VRF rcv")
    reverted first test passes but the last two fail.
    
    A proper fix needs more work, for time being a revert seems to be
    the best choice, snat/masquerade did not work before the fix.

    x86/sme: Explicitly map new EFI memmap table as encrypted
    
    commit 1ff2fc02862d52e18fd3daabcfe840ec27e920a8 upstream.
    
    Reserving memory using efi_mem_reserve() calls into the x86
    efi_arch_mem_reserve() function. This function will insert a new EFI
    memory descriptor into the EFI memory map representing the area of
    memory to be reserved and marking it as EFI runtime memory. As part
    of adding this new entry, a new EFI memory map is allocated and mapped.
    The mapping is where a problem can occur. This new memory map is mapped
    using early_memremap() and generally mapped encrypted, unless the new
    memory for the mapping happens to come from an area of memory that is
    marked as EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_DATA memory. In this case, the new memory will
    be mapped unencrypted. However, during replacement of the old memory map,
    efi_mem_type() is disabled, so the new memory map will now be long-term
    mapped encrypted (in efi.memmap), resulting in the map containing invalid
    data and causing the kernel boot to crash.
    
    Since it is known that the area will be mapped encrypted going forward,
    explicitly map the new memory map as encrypted using early_memremap_prot().

    can: kvaser_usb: get CAN clock frequency from device
    
    commit fb12797ab1fef480ad8a32a30984844444eeb00d upstream.
    
    The CAN clock frequency is used when calculating the CAN bittiming
    parameters. When wrong clock frequency is used, the device may end up
    with wrong bittiming parameters, depending on user requested bittiming
    parameters.
    
    To avoid this, get the CAN clock frequency from the device. Various
    existing Kvaser Leaf products use different CAN clocks.

    IB/hfi1: Fix leak of rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr
    
    commit 60a8b5a1611b4a26de4839ab9c1fc2a9cf3e17c1 upstream.
    
    This buffer is currently allocated in hfi1_init():
    
            if (reinit)
                    ret = init_after_reset(dd);
            else
                    ret = loadtime_init(dd);
            if (ret)
                    goto done;
    
            /* allocate dummy tail memory for all receive contexts */
            dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr = dma_alloc_coherent(&dd->pcidev->dev,
                                                             sizeof(u64),
                                                             &dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_dma,
                                                             GFP_KERNEL);
    
            if (!dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr) {
                    dd_dev_err(dd, "cannot allocate dummy tail memory\n");
                    ret = -ENOMEM;
                    goto done;
            }
    
    The reinit triggered path will overwrite the old allocation and leak it.
    
    Fix by moving the allocation to hfi1_alloc_devdata() and the deallocation
    to hfi1_free_devdata().

    guards in the slow path handler to detect and handle a partially
    initialized receive context and noop the receive.

    nft_set_pipapo: Fix bucket load in AVX2 lookup routine for six 8-bit groups
    
    commit b7e945e228d7df1b1473ef6fd2cdec67433065fb upstream.
    
    The sixth byte of packet data has to be looked up in the sixth group,
    not in the seventh one, even if we load the bucket data into ymm6
    (and not ymm5, for convenience of tracking stalls).
    
    Without this fix, matching on a MAC address as first field of a set,
    if 8-bit groups are selected (due to a small set size) would fail,
    that is, the given MAC address would never match.

    HID: check for valid USB device for many HID drivers
    
    commit 93020953d0fa7035fd036ad87a47ae2b7aa4ae33 upstream.
    
    Many HID drivers assume that the HID device assigned to them is a USB
    device as that was the only way HID devices used to be able to be
    created in Linux.  However, with the additional ways that HID devices
    can be created for many different bus types, that is no longer true, so
    properly check that we have a USB device associated with the HID device
    before allowing a driver that makes this assumption to claim it.

    HID: wacom: fix problems when device is not a valid USB device
    
    commit 720ac467204a70308bd687927ed475afb904e11b upstream.
    
    The wacom driver accepts devices of more than just USB types, but some
    code paths can cause problems if the device being controlled is not a
    USB device due to a lack of checking.  Add the needed checks to ensure
    that the USB device accesses are only happening on a "real" USB device,
    and not one on some other bus.

    HID: add USB_HID dependancy on some USB HID drivers
    
    commit f237d9028f844a86955fc9da59d7ac4a5c55d7d5 upstream.
    
    Some HID drivers are only for USB drivers, yet did not depend on
    CONFIG_USB_HID.  This was hidden by the fact that the USB functions were
    stubbed out in the past, but now that drivers are checking for USB
    devices properly, build errors can occur with some random
    configurations.

    HID: add hid_is_usb() function to make it simpler for USB detection
    
    commit f83baa0cb6cfc92ebaf7f9d3a99d7e34f2e77a8a upstream.
    
    A number of HID drivers already call hid_is_using_ll_driver() but only
    for the detection of if this is a USB device or not.  Make this more
    obvious by creating hid_is_usb() and calling the function that way.
    
    Also converts the existing hid_is_using_ll_driver() functions to use the
    new call.

    HID: quirks: Add quirk for the Microsoft Surface 3 type-cover
    
    commit 9003fbe0f3674b972f56fa7e6bf3ac9dbfc4d0ec upstream.
    
    Add a HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk for the
    Microsoft Surface 3 (non pro) type-cover.
    
    Trying to init the reports seems to confuse the type-cover and
    causes 2 issues:
    
    1. Despite hid-multitouch sending the command to switch the
    touchpad to multitouch mode, it keeps sending events on the
    mouse emulation interface.
    
    2. The touchpad completely stops sending events after a reboot.
    
    Adding the HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk fixes both issues.

    gcc-plugins: fix gcc 11 indigestion with plugins...
    
    commit 67a5a68013056cbcf0a647e36cb6f4622fb6a470 upstream.
    
    Fedora Rawhide has started including gcc 11,and the g++ compiler
    throws a wobbly when it hits scripts/gcc-plugins:
    
      HOSTCXX scripts/gcc-plugins/latent_entropy_plugin.so
    In file included from /usr/include/c++/11/type_traits:35,
                     from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/11/plugin/include/system.h:244,
                     from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/11/plugin/include/gcc-plugin.h:28,
                     from scripts/gcc-plugins/gcc-common.h:7,
                     from scripts/gcc-plugins/latent_entropy_plugin.c:78:
    /usr/include/c++/11/bits/c++0x_warning.h:32:2: error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO
     C++ 2011 standard. This support must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
       32 | #error This file requires compiler and library support \
    
    In fact, it works just fine with c++11, which has been in gcc since 4.8,
    and we now require 4.9 as a minimum.

    gcc-plugins: simplify GCC plugin-dev capability test
    
    commit 1e860048c53ee77ee9870dcce94847a28544b753 upstream.
    
    Linus pointed out a third of the time in the Kconfig parse stage comes
    from the single invocation of cc1plus in scripts/gcc-plugin.sh [1],
    and directly testing plugin-version.h for existence cuts down the
    overhead a lot. [2]
    
    This commit takes one step further to kill the build test entirely.
    
    The small piece of code was probably intended to test the C++ designated
    initializer, which was not supported until C++20.
    
    In fact, with -pedantic option given, both GCC and Clang emit a warning.
    
    $ echo 'class test { public: int test; } test = { .test = 1 };' | g++ -x c++ -pedantic - -fsyntax-only
    <stdin>:1:43: warning: C++ designated initializers only available with '-std=c++2a' or '-std=gnu++2a' [-Wpedantic]
    $ echo 'class test { public: int test; } test = { .test = 1 };' | clang++ -x c++ -pedantic - -fsyntax-only
    <stdin>:1:43: warning: designated initializers are a C++20 extension [-Wc++20-designator]
    class test { public: int test; } test = { .test = 1 };
                                              ^
    1 warning generated.
    
    Otherwise, modern C++ compilers should be able to build the code, and
    hopefully skipping this test should not make any practical problem.
    
    Checking the existence of plugin-version.h is still needed to ensure
    the plugin-dev package is installed. The test code is now small enough
    to be embedded in scripts/gcc-plugins/Kconfig.

    usb: gadget: uvc: fix multiple opens
    
    commit 72ee48ee8925446eaeda8e4ef3f2eb16b4a93d2a upstream.
    
    Currently, the UVC function is activated when open on the corresponding
    v4l2 device is called.  On another open the activation of the function
    fails since the deactivation counter in `usb_function_activate` equals
    0. However the error is not returned to userspace since the open of the
    v4l2 device is successful.
    
    On a close the function is deactivated (since deactivation counter still
    equals 0) and the video is disabled in `uvc_v4l2_release`, although the
    UVC application potentially is streaming.
    
    Move activation of UVC function to subscription on UVC_EVENT_SETUP
    because there we can guarantee for a userspace application utilizing
    UVC.  Block subscription on UVC_EVENT_SETUP while another application
    already is subscribed to it, indicated by `bool func_connected` in
    `struct uvc_device`.  Extend the `struct uvc_file_handle` with member
    `bool is_uvc_app_handle` to tag it as the handle used by the userspace
    UVC application.
    
    With this a process is able to check capabilities of the v4l2 device
    without deactivating the function for the actual UVC application.
