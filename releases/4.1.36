    Debian started to build the gcc with -fPIE by default so the kernel
    build ends before it starts properly with:
    |kernel/bounds.c:1:0: error: code model kernel does not support PIC mode
    
    Also add to KBUILD_AFLAGS due to:
    
    |gcc -Wp,-MD,arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso32/.note.o.d … -mfentry -DCC_USING_FENTRY … vdso/vdso32/note.S
    |arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso32/note.S:1:0: sorry, unimplemented: -mfentry isn’t supported for 32-bit in combination with -fpic
    
    Tagging it stable so it is possible to compile recent stable kernels as
    well.

    firewire: net: fix fragmented datagram_size off-by-one
    
    [ Upstream commit e9300a4b7bbae83af1f7703938c94cf6dc6d308f ]
    
    RFC 2734 defines the datagram_size field in fragment encapsulation
    headers thus:
    
        datagram_size:  The encoded size of the entire IP datagram.  The
        value of datagram_size [...] SHALL be one less than the value of
        Total Length in the datagram's IP header (see STD 5, RFC 791).
    
    Accordingly, the eth1394 driver of Linux 2.6.36 and older set and got
    this field with a -/+1 offset:
    
        ether1394_tx() /* transmit */
            ether1394_encapsulate_prep()
                hdr->ff.dg_size = dg_size - 1;
    
        ether1394_data_handler() /* receive */
            if (hdr->common.lf == ETH1394_HDR_LF_FF)
                dg_size = hdr->ff.dg_size + 1;
            else
                dg_size = hdr->sf.dg_size + 1;
    
    Likewise, I observe OS X 10.4 and Windows XP Pro SP3 to transmit 1500
    byte sized datagrams in fragments with datagram_size=1499 if link
    fragmentation is required.
    
    Only firewire-net sets and gets datagram_size without this offset.  The
    result is lacking interoperability of firewire-net with OS X, Windows
    XP, and presumably Linux' eth1394.  (I did not test with the latter.)
    For example, FTP data transfers to a Linux firewire-net box with max_rec
    smaller than the 1500 bytes MTU
      - from OS X fail entirely,
      - from Win XP start out with a bunch of fragmented datagrams which
        time out, then continue with unfragmented datagrams because Win XP
        temporarily reduces the MTU to 576 bytes.
    
    So let's fix firewire-net's datagram_size accessors.
    
    Note that firewire-net thereby loses interoperability with unpatched
    firewire-net, but only if link fragmentation is employed.  (This happens
    with large broadcast datagrams, and with large datagrams on several
    FireWire CardBus cards with smaller max_rec than equivalent PCI cards,
    and it can be worked around by setting a small enough MTU.)

    firewire: net: guard against rx buffer overflows
    
    [ Upstream commit 667121ace9dbafb368618dbabcf07901c962ddac ]
    
    The IP-over-1394 driver firewire-net lacked input validation when
    handling incoming fragmented datagrams.  A maliciously formed fragment
    with a respectively large datagram_offset would cause a memcpy past the
    datagram buffer.
    
    So, drop any packets carrying a fragment with offset + length larger
    than datagram_size.
    
    In addition, ensure that
      - GASP header, unfragmented encapsulation header, or fragment
        encapsulation header actually exists before we access it,
      - the encapsulated datagram or fragment is of nonzero size.

    parisc: Ensure consistent state when switching to kernel stack at syscall entry
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ed518328d0189e0fdf1bb7c73290d546143ea66 ]
    
    We have one critical section in the syscall entry path in which we switch from
    the userspace stack to kernel stack. In the event of an external interrupt, the
    interrupt code distinguishes between those two states by analyzing the value of
    sr7. If sr7 is zero, it uses the kernel stack. Therefore it's important, that
    the value of sr7 is in sync with the currently enabled stack.
    
    This patch now disables interrupts while executing the critical section.  This
    prevents the interrupt handler to possibly see an inconsistent state which in
    the worst case can lead to crashes.
    
    Interestingly, in the syscall exit path interrupts were already disabled in the
    critical section which switches back to the userspace stack.

    Commit c6017e793b93 ("virtio: console: add locks around buffer removal
    in port unplug path") added locking around the freeing of buffers in the
    vq. However, when free_buf() is called with can_sleep = true and rproc
    is enabled, it calls dma_free_coherent() directly, requiring interrupts
    to be enabled. Currently a WARNING is triggered due to the spin locking
    around free_buf, with a call stack like this:

    md: be careful not lot leak internal curr_resync value into metadata. -- (all)
    
    [ Upstream commit 1217e1d1999ed6c9c1e1b1acae0a74ab70464ae2 ]
    
    mddev->curr_resync usually records where the current resync is up to,
    but during the starting phase it has some "magic" values.
    
     1 - means that the array is trying to start a resync, but has yielded
         to another array which shares physical devices, and also needs to
         start a resync
     2 - means the array is trying to start resync, but has found another
         array which shares physical devices and has already started resync.
    
     3 - means that resync has commensed, but it is possible that nothing
         has actually been resynced yet.
    
    It is important that this value not be visible to user-space and
    particularly that it doesn't get written to the metadata, as the
    resync or recovery checkpoint.  In part, this is because it may be
    slightly higher than the correct value, though this is very rare.
    In part, because it is not a multiple of 4K, and some devices only
    support 4K aligned accesses.
    
    There are two places where this value is propagates into either
    ->curr_resync_completed or ->recovery_cp or ->recovery_offset.
    These currently avoid the propagation of values 1 and 3, but will
    allow 3 to leak through.
    
    Change them to only propagate the value if it is > 3.
    
    As this can cause an array to fail, the patch is suitable for -stable.

    [ Upstream commit 5ed1df2eacc0ba92c8c7e2499c97594b5ef928a8 ]
    
    There can be a small window between the moment that recovery
    actually writes the last block and the time when various sysfs
    and /proc/mdstat attributes report that it has finished.
    During this time, 'sync_completed' can have the wrong value.
    This can confuse monitoring software.
    
    So:
     - don't set curr_resync_completed beyond the end of the devices,
     - set it correctly when resync/recovery has completed.

    [ Upstream commit 36e3fa6a38e135e9478a2f75dec9bf6ff1e6480e ]
    
    The i2c adapter is only relevant for some peer device types, so
    let's clear the pdt if it's still the same as the old_pdt when we

    I don't really like this design pattern of updating port->whatever
    before doing the accompanying changes and passing around old_whatever
    to figure stuff out. Would make much more sense to me to the pass the
    new value around and only update the port->whatever when things are
    consistent. But let's try to work with what we have right now.

    "And naturally I forgot to amend the commit message w.r.t. this guy
    [the change in drm_dp_destroy_port].  We don't really need to do this

    KVM: MIPS: Precalculate MMIO load resume PC
    
    [ Upstream commit e1e575f6b026734be3b1f075e780e91ab08ca541 ]
    
    The advancing of the PC when completing an MMIO load is done before
    re-entering the guest, i.e. before restoring the guest ASID. However if
    the load is in a branch delay slot it may need to access guest code to
    read the prior branch instruction. This isn't safe in TLB mapped code at
    the moment, nor in the future when we'll access unmapped guest segments
    using direct user accessors too, as it could read the branch from host
    user memory instead.
    
    Therefore calculate the resume PC in advance while we're still in the
    right context and save it in the new vcpu->arch.io_pc (replacing the no
    longer needed vcpu->arch.pending_load_cause), and restore it on MMIO
    completion.

    KVM: MIPS: Make ERET handle ERL before EXL
    
    [ Upstream commit ede5f3e7b54a4347be4d8525269eae50902bd7cd ]
    
    The ERET instruction to return from exception is used for returning from
    exception level (Status.EXL) and error level (Status.ERL). If both bits
    are set however we should be returning from ERL first, as ERL can

    drm/radeon: drop register readback in cayman_cp_int_cntl_setup
    
    [ Upstream commit 537b4b462caa8bfb9726d9695b8e56e2d5e6b41e ]
    
    The read is taking a considerable amount of time (about 50us on this
    machine). The register does not ever hold anything other than the ring
    ID that is updated in this exact function, so there is no need for
    the read modify write cycle.
    
    This chops off a big chunk of the time spent in hardirq disabled
    context, as this function is called multiple times in the interrupt
    handler. With this change applied radeon won't show up in the list
    of the worst IRQ latency offenders anymore, where it was a regular
    before.

    scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix data integrity failure for JBOD (passthrough) devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e793f6fc0db920400574211c48f9157a37e3945 ]
    
    Commit 02b01e010afe ("megaraid_sas: return sync cache call with
    success") modified the driver to successfully complete SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE
    commands without passing them to the controller. Disk drive caches are
    only explicitly managed by controller firmware when operating in RAID
    mode. So this commit effectively disabled writeback cache flushing for
    any drives used in JBOD mode, leading to data integrity failures.

    powerpc: Convert cmp to cmpd in idle enter sequence
    
    [ Upstream commit 80f23935cadb1c654e81951f5a8b7ceae0acc1b4 ]
    
    PowerPC's "cmp" instruction has four operands. Normally people write
    "cmpw" or "cmpd" for the second cmp operand 0 or 1. But, frequently
    people forget, and write "cmp" with just three operands.
    
    With older binutils this is silently accepted as if this was "cmpw",
    while often "cmpd" is wanted. With newer binutils GAS will complain
    about this for 64-bit code. For 32-bit code it still silently assumes
    "cmpw" is what is meant.
    
    In this instance the code comes directly from ISA v2.07, including the
    cmp, but cmpd is correct. Backport to stable so that new toolchains can
    build old kernels.

    mac80211: discard multicast and 4-addr A-MSDUs
    
    [ Upstream commit ea720935cf6686f72def9d322298bf7e9bd53377 ]
    
    In mac80211, multicast A-MSDUs are accepted in many cases that
    they shouldn't be accepted in:
     * drop A-MSDUs with a multicast A1 (RA), as required by the
       spec in 9.11 (802.11-2012 version)
     * drop A-MSDUs with a 4-addr header, since the fourth address
       can't actually be useful for them; unless 4-address frame
       format is actually requested, even though the fourth address
       is still not useful in this case, but ignored
    
    Accepting the first case, in particular, is very problematic
    since it allows anyone else with possession of a GTK to send
    unicast frames encapsulated in a multicast A-MSDU, even when
    the AP has client isolation enabled.

    GenWQE: Fix bad page access during abort of resource allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit a7a7aeefbca2982586ba2c9fd7739b96416a6d1d ]
    
    When interrupting an application which was allocating DMAable
    memory, it was possible, that the DMA memory was deallocated
    twice, leading to the error symptoms below.
    
    Thanks to Gerald, who analyzed the problem and provided this
    patch.
    
    I agree with his analysis of the problem: ddcb_cmd_fixups() ->
    genwqe_alloc_sync_sgl() (fails in f/lpage, but sgl->sgl != NULL
    and f/lpage maybe also != NULL) -> ddcb_cmd_cleanup() ->
    genwqe_free_sync_sgl() (double free, because sgl->sgl != NULL and
    f/lpage maybe also != NULL)
    
    In this scenario we would have exactly the kind of double free that
    would explain the WARNING / Bad page state, and as expected it is
    caused by broken error handling (cleanup).
    
    Using the Ubuntu git source, tag Ubuntu-4.4.0-33.52, he was able to reproduce
    the "Bad page state" issue, and with the patch on top he could not reproduce
    it any more.

    mm/list_lru.c: avoid error-path NULL pointer deref
    
    [ Upstream commit 1bc11d70b5db7c6bb1414b283d7f09b1fe1ac0d0 ]
    
    As described in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177821:
    
    After some analysis it seems to be that the problem is in alloc_super().
    In case list_lru_init_memcg() fails it goes into destroy_super(), which
    calls list_lru_destroy().
    
    And in list_lru_init() we see that in case memcg_init_list_lru() fails,
    lru->node is freed, but not set NULL, which then leads list_lru_destroy()
    to believe it is initialized and call memcg_destroy_list_lru().
    memcg_destroy_list_lru() in turn can access lru->node[i].memcg_lrus,
    which is NULL.

    btrfs: fix races on root_log_ctx lists
    
    [ Upstream commit 570dd45042a7c8a7aba1ee029c5dd0f5ccf41b9b ]
    
    btrfs_remove_all_log_ctxs takes a shortcut where it avoids walking the
    list because it knows all of the waiters are patiently waiting for the
    commit to finish.
    
    But, there's a small race where btrfs_sync_log can remove itself from
    the list if it finds a log commit is already done.  Also, it uses
    list_del_init() to remove itself from the list, but there's no way to
    know if btrfs_remove_all_log_ctxs has already run, so we don't know for
    sure if it is safe to call list_del_init().
    
    This gets rid of all the shortcuts for btrfs_remove_all_log_ctxs(), and
    just calls it with the proper locking.
    
    This is part two of the corruption fixed by cbd60aa7cd1.  I should have
    done this in the first place, but convinced myself the optimizations were
    safe.  A 12 hour run of dbench 2048 will eventually trigger a list debug
    WARN_ON for the list_del_init() in btrfs_sync_log().

    KEYS: Fix short sprintf buffer in /proc/keys show function
    
    [ Upstream commit 03dab869b7b239c4e013ec82aea22e181e441cfc ]
    
    This fixes CVE-2016-7042.
    
    Fix a short sprintf buffer in proc_keys_show().  If the gcc stack protector
    is turned on, this can cause a panic due to stack corruption.
    
    The problem is that xbuf[] is not big enough to hold a 64-bit timeout
    rendered as weeks:
    
            (gdb) p 0xffffffffffffffffULL/(60*60*24*7)
            $2 = 30500568904943
    
    That's 14 chars plus NUL, not 11 chars plus NUL.
    
    Expand the buffer to 16 chars.
    
    I think the unpatched code apparently works if the stack-protector is not
    enabled because on a 32-bit machine the buffer won't be overflowed and on a
    64-bit machine there's a 64-bit aligned pointer at one side and an int that
    isn't checked again on the other side.
    
    The panic incurred looks something like:
    
    Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: ffffffff81352ebe

    hv: do not lose pending heartbeat vmbus packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 407a3aee6ee2d2cb46d9ba3fc380bc29f35d020c ]
    
    The host keeps sending heartbeat packets independent of the
    guest responding to them.  Even though we respond to the heartbeat messages at
    interrupt level, we can have situations where there maybe multiple heartbeat
    messages pending that have not been responded to. For instance this occurs when the
    VM is paused and the host continues to send the heartbeat messages.
    Address this issue by draining and responding to all
    the heartbeat messages that maybe pending.

    [ Upstream commit 43605e293eb13c07acb546c14f407a271837af17 ]
    
    SEC registers are not accessible when the TXE device is in low power
    state, hence the SEC interrupt cannot be processed if device is not
    awake.
    
    In some rare cases entrance to low power state (aliveness off) and input
    ready bits can be signaled at the same time, resulting in communication
    stall as input ready won't be signaled again after waking up. To resolve
    this IPC_HHIER_SEC bit in HHISR_REG should not be cleaned if the
    interrupt is not processed.

    arm64: KVM: Take S1 walks into account when determining S2 write faults
    
    [ Upstream commit 60e21a0ef54cd836b9eb22c7cb396989b5b11648 ]
    
    The WnR bit in the HSR/ESR_EL2 indicates whether a data abort was
    generated by a read or a write instruction. For stage 2 data aborts
    generated by a stage 1 translation table walk (i.e. the actual page
    table access faults at EL2), the WnR bit therefore reports whether the
    instruction generating the walk was a load or a store, *not* whether the
    page table walker was reading or writing the entry.
    
    For page tables marked as read-only at stage 2 (e.g. due to KSM merging
    them with the tables from another guest), this could result in livelock,
    where a page table walk generated by a load instruction attempts to
    set the access flag in the stage 1 descriptor, but fails to trigger
    CoW in the host since only a read fault is reported.
    
    This patch modifies the arm64 kvm_vcpu_dabt_iswrite function to
    take into account stage 2 faults in stage 1 walks. Since DBM cannot be
    disabled at EL2 for CPUs that implement it, we assume that these faults
    are always causes by writes, avoiding the livelock situation at the
    expense of occasional, spurious CoWs.
    
    We could, in theory, do a bit better by checking the guest TCR
    configuration and inspecting the page table to see why the PTE faulted.
    However, I doubt this is measurable in practice, and the threat of
    livelock is real.

    arm/arm64: KVM: Handle out-of-RAM cache maintenance as a NOP
    
    [ Upstream commit 57c841f131ef295b583365d2fddd6b0d16e82c10 ]
    
    So far, our handling of cache maintenance by VA has been pretty
    simple: Either the access is in the guest RAM and generates a S2
    fault, which results in the page being mapped RW, or we go down
    the io_mem_abort() path, and nuke the guest.
    
    The first one is fine, but the second one is extremely weird.
    Treating the CM as an I/O is wrong, and nothing in the ARM ARM
    indicates that we should generate a fault for something that
    cannot end-up in the cache anyway (even if the guest maps it,
    it will keep on faulting at stage-2 for emulation).
    
    So let's just skip this instruction, and let the guest get away
    with it.

    libxfs: clean up _calc_dquots_per_chunk
    
    [ Upstream commit 58d789678546d46d7bbd809dd7dab417c0f23655 ]
    
    The function xfs_calc_dquots_per_chunk takes a parameter in units
    of basic blocks.  The kernel seems to get the units wrong, but
    userspace got 'fixed' by commenting out the unnecessary conversion.
    Fix both.

    target: Don't override EXTENDED_COPY xcopy_pt_cmd SCSI status code
    
    [ Upstream commit 926317de33998c112c5510301868ea9aa34097e2 ]
    
    This patch addresses a bug where a local EXTENDED_COPY WRITE or READ
    backend I/O request would always return SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION,
    even if underlying xcopy_pt_cmd->se_cmd generated a different
    SCSI status code.
    
    ESX host environments expect to hit SAM_STAT_RESERVATION_CONFLICT
    for certain scenarios, and SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION results in
    non-retriable status for these cases.
    
    Tested on v4.1.y with ESX v5.5u2+ with local IBLOCK backend copy.

    [ Upstream commit 527268df31e57cf2b6d417198717c6d6afdb1e3e ]
    
    This patch fixes a regression in >= v4.1.y code where the original
    SCF_ACK_KREF assignment in target_get_sess_cmd() was dropped upstream
    in commit 054922bb, but the series for addressing TMR ABORT_TASK +
    LUN_RESET with fabric session reinstatement in commit febe562c20 still
    depends on this code in transport_cmd_finish_abort().
    
    The regression manifests itself as a se_cmd->cmd_kref +1 leak, where
    ABORT_TASK + LUN_RESET can hang indefinately for a specific I_T session
    for drivers using SCF_ACK_KREF, resulting in hung kthreads.
    
    This patch has been verified with v4.1.y code.

    ubifs: Abort readdir upon error
    
    [ Upstream commit c83ed4c9dbb358b9e7707486e167e940d48bfeed ]
    
    If UBIFS is facing an error while walking a directory, it reports this
    error and ubifs_readdir() returns the error code. But the VFS readdir
    logic does not make the getdents system call fail in all cases. When the
    readdir cursor indicates that more entries are present, the system call
    will just return and the libc wrapper will try again since it also
    knows that more entries are present.
    This causes the libc wrapper to busy loop for ever when a directory is
    corrupted on UBIFS.
    A common approach do deal with corrupted directory entries is
    skipping them by setting the cursor to the next entry. On UBIFS this
    approach is not possible since we cannot compute the next directory
    entry cursor position without reading the current entry. So all we can
    do is setting the cursor to the "no more entries" position and make
    getdents exit.

    arm64: percpu: rewrite ll/sc loops in assembly
    
    [ Upstream commit 1e6e57d9b34a9075d5f9e2048ea7b09756590d11 ]
    
    Writing the outer loop of an LL/SC sequence using do {...} while
    constructs potentially allows the compiler to hoist memory accesses
    between the STXR and the branch back to the LDXR. On CPUs that do not
    guarantee forward progress of LL/SC loops when faced with memory
    accesses to the same ERG (up to 2k) between the failed STXR and the
    branch back, we may end up livelocking.
    
    This patch avoids this issue in our percpu atomics by rewriting the
    outer loop as part of the LL/SC inline assembly block.

    If a cxl adapter faults on an invalid address for a kernel context, we

    address. Which will cause a crash when dereferencing mm. It is clearly

    so that cxl can ack the interrupt with an address error.

    scsi: Fix use-after-free
    
    [ Upstream commit bcd8f2e94808fcddf6ef3af5f060a36820dcc432 ]
    
    This patch fixes one use-after-free report[1] by KASAN.
    
    In __scsi_scan_target(), when a type 31 device is probed,
    SCSI_SCAN_TARGET_PRESENT is returned and the target will be scanned
    again.
    
    Inside the following scsi_report_lun_scan(), one new scsi_device
    instance is allocated, and scsi_probe_and_add_lun() is called again to
    probe the target and still see type 31 device, finally
    __scsi_remove_device() is called to remove & free the device at the end
    of scsi_probe_and_add_lun(), so cause use-after-free in
    scsi_report_lun_scan().
    
    And the following SCSI log can be observed:
    
            scsi 0:0:2:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY pass 1 length 36
            scsi 0:0:2:0: scsi scan: INQUIRY successful with code 0x0
            scsi 0:0:2:0: scsi scan: peripheral device type of 31, no device added

            scsi 0:0:2:0: scsi scan: REPORT LUNS successful (try 0) result 0x0

            BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __scsi_scan_target+0xbf8/0xe40 at addr ffff88007b44a104
    
    This patch fixes the issue by moving the putting reference at
    the end of scsi_report_lun_scan().

    [ Upstream commit 3f2d26643595973e835e8356ea90c7c15cb1b0f1 ]
    
    Commit f68381a70bb2 (mmc: block: fix packed command header endianness)
    correctly fixed endianness handling of packed_cmd_hdr in
    mmc_blk_packed_hdr_wrq_prep.
    
    But now, sparse complains about incorrect types:
    drivers/mmc/card/block.c:1613:27: sparse: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
    drivers/mmc/card/block.c:1613:27:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [usertype] <noident>
    drivers/mmc/card/block.c:1613:27:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>
    ...
    
    So annotate cmd_hdr properly using __le32 to make everyone happy.

    x86/mm: Expand the exception table logic to allow new handling options
    
    [ Upstream commit 548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840 ]
    
    Huge amounts of help from  Andy Lutomirski and Borislav Petkov to
    produce this. Andy provided the inspiration to add classes to the
    exception table with a clever bit-squeezing trick, Boris pointed
    out how much cleaner it would all be if we just had a new field.
    
    Linus Torvalds blessed the expansion with:
    
      ' I'd rather not be clever in order to save just a tiny amount of space
        in the exception table, which isn't really criticial for anybody. '
    
    The third field is another relative function pointer, this one to a
    handler that executes the actions.
    
    We start out with three handlers:
    
     1: Legacy - just jumps the to fixup IP
     2: Fault - provide the trap number in %ax to the fixup code
     3: Cleaned up legacy for the uaccess error hack
