    media: v4l: event: Prevent freeing event subscriptions while accessed
    
    commit ad608fbcf166fec809e402d548761768f602702c upstream.
    
    The event subscriptions are added to the subscribed event list while
    holding a spinlock, but that lock is subsequently released while still
    accessing the subscription object. This makes it possible to unsubscribe
    the event --- and freeing the subscription object's memory --- while
    the subscription object is simultaneously accessed.
    
    Prevent this by adding a mutex to serialise the event subscription and
    unsubscription. This also gives a guarantee to the callback ops that the
    add op has returned before the del op is called.
    
    This change also results in making the elems field less special:
    subscriptions are only added to the event list once they are fully
    initialised.

    arm64: KVM: Sanitize PSTATE.M when being set from userspace
    
    commit 2a3f93459d689d990b3ecfbe782fec89b97d3279 upstream.
    
    Not all execution modes are valid for a guest, and some of them
    depend on what the HW actually supports. Let's verify that what
    userspace provides is compatible with both the VM settings and
    the HW capabilities.

    i2c: i801: Allow ACPI AML access I/O ports not reserved for SMBus
    
    [ Upstream commit 7fd6d98b89f382d414e1db528e29a67bbd749457 ]
    
    Commit 7ae81952cda ("i2c: i801: Allow ACPI SystemIO OpRegion to conflict
    with PCI BAR") made it possible for AML code to access SMBus I/O ports
    by installing custom SystemIO OpRegion handler and blocking i80i driver
    access upon first AML read/write to this OpRegion.
    
    However, while ThinkPad T560 does have SystemIO OpRegion declared under
    the SMBus device, it does not access any of the SMBus registers:
    
        Device (SMBU)
        {
            ...
    
            OperationRegion (SMBP, PCI_Config, 0x50, 0x04)
            Field (SMBP, DWordAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
            {
                ,   5,
                TCOB,   11,
                Offset (0x04)
            }
    
            Name (TCBV, 0x00)
            Method (TCBS, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                If ((TCBV == 0x00))
                {
                TCBV = (\_SB.PCI0.SMBU.TCOB << 0x05)
                }
    
                Return (TCBV) /* \_SB_.PCI0.SMBU.TCBV */
            }
    
            OperationRegion (TCBA, SystemIO, TCBS (), 0x10)
            Field (TCBA, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
            {
                Offset (0x04),
                ,   9,
                CPSC,   1
            }
        }
    
    Problem with the current approach is that it blocks all I/O port access
    and because this system has touchpad connected to the SMBus controller
    after first AML access (happens during suspend/resume cycle) the
    touchpad fails to work anymore.
    
    Fix this so that we allow ACPI AML I/O port access if it does not touch
    the region reserved for the SMBus.

    arm/arm64: smccc-1.1: Handle function result as parameters
    
    [ Upstream commit 755a8bf5579d22eb5636685c516d8dede799e27b ]
    
    If someone has the silly idea to write something along those lines:
    
            extern u64 foo(void);
    
            void bar(struct arm_smccc_res *res)
            {
                    arm_smccc_1_1_smc(0xbad, foo(), res);
            }
    
    they are in for a surprise, as this gets compiled as:
    
            0000000000000588 <bar>:
             588:   a9be7bfd        stp     x29, x30, [sp, #-32]!
             58c:   910003fd        mov     x29, sp
             590:   f9000bf3        str     x19, [sp, #16]
             594:   aa0003f3        mov     x19, x0
             598:   aa1e03e0        mov     x0, x30
             59c:   94000000        bl      0 <_mcount>
             5a0:   94000000        bl      0 <foo>
             5a4:   aa0003e1        mov     x1, x0
             5a8:   d4000003        smc     #0x0
             5ac:   b4000073        cbz     x19, 5b8 <bar+0x30>
             5b0:   a9000660        stp     x0, x1, [x19]
             5b4:   a9010e62        stp     x2, x3, [x19, #16]
             5b8:   f9400bf3        ldr     x19, [sp, #16]
             5bc:   a8c27bfd        ldp     x29, x30, [sp], #32
             5c0:   d65f03c0        ret
             5c4:   d503201f        nop
    
    The call to foo "overwrites" the x0 register for the return value,
    and we end up calling the wrong secure service.
    
    A solution is to evaluate all the parameters before assigning
    anything to specific registers, leading to the expected result:
    
            0000000000000588 <bar>:
             588:   a9be7bfd        stp     x29, x30, [sp, #-32]!

             598:   aa1e03e0        mov     x0, x30

    arm/arm64: smccc-1.1: Make return values unsigned long
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d8f574708a3fb6f18c85486d0c5217df893c0cf ]
    
    An unfortunate consequence of having a strong typing for the input
    values to the SMC call is that it also affects the type of the
    return values, limiting r0 to 32 bits and r{1,2,3} to whatever
    was passed as an input.
    
    Let's turn everything into "unsigned long", which satisfies the
    requirements of both architectures, and allows for the full
    range of return values.

    but amount of reserved/consumed bytes in memory.
    
    For instance, if we use a single byte in last page fragment, we have to

    So skb_add_rx_frag needs to calculate the length of the entire buffer into

    thermal: of-thermal: disable passive polling when thermal zone is disabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 152395fd03d4ce1e535a75cdbf58105e50587611 ]
    
    When thermal zone is in passive mode, disabling its mode from
    sysfs is NOT taking effect at all, it is still polling the
    temperature of the disabled thermal zone and handling all thermal
    trips, it makes user confused. The disabling operation should
    disable the thermal zone behavior completely, for both active and
    passive mode, this patch clears the passive_delay when thermal
    zone is disabled and restores it when it is enabled.

    qed: Wait for MCP halt and resume commands to take place
    
    [ Upstream commit 76271809f49056f079e202bf6513d17b0d6dd34d ]
    
    Successive iterations of halting and resuming the management chip (MCP)
    might fail, since currently the driver doesn't wait for these operations to
    actually take place.
    This patch prevents the driver from moving forward before the operations
    are reflected in the state register.

    [ Upstream commit f00d25f3154b676fcea4502a25b94bd7f142ca74 ]
    
    The MFW might be reset and re-update its shared memory.
    Upon the detection of such a reset the driver rereads this memory, but it
    has to wait till the data is valid.
    This patch adds the missing wait for a data ready indication.

    ext4: never move the system.data xattr out of the inode body
    
    commit 8cdb5240ec5928b20490a2bb34cb87e9a5f40226 upstream.
    
    When expanding the extra isize space, we must never move the
    system.data xattr out of the inode body.  For performance reasons, it
    doesn't make any sense, and the inline data implementation assumes
    that system.data xattr is never in the external xattr block.

    arm64: KVM: Tighten guest core register access from userspace
    
    commit d26c25a9d19b5976b319af528886f89cf455692d upstream.
    
    We currently allow userspace to access the core register file
    in about any possible way, including straddling multiple
    registers and doing unaligned accesses.
    
    This is not the expected use of the ABI, and nobody is actually
    using it that way. Let's tighten it by explicitly checking
    the size and alignment for each field of the register file.

    IB/hfi1: Fix context recovery when PBC has an UnsupportedVL
    
    commit d623500b3c4efd8d4e945ac9003c6b87b469a9ab upstream.
    
    If a packet stream uses an UnsupportedVL (virtual lane), the send
    engine will not send the packet, and it will not indicate that an
    error has occurred.  This will cause the packet stream to block.
    
    HFI has 8 virtual lanes available for packet streams.  Each lane can
    be enabled or disabled using the UnsupportedVL mask.  If a lane is
    disabled, adding a packet to the send context must be disallowed.
    
    The current mask for determining unsupported VLs defaults to 0 (allow
    all).  This is incorrect.  Only the VLs that are defined should be
    allowed.
    
    Determine which VLs are disabled (mtu == 0), and set the appropriate
    unsupported bit in the mask.  The correct mask will allow the send
    engine to error on the invalid VL, and error recovery will work
    correctly.

    In the panic case, the slab entry had been allocated but not inited.
    
    Fix the issue by exiting through free_tx thus avoiding sdma_clean().

    USB: remove LPM management from usb_driver_claim_interface()
    
    commit c183813fcee44a249339b7c46e1ad271ca1870aa upstream.
    
    usb_driver_claim_interface() disables and re-enables Link Power
    Management, but it shouldn't do either one, for the reasons listed
    below.  This patch removes the two LPM-related function calls from the
    routine.
    
    The reason for disabling LPM in the analogous function
    usb_probe_interface() is so that drivers won't have to deal with
    unwanted LPM transitions in their probe routine.  But
    usb_driver_claim_interface() doesn't call the driver's probe routine
    (or any other callbacks), so that reason doesn't apply here.
    
    Furthermore, no driver other than usbfs will ever call
    usb_driver_claim_interface() unless it is already bound to another
    interface in the same device, which means disabling LPM here would be
    redundant.  usbfs doesn't interact with LPM at all.
    
    Lastly, the error return from usb_unlocked_disable_lpm() isn't handled
    properly; the code doesn't clean up its earlier actions before
    returning.

    media: uvcvideo: Support realtek's UVC 1.5 device
    
    commit f620d1d7afc7db57ab59f35000752840c91f67e7 upstream.
    
    media: uvcvideo: Support UVC 1.5 video probe & commit controls
    
    The length of UVC 1.5 video control is 48, and it is 34 for UVC 1.1.
    Change it to 48 for UVC 1.5 device, and the UVC 1.5 device can be
    recognized.
    
    More changes to the driver are needed for full UVC 1.5 compatibility.
    However, at least the UVC 1.5 Realtek RTS5847/RTS5852 cameras have been
    reported to work well.

    USB: handle NULL config in usb_find_alt_setting()
    
    commit c9a4cb204e9eb7fa7dfbe3f7d3a674fa530aa193 upstream.
    
    usb_find_alt_setting() takes a pointer to a struct usb_host_config as
    an argument; it searches for an interface with specified interface and
    alternate setting numbers in that config.  However, it crashes if the
    usb_host_config pointer argument is NULL.
    
    Since this is a general-purpose routine, available for use in many
    places, we want to to be more robust.  This patch makes it return NULL
    whenever the config argument is NULL.

    USB: fix error handling in usb_driver_claim_interface()
    
    commit bd729f9d67aa9a303d8925bb8c4f06af25f407d1 upstream.
    
    The syzbot fuzzing project found a use-after-free bug in the USB
    core.  The bug was caused by usbfs not unbinding from an interface
    when the USB device file was closed, which led another process to
    attempt the unbind later on, after the private data structure had been
    deallocated.
    
    The reason usbfs did not unbind the interface at the appropriate time
    was because it thought the interface had never been claimed in the
    first place.  This was caused by the fact that
    usb_driver_claim_interface() does not clean up properly when
    device_bind_driver() returns an error.  Although the error code gets
    passed back to the caller, the iface->dev.driver pointer remains set
    and iface->condition remains equal to USB_INTERFACE_BOUND.
    
    This patch adds proper error handling to usb_driver_claim_interface().

    spi: rspi: Fix interrupted DMA transfers
    
    commit 8dbbaa47b96f6ea5f09f922b4effff3c505cd8cf upstream.
    
    When interrupted, wait_event_interruptible_timeout() returns
    -ERESTARTSYS, and the SPI transfer in progress will fail, as expected:
    
        m25p80 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -512
        spi_master spi0: failed to transfer one message from queue
    
    However, as the underlying DMA transfers may not have completed, all
    subsequent SPI transfers may start to fail:
    
        spi_master spi0: receive timeout
        qspi_transfer_out_in() returned -110
        m25p80 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -110
        spi_master spi0: failed to transfer one message from queue
    
    Fix this by calling dmaengine_terminate_all() not only for timeouts, but
    also for errors.
    
    This can be reproduced on r8a7991/koelsch, using "hd /dev/mtd0" followed

    commit 3216c622a24b0ebb9c159a8d1daf7f17a106b3f5 upstream.
    
    The function tty_port_tty_get() gets a reference to the tty. Since
    the code is not using tty_port_tty_set(), the reference is kept
    even after closing the tty.
    
    Avoid using tty_port_tty_get() by directly access the tty instance.
    Since lpuart_start_rx_dma() is called from the .startup() and
    .set_termios() callback, it is safe to assume the tty instance is
    valid.

    floppy: Do not copy a kernel pointer to user memory in FDGETPRM ioctl
    
    commit 65eea8edc315589d6c993cf12dbb5d0e9ef1fe4e upstream.
    
    The final field of a floppy_struct is the field "name", which is a pointer
    to a string in kernel memory.  The kernel pointer should not be copied to
    user memory.  The FDGETPRM ioctl copies a floppy_struct to user memory,
    including this "name" field.  This pointer cannot be used by the user
    and it will leak a kernel address to user-space, which will reveal the
    location of kernel code and data and undermine KASLR protection.
    
    Model this code after the compat ioctl which copies the returned data
    to a previously cleared temporary structure on the stack (excluding the
    name pointer) and copy out to userspace from there.  As we already have
    an inparam union with an appropriate member and that memory is already
    cleared even for read only calls make use of that as a temporary store.
    
    Based on an initial patch by Brian Belleville.

    module: exclude SHN_UNDEF symbols from kallsyms api
    
    [ Upstream commit 9f2d1e68cf4d641def734adaccfc3823d3575e6c ]
    
    Livepatch modules are special in that we preserve their entire symbol
    tables in order to be able to apply relocations after module load. The
    unwanted side effect of this is that undefined (SHN_UNDEF) symbols of
    livepatch modules are accessible via the kallsyms api and this can
    confuse symbol resolution in livepatch (klp_find_object_symbol()) and
    cause subtle bugs in livepatch.
    
    Have the module kallsyms api skip over SHN_UNDEF symbols. These symbols
    are usually not available for normal modules anyway as we cut down their
    symbol tables to just the core (non-undefined) symbols, so this should
    really just affect livepatch modules. Note that this patch doesn't
    affect the display of undefined symbols in /proc/kallsyms.

    perf/x86/intel/lbr: Fix incomplete LBR call stack
    
    [ Upstream commit 0592e57b24e7e05ec1f4c50b9666c013abff7017 ]
    
    LBR has a limited stack size. If a task has a deeper call stack than
    LBR's stack size, only the overflowed part is reported. A complete call
    stack may not be reconstructed by perf tool.
    
    Current code doesn't access all LBR registers. It only read the ones
    below the TOS. The LBR registers above the TOS will be discarded
    unconditionally.
    
    When a CALL is captured, the TOS is incremented by 1 , modulo max LBR
    stack size. The LBR HW only records the call stack information to the
    register which the TOS points to. It will not touch other LBR
    registers. So the registers above the TOS probably still store the valid
    call stack information for an overflowed call stack, which need to be
    reported.
    
    To retrieve complete call stack information, we need to start from TOS,
    read all LBR registers until an invalid entry is detected.
    0s can be used to detect the invalid entry, because:
    
     - When a RET is captured, the HW zeros the LBR register which TOS points
       to, then decreases the TOS.
     - The LBR registers are reset to 0 when adding a new LBR event or
       scheduling an existing LBR event.
     - A taken branch at IP 0 is not expected
    
    The context switch code is also modified to save/restore all valid LBR
    registers. Furthermore, the LBR registers, which don't have valid call
    stack information, need to be reset in restore, because they may be
    polluted while swapped out.
    
    Here is a small test program, tchain_deep.
    Its call stack is deeper than 32.
    
     noinline void f33(void)
     {
            int i;
    
            for (i = 0; i < 10000000;) {
                    if (i%2)
                            i++;
                    else
                            i++;
            }
     }
    
     noinline void f32(void)
     {
            f33();
     }
    
     noinline void f31(void)
     {
            f32();
     }
    
     ... ...
    
     noinline void f1(void)
     {
            f2();
     }
    
     int main()
     {
            f1();
     }
    
    Here is the test result on SKX. The max stack size of SKX is 32.

    ARM: mvebu: declare asm symbols as character arrays in pmsu.c
    
    [ Upstream commit d0d378ff451a66e486488eec842e507d28145813 ]
    
    With CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, memcpy uses the declared size of operands to
    detect buffer overflows.  If src or dest is declared as a char, attempts to
    copy more than byte will result in a fortify_panic().
    
    Address this problem in mvebu_setup_boot_addr_wa() by declaring
    mvebu_boot_wa_start and mvebu_boot_wa_end as character arrays.  Also remove
    a couple addressof operators to avoid "arithmetic on pointer to an
    incomplete type" compiler error.
    
    See commit 54a7d50b9205 ("x86: mark kprobe templates as character arrays,
    not single characters") for a similar fix.
    
    Fixes "detected buffer overflow in memcpy" error during init on some mvebu
    systems (armada-370-xp, armada-375):
    
    (fortify_panic) from (mvebu_setup_boot_addr_wa+0xb0/0xb4)
    (mvebu_setup_boot_addr_wa) from (mvebu_v7_cpu_pm_init+0x154/0x204)

    rndis_wlan: potential buffer overflow in rndis_wlan_auth_indication()
    
    [ Upstream commit ae636fb1554833ee5133ca47bf4b2791b6739c52 ]
    
    This is a static checker fix, not something I have tested.  The issue
    is that on the second iteration through the loop, we jump forward by
    le32_to_cpu(auth_req->length) bytes.  The problem is that if the length
    is more than "buflen" then we end up with a negative "buflen".  A
    negative buflen is type promoted to a high positive value and the loop
    continues but it's accessing beyond the end of the buffer.
    
    I believe the "auth_req->length" comes from the firmware and if the
    firmware is malicious or buggy, you're already toasted so the impact of
    this bug is probably not very severe.

    Since a phy_device is added to the global mdio_bus list during

    [ Upstream commit 168f75f11fe68455e0d058a818ebccfc329d8685 ]
    
    While debugging driver crashes related to a buggy firmware
    crashing under load, I noticed that ath10k_htt_rx_ring_free
    could be called without being under lock.  I'm not sure if this
    is the root cause of the crash or not, but it seems prudent to
    protect it.
    
    Originally tested on 4.16+ kernel with ath10k-ct 10.4 firmware
    running on 9984 NIC.

    [ Upstream commit 8632c614565d0c5fdde527889601c018e97b6384 ]
    
    The ashmem driver did not check that the size/offset of the vma passed
    to its .mmap() function was not larger than the ashmem object being
    mapped. This could cause mmap() to succeed, even though accessing parts
    of the mapping would later fail with a segmentation fault.
    
    Ensure an error is returned by the ashmem_mmap() function if the vma
    size is larger than the ashmem object size. This enables safer handling
    of the problem in userspace.

    media: omap3isp: zero-initialize the isp cam_xclk{a,b} initial data
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ec7debd44b49927a6e2861521994cc075a389ed ]
    
    The struct clk_init_data init variable is declared in the isp_xclk_init()
    function so is an automatic variable allocated in the stack. But it's not
    explicitly zero-initialized, so some init fields are left uninitialized.
    
    This causes the data structure to have undefined values that may confuse
    the common clock framework when the clock is registered.
    
    For example, the uninitialized .flags field could have the CLK_IS_CRITICAL
    bit set, causing the framework to wrongly prepare the clk on registration.
    This leads to the isp_xclk_prepare() callback being called, which in turn
    calls to the omap3isp_get() function that increments the isp dev refcount.
    
    Since this omap3isp_get() call is unexpected, this leads to an unbalanced
    omap3isp_get() call that prevents the requested IRQ to be later enabled,
    due the refcount not being 0 when the correct omap3isp_get() call happens.

    media: soc_camera: ov772x: correct setting of banding filter
    
    [ Upstream commit 22216ec41e919682c15345e95928f266e8ba6f9e ]
    
    The banding filter ON/OFF is controlled via bit 5 of COM8 register.  It
    is attempted to be enabled in ov772x_set_params() by the following line.
    
            ret = ov772x_mask_set(client, COM8, BNDF_ON_OFF, 1);
    
    But this unexpectedly results disabling the banding filter, because the
    mask and set bits are exclusive.
    
    On the other hand, ov772x_s_ctrl() correctly sets the bit by:
    
            ret = ov772x_mask_set(client, COM8, BNDF_ON_OFF, BNDF_ON_OFF);
    
    The same fix was already applied to non-soc_camera version of ov772x
    driver in the commit commit a024ee14cd36 ("media: ov772x: correct setting
    of banding filter")

      strncat(seg->res_name, " (DCSS)", 7);
    
    What gcc complains about here is the misuse of strncat function, which
    in this case does not limit a number of bytes taken from "src", so it is
    in the end the same as strcat(seg->res_name, " (DCSS)");
    
    Keeping in mind that a res_name is 15 bytes, strncat in this case
    would overflow the buffer and write 0 into alignment byte between the
    fields in the struct. To avoid that increasing res_name size to 16,
    and reusing strlcat.

    powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Reduce upper limit for DMA window size
    
    [ Upstream commit d3d4ffaae439981e1e441ebb125aa3588627c5d8 ]
    
    We use PHB in mode1 which uses bit 59 to select a correct DMA window.
    However there is mode2 which uses bits 59:55 and allows up to 32 DMA
    windows per a PE.
    
    Even though documentation does not clearly specify that, it seems that
    the actual hardware does not support bits 59:55 even in mode1, in other
    words we can create a window as big as 1<<58 but DMA simply won't work.
    
    This reduces the upper limit from 59 to 55 bits to let the userspace know
    about the hardware limits.

    scsi: ibmvscsi: Improve strings handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 1262dc09dc9ae7bf4ad00b6a2c5ed6a6936bcd10 ]
    
    Currently an open firmware property is copied into partition_name variable
    without keeping a room for \0.
    
    Later one, this variable (partition_name), which is 97 bytes long, is
    strncpyed into ibmvcsci_host_data->madapter_info->partition_name, which is
    96 bytes long, possibly truncating it 'again' and removing the \0.
    
    This patch simply decreases the partition name to 96 and just copy using
    strlcpy() which guarantees that the string is \0 terminated. I think there
    is no issue if this there is a truncation in this very first copy, i.e,
    when the open firmware property is read and copied into the driver for the
    very first time;
    
    This issue also causes the following warning on GCC 8:
    
            drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi/ibmvscsi.c:281:2: warning:  strncpy  output may be truncated copying 96 bytes from a string of length 96 [-Wstringop-truncation]

    x86/entry/64: Add two more instruction suffixes
    
    [ Upstream commit 6709812f094d96543b443645c68daaa32d3d3e77 ]
    
    Sadly, other than claimed in:
    
      a368d7fd2a ("x86/entry/64: Add instruction suffix")
    
    ... there are two more instances which want to be adjusted.
    
    As said there, omitting suffixes from instructions in AT&T mode is bad
    practice when operand size cannot be determined by the assembler from
    register operands, and is likely going to be warned about by upstream
    gas in the future (mine does already).
    
    Add the other missing suffixes here as well.

    ARM: hwmod: RTC: Don't assume lock/unlock will be called with irq enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d609b35c815ba20132b7b64bcca04516bb17c56 ]
    
    When the RTC lock and unlock functions were introduced it was likely
    assumed that they would always be called from irq enabled context, hence
    the use of local_irq_disable/enable. This is no longer true as the
    RTC+DDR path makes a late call during the suspend path after irqs
    have been disabled to enable the RTC hwmod which calls both unlock and
    lock, leading to IRQs being reenabled through the local_irq_enable call
    in omap_hwmod_rtc_lock call.
    
    To avoid this change the local_irq_disable/enable to
    local_irq_save/restore to ensure that from whatever context this is
    called the proper IRQ configuration is maintained.

    md-cluster: clear another node's suspend_area after the copy is finished
    
    [ Upstream commit 010228e4a932ca1e8365e3b58c8e1e44c16ff793 ]
    
    When one node leaves cluster or stops the resyncing
    (resync or recovery) array, then other nodes need to
    call recover_bitmaps to continue the unfinished task.
    
    But we need to clear suspend_area later after other
    nodes copy the resync information to their bitmap
    (by call bitmap_copy_from_slot). Otherwise, all nodes
    could write to the suspend_area even the suspend_area
    is not handled by any node, because area_resyncing
    returns 0 at the beginning of raid1_write_request.
    Which means one node could write suspend_area while
    another node is resyncing the same area, then data
    could be inconsistent.
    
    So let's clear suspend_area later to avoid above issue
    with the protection of bm lock. Also it is straightforward
    to clear suspend_area after nodes have copied the resync
    info to bitmap.

    power: remove possible deadlock when unregistering power_supply

    If a device gets removed right after having registered a power_supply node,
    we might enter in a deadlock between the remove call (that has a lock on
    the parent device) and the deferred register work.
    
    Allow the deferred register work to exit without taking the lock when
    we are in the remove state.

    s390/mm: correct allocate_pgste proc_handler callback
    
    [ Upstream commit 5bedf8aa03c28cb8dc98bdd32a41b66d8f7d3eaa ]
    
    Since proc_dointvec does not perform value range control,
    proc_dointvec_minmax should be used to limit value range, which is
    clearly intended here, as the internal representation of the value:
    
    unsigned int alloc_pgste:1;
    
    In fact it currently works, since we have
    
          mm->context.alloc_pgste = page_table_allocate_pgste || ...
    
    ... since commit 23fefe119ceb5 ("s390/kvm: avoid global config of vm.alloc_pgste=1")
    
    Before that it was
    
           mm->context.alloc_pgste = page_table_allocate_pgste;
    
    which was broken. That was introduced with commit 0b46e0a3ec0d7 ("s390/kvm:
    remove delayed reallocation of page tables for KVM").

    6lowpan: iphc: reset mac_header after decompress to fix panic
    
    [ Upstream commit 03bc05e1a4972f73b4eb8907aa373369e825c252 ]
    
    After decompression of 6lowpan socket data, an IPv6 header is inserted
    before the existing socket payload.  After this, we reset the
    network_header value of the skb to account for the difference in payload
    size from prior to decompression + the addition of the IPv6 header.
    
    However, we fail to reset the mac_header value.
    
    Leaving the mac_header value untouched here, can cause a calculation
    error in net/packet/af_packet.c packet_rcv() function when an
    AF_PACKET socket is opened in SOCK_RAW mode for use on a 6lowpan
    interface.
    
    On line 2088, the data pointer is moved backward by the value returned
    from skb_mac_header().  If skb->data is adjusted so that it is before
    the skb->head pointer (which can happen when an old value of mac_header
    is left in place) the kernel generates a panic in net/core/skbuff.c
    line 1717.
    
    This panic can be generated by BLE 6lowpan interfaces (such as bt0) and
    802.15.4 interfaces (such as lowpan0) as they both use the same 6lowpan
    sources for compression and decompression.

    power: vexpress: fix corruption in notifier registration
    
    [ Upstream commit 09bebb1adb21ecd04adf7ccb3b06f73e3a851e93 ]
    
    Vexpress platforms provide two different restart handlers: SYS_REBOOT
    that restart the entire system, while DB_RESET only restarts the
    daughter board containing the CPU. DB_RESET is overridden by SYS_REBOOT
    if it exists.
    
    notifier_chain_register used in register_restart_handler by design
    relies on notifiers to be registered once only, however vexpress restart
    notifier can get registered twice. When this happen it corrupts list
    of notifiers, as result some notifiers can be not called on proper
    event, traverse on list can be cycled forever, and second unregister
    can access already freed memory.
    
    So far, since this was the only restart handler in the system, no issue
    was observed even if the same notifier was registered twice. However
    commit 6c5c0d48b686 ("watchdog: sp805: add restart handler") added
    support for SP805 restart handlers and since the system under test
    contains two vexpress restart and two SP805 watchdog instances, it was
    observed that during the boot traversing the restart handler list looped
    forever as there's a cycle in that list resulting in boot hang.
    
    This patch fixes the issues by ensuring that the notifier is installed
    only once.

    ADC channel 0 photodiode detects both infrared + visible light,
    but ADC channel 1 just detects infrared. However, the latter is a bit
    more sensitive in that range so complete darkness or low light causes
    a error condition in which the chan0 - chan1 is negative that
    results in a -EAGAIN.
    
    This patch changes the resulting lux1_input sysfs attribute message from
    "Resource temporarily unavailable" to a user-grokable lux value of 0.
