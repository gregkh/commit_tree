    platform_get_irq: Revert to platform_get_resource if of_irq_get fails
    
    commit aff008ad813c7cf3cfe7b532e7ba2c526c136f22 upstream.
    
    Commits 9ec36ca (of/irq: do irq resolution in platform_get_irq)
    and ad69674 (of/irq: do irq resolution in platform_get_irq_byname)
    change the semantics of platform_get_irq and platform_get_irq_byname
    to always rely on devicetree information if devicetree is enabled
    and if a devicetree node is attached to the device. The functions
    now return an error if the devicetree data does not include interrupt
    information, even if the information is available as platform resource
    data.
    
    This causes mfd client drivers to fail if the interrupt number is
    passed via platform resources. Therefore, if of_irq_get fails, try
    platform_get_resource as method of last resort. This restores the
    original functionality for drivers depending on platform resources
    to get irq information.

    mm: do not call do_fault_around for non-linear fault
    
    commit c118678bc79e8241f9d3434d9324c6400d72f48a upstream.
    
    Ingo Korb reported that "repeated mapping of the same file on tmpfs
    using remap_file_pages sometimes triggers a BUG at mm/filemap.c:202 when
    the process exits".
    
    He bisected the bug to d7c1755179b8 ("mm: implement ->map_pages for
    shmem/tmpfs"), although the bug was actually added by commit
    8c6e50b0290c ("mm: introduce vm_ops->map_pages()").
    
    The problem is caused by calling do_fault_around for a _non-linear_
    fault.  In this case pgoff is shifted and might become negative during
    calculation.
    
    Faulting around non-linear page-fault makes no sense and breaks the
    logic in do_fault_around because pgoff is shifted.

    hwrng: virtio - ensure reads happen after successful probe
    
    commit e052dbf554610e2104c5a7518c4d8374bed701bb upstream.
    
    The hwrng core asks for random data in the hwrng_register() call itself
    from commit d9e7972619.  This doesn't play well with virtio -- the
    DRIVER_OK bit is only set by virtio core on a successful probe, and
    we're not yet out of our probe routine when this call is made.  This
    causes the host to not acknowledge any requests we put in the virtqueue,
    and the insmod or kernel boot process just waits for data to arrive from
    the host, which never happens.

    Fix gcc-4.9.0 miscompilation of load_balance() in scheduler
    
    commit 2062afb4f804afef61cbe62a30cac9a46e58e067 upstream.
    
    Michel Dänzer and a couple of other people reported inexplicable random
    oopses in the scheduler, and the cause turns out to be gcc mis-compiling
    the load_balance() function when debugging is enabled.  The gcc bug
    apparently goes back to gcc-4.5, but slight optimization changes means
    that it now showed up as a problem in 4.9.0 and 4.9.1.
    
    The instruction scheduling problem causes gcc to schedule a spill
    operation to before the stack frame has been created, which in turn can
    corrupt the spilled value if an interrupt comes in.  There may be other
    effects of this bug too, but that's the code generation problem seen in
    Michel's case.
    
    This is fixed in current gcc HEAD, but the workaround as suggested by
    Markus Trippelsdorf is pretty simple: use -fno-var-tracking-assignments
    when compiling the kernel, which disables the gcc code that causes the
    problem.  This can result in slightly worse debug information for
    variable accesses, but that is infinitely preferable to actual code
    generation problems.
    
    Doing this unconditionally (not just for CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO) also allows
    non-debug builds to verify that the debug build would be identical: we
    can do
    
        export GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG=1
    
    to make gcc internally verify that the result of the build is
    independent of the "-g" flag (it will make the compiler build everything
    twice, toggling the debug flag, and compare the results).
    
    Without the "-fno-var-tracking-assignments" option, the build would fail
    (even with 4.8.3 that didn't show the actual stack frame bug) with a gcc
    compare failure.

    mm: hugetlb: fix copy_hugetlb_page_range()
    
    commit 0253d634e0803a8376a0d88efee0bf523d8673f9 upstream.
    
    Commit 4a705fef9862 ("hugetlb: fix copy_hugetlb_page_range() to handle
    migration/hwpoisoned entry") changed the order of
    huge_ptep_set_wrprotect() and huge_ptep_get(), which leads to breakage
    in some workloads like hugepage-backed heap allocation via libhugetlbfs.
    This patch fixes it.
    
    The test program for the problem is shown below:
    
      $ cat heap.c
      #include <unistd.h>
      #include <stdlib.h>
      #include <string.h>
    
      #define HPS 0x200000
    
      int main() {
            int i;
            char *p = malloc(HPS);
            memset(p, '1', HPS);
            for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    if (!fork()) {
                            memset(p, '2', HPS);
                            p = malloc(HPS);
                            memset(p, '3', HPS);
                            free(p);
                            return 0;
                    }
            }
            sleep(1);
            free(p);
            return 0;
      }
    
      $ export HUGETLB_MORECORE=yes ; export HUGETLB_NO_PREFAULT= ; hugectl --heap ./heap
    
    Fixes 4a705fef9862 ("hugetlb: fix copy_hugetlb_page_range() to handle
    migration/hwpoisoned entry"), so is applicable to -stable kernels which
    include it.

    x86_32, entry: Store badsys error code in %eax
    
    commit 8142b215501f8b291a108a202b3a053a265b03dd upstream.
    
    Commit 554086d ("x86_32, entry: Do syscall exit work on badsys
    (CVE-2014-4508)") introduced a regression in the x86_32 syscall entry
    code, resulting in syscall() not returning proper errors for undefined
    syscalls on CPUs supporting the sysenter feature.
    
    The following code:
    
    > int result = syscall(666);
    > printf("result=%d errno=%d error=%s\n", result, errno, strerror(errno));
    
    results in:
    
    > result=666 errno=0 error=Success
    
    Obviously, the syscall return value is the called syscall number, but it
    should have been an ENOSYS error. When run under ptrace it behaves
    correctly, which makes it hard to debug in the wild:
    
    > result=-1 errno=38 error=Function not implemented
    
    The %eax register is the return value register. For debugging via ptrace
    the syscall entry code stores the complete register context on the
    stack. The badsys handlers only store the ENOSYS error code in the
    ptrace register set and do not set %eax like a regular syscall handler
    would. The old resume_userspace call chain contains code that clobbers
    %eax and it restores %eax from the ptrace registers afterwards. The same
    goes for the ptrace-enabled call chain. When ptrace is not used, the
    syscall return value is the passed-in syscall number from the untouched
    %eax register.
    
    Use %eax as the return value register in syscall_badsys and
    sysenter_badsys, like a real syscall handler does, and have the caller
    push the value onto the stack for ptrace access.

    Temperature limit clamps are applied after converting the temperature

    to be specified in degrees C, not milli-degrees C, or clamping must
    happen before converting to degrees C. Use the latter method to avoid
    overflows.
    
    vrm is an u8, so the written value needs to be limited to [0, 255].

    pinctrl: st: Fix irqmux handler
    
    commit 7a2deccf0ef12f7f6e33150d5875020c0c94fa94 upstream.
    
    st_gpio_irqmux_handler() reads the status register to find out
    which banks inside the controller have pending IRQs.
    For each banks having pending IRQs, it calls the corresponding handler.
    
    Problem is that current code restricts the number of possible banks inside the
    controller to ST_GPIO_PINS_PER_BANK. This define represents the number of pins
    inside a bank, so it shouldn't be used here.
    
    On STiH407, PIO_FRONT0 controller has 10 banks, so IRQs pending in the two
    last banks (PIO18 & PIO19) aren't handled.
    
    This patch replace ST_GPIO_PINS_PER_BANK by the number of banks inside the
    controller.

    coredump: fix the setting of PF_DUMPCORE
    
    commit aed8adb7688d5744cb484226820163af31d2499a upstream.
    
    Commit 079148b919d0 ("coredump: factor out the setting of PF_DUMPCORE")
    cleaned up the setting of PF_DUMPCORE by removing it from all the
    linux_binfmt->core_dump() and moving it to zap_threads().But this ended
    up clearing all the previously set flags.  This causes issues during
    core generation when tsk->flags is checked again (eg.  for PF_USED_MATH
    to dump floating point registers).  Fix this.

    Input: fix defuzzing logic
    
    commit 50c5d36dab930b1f1b1e3348b8608aa8b9ee7610 upstream.
    
    We attempt to remove noise from coordinates reported by devices in
    input_handle_abs_event(), unfortunately, unless we were dropping the
    event altogether, we were ignoring the adjusted value and were passing
    on the original value instead.

    slab_common: fix the check for duplicate slab names
    
    commit 694617474e33b8603fc76e090ed7d09376514b1a upstream.
    
    The patch 3e374919b314f20e2a04f641ebc1093d758f66a4 is supposed to fix the
    problem where kmem_cache_create incorrectly reports duplicate cache name
    and fails. The problem is described in the header of that patch.
    
    However, the patch doesn't really fix the problem because of these
    reasons:
    
    * the logic to test for debugging is reversed. It was intended to perform
      the check only if slub debugging is enabled (which implies that caches
      with the same parameters are not merged). Therefore, there should be
      #if !defined(CONFIG_SLUB) || defined(CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON)
      The current code has the condition reversed and performs the test if
      debugging is disabled.
    
    * slub debugging may be enabled or disabled based on kernel command line,
      CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON is just the default settings. Therefore the test
      based on definition of CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON is unreliable.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by removing the test
    "!defined(CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON)". Therefore, duplicate names are never
    checked if the SLUB allocator is used.
    
    Note to stable kernel maintainers: when backporint this patch, please
    backport also the patch 3e374919b314f20e2a04f641ebc1093d758f66a4.

    powerpc/pseries: dynamically added OF nodes need to call of_node_init
    
    commit 97a9a7179aad701ab676e6f29eb90766a1acfde2 upstream.
    
    Commit 75b57ecf9 refactored device tree nodes to use kobjects such that they
    can be exposed via /sysfs. A secondary commit 0829f6d1f furthered this rework
    by moving the kobect initialization logic out of of_node_add into its own
    of_node_init function. The inital commit removed the existing kref_init calls
    in the pseries dlpar code with the assumption kobject initialization would
    occur in of_node_add. The second commit had the side effect of triggering a
    BUG_ON during DLPAR, migration and suspend/resume operations as a result of
    dynamically added nodes being uninitialized.
    
    This patch fixes this by adding of_node_init calls in place of the previously
    removed kref_init calls.

    zram: avoid lockdep splat by revalidate_disk
    
    commit b4c5c60920e3b0c4598f43e7317559f6aec51531 upstream.
    
    Sasha reported lockdep warning [1] introduced by [2].
    
    It could be fixed by doing disk revalidation out of the init_lock.  It's
    okay because disk capacity change is protected by init_lock so that
    revalidate_disk always sees up-to-date value so there is no race.

    tracing: Fix wraparound problems in "uptime" trace clock
    
    commit 58d4e21e50ff3cc57910a8abc20d7e14375d2f61 upstream.
    
    The "uptime" trace clock added in:
    
        commit 8aacf017b065a805d27467843490c976835eb4a5
        tracing: Add "uptime" trace clock that uses jiffies
    
    has wraparound problems when the system has been up more
    than 1 hour 11 minutes and 34 seconds. It converts jiffies
    to nanoseconds using:
            (u64)jiffies_to_usecs(jiffy) * 1000ULL
    but since jiffies_to_usecs() only returns a 32-bit value, it
    truncates at 2^32 microseconds.  An additional problem on 32-bit
    systems is that the argument is "unsigned long", so fixing the
    return value only helps until 2^32 jiffies (49.7 days on a HZ=1000
    system).
    
    Avoid these problems by using jiffies_64 as our basis, and
    not converting to nanoseconds (we do convert to clock_t because
    user facing API must not be dependent on internal kernel
    HZ values).

    776687bce42b ("block, blk-mq: draining can't be skipped even if
    bypass_depth was non-zero") made it easier to trigger this bug by
    making blk_queue_bypass_start() drain even when it loses the first
    bypass test to blk_cleanup_queue(); however, the bug has always been
    there even before the commit as blk_queue_bypass_start() could race
    against queue destruction, win the initial bypass test but perform the
    actual draining after blk_cleanup_queue() already destroyed all blkgs.
    
    Fix it by skippping calling into policy draining if all the blkgs are
    already gone.

    The PSW mask check of the PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA command is incorrect.
    The PSW_MASK_USER define contains the PSW_MASK_ASC bits, the ptrace
    interface accepts all combinations for the address-space-control
    bits. To protect the kernel space the PSW mask check in ptrace needs
    to reject the address-space-control bit combination for home space.

    libata: introduce ata_host->n_tags to avoid oops on SAS controllers
    
    commit 1a112d10f03e83fb3a2fdc4c9165865dec8a3ca6 upstream.
    
    1871ee134b73 ("libata: support the ata host which implements a queue
    depth less than 32") directly used ata_port->scsi_host->can_queue from
    ata_qc_new() to determine the number of tags supported by the host;

    Fix it by introducing ata_host->n_tags which is initialized to
    ATA_MAX_QUEUE - 1 in ata_host_init() for SAS controllers and set to
    scsi_host_template->can_queue in ata_host_register() for !SAS ones.
    As SAS hosts are never registered, this will give them the same
    ATA_MAX_QUEUE - 1 as before.  Note that we can't use
    scsi_host->can_queue directly for SAS hosts anyway as they can go
    higher than the libata maximum.

    libata: support the ata host which implements a queue depth less than 32
    
    commit 1871ee134b73fb4cadab75752a7152ed2813c751 upstream.
    
    The sata on fsl mpc8315e is broken after the commit 8a4aeec8d2d6
    ("libata/ahci: accommodate tag ordered controllers"). The reason is
    that the ata controller on this SoC only implement a queue depth of
    16. When issuing the commands in tag order, all the commands in tag
    16 ~ 31 are mapped to tag 0 unconditionally and then causes the sata
    malfunction. It makes no senses to use a 32 queue in software while
    the hardware has less queue depth. So consider the queue depth
    implemented by the hardware when requesting a command tag.

    commit d45b3279a5a2252cafcd665bbf2db8c9b31ef783 upstream.
    
    There is no inherent reason why the last put of a tag structure must be
    the one for the Scsi_Host, as device model objects can be held for
    arbitrary periods.  Merge blk_free_tags and __blk_free_tags into a single
    funtion that just release a references and get rid of the BUG() when the
    host reference wasn't the last.

    Only supported modulation for DVB-S is QPSK. Modulation parameter
    contains invalid value for DVB-S on some cases, which leads driver
    refusing tuning attempt. Due to that, hard code modulation to QPSK
    in case of DVB-S.

    media: hdpvr: fix two audio bugs
    
    commit 3445857b22eafb70a6ac258979e955b116bfd2c6 upstream.
    
    When the audio encoding is changed the driver calls hdpvr_set_audio
    with the current opt->audio_input value. However, that should have
    been opt->audio_input + 1. So changing the audio encoding inadvertently
    changes the input as well. This bug has always been there.
    
    The second bug was introduced in kernel 3.10 and that broke the
    default_audio_input module option handling: the audio encoding was
    never switched to AC3 if default_audio_input was set to 2 (SPDIF input).
    
    In addition, since starting with 3.10 the audio encoding is always set
    at the start the first bug now always happens when the driver is loaded.
    In the past this bug would only surface if the user would change the
    audio encoding after the driver was loaded.
    
    Also fixes a small trivial typo (bufffer -> buffer).

    media: staging: tighten omap4iss dependencies
    
    commit 4856fbd12d69965d3ab680c686222db93872728d upstream.
    
    The OMAP4 camera support depends on I2C and VIDEO_V4L2, both
    of which can be loadable modules. This causes build failures
    if we want the camera driver to be built-in.
    
    This can be solved by turning the option into "tristate",
    which unfortunately causes another problem, because the
    driver incorrectly calls a platform-internal interface
    for omap4_ctrl_pad_readl/omap4_ctrl_pad_writel.
    
    Instead, this patch just forbids the invalid configurations
    and ensures that the driver can only be built if all its
    dependencies are built-in.
