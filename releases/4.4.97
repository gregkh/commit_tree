    This patch resolves IO vs eviction race.
    After eviction failed export stayed at stale list,
    a client had IO processing and reconnected during it.
    A client sent brw rpc with last lock cookie and new connection.
    The lock with failed export was found and assert was happened.
     (ost_handler.c:1812:ost_prolong_lock_one())
      ASSERTION( lock->l_export == opd->opd_exp ) failed:
    
     1. Skip the lock at ldlm_handle2lock if lock export failed.
     2. Validation of lock for IO was added at hpreq_check(). The lock
        searching is based on granted interval tree. If server doesn`t
        have a valid lock, it reply to client with ESTALE.

    staging: lustre: hsm: stack overrun in hai_dump_data_field
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 22aadb91c0a0055935109c175f5446abfb130702 ]
    
    The function hai_dump_data_field will do a stack buffer
    overrun when cat'ing /sys/fs/lustre/.../hsm/actions if an action has
    some data in it.
    
    hai_dump_data_field uses snprintf. But there is no check for
    truncation, and the value returned by snprintf is used as-is.  The
    coordinator code calls hai_dump_data_field with 12 bytes in the
    buffer. The 6th byte of data is printed incompletely to make room for
    the terminating NUL. However snprintf still returns 2, so when
    hai_dump_data_field writes the final NUL, it does it outside the
    reserved buffer, in the 13th byte of the buffer. This stack buffer
    overrun hangs my VM.
    
    Fix by checking that there is enough room for the next 2 characters
    plus the NUL terminator. Don't print half bytes. Change the format to
    02X instead of .2X, which makes more sense.

    i2c: riic: correctly finish transfers
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 71ccea095ea1d4efd004dab971be6d599e06fc3f ]
    
    This fixes the condition where the controller has not fully completed its
    final transfer and leaves the bus and controller in a undesirable state.
    
    At the end of the last transmitted byte, the existing driver would just
    signal for a STOP condition to be transmitted then immediately signal
    completion. However, the full STOP procedure might not have fully taken
    place by the time the runtime PM shuts off the peripheral clock, leaving
    the bus in a suspended state.
    
    Alternatively, the STOP condition on the bus may have completed, but when
    the next transaction is requested by the upper layer, not all the
    necessary register cleanup was finished from the last transfer which made
    the driver return BUS BUSY when it really wasn't.
    
    This patch now makes all transmit and receive transactions wait for the
    STOP condition to fully complete before signaling a completed transaction.
    With this new method, runtime PM no longer seems to be an issue.

    ext4: fix stripe-unaligned allocations
    
    
    [ Upstream commit d9b22cf9f5466a057f2a4f1e642b469fa9d73117 ]
    
    When a filesystem is created using:
    
            mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -E stride=512 <dev>
    
    and we try to allocate 64MB extent, we will end up directly in
    ext4_mb_complex_scan_group(). This is because the request is detected
    as power-of-two allocation (so we start in ext4_mb_regular_allocator()
    with ac_criteria == 0) however the check before
    ext4_mb_simple_scan_group() refuses the direct buddy scan because the
    allocation request is too large. Since cr == 0, the check whether we
    should use ext4_mb_scan_aligned() fails as well and we fall back to
    ext4_mb_complex_scan_group().
    
    Fix the problem by checking for upper limit on power-of-two requests
    directly when detecting them.

    mfd: axp20x: Fix axp288 PEK_DBR and PEK_DBF irqs being swapped
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 1af468ebe45591651ec3bafc2e9ddc6fdef70ae0 ]
    
    The R in PEK_DBR stands for rising, so it should be mapped to
    AXP288_IRQ_POKP where the last P stands for positive edge.
    
    Likewise PEK_DBF should be mapped to the falling edge, aka the
    _N_egative edge, so it should be mapped to AXP288_IRQ_POKN.
    
    This fixes the inverted powerbutton status reporting by the
    axp20x-pek driver.

    mfd: ab8500-sysctrl: Handle probe deferral
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e9c40c63933a643908d686bd89dfc2315e8c70a ]
    
    In the current boot, clients making use of the AB8500 sysctrl
    may be probed before the ab8500-sysctrl driver. This gives them
    -EINVAL, but should rather give -EPROBE_DEFER.
    
    Before this, the abx500 clock driver didn't probe properly,
    and as a result the codec driver in turn using the clocks did
    not probe properly. After this patch, everything probes
    properly.
    
    Also add OF compatible-string probing. This driver is all
    device tree, so let's just make a drive-by-fix of that as
    well.

    PM / wakeirq: report a wakeup_event on dedicated wekup irq
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 09bb6e93956ae5175b96905b723ec879c3ca0765 ]
    
    There are two reasons for reporting wakeup event when dedicated wakeup
    IRQ is triggered:
    
    - wakeup events accounting, so proper statistical data will be
      displayed in sysfs and debugfs;
    
    - there are small window when System is entering suspend during which
      dedicated wakeup IRQ can be lost:
    
    dpm_suspend_noirq()
      |- device_wakeup_arm_wake_irqs()
          |- dev_pm_arm_wake_irq(X)
             |- IRQ is enabled and marked as wakeup source
    [1]...
      |- suspend_device_irqs()
         |- suspend_device_irq(X)
            |- irqd_set(X, IRQD_WAKEUP_ARMED);
               |- wakup IRQ armed
    
    The wakeup IRQ can be lost if it's triggered at point [1]
    and not armed yet.
    
    Hence, fix above cases by adding simple pm_wakeup_event() call in
    handle_threaded_wake_irq().

    Commit 7496946a8 ("tracing: Add samples of DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS() and

    functions.
    
    Enabling both the TRACE_EVENT_FN() and DEFINE_EVENT_FN() example trace
    events caused the foo_bar_reg to be called twice, creating the test thread
    twice. The foo_bar_unreg would remove it only once, even if it was called
    multiple times, leaving a thread existing when the module is unloaded,
    causing an oops.
    
    Add a ref count and allow foo_bar_reg() and foo_bar_unreg() be called by
    multiple trace events.

    drm/msm: fix an integer overflow test
    
    commit 65e93108891e571f177c202add9288eda9ac4100 upstream.
    
    We recently added an integer overflow check but it needs an additional
    tweak to work properly on 32 bit systems.
    
    The problem is that we're doing the right hand side of the assignment as
    type unsigned long so the max it will have an integer overflow instead
    of being larger than SIZE_MAX.  That means the "sz > SIZE_MAX" condition
    is never true even on 32 bit systems.  We need to first cast it to u64
    and then do the math.

    perf tools: Fix build failure on perl script context
    
    commit b581c01fff646b5075d65359c8667de9c667da9e upstream.
    
    On my Archlinux machine, perf faild to build like below:

    What I did to fix is adding '-Wno-shadow' as the error message said it's
    the cause of the failure.  Since it's from the perl (not perf) code
    base, we don't have the control so I just wanted to ignore the warning
    when compiling perl scripting code.

    ocfs2: fstrim: Fix start offset of first cluster group during fstrim
    
    commit 105ddc93f06ebe3e553f58563d11ed63dbcd59f0 upstream.
    
    The first cluster group descriptor is not stored at the start of the
    group but at an offset from the start.  We need to take this into
    account while doing fstrim on the first cluster group.  Otherwise we
    will wrongly start fstrim a few blocks after the desired start block and
    the range can cross over into the next cluster group and zero out the
    group descriptor there.  This can cause filesytem corruption that cannot
    be fixed by fsck.

    ARM: 8715/1: add a private asm/unaligned.h
    
    commit 1cce91dfc8f7990ca3aea896bfb148f240b12860 upstream.
    
    The asm-generic/unaligned.h header provides two different implementations
    for accessing unaligned variables: the access_ok.h version used when
    CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS is set pretends that all pointers
    are in fact aligned, while the le_struct.h version convinces gcc that the
    alignment of a pointer is '1', to make it issue the correct load/store
    instructions depending on the architecture flags.
    
    On ARMv5 and older, we always use the second version, to let the compiler
    use byte accesses. On ARMv6 and newer, we currently use the access_ok.h
    version, so the compiler can use any instruction including stm/ldm and
    ldrd/strd that will cause an alignment trap. This trap can significantly
    impact performance when we have to do a lot of fixups and, worse, has
    led to crashes in the LZ4 decompressor code that does not have a trap
    handler.
    
    This adds an ARM specific version of asm/unaligned.h that uses the
    le_struct.h/be_struct.h implementation unconditionally. This should lead
    to essentially the same code on ARMv6+ as before, with the exception of
    using regular load/store instructions instead of the trapping instructions
    multi-register variants.
    
    The crash in the LZ4 decompressor code was probably introduced by the
    patch replacing the LZ4 implementation, commit 4e1a33b105dd ("lib: update
    LZ4 compressor module"), so linux-4.11 and higher would be affected most.
    However, we probably want to have this backported to all older stable
    kernels as well, to help with the performance issues.
    
    There are two follow-ups that I think we should also work on, but not
    backport to stable kernels, first to change the asm-generic version of
    the header to remove the ARM special case, and second to review all
    other uses of CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS to see if they
    might be affected by the same problem on ARM.

    commit 7a7003b1da010d2b0d1dc8bf21c10f5c73b389f1 upstream.
    
    It's possible for a user to deliberately trigger __dump_instr with a
    chosen kernel address.
    
    Let's avoid problems resulting from this by using get_user() rather than
    __get_user(), ensuring that we don't erroneously access kernel memory.
    
    Where we use __dump_instr() on kernel text, we already switch to
    KERNEL_DS, so this shouldn't adversely affect those cases.

    ASoC: adau17x1: Workaround for noise bug in ADC
    
    commit 1e6f4fc06f6411adf98bbbe7fcd79442cd2b2a75 upstream.
    
    The ADC in the ADAU1361 (and possibly other Analog Devices codecs)
    exhibits a cyclic variation in the noise floor (in our test setup between
    -87 and -93 dB), a new value being attained within this range whenever a
    new capture stream is started. The cycle repeats after about 10 or 11
    restarts.
    
    The workaround recommended by the manufacturer is to toggle the ADOSR bit
    in the Converter Control 0 register each time a new capture stream is
    started.
    
    I have verified that the patch fixes this problem on the ADAU1361, and
    according to the manufacturer toggling the bit in question in this manner
    will at least have no detrimental effect on other chips served by this
    driver.

        keyctl add asymmetric desc $'\x30\x30' @s
    
    The bug is that the length of an ASN.1 data value isn't validated in the
    case where it is encoded using the short form, causing the decoder to
    read past the end of the input buffer.  Fix it by validating the length.
    
    The bug report was:

    KEYS: return full count in keyring_read() if buffer is too small
    
    commit 3239b6f29bdfb4b0a2ba59df995fc9e6f4df7f1f upstream.
    
    Commit e645016abc80 ("KEYS: fix writing past end of user-supplied buffer
    in keyring_read()") made keyring_read() stop corrupting userspace memory
    when the user-supplied buffer is too small.  However it also made the
    return value in that case be the short buffer size rather than the size
    required, yet keyctl_read() is actually documented to return the size
    required.  Therefore, switch it over to the documented behavior.
    
    Note that for now we continue to have it fill the short buffer, since it
    did that before (pre-v3.13) and dump_key_tree_aux() in keyutils arguably
    relies on it.

    ALSA: seq: Fix nested rwsem annotation for lockdep splat
    
    commit 1f20f9ff57ca23b9f5502fca85ce3977e8496cb1 upstream.
    
    syzkaller reported the lockdep splat due to the possible deadlock of
    grp->list_mutex of each sequencer client object.  Actually this is
    rather a false-positive report due to the missing nested lock
    annotations.  The sequencer client may deliver the event directly to
    another client which takes another own lock.
    
    For addressing this issue, this patch replaces the simple down_read()
    with down_read_nested().  As a lock subclass, the already existing
    "hop" can be re-used, which indicates the depth of the call.

    ALSA: timer: Add missing mutex lock for compat ioctls
    
    commit 79fb0518fec8c8b4ea7f1729f54f293724b3dbb0 upstream.
    
    The races among ioctl and other operations were protected by the
    commit af368027a49a ("ALSA: timer: Fix race among timer ioctls") and
    later fixes, but one code path was forgotten in the scenario: the
    32bit compat ioctl.  As syzkaller recently spotted, a very similar
    use-after-free may happen with the combination of compat ioctls.
    
    The fix is simply to apply the same ioctl_lock to the compat_ioctl
    callback, too.
