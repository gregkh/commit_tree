    KEYS: Fix termination condition in assoc array garbage collection
    
    commit 95389b08d93d5c06ec63ab49bd732b0069b7c35e upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2014-3631.
    
    It is possible for an associative array to end up with a shortcut node at the
    root of the tree if there are more than fan-out leaves in the tree, but they
    all crowd into the same slot in the lowest level (ie. they all have the same
    first nibble of their index keys).
    
    When assoc_array_gc() returns back up the tree after scanning some leaves, it
    can fall off of the root and crash because it assumes that the back pointer
    from a shortcut (after label ascend_old_tree) must point to a normal node -
    which isn't true of a shortcut node at the root.
    
    Should we find we're ascending rootwards over a shortcut, we should check to
    see if the backpointer is zero - and if it is, we have completed the scan.
    
    This particular bug cannot occur if the root node is not a shortcut - ie. if
    you have fewer than 17 keys in a keyring or if you have at least two keys that
    sit into separate slots (eg. a keyring and a non keyring).
    
    This can be reproduced by:
    
            ring=`keyctl newring bar @s`
            for ((i=1; i<=18; i++)); do last_key=`keyctl newring foo$i $ring`; done
            keyctl timeout $last_key 2
    
    Doing this:
    
            echo 3 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/gc_delay
    
    first will speed things up.
    
    If we do fall off of the top of the tree, we get the following oops:

    KEYS: Fix use-after-free in assoc_array_gc()
    
    commit 27419604f51a97d497853f14142c1059d46eb597 upstream.
    
    An edit script should be considered inaccessible by a function once it has
    called assoc_array_apply_edit() or assoc_array_cancel_edit().
    
    However, assoc_array_gc() is accessing the edit script just after the
    gc_complete: label.

    vfs: fix bad hashing of dentries
    
    commit 99d263d4c5b2f541dfacb5391e22e8c91ea982a6 upstream.
    
    Josef Bacik found a performance regression between 3.2 and 3.10 and
    narrowed it down to commit bfcfaa77bdf0 ("vfs: use 'unsigned long'
    accesses for dcache name comparison and hashing"). He reports:
    
     "The test case is essentially
    
          for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
                  mkdir("a$i");
    
      On xfs on a fio card this goes at about 20k dir/sec with 3.2, and 12k
      dir/sec with 3.10.  This is because we spend waaaaay more time in
      __d_lookup on 3.10 than in 3.2.
    
      The new hashing function for strings is suboptimal for <
      sizeof(unsigned long) string names (and hell even > sizeof(unsigned
      long) string names that I've tested).  I broke out the old hashing
      function and the new one into a userspace helper to get real numbers
      and this is what I'm getting:
    
          Old hash table had 1000000 entries, 0 dupes, 0 max dupes
          New hash table had 12628 entries, 987372 dupes, 900 max dupes
          We had 11400 buckets with a p50 of 30 dupes, p90 of 240 dupes, p99 of 567 dupes for the new hash
    
      My test does the hash, and then does the d_hash into a integer pointer
      array the same size as the dentry hash table on my system, and then
      just increments the value at the address we got to see how many
      entries we overlap with.
    
      As you can see the old hash function ended up with all 1 million
      entries in their own bucket, whereas the new one they are only
      distributed among ~12.5k buckets, which is why we're using so much
      more CPU in __d_lookup".
    
    The reason for this hash regression is two-fold:
    
     - On 64-bit architectures the down-mixing of the original 64-bit
       word-at-a-time hash into the final 32-bit hash value is very
       simplistic and suboptimal, and just adds the two 32-bit parts
       together.
    
       In particular, because there is no bit shuffling and the mixing
       boundary is also a byte boundary, similar character patterns in the
       low and high word easily end up just canceling each other out.
    
     - the old byte-at-a-time hash mixed each byte into the final hash as it
       hashed the path component name, resulting in the low bits of the hash
       generally being a good source of hash data.  That is not true for the
       word-at-a-time case, and the hash data is distributed among all the
       bits.
    
    The fix is the same in both cases: do a better job of mixing the bits up
    and using as much of the hash data as possible.  We already have the
    "hash_32|64()" functions to do that.

    drm/nouveau: Bump version from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2
    
    commit 7820e5eef0faa4a5e10834296680827f7ce78a89 upstream.
    
    Linux 3.16 fixed multiple bugs in kms pageflip completion events
    and timestamping, which were originally introduced in Linux 3.13.
    
    These fixes have been backported to all stable kernels since 3.13.
    
    However, the userspace nouveau-ddx needs to be aware if it is
    running on a kernel on which these bugs are fixed, or not.
    
    Bump the patchlevel of the drm driver version to signal this,
    so backporting this patch to stable 3.13+ kernels will give the
    ddx the required info.

    mtd: nand: omap: Fix 1-bit Hamming code scheme, omap_calculate_ecc()
    
    commit 40ddbf5069bd4e11447c0088fc75318e0aac53f0 upstream.
    
    commit 65b97cf6b8de introduced in v3.7 caused a regression
    by using a reversed CS_MASK thus causing omap_calculate_ecc to
    always fail. As the NAND base driver never checks for .calculate()'s
    return value, the zeroed ECC values are used as is without showing
    any error to the user. However, this won't work and the NAND device
    won't be guarded by any error code.
    
    Fix the issue by using the correct mask.
    
    Code was tested on omap3beagle using the following procedure
    - flash the primary bootloader (MLO) from the kernel to the first
    NAND partition using nandwrite.
    - boot the board from NAND. This utilizes OMAP ROM loader that
    relies on 1-bit Hamming code ECC.

    It seems that the corrupted partition header on my mtd device triggers
    a bug in the ftl. In function build_maps() it will allocate the buffers
    needed by the mtd partition, but if something goes wrong such as kmalloc
    failure, mtd read error or invalid partition header parameter, it will
    free all allocated buffers and then return non-zero. In my case, it
    seems that partition header parameter 'NumTransferUnits' is invalid.
    
    And the ftl_freepart() is a function which free all the partition
    buffers allocated by build_maps(). Given the build_maps() is a self
    cleaning function, so there is no need to invoke this function even
    if build_maps() return with error. Otherwise it will causes the
    buffers to be freed twice and then weird things would happen.

    CIFS: Fix directory rename error
    
    commit a07d322059db66b84c9eb4f98959df468e88b34b upstream.
    
    CIFS servers process nlink counts differently for files and directories.
    In cifs_rename() if we the request fails on the existing target, we
    try to remove it through cifs_unlink() but this is not what we want
    to do for directories. As the result the following sequence of commands
    
    mkdir {1,2}; mv -T 1 2; rmdir {1,2}; mkdir {1,2}; echo foo > 2/bar
    
    and XFS test generic/023 fail with -ENOENT error. That's why the second
    mkdir reuses the existing inode (target inode of the mv -T command) with
    S_DEAD flag.
    
    Fix this by checking whether the target is directory or not and
    calling cifs_rmdir() rather than cifs_unlink() for directories.

    CIFS: Fix async reading on reconnects
    
    commit 038bc961c31b070269ecd07349a7ee2e839d4fec upstream.
    
    If we get into read_into_pages() from cifs_readv_receive() and then
    loose a network, we issue cifs_reconnect that moves all mids to
    a private list and issue their callbacks. The callback of the async
    read request sets a mid to retry, frees it and wakes up a process
    that waits on the rdata completion.
    
    After the connection is established we return from read_into_pages()
    with a short read, use the mid that was freed before and try to read
    the remaining data from the a newly created socket. Both actions are
    not what we want to do. In reconnect cases (-EAGAIN) we should not
    mask off the error with a short read but should return the error
    code instead.

    libceph: do not hard code max auth ticket len
    
    commit c27a3e4d667fdcad3db7b104f75659478e0c68d8 upstream.
    
    We hard code cephx auth ticket buffer size to 256 bytes.  This isn't
    enough for any moderate setups and, in case tickets themselves are not
    encrypted, leads to buffer overflows (ceph_x_decrypt() errors out, but
    ceph_decode_copy() doesn't - it's just a memcpy() wrapper).  Since the
    buffer is allocated dynamically anyway, allocated it a bit later, at
    the point where we know how much is going to be needed.

    libceph: set last_piece in ceph_msg_data_pages_cursor_init() correctly
    
    commit 5f740d7e1531099b888410e6bab13f68da9b1a4d upstream.
    
    Determining ->last_piece based on the value of ->page_offset + length
    is incorrect because length here is the length of the entire message.
    ->last_piece set to false even if page array data item length is <=
    PAGE_SIZE, which results in invalid length passed to
    ceph_tcp_{send,recv}page() and causes various asserts to fire.
    
        # cat pages-cursor-init.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        rbd create --size 10 --image-format 2 foo
        FOO_DEV=$(rbd map foo)
        dd if=/dev/urandom of=$FOO_DEV bs=1M &>/dev/null
        rbd snap create foo@snap
        rbd snap protect foo@snap
        rbd clone foo@snap bar
        # rbd_resize calls librbd rbd_resize(), size is in bytes
        ./rbd_resize bar $(((4 << 20) + 512))
        rbd resize --size 10 bar
        BAR_DEV=$(rbd map bar)
        # trigger a 512-byte copyup -- 512-byte page array data item
        dd if=/dev/urandom of=$BAR_DEV bs=1M count=1 seek=5
    
    The problem exists only in ceph_msg_data_pages_cursor_init(),
    ceph_msg_data_pages_advance() does the right thing.  The size_t cast is
    unnecessary.

    xfs: don't zero partial page cache pages during O_DIRECT writes
    
    commit 85e584da3212140ee80fd047f9058bbee0bc00d5 upstream.
    
    xfs is using truncate_pagecache_range to invalidate the page cache
    during DIO reads.  This is different from the other filesystems who
    only invalidate pages during DIO writes.
    
    truncate_pagecache_range is meant to be used when we are freeing the
    underlying data structs from disk, so it will zero any partial
    ranges in the page.  This means a DIO read can zero out part of the
    page cache page, and it is possible the page will stay in cache.
    
    buffered reads will find an up to date page with zeros instead of
    the data actually on disk.
    
    This patch fixes things by using invalidate_inode_pages2_range
    instead.  It preserves the page cache invalidation, but won't zero
    any pages.

    commit 834ffca6f7e345a79f6f2e2d131b0dfba8a4b67a upstream.
    
    Similar to direct IO reads, direct IO writes are using
    truncate_pagecache_range to invalidate the page cache. This is
    incorrect due to the sub-block zeroing in the page cache that
    truncate_pagecache_range() triggers.

    xfs: don't dirty buffers beyond EOF
    
    commit 22e757a49cf010703fcb9c9b4ef793248c39b0c2 upstream.
    
    generic/263 is failing fsx at this point with a page spanning
    EOF that cannot be invalidated. The operations are:
    
    1190 mapwrite   0x52c00 thru    0x5e569 (0xb96a bytes)
    1191 mapread    0x5c000 thru    0x5d636 (0x1637 bytes)
    1192 write      0x5b600 thru    0x771ff (0x1bc00 bytes)
    
    where 1190 extents EOF from 0x54000 to 0x5e569. When the direct IO
    write attempts to invalidate the cached page over this range, it
    fails with -EBUSY and so any attempt to do page invalidation fails.
    
    The real question is this: Why can't that page be invalidated after
    it has been written to disk and cleaned?
    
    Well, there's data on the first two buffers in the page (1k block
    size, 4k page), but the third buffer on the page (i.e. beyond EOF)
    is failing drop_buffers because it's bh->b_state == 0x3, which is
    BH_Uptodate | BH_Dirty.  IOWs, there's dirty buffers beyond EOF. Say
    what?
    
    OK, set_buffer_dirty() is called on all buffers from
    __set_page_buffers_dirty(), regardless of whether the buffer is
    beyond EOF or not, which means that when we get to ->writepage,
    we have buffers marked dirty beyond EOF that we need to clean.
    So, we need to implement our own .set_page_dirty method that
    doesn't dirty buffers beyond EOF.
    
    This is messy because the buffer code is not meant to be shared
    and it has interesting locking issues on the buffer dirty bits.
    So just copy and paste it and then modify it to suit what we need.
    
    Note: the solutions the other filesystems and generic block code use
    of marking the buffers clean in ->writepage does not work for XFS.
    It still leaves dirty buffers beyond EOF and invalidations still
    fail. Hence rather than play whack-a-mole, this patch simply
    prevents those buffers from being dirtied in the first place.

    xfs: quotacheck leaves dquot buffers without verifiers
    
    commit 5fd364fee81a7888af806e42ed8a91c845894f2d upstream.

    buffers that did not have the xfs_dquot_buf_ops verifiers attached:

    This was caused by dquot buffer readahead not attaching a verifier
    structure to the buffer when readahead was issued, resulting in the
    followup read of the buffer finding a valid buffer and so not
    attaching new verifiers to the buffer as part of the read.
    
    Also, when a verifier failure occurs, we then read the buffer
    without verifiers. Attach the verifiers manually after this read so
    that if the buffer is then written it will be verified that the
    corruption has been repaired.
    
    Further, when flushing a dquot we don't ask for a verifier when
    reading in the dquot buffer the dquot belongs to. Most of the time
    this isn't an issue because the buffer is still cached, but when it
    is not cached it will result in writing the dquot buffer without
    having the verfier attached.

    xfs: ensure verifiers are attached to recovered buffers
    
    commit 67dc288c21064b31a98a53dc64f6b9714b819fd6 upstream.
    
    Crash testing of CRC enabled filesystems has resulted in a number of
    reports of bad CRCs being detected after the filesystem was mounted.
    Errors such as the following were being seen:
    
    XFS (sdb3): Mounting V5 Filesystem
    XFS (sdb3): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)
    XFS (sdb3): Metadata CRC error detected at xfs_agf_read_verify+0x5a/0x100 [xfs], block 0x1
    XFS (sdb3): Unmount and run xfs_repair
    XFS (sdb3): First 64 bytes of corrupted metadata buffer:

    XFS (sdb3): metadata I/O error: block 0x1 ("xfs_trans_read_buf_map") error 74 numblks 1
    
    The errors were typically being seen in AGF, AGI and their related
    btree block buffers some time after log recovery had run. Often it
    wasn't until later subsequent mounts that the problem was
    discovered. The common symptom was a buffer with the correct
    contents, but a CRC and an LSN that matched an older version of the
    contents.
    
    Some debug added to _xfs_buf_ioapply() indicated that buffers were
    being written without verifiers attached to them from log recovery,
    and Jan Kara isolated the cause to log recovery readahead an dit's
    interactions with buffers that had a more recent LSN on disk than
    the transaction being recovered. In this case, the buffer did not
    get a verifier attached, and os when the second phase of log
    recovery ran and recovered EFIs and unlinked inodes, the buffers
    were modified and written without the verifier running. Hence they
    had up to date contents, but stale LSNs and CRCs.
    
    Fix it by attaching verifiers to buffers we skip due to future LSN
    values so they don't escape into the buffer cache without the
    correct verifier attached.
    
    This patch is based on analysis and a patch from Jan Kara.

    commit 2f0304d21867476394cd51a54e97f7273d112261 upstream.
    
    If the user creates a listening cm_id with backlog of 0 the IWCM ends
    up not allowing any connection requests at all.  The correct behavior
    is for the IWCM to pick a default value if the user backlog parameter
    is zero.

    md/raid10: Fix memory leak when raid10 reshape completes.
    
    commit b39685526f46976bcd13aa08c82480092befa46c upstream.
    
    When a raid10 commences a resync/recovery/reshape it allocates
    some buffer space.
    When a resync/recovery completes the buffer space is freed.  But not
    when the reshape completes.
    This can result in a small memory leak.
    
    There is a subtle side-effect of this bug.  When a RAID10 is reshaped
    to a larger array (more devices), the reshape is immediately followed
    by a "resync" of the new space.  This "resync" will use the buffer
    space which was allocated for "reshape".  This can cause problems
    including a "BUG" in the SCSI layer.  So this is suitable for -stable.

    commit ce0b0a46955d1bb389684a2605dbcaa990ba0154 upstream.
    
    raid10 reshape clears unwanted bits from a bio->bi_flags using
    a method which, while clumsy, worked until 3.10 when BIO_OWNS_VEC
    was added.
    Since then it clears that bit but shouldn't.  This results in a
    memory leak.
    
    So change to used the approved method of clearing unwanted bits.
    
    As this causes a memory leak which can consume all of memory
    the fix is suitable for -stable.

    md/raid6: avoid data corruption during recovery of double-degraded RAID6
    
    commit 9c4bdf697c39805078392d5ddbbba5ae5680e0dd upstream.
    
    During recovery of a double-degraded RAID6 it is possible for
    some blocks not to be recovered properly, leading to corruption.
    
    If a write happens to one block in a stripe that would be written to a
    missing device, and at the same time that stripe is recovering data
    to the other missing device, then that recovered data may not be written.
    
    This patch skips, in the double-degraded case, an optimisation that is
    only safe for single-degraded arrays.
    
    Bug was introduced in 2.6.32 and fix is suitable for any kernel since
    then.  In an older kernel with separate handle_stripe5() and
    handle_stripe6() functions the patch must change handle_stripe6().

    md/raid1,raid10: always abort recover on write error.
    
    commit 2446dba03f9dabe0b477a126cbeb377854785b47 upstream.
    
    Currently we don't abort recovery on a write error if the write error
    to the recovering device was triggerd by normal IO (as opposed to
    recovery IO).
    
    This means that for one bitmap region, the recovery might write to the
    recovering device for a few sectors, then not bother for subsequent
    sectors (as it never writes to failed devices).  In this case
    the bitmap bit will be cleared, but it really shouldn't.
    
    The result is that if the recovering device fails and is then re-added
    (after fixing whatever hardware problem triggerred the failure),
    the second recovery won't redo the region it was in the middle of,
    so some of the device will not be recovered properly.
    
    If we abort the recovery, the region being processes will be cancelled
    (bit not cleared) and the whole region will be retried.
    
    As the bug can result in data corruption the patch is suitable for
    -stable.  For kernels prior to 3.11 there is a conflict in raid10.c
    which will require care.

    fix copy_tree() regression
    
    commit 12a5b5294cb1896e9a3c9fca8ff5a7e3def4e8c6 upstream.
    
    Since 3.14 we had copy_tree() get the shadowing wrong - if we had one
    vfsmount shadowing another (i.e. if A is a slave of B, C is mounted
    on A/foo, then D got mounted on B/foo creating D' on A/foo shadowed
    by C), copy_tree() of A would make a copy of D' shadow the the copy of
    C, not the other way around.
    
    It's easy to fix, fortunately - just make sure that mount follows
    the one that shadows it in mnt_child as well as in mnt_hash, and when
    copy_tree() decides to attach a new mount, check if the last child
    it has added to the same parent should be shadowing the new one.
    And if it should, just use the same logics commit_tree() has - put the
    new mount into the hash and children lists right after the one that
    should shadow it.

    Bluetooth: Avoid use of session socket after the session gets freed

    allow rfcomm_recv_ua and rfcomm_session_close to delete the session

    to the upper callers.
    
    Additional fix is required to terminate the loop in rfcomm_process_rx
    function to avoid use of freed 'sk' memory.
    
    The issue is only reproducible with kernel option CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING
    enabled making freed memory being changed and filled up with fixed char

    earlier. By the time when the BT_EVENT_HOST_SLEEP_ENABLE event
    comes in the controller driver could have already turned off the
    bus clock. This causes kernel crash or system reboot eventually.

    fix EBUSY on umount() from MNT_SHRINKABLE
    
    commit 81b6b06197606b4bef4e427a197aeb808e8d89e1 upstream.
    
    We need the parents of victims alive until namespace_unlock() gets to
    dput() of the (ex-)mountpoints.  However, that screws up the "is it
    busy" checks in case when we have shrinkable mounts that need to be
    killed.  Solution: go ahead and decrement refcounts of parents right
    in umount_tree(), increment them again just before dropping rwsem in
    namespace_unlock() (and let the loop in the end of namespace_unlock()
    finally drop those references for good, as we do now).  Parents can't
    get freed until we drop rwsem - at least one reference is kept until
    then, both in case when parent is among the victims and when it is
    not.  So they'll still be around when we get to namespace_unlock().

    mnt: Add tests for unprivileged remount cases that have found to be faulty
    
    commit db181ce011e3c033328608299cd6fac06ea50130 upstream.
    
    Kenton Varda <kenton@sandstorm.io> discovered that by remounting a
    read-only bind mount read-only in a user namespace the
    MNT_LOCK_READONLY bit would be cleared, allowing an unprivileged user
    to the remount a read-only mount read-write.
    
    Upon review of the code in remount it was discovered that the code allowed
    nosuid, noexec, and nodev to be cleared.  It was also discovered that
    the code was allowing the per mount atime flags to be changed.
    
    The first naive patch to fix these issues contained the flaw that using
    default atime settings when remounting a filesystem could be disallowed.
    
    To avoid this problems in the future add tests to ensure unprivileged
    remounts are succeeding and failing at the appropriate times.

    mnt: Change the default remount atime from relatime to the existing value
    
    commit ffbc6f0ead47fa5a1dc9642b0331cb75c20a640e upstream.
    
    Since March 2009 the kernel has treated the state that if no
    MS_..ATIME flags are passed then the kernel defaults to relatime.
    
    Defaulting to relatime instead of the existing atime state during a
    remount is silly, and causes problems in practice for people who don't
    specify any MS_...ATIME flags and to get the default filesystem atime
    setting.  Those users may encounter a permission error because the
    default atime setting does not work.
    
    A default that does not work and causes permission problems is
    ridiculous, so preserve the existing value to have a default
    atime setting that is always guaranteed to work.
    
    Using the default atime setting in this way is particularly
    interesting for applications built to run in restricted userspace
    environments without /proc mounted, as the existing atime mount
    options of a filesystem can not be read from /proc/mounts.
    
    In practice this fixes user space that uses the default atime
    setting on remount that are broken by the permission checks
    keeping less privileged users from changing more privileged users
    atime settings.

    mnt: Correct permission checks in do_remount
    
    commit 9566d6742852c527bf5af38af5cbb878dad75705 upstream.
    
    While invesgiating the issue where in "mount --bind -oremount,ro ..."
    would result in later "mount --bind -oremount,rw" succeeding even if
    the mount started off locked I realized that there are several
    additional mount flags that should be locked and are not.
    
    In particular MNT_NOSUID, MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOEXEC, and the atime
    flags in addition to MNT_READONLY should all be locked.  These
    flags are all per superblock, can all be changed with MS_BIND,
    and should not be changable if set by a more privileged user.
    
    The following additions to the current logic are added in this patch.
    - nosuid may not be clearable by a less privileged user.
    - nodev  may not be clearable by a less privielged user.
    - noexec may not be clearable by a less privileged user.
    - atime flags may not be changeable by a less privileged user.
    
    The logic with atime is that always setting atime on access is a
    global policy and backup software and auditing software could break if
    atime bits are not updated (when they are configured to be updated),
    and serious performance degradation could result (DOS attack) if atime
    updates happen when they have been explicitly disabled.  Therefore an
    unprivileged user should not be able to mess with the atime bits set
    by a more privileged user.
    
    The additional restrictions are implemented with the addition of
    MNT_LOCK_NOSUID, MNT_LOCK_NODEV, MNT_LOCK_NOEXEC, and MNT_LOCK_ATIME
    mnt flags.
    
    Taken together these changes and the fixes for MNT_LOCK_READONLY
    should make it safe for an unprivileged user to create a user
    namespace and to call "mount --bind -o remount,... ..." without
    the danger of mount flags being changed maliciously.

    mnt: Move the test for MNT_LOCK_READONLY from change_mount_flags into do_remount
    
    commit 07b645589dcda8b7a5249e096fece2a67556f0f4 upstream.
    
    There are no races as locked mount flags are guaranteed to never change.
    
    Moving the test into do_remount makes it more visible, and ensures all
    filesystem remounts pass the MNT_LOCK_READONLY permission check.  This
    second case is not an issue today as filesystem remounts are guarded
    by capable(CAP_DAC_ADMIN) and thus will always fail in less privileged
    mount namespaces, but it could become an issue in the future.

    mnt: Only change user settable mount flags in remount
    
    commit a6138db815df5ee542d848318e5dae681590fccd upstream.
    
    Kenton Varda <kenton@sandstorm.io> discovered that by remounting a

    MNT_LOCK_READONLY bit would be cleared, allowing an unprivileged user
    to the remount a read-only mount read-write.
    
    Correct this by replacing the mask of mount flags to preserve
    with a mask of mount flags that may be changed, and preserve
    all others.   This ensures that any future bugs with this mask and
    remount will fail in an easy to detect way where new mount flags
    simply won't change.

    After writting a test to try to trigger the bug that caused the

    Debugging this bug, which triggers when the rb_iter_peek() loops too
    many times (more than 2 times), I discovered there's a case that can
    cause that function to legitimately loop 3 times!
    
    rb_iter_peek() is different than rb_buffer_peek() as the rb_buffer_peek()
    only deals with the reader page (it's for consuming reads). The
    rb_iter_peek() is for traversing the buffer without consuming it, and as
    such, it can loop for one more reason. That is, if we hit the end of
    the reader page or any page, it will go to the next page and try again.
    
    That is, we have this:
    
     1. iter->head > iter->head_page->page->commit
        (rb_inc_iter() which moves the iter to the next page)
        try again
    
     2. event = rb_iter_head_event()
        event->type_len == RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_EXTEND
        rb_advance_iter()
        try again
    
     3. read the event.
    
    But we never get to 3, because the count is greater than 2 and we
    cause the WARNING and return NULL.
    
    Up the counter to 3.

    ring-buffer: Always reset iterator to reader page
    
    commit 651e22f2701b4113989237c3048d17337dd2185c upstream.
    
    When performing a consuming read, the ring buffer swaps out a
    page from the ring buffer with a empty page and this page that
    was swapped out becomes the new reader page. The reader page
    is owned by the reader and since it was swapped out of the ring
    buffer, writers do not have access to it (there's an exception
    to that rule, but it's out of scope for this commit).
    
    When reading the "trace" file, it is a non consuming read, which
    means that the data in the ring buffer will not be modified.
    When the trace file is opened, a ring buffer iterator is allocated
    and writes to the ring buffer are disabled, such that the iterator
    will not have issues iterating over the data.
    
    Although the ring buffer disabled writes, it does not disable other
    reads, or even consuming reads. If a consuming read happens, then
    the iterator is reset and starts reading from the beginning again.
    
    My tests would sometimes trigger this bug on my i386 box:

    Which was the __trace_find_cmdline() function complaining about the pid
    in the event record being negative.
    
    After adding more test cases, this would trigger more often. Strangely
    enough, it would never trigger on a single test, but instead would trigger
    only when running all the tests. I believe that was the case because it
    required one of the tests to be shutting down via delayed instances while
    a new test started up.
    
    After spending several days debugging this, I found that it was caused by
    the iterator becoming corrupted. Debugging further, I found out why
    the iterator became corrupted. It happened with the rb_iter_reset().
    
    As consuming reads may not read the full reader page, and only part
    of it, there's a "read" field to know where the last read took place.
    The iterator, must also start at the read position. In the rb_iter_reset()
    code, if the reader page was disconnected from the ring buffer, the iterator
    would start at the head page within the ring buffer (where writes still
    happen). But the mistake there was that it still used the "read" field
    to start the iterator on the head page, where it should always start
    at zero because readers never read from within the ring buffer where
    writes occur.
    
    I originally wrote a patch to have it set the iter->head to 0 instead
    of iter->head_page->read, but then I questioned why it wasn't always
    setting the iter to point to the reader page, as the reader page is
    still valid.  The list_empty(reader_page->list) just means that it was
    successful in swapping out. But the reader_page may still have data.
    
    There was a bug report a long time ago that was not reproducible that
    had something about trace_pipe (consuming read) not matching trace
    (iterator read). This may explain why that happened.
    
    Anyway, the correct answer to this bug is to always use the reader page
    an not reset the iterator to inside the writable ring buffer.

    ACPI / cpuidle: fix deadlock between cpuidle_lock and cpu_hotplug.lock
    
    commit 6726655dfdd2dc60c035c690d9f10cb69d7ea075 upstream.
    
    There is a following AB-BA dependency between cpu_hotplug.lock and
    cpuidle_lock:
    
    1) cpu_hotplug.lock -> cpuidle_lock
    enable_nonboot_cpus()
     _cpu_up()
      cpu_hotplug_begin()
       LOCK(cpu_hotplug.lock)
     cpu_notify()

      acpi_processor_hotplug()
       cpuidle_pause_and_lock()
        LOCK(cpuidle_lock)
    
    2) cpuidle_lock -> cpu_hotplug.lock
    acpi_os_execute_deferred() workqueue
     ...
     acpi_processor_cst_has_changed()
      cpuidle_pause_and_lock()
       LOCK(cpuidle_lock)
      get_online_cpus()
       LOCK(cpu_hotplug.lock)
    
    Fix this by reversing the order acpi_processor_cst_has_changed() does
    thigs -- let it first execute the protection against CPU hotplug by
    calling get_online_cpus() and obtain the cpuidle lock only after that (and
    perform the symmentric change when allowing CPUs hotplug again and
    dropping cpuidle lock).

    ACPI / scan: not cache _SUN value in struct acpi_device_pnp
    
    commit a383b68d9fe9864c4d3b86f67ad6488f58136435 upstream.
    
    The _SUN device indentification object is not guaranteed to return
    the same value every time it is executed, so we should not cache its
    return value, but rather execute it every time as needed.  If it is
    cached, an incorrect stale value may be used in some situations.
    
    This issue was exposed by commit 202317a573b2 (ACPI / scan: Add
    acpi_device objects for all device nodes in the namespace).  Fix it
    by avoiding to cache the return value of _SUN.

    ACPI: Run fixed event device notifications in process context
    
    commit 236105db632c6279a020f78c83e22eaef746006b upstream.
    
    Currently, notify callbacks for fixed button events are run from
    interrupt context.  That is not necessary and after commit 0bf6368ee8f2
    (ACPI / button: Add ACPI Button event via netlink routine) it causes
    netlink routines to be called from interrupt context which is not
    correct.
    
    Also, that is different from non-fixed device events (including
    non-fixed button events) whose notify callbacks are all executed from
    process context.
    
    For the above reasons, make fixed button device notify callbacks run
    in process context which will avoid the deadlock when using netlink
    to report button events to user space.
    
    Fixes: 0bf6368ee8f2 (ACPI / button: Add ACPI Button event via netlink routine)

    ACPI / hotplug: Check scan handlers in acpi_scan_hot_remove()
    
    commit dee1592638ab7ea35a32179b73f9284dead49c03 upstream.
    
    When ACPI_HOTPLUG_MEMORY is not configured, memory_device_handler.attach
    is not set.  In acpi_scan_attach_handler(), the acpi_device->handler will
    not be initialized.
    
    In acpi_scan_hot_remove(), it doesn't check if acpi_device->handler is NULL.
    If we do memory hot-remove without ACPI_HOTPLUG_MEMORY configured, the kernel
    will panic.

    bfa: Fix undefined bit shift on big-endian architectures with 32-bit DMA address

    each way.  In two places the argument type is dma_addr_t, which may be
    32-bit, in which case the effect of the bit shift is undefined:

    commit 3ad80b828b2533f37c221e2df155774efd6ed814 upstream.
    
    Fix a long standing bug in the read register routing of adau1701.
    The bytes arrive in the buffer in big-endian, so the result has to be
    shifted before and-ing the bytes in the loop.

    commit d3d4e5247b013008a39e4d5f69ce4c60ed57f997 upstream.
    
    We should save/restore relevant I2S registers regardless of
    the dai->active flag, otherwise some settings are being lost
    after system suspend/resume cycle. E.g. I2S slave mode set only
    during dai initialization is not preserved and the device ends
    up in master mode after system resume.

    commit b38314179c9ccb789e6fe967cff171fa817e8978 upstream.
    
    wm1811_micd_stop takes the accdet_lock mutex, and is called from two
    places, one of which is already holding the accdet_lock. This obviously
    causes a lock up.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by removing the lock from wm1811_micd_stop
    and ensuring that it is always locked externally.

    MIPS: OCTEON: make get_system_type() thread-safe
    
    commit 608308682addfdc7b8e2aee88f0e028331d88e4d upstream.
    
    get_system_type() is not thread-safe on OCTEON. It uses static data,
    also more dangerous issue is that it's calling cvmx_fuse_read_byte()
    every time without any synchronization. Currently it's possible to get
    processes stuck looping forever in kernel simply by launching multiple
    readers of /proc/cpuinfo:
    
            (while true; do cat /proc/cpuinfo > /dev/null; done) &
            (while true; do cat /proc/cpuinfo > /dev/null; done) &
            ...
    
    Fix by initializing the system type string only once during the early
    boot.

    MIPS: Remove BUG_ON(!is_fpu_owner()) in do_ade()
    
    commit 2e5767a27337812f6850b3fa362419e2f085e5c3 upstream.
    
    In do_ade(), is_fpu_owner() isn't preempt-safe. For example, when an
    unaligned ldc1 is executed, do_cpu() is called and then FPU will be
    enabled (and TIF_USEDFPU will be set for the current process). Then,
    do_ade() is called because the access is unaligned.  If the current
    process is preempted at this time, TIF_USEDFPU will be cleard.  So when
    the process is scheduled again, BUG_ON(!is_fpu_owner()) is triggered.
    
    This small program can trigger this BUG in a preemptible kernel:
    
    int main (int argc, char *argv[])
    {
            double u64[2];
    
            while (1) {
                    asm volatile (
                            ".set push \n\t"
                            ".set noreorder \n\t"
                            "ldc1 $f3, 4(%0) \n\t"
                            ".set pop \n\t"
                            ::"r"(u64):
                    );
            }
    
            return 0;
    }

    MIPS: Prevent user from setting FCSR cause bits
    
    commit b1442d39fac2fcfbe6a4814979020e993ca59c9e upstream.
    
    If one or more matching FCSR cause & enable bits are set in saved thread
    context then when that context is restored the kernel will take an FP
    exception. This is of course undesirable and considered an oops, leading
    to the kernel writing a backtrace to the console and potentially
    rebooting depending upon the configuration. Thus the kernel avoids this
    situation by clearing the cause bits of the FCSR register when handling
    FP exceptions and after emulating FP instructions.
    
    However the kernel does not prevent userland from setting arbitrary FCSR
    cause & enable bits via ptrace, using either the PTRACE_POKEUSR or
    PTRACE_SETFPREGS requests. This means userland can trivially cause the
    kernel to oops on any system with an FPU. Prevent this from happening
    by clearing the cause bits when writing to the saved FCSR context via
    ptrace.
    
    This problem appears to exist at least back to the beginning of the git
    era in the PTRACE_POKEUSR case.

    MIPS: ptrace: Change GP regset to use correct core dump register layout
    
    commit c23b3d1a53119849dc3c23c417124deb067aa33d upstream.
    
    Commit 6a9c001b7ec3 ("MIPS: Switch ELF core dumper to use regsets.")
    switched the core dumper to use regsets, however the GP regset code
    simply makes a direct copy of the kernel's pt_regs, which does not
    match the original core dump register layout as defined in asm/reg.h.
    Furthermore, the definition of pt_regs can vary with certain Kconfig
    variables, therefore the GP regset can never be relied upon to return
    registers in the same layout.
    
    Therefore, this patch changes the GP regset to match the original core
    dump layout. The layout differs for 32- and 64-bit processes, so
    separate implementations of the get/set functions are added for the
    32- and 64-bit regsets.

    MIPS: O32/32-bit: Fix bug which can cause incorrect system call restarts
    
    commit e90e6fddc57055c4c6b57f92787fea1c065d440b upstream.
    
    On 32-bit/O32, pt_regs has a padding area at the beginning into which the
    syscall arguments passed via the user stack are copied. 4 arguments
    totalling 16 bytes are copied to offset 16 bytes into this area, however
    the area is only 24 bytes long. This means the last 2 arguments overwrite
    pt_regs->regs[{0,1}].
    
    If a syscall function returns an error, handle_sys stores the original
    syscall number in pt_regs->regs[0] for syscall restart. signal.c checks
    whether regs[0] is non-zero, if it is it will check whether the syscall
    return value is one of the ERESTART* codes to see if it must be
    restarted.
    
    Should a syscall be made that results in a non-zero value being copied
    off the user stack into regs[0], and then returns a positive (non-error)
    value that matches one of the ERESTART* error codes, this can be mistaken
    for requiring a syscall restart.
    
    While the possibility for this to occur has always existed, it is made
    much more likely to occur by commit 46e12c07b3b9 ("MIPS: O32 / 32-bit:
    Always copy 4 stack arguments."), since now every syscall will copy 4
    arguments and overwrite regs[0], rather than just those with 7 or 8
    arguments.
    
    Since that commit, booting Debian under a 32-bit MIPS kernel almost
    always results in a hang early in boot, due to a wait4 syscall returning
    a PID that matches one of the ERESTART* codes, which then causes an
    incorrect restart of the syscall.
    
    The problem is fixed by increasing the size of the padding area so that
    arguments copied off the stack will not overwrite pt_regs->regs[{0,1}].

    scsi_transport_srp: Fix fast_io_fail_tmo=dev_loss_tmo=off behavior
    
    commit cd53eb686d2418eda938aad3c9da42b7dfa9351f upstream.
    
    If scsi_remove_host() is called while an rport is in the blocked state
    then scsi_remove_host() will only finish if the rport is unblocked
    from inside a timer function. Make sure that an rport only enters the
    blocked state if a timer will be started that will unblock it. This
    avoids that unloading the ib_srp kernel module after having
    disconnected the initiator from the target system results in a
    deadlock if both the fast_io_fail_tmo and dev_loss_tmo parameters have
    been set to "off".

    trigger VPD page inquiries on devices that are known to support them.

    scsi_scan: Restrict sequential scan to 256 LUNs
    
    commit 22ffeb48b7584d6cd50f2a595ed6065d86a87459 upstream.
    
    Sequential scan for more than 256 LUNs is very fragile as
    LUNs might not be numbered sequentially after that point.
    
    SAM revisions later than SCSI-3 impose a structure on
    LUNs larger than 256, making LUN numbers between 256
    and 16384 illegal.
    SCSI-3, however allows for plain 64-bit numbers with
    no internal structure.
    
    So restrict sequential LUN scan to 256 LUNs and add a
    new blacklist flag 'BLIST_SCSI3LUN' to scan up to
    max_lun devices.

    Based on the negotiated VMBUS protocol version, we adjust the size of the storage
    protocol messages. The two sizes we currently handle are pre-win8 and post-win8.
    In WS2012 R2, we are negotiating higher VMBUS protocol version than the win8
    version. Make adjustments to correctly handle this.

    commit 969b7b208f7408712a3526856e4ae60ad13f6928 upstream.
    
    As per ISA, for 4k base page size we compare 14..65 bits of VA specified
    with the entry_VA in tlb. That implies we need to make sure we do a
    tlbie with all the possible 4k va we used to access the 16MB hugepage.
    With 64k base page size we compare 14..57 bits of VA. Hence we cannot
    ignore the lower 24 bits of va while tlbie .We also cannot tlb
    invalidate a 16MB entry with just one tlbie instruction because
    we don't track which va was used to instantiate the tlb entry.

    powerpc/thp: Handle combo pages in invalidate
    
    commit fc0479557572375100ef16c71170b29a98e0d69a upstream.
    
    If we changed base page size of the segment, either via sub_page_protect
    or via remap_4k_pfn, we do a demote_segment which doesn't flush the hash
    table entries. We do a lazy hash page table flush for all mapped pages
    in the demoted segment. This happens when we handle hash page fault for
    these pages.
    
    We use _PAGE_COMBO bit along with _PAGE_HASHPTE to indicate whether a
    pte is backed by 4K hash pte. If we find _PAGE_COMBO not set on the pte,
    that implies that we could possibly have older 64K hash pte entries in
    the hash page table and we need to invalidate those entries.
    
    Use _PAGE_COMBO to determine the page size with which we should
    invalidate the hash table entries on unmap.

    powerpc/pseries: Avoid deadlock on removing ddw
    
    commit 5efbabe09d986f25c02d19954660238fcd7f008a upstream.
    
    Function remove_ddw() could be called in of_reconfig_notifier and
    we potentially remove the dynamic DMA window property, which invokes
    of_reconfig_notifier again. Eventually, it leads to the deadlock as
    following backtrace shows.
    
    The patch fixes the above issue by deferring releasing the dynamic
    DMA window property while releasing the device node.

    powerpc/mm: Use read barrier when creating real_pte
    
    commit 85c1fafd7262e68ad821ee1808686b1392b1167d upstream.
    
    On ppc64 we support 4K hash pte with 64K page size. That requires
    us to track the hash pte slot information on a per 4k basis. We do that
    by storing the slot details in the second half of pte page. The pte bit
    _PAGE_COMBO is used to indicate whether the second half need to be
    looked while building real_pte. We need to use read memory barrier while
    doing that so that load of hidx is not reordered w.r.t _PAGE_COMBO
    check. On the store side we already do a lwsync in __hash_page_4K

    CAPABILITIES: remove undefined caps from all processes
    
    commit 7d8b6c63751cfbbe5eef81a48c22978b3407a3ad upstream.
    
    This is effectively a revert of 7b9a7ec565505699f503b4fcf61500dceb36e744
    plus fixing it a different way...
    
    We found, when trying to run an application from an application which
    had dropped privs that the kernel does security checks on undefined
    capability bits.  This was ESPECIALLY difficult to debug as those
    undefined bits are hidden from /proc/$PID/status.
    
    Consider a root application which drops all capabilities from ALL 4
    capability sets.  We assume, since the application is going to set
    eff/perm/inh from an array that it will clear not only the defined caps
    less than CAP_LAST_CAP, but also the higher 28ish bits which are
    undefined future capabilities.
    
    The BSET gets cleared differently.  Instead it is cleared one bit at a
    time.  The problem here is that in security/commoncap.c::cap_task_prctl()
    we actually check the validity of a capability being read.  So any task
    which attempts to 'read all things set in bset' followed by 'unset all
    things set in bset' will not even attempt to unset the undefined bits
    higher than CAP_LAST_CAP.
    
    So the 'parent' will look something like:
    CapInh: 0000000000000000
    CapPrm: 0000000000000000
    CapEff: 0000000000000000
    CapBnd: ffffffc000000000
    
    All of this 'should' be fine.  Given that these are undefined bits that
    aren't supposed to have anything to do with permissions.  But they do...
    
    So lets now consider a task which cleared the eff/perm/inh completely
    and cleared all of the valid caps in the bset (but not the invalid caps
    it couldn't read out of the kernel).  We know that this is exactly what
    the libcap-ng library does and what the go capabilities library does.
    They both leave you in that above situation if you try to clear all of
    you capapabilities from all 4 sets.  If that root task calls execve()
    the child task will pick up all caps not blocked by the bset.  The bset
    however does not block bits higher than CAP_LAST_CAP.  So now the child
    task has bits in eff which are not in the parent.  These are
    'meaningless' undefined bits, but still bits which the parent doesn't
    have.
    
    The problem is now in cred_cap_issubset() (or any operation which does a
    subset test) as the child, while a subset for valid cap bits, is not a
    subset for invalid cap bits!  So now we set durring commit creds that
    the child is not dumpable.  Given it is 'more priv' than its parent.  It
    also means the parent cannot ptrace the child and other stupidity.
    
    The solution here:
    1) stop hiding capability bits in status
            This makes debugging easier!
    
    2) stop giving any task undefined capability bits.  it's simple, it you
    don't put those invalid bits in CAP_FULL_SET you won't get them in init
    and you won't get them in any other task either.
            This fixes the cap_issubset() tests and resulting fallout (which
            made the init task in a docker container untraceable among other
            things)
    
    3) mask out undefined bits when sys_capset() is called as it might use
    ~0, ~0 to denote 'all capabilities' for backward/forward compatibility.
            This lets 'capsh --caps="all=eip" -- -c /bin/bash' run.
    
    4) mask out undefined bit when we read a file capability off of disk as
    again likely all bits are set in the xattr for forward/backward
    compatibility.
            This lets 'setcap all+pe /bin/bash; /bin/bash' run

    spi: omap2-mcspi: Configure hardware when slave driver changes mode
    
    commit 97ca0d6cc118716840ea443e010cb3d5f2d25eaf upstream.
    
    Commit id 2bd16e3e23d9df41592c6b257c59b6860a9cc3ea
    (spi: omap2-mcspi: Do not configure the controller
    on each transfer unless needed) does its job too
    well so omap2_mcspi_setup_transfer() isn't called
    even when an SPI slave driver changes 'spi->mode'.
    The result is that the mode requested by the SPI
    slave driver never takes effect.
    
    Fix this by adding the 'mode' member to the
    omap2_mcspi_cs structure which holds the mode
    value that the hardware is configured for.
    When the SPI slave driver changes 'spi->mode'
    it will be different than the value of this new
    member and the SPI master driver will know that
    the hardware must be reconfigured (by calling
    omap2_mcspi_setup_transfer()).

    spi: orion: fix incorrect handling of cell-index DT property
    
    commit e06871cd2c92e5c65d7ca1d32866b4ca5dd4ac30 upstream.
    
    In commit f814f9ac5a81 ("spi/orion: add device tree binding"), Device
    Tree support was added to the spi-orion driver. However, this commit
    reads the "cell-index" property, without taking into account the fact
    that DT properties are big-endian encoded.
    
    Since most of the platforms using spi-orion with DT have apparently
    not used anything but cell-index = <0>, the problem was not
    visible. But as soon as one starts using cell-index = <1>, the problem
    becomes clearly visible, as the master->bus_num gets a wrong value
    (actually it gets the value 0, which conflicts with the first bus that
    has cell-index = <0>).
    
    This commit fixes that by using of_property_read_u32() to read the
    property value, which does the appropriate endianness conversion when
    needed.

    X-Patchwork-Delegate: mchehab@redhat.com
    Remove the CONFIG_ prefix from two Kconfig symbols in a dependency for
    SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS. This prefix is invalid inside Kconfig files.
    
    Note that the current (common sense) dependency on SMS_USB_DRV and
    SMS_SDIO_DRV being equal ensures that SMS_SIANO_DEBUGFS will not
    violate its constraints. These constraint are that:
    - it should only be built if SMS_USB_DRV is set;
    - it can't be builtin if USB support is modular.
    
    So drop the dependency on SMS_USB_DRV, as it is unneeded.

    media: mt9v032: fix hblank calculation
    
    commit f17bc3f4707eb87bdb80b895911c551cdd606fbd upstream.
    
    Since (min_row_time - crop->width) can be negative, we have to do a signed
    comparison here. Otherwise max_t casts the negative value to unsigned int
    and sets min_hblank to that invalid value.

    media: media-device: Remove duplicated memset() in media_enum_entities()
    
    commit f8ca6ac00d2ba24c5557f08f81439cd3432f0802 upstream.
    
    After the zeroing the whole struct struct media_entity_desc u_ent,
    it is no longer necessary to memset(0) its u_ent.name field.

    media: au0828: Only alt setting logic when needed
    
    commit 64ea37bbd8a5815522706f0099ad3f11c7537e15 upstream.
    
    It seems that there's a bug at au0828 hardware/firmware
    related to alternate setting: when the device is already at
    alt 5, a further call causes the URBs to receive -ESHUTDOWN.
    
    I found two different encarnations of this issue:
    
    1) at qv4l2, it fails the second time we try to open the
    video screen;
    2) at xawtv, when audio underrun occurs, with is very
    frequent, at least on my test machine.
    
    The fix is simple: just check if alt=5 before calling
    set_usb_interface().

    media: xc4000: Fix get_frequency()
    
    commit 4c07e32884ab69574cfd9eb4de3334233c938071 upstream.
    
    The programmed frequency on xc4000 is not the middle
    frequency, but the initial frequency on the bandwidth range.
    However, the DVB API works with the middle frequency.
    
    This works fine on set_frontend, as the device calculates
    the needed offset. However, at get_frequency(), the returned
    value is the initial frequency. That's generally not a big
    problem on most drivers, however, starting with changeset
    6fe1099c7aec, the frequency drift is taken into account at
    dib7000p driver.
    
    This broke support for PCTV 340e, with uses dib7000p demod and
    xc4000 tuner.
