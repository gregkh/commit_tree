    vga_switcheroo: Fix missing gpu_bound call at audio client registration
    
    commit fc09ab7a767394f9ecdad84ea6e85d68b83c8e21 upstream.
    
    The commit 37a3a98ef601 ("ALSA: hda - Enable runtime PM only for
    discrete GPU") added a new ops gpu_bound to be called when GPU gets
    bound.  The patch overlooked, however, that vga_switcheroo_enable() is
    called only once at GPU is bound.  When an audio client is registered
    after that point, it would miss the gpu_bound call.  This leads to the
    unexpected lack of runtime PM in HD-audio side.
    
    For addressing that regression, just call gpu_bound callback manually
    at vga_switcheroo_register_audio_client() when the GPU was already
    bound.

    bpf: wait for running BPF programs when updating map-in-map
    
    commit 1ae80cf31938c8f77c37a29bbe29e7f1cd492be8 upstream.
    
    The map-in-map frequently serves as a mechanism for atomic
    snapshotting of state that a BPF program might record.  The current
    implementation is dangerous to use in this way, however, since
    userspace has no way of knowing when all programs that might have
    retrieved the "old" value of the map may have completed.
    
    This change ensures that map update operations on map-in-map map types
    always wait for all references to the old map to drop before returning
    to userspace.

    userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDs
    
    commit d2f007dbe7e4c9583eea6eb04d60001e85c6f1bd upstream.
    
    The current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
    maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
    doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.
    
    This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
    incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
    inode_owner_or_capable() and privileged_wrt_inode_uidgid(), so a process
    can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.
    
    To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower_first" members of extents
    in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
    map is sorted *after* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
    break the sorting).
    
    This is CVE-2018-18955.

    vt: fix broken display when running aptitude
    
    commit 943210ba807ec50aafa2fa7b13bd6d36a478969b upstream.
    
    If you run aptitude on framebuffer console, the display is corrupted. The
    corruption is caused by the commit d8ae7242. The patch adds "offset" to
    "start" when calling scr_memsetw, but it forgets to do the same addition
    on a subsequent call to do_update_region.

    Btrfs: fix use-after-free when dumping free space
    
    commit 9084cb6a24bf5838a665af92ded1af8363f9e563 upstream.
    
    We were iterating a block group's free space cache rbtree without locking
    first the lock that protects it (the free_space_ctl->free_space_offset
    rbtree is protected by the free_space_ctl->tree_lock spinlock).
    
    KASAN reported an use-after-free problem when iterating such a rbtree due
    to a concurrent rbtree delete:

    Btrfs: fix use-after-free during inode eviction
    
    commit 421f0922a2cfb0c75acd9746454aaa576c711a65 upstream.
    
    At inode.c:evict_inode_truncate_pages(), when we iterate over the
    inode's extent states, we access an extent state record's "state" field
    after we unlocked the inode's io tree lock. This can lead to a
    use-after-free issue because after we unlock the io tree that extent
    state record might have been freed due to being merged into another
    adjacent extent state record (a previous inflight bio for a read
    operation finished in the meanwhile which unlocked a range in the io
    tree and cause a merge of extent state records, as explained in the
    comment before the while loop added in commit 6ca0709756710 ("Btrfs: fix
    hang during inode eviction due to concurrent readahead")).
    
    Fix this by keeping a copy of the extent state's flags in a local
    variable and using it after unlocking the io tree.

    btrfs: move the dio_sem higher up the callchain
    
    commit c495144bc6962186feae31d687596d2472000e45 upstream.
    
    We're getting a lockdep splat because we take the dio_sem under the
    log_mutex.  What we really need is to protect fsync() from logging an
    extent map for an extent we never waited on higher up, so just guard the
    whole thing with dio_sem.

    btrfs: don't run delayed_iputs in commit
    
    commit 30928e9baac238a7330085a1c5747f0b5df444b4 upstream.
    
    This could result in a really bad case where we do something like
    
    evict
      evict_refill_and_join
        btrfs_commit_transaction
          btrfs_run_delayed_iputs
            evict
              evict_refill_and_join
                btrfs_commit_transaction
    ... forever
    
    We have plenty of other places where we run delayed iputs that are much
    safer, let those do the work.

    btrfs: fix insert_reserved error handling
    
    commit 80ee54bfe8a3850015585ebc84e8d207fcae6831 upstream.
    
    We were not handling the reserved byte accounting properly for data
    references.  Metadata was fine, if it errored out the error paths would
    free the bytes_reserved count and pin the extent, but it even missed one
    of the error cases.  So instead move this handling up into
    run_one_delayed_ref so we are sure that both cases are properly cleaned
    up in case of a transaction abort.

    btrfs: only free reserved extent if we didn't insert it
    
    commit 49940bdd57779c78462da7aa5a8650b2fea8c2ff upstream.
    
    When we insert the file extent once the ordered extent completes we free
    the reserved extent reservation as it'll have been migrated to the
    bytes_used counter.  However if we error out after this step we'll still
    clear the reserved extent reservation, resulting in a negative
    accounting of the reserved bytes for the block group and space info.
    Fix this by only doing the free if we didn't successfully insert a file
    extent for this extent.

    btrfs: don't use ctl->free_space for max_extent_size
    
    commit fb5c39d7a887108087de6ff93d3f326b01b4ef41 upstream.
    
    max_extent_size is supposed to be the largest contiguous range for the
    space info, and ctl->free_space is the total free space in the block
    group.  We need to keep track of these separately and _only_ use the
    max_free_space if we don't have a max_extent_size, as that means our
    original request was too large to search any of the block groups for and
    therefore wouldn't have a max_extent_size set.

    commit 21a94f7acf0f748599ea552af5d9ee7d7e41c72f upstream.
    
    If we use up our block group before allocating a new one we'll easily
    get a max_extent_size that's set really really low, which will result in
    a lot of fragmentation.  We need to make sure we're resetting the
    max_extent_size when we add a new chunk or add new space.

    commit 5ce555578e0919237fa4bda92b4670e2dd176f85 upstream.

    This is because at write_one_cache_group() when we are COWing a leaf from
    the extent tree we end up allocating a new block group (chunk) and,
    because we have hit a threshold on the number of bytes reserved for system
    chunks, we attempt to finalize the creation of new block groups from the
    current transaction, by calling btrfs_create_pending_block_groups().
    However here we also need to modify the extent tree in order to insert
    a block group item, and if the location for this new block group item
    happens to be in the same leaf that we were COWing earlier, we deadlock
    since btrfs_search_slot() tries to write lock the extent buffer that we
    locked before at write_one_cache_group().
    
    We have already hit similar cases in the past and commit d9a0540a79f8
    ("Btrfs: fix deadlock when finalizing block group creation") fixed some
    of those cases by delaying the creation of pending block groups at the
    known specific spots that could lead to a deadlock. This change reworks
    that commit to be more generic so that we don't have to add similar logic
    to every possible path that can lead to a deadlock. This is done by
    making __btrfs_cow_block() disallowing the creation of new block groups
    (setting the transaction's can_flush_pending_bgs to false) before it
    attempts to allocate a new extent buffer for either the extent, chunk or
    device trees, since those are the trees that pending block creation
    modifies. Once the new extent buffer is allocated, it allows creation of
    pending block groups to happen again.
    
    This change depends on a recent patch from Josef which is not yet in
    Linus' tree, named "btrfs: make sure we create all new block groups" in
    order to avoid occasional warnings at btrfs_trans_release_chunk_metadata().

    Btrfs: fix assertion on fsync of regular file when using no-holes feature
    
    commit 7ed586d0a8241e81d58c656c5b315f781fa6fc97 upstream.
    
    When using the NO_HOLES feature and logging a regular file, we were
    expecting that if we find an inline extent, that either its size in RAM
    (uncompressed and unenconded) matches the size of the file or if it does
    not, that it matches the sector size and it represents compressed data.
    This assertion does not cover a case where the length of the inline extent
    is smaller than the sector size and also smaller the file's size, such
    case is possible through fallocate. Example:
    
      $ mkfs.btrfs -f -O no-holes /dev/sdb
      $ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
    
      $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xb60 0 21" /mnt/foobar
      $ xfs_io -c "falloc 40 40" /mnt/foobar
      $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/foobar
    
    In the above example we trigger the assertion because the inline extent's
    length is 21 bytes while the file size is 80 bytes. The fallocate() call
    merely updated the file's size and did not touch the existing inline
    extent, as expected.
    
    So fix this by adjusting the assertion so that an inline extent length
    smaller than the file size is valid if the file size is smaller than the
    filesystem's sector size.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    Btrfs: fix null pointer dereference on compressed write path error
    
    commit 3527a018c00e5dbada2f9d7ed5576437b6dd5cfb upstream.
    
    At inode.c:compress_file_range(), under the "free_pages_out" label, we can
    end up dereferencing the "pages" pointer when it has a NULL value. This
    case happens when "start" has a value of 0 and we fail to allocate memory
    for the "pages" pointer. When that happens we jump to the "cont" label and
    then enter the "if (start == 0)" branch where we immediately call the
    cow_file_range_inline() function. If that function returns 0 (success
    creating an inline extent) or an error (like -ENOMEM for example) we jump
    to the "free_pages_out" label and then access "pages[i]" leading to a NULL
    pointer dereference, since "nr_pages" has a value greater than zero at
    that point.
    
    Fix this by setting "nr_pages" to 0 when we fail to allocate memory for
    the "pages" pointer.

                 ^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^ not cleared
    
    [CAUSE]
    Before rescan we call qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() to zero out all
    qgroups' accounting numbers.
    
    However we don't mark all qgroups dirty, but rely on rescan to do so.
    
    If we have any high level qgroup without children, it won't be marked
    dirty during rescan, since we cannot reach that qgroup.
    
    This will cause QGROUP_INFO items of childless qgroups never get updated
    in the quota tree, thus their numbers will stay the same in "btrfs
    qgroup show" output.
    
    [FIX]
    Just mark all qgroups dirty in qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking(), so even if
    we have childless qgroups, their QGROUP_INFO items will still get
    updated during rescan.

    Btrfs: fix wrong dentries after fsync of file that got its parent replaced
    
    commit 0f375eed92b5a407657532637ed9652611a682f5 upstream.
    
    In a scenario like the following:
    
      mkdir /mnt/A               # inode 258
      mkdir /mnt/B               # inode 259
      touch /mnt/B/bar           # inode 260
    
      sync
    
      mv /mnt/B/bar /mnt/A/bar
      mv -T /mnt/A /mnt/B
      fsync /mnt/B/bar
    
      <power fail>
    
    After replaying the log we end up with file bar having 2 hard links, both
    with the name 'bar' and one in the directory with inode number 258 and the
    other in the directory with inode number 259. Also, we end up with the
    directory inode 259 still existing and with the directory inode 258 still
    named as 'A', instead of 'B'. In this scenario, file 'bar' should only
    have one hard link, located at directory inode 258, the directory inode
    259 should not exist anymore and the name for directory inode 258 should
    be 'B'.
    
    This incorrect behaviour happens because when attempting to log the old
    parents of an inode, we skip any parents that no longer exist. Fix this
    by forcing a full commit if an old parent no longer exists.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    Btrfs: fix warning when replaying log after fsync of a tmpfile
    
    commit f2d72f42d5fa3bf33761d9e47201745f624fcff5 upstream.
    
    When replaying a log which contains a tmpfile (which necessarily has a
    link count of 0) we end up calling inc_nlink(), at
    fs/btrfs/tree-log.c:replay_one_buffer(), which produces a warning like
    the following:

    This happens because the inode does not have the flag I_LINKABLE set,
    which is a runtime only flag, not meant to be persisted, set when the
    inode is created through open(2) if the flag O_EXCL is not passed to it.
    Except for the warning, there are no other consequences (like corruptions
    or metadata inconsistencies).
    
    Since it's pointless to replay a tmpfile as it would be deleted in a
    later phase of the log replay procedure (it has a link count of 0), fix
    this by not logging tmpfiles and if a tmpfile is found in a log (created
    by a kernel without this change), skip the replay of the inode.
    
    A test case for fstests follows soon.

    btrfs: make sure we create all new block groups
    
    commit 545e3366db823dc3342ca9d7fea803f829c9062f upstream.
    
    Allocating new chunks modifies both the extent and chunk tree, which can
    trigger new chunk allocations.  So instead of doing list_for_each_safe,
    just do while (!list_empty()) so we make sure we don't exit with other
    pending bg's still on our list.

    btrfs: protect space cache inode alloc with GFP_NOFS
    
    commit 84de76a2fb217dc1b6bc2965cc397d1648aa1404 upstream.
    
    If we're allocating a new space cache inode it's likely going to be
    under a transaction handle, so we need to use memalloc_nofs_save() in
    order to avoid deadlocks, and more importantly lockdep messages that
    make xfstests fail.

    Btrfs: don't clean dirty pages during buffered writes
    
    commit 7703bdd8d23e6ef057af3253958a793ec6066b28 upstream.
    
    During buffered writes, we follow this basic series of steps:
    
    again:
            lock all the pages
            wait for writeback on all the pages
            Take the extent range lock
            wait for ordered extents on the whole range
            clean all the pages
    
            if (copy_from_user_in_atomic() hits a fault) {
                    drop our locks
                    goto again;
            }
    
            dirty all the pages
            release all the locks
    
    The extra waiting, cleaning and locking are there to make sure we don't
    modify pages in flight to the drive, after they've been crc'd.
    
    If some of the pages in the range were already dirty when the write
    began, and we need to goto again, we create a window where a dirty page
    has been cleaned and unlocked.  It may be reclaimed before we're able to
    lock it again, which means we'll read the old contents off the drive and
    lose any modifications that had been pending writeback.
    
    We don't actually need to clean the pages.  All of the other locking in
    place makes sure we don't start IO on the pages, so we can just leave
    them dirty for the duration of the write.

    btrfs: wait on caching when putting the bg cache
    
    commit 3aa7c7a31c26321696b92841d5103461c6f3f517 upstream.
    
    While testing my backport I noticed there was a panic if I ran
    generic/416 generic/417 generic/418 all in a row.  This just happened to
    uncover a race where we had outstanding IO after we destroy all of our
    workqueues, and then we'd go to queue the endio work on those free'd
    workqueues.
    
    This is because we aren't waiting for the caching threads to be done
    before freeing everything up, so to fix this make sure we wait on any
    outstanding caching that's being done before we free up the block group,
    so we're sure to be done with all IO by the time we get to
    btrfs_stop_all_workers().  This fixes the panic I was seeing
    consistently in testing.

    btrfs: keep trim from interfering with transaction commits
    
    commit fee7acc361314df6561208c2d3c0882d663dd537 upstream.
    
    Commit 499f377f49f08 (btrfs: iterate over unused chunk space in FITRIM)
    fixed free space trimming, but introduced latency when it was running.
    This is due to it pinning the transaction using both a incremented
    refcount and holding the commit root sem for the duration of a single
    trim operation.
    
    This was to ensure safety but it's unnecessary.  We already hold the the
    chunk mutex so we know that the chunk we're using can't be allocated
    while we're trimming it.
    
    In order to check against chunks allocated already in this transaction,
    we need to check the pending chunks list.  To to that safely without
    joining the transaction (or attaching than then having to commit it) we
    need to ensure that the dev root's commit root doesn't change underneath
    us and the pending chunk lists stays around until we're done with it.
    
    We can ensure the former by holding the commit root sem and the latter
    by pinning the transaction.  We do this now, but the critical section
    covers the trim operation itself and we don't need to do that.
    
    This patch moves the pinning and unpinning logic into helpers and unpins
    the transaction after performing the search and check for pending
    chunks.
    
    Limiting the critical section of the transaction pinning improves the
    latency substantially on slower storage (e.g. image files over NFS).

    btrfs: don't attempt to trim devices that don't support it
    
    commit 0be88e367fd8fbdb45257615d691f4675dda062f upstream.
    
    We check whether any device the file system is using supports discard in
    the ioctl call, but then we attempt to trim free extents on every device
    regardless of whether discard is supported.  Due to the way we mask off
    EOPNOTSUPP, we can end up issuing the trim operations on each free range
    on devices that don't support it, just wasting time.

    btrfs: iterate all devices during trim, instead of fs_devices::alloc_list
    
    commit d4e329de5e5e21594df2e0dd59da9acee71f133b upstream.
    
    btrfs_trim_fs iterates over the fs_devices->alloc_list while holding the
    device_list_mutex.  The problem is that ->alloc_list is protected by the
    chunk mutex.  We don't want to hold the chunk mutex over the trim of the
    entire file system.  Fortunately, the ->dev_list list is protected by
    the dev_list mutex and while it will give us all devices, including
    read-only devices, we already just skip the read-only devices.  Then we
    can continue to take and release the chunk mutex while scanning each
    device.

    btrfs: Ensure btrfs_trim_fs can trim the whole filesystem
    
    commit 6ba9fc8e628becf0e3ec94083450d089b0dec5f5 upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    fstrim on some btrfs only trims the unallocated space, not trimming any
    space in existing block groups.
    
    [CAUSE]
    Before fstrim_range passed to btrfs_trim_fs(), it gets truncated to
    range [0, super->total_bytes).  So later btrfs_trim_fs() will only be
    able to trim block groups in range [0, super->total_bytes).
    
    While for btrfs, any bytenr aligned to sectorsize is valid, since btrfs
    uses its logical address space, there is nothing limiting the location
    where we put block groups.
    
    For filesystem with frequent balance, it's quite easy to relocate all
    block groups and bytenr of block groups will start beyond
    super->total_bytes.
    
    In that case, btrfs will not trim existing block groups.
    
    [FIX]
    Just remove the truncation in btrfs_ioctl_fitrim(), so btrfs_trim_fs()
    can get the unmodified range, which is normally set to [0, U64_MAX].

    btrfs: Enhance btrfs_trim_fs function to handle error better
    
    commit 93bba24d4b5ad1e5cd8b43f64e66ff9d6355dd20 upstream.
    
    Function btrfs_trim_fs() doesn't handle errors in a consistent way. If
    error happens when trimming existing block groups, it will skip the
    remaining blocks and continue to trim unallocated space for each device.
    
    The return value will only reflect the final error from device trimming.
    
    This patch will fix such behavior by:
    
    1) Recording the last error from block group or device trimming
       The return value will also reflect the last error during trimming.
       Make developer more aware of the problem.
    
    2) Continuing trimming if possible
       If we failed to trim one block group or device, we could still try
       the next block group or device.
    
    3) Report number of failures during block group and device trimming
       It would be less noisy, but still gives user a brief summary of
       what's going wrong.
    
    Such behavior can avoid confusion for cases like failure to trim the
    first block group and then only unallocated space is trimmed.

    btrfs: fix error handling in btrfs_dev_replace_start
    
    commit 5c06147128fbbdf7a84232c5f0d808f53153defe upstream.
    
    When we fail to start a transaction in btrfs_dev_replace_start, we leave
    dev_replace->replace_start set to STARTED but clear ->srcdev and
    ->tgtdev.  Later, that can result in an Oops in
    btrfs_dev_replace_progress when having state set to STARTED or SUSPENDED
    implies that ->srcdev is valid.
    
    Also fix error handling when the state is already STARTED or SUSPENDED
    while starting.  That, too, will clear ->srcdev and ->tgtdev even though
    it doesn't own them.  This should be an impossible case to hit since we
    should be protected by the BTRFS_FS_EXCL_OP bit being set.  Let's add an
    ASSERT there while we're at it.

    btrfs: locking: Add extra check in btrfs_init_new_buffer() to avoid deadlock
    
    commit b72c3aba09a53fc7c1824250d71180ca154517a7 upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    For certain crafted image, whose csum root leaf has missing backref, if
    we try to trigger write with data csum, it could cause deadlock with the
    following kernel WARN_ON():

       kthread+0x180/0x1d0
       ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40
    
    [CAUSE]
    That crafted image has missing backref for csum tree root leaf.  And
    when we try to allocate new tree block, since there is no
    EXTENT/METADATA_ITEM for csum tree root, btrfs consider it's free slot
    and use it.
    
    The extent tree of the image looks like:
    
      Normal image                      |       This fuzzed image
      ----------------------------------+--------------------------------
      BG 29360128                       | BG 29360128
       One empty slot                   |  One empty slot
      29364224: backref to UUID tree    | 29364224: backref to UUID tree
       Two empty slots                  |  Two empty slots
      29376512: backref to CSUM tree    |  One empty slot (bad type) <<<
      29380608: backref to D_RELOC tree | 29380608: backref to D_RELOC tree
      ...                               | ...
    
    Since bytenr 29376512 has no METADATA/EXTENT_ITEM, when btrfs try to
    alloc tree block, it's an valid slot for btrfs.
    
    And for finish_ordered_write, when we need to insert csum, we try to CoW
    csum tree root.
    
    By accident, empty slots at bytenr BG_OFFSET, BG_OFFSET + 8K,
    BG_OFFSET + 12K is already used by tree block COW for other trees, the
    next empty slot is BG_OFFSET + 16K, which should be the backref for CSUM
    tree.
    
    But due to the bad type, btrfs can recognize it and still consider it as
    an empty slot, and will try to use it for csum tree CoW.
    
    Then in the following call trace, we will try to lock the new tree
    block, which turns out to be the old csum tree root which is already
    locked:
    
    btrfs_search_slot() called on csum tree root, which is at 29376512
    |- btrfs_cow_block()
       |- btrfs_set_lock_block()
       |  |- Now locks tree block 29376512 (old csum tree root)
       |- __btrfs_cow_block()
          |- btrfs_alloc_tree_block()
             |- btrfs_reserve_extent()
                | Now it returns tree block 29376512, which extent tree
                | shows its empty slot, but it's already hold by csum tree
                |- btrfs_init_new_buffer()
                   |- btrfs_tree_lock()
                      | Triggers WARN_ON(eb->lock_owner == current->pid)
                      |- wait_event()
                         Wait lock owner to release the lock, but it's
                         locked by ourself, so it will deadlock
    
    [FIX]
    This patch will do the lock_owner and current->pid check at
    btrfs_init_new_buffer().
    So above deadlock can be avoided.
    
    Since such problem can only happen in crafted image, we will still
    trigger kernel warning for later aborted transaction, but with a little
    more meaningful warning message.

    [CAUSE]
    Extent tree corruption.  In this particular case, reloc tree root's
    owner is DATA_RELOC_TREE (should be TREE_RELOC), thus its backref is
    corrupted and we failed the owner check in walk_up_tree().
    
    [FIX]
    It's pretty hard to take care of every extent tree corruption, but at
    least we can remove such BUG_ON() and exit more gracefully.
    
    And since in this particular image, DATA_RELOC_TREE and TREE_RELOC share
    the same root (which is obviously invalid), we needs to make
    __del_reloc_root() more robust to detect such invalid sharing to avoid
    possible NULL dereference as root->node can be NULL in this case.

    btrfs: qgroup: Avoid calling qgroup functions if qgroup is not enabled
    
    commit 3628b4ca64f24a4ec55055597d0cb1c814729f8b upstream.
    
    Some qgroup trace events like btrfs_qgroup_release_data() and
    btrfs_qgroup_free_delayed_ref() can still be triggered even if qgroup is
    not enabled.
    
    This is caused by the lack of qgroup status check before calling some
    qgroup functions.  Thankfully the functions can handle quota disabled
    case well and just do nothing for qgroup disabled case.
    
    This patch will do earlier check before triggering related trace events.
    
    And for enabled <-> disabled race case:
    
    1) For enabled->disabled case
       Disable will wipe out all qgroups data including reservation and
       excl/rfer. Even if we leak some reservation or numbers, it will
       still be cleared, so nothing will go wrong.
    
    2) For disabled -> enabled case
       Current btrfs_qgroup_release_data() will use extent_io tree to ensure
       we won't underflow reservation. And for delayed_ref we use
       head->qgroup_reserved to record the reserved space, so in that case
       head->qgroup_reserved should be 0 and we won't underflow.

    selftests/powerpc: Fix ptrace tm failure
    
    commit 48dc0ef19044bfb69193302fbe3a834e3331b7ae upstream.
    
    Test ptrace-tm-spd-gpr fails on current kernel (4.19) due to a segmentation
    fault that happens on the child process prior to setting cptr[2] = 1. This
    causes the parent process to wait forever at 'while (!pptr[2])' and the test to
    be killed by the test harness framework by timeout, thus, failing.
    
    The segmentation fault happens because of a inline assembly being
    generated as:
    
            0x10000355c <tm_spd_gpr+492>    lfs    f0, 0(0)
    
    This is reading memory position 0x0 and causing the segmentation fault.
    
    This code is being generated by ASM_LOAD_FPR_SINGLE_PRECISION(flt_4), where
    flt_4 is passed to the inline assembly block as:
    
            [flt_4] "r" (&d)
    
    Since the inline assembly 'r' constraint means any GPR, gpr0 is being
    chosen, thus causing this issue when issuing a Load Floating-Point Single
    instruction.
    
    This patch simply changes the constraint to 'b', which specify that this
    register will be used as base, and r0 is not allowed to be used, avoiding
    this issue.
    
    Other than that, removing flt_2 register from the input operands, since it
    is not used by the inline assembly code at all.

    selftests/ftrace: Fix synthetic event test to delete event correctly
    
    commit 0d0352d8b3d6d7ca9a710b40e194cbbaeb841c88 upstream.
    
    Fix the synthetic event test case to remove event correctly.
    If redirecting command to synthetic_event file without append
    mode, it cleans up all existing events and execute (parse) the
    command. This means "delete event" always fails to find the
    target event.
    
    Since previous synthetic event has a bug which doesn't return
    -ENOENT even if it fails to find the deleting event, this test
    passed. But fixing that bug, this test fails because this test
    itself has a bug.
    
    This fixes that bug by trying to delete event right after
    adding an event, and use append mode redirection ('>>') instead
    of normal redirection ('>').

    commit 1dc6bd5e39a29453bdcc17348dd2a89f1aa4004e upstream.
    
    Fix child-node lookup during probe, which ended up searching the whole
    device tree depth-first starting at the parent rather than just matching
    on its children.
    
    To make things worse, the parent pmc node could end up being prematurely
    freed as of_find_node_by_name() drops a reference to its first argument.

    drm/mediatek: fix OF sibling-node lookup
    
    commit ceff2f4dcd44abf35864d9a99f85ac619e89a01d upstream.
    
    Use the new of_get_compatible_child() helper to lookup the sibling
    instead of using of_find_compatible_node(), which searches the entire
    tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated (i.e.
    non-sibling) node.
    
    This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
    deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
    argument (i.e. the parent device node).
    
    While at it, also fix the related cec-node reference leak.

    media: adv7604: when the EDID is cleared, unconfigure CEC as well
    
    commit e7da89926f6dc6cf855f5ffdf79ef99a1b115ca7 upstream.
    
    When there is no EDID the CEC adapter should be unconfigured as
    well. So call cec_phys_addr_invalidate() when this happens.

    media: em28xx: fix handler for vidioc_s_input()
    
    commit 258c430456ba5f0005043762e14fc3be35983aaf upstream.
    
    The a->index is not the name of the internal amux entry,
    but, instead a value from zero to the maximum number
    of audio inputs.
    
    As the actual available inputs depend on each board, build
    it dynamically.
    
    This is broken for a really long time. On a quick check,
    since at least commit 195a4ef627e1 ("V4L/DVB (6585): Convert
    em28xx to video_ioctl2") this was not implemented right.

    media: em28xx: make v4l2-compliance happier by starting sequence on zero
    
    commit afeaade90db4c5dab93f326d9582be1d5954a198 upstream.
    
    The v4l2-compliance tool complains if a video doesn't start
    with a zero sequence number.
    
    While this shouldn't cause any real problem for apps, let's
    make it happier, in order to better check the v4l2-compliance
    differences before and after patchsets.
    
    This is actually an old issue. It is there since at least its
    videobuf2 conversion, e. g. changeset 3829fadc461 ("[media]
    em28xx: convert to videobuf2"), if VB1 wouldn't suffer from
    the same issue.

    media: tvp5150: avoid going past array on v4l2_querymenu()
    
    commit 5c4c4505b716cb782ad7263091edc466c4d1fbd4 upstream.
    
    The parameters of v4l2_ctrl_new_std_menu_items() are tricky: instead of
    the number of possible values, it requires the number of the maximum
    value. In other words, the ARRAY_SIZE() value should be decremented,
    otherwise it will go past the array bounds, as warned by KASAN:

    commit 490d84f6d73c12f4204241cff8651eed60aae914 upstream.
    
    If the wait for completion was interrupted, then make sure to cancel
    any delayed work.
    
    This can only happen if a transmit is waiting for a reply, and you press
    Ctrl-C or reboot/poweroff or something like that which interrupts the
    thread waiting for the reply and then proceeds to delete the CEC message.
    
    Since the delayed work wasn't canceled, once it would trigger it referred
    to stale data and resulted in a kernel oops.

    media: cec: fix the Signal Free Time calculation
    
    commit 7d867a1b765e2b70815fec4964d7822a976ed349 upstream.
    
    The calculation of the Signal Free Time in the framework was not
    correct. If a message was received, then the next transmit should be
    considered a New Initiator and use a shorter SFT value.
    
    This was not done with the result that if both sides where continually
    sending messages, they both could use the same SFT value and one side
    could deny the other side access to the bus.
    
    Note that this fix does not take the corner case into account where
    a receive is in progress when you call adap_transmit.

    media: cec: add new tx/rx status bits to detect aborts/timeouts
    
    commit 7ec2b3b941a666a942859684281b5f6460a0c234 upstream.
    
    If the HDMI cable is disconnected or the CEC adapter is manually
    unconfigured, then all pending transmits and wait-for-replies are
    aborted. Signal this with new status bits (CEC_RX/TX_STATUS_ABORTED).
    
    If due to (usually) a driver bug a transmit never ends (i.e. the
    transmit_done was never called by the driver), then when this times
    out the message is marked with CEC_TX_STATUS_TIMEOUT.
    
    This should not happen and is an indication of a driver bug.
    
    Without a separate status bit for this it was impossible to detect
    this from userspace.
    
    The 'transmit timed out' kernel message is now a warning, so this
    should be more prominent in the kernel log as well.

    xen: remove size limit of privcmd-buf mapping interface
    
    commit 3941552aec1e04d63999988a057ae09a1c56ebeb upstream.
    
    Currently the size of hypercall buffers allocated via
    /dev/xen/hypercall is limited to a default of 64 memory pages. For live
    migration of guests this might be too small as the page dirty bitmask
    needs to be sized according to the size of the guest. This means
    migrating a 8GB sized guest is already exhausting the default buffer
    size for the dirty bitmap.
    
    There is no sensible way to set a sane limit, so just remove it
    completely. The device node's usage is limited to root anyway, so there
    is no additional DOS scenario added by allowing unlimited buffers.
    
    While at it make the error path for the -ENOMEM case a little bit
    cleaner by setting n_pages to the number of successfully allocated
    pages instead of the target size.

    xen: fix xen_qlock_wait()
    
    commit d3132b3860f6cf35ff7609a76bbcdbb814bd027c upstream.
    
    Commit a856531951dc80 ("xen: make xen_qlock_wait() nestable")
    introduced a regression for Xen guests running fully virtualized
    (HVM or PVH mode). The Xen hypervisor wouldn't return from the poll
    hypercall with interrupts disabled in case of an interrupt (for PV
    guests it does).
    
    So instead of disabling interrupts in xen_qlock_wait() use a nesting
    counter to avoid calling xen_clear_irq_pending() in case
    xen_qlock_wait() is nested.

    media: cec: make cec_get_edid_spa_location() an inline function
    
    commit b915bf575d5b7774d0f22d57d6c143e07dcaade2 upstream.
    
    This function is needed by both V4L2 and CEC, so move this to
    cec.h as a static inline since there are no obvious shared
    modules between the two subsystems.
    
    This patch, together with the following ones, fixes a
    dependency bug: if CEC_CORE is disabled, then building adv7604
    (and other HDMI receivers) will fail because an essential

    commit d5269c4553a64b6882f2c019ae21b783a0984a83 upstream.
    
    In the case that the interrupts fail to result because of the
    interrupt-controller not yet being registered the
    platform_get_irq_byname() call will fail with -EPROBE_DEFER, but passing
    this into devm_request_threaded_irq() will result in -EINVAL being
    returned, the driver is therefor not reprobed later.

    kgdboc: Passing ekgdboc to command line causes panic
    
    commit 1bd54d851f50dea6af30c3e6ff4f3e9aab5558f9 upstream.
    
    kgdboc_option_setup does not check input argument before passing it
    to strlen. The argument would be a NULL pointer if "ekgdboc", without
    its value, is set in command line and thus cause the following panic.

    commit 9afc82194de9a1ce298f0d77d7d779d585bf962c upstream.
    
    As pointed at:
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199323
    
    This patch causes a bad effect on RPi. I suspect that the root
    cause is at the USB out of tree RPi driver, with uses high priority
    interrupts instead of normal ones. Anyway, as this patch
    is mostly a cleanup, better to revert it.

    The cause turned out to be a division of a negative number by an unsigned value.

    This is because the TURBOchannel bus driver fails to set the coherent
    DMA mask for devices enumerated.
    
    Set the regular and coherent DMA masks for TURBOchannel devices then,
    observing that the bus protocol supports a 34-bit (16GiB) DMA address
    space, by interpreting the value presented in the address cycle across
    the 32 `ad' lines as a 32-bit word rather than byte address[1].  The
    architectural size of the TURBOchannel DMA address space exceeds the
    maximum amount of RAM any actual TURBOchannel system in existence may
    have, hence both masks are the same.
    
    This removes the warning shown above.

    iommu/arm-smmu: Ensure that page-table updates are visible before TLBI
    
    commit 7d321bd3542500caf125249f44dc37cb4e738013 upstream.
    
    The IO-pgtable code relies on the driver TLB invalidation callbacks to
    ensure that all page-table updates are visible to the IOMMU page-table
    walker.
    
    In the case that the page-table walker is cache-coherent, we cannot rely
    on an implicit DSB from the DMA-mapping code, so we must ensure that we
    execute a DSB in our tlb_add_flush() callback prior to triggering the
    invalidation.

    ocxl: Fix access to the AFU Descriptor Data
    
    commit 6f8e45f7eb1bee5efdbe4a9cfe4a45627403c5fb upstream.
    
    The AFU Information DVSEC capability is a means to extract common,
    general information about all of the AFUs associated with a Function
    independent of the specific functionality that each AFU provides.
    Write in the AFU Index field allows to access to the descriptor data
    for each AFU.
    
    With the current code, we are not able to access to these specific data
    when the index >= 1 because we are writing to the wrong location.
    All requests to the data of each AFU are pointing to those of the AFU 0,
    which could have impacts when using a card with more than one AFU per
    function.
    
    This patch fixes the access to the AFU Descriptor Data indexed by the
    AFU Info Index field.

    rtc: cmos: Fix non-ACPI undefined reference to `hpet_rtc_interrupt'
    
    commit d197a253855d2d8e507a003880aab35c4e2473db upstream.
    
    Fix a commit 311ee9c151ad ("rtc: cmos: allow using ACPI for RTC alarm
    instead of HPET") `rtc-cmos' regression causing a link error:
    
    drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.o: In function `cmos_platform_probe':
    rtc-cmos.c:(.init.text+0x33c): undefined reference to `hpet_rtc_interrupt'
    rtc-cmos.c:(.init.text+0x3f4): undefined reference to `hpet_rtc_interrupt'
    
    with non-ACPI platforms using this driver.  The cause is the change of
    the condition guarding the use of `hpet_rtc_interrupt'.
    
    Previously it was a call to `is_hpet_enabled'.  That function is static
    inline and has a hardcoded 0 result for non-ACPI platforms, which imply
    !HPET_EMULATE_RTC.  Consequently the compiler optimized the whole block
    away including the reference to `hpet_rtc_interrupt', which never made
    it to the link stage.
    
    Now the guarding condition is a call to `use_hpet_alarm', which is not
    static inline and therefore the compiler may not be able to prove that
    it actually always returns 0 for non-ACPI platforms.  Consequently the
    build breaks with an unsatisfied reference, because `hpet_rtc_interrupt'
    is nowhere defined at link time.
    
    Fix the problem by marking `use_hpet_alarm' inline.  As the `inline'
    keyword serves as an optimization hint rather than a requirement the
    compiler is still free to choose whether inlining will be beneficial or
    not for ACPI platforms.

    PPC_INVALIDATE_ERAT is slbia IH=7 which is a new variant introduced
    with POWER9, and the result is undefined on earlier CPUs.
    
    Commits 7b9f71f974 ("powerpc/64s: POWER9 machine check handler") and
    d4748276ae ("powerpc/64s: Improve local TLB flush for boot and MCE on
    POWER9") caused POWER7/8 code to use this instruction. Remove it. An
    ERAT flush can be made by invalidatig the SLB, but before POWER9 that
    requires a flush and rebolt.

    powerpc/tm: Fix HFSCR bit for no suspend case
    
    commit dd9a8c5a87395b6f05552c3b44e42fdc95760552 upstream.
    
    Currently on P9N DD2.1 we end up taking infinite TM facility
    unavailable exceptions on the first TM usage by userspace.
    
    In the special case of TM no suspend (P9N DD2.1), Linux is told TM is
    off via CPU dt-ftrs but told to (partially) use it via
    OPAL_REINIT_CPUS_TM_SUSPEND_DISABLED. So HFSCR[TM] will be off from
    dt-ftrs but we need to turn it on for the no suspend case.
    
    This patch fixes this by enabling HFSCR TM in this case.

    fsnotify: Fix busy inodes during unmount
    
    commit 721fb6fbfd2132164c2e8777cc837f9b2c1794dc upstream.
    
    Detaching of mark connector from fsnotify_put_mark() can race with
    unmounting of the filesystem like:
    
      CPU1                          CPU2
    fsnotify_put_mark()
      spin_lock(&conn->lock);
      ...
      inode = fsnotify_detach_connector_from_object(conn)
      spin_unlock(&conn->lock);
                                    generic_shutdown_super()
                                      fsnotify_unmount_inodes()
                                        sees connector detached for inode
                                          -> nothing to do
                                      evict_inode()
                                        barfs on pending inode reference
      iput(inode);
    
    Resulting in "Busy inodes after unmount" message and possible kernel
    oops. Make fsnotify_unmount_inodes() properly wait for outstanding inode
    references from detached connectors.
    
    Note that the accounting of outstanding inode references in the
    superblock can cause some cacheline contention on the counter. OTOH it
    happens only during deletion of the last notification mark from an inode
    (or during unlinking of watched inode) and that is not too bad. I have
    measured time to create & delete inotify watch 100000 times from 64
    processes in parallel (each process having its own inotify group and its
    own file on a shared superblock) on a 64 CPU machine. Average and
    standard deviation of 15 runs look like:
    
            Avg             Stddev
    Vanilla 9.817400        0.276165
    Fixed   9.710467        0.228294
    
    So there's no statistically significant difference.

    dm zoned: fix various dmz_get_mblock() issues
    
    commit 3d4e738311327bc4ba1d55fbe2f1da3de4a475f9 upstream.
    
    dmz_fetch_mblock() called from dmz_get_mblock() has a race since the
    allocation of the new metadata block descriptor and its insertion in
    the cache rbtree with the READING state is not atomic. Two different
    contexts requesting the same block may end up each adding two different
    descriptors of the same block to the cache.
    
    Another problem for this function is that the BIO for processing the
    block read is allocated after the metadata block descriptor is inserted
    in the cache rbtree. If the BIO allocation fails, the metadata block
    descriptor is freed without first being removed from the rbtree.
    
    Fix the first problem by checking again if the requested block is not in
    the cache right before inserting the newly allocated descriptor,
    atomically under the mblk_lock spinlock. The second problem is fixed by
    simply allocating the BIO before inserting the new block in the cache.
    
    Finally, since dmz_fetch_mblock() also increments a block reference
    counter, rename the function to dmz_get_mblock_slow(). To be symmetric
    and clear, also rename dmz_lookup_mblock() to dmz_get_mblock_fast() and
    increment the block reference counter directly in that function rather
    than in dmz_get_mblock().

    dm ioctl: harden copy_params()'s copy_from_user() from malicious users
    
    commit 800a7340ab7dd667edf95e74d8e4f23a17e87076 upstream.
    
    In copy_params(), the struct 'dm_ioctl' is first copied from the user
    space buffer 'user' to 'param_kernel' and the field 'data_size' is
    checked against 'minimum_data_size' (size of 'struct dm_ioctl' payload
    up to its 'data' member).  If the check fails, an error code EINVAL will be
    returned.  Otherwise, param_kernel->data_size is used to do a second copy,
    which copies from the same user-space buffer to 'dmi'.  After the second
    copy, only 'dmi->data_size' is checked against 'param_kernel->data_size'.
    Given that the buffer 'user' resides in the user space, a malicious
    user-space process can race to change the content in the buffer between
    the two copies.  This way, the attacker can inject inconsistent data
    into 'dmi' (versus previously validated 'param_kernel').
    
    Fix redundant copying of 'minimum_data_size' from user-space buffer by
    using the first copy stored in 'param_kernel'.  Also remove the
    'data_size' check after the second copy because it is now unnecessary.

    NFSv4.1: Fix the r/wsize checking
    
    commit 943cff67b842839f4f35364ba2db5c2d3f025d94 upstream.
    
    The intention of nfs4_session_set_rwsize() was to cap the r/wsize to the
    buffer sizes negotiated by the CREATE_SESSION. The initial code had a
    bug whereby we would not check the values negotiated by nfs_probe_fsinfo()
    (the assumption being that CREATE_SESSION will always negotiate buffer values
    that are sane w.r.t. the server's preferred r/wsizes) but would only check
    values set by the user in the 'mount' command.
    
    The code was changed in 4.11 to _always_ set the r/wsize, meaning that we
    now never use the server preferred r/wsizes. This is the regression that
    this patch fixes.
    Also rename the function to nfs4_session_limit_rwsize() in order to avoid
    future confusion.

    Use the new of_get_compatible_child() helper to lookup the nfc child
    node instead of using of_find_compatible_node(), which searches the
    entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated
    (i.e. non-child) node.
    
    This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe

    genirq: Fix race on spurious interrupt detection
    
    commit 746a923b863a1065ef77324e1e43f19b1a3eab5c upstream.
    
    Commit 1e77d0a1ed74 ("genirq: Sanitize spurious interrupt detection of
    threaded irqs") made detection of spurious interrupts work for threaded
    handlers by:
    
    a) incrementing a counter every time the thread returns IRQ_HANDLED, and
    b) checking whether that counter has increased every time the thread is
       woken.
    
    However for oneshot interrupts, the commit unmasks the interrupt before
    incrementing the counter.  If another interrupt occurs right after
    unmasking but before the counter is incremented, that interrupt is
    incorrectly considered spurious:
    
    time
     |  irq_thread()
     |    irq_thread_fn()
     |      action->thread_fn()
     |      irq_finalize_oneshot()
     |        unmask_threaded_irq()            /* interrupt is unmasked */
     |
     |                  /* interrupt fires, incorrectly deemed spurious */
     |
     |    atomic_inc(&desc->threads_handled); /* counter is incremented */
     v
    
    This is observed with a hi3110 CAN controller receiving data at high volume
    (from a separate machine sending with "cangen -g 0 -i -x"): The controller
    signals a huge number of interrupts (hundreds of millions per day) and
    every second there are about a dozen which are deemed spurious.
    
    In theory with high CPU load and the presence of higher priority tasks, the
    number of incorrectly detected spurious interrupts might increase beyond
    the 99,900 threshold and cause disablement of the interrupt.
    
    In practice it just increments the spurious interrupt count. But that can
    cause people to waste time investigating it over and over.
    
    Fix it by moving the accounting before the invocation of
    irq_finalize_oneshot().

    printk: Fix panic caused by passing log_buf_len to command line
    
    commit 277fcdb2cfee38ccdbe07e705dbd4896ba0c9930 upstream.
    
    log_buf_len_setup does not check input argument before passing it to
    simple_strtoull. The argument would be a NULL pointer if "log_buf_len",
    without its value, is set in command line and thus causes the following
    panic.

    smb3: on kerberos mount if server doesn't specify auth type use krb5
    
    commit 926674de6705f0f1dbf29a62fd758d0977f535d6 upstream.
    
    Some servers (e.g. Azure) do not include a spnego blob in the SMB3
    negotiate protocol response, so on kerberos mounts ("sec=krb5")
    we can fail, as we expected the server to list its supported
    auth types (OIDs in the spnego blob in the negprot response).
    Change this so that on krb5 mounts we default to trying krb5 if the
    server doesn't list its supported protocol mechanisms.

    commit 1e77a8c204c9d1b655c61751b8ad0fde22421dbb upstream.
    
    If backupuid mount option is sent, we can incorrectly retry
    (on access denied on query info) with a cifs (FindFirst) operation
    on an smb3 mount which causes the server to force the session close.
    
    We set backup intent on open so no need for this fallback.

    iio: adc: at91: fix wrong channel number in triggered buffer mode
    
    commit aea835f2dc8a682942b859179c49ad1841a6c8b9 upstream.
    
    When channels are registered, the hardware channel number is not the
    actual iio channel number.
    This is because the driver is probed with a certain number of accessible
    channels. Some pins are routed and some not, depending on the description of
    the board in the DT.
    Because of that, channels 0,1,2,3 can correspond to hardware channels
    2,3,4,5 for example.
    In the buffered triggered case, we need to do the translation accordingly.
    Fixed the channel number to stop reading the wrong channel.

    iio: adc: at91: fix acking DRDY irq on simple conversions
    
    commit bc1b45326223e7e890053cf6266357adfa61942d upstream.
    
    When doing simple conversions, the driver did not acknowledge the DRDY irq.
    If this irq status is not acked, it will be left pending, and as soon as a
    trigger is enabled, the irq handler will be called, it doesn't know why
    this status has occurred because no channel is pending, and then it will go
    int a irq loop and board will hang.
    To avoid this situation, read the LCDR after a raw conversion is done.

    iio: ad5064: Fix regulator handling
    
    commit 8911a43bc198877fad9f4b0246a866b26bb547ab upstream.
    
    The correct way to handle errors returned by regualtor_get() and friends is
    to propagate the error since that means that an regulator was specified,
    but something went wrong when requesting it.
    
    For handling optional regulators, e.g. when the device has an internal
    vref, regulator_get_optional() should be used to avoid getting the dummy
    regulator that the regulator core otherwise provides.

    kbuild: fix kernel/bounds.c 'W=1' warning
    
    commit 6a32c2469c3fbfee8f25bcd20af647326650a6cf upstream.
    
    Building any configuration with 'make W=1' produces a warning:
    
    kernel/bounds.c:16:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'foo' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
    
    When also passing -Werror, this prevents us from building any other files.
    Nobody ever calls the function, but we can't make it 'static' either
    since we want the compiler output.
    
    Calling it 'main' instead however avoids the warning, because gcc
    does not insist on having a declaration for main.

    KVM: arm64: Fix caching of host MDCR_EL2 value
    
    commit da5a3ce66b8bb51b0ea8a89f42aac153903f90fb upstream.
    
    At boot time, KVM stashes the host MDCR_EL2 value, but only does this
    when the kernel is not running in hyp mode (i.e. is non-VHE). In these
    cases, the stashed value of MDCR_EL2.HPMN happens to be zero, which can
    lead to CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behaviour.
    
    Since we use this value to derive the MDCR_EL2 value when switching
    to/from a guest, after a guest have been run, the performance counters
    do not behave as expected. This has been observed to result in accesses
    via PMXEVTYPER_EL0 and PMXEVCNTR_EL0 not affecting the relevant
    counters, resulting in events not being counted. In these cases, only
    the fixed-purpose cycle counter appears to work as expected.
    
    Fix this by always stashing the host MDCR_EL2 value, regardless of VHE.

    commit fd2ef358282c849c193aa36dadbf4f07f7dcd29b upstream.
    
    PageTransCompoundMap() returns true for hugetlbfs and THP
    hugepages. This behaviour incorrectly leads to stage 2 faults for
    unsupported hugepage sizes (e.g., 64K hugepage with 4K pages) to be
    treated as THP faults.
    
    Tighten the check to filter out hugetlbfs pages. This also leads to
    consistently mapping all unsupported hugepage sizes as PTE level
    entries at stage 2.

    commit 86a2d59841ab0b147ffc1b7b3041af87927cf312 upstream.
    
    In hmm_mirror_unregister(), mm->hmm is set to NULL and then
    mmu_notifier_unregister_no_release() is called.  That creates a small
    window where mmu_notifier can call mmu_notifier_ops with mm->hmm equal to
    NULL.  Fix this by first unregistering mmu notifier callbacks and then
    setting mm->hmm to NULL.
    
    Similarly in hmm_register(), set mm->hmm before registering mmu_notifier
    callbacks so callback functions always see mm->hmm set.

    mm/rmap: map_pte() was not handling private ZONE_DEVICE page properly
    
    commit aab8d0520e6e7c2a61f71195e6ce7007a4843afb upstream.
    
    Private ZONE_DEVICE pages use a special pte entry and thus are not
    present.  Properly handle this case in map_pte(), it is already handled in
    check_pte(), the map_pte() part was lost in some rebase most probably.
    
    Without this patch the slow migration path can not migrate back to any
    private ZONE_DEVICE memory to regular memory.  This was found after stress
    testing migration back to system memory.  This ultimatly can lead to the
    CPU constantly page fault looping on the special swap entry.

    hugetlbfs: dirty pages as they are added to pagecache
    
    commit 22146c3ce98962436e401f7b7016a6f664c9ffb5 upstream.
    
    Some test systems were experiencing negative huge page reserve counts and
    incorrect file block counts.  This was traced to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    removing clean pages from hugetlbfs file pagecaches.  When non-hugetlbfs
    explicit code removes the pages, the appropriate accounting is not
    performed.
    
    This can be recreated as follows:
     fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
     echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
     fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
     grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
       AnonHugePages:         0 kB
       ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
       HugePages_Total:    2048
       HugePages_Free:     2047
       HugePages_Rsvd:    18446744073709551615
       HugePages_Surp:        0
       Hugepagesize:       2048 kB
       Hugetlb:         4194304 kB
     ls -lsh /dev/hugepages/foo
       4.0M -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2.0M Oct 17 20:05 /dev/hugepages/foo
    
    To address this issue, dirty pages as they are added to pagecache.  This
    can easily be reproduced with fallocate as shown above.  Read faulted
    pages will eventually end up being marked dirty.  But there is a window
    where they are clean and could be impacted by code such as drop_caches.
    So, just dirty them all as they are added to the pagecache.

    ima: open a new file instance if no read permissions
    
    commit a408e4a86b36bf98ad15b9ada531cf0e5118ac67 upstream.
    
    Open a new file instance as opposed to changing file->f_mode when
    the file is not readable.  This is done to accomodate overlayfs
    stacked file operations change.  The real struct file is hidden
    behind the overlays struct file.  So, any file->f_mode manipulations are
    not reflected on the real struct file.  Open the file again in read mode
    if original file cannot be read, read and calculate the hash.

    userfaultfd: disable irqs when taking the waitqueue lock
    
    commit ae62c16e105a869524afcf8a07ee85c5ae5d0479 upstream.
    
    userfaultfd contains howe-grown locking of the waitqueue lock, and does
    not disable interrupts.  This relies on the fact that no one else takes it
    from interrupt context and violates an invariat of the normal waitqueue
    locking scheme.  With aio poll it is easy to trigger other locks that
    disable interrupts (or are called from interrupt context).

    Here, vma->vm_file is NULL.  mss->check_shmem_swap should be false in that
    case, however for smaps_rollup, smap_gather_stats() can set the flag true
    for one vma and leave it true for subsequent vma's where it should be
    false.
    
    To fix, reset the check_shmem_swap flag to false.  There's also related
    bug which sets mss->swap to shmem_swapped, which in the context of
    smaps_rollup overwrites any value accumulated from previous vma's.  Fix
    that as well.
    
    Note that the report suggests a regression between 4.17.19 and 4.19-rc7,
    which makes the 4.19 series ending with commit 258f669e7e88 ("mm:
    /proc/pid/smaps_rollup: convert to single value seq_file") suspicious.
    But the mss was reused for rollup since 493b0e9d945f ("mm: add
    /proc/pid/smaps_rollup") so let's play it safe with the stable backport.

    These are unused, undesired, and have never actually been used by

    that could really get going. Therefore, this patch removes Speck.

    crypto: aesni - don't use GFP_ATOMIC allocation if the request doesn't cross a page in gcm
    
    commit a788848116454d753b13a4888e0e31ada3c4d393 upstream.
    
    This patch fixes gcmaes_crypt_by_sg so that it won't use memory
    allocation if the data doesn't cross a page boundary.
    
    Authenticated encryption may be used by dm-crypt. If the encryption or
    decryption fails, it would result in I/O error and filesystem corruption.
    The function gcmaes_crypt_by_sg is using GFP_ATOMIC allocation that can
    fail anytime. This patch fixes the logic so that it won't attempt the
    failing allocation if the data doesn't cross a page boundary.

    crypto: lrw - Fix out-of bounds access on counter overflow
    
    commit fbe1a850b3b1522e9fc22319ccbbcd2ab05328d2 upstream.
    
    When the LRW block counter overflows, the current implementation returns
    128 as the index to the precomputed multiplication table, which has 128
    entries. This patch fixes it to return the correct value (127).

    signal: Guard against negative signal numbers in copy_siginfo_from_user32
    
    commit a36700589b85443e28170be59fa11c8a104130a5 upstream.
    
    While fixing an out of bounds array access in known_siginfo_layout
    reported by the kernel test robot it became apparent that the same bug
    exists in siginfo_layout and affects copy_siginfo_from_user32.
    
    The straight forward fix that makes guards against making this mistake
    in the future and should keep the code size small is to just take an
    unsigned signal number instead of a signed signal number, as I did to
    fix known_siginfo_layout.

    signal/GenWQE: Fix sending of SIGKILL
    
    commit 0ab93e9c99f8208c0a1a7b7170c827936268c996 upstream.
    
    The genweq_add_file and genwqe_del_file by caching current without
    using reference counting embed the assumption that a file descriptor
    will never be passed from one process to another.  It even embeds the
    assumption that the the thread that opened the file will be in
    existence when the process terminates.   Neither of which are
    guaranteed to be true.
    
    Therefore replace caching the task_struct of the opener with
    pid of the openers thread group id.  All the knowledge of the
    opener is used for is as the target of SIGKILL and a SIGKILL
    will kill the entire process group.
    
    Rename genwqe_force_sig to genwqe_terminate, remove it's unncessary
    signal argument, update it's ownly caller, and use kill_pid
    instead of force_sig.
    
    The work force_sig does in changing signal handling state is not
    relevant to SIGKILL sent as SEND_SIG_PRIV.  The exact same processess
    will be killed just with less work, and less confusion.  The work done
    by force_sig is really only needed for handling syncrhonous
    exceptions.
    
    It will still be possible to cause genwqe_device_remove to wait
    8 seconds by passing a file descriptor to another process but
    the possible user after free is fixed.

    PCI: Add Device IDs for Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk
    
    commit d0c9606b31a21028fb5b753c8ad79626292accfd upstream.
    
    Add Device IDs to the Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk table.
    
    For these devices, unplugging the VGA cable and plugging it in again causes
    spurious interrupts from the IGD.  Linux eventually disables the interrupt,
    but of course that disables any other devices sharing the interrupt.
    
    The theory is that this is a VGA BIOS defect: it should have disabled the
    IGD interrupt but failed to do so.
    
    See f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel
    Sandy Bridge GPUs") and 7c82126a94e6 ("PCI: Add new ID for Intel GPU
    "spurious interrupt" quirk") for some history.
    
    [bhelgaas: See link below for discussion about how to fix this more
    generically instead of adding device IDs for every new Intel GPU.  I hope
    this is the last patch to add device IDs.]

    PCI/ASPM: Fix link_state teardown on device removal
    
    commit aeae4f3e5c38d47bdaef50446dc0ec857307df68 upstream.
    
    Upon removal of the last device on a bus, the link_state of the bridge
    leading to that bus is sought to be torn down by having pci_stop_dev()
    call pcie_aspm_exit_link_state().
    
    When ASPM was originally introduced by commit 7d715a6c1ae5 ("PCI: add
    PCI Express ASPM support"), it determined whether the device being
    removed is the last one by calling list_empty() on the bridge's
    subordinate devices list.  That didn't work because the device is only
    removed from the list slightly later in pci_destroy_dev().
    
    Commit 3419c75e15f8 ("PCI: properly clean up ASPM link state on device
    remove") attempted to fix it by calling list_is_last(), but that's not
    correct either because it checks whether the device is at the *end* of
    the list, not whether it's the last one *left* in the list.  If the user
    removes the device which happens to be at the end of the list via sysfs
    but other devices are preceding the device in the list, the link_state
    is torn down prematurely.
    
    The real fix is to move the invocation of pcie_aspm_exit_link_state() to
    pci_destroy_dev() and reinstate the call to list_empty().  Remove a
    duplicate check for dev->bus->self because pcie_aspm_exit_link_state()
    already contains an identical check.

    EDAC, {i7core,sb,skx}_edac: Fix uncorrected error counting
    
    commit 432de7fd7630c84ad24f1c2acd1e3bb4ce3741ca upstream.
    
    The count of errors is picked up from bits 52:38 of the machine check
    bank status register. But this is the count of *corrected* errors. If an
    uncorrected error is being logged, the h/w sets this field to 0. Which
    means that when edac_mc_handle_error() is called, the EDAC core will
    carefully add zero to the appropriate uncorrected error counts.

    HID: hiddev: fix potential Spectre v1
    
    commit f11274396a538b31bc010f782e05c2ce3f804c13 upstream.
    
    uref->usage_index can be indirectly controlled by userspace, hence leading
    to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
    
    This field is used as an array index by the hiddev_ioctl_usage() function,
    when 'cmd' is either HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX, HIDIOCGUSAGES or
    HIDIOCSUSAGES.
    
    For cmd == HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, uref->usage_index is compared to
    field->maxusage and then used as an index to dereference field->usage
    array. The same thing happens to the cmd == HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES cases, where
    uref->usage_index is checked against an array maximum value and then it is
    used as an index in an array.
    
    This is a summary of the HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, which matches the
    traditional Spectre V1 first load:
    
            copy_from_user(uref, user_arg, sizeof(*uref))
            if (uref->usage_index >= field->maxusage)
                    goto inval;
            i = field->usage[uref->usage_index].collection_index;
            return i;
    
    This patch fixes this by sanitizing field uref->usage_index before using it
    to index field->usage (HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX) or field->value in
    HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES arrays, thus, avoiding speculation in the first load.

    HID: wacom: Work around HID descriptor bug in DTK-2451 and DTH-2452
    
    commit 11db8173dbab7a94cf5ba5225fcedbfc0f3b7e54 upstream.
    
    The DTK-2451 and DTH-2452 have a buggy HID descriptor which incorrectly
    contains a Cintiq-like report, complete with pen tilt, rotation, twist, serial
    number, etc. The hardware doesn't actually support this data but our driver
    duitifully sets up the device as though it does. To ensure userspace has a
    correct view of devices without updated firmware, we clean up this incorrect
    data in wacom_setup_device_quirks.
    
    We're also careful to clear the WACOM_QUIRK_TOOLSERIAL flag since its presence
    causes the driver to wait for serial number information (via
    wacom_wac_pen_serial_enforce) that never comes, resulting in
    the pen being non-responsive.

    selinux: fix mounting of cgroup2 under older policies
    
    commit 7bb185edb0306bb90029a5fa6b9cff900ffdbf4b upstream.
    
    commit 901ef845fa2469c ("selinux: allow per-file labeling for cgroupfs")
    broke mounting of cgroup2 under older SELinux policies which lacked
    a genfscon rule for cgroup2.  This prevents mounting of cgroup2 even
    when SELinux is permissive.
    
    Change the handling when there is no genfscon rule in policy to
    just mark the inode unlabeled and not return an error to the caller.
    This permits mounting and access if allowed by policy, e.g. to
    unconfined domains.
    
    I also considered changing the behavior of security_genfs_sid() to
    never return -ENOENT, but the current behavior is relied upon by
    other callers to perform caller-specific handling.

    ext4: fix setattr project check in fssetxattr ioctl
    
    commit dc7ac6c4cae3b58724c2f1e21a7c05ce19ecd5a8 upstream.
    
    Currently, project quota could be changed by fssetxattr
    ioctl, and existed permission check inode_owner_or_capable()
    is obviously not enough, just think that common users could
    change project id of file, that could make users to
    break project quota easily.
    
    This patch try to follow same regular of xfs project
    quota:
    
    "Project Quota ID state is only allowed to change from
    within the init namespace. Enforce that restriction only
    if we are trying to change the quota ID state.
    Everything else is allowed in user namespaces."
    
    Besides that, check and set project id'state should
    be an atomic operation, protect whole operation with
    inode lock, ext4_ioctl_setproject() is only used for
    ioctl EXT4_IOC_FSSETXATTR, we have held mnt_want_write_file()
    before ext4_ioctl_setflags(), and ext4_ioctl_setproject()
    is called after ext4_ioctl_setflags(), we could share
    codes, so remove it inside ext4_ioctl_setproject().

    ext4: initialize retries variable in ext4_da_write_inline_data_begin()
    
    commit 625ef8a3acd111d5f496d190baf99d1a815bd03e upstream.
    
    Variable retries is not initialized in ext4_da_write_inline_data_begin()
    which can lead to nondeterministic number of retries in case we hit
    ENOSPC. Initialize retries to zero as we do everywhere else.

    ext4: fix EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT
    
    commit 18aded17492088962ef43f00825179598b3e8c58 upstream.
    
    The code EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT ioctl hasn't been updated in a while, and
    it's a bit broken with respect to more modern ext4 kernels, especially
    metadata checksums.
    
    Other problems fixed with this commit:
    
    * Don't allow installing a DAX, swap file, or an encrypted file as a
      boot loader.
    
    * Respect the immutable and append-only flags.
    
    * Wait until any DIO operations are finished *before* calling
      truncate_inode_pages().
    
    * Don't swap inode->i_flags, since these flags have nothing to do with
      the inode blocks --- and it will give the IMA/audit code heartburn
      when the inode is evicted.

    jbd2: fix use after free in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()
    
    commit ccd3c4373eacb044eb3832966299d13d2631f66f upstream.
    
    The code cleaning transaction's lists of checkpoint buffers has a bug
    where it increases bh refcount only after releasing
    journal->j_list_lock. Thus the following race is possible:
    
    CPU0                                    CPU1
    jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()
                                            jbd2_journal_try_to_free_buffers()
                                              __journal_try_to_free_buffer(bh)
      ...
      while (transaction->t_checkpoint_io_list)
      ...
        if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
    
    <-- IO completes now, buffer gets unlocked -->
    
          spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                                                spin_lock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                                                __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint(jh);
                                                spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                                              try_to_free_buffers(page);
          get_bh(bh) <-- accesses freed bh
    
    Fix the problem by grabbing bh reference before unlocking
    journal->j_list_lock.

    IB/rxe: Revise the ib_wr_opcode enum
    
    commit 9a59739bd01f77db6fbe2955a4fce165f0f43568 upstream.
    
    This enum has become part of the uABI, as both RXE and the
    ib_uverbs_post_send() command expect userspace to supply values from this
    enum. So it should be properly placed in include/uapi/rdma.
    
    In userspace this enum is called 'enum ibv_wr_opcode' as part of
    libibverbs.h. That enum defines different values for IB_WR_LOCAL_INV,
    IB_WR_SEND_WITH_INV, and IB_WR_LSO. These were introduced (incorrectly, it
    turns out) into libiberbs in 2015.
    
    The kernel has changed its mind on the numbering for several of the IB_WC
    values over the years, but has remained stable on IB_WR_LOCAL_INV and
    below.
    
    Based on this we can conclude that there is no real user space user of the
    values beyond IB_WR_ATOMIC_FETCH_AND_ADD, as they have never worked via
    rdma-core. This is confirmed by inspection, only rxe uses the kernel enum
    and implements the latter operations. rxe has clearly never worked with
    these attributes from userspace. Other drivers that support these opcodes
    implement the functionality without calling out to the kernel.
    
    To make IB_WR_SEND_WITH_INV and related work for RXE in userspace we
    choose to renumber the IB_WR enum in the kernel to match the uABI that
    userspace has bee using since before Soft RoCE was merged. This is an
    overall simpler configuration for the whole software stack, and obviously
    can't break anything existing.

    scsi: target: Fix target_wait_for_sess_cmds breakage with active signals
    
    commit 38fe73cc2c96fbc9942b07220f2a4f1bab37392d upstream.
    
    With the addition of commit 00d909a10710 ("scsi: target: Make the session
    shutdown code also wait for commands that are being aborted") in v4.19-rc, it
    incorrectly assumes no signals will be pending for task_struct executing the
    normal session shutdown and I/O quiesce code-path.
    
    For example, iscsi-target and iser-target issue SIGINT to all kthreads as part
    of session shutdown.  This has been the behaviour since day one.
    
    As-is when signals are pending with se_cmds active in se_sess->sess_cmd_list,
    wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout() returns a negative number and
    immediately kills the machine because of the do while (ret <= 0) loop that was
    added in commit 00d909a107 to spin while backend I/O is taking any amount of
    extended time (say 30 seconds) to complete.
    
    Here's what it looks like in action with debug plus delayed backend I/O
    completion:
    
    [ 4951.909951] se_sess: 000000003e7e08fa before target_wait_for_sess_cmds
    [ 4951.914600] target_wait_for_sess_cmds: signal_pending: 1
    [ 4951.918015] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 0
    [ 4951.921639] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 1
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 2
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 3
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 4
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 5
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 6
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 7
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 8
    [ 4951.921944] wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout ret: -512 signal_pending: 1 loop count: 9
    
    ... followed by the usual RCU CPU stalls and deadlock.
    
    There was never a case pre commit 00d909a107 where
    wait_for_complete(&se_cmd->cmd_wait_comp) was able to be interrupted, so to
    address this for v4.19+ moving forward go ahead and use
    wait_event_lock_irq_timeout() instead so new code works with all fabric
    drivers.
    
    Also for commit 00d909a107, fix a minor regression in
    target_release_cmd_kref() to only wake_up the new se_sess->cmd_list_wq only
    when shutdown has actually been triggered via se_sess->sess_tearing_down.

    scsi: sched/wait: Add wait_event_lock_irq_timeout for TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE usage
    
    commit 25ab0bc334b43bbbe4eabc255006ce42a9424da2 upstream.
    
    Short of reverting commit 00d909a10710 ("scsi: target: Make the session
    shutdown code also wait for commands that are being aborted") for v4.19,
    target-core needs a wait_event_t macro can be executed using
    TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to function correctly with existing fabric drivers that
    expect to run with signals pending during session shutdown and active se_cmd
    I/O quiesce.
    
    The most notable is iscsi-target/iser-target, while ibmvscsi_tgt invokes
    session shutdown logic from userspace via configfs attribute that could also
    potentially have signals pending.
    
    So go ahead and introduce wait_event_lock_irq_timeout() to achieve this, and
    update + rename __wait_event_lock_irq_timeout() to make it accept 'state' as a
    parameter.

    net/ipv4: defensive cipso option parsing
    
    commit 076ed3da0c9b2f88d9157dbe7044a45641ae369e upstream.
    
    commit 40413955ee26 ("Cipso: cipso_v4_optptr enter infinite loop") fixed
    a possible infinite loop in the IP option parsing of CIPSO. The fix
    assumes that ip_options_compile filtered out all zero length options and
    that no other one-byte options beside IPOPT_END and IPOPT_NOOP exist.
    While this assumption currently holds true, add explicit checks for zero
    length and invalid length options to be safe for the future. Even though
    ip_options_compile should have validated the options, the introduction of
    new one-byte options can still confuse this code without the additional
    checks.

    iwlwifi: mvm: check return value of rs_rate_from_ucode_rate()
    
    commit 3d71c3f1f50cf309bd20659422af549bc784bfff upstream.
    
    The rs_rate_from_ucode_rate() function may return -EINVAL if the rate
    is invalid, but none of the callsites check for the error, potentially
    making us access arrays with index IWL_RATE_INVALID, which is larger
    than the arrays, causing an out-of-bounds access.  This will trigger
    KASAN warnings, such as the one reported in the bugzilla issue
    mentioned below.

    mt76: mt76x2: fix multi-interface beacon configuration
    
    commit 5289976ad887deb07c76df7eecf553c264aeebed upstream.
    
    If the first virtual interface is a station (or an AP with beacons
    temporarily disabled), the beacon of the second interface needs to
    occupy hardware beacon slot 0.
    For some reason the beacon index was incorrectly masked with the
    virtual interface beacon mask, which prevents the secondary
    interface from sending beacons unless the first one also does.

    usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: Fix b-device mode for "workaround"
    
    commit afc92514a34c7414b28047b1205a6b709103c699 upstream.
    
    If the "workaround_for_vbus" is true, the driver will not call
    usb_disconnect(). So, since the controller keeps some registers'
    value, the driver doesn't re-enumarate suitable speed after
    the b-device mode is disabled. To fix the issue, this patch
    adds usb_disconnect() calling in renesas_usb3_b_device_write()
    if workaround_for_vbus is true.

    usb: typec: tcpm: Fix APDO PPS order checking to be based on voltage
    
    commit 1b6af2f58c2b1522e0804b150ca95e50a9e80ea7 upstream.
    
    Current code mistakenly checks against max current to determine
    order but this should be max voltage. This commit fixes the issue
    so order is correctly determined, thus avoiding failure based on
    a higher voltage PPS APDO having a lower maximum current output,
    which is actually valid.

    commit e6111161c0a02d58919d776eec94b313bb57911f upstream.
    
    A Xen PVH guest has no associated qemu device model, so trying to
    unplug any emulated devices is making no sense at all.
    
    Bail out early from xen_unplug_emulated_devices() when running as PVH
    guest. This will avoid issuing the boot message:

    While booting on an AMD EPYC box the stack canary would detect stack
    overflows when using the current PVH early stack size (256). Switch to
    using the value defined by BOOT_STACK_SIZE, which prevents the stack

    xen: make xen_qlock_wait() nestable
    
    commit a856531951dc8094359dfdac21d59cee5969c18e upstream.
    
    xen_qlock_wait() isn't safe for nested calls due to interrupts. A call
    of xen_qlock_kick() might be ignored in case a deeper nesting level
    was active right before the call of xen_poll_irq():
    
    CPU 1:                                   CPU 2:
    spin_lock(lock1)
                                             spin_lock(lock1)
                                             -> xen_qlock_wait()
                                                -> xen_clear_irq_pending()
                                                Interrupt happens
    spin_unlock(lock1)
    -> xen_qlock_kick(CPU 2)
    spin_lock_irqsave(lock2)
                                             spin_lock_irqsave(lock2)
                                             -> xen_qlock_wait()
                                                -> xen_clear_irq_pending()
                                                   clears kick for lock1
                                                -> xen_poll_irq()
    spin_unlock_irq_restore(lock2)
    -> xen_qlock_kick(CPU 2)
                                                wakes up
                                             spin_unlock_irq_restore(lock2)
                                             IRET
                                               resumes in xen_qlock_wait()
                                               -> xen_poll_irq()
                                               never wakes up
    
    The solution is to disable interrupts in xen_qlock_wait() and not to
    poll for the irq in case xen_qlock_wait() is called in nmi context.

    xen: fix race in xen_qlock_wait()
    
    commit 2ac2a7d4d9ff4e01e36f9c3d116582f6f655ab47 upstream.
    
    In the following situation a vcpu waiting for a lock might not be
    woken up from xen_poll_irq():
    
    CPU 1:                CPU 2:                      CPU 3:
    takes a spinlock
                          tries to get lock
                          -> xen_qlock_wait()
    frees the lock
    -> xen_qlock_kick(cpu2)
                            -> xen_clear_irq_pending()
    
    takes lock again
                                                      tries to get lock
                                                      -> *lock = _Q_SLOW_VAL
                            -> *lock == _Q_SLOW_VAL ?
                            -> xen_poll_irq()
    frees the lock
    -> xen_qlock_kick(cpu3)
    
    And cpu 2 will sleep forever.
    
    This can be avoided easily by modifying xen_qlock_wait() to call
    xen_poll_irq() only if the related irq was not pending and to call
    xen_clear_irq_pending() only if it was pending.

    and the failing path in talk_to_blkback sets the driver_data to NULL:
    
     destroy_blkring:
            blkif_free(info, 0);
    
            mutex_lock(&blkfront_mutex);

            mutex_unlock(&blkfront_mutex);
    
            dev_set_drvdata(&dev->dev, NULL);
    
    This results in a NULL pointer BUG when blkfront_remove and blkif_free
    try to access the failing device's NULL struct blkfront_info.

    tpm: Restore functionality to xen vtpm driver.
    
    commit e487a0f52301293152a6f8c4e217f2a11dd808e3 upstream.
    
    Functionality of the xen-tpmfront driver was lost secondary to
    the introduction of xenbus multi-page support in commit ccc9d90a9a8b
    ("xenbus_client: Extend interface to support multi-page ring").
    
    In this commit pointer to location of where the shared page address
    is stored was being passed to the xenbus_grant_ring() function rather
    then the address of the shared page itself. This resulted in a situation
    where the driver would attach to the vtpm-stubdom but any attempt
    to send a command to the stub domain would timeout.
    
    A diagnostic finding for this regression is the following error
    message being generated when the xen-tpmfront driver probes for a
    device:
    
    <3>vtpm vtpm-0: tpm_transmit: tpm_send: error -62
    
    <3>vtpm vtpm-0: A TPM error (-62) occurred attempting to determine
    the timeouts
    
    This fix is relevant to all kernels from 4.1 forward which is the
    release in which multi-page xenbus support was introduced.
    
    Daniel De Graaf formulated the fix by code inspection after the
    regression point was located.

    xen-swiotlb: use actually allocated size on check physical continuous
    
    commit 7250f422da0480d8512b756640f131b9b893ccda upstream.
    
    xen_swiotlb_{alloc,free}_coherent() allocate/free memory based on the
    order of the pages and not size argument (bytes). This is inconsistent with
    range_straddles_page_boundary and memset which use the 'size' value,
    which may lead to not exchanging memory with Xen (range_straddles_page_boundary()
    returned true). And then the call to xen_swiotlb_free_coherent() would
    actually try to exchange the memory with Xen, leading to the kernel
    hitting an BUG (as the hypercall returned an error).
    
    This patch fixes it by making the 'size' variable be of the same size
    as the amount of memory allocated.

    ARM: dts: exynos: Mark 1 GHz CPU OPP as suspend OPP on Exynos5250
    
    commit 645b23da6f8b47f295fa87051335d41d139717a5 upstream.
    
    1 GHz CPU OPP is the default boot value for the Exynos5250 SOC, so mark it
    as suspend OPP. This fixes suspend/resume on Samsung Exynos5250 Snow
    Chomebook, which was broken since switching to generic cpufreq-dt driver
    in v4.3.

    f2fs: fix to recover cold bit of inode block during POR
    
    commit ef2a007134b4eaa39264c885999f296577bc87d2 upstream.
    
    Testcase to reproduce this bug:
    1. mkfs.f2fs /dev/sdd
    2. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
    3. touch /mnt/f2fs/file
    4. sync
    5. chattr +A /mnt/f2fs/file
    6. xfs_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "fsync"
    7. godown /mnt/f2fs
    8. umount /mnt/f2fs
    9. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
    10. chattr -A /mnt/f2fs/file
    11. xfs_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "fsync"
    12. umount /mnt/f2fs
    13. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
    14. lsattr /mnt/f2fs/file
    
    -----------------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
    
    But actually, we expect the corrct result is:
    
    -------A---------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
    
    The reason is in step 9) we missed to recover cold bit flag in inode
    block, so later, in fsync, we will skip write inode block due to below
    condition check, result in lossing data in another SPOR.
    
    f2fs_fsync_node_pages()
            if (!IS_DNODE(page) || !is_cold_node(page))
                    continue;
    
    Note that, I guess that some non-dir inode has already lost cold bit
    during POR, so in order to reenable recovery for those inode, let's
    try to recover cold bit in f2fs_iget() to save more fsynced data.

    commit 164a63fa6b384e30ceb96ed80bc7dc3379bc0960 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 66110abc4c931f879d70e83e1281f891699364bf.
    
    If we clear the cold data flag out of the writeback flow, we can miscount

    heavy GC.
    
    Balancing F2FS Async:
     - IO (CP:    1, Data:   -1, Flush: (   0    0    1), Discard: (   ...

    IB/rxe: fix for duplicate request processing and ack psns
    
    [ Upstream commit b97db58557f4aa6d9903f8e1deea6b3d1ed0ba43 ]
    
    Don't reset the resp opcode for a replayed read response.
    The resp opcode could be in the middle of a write or send
    sequence, when the duplicate read request was received.
    An example sequence is as follows:
    - Receive read request for 12KB PSN 20. Transmit read response
      first, middle and last with PSNs 20,21,22.
    - Receive write first PSN 23.
      At this point the resp psn is 24 and resp opcode is write first.
    - The sender notices that PSN 20 is dropped and retransmits.
      Receive read request for 12KB PSN 20. Transmit read response
      first, middle and last with PSNs 20,21,22. The resp opcode is
      set to -1, the resp psn remains 24.
    - Receive write first PSN 23. This is processed by duplicate_request().
      The resp opcode remains -1 and resp psn remains 24.
    - Receive write middle PSN 24. check_op_seq() reports a missing
      first error since the resp opcode is -1.
    
    When sending an ack for a duplicate send or write request,
    use the psn of the previous ack sent. Do not use the psn
    of a read response for the ack.
    An example sequence is as follows:
    - Receive write PSN 30. Transmit ACK for PSN 30.
    - Receive read request 4KB PSN 31. Transmit read response with
      PSN 31. The resp psn is now 32.
    - The sender notices that PSN 30 is dropped and retransmits.
      Receive write PSN 30. duplicate_request() sends an ACK with
      PSN 31. That is incorrect since PSN 31 was a read request.

    The IRQ work is added before the struct rtc is allocated and registered,
    but this struct is used in the IRQ handler. This may lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference.
    
    Switch to devm_rtc_allocate_device/rtc_register_device to allocate the rtc

    Testcase1:

    2. mount -t f2fs /dev/zram0 /mnt/f2fs
    3. xfs_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "pwrite 0 4k" -c "fsync"
    4. godown /mnt/f2fs
    5. umount /mnt/f2fs
    6. mount -t f2fs -o ro /dev/zram0 /mnt/f2fs
    7. umount /mnt/f2fs
    
    Testcase2:
    1. mkfs.f2fs /dev/zram0
    2. mount -t f2fs /dev/zram0 /mnt/f2fs
    3. touch /mnt/f2fs/file
    4. create process[pid = x] do:
            a) open /mnt/f2fs/file;
            b) unlink /mnt/f2fs/file
    5. godown -f /mnt/f2fs
    6. kill process[pid = x]
    7. umount /mnt/f2fs
    8. mount -t f2fs -o ro /dev/zram0 /mnt/f2fs
    9. umount /mnt/f2fs
    
    The reason is: during recovery, i_{c,m}time of inode will be updated, then
    the inode can be set dirty w/o being tracked in sbi->inode_list[DIRTY_META]
    global list, so later write_checkpoint will not flush such dirty inode into
    node page.
    
    Once umount is called, sync_filesystem() in generic_shutdown_super() will
    skip syncng dirty inodes due to sb_rdonly check, leaving dirty inodes
    there.
    
    To solve this issue, during umount, add remove SB_RDONLY flag in
    sb->s_flags, to make sure sync_filesystem() will not be skipped.

    Instead of playing whack-a-mole and changing SEND_SIG_PRIV to
    SEND_SIG_FORCED throughout the kernel to ensure a pid namespace init
    gets signals sent by the kernel, stop allowing a pid namespace init to
    ignore SIGKILL or SIGSTOP sent by the kernel.  A pid namespace init is
    only supposed to be able to ignore signals sent from itself and
    children with SIG_DFL.

    scsi: lpfc: Correct race with abort on completion path
    
    [ Upstream commit ca7fb76e091f889cfda1287c07a9358f73832b39 ]
    
    On io completion, the driver is taking an adapter wide lock and nulling the
    scsi command back pointer.  The nulling of the back pointer is to signify the
    io was completed and the scsi_done() routine was called.  However, the routine
    makes no check to see if the abort routine had done the same thing and
    possibly nulled the pointer. Thus it may doubly-complete the io.
    
    Make the following mods:
    
    - Check to make sure forward progress (call scsi_done()) only happens if the
      command pointer was non-null.
    
    - As the taking of the lock, which is adapter wide, is very costly on a system
      under load, null the pointer using an xchg operation rather than under lock.

    [ Upstream commit 0ef01a2d95fd62bb4f536e7ce4d5e8e74b97a244 ]
    
    When running an mds diagnostic that passes frames with the switch, soft
    lockups are detected. The driver is in a CQE processing loop and has
    sufficient amount of traffic that it never exits the ring processing routine,
    thus the "lockup".
    
    Cap the number of elements in the work processing routine to 64 elements. This
    ensures that the cpu will be given up and the handler reschedule to process
    additional items.

    uio: ensure class is registered before devices
    
    [ Upstream commit ae61cf5b9913027c6953a79ed3894da4f47061bd ]
    
    When both uio and the uio drivers are built in the kernel, it is possible
    for a driver to register devices before the uio class is registered.
    
    This may result in a NULL pointer dereference later on in
    get_device_parent() when accessing the class glue_dirs spinlock.
    
    The trace looks like that:

    IB/ipoib: Use dev_port to expose network interface port numbers
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b8b2a323008aedd39a8debb861b825707f01420 ]
    
    Some InfiniBand network devices have multiple ports on the same PCI
    function. This initializes the `dev_port' sysfs field of those
    network interfaces with their port number.
    
    Prior to this the kernel erroneously used the `dev_id' sysfs
    field of those network interfaces to convey the port number to userspace.
    
    The use of `dev_id' was considered correct until Linux 3.15,
    when another field, `dev_port', was defined for this particular
    purpose and `dev_id' was reserved for distinguishing stacked ifaces
    (e.g: VLANs) with the same hardware address as their parent device.
    
    Similar fixes to net/mlx4_en and many other drivers, which started
    exporting this information through `dev_id' before 3.15, were accepted
    into the kernel 4 years ago.
    See 76a066f2a2a0 (`net/mlx4_en: Expose port number through sysfs').

    firmware: coreboot: Unmap ioregion after device population
    
    [ Upstream commit 20edec388277b62ddfddb8b2b376a937a2cd6d1b ]
    
    Both callers of coreboot_table_init() ioremap the pointer that comes in
    but they don't unmap the memory on failure. Both of them also fail probe
    immediately with the return value of coreboot_table_init(), leaking a
    mapping when it fails. The mapping isn't necessary at all after devices
    are populated either, so we can just drop the mapping here when we exit
    the function. Let's do that to simplify the code a bit and plug the leak.

    The issue is that in dma pointer function we can have stale value
    of the register for current descriptor of channel.
    The register retains the number of the last descriptor that
    was transferred.
    
    Fix ensures that we report position, 0, till the one period worth of
    data is transferred.  After one period of data, in handler of period
    completion interrupt we update the config and correct value of descriptor
    starts reflecting.

    According to the synchronization rule for the del_timer_sync() function,
    the caller must not hold locks which would prevent completion of the
    timer's handler.
    
    The timer structure has its own lock that manages its synchronization.
    Setting the IOAT_CHAN_DOWN bit should prevent other CPUs from
    trying to use that device anyway, there is probably no need to call
    del_timer_sync() while holding the prep_lock. So the del_timer_sync()
    call is now moved outside of the prep_lock critical section to prevent
    the circular lock dependency.

    This fixes a pair of problems in the Smack ptrace checks
    related to checking capabilities. In both cases, as reported
    by Lukasz Pawelczyk, the raw capability calls are used rather
    than the Smack wrapper that check addition restrictions.
    In one case, as reported by Jann Horn, the wrong task is being
    checked for capabilities.

    10. lsattr /mnt/f2fs/file

    xhci: Avoid USB autosuspend when resuming USB2 ports.
    
    [ Upstream commit 330e2d61cdd58363eb5e66b2e72f76fe3c5492e0 ]
    
    When USB bus host controller root hub resumes from autosuspend,
    it immediately tries to enter auto-suspend, but there can be a
    scenario when root hub is resuming its usb2 ports, in that particular
    case USB host controller auto suspend fails since it is busy
    to resuming its usb2 ports.
    
    This makes multiple failed cycles of auto-suspend until all usb2
    ports of host controller root hub do not resume.
    
    This patch uses USB core framework usb_hcd_start_port_resume,
    usb_hcd_end_port_resume API's in order to  autoresume/autosuspend
    root hub properly.

    MD: fix invalid stored role for a disk
    
    [ Upstream commit d595567dc4f0c1d90685ec1e2e296e2cad2643ac ]
    
    If we change the number of array's device after device is removed from array,
    then add the device back to array, we can see that device is added as active
    role instead of spare which we expected.
    
    Please see the below link for details:
    https://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&m=153736982015076&w=2
    
    This is caused by that we prefer to use device's previous role which is
    recorded by saved_raid_disk, but we should respect the new number of
    conf->raid_disks since it could be changed after device is removed.

    exceeds the EOF, EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT should return EINVAL.
    
    Also fixed the helper function mext_check_coverage() so that if the
    logical block is beyond EOF, make it return immediately, instead of
    looping until the block number wraps all the away around.  This takes
    long enough that if there are multiple threads trying to do pound on
    an the same inode doing non-sensical things, it can end up triggering
    the kernel's soft lockup detector.

    xprtrdma: Reset credit grant properly after a disconnect
    
    [ Upstream commit ef739b2175dde9c05594f768cb78149f1ce2ac36 ]
    
    On a fresh connection, an RPC/RDMA client is supposed to send only
    one RPC Call until it gets a credit grant in the first RPC Reply
    from the server [RFC 8166, Section 3.3.3].
    
    There is a bug in the Linux client's credit accounting mechanism
    introduced by commit e7ce710a8802 ("xprtrdma: Avoid deadlock when
    credit window is reset"). On connect, it simply dumps all pending
    RPC Calls onto the new connection.
    
    Servers have been tolerant of this bad behavior. Currently no server
    implementation ever changes its credit grant over reconnects, and
    servers always repost enough Receives before connections are fully
    established.
    
    To correct this issue, ensure that the client resets both the credit
    grant _and_ the congestion window when handling a reconnect.

    PCI / ACPI: Enable wake automatically for power managed bridges
    
    [ Upstream commit 6299cf9ec3985cac70bede8a855b5087b81a6640 ]
    
    We enable power management automatically for bridges where
    pci_bridge_d3_possible() returns true. However, these bridges may have
    ACPI methods such as _DSW that need to be called before D3 entry. For
    example in Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th _DSW method is used to prepare
    D3cold for the PCIe root port hosting Thunderbolt chain. Because wake is
    not enabled _DSW method is never called and the port does not enter
    D3cold properly consuming more power than necessary.
    
    Users can work this around by writing "enabled" to "wakeup" sysfs file
    under the device in question but that is not something an ordinary user
    is expected to do.
    
    Since we already automatically enable power management for PCIe ports
    with ->bridge_d3 set extend that to enable wake for them as well,
    assuming the port has any ACPI wakeup related objects implemented in the
    namespace (adev->wakeup.flags.valid is true). This ensures the necessary
    ACPI methods get called at appropriate times and allows the root port in
    Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th to go into D3cold.

    VMCI: Resource wildcard match fixed
    
    [ Upstream commit 11924ba5e671d6caef1516923e2bd8c72929a3fe ]
    
    When adding a VMCI resource, the check for an existing entry
    would ignore that the new entry could be a wildcard. This could
    result in multiple resource entries that would match a given
    handle. One disastrous outcome of this is that the
    refcounting used to ensure that delayed callbacks for VMCI
    datagrams have run before the datagram is destroyed can be
    wrong, since the refcount could be increased on the duplicate
    entry. This in turn leads to a use after free bug. This issue
    was discovered by Hangbin Liu using KASAN and syzkaller.

    tpm: suppress transmit cmd error logs when TPM 1.2 is disabled/deactivated
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d6d0d62d9505a9816716aa484ebd0b04c795063 ]
    
    For TPM 1.2 chips the system setup utility allows to set the TPM device in
    one of the following states:
    
      * Active: Security chip is functional
      * Inactive: Security chip is visible, but is not functional
      * Disabled: Security chip is hidden and is not functional
    
    When choosing the "Inactive" state, the TPM 1.2 device is enumerated and
    registered, but sending TPM commands fail with either TPM_DEACTIVATED or
    TPM_DISABLED depending if the firmware deactivated or disabled the TPM.
    
    Since these TPM 1.2 error codes don't have special treatment, inactivating
    the TPM leads to a very noisy kernel log buffer that shows messages like
    the following:
    
      tpm_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
      tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
      ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=6)
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
      tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
    
    Let's just suppress error log messages for the TPM_{DEACTIVATED,DISABLED}
    return codes, since this is expected when the TPM 1.2 is set to Inactive.
    
    In that case the kernel log is cleaner and less confusing for users, i.e:
    
      tpm_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
      tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)

    usb: typec: tcpm: Report back negotiated PPS voltage and current
    
    [ Upstream commit 554fab6dbf20ee7298ed2d4e8398b85e6058abb7 ]
    
    Currently when requesting a specific voltage or current through
    the psy interface, for PPS, when reading back from that interface
    the values will always be the same as previously given, if the
    request was successful. However PPS only allows for 20mV voltage
    steps and 50mA current steps, and the psy class expects microvolt
    and micro amp requests, so inbetween values can be provided through
    this interface. Really when reading back the true values negotiated
    should be given, and not the ones originally asked for.
    
    To report the actual values negotiated with the Source, the values
    stored are now rounded down to the relevant step units prior to
    building the PPS request, so that those values are later correctly
    reported through the psy interface. In addition this improves the
    adjustments made to meet the operating power requirements of the
    platform, which previously could have been slightly out due to not
    using valid PPS units of voltage and current.

    The IRQ physical address is allocated from region 0, rather than

    the bitmap and to use region 0 for all types of interrupt.
    
    This corrects a problem which prevents the interrupt being
    signalled correctly if using the first address in the AXI region,
    since an offset of zero will always be mapped to region 0.

    PCI: mediatek: Fix mtk_pcie_find_port() endpoint/port matching logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 074d6f32689ce05a084b6fa3db38445745bf11cc ]
    
    The Mediatek's host controller has two slots, each with its own control
    registers. The host driver needs to identify what slot is connected to
    what port in order to access the device's configuration space.
    
    Current code retrieving slot connected to a given endpoint device.
    
    Assuming each slot is connected to one endpoint device as below:
    
                    host bridge
      bus 0 --> __________|_______
               |                  |
               |                  |
             slot 0             slot 1
      bus 1 -->|        bus 2 --> |
               |                  |
             EP 0               EP 1
    
    During PCI enumeration, system software will scan all the PCI devices on
    every bus starting from devfn 0. Using PCI_SLOT(devfn) for matching an
    endpoint to its slot is erroneous in that the devfn does not contain the
    hierarchical bus numbering in it. In order to match an endpoint with its
    slot (and related port), the PCI tree must be walked up to the root bus
    (where the root ports are situated) and then the PCI_SLOT(devfn)
    matching logic can be correctly applied for matching.
    
    This patch fixes the mtk_pcie_find_port() slot matching logic by adding
    appropriate PCI tree walking code to retrieve the slot/port a given
    endpoint is connected to.

    [ Upstream commit d455f29f6d76a5f94881ca1289aaa1e90617ff5d ]
    
    Fix possible recursive lock warning. Its a false warning as the locks are
    part of two differnt HW Queue data structure - cmdq and creq. Debug kernel
    is throwing the following warning and stack trace.

    [ Upstream commit ed51efd2ce44091a858ad829f666727e7c95695e ]
    
    In the failure path, nq->bar_reg_iomem gets accessed without
    initializing. Avoid this by calling the bnxt_qplib_nq_stop_irq only if the
    initialization is complete.

    IB/ipoib: Clear IPCB before icmp_send
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d6e4d12da2c308f8f976d3955c45ee62539ac98 ]
    
    IPCB should be cleared before icmp_send, since it may contain data from
    previous layers and the data could be misinterpreted as ip header options,
    which later caused the ihl to be set to an invalid value and resulted in
    the following stack corruption:

    scsi: megaraid_sas: fix a missing-check bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 47db7873136a9c57c45390a53b57019cf73c8259 ]
    
    In megasas_mgmt_compat_ioctl_fw(), to handle the structure
    compat_megasas_iocpacket 'cioc', a user-space structure megasas_iocpacket
    'ioc' is allocated before megasas_mgmt_ioctl_fw() is invoked to handle
    the packet. Since the two data structures have different fields, the data
    is copied from 'cioc' to 'ioc' field by field. In the copy process,
    'sense_ptr' is prepared if the field 'sense_len' is not null, because it
    will be used in megasas_mgmt_ioctl_fw(). To prepare 'sense_ptr', the
    user-space data 'ioc->sense_off' and 'cioc->sense_off' are copied and
    saved to kernel-space variables 'local_sense_off' and 'user_sense_off'
    respectively. Given that 'ioc->sense_off' is also copied from
    'cioc->sense_off', 'local_sense_off' and 'user_sense_off' should have the
    same value. However, 'cioc' is in the user space and a malicious user can
    race to change the value of 'cioc->sense_off' after it is copied to
    'ioc->sense_off' but before it is copied to 'user_sense_off'. By doing
    so, the attacker can inject different values into 'local_sense_off' and
    'user_sense_off'. This can cause undefined behavior in the following
    execution, because the two variables are supposed to be same.
    
    This patch enforces a check on the two kernel variables 'local_sense_off'
    and 'user_sense_off' to make sure they are the same after the copy. In
    case they are not, an error code EINVAL will be returned.

    KVM: nVMX: Clear reserved bits of #DB exit qualification
    
    [ Upstream commit cfb634fe3052aefc4e1360fa322018c9a0b49755 ]
    
    According to volume 3 of the SDM, bits 63:15 and 12:4 of the exit
    qualification field for debug exceptions are reserved (cleared to
    0). However, the SDM is incorrect about bit 16 (corresponding to
    DR6.RTM). This bit should be set if a debug exception (#DB) or a
    breakpoint exception (#BP) occurred inside an RTM region while
    advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions was enabled. Note that
    this is the opposite of DR6.RTM, which "indicates (when clear) that a
    debug exception (#DB) or breakpoint exception (#BP) occurred inside an
    RTM region while advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions was
    enabled."
    
    There is still an issue with stale DR6 bits potentially being
    misreported for the current debug exception.  DR6 should not have been
    modified before vectoring the #DB exception, and the "new DR6 bits"
    should be available somewhere, but it was and they aren't.

    UAPI: ndctl: Fix g++-unsupported initialisation in headers
    
    [ Upstream commit 9607871f37dc3e717639694b8d0dc738f2a68efc ]
    
    The following code in the linux/ndctl header file:
    
            static inline const char *nvdimm_bus_cmd_name(unsigned cmd)
            {
                    static const char * const names[] = {
                            [ND_CMD_ARS_CAP] = "ars_cap",
                            [ND_CMD_ARS_START] = "ars_start",
                            [ND_CMD_ARS_STATUS] = "ars_status",
                            [ND_CMD_CLEAR_ERROR] = "clear_error",
                            [ND_CMD_CALL] = "cmd_call",
                    };
    
                    if (cmd < ARRAY_SIZE(names) && names[cmd])
                            return names[cmd];
                    return "unknown";
            }
    
    is broken in a number of ways:
    
     (1) ARRAY_SIZE() is not generally defined.
    
     (2) g++ does not support "non-trivial" array initialisers fully yet.
    
     (3) Every file that calls this function will acquire a copy of names[].
    
    The same goes for nvdimm_cmd_name().
    
    Fix all three by converting to a switch statement where each case returns a
    string.  That way if cmd is a constant, the compiler can trivially reduce it
    and, if not, the compiler can use a shared lookup table if it thinks that is
    more efficient.
    
    A better way would be to remove these functions and their arrays from the
    header entirely.

    scsi: ufs: Schedule clk gating work on correct queue
    
    [ Upstream commit f4bb7704699beee9edfbee875daa9089c86cf724 ]
    
    With commit 10e5e37581fc ("scsi: ufs: Add clock ungating to a separate
    workqueue"), clock gating work was moved to a separate work queue with
    WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set, since clock gating could occur from a memory reclaim
    context. Unfortunately, clk_gating.gate_work was left queued via
    schedule_delayed_work, which is a system workqueue that does not have

    scsi: esp_scsi: Track residual for PIO transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit fd47d919d0c336e7c22862b51ee94927ffea227a ]
    
    If a target disconnects during a PIO data transfer the command may fail
    when the target reconnects:
    
    scsi host1: DMA length is zero!
    scsi host1: cur adr[04380000] len[00000000]
    
    The scsi bus is then reset. This happens because the residual reached
    zero before the transfer was completed.
    
    The usual residual calculation relies on the Transfer Count registers.
    That works for DMA transfers but not for PIO transfers. Fix the problem
    by storing the PIO transfer residual and using that to correctly
    calculate bytes_sent.

    md: fix memleak for mempool
    
    [ Upstream commit 6aaa58c994277647f8b05ffef3b9b225a2d08f36 ]
    
    I noticed kmemleak report memory leak when run create/stop
    md in a loop, backtrace:

    f2fs: fix to account IO correctly for cgroup writeback
    
    [ Upstream commit 78efac537de33faab9a4302cc05a70bb4a8b3b63 ]
    
    Now, we have supported cgroup writeback, it depends on correctly IO
    account of specified filesystem.
    
    But in commit d1b3e72d5490 ("f2fs: submit bio of in-place-update pages"),
    we split write paths from f2fs_submit_page_mbio() to two:
    - f2fs_submit_page_bio() for IPU path
    - f2fs_submit_page_bio() for OPU path
    
    But still we account write IO only in f2fs_submit_page_mbio(), result in
    incorrect IO account, fix it by adding missing IO account in IPU path.

    net: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: fix OF child-node lookup
    
    [ Upstream commit ac63043d8cb5503c7e0fe110f947eacf2663804e ]
    
    Use the new of_get_compatible_child() helper to lookup the mdio-internal
    child node instead of using of_find_compatible_node(), which searches
    the entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated
    (i.e. non-child) node.
    
    This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
    deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
    argument (i.e. the mdio-mux node). Fortunately, this was inadvertently
    balanced by a failure to drop the mdio-mux reference after lookup.
    
    While at it, also fix the related mdio-internal- and phy-node reference
    leaks.

    cifs: fix a credits leak for compund commands
    
    [ Upstream commit cb5c2e63948451d38c977685fffc06e23beb4517 ]
    
    When processing the mids for compounds we would only add credits based on
    the last successful mid in the compound which would leak credits and
    eventually triggering a re-connect.
    
    Fix this by splitting the mid processing part into two loops instead of one
    where the first loop just waits for all mids and then counts how many
    credits we were granted for the whole compound.

    ath10k: schedule hardware restart if WMI command times out
    
    [ Upstream commit a9911937e7d332761e8c4fcbc7ba0426bdc3956f ]
    
    When running in AP mode, ath10k sometimes suffers from TX credit
    starvation. The issue is hard to reproduce and shows up once in a
    few days, but has been repeatedly seen with QCA9882 and a large
    range of firmwares, including 10.2.4.70.67.
    
    Once the module is in this state, TX credits are never replenished,
    which results in "SWBA overrun" errors, as no beacons can be sent.
    Even worse, WMI commands run in a timeout while holding the conf
    mutex for three seconds each, making any further operations slow
    and the whole system unresponsive.
    
    The firmware/driver never recovers from that state automatically,
    and triggering TX flush or warm restarts won't work over WMI. So
    issue a hardware restart if a WMI command times out due to missing
    TX credits. This implies a connectivity outage of about 1.4s in AP
    mode, but brings back the interface and the whole system to a usable
    state. WMI command timeouts have not been seen in absent of this
    specific issue, so taking such drastic actions seems legitimate.

    wil6210: fix RX buffers release and unmap
    
    [ Upstream commit 84f16fbb62384fb209cd35741d94eb00b5ca2746 ]
    
    RX SKBs are released in both wil6210 rmmod and RX handle.
    As there is no lock to protect the buffers DMA unmap,
    the SKB pointer in buff_arr is used to check if the buffer
    memory was already released.
    Setting wil->rx_buff_mgmt.buff_arr[buff_id].skb to NULL before the DMA
    memory unmap will prevent duplicate unmapping of the same memory.
    Move the buffer ID to the free list also in case the SKB is NULL.

    ixgbe: disallow IPsec Tx offload when in SR-IOV mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 47b6f50077e68bcd544f657526dad4bfdce7e87d ]
    
    There seems to be a problem in the x540's internal switch wherein if SR-IOV
    mode is enabled and an offloaded IPsec packet is sent to a local VF,
    the packet is silently dropped.  This might never be a problem as it is
    somewhat a corner case, but if someone happens to be using IPsec offload
    from the PF to a VF that just happens to get migrated to the local box,
    communication will mysteriously fail.
    
    Not good.
    
    A simple way to protect from this is to simply not allow any IPsec offloads
    for outgoing packets when num_vfs != 0.  This doesn't help any offloads that
    were created before SR-IOV was enabled, but we'll get to that later.

    gpio: brcmstb: allow 0 width GPIO banks
    
    [ Upstream commit bfba223dcc4548632d8f3bfd15690a86d4c68504 ]
    
    Sometimes we have empty banks within the GPIO block. This commit allows
    proper handling of 0 width GPIO banks. We handle 0 width GPIO banks by
    incrementing the bank and number of GPIOs, but not initializing them.
    This will mean a call into the non-existent GPIOs will return an error.
    
    Also remove "GPIO registered" dev print. This information is misleading
    since the incremented banks and gpio_base do not reflect the actual GPIOs
    that get initialized. We leave this information out since it is already
    printed with dev_dbg.

    There is a bug in FW where the sequence control may be

    of the ieee80211 header.
    
    However, in BAR there is no sequence control in the header,

    During testing in ARM32 platforms, observed below kernel panic, as driver
    accessing data beyond the allocated memory while submitting URB to USB.
    
    Fix: Resolved this by specifying correct length by considering 64 bit
    alignment. so that, USB bus driver will access only allocated memory.
    
    Unit-test: Tested and confirm that driver bring up and scanning,
    connection and data transfer works fine with this fix.

    There are only 128 entries in vf vlan table, if user has added
    more than 128 vlan, fw will ignore it and disable the vf vlan
    table. So when user deletes the vlan entry that has not been
    set to vf vlan table, fw will return not found result and driver
    treat that as error, which will cause vlan delete failed problem.
    
    This patch fixes it by returning ok when fw returns not found
    result.

    NOTE: in case it's helpful to someone reading this, the way to tell
    whether to do the -EINVAL or not is to look at the PCONFDUMP for a
    given attribute.  If the last element (has_arg) is false then you need
    to do the -EINVAL trick.
    
    ALSO NOTE: it seems unlikely that the values returned when we try to
    get PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP will actually be printed since "has_arg"
    is false for that one, but I guess it's still fine to return different
    values so I kept doing that.  It seems like another driver (ssbi-gpio)
    uses a custom attribute (PM8XXX_QCOM_PULL_UP_STRENGTH) for something
    similar so maybe a future change should do that here too.

    When we don't have the iputils-debuginfo package installed, i.e. when we
    don't have the DWARF information needed to resolve ping's samples, we
    end up failing this 'perf test' entry:
    
      # perf test ping
      62: probe libc's inet_pton & backtrace it with ping       : Ok
      # rpm -e iputils-debuginfo
      # perf test ping
      62: probe libc's inet_pton & backtrace it with ping       : FAILED!
      #
    
    Fix it to accept "[unknown]" where the symbol + offset, when resolved,
    is expected.
    
    I think this will fail in the other arches as well, but since I can't
    test now, I'm leaving s390x and ppc cases as-is.

    bpf/verifier: fix verifier instability
    
    [ Upstream commit a9c676bc8fc58d00eea9836fb14ee43c0346416a ]
    
    Edward Cree says:
    In check_mem_access(), for the PTR_TO_CTX case, after check_ctx_access()
    has supplied a reg_type, the other members of the register state are set
    appropriately.  Previously reg.range was set to 0, but as it is in a
    union with reg.map_ptr, which is larger, upper bytes of the latter were
    left in place.  This then caused the memcmp() in regsafe() to fail,
    preventing some branches from being pruned (and occasionally causing the
    same program to take a varying number of processed insns on repeated
    verifier runs).
    
    Fix the instability by clearing bpf_reg_state in __mark_reg_[un]known()

    ACPI / LPSS: Add alternative ACPI HIDs for Cherry Trail DMA controllers
    
    [ Upstream commit 240714061c58e6b1abfb3322398a7634151c06cb ]
    
    Bay and Cherry Trail DSTDs represent a different set of devices depending
    on which OS the device think it is booting. One set of decices for Windows
    and another set of devices for Android which targets the Android-x86 Linux
    kernel fork (which e.g. used to have its own display driver instead of
    using the i915 driver).
    
    Which set of devices we are actually going to get is out of our control,
    this is controlled by the ACPI OSID variable, which gets either set through
    an EFI setup option, or sometimes is autodetected. So we need to support
    both.
    
    This commit adds support for the 80862286 and 808622C0 ACPI HIDs which we
    get for the first resp. second DMA controller on Cherry Trail devices when
    OSID is set to Android.

    spi: gpio: No MISO does not imply no RX
    
    [ Upstream commit abf5feef3ff0cefade0c76be53b59e55fdd46093 ]
    
    There is a logical problem in spi-gpio with host just
    assigning a MOSI line and no MISO: this is interpreted
    as the host cannot do RX and the host is flagged with
    SPI_MASTER_NO_RX.
    
    This is wrong: since GPIO lines can switch direction,
    in 3WIRE operation the host will simply reverse the
    direction of the GPIO line and start reading from it,
    there is even code for doing this in the driver, but
    it went unnoticed because it was tested by using a
    master with 4 wires but a device using just 3 wires.
    
    Remove the offending flag.

    block, bfq: correctly charge and reset entity service in all cases
    
    [ Upstream commit cbeb869a3d1110450186b738199963c5e68c2a71 ]
    
    BFQ schedules entities (which represent either per-process queues or
    groups of queues) as a function of their timestamps. In particular, as
    a function of their (virtual) finish times. The finish time of an
    entity is computed as a function of the budget assigned to the entity,
    assuming, tentatively, that the entity, once in service, will receive
    an amount of service equal to its budget. Then, when the entity is
    expired because it finishes to be served, this finish time is updated
    as a function of the actual service received by the entity. This
    allows the entity to be correctly charged with only the service
    received, and then to be correctly re-scheduled.
    
    Yet an entity may receive service also while not being the entity in
    service (in the scheduling environment of its parent entity), for
    several reasons. If the entity remains with no backlog while receiving
    this 'unofficial' service, then it is expired. Also on such an
    expiration, the finish time of the entity should be updated to account
    for only the service actually received by the entity. Unfortunately,
    such an update is not performed for an entity expiring without being
    the entity in service.
    
    In a similar vein, the service counter of the entity in service is
    reset when the entity is expired, to be ready to be used for next
    service cycle. This reset too should be performed also in case an
    entity is expired because it remains empty after receiving service
    while not being the entity in service. But in this case the reset is
    not performed.
    
    This commit performs the above update of the finish time and reset of
    the service received, also for an entity expiring while not being the
    entity in service.

    net: phy: phylink: ensure the carrier is off when starting phylink
    
    [ Upstream commit aeeb2e8fdefdd5d257a1446351c70cb3df540199 ]
    
    Phylink made an assumption about the carrier state being down when
    calling phylink_start(). If this assumption isn't satisfied, the
    internal phylink state could misbehave and a net device could end up not
    being functional.
    
    This patch fixes this by explicitly calling netif_carrier_off() in
    phylink_start().

    pinctrl: sunxi: fix 'pctrl->functions' allocation in sunxi_pinctrl_build_state
    
    [ Upstream commit a4925311a5443126ecc90671a1604ea7b0f5b32e ]
    
    fixes following Smatch static check warning:

     warn: passing devm_ allocated variable to kfree. 'pctrl->functions'
    
    As we will be calling krealloc() on pointer 'pctrl->functions', which means
    kfree() will be called in there, devm_kzalloc() shouldn't be used with
    the allocation in the first place.  Fix the warning by calling kcalloc()
    and managing the free procedure in error path on our own.

    x86: boot: Fix EFI stub alignment
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c1442a9d039a1a3302fa93e9a11001c5f23b624 ]
    
    We currently align the end of the compressed image to a multiple of
    16.  However, the PE-COFF header included in the EFI stub says that
    the file alignment is 32 bytes, and when adding an EFI signature to
    the file it must first be padded to this alignment.
    
    sbsigntool commands warn about this:
    
      warning: file-aligned section .text extends beyond end of file
      warning: checksum areas are greater than image size. Invalid section table?
    
    Worse, pesign -at least when creating a detached signature- uses the
    hash of the unpadded file, resulting in an invalid signature if
    padding is required.
    
    Avoid both these problems by increasing alignment to 32 bytes when
    CONFIG_EFI_STUB is enabled.

    efi/x86: Call efi_parse_options() from efi_main()
    
    [ Upstream commit c33ce984435bb6142792802d75513a71e55d1969 ]
    
    Before this commit we were only calling efi_parse_options() from
    make_boot_params(), but make_boot_params() only gets called if the
    kernel gets booted directly as an EFI executable. So when booted through
    e.g. grub we ended up not parsing the commandline in the boot code.
    
    This makes the drivers/firmware/efi/libstub code ignore the "quiet"
    commandline argument resulting in the following message being printed:
    "EFI stub: UEFI Secure Boot is enabled."
    
    Despite the quiet request. This commits adds an extra call to
    efi_parse_options() to efi_main() to make sure that the options are
    always processed. This fixes quiet not working.
    
    This also fixes the libstub code ignoring nokaslr and efi=nochunk.

    net: hns3: Fix for packet buffer setting bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 996ff91840eb6f288826e472685abde78bac20ea ]
    
    The hardware expects a unit of 128 bytes when setting
    packet buffer. When calculating the packet buffer size,
    hclge_rx_buffer_calc does not round up the size as a unit
    of 128 byte, which may casue packet lost problem when stress

    This patch fixes it by rounding up packet size when calculating.

    ice: update fw version check logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 396fbf9cab5dc07f8f87773062a8d35f54b40a05 ]
    
    We have MAX_FW_API_VER_BRANCH, MAX_FW_API_VER_MAJOR, and
    MAX_FW_API_VER_MINOR that we use in ice_controlq.h to test when a
    firmware version is newer than expected. This is currently tested by
    comparing each field separately. Thus, we compare the branch field
    against the MAX_FW_API_VER_BRANCH, and so forth.
    
    This means that currently, if we suppose that the max firmware version
    is defined as 0.2.1, i.e.
    
    Then firmware 0.1.3 will fail to load. This is because the minor version
    3 is greater than the max minor version 1.
    
    This is not intuitive, because of the notion that increasing the major
    firmware version to 2 should mean any firmware version with a major
    version is less than 2 should be considered older than 2...
    
    In order to allow both 0.2.1 and 0.1.3 to load, you would have to define
    the "max" firmware version as 0.2.3.. It is possible that such
    a firmware version doesn't even exist yet!
    
    Fix this by replacing the current logic with an updated check that
    behaves as follows:
    
    First, we check the major version. If it is greater than the expected
    version, then we prevent driver load. Additionally, a warning message is
    logged to indicate to the system administrator that they need to update
    their driver. This is now the only case where the driver will refuse to
    load.
    
    Second, if the major version is less than the expected version, we log
    an information message indicating the NVM should be updated.
    
    Third, if the major version is exact, we'll then check the minor
    version. If the minor version is more than two versions less than
    expected, we log an information message indicating the NVM should be
    updated. If it is more than two versions greater than the expected
    version, we log an information message that the driver should be
    updated.
    
    To support this, the ice_aq_ver_check function needs its signature
    updated to pass the HW structure. Since we now pass this structure,
    there is no need to pass the firmware API versions separately.

    ice: fix changing of ring descriptor size (ethtool -G)
    
    [ Upstream commit f934bb9b8b6136edd261b2dc2c9ad4dbc39ffc66 ]
    
    rx_mini_pending was set to an incorrect value. This was causing EINVAL to
    always be returned to 'ethtool -G'. The driver does not support mini or
    jumbo rings so the respective settings should be zero.
    
    Also, change the valid range of the number of descriptors in the rings to
    make the code simpler and easier for users to understand (this removes the
    valid settings of 8 and 16). Add a system log message indicating when the
    number is rounded-up from what the user specifies with the 'ethtool -G'
    command (i.e. when it is not a multiple of 32), and update the log message
    when a user-provided value is out of range to also indicate the stride.

    signal: Introduce COMPAT_SIGMINSTKSZ for use in compat_sys_sigaltstack
    
    [ Upstream commit 22839869f21ab3850fbbac9b425ccc4c0023926f ]
    
    The sigaltstack(2) system call fails with -ENOMEM if the new alternative
    signal stack is found to be smaller than SIGMINSTKSZ. On architectures
    such as arm64, where the native value for SIGMINSTKSZ is larger than
    the compat value, this can result in an unexpected error being reported
    to a compat task. See, for example:
    
      https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904385
    
    This patch fixes the problem by extending do_sigaltstack to take the
    minimum signal stack size as an additional parameter, allowing the
    native and compat system call entry code to pass in their respective
    values. COMPAT_SIGMINSTKSZ is just defined as SIGMINSTKSZ if it has not
    been defined by the architecture.

    nvme: call nvme_complete_rq when nvmf_check_ready fails for mpath I/O
    
    [ Upstream commit 783f4a4408e1251d17f333ad56abac24dde988b9 ]
    
    When an io is rejected by nvmf_check_ready() due to validation of the
    controller state, the nvmf_fail_nonready_command() will normally return
    BLK_STS_RESOURCE to requeue and retry.  However, if the controller is
    dying or the I/O is marked for NVMe multipath, the I/O is failed so that
    the controller can terminate or so that the io can be issued on a
    different path.  Unfortunately, as this reject point is before the
    transport has accepted the command, blk-mq ends up completing the I/O
    and never calls nvme_complete_rq(), which is where multipath may preserve
    or re-route the I/O. The end result is, the device user ends up seeing an
    EIO error.
    
    Example: single path connectivity, controller is under load, and a reset
    is induced.  An I/O is received:
    
      a) while the reset state has been set but the queues have yet to be
         stopped; or
      b) after queues are started (at end of reset) but before the reconnect
         has completed.
    
    The I/O finishes with an EIO status.
    
    This patch makes the following changes:
    
      - Adds the HOST_PATH_ERROR pathing status from TP4028
      - Modifies the reject point such that it appears to queue successfully,
        but actually completes the io with the new pathing status and calls
        nvme_complete_rq().
      - nvme_complete_rq() recognizes the new status, avoids resetting the
        controller (likely was already done in order to get this new status),
        and calls the multipather to clear the current path that errored.
        This allows the next command (retry or new command) to select a new
        path if there is one.

    mtd: rawnand: atmel: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit fbed20280d912449cfb40c382cb55e3d11502587 ]
    
    There is a potential execution path in which function
    of_find_compatible_node() returns NULL. In such a case,
    we end up having a NULL pointer dereference when accessing
    pointer *nfc_np* in function of_clk_get().
    
    So, we better don't take any chances and fix this by null
    checking pointer *nfc_np* before calling of_clk_get().

    [ Upstream commit 2cc81c6992248ea37d0241bc325977bab310bc3b ]
    
    In resctrl filesystem, mount options exist to enable L3/L2 CDP and MBA
    Software Controller features if the platform supports them:
    
     mount -t resctrl resctrl [-o cdp[,cdpl2][,mba_MBps]] /sys/fs/resctrl
    
    But currently only "cdp" option is displayed in /proc/mounts. "cdpl2" and
    "mba_MBps" options are not shown even when they are active.
    
    Before:
     # mount -t resctrl resctrl -o cdp,mba_MBps /sys/fs/resctrl
     # grep resctrl /proc/mounts
     /sys/fs/resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl resctrl rw,relatime,cdp 0 0

    cpufreq: dt: Try freeing static OPPs only if we have added them
    
    [ Upstream commit 51c99dd2c06b234575661fa1e0a1dea6c3ef566f ]
    
    We can not call dev_pm_opp_of_cpumask_remove_table() freely anymore
    since the latest OPP core updates as that uses reference counting to
    free resources. There are cases where no static OPPs are added (using
    DT) for a platform and trying to remove the OPP table may end up
    decrementing refcount which is already zero and hence generating
    warnings.
    
    Lets track if we were able to add static OPPs or not and then only
    remove the table based on that. Some reshuffling of code is also done to
    do that.

    ACPI / processor: Fix the return value of acpi_processor_ids_walk()
    
    [ Upstream commit d0381bf4f80c571dde1244fe5b85dc35e8b3f546 ]
    
    ACPI driver should make sure all the processor IDs in their ACPI Namespace
    are unique. the driver performs a depth-first walk of the namespace tree
    and calls the acpi_processor_ids_walk() to check the duplicate IDs.
    
    But, the acpi_processor_ids_walk() mistakes the return value. If a
    processor is checked, it returns true which causes the walk break
    immediately, and other processors will never be checked.
    
    Repace the value with AE_OK which is the standard acpi_status value.
    And don't abort the namespace walk even on error.

    ACPI / PM: LPIT: Register sysfs attributes based on FADT
    
    [ Upstream commit 1cdda9486f5103fb133f88e662e48c504adbb779 ]
    
    ACPI Low Power S0 Idle capabilities are announced via FADT table and can
    be used to inform the kernel about the presence of one or more Low Power
    Idle (LPI) entries as descried in LPIT table. LPIT table can exist
    independently even if the FADT S0 Idle flag is not set and thus it could
    confuse user since the following cpuidle attributes are created.
    
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/low_power_idle_cpu_residency_us
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/low_power_idle_system_residency_us
    
    Presence or absence of above attributes could mean that the given
    platform supports S0ix state or not.
    
    This change allows to create the above cpuidle attributes only if
    FADT table supports Low Power S0 Idle.

    ACPI/PPTT: Handle architecturally unknown cache types
    
    [ Upstream commit 59bbff3775c0951300f7b41345a54b999438f8d0 ]
    
    The type of a cache might not be specified by architectural mechanisms (ie
    system registers), but its type might be specified in the PPTT.  In this
    case, we should populate the type of the cache, rather than leave it
    undefined.
    
    This fixes the issue where the cacheinfo driver will not populate sysfs
    for such caches, resulting in the information missing from utilities like
    lstopo and lscpu, thus degrading the user experience.

    And we want to set WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY and actually clear
    it too in wl1271_recovery_work() and just downgrade the error to a
    warning to prevent overly verbose output.

    When reading the profiles from the EWRD table in ACPI, we loop over

    profiles specified in ACPI without checking its validity, so if the
    ACPI table is corrupted and the number is larger than our array size,
    we will try to make an out-of-bounds access.
    
    Fix this by making sure the value specified in the ACPI table is

    iwlwifi: mvm: clear HW_RESTART_REQUESTED when stopping the interface
    
    [ Upstream commit 155f7e0441cd121b1e673d465a35e99f4b9b2f0b ]
    
    Fix a bug that happens in the following scenario:
    1) suspend without WoWLAN
    2) mac80211 calls drv_stop because of the suspend
    3) __iwl_mvm_mac_stop deallocates the aux station
    4) during drv_stop the firmware crashes
    5) iwlmvm:
            * sets IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED
            * asks mac80211 to kick the restart flow
    6) mac80211 puts the restart worker into a freezable
       queue which means that the worker will not run for now
       since the workqueue is already frozen
    7) ...
    8) resume
    9) mac80211 runs ieee80211_reconfig as part of the resume
    10) mac80211 detects that a restart flow has been requested
        and that we are now resuming from suspend and cancels
        the restart worker
    11) mac80211 calls drv_start()
    12) __iwl_mvm_mac_start checks that IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED
        clears it, sets IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART and calls
        iwl_mvm_restart_cleanup()
    13) iwl_fw_error_dump gets called and accesses the device
        to get debug data
    14) iwl_mvm_up adds the aux station
    15) iwl_mvm_add_aux_sta() allocates an internal station for
        the aux station
    16) iwl_mvm_allocate_int_sta() tests IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART
        and doesn't really allocate a station ID for the aux
        station
    17) a new queue is added for the aux station
    
    Note that steps from 5 to 9 aren't really part of the
    problem but were described for the sake of completeness.
    
    Once the iwl_mvm_mac_stop() is called, the device is not
    accessible, meaning that step 12) can't succeed and we'll
    see the following:

    The station id of the aux station is set to 0xff in step 3
    and because we don't really allocate a new station id for
    the auxliary station (as explained in 16), we end up sending
    a command to the firmware asking to connect the queue
    to station id 0xff. This makes the firmware crash with the
    following information:

    Fix this by clearing IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED
    in iwl_mvm_mac_stop(). We won't be able to collect debug
    data anyway and when we will brought up again, we will
    have a clean state from the firmware perspective.
    Since we won't have IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART set in

    iwlwifi: pcie: avoid empty free RB queue
    
    [ Upstream commit 868a1e863f95183f00809363fefba6d4f5bcd116 ]
    
    If all free RB queues are empty, the driver will never restock the
    free RB queue.  That's because the restocking happens in the Rx flow,
    and if the free queue is empty there will be no Rx.
    
    Although there's a background worker (a.k.a. allocator) allocating
    memory for RBs so that the Rx handler can restock them, the worker may
    run only after the free queue has become empty (and then it is too
    late for restocking as explained above).
    
    There is a solution for that called 'emergency': If the number of used
    RB's reaches half the amount of all RB's, the Rx handler will not wait
    for the allocator but immediately allocate memory for the used RB's
    and restock the free queue.
    
    But, since the used RB's is per queue, it may happen that the used
    RB's are spread between the queues such that the emergency check will
    fail for each of the queues
    (and still run out of RBs, causing the above symptom).
    
    To fix it, move to emergency mode if the sum of *all* used RBs (for
    all Rx queues) reaches half the amount of all RB's

    mtd: rawnand: denali: set SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES register to 8 if unset
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d55c668b218a1db68b5044bce4de74e1bd0f0c8 ]
    
    NAND devices need additional data area (OOB) for error correction,
    but it is also used for Bad Block Marker (BBM).  In many cases, the
    first byte in OOB is used for BBM, but the location actually depends
    on chip vendors.  The NAND controller should preserve the precious
    BBM to keep track of bad blocks.
    
    In Denali IP, the SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES register is used to specify
    the number of bytes to skip from the start of OOB.  The ECC engine
    will automatically skip the specified number of bytes when it gets
    access to OOB area.
    
    The same value for SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES should be used between
    firmware and the operating system if you intend to use the NAND
    device across the control hand-off.
    
    In fact, the current denali.c code expects firmware to have already
    set the SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES register, then reads the value out.
    
    If no firmware (or bootloader) has initialized the controller, the
    register value is zero, which is the default after power-on-reset.
    In other words, the Linux driver cannot initialize the controller
    by itself.
    
    Some possible solutions are:
    
     [1] Add a DT property to specify the skipped bytes in OOB
     [2] Associate the preferred value with compatible
     [3] Hard-code the default value in the driver
    
    My first attempt was [1], but in the review process, [3] was suggested
    as a counter-implementation.
    (https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/983055/)
    
    The default value 8 was chosen to match to the boot ROM of the UniPhier
    platform.  The preferred value may vary by platform.  If so, please
    trade up to a different solution.

    cpupower: Fix coredump on VMWare
    
    [ Upstream commit f69ffc5d3db8f1f03fd6d1df5930f9a1fbd787b6 ]
    
    cpupower crashes on VMWare guests.  The guests have the AMD PStateDef MSR
    (0xC0010064 + state number) set to zero.  As a result fid and did are zero
    and the crash occurs because of a divide by zero (cof = fid/did).  This
    can be prevented by checking the enable bit in the PStateDef MSR before
    calculating cof.  By doing this the value of pstate[i] remains zero and
    the value can be tested before displaying the active Pstates.
    
    Check the enable bit in the PstateDef register for all supported families
    and only print out enabled Pstates.

    dma_{,un}map_sg expect an enum of type dma_data_direction but this
    driver uses dma_transfer_direction for everything. Convert the driver to
    use dma_data_direction for these two functions.
    
    There are two places that strictly require an enum of type
    dma_transfer_direction: the direction member in struct dma_slave_config
    and the direction parameter in dmaengine_prep_slave_sg. To avoid using
    an explicit cast, add a simple function, ep93xx_dma_data_to_trans_dir,
    to safely map between the two types because they are not 1 to 1 in
    meaning.

    lightnvm: pblk: fix race condition on metadata I/O
    
    [ Upstream commit d8adaa3b86324c6186d0adf74bc256bdacfffdb6 ]
    
    In pblk, when a new line is allocated, metadata for the previously
    written line is scheduled. This is done through a fixed memory region
    that is shared through time and contexts across different lines and
    therefore protected by a lock. Unfortunately, this lock is not properly
    covering all the metadata used for sharing this memory regions,
    resulting in a race condition.
    
    This patch fixes this race condition by protecting this metadata
    properly.

    lightnvm: pblk: fix race on sysfs line state
    
    [ Upstream commit 44cdbdc657b23f75736eca3e88b781f009104363 ]
    
    pblk exposes a sysfs interface that represents its internal state. Part
    of this state is the map bitmap for the current open line, which should
    be protected by the line lock to avoid a race when freeing the line
    metadata. Currently, it is not.
    
    This patch makes sure that the line state is consistent and NULL
    bitmap pointers are not dereferenced.

    hwmon: (pwm-fan) Set fan speed to 0 on suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 95dcd64bc5a27080beaa344edfe5bdcca3d2e7dc ]
    
    Technically this is not required because disabling the PWM should be
    enough. However, when support for atomic operations was implemented in
    the PWM subsystem, only actual changes to the PWM channel are applied
    during pwm_config(), which means that during after resume from suspend
    the old settings won't be applied.
    
    One possible solution is for the PWM driver to implement its own PM
    operations such that settings from before suspend get applied on resume.
    This has the disadvantage of completely ignoring any particular ordering
    requirements that PWM user drivers might have, so it is best to leave it
    up to the user drivers to apply the settings that they want at the
    appropriate time.
    
    Another way to solve this would be to read back the current state of the
    PWM at the time of resume. That way, in case the configuration was lost
    during suspend, applying the old settings in PWM user drivers would
    actually get them applied because they differ from the current settings.
    However, not all PWM drivers support reading the hardware state, and not
    all hardware may support it.
    
    The best workaround at this point seems to be to let PWM user drivers
    tell the PWM subsystem that the PWM is turned off by, in addition to
    disabling it, also setting the duty cycle to 0. This causes the resume
    operation to apply a configuration that is different from the current
    configuration, resulting in the proper state from before suspend getting
    restored.

    tun: Consistently configure generic netdev params via rtnetlink
    
    [ Upstream commit df52eab23d703142c766ac00bdb8db19d71238d0 ]
    
    Configuring generic network device parameters on tun will fail in
    presence of IFLA_INFO_KIND attribute in IFLA_LINKINFO nested attribute
    since tun_validate() always return failure.
    
    This can be visualized with following ip-link(8) command sequences:
    
      # ip link set dev tun0 group 100
      # ip link set dev tun0 group 100 type tun
      RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
    
    with contrast to dummy and veth drivers:
    
      # ip link set dev dummy0 group 100
      # ip link set dev dummy0 type dummy
    
      # ip link set dev veth0 group 100
      # ip link set dev veth0 group 100 type veth
    
    Fix by returning zero in tun_validate() when @data is NULL that is
    always in case since rtnl_link_ops->maxtype is zero in tun driver.

    nfp: devlink port split support for 1x100G CXP NIC
    
    [ Upstream commit 5948185b97fa1f83d7855e638a72982a1073ebf5 ]
    
    This commit makes it possible to use devlink to split the 100G CXP
    Netronome into two 40G interfaces. Currently when you ask for 2
    interfaces, the math in src/nfp_devlink.c:nfp_devlink_port_split
    calculates that you want 5 lanes per port because for some reason
    eth_port.port_lanes=10 (shouldn't this be 12 for CXP?). What we really
    want when asking for 2 breakout interfaces is 4 lanes per port. This
    commit makes that happen by calculating based on 8 lanes if 10 are
    present.

    arm64: cpufeature: ctr: Fix cpu capability check for late CPUs
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ab66cbe63aeaf9e5970fb4aaef1c660fca59321 ]
    
    The matches() routine for a capability must honor the "scope"
    passed to it and return the proper results.
    i.e, when passed with SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU, it should check the
    status of the capability on the current CPU. This is used by
    verify_local_cpu_capabilities() on a late secondary CPU to make
    sure that it's compliant with the established system features.
    However, ARM64_HAS_CACHE_{IDC/DIC} always checks the system wide
    registers and this could mean that a late secondary CPU could return
    "true" (since the CPU hasn't updated the system wide registers yet)
    and thus lead the system in an inconsistent state, where
    the system assumes it has IDC/DIC feature, while the new CPU
    doesn't.

    locking/lockdep: Fix debug_locks off performance problem
    
    [ Upstream commit 9506a7425b094d2f1d9c877ed5a78f416669269b ]
    
    It was found that when debug_locks was turned off because of a problem
    found by the lockdep code, the system performance could drop quite
    significantly when the lock_stat code was also configured into the
    kernel. For instance, parallel kernel build time on a 4-socket x86-64
    server nearly doubled.
    
    Further analysis into the cause of the slowdown traced back to the
    frequent call to debug_locks_off() from the __lock_acquired() function
    probably due to some inconsistent lockdep states with debug_locks
    off. The debug_locks_off() function did an unconditional atomic xchg
    to write a 0 value into debug_locks which had already been set to 0.
    This led to severe cacheline contention in the cacheline that held
    debug_locks.  As debug_locks is being referenced in quite a few different
    places in the kernel, this greatly slow down the system performance.
    
    To prevent that trashing of debug_locks cacheline, lock_acquired()
    and lock_contended() now checks the state of debug_locks before
    proceeding. The debug_locks_off() function is also modified to check
    debug_locks before calling __debug_locks_off().

    x86/numa_emulation: Fix uniform-split numa emulation
    
    commit c6ee7a548e2c291398b4f32c1f741c66b9f98e1c upstream.
    
    The numa_emulation() routine in the 'uniform' case walks through all the
    physical 'memblk' instances and divides them into N emulated nodes with
    split_nodes_size_interleave_uniform(). As each physical node is consumed it
    is removed from the physical memblk array in the numa_remove_memblk_from()
    helper.
    
    Since split_nodes_size_interleave_uniform() handles advancing the array as
    the 'memblk' is consumed it is expected that the base of the array is
    always specified as the argument.
    
    Otherwise, on multi-socket (> 2) configurations the uniform-split
    capability can generate an invalid numa configuration leading to boot
    failures with signatures like the following:

    x86/mm/pat: Disable preemption around __flush_tlb_all()
    
    commit f77084d96355f5fba8e2c1fb3a51a393b1570de7 upstream.
    
    The WARN_ON_ONCE(__read_cr3() != build_cr3()) in switch_mm_irqs_off()
    triggers every once in a while during a snapshotted system upgrade.
    
    The warning triggers since commit decab0888e6e ("x86/mm: Remove
    preempt_disable/enable() from __native_flush_tlb()"). The callchain is:
    
      get_page_from_freelist() -> post_alloc_hook() -> __kernel_map_pages()
    
    with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC enabled.
    
    Disable preemption during CR3 reset / __flush_tlb_all() and add a comment
    why preemption has to be disabled so it won't be removed accidentaly.
    
    Add another preemptible() check in __flush_tlb_all() to catch callers with
    enabled preemption when PGE is enabled, because PGE enabled does not
    trigger the warning in __native_flush_tlb(). Suggested by Andy Lutomirski.

    x86/corruption-check: Fix panic in memory_corruption_check() when boot option without value is provided
    
    commit ccde460b9ae5c2bd5e4742af0a7f623c2daad566 upstream.
    
    memory_corruption_check[{_period|_size}]()'s handlers do not check input
    argument before passing it to kstrtoul() or simple_strtoull(). The argument
    would be a NULL pointer if each of the kernel parameters, without its
    value, is set in command line and thus cause the following panic.

    The boot loader version reported via sysfs is wrong in case of the

    (0x020c), but it is reported to be 2.18 (0x0212).
    
    As the current way to set the version is error prone use the more
    readable variant (2 << 8) | 12.

    x86/speculation: Enable cross-hyperthread spectre v2 STIBP mitigation
    
    commit 53c613fe6349994f023245519265999eed75957f upstream.
    
    STIBP is a feature provided by certain Intel ucodes / CPUs. This feature
    (once enabled) prevents cross-hyperthread control of decisions made by
    indirect branch predictors.
    
    Enable this feature if
    
    - the CPU is vulnerable to spectre v2
    - the CPU supports SMT and has SMT siblings online
    - spectre_v2 mitigation autoselection is enabled (default)
    
    After some previous discussion, this leaves STIBP on all the time, as wrmsr
    on crossing kernel boundary is a no-no. This could perhaps later be a bit
    more optimized (like disabling it in NOHZ, experiment with disabling it in
    idle, etc) if needed.
    
    Note that the synchronization of the mask manipulation via newly added
    spec_ctrl_mutex is currently not strictly needed, as the only updater is
    already being serialized by cpu_add_remove_lock, but let's make this a
    little bit more future-proof.

    ALSA: hda - Fix incorrect clearance of thinkpad_acpi hooks
    
    commit 5e93a125f521efd00d71af31c2a301f3d46af48c upstream.
    
    Since the commit c647f806b8c2 ("ALSA: hda - Allow multiple ADCs for
    mic mute LED controls") we allow enabling the mic mute LED with
    multiple ADCs.  The commit changed the function return value to be
    zero or a negative error, while this change was overlooked in the
    thinkpad_acpi helper code where it still expects a positive return
    value for success.  This eventually leads to a NULL dereference on a
    system that has only a mic mute LED.
    
    This patch corrects the return value check in the corresponding code
    as well.

    ALSA: ca0106: Disable IZD on SB0570 DAC to fix audio pops
    
    commit ac237c28d5ac1b241d58b1b7b4b9fa10efb22fb5 upstream.
    
    The Creative Audigy SE (SB0570) card currently exhibits an audible pop
    whenever playback is stopped or resumed, or during silent periods of an
    audio stream. Initialise the IZD bit to the 0 to eliminate these pops.
    
    The Infinite Zero Detection (IZD) feature on the DAC causes the output
    to be shunted to Vcap after 2048 samples of silence. This discharges the
    AC coupling capacitor through the output and causes the aforementioned
    pop/click noise.
    
    The behaviour of the IZD bit is described on page 15 of the WM8768GEDS
    datasheet: "With IZD=1, applying MUTE for 1024 consecutive input samples
    will cause all outputs to be connected directly to VCAP. This also
    happens if 2048 consecutive zero input samples are applied to all 6
    channels, and IZD=0. It will be removed as soon as any channel receives
    a non-zero input". I believe the second sentence might be referring to
    IZD=1 instead of IZD=0 given the observed behaviour of the card.
    
    This change should make the DAC initialisation consistent with
    Creative's Windows driver, as this popping persists when initialising
    the card in Linux and soft rebooting into Windows, but is not present on
    a cold boot to Windows.

    parisc: Fix exported address of os_hpmc handler
    
    commit 99a3ae51d557d8e38a7aece65678a31f9db215ee upstream.
    
    In the C-code we need to put the physical address of the hpmc handler in
    the interrupt vector table (IVA) in order to get HPMCs working.  Since
    on parisc64 function pointers are indirect (in fact they are function
    descriptors) we instead export the address as variable and not as
    function.
    
    This reverts a small part of commit f39cce654f9a ("parisc: Add

    commit 3c229b3f2dd8133f61bb81d3cb018be92f4bba39 upstream.
    
    Fix a long-existing small nasty bug in the map_pages() implementation which
    leads to overwriting already written pte entries with zero, *if* map_pages() is
    called a second time with an end address which isn't aligned on a pmd boundry.
    This happens for example if we want to remap only the text segment read/write
    in order to run alternative patching on the code. Exiting the loop when we
    reach the end address fixes this.

    Location 40159038 should contain the physical address of os_hpmc:
    
    000000004015d000 <os_hpmc>:
        4015d000:   08 1a 02 43     copy r26,r3

        4015d008:   48 85 00 68     ldw 34(r4),r5
    
    This patch moves the address setup into initialize_ivt to resolve the
    above problem.  I tested the change by dumping the HPMC entry after setup:

      a19b2e3d7839 ("kprobes/x86: Remove IRQ disabling from ftrace-based/optimized kprobes”)
    
    removed local_irq_save/restore() from optimized_callback(), the handler
    might be interrupted by the rescheduling interrupt and might be
    rescheduled - so we must not use the preempt_enable_no_resched() macro.
    
    Use preempt_enable() instead, to not lose preemption events.

    acpi, nfit: Fix Address Range Scrub completion tracking
    
    commit d3abaf43bab8d5b0a3c6b982100d9e2be96de4ad upstream.
    
    The Address Range Scrub implementation tried to skip running scrubs
    against ranges that were already scrubbed by the BIOS. Unfortunately
    that support also resulted in early scrub completions as evidenced by
    this debug output from nfit_test:
    
        nd_region region9: ARS: range 1 short complete
        nd_region region3: ARS: range 1 short complete
        nd_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start (0)
        nd_region region4: ARS: range 2 short complete
    
    ...i.e. completions without any indications that the scrub was started.
    
    This state of affairs was hard to see in the code due to the
    proliferation of state bits and mistakenly trying to track done state
    per-range when the completion is a global property of the bus.
    
    So, kill the four ARS state bits (ARS_REQ, ARS_REQ_REDO, ARS_DONE, and
    ARS_SHORT), and replace them with just 2 request flags ARS_REQ_SHORT and
    ARS_REQ_LONG. The implementation will still complete and reap the
    results of BIOS initiated ARS, but it will not attempt to use that
    information to affect the completion status of scrubbing the ranges from
    a Linux perspective.
    
    Instead, try to synchronously run a short ARS per range at init time and
    schedule a long scrub in the background. If ARS is busy with an ARS
    request, schedule both a short and a long scrub for when ARS returns to
    idle. This logic also satisfies the intent of what ARS_REQ_REDO was
    trying to achieve. The new rule is that the REQ flag stays set until the
    next successful ars_start() for that range.
    
    With the new policy that the REQ flags are not cleared until the next
    start, the implementation no longer loses requests as can be seen from
    the following log:
    
        nd_region region3: ARS: range 1 ARS start short (0)
        nd_region region9: ARS: range 1 ARS start short (0)
        nd_region region3: ARS: range 1 complete
        nd_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start short (0)
        nd_region region9: ARS: range 1 complete
        nd_region region9: ARS: range 1 ARS start long (0)
        nd_region region4: ARS: range 2 complete
        nd_region region3: ARS: range 1 ARS start long (0)
        nd_region region9: ARS: range 1 complete
        nd_region region3: ARS: range 1 complete
        nd_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start long (0)
        nd_region region4: ARS: range 2 complete
    
    ...note that the nfit_test emulated driver provides 2 buses, that is why
    some of the range indices are duplicated. Notice that each range
    now successfully completes a short and long scrub.

    ACPICA: AML Parser: fix parse loop to correctly skip erroneous extended opcodes
    
    commit c64baa3a6fa207d112706bc5e7fd645cd8a8663f upstream.
    
    AML opcodes come in two lengths: 1-byte opcodes and 2-byte, extended opcodes.
    If an error occurs due to illegal opcodes during table load, the AML parser
    needs to continue loading the table. In order to do this, it needs to skip
    parsing of the offending opcode and operands associated with that opcode.
    
    This change fixes the AML parse loop to correctly skip parsing of incorrect
    extended opcodes. Previously, only the short opcodes were skipped correctly.

    ACPICA: AML interpreter: add region addresses in global list during initialization
    
    commit 4abb951b73ff0a8a979113ef185651aa3c8da19b upstream.
    
    The table load process omitted adding the operation region address
    range to the global list. This omission is problematic because the OS
    queries the global list to check for address range conflicts before
    deciding which drivers to load. This commit may result in warning
    messages that look like the following:
    
    [    7.871761] ACPI Warning: system_IO range 0x00000428-0x0000042F conflicts with op_region 0x00000400-0x0000047F (\PMIO) (20180531/utaddress-213)
    [    7.871769] ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it instead of the native driver
    
    However, these messages do not signify regressions. It is a result of
    properly adding address ranges within the global address list.

    been suspended, use the jiffies counter instead of ktime_get(). This

    pcmcia: Implement CLKRUN protocol disabling for Ricoh bridges
    
    commit 95691e3eddc41da2d1cd3cca51fecdfb46bd85bc upstream.
    
    Currently, "disable_clkrun" yenta_socket module parameter is only
    implemented for TI CardBus bridges.
    Add also an implementation for Ricoh bridges that have the necessary
    setting documented in publicly available datasheets.
    
    Tested on a RL5C476II with a Sunrich C-160 CardBus NIC that doesn't work
    correctly unless the CLKRUN protocol is disabled.
    
    Let's also make it clear in its description that the "disable_clkrun"
    module parameter only works on these two previously mentioned brands of
    CardBus bridges.

    dma-mapping: fix panic caused by passing empty cma command line argument
    
    commit a3ceed87b07769fb80ce9dc6b604e515dba14c4b upstream.
    
    early_cma does not check input argument before passing it to
    simple_strtoull. The argument would be a NULL pointer if "cma", without
    its value, is set in command line and thus causes the following panic.

    cpufreq: conservative: Take limits changes into account properly
    
    commit da5e79bc70b84971d2b3a55fb252e34e51d81d48 upstream.
    
    If the policy limits change between invocations of cs_dbs_update(),
    the requested frequency value stored in dbs_info may not be updated
    and the function may use a stale value of it next time.  Moreover, if
    idle periods are takem into account by cs_dbs_update(), the requested
    frequency value stored in dbs_info may be below the min policy limit,
    which is incorrect.
    
    To fix these problems, always update the requested frequency value
    in dbs_info along with the local copy of it when the previous
    requested frequency is beyond the policy limits and avoid decreasing
    the requested frequency below the min policy limit when taking
    idle periods into account.

    Protect the ISA bounce setup with a mutex, since it's

    hwmon: (pmbus) Fix page count auto-detection.
    
    commit e7c6a55606b5c46b449d76588968b4d8caae903f upstream.
    
    Devices with compatible="pmbus" field have zero initial page count,
    and pmbus_clear_faults() being called before the page count auto-
    detection does not actually clear faults because it depends on the
    page count. Non-cleared faults in its turn may fail the subsequent
    page count auto-detection.
    
    This patch fixes this problem by calling pmbus_clear_fault_page()
    for currently set page and calling pmbus_clear_faults() after the
    page count was detected.

    bcache: fix miss key refill->end in writeback
    
    commit 2d6cb6edd2c7fb4f40998895bda45006281b1ac5 upstream.
    
    refill->end record the last key of writeback, for example, at the first
    time, keys (1,128K) to (1,1024K) are flush to the backend device, but
    the end key (1,1024K) is not included, since the bellow code:
            if (bkey_cmp(k, refill->end) >= 0) {
                    ret = MAP_DONE;
                    goto out;
            }
    And in the next time when we refill writeback keybuf again, we searched
    key start from (1,1024K), and got a key bigger than it, so the key
    (1,1024K) missed.
    This patch modify the above code, and let the end key to be included to
    the writeback key buffer.

    spi: bcm-qspi: switch back to reading flash using smaller chunks
    
    commit 940ec770c295682993d1cccce3081fd7c74fece8 upstream.
    
    Fixing/optimizing bcm_qspi_bspi_read() performance introduced two
    changes:
    1) It added a loop to read all requested data using multiple BSPI ops.
    2) It bumped max size of a single BSPI block request from 256 to 512 B.
    
    The later change resulted in occasional BSPI timeouts causing a
    regression.
    
    For some unknown reason hardware doesn't always handle reads as expected
    when using 512 B chunks. In such cases it may happen that BSPI returns
    amount of requested bytes without the last 1-3 ones. It provides the
    remaining bytes later but doesn't raise an interrupt until another LR
    start.
    
    Switching back to 256 B reads fixes that problem and regression.

    ID to the driver list of supported devices.

    mtd: spi-nor: fsl-quadspi: fix read error for flash size larger than 16MB
    
    commit 41fe242979e463d6ad251077ded01b825a330b7e upstream.
    
    If the size of spi-nor flash is larger than 16MB, the read_opcode
    is set to SPINOR_OP_READ_1_1_4_4B, and fsl_qspi_get_seqid() will
    return -EINVAL when cmd is SPINOR_OP_READ_1_1_4_4B. This can
    cause read operation fail.

    commit 6c925b333368cda4e1b0513b07f72316c0e7edd7 upstream.
    
    We should only iomap the area of the chip that is memory mapped.
    Otherwise we could be mapping devices beyond the memory space or that
    belong to other devices.

    mtd: rawnand: marvell: fix the IRQ handler complete() condition
    
    commit 53c83b59759c1ee213f5ffa194909daee8902a28 upstream.
    
    With the current implementation, the complete() in the IRQ handler is
    supposed to be called only if the register status has one or the other
    RDY bit set. Other events might trigger an interrupt as well if
    enabled, but should not end-up with a complete() call.
    
    For this purpose, the code was checking if the other bits were set, in
    this case complete() was not called. This is wrong as two events might
    happen in a very tight time-frame and if the NDSR status read reports
    two bits set (eg. RDY(0) and RDDREQ) at the same time, complete() was
    not called.
    
    This logic would lead to timeouts in marvell_nfc_wait_op() and has
    been observed on PXA boards (NFCv1) in the Hamming write path.

    gpio: mxs: Get rid of external API call
    
    [ Upstream commit 833eacc7b5913da9896bacd30db7d490aa777868 ]
    
    The MXS driver was calling back into the GPIO API from
    its irqchip. This is not very elegant, as we are a driver,
    let's just shortcut back into the gpio_chip .get() function
    instead.
    
    This is a tricky case since the .get() callback is not in
    this file, instead assigned by bgpio_init(). Calling the
    function direcly in the gpio_chip is however the lesser
    evil.

    MIPS: VDSO: Reduce VDSO_RANDOMIZE_SIZE to 64MB for 64bit
    
    [ Upstream commit c61c7def1fa0a722610d89790e0255b74f3c07dd ]
    
    Commit ea7e0480a4b6 ("MIPS: VDSO: Always map near top of user memory")
    set VDSO_RANDOMIZE_SIZE to 256MB for 64bit kernel. But take a look at
    arch/mips/mm/mmap.c we can see that MIN_GAP is 128MB, which means the
    mmap_base may be at (user_address_top - 128MB). This make the stack be
    surrounded by mmaped areas, then stack expanding fails and causes a
    segmentation fault. Therefore, VDSO_RANDOMIZE_SIZE should be less than
    MIN_GAP and this patch reduce it to 64MB.

    bpf: fix partial copy of map_ptr when dst is scalar
    
    commit 0962590e553331db2cc0aef2dc35c57f6300dbbe upstream.
    
    ALU operations on pointers such as scalar_reg += map_value_ptr are
    handled in adjust_ptr_min_max_vals(). Problem is however that map_ptr
    and range in the register state share a union, so transferring state
    through dst_reg->range = ptr_reg->range is just buggy as any new
    map_ptr in the dst_reg is then truncated (or null) for subsequent
    checks. Fix this by adding a raw member and use it for copying state
    over to dst_reg.
