    pinctrl: baytrail: Use raw_spinlock for locking
    
    commit 78e1c896932df5b8bcdff7bf5417d8e72a4d0d6b upstream.
    
    The Intel Baytrail pinctrl driver implements irqchip callbacks which are
    called with desc->lock raw_spinlock held. In mainline this is fine because
    spinlock resolves to raw_spinlock. However, running the same code in -rt we
    get:
    
     BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rtmutex.c:917
     in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, pid: 0, name: swapper/0
     Preemption disabled at:[<ffffffff81092e9f>] cpu_startup_entry+0x17f/0x480

      ...
    
    This is because in -rt spinlocks are preemptible so taking the driver
    private spinlock in irqchip callbacks causes might_sleep() to trigger.
    
    In order to keep -rt happy but at the same time make sure that register
    accesses get serialized, convert the driver to use raw_spinlock instead.
    
    Also shorten the critical section a bit in few places.

    pinctrl: baytrail: Serialize all register access
    
    commit 39ce8150a079e3ae6ed9abf26d7918a558ef7c19 upstream.
    
    There is a hardware issue in Intel Baytrail where concurrent GPIO register
    access might result reads of 0xffffffff and writes might get dropped
    completely.
    
    Prevent this from happening by taking the serializing lock in all places
    where it is possible that more than one thread might be accessing the
    hardware concurrently.

    thp: use is_zero_pfn() only after pte_present() check
    
    commit 47aee4d8e314384807e98b67ade07f6da476aa75 upstream.
    
    Use is_zero_pfn() on pteval only after pte_present() check on pteval
    (It might be better idea to introduce is_zero_pte() which checks
    pte_present() first).
    
    Otherwise when working on a swap or migration entry and if pte_pfn's
    result is equal to zero_pfn by chance, we lose user's data in
    __collapse_huge_page_copy().  So if you're unlucky, the application
    segfaults and finally you could see below message on exit:

    drm/vmwgfx: Fix up user_dmabuf refcounting
    
    commit 54c12bc374408faddbff75dbf1a6167c19af39c4 upstream.
    
    If user space calls unreference on a user_dmabuf it will typically
    kill the struct ttm_base_object member which is responsible for the
    user-space visibility. However the dmabuf part may still be alive and
    refcounted. In some situations, like for shared guest-backed surface
    referencing/opening, the driver may try to reference the
    struct ttm_base_object member again, causing an immediate kernel warning
    and a later kernel NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Fix this by always maintaining a reference on the struct
    ttm_base_object member, in situations where it might subsequently be
    referenced.

    NVMe: Fix memory leak on retried commands

    Resources are reallocated for requeued commands, so unmap and release
    the iod for the failed command.
    
    It's a pretty bad memory leak and causes a kernel hang if you remove a

    sched/deadline: Fix migration of SCHED_DEADLINE tasks
    
    commit 5aa5050787f449e7eaef2c5ec93c7b357aa7dcdc upstream.
    
    Commit:
    
      9d5142624256 ("sched/deadline: Reduce rq lock contention by eliminating locking of non-feasible target")
    
    broke select_task_rq_dl() and find_lock_later_rq(), because it introduced
    a comparison between the local task's deadline and dl.earliest_dl.curr of
    the remote queue.
    
    However, if the remote runqueue does not contain any SCHED_DEADLINE
    task its earliest_dl.curr is 0 (always smaller than the deadline of
    the local task) and the remote runqueue is not selected for pushing.
    
    As a result, if an application creates multiple SCHED_DEADLINE
    threads, they will never be pushed to runqueues that do not already
    contain SCHED_DEADLINE tasks.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by checking if dl.dl_nr_running == 0.

    netfilter: ipset: Fix sleeping memory allocation in atomic context
    
    commit 00db674bedd68ff8b5afae9030ff5e04d45d1b4a upstream.
    
    Commit 00590fdd5be0 introduced RCU locking in list type and in
    doing so introduced a memory allocation in list_set_add, which
    is done in an atomic context, due to the fact that ipset rcu
    list modifications are serialised with a spin lock. The reason
    why we can't use a mutex is that in addition to modifying the
    list with ipset commands, it's also being modified when a
    particular ipset rule timeout expires aka garbage collection.
    This gc is triggered from set_cleanup_entries, which in turn
    is invoked from a timer thus requiring the lock to be bh-safe.
    
    Concretely the following call chain can lead to "sleeping function
    called in atomic context" splat:
    call_ad -> list_set_uadt -> list_set_uadd -> kzalloc(, GFP_KERNEL).
    And since GFP_KERNEL allows initiating direct reclaim thus
    potentially sleeping in the allocation path.
    
    To fix the issue change the allocation type to GFP_ATOMIC, to
    correctly reflect that it is occuring in an atomic context.

    The LIC doesn't deal with the different types of interrupts itself
    but needs to forward calls to set the appropriate type to its parent
    IRQ controller.
    
    Without this fix all IRQs routed through the LIC will stay at the
    initial EDGE type, while most of them should actually be level triggered.

    EDAC, sb_edac: Fix TAD presence check for sbridge_mci_bind_devs()
    
    commit 2900ea609616c2651dec65312beeb2a6e536bc50 upstream.
    
    In commit
    
      7d375bffa524 ("sb_edac: Fix support for systems with two home agents per socket")
    
    NUM_CHANNELS was changed to 8 and the channel space was renumerated to
    handle EN, EP, and EX configurations.
    
    The *_mci_bind_devs() functions - except for sbridge_mci_bind_devs() -
    got a new device presence check in the form of saw_chan_mask. However,
    sbridge_mci_bind_devs() still uses the NUM_CHANNELS for loop.
    
    With the increase in NUM_CHANNELS, this loop fails at index 4 since
    SB only has 4 TADs.  This results in the following error on SB machines:
    
      EDAC sbridge: Some needed devices are missing
      EDAC sbridge: Couldn't find mci handler
      EDAC sbridge: Couldn't find mci handle
    
    This patch adapts the saw_chan_mask logic for sbridge_mci_bind_devs() as
    well.
    
    After this patch:

    Revert "md: allow a partially recovered device to be hot-added to an array."
    
    commit d01552a76d71f9879af448e9142389ee9be6e95b upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 7eb418851f3278de67126ea0c427641ab4792c57.
    
    This commit is poorly justified, I can find not discusison in email,
    and it clearly causes a problem.
    
    If a device which is being recovered fails and is subsequently
    re-added to an array, there could easily have been changes to the
    array *before* the point where the recovery was up to.  So the
    recovery must start again from the beginning.
    
    If a spare is being recovered and fails, then when it is re-added we
    really should do a bitmap-based recovery up to the recovery-offset,
    and then a full recovery from there.  Before this reversion, we only
    did the "full recovery from there" which is not corect.  After this
    reversion with will do a full recovery from the start, which is safer
    but not ideal.
    
    It will be left to a future patch to arrange the two different styles
    of recovery.

    md/raid5: fix locking in handle_stripe_clean_event()
    
    commit b8a9d66d043ffac116100775a469f05f5158c16f upstream.
    
    After commit 566c09c53455 ("raid5: relieve lock contention in get_active_stripe()")
    __find_stripe() is called under conf->hash_locks + hash.
    But handle_stripe_clean_event() calls remove_hash() under
    conf->device_lock.
    
    Under some cirscumstances the hash chain can be circuited,
    and we get an infinite loop with disabled interrupts and locked hash
    lock in __find_stripe(). This leads to hard lockup on multiple CPUs
    and following system crash.
    
    I was able to reproduce this behavior on raid6 over 6 ssd disks.
    The devices_handle_discard_safely option should be set to enable trim
    support. The following script was used:
    
    for i in `seq 1 32`; do
        dd if=/dev/zero of=large$i bs=10M count=100 &
    done
    
    neilb: original was against a 3.x kernel.  I forward-ported
      to 4.3-rc.  This verison is suitable for any kernel since

    crypto: api - Only abort operations on fatal signal
    
    commit 3fc89adb9fa4beff31374a4bf50b3d099d88ae83 upstream.
    
    Currently a number of Crypto API operations may fail when a signal
    occurs.  This causes nasty problems as the caller of those operations
    are often not in a good position to restart the operation.
    
    In fact there is currently no need for those operations to be
    interrupted by user signals at all.  All we need is for them to
    be killable.
    
    This patch replaces the relevant calls of signal_pending with
    fatal_signal_pending, and wait_for_completion_interruptible with
    wait_for_completion_killable, respectively.

    Input: alps - only the Dell Latitude D420/430/620/630 have separate stick button bits
    
    commit 195562194aad3a0a3915941077f283bcc6347b9b upstream.
    
    commit 92bac83dd79e ("Input: alps - non interleaved V2 dualpoint has
    separate stick button bits") assumes that all alps v2 non-interleaved
    dual point setups have the separate stick button bits.
    
    Later we limited this to Dell laptops only because of reports that this
    broke things on non Dell laptops. Now it turns out that this breaks things
    on the Dell Latitude D600 too. So it seems that only the Dell Latitude
    D420/430/620/630, which all share the same touchpad / stick combo,
    have these separate bits.
    
    This patch limits the checking of the separate bits to only these models
    fixing regressions with other models.

    ovl: fix open in stacked overlay

    If two overlayfs filesystems are stacked on top of each other, then we need
    recursion in ovl_d_select_inode().
    
    I guess d_backing_inode() is supposed to do that.  But currently it doesn't
    and that functionality is open coded in vfs_open().  This is now copied
    into ovl_d_select_inode() to fix this regression.

    ovl: fix dentry reference leak
    
    commit ab79efab0a0ba01a74df782eb7fa44b044dae8b5 upstream.
    
    In ovl_copy_up_locked(), newdentry is leaked if the function exits through
    out_cleanup as this just to out after calling ovl_cleanup() - which doesn't
    actually release the ref on newdentry.
    
    The out_cleanup segment should instead exit through out2 as certainly
    newdentry leaks - and possibly upper does also, though this isn't caught
    given the catch of newdentry.
    
    Without this fix, something like the following is seen:
    
            BUG: Dentry ffff880023e9eb20{i=f861,n=#ffff880023e82d90} still in use (1) [unmount of tmpfs tmpfs]
            BUG: Dentry ffff880023ece640{i=0,n=bigfile}  still in use (1) [unmount of tmpfs tmpfs]
    
    when unmounting the upper layer after an error occurred in copyup.
    
    An error can be induced by creating a big file in a lower layer with
    something like:
    
            dd if=/dev/zero of=/lower/a/bigfile bs=65536 count=1 seek=$((0xf000))
    
    to create a large file (4.1G).  Overlay an upper layer that is too small
    (on tmpfs might do) and then induce a copy up by opening it writably.

    Pass O_LARGEFILE unconditionally in ovl_copy_up_data() as it's purely for
    catching 32-bit userspace dealing with a file large enough that it'll be

    because it holds a reference to the module it wants to find, which
    therefore cannot go away.
    
    This is wrong (and a false optimization too, preempt_disable() is really
    rather cheap, and I doubt any of this is on uber critical paths,
    otherwise it would've retained a pointer to the actual module anyway and
    avoided the second lookup).
    
    While its true that the module cannot go away while we hold a reference
    on it, the data structure we do the lookup in very much _CAN_ change
    while we do the lookup. Therefore fix the comment and add the
    required preempt_disable().

    xhci: Add spurious wakeup quirk for LynxPoint-LP controllers
    
    commit fd7cd061adcf5f7503515ba52b6a724642a839c8 upstream.
    
    We received several reports of systems rebooting and powering on
    after an attempted shutdown. Testing showed that setting
    XHCI_SPURIOUS_WAKEUP quirk in addition to the XHCI_SPURIOUS_REBOOT
    quirk allowed the system to shutdown as expected for LynxPoint-LP
    xHCI controllers. Set the quirk back.
    
    Note that the quirk was originally introduced for LynxPoint and
    LynxPoint-LP just for this same reason. See:
    
    commit 638298dc66ea ("xhci: Fix spurious wakeups after S5 on Haswell")
    
    It was later limited to only concern HP machines as it caused
    regression on some machines, see both bug and commit:
    
    Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66171
    commit 6962d914f317 ("xhci: Limit the spurious wakeup fix only to HP machines")
    
    Later it was discovered that the powering on after shutdown
    was limited to LynxPoint-LP (Haswell-ULT) and that some non-LP HP
    machine suffered from spontaneous resume from S3 (which should
    not be related to the SPURIOUS_WAKEUP quirk at all). An attempt
    to fix this then removed the SPURIOUS_WAKEUP flag usage completely.
    
    commit b45abacde3d5 ("xhci: no switching back on non-ULT Haswell")
    
    Current understanding is that LynxPoint-LP (Haswell ULT) machines
    need the SPURIOUS_WAKEUP quirk, otherwise they will restart, and
    plain Lynxpoint (Haswell) machines may _not_ have the quirk
    set otherwise they again will restart.

    i2c: mv64xxx: really allow I2C offloading
    
    commit 0729a04977d497cf66234fd7f900ddcec3ef1c52 upstream.
    
    Commit 00d8689b85a7 ("i2c: mv64xxx: rework offload support to fix

    debugging-related "return false" at the beginning of the
    mv64xxx_i2c_can_offload() function. This has the unfortunate consequence
    that offloading is in fact never used, which wasn't really the
    intention.
    
    This commit fixes that problem by removing the bogus "return false".

    nvme: fix 32-bit build warning
    
    commit 835da3f99d329b1160a1f7fc82c7ac81163d63d0 upstream.
    
    Compiling the nvme driver on 32-bit warns about a cast from a __u64
    variable to a pointer:
    
    drivers/block/nvme-core.c: In function 'nvme_submit_io':
    drivers/block/nvme-core.c:1847:4: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
        (void __user *)io.addr, length, NULL, 0);
    
    The cast here is intentional and safe, so we can shut up the
    gcc warning by adding an intermediate cast to 'uintptr_t'.
    
    I had previously submitted a patch to fix this problem in the
    nvme driver, but it was accepted on the same day that two new
    warnings got added.
    
    For clarification, I also change the third instance of this cast
    to use uintptr_t instead of unsigned long now.

    dm cache: the CLEAN_SHUTDOWN flag was not being set
    
    commit 3201ac452e84a8a368197d648c9b7011e061804a upstream.
    
    If the CLEAN_SHUTDOWN flag is not set when a cache is loaded then all cache
    blocks are marked as dirty and a full writeback occurs.
    
    __commit_transaction() is responsible for setting/clearing
    CLEAN_SHUTDOWN (based the flags_mutator that is passed in).
    
    Fix this issue, of the cache's on-disk flags being wrong, by making sure
    __commit_transaction() does not reset the flags after the mutator has
    altered the flags in preparation for them being serialized to disk.
    
    before:
    
    sb_flags = mutator(le32_to_cpu(disk_super->flags));
    disk_super->flags = cpu_to_le32(sb_flags);
    disk_super->flags = cpu_to_le32(cmd->flags);
    
    after:
    
    disk_super->flags = cpu_to_le32(cmd->flags);

    commit 2871c69e025e8bc507651d5a9cf81a8a7da9d24b upstream.
    
    Commit 4c7e309340ff ("dm btree remove: fix bug in redistribute3") wasn't

    The redistribute3 function takes 3 btree nodes and shares out the entries
    evenly between them.  If the three nodes in total contained
    (MAX_ENTRIES * 3) - 1 entries between them then this was erroneously getting
    rebalanced as (MAX_ENTRIES - 1) on the left and right, and (MAX_ENTRIES + 1) in
    the center.
    
    Fix this issue by being more careful about calculating the target number
    of entries for the left and right nodes.

    block: don't release bdi while request_queue has live references
    
    commit b02176f30cd30acccd3b633ab7d9aed8b5da52ff upstream.
    
    bdi's are initialized in two steps, bdi_init() and bdi_register(), but
    destroyed in a single step by bdi_destroy() which, for a bdi embedded
    in a request_queue, is called during blk_cleanup_queue() which makes
    the queue invisible and starts the draining of remaining usages.
    
    A request_queue's user can access the congestion state of the embedded
    bdi as long as it holds a reference to the queue.  As such, it may
    access the congested state of a queue which finished
    blk_cleanup_queue() but hasn't reached blk_release_queue() yet.
    Because the congested state was embedded in backing_dev_info which in
    turn is embedded in request_queue, accessing the congested state after
    bdi_destroy() was called was fine.  The bdi was destroyed but the
    memory region for the congested state remained accessible till the
    queue got released.
    
    a13f35e87140 ("writeback: don't embed root bdi_writeback_congested in
    bdi_writeback") changed the situation.  Now, the root congested state
    which is expected to be pinned while request_queue remains accessible
    is separately reference counted and the base ref is put during
    bdi_destroy().  This means that the root congested state may go away
    prematurely while the queue is between bdi_dstroy() and
    blk_cleanup_queue(), which was detected by Andrey's KASAN tests.
    
    The root cause of this problem is that bdi doesn't distinguish the two
    steps of destruction, unregistration and release, and now the root
    congested state actually requires a separate release step.  To fix the
    issue, this patch separates out bdi_unregister() and bdi_exit() from
    bdi_destroy().  bdi_unregister() is called from blk_cleanup_queue()
    and bdi_exit() from blk_release_queue().  bdi_destroy() is now just a
    simple wrapper calling the two steps back-to-back.
    
    While at it, the prototype of bdi_destroy() is moved right below
    bdi_setup_and_register() so that the counterpart operations are
    located together.

    arm64: kernel: fix tcr_el1.t0sz restore on systems with extended idmap
    
    commit e13d918a19a7b6cba62b32884f5e336e764c2cc6 upstream.
    
    Commit dd006da21646 ("arm64: mm: increase VA range of identity map")
    introduced a mechanism to extend the virtual memory map range
    to support arm64 systems with system RAM located at very high offset,
    where the identity mapping used to enable/disable the MMU requires
    additional translation levels to map the physical memory at an equal
    virtual offset.
    
    The kernel detects at boot time the tcr_el1.t0sz value required by the
    identity mapping and sets-up the tcr_el1.t0sz register field accordingly,
    any time the identity map is required in the kernel (ie when enabling the
    MMU).
    
    After enabling the MMU, in the cold boot path the kernel resets the
    tcr_el1.t0sz to its default value (ie the actual configuration value for
    the system virtual address space) so that after enabling the MMU the
    memory space translated by ttbr0_el1 is restored as expected.
    
    Commit dd006da21646 ("arm64: mm: increase VA range of identity map")
    also added code to set-up the tcr_el1.t0sz value when the kernel resumes
    from low-power states with the MMU off through cpu_resume() in order to
    effectively use the identity mapping to enable the MMU but failed to add
    the code required to restore the tcr_el1.t0sz to its default value, when
    the core returns to the kernel with the MMU enabled, so that the kernel
    might end up running with tcr_el1.t0sz value set-up for the identity
    mapping which can be lower than the value required by the actual virtual
    address space, resulting in an erroneous set-up.
    
    This patchs adds code in the resume path that restores the tcr_el1.t0sz
    default value upon core resume, mirroring this way the cold boot path
    behaviour therefore fixing the issue.

    commit 9702970c7bd3e2d6fecb642a190269131d4ac16c upstream.
    
    This reverts commit e306dfd06fcb44d21c80acb8e5a88d55f3d1cf63.
    
    With this patch applied, we were the only architecture making this sort
    of adjustment to the PC calculation in the unwinder. This causes
    problems for ftrace, where the PC values are matched against the
    contents of the stack frames in the callchain and fail to match any
    records after the address adjustment.
    
    Whilst there has been some effort to change ftrace to workaround this,
    those patches are not yet ready for mainline and, since we're the odd
    architecture in this regard, let's just step in line with other
    architectures (like arch/arm/) for now.

    ARM: 8445/1: fix vdsomunge not to depend on glibc specific byteswap.h
    
    commit 8a603f91cc4848ab1a0458bc065aa9f64322e123 upstream.
    
    If the host toolchain is not glibc based then the arm kernel build
    fails with
    
      HOSTCC  arch/arm/vdso/vdsomunge
      arch/arm/vdso/vdsomunge.c:48:22: fatal error: byteswap.h: No such file or directory
    
    Observed: with omap2plus_defconfig and compile on Mac OS X with arm ELF
    cross-compiler.
    
    Reason: byteswap.h is a glibc only header.
    
    Solution: replace by private byte-swapping macros (taken from
    arch/mips/boot/elf2ecoff.c and kindly improved by Russell King)
    
    Tested to compile on Mac OS X 10.9.5 host.

    ARM: dts: am57xx-beagle-x15: set VDD_SD to always-on
    
    commit 7e381ec6a36aa44f15fc1a76e6efb9e2cd942e61 upstream.
    
    LDO1 regulator (VDD_SD) is connected to SoC's vddshv8. vddshv8 needs to
    be kept always powered (see commit 5a0f93c6576a ("ARM: dts: Add
    am57xx-beagle-x15"), but at the moment VDD_SD is enabled/disabled
    depending on whether an SD card is inserted or not.
    
    This patch sets LDO1 regulator to always-on.
    
    This patch has a side effect of fixing another issue, HDMI DDC not
    working when SD card is not inserted:
    
    Why this happens is that the tpd12s015 (HDMI level shifter/ESD
    protection chip) has LS_OE GPIO input, which needs to be enabled for the
    HDMI DDC to work. LS_OE comes from gpio6_28. The pin that provides
    gpio6_28 is powered by vddshv8, and vddshv8 comes from VDD_SD.
    
    So when SD card is not inserted, VDD_SD is disabled, and LS_OE stays
    off.
    
    The proper fix for the HDMI DDC issue would be to maybe have the pinctrl
    framework manage the pin specific power.
    
    Apparently this fixes also a third issue (copy paste from Kishon's
    patch):
    
    ldo1_reg in addition to being connected to the io lines is also
    connected to the card detect line. On card removal, omap_hsmmc
    driver does a regulator_disable causing card detect line to be
    pulled down. This raises a card insertion interrupt and once the
    MMC core detects there is no card inserted, it does a
    regulator disable which again raises a card insertion interrupt.
    This happens in a loop causing infinite MMC interrupts.

    rbd: prevent kernel stack blow up on rbd map
    
    commit 6d69bb536bac0d403d83db1ca841444981b280cd upstream.
    
    Mapping an image with a long parent chain (e.g. image foo, whose parent
    is bar, whose parent is baz, etc) currently leads to a kernel stack
    overflow, due to the following recursion in the reply path:
    
      rbd_osd_req_callback()
        rbd_obj_request_complete()
          rbd_img_obj_callback()
            rbd_img_parent_read_callback()
              rbd_obj_request_complete()
                ...
    
    Limit the parent chain to 16 images, which is ~5K worth of stack.  When
    the above recursion is eliminated, this limit can be lifted.

    rbd: don't leak parent_spec in rbd_dev_probe_parent()
    
    commit 1f2c6651f69c14d0d3a9cfbda44ea101b02160ba upstream.
    
    Currently we leak parent_spec and trigger a "parent reference
    underflow" warning if rbd_dev_create() in rbd_dev_probe_parent() fails.
    The problem is we take the !parent out_err branch and that only drops
    refcounts; parent_spec that would've been freed had we called
    rbd_dev_unparent() remains and triggers rbd_warn() in
    rbd_dev_parent_put() - at that point we have parent_spec != NULL and
    parent_ref == 0, so counter ends up being -1 after the decrement.
    
    Redo rbd_dev_probe_parent() to fix this.

    rbd: require stable pages if message data CRCs are enabled
    
    commit bae818ee1577c27356093901a0ea48f672eda514 upstream.
    
    rbd requires stable pages, as it performs a crc of the page data before
    they are send to the OSDs.
    
    But since kernel 3.9 (patch 1d1d1a767206fbe5d4c69493b7e6d2a8d08cc0a0
    "mm: only enforce stable page writes if the backing device requires
    it") it is not assumed anymore that block devices require stable pages.
    
    This patch sets the necessary flag to get stable pages back for rbd.
    
    In a ceph installation that provides multiple ext4 formatted rbd
    devices "bad crc" messages appeared regularly (ca 1 message every 1-2
    minutes on every OSD that provided the data for the rbd) in the
    OSD-logs before this patch. After this patch this messages are pretty
    much gone (only ca 1-2 / month / OSD).

    drm/i915: Deny wrapping an userptr into a framebuffer
    
    commit cc917ab43541db3ff66d0136042686d40a1b4c9a upstream.
    
    Pinning a userptr onto the hardware raises interesting questions about
    the lifetime of such a surface as the framebuffer extends that life
    beyond the client's address space. That is the hardware will need to
    keep scanning out from the backing storage even after the client wants
    to remap its address space. As the hardware pins the backing storage,
    the userptr becomes invalid and this raises a WARN when the clients
    tries to unmap its address space. The situation can be even more
    complicated when the buffer is passed between processes, between a
    client and display server, where the lifetime and hardware access is
    even more confusing. Deny it.

    drm/i915: Flush pipecontrol post-sync writes
    
    commit 40a24488f5250d63341e74b9994159afc4589606 upstream.
    
    In order to flush the results from in-batch pipecontrol writes (used for
    example in glQuery) before declaring the batch complete (and so declaring
    the query results coherent), we need to set the FlushEnable bit in our
    flushing pipecontrol. The FlushEnable bit "waits until all previous
    writes of immediate data from post-sync circles are complete before
    executing the next command".
    
    I get GPU hangs on byt without flushing these writes (running ue4).
    piglit has examples where the flush is required for correct rendering.

    drm/nouveau/gem: return only valid domain when there's only one
    
    commit 2a6c521bb41ce862e43db46f52e7681d33e8d771 upstream.
    
    On nv50+, we restrict the valid domains to just the one where the buffer
    was originally created. However after the buffer is evicted to system
    memory, we might move it back to a different domain that was not
    originally valid. When sharing the buffer and retrieving its GEM_INFO
    data, we still want the domain that will be valid for this buffer in a
    pushbuf, not the one where it currently happens to be.
    
    This resolves fdo#92504 and several others. These are due to suspend
    evicting all buffers, making it more likely that they temporarily end up
    in the wrong place.

    tracing: Have stack tracer force RCU to be watching
    
    commit a2d7629048322ae62bff57f34f5f995e25ed234c upstream.
    
    The stack tracer was triggering the WARN_ON() in module.c:
    
     static void module_assert_mutex_or_preempt(void)
     {
     #ifdef CONFIG_LOCKDEP
            if (unlikely(!debug_locks))
                    return;
    
            WARN_ON(!rcu_read_lock_sched_held() &&
                    !lockdep_is_held(&module_mutex));
     #endif
     }
    
    The reason is that the stack tracer traces all function calls, and some of
    those calls happen while exiting or entering user space and idle. Some of
    these functions are called after RCU had already stopped watching, as RCU
    does not watch userspace or idle CPUs.
    
    If a max stack is hit, then the save_stack_trace() is called, which will
    check module addresses and call module_assert_mutex_or_preempt(), and then
    trigger the warning. Sad part is, the warning itself will also do a stack
    trace and tigger the same warning. That probably should be fixed.
    
    The warning was added by 0be964be0d45 "module: Sanitize RCU usage and
    locking" but this bug has probably been around longer. But it's unlikely to
    cause much harm, but the new warning causes the system to lock up.

    mm: make sendfile(2) killable
    
    commit 296291cdd1629c308114504b850dc343eabc2782 upstream.
    
    Currently a simple program below issues a sendfile(2) system call which
    takes about 62 days to complete in my test KVM instance.
    
            int fd;
            off_t off = 0;
    
            fd = open("file", O_RDWR | O_TRUNC | O_SYNC | O_CREAT, 0644);
            ftruncate(fd, 2);
            lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);
            sendfile(fd, fd, &off, 0xfffffff);
    
    Now you should not ask kernel to do a stupid stuff like copying 256MB in
    2-byte chunks and call fsync(2) after each chunk but if you do, sysadmin
    should have a way to stop you.
    
    We actually do have a check for fatal_signal_pending() in
    generic_perform_write() which triggers in this path however because we
    always succeed in writing something before the check is done, we return
    value > 0 from generic_perform_write() and thus the information about
    signal gets lost.
    
    Fix the problem by doing the signal check before writing anything.  That
    way generic_perform_write() returns -EINTR, the error gets propagated up
    and the sendfile loop terminates early.

    x86/ioapic: Prevent NULL pointer dereference in setup_ioapic_dest()
    
    commit ababae44108b0e94b58eef6cb5bd830bd040a47f upstream.
    
    Commit 4857c91f0d19 changed the way how irq affinity is setup in
    setup_ioapic_dest() from using the core helper function to
    unconditionally calling the irq_set_affinity() callback of the
    underlying irq chip.
    
    That results in a NULL pointer dereference for the rare case where the
    underlying irq chip is lapic_chip which has no irq_set_affinity()
    callback. lapic_chip is occasionally used for the timer interrupt (irq
    0).
    
    The fix is simple: Check the availability of the callback instead of
    calling it unconditionally.

    x86/efi: Fix multiple GOP device support
    
    commit 8a53554e12e98d1759205afd7b8e9e2ea0936f48 upstream.
    
    When multiple GOP devices exists, but none of them implements
    ConOut, the code should just choose the first GOP (according to
    the comments). But currently 'fb_base' will refer to the last GOP,
    while other parameters to the first GOP, which will likely
    result in a garbled display.
    
    I can reliably reproduce this bug using my ASRock Z87M Extreme4
    motherboard with CSM and integrated GPU disabled, and two PCIe
    video cards (NVidia GT640 and GTX980), booting from efi-stub
    (booting from grub works fine).  On the primary display the
    ASRock logo remains and on the secondary screen it is garbled
    up completely.

    ASoC: Add info callback for SX_TLV controls
    
    commit 34198710f55b5f359f43e67d9a08fe5aadfbca1b upstream.
    
    SX_TLV controls are intended for situations where the register behind
    the control has some non-zero value indicating the minimum gain
    and then gains increasing from there and eventually overflowing through
    zero.
    
    Currently every CODEC implementing these controls specifies the minimum
    as the non-zero value for the minimum and the maximum as the number of
    gain settings available.
    
    This means when the info callback subtracts the minimum value from the
    maximum value to calculate the number of gain levels available it is
    actually under reporting the available levels. This patch fixes this
    issue by adding a new snd_soc_info_volsw_sx callback that does not
    subtract the minimum value.

    KVM: arm: use GIC support unconditionally
    
    commit 4a5d69b73948d0e03cd38d77dc11edb2e707165f upstream.
    
    The vgic code on ARM is built for all configurations that enable KVM,
    but the parent_data field that it references is only present when
    CONFIG_IRQ_DOMAIN_HIERARCHY is set:
    
    virt/kvm/arm/vgic.c: In function 'kvm_vgic_map_phys_irq':
    virt/kvm/arm/vgic.c:1781:13: error: 'struct irq_data' has no member named 'parent_data'
    
    This flag is implied by the GIC driver, and indeed the VGIC code only
    makes sense if a GIC is present. This changes the CONFIG_KVM symbol
    to always select GIC, which avoids the issue.

    rtl28xxu: fix control message flaws
    
    commit d18ca5b7ceca0e9674cb4bb2ed476b0fcbb23ba2 upstream.
    
    Add lock to prevent concurrent access for control message as control
    message function uses shared buffer. Without the lock there may be
    remote control polling which messes the buffer causing IO errors.
    Increase buffer size and add check for maximum supported message

    commit 30730c7f5943b3beace1e29f7f1476e05de3da14 upstream.
    
    In Linux 4.3-rc5, there is an error case in drm_dp_get_branch_device
    that returns without releasing mgr->lock, resulting a spew of kernel
    messages about a kernel work function possibly having leaked a mutex
    and presumably more serious adverse consequences later.  This patch
    changes the error to "goto out" to unlock the mutex before returning.

    powerpc/rtas: Validate rtas.entry before calling enter_rtas()

    iommu/vt-d: fix range computation when making room for large pages
    
    commit ba2374fd2bf379f933773811fdb06cb6a5445f41 upstream.
    
    In preparation for the installation of a large page, any small page
    tables that may still exist in the target IOV address range are
    removed.  However, if a scatter/gather list entry is large enough to
    fit more than one large page, the address space for any subsequent
    large pages is not cleared of conflicting small page tables.
    
    This can cause legitimate mapping requests to fail with errors of the
    form below, potentially followed by a series of IOMMU faults:
    
    ERROR: DMA PTE for vPFN 0xfde00 already set (to 7f83a4003 not 7e9e00083)
    
    In this example, a 4MiB scatter/gather list entry resulted in the
    successful installation of a large page @ vPFN 0xfdc00, followed by
    a failed attempt to install another large page @ vPFN 0xfde00, due to
    the presence of a pointer to a small page table @ 0x7f83a4000.
    
    To address this problem, compute the number of large pages that fit
    into a given scatter/gather list entry, and use it to derive the
    last vPFN covered by the large page(s).

    During the CT-kill exit flow, the card is powered up and partially
    initialized to check if the temperature is already low enough.
    Unfortunately the init bails early because the CT-kill flag is set.
    Make the code bail early only for HW RF-kill, as was intended by the

    The code to send the RX PN data (for each TID) to the firmware
    has a devastating bug: it overwrites the data for TID 0 with
    all the TID data, leaving the remaining TIDs zeroed. This will
    allow replays to actually be accepted by the firmware, which
    could allow waking up the system.

    and restored from the firmware respectively. The restore was broken
    due to my previous commit to move PN assignment into the driver.
    Sending the PN to the firmware still worked since we now use the
    counter that's shared with mac80211, but accessing it through the
    mac80211 API makes no sense now.
    
    Fix this by reading/writing the counter directly. This actually
    simplifies the code since we don't need to round-trip through the
    key_seq structure.

    iwlwifi: mvm: clear csa countdown when AP is stopped
    
    commit e9cb0327b26dd7ba43a3b7a05b4b62219decf42d upstream.
    
    The csa_countdown flag was not cleared when the AP is stopped.
    As a result, if the AP was stopped after csa_countdown had started,
    all the folowing channel switch commands would fail.
    Fix that by clearing the csa_countdown flag when the AP is stopped.

    rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix system lockups on boot
    
    commit 54328e64047a54b8fc2362c2e1f0fa16c90f739f upstream.
    
    In commit 1277fa2ab2f9 ("rtlwifi: Remove the clear interrupt routine from all
    drivers"), the code that cleared all interrupt enable bits before setting them
    was removed for all PCI drivers. This fixed an issue that caused TX to be
    blocked for 3-5 seconds. On some RTL8821AE units, this change causes soft
    lockups to occur on boot. For that reason, the portion of the earlier commit
    that applied to rtl8821ae is reverted. Kernels 4.1 and newer are affected.
    
    See http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=144373370103285&w=2 and
    https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=944978 for two cases where
    this regression affected user systems. Note that this bug does not appear on
    any of the developer's setups. For those users whose systems are affected
    by the TX blockage, but do not lock up on boot, a module parameter is added
    to disable the interrupt clear

    it's done in the device configuration struct instead of referencing
    IWL3160_UCODE_API_OK which doesn't even exist.

    iwlwifi: dvm: fix D3 firmware PN programming
    
    commit 5bd166872d8f99f156fac191299d24f828bb2348 upstream.
    
    The code to send the RX PN data (for each TID) to the firmware
    has a devastating bug: it overwrites the data for TID 0 with
    all the TID data, leaving the remaining TIDs zeroed. This will
    allow replays to actually be accepted by the firmware, which
    could allow waking up the system.

    mmc: core: Fix init_card in 52Mhz
    
    commit 08b137d90eec51b0e90c42e123ca8ceb118d233f upstream.
    
    Suppose that we got a data crc error, and it triggers the mmc_reset.
    mmc_reset will call mmc_send_status to see if HW reset was supported.
    before issue CMD13, it will do retune, and if EMMC was in HS400 mode,
    it will reduce frequency to 52Mhz firstly, then results in card init
    was doing at 52Mhz.
    The mmc_send_status was originally only done for mmc_test, should drop
    it. And, rename the "eMMC hardware reset" to "Reset test", as we would
    also be able to use the test for SD-cards.

    ath9k inserts padding between the 802.11 header and the data area (to
    align it). Since it didn't declare this extra required headroom, this
    led to some nasty issues like randomly dropped packets in some setups.
