    bcache: fix bch_hprint crash and improve output
    
    commit 9276717b9e297a62d1151a43d1cd286213f68eb7 upstream.
    
    Most importantly, solve a crash where %llu was used to format signed
    numbers.  This would cause a buffer overflow when reading sysfs
    writeback_rate_debug, as only 20 bytes were allocated for this and
    %llu writes 20 characters plus a null.
    
    Always use the units mechanism rather than having different output
    paths for simplicity.
    
    Also, correct problems with display output where 1.10 was a larger
    number than 1.09, by multiplying by 10 and then dividing by 1024 instead
    of dividing by 100.  (Remainders of >= 1000 would print as .10).
    
    Minor changes: Always display the decimal point instead of trying to
    omit it based on number of digits shown.  Decide what units to use
    based on 1000 as a threshold, not 1024 (in other words, always print
    at most 3 digits before the decimal point).

    bcache: Correct return value for sysfs attach errors
    
    commit 77fa100f27475d08a569b9d51c17722130f089e7 upstream.
    
    If you encounter any errors in bch_cached_dev_attach it will return
    a negative error code.  The variable 'v' which stores the result is
    unsigned, thus user space sees a very large value returned for bytes
    written which can cause incorrect user space behavior.  Utilize 1
    signed variable to use throughout the function to preserve error return
    capability.

    bcache: correct cache_dirty_target in __update_writeback_rate()
    
    commit a8394090a9129b40f9d90dcb7f4a49d60c727ca6 upstream.
    
    __update_write_rate() uses a Proportion-Differentiation Controller
    algorithm to control writeback rate. A dirty target number is used in
    this PD controller to control writeback rate. A larger target number
    will make the writeback rate smaller, on the versus, a smaller target
    number will make the writeback rate larger.
    
    bcache uses the following steps to calculate the target number,
    1) cache_sectors = all-buckets-of-cache-set * buckets-size
    2) cache_dirty_target = cache_sectors * cached-device-writeback_percent
    3) target = cache_dirty_target *
    (sectors-of-cached-device/sectors-of-all-cached-devices-of-this-cache-set)
    
    The calculation at step 1) for cache_sectors is incorrect, which does
    not consider dirty blocks occupied by flash only volume.
    
    A flash only volume can be took as a bcache device without cached
    device. All data sectors allocated for it are persistent on cache device
    and marked dirty, they are not touched by bcache writeback and garbage
    collection code. So data blocks of flash only volume should be ignore
    when calculating cache_sectors of cache set.
    
    Current code does not subtract dirty sectors of flash only volume, which
    results a larger target number from the above 3 steps. And in sequence
    the cache device's writeback rate is smaller then a correct value,
    writeback speed is slower on all cached devices.
    
    This patch fixes the incorrect slower writeback rate by subtracting
    dirty sectors of flash only volumes in __update_writeback_rate().

    bcache: initialize dirty stripes in flash_dev_run()
    
    commit 175206cf9ab63161dec74d9cd7f9992e062491f5 upstream.
    
    bcache uses a Proportion-Differentiation Controller algorithm to control
    writeback rate to cached devices. In the PD controller algorithm, dirty
    stripes of thin flash device should not be counted in, because flash only
    volumes never write back dirty data.
    
    Currently dirty stripe counter for thin flash device is not initialized
    when the thin flash device starts. Which means the following calculation
    in PD controller will reference an undefined dirty stripes number, and
    all cached devices attached to the same cache set where the thin flash
    device lies on may have an inaccurate writeback rate.
    
    This patch calles bch_sectors_dirty_init() in flash_dev_run(), to
    correctly initialize dirty stripe counter when the thin flash device
    starts to run. This patch also does following parameter data type change,
     -void bch_sectors_dirty_init(struct cached_dev *dc);
     +void bch_sectors_dirty_init(struct bcache_device *);
    to call this function conveniently in flash_dev_run().

    commit 9c7ba1d7634cef490b85bc64c4091ff004821bfd upstream.
    
    Certain syscalls like recvmmsg support 64 bit timespec values for the
    X32 ABI. The helper function compat_put_timespec converts a timespec
    value to a 32 bit or 64 bit value depending on what ABI is used. The
    v4l2 compat layer, however, is not designed to support 64 bit timespec
    values and always uses 32 bit values. Hence, compat_put_timespec must
    not be used.
    
    Without this patch, user space will be provided with bad timestamp
    values from the VIDIOC_DQEVENT ioctl. Also, fields of the struct
    v4l2_event32 that come immediately after timestamp get overwritten,
    namely the field named id.

    ARC: Re-enable MMU upon Machine Check exception
    
    commit 1ee55a8f7f6b7ca4c0c59e0b4b4e3584a085c2d3 upstream.
    
    I recently came upon a scenario where I would get a double fault
    machine check exception tiriggered by a kernel module.
    However the ensuing crash stacktrace (ksym lookup) was not working

    Turns out that machine check auto-disables MMU while modules are allocated
    in kernel vaddr spapce.

    making stacktracing of modules work upon a fatal exception.

    tracing: Apply trace_clock changes to instance max buffer
    
    commit 170b3b1050e28d1ba0700e262f0899ffa4fccc52 upstream.
    
    Currently trace_clock timestamps are applied to both regular and max
    buffers only for global trace. For instance trace, trace_clock
    timestamps are applied only to regular buffer. But, regular and max
    buffers can be swapped, for example, following a snapshot. So, for
    instance trace, bad timestamps can be seen following a snapshot.
    Let's apply trace_clock timestamps to instance max buffer as well.

    commit e6f77540c067b48dee10f1e33678415bfcc89017 upstream.
    
    The value of "size" comes from the user.  When we add "start + size" it
    could lead to an integer overflow bug.
    
    It means we vmalloc() a lot more memory than we had intended.  I believe
    that on 64 bit systems vmalloc() can succeed even if we ask it to
    allocate huge 4GB buffers.  So we would get memory corruption and likely
    a crash when we call ha->isp_ops->write_optrom() and ->read_optrom().
    
    Only root can trigger this bug.

    scsi: zfcp: trace high part of "new" 64 bit SCSI LUN
    
    commit 5d4a3d0a2ff23799b956e5962b886287614e7fad upstream.
    
    Complements debugging aspects of the otherwise functionally complete
    v3.17 commit 9cb78c16f5da ("scsi: use 64-bit LUNs").
    
    While I don't have access to a target exporting 3 or 4 level LUNs,
    I did test it by explicitly attaching a non-existent fake 4 level LUN
    by means of zfcp sysfs attribute "unit_add".
    In order to see corresponding trace records of otherwise successful
    events, we had to increase the trace level of area SCSI and HBA to 6.

    scsi: zfcp: trace HBA FSF response by default on dismiss or timedout late response
    
    commit fdb7cee3b9e3c561502e58137a837341f10cbf8b upstream.
    
    At the default trace level, we only trace unsuccessful events including
    FSF responses.
    
    zfcp_dbf_hba_fsf_response() only used protocol status and FSF status to
    decide on an unsuccessful response. However, this is only one of multiple
    possible sources determining a failed struct zfcp_fsf_req.
    
    An FSF request can also "fail" if its response runs into an ERP timeout
    or if it gets dismissed because a higher level recovery was triggered
    [trace tags "erscf_1" or "erscf_2" in zfcp_erp_strategy_check_fsfreq()].
    FSF requests with ERP timeout are:
    FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA, FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_PORT_DATA,
    FSF_QTCB_OPEN_PORT_WITH_DID or FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_PORT or
    FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_PHYSICAL_PORT for target ports,
    FSF_QTCB_OPEN_LUN, FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_LUN.
    One example is slow queue processing which can cause follow-on errors,
    e.g. FSF_PORT_ALREADY_OPEN after FSF_QTCB_OPEN_PORT_WITH_DID timed out.
    In order to see the root cause, we need to see late responses even if the
    channel presented them successfully with FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD.
    Example trace records formatted with zfcpdbf from the s390-tools package:

    In case of problems detecting that new responses are waiting on the input
    queue, we sooner or later trigger adapter recovery due to an FSF request
    timeout (trace tag "fsrth_1").
    FSF requests with FSF request timeout are:
    typically FSF_QTCB_ABORT_FCP_CMND; but theoretically also
    FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA or FSF_QTCB_EXCHANGE_PORT_DATA via sysfs,
    FSF_QTCB_OPEN_PORT_WITH_DID or FSF_QTCB_CLOSE_PORT for WKA ports,
    FSF_QTCB_FCP_CMND for task management function (LUN / target reset).
    One or more pending requests can meanwhile have FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD
    because the channel filled in the response via DMA into the request's QTCB.
    
    In a theroretical case, inject code can create an erroneous FSF request
    on purpose. If data router is enabled, it uses deferred error reporting.
    A READ SCSI command can succeed with FSF_PROT_GOOD, FSF_GOOD, and
    SAM_STAT_GOOD. But on writing the read data to host memory via DMA,
    it can still fail, e.g. if an intentionally wrong scatter list does not
    provide enough space. Rather than getting an unsuccessful response,
    we get a QDIO activate check which in turn triggers adapter recovery.
    One or more pending requests can meanwhile have FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD
    because the channel filled in the response via DMA into the request's QTCB.

                     00000000 00000000
    
    Only with luck in both above cases, we could see a follow-on trace record
    of an unsuccesful event following a successful but late FSF response with
    FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD. Typically this was the case for I/O requests
    resulting in a SCSI trace record "rsl_err" with DID_TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED
    [On ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_DISMISSED, zfcp_fsf_protstatus_eval() sets
    ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_ERROR seen by the request handler functions as failure].
    However, the reason for this follow-on trace was invisible because the
    corresponding HBA trace record was missing at the default trace level
    (by default hidden records with tags "fs_norm", "fs_qtcb", or "fs_open").
    
    On adapter recovery, after we had shut down the QDIO queues, we perform
    unsuccessful pseudo completions with flag ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_DISMISSED
    for each pending FSF request in zfcp_fsf_req_dismiss_all().
    In order to find the root cause, we need to see all pseudo responses even
    if the channel presented them successfully with FSF_PROT_GOOD and FSF_GOOD.
    
    Therefore, check zfcp_fsf_req.status for ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_DISMISSED
    or ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_ERROR and trace with a new tag "fs_rerr".
    
    It does not matter that there are numerous places which set
    ZFCP_STATUS_FSFREQ_ERROR after the location where we trace an FSF response
    early. These cases are based on protocol status != FSF_PROT_GOOD or
    == FSF_PROT_FSF_STATUS_PRESENTED and are thus already traced by default
    as trace tag "fs_perr" or "fs_ferr" respectively.
    
    NB: The trace record with tag "fssrh_1" for status read buffers on dismiss
    all remains. zfcp_fsf_req_complete() handles this and returns early.
    All other FSF request types are handled separately and as described above.

    If the FCP_RSP UI has optional parts (FCP_SNS_INFO or FCP_RSP_INFO) and
    thus does not fit into the fsp_rsp field built into a SCSI trace record,
    trace the full FCP_RSP UI with all optional parts as payload record
    instead of just FCP_SNS_INFO as payload and
    a 1 byte RSP_INFO_CODE part of FCP_RSP_INFO built into the SCSI record.
    
    That way we would also get the full FCP_SNS_INFO in case a
    target would ever send more than
    min(SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE==96, ZFCP_DBF_PAY_MAX_REC==256)==96.
    
    The mandatory part of FCP_RSP IU is only 24 bytes.
    PAYload costs at least one full PAY record of 256 bytes anyway.
    We cap to the hardware response size which is only FSF_FCP_RSP_SIZE==128.
    So we can just put the whole FCP_RSP IU with any optional parts into
    PAYload similarly as we do for SAN PAY since v4.9 commit aceeffbb59bb
    ("zfcp: trace full payload of all SAN records (req,resp,iels)").
    This does not cause any additional trace records wasting memory.
    
    Decoded trace records were confusing because they showed a hard-coded
    sense data length of 96 even if the FCP_RSP_IU field FCP_SNS_LEN showed
    actually less.
    
    Since the same commit, we set pl_len for SAN traces to the full length of a
    request/response even if we cap the corresponding trace.
    In contrast, here for SCSI traces we set pl_len to the pre-computed
    length of FCP_RSP IU considering SNS_LEN or RSP_LEN if valid.
    Nonetheless we trace a hardcoded payload of length FSF_FCP_RSP_SIZE==128
    if there were optional parts.
    This makes it easier for the zfcpdbf tool to format only the relevant
    part of the long FCP_RSP UI buffer. And any trailing information is still
    available in the payload trace record just in case.
    
    Rename the payload record tag from "fcp_sns" to "fcp_riu" to make the new
    content explicit to zfcpdbf which can then pick a suitable field name such
    as "FCP rsp IU all:" instead of "Sense info :"
    Also, the same zfcpdbf can still be backwards compatible with "fcp_sns".

    scsi: zfcp: fix missing trace records for early returns in TMF eh handlers
    
    commit 1a5d999ebfc7bfe28deb48931bb57faa8e4102b6 upstream.
    
    For problem determination we need to see that we were in scsi_eh
    as well as whether and why we were successful or not.
    
    The following commits introduced new early returns without adding
    a trace record:
    
    v2.6.35 commit a1dbfddd02d2
    ("[SCSI] zfcp: Pass return code from fc_block_scsi_eh to scsi eh")
    on fc_block_scsi_eh() returning != 0 which is FAST_IO_FAIL,
    
    v2.6.30 commit 63caf367e1c9
    ("[SCSI] zfcp: Improve reliability of SCSI eh handlers in zfcp")
    on not having gotten an FSF request after the maximum number of retry
    attempts and thus could not issue a TMF and has to return FAILED.

    scsi: zfcp: add handling for FCP_RESID_OVER to the fcp ingress path
    
    commit a099b7b1fc1f0418ab8d79ecf98153e1e134656e upstream.
    
    Up until now zfcp would just ignore the FCP_RESID_OVER flag in the FCP
    response IU. When this flag is set, it is possible, in regards to the
    FCP standard, that the storage-server processes the command normally, up
    to the point where data is missing and simply ignores those.
    
    In this case no CHECK CONDITION would be set, and because we ignored the
    FCP_RESID_OVER flag we resulted in at least a data loss or even
    -corruption as a follow-up error, depending on how the
    applications/layers on top behave. To prevent this, we now set the
    host-byte of the corresponding scsi_cmnd to DID_ERROR.
    
    Other storage-behaviors, where the same condition results in a CHECK
    CONDITION set in the answer, don't need to be changed as they are
    handled in the mid-layer already.
    
    Following is an example trace record decoded with zfcpdbf from the
    s390-tools package. We forcefully injected a fc_dl which is one byte too
    small:
    
    Timestamp      : ...
    Area           : SCSI
    Subarea        : 00
    Level          : 3

    FCP rsp IU     : 00000000 00000000 00000400 00000001
                                           ^^fr_flags==FCP_RESID_OVER
                                             ^^fr_status==SAM_STAT_GOOD
                                                ^^^^^^^^fr_resid
                     00000000 00000000
    
    As of now, we don't actively handle to possibility that a response IU
    has both flags - FCP_RESID_OVER and FCP_RESID_UNDER - set at once.

    scsi: zfcp: fix queuecommand for scsi_eh commands when DIX enabled
    
    commit 71b8e45da51a7b64a23378221c0a5868bd79da4f upstream.
    
    Since commit db007fc5e20c ("[SCSI] Command protection operation"),
    scsi_eh_prep_cmnd() saves scmd->prot_op and temporarily resets it to
    SCSI_PROT_NORMAL.
    Other FCP LLDDs such as qla2xxx and lpfc shield their queuecommand()
    to only access any of scsi_prot_sg...() if
    (scsi_get_prot_op(cmd) != SCSI_PROT_NORMAL).
    
    Do the same thing for zfcp, which introduced DIX support with
    commit ef3eb71d8ba4 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Introduce experimental support for
    DIF/DIX").
    
    Otherwise, TUR SCSI commands as part of scsi_eh likely fail in zfcp,
    because the regular SCSI command with DIX protection data, that scsi_eh
    re-uses in scsi_send_eh_cmnd(), of course still has
    (scsi_prot_sg_count() != 0) and so zfcp sends down bogus requests to the
    FCP channel hardware.
    
    This causes scsi_eh_test_devices() to have (finish_cmds == 0)
    [not SCSI device is online or not scsi_eh_tur() failed]
    so regular SCSI commands, that caused / were affected by scsi_eh,
    are moved to work_q and scsi_eh_test_devices() itself returns false.
    In turn, it unnecessarily escalates in our case in scsi_eh_ready_devs()
    beyond host reset to finally scsi_eh_offline_sdevs()
    which sets affected SCSI devices offline with the following kernel message:
    
    "kernel: sd H:0:T:L: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery"

    md/bitmap: disable bitmap_resize for file-backed bitmaps.
    
    commit e8a27f836f165c26f867ece7f31eb5c811692319 upstream.
    
    bitmap_resize() does not work for file-backed bitmaps.
    The buffer_heads are allocated and initialized when
    the bitmap is read from the file, but resize doesn't
    read from the file, it loads from the internal bitmap.
    When it comes time to write the new bitmap, the bh is
    non-existent and we crash.
    
    The common case when growing an array involves making the array larger,
    and that normally means making the bitmap larger.  Doing
    that inside the kernel is possible, but would need more code.
    It is probably easier to require people who use file-backed
    bitmaps to remove them and re-add after a reshape.
    
    So this patch disables the resizing of arrays which have
    file-backed bitmaps.  This is better than crashing.

    block: Relax a check in blk_start_queue()
    
    commit 4ddd56b003f251091a67c15ae3fe4a5c5c5e390a upstream.
    
    Calling blk_start_queue() from interrupt context with the queue
    lock held and without disabling IRQs, as the skd driver does, is
    safe. This patch avoids that loading the skd driver triggers the
    following warning:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 1348 at block/blk-core.c:283 blk_start_queue+0x84/0xa0

    powerpc: Fix DAR reporting when alignment handler faults
    
    commit f9effe925039cf54489b5c04e0d40073bb3a123d upstream.
    
    Anton noticed that if we fault part way through emulating an unaligned
    instruction, we don't update the DAR to reflect that.
    
    The DAR value is eventually reported back to userspace as the address
    in the SEGV signal, and if userspace is using that value to demand
    fault then it can be confused by us not setting the value correctly.
    
    This patch is ugly as hell, but is intended to be the minimal fix and
    back ports easily.

    ext4: fix incorrect quotaoff if the quota feature is enabled
    
    commit b0a5a9589decd07db755d6a8d9c0910d96ff7992 upstream.
    
    Current ext4 quota should always "usage enabled" if the
    quota feautre is enabled. But in ext4_orphan_cleanup(), it
    turn quotas off directly (used for the older journaled
    quota), so we cannot turn it on again via "quotaon" unless
    umount and remount ext4.
    
    Simple reproduce:
    
      mkfs.ext4 -O project,quota /dev/vdb1
      mount -o prjquota /dev/vdb1 /mnt
      chattr -p 123 /mnt
      chattr +P /mnt
      touch /mnt/aa /mnt/bb
      exec 100<>/mnt/aa
      rm -f /mnt/aa
      sync
      echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
    
      #reboot and mount
      mount -o prjquota /dev/vdb1 /mnt
      #query status
      quotaon -Ppv /dev/vdb1
      #output
      quotaon: Cannot find mountpoint for device /dev/vdb1
      quotaon: No correct mountpoint specified.
    
    This patch add check for journaled quotas to avoid incorrect
    quotaoff when ext4 has quota feautre.

    crypto: AF_ALG - remove SGL terminator indicator when chaining
    
    Fixed differently upstream as commit 2d97591ef43d ("crypto: af_alg - consolidation of duplicate code")
    
    The SGL is MAX_SGL_ENTS + 1 in size. The last SG entry is used for the
    chaining and is properly updated with the sg_chain invocation. During
    the filling-in of the initial SG entries, sg_mark_end is called for each
    SG entry. This is appropriate as long as no additional SGL is chained
    with the current SGL. However, when a new SGL is chained and the last
    SG entry is updated with sg_chain, the last but one entry still contains
    the end marker from the sg_mark_end. This end marker must be removed as
    otherwise a walk of the chained SGLs will cause a NULL pointer
    dereference at the last but one SG entry, because sg_next will return
    NULL.
    
    The patch only applies to all kernels up to and including 4.13. The
    patch 2d97591ef43d0587be22ad1b0d758d6df4999a0b added to 4.14-rc1
    introduced a complete new code base which addresses this bug in
    a different way. Yet, that patch is too invasive for stable kernels
    and was therefore not marked for stable.

    [ Upstream commit ba1cc08d9488c94cb8d94f545305688b72a2a300 ]
    
    fib6_net_exit only frees the main and local tables. If another table was
    created with fib6_alloc_table, we leak it when the netns is destroyed.
    
    Fix this in the same way ip_fib_net_exit cleans up tables, by walking
    through the whole hashtable of fib6_table's. We can get rid of the
    special cases for local and main, since they're also part of the
    hashtable.

        ip netns add x

    The original motivation for this change originated from Marc Gonzales
    indicating that his network driver did not have its adjust_link callback
    executing with phydev->link = 0 while he was expecting it.
    
    PHYLIB has never made any such guarantees ever because phy_stop() merely just
    tells the workqueue to move into PHY_HALTED state which will happen
    asynchronously.

    qlge: avoid memcpy buffer overflow
    
    
    [ Upstream commit e58f95831e7468d25eb6e41f234842ecfe6f014f ]
    
    gcc-8.0.0 (snapshot) points out that we copy a variable-length string
    into a fixed length field using memcpy() with the destination length,
    and that ends up copying whatever follows the string:
    
        inlined from 'ql_core_dump' at drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlge/qlge_dbg.c:1106:2:
    drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlge/qlge_dbg.c:708:2: error: 'memcpy' reading 15 bytes from a region of size 14 [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]
      memcpy(seg_hdr->description, desc, (sizeof(seg_hdr->description)) - 1);
    
    Changing it to use strncpy() will instead zero-pad the destination,
    which seems to be the right thing to do here.
    
    The bug is probably harmless, but it seems like a good idea to address

    ipv6: accept 64k - 1 packet length in ip6_find_1stfragopt()
    
    
    [ Upstream commit 3de33e1ba0506723ab25734e098cf280ecc34756 ]
    
    A packet length of exactly IPV6_MAXPLEN is allowed, we should
    refuse parsing options only if the size is 64KiB or more.
    
    While at it, remove one extra variable and one assignment which
    were also introduced by the commit that introduced the size
    check. Checking the sum 'offset + len' and only later adding
    'len' to 'offset' doesn't provide any advantage over directly
    summing to 'offset' and checking it.
    
    Fixes: 6399f1fae4ec ("ipv6: avoid overflow of offset in ip6_find_1stfragopt")
