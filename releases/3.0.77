    This reverts commit 55fe10a686c3a8bce7bddc149e4ebb12f5a18c25 which is
    commit 0443de5fbf224abf41f688d8487b0c307dc5a4b4 upstream.
    
    This causes a build breakage on 3.0, so we shouldn't apply it to that
    tree.

    s390: move dummy io_remap_pfn_range() to asm/pgtable.h
    
    commit 4f2e29031e6c67802e7370292dd050fd62f337ee upstream.
    
    Commit b4cbb197c7e7 ("vm: add vm_iomap_memory() helper function") added
    a helper function wrapper around io_remap_pfn_range(), and every other
    architecture defined it in <asm/pgtable.h>.
    
    The s390 choice of <asm/io.h> may make sense, but is not very convenient
    for this case, and gratuitous differences like that cause unexpected errors like this:
    
       mm/memory.c: In function 'vm_iomap_memory':
       mm/memory.c:2439:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'io_remap_pfn_range' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    
    Glory be the kbuild test robot who noticed this, bisected it, and
    reported it to the guilty parties (ie me).

    The adp5520 unfortunately also clears the BL_EN bit when the nSTNDBY bit is

    mmc: core: Fix bit width test failing on old eMMC cards
    
    commit 836dc2fe89c968c10cada87e0dfae6626f8f9da3 upstream.
    
    PARTITION_SUPPORT needs to be set before doing the compare on version
    number so the bit width test does not get invalid data.  Before this
    patch, a Sandisk iNAND eMMC card would detect 1-bit width although
    the hardware supports 4-bit.
    
    Only affects old emmc devices - pre 4.4 devices.

    x86: Eliminate irq_mis_count counted in arch_irq_stat
    
    commit f7b0e1055574ce06ab53391263b4e205bf38daf3 upstream.
    
    With the current implementation, kstat_cpu(cpu).irqs_sum is also
    increased in case of irq_mis_count increment.
    
    So there is no need to count irq_mis_count in arch_irq_stat,
    otherwise irq_mis_count will be counted twice in the sum of
    /proc/stat.

    ipc: sysv shared memory limited to 8TiB

    Trying to run an application which was trying to put data into half of
    memory using shmget(), we found that having a shmall value below 8EiB-8TiB
    would prevent us from using anything more than 8TiB.  By setting

    wireless: regulatory: fix channel disabling race condition
    
    commit 990de49f74e772b6db5208457b7aa712a5f4db86 upstream.
    
    When a full scan 2.4 and 5 GHz scan is scheduled, but then the 2.4 GHz
    part of the scan disables a 5.2 GHz channel due to, e.g. receiving
    country or frequency information, that 5.2 GHz channel might already
    be in the list of channels to scan next. Then, when the driver checks
    if it should do a passive scan, that will return false and attempt an
    active scan. This is not only wrong but can also lead to the iwlwifi
    device firmware crashing since it checks regulatory as well.
    
    Fix this by not setting the channel flags to just disabled but rather
    OR'ing in the disabled flag. That way, even if the race happens, the
    channel will be scanned passively which is still (mostly) correct.

    LOCKD: Ensure that nlmclnt_block resets block->b_status after a server reboot
    
    commit 1dfd89af8697a299e7982ae740d4695ecd917eef upstream.
    
    After a server reboot, the reclaimer thread will recover all the existing
    locks. For locks that are blocked, however, it will change the value
    of block->b_status to nlm_lck_denied_grace_period in order to signal that
    they need to wake up and resend the original blocking lock request.
    
    Due to a bug, however, the block->b_status never gets reset after the
    blocked locks have been woken up, and so the process goes into an
    infinite loop of resends until the blocked lock is satisfied.

    clockevents: Set dummy handler on CPU_DEAD shutdown
    
    commit 6f7a05d7018de222e40ca003721037a530979974 upstream.
    
    Vitaliy reported that a per cpu HPET timer interrupt crashes the
    system during hibernation. What happens is that the per cpu HPET timer
    gets shut down when the nonboot cpus are stopped. When the nonboot
    cpus are onlined again the HPET code sets up the MSI interrupt which
    fires before the clock event device is registered. The event handler
    is still set to hrtimer_interrupt, which then crashes the machine due
    to highres mode not being active.
    
    See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700333
    
    There is no real good way to avoid that in the HPET code. The HPET
    code alrady has a mechanism to detect spurious interrupts when event
    handler == NULL for a similar reason.
    
    We can handle that in the clockevent/tick layer and replace the
    previous functional handler with a dummy handler like we do in
    tick_setup_new_device().
    
    The original clockevents code did this in clockevents_exchange_device(),
    but that got removed by commit 7c1e76897 (clockevents: prevent
    clockevent event_handler ending up handler_noop) which forgot to fix
    it up in tick_shutdown(). Same issue with the broadcast device.

    commit 3ac1707a13a3da9cfc8f242a15b2fae6df2c5f88 upstream.
    
    The 3rd parameter of flex_array_prealloc() is the number of elements,
    not the index of the last element.
    
    The effect of the bug is, when opening cgroup.procs, a flex array will
    be allocated and all elements of the array is allocated with
    GFP_KERNEL flag, but the last one is GFP_ATOMIC, and if we fail to

    drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c: don't disable hpet emulation on suspend
    
    commit e005715efaf674660ae59af83b13822567e3a758 upstream.
    
    There's a bug where rtc alarms are ignored after the rtc cmos suspends
    but before the system finishes suspend.  Since hpet emulation is
    disabled and it still handles the interrupts, a wake event is never
    registered which is done from the rtc layer.
    
    This patch reverts commit d1b2efa83fbf ("rtc: disable hpet emulation on
    suspend") which disabled hpet emulation.  To fix the problem mentioned
    in that commit, hpet_rtc_timer_init() is called directly on resume.

    When we change the system time to a low value like this, the value of
    timekeeper->offs_real will be a negative value.
    
    It seems that the WARN occurs because an hrtimer has been started in the time
    between the releasing of the timekeeper lock and the IPI call (via a call to
    on_each_cpu) in clock_was_set() in the do_settimeofday() code.  The end result
    is that a REALTIME_CLOCK timer has been added with softexpires = expires =
    KTIME_MAX.  The hrtimer_interrupt() fires/is called and the loop at
    kernel/hrtimer.c:1289 is executed.  In this loop the code subtracts the
    clock base's offset (which was set to timekeeper->offs_real in
    do_settimeofday()) from the current hrtimer_cpu_base->expiry value (which
    was KTIME_MAX):
    
            KTIME_MAX - (a negative value) = overflow
    
    A simple check for an overflow can resolve this problem.  Using KTIME_MAX
    instead of the overflow value will result in the hrtimer function being run,
    and the reprogramming of the timer after that.

    hrtimer: Fix ktime_add_ns() overflow on 32bit architectures
    
    commit 51fd36f3fad8447c487137ae26b9d0b3ce77bb25 upstream.
    
    One can trigger an overflow when using ktime_add_ns() on a 32bit
    architecture not supporting CONFIG_KTIME_SCALAR.
    
    When passing a very high value for u64 nsec, e.g. 7881299347898368000
    the do_div() function converts this value to seconds (7881299347) which
    is still to high to pass to the ktime_set() function as long. The result
    in is a negative value.
    
    The problem on my system occurs in the tick-sched.c,
    tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() when time_delta is set to
    timekeeping_max_deferment(). The check for time_delta < KTIME_MAX is
    valid, thus ktime_add_ns() is called with a too large value resulting in
    a negative expire value. This leads to an endless loop in the ticker code:
    
    time_delta: 7881299347898368000
    expires = ktime_add_ns(last_update, time_delta)
    expires: negative value
    
    This fix caps the value to KTIME_MAX.
    
    This error doesn't occurs on 64bit or architectures supporting
    CONFIG_KTIME_SCALAR (e.g. ARM, x86-32).

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix autopm error during probing
    
    commit 60af3d037eb8c670dcce31401501d1271e7c5d95 upstream.
    
    We've got strange errors in get_ctl_value() in mixer.c during
    probing, e.g. on Hercules RMX2 DJ Controller:
    
      ALSA mixer.c:352 cannot get ctl value: req = 0x83, wValue = 0x201, wIndex = 0xa00, type = 4
      ALSA mixer.c:352 cannot get ctl value: req = 0x83, wValue = 0x200, wIndex = 0xa00, type = 4
      ....
    
    It turned out that the culprit is autopm: snd_usb_autoresume() returns
    -ENODEV when called during card->probing = 1.
    
    Since the call itself during card->probing = 1 is valid, let's fix the
    return value of snd_usb_autoresume() as success.

    ALSA: usb-audio: disable autopm for MIDI devices
    
    commit cbc200bca4b51a8e2406d4b654d978f8503d430b upstream.
    
    Commit 88a8516a2128 (ALSA: usbaudio: implement USB autosuspend)
    introduced autopm for all USB audio/MIDI devices.  However, many MIDI
    devices, such as synthesizers, do not merely transmit MIDI messages but
    use their MIDI inputs to control other functions.  With autopm, these
    devices would get powered down as soon as the last MIDI port device is
    closed on the host.
    
    Even some plain MIDI interfaces could get broken: they automatically
    send Active Sensing messages while powered up, but as soon as these
    messages cease, the receiving device would interpret this as an
    accidental disconnection.
    
    Commit f5f165418cab (ALSA: usb-audio: Fix missing autopm for MIDI input)
    introduced another regression: some devices (e.g. the Roland GAIA SH-01)
    are self-powered but do a reset whenever the USB interface's power state
    changes.
    
    To work around all this, just disable autopm for all USB MIDI devices.

    commit ec686c9239b4d472052a271c505d04dae84214cc upstream.
    
    There is a kernel memory leak observed when the proc file
    /proc/fs/fscache/stats is read.
    
    The reason is that in fscache_stats_open, single_open is called and the
    respective release function is not called during release.  Hence fix
    with correct release function - single_release().

    Wrong asm register contraints in the kvm implementation
    
    commit de53e9caa4c6149ef4a78c2f83d7f5b655848767 upstream.
    
    The Linux Kernel contains some inline assembly source code which has
    wrong asm register constraints in arch/ia64/kvm/vtlb.c.
    
    I observed this on Kernel 3.2.35 but it is also true on the most
    recent Kernel 3.9-rc1.
    
    File arch/ia64/kvm/vtlb.c:
    
    u64 guest_vhpt_lookup(u64 iha, u64 *pte)
    {
            u64 ret;
            struct thash_data *data;
    
            data = __vtr_lookup(current_vcpu, iha, D_TLB);
            if (data != NULL)
                    thash_vhpt_insert(current_vcpu, data->page_flags,
                            data->itir, iha, D_TLB);
    
            asm volatile (
                            "rsm psr.ic|psr.i;;"
                            "srlz.d;;"
                            "ld8.s r9=[%1];;"
                            "tnat.nz p6,p7=r9;;"
                            "(p6) mov %0=1;"
                            "(p6) mov r9=r0;"
                            "(p7) extr.u r9=r9,0,53;;"
                            "(p7) mov %0=r0;"
                            "(p7) st8 [%2]=r9;;"
                            "ssm psr.ic;;"
                            "srlz.d;;"
                            "ssm psr.i;;"
                            "srlz.d;;"
                            : "=r"(ret) : "r"(iha), "r"(pte):"memory");
    
            return ret;
    }
    
    The list of output registers is
                            : "=r"(ret) : "r"(iha), "r"(pte):"memory");
    The constraint "=r" means that the GCC has to maintain that these vars
    are in registers and contain valid info when the program flow leaves
    the assembly block (output registers).
    But "=r" also means that GCC can put them in registers that are used
    as input registers. Input registers are iha, pte on the example.
    If the predicate p7 is true, the 8th assembly instruction
                            "(p7) mov %0=r0;"
    is the first one which writes to a register which is maintained by the
    register constraints; it sets %0. %0 means the first register operand;
    it is ret here.
    This instruction might overwrite the %2 register (pte) which is needed
    by the next instruction:
                            "(p7) st8 [%2]=r9;;"
    Whether it really happens depends on how GCC decides what registers it
    uses and how it optimizes the code.
    
    The attached patch  fixes the register operand constraints in
    arch/ia64/kvm/vtlb.c.
    The register constraints should be
                            : "=&r"(ret) : "r"(iha), "r"(pte):"memory");
    The & means that GCC must not use any of the input registers to place
    this output register in.
    
    This is Debian bug#702639
    (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=702639).
    
    The patch is applicable on Kernel 3.9-rc1, 3.2.35 and many other versions.

    Wrong asm register contraints in the futex implementation
    
    commit 136f39ddc53db3bcee2befbe323a56d4fbf06da8 upstream.
    
    The Linux Kernel contains some inline assembly source code which has
    wrong asm register constraints in arch/ia64/include/asm/futex.h.
    
    I observed this on Kernel 3.2.23 but it is also true on the most

            }
    }
    
    The list of output registers is
                            : "=r" (r8), "=r" (prev)
    The constraint "=r" means that the GCC has to maintain that these vars
    are in registers and contain valid info when the program flow leaves
    the assembly block (output registers).
    But "=r" also means that GCC can put them in registers that are used
    as input registers. Input registers are uaddr, newval, oldval on the
    example.
    The second assembly instruction
                            "       mov %0=r0                               \n"
    is the first one which writes to a register; it sets %0 to 0. %0 means
    the first register operand; it is r8 here. (The r0 is read-only and
    always 0 on the Itanium; it can be used if an immediate zero value is
    needed.)
    This instruction might overwrite one of the other registers which are
    still needed.
    Whether it really happens depends on how GCC decides what registers it
    uses and how it optimizes the code.
    
    The objdump utility can give us disassembly.
    The futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() function is inline, so we have to
    look for a module that uses the funtion. This is the
    cmpxchg_futex_value_locked() function in
    kernel/futex.c:
    
    static int cmpxchg_futex_value_locked(u32 *curval, u32 __user *uaddr,
                                          u32 uval, u32 newval)
    {
            int ret;
    
            pagefault_disable();
            ret = futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(curval, uaddr, uval, newval);
            pagefault_enable();
    
            return ret;
    }
    
    Now the disassembly. At first from the Kernel package 3.2.23 which has
    been compiled with GCC 4.4, remeber this Kernel seemed to work:

    prepares the 'oldvalue' for the cmpxchg but it takes it from r8. This
    is wrong.
    What happened here is what I explained above: An input register is
    overwritten which is still needed.
    The register operand constraints in futex.h are wrong.
    
    (The problem doesn't occur when the Kernel is compiled with GCC 4.6.)
    
    The attached patch fixes the register operand constraints in futex.h.
    The code after patching of it:
    
    static inline int
    futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(u32 *uval, u32 __user *uaddr,
                                  u32 oldval, u32 newval)
    {
            if (!access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, uaddr, sizeof(u32)))
                    return -EFAULT;
    
            {
                    register unsigned long r8 __asm ("r8") = 0;
                    unsigned long prev;
                    __asm__ __volatile__(
                            "       mf;;                                    \n"
                            "       mov ar.ccv=%4;;                         \n"
                            "[1:]   cmpxchg4.acq %1=[%2],%3,ar.ccv          \n"
                            "       .xdata4 \"__ex_table\", 1b-., 2f-.      \n"
                            "[2:]"
                            : "+r" (r8), "=&r" (prev)
                            : "r" (uaddr), "r" (newval),
                              "rO" ((long) (unsigned) oldval)
                            : "memory");
                    *uval = prev;
                    return r8;
            }
    }
    
    I also initialized the 'r8' var with the C programming language.
    The _asm qualifier on the definition of the 'r8' var forces GCC to use
    the r8 processor register for it.
    I don't believe that we should use inline assembly for zeroing out a
    local variable.
    The constraint is
    "+r" (r8)
    what means that it is both an input register and an output register.
    Note that the page fault handler will modify the r8 register which
    will be the return value of the function.
    The real fix is
    "=&r" (prev)
    The & means that GCC must not use any of the input registers to place
    this output register in.
    
    Patched the Kernel 3.2.23 and compiled it with GCC4.4:

    PCI / ACPI: Don't query OSC support with all possible controls
    
    commit 545d6e189a41c94c11f55045a771118eccc9d9eb upstream.
    
    Found problem on system that firmware that could handle pci aer.
    Firmware get error reporting after pci injecting error, before os boots.
    But after os boots, firmware can not get report anymore, even pci=noaer
    is passed.
    
    Root cause: BIOS _OSC has problem with query bit checking.
    It turns out that BIOS vendor is copying example code from ACPI Spec.
    In ACPI Spec 5.0, page 290:
    
            If (Not(And(CDW1,1))) // Query flag clear?
            {       // Disable GPEs for features granted native control.
                    If (And(CTRL,0x01)) // Hot plug control granted?
                    {
                            Store(0,HPCE) // clear the hot plug SCI enable bit
                            Store(1,HPCS) // clear the hot plug SCI status bit
                    }
            ...
            }
    
    When Query flag is set, And(CDW1,1) will be 1, Not(1) will return 0xfffffffe.
    So it will get into code path that should be for control set only.
    BIOS acpi code should be changed to "If (LEqual(And(CDW1,1), 0)))"
    
    Current kernel code is using _OSC query to notify firmware about support
    from OS and then use _OSC to set control bits.
    During query support, current code is using all possible controls.
    So will execute code that should be only for control set stage.
    
    That will have problem when pci=noaer or aer firmware_first is used.
    As firmware have that control set for os aer already in query support stage,
    but later will not os aer handling.
    
    We should avoid passing all possible controls, just use osc_control_set
    instead.
    That should workaround BIOS bugs with affected systems on the field
    as more bios vendors are copying sample code from ACPI spec.

    Fix initialization of CMCI/CMCP interrupts
    
    commit d303e9e98fce56cdb3c6f2ac92f626fc2bd51c77 upstream.
    
    Back 2010 during a revamp of the irq code some initializations
    were moved from ia64_mca_init() to ia64_mca_late_init() in
    
            commit c75f2aa13f5b268aba369b5dc566088b5194377c
            Cannot use register_percpu_irq() from ia64_mca_init()
    
    But this was hideously wrong. First of all these initializations
    are now down far too late. Specifically after all the other cpus
    have been brought up and initialized their own CMC vectors from
    smp_callin(). Also ia64_mca_late_init() may be called from any cpu
    so the line:
            ia64_mca_cmc_vector_setup();       /* Setup vector on BSP */
    is generally not executed on the BSP, and so the CMC vector isn't
    setup at all on that processor.
    
    Make use of the arch_early_irq_init() hook to get this code executed
    at just the right moment: not too early, not too late.

    commit c39e8e4354ce4daf23336de5daa28a3b01f00aa6 upstream.
    
    The TX_FIFO register is 10 bits wide.  The lower 8 bits are the data to be
    written, while the upper two bits are flags to indicate stop/start.
    
    The driver apparently attempted to optimize write access, by only writing a
    byte in those cases where the stop/start bits are zero.  However, we have
    seen cases where the lower byte is duplicated onto the upper byte by the
    hardware, which causes inadvertent stop/starts.
    
    This patch changes the write access to the transmit FIFO to always be 16 bits
    wide.

    The ftrace_graph_count can be decreased with a "!" pattern, so that
    the enabled flag should be updated too.

    tracing: Remove most or all of stack tracer stack size from stack_max_size
    
    commit 4df297129f622bdc18935c856f42b9ddd18f9f28 upstream.
    
    Currently, the depth reported in the stack tracer stack_trace file
    does not match the stack_max_size file. This is because the stack_max_size
    includes the overhead of stack tracer itself while the depth does not.
    
    The first time a max is triggered, a calculation is not performed that
    figures out the overhead of the stack tracer and subtracts it from
    the stack_max_size variable. The overhead is stored and is subtracted
    from the reported stack size for comparing for a new max.
    
    Now the stack_max_size corresponds to the reported depth:
    
     # cat stack_max_size
    4640
    
     # cat stack_trace
            Depth    Size   Location    (48 entries)
            -----    ----   --------
      0)     4640      32   _raw_spin_lock+0x18/0x24

      3)     4416      16   mempool_alloc_slab+0x15/0x17
    [...]
    
    While testing against and older gcc on x86 that uses mcount instead
    of fentry, I found that pasing in ip + MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE let the
    stack trace show one more function deep which was missing before.

    tracing: Fix stack tracer with fentry use
    
    commit d4ecbfc49b4b1d4b597fb5ba9e4fa25d62f105c5 upstream.
    
    When gcc 4.6 on x86 is used, the function tracer will use the new
    option -mfentry which does a call to "fentry" at every function
    instead of "mcount". The significance of this is that fentry is
    called as the first operation of the function instead of the mcount
    usage of being called after the stack.
    
    This causes the stack tracer to show some bogus results for the size
    of the last function traced, as well as showing "ftrace_call" instead
    of the function. This is due to the stack frame not being set up
    by the function that is about to be traced.
    
     # cat stack_trace
            Depth    Size   Location    (48 entries)
            -----    ----   --------
      0)     4824     216   ftrace_call+0x5/0x2f
      1)     4608     112   ____cache_alloc+0xb7/0x22d
      2)     4496      80   kmem_cache_alloc+0x63/0x12f
    
    The 216 size for ftrace_call includes both the ftrace_call stack
    (which includes the saving of registers it does), as well as the
    stack size of the parent.
    
    To fix this, if CC_USING_FENTRY is defined, then the stack_tracer
    will reserve the first item in stack_dump_trace[] array when
    calling save_stack_trace(), and it will fill it in with the parent ip.
    Then the code will look for the parent pointer on the stack and
    give the real size of the parent's stack pointer:
    
     # cat stack_trace
            Depth    Size   Location    (14 entries)
            -----    ----   --------
      0)     2640      48   update_group_power+0x26/0x187
      1)     2592     224   update_sd_lb_stats+0x2a5/0x4ac
      2)     2368     160   find_busiest_group+0x31/0x1f1
      3)     2208     256   load_balance+0xd9/0x662
    
    I'm Cc'ing stable, although it's not urgent, as it only shows bogus
    size for item #0, the rest of the trace is legit. It should still be
    corrected in previous stable releases.

    tty: fix up atime/mtime mess, take three
    
    commit b0b885657b6c8ef63a46bc9299b2a7715d19acde upstream.
    
    We first tried to avoid updating atime/mtime entirely (commit
    b0de59b5733d: "TTY: do not update atime/mtime on read/write"), and then
    limited it to only update it occasionally (commit 37b7f3c76595: "TTY:
    fix atime/mtime regression"), but it turns out that this was both
    insufficient and overkill.
    
    It was insufficient because we let people attach to the shared ptmx node
    to see activity without even reading atime/mtime, and it was overkill
    because the "only once a minute" means that you can't really tell an
    idle person from an active one with 'w'.
    
    So this tries to fix the problem properly.  It marks the shared ptmx
    node as un-notifiable, and it lowers the "only once a minute" to a few
    seconds instead - still long enough that you can't time individual
    keystrokes, but short enough that you can tell whether somebody is
    active or not.

    serial_core.c: add put_device() after device_find_child()
    
    commit 5a65dcc04cda41f4122aacc37a5a348454645399 upstream.
    
    The serial core uses device_find_child() but does not drop the reference to
    the retrieved child after using it. This patch add the missing put_device().
    
    What I have done to test this issue.
    
    I used a machine with an AMBA PL011 serial driver. I tested the patch on
    next-20120408 because the last branch [next-20120415] does not boot on this
    board.
    
    For test purpose, I added some pr_info() messages to print the refcount
    after device_find_child() (lines: 1937,2009), and after put_device()
    (lines: 1947, 2021).
    
    Boot the machine *without* put_device(). Then:
    
    echo reboot > /sys/power/disk
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [   87.058575] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 4
    [   87.058582] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 4
    [   87.098083] uart_resume_port:2009refcount 5
    [   87.098088] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 5
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  103.055574] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 6
    [  103.055580] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 6
    [  103.095322] uart_resume_port:2009 refcount 7
    [  103.095327] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 7
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  252.459580] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 8
    [  252.459586] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 8
    [  252.499611] uart_resume_port:2009 refcount 9
    [  252.499616] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 9
    
    The refcount continuously increased.
    
    Boot the machine *with* this patch. Then:
    
    echo reboot > /sys/power/disk
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  159.333559] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 4
    [  159.333566] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 3
    [  159.372751] uart_resume_port:2009 refcount 4
    [  159.372755] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 3
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state

    [  185.713621] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 3
    [  185.752935] uart_resume_port:2009 refcount 4
    [  185.752940] uart_resume_port:2021 refcount 3
    
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    [  207.458584] uart_suspend_port:1937 refcount 4
    [  207.458591] uart_suspend_port:1947 refcount 3

    xen/time: Fix kasprintf splat when allocating timer%d IRQ line.

    When we online the CPU, we get this splat:

    BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at /home/konrad/ssd/konrad/linux/mm/slab.c:3179

    The solution to that is use kasprintf in the CPU hotplug path
    that 'online's the CPU. That is, do it in in xen_hvm_cpu_notify,
    and remove the call to in xen_hvm_setup_cpu_clockevents.
    
    Unfortunatly the later is not a good idea as the bootup path
    does not use xen_hvm_cpu_notify so we would end up never allocating
    timer%d interrupt lines when booting. As such add the check for
    atomic() to continue.

    s390/memory hotplug: prevent offline of active memory increments
    
    commit 94c163663fc1dcfc067a5fb3cc1446b9469975ce upstream.
    
    In case a machine supports memory hotplug all active memory increments
    present at IPL time have been initialized with a "usecount" of 1.
    This is wrong if the memory increment size is larger than the memory
    section size of the memory hotplug code. If that is the case the
    usecount must be initialized with the number of memory sections that
    fit into one memory increment.
    Otherwise it is possible to put a memory increment into standby state
    even if there are still active sections.
    Afterwards addressing exceptions might happen which cause the kernel
    to panic.
    However even worse, if a memory increment was put into standby state
    and afterwards into active state again, it's contents would have been
    zeroed, leading to memory corruption.
    
    This was only an issue for machines that support standby memory and
    have at least 256GB memory.
    
    This is broken since commit fdb1bb15 "[S390] sclp/memory hotplug: fix
    initial usecount of increments".

    usb-storage: CY7C68300A chips do not support Cypress ATACB
    
    commit 671b4b2ba9266cbcfe7210a704e9ea487dcaa988 upstream.
    
    Many cards based on CY7C68300A/B/C use the USB ID 04b4:6830 but only the
    B and C variants (EZ-USB AT2LP) support the ATA Command Block
    functionality, according to the data sheets. The A variant (EZ-USB AT2)
    locks up if ATACB is attempted, until a typical 30 seconds timeout runs
    out and a USB reset is performed.
    
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/428469
    
    It seems that one way to spot a CY7C68300A (at least where the card
    manufacturer left Cypress' EEPROM default vaules, against Cypress'
    recommendations) is to look at the USB string descriptor indices.
    
    A http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Cypress%20PDFs/CY7C68300A.pdf
    B http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/43456.pdf
    C http://www.cypress.com/?rID=14189
    
    Note that a CY7C68300B/C chip appears as CY7C68300A if it is running
    in Backward Compatibility Mode, and if ATACB would be supported in this
    case there is anyway no way to tell which chip it really is.
    
    For 5 years my external USB drive has been locking up for half a minute
    when plugged in and ata_id is run by udev, or anytime hdparm or similar
    is run on it.
    
    Finally looking at the /correct/ datasheet I think I found the reason. I
    am aware the quirk in this patch is a bit hacky, but the hardware
    manufacturers haven't made it easy for us.

    commit 1361bf4b9f9ef45e628a5b89e0fd9bedfdcb7104 upstream.
    
    When usbfs receives a ctrl-request from userspace it calls check_ctrlrecip,
    which for a request with USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT tries to map this to an interface
    to see if this interface is claimed, except for ctrl-requests with a type of
    USB_TYPE_VENDOR.
    
    When trying to use this device: http://www.akaipro.com/eiepro
    redirected to a Windows vm running on qemu on top of Linux.
    
    The windows driver makes a ctrl-req with USB_TYPE_CLASS and
    USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT with index 0, and the mapping of the endpoint (0) to
    the interface fails since ep 0 is the ctrl endpoint and thus never is
    part of an interface.
    
    This patch fixes this ctrl-req failing by skipping the checkintf call for
    USB_RECIP_ENDPOINT ctrl-reqs on the ctrl endpoint.

    USB: ftdi_sio: correct ST Micro Connect Lite PIDs
    
    commit 9f06d15f8db6946e41f73196a122b84a37938878 upstream.
    
    The current ST Micro Connect Lite uses the FT4232H hi-speed quad USB
    UART FTDI chip. It is also possible to drive STM reference targets
    populated with an on-board JTAG debugger based on the FT2232H chip with
    the same STMicroelectronics tools.
    
    For this reason, the ST Micro Connect Lite PIDs should be
    ST_STMCLT_2232_PID: 0x3746
    ST_STMCLT_4232_PID: 0x3747

    powerpc/spufs: Initialise inode->i_ino in spufs_new_inode()
    
    commit 6747e83235caecd30b186d1282e4eba7679f81b7 upstream.
    
    In commit 85fe402 (fs: do not assign default i_ino in new_inode), the
    initialisation of i_ino was removed from new_inode() and pushed down
    into the callers. However spufs_new_inode() was not updated.
    
    This exhibits as no files appearing in /spu, because all our dirents
    have a zero inode, which readdir() seems to dislike.

    powerpc: Add isync to copy_and_flush
    
    commit 29ce3c5073057991217916abc25628e906911757 upstream.
    
    In __after_prom_start we copy the kernel down to zero in two calls to
    copy_and_flush.  After the first call (copy from 0 to copy_to_here:)
    we jump to the newly copied code soon after.
    
    Unfortunately there's no isync between the copy of this code and the
    jump to it.  Hence it's possible that stale instructions could still be
    in the icache or pipeline before we branch to it.
    
    We've seen this on real machines and it's results in no console output
    after:
      calling quiesce...
      returning from prom_init
    
    The below adds an isync to ensure that the copy and flushing has
    completed before any branching to the new instructions occurs.
