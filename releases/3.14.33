    crypto: crc32c - add missing crypto module alias
    
    The backport of commit 5d26a105b5a7 ("crypto: prefix module autoloading
    with "crypto-"") lost the MODULE_ALIAS_CRYPTO() annotation of crc32c.c.
    Add it to fix the reported filesystem related regressions.

    x86,kvm,vmx: Preserve CR4 across VM entry
    
    commit d974baa398f34393db76be45f7d4d04fbdbb4a0a upstream.
    
    CR4 isn't constant; at least the TSD and PCE bits can vary.
    
    TBH, treating CR0 and CR3 as constant scares me a bit, too, but it looks
    like it's correct.
    
    This adds a branch and a read from cr4 to each vm entry.  Because it is
    extremely likely that consecutive entries into the same vcpu will have
    the same host cr4 value, this fixes up the vmcs instead of restoring cr4
    after the fact.  A subsequent patch will add a kernel-wide cr4 shadow,
    reducing the overhead in the common case to just two memory reads and a
    branch.

    smpboot: Add missing get_online_cpus() in smpboot_register_percpu_thread()
    
    commit 4bee96860a65c3a62d332edac331b3cf936ba3ad upstream.
    
    The following race exists in the smpboot percpu threads management:
    
    CPU0                         CPU1
    cpu_up(2)
      get_online_cpus();
      smpboot_create_threads(2);
                                 smpboot_register_percpu_thread();
                                 for_each_online_cpu();
                                   __smpboot_create_thread();
      __cpu_up(2);
    
    This results in a missing per cpu thread for the newly onlined cpu2 and
    in a NULL pointer dereference on a consecutive offline of that cpu.
    
    Proctect smpboot_register_percpu_thread() with get_online_cpus() to
    prevent that.
    
    [ tglx: Massaged changelog and removed the change in
            smpboot_unregister_percpu_thread() because that's an
            optimization and therefor not stable material. ]

    ALSA: ak411x: Fix stall in work callback
    
    commit 4161b4505f1690358ac0a9ee59845a7887336b21 upstream.
    
    When ak4114 work calls its callback and the callback invokes
    ak4114_reinit(), it stalls due to flush_delayed_work().  For avoiding
    this, control the reentrance by introducing a refcount.  Also
    flush_delayed_work() is replaced with cancel_delayed_work_sync().
    
    The exactly same bug is present in ak4113.c and fixed as well.

    ext4: prevent bugon on race between write/fcntl
    
    commit a41537e69b4aa43f0fea02498c2595a81267383b upstream.
    
    O_DIRECT flags can be toggeled via fcntl(F_SETFL). But this value checked
    twice inside ext4_file_write_iter() and __generic_file_write() which
    result in BUG_ON inside ext4_direct_IO.

    arm64: Fix up /proc/cpuinfo
    
    commit 44b82b7700d05a52cd983799d3ecde1a976b3bed upstream.
    
    Commit d7a49086f263164a (arm64: cpuinfo: print info for all CPUs)
    attempted to clean up /proc/cpuinfo, but due to concerns regarding
    further changes was reverted in commit 5e39977edf6500fd (Revert "arm64:
    cpuinfo: print info for all CPUs").
    
    There are two major issues with the arm64 /proc/cpuinfo format
    currently:
    
    * The "Features" line describes (only) the 64-bit hwcaps, which is
      problematic for some 32-bit applications which attempt to parse it. As
      the same names are used for analogous ISA features (e.g. aes) despite
      these generally being architecturally unrelated, it is not possible to
      simply append the 64-bit and 32-bit hwcaps in a manner that might not
      be misleading to some applications.
    
      Various potential solutions have appeared in vendor kernels. Typically
      the format of the Features line varies depending on whether the task
      is 32-bit.
    
    * Information is only printed regarding a single CPU. This does not
      match the ARM format, and does not provide sufficient information in
      big.LITTLE systems where CPUs are heterogeneous. The CPU information
      printed is queried from the current CPU's registers, which is racy
      w.r.t. cross-cpu migration.
    
    This patch attempts to solve these issues. The following changes are
    made:
    
    * When a task with a LINUX32 personality attempts to read /proc/cpuinfo,
      the "Features" line contains the decoded 32-bit hwcaps, as with the
      arm port. Otherwise, the decoded 64-bit hwcaps are shown. This aligns
      with the behaviour of COMPAT_UTS_MACHINE and COMPAT_ELF_PLATFORM. In
      the absense of compat support, the Features line is empty.
    
      The set of hwcaps injected into a task's auxval are unaffected.
    
    * Properties are printed per-cpu, as with the ARM port. The per-cpu
      information is queried from pre-recorded cpu information (as used by
      the sanity checks).
    
    * As with the previous attempt at fixing up /proc/cpuinfo, the hardware
      field is removed. The only users so far are 32-bit applications tied
      to particular boards, so no portable applications should be affected,
      and this should prevent future tying to particular boards.
    
    The following differences remain:
    
    * No model_name is printed, as this cannot be queried from the hardware
      and cannot be provided in a stable fashion. Use of the CPU
      {implementor,variant,part,revision} fields is sufficient to identify a
      CPU and is portable across arm and arm64.
    
    * The following system-wide properties are not provided, as they are not
      possible to provide generally. Programs relying on these are already
      tied to particular (32-bit only) boards:
      - Hardware
      - Revision
      - Serial
    
    No software has yet been identified for which these remaining
    differences are problematic.

           * clear I_SYNC flag after __writeback_single_inode() completed
    
    writeback_sb_inodes() calls do_writepages() for dirty inodes after
    setting I_SYNC flag on inode->i_state.  do_writepages() in turn calls
    nilfs_writepages(), which can run segment constructor and wait for its
    completion.  On the other hand, segment constructor calls iput(), which
    can call evict() and wait for the I_SYNC flag on
    inode_wait_for_writeback().
    
    Since segment constructor doesn't know when I_SYNC will be set, it
    cannot know whether iput() will block or not unless inode->i_nlink has a
    non-zero count.  We can prevent evict() from being called in iput() by
    implementing sop->drop_inode(), but it's not preferable to leave inodes
    with i_nlink == 0 for long periods because it even defers file
    truncation and inode deallocation.  So, this instead resolves the
    deadlock by calling iput() asynchronously with a workqueue for inodes
    with i_nlink == 0.

    lib/checksum.c: fix carry in csum_tcpudp_nofold
    
    commit 150ae0e94634714b23919f0c333fee28a5b199d5 upstream.
    
    The carry from the 64->32bits folding was dropped, e.g with:
    saddr=0xFFFFFFFF daddr=0xFF0000FF len=0xFFFF proto=0 sum=1,
    csum_tcpudp_nofold returned 0 instead of 1.

    mm: pagewalk: call pte_hole() for VM_PFNMAP during walk_page_range
    
    commit 23aaed6659df9adfabe9c583e67a36b54e21df46 upstream.
    
    walk_page_range() silently skips vma having VM_PFNMAP set, which leads
    to undesirable behaviour at client end (who called walk_page_range).
    Userspace applications get the wrong data, so the effect is like just
    confusing users (if the applications just display the data) or sometimes
    killing the processes (if the applications do something with
    misunderstanding virtual addresses due to the wrong data.)
    
    For example for pagemap_read, when no callbacks are called against
    VM_PFNMAP vma, pagemap_read may prepare pagemap data for next virtual
    address range at wrong index.
    
    Eventually userspace may get wrong pagemap data for a task.
    Corresponding to a VM_PFNMAP marked vma region, kernel may report
    mappings from subsequent vma regions.  User space in turn may account
    more pages (than really are) to the task.
    
    In my case I was using procmem, procrack (Android utility) which uses
    pagemap interface to account RSS pages of a task.  Due to this bug it
    was giving a wrong picture for vmas (with VM_PFNMAP set).

    Complete oplock break jobs before closing file handle
    
    commit ca7df8e0bb2a5ec79691de8a1a4c0e611fe04e60 upstream.
    
    Commit
    c11f1df5003d534fd067f0168bfad7befffb3b5c
    requires writers to wait for any pending oplock break handler to
    complete before proceeding to write. This is done by waiting on bit
    CIFS_INODE_PENDING_OPLOCK_BREAK in cifsFileInfo->flags. This bit is
    cleared by the oplock break handler job queued on the workqueue once it
    has completed handling the oplock break allowing writers to proceed with
    writing to the file.
    
    While testing, it was noticed that the filehandle could be closed while
    there is a pending oplock break which results in the oplock break
    handler on the cifsiod workqueue being cancelled before it has had a
    chance to execute and clear the CIFS_INODE_PENDING_OPLOCK_BREAK bit.
    Any subsequent attempt to write to this file hangs waiting for the
    CIFS_INODE_PENDING_OPLOCK_BREAK bit to be cleared.
    
    We fix this by ensuring that we also clear the bit
    CIFS_INODE_PENDING_OPLOCK_BREAK when we remove the oplock break handler
    from the workqueue.
    
    The bug was found by Red Hat QA while testing using ltp's fsstress
    command.

    ARM: 8299/1: mm: ensure local active ASID is marked as allocated on rollover
    
    commit 8e64806672466392acf19e14427d1c29df3e58b9 upstream.
    
    Commit e1a5848e3398 ("ARM: 7924/1: mm: don't bother with reserved ttbr0
    when running with LPAE") removed the use of the reserved TTBR0 value
    for LPAE systems, since the ASID is held in the TTBR and can be updated
    atomicly with the pgd of the next mm.
    
    Unfortunately, this patch forgot to update flush_context, which
    deliberately avoids marking the local active ASID as allocated, since we
    used to switch via ASID zero and didn't need to allocate the ASID of
    the previous mm. The side-effect of this is that we can allocate the
    same ASID to the next mm and, between flushing the local TLB and updating
    TTBR0, we can perform speculative TLB fills for userspace nG mappings
    using the page table of the previous mm.
    
    The consequence of this is that the next mm can erroneously hit some
    mappings of the previous mm. Note that this was made significantly
    harder to hit by a391263cd84e ("ARM: 8203/1: mm: try to re-use old ASID
    assignments following a rollover") but is still theoretically possible.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by removing the code from flush_context
    that forces the allocated ASID to zero for the local CPU. Many thanks
    to the Broadcom guys for tracking this one down.

    MIPS: Fix kernel lockup or crash after CPU offline/online
    
    commit c7754e75100ed5e3068ac5085747f2bfc386c8d6 upstream.
    
    As printk() invocation can cause e.g. a TLB miss, printk() cannot be
    called before the exception handlers have been properly initialized.
    This can happen e.g. when netconsole has been loaded as a kernel module
    and the TLB table has been cleared when a CPU was offline.
    
    Call cpu_report() in start_secondary() only after the exception handlers
    have been initialized to fix this.
    
    Without the patch the kernel will randomly either lockup or crash
    after a CPU is onlined and the console driver is a module.

    MIPS: OCTEON: fix kernel crash when offlining a CPU
    
    commit 63a87fe0d0de2ce126a8cec9a299a133cfd5658e upstream.
    
    octeon_cpu_disable() will unconditionally enable interrupts when called.
    We can assume that the routine is always called with interrupts disabled,
    so just delete the incorrect local_irq_disable/enable().
    
    The patch fixes the following crash when offlining a CPU:

    MIPS: IRQ: Fix disable_irq on CPU IRQs
    
    commit a3e6c1eff54878506b2dddcc202df9cc8180facb upstream.
    
    If the irq_chip does not define .irq_disable, any call to disable_irq
    will defer disabling the IRQ until it fires while marked as disabled.
    This assumes that the handler function checks for this condition, which
    handle_percpu_irq does not. In this case, calling disable_irq leads to
    an IRQ storm, if the interrupt fires while disabled.
    
    This optimization is only useful when disabling the IRQ is slow, which
    is not true for the MIPS CPU IRQ.
    
    Disable this optimization by implementing .irq_disable and .irq_enable
