commit 97129f70b9a32ddf8929daacd2abee36a7f0ddad

    Add file_ns_capable() helper function for open-time capability checking
    
    commit 935d8aabd4331f47a89c3e1daa5779d23cf244ee upstream.
    
    Nothing is using it yet, but this will allow us to delay the open-time
    checks to use time, without breaking the normal UNIX permission
    semantics where permissions are determined by the opener (and the file
    descriptor can then be passed to a different process, or the process can
    drop capabilities).
