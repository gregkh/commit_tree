    usb: cdc-acm: Fix acm_tty_hangup() vs. acm_tty_close() race
    
    [Not upstream s it was fixed differently there for 3.3 with a much more
    "intrusive" rework of the driver - gregkh]
    
    There is a race condition involving acm_tty_hangup() and acm_tty_close()
    where hangup() would attempt to access tty->driver_data without proper
    locking and NULL checking after close() has potentially already set it
    to NULL.  One possibility to (sporadically) trigger this behavior is to
    perform a suspend/resume cycle with a running WWAN data connection.
    
    This patch addresses the issue by introducing a NULL check for
    tty->driver_data in acm_tty_hangup() protected by open_mutex and exiting
    gracefully when hangup() is invoked on a device that has already been
    closed.

    PM / Sleep: Fix race between CPU hotplug and freezer
    
    commit 79cfbdfa87e84992d509e6c1648a18e1d7e68c20 upstream.
    
    The CPU hotplug notifications sent out by the _cpu_up() and _cpu_down()
    functions depend on the value of the 'tasks_frozen' argument passed to them
    (which indicates whether tasks have been frozen or not).
    (Examples for such CPU hotplug notifications: CPU_ONLINE, CPU_ONLINE_FROZEN,
    CPU_DEAD, CPU_DEAD_FROZEN).
    
    Thus, it is essential that while the callbacks for those notifications are
    running, the state of the system with respect to the tasks being frozen or
    not remains unchanged, *throughout that duration*. Hence there is a need for
    synchronizing the CPU hotplug code with the freezer subsystem.
    
    Since the freezer is involved only in the Suspend/Hibernate call paths, this
    patch hooks the CPU hotplug code to the suspend/hibernate notifiers
    PM_[SUSPEND|HIBERNATE]_PREPARE and PM_POST_[SUSPEND|HIBERNATE] to prevent
    the race between CPU hotplug and freezer, thus ensuring that CPU hotplug
    notifications will always be run with the state of the system really being
    what the notifications indicate, _throughout_ their execution time.

    bonding: fix error handling if slave is busy (v2)
    
    commit f7d9821a6a9c83450ac35e76d3709e32fd38b76f upstream.
    
    If slave device already has a receive handler registered, then the
    error unwind of bonding device enslave function is broken.
    
    The following will leave a pointer to freed memory in the slave
    device list, causing a later kernel panic.
    # modprobe dummy
    # ip li add dummy0-1 link dummy0 type macvlan
    # modprobe bonding
    # echo +dummy0 >/sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
    
    The fix is to detach the slave (which removes it from the list)
    in the unwind path.

    OHCI: final fix for NVIDIA problems (I hope)
    
    commit c61875977458637226ab093a35d200f2d5789787 upstream.
    
    Problems with NVIDIA's OHCI host controllers persist.  After looking
    carefully through the spec, I finally realized that when a controller
    is reset it then automatically goes into a SUSPEND state in which it
    is completely quiescent (no DMA and no IRQs) and from which it will
    not awaken until the system puts it into the OPERATIONAL state.
    
    Therefore there's no need to worry about controllers being in the
    RESET state for extended periods, or remaining in the OPERATIONAL
    state during system shutdown.  The proper action for device
    initialization is to put the controller into the RESET state (if it's
    not there already) and then to issue a software reset.  Similarly, the
    proper action for device shutdown is simply to do a software reset.
    
    This patch (as1499) implements such an approach.  It simplifies
    initialization and shutdown, and allows the NVIDIA shutdown-quirk code
    to be removed.

    usb: ch9: fix up MaxStreams helper
    
    commit 18b7ede5f7ee2092aedcb578d3ac30bd5d4fc23c upstream.
    
    [ removed the dwc3 portion of the patch as it didn't apply to
    older kernels - gregkh]
    
    According to USB 3.0 Specification Table 9-22, if
    bmAttributes [4:0] are set to zero, it means "no
    streams supported", but the way this helper was
    defined on Linux, we will *always* have one stream
    which might cause several problems.
    
    For example on DWC3, we would tell the controller
    endpoint has streams enabled and yet start transfers
    with Stream ID set to 0, which would goof up the host
    side.
    
    While doing that, convert the macro to an inline
    function due to the different checks we now need.

    MSM6280 chip.
    
    I needed to also add "options usb-storage quirks=0685:7000:i" in modprobe
    configuration because udevd or the kernel keeps poking the embedded
    fake-cd-rom which fails and causes the device to reset. There might be
    a better way to accomplish the same. usb_modeswitch is not needed with

    xhci: Properly handle COMP_2ND_BW_ERR
    
    commit 71d85724bdd947a3b42a88d08af79f290a1a767b upstream.
    
    I encountered a result of COMP_2ND_BW_ERR while improving how the pwc
    webcam driver handles not having the full usb1 bandwidth available to
    itself.
    
    I created the following test setup, a NEC xhci controller with a
    single TT USB 2 hub plugged into it, with a usb keyboard and a pwc webcam
    plugged into the usb2 hub. This caused the following to show up in dmesg
    when trying to stream from the pwc camera at its highest alt setting:
    
    xhci_hcd 0000:01:00.0: ERROR: unexpected command completion code 0x23.
    usb 6-2.1: Not enough bandwidth for altsetting 9
    
    And usb_set_interface returned -EINVAL, which caused my pwc code to not
    do the right thing as it expected -ENOSPC.
    
    This patch makes the xhci driver properly handle COMP_2ND_BW_ERR and makes
    usb_set_interface return -ENOSPC as expected.
    
    This should be backported to stable kernels as old as 2.6.32.

    usb: fix number of mapped SG DMA entries
    
    commit bc677d5b64644c399cd3db6a905453e611f402ab upstream.
    
    Add a new field num_mapped_sgs to struct urb so that we have a place to
    store the number of mapped entries and can also retain the original
    value of entries in num_sgs.  Previously, usb_hcd_map_urb_for_dma()
    would overwrite this with the number of mapped entries, which would
    break dma_unmap_sg() because it requires the original number of entries.

    usb: musb: fix pm_runtime mismatch
    
    commit 772aed45b604c5ff171f0f12c12392d868333f79 upstream.
    
    In musb_init_controller() there's a pm_runtime_put(), but there's no
    pm_runtime_get(), which creates a mismatch that causes the driver to
    sleep when it shouldn't.
    
    This was introduced in 7acc619[1], but it wasn't triggered in my setup
    until 18a2689[2] was merged to Linus' branch at point df0914[3]. IOW;
    when PM is working as it was supposed to.
    
    However, it seems most of the time this is used in a way that keeps the
    counter above 0, so nobody noticed. Also, it seems to depend on the
    configuration used in versions before 3.1, but not later (or in it).
    
    I found the problem by loading isp1704_charger before any usb gadgets:
    http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1226122
    
    All versions after 2.6.39 are affected.

    We were sending data on the stack when uploading firmware, which causes
    some machines fits, and is not allowed.  Fix this by using the buffer we
    already had around for this very purpose.

    On some failures, the country_code field of an acm structure is freed
    without freeing the acm structure itself.  Elsewhere, operations including

    udf: Fix deadlock when converting file from in-ICB one to normal one
    
    commit d2eb8c359309ec45d6bf5b147303ab8e13be86ea upstream.
    
    During BKL removal in 2.6.38, conversion of files from in-ICB format to normal
    format got broken. We call ->writepage with i_data_sem held but udf_get_block()
    also acquires i_data_sem thus creating A-A deadlock.
    
    We fix the problem by dropping i_data_sem before calling ->writepage() which is
    safe since i_mutex still protects us against any changes in the file. Also fix
    pagelock - i_data_sem lock inversion in udf_expand_file_adinicb() by dropping
    i_data_sem before calling find_or_create_page().

    cgroup: fix to allow mounting a hierarchy by name
    
    commit 0d19ea866562e46989412a0676412fa0983c9ce7 upstream.
    
    If we mount a hierarchy with a specified name, the name is unique,
    and we can use it to mount the hierarchy without specifying its
    set of subsystem names. This feature is documented is
    Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt section 2.3
    
    Here's an example:
    
            # mount -t cgroup -o cpuset,name=myhier xxx /cgroup1
            # mount -t cgroup -o name=myhier xxx /cgroup2
    
    But it was broken by commit 32a8cf235e2f192eb002755076994525cdbaa35a
    (cgroup: make the mount options parsing more accurate)
    
    This fixes the regression.

    ext3: Don't warn from writepage when readonly inode is spotted after error
    
    commit 33c104d415e92a51aaf638dc3d93920cfa601e5c upstream.
    
    WARN_ON_ONCE(IS_RDONLY(inode)) tends to trip when filesystem hits error and is
    remounted read-only. This unnecessarily scares users (well, they should be
    scared because of filesystem error, but the stack trace distracts them from the
    right source of their fear ;-). We could as well just remove the WARN_ON but
    it's not hard to fix it to not trip on filesystem with errors and not use more
    cycles in the common case so that's what we do.

    reiserfs: Force inode evictions before umount to avoid crash
    
    commit a9e36da655e54545c3289b2a0700b5c443de0edd upstream.
    
    This patch fixes a crash in reiserfs_delete_xattrs during umount.
    
    When shrink_dcache_for_umount clears the dcache from
    generic_shutdown_super, delayed evictions are forced to disk. If an
    evicted inode has extended attributes associated with it, it will
    need to walk the xattr tree to locate and remove them.
    
    But since shrink_dcache_for_umount will BUG if it encounters active
    dentries, the xattr tree must be released before it's called or it will
    crash during every umount.
    
    This patch forces the evictions to occur before generic_shutdown_super
    by calling shrink_dcache_sb first. The additional evictions caused
    by the removal of each associated xattr file and dir will be automatically
    handled as they're added to the LRU list.

    commit e4f387d8db3ba3c2dae4d8bdfe7bb5f4fe1bcb0d upstream.
    
    Unpaired calling of probe_hcall_entry and probe_hcall_exit might happen
    as following, which could cause incorrect preempt count.
    
    __trace_hcall_entry => trace_hcall_entry -> probe_hcall_entry =>
    get_cpu_var => preempt_disable
    
    __trace_hcall_exit => trace_hcall_exit -> probe_hcall_exit =>
    put_cpu_var => preempt_enable
    
    where:
    A => B and A -> B means A calls B, but
    => means A will call B through function name, and B will definitely be
    called.
    -> means A will call B through function pointer, so B might not be
    called if the function pointer is not set.
    
    So error happens when only one of probe_hcall_entry and probe_hcall_exit
    get called during a hcall.
    
    This patch tries to move the preempt count operations from
    probe_hcall_entry and probe_hcall_exit to its callers.

    powerpc/time: Handle wrapping of decrementer
    
    commit 37fb9a0231ee43d42d069863bdfd567fca2b61af upstream.
    
    When re-enabling interrupts we have code to handle edge sensitive
    decrementers by resetting the decrementer to 1 whenever it is negative.
    If interrupts were disabled long enough that the decrementer wrapped to
    positive we do nothing. This means interrupts can be delayed for a long
    time until it finally goes negative again.
    
    While we hope interrupts are never be disabled long enough for the
    decrementer to go positive, we have a very good test team that can
    drive any kernel into the ground. The softlockup data we get back
    from these fails could be seconds in the future, completely missing
    the cause of the lockup.
    
    We already keep track of the timebase of the next event so use that
    to work out if we should trigger a decrementer exception.

    An nvs with malformed contents could cause the processing of the

    from happening by adding bound checking.

    offb: Fix setting of the pseudo-palette for >8bpp
    
    commit 1bb0b7d21584b3f878e2bc880db62351ddee5185 upstream.
    
    When using a >8bpp framebuffer, offb advertises truecolor, not directcolor,
    and doesn't touch the color map even if it has a corresponding access method
    for the real hardware.
    
    Thus it needs to set the pseudo-palette with all 3 components of the color,
    like other truecolor framebuffers, not with copies of the color index like
    a directcolor framebuffer would do.
    
    This went unnoticed for a long time because it's pretty hard to get offb
    to kick in with anything but 8bpp (old BootX under MacOS will do that and
    qemu does it).

    Testing on the openSUSE wireless forum has shown that a Linksys
    WUSB54GC v3 with USB ID 1737:0077 works with rt2800usb when the ID is
    written to /sys/.../new_id. This ID can therefore be moved out of UNKNOWN.

    firmware: Fix an oops on reading fw_priv->fw in sysfs loading file
    
    commit eea915bb0d1358755f151eaefb8208a2d5f3e10c upstream.
    
    This oops was reported recently:
    firmware_loading_store+0xf9/0x17b
    dev_attr_store+0x20/0x22
    sysfs_write_file+0x101/0x134
    vfs_write+0xac/0xf3
    sys_write+0x4a/0x6e
    system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
    
    The complete backtrace was unfortunately not captured, but details can be found
    here:
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=769920
    
    The cause is fairly clear.
    
    Its caused by the fact that firmware_loading_store has a case 0 in its
    switch statement that reads and writes the fw_priv->fw poniter without the
    protection of the fw_lock mutex.  since there is a window between the time that
    _request_firmware sets fw_priv->fw to NULL and the time the corresponding sysfs
    file is unregistered, its possible for a user space application to race in, and
    write a zero to the loading file, causing a NULL dereference in
    firmware_loading_store.  Fix it by extending the protection of the fw_lock mutex
    to cover all of the firware_loading_store function.
