    staging: greybus: loopback_test: fix potential path truncations
    
    commit ae62cf5eb2792d9a818c2d93728ed92119357017 upstream.
    
    Newer GCC warns about possible truncations of two generated path names as
    we're concatenating the configurable sysfs and debugfs path prefixes
    with a filename and placing the results in buffers of the same size as
    the maximum length of the prefixes.
    
            snprintf(d->name, MAX_STR_LEN, "gb_loopback%u", dev_id);
    
            snprintf(d->sysfs_entry, MAX_SYSFS_PATH, "%s%s/",
                     t->sysfs_prefix, d->name);
    
            snprintf(d->debugfs_entry, MAX_SYSFS_PATH, "%sraw_latency_%s",
                     t->debugfs_prefix, d->name);
    
    Fix this by separating the maximum path length from the maximum prefix
    length and reducing the latter enough to fit the generated strings.
    
    Note that we also need to reduce the device-name buffer size as GCC
    isn't smart enough to figure out that we ever only used MAX_STR_LEN
    bytes of it.

    commit f16023834863932f95dfad13fac3fc47f77d2f29 upstream.
    
    Newer GCC warns about a possible truncation of a generated sysfs path
    name as we're concatenating a directory path with a file name and
    placing the result in a buffer that is half the size of the maximum
    length of the directory path (which is user controlled).

    nvmet-tcp: set MSG_MORE only if we actually have more to send
    
    commit 98fd5c723730f560e5bea919a64ac5b83d45eb72 upstream.
    
    When we send PDU data, we want to optimize the tcp stack
    operation if we have more data to send. So when we set MSG_MORE
    when:
    - We have more fragments coming in the batch, or
    - We have a more data to send in this PDU
    - We don't have a data digest trailer
    - We optimize with the SUCCESS flag and omit the NVMe completion
      (used if sq_head pointer update is disabled)
    
    This addresses a regression in QD=1 with SUCCESS flag optimization
    as we unconditionally set MSG_MORE when we didn't actually have
    more data to send.

    arm64: smp: fix crash_smp_send_stop() behaviour
    
    commit f50b7dacccbab2b9e3ef18f52a6dcc18ed2050b9 upstream.
    
    On a system configured to trigger a crash_kexec() reboot, when only one CPU
    is online and another CPU panics while starting-up, crash_smp_send_stop()
    will fail to send any STOP message to the other already online core,
    resulting in fail to freeze and registers not properly saved.
    
    Moreover even if the proper messages are sent (case CPUs > 2)
    it will similarly fail to account for the booting CPU when executing
    the final stop wait-loop, so potentially resulting in some CPU not
    been waited for shutdown before rebooting.
    
    A tangible effect of this behaviour can be observed when, after a panic
    with kexec enabled and loaded, on the following reboot triggered by kexec,
    the cpu that could not be successfully stopped fails to come back online:

    union struct members, but forgot to adjust the hash function accordingly,
    
    As a result the hashing omits the leading 64bit and even hashes beyond the
    futex key causing a bad hash distribution which led to a ~100% performance
    regression.
    
    Hand in the futex key pointer instead of a random struct member and make
    the size calculation based of the struct offset.

    futex: Fix inode life-time issue
    
    commit 8019ad13ef7f64be44d4f892af9c840179009254 upstream.
    
    As reported by Jann, ihold() does not in fact guarantee inode
    persistence. And instead of making it so, replace the usage of inode
    pointers with a per boot, machine wide, unique inode identifier.
    
    This sequence number is global, but shared (file backed) futexes are
    rare enough that this should not become a performance issue.

    x86/mm: split vmalloc_sync_all()
    
    commit 763802b53a427ed3cbd419dbba255c414fdd9e7c upstream.
    
    Commit 3f8fd02b1bf1 ("mm/vmalloc: Sync unmappings in
    __purge_vmap_area_lazy()") introduced a call to vmalloc_sync_all() in
    the vunmap() code-path.  While this change was necessary to maintain
    correctness on x86-32-pae kernels, it also adds additional cycles for
    architectures that don't need it.
    
    Specifically on x86-64 with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y some people reported
    severe performance regressions in micro-benchmarks because it now also
    calls the x86-64 implementation of vmalloc_sync_all() on vunmap().  But
    the vmalloc_sync_all() implementation on x86-64 is only needed for newly
    created mappings.
    
    To avoid the unnecessary work on x86-64 and to gain the performance
    back, split up vmalloc_sync_all() into two functions:
    
            * vmalloc_sync_mappings(), and
            * vmalloc_sync_unmappings()
    
    Most call-sites to vmalloc_sync_all() only care about new mappings being
    synchronized.  The only exception is the new call-site added in the
    above mentioned commit.
    
    Shile Zhang directed us to a report of an 80% regression in reaim
    throughput.

    This is a PowerPC platform with following NUMA topology:
    
      available: 2 nodes (0-1)
      node 0 cpus:
      node 0 size: 0 MB
      node 0 free: 0 MB
      node 1 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
      node 1 size: 35247 MB
      node 1 free: 30907 MB
      node distances:
      node   0   1
        0:  10  40
        1:  40  10
    
      possible numa nodes: 0-31
    
    This only happens with a mmotm patch "mm/memcontrol.c: allocate
    shrinker_map on appropriate NUMA node" [2] which effectively calls
    kmalloc_node for each possible node.  SLUB however only allocates
    kmem_cache_node on online N_NORMAL_MEMORY nodes, and relies on
    node_to_mem_node to return such valid node for other nodes since commit
    a561ce00b09e ("slub: fall back to node_to_mem_node() node if allocating
    on memoryless node").  This is however not true in this configuration
    where the _node_numa_mem_ array is not initialized for nodes 0 and 2-31,
    thus it contains zeroes and get_partial() ends up accessing
    non-allocated kmem_cache_node.
    
    A related issue was reported by Bharata (originally by Ramachandran) [3]
    where a similar PowerPC configuration, but with mainline kernel without
    patch [2] ends up allocating large amounts of pages by kmalloc-1k
    kmalloc-512.  This seems to have the same underlying issue with
    node_to_mem_node() not behaving as expected, and might probably also
    lead to an infinite loop with CONFIG_SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL [4].
    
    This patch should fix both issues by not relying on node_to_mem_node()
    anymore and instead simply falling back to NUMA_NO_NODE, when
    kmalloc_node(node) is attempted for a node that's not online, or has no
    usable memory.  The "usable memory" condition is also changed from
    node_present_pages() to N_NORMAL_MEMORY node state, as that is exactly
    the condition that SLUB uses to allocate kmem_cache_node structures.
    The check in get_partial() is removed completely, as the checks in
    ___slab_alloc() are now sufficient to prevent get_partial() being
    reached with an invalid node.

    mm: slub: be more careful about the double cmpxchg of freelist
    
    commit 5076190daded2197f62fe92cf69674488be44175 upstream.
    
    This is just a cleanup addition to Jann's fix to properly update the
    transaction ID for the slub slowpath in commit fd4d9c7d0c71 ("mm: slub:
    add missing TID bump..").
    
    The transaction ID is what protects us against any concurrent accesses,
    but we should really also make sure to make the 'freelist' comparison
    itself always use the same freelist value that we then used as the new
    next free pointer.
    
    Jann points out that if we do all of this carefully, we could skip the
    transaction ID update for all the paths that only remove entries from
    the lists, and only update the TID when adding entries (to avoid the ABA
    issue with cmpxchg and list handling re-adding a previously seen value).
    
    But this patch just does the "make sure to cmpxchg the same value we
    used" rather than then try to be clever.

    epoll: fix possible lost wakeup on epoll_ctl() path
    
    commit 1b53734bd0b2feed8e7761771b2e76fc9126ea0c upstream.
    
    This fixes possible lost wakeup introduced by commit a218cc491420.
    Originally modifications to ep->wq were serialized by ep->wq.lock, but
    in commit a218cc491420 ("epoll: use rwlock in order to reduce
    ep_poll_callback() contention") a new rw lock was introduced in order to
    relax fd event path, i.e. callers of ep_poll_callback() function.
    
    After the change ep_modify and ep_insert (both are called on epoll_ctl()
    path) were switched to ep->lock, but ep_poll (epoll_wait) was using
    ep->wq.lock on wqueue list modification.
    
    The bug doesn't lead to any wqueue list corruptions, because wake up
    path and list modifications were serialized by ep->wq.lock internally,
    but actual waitqueue_active() check prior wake_up() call can be
    reordered with modifications of ep ready list, thus wake up can be lost.
    
    And yes, can be healed by explicit smp_mb():
    
      list_add_tail(&epi->rdlink, &ep->rdllist);
      smp_mb();
      if (waitqueue_active(&ep->wq))
            wake_up(&ep->wp);
    
    But let's make it simple, thus current patch replaces ep->wq.lock with
    the ep->lock for wqueue modifications, thus wake up path always observes
    activeness of the wqueue correcty.

    mm: do not allow MADV_PAGEOUT for CoW pages
    
    commit 12e967fd8e4e6c3d275b4c69c890adc838891300 upstream.
    
    Jann has brought up a very interesting point [1].  While shared pages
    are excluded from MADV_PAGEOUT normally, CoW pages can be easily
    reclaimed that way.  This can lead to all sorts of hard to debug
    problems.  E.g.  performance problems outlined by Daniel [2].
    
    There are runtime environments where there is a substantial memory
    shared among security domains via CoW memory and a easy to reclaim way
    of that memory, which MADV_{COLD,PAGEOUT} offers, can lead to either
    performance degradation in for the parent process which might be more
    privileged or even open side channel attacks.
    
    The feasibility of the latter is not really clear to me TBH but there is
    no real reason for exposure at this stage.  It seems there is no real
    use case to depend on reclaiming CoW memory via madvise at this stage so
    it is much easier to simply disallow it and this is what this patch

    mm/hotplug: fix hot remove failure in SPARSEMEM|!VMEMMAP case
    
    commit d41e2f3bd54699f85b3d6f45abd09fa24a222cb9 upstream.
    
    In section_deactivate(), pfn_to_page() doesn't work any more after
    ms->section_mem_map is resetting to NULL in SPARSEMEM|!VMEMMAP case.  It
    causes a hot remove failure:

    mm, memcg: throttle allocators based on ancestral memory.high
    
    commit e26733e0d0ec6798eca93daa300bc3f43616127f upstream.
    
    Prior to this commit, we only directly check the affected cgroup's
    memory.high against its usage.  However, it's possible that we are being
    reclaimed as a result of hitting an ancestor memory.high and should be
    penalised based on that, instead.
    
    This patch changes memory.high overage throttling to use the largest
    overage in its ancestors when considering how many penalty jiffies to
    charge.  This makes sure that we penalise poorly behaving cgroups in the
    same way regardless of at what level of the hierarchy memory.high was
    breached.

    mm, memcg: fix corruption on 64-bit divisor in memory.high throttling
    
    commit d397a45fc741c80c32a14e2de008441e9976f50c upstream.
    
    Commit 0e4b01df8659 had a bunch of fixups to use the right division
    method.  However, it seems that after all that it still wasn't right --
    div_u64 takes a 32-bit divisor.
    
    The headroom is still large (2^32 pages), so on mundane systems you
    won't hit this, but this should definitely be fixed.

    commit 7d36665a5886c27ca4c4d0afd3ecc50b400f3587 upstream.

    are deleted, another eventfd monitors the memory threshold of this cgroup,
    leading to a crash:

    We can reproduce this problem in the following ways:
    
    1. We create a new cgroup subdirectory and a new eventfd, and then we
       monitor multiple memory thresholds of the cgroup through this eventfd.
    
    2.  closing this eventfd, and __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event ()
       will be called multiple times to delete all events related to this
       eventfd.
    
    The first time __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event() is called, the
    kernel will clear all items related to this eventfd in thresholds->
    primary.
    
    Since there is currently only one eventfd, thresholds-> primary becomes
    empty, so the kernel will set thresholds-> primary and hresholds-> spare
    to NULL.  If at this time, the user creates a new eventfd and monitor
    the memory threshold of this cgroup, kernel will re-initialize
    thresholds-> primary.
    
    Then when __mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event () is called for the
    second time, because thresholds-> primary is not empty, the system will
    access thresholds-> spare, but thresholds-> spare is NULL, which will
    trigger a crash.
    
    In general, the longer it takes to delete all events related to this
    eventfd, the easier it is to trigger this problem.
    
    The solution is to check whether the thresholds associated with the
    eventfd has been cleared when deleting the event.  If so, we do nothing.

    btrfs: fix log context list corruption after rename whiteout error
    
    commit 236ebc20d9afc5e9ff52f3cf3f365a91583aac10 upstream.
    
    During a rename whiteout, if btrfs_whiteout_for_rename() returns an error
    we can end up returning from btrfs_rename() with the log context object
    still in the root's log context list - this happens if 'sync_log' was
    set to true before we called btrfs_whiteout_for_rename() and it is
    dangerous because we end up with a corrupt linked list (root->log_ctxs)
    as the log context object was allocated on the stack.
    
    After btrfs_rename() returns, any task that is running btrfs_sync_log()
    concurrently can end up crashing because that linked list is traversed by
    btrfs_sync_log() (through btrfs_remove_all_log_ctxs()). That results in
    the same issue that commit e6c617102c7e4 ("Btrfs: fix log context list
    corruption after rename exchange operation") fixed.

    xhci: Do not open code __print_symbolic() in xhci trace events
    
    commit 045706bff837ee89c13f1ace173db71922c1c40b upstream.
    
    libtraceevent (used by perf and trace-cmd) failed to parse the
    xhci_urb_dequeue trace event. This is because the user space trace
    event format parsing is not a full C compiler. It can handle some basic
    logic, but is not meant to be able to handle everything C can do.
    
    In cases where a trace event field needs to be converted from a number
    to a string, there's the __print_symbolic() macro that should be used:
    
     See samples/trace_events/trace-events-sample.h
    
    Some xhci trace events open coded the __print_symbolic() causing the
    user spaces tools to fail to parse it. This has to be replaced with
    __print_symbolic() instead.

    modpost: move the namespace field in Module.symvers last
    
    commit 5190044c2965514a973184ca68ef5fad57a24670 upstream.
    
    In order to preserve backwards compatability with kmod tools, we have to
    move the namespace field in Module.symvers last, as the depmod -e -E
    option looks at the first three fields in Module.symvers to check symbol
    versions (and it's expected they stay in the original order of crc,
    symbol, module).
    
    In addition, update an ancient comment above read_dump() in modpost that
    suggested that the export type field in Module.symvers was optional. I
    suspect that there were historical reasons behind that comment that are
    no longer accurate. We have been unconditionally printing the export
    type since 2.6.18 (commit bd5cbcedf44), which is over a decade ago now.
    
    Fix up read_dump() to treat each field as non-optional. I suspect the
    original read_dump() code treated the export field as optional in order
    to support pre <= 2.6.18 Module.symvers (which did not have the export
    type field). Note that although symbol namespaces are optional, the
    field will not be omitted from Module.symvers if a symbol does not have
    a namespace. In this case, the field will simply be empty and the next
    delimiter or end of line will follow.

    get_char was erroneously given the address of the pointer to the text

    kbuild: Disable -Wpointer-to-enum-cast
    
    commit 82f2bc2fcc0160d6f82dd1ac64518ae0a4dd183f upstream.
    
    Clang's -Wpointer-to-int-cast deviates from GCC in that it warns when
    casting to enums. The kernel does this in certain places, such as device
    tree matches to set the version of the device being used, which allows
    the kernel to avoid using a gigantic union.
    
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5.8/source/drivers/ata/ahci_brcm.c#L428
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5.8/source/drivers/ata/ahci_brcm.c#L402
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.5.8/source/include/linux/mod_devicetable.h#L264
    
    To avoid a ton of false positive warnings, disable this particular part
    of the warning, which has been split off into a separate diagnostic so
    that the entire warning does not need to be turned off for clang. It
    will be visible under W=1 in case people want to go about fixing these
    easily and enabling the warning treewide.

    Set the SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN quirk flag. Otherwise, the

    I split the platform data to give no impact to other platforms,
    although the UniPhier platform is currently only the upstream user
    of this IP.
    
    The SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN flag is set if the compatible
    string matches to "socionext,uniphier-sd4hc".

    SAMA5D2x doesn't drive CMD line if GPIO is used as CD line (at least

    iio: light: vcnl4000: update sampling periods for vcnl4040
    
    commit 2ca5a8792d617b4035aacd0a8be527f667fbf912 upstream.
    
    Vishay has published a new version of "Designing the VCNL4200 Into an
    Application" application note in October 2019. The new version specifies
    that there is +-20% of part to part tolerance. Although the application
    note is related to vcnl4200, according to support the vcnl4040's "ASIC
    is quite similar to that one for the VCNL4200".
    
    So update the sampling periods (and comment), including the correct
    sampling period for proximity. Both sampling periods are lower. Users
    relying on the blocking behaviour of reading will get proximity
    measurements much earlier.

    that there is +-20% of part to part tolerance. This explains the drift
    seen during experiments. The proximity pulse width is also changed from
    32us to 30us. According to the support, the tolerance also applies to
    ambient light.
    
    So update the sampling periods. As the reading is blocking, current
    users may notice slightly longer response time.

    iio: trigger: stm32-timer: disable master mode when stopping
    
    commit 29e8c8253d7d5265f58122c0a7902e26df6c6f61 upstream.
    
    Master mode should be disabled when stopping. This mainly impacts
    possible other use-case after timer has been stopped. Currently,
    master mode remains set (from start routine).

    tty: fix compat TIOCGSERIAL checking wrong function ptr
    
    commit 6e622cd8bd888c7fa3ee2b7dfb3514ab53b21570 upstream.
    
    Commit 77654350306a ("take compat TIOC[SG]SERIAL treatment into
    tty_compat_ioctl()") changed the compat version of TIOCGSERIAL to start
    checking for the presence of the ->set_serial function pointer rather
    than ->get_serial.  This appears to be a copy-and-paste error, since
    ->get_serial is the function pointer that is called as well as the
    pointer that is checked by the non-compat version of TIOCGSERIAL.
    
    Fix this by checking the correct function pointer.

    commit 5461e0530c222129dfc941058be114b5cbc00837 upstream.
    
    The return value checks in snd_pcm_plug_alloc() are covered with
    snd_BUG_ON() macro that may trigger a kernel WARNING depending on the
    kconfig.  But since the error condition can be triggered by a weird
    user space parameter passed to OSS layer, we shouldn't give the kernel
    stack trace just for that.  As it's a normal error condition, let's
    remove snd_BUG_ON() macro usage there.

    ALSA: pcm: oss: Avoid plugin buffer overflow
    
    commit f2ecf903ef06eb1bbbfa969db9889643d487e73a upstream.
    
    Each OSS PCM plugins allocate its internal buffer per pre-calculation
    of the max buffer size through the chain of plugins (calling
    src_frames and dst_frames callbacks).  This works for most plugins,
    but the rate plugin might behave incorrectly.  The calculation in the
    rate plugin involves with the fractional position, i.e. it may vary
    depending on the input position.  Since the buffer size
    pre-calculation is always done with the offset zero, it may return a
    shorter size than it might be; this may result in the out-of-bound
    access as spotted by fuzzer.
    
    This patch addresses those possible buffer overflow accesses by simply
    setting the upper limit per the given buffer size for each plugin
    before src_frames() and after dst_frames() calls.

    commit 4384f167ce5fa7241b61bb0984d651bc528ddebe upstream.
    
    The virmidi driver handles sysex event exceptionally in a short-cut
    snd_seq_dump_var_event() call, but this missed the reset of the
    running status.  As a result, it may lead to an incomplete command
    right after the sysex when an event with the same running status was
    queued.
    
    Fix it by clearing the running status properly via alling
    snd_midi_event_reset_decode() for that code path.

    ALSA: line6: Fix endless MIDI read loop
    
    commit d683469b3c93d7e2afd39e6e1970f24700eb7a68 upstream.
    
    The MIDI input event parser of the LINE6 driver may enter into an
    endless loop when the unexpected data sequence is given, as it tries
    to continue the secondary bytes without termination.  Also, when the
    input data is too short, the parser returns a negative error, while
    the caller doesn't handle it properly.  This would lead to the
    unexpected behavior as well.
    
    This patch addresses those issues by checking the return value
    correctly and handling the one-byte event in the parser properly.
    
    The bug was reported by syzkaller.

    USB: cdc-acm: fix rounding error in TIOCSSERIAL
    
    commit b401f8c4f492cbf74f3f59c9141e5be3071071bb upstream.
    
    By default, tty_port_init() initializes those parameters to a multiple
    of HZ. For instance in line 69 of tty_port.c:
       port->close_delay = (50 * HZ) / 100;
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/tty/tty_port.c#L69
    
    With e.g. CONFIG_HZ = 250 (as this is the case for Ubuntu 18.04
    linux-image-4.15.0-37-generic), the default setting for close_delay is
    thus 125.
    
    When ioctl(fd, TIOCGSERIAL, &s) is executed, the setting returned in
    user space is '12' (125/10). When ioctl(fd, TIOCSSERIAL, &s) is then
    executed with the same setting '12', the value is interpreted as '120'
    which is different from the current setting and a EPERM error may be
    raised by set_serial_info() if !CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

    usb: quirks: add NO_LPM quirk for RTL8153 based ethernet adapters
    
    commit 75d7676ead19b1fbb5e0ee934c9ccddcb666b68c upstream.
    
    We have been receiving bug reports that ethernet connections over
    RTL8153 based ethernet adapters stops working after a while with
    errors like these showing up in dmesg when the ethernet stops working:
    
    [12696.189484] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    [12702.333456] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    [12707.965422] r8152 6-1:1.0 enp10s0u1: Tx timeout
    
    This has been reported on Dell WD15 docks, Belkin USB-C Express Dock 3.1
    docks and with generic USB to ethernet dongles using the RTL8153
    chipsets. Some users have tried adding usbcore.quirks=0bda:8153:k to
    the kernel commandline and all users who have tried this report that
    this fixes this.
    
    Also note that we already have an existing NO_LPM quirk for the RTL8153
    used in the Microsoft Surface Dock (where it uses a different usb-id).
    
    This commit adds a NO_LPM quirk for the generic Realtek RTL8153
    0bda:8153 usb-id, fixing the Tx timeout errors on these devices.

    USB: Disable LPM on WD19's Realtek Hub
    
    commit b63e48fb50e1ca71db301ca9082befa6f16c55c4 upstream.
    
    Realtek Hub (0bda:0x0487) used in Dell Dock WD19 sometimes drops off the
    bus when bringing underlying ports from U3 to U0.
    
    Disabling LPM on the hub during setting link state is not enough, so
    let's disable LPM completely for this hub.

    binderfs: use refcount for binder control devices too
    
    [ Upstream commit 211b64e4b5b6bd5fdc19cd525c2cc9a90e6b0ec9 ]
    
    Binderfs binder-control devices are cleaned up via binderfs_evict_inode
    too() which will use refcount_dec_and_test(). However, we missed to set
    the refcount for binderfs binder-control devices and so we underflowed
    when the binderfs instance got unmounted. Pretty obvious oversight and
    should have been part of the more general UAF fix. The good news is that
    having test cases (suprisingly) helps.
    
    Technically, we could detect that we're about to cleanup the
    binder-control dentry in binderfs_evict_inode() and then simply clean it
    up. But that makes the assumption that the binder driver itself will
    never make use of a binderfs binder-control device after the binderfs
    instance it belongs to has been unmounted and the superblock for it been
    destroyed. While it is unlikely to ever come to this let's be on the
    safe side. Performance-wise this also really doesn't matter since the
    binder-control device is only every really when creating the binderfs
    filesystem or creating additional binder devices. Both operations are
    pretty rare.
    
    Fixes: f0fe2c0f050d ("binder: prevent UAF for binderfs devices II")

    block, bfq: fix overwrite of bfq_group pointer in bfq_find_set_group()
    
    [ Upstream commit 14afc59361976c0ba39e3a9589c3eaa43ebc7e1d ]
    
    The bfq_find_set_group() function takes as input a blkcg (which represents
    a cgroup) and retrieves the corresponding bfq_group, then it updates the
    bfq internal group hierarchy (see comments inside the function for why
    this is needed) and finally it returns the bfq_group.
    In the hierarchy update cycle, the pointer holding the correct bfq_group
    that has to be returned is mistakenly used to traverse the hierarchy
    bottom to top, meaning that in each iteration it gets overwritten with the
    parent of the current group. Since the update cycle stops at root's
    children (depth = 2), the overwrite becomes a problem only if the blkcg
    describes a cgroup at a hierarchy level deeper than that (depth > 2). In
    this case the root's child that happens to be also an ancestor of the
    correct bfq_group is returned. The main consequence is that processes
    contained in a cgroup at depth greater than 2 are wrongly placed in the
    group described above by BFQ.
    
    This commits fixes this problem by using a different bfq_group pointer in
    the update cycle in order to avoid the overwrite of the variable holding
    the original group reference.

    drm/amd/display: fix dcc swath size calculations on dcn1
    
    [ Upstream commit a0275dfc82c9034eefbeffd556cca6dd239d7925 ]
    
    [Why]
    Swath sizes are being calculated incorrectly. The horizontal swath size
    should be the product of block height, viewport width, and bytes per
    element, but the calculation uses viewport height instead of width. The
    vertical swath size is similarly incorrectly calculated. The effect of
    this is that we report the wrong DCC caps.
    
    [How]
    Use viewport width in the horizontal swath size calculation and viewport
    height in the vertical swath size calculation.

    drm/amdgpu: clean wptr on wb when gpu recovery
    
    [ Upstream commit 2ab7e274b86739f4ceed5d94b6879f2d07b2802f ]
    
    The TDR will be randomly failed due to compute ring
    test failure. If the compute ring wptr & 0x7ff(ring_buf_mask)
    is 0x100 then after map mqd the compute ring rptr will be
    synced with 0x100. And the ring test packet size is also 0x100.
    Then after invocation of amdgpu_ring_commit, the cp will not
    really handle the packet on the ring buffer because rptr is equal to wptr.

    ASoC: stm32: sai: manage rebind issue
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d6defc7e0e437a9fd53622f7fd85740f38d5693 ]
    
    The commit e894efef9ac7 ("ASoC: core: add support to card rebind")
    allows to rebind the sound card after a rebind of one of its component.
    With this commit, the sound card is actually rebound,
    but may be no more functional. The following problems have been seen
    with STM32 SAI driver.
    
    1) DMA channel is not requested:
    
    With the sound card rebind the simplified call sequence is:
    stm32_sai_sub_probe
            snd_soc_register_component
                    snd_soc_try_rebind_card
                            snd_soc_instantiate_card
            devm_snd_dmaengine_pcm_register
    
    The problem occurs because the pcm must be registered,
    before snd_soc_instantiate_card() is called.
    
    Modify SAI driver, to change the call sequence as follows:
    stm32_sai_sub_probe
            devm_snd_dmaengine_pcm_register
            snd_soc_register_component
                    snd_soc_try_rebind_card
    
    2) DMA channel is not released:
    
    dma_release_channel() is not called when
    devm_dmaengine_pcm_release() is executed.
    This occurs because SND_DMAENGINE_PCM_DRV_NAME component,
    has already been released through devm_component_release().
    
    devm_dmaengine_pcm_release() should be called before
    devm_component_release() to avoid this problem.
    
    Call snd_dmaengine_pcm_unregister() and snd_soc_unregister_component()
    explicitly from SAI driver, to have the right sequence.

    riscv: avoid the PIC offset of static percpu data in module beyond 2G limits
    
    [ Upstream commit 0cff8bff7af886af0923d5c91776cd51603e531f ]
    
    The compiler uses the PIC-relative method to access static variables
    instead of GOT when the code model is PIC. Therefore, the limitation of
    the access range from the instruction to the symbol address is +-2GB.
    Under this circumstance, the kernel cannot load a kernel module if this
    module has static per-CPU symbols declared by DEFINE_PER_CPU(). The reason
    is that kernel relocates the .data..percpu section of the kernel module to
    the end of kernel's .data..percpu. Hence, the distance between the per-CPU
    symbols and the instruction will exceed the 2GB limits. To solve this
    problem, the kernel should place the loaded module in the memory area
    [&_end-2G, VMALLOC_END].

    dm integrity: use dm_bio_record and dm_bio_restore
    
    [ Upstream commit 248aa2645aa7fc9175d1107c2593cc90d4af5a4e ]
    
    In cases where dec_in_flight() has to requeue the integrity_bio_wait
    work to transfer the rest of the data, the bio's __bi_remaining might
    already have been decremented to 0, e.g.: if bio passed to underlying
    data device was split via blk_queue_split().
    
    Use dm_bio_{record,restore} rather than effectively open-coding them in
    dm-integrity -- these methods now manage __bi_remaining too.

    altera-stapl: altera_get_note: prevent write beyond end of 'key'
    
    [ Upstream commit 3745488e9d599916a0b40d45d3f30e3d4720288e ]
    
    altera_get_note is called from altera_init, where key is kzalloc(33).
    
    When the allocation functions are annotated to allow the compiler to see
    the sizes of objects, and with FORTIFY_SOURCE, we see:
    
    In file included from drivers/misc/altera-stapl/altera.c:14:0:
    In function ‘strlcpy’,
        inlined from ‘altera_init’ at drivers/misc/altera-stapl/altera.c:2189:5:
    include/linux/string.h:378:4: error: call to ‘__write_overflow’ declared with attribute error: detected write beyond size of object passed as 1st parameter
        __write_overflow();
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    That refers to this code in altera_get_note:
    
        if (key != NULL)
                strlcpy(key, &p[note_strings +
                                get_unaligned_be32(
                                &p[note_table + (8 * i)])],
                        length);
    
    The error triggers because the length of 'key' is 33, but the copy
    uses length supplied as the 'length' parameter, which is always
    256. Split the size parameter into key_len and val_len, and use the
    appropriate length depending on what is being copied.
    
    Detected by compiler error, only compile-tested.

    adding a call to clk_get() with legacy clock name. This fixes following
    kernel oops if driver is loaded as module:

    spi/zynqmp: remove entry that causes a cs glitch
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dd8304981ecffa77bb72b1c57c4be5dfe6cfae9 ]
    
    In the public interface for chipselect, there is always an entry
    commented as "Dummy generic FIFO entry" pushed down to the fifo right
    after the activate/deactivate command. The dummy entry is 0x0,
    irregardless if the intention was to activate or deactive the cs. This
    causes the cs line to glitch rather than beeing activated in the case
    when there was an activate command.
    
    This has been observed on oscilloscope, and have caused problems for at
    least one specific flash device type connected to the qspi port. After
    the change the glitch is gone and cs goes active when intended.
    
    The reason why this worked before (except for the glitch) was because
    when sending the actual data, the CS bits are once again set. Since
    most flashes uses mode 0, there is always a half clk period anyway for
    cs to clk active setup time. If someone would rely on timing from a
    chip_select call to a transfer_one, it would fail though.
    
    It is unknown why the dummy entry was there in the first place, git log
    seems to be of no help in this case. The reference manual gives no
    indication of the necessity of this. In fact the lower 8 bits are a
    setup (or hold in case of deactivate) time expressed in cycles. So this
    should not be needed to fulfill any setup/hold timings.

    spi: pxa2xx: Add CS control clock quirk
    
    [ Upstream commit 683f65ded66a9a7ff01ed7280804d2132ebfdf7e ]
    
    In some circumstances on Intel LPSS controllers, toggling the LPSS
    CS control register doesn't actually cause the CS line to toggle.
    This seems to be failure of dynamic clock gating that occurs after
    going through a suspend/resume transition, where the controller
    is sent through a reset transition. This ruins SPI transactions
    that either rely on delay_usecs, or toggle the CS line without
    sending data.
    
    Whenever CS is toggled, momentarily set the clock gating register
    to "Force On" to poke the controller into acting on CS.

    [ Upstream commit 27f13774654ea6bd0b6fc9b97cce8d19e5735661 ]
    
    'dma-ranges' in a PCI bridge node does correctly set dma masks for PCI
    devices not described in the DT. Certain DRA7 platforms (e.g., DRA76)
    has RAM above 32-bit boundary (accessible with LPAE config) though the
    PCIe bridge will be able to access only 32-bits. Add 'dma-ranges'

    locks: reinstate locks_delete_block optimization
    
    [ Upstream commit dcf23ac3e846ca0cf626c155a0e3fcbbcf4fae8a ]
    
    There is measurable performance impact in some synthetic tests due to
    commit 6d390e4b5d48 (locks: fix a potential use-after-free problem when
    wakeup a waiter). Fix the race condition instead by clearing the
    fl_blocker pointer after the wake_up, using explicit acquire/release
    semantics.
    
    This does mean that we can no longer use the clearing of fl_blocker as
    the wait condition, so switch the waiters over to checking whether the
    fl_blocked_member list_head is empty.
