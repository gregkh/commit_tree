    ext4: fix fencepost in s_first_meta_bg validation
    
    commit 2ba3e6e8afc9b6188b471f27cf2b5e3cf34e7af2 upstream.
    
    It is OK for s_first_meta_bg to be equal to the number of block group
    descriptor blocks.  (It rarely happens, but it shouldn't cause any
    problems.)

    cgroup/pids: remove spurious suspicious RCU usage warning
    
    commit 1d18c2747f937f1b5ec65ce6bf4ccb9ca1aea9e8 upstream.
    
    pids_can_fork() is special in that the css association is guaranteed
    to be stable throughout the function and thus doesn't need RCU
    protection around task_css access.  When determining the css to charge
    the pid, task_css_check() is used to override the RCU sanity check.
    
    While adding a warning message on fork rejection from pids limit,
    135b8b37bd91 ("cgroup: Add pids controller event when fork fails
    because of pid limit") incorrectly added a task_css access which is
    neither RCU protected or explicitly annotated.  This triggers the
    following suspicious RCU usage warning when RCU debugging is enabled.

    scsi: libiscsi: add lock around task lists to fix list corruption regression
    
    commit 6f8830f5bbab16e54f261de187f3df4644a5b977 upstream.
    
    There's a rather long standing regression from the commit "libiscsi:
    Reduce locking contention in fast path"
    
    Depending on iSCSI target behavior, it's possible to hit the case in
    iscsi_complete_task where the task is still on a pending list
    (!list_empty(&task->running)).  When that happens the task is removed
    from the list while holding the session back_lock, but other task list
    modification occur under the frwd_lock.  That leads to linked list
    corruption and eventually a panicked system.
    
    Rather than back out the session lock split entirely, in order to try
    and keep some of the performance gains this patch adds another lock to
    maintain the task lists integrity.
    
    Major enterprise supported kernels have been backing out the lock split
    for while now, thanks to the efforts at IBM where a lab setup has the
    most reliable reproducer I've seen on this issue.  This patch has been
    tested there successfully.

    commit a04e54f2c35823ca32d56afcd5cea5b783e2f51a upstream.
    
    The following fixes a divide by zero OOPs with TYPE_TAPE
    due to pscsi_tape_read_blocksize() failing causing a zero
    sd->sector_size being propigated up via dev_attrib.hw_block_size.
    
    It also fixes another long-standing bug where TYPE_TAPE and
    TYPE_MEDIMUM_CHANGER where using pscsi_create_type_other(),
    which does not call scsi_device_get() to take the device
    reference.  Instead, rename pscsi_create_type_rom() to
    pscsi_create_type_nondisk() and use it for all cases.
    
    Finally, also drop a dump_stack() in pscsi_get_blocks() for
    non TYPE_DISK, which in modern target-core can get invoked
    via target_sense_desc_format() during CHECK_CONDITION.

    md/raid1/10: fix potential deadlock
    
    commit 61eb2b43b99ebdc9bc6bc83d9792257b243e7cb3 upstream.
    
    Neil Brown pointed out a potential deadlock in raid 10 code with
    bio_split/chain. The raid1 code could have the same issue, but recent
    barrier rework makes it less likely to happen. The deadlock happens in
    below sequence:
    
    1. generic_make_request(bio), this will set current->bio_list
    2. raid10_make_request will split bio to bio1 and bio2
    3. __make_request(bio1), wait_barrer, add underlayer disk bio to
    current->bio_list
    4. __make_request(bio2), wait_barrer
    
    If raise_barrier happens between 3 & 4, since wait_barrier runs at 3,
    raise_barrier waits for IO completion from 3. And since raise_barrier
    sets barrier, 4 waits for raise_barrier. But IO from 3 can't be
    dispatched because raid10_make_request() doesn't finished yet.
    
    The solution is to adjust the IO ordering. Quotes from Neil:
    "
    It is much safer to:
    
        if (need to split) {
            split = bio_split(bio, ...)
            bio_chain(...)
            make_request_fn(split);
            generic_make_request(bio);
       } else
            make_request_fn(mddev, bio);
    
    This way we first process the initial section of the bio (in 'split')
    which will queue some requests to the underlying devices.  These
    requests will be queued in generic_make_request.
    Then we queue the remainder of the bio, which will be added to the end
    of the generic_make_request queue.
    Then we return.
    generic_make_request() will pop the lower-level device requests off the
    queue and handle them first.  Then it will process the remainder
    of the original bio once the first section has been fully processed.
    "
    
    Note, this only happens in read path. In write path, the bio is flushed to
    underlaying disks either by blk flush (from schedule) or offladed to raid1/10d.
    It's queued in current->bio_list.

    smaller than the width of an unsigned integer.

    perf/core: Fix use-after-free in perf_release()
    
    commit e552a8389aa409e257b7dcba74f67f128f979ccc upstream.
    
    Dmitry reported syzcaller tripped a use-after-free in perf_release().
    
    After much puzzlement Oleg spotted the below scenario:
    
      Task1                           Task2
    
      fork()
        perf_event_init_task()
        /* ... */
        goto bad_fork_$foo;
        /* ... */
        perf_event_free_task()
          mutex_lock(ctx->lock)
          perf_free_event(B)
    
                                      perf_event_release_kernel(A)
                                        mutex_lock(A->child_mutex)
                                        list_for_each_entry(child, ...) {
                                          /* child == B */
                                          ctx = B->ctx;
                                          get_ctx(ctx);
                                          mutex_unlock(A->child_mutex);
    
            mutex_lock(A->child_mutex)
            list_del_init(B->child_list)
            mutex_unlock(A->child_mutex)
    
            /* ... */
    
          mutex_unlock(ctx->lock);
          put_ctx() /* >0 */
        free_task();
                                          mutex_lock(ctx->lock);
                                          mutex_lock(A->child_mutex);
                                          /* ... */
                                          mutex_unlock(A->child_mutex);
                                          mutex_unlock(ctx->lock)
                                          put_ctx() /* 0 */
                                            ctx->task && !TOMBSTONE
                                              put_task_struct() /* UAF */
    
    This patch closes the hole by making perf_event_free_task() destroy the
    task <-> ctx relation such that perf_event_release_kernel() will no longer
    observe the now dead task.

    commit 73580dac7618e4bcd21679f553cf3c97323fec46 upstream.
    
    On those parisc machines which don't provide a software power off
    function, the system currently kills the init process at the end of a
    shutdown and unexpectedly restarts insteads of halting.
    Fix it by adding a loop which will not return.

    parisc: Optimize flush_kernel_vmap_range and invalidate_kernel_vmap_range
    
    commit 316ec0624f951166daedbe446988ef92ae72b59f upstream.
    
    The previously submitted patch did not resolve the random segmentation
    faults observed on the phantom buildd system.  There are still
    unresolved problems with the Debian 4.8 and 4.9 kernels on C8000.
    
    The attached patch removes the flush of the offset map pages and does a
    whole data cache flush for large ranges.  No other arch flushes the
    offset map in these routines as far as I can tell.
    
    I have not observed any random segmentation faults on rp3440 in two
    weeks of testing with 4.10.0 and 4.10.1.

    give up on gcc ilog2() constant optimizations
    
    commit 474c90156c8dcc2fa815e6716cc9394d7930cb9c upstream.
    
    gcc-7 has an "optimization" pass that completely screws up, and
    generates the code expansion for the (impossible) case of calling
    ilog2() with a zero constant, even when the code gcc compiles does not
    actually have a zero constant.
    
    And we try to generate a compile-time error for anybody doing ilog2() on
    a constant where that doesn't make sense (be it zero or negative).  So
    now gcc7 will fail the build due to our sanity checking, because it
    created that constant-zero case that didn't actually exist in the source
    code.
    
    There's a whole long discussion on the kernel mailing about how to work
    around this gcc bug.  The gcc people themselevs have discussed their
    "feature" in
    
       https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=72785
    
    but it's all water under the bridge, because while it looked at one
    point like it would be solved by the time gcc7 was released, that was
    not to be.
    
    So now we have to deal with this compiler braindamage.
    
    And the only simple approach seems to be to just delete the code that
    tries to warn about bad uses of ilog2().
    
    So now "ilog2()" will just return 0 not just for the value 1, but for
    any non-positive value too.
    
    It's not like I can recall anybody having ever actually tried to use
    this function on any invalid value, but maybe the sanity check just
    meant that such code never made it out in public.

    drm/vc4: Use runtime autosuspend to avoid thrashing V3D power state.
    
    commit 3a62234680d86efa0239665ed8a0e908f1aef147 upstream.
    
    The pm_runtime_put() we were using immediately released power on the
    device, which meant that we were generally turning the device off and
    on once per frame.  In many profiles I've looked at, that added up to
    about 1% of CPU time, but this could get worse in the case of frequent
    rendering and readback (as may happen in X rendering).  By keeping the
    device on until we've been idle for a couple of frames, we drop the
    overhead of runtime PM down to sub-.1%.

    drm/vc4: Fix termination of the initial scan for branch targets.
    
    commit 457e67a728696c4f8e6423c64e93def50530db9a upstream.
    
    The loop is scanning until the original max_ip (size of the BO), but
    we want to not examine any code after the PROG_END's delay slots.
    There was a block trying to do that, except that we had some early
    continue statements if the signal wasn't a PROG_END or a BRANCH.
    
    The failure mode would be that a valid shader is rejected because some
    undefined memory after the PROG_END slots is parsed as a branch and
    the rest of its setup is illegal.  I haven't seen this in the wild,
    but valgrind was complaining when about this up in the userland
    simulator mode.
