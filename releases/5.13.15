    commit 514e97674400462cc09c459a1ddfb9bf39017223 upstream.
    
    My local syzbot instance hit memory leak in usb_set_configuration().
    The problem was in unputted usb interface. In case of errors after
    usb_get_intf() the reference should be putted to correclty free memory
    allocated for this interface.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Workaround for conflicting SSID on ASUS ROG Strix G17
    
    commit 13d9c6b998aaa76fd098133277a28a21f2cc2264 upstream.
    
    ASUS ROG Strix G17 has the very same PCI and codec SSID (1043:103f) as
    ASUS TX300, and unfortunately, the existing quirk for TX300 is broken
    on ASUS ROG.  Actually the device works without the quirk, so we'll
    need to clear the quirk before applying for this device.
    Since ASUS ROG has a different codec (ALC294 - while TX300 has
    ALC282), this patch adds a workaround for the device, just clearing
    the codec->fixup_id by checking the codec vendor_id.
    
    It's a bit ugly to add such a workaround there, but it seems to be the
    simplest way.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix regression on Sony WALKMAN NW-A45 DAC
    
    commit 7af5a14371c1cf94a41f08eabb62a3faceec8911 upstream.
    
    We've got a regression report for USB-audio with Sony WALKMAN NW-A45
    DAC device where no sound is audible on recent kernel.  The bisection
    resulted in the code change wrt endpoint management, and the further
    debug session revealed that it was caused by the order of the USB
    audio interface.  In the earlier code, we always set up the USB
    interface at first before other setups, but it was changed to be done
    at the last for UAC2/3, which is more standard way, while keeping the
    old way for UAC1.  OTOH, this device seems requiring the setup of the
    interface at first just like UAC1.
    
    This patch works around the regression by applying the interface setup
    specifically for the WALKMAN at the beginning of the endpoint setup
    procedure.  This change is written straightforwardly to be easily
    backported in old kernels.  A further cleanup to move the workaround
    into a generic quirk section will follow in a later patch.

    In designs where the device is configured with CPU managed mode
    (CPU_MGD), on reset all SERDES ports (p0, p9, p10) have a stuck power
    down bit and require this initial power up procedure. As such apply this
    errata to all three SERDES ports of the mv88e6393x.

    qed: Fix the VF msix vectors flow
    
    [ Upstream commit b0cd08537db8d2fbb227cdb2e5835209db295a24 ]
    
    For VFs we should return with an error in case we didn't get the exact
    number of msix vectors as we requested.
    Not doing that will lead to a crash when starting queues for this VF.

    ext4: fix e2fsprogs checksum failure for mounted filesystem
    
    commit b2bbb92f7042e8075fb036bf97043339576330c3 upstream.
    
    Commit 81414b4dd48 ("ext4: remove redundant sb checksum
    recomputation") removed checksum recalculation after updating
    superblock free space / inode counters in ext4_fill_super() based on
    the fact that we will recalculate the checksum on superblock
    writeout.
    
    That is correct assumption but until the writeout happens (which can
    take a long time) the checksum is incorrect in the buffer cache and if
    programs such as tune2fs or resize2fs is called shortly after a file
    system is mounted can fail.  So return back the checksum recalculation
    and add a comment explaining why.

    ext4: fix race writing to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing
    
    commit a54c4613dac1500b40e4ab55199f7c51f028e848 upstream.
    
    The location of the system.data extended attribute can change whenever
    xattr_sem is not taken.  So we need to recalculate the i_inline_off
    field since it mgiht have changed between ext4_write_begin() and
    ext4_write_end().
    
    This means that caching i_inline_off is probably not helpful, so in
    the long run we should probably get rid of it and shrink the in-memory
    ext4 inode slightly, but let's fix the race the simple way for now.
