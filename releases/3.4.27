    staging: vt6656: Fix inconsistent structure packing
    
    commit 1ee4c55fc9620451b2a825d793042a7e0775391b upstream.
    
    vt6656 has several headers that use the #pragma pack(1) directive to
    enable structure packing, but never disable it.  The layout of
    structures defined in other headers can then depend on which order the
    various headers are included in, breaking the One Definition Rule.
    
    In practice this resulted in crashes on x86_64 until the order of header
    inclusion was changed for some files in commit 11d404cb56ecd ('staging:
    vt6656: fix headers and add cfg80211.').  But we need a proper fix that
    won't be affected by future changes to the order of inclusion.
    
    This removes the #pragma pack(1) directives and adds __packed to the
    structure definitions for which packing appears to have been intended.

    xen: Fix stack corruption in xen_failsafe_callback for 32bit PVOPS guests.
    
    commit 9174adbee4a9a49d0139f5d71969852b36720809 upstream.
    
    This fixes CVE-2013-0190 / XSA-40
    
    There has been an error on the xen_failsafe_callback path for failed
    iret, which causes the stack pointer to be wrong when entering the
    iret_exc error path.  This can result in the kernel crashing.
    
    In the classic kernel case, the relevant code looked a little like:
    
            popl %eax      # Error code from hypervisor
            jz 5f
            addl $16,%esp
            jmp iret_exc   # Hypervisor said iret fault
    5:      addl $16,%esp
                           # Hypervisor said segment selector fault
    
    Here, there are two identical addls on either option of a branch which
    appears to have been optimised by hoisting it above the jz, and
    converting it to an lea, which leaves the flags register unaffected.
    
    In the PVOPS case, the code looks like:
    
            popl_cfi %eax         # Error from the hypervisor
            lea 16(%esp),%esp     # Add $16 before choosing fault path
            CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET -16
            jz 5f
            addl $16,%esp         # Incorrectly adjust %esp again
            jmp iret_exc
    
    It is possible unprivileged userspace applications to cause this
    behaviour, for example by loading an LDT code selector, then changing
    the code selector to be not-present.  At this point, there is a race
    condition where it is possible for the hypervisor to return back to
    userspace from an interrupt, fault on its own iret, and inject a
    failsafe_callback into the kernel.
    
    This bug has been present since the introduction of Xen PVOPS support
    in commit 5ead97c84 (xen: Core Xen implementation), in 2.6.23.

    xen/grant-table: correctly initialize grant table version 1
    
    commit d0b4d64aadb9f4a90669848de9ef3819050a98cd upstream.
    
    Commit 85ff6acb075a484780b3d763fdf41596d8fc0970 (xen/granttable: Grant
    tables V2 implementation) changed the GREFS_PER_GRANT_FRAME macro from
    a constant to a conditional expression. The expression depends on
    grant_table_version being appropriately set. Unfortunately, at init
    time grant_table_version will be 0. The GREFS_PER_GRANT_FRAME
    conditional expression checks for "grant_table_version == 1", and
    therefore returns the number of grant references per frame for v2.
    
    This causes gnttab_init() to allocate fewer pages for gnttab_list, as
    a frame can old half the number of v2 entries than v1 entries. After
    gnttab_resume() is called, grant_table_version is appropriately
    set. nr_init_grefs will then be miscalculated and gnttab_free_count
    will hold a value larger than the actual number of free gref entries.
    
    If a guest is heavily utilizing improperly initialized v1 grant
    tables, memory corruption can occur. One common manifestation is
    corruption of the vmalloc list, resulting in a poisoned pointer
    derefrence when accessing /proc/meminfo or /proc/vmallocinfo:
    
    [   40.770064] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000200200001407
    [   40.770083] IP: [<ffffffff811a6fb0>] get_vmalloc_info+0x70/0x110

    [   40.770107] Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP
    [   40.770114] CPU 10
    
    This patch introduces a static variable, grefs_per_grant_frame, to
    cache the calculated value. gnttab_init() now calls
    gnttab_request_version() early so that grant_table_version and
    grefs_per_grant_frame can be appropriately set. A few BUG_ON()s have
    been added to prevent this type of bug from reoccurring in the future.

    r8169: avoid NAPI scheduling delay.
    
    commit 7dbb491878a2c51d372a8890fa45a8ff80358af1 upstream.
    
    While reworking the r8169 driver a few months ago to perform the
    smallest amount of work in the irq handler, I took care of avoiding
    any irq mask register operation in the slow work dedicated user
    context thread. The slow work thread scheduled an extra round of NAPI
    work which would ultimately set the irq mask register as required,
    thus keeping such irq mask operations in the NAPI handler.
    It would eventually race with the irq handler and delay NAPI execution
    for - assuming no further irq - a whole ksoftirqd period. Mildly a
    problem for rare link changes or corner case PCI events.
    
    The race was always lost after the last bh disabling lock had been
    removed from the work thread and people started wondering where those
    pesky "NOHZ: local_softirq_pending 08" messages came from.
    
    Actually the irq mask register _can_ be set up directly in the slow
    work thread.

    ALSA: usb - fix race in creation of M-Audio Fast track pro driver
    
    commit b98ae2729dea161edc96c9d177459b6c28bcbba5 upstream.
    
    A patch in the 3.2 kernel caused regression with hotplugging the
    M-Audio Fast track pro, or sound after suspend. I don't have the
    device so I haven't done a full analysis, but it seems userspace
    (both udev and pulseaudio) got confused when a card was created,
    immediately destroyed, and then created again.
    
    However, at least one person in the bug report (martin djfun)
    reports that this patch resolves the issue for him. It also leaves
    a message in the log:
    "snd-usb-audio: probe of 1-1.1:1.1 failed with error -5" which is
    a bit misleading. It is better than non-working audio, but maybe
    there's a more elegant solution?

    x86/Sandy Bridge: reserve pages when integrated graphics is present
    
    commit a9acc5365dbda29f7be2884efb63771dc24bd815 upstream.
    
    SNB graphics devices have a bug that prevent them from accessing certain
    memory ranges, namely anything below 1M and in the pages listed in the
    table.  So reserve those at boot if set detect a SNB gfx device on the
    CPU to avoid GPU hangs.
    
    Stephane Marchesin had a similar patch to the page allocator awhile
    back, but rather than reserving pages up front, it leaked them at
    allocation time.
    
    [ hpa: made a number of stylistic changes, marked arrays as static
      const, and made less verbose; use "memblock=debug" for full
      verbosity. ]

    s390/time: fix sched_clock() overflow
    
    commit ed4f20943cd4c7b55105c04daedf8d63ab6d499c upstream.
    
    Converting a 64 Bit TOD format value to nanoseconds means that the value
    must be divided by 4.096. In order to achieve that we multiply with 125
    and divide by 512.
    When used within sched_clock() this triggers an overflow after appr.
    417 days. Resulting in a sched_clock() return value that is much smaller
    than previously and therefore may cause all sort of weird things in
    subsystems that rely on a monotonic sched_clock() behaviour.
    
    To fix this implement a tod_to_ns() helper function which converts TOD
    values without overflow and call this function from both places that
    open coded the conversion: sched_clock() and kvm_s390_handle_wait().

    target: Release se_cmd when LUN lookup fails for TMR
    
    commit 5a3b6fc0092c5f8dee7820064ee54d2631d48573 upstream.
    
    When transport_lookup_tmr_lun() fails and we return a task management
    response from target_complete_tmr_failure(), we need to call
    transport_cmd_check_stop_to_fabric() to release the last ref to the
    cmd after calling se_tfo->queue_tm_rsp(), or else we will never remove
    the failed TMR from the session command list (and we'll end up waiting
    forever when trying to tear down the session).

    sh: Fix FDPIC binary loader
    
    commit 4a71997a3279a339e7336ea5d0cd27282e2dea44 upstream.
    
    Ensure that the aux table is properly initialized, even when optional features
    are missing.  Without this, the FDPIC loader did not work.  This was meant to
    be included in commit d5ab780305bb6d60a7b5a74f18cf84eb6ad153b1.
