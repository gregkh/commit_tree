    net_sched: let qdisc_put() accept NULL pointer
    
    [ Upstream commit 6efb971ba8edfbd80b666f29de12882852f095ae ]
    
    When tcf_block_get() fails in sfb_init(), q->qdisc is still a NULL
    pointer which leads to a crash in sfb_destroy(). Similar for
    sch_dsmark.
    
    Instead of fixing each separately, Linus suggested to just accept
    NULL pointer in qdisc_put(), which would make callers easier.
    
    (For sch_dsmark, the bug probably exists long before commit
    6529eaba33f0.)

    ARC: export "abort" for modules
    
    This is a custom patch (no mainline equivalent) for stable backport only
    to address 0-Day kernel test infra ARC 4.x.y builds errors.
    
    The reason for this custom patch as that it is a single patch, touches
    only ARC, vs. atleast two 7c2c11b208be09c1, dc8635b78cd8669 which touch
    atleast 3 other arches (one long removed) and could potentially have a
    fallout.

    keys: Fix missing null pointer check in request_key_auth_describe()
    
    [ Upstream commit d41a3effbb53b1bcea41e328d16a4d046a508381 ]
    
    If a request_key authentication token key gets revoked, there's a window in
    which request_key_auth_describe() can see it with a NULL payload - but it
    makes no check for this and something like the following oops may occur:

    > 'ioapic_dynirq_base' contains the virtual IRQ base number. Presently, it is
    > updated to the end of hardware IRQ numbers but this is done only when IOAPIC
    > configuration type is IOAPIC_DOMAIN_LEGACY or IOAPIC_DOMAIN_STRICT. There is

    Such systems will very likely not even boot.
    
    For DT enabled machines ioapic_dynirq_base is irrelevant and not
    updated, so simply map the IRQ base 1:1 instead.

    r8152: Set memory to all 0xFFs on failed reg reads
    
    [ Upstream commit f53a7ad189594a112167efaf17ea8d0242b5ac00 ]
    
    get_registers() blindly copies the memory written to by the
    usb_control_msg() call even if the underlying urb failed.
    
    This could lead to junk register values being read by the driver, since
    some indirect callers of get_registers() ignore the return values. One
    example is:
      ocp_read_dword() ignores the return value of generic_ocp_read(), which
      calls get_registers().
    
    So, emulate PCI "Master Abort" behavior by setting the buffer to all
    0xFFs when usb_control_msg() fails.
    
    This patch is copied from the r8152 driver (v2.12.0) published by
    Realtek (www.realtek.com).

    ARM: 8874/1: mm: only adjust sections of valid mm structures
    
    [ Upstream commit c51bc12d06b3a5494fbfcbd788a8e307932a06e9 ]
    
    A timing hazard exists when an early fork/exec thread begins
    exiting and sets its mm pointer to NULL while a separate core
    tries to update the section information.
    
    This commit ensures that the mm pointer is not NULL before
    setting its section parameters. The arguments provided by
    commit 11ce4b33aedc ("ARM: 8672/1: mm: remove tasklist locking
    from update_sections_early()") are equally valid for not
    requiring grabbing the task_lock around this check.

    argument count. The reason is that we want to ensure we record the
    I/O stats correctly in the case where an error is returned (for
    instance in the layoutstats).

    NFSv4: Fix return values for nfs4_file_open()
    
    [ Upstream commit 90cf500e338ab3f3c0f126ba37e36fb6a9058441 ]
    
    Currently, we are translating RPC level errors such as timeouts,
    as well as interrupts etc into EOPENSTALE, which forces a single
    replay of the open attempt. What we actually want to do is
    force the replay only in the cases where the returned error
    indicates that the file may have changed on the server.
    
    So the fix is to spell out the exact set of errors where we want
    to return EOPENSTALE.

    s390/bpf: use 32-bit index for tail calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 91b4db5313a2c793aabc2143efb8ed0cf0fdd097 ]
    
    "p runtime/jit: pass > 32bit index to tail_call" fails when
    bpf_jit_enable=1, because the tail call is not executed.
    
    This in turn is because the generated code assumes index is 64-bit,
    while it must be 32-bit, and as a result prog array bounds check fails,
    while it should pass. Even if bounds check would have passed, the code
    that follows uses 64-bit index to compute prog array offset.
    
    Fix by using clrj instead of clgrj for comparing index with array size,
    and also by using llgfr for truncating index to 32 bits before using it
    to compute prog array offset.

    ARM: OMAP2+: Fix omap4 errata warning on other SoCs
    
    [ Upstream commit 45da5e09dd32fa98c32eaafe2513db6bd75e2f4f ]
    
    We have errata i688 workaround produce warnings on SoCs other than
    omap4 and omap5:
    
    omap4_sram_init:Unable to allocate sram needed to handle errata I688
    omap4_sram_init:Unable to get sram pool needed to handle errata I688
    
    This is happening because there is no ti,omap4-mpu node, or no SRAM
    to configure for the other SoCs, so let's remove the warning based
    on the SoC revision checks.
    
    As nobody has complained it seems that the other SoC variants do not
    need this workaround.

    [ Upstream commit bb2d267c448f4bc3a3389d97c56391cb779178ae ]
    
    "masking, test in bounds 3" fails on s390, because
    BPF_ALU64_IMM(BPF_NEG, BPF_REG_2, 0) ignores the top 32 bits of
    BPF_REG_2. The reason is that JIT emits lcgfr instead of lcgr.
    The associated comment indicates that the code was intended to
    emit lcgr in the first place, it's just that the wrong opcode
    was used.
    
    Fix by using the correct opcode.

    xen-netfront: do not assume sk_buff_head list is empty in error handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 00b368502d18f790ab715e055869fd4bb7484a9b ]
    
    When skb_shinfo(skb) is not able to cache extra fragment (that is,
    skb_shinfo(skb)->nr_frags >= MAX_SKB_FRAGS), xennet_fill_frags() assumes
    the sk_buff_head list is already empty. As a result, cons is increased only
    by 1 and returns to error handling path in xennet_poll().
    
    However, if the sk_buff_head list is not empty, queue->rx.rsp_cons may be
    set incorrectly. That is, queue->rx.rsp_cons would point to the rx ring
    buffer entries whose queue->rx_skbs[i] and queue->grant_rx_ref[i] are
    already cleared to NULL. This leads to NULL pointer access in the next
    iteration to process rx ring buffer entries.
    
    Below is how xennet_poll() does error handling. All remaining entries in
    tmpq are accounted to queue->rx.rsp_cons without assuming how many
    outstanding skbs are remained in the list.
    
     985 static int xennet_poll(struct napi_struct *napi, int budget)
    ... ...
    1032           if (unlikely(xennet_set_skb_gso(skb, gso))) {
    1033                   __skb_queue_head(&tmpq, skb);
    1034                   queue->rx.rsp_cons += skb_queue_len(&tmpq);
    1035                   goto err;
    1036           }
    
    It is better to always have the error handling in the same way.

    modified the way boot parameters were saved on x86.  When this was

    Unfortunately, e820_table did exist, it was just named e820_map
    in this kernel version.
    
    This was breaking booting on a Supermicro Super Server/A2SDi-2C-HLN4F
    with a Denverton CPU.  Adding e820_map to the saved boot params table
    fixes the issue.

    The error occurs when the descriptors_changed() routine (called during
    a device reset) attempts to compare the old and new BOS and capability
    descriptors.  The length it uses for the comparison is the
    wTotalLength value stored in BOS descriptor, but this value is not
    necessarily the same as the length actually allocated for the
    descriptors.  If it is larger the routine will call memcmp() with a
    length that is too big, thus reading beyond the end of the allocated
    region and leading to this fault.
    
    The kernel reads the BOS descriptor twice: first to get the total
    length of all the capability descriptors, and second to read it along
    with all those other descriptors.  A malicious (or very faulty) device
    may send different values for the BOS descriptor fields each time.
    The memory area will be allocated using the wTotalLength value read
    the first time, but stored within it will be the value read the second
    time.
    
    To prevent this possibility from causing any errors, this patch
    modifies the BOS descriptor after it has been read the second time:
    It sets the wTotalLength field to the actual length of the descriptors
    that were read in and validated.  Then the memcpy() call, or any other
    code using these descriptors, will be able to rely on wTotalLength
    being valid.

    ARC: configs: Remove CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE from defconfigs
    
    commit 64234961c145606b36eaa82c47b11be842b21049 upstream.
    
    We used to have pre-set CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE with local path
    to intramfs in ARC defconfigs. This was quite convenient for
    in-house development but not that convenient for newcomers
    who obviusly don't have folders like "arc_initramfs" next to
    the Linux source tree. Which leads to quite surprising failure
    of defconfig building:
    ------------------------------->8-----------------------------
      ../scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh: Cannot open '../../arc_initramfs_hs/'
    ../usr/Makefile:57: recipe for target 'usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz' failed
    make[2]: *** [usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz] Error 1
    ------------------------------->8-----------------------------
    
    So now when more and more people start to deal with our defconfigs
    let's make their life easier with removal of CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE.

    MIPS: netlogic: xlr: Remove erroneous check in nlm_fmn_send()
    
    commit 02eec6c9fc0cb13169cc97a6139771768791f92b upstream.
    
    In nlm_fmn_send() we have a loop which attempts to send a message
    multiple times in order to handle the transient failure condition of a
    lack of available credit. When examining the status register to detect
    the failure we check for a condition that can never be true, which falls
    foul of gcc 8's -Wtautological-compare:
    
      In file included from arch/mips/netlogic/common/irq.c:65:
      ./arch/mips/include/asm/netlogic/xlr/fmn.h: In function 'nlm_fmn_send':
      ./arch/mips/include/asm/netlogic/xlr/fmn.h:304:22: error: bitwise
        comparison always evaluates to false [-Werror=tautological-compare]
         if ((status & 0x2) == 1)
                            ^~
    
    If the path taken if this condition were true all we do is print a
    message to the kernel console. Since failures seem somewhat expected
    here (making the console message questionable anyway) and the condition
    has clearly never evaluated true we simply remove it, rather than
    attempting to fix it to check status correctly.

    x86/build: Add -Wnoaddress-of-packed-member to REALMODE_CFLAGS, to silence GCC9 build warning
    
    commit 42e0e95474fc6076b5cd68cab8fa0340a1797a72 upstream.
    
    One of the very few warnings I have in the current build comes from
    arch/x86/boot/edd.c, where I get the following with a gcc9 build:
    
       arch/x86/boot/edd.c: In function ‘query_edd’:
       arch/x86/boot/edd.c:148:11: warning: taking address of packed member of ‘struct boot_params’ may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Waddress-of-packed-member]
         148 |  mbrptr = boot_params.edd_mbr_sig_buffer;
             |           ^~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This warning triggers because we throw away all the CFLAGS and then make
    a new set for REALMODE_CFLAGS, so the -Wno-address-of-packed-member we
    added in the following commit is not present:
    
      6f303d60534c ("gcc-9: silence 'address-of-packed-member' warning")
    
    The simplest solution for now is to adjust the warning for this version
    of CFLAGS as well, but it would definitely make sense to examine whether
    REALMODE_CFLAGS could be derived from CFLAGS, so that it picks up changes
    in the compiler flags environment automatically.

    commit ee483d32ee1a1a7f7d7e918fbc350c790a5af64a upstream.
    
    When data size is not a multiple of the alg's block size,
    the SEC generates an error interrupt and dumps the registers.
    And for NULL size, the SEC does just nothing and the interrupt
    is awaited forever.
    
    This patch ensures the data size is correct before submitting

    driver core: Fix use-after-free and double free on glue directory
    
    commit ac43432cb1f5c2950408534987e57c2071e24d8f upstream.
    
    There is a race condition between removing glue directory and adding a new
    device under the glue dir. It can be reproduced in following test:
    
    CPU1:                                         CPU2:
    
    device_add()
      get_device_parent()
        class_dir_create_and_add()
          kobject_add_internal()
            create_dir()    // create glue_dir
    
                                                  device_add()
                                                    get_device_parent()
                                                      kobject_get() // get glue_dir
    
    device_del()
      cleanup_glue_dir()
        kobject_del(glue_dir)
    
                                                    kobject_add()
                                                      kobject_add_internal()
                                                        create_dir() // in glue_dir
                                                          sysfs_create_dir_ns()
                                                            kernfs_create_dir_ns(sd)
    
          sysfs_remove_dir() // glue_dir->sd=NULL
          sysfs_put()        // free glue_dir->sd
    
                                                              // sd is freed
                                                              kernfs_new_node(sd)
                                                                kernfs_get(glue_dir)
                                                                kernfs_add_one()
                                                                kernfs_put()
    
    Before CPU1 remove last child device under glue dir, if CPU2 add a new
    device under glue dir, the glue_dir kobject reference count will be
    increase to 2 via kobject_get() in get_device_parent(). And CPU2 has
    been called kernfs_create_dir_ns(), but not call kernfs_new_node().
    Meanwhile, CPU1 call sysfs_remove_dir() and sysfs_put(). This result in
    glue_dir->sd is freed and it's reference count will be 0. Then CPU2 call
    kernfs_get(glue_dir) will trigger a warning in kernfs_get() and increase
    it's reference count to 1. Because glue_dir->sd is freed by CPU1, the next
    call kernfs_add_one() by CPU2 will fail(This is also use-after-free)
    and call kernfs_put() to decrease reference count. Because the reference
    count is decremented to 0, it will also call kmem_cache_free() to free
    the glue_dir->sd again. This will result in double free.
    
    In order to avoid this happening, we also should make sure that kernfs_node
    for glue_dir is released in CPU1 only when refcount for glue_dir kobj is
    1 to fix this race.
    
    The following calltrace is captured in kernel 4.14 with the following patch
    applied:

    clk: rockchip: Don't yell about bad mmc phases when getting
    
    commit 6943b839721ad4a31ad2bacf6e71b21f2dfe3134 upstream.
    
    At boot time, my rk3288-veyron devices yell with 8 lines that look
    like this:
      [    0.000000] rockchip_mmc_get_phase: invalid clk rate
    
    This is because the clock framework at clk_register() time tries to
    get the phase but we don't have a parent yet.
    
    While the errors appear to be harmless they are still ugly and, in
    general, we don't want yells like this in the log unless they are
    important.
    
    There's no real reason to be yelling here.  We can still return
    -EINVAL to indicate that the phase makes no sense without a parent.
    If someone really tries to do tuning and the clock is reported as 0
    then we'll see the yells in rockchip_mmc_set_phase().

    MIPS: VDSO: Use same -m%-float cflag as the kernel proper
    
    commit 0648e50e548d881d025b9419a1a168753c8e2bf7 upstream.
    
    The MIPS VDSO build currently doesn't provide the -msoft-float flag to
    the compiler as the kernel proper does. This results in an attempt to
    use the compiler's default floating point configuration, which can be
    problematic in cases where this is incompatible with the target CPU's
    -march= flag. For example decstation_defconfig fails to build using
    toolchains in which gcc was configured --with-fp-32=xx with the
    following error:
    
        LDS     arch/mips/vdso/vdso.lds
      cc1: error: '-march=r3000' requires '-mfp32'
      make[2]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:379: arch/mips/vdso/vdso.lds] Error 1
    
    The kernel proper avoids this error because we build with the
    -msoft-float compiler flag, rather than using the compiler's default.
    Pass this flag through to the VDSO build so that it too becomes agnostic
    to the toolchain's floating point configuration.
    
    Note that this is filtered out from KBUILD_CFLAGS rather than simply
    always using -msoft-float such that if we switch the kernel to use
    -mno-float in the future the VDSO will automatically inherit the change.
    
    The VDSO doesn't actually include any floating point code, and its
    .MIPS.abiflags section is already manually generated to specify that
    it's compatible with any floating point ABI. As such this change should
    have no effect on the resulting VDSO, apart from fixing the build
    failure for affected toolchains.

    as the CR2 and error code.
    
    The right behavior would be to abort the VM with a KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR
    exit to userspace; however, it is not an easy fix, so for now just ensure
    that the error code and CR2 are zero.

    KVM: s390: Do not leak kernel stack data in the KVM_S390_INTERRUPT ioctl
    
    commit 53936b5bf35e140ae27e4bbf0447a61063f400da upstream.
    
    When the userspace program runs the KVM_S390_INTERRUPT ioctl to inject
    an interrupt, we convert them from the legacy struct kvm_s390_interrupt
    to the new struct kvm_s390_irq via the s390int_to_s390irq() function.
    However, this function does not take care of all types of interrupts
    that we can inject into the guest later (see do_inject_vcpu()). Since we
    do not clear out the s390irq values before calling s390int_to_s390irq(),
    there is a chance that we copy random data from the kernel stack which
    could be leaked to the userspace later.
    
    Specifically, the problem exists with the KVM_S390_INT_PFAULT_INIT
    interrupt: s390int_to_s390irq() does not handle it, and the function
    __inject_pfault_init() later copies irq->u.ext which contains the
    random kernel stack data. This data can then be leaked either to
    the guest memory in __deliver_pfault_init(), or the userspace might
    retrieve it directly with the KVM_S390_GET_IRQ_STATE ioctl.
    
    Fix it by handling that interrupt type in s390int_to_s390irq(), too,
    and by making sure that the s390irq struct is properly pre-initialized.
    And while we're at it, make sure that s390int_to_s390irq() now
    directly returns -EINVAL for unknown interrupt types, so that we
    immediately get a proper error code in case we add more interrupt
    types to do_inject_vcpu() without updating s390int_to_s390irq()
    sometime in the future.

    genirq: Prevent NULL pointer dereference in resend_irqs()
    
    commit eddf3e9c7c7e4d0707c68d1bb22cc6ec8aef7d4a upstream.
    
    The following crash was observed:
    
      Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000158
      Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] SMP

       ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18
    
    The reason for this is that the interrupt resend mechanism happens in soft
    interrupt context, which is a asynchronous mechanism versus other
    operations on interrupts. free_irq() does not take resend handling into
    account. Thus, the irq descriptor might be already freed before the resend
    tasklet is executed. resend_irqs() does not check the return value of the
    interrupt descriptor lookup and derefences the return value
    unconditionally.
    
      1):
      __setup_irq
        irq_startup
          check_irq_resend  // activate softirq to handle resend irq
      2):
      irq_domain_free_irqs
        irq_free_descs
          free_desc
            call_rcu(&desc->rcu, delayed_free_desc)
      3):
      __do_softirq
        tasklet_action
          resend_irqs
            desc = irq_to_desc(irq)
            desc->handle_irq(desc)  // desc is NULL --> Ooops
    
    Fix this by adding a NULL pointer check in resend_irqs() before derefencing
    the irq descriptor.

    Btrfs: fix assertion failure during fsync and use of stale transaction
    
    commit 410f954cb1d1c79ae485dd83a175f21954fd87cd upstream.
    
    Sometimes when fsync'ing a file we need to log that other inodes exist and
    when we need to do that we acquire a reference on the inodes and then drop
    that reference using iput() after logging them.
    
    That generally is not a problem except if we end up doing the final iput()
    (dropping the last reference) on the inode and that inode has a link count
    of 0, which can happen in a very short time window if the logging path
    gets a reference on the inode while it's being unlinked.
    
    In that case we end up getting the eviction callback, btrfs_evict_inode(),
    invoked through the iput() call chain which needs to drop all of the
    inode's items from its subvolume btree, and in order to do that, it needs
    to join a transaction at the helper function evict_refill_and_join().
    However because the task previously started a transaction at the fsync
    handler, btrfs_sync_file(), it has current->journal_info already pointing
    to a transaction handle and therefore evict_refill_and_join() will get
    that transaction handle from btrfs_join_transaction(). From this point on,
    two different problems can happen:
    
    1) evict_refill_and_join() will often change the transaction handle's
       block reserve (->block_rsv) and set its ->bytes_reserved field to a
       value greater than 0. If evict_refill_and_join() never commits the
       transaction, the eviction handler ends up decreasing the reference
       count (->use_count) of the transaction handle through the call to
       btrfs_end_transaction(), and after that point we have a transaction
       handle with a NULL ->block_rsv (which is the value prior to the
       transaction join from evict_refill_and_join()) and a ->bytes_reserved
       value greater than 0. If after the eviction/iput completes the inode
       logging path hits an error or it decides that it must fallback to a
       transaction commit, the btrfs fsync handle, btrfs_sync_file(), gets a
       non-zero value from btrfs_log_dentry_safe(), and because of that
       non-zero value it tries to commit the transaction using a handle with
       a NULL ->block_rsv and a non-zero ->bytes_reserved value. This makes
       the transaction commit hit an assertion failure at
       btrfs_trans_release_metadata() because ->bytes_reserved is not zero but
       the ->block_rsv is NULL. The produced stack trace for that is like the
       following:

    2) If evict_refill_and_join() decides to commit the transaction, it will
       be able to do it, since the nested transaction join only increments the
       transaction handle's ->use_count reference counter and it does not
       prevent the transaction from getting committed. This means that after
       eviction completes, the fsync logging path will be using a transaction
       handle that refers to an already committed transaction. What happens
       when using such a stale transaction can be unpredictable, we are at
       least having a use-after-free on the transaction handle itself, since
       the transaction commit will call kmem_cache_free() against the handle
       regardless of its ->use_count value, or we can end up silently losing
       all the updates to the log tree after that iput() in the logging path,
       or using a transaction handle that in the meanwhile was allocated to
       another task for a new transaction, etc, pretty much unpredictable
       what can happen.
    
    In order to fix both of them, instead of using iput() during logging, use
    btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), so that the logging path of fsync never drops
    the last reference on an inode, that step is offloaded to a safe context
    (usually the cleaner kthread).
    
    The assertion failure issue was sporadically triggered by the test case
    generic/475 from fstests, which loads the dm error target while fsstress
    is running, which lead to fsync failing while logging inodes with -EIO
    errors and then trying later to commit the transaction, triggering the
    assertion failure.

    tcp: fix tcp_ecn_withdraw_cwr() to clear TCP_ECN_QUEUE_CWR
    
    [ Upstream commit af38d07ed391b21f7405fa1f936ca9686787d6d2 ]
    
    Fix tcp_ecn_withdraw_cwr() to clear the correct bit:
    TCP_ECN_QUEUE_CWR.
    
    Rationale: basically, TCP_ECN_DEMAND_CWR is a bit that is purely about
    the behavior of data receivers, and deciding whether to reflect
    incoming IP ECN CE marks as outgoing TCP th->ece marks. The
    TCP_ECN_QUEUE_CWR bit is purely about the behavior of data senders,
    and deciding whether to send CWR. The tcp_ecn_withdraw_cwr() function
    is only called from tcp_undo_cwnd_reduction() by data senders during
    an undo, so it should zero the sender-side state,
    TCP_ECN_QUEUE_CWR. It does not make sense to stop the reflection of
    incoming CE bits on incoming data packets just because outgoing
    packets were spuriously retransmitted.
    
    The bug has been reproduced with packetdrill to manifest in a scenario
    with RFC3168 ECN, with an incoming data packet with CE bit set and
    carrying a TCP timestamp value that causes cwnd undo. Before this fix,
    the IP CE bit was ignored and not reflected in the TCP ECE header bit,
    and sender sent a TCP CWR ('W') bit on the next outgoing data packet,
    even though the cwnd reduction had been undone.  After this fix, the
    sender properly reflects the CE bit and does not set the W bit.
    
    Note: the bug actually predates 2005 git history; this Fixes footer is
    chosen to be the oldest SHA1 I have tested (from Sep 2007) for which
    the patch applies cleanly (since before this commit the code was in a
    .h file).

    check, instead of asoc's. Otherwise, it's meaningless to make
    pf_retrans per transport.

    net: Fix null de-reference of device refcount
    
    [ Upstream commit 10cc514f451a0f239aa34f91bc9dc954a9397840 ]
    
    In event of failure during register_netdevice, free_netdev is
    invoked immediately. free_netdev assumes that all the netdevice
    refcounts have been dropped prior to it being called and as a
    result frees and clears out the refcount pointer.
    
    However, this is not necessarily true as some of the operations
    in the NETDEV_UNREGISTER notifier handlers queue RCU callbacks for
    invocation after a grace period. The IPv4 callback in_dev_rcu_put
    tries to access the refcount after free_netdev is called which
    leads to a null de-reference-

    ipv6: Fix the link time qualifier of 'ping_v6_proc_exit_net()'
    
    [ Upstream commit d23dbc479a8e813db4161a695d67da0e36557846 ]
    
    The '.exit' functions from 'pernet_operations' structure should be marked
    as __net_exit, not __net_init.

    cdc_ether: fix rndis support for Mediatek based smartphones
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d7ffcf3bf1be98d876c570cab8fc31d9fa92725 ]
    
    A Mediatek based smartphone owner reports problems with USB
    tethering in Linux.  The verbose USB listing shows a rndis_host
    interface pair (e0/01/03 + 10/00/00), but the driver fails to
    bind with
    
    [  355.960428] usb 1-4: bad CDC descriptors
    
    The problem is a failsafe test intended to filter out ACM serial
    functions using the same 02/02/ff class/subclass/protocol as RNDIS.
    The serial functions are recognized by their non-zero bmCapabilities.
    
    No RNDIS function with non-zero bmCapabilities were known at the time
    this failsafe was added. But it turns out that some Wireless class
    RNDIS functions are using the bmCapabilities field. These functions
    are uniquely identified as RNDIS by their class/subclass/protocol, so
    the failing test can safely be disabled.  The same applies to the two
    types of Misc class RNDIS functions.
    
    Applying the failsafe to Communication class functions only retains
    the original functionality, and fixes the problem for the Mediatek based
    smartphone.
    
    Tow examples of CDC functional descriptors with non-zero bmCapabilities
    from Wireless class RNDIS functions are:

    The Mediatek example is believed to apply to most smartphones with
    Mediatek firmware.  The ZTE example is most likely also part of a larger
    family of devices/firmwares.

    bridge/mdb: remove wrong use of NLM_F_MULTI
    
    [ Upstream commit 94a72b3f024fc7e9ab640897a1e38583a470659d ]
    
    NLM_F_MULTI must be used only when a NLMSG_DONE message is sent at the end.
    In fact, NLMSG_DONE is sent only at the end of a dump.
    
    Libraries like libnl will wait forever for NLMSG_DONE.
